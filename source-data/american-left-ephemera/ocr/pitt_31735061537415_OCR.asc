Our repeated estimates of impending economic crisis had many
harmful effects: projection of unrealistic economic programs; over-
estimation of the tempo of radicalization of the masses, with re-
sultant mistakes in tactical approaches to united front relations,
especially in the trade unions; and finally, encouragement of all ten—
dencies to overestimate the imminence of war and fascism.

The correction of our wrong approaches in this ﬁeld is a vital
prerequisite for obtaining a proper understanding of the present-day
American economy and for the development of a correct economic
program. The National Committee proposes, toward this end, that a
special commission be established to launch a thorough—going study
of the main theoretical questions confronting us, and on this basis to
make a fresh analysis of the total economic picture. All Party mem-
bers are urged to participate to the fullest extent in the study and dis-
cussion of these problems.

For, American capitalism has undergone great changes since the
pre-war years. Many important developments have become intensiﬁed
to such a degree that they have taken on certain new features-fea-
tures which have a pronounced effect on the course of the economic
cycle and all related economic factors.

Central among these is the tremendous growth of monopoly, as
a result of which the impact of monopoly control on the determina-
tion of prices and production, and on the position of small business,
has greatly increased.

Hand in hand with this has gone a tremendous increase in the
intervention of the government in the economy. This intervention,
whose primary aim is the protection of monopoly proﬁts, today pene-

' trates every aspect of our economic life. Huge government expendi-

tures, chieﬂy for military purposes, government subsidies, guaranteed
markets, stock-piling, tax write—offs and give-aways—~—all these have in
turn had far—reaching effects on the role of taxation, government debt
and monetary policies. Government economic intervention has been
a contributing factor also in the unequaled rise in the volume of
private debt and particularly in the enhanced role of consumer credit
in the economy. .

Another important feature is the new wave of technological
advances, particularly the development of automation, which has not
only greatly increased productivity, but has also begun to affect pro-
foundly the composition of the labor force, the role of skilled labor,

and the growing shift in employment from manufacturing to service
occupations. And these effects will be vastly increased once the tre-
mendous potential of the peace—time harnessing of atomic energy
begins to make itself felt.

An especially significant new development is the impact of a
greatly expanded socialist world on our economy. Particularly im-
portant is the peaceful competitive bid of the socialist countries for
world markets, and their growing ability to offer underdeveloped
countries a source of capital goods independent of the imperialist na-
tions. Also of great signiﬁcance is the potential role of uninhibited
trade between the capitalist and socialist worlds.

There are also certain special characteristics of the American
economy—for examp-le, the exceptionally prominent part played by
the production and sale of consumer durable goods, notably the auto-
mobile—which require examination.

Finally, there are certain long-unresolved theoretical questions,
such as the operation in this country of Marx’s law of the impoverish-
ment of the working class, or the operation of the law of value under
monopoly conditions, which demand answers with growing in-
sistence.

The failure adequately to study these new and special features
is a major cause of economic errors which we have committed in
recent years.

A most important factor on today’s economic scene is the ex-
istence of a greatly strengthened, more uniﬁed labor movement,
whose power has been enhanced especially by the AFL-CIO merger.
Labor has won signiﬁcant economic gains during the postwar years,
among them a virtually uninterrupted series of annual wage increases.

But today labor faces new and more acute problems. Though
production has risen during the past few years, factory employment
has fallen off. Among industrial workers, there is a growing sense of
job insecurity and mounting pressure for the thirty-hour week with-
out reduction in take—home pay. There are intensiﬁed problems of
speed-up and worsened working conditions. In many industries the
runaway shop evil is reaching more and more serious proportions.

Organized labor has developed an extensive economic program to
combat poverty and depression. Included in it are demands for higher
wages, an end to discrimination in employment and pay, a shorter
work week without reduction in pay, a reduced burden of taxes on

9

low-income groups, increases in the minimum wage, in unemploy-
ment compensation and in social security beneﬁts generally, large-
scale public works, and aid to small business and farmers. In addition,
labor has sharply demanded government investigation of monopoly
prices and proﬁts. ,

We Communists endorse and support the forward—looking pro-
posals of the labor movement and other democratic organizations for
economic betterment and social welfare. It is through the develop-
ent of a united movement behind such a program that the American
people can advance their economic welfare against the encroachment
of the trusts.

We urge, on our part, a peace-time economic program which in-
cludes:

I. All necessary measures for the defense of the economic condi-
tions of the working people against the destructive effects of eco-
nomic crisis;

2. Reduction of arms spending, together with other measures
to combat inﬂation;

3. A program on a grand scale for development of public water
power, ﬂood control and conservation projects, as well as the building
of highways, schools, housing and other vital public works;

4. A positive world economic role, with the provision of real
economic aid—not arms—to underdeveloped countries, and with the
restoration and expansion of East-West trade;

5. Large—scale economic development of underdeveloped areas in
our own country——notably the South;

6. Defense and extension of national property——-forests, oil and
other natural resources, as well as atomic energy installations—-against
the inroads of monopoly.

The age of automation and the atom, with its great promise,
stands in glaring contradiction to widespread poverty, to inadequate
educational and health facilities, and to growing insecurity and fear
of the future. But to fulﬁll the promise of plenty which automation
and atomic energy hold forth will require concerted struggle by labor
and its allies against the big monopolies. In the course of such strug-
gles, if Communists and other socialist—minded Americans work ef-
fectively, the working people of this country can achieve a fuller
understanding of the need for a socialist economy as the only basic
answer to their problems.

For Peacefu|,Coexis’rence and an End fo fhe Cold War

Having lived for a decade under threat of atomic war, the
American people, like peoples everywhere, deeply desire to enjoy in
peace the great beneﬁts which they rightfully demand of the coming
atomic age.

Soon after World War II, the giant corporations which dominate
American political and economic life set about trying to extend their
domination to the rest of the world. They caused our government to
scrap FDR’s policy of American—Soviet friendship and Big Three
unity for peace. They also brought about the scuttling of F DR’s “good
neighbor” policy in_Latin America, which, despite serious limitations,
had curbed aggressive intervention and developed better relations
with the peoples of that area. Acting through the Truman and Eisen-
hower Administrations, the economic royalists replaced these policies
with one of atom—bomb diplomacy, military alliances, war bases, and
active intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. Under
the pretext of “defense” against a mythical “Soviet menace” they
built up a very profitable arms economy at home.

This policy had its domestic counterpart in the smog of intimida-
tion and conformity that polluted American life, in the persecutions,
repressions and witchhunts that steadily eroded the Bill of Rights.
The pail of McCarthyism grew until it threatened to blot out Ameri-
can liberties.

Over the years Wall Street’s war—like, anti—American policy suf-
fered one setback after another. Our country became isolated, its good
name dishonored. Aggressive acts and threats of “massive retaliation”
precipitated differences with our “allies.” The newly independent na-
tions of Asia refused to toe the State Department and Pentagon line.
A great people’s peace movement embracing hundreds of millions
all over the world, insisted on an end to the cold war and the settle-
ment of differences through negotiations. The Soviet Union refused
to behave in accordance with the myth of “Soviet aggression,” and
instead the socialist countries directed all their efforts toward prevent-
ing war and achieving peaceful coexistence.

The growing crisis in American foreign policy ﬁnally reached the
point where in Iuly 1955, the Eisenhower Administration was com-
pelled to drop its opposition to great power negotiations, meet with
the Soviet Union at Geneva, and formally renounce the use of force
to resolve differences.

II

The changed world situation, symbolized by Geneva, came about
because the American people, no less ﬁrmly than other peoples, re-
fused to accept the prospect of atomic annihilation. In 1952 they elected

 

Eisenhower on the strength of his pledge to stop the war in Korea;.

in 1954 they vetoed Nixon’s plan to use American troops in Indochina;
in 1955 they quashed the Dulles—Radford provocations around Que-
moy and Matsu.

And Geneva was also made possible because the American people
refused to bow to McCarthyism, but instead, through their struggles
in 1953 and 1954, administered serious defeats to the McCarthyites and
began the still incomplete process of restoring the Bill of Rights.

Now there has come into being a vast “zone of peace,” embracing
socialist and non—socialist peace—seeking states populated by well over
half the human race. And this “zone of peace” may also be said to
include the peoples of all other countries irrespective of the policies
of their governments.

This situation has opened up the prospect of bringing the cold
war to an end and ushering in a new era of peaceful coexistence and
competition of different social systems.

The realization of such a perspective necessarily involves intense
and protracted struggles on the part of all peace forces. For We live
in the epoch of imperialism and imperialism breeds the danger of
world war. The imperialists will never voluntarily accept peaceful
coexistence. It must be imposed upon them by the organized
pressure of the peace forces. These forces are growing stronger, where-
as the imperialists are being weakened.

While the heightened tensions caused by the imperialist aggres-
sion against Egypt and by the events in Hungary are beginning to
abate, these developments sharply emphasize three fundamental con—
siderations:

I. A successful struggle for peaceful coexistence requires that we
be on guard against certain illusions and distortions that tend to
grow up around this perspective. These include the false conceptions
that peaceful coexistence is already assured or that it will come about
automatically; or that temporary setbacks and periods of heightened
tension are henceforth excluded. Above all, this perspective does not
in any way imply a freezing of the status quo in regard to social and
national liberation. On the contrary, it facilitates the struggle of the

I2

 

peoples to realize their aspirations for social change and national
independence.

2. Far from invalidating the perspective of peaceful coexistence,
these developments demonstrate anew the real relationship of forces
upon which this perspective rests. For, while the imperialists were
able to launch the aggression against Egypt, the strength of the peace
forces—the Soviet Union, China, the people’s democracies, the Ban-
dung nations, as well as the peace sentiments of the people of the
United States and other major capitalist countries——was able to stop
it quickly. And while the imperialists intervened in the Hungarian
tragedy, they did not dare to make it the occasion for open 1arge—scale
military intervention.

3. At the same time, while the outcome of these events conﬁrm
the perspective, they are a grimreminder that the imperialists have not
reconciled themselves to the relationship of forces which makes this
perspective possible. While they dare not under present circumstances
launch any general war, they seek\ constantly to change this relation-
ship of world forces. This they do by various means and especially
by attempting to split the socialist world or undermine the countries
of socialism. T

Thus the events in Egypt and Hungary conﬁrm the perspective set »

forth in the Draft Resolution. At the same time they lead to a deeper
and more complete understanding of the conditions under which the
struggle must be waged if this perspective is to be realized.

The basic factors that brought Eisenhower to the Summit meeting
are today stronger than ever. They make possible a successful strug-
gle to defeat the present effort of American imperialism to exploit
certain temporary difficulties in the socialist world in order to heat up
the cold war.

Scrapping his election—eve pledge of no military involvement in
Egypt, Eisenhower has opened a campaign to win popular backing
for Wall Street’s policy of taking over the Middle East from the Weak—
ened British and French imperialists. This is the essence of the Eisen-
hower—Dulles doctrine. ‘

The American people are increasinglyiexpressing their opposition
to this new colonialist venture as a threat to peace.

The foreign policy debate continues amidst much confusion, shift-
ing and partisan maneuvering. Among the trends reﬂected are in broad
outline the following: A

A. Certain of the most reactionary ﬁnancial and political circles

I3

 

openly oppose Geneva and ﬂatly reject peaceful negotiations, trade,
and coexistence, especially with China. They want to heat up the cold
war and compel the “allies,” the neutrals and the UN to toe the line.
Their ultimate aim is a fascist Fortress America, equipped with over-
whelming superiority in air—atomic arms. In its crudest form this is the
view of the McCarthy—Ienner—Eastland forces and in a more reﬁned
form, of Knowland and of Nixon. It inﬂuences some of the Dulles
bluﬁ‘—and-bluster policies. Its virulent anti—Sovietism ﬁnds an echo in
the utterances of a number of leading Democrats.

B. The predominant Wall Street forces, whose policies are re—
ﬂected in the Eisenhower wing of the GOP and most of the Democratic
leadership, favor a continuation of the main features of the cold war——
especially the arms budgets, NATO and the like. At present, they are
attempting to exploit the events in Hungary to intensify the cold
war. With varying emphasis they call for greater flexibility in relations
with the “allies” and neutrals. Along with the Eisenhower Doctrine,
they are putting more stress on the economic and ideological aspects
of the international struggle. This does not exclude negotiating some
partial steps to disarmament.

C. Some spokesmen for Big Business (Lippmann, Eaton, Flanders,
Bowles) appear to go farther. They put their main stress on the shift
to economic competition and Point 4, while advocating the retention
of the arms budget. They favor increased trade and exchange, and
continued efforts to achieve some progress towards disarmament.

Our general outlook towards the struggle for peace can be summed
up as follows:

War is not inevitable, though the danger still exists. Imperialism
generates this danger, as shown again in the aggression against Egypt.
For the big trusts and corporations have not given up their aim of
world domination. The danger of another world war, however, has
considerably subsided. This remains the main feature of the post-
Geneva situation.

This feature can be a powerful stimulant to the people’s struggle
for peaceful coexistence and an end to the cold war. This struggle will
be accelerated, and the myth of the “Soyiet menace” further dissipated,
as our people come to understand the profound changes and correc-
tions of serious errors now taking place in the socialist countries. It
will be helped by the continuing Soviet peace initiatives as well as by
the progress being made in correcting past weaknesses and improving
relations with other countries. This is bound to exert a favorable inﬂu-

I4

 

./

ence on the attitude toward peaceful negotiations and coexistence in
labor and liberal ranks.

The immediate outlook in our country is for the further growth
of broad popular movements on speciﬁc peace issues. Inﬂuential groups
in labor, women’s, church, Negro, farm, youth and other organizations
are calling for concrete steps towards universal disarmament, especially
for banning A- and H—bomb tests and withdrawing all foreign troops
from all countries. There is growing opposition to the Eisenhower
Doctrine. These groups and other United Nations supporters are ask-
ing that that body be strengthened by the seating of People’s China.

The unprecedented rise of the Negro people’s movement is closely
linked with rising sympathy and support for the liberation struggles
of the colonial peoples in Africa and elsewhere.

In the labor movement there has been growing differentation on
foreign policy and peace within the past few years. On the one hand
certain national leaders have adopted an aggressive and rigid anti—co-
existence, anti—Geneva position. On the other hand, the sentiment of

- the majority of the rank and ﬁle has found expression in varying de-

gree in the position of other leaders of important international unions,
and in a number of trade union publications. These leaders and pub-
lications criticize -the more aggressive aspects of Washington’s foreign
policy and urge negotiations, curbing the A— and H-bombs, support
of anti—colonial struggles, expanded foreign economic aid and various
forms of peaceful competition with the lands of socialism.

There is growing concern in the labor movement on the question
of economic aid torunderdeveloped countries. In contrast to Meany’s
anti—coexistence position, Reuther’s Io-point program for aid envisages
joint action through the UN by the USA and USSR. Such proposals,
along with a program for expansion of East—West trade and exchange
of delegations, can win broad support in labor and liberal political
circles.

Such movements as these will bring to bear the inﬂuence of labor
and the other main sectors of the American people upon the foreign
and domestic policies of the new Administration and Congress. They
will help realize the new perspectives of peaceful coexistence.

II. THE PATH AHEAD

The principal obstacle to all advance of the American people to-
day, as in the past, is their traditional enemy: The Monopolies.
Blocking the path to the new great advances possible today stands
Big Business. The giant trusts through their control of the overwhelm-
ing majority of American production dominate the economic and
political life of our country. '

While Big Business has been increasing its domination of the
economic system in the postwar years, it is by no means inevitable
that it should continue having its way in the political life and direc-
tion of the country. The workers, farmers, Negro people, small busi-
nessmen and professionals, who suffer directly from the exploitation
and depredations of Big Business compose the overwhelming majority
of the American people. They have the potential political strength, if
united in a great coalition, to curb the power of Big Business far
more even than in the heyday of the New Deal.

The formation of an anti-monopoly coalition, led by labor, and the
election of an anti-monopoly coalition government which would ef-
fectively curb the power of Big Business is our main strategic aim in
the period ahead. The accomplishment of this aim will signify a new
stage in the relation of class forces. It will open the path to realization
of the American ideal of government of the people, by the people, for
the people.

Labor, the farmers, the Negro people, and small business are
already in actual struggle against the monopolies. Increasingly-
though still inadequately—they have been seeking and giving one an-
other mutual support. The idea long cultivated by monopoly propa-
ganda that the interests of these natural allies are contradictory has
been proved false.

Political cooperation based uponimutual economic interests and
interdependence between labor and the farmers has registered big
gains in the past period. In a number of states, such as North Dakota,
Iowa, Oregon, South Dakota and Montana, labor-farmer cooperation
has been maturing rapidly. The main joint effort has been to defeat

16

 

 

/

the “right—to—work” laws menacing labor and to support the farmers’
demands for full parity. In such industries as farm equipment and
meat packing, labor and farmers have made common cause against the
squeeze of the trusts.

The labor-Negro alliance, despite certain strains, remains a foun-
dation stone of the people’s strength. A million and a half Negro
workers belong to the trade unions, and the Negro people refuse to be
moved from their support of trade unionism. On the other hand,
labor gives a growing measure of support to the struggles of the
Negro people, and tens of thousands of trade unionists are members
of the NAACP.

So far, however, the struggles of these great popular forces are
not united. They remain only at the stage of limited mutual support.
Yet labor, the farmers and the Negro people, together with the small
business people and professionals, constitute the actual majority of
the American people. The central task facing the American people in
their struggle against the giant force of monopoly is to bring about
great unity of action in the struggle for their common objectives.

In the co-urse of the struggle for these objectives the forces of the
people could develop their common action and move towards the
formation of an anti—monopoly coalition strong enough to curb the
power of the monopolies by effectively resisting their offensive and
enacting measures:

a) To establish the sovereignty of the Nation over its most vital
facilities;

b) To limit the economic concentration and power of the trusts;

c) To reduce their incredibly swollen share of the national
wealth. _

Common action could realize such demands already current in
the labor and people’s movements as:

a) Return the scandalous “give—aways” (Tidelands oil, etc.) to
the government;

b) Plug up the notorious loopholes in the income and corporate
tax structure through which the monopolies and their magnates evade
the major portion of their taxes; raise the capital gains tax and the
income tax in the higher brackets;

c) Enforce the anti—trust laws so that instead of being merely a
nuisance to the trusts and a bonanza for the legal ﬁrms, they function
as actual deterrents to monopoly proﬁteering and concentration;

17

 

d) Expose and prohibit the functioning of Big Business lobby-
ists in buying and dictating legislation in Congress;

e) Nationalize the atomic energy industry, and all public utili-
ties with full safeguards for the wages and conditions of the workers
as well as the right to organize and strike.

The historic struggle of the American people for public power
takes on wholly new dimensions today in the light of atomic energy.
This vast new source of power was developed out of the public re-
sources of the American people in wartime. It cannot be allowed to
remain a private domain of the trusts, subject to their notorious greed
and obstruction. The immense scope of this development, the inherent
dangers, and the widespread economic effects all require that it be
subjected to public control through the nationalization of the industry.
In recent months the AFL—CIO has been demanding the partial restora—
tion of public control over the peacetime use of atomic power.

Inevitably Labor, as the basic antagonist of Big Business in mod—
ern America, will prove to be the giant force around which all other
anti—monopoly elements will gravitate and to which they will look for
leadership. While such a perspective is not consciously recognized in
most sections of labor’s leadership, nevertheless, there is growing ap-
preciation of this outlook within its ranks, as well as among other
sections of the people. Over the past years labor has been playing
an increasing role in the life of the nation. With the recent AFL—CIO
merger it has placed itself in a position to play a still greater role.

The struggle to curb the monopolies cannot be properly devel-
oped unless the growing coalition also ﬁnds its way towards effective
political expression. In the course of the campaign to organize the
mass production industries, labor became increasingly aware of the
fact that the defense of the interests of the workers and of their unions
requires the extension of the struggle to legislative and political action.
This has become a permanent feature of the labor movement.

Independent political action of labor has been developing in vari-
ous forms. Such activity under the leadership of PAC, LLPE and
more recently the united body, COPE (Committee on Political Edu-
cation), as well as by unions directly, takes the form of national and
state legislative conferences, delegations to Washington and state capi-
tals, participation at important levels of the major political parties-—
in most cases the Democratic Party—and large scale electoral activity.
The recent regional conferences of COPE have initiated a new cam—

18

 

 

 

paign broader than ever before to secure registration by union mem-
bers and their families and to distribute millions of copies of the
voting records of Congressmen and Senators.

Most important, labor is taking steps in a number of places
(notably in Detroit) to organize its own congressional district struc-
ture. If developed more broadly, this would represent a qualitatively
new forward step on the road of independent political action.

Labor, the Negro people, the farmers and small business, as they
confront the bi—partisan maneuvering with their most essential de-
mands, are giving more and more thought to the problem of political
realignment. This is taking the form at present of a new re—grouping
of their forces to combat themost reactionary elements, in certain cases
within the GOP, but especially within the Democratic Party.

In Michigan, labor joined with liberal Democrats to oust the reac-
tionary old guard from control of the Democratic state machine. In
Texas labor joined with other popular forces, as well as conservatives,
to break the grip of the Shivers Dixiecrats on the state Democratic
Party. In Louisiana, labor, in parallel action with the Negro people
and other democratic forces, helped secure the defeat of the extreme
Dixiecrats and the partial repeal of the state “right—to—work” law.

It is out of‘ such experiences, developing in the states, that the
heightened consciousness of the need for political realignment will
grow. The situation varies greatly from state to state. The possibility
of the labor and popular forces gaining decisive inﬂuence in a number
of key Democratic Party state organizations in the future, coupled
with a growing collaboration of independent and liberal Republican
political movements, may determine the form in which a new anti-
monopoly party emerges. For in the long run the working class and its
allies will have to have their own anti—monopoly coalition party capa-
ble of bringing about the eventual election of a people’s anti-monopoly
government.

Among those who are seeking a political realignment, some see
the possibility of transforming the Democratic Party into such an anti-
monopoly coalition party. They believe it possible to oust the Dixie-
crats, break down the inﬂuence of Big Business, win over liberal Re-
publicans and establish a coalition leadership of labor, farmers, Negro
people and small business.

Some, on the contrary, see the Democratic Party nationally in-
evitably continuing under the control of Big Business, surrendering

I9

  

to or compromising with the Dixiecrats, vacillating or, retreating on
labor and other democratic issues. They believe this will make it
necessary for labor and its allies to break away in order to form a new
mass labor—farmer party. ,

It is wrong to assume that the only possible form of political
realignment is a labor—farmer party. This rigid assumption can only
serve to hamper the actual development of labor’s independent polit-
ical action. At the present moment the task of the progressives is not
to prejudge the form of the eventual political realignment. The ex-
pansion of labor’s independent political role and all serious efforts to
transform the Democratic Party by ousting the Dixiecrats and under-
mining the inﬂuence of Big Business, help create the pre—conditions

A for a new political alignment under labor’s leadership, whatever its

form. At the same time, the widest and most extensive education for
the formation of a new party led by labor facilitates labor’s current
struggle to inﬂuence the situation within the Democratic Party. For
it demonstrates that labor is not forever committed to the Democratic
Party and will eventually, in one way or another, build a new political
home for itself and its allies.

But irrespective of these viewpoints, the struggle to build the
people’s anti-monopoly coalition and to achieve its effective independ-
ent political expression must be carried forward. It must be carried
forward regardless of which major party controls the Administration
and Congress.

The signiﬁcance of the 1956 election is by no means limited to the
fact that the GOP lost the Congress and the Democrats lost the
Presidency. Beneath the surface were deep-going movements of labor,
the Negro people and the farmers which could ﬁnd expression only in
a limited, distorted way in the two-Party electoral battle.

The election outcome in a number of states, such as Michigan
and Washington, was inﬂuenced by a marked growth in labor’s polit-
ical activity, expressed especially in the work of COPE, although in
many other places labor continues to lag in political action.

Large sections of Negro voters moved into the Republican column
as a result of Democratic refusal to break with the Eastland Dixie-
crats.

The growth of labor-farmer collaboration in the farm and West-
ern states brought about the defeat of a number of reactionary Repub-
licans west of the Mississippi.

20

 

 

 

/

Labor faces new challenges and new opportunities. For the grow-
ing contradiction between pre—election promises and post—election
deeds, requires, as never before, the expansion into all areas of labor’s
independent political action.

While Eisenhower exploited to advantage the universal desire of
the people for peace, the Eisenhower Doctrine deeply disturbs wide sec.
tions in all walks.

While Eisenhower reaped a harvest of votes from amongst grow-
ing numbers who irecoil against the Dixiecrats, and who demand
100%, full coverage of the Constitution to the Negro people, his post-
election failure to tackle the South as the Nation’s number one prob-
lem of democracy gives rise to ever-growing dissatisfaction.

The Democrats captured both houses of Congress as a result,
among other things, of widespread dissatisfaction over GOP failures
to halt inﬂation and to lower taxes. The people now expect Congress
to deliver on long-deferred promises to cut taxes, curb high proﬁts
and high prices.

While labor defeated many anti—labor Congressmen, control of
Congress remains in the hands of the reactionary anti—labor bloc of
Dixiecrats and die—hard Republicans. It is this bloc which prevents
not only civil "rights legislation, but also legislation on wages and
hours, housing, health, taxation, federal aid to education, public power,
social security, anything of an advanced or progressive nature. It is
this bloc which upholds Taft-Hartley, the Smith and McCarran Acts,
the “right to Work” laws, the Un—American Committees.

It is this bloc which promotes the cold war and aggressive foreign
policies.

It is this bloc which keeps the South unorganized and at the
mercy of the Eastlands. This bloc is the guarantee of Dixiecrat mino-
rity rule in the Congress and hence in the nation. It is this bloc which
is the means whereby the two-Party system at present affects the will
of the reactionary imperialists. The Dixiecrats are the weakest, most
vulnerable section of this bloc, the most obvious and immediate ene—
mics of labor and the Negro people,

It is this bloc which has launched new and menacing anti—labor
“investigations” parallelling dangerous Taft-Hartley persecutions un-
der the Justice Department, confronting the labor movement with the
need for a new initiative in defense of its gains and of democratic
rights generally.

21

  

The 1956 elections and developments in Congress since then have
raised more sharply than ever the need to oust the Dixiecrats, the need
for a new political realignment. More and more do events of the day
impel the labor movement to take commanding positions in the great
endeavor for political realignment.

But to be successful in this historic struggle for realignment, it
becomes necessary for labor, in collaboration with the Negro people
and farmers, to develop an independent program, an independent
policy, an independent position, which is advanced both within the
two—Party arena of struggle, in the Democratic Party in particular,
as well as outside it, through labor’s own, independent political organ-
ization.

Hand in hand with the development of a people’s anti-monopoly
coalition, and indispensable to it as its chief dynamo, the emergence
of the American u/or/{in g class at long last as an independent political
force in the life of our nation stands out as an historic task on which
depends the further social progress of our country.

There are growing signs that awareness of this great need is
developing in the labor movement. A decade ago the voice which
called for a conference of labor, the Negro people and other forces to
formulate and advance an independent people’s program for the coun-
try was a voice in the wilderness. Today, the number of unions call-
ing for such a conference is growing apace as the political necessities
become clearer and the need more evident.

Innumerable opportunities face the forces of labor and the people
to advance the anti-monopoly coalition and promote labor’s independ-
ent political role in the many local, state and national struggles that
are being waged on the community, shop, legislative and electoral
level, before, during and after the 1957 local and state elections.

If it is to advance, this struggle will also have to overcome a num-
ber of road blocks and bring about certain long overdue democratic
reforms. These are necessary to correct abuses which have developed
in our system of government and operate to thwart even that degree
of majority rule which is possible under the present political parties.

Outstanding among these reforms‘are:

a) Federal guarantee of the right to vote in all elections without
discrimination;

b) Abolition of the seniority system in Congressional commit-
tees;

22

 

 

 

c) Amendment of Senate Rule 22 so as to make possible the
ending of a ﬁlibuster;

d) Abolition of gerrymandering by state legislatures in laying
out the size and boundaries of Congressional districts, as well as in
representation to state legislatures, in order to correct inequities in
representation as between urban and rural areas and to assure the right
of the Negro people to full representation;

e) Abolition of the electoral college and election of the President
by direct popular vote.

f) Elimination of legal obstacles to placing minority parties and
independent candidates on the ballot; adoption of proportional repre-
sentation;

g) Introduction in all states of initiative, referendum and recall.

The struggle to bring about a political realignment, based on the
formation and election to power of an anti—monopoly coalition led by
labor, is the great strategic task of the next stage in the democratic and
social advance of the American people. It is the giant corporations
which block the path to economic progress, civil rights, fuller de-
mocracy and durable peace. It is their challenge that must be met by
the American people as they carry forward their struggle under the
new conditions, of today.

Many questions of the content of the anti—monopoly coalition, and
especially of labor’s role in relation to it, remain unanswered. In order
for our Party to make its maximum contribution towards helping the
labor movement emerge as an independent political force and thereby
promote the progress of the anti—monopoly coalition, it is necessary to
determine the present level of development of the working class as
distinguished from the ’3o’s and ’4o’s; the character of its labor move-
ment; its present-day program; the direction in which it is moving;
the chief ideological questions confronting it; how it can develop
heightened political consciousness in the course of economic and other
struggles, and many other questions.

Towards this end, the National Committee shall organize a series
of regional conferences bringing together National Committee mem-
bers and representative groups of industrial workers for a common
searching into these matters, on the basis of which it shall organize
either an extraordinary national conference or a special enlarged
National Committee meeting devoted to working out and resolving
these problems in their most essential basic aspects.

Ill. COMMUNISTS AND THE LABOR N1OVEMENT*

The merger of the AFL and the CIO has greatly increased the

strength of the organized working men and women of this country.’

This movement of 18 million workers has great power to advance the

economic interests of themselves and their families, and, if properly .

employed, great power to stand at the head of a people’s movement
for the defeat of the reactionary policies of the big monopolies and for
taking the high road to a better life for the American people.

Labor is displaying new vigor in economic struggles. Its growing
maturity is expressed in its increased concern for demands and issues
presented by other sections of the population. Labor forces interest
themselves in community relations of all kinds and are beginning to
form alliances with other sections of the population—both for labor’s
program- and also for a people’s program.

While these 18 million organized workers today constitute a
greater numerical force than the eight million of the I93o’s, they did
not grow up in the same experiences of class struggle. The workers in
the ’3o’s went through the great unemployed struggles. They knew
the open shops and they learned the lessons of class struggle in the bit-
ter battles to organize the mass production industries. For many work-
ers today, union membership is often little more than a condition of
employment.

The chief antagonists of labor, the monopolies, strengthened by
grabbing imperialist super-proﬁts, have also increased their power, by
forming new mergers and more powerful combines, by the Cadillac
Cabinet’s anti-labor orientation, by their stranglehold on the economic
life of the country. Because they fear the growing strength of the
labor movement and its new alliances and community responsibility,
they will continue to try to cripple labor’s economic and political
activity through anti—labor legislation‘(the Taft—Hartley law, “right to
work” laws), through monopoly—dorninated government agencies, and
legislation restricting labor’s political rights. They carry on a battle

of ideas directed toward “brainwashing” the class feelings out of the
workers on the one hand, while on the other they attempt to arouse
the hostility of non-labor sections of the public against trade unions.
In the name of combatting inﬂation, they are getting ready to resist
the continuing wage demands of the workers.

The ﬁght for a higher standard of living is at the heart of the
everyday existence of the trade unions. Insecurity casts its shadow
over the present “prosperity.” The people are loaded down with in-
stallment and mortgage debts. Between two and three millions of
workers are totally unemployed. Millions more cannot get a full
week’s work, and there are “pockets of unemployment,” areas where
joblessness has become critical and lasting. Compounding all this is
the fear that the advance of automation will cost the jobs of millions
more. I

Automation is leading to increased productivity and the begin-
nings today of the displacement of labor. Workers everywhere are
uneasy about the future of their job-s. Herbert Hoover, Secretary
Humphrey, James Carey, have all expressed their concern about the
possibility of an economic setback. This has created demands among
the workers for a program of job security, involving GAW, much
larger pensions and severance pay programs and a deep concern for
job security in terms of the entire economy. I

The employers count on day—to—day introduction of speedup, cut-
ting of rates, cutting of crews and other devices to increase the ex-
ploitation of the workers. The workers are correctly not limiting the
struggle in the shop-s to the once-in-three years contract struggle. In
the basic industries, in the auto shops, in the steel mills, the ﬁght
against such grievances is the heart of union activity as the workers
see it. It reﬂects the class struggle at its roots.

The American workers are not taking all this lying down. They
are aggressively advancing new demands: annual wages, supplement-
ary unemployment beneﬁts, the shorter work week, new sights on
health and welfare, pensions and severance pay.

The search by labor for more lasting answers to these problems

A is giving rise to a variety of proposals. The sum total of many of these

could comprise a program of action. Some of the main points are:

1) Further Development of Trade Union Unity. The advances
towards eliminating jurisdictional quarrels and craft-industrial diEer-
ences, the merger of a few international unions, important progress in

25

  

state mergers, examples of joint organizing and negotiating activity-
these meet with hearty app-roval by the workers. They feel that un-
resolved problems must not be permitted to prevent united activity.

There is a growing consciousness that Negro-white unity is the
bedrock for the advance of the whole labor movement. Every blow
aiding the elimination of discrimination strengthens unity.

All—embracing unity requires tackling in a similar spirit the spe-
cial problems of skilled workers. It requires an app-reciation of the
need for united action with a large segment of workers in independent
unions. Attention is also needed for the problems of women and
young workers who play a decisive role in many industries and yet
do not take their proper role in the life of the unions.

The racketeering, gangsterism and undemocratic practices plagu-
ing some sections of labor stand astride the path of unity. Doing in-
jury to labor’s reputation with the general public, they retard the
formation of a coalition of labor and its allies. We greet the new de-
termination on the part of the labor movement to cut out this mal-
ignancy as shown in proceedings initiated by the Ethical Practices
Committee of AFL—CIO. At the same time, there is a grave danger
for the rights of all labor in the decision of the AFL—CIO policy state-
ment recommending removal of trade union leaders who use the
Fifth Amendment in investigations before Congressional Commit-
tees. For while the workers correctly wish to curb and end racketeer-
ing in unions, it is a serious mistake and harmful to deprive labor of
its constitutional rights and thereby to deprive it of the means of de-
fense against witchhunting and labor-busting employers and their
stooges in Washington.

There are a number of practical tasks which can help develop
unity. Common programs can be worked out among competing unions
for organization of the unorganized particularly in the South. Ioint
conference board meetings can be held of unions organized in the
same chain. Joint negotiations can take place where more than one
union has a contract with a single employer. Such steps, for which
there is already some experience, would in a practical way contribute
to solidifying trade union unity. ~

In addition there are the contributions that can be made to over-
come the obstacles to the merger of the city and state federations; the
move to encourage the amalgamation of unions in any single industry
and ﬁnally unity and parallel action of all kinds on all issues that ad-
vance labor’s interests. ’

2) Organization of the Unorganized. Millions of workers are
in the open shops. The non—union low—p-aying shops of the South
stand as a threat to the wage standards of organized workers. The
South is also the source of much of the anti-labor legislation and of
the so-called “right to work” laws. The South, with its jimcrow sys—
tem rivets reactionary monopoly domination upon the whole country.

Organizing the unorganized in the South would bring in its train as

whole fresh democratic upsurge in the country. Yet the job has not
been begun in spite of many declarations by the leaders of AFL—CIO.

The recent decision of the AFL—CIO to launch a mass organizing
drive of non-production workers in industry is a necessary task and
possible of achievement. But it cannot be regarded as a substitute for
the decisive task of organizing the unorganized in the South.

3) T/ze Demand for the S/zorter Work Week. More and more
unions are placing this demand for a shorter work week with no
reduction in pay as their chief answer to the problems of insecurity
and of advancing automation.

Big Business with its false propaganda that automation will in-
crease the number of jobs, and that the country faces a “labor short-
age” in the period ahead, is preparing to do battle against this demand.
Conscious of the fundamental nature of this demand especially in a
period of economic instability and the rise of a radically new tech-
nology, Communists give their wholehearted support to its realiza-
tion through economic and political action.

4) Extension of Alliance: Between Labor and Its Allies. Unions
have begun more and more to participate in the struggles of the Negro
people and the farmers. There is an increasing recognition that their
ability to achieve trade union objectives is bound up with the struggle
of all democratic forces in the country. The expansion of cooperation
between labor and these groups, the increased activity of the unions
on Education, Health, Civil Rights and other questions, will bring
closer the realization of a people’s coalition.

5) Greater Independent Political Activity. The uniﬁcation of
labor has given a new quality to its political activity. COPE’s political
activity has helped to produce a more independent and outspokenly
critical attitude, and has increased labor’s inﬂuence in the Democratic
Party. The growth of this influence on the part of labor was observed
in the recent period in the role of the UAW in Michigan and in the
inﬂuence of organized labor in the California Democratic Party organ-

O MAIN POLITICAL
  RESOLUTION

adopted by the

‘16th ANNUAL CONVENTION

‘of the COMMUNIST PARTY, M U. S. A.

ization. A minor but noteworthy fact too is that a few prominent labor
leaders have recently made reference to the possibility of a new party
to be led by labor. More decisive participation on the part of the 18
million organized workers and their families, more energetic inter-
vention by the unions in political life, is the prime requisite for creat-
ing a new political alignment in the country, through which labor, the
farmers and the Negro people will best beat back the monopolists and
lay the basis for a better America.

In this connection, labor can most effectively develop its independ-
ent political activity by involving the membership of the unions in
support of the legislative program of AFL—CIO, around questions of
anti—labor legislation, such as the state “right to work” laws, state
legislation of supplementary unemployment benefits and increase of
beneﬁts, the struggle for tax reduction, etc.

6) Towards Peace in the World and a Peace—tz'me Economy.
There is a wholesome debate in the labor movement on foreign policy.
It reﬂects the pressure of the workers’ desire for lasting peace and
secure peace—time jobs as against those in the labor leadership who go
along with Dulles’ Big Business foreign policy. Proposals and actions
from some international unions around an “Atoms for Peace” pro-
gram, economic aid (without strings) to underdeveloped countries,
for peaceful competitive coexistence, banning of A- and H—bomb tests,
and an end to the threat of atomic war——these represent a response to
the workers’ sentiments. However, this is not the dominant trend.
What is dominant in the AFL—CIO leadership is a trend bitterly
hostile to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This infects
their attitude on all aspects of foreign policy and runs contrary to the
desire for peace of their own members and the public at large. This
dominant trend equates negotiations with “appeasement,” keeps an
iron curtain between workers of our country and workers of socialist
lands and rejects the possibility of peaceful coexistence.

‘Under the hammering of the debate, under the inﬂuence of the
Geneva Conference, under the impact of the membership’s desire for
peace, the cold war outlook was corrgpelled to give some ground. How-
ever, the drive of the State Department to give support to the move-
ment to overthrow socialist governments, to put across the Eisenhower
Doctrine for intervention in the Mid—East and to attempt a general re-
treat back to the cold war, has had an effect on some of the leaders
of the labor movement. Some of them have joined the campaign for

28

 

 

so-called “liberation.” In spite of these negative developments, the
workers’ desire for peace can restore the movement for peaceful coex-
istence on the basis of the positions already taken by AFL—CIO and
many of its aﬁiliates.

There is a basis for such a movement among workers. It lies in
their fear that the Eisenhower Doctrine may lead to a new Korea in
the Middle East. It lies in their concern about not getting involved in
the internal struggles of Eastern Europe to the point of world war.
It lies also in the fact that some unions have called for limiting arma-
ments and ending H—bomb tests. It can be developed on the basis of
workers’ fear of the economic and social consequences of the war pro-
gram, such as the high taxes. A movement based on the above can set
roadblocks in the path of the Wall Street war makers and open the
road to a second Geneva.

7) Trade Union Democracy. In the course of the past two
decades, a vast trade union structure has developed which tends to
exclude the rank and ﬁle from the affairs of the union and in defense
of their day-to—day shop conditions. Contracts, once relatively simple,
are now replete with hundreds of complicated, procedural, delaying
clauses, particularly those dealing with the grievance procedure. Com-
pany security clauses, penalization clauses, long term contracts, union
time study “experts” who do not oppose company production stand-
ards—all make it more diﬂicult for the workers to carry on the daily
struggle in the shop.

As a result, the full ﬁghting strength of the union is not mobilized
in forcing the company to improve conditions within the shop. Faced
with piling up of grievances and increased exploitation, the workers
in many shops are now searching out ways to rally and to ﬁght the
companies in spite of these restricting inﬂuences. All this forces the
workers to struggle for greater participation in the affairs of the union.
It forces them to search for new ways to utilize the union machinery
for their struggle against the companies. The recent “raise in dues”
and election struggles in Steel bear this out. The struggle to increase
trade union democracy by the greatest participation of the rank and
ﬁle is a decisive prerequisite for further substantial advance by the
trade union movement.

Such is the general outline of a long range program shaping up
out of the economic and political facts of life pressing upon the labor
movement. One cannot say, however, that there exists any wide

29

   

recognition that the acceptance of this program and its implementa-
tion, would make the trade union movement the leading component of
the people’s anti—monopoly coalition. This important ingredient of
understanding has as yet not developed. A

We of the Communist Party will do our best to contribute to the
clearest grasp of these questions. We will do our utmost, side by side
with the workers, to help achieve the successful outcome of these new
undertakings by our participation in struggles and by helping to
give them a conscious direction and purpose.

The Communist Party has made signiﬁcant contributions to
labor’s history. Communists pioneered for industrial unionism and or-
ganization of the unorganized in basic industry. Unemployment insur-
ance was once called “red” because Communists ﬁrst fought for
it. To many hard—fought strikes the Communists contributed support
and leadership. Long before the labor movement achieved its present
stature, Communists urged independent political action, unity of
labor, unity of Negro and white. We always stressed the common in-
terests of the workers of all countries and the need to unite for their
common goals. These ideas and proposals played a part in the forma-
tion and growth of CIO, and in the forward movement of AFL. Mil-
lions of workers tested in life many of the ideas and slogans ﬁrst
advanced by the Communists. This has been a recognized contribu-
tion of the Communist Party to labor.

At the close of World War II American Big Business thought it
had its golden opportunity to boss the world and beat down the work-
ers at home. The American workers fought back in a tremendous
wave of successful postwar strikes.

But Big Business achieved some sinister successes. They were able
to put over the idea of imminent “Soviet aggression” and “subver-
sion” as a cover—up for their own aggressive schemes. With the hys-
teria-rnills working full blast, they began to weaken labor militancy
and unity by stimulating attacks on Communists and Left-progressive
workers. This made it easier for them to put across their anti-labor
legislation. *

It was a service to the labor movement and the American people
that we Communists exposed and gave Warning of the real objectives
of Big Business. Yet We recognize that in exposing these real aims,
in trying to help the labor movement to ﬁght back, We Communists
made some serious and harmful mistakes. The leadership of the Party

30

 

 

 

was mostly responsible for these errors and often imposed them over
the resistance of the Party membership in industry.

In spite of our long years of participation in the leadership of
outstanding economic struggles, we failed to remember that the unions
are in the first place organizations dedicated to the improvement of
economic conditions. We assumed that the political questions most
important in our minds were most immediate in the minds of the
workers. We failed ‘patiently to make clear the connections between
the day—to-day struggle of the workers and these same issues.

In pursuing this attitude, we exaggerated our inﬂuence and sup-
port. We did not realize that a union might elect some Left forces to
the leadership without being a Left union. In the diﬂicult postwar
period many important labor leaders, with whom we had worked
harmoniously, began to go along with many phases of the Govern-
ment—Big Business foreign policy outlook. They inﬂuenced the big
majority of the unions’ membership in the same direction.

With our somewhat inﬂated estimates of our base, we proved in-
ﬂexible when the times called for ﬂexibility in tactics. On too many
occasions when ruptures had become probable, we helped to make
them inevitable.

The expulsion of the p-rogressive—led unions from C.I.O., for ex-
ample, Was part of an organized campaign led by certain labor leaders
with the app-roval, if not under the direct instigation of the State De-
partment, to split the trade union movement and guarantee support
to the cold war. As correct as was our struggle for peace and independ-
ent political action, our inflexible insistence on the adoption of a
third party perspective and a condemnation of the Marshall Plan
facilitated the objectives of the cold war splitters.

For their part, the p-rogressive—led unions fought bravely and well.
Despite the violence of the attacks against them, their ﬁght for policies
of peace, civil liberties and civil rights, and on economic questions,
gave heart» to many workers, and stirred other sections of labor. Un-
fortunately, within these unions the struggle to re-unite the labor
movement—a demand getting increasing response from the workers
+did not command the same energetic attention. The split took its
deadly toll.

We Communists failed to pursue policies after the expulsion: that
could have led in the least possible time to re-uniﬁcation.

The workers then, as now, faced harsh and immediate economic

31

  

 

problems. Here above all was the basis for a ﬁght on our part for con-
tinuing class relations with masses of workers. This would have favor-
ably inﬂuenced eiforts to continue a minimum united front even with
the leadership. I

The kind of mistakes we have been discussing are left-sectarian
errors. These mistakes were reflected generally and did injury to the
ﬁne tradition of our Party as the outstanding advocate of trade union
unity.

In this postwar period, our thoughts, interests and concern began
to center around those in the labor movement who agreed with our
point of view, rather than on the essential but inﬁnitely more diﬂicult
task of resolutely ﬁghting to unite all labor to meet employer attacks.
While we were quite correctly concerned with the most dynamic sec-
tion of labor—the CIO—our concern got to be one—sided. In fact, We
ignored a consideration of the problems of the majority of the work-
ers in the AFL. This was particularly true after the unjustiﬁed expul-
sion of the progressive-led unions from the C10 in 1949.

After the 1952 elections, as demands for unity became more in-
tense, our Party more energetically called for united labor action as a
step in the direction of labor unity. This call, valid as it was, neverthe-
less did not measure up to what was needed. Hobbled by our estimate
of the political situation and our evaluation of the trade union leader-
ship, our call for united action was in effect suggesting a pre-unity
“trial period” which workers felt had long since passed. In the absence
of a real and sustained ﬁght for trade union unity, many comrades in
the Party were unprepared for the rapidity with which organic unity
was achieved between the AFL and the CIO. A few even felt that this
was in fact a State Department “plot,” not warranting our support.
Hence, as a consequence of our back—sliding on this question, the
Communists, the traditional and most forceful proponents of such
unity, had little to contribute to realize the full potential of organic
unity when the merger of AFL and CIO ﬁnally came about.

As a result of the postwar attacks, taken together with our own
errors, the Party today does not have the inﬂuence among workers it
had in past years. Today, some union leaders feel called upon to vie
with each other in expressing their opposition to the Party and Com-
munism. Innumerable constitutional provisions bar Communists from
membership or from holding oﬂ-ice in many unions. There is a fear
among many workers to knowingly associate with us. In spite of this,

33

 

 

 

5-0 'm‘<i3('b‘<

there have been some changes taking place in the most recent period.
The casing of tensions on a world scale as well as the correction and
overcoming of a number of the fore-mentioned errors, is making it pos-
sible for Communist workers to participate on a more normal basis
in the trade union activity of their shops and local unions. In some
instances, new coalitions, including workers long known as Left—wing-
ers, have been formed. This trend towards fuller unity, especially at
the local union level, has been growing. While this is true, the ab-
normal and harmful attitude towards the Communist Party as such on
the part of the labor leadership and most workers, still prevails. This is
of no help to the labor movement itself.

An examination of the work of our Party in the last period shows
that we have a considerable distance to go to eliminate the mistakes
of the past. These errors are the responsibility of the Party leadership.
They penetrated deep into the organization. Therefore, many hang-
overs of the past still remain. We particularly need a ﬁrmer effort to
eliminate sectarian “oppositionist” policies not based on program,
and to develop a clearer understanding for ourselves and others on
the relationships between the Party and the trade unions. We have
been very slow to overcome our errors in the ﬁeld of trade union
policy. This only emphasizes the need for closer relations between the
Party leadership and the workers in our Party. The experience of
these comrades emphasizes that the main thing for the Party is work at
the shop level, that trade union work is above all shop work, con-
cern about what is happening in the departments, the grievances, the
thinking and discussion there, the problems of developing one’: base
there. It requires an end to the “departmentalization,” the separation
of industrial problems from the leading committees.

##’l=#

In this spirit we must examine the trends in the labor movement,
and the conceptions on which we have heretofore based our analysis.

We should free ourselves from the frozen “political labels” of
“left,” “right,” “center.” For some time now such characterizations
have not given a valid picture of what has actually been happening.
These conceptions were no longer levers of our understanding; we
failed to see, study and assess the new changes, the shifts, the differen-
tiations that were shattering all “compartments” and dissolving old
“labels.”

33

 

On this score there are profound lessons for us ir1 the merger
itself. The sharp diversity of views that existed prior to the merger,
and which still exists, was not an insurmountable barrier to uniﬁca-
tion and has not prevented the subsequent advance of unity. In rela-
tion to the struggle for Negro rights, the fact that there were what We
have called “left,” “right,” and “center” views, did not prevent the
merger convention from unanimously electing two Negro vice—presi-
dents. Therefore, the overwhelming unity of the most diverse elements
in labor is possible of achievement on decisive questions. The best way
to contribute to that unity is not to “pigeon—hole” the various forces,
but to see their many—sided character in relation to each speciﬁc issue.
Above all we must bear in mind that life and struggle compel
changes. The movements of the millions of workers, their growing
consciousness and will, are the primary force for welding the unity of
membership and leadership around the major tasks.

The use of old formulas led some progressives and some in our
own ranks to hold the opinion that the merger of leaderships of AFL
and CIO would result in nothing but a “reactionary combination.”
Those who came to such a conclusion took no account of the move-
ment of millions of workers, and what large numbers of them expected
and demanded of the merger.

Most of the trade union leaders in AFL—CIO are staunch defend-
ers of capitalism. This affects their view on all questions even though
they are often impelled by the offensive of the employers and the
struggle of the workers to oppose the capitalists. However, it causes
them to hesitate and backtrack even on slogans like that of the 30-hour
week. They tend in the direction of uncritical support of the Demo—
cratic Party.

Such trade unio-n leaders are caught in a contradiction between
their staunch support for capitalism and the need of the workers to
engage in sharp battle against the employers’ oﬂensives. Often the
leaders themselves are threatened with extinction b-y these offensives
against the unions. Therefore, to maintain themselves and to retain
their base, they must, often in spite ‘of themselves, engage in and lead
sharp struggles, however unwelcome such struggles may be to them.

But this in itself further conﬁrms the idea that the corporations,
and not these trade union leaders, are the main enemy against whom
the main blow must be struck. The path to victory lies in the fullest
mobilization of the rank and ﬁle on the main issues-—shop conditions,

34

 

 

civil rights, peace, independent political action—against the monopol—
ists and their political agents in Washington. On the basis of a full
mobilization on such issues will it be possible often to develop move-
ments including many reluctant leaders of the trade unions, who,
While they deplore class struggle, must at the same time retain their
connections with the workers. That is why freezing people into cate-
gories of “center” or “right” with the idea that they cannot be budged
into a position of struggle on concrete questions can prove—and has
proved——very harmful in developing the widest unity in the actual
course of the struggles of labor.

At the same time, one must take into account that when some of
these labor leaders, in the course of the struggle, take the side of the
employers on speciﬁc questions, such as speed-up in the mills or spon-
sorship of wage cuts, the consistent struggle against the employers
forces the rank and ﬁle into conﬂict with these trade union leaders.
This is true in principle of political questions as well, although there is
no movement of the rank and ﬁle to the same degree as on economic
questions. Failure to take note of this can lead to serious right oppor-
tunist errors and to isolation from the mass militant movement of the
rank and ﬁle against such leadership.

What is new, what is important, what must be seen for valid
judgment is that there is a great deal of ﬂuidity: the leadership do
not group themselves in identical fashion in relation to all questions.

Lines have not fully hardened, although certain general tendencies
seem apparent. Around most of the former CIO unions and some of
the AFL, there is developing a relatively more positive and militant
perspective. Among leaders of the Building Trades, the Teamsters
and some others, there is a more conservative trend and in some in-
stances, reactionary points of view. This latter trend has been the
major source of obstacles to the strengthening of the federation’s unity
and of continuing attacks on the industrial unions. Within this trend
are to be found the most conservative positions on the political ﬁeld,
and a “go slow” attitude towards the whole federation’s organizing
objectives. Thereby they inhibit the activity of the merged labor move-
ment and lessen its effectiveness.

Yet, as has been seen, on individual questions even some of these
leaders can be moved to proceed in unity with the majority of the
labor leadership.

On the grounds of such an estimate, which does not pre-fabricate

35

  

 

hard and fast lines of division, the signiﬁcance of the intervention of
the millions of members becomes overwhelming. That‘ intervention,
based on the workers’ desire to move ahead, can defeat any grouping
or trend within the federation that obstructs progress on speciﬁc issues.

What is new and different, corresponding to the new situation in
our country and the world, is that the defeat of any reactionary trend
and real advance in meeting unprecedented historic tasks, can only be
accomplished by the struggle for an alZ—embracz'n g unity around speci-
ﬁc issues, a struggle that can move even some of the most reluctant.
Such a unity cannot be achieved by continuing to think in old terms
and to judge the present positions of leaders by the use of old labels
of “left,” “right,” and “center.”

The most conscious, active and militant workers, including those
of socialist conviction, can add strength and consistency to the struggle
and gain strength and support themselves by virtue of their contribu—
tions. We believe and regard as vital that there will be a new and re-
vived Left in the American labor movement. It will emerge from
militant forces which exist and assert themselves primarily on ques-
tions of economic struggle and civil rights today in many unions.
Such a movement of the workers has not yet crystallized on other
political questions, such as foreign policy and safeguarding democracy
around which struggles will undoubtedly develop in the future. The
sharpening attacks by Big Business, the urgent need and advantages
for the working class of a policy of peaceful coexistence, we believe
will in time stimulate the emergence of a revived and revitalized Left
in this country, and it is the task of Communists to stimulate and en-
courage such a movement. ‘

The body of more than two million Negro unionists, now organ-
ized within the federation, constitutes a great power for furthering
the labor-Negro people’s alliance. They not only compel attention to
their economic demands as unionists, but also bring forward to labor
the struggles of their own people for elementary democratic and equal
rights. In so doing, these millions of Negro unionists give stability and
depth to the alliance. ‘

The southern organizing drive would be the single most power-
ful factor ir1 Welding the Negro—labor alliance in a common struggle
against the Dixiecrats, who are the main obstacle to the freedom of the
Negro people and the forgers of chains _for labor in the halls of

36

 

 

 

Congress and in the open shops of the South. The merger of these
two great struggles of our times into one great common battle would
mark the high point of the American pe0ple’s struggle for a better
America.

This developing Negro-labor alliance, however, has formidable
opponents within the labor movement. Except in the South, they dare
not now operate in broad daylight. But in large areas of the labor
movement the Negro is still barred, if not by regulation, then by cus-
tom or practice. The leading jimcrow “bitter-enders” in labor’s ranks
ﬁght policies of integration and equality for Negro workers and try
to check the Federation’s full participation in the surging battles
around school desegregation, against the White Citizens’ Councils,
and for the right to vote. -

This alliance is now intertwined with the very ﬁbre of the labor
movement. It makes its mark on every major policy and action of
AFL—CIO. Certain of our more recent judgments of this alliance,
which were founded on suspicion of the “motives” of vario-us Negro
and labor leaders—incorrect at the time—would be disastrous today.

True estimates must be based on reckoning soberly with the
movement of millions of Negro workers, of the entire 16,000,000
Negro people, who have set a new time schedule for complete
emancipation now.

The advance of the Negro—labor alliance is supremely important
for the progress of labor and our nation. But its advance will not be
automatic. All who see this have the prime responsibility of giving
their best thought and effort in the continuing ﬁght for its existence
and furtherance. This requires a practical day to day struggle against
every form of discrimination.

Keeping ever mindful that the need for supporting the desire of
the Negro workers to have direct representation in the leadership of
this labor movment is in the interests of all workers, we must ﬁnd
ways to move for and support the desire of the Negro workers to
rise from the unskilled classiﬁcations. The ﬁght for upgrading is a
key ﬁght in the shops today.

Over and above all this, there is needed the commitment of labor’s
full strength in support of the battles of the Negro people in the
South. There is also required an alert response to the intensiﬁcation
of the job problems created by the new technology.

The Communisf Party and the Trade Unions

Even those workers who have been most inﬂuenced against us
know that the Communists are capable of the greatest devotion and
self—sacriﬁce. We pledge that devotion and self—sacriﬁce, not only to
the everyday struggles of the workers, but also to helping labor accom-
plish those historic goals which arise out of the new era in the life of
the labor movement itself.

It is not the policy of the Communist Party to interfere with,
“bore from within,” or to seek to capture or control the trade unions.
We reject any allegation that this is our policy. We respect the com-
plete political and organizational independence of the trade unions‘
and other organizations of the working class. We Communists seek
to inﬂuence the organized workers by persuasion, discussion and ex-
ample, as we do any other section of the population. Abiding by the
discipline of the union, we always favor the full involvement of the
membership in policy—making as well as the activities of the unions.

Workers who are Communists are organized on the basis of their
natural day-to-day working life in shops and industries. There has
been a general reaﬂirmation of this form of organization. Along with
this there is not only a desire for strengthening, but also for ﬂexibility
of application in certain areas of work.

Much has been made of the Party’s emphasis on the role of work-
ers in the most basic industries of our country—-steel, auto, and the
like. The word, “concentration,” has been given all kinds of sinister
meanings. In point of fact, the concern of the C.P. for these workers
is entirely natural. Our Party is an organization of the working class.
It is just these workers who are by the circumstances of their lives
placed in direct conﬂict with big business. They constitute the largest
portion of all industrial workers. Producing directly for the monop-
olies they daily come face to face with monopoly greed, monopoly
speed—up and monopoly discrimination. American labor history has
shown that it is these workers who have engaged in some of the long-
-est and bitterest struggles. Their organization into the ranks of the
CIO during the late ’3o’s had great inﬂuence on the militancy of all
labor, gave a new lift to the American labor movement.

For these reasons our Party believes that in the coming together
of all those who want to curb the monopolies, these basic industrial

38

 

 

workers will be the very bone and sinew of the movement.
We further believe that of necessity, such will be their role

through all of those sharp class struggles which must precede any
peaceful changing over to socialism in our country, a transition which
we envision as possible and which we want to make real. Militant
trade union struggles, however, do not lead automatically to socialist
consciousness. If our Party helps the workers to draw the lessons from
these struggles they will begin to see that only a socialist transforma-
tion of property relations can bring about a ﬁnal solution to their
problems.

The Communist Party is deeply convinced that the workers of
our country are that class which will lead the whole people towards a
better future. This conviction leads the Communists to do all in their
power to help the workers in all their struggles, to assist in organiz-
ing them, and to stand shoulder to shoulder with their fellow—union-
ists in the front ranks when the battle grows hot.

Others insist that we have “Peo le’s Ca italism” and that ca i-

P P P
talists and wo-rkers are “co-partners,” or have a “mutual trusteeship”
for the s stem as a whole. Alon side such views exists a theor often
y g _ Y
put into practice) that the workers should even “sacriﬁce,” and by
accepting lower wages or speed-up or both, assist their own employer
to “compete” with others.

The point of view of the Communist Party is that of class strug-
gle, and the need to support without reservation the side of the work-
ing class. Other views may be generally termed as those of class col-
laboration, and its adherents within labor also assert the need to
strengthen labor’s side in a collaboration that they are compelled to
admit is far from tranquil. For our part, we Communists say there is
a clear basis for the unity of all those who are on labor’s side in those
everyday struggles whose existence no one can deny, and whose solu-
tion demands united effort.

The Communist Party believes that the interests of the American
workers are at one with the workers of other lands. We hailed world
labor unity which came about as a by—product of broad anti—fascist
unity, victorious in World War II. With the coming of the Cold
War, the disruption of this unity, instigated by the monopolies, did
harm to the aspirations of world labor. The easing of world tensions
following upon the Geneva Conference gives hope for the resumption
of that unity. Certainly, the far—flung nature of American Big Busi-

39

 

ness with its branches and properties stretching around the world,
spurs the need for international united action of the workers. The
common objectives of the ICFTU and the WFTU, the two centers
of labor on a world scale, should inspire conciliatory discussions of
past differences and a fresh approach to united action and to unity.

Ours is the age of atomic energy and automation. A power of
production beyond the dreams of any previous generation has come
into being. Yet in our country there is not just rejoicing, there is also
fear. Why should this be so? It is because deep down in the minds of
millions of our countrymen is the question: will these enormous forces,
monopoly—owned, result in abundance for all or further enrichment
of the few and the ruin of the many? Monopoly—owned, will these
gigantic productive forces mean unending peace or a war that will
end all?

The people’s concern is just. They have seen what was called the
“industrial revolution” in our country during the ’2o’s wind up in the
colossal crash of 1929, a crash from which we did not emerge for a
decade, and then only under the stimulus of a new World War. The
people have seen capitalism unleash two world wars in successive gen—
erations.

Therefore an irrepressible searching for new answers is astir in
America. In the labor movement it shows itself in discussion over
whether atomic energy shall be privately developed and controlled or
whether it shall be the government’s province. It shows itself in labor’s
refusal to accept assurances that automation will bring nothing but
good, in labor’s restless search for a program to meet already—felt prob—
lems.

We of the Communist Party share in the popular feeling that
there must be new answers. The labor movement has a strength that
can impose demands that are unprecedented, demands required for a
situation without precedent. Certainly labor is grimly determined never
again to permit the full and ghastly toll of economic storms to be prin-
cipally exacted from the working people. A great coalition of the
people, led by labor, can achieve that goal towards which they have
striven for nearly a century: to curb the monopolies by winning politi-
cal supremacy. ‘

Communists believe a socialist reorganization of our society to be
the ultimate answer. We believe, to the extent that the vast new pro-
ductive forces develop, they will more and more put unbearable strains

40

 

 

.4

on social relations that permit such forces to be owned by a handful of
monopolists and operated to serve their proﬁt aims. Atomic energy

‘ and automation press against such restraints; they demand asocial sys-

tem of production for the use and beneﬁt of all, a system possible
only under the people’s ownership of the means of production. Such
a system, socialism, can only come about when the working people
and the majority of all the people of our country have become con-
vinced of its desirability through their own experiences and thoughts.

A The Communist Party seeks to further this through its advocacy of

socialism, to be achieved democratically by majority will and by peace-
ful means.

This then is why we are convinced that there is a special role for
Communists among the workers:

0 For their conscious participation in the daily struggles;

O For their ability to help draw lessons from each battle and

to help chart the course ahead—for an anti—monopoly coali-
tion of labor, the farmers and the Negro people;

0 For their unreserved position on the side of the workers in

the class struggle;

O For their conviction of the identity of interest of the work-

ers of our country with the workers of others;

0 For their profound belief in the desirability and the inevita-

bility of a socialist transformation of our country.

The experiences of the workers themselves as they live and ﬁght
and think deeply about their problems is the only way in which they
will come to conclusions. Our Party with its scientiﬁc socialist outlook
can help spark this thinking. The future of the American labor move-
ment will also be shaped by the tremendous force for progress that
has arisen from within the ranks of labor and is sweeping across many
lands. For the American trade union movement is part of the labor
movement of the world.

Iv. RALLY TO THE BANNER OF STRUGGLE I=oR NEGRo
FREEDOM—KEY TO STRENGTHENING AMERICAN
 DEMOCRACY

The Negro people of our country are ﬁghting with unbending
will and irresistible resolve to secure now the whole measure of their
constitutional rights as free and equal citizens. The determination is
dramatically portrayed in the massive battles they are waging against
segregation in the South today. y

Over a half million Negroes in deep Southern cities are participat-
ing daily in organized direct action: to break the Jim Crow barrier
in bus transportation. More than a hundred thousand are engaged
in organized campaigns on a single issue—to secure the right to vote;
they aim to utilize the ballot as a weapon in the struggle to desegregate
and to demoerutize Southern life.

Millions of Negroes the country over are giving moral and ﬁnan-
cial support to the legal battles being waged in hundreds of school
districts against the ]im—Crow barriers to equal and no~n—segregated
education. And ﬁercely proud and courageous Southern Negro par-
ents commit their children to the battle. These daring boys and girls
defy hate—inspired mobs to attend “desegregated” schools. They are
the heroic “Young Guard” of a people ﬁghting for their freedom.

In scope, militancy and effectiveness the Negro People’s Move-
ment has reached a maturity unparalleled in recent generations.

This fact of glorious struggle is the most vital reality in Negro
life today. Not the quantity or character of their recent gains,'not
even the continuing depths of their daily oppression—but the com-
pelling magniﬁeence of their united struggle is the most distinguishing
and socially signiﬁcant factor in the lives of 17 million American
Negro people. ‘

The Southern ruling class responds with frenzied violence to the
Negro people’s insistent demands, the mass assertion of their just hu-
man and constitutional rights. The struggle reaches a climactic phase.

Over a hundred ministers among the Negro people’s leaders have
been arrested. More than a score of churches and homes of leaders
have been bombed. Women have been shot on buses. Homes and cars

42

 

 

.,,,,

 

have been ﬁred into. The racists have spilled the blood of the protesting
victims of ]im—Crow tyranny.

But the army of Negro freedom ﬁghters stands ﬁrm. Each day
new recruits join the ranks, new fronts of struggle are opened.

The massive movement and heroic struggles of the Negro people
are daily etching into the consciousness of millions a new sense of
the enormous import which an oppressed people’s ﬁght for equality
lends to the general cause of social progress in the nation.

Millions, hitherto indifferent, now -begin to realize that the tre-
mendous economic, political and social potential of our country can
never be achieved so long as any barrier to Negro equality remains
standing. Millions begin to see that the particular needs of all prog-
ressive social strata of the population are served by this urgent struggle
of the Negro people. They begin to grasp the social truism that what
is good for the Negro people is good for every progressive sector of
white Americans—both for the fulﬁllment of their immediate needs
and the accomplishment of their long—term aspirations.

The Negro people’s leaders, therefore, serve the nation’s best in-
terests no less than their people’s dire needs when they issue a call to
action to all who honor our nation’s democratic heritage, to all who
aspire to a nobler future for our common country.

Now is the time for all progressive Americans to add the full
force of their power to the great lever for democracy forged by the
brave struggles of Southern Negroes. Now is the time for all be-
lievers in democracy—by strengthening and heightening even further
“the great Negro people’s offensive against hidebound reaction—to
raise to new heights the whole plane of democratic opportunity for all
to struggle for social progress in our country.

More than this, the Negro people’s struggle is an increasingly po-
tent factor in the World-embracing battle for democratic rights in
subject lands, for freedom from colonial domination, for peaceful
relations among nations. The protestor against bus segregation in
Montgomery and Tallahassee draws inspiration and precept from the
colonial revolts of the East and the independence stirrings in Africa.
He sees himself debased by the same shibboleths of white supremacy,
the same imperialist arrogance and violence which would deny to
Egyptians sovereignty over the Suez Canal and to Nigerians control
of their rich and ancient land.

He knows, and the world knows, that the monopolists’ protesta—

43

  

 

tions of democracy are rendered a hollow mockery by the persistence
of Dixiecrat rule of the South and dominance in the federal Congress.

The question of Negro freedom, then, is theicraeial domestic issue
of the day, and a factor of growing international consequence.

The circumstances of their common oppression and the unani-
mous demand for equality of rights and status as American citizens
are the ties that bind together all strata of the Negro population. The
steadily growing unity of the Negro people is manifested in the con-
tinuing growth of their mass organizations and institutions, in the
singularity of their basic demands, in the militancy of their advocacy
and action for equal rights, in the developing coordination and colla-
boration between the respective organizations which constitute the
Negro Peop-le’s Movement.

This new strength of organization not only provides for the greater
mobilization and exercise of the ﬁghting power of Negro Americans
to effect change; it also establishes the basis for more formal and
equitable alliance relations with organized labor and other progressive
organized formations of the general population.

The struggles of the Negro people and the resultant signiﬁcant
advance inspired Negro Americans with a new quality of self—conﬁ—
dence. A profound spirit of national consciousness and pride in their
racial identiﬁcation permeates the Negro people of the U.S. today.
It ﬁres their determination to build ever closer their unity in order
to wage the struggle even more militantly to break down all barriers
to their exercise of any and all political, economic and social rights
enjoyed by any other citizens.

Negroes unite not in order to separate themselves from the politi-
cal, economic or social life of our country. They unite to more effec-
tively employ the strength of their own numbers and the weight of
their alliance with other parts of the population to level all barriers
to their fullest integration into all aspects of the economic, political and
social life of the American people as a whole. They are forging an
internal national unity to facilitate their struggle for full integra-
tion as free and equal American citizens.

The Negro people’s movement is today’s standard bearer in the
struggle to open up the now-restricted areas of democracy. It is the
decisive strategic ally of the working class in the current struggles for
liberty and livelihood and in all stages that lead to the subsequent
achievement of the necessary fundamental transformation of Ameri-
can society from the present capitalist exploitative system to that of

44

 

 

 

'|'V3|-JdV\|'h|

socialism. Now to cement the Negro—Labor alliance, through power-
ful mass struggles for Negro rights, is to lay the cornerstone for that
broad anti-monopoly coalition of labor and people’s forces on which
the progressive future of our country depends.

Against the background of this estimate of the Negro people and
their liberation movement, what are the special tasks and responsi-
bilities of Communists? First and foremost, it is the obligation of the
vanguard Party of the American working class to lend every support
to the Negro people’s struggle. This is the main uincompletcd demou
cratic task of our country; and its fulﬁllment will enormously ad-
vance the goals of the working class and our entire nation.

Communists are also called upon to make their maximum inde-
pendent contribution towards winning the just demands of the Negro
people. A

‘It has for three decades been the honorable task of Communists
to set a high standard of devotion to and energetic leadership in the
ﬁght for Negro rights. _Recognizing the special national character
of this question, we have raised our voices among the workers when
others stood mute. We have stirred masses to battle against the bar-
barities of Jim Crow while others chose simply to deplore injustice from
the sidelines. We have in the past often been the pace—setters when
others lagged behind.

This vanguard role of the Communists in the ﬁght for Negro
freedom has been correctly based on a fundamental concept of Marx-
ist—Leninist social science: that the working class can achieve its class
aims only by wiping out the divisions and the inequities created and
fostered among the workers by the ]im—Crow system of the ruling
class. On this basis the Party can and must play a decisive role in forg-
ing an unbreakable link between the Negro people’s movement and
the organized labor movement.

In a real sense the Communist Party, with its insistence on full
political, economic and social equality for the Negro people, with
the example of Negro-white solidarity achieved within its own ranks,
has served as an indispensable forerunner of today’s tremendous
struggles for freedom.

As the advance guard of the American working class, the Com-
munist Party must continue to make its contributions to the ﬁght
for Negro rights, under the changed conditions of today, as effec-
tively, as honorably, as it did in previous periods of struggle. The

45

 

 

ﬁght for Negro rights needs the contribution which Communists,
guided by Marxist—Leninist theory, are in a position to make.

It is essential, therefore, that we thoroughly appraise our policies
and tactics, our internal functioning and our external relations to the
cause of Negro freedom. In this connection, we must assure the
early completion of the study and reassessment now under way of our
previously asserted theoretical position on this question.

The primary weakness of our Party on the front of struggle for
Negro rights during the past decade has been our relative isolation
from the struggle. This has been partly due to the political attacks
against the Party and the McCarthyite anti—Communist poison pumped
into the bloodstream of the workers’ movements.

It has also been due, however, to our own errors. lThe Party’s

work for Negro freedom has been hampered by doctrinaire con-,

cepts, hangovers from past periods, which have resulted in outmoded
practices and a sectarian method and style of work. These sectarian
practices have resulted from a failure to fully grasp the signiﬁcance
of the new forces, the new level of struggle and the new possibili-
ties for victory that have become apparent in the Negro people’s
movement in the course of the p-ast decade.

Another weakness has been that many comrades, Negro and
white, have responded to the failures which accompany both sec-
tarian and opportunist practices by recoiling from any signiﬁcant par-
ticipation in the Negro people’s struggle, by deprecating any project
which assigns to Communists a leading role in the struggle-by
abstentionism. A prevalent form of this abstentionism is a lack
of initiative and imaginative action in moving broad white masses
to act.

A third reason for the isolation of the Party in this ﬁeld of work
has been the failure to establish and sustain new norms of Negro-
white unity-—norms which must reﬂect and correspond to the new
level of the demands for full, not conditional, equality being advanced
by the Negro liberation movement itself. These new no-rms must have
their reﬂection in a higher standard of inner—party Negro—white unity.

Over the past few years, there have accumulated innumerable
problems of personnel in the field of Negro Work: an unsatisfactory
deployment of Negro personnel in leading positions on a national
and district scale; strong manifestations of bureaucratic methods
in dealing with problems of Negro work and inner—party relationships

46

 

 

between Negro and white; the failure to reﬂect in our Party the
leading role played by Negro women in the Negro people’s move-
ment; in some cases a pronounced tendency to give insufﬁcient at-
tention to the repeatedly—exp-ressed views of Negro personnel; and a
serious loss of Negro membership.

The improvement of the level of the Party’s ﬁght for Negro rights
and the enhancing of the quality of Negro-white unity within the
Party require the maximum participation of and consultation with
Negro comrades at all levels of Party work in the formulation of
policy and the disposition of personnel. Special measures must be taken
and guarantees provided to ensure such participation.

It should always be borne in mind that the improvement of the
Party’s work in the struggle for Negro rights will have vitality and
will succeed to the degree that it meets the needs of the Negro people
and wins the support of the Negro membership in the ﬁrst place,
and of the membership as a whole.

A further factor tending to explain our weaknesses in the struggle
for Negro rights has been the recent failure to sustain a continuous
and effective ideological campaign against racism, against every mani-
festation of‘ “white supremacy” thinking and big nation chauvinism.
It has been and remains the duty of Communists to patiently and
persistently point out to the workers that anti-Negro racism is the
ideology of the ruling class, that its purpose and effect is to wring
super—profits out of the sweat of the doubly-exploited Negro workers
and to frustrate the demands of the trade unions and all workers for
a greater share of their production. It has been and remains our
duty to point out, without ceasing, that the racist denial of political
and social rights to the Negro people of the South is the shield be-
hind which the Dixiecrat-minded capitalists restrict the exercise of
democratic rights by all Southerners and foist the reactionary rule of
monopoly on the country as a whole.

Particularly in light of the upsurge for colonial independence in
the East, in light of the historic achievements of the Chinese Peo-
ple’s Republic, the emergence of India as a potent world factor, the
straining of the whole African continent against centuries—old shackles,
it is our responsibility to convince all sections of the American masses
that the cause of Negro freedom serves the cause of world peace.

Solid bond: of unity between Negro and white Communists and
pro g1'e:5iz/es can be realized and sustained when white Communists

I. THE SITUATION TODAY

For a Prosperous America: For an End fo Poverty:
For a New Program of Social Advance

The years since 1939 have witnessed a huge expansion in the
American economy. During this time, our productive capacity has
more than doubled, and today the United States towers over the capi-
talist world, surpassing in productive power and wealth all other
capitalist countries put together.

This enormous power, monopolized by a handful of giant corpor-
ations, rests on a tribute drawn from the whole capitalist world through
a vast expansion in foreign investment. It rests on two wars and
extensive militarization of the American economy. It is the power of
American imperialism, more grasping and parasitic than ever before.

These same years have witnessed also a prolonged period of rela-
tive prosperity——a period of nearly two decades without a major
economic crisis.

The wartime boom, in a country untouched by the destructive
effects of war, has continued into the postwar years. Since 1947, despite
temporary declines, industrial production has risen by 42%. Cor-
porate proﬁts before taxes have nearly doubled. Real wages in organ-
ized industry, particularly during the last few years, have risen
substantially. And by mid-1956, employment reached a record level of
661/2 million.

As in the twenties, the current boom has once again given rise
to illusions of permanent prosperity. Crises, say the spokesmen of
big business and the Eisenhower Administration, are a thing of the
past. The government, through its capacity to intervene and to “man-
age” the economy, can prevent any major disaster and can limit
economic ﬂuctuations to mere “adjustments.” Moreover, they assert,
we have developed a “people’s capitalism,” in which the share of
income and wealth going to the working people is steadily rising,
while that going to big business is falling.

3

  

and progressives, living and working among the white masses, are
engaged actively in struggle against discrimination and manifesta-
tions of racial prejudice. When white Communists fail to join the
struggle for Negro Americans to share in and enjoy all the rights
and opportunities which they are privileged to exercise—-be it in mat-
ters of employment and promotion rights, housing, cultural or recrea-
tional pursuits, of the simple amenities and courtesies of everyday
relationships—then the Party forfeits its stellar role in the freedom
struggle of the Negro people, the bonds of unity dissolve, suspi-
cions and antagonisms replace mutual conﬁdence and Party unity
deteriorates.

The exploiters of the Negro people and the working class thrive
upon and incessantly propagate “white supremacist” ideas among the
popular masses; and we must equip all our members to recognize
and combat this divisive ideology. To neglect or weaken the ﬁght
against white supremacy ideas or practices within the mass move-
ment or their inﬂuences without our own ranks would constitute
abandonment of principle, destruction of the foundation for Negro-
white unity and the lowering of the Party’s proud banner of equality
and comradeship.

All Communists, and all progressive Americans, are called upon
to marshall their maximum strength to enhance the liberation move-
ment of the Negro people. This requires:

I. Full participation in and support of the all—sided anti-segrega-
tion moz/ement in the South. This is a battle to remove a festering,
unsightly sore from the national body politic; to free the Negro people
of the unequal opportunity and the social degradation heaped upon
them ‘by a system which renders them outcasts; to enforce the Con-
stitution of the United States as interpreted by the Supreme Court.
A popular and irresistible demand must arise for Congressional ac
tion to end ﬁlibustering and pass civil rights legislation, for effective
federal executive intervention to stay the murderous hands of the
Southern racists, to enforce integration in all aspects of public life, in
all Southern states, now.

2. The strengthening and broadening of the battle for the unfet-
tered right of suﬂrage for all Southerners. The right to vote and to he
voted for must not be restricted by race or property. Poll taxes, which
persist in ﬁve Southern states, must be abolished. Discriminatory
registration practices, aimed at disfranchising Negroes and white work-

48

 

 

 

ing people, must be ended. Intimidation and terror, still the customary
accompaniment of elections in Southern states, must cease to bar the
Way to the ballot box. This struggle for democratic elections in the
South must be buttressed by intensive campaigns to increase Negro
representation on all levels of government, both North and South.

3. An intensiﬁed struggle for equal employment and upgrading
practices in all industries, everywhere in the nation. The trade—union
movement will be greatly strengthened to the degree that it insists on
the slogan long inscribed on its banners: equal pay for equal work.
Apprenticeship training must be opened up to Negro youth on an equal
basis with young White workers The strengthening of the activities of
the anti—discrimination committees of the AFL—CIO, and of interna-
tional and local unions, should continue to be regarded as a matter of
urgent concern for the labor movement. Special attention should be
given to advancing Negro participation in the leadership of the
trade—union movement at all levels. The American labor movement
must be helped to understand that racism and unionism are funda-
mentally incompatible.

4. The unfolding df major campaigns to break down segregation
in housing.- Hemmed into the dilapidated tenements and ramshackle
dwellings of our urban ghettos, the Negro masses are made the prey
of merciless rent—gougers. They are thrice robbed by higher prices
for inferior commodities and services in the stores of the ]im—Crow
communities. Housing segregation is another barrier to the unity of

ments, Whether public or private, should be administered so as to com-

" The uestion of decent, desegregated housing is one of_ the most ur t life-and-death
needs of the egro people the country_ over and in Northern cities particular y. _Within Negro
communities there is an almost unbelievable degree of overcrowding, accompanied by untold
human misery, disease and death from fires. _ _

During the last census decade, 19f10-5.0, overcrowding of Negroes increased 11 per cent.
Of the nine million new dwellings built since 195 3, _less than 1 per cent went to non-whites,
who are more than 10 per cent of the total population. In New York's Harlem _a.1on_e there
occur 2,500 rat bite cases a year. The pressure of a steady ﬂow of Southern migration _has
made this an irrepressible focal oint of the sharpest struggle. _Forced into sub-standard dwellings

P Jim-Crow in housing exists primarily because it is proﬁtable to a host of parasites who
make money directly out of the existence of the ghetto. This includes the rent-gouging land-
lords real estate sharks, merchants and others who rob the Negro at every turn.

sucking loan sharks the cause of the Negro slum. The real cause is segregation itself, and no

requires support of the program of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and other organizations of the
Negro people to accomplish desegregation of the schools in accordance
with the mandates of the federal courts. It will require, in some
instances, federal protection of the lives and limbs of Negro students
of “desegregated” schools. In Northern communities the ﬁght against
school segregation, which is still widely maintained, involves primarily
the struggle to re-district school lines on an integrated basis. Funda-
mental to a correction of this discriminatory practice is the ﬁght to end
Iim—Crow housing.

6. Intensifying the ideological struggle against racism. Since the
Supreme Court decision of May 17, 1954, the country has been ﬂooded
with an ocean of racist literature, and television, radio and news-
papers have been used in the South to saturate the minds of white
masses with the false doctrine of “white supremacy.” The task of
propagating the truth of the equality of all peoples, the necessity of
convincing the white workers and the democratic masses generally
that equal rights for the Negro people is a matter of their own self
interest, is more urgent than ever before.

All of the class strata in Negro life have a stake in the goals of
and are represented in the Negro people’s movement for democratic
rights and equality. Nevertheless, the Negro people are, in class com-
position, essentially a working people. The preponderant member-

trfmedy for the Negro housing question can be successful which does not come to grips with

is evi .

There is good reason for the special hostility to integration in housin . For se e a
housing is fundamental to the whole system of Jim-Crow in the North. It i§ this Wh1gCrl'lg Dee:
petuates segregation in the schools, almost as effectively as if it were done by law, as wel as
segregation in recreational and other facilities. The existence of the ghetto slums also serves as
a powerful means of feeding the myth of "white supremacy,” and by the satne token the freedom
of Negroes to live where they please would deal a powerful blow against this myth.

What _is required is a large-scale program of integrated low-cost and middle income housing,
built oumde the existing Ne ro communities. White liberals and progressives, by undertaking
in a really mass way the ﬁgfit for interracial housing, can make a great contribution to the
struggle against segregation ‘and for the_ further democratization of American life, and at the
same time strike a blow against the gouging of white as well as Puerto Rican, Mexican-American
and Negro tenants and.home owners by the real estate and banking monopolies.

To be reall effective, a h_ousin program must be both comprehensive and directed at
the goal of era icating segregation. nd it should be carried forward by the concerted action
of both Negro and _white citizens dedicated to bringing it into life. It ought to occupy a high
place of emphasis in the action programs of labor and all popular organizations. Such a
program should include some of the following elements:

extensive program of low cost housing on a non-segregated basis, and the full inte-
gration of all existing projects;

2. An end to the victimization of Negro home owners and buyers. Making credit and insurance
available on reasonable terms and without Jim.-Crow strings attached, whether through
banks, government agencies, or other institutions;

3. Vigorous action against vandalism, bombings and other racist violence;

4. Enforcement of the building and sanitary codes, adequate collection of garbage, street
cleaning services, etc., in Negro communities;

5. Positive steps to outlaw all restrictive covenants. _

Such a program, if fought for in Congress, State Legislatures and City Councils, with the
support of the churches, trade unions and community organizations, Negro and white, could
change the segregated patterns of our cities. It would provide the foundation for a new
quality of Negro—white unity, with far-ranging consequences for the social progress of the
nation.

ship of the Negro people’s mass movement organizations is of the
working-class and toiling farmers.

This working-class component, working side by side with white
workers in shop, mine and mill, sharing in the activities of the com-
mon unions of all workers, is the guarantee that the bonds of fraternity
will be strengthened between the liberation movement and the work-
ing class. Its preponderant strength in the Negro people’s movement
for freedom enhances the prospects for the development of this move—
ment in conformity with the aims and interests of labor. This is the
major factor which gives substance to the outlook and the program
for complete integration which characterizes the Negro liberation
movement today.

Similarly, because of its experience and discipline in the struggles
of the American labor movement, the working-class component of
the Negro freedom movement will of necessity leave its imprint of
militancy and united mass action on that movement. It may be ex-
pected increasingly to inﬂuence program and tactics of the Negro
liberation movement, and more and more to contribute outstanding
personalities to its leadership. Our Party must base itself on this work-
ing-class strata of the Negro people.

The tactics and modes of struggle of the Negro people’s liberation
movement are decisively determined by the relationship of class and
national forces in the nation as a whole and in the South in particular.
They are also influenced and shaped by the objective class relations
within the Negro people’s movement and the common social and
cultural life of the entire Negro people. Those forms of struggle
which prevail at a given moment are likely to be those most congenial,
familiar and acceptable to the Negro people themselves. Their tactics
of struggle correspond to the realities of the circumstances and condi-
tions within which the struggle unfolds.

It is therefore not the task of Communists or any other group to
impose upon the Negro people new forms of struggle, tactics alien to
their historic development as a people. Rather it is the task of all
supporters of the Negro liberation movement, including the Commu-
nists, to lend their unreserved support to, and to take an active part
in those programs and techniques of struggle which now embrace and
propel into action the great majority of the Negro people.

The great labor movement of our country and all democratic forces
in American life are called upon to recognize in the struggle for Negro
right: the decisive task before the country today. The Communist

SI

Party sees in this struggle the number one challenge to action for all
Communists. It is the portal to new advances in all spheres in the fight
for social progress. :

Without the enfranchisement of the Negro masses in the South
the road to an anti—monopoly people’s government will remain blocked
by the Dixiecrat reactionaries who dominate Congressional commit-
tees by virtue of the disfranchisement of Southern masses.

The organization of the unorganized Negro workers in common
unions with their white brothers in the South is the surest security
against the runaway shop and the prerequisite for labor’s further ad-
vance on the economic front of struggle to raise the living standards
of all who work.

The plantation system, which still holds some 5 million white and
Negro farm workers under barbarous_ conditions of exploitation and
oppression, must be eradicated. In the mounting struggle for the
democratic reconstruction of the South, there must be special efforts
to win governmental measures to secure land and land tenure for
Negro croppers, tenants and small owners, and to provide cheap
credit and capital goods for agricultural cooperatives.

Equality and full integration in the economic life of the country
would force the monopolies to disgorge the $25 billion in super—proﬁts
which they now rob from the Negro people’s just share of the gross
national product and add to their mountainous store of privately-
owned public wealth. The restoration of this $525 billion to the Negro
people must be regarded as a vital element in any sound anti—depres-
sion program in our country.

Success in the struggle for Negro freedom will add moral tone
to the national democratic spirit. It will radically advance the progres-
sive potential of the American people in determining their domestic
affairs and inﬂuencing the international relations of our country in
the service of democratic and peaceful relations among nations.

Much as the destruction of slavery in the South became imperative
for the forward movement of our nation a century ago, so the destruc-
tion of the ]im—CroW system centering in the South has become neces-
sary for the democratic progress of our country today. Now, as in the
185o’s, ever larger sections of the American people—foremost among
which is the organized labor movement—-can be won as powerful
allies in the struggle for Negro rights.

The Communist Party of the United States pledges itself to the
accomplishment of this task.

V. THE AMERICAN ROAD TO SOCIALISM

The people’s anti—monopoly coalition would have as its central
aim the improvement of the conditions of the American people and the
defense and extension of their democratic rights. Its success in electing
a people’s anti—monopoly government would open the way to a vast
and unprecedented expansion of democracy. Such a government could
curb the repressive economic and political powers of the monopolies and
deprive them of the ability to promote violence to frustrate the will
of the people. Under such conditions, whenever the majority of the
American people become convinced of the necessity of a socialist reor-
ganization of society, they would be able to advance to their goal along
peaceful and constitutional lines.

Ever since the rise of the struggle against fascism and the fascist
danger in the ’3o’s, our Party has been elaborating such a program for
a peaceful and constitutional transition to socialism. In 1938, the 10th
Party Convention adopted the first written constitution of the Com-
munist Party. It expressly stated that any advocate of force and violence.
would be excluded from the Party.

In the succeeding years many additional steps were taken. The
leading spokesmen of the Party, Chairman Foster and General Secre-
tary Dennis, expressed this position of the Party in 1947-48 in articles,
statements and interviews with such leading newspapers as the New
York Times and Herala’—Trz'bmze. A high point in the presentation
of this question was Comrade Foster’s deposition, “In Defense of the
Communist Party and Its Indicted Leaders,” at the ﬁrst Smith Act
trial in 1949. This statement of policy was endorsed by the National.
Committee of the Party. It was expressed in the Party Program, “The.
American Way,” adopted in 1954. Comrades Dennis and Gates at the
ﬁrst meeting they addressed after their release from jail, at Carnegie
Hall, January 20, I956, reiterated our Party’s advocacy of a peaceful and
constitutional road to socialism in our country.

Some have challenged this View on the ground that the capitalist
class of the U.S. is strong and the forces of repression at its disposal are
powerful. They point to the character and sharpness of the class and
people’s struggle in the past and today. These points are unquestioned.

53

 

The trusts will continue to try to promote demagogy, division and
force and violence to halt social progress and democratic advance.

Titanic economic and political struggles will intervene in our
country before the majority of the people take the path to socialism.
In the course of and as a consequence of such struggles of the working
class, the Negro people and others, the power of the monopolies could
by drastically curb-ed through the election of an anti—monopoly gov-
ernment. There would be a new strength, a new class consciousness
-and political maturity within the labor and people’s movements which
would also be reﬂected in the strength of the party or parties of
socialism.

That is why we state that the possibility exists for the peaceful
and constitutional transition to socialism. This transitionvvill become
possible when the majority of the American people so decide inthe
course of their struggles against the monopolies. Only the American
people will make that decision.

This concept of our advocacy of, and endeavor to, chart a peaceful,
democratic and constitutional road to socialism in America expresses
what we Communists strive fo-r. It is a further development of our
established position. It embodies our basic view that socialism can be
established only through a radical and fundamental extension of
American democracy and a revolutionary transformation of all prop-
erty relations. It emphasizes that all roads to socialism are roads of
mass struggle, waged under the leadership- of the working class and its
Marxist vanguard. But now this concept takes on a new meaning in
light of the profoundly new and favorable changes in our own country
.-and in world relationships. V

The history of our country, the struggles of our people to fulﬁll
the Bill of Rights, their attachment to the Constitution all point to the
further conclusion that socialism in the U.S. will provide full civil
liberties to all, including the right to dissent, and, as long as the people
so desire, a multi-party system. This is not an academic question for
our Party. This stand by our Party on civil liberties under socialism is
of value in clarifying our perspective of socialism and also assists in
strengthening the unity of the derrfocratic forces of our land for com-
mon action today.

Socialism in America will be the realization of the dream of eco-
nomic independence and political freedom, of “life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness” under the conditions of today, in the age of atomic
energy and automation. It will carry forward the best traditions of
Jefferson, Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, and of the great American

54

pioneer labor and socialist leaders, William Sylvis and Gene Debs.

Socialism is no more un—American than is capitalism particularly
American. Capitalism and socialism are social systems growing out of
the evolution of society and its struggle toward greater progress. Capi-
talism in the U.S., because of the peculiar features and historical condi-
tions of its development, has brought a relatively high standard of liv-
ing to a large number of people. But it also has brought economic crisis,
wars, colonial exploitation and oppression, unemployment, insecurity,
crime, socal degradation and discrimination. The people had to ﬁght
for their standard of living and for their democratic liberties against
the forces of privilege and reaction at every stage in the history of our
country. They fought for independence, for the Bill of Rights, for the
right to vote, for the right to education, for the abolition of slavery, for
the rights of women, for the abolition of child labor, for the right to
build unions, for social insurance. And to this day the Negro people
are denied equal rights, are discriminated against, and are doubly ex-
ploited.

Today socialism, embracing a third of the world’s people, has
grown to a world system. In the coming period the superiority of so-
cialism over capitalism will become ever more apparent to all peoples.

Socialism in the U.S. from the beginning will be able to provide all
our people with the highest standard of living, the fullest economic
security. For ours is the most technically advanced country in the
world. Our resources, our skills, our technology, our organizing capa-
city and experience, our workers, scientists, will assure a rapidly in-
creasing standard of living for all. Socialism in our country will bring
not only the fullest satisfaction of our material needs but also the fullest
democratic liberty and cultural satisfaction.

The Communist Party from its inception has been the party of
socialism. Because of this it has brought strength and understanding

much greater than its numbers to the struggles in which it fought as

part of the American working people. But our Party never fully mas-
tered the task of successfully combining the immediate struggle and
socialist education. In the early period policies and slogans were put
forward as if socialism were around the corner. Later on, when the
Party, making a more sober and realistic analysis of the situation,
came to the conclusion that socialism was not on the immediate order
of the clay in the U.S., educational work for socialism was neglected.

This resulted from our narrow and sectarian conception of social-
ism, of what it would be like in the U.S. and of how it would be
achieved. We failed to see in the many struggles for greater economic

55

 

security, in the strong anti—monopoly tendencies, the basis for reach-
ing the people with fundamental discussions of issues and for pro-
moting socialist education among them.‘

But the enemies of socialism have never ceased their attacks and
are today carrying on widespread propaganda not only against the
socialist lands and against the Communist Party of the United States,
but also against the ideas of socialism.

This should make clear that the Communist Party cannot limit
itself to a mere declaration that socialism is not on the immediate order
of the day in our land. This is undoubtedly true. But socialism is
nonetheless an issue: socialism in the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries, and most of all, what socialism would be like in the U.S.
and how the Communist Party hopes the American people will
achieve socialism.

The historic conditions deriving from the First World War, the
Russian Revolution, and the split in the socialist movement have now
given way to new conditions. The emergence of socialism from the
limits of one country to a world system embracing several states and
one-third of mankind was described by the 20th Congress of the Com-
munist Party of the Soviet Union as “the chief feature of the present
era.”

These conditions make possible a great new trend towards unity
among socialist—minded people which has already begun to be felt not
only abroad but in our own country. The new features of independence
and mutual criticism in the relationships among Communist Parties
also tend to remove barriers between Communists and other supporters
of socialism.

For some months our Party has had under consideration the
question presented in Eugene Dennis’ report to the National Com-
mittee meeting last April, of our attitude towards the perspective of
a united party of socialism in this country.

The new developments point to a certain revitalization and
growth of socialist—oriented and pro—Marxist currents and groupings.
In the past we tended to assume that all that was worth while in other
socialist currents and groupings would inevitably flow into our own
organization. This assumption was always incorrect and should be
replaced by serious and painstaking efforts to assist in the eventual
development of the broadest possible unity of all socialist-minded
elements.

The perspective of an eventual united socialist movement or party

56

 

must be viewed as the climax of a series of struggles and develop-
ments. It is not a quick and easy solution to the common problems
of all socialist groupings, or to the speciﬁc problems of our own Party.
Such an approach would both weaken our Party and distort this per—
spective. Least of all could this objective be advanced by any ten-
dency to weaken or dissolve the Communist Party. On the contrary,
it is essential that the Communist Party strengthen in every way
its organization, mass work and inﬂuence.

The prospect we hold forth for our Party likewise requires a re-‘
invigoration of the Marxist press. A prerequisite for an effective hearing
for Marxist ideas and for making their inﬂuence felt in respect to the
course of our country’s development is that we spare no effort in
helping to ﬁnance and solve the distribution problems of The Worker
and the Daily W01”/(er. Stabilizing the ﬁnancial base of the Marxist
press and building its circulation will establish the practical founda-
tion for a steady improvement in its political and journalistic quality.

The attainment of unity among socialist—minded forces lies along
the path of common struggle on the broadest issues facing the Ameri-
can people, in the course of which ideological and tactical questions
will become clariﬁed and common bonds be forged.

It lies along the path of extending the process of frank exchange
and discussion that has been taking place during the past year and
ensuring that our Party at all levels increasingly participates in this
process.

It would be wrong to identify the extent of socialist traditions
and thinking with the low level of socialist organization today.
Among the trade unions, in the building of which Socialists and
Communists played a major role, among the Negro people, the work-
ing farmers, the professionals and the youth who are pondering the
signiﬁcance of the growth of the socialist world system, as well as
among the many thousands who at one time were members of our
Party or who participated in mass struggles under our leadership, are
to be found many who would welcome the perspective of a united
party of socialism. The National Committee should be charged with
fostering this perspective.

The historic objective of achieving unity of all honest socialist-
rninded forces to develop the American people's anti-monopoly coali-
tion, as well as for the ultimate achievement of socialism, throws an
added light on our re-appraisal of our Party’s past and p-resent func-
tioning, its mass activity and its vast role in the period ahead.

But such Wall Street—inspired illusions are entirely unfounded.
In reality, the very factors sp-arking the boom serve also to increase the
underlying instability of the economy and the imbalance between
productive capacity and the market. Outstanding among these fac-
tors are:

I. A high rate of investment in ﬁxed capital throughout the
postwar period. This has been motivated principally by the need to
restore world-wide damage and domestic shortages arising from the
war, as well as to replace obsolete and wornout equipment, by techno-
logical advances, and by the expansion of basic industrial capacity to
fit the enlarged world role and military program of American
monopoly capital. Coupled with this has been an expansion of
the consumer durable goods market and an extended boom in hous-
ing construction. -

But today the rate of increase in industrial capacity far exceeds
the rate of growth in purchasing power. This disparity ultimately
leads to a point when continued expansion in the face of inadequate
markets is no longer proﬁtable and capital investment declines.

2. A vast ‘ growth in government spending. For the current fiscal
year, cash outlays of government at all levels will total nearly $100
billion, of which federal government expenditures account for some
$69 billion.

Of the federal outlays, about two-thirds goes for “national se-
curity.” In large part, therefore, the present high level of the economy
is based on the unreliable prop of arms spending, which during the
Korean war hit a peak rate of $55 billion a year, and is today running
at an annual rate of about $41 billion. And for the coming ﬁscal year,
President Eisenhower has proposed a record peace-time federal budget
of $72 billion, $45 billion of it for military purposes.

Among the consequences of such spending are the postwar inﬂa-
tion which has brought prices of consumer goods and the cost of liv-
ing to their highest level in history; a federal debt af $276 billion, only
slightly below the World War II peak, with its billions of dollars in
interest charges; and a tax burden which consumes one—third of the
earnings of the average worker.

3. An unparalleled inflation of private credit. Corporate debt has
grown 2‘/2 times since 1945. Personal indebtedness—home mortgages
and consumer debt—has risen to $137 billion, of which more than
$100 billion was accumulated during the last ten years. Consumer

.V|. OUR PARTY

The Communist Party made a vital contribution to the welfare
of our country since the end of World War II by its unﬂinching ﬁght
for peace, against the danger of fascism, for the civil rights of the
Negro people, and for the economic needs of the working people. It
continues to do so.

Communists fought consistently through the years of the cold
war to help bring about the present improved political situation. In
so doing, they served the best national interests of our country with
patriotic selflessness. I

At its Emergency Convention in 1945, the Communist Party
warned the American people about the dangers inherent in the
developing plans of Wall Street to dominate the world. As this
aggressive drive for world domination unfolded, the Communist
Party alerted the American people to the emergence of a serious
danger of a new world war. It exposed and combatted every policy
and action which jeopardized or broke the peace; the notorious “get
tough with Russia” policy; the war-inciting Fulton, Missouri, speech
of Winston Churchill; the Truman doctrine of “containment,” atom-
bomb diplomacy and military intervention in China and Greece; the
Marshall Plan; the “positions of strength” policy embodied in the
Atlantic Pact, NATO, SEATO and other military alliances, as well
as the building of military bases all over the world. The Communist
Party fought consistently under diﬂicult conditions for a negotiated
peace to end the Korean War. It vigorously combatted the Big Lie of
an alleged threat of Soviet aggression. It called for the negotiation of
differences between the Big Powers, the end of the cold war and its
replacement by a policy of peaceful coexistence between our country
and the Soviet Union.

Our Pari-y's ~Achievemem‘s

During this period the Communist Party took the lead in com-
batting a host of repressive measures and policies designed to silence
those ﬁghting for peace and to intimidate the American people into
acceptance of unpopular military adventures. It exposed and fought

58

 

 

 

against the Schwellenbach proposal for outlawing the Communist
Party, the Mundt—Nixon Bill, the McCarran Act, the Taft—Hartley
Act, the Attorney General’s “subversive list,” the thought—control
“loyalty” order and civil service witch-hunts, the persecution by Con-
gressional committees, the Smith Act prosecutions, the McCarthyite
inquisition and the “atom—spy” hoax which resulted in the frame-up
and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as the imprison-
ment of Morton Sobell. The Party exposed and fought against re-
pressive measures and policies adopted in many states.

Throughout this period the Communist Party actively supported
labor’s struggles for improved economic and working conditions, par-
ticularly during the big strikes of the miners, the railway, packing-
house, steel, auto, electrical and farm equipment workers. Commun-
ists champio-ned labor’s united action in defense of its hard won gains.
They contributed to labor’s growing appreciation of its unique and
decisive role in the life of the nation. They helped labor gain a better
understanding of its relation to the struggle for Negro rights. They
urged closer working relationships between labor and the farm
population. They fought for democratic, militant trade unionism and
against expulsions, raiding, secessions and the fragmentation of the
labor movement. They popularized independent political action as
the key to the future not only of the labor movement but of the en-
tire nation.

The Communist Party energetically championed the struggles of
the Negro people for full economic, social and political equality. It
made notable contributions in defending Willie McGee, the Martins-
ville Seven, the Trenton Six, I\/Irs. Rosa Lee Ingram and Wesley
Wells; in combatting segregated housing in Stuyvesant Town, Levit-
town, and Parkchester in New York, in Park Manor, Peoria Street
and Trumbull Park in Illinois, and in many other communities
throughout the nation; in popularizing the battle for Negro repre-
sentation in all elective and appointive government bodies; in pro-
moting the struggle for inclusion of model FEPC clauses in union
contracts; in ﬁghting for election and appointment of Negro leaders
to top positions in the lily-white leadership of many unions. These
and similar activities of the Communist Party contributed substan-
tially to the emergence of the current broad movement for civil
rights.

The struggles waged by the Communist Party in the past decade
constitute a notable chapter in the history of the American Working

59

class. As the tide continues to turn against McCarthyism and the cold
war, sweeping away the frenzied insanity of a decade of red-baiting,
lies and distortions, the justice and courage of the Communist Party’s
struggle will be increasingly vindicated in the eyes of all Americans
who have the real Welfare of our country at heart. Every member and
friend of the Communist Party has reason to be proud of the contribu-
tions made to the great task of helping save America from the catas-
trophe of war and fascism.

The Communist Party and its supporters have reason to be proud
of the staunchness with which they met the wave of persecution
against them. Nonetheless, this persecution was not without effect. It
took the form of an expanding pattern of repression including: Taft-
Hartley Act affidavits and perjury prosecutions; Smith Act arrests,
trials, convictions and jail sentences; Congressional committee inquisi-
tions and contempt citations; the screening of whole industries and
the entire civil service; ﬁrings from jobs, hounding from professions,
establishment of industry-wide blacklists McCarran Act persecutions;
widespread deportations of foreign-born; deprivation of legal rights to
halls, radio time, advertising space, etc. All this put the Communist
Party in a position of de facto illegality.

Furthermore, the attacks on the Party occurred at a time when
the overall economic situation, with the exception of the chronic post-
war agricultural. crisis, was characterized by high levels of employ-
ment and increased total earnings by workers’ families. This situation
gave rise to two trends in the ranks of the working class. On the one
hand, the absence of an army of unemployed who might be used as a
club against them encouraged the workers to ﬁght militantly through
this period for wage increases and important fringe beneﬁts. This is
a positive feature of the postwar decade. On the other hand, the
growth of class consciousness was inhibited by the spreading of Key-
nesian theories in the labor movement to the effect that capitalism
could permanently solve the problem of “boom or bust” through a
“managed economy” with built~in stabilizers. This helped erode the
class consciousness of many labor leaders who in past years considered
themselves adherents of socialism, but who today have abandoned
their socialist convictions. In this situation, the capacity of the labor
movement to understand the signiﬁcance of the attack on the Com-
munists was also weakened and its‘ defense of the rights of Commun-
ists was relatively limited.

6o

The attack unleashed against the Communist Party was designed
to destroy it. In this, it did not succeed. It did succeed in weakening
and isolating the Party. It is necessary for all members of the Com-
munist Party to face up soberly to the fact that in this period the Party
suffered heavy organizational losses, declined in political inﬂuence in
many areas of work, became dangerously isolated from important sec-
tors of the labor and people’s movement, is confronted with the grave
jeopardizing of the Marxist press, and that in general the Party is
faced with a serious crisis of a political, ideological, and organizational
nature.

Was it inevitable that the Party should become so severely iso-
lated and suffer such organizational and political losses as it did? The
answer must be NO. Against the background of the objective situa-
tion and its consequences, the errors and long—standing weaknesses of
our Party had a particularly damaging effect.

Errors and Weaknesses of fhe Parry  

The most important of these errors include:

A. In the Fight for Peace. The Party’s estimate that Wall Street’s
drive for world domination created a serious danger of a new world
war was correct. With this analysis our Party made a signiﬁcant con-
tribution to the mobilization of American and world peace forces. At
the same time some serious sectarian mistakes were made in analyzing
important phases of the struggle between the forces of peace and War.
While we repeatedly asserted that World War III was not inevitable,
We tended to weaken this correct estimate by declaring that each new
defeat for American imperialism increased its desperation and, hence,
increased the danger of war. This was coupled with an analysis that
the only major difference in the ranks of monopoly capital was be-
tween those who want war now and those who want war later.

This overlooked the fact that Wall Street’s ability to achieve its
predatory aims was diminishing and that the setbacks to the imperial-
ist drive sharpened all differences within the ranks of monopoly
capital as well as between the imperialists of various countries. It
overlooked the fact that the overall situation of American imperialism
still gave it room to maneuver short of world war rather than reduc-
ing it to desperate alternatives.

In effect, such estimates excluded the possibility of the peaceful

61

 

settlement of differences except through a major change in the relation
of class forces in the United States. They made it diﬂicult to convince
the Party membership and the masses of the possibility of achieving
under existing conditions a protracted period of peaceful coexistence.

Certainly, when Dulles three times took our country “to the
brink of war,” this represented on each occasion an acute sharpening
of the danger of wars which might have had global repercussions. But
Dulles’ inability to take our country over the brink revealed the
strength of the obstacles to war. It was precisely this strength that our
Party underestimated.

That is why, despite our statements regarding the profound
signiﬁcance of the armistice in Korea and the negotiated peace in
Indo-China, our Party did not draw full conclusions from the favor-
able changes in international relations which these events signalized.
Because of a narrow concept of the division of the world into two
camp-s we did not properly assess the growth of a neutralist bloc in the
world, especially the newly liberated colonial countries, as well as like
forces in our country. In fact, up to the very eve of the Geneva
Summit meeting there were strong tendencies to underestimate the

’ ability of the peace forces, within our country and internationally, to

compel the Eisenhower Administration to enter into peaceful nego-
tiations with the socialist world.

B. In tlze Fight Against the Fascist Danger. The Party correctly
assessed the connection between American imperialism’s aggressive
foreign policy and the host of reactionary and pro-fascist measures
which began to be promulgated, adopted or enforced in the late I94o’s.
These measures were designed to intimidate and suppress all opposi-
tion to the aggressive policies of Big Business. Contrary to opinions
prevalent in some circles that this development was a temporary post-
war aberration which would automatically subside in time, the Party
emphasized the potential fascist danger if it was not checked by the
active struggle of the American people.

However, the errors made by the Party in estimating various
phases of the struggle against the war danger also inﬂuenced its judg-
ment of the fascist menace, particularly in relation to attempts to out-
law the Party. This took the form of overestimating the scope, level
and tempo of the process of fascization under way generally. Our
evaluation also tended to equate the attempted outlawing of the
Party with fascism.

62

 

 

This led to wrong organizational decisions in 1950, including
conscious efforts to reduce the size o-f the Party membership. While
this particular error was quickly recognized by the Districts and the
National Committee and corrective steps were taken, it nevertheless
resulted in serious damage to the Party organization.

Subsequently, in 1951, the National Committee statement on the
Vinson decision upholding the ﬁrst Smith Act conviction of Com-
munist leaders estimated that we had entered a wholly “new situa-
tion”; in other words, that a qualitative change had taken place in the
process of the fascization of our country. This led to the introduction
of a system of leadership which virtually gave up the ﬁght for legal-
ity, tended to accept a status of illegality and abandoned many pos-
sibilities for the public functioning of the Party.

While it was essential to safeguard the Party and enable it to
function under the diﬂicult conditions it faced, and while numerous
Communists displayed great steadfastness in this task, nevertheless,
as a result of a sectarian approach to this effort, the Party needlessly
lost thousands of members. This facilitated the efforts of reaction
to isolate us from the masses who, naturally, could not understand
the Party’s course in the given situation.

Contributing to these left-sectarian errors were:

a) the failure to recognize that the ruling class was not so hard
pressed as to be unable to continue its established method of govern-
mental rule even as it sharply curtailed the Bill of Rights by launching
unprecedented attacks against the labo-r and people’s movements, and
in the first place, against the Communist Party;

b) underestimation of the strength of American democratic tra-
and the Bill of Rights, the latent power of the trade unions as a bul-
wark against fascism, the peculiarities of American governmental
structure, as well as the struggles between and within the two major
parties which act as impediments to the repressive drive of the most
reactionary circles. '

Nafure of fhe Errors

In our struggle for a mass policy we base ourselves on the follow-
ing Marxist-Leninist propositions:
a) that both left-sectarianism and right-opportunism have ob-

63

 

jective roots in reality—in the system under which we live;

b) that the struggle must be conducted on both fronts, with the
main emphasis against that which threatens the Marxist line of our
Party at the given moment.

The most important mistakes made in the period under review
were left-sectarian in character. These left-sectarian mistakes in the
context of sharp attacks against the Party are the main reason for the
unprecedented degree to which it was possible for Big Business and
its political representatives to isolate the Party.

To end its isolation and expand its mass work, the main task of
the Party today is to overcome completely the inﬂuence of left-sec-
tarian estimates, policies and tactics in all ﬁelds of work.

In the process of carrying out the main task the Party must strug-
gle against existent right—opportunist tendencies, comhattin g them at
all times. This is especially necessary in view of the extremely sharp
turn which the Party is now making in many of its basic policies. The
necessary struggle against right—oppor‘tunist errors must be carried on
in such a way as not to weaken the main task.

This effort has been under way in the Party particularly since
the end of 1952. Following the results of the 1952 elections, the Na-
tional Committee began a serious struggle against left-sectarianism as
the main danger in our mass work. This found expression: in the
resolution on the results of the 1952 elections, which sharply criticized
the sectarian direction of the Party’s electoral tactics; in leading articles
in 1953, which outlined the path for a sharp break with sectarianism
in our mass work and for redirecting the Party toward the main-
stream of the labor movement; in overcoming hesitation on the pro-
jection of our position on peaceful transition and an American path to
socialism as initiated by Comrade Foster; in the opening of a con-
certed political struggle against sectarianism in many phases of our
Negro work, including the issuance of “The Common Program for
the South,” as well as publication of various articles; in the initiation
of new approaches to the Smith ‘Act trials; in serious efforts to influ-
ence the Left—led unions to re—enter the mainstream of the labor move-
ment; in the Party Program adopted in 1954 which, despite certain
errors in estimate gave new and broad perspectives to the Party both
in its immediate Work and long range outlook; in the gradual aban-

donment and ﬁnally complete liquidation of unnecessary and extreme
security measures.

64

 

However, this struggle was carried on in a piece—meal manner with

considerable inconsistency and vacillation because it met with strong

resistance in the Party. This resulted at times in conciliation with or
continuance of sectarian policies and practices. Moreover, the political
struggle against sectarianism was undermined and in fact contradicted
by continuation of the organizational policies which flowed from the
National Committee’s 1951 decisions on the system of leadership.

Nevertheless, as a result of these beginnings of the battle against
sectarianism during 1953, 1954 and 1955 (taken together with favor-
able changes in the political situation), some advances have already
been made in unfreezing relationswith important center forces in the
trade unions, the Negro people’s organizations and the communities,
as well as in beginning to overcome the Party’s formerly extreme isola-
tion in many ﬁelds. Basically we could not correct our past mistakes
as long as we had not yet recognized the sources of left-sectarianism.

While these errors were the property of the Party as a whole, a
major burden of responsibility must fall upon the leadership of our
Party, who were in the main responsible for the formulation of those
sectarian policies and estimates without the widest consultation of the
membership. On most occasions, the general membership did not _have
an opportunity to express their opinion on these questions, so that
these policies reflected not the collective estimate of the entire Party, but
rather the thinking of the leadership itself. Had the leadership fully
understood the role the membership could have played, many of these
mistakes could have been avoided or corrected more quickly.

The April 1956 meeting of the National Committee inaugurated
a new phase in the struggle against sectarianism. The report of Com-
rade Dennis advanced the struggle against left-sectarianism by exam-
ining the basic estimates in which the sectarian tactical line of the
Party has been rooted. The report established that the main task of
the Party in the present period was to eliminate every vestige of left-
sectarianism in policies and activities.

The roots of these errors are not to be found in the events of the
past ten years alone.

The Marxist movement in our country has suffered historically
from dogmatic application of Marxist theory to the American scene.
The Communist Party inherited these weaknesses. Insuﬂicient devel-
opment o-f the independent theoretical work of our Party over the past
decades has contributed towards our doctrinaire acceptance and me-

65

 

chanical application of many theoretical propositions.

Our Party has also suffered from an oversimpliﬁed approach to
and an uncritical acceptance of many views of Marxists and Marxist
parties in other countries.

Bureaucratic methods of leadership, failure to‘ develop inner-party
democracy and a frequent intolerant attitude to the people we worked
with have been in large measure responsible for our inability to correct
mistakes in time as well as for much of our sectarianism. All these
factors are interrelated; each helped to reinforce the other.

To advance the struggle in the United States for peace, democracy,
civil rights and socialism, the Communist Party must further develop
its independent theoretical work. It must free itself from deeply in-
grained habits of dogmatism and doctrinairism which breed sectarian-
ism, and which in turn lend encouragement to right—opportunism.

In order to succeed in this, the Party must study thoroughly the
realities of American life today, the history and traditions of our work-
ing class and people, the special features of capitalist economy and
bourgeois democracy in our country, the distinctive features of the
American road to socialism.

In carrying out this central ideological task, we should bear in
mind our Party's past errors in the direction of reuisionism and guard
against any such tendencies in the present period. This must he done
in such a way as to reinforce the struggle to overcome the main oh-
stacle which is our deeply rooted dogmatism and doctrinairism, a
struggle which is still only in its initial stages.

Marxism—Leninism is a scientiﬁc analysis of the universal and
objective laws of social development. It is the generalization of the
experience of the working class of each country and of all lands, and
like all science, is an international product. The principles. of scientiﬁc
socialism were ﬁrst put forward by Marx and Engels. They were fur—
ther developed in the imperialist era by Lenin. They were later en-
riched by contemporary Marxists in many countries. The Communist
Party bases its theory generally on the cultural heritage of mankind,
and particularly on the principles of scientiﬁc socialism developed by
Marx, Engels and Lenin. These principles the Communist Party of
the United States interprets, and applies, and strives to develop fur—
ther, in accordance with the requirements of the American class
struggle and democratic traditions. We must learn much better how
to extract from the rich body of this theory that which is universally

66

 

valid, combining it with the speciﬁc experiences of the American
working class in the struggle for socialism in the United States. In
doing this, the Party must distinguish better between those additions
to Marxist theory which are valid for all countries and those which
reﬂect exclusively certain unique features of one or another country.

Likewise, the Communist Party will have to be bolder in re—ex-
amining certain" Marxist—Leninist theories which, while valid in a
past period, may have become outdated and rendered obsolete by new
historical developments. For entirely new and unprecedented prob—
lems are emerging today which were never treated by Marx, Engels
or Lenin. They arise from. the new World situation and its impact on
all countries.

Already in response to these new developments, important new
elements have been introduced into the body of Marxist theory by
Marxists of many countries and other theoretical questions are still
under discussion. For example, we as Well as other Marxist parties
have already discarded as obsolete the thesis that war is inevitable
under imperialism. We have also rejected as incorrect the concept of
inevitable violent proletarian revolution, recognizing the possibility in
our country of a peaceful, constitutional transition to socialism. We are
in full agreement to study further the question of our theoretical and
tactical approach to war, the theory of the state, dictatorship of the
proletariat and other questions that time does not afford an opportun-
ity to resolve at this national convention.

We must undertake to make our own independent contribution
to the further development and enrichment of the theory of scientiﬁc
socialism. Creative Marxism is impossible without ceaseless re-examin-
ation and reappraisal of theory in the light of ever—changing reality.

This Convention feels that it is incorrect to continue to function
without a comprehensive and basic written program. The program
adopted in 1954 is inadequate for that purpose. Such a program. is
necessary in order to deﬁne clearly and unequivocally the viewpoint
of American Communists on all fundamental problems of the strug-
gle for socialism in the United States. The Convention instructs the
incoming National Committee to elect a program committee to begin
drafting such a document, which will be submitted to the member-
ship for general discussion.

credit alone has grown to nearly $41 billion and amounts to 15% of
all consumer disposable income——an all—time high.

The most recent economic upsurge, since 1954, has been stimulated
chieﬂy by such credit inﬂation, together with a large volume of tax
rebates and give—aways to big business. Hence, our economy today has
taken on much of the aspect of a typical speculative peace-time boom,
reminiscent in many ways_ of the boom of the twenties. The mounting
volume of credit, with its attending threat of further inﬂation, con-
tributes greatly to the underlying instability of the economy.

4. Postwar expansion of foreign investment. Today, American
investment abroad, in all forms, totals $45 billion, or four times the
pre—war level, and the proﬁts extracted (both admitted and con-
cealed) are estimated at nearly $10 billion a year. In the main branches
of American industry, proﬁts from foreign investment range from
10% of total proﬁts to as high as 50% in the case of the oil trusts.
These volumes of investment and proﬁt exceed those of all other
imperialist countries combined. (And this is in addition to the bil-
lions in extra proﬁts obtained through the super-exploitation of the
Negro people in this country.)

But these foreign investments rest on a very shaky foundation.
The growing breakdown of the colonial system and the spreading
movement for national liberation threaten the continued extraction of
these super-proﬁts and the whole parasitic structure built on imperial-
ist exploitation.

Clearly the foregoing features render the future of the economy
far less secure than depicted by those who speak for big business.

Moreover, today’s boom has by no means brought prosperity for
all.

It has not been shared by the great majority of America’s farm-
ers. From 1947 to mid-1956, farm incomes fell by one third. In 1955,
the Department of Agriculture reports, net farm income was lower
than in any year since 1940. Small and family—sized farms have de-
clined in number while corporation farms and the holdings of the big-
gest operators have increased. Added to this is the growing impact of
such natural disasters as Hood and drought——disasters contributed to
by deforestation and other destruction of natural resources by big
business interests. ' '

The persistent agricultural depression places a heavy economic
burden on the shoulders of the small marginal and family sized farm

The Communist Par’ry—|ndepende_n+ Parry of
American Workers *

The Communist Party is an independent party of American
workers dedicated to socialism. Its primary concern is for the present
and future welfare of the American people. Its only allegiance is to the
working class and people of our country. Its consistent objective is to
promote the national welfare and advance our country’s true national
interests.

The Communist Party formulates its policies independently. It is
not subject to any external allegiance or discipline either of an organ—
izational or political character.

The Communist Party works for friendship between all peoples
so that our country may prosper in a world at peace. In this spirit
it advocates friendship and cooperation between our country and the
socialist countries. This has been one of its major contributions to the
national welfare.

The Soviet Union, People’s China and the People’s Democracies
of Eastern Europe are socialist countries. The system of capitalist
exploitation has been abolished in these countries and, together with
it, the cause of poverty, fascism, war, national oppression and race
discrimination. From the beginning the Communist Party has greeted
and supported the efforts of the working people of these countries to
build a new life for themselves on socialist foundations.

Big Business tries to vilify these countries, to slander and defame
them, to incite hostility against them. In the interest of the American
people the Communist Party is concerned with nailing these lies and
exposing these slanders.

The attitude of the Communist Party to these "countries reﬂects
its devotion to the great principle of working class internationalism
which has deep roots in our country’s history. This tradition of inter-
national solidarity is a proud one. The Communist Party continues it
and considers it a badge of honor.

At the same time the Communist Party recognizes that over the
years it held certain wrong and oversimpliﬁed concepts of what its
relations should be to other Marxist parties. The Party tended to accept
uncritically many views of Marxists of other countries. Not all these
views were correct; some did not correspond to American conditions.

The Party also viewed uncritically developments in the Soviet

68

.\.W._,....._.....,w,.... .,...,. ,. ., .. . .

 

Union and other socialist countries. It mistakenly thought that any
public criticism of the views or policies of the Marxist parties of these
countries would weaken the bonds of international working class
solidarity or bring comfort to the enemies of peace and socialism.

The incorrectness of this view was highlighted by the revelations
in Khrushchev’s special report to the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
Because it held this view, the Communist Party of our country was
entirely unprepared for and deeply shocked by the admissions of
crimes, violations of socialist justice, mistreatment of certain national
minorities, and the basis for the rupture of relations with Yugoslavia
—all at variance with the truly liberating character of socialism. The
courage shown in making these disclosures and the profound process
of self—correction, begun some years ago and sharply accelerated since
the 20th Congress, are irrefutable evidence of the historic role and
vitality of the socialist system.

Socialism is strengthened, not weakened, by the fraternal and
constructive criticism of Marxists of many lands.

New problems of relations have arisen as a result of the emergence
of socialism as a world system comprising a number of national states
in place of one encircled socialist country. Serious mistakes and short-
comings in the relations between the USSR and other socialist states——
as in the examples of Poland and Hungary—have been revealed. Ef-
forts are being made to correct these mistakes and certain important
corrections have been made on the basis of a further development of
the Marxist-Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, national
independence and equality. Correction of errors in relationships be-
tween socialist states is facilitated by the fact that the fundamental
basis of such relations is common ideology, common aims, mutual
assistance and cooperation.

International working—class solidarity includes the right and re-
sponsibility to friendly criticism of brother parties or the actions of
socialist governments. At the same time it requires that such criticism
shall be within the framework of recognition that the fundamental
conﬂict of all peoples is with the forces of imperialism.

Our attitude was used to refurbish the slanderous calumny which
has been used historically against all radical movements in our coun-
try——the lie that the Communist Party is “the agent of a foreign
power.”

This despicable charge is a lie cut from the whole cloth. We are

59

 

American Communists, patrio-ts. Our allegiance is to our own ooun-
try, the United States. In representing and advancing the fundamental
welfare of the working class we aim always to serve our country’s
true national interests.

The Communist Party must continue to correct the oversimpliﬁed
relations which have existed between itself and other Marxist parties.
These relations must be based on the principles of scientiﬁc socialism,
on proletarian internationalism; they must be based on each Com-
munist Party serving the best national interests of its people and
thereby the common interests of all progressive humanity. This re-
quires the equality and independence of Marxist parties in the mutual
discussion and resolution of common problems; the right and duty of
the Communists of all countries to engage in cornradely criticism of
the policies and practices of the Communists of any country whenever
they feel this necessary. This will strengthen, not weaken, interna-
tional solidarity. It will advance the cause of socialism in all countries.

Bureaucraﬁc Concepfs of Par1'y Organizaﬁon

Bureaucratic concepts of Party organization, systems of leadership
and relations between the Party and the masses have been a prime
factor in contributing to our errors. They hindered the early and
timely correction of these errors. Wrong concepts of leadership dis-
couraged full and free participation of the membership in the discus-
sion of policy and tactics. They stood as insurmountable obstacles to
the efforts of comrades in mass organizations to challenge sectarian
policies and tactics. They contributed to the weakening of inner—party
democracy. In many cases they resulted in departure from the very
procedures established by our own constitution. They resulted in
disciplinary actions which further inhibited expressions of disagree-
ment. They made the life of the Party largely routine, devoted, at
least between pre—convention discussion periods, to the organization of
a multitude of camp-aigns characterized by inadequate examination
and testing of our policies and tactics in actual life by our members
in the shops and mass organizations.

These bureaucratic methods of work, system of leadership and
organization have been accentuated in part by the mechanical applica-
tion of certain principles of organization adopted by other Commun-
ist parties which functioned under different historical conditions.

The history of factional struggle which almost destroyed our

70

 

..___....,. ..., v.- -— -» 7

Party in its early years gave rise to a correct desire to defend Party
unity against the danger of factional splits. But this was distorted by
efforts to achieve formal unity instead of uniting the Party on the
basis of principle, a full democratic inner life and free, open discussion
of differences.

This convention must completely abolish these bureaucratic meth-
ods of work, organization and leadership. It must clearly deﬁne the
character of our Party and its proper method of organization and
functioning.

The Communist Party is an American working class political
party. It is a Party of white and Negro unity. It is devoted to the
struggle for constant advancement of the welfare of the working
class, the Negro people, the farming population, small businessmen
and professional people. Its ultimate aim is the socialist reorganiza-
tion of society in a peaceful, constitutional manner by the majority
choice of the American people.

On Vanguard Role

Our effort to advance these objectives requires that we retain the
fundamental concept of our organization as a vanguard organization,
one which is based on the scientiﬁc theory of socialism and which
strives at all times to strengthen its ties with the working class and
people, to Win their conﬁdence and support by participation in their
everyday struggles. i

The spontaneous struggles of the Working class against capitalist
exploitation can, at best, lead only to trade union consciousness. So-
cialist consciousness must be brought into the working class move-
ment by a party which is based on an advanced theory, scientiﬁc so-
cialism. Only such a party can help make the working class conscious
of itself as a class, help it grasp the relationship of class forces, the
meaning of speciﬁc struggles, the interconnection of these struggles
with the necessary and inevitable victory of socialism.

The Party of Communists always places uppermost the interests
of the entire working class and all the oppressed people. It dedicates
itself to helping the working class and its allies gain, step by step,
ever greater victories leading toward their historical goal of ending
class exploitation. This is the essence of the concept “vanguard role”
which we seek to fulﬁll.

The concrete expression of this role will o-f necessity be different

71

 

today in the presence of a powerful organized labor. movement and
Negro people’s movement than it was in the ’3o’s when these move-
ments were much smaller in size and narrower in content.

A Marxist Party which seeks to gain the conﬁdence of its class
cannot do so by arrogantly assuming that it is already the leader of
the workers. The possession of advanced theory and the ability to proj-
ect advanced ideas in the current struggles can and should lead to the
ever greater identiﬁcation of such a Marxist party with the class, and
the enhancement of its leadership role. But this is not an automatic
process.

In the past we have mechanically assumed the position of “the
leader of the working class” without regard to our real pesition of
strength and influence. This attitude hindered the very aim of provid-
ing Marxist guidance to the working class. As a result, the term “van-
guard role” assumed connotations of unrealism and arrogance, with
which we seek to break. Listening and learning rfom the workers,
particularly in their everyday struggles at the level at which they are
being waged, we strive to earn the esteem of the working class as a
foundation for effective leadership.

On Democraﬁc Cenfralism and Monolithic Uni’ry

Democracy is vital to a Communist Party. It is the method
by which the rich experience of the members of the Party and the
masses of people become available to the Party as a whole. It is this
experience and democratic participation together with the power of
Marxist analysis which enables the Party to keep Marxism from being
a dogma, and instead makes it a living, growing, developing science
with which we can serve our class and nation ever more effectively.

Whatever views may exist in our Party on the theory of demo-
cratic centralism, our concept and application in the past has led to
highly centralized forms of organization and leadership with the
democratic features of Party life subordinated. Experience has shown
that our concept of democratic centralism as we practiced it in the
past has fed a system of bureaucracy. We have tended to take over
mechanically forms of organization and practices from abroad, rather
than assimilate critically the experiences of brother parties, utilizing
what is valid and applicable to our situations and problems. All this
has helped bureaucracy to ﬂourish at the expense of inner-party de-
mocracy.

72

 

It is these concepts and practices which we seek to modify in
order to establish a foundation for a vast expansion of inner-party
democracy. We therefore propose that our Constitution shall seek to
guarantee that the will of the majority of our membership determines
all policy decisions and the election of committees. At the same time
provisions should be made for the right to dissent after decisions, while
guaranteeing our ability to act in a united way, guarding against
factionalism, federationism and parallel centers of leadership.

We must establish the broadest possibilities for democratic ex-
pression within our Party and procedures for regular review of policies
and the right to dissent even after decisions have been reached. Our
system of organization, leadership and concept of discipline must be
revised. Being a party of action, and not a debating society, we must
maintain a cohesiveness and unity so that we can be an effective force
once a policy is decided. Thus the problem is not to abandon all
forms of centralization but to ﬁnd the correct limits.

We want a maximum of internal democracy combined with the
necessary unity in action. The Draft Constitution develops proposals
that will bring our organization into harmony with the traditions and
experiences of American working class organizations and potentially
acceptable to large numbers of American workers and socialist—rninded

ilitants as the kind of organization they would want to be identiﬁed
with.

As to monolithic unity: Originally, this term meant simply a
common ideology or outlook as opposed to a mixture of ideologies. In
practice, it came to mean a rigid conformity of views on all matters
of theory, policy and tactics. The concept of a common ideology must
be retained as essential to a Marxist party. But the term should be
dropped because of the harmful practices and connotations that have
grown around it.

The Communist Party is a democratic organization based on
majority rule. It is ‘a cohesive organization for the purpose of acting
unitedly to carry out the policies and program decided by its mem-
bers. The inner life of the Party shall be regulated by the provisions
and rules of its constitution which will emerge from this Convention,
following prior discussion by the whole membership. The unfolding
of a correct mass policy by the Party, as well as its ability to attract and
hold masses of socialist-minded Americans, requires extensive changes
in its structure and methods of work. Among these are the following:

73

 

Guarantees of real inner—party democracy through provision of
channels for freedom of discussion, dissent and criticism within the
framework of carrying out the majority will.

The National Committee should issue a special publication on a
regular monthly basis devoted exclusively to articles or letters dis-
cussing, debating or differing with Party policies, whether current or
long—range. Such a publication is necessary to encourage the greatest
possible participation by the membership in the formulation, correc-
tion or abandonment of policies or tactics.

The decisions of all Party bodies shall continue to be made by
majority rule. Minorities or individuals opposed to such decisions
shall be required to abide by them. But the right of such individuals
or minorities to express their views shall be guaranteed in all cases.
However, this does not mean that factions—groupings with their own
platform, discipline, organization and publications set up in opposi-
tion to the regular program, discipline, organization and publications
of the Party—-can be tolerated. The whole history of the Communist
Party shows that factionalism actually destroys inner—party democracy
and shatters Party unity.

Between 'pre—convention discussion periods the National Commit-
tee must take special steps to involve the membership in making basic
changes in policy. Such methods may involve setting aside limited
periods for Party—wide discussion on draft policy resolutions; or con-
vening special delegated conferences with power to act on speciﬁc
questions presented beforehand to the membership; or the organiza—
tion of referendum votes on questions.

Establishment of closest ties between membership and leadership
and creation of political and organizational guarantees against bureau-
cratic separation of leadership from membership by the following:

a) Proceedings of the National Committee shall be publicized,
including digests of speeches or reports as well as votes of National
Committee members on important questions. Where possible, State
Committees shall do likewise.

b) Minutes of National Board meetings shall be circulated among
all members of the National Committee. Periodic summaries should
be sent to State Committees.

c) The National Committee should be considerably enlarged.

d), The National Committee shall meet a minimum of three times
per year, with agendas and draft documents to be discussed sent in

74

 

advance to all members.

The important and deep-going changes on questions of program,
policy and organization will expand the opportunities of our mem-
bers to work with ever larger sections of progressive Americans and
their organizations. It will provide the basis for building our Party
into an effective Marxist organization capable of coping with the chal-
lenging problems before the American working class and people.
There are no valid grounds for any destructive attitude towards the
Party’s past contributions and the vital’ role the Party has to play in
the future. Neither is there any justification for proposals to liquidate
our Party so as to “clear the way” for a broader party of socialism at
some future time. _

This convention goes on record to affirm the continuation of the
Communist Party of the USA. Our chief task is to -strengthen, rebuild
and consolidate the Communist Party and overcome its isolation.

This convention opposes the transformation of the Party into a
political or educational association.

Although we oppose endless debate on this question, this should
not close the door to all constructive exploration and discussion of the
subject as may be organized by the incoming National Committee.

We recognize that some ideas that have been brought forward in
this discussion are revisionist in character. However, it would be wrong
to label all proposals for change in name and form as revisionist per se.

The People's Struggles Today

It should be our concern to help the labor and people’s move-
ments bring the decisive issues to the forefront and Win. significant
gains.

High among these issues is the people’s standard of living: job
security, farm income, the high cost of living, the crisis in schools,
housing ' and health, the chronic poverty of one-ﬁfth of the nation,
segregation and discrimination.

The new outburst of struggles in the South again highlights the
central importance of the civil rights struggle of the Negro people and
their allies. Therefore we demand full equality in jobs, housing, educa-
tion and political representation, and the abolition of all forms of
segregation.

Vital questions affecting the civil liberties of all Americans are at

75

 

issue before the -Supreme Court, Congress and the Administration:
the Taft—Hartley Act, the “loyalty” program, the Smith Act, the Mc-
Carran Act, the McCarran—Walter Act and the demand for amnesty
for Smith Act prisoners. These require the rallying of the American
people to regain their lost liberties and defend the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.

Above all, the people’s profound desire for peace and an end to
the cold war calls for concrete steps toward disarmament and a policy
of peaceful coexistence: for an end to H—bomb tests, for drastic cuts
in the arms budget and the like. .

In the struggles around these issues in the shops and communities
our concern at all times must be to help strengthen and unite the
organizations of labor and the people. It must be to help build under
labor’s leadership an ever more eﬁective people’s coalition directed
against the great monopolies and striving to elect a people’s anti—
monopoly government.

Our Party stretches out its hand to all workers and the whole
American people in the fellowship of common struggle for the goal of
peace, democracy and social progress.

RESOLUTION ON SOCIAL DEMOCRACY*

Social Democracy continues to be a major inﬂuence in the labor
and people’s movements of almost all capitalist countries. It plays a
signiﬁcant role in a number of colonial and semi—colonial countries. In
our country, while the actual Social Democratic organizations and
their inﬂuence are relatively small, reformism in its speciﬁc American
form is the decisive inﬂuence in the labor and people’s movement.

It is clear, therefore, that a correct attitude towards Social Democ-
racy and other reformist organizations and movements is most essential
to our Party. Without it, it is impossible to overcome our sectarianism,
to break out of our isolation and to effectively advance the struggle
either for our immediate objectives or our socialist aims. In the past
we suffered both from a woeful underestimation of the role and
inﬂuence of Social Democracy and other reformist trends, as well as
from a narrow sectarian policy towards them.

The very terms Social Democrat and Social Democracy were used
by us almost exclusively in a derogatory fashion. While we did take a
very positive position towards reforms under capitalism, our use of
the term reformist only in a derogatory manner sometimes tended to
give the impression that We feared or opposed many reforms because
they might strengthen capitalism. Quite often, by centering our main
criticism against the Social Democratic and other reformist leaders of
the labor, Negro and other people’s organizations, we weakened the
necessary unity against the common enemy.

By the thesis that it is essential to smash all Social Democratic
organizations as a condition to win the masses to socialism, we weak-
ened both the unity in the immediate struggle and the winning of the
workers to the socialist goal. By adopting a policy of striving towards
the liquidation rather than the cooperation of the Social Democratic
organizations, we undermined rather than promoted the united front
of the Communists and Socialists. Most of these errors were common to
the world Communist movement and their harmful effect was most
sharply expressed in the characterization of Social Democracy as
social fascism at the very moment when fascism was menacing the
entire working class and all its organizations and trends. In the middle
’3o’s these errors were corrected in part. This resulted in many positive
experiences in the anti—fascist struggles of that period.

A speciﬁc error prevailing for many years in our Party was the
theory of “skipping over the reformist stage,” which grew out of the
fact that the Social Democratic organizations, as well as the trade
unions, were relatively weak in our country. This led to the theory
that the Communists would thus lead the workers in organizing trade
unions, a labor party, etc., free of reformist leadership. This attitude
was carried over in other ﬁelds of work, including the Negro liberation
movement. Remnants of this theory are still prevalent. It is one of the
speciﬁc manifestations of our sectarianism, and a complete break with
this “skipping over” theory is essential for a successful struggle against it.

While there is no mass Social Democratic Party in the USA, it
would be a mistake to underestimate the inﬂuence of the existing
Social Democratic groups, trends and organizations, whose inﬂuence
is far greater than their mere number or current activities in their own
name. The trade union movement, now grown to more than 16 mil—
lion members, is led primarily by labor and social reformists whose
policies determine the program of the trade union movement.

operators, and the outbreak of a general crisis would have a catastroph-
ic eﬁ’ect on the small farmers. For never before was the agricultural
economy so closely bound up with the country’s industrial and ﬁnan-
cial life, and never was it under such sharp pressure from monopoly.

One-ﬁfth of a nation suﬁ'ers poverty in the midst of plenty; one
family in ﬁve earns less than $2,000 a year-—that is, less than $40 a
week. ‘Among Negro families, the proportion is more than two in
ﬁve. Ten million American children live in slums. In the midst of
the boom, the country is dotted with distressed areas and “sick” indus-
tries plagued by high unemployment.

Despite the record national employment, the rise in production
since 1954 has brought no corresponding rise in factory jobs. The auto
workers, during the past year, suffered an alarming growth in unem-
ployment, with 100,000 of those laid off still not absorbed at the cur-
rent peak of production. And with the further extension of automa-
tion and increased productivity, unemployment threatens to spread
further.

Nor has small business ﬂourished in recent years. The rise in
proﬁts has been concentrated in the biggest corporations, and bank-
ruptcies of small business ventures have reached their highest rate
since 1939. A

The chief beneﬁciaries of the boom have been the giant trusts
and monopolies. The year 1955, says Fortune, was “very deﬁnitely the
best year ever for big business.”

The monopolies have continued to grow and to become ever
more powerful. Today, the 500 largest industrial corporations account
for about half of all production and employment. These giants rake
in the lion's share of the proﬁts. In the ﬁrst quarter of 1956, proﬁts
per dollar of sales for the biggest companies (those with assets of
$100,000,000 or more) were nearly ﬁve times those of the smaller
companies (with assets under $250,000). And under the Cadillac
Cabinet, with its give-aways and its policies favoring big business,
mergers are taking place at a higher rate than ever before.

The enormous proﬁts of the trusts are obtained at the expense
of the workers, the small farmers and‘ small business. Though real
Wages are rising, they have not kept pace with the rise in productivity
or the still greater growth of corporate proﬁts, and the worker’s share
in his product thus continues to decline.

Hence, despite the prolonged prosperity and despite the signiﬁcant

To a degree, the cooperation of labor reformists (trade union
leaders who stand for capitalism and with no socialist background or
traditions), social reformists (those labor leaders who have a socialist
background), and bourgeois reformists (liberal wing of the Demo—
cratic Party) in such organizations as Americans for Democratic
Action is, in the absence of a mass Social Democratic Party in the
U.S., and under the conditions prevailing in our country, performing
the function of Social Democracy.

We should not push this comparison too far. But it can emphasize
for us the fact that we do have the inﬂuence of reformism in our
country, even though it is not identical with that of most of the other
capitalist countries. We also can see from this that correcting the previ-
ous error that we have no problem of Social Democracy or reformism
in this country should not result in labelling every reformist a Social
Democrat. .

It is erroneous to think that the American workers and their allies
will create an anti-monopoly coalition and establish an anti-monopoly
government without the trade unions and other reformist-led organi-
zations being the very basis for such a movement. This does not mean
that all reformist leaders will readily support such a movement and
objectives or that many of them will not offer strong resistance to it.
It will be a steady struggle in which the masses will push forward
because of necessity and the experience they will gain in the course
of the developing struggles on immediate issues. It will be a struggle
that will inevitably result in differentiation within the leadership of the
trade unions and other mass organizations. , A

In this developing struggle for the anti-monopoly coalition the
more advanced forces of the labor and people’s movement can and
should play a most important and essential role. This is why, among
other reasons, there is need for strengthening our own Party. This is
one of the tasks that can be performed by the cooperation of the Com-
munists and other socialist—oriented forces in the labor and people’s
movement. Such cooperation, as well as united action in defense of
peace, civil liberties, equal rights and economic security will no doubt
facilitate clariﬁcation of ideological questions among many and pro-
mote the movement for a broader united Marxist Party in our coun-
try. .
We must be on guard against confusing the need for a labor—
people’s anti-monopoly coalition with the perspective for a broader

78

 

 

lW"‘II-1

united Marxist Party. In some Left circles outside our ranks, such
confusion can already be noted. Lack of clarity on this question can
lead to a narrow sectarian position towards the anti—monopoly coali-
tion and an opportunist position on a united Marxist Party. It is clear
that these movements will develop simultaneously. They will gen-
erally support each other, objectively. But they must be seen as distinct
movements with distinct objectives. Obviously, all those favoring and
striving for anti-monopoly goals to be achieved under capitalism can
be won for the first. Only those favoring socialism can be won for
the latter. p '

Our emphasis on a new approach to Social Democracy and re-
formism generally is not based upon and does not imply the opportun-
ist idea of the disappearance of all differences between the Commun-
ists and Social Democrats, between the Marxists and reformist trends
in the world labor movement and here in the USA. The new approach
is ﬁrst a recognition of a new situation, new relations of forces, new
tasks, ﬁrst and foremost being that of preventing a third world war.
It flows from the fact that in the present situation, the paramount is-
sues confronting the labor movement are the defense of peace, na-
tional freedom and democracy.

Our new approach does recognize past errors as well as narrowing
of differences. On a world scale the new theoretical proposition that
wars are no longer inevitable under present conditions does not auto-
matically wipe out the danger of war, but on the other hand places
new emphasis “on the need for and the possibility for cooperation on
the part of all workers’ organizations in defense of peace. Without
question, our renewed emphasis——now also adopted by the world
Communist movement—on a peaceful and constitutional road to
socialism, removes one of the major differences of the past. Our
Party’s new approach to civil liberties now, and our pledge to preserve
and extend the Bill of Rights under socialism should remove one of
the major barriers toward cooperation with those socialists who really
strive to achieve democratic socialism.

Our position on the po-ssibility of socialism being achieved through
the cooperation of a number of workers’ and other democratic peo-
ple’s parties, as Well as the continuance of a multi—party system under
socialism, so long as the people desire this, is another major step in
the direction of cooperation of all Marxist and socialist-oriented forces
NOW and towards the ultimate creation of a broader united Marxist

party. Our abandonment of an idealistic, uncriticalattitude towards
the lands of socialism, for one of a more mature and critical support
of their socialist achievement and contribution to world peace and the
strengthening of the world labor movement, should greatly strengthen
our Party’s ability to promote true internationalism’ generally, and win
support for a better understanding of the socialist world among the
socialist—minded workers.

The ideological differences that divide the Social Democrats from
the Communists remain fundamental and numerous. Here we refer
not to certain groupings like the Nenni Socialists in Italy, like G. D.
H. Cole in Britain, or some like those grouped around the Monthly
Review here. We refer to the ofﬁcial Social Democratic movement, its
main leaders in such countries as Britain, France, West Germany, etc.,
and those in the U.S.A. who occupy the same place in the political
spectrum. And we limit ourselves to ideological differences and do not
speak of such obvious differences as those of the policies of the French
Socialists (now the government party) in Algeria or Egypt, or similar
differences with Social Democrats in our country.

These differences include their rejection in whole or in part of dia-
lectical and historical materialism; their adherence to class collabora-
tion as against the class struggle; their rejection in practice of
internationalism, exempliﬁed, among other things, in the negative
attitude to the USSR and the other socialist lands; differences exist
on such important matters as the national and agrarian questions,
colonialism, imperialist war, the role of the working class, the role of
the Marxist party of the working class and the allies of the working
class.

Among those who still formally adhere to the aim of socialism,
it is conceived as the end product of a series of capitalist reforms and
not as a radical transformation of society, and hence our difference
with them is not merely one of how socialism is to be achieved. And
on this question too, our conception of the peaceful and constitutional
road to socialism is not identical with the classic “parliamentary road”
put forward by the Social Democrats and which has as yet nowhere
led to the establishment of socialism.

In our conception the struggles of the people, the role of the
workers and their allies is a basic factor at every stage of the struggle
to achieve the radical reorganization of society, in creating the condi-
tions for the people’s parliamentary victory, for carrying out of the

80

people’s will. All this shows that while we have much in common
with Social Democracy and this must be emphasized, many funda-
mental differences remain.

Our new approach however, is not based on these differences. It
is dictated by new possibilities and paramount needs, despite these

differences. While we should develop the most thorough and friendly-

discussion on all questions, including ideological differences, trying
to ﬁnd basic agreement where and with whom we can, it is on the
basis of the vital issues now confronting the workers and their allies
that we must strive to ﬁnd the basis for unity. In this way life itself
will contribute towards‘ dissolving or resolving many differences which
discussion alone will not achieve. And even where differences remain,
we must learn to disagree in a new way. We must not take the posi-
tion that we have all the answers and have nothing to learn. This in-
cludes all questions, theoretical, political and organizational.

We should look upon the Social Democratic organizations, includ-
ing their elected leaders, as workers’ organizations. We must deal with
these organizations fraternally, and not as enemies. WE STRIVE

FOR THEIR COOPERATION, NOT LIQUIDATION. Such co—"

operation will be beneﬁcial to all ‘who participate and to the working
class as_ a whole.

efforts of the new features which have emerged in the American
economy, the basic contradictions inherent in capitalist production are
not abating but are becoming sharper. The fundamental factors mak-
ing for economic crisis continue to operate today, no less than in the
boom of the twenties—in particular, the basic factor which Marx
described as “the tendency of capitalist production to develop the
productive forces as if only the absolute power of consumption of the
entire society would be their limit,” while the actual purchasing power
of the masses remains relatively restricted and lags increasingly be-
hind.

The boom, with its growing credit inﬂation, only conceals the
sharpening contradiction between the forces of production and the
capitalist relations under which they are operated-a contradiction
which can be ﬁnally resolved in the people’s interests only through
the establishment of a socialist society. The Marxist theory of crisis
is not invalidated by the prolonged period of prosperity.

In assessing the postwar economic developments, the Party was
correct in giving special weight to the effects of extensive growth in
military expenditures. However, in 1945, 1949 and 1954, we incor-
rectly predicted that the then current declines would develop into
crises of major proportions. A .

At times, the Party gave a one—sided appraisal of the eﬁects of the
arms program. It overlooked the extent of continuing investments
in ﬁxed capital to replace, expand or modernize equipment which
had worn out or become obsolete since the last major cycle of ﬁxed
capital renewal in the thirties. Together with this, it failed to size up
adequately the level of commercial and residential construction, the
scope of unsatisﬁed consumer demand, the possibilities of credit ex-
pansion, and the government’s tax program of rebates, rapid write-offs
and lowered excess proﬁts taxes.

At the root of these mistakes has been our acceptance of the cr-
roneous thesis, widely prevalent among Marxists in all countries, that
in the postwar stage of the general crisis of capitalism no signiﬁcant
peace-time expansion of capitalist production would be possible. This
contributed to a one-sided and incomplete study of economic data.
At the same Time, our inadequate attention to the new and speciﬁc
features of the American economy led to the application of the
Marxian theory of crisis in a routine, formal and doctrinaire manner.
