imperialist war. In this war the right was on the side of the
Americans, the Russians, the British and the other allies.
A Communist patriot wants to liberate his own country from
all forms of oppression, exploitation and backwardness, but
he will never side with his own native reaction and im-
perialism in their aggressions against or exploitation of other
peoples.

“Foreign Agent”——An Old Nazi Accusation

This is one of the reasons why very often we Communists
are called foreign agents by imperialists and their hirelings
and by fools. For instance, we German Communists were
called foreign agents by the Nazis and their henchmen because
we fought with all our force against the aggression of Hitler
against other peoples. German imperialists and Nazis
especially called us agents of Stalin, agents of the Soviet Union,
because we tried to explain to the -Germans that to make war
against the Soviet Union instead of keeping friendship with
the Soviet people is not only a terrible crime, but must lead to
the worst national catastrophe in history for the German
people. Of course German Communists and progressives were
also often called American and British agents by the Nazis,
because we thought your country and your allies deserved

victory. To have shown sympathy for President Roosevelt in -

Nazi Germany meant to gamble with one’s life. In your
country, fortunately, it costs at present only one’s job if some
official or a janitor in a. government building dares to show
some sympathy for Joseph Stalin and the Soviet people. The
German Red-baiters, the German Nazi dictatorship, this most
developed form of a Committee against so-called un-German
activities, were victorious over us Reds, over the German
workers and all other progressive elements in Germany, and
led the Germans down the road to the abyss.

If I may advise you, take a lesson from the terrible ex-‘
periences of Germany. I know you have the habit of slander-
mg your own Communists as -foreign agents just as Himmler

‘ 1o -

\.

slandered us German Communists, because they ﬁght for
friendship with the Soviet Union. As a German I advise you
urgently‘ not to listen to your warmongers. It would be very
terrible for you, for the Russians and for the whole world.
As a German I have a special interest in hoping that your
warmongering fools will be kept under lock and key. I do
not want to imagine what would remain of the remainder of
Germany in a new terrible war; I am afraid nothing but a
kind of New Mexican atom bomb desert.

Before Hollywood makes the picture, “The Song of Budenz,”
they should make sure of him. Because he isn't a saint and
he lies like the devil. I don’t know whether he has started to
love his enemies as the Bible prescribes, but he sure tries to
stab his former political friends in the back in the way of
Judas Iscariot. I never met that man Budenz and I never
wanted to meet him; I never sent Budenz a letter, a note, an
article, even a word. All he has told you about this is nothing
but lies, inventions and provocations. Certainly I could have
met him by accident as I.met other people, but of all the
misfortunes I had in my life, this misfortune did not hit me.

Now let me tell you how it happened that I am here in the
United States.

Budenz told you I am not a genuine political refugee, but
that I came to the United States to boss all the Reds. I quote

p Budenz from his testimony on November 22, 1946:

He—that means me—just makes the claim he came
here on transit visa, on his way to Mexico. He claimed
he was on his way to Mexico. But he could not get
into Mexico. He says because Austrians and Germans
were not admitted. I think anyone who would per-
jure himself on his political status to get into America
would perjure himself as to his nationality if he
wanted to get into Mexico. The general inference is
the United States was where he wanted to land.

The general inference is, of course, quite different from
that which Budenz claims.

What are the facts? Shortly.before the ‘outbreak of the war,
in 1939,. I with many thousand other anti-fascist refugees were
arrested in Paris. The men of Munich who were leading
France into disaster arrested us because we were genuine
anti-fascists. Many of us had fought as so-called premature
anti-fascists on the Loyalist side in Spain. The men of Munich
were naturally not softhearted in their treatment of foreign
anti-fascist refugees. In their prisons and concentration camps,
especially in the infamous camp of Vernet, we were beaten,
starved, abused and not a few of us were killed. Then the
Nazi armies started to overrun France. To all the misery we
suffered was added the danger that we would be extradited to
Hitler Germany to be tortured and killed.

I remember very well our discussions in the camp of Vernet.
Neither I nor anyone else discussed how to overthrow the
American government, nor did I make any plans how to boss

. all the American Reds; neither did I have the slightest idea

that I would, after the war, have to appear before any-
thing like the Un-American Activities Committee in order to
defend myself against the provocations of American rats and
ﬁght for my return home. What we discussed was how to
remain ﬁrm under the torture of the Gestapo.

Mexican Government Offered Aid

In those critical days there came help. The then President
of Mexico, General Cardenas, sent to many of us an invitation
to come to Mexico for sanctuary. The diplomatic repre—
sentatives of Mexico in France intervened strongly in our
behalf. Also many decent Americans demanded from Vichy
the right for refugees of all creeds and political -opinions to
leave France.

As a result, I and many others were sent from Vernet to
another concentration camp near Marseilles in order to pre-
pare our departure for Mexico. The Mexican consul-general
in Marseilles, Mr. Bosquez, gave me and "other refugees
Mexican substitutes for passports, but there were new diﬂi-

12

culties. No boat at that time left from Marseilles directly to
Mexico. Very few French boats sailed at all because the British
had captured the boats of Vichy France. The French authori-

ties would grant us exit permits to leave -for Mexico only on ‘

condition that we obtain transit visa through the United
States. The reason for this was that French boats went only
to Martinique and from Martinique -no connection with
Mexico existed. We would have to travel from Martinique to
Mexico via the United States. The French did not want us in
Martinique so they wanted to make absolutely sure we would
leave for Mexico by way of the United States.

American Transit Permit Granted

For months we tried to secure transit visa through the
United States. The American consul-general at ﬁrst blocked

our journey to Mexico by refusing us transit v'isa. The French V

authorities threatened to send us back to Vernet, which meant

into the hands of the Gestapo. The Mexican consul-general.
‘in Marseilles, a Catholic—I shall never forget his human

attitude toward us—did. everything to convince the American
consul-general to grant us transit visa. He emphasized that
the President of Mexico, General Cardenas, had invited us per-
sonally and that America had no right to practically nullify
this invitation of the Mexican government.

At last the American consul-general granted transit visa to
me and other refugees, among them Communists of different
countries- We were told we would not be allowed to go on
shore in the United States, which was perfectly all right with
us. Those among us whowere Communists were advised by
men who knew the immigration laws of the United States
not to write into the application forms for a transit visa that
we were Communists, because that would have made it
technically absolutely impossible for the American consul-
general to grant us even a transit visa.

In the choice between death at the hands of the Nazis and
not to write in these application forms that we were Com-

. 13

munists, I and other Communists of different lands chose the
latter. But I never denied in the United States that I am a
Communist. I am proud to be one. .- A

What would everyone of you have done in such a situation?
What would a Budenz have done? Well, maybe he would have
gone over to the Nazis as a solution. In any case I do not think
there is a jury in this country who would call this perjury and
declare me guilty. The F.B.I., the Justice Department, the
Immigration authorities, the State Department—they knew
about these facts for many years. They didn't do anything
about it; they granted me an exit permit at the end of July,
1946. Apparently they are not convinced as is Budenz, the
so-called Christian, that a German anti-fascist would rather
die at the hands of the Nazis than violate the red tape of the
immigration laws of the United States, which at times has very
inhuman aspects. This red tape was responsible for the death
of many innocent people in Europe who could have been
saved. ‘

In the middle of May, 1941, _I and many others left
Marseilles on the French boat, “Winnipeg,” bound for
M‘artinique.'Despite Budenz, we left as refugees in the ordi-
nary sense of the word. Alas, as so often happens in time of
war, something unexpected happened. Not very far from
Martinique our boat was captured by a Dutch cruiser and
brought to Trinidad in the West Indies. Again we were put
into a concentration camp'where we were carefully screened
by the British military authorities. They were not interested
in whether someone was a‘ Communist, Social Democrat, or
a Catholic; they wanted to know whether we were genuine
German anti-fascists. Those recognized as such were allowed
to leave. I was among them. ‘

Arrived in New York, June 13, 1941

‘But again the old trouble——no boat from Trinidad to
Mexico. We had to take an American boat for New York and
change there for Mexico. And so I arrived in the port of New

14

  
  
 

York on the S.S. “Evangeline” on June 13, 1941. Those of us
headed for Mexico were brought to Ellis Island. The Yugo-
slavs, Hungarians and Czechs among us were allowed to pro-
ceed on the next boat to Mexico. Those of us who were Ger-
mans or Austrians had toremain at Ellis Island. There existed

an emergency law directed against German Bundists and

Italian fascists, prohibiting their departure from the United
States to any Latin-American country. This law, unfortu-
nately, made no distinction between German and Italian
'anti-fascists.and fascists. So I with other German anti-fascists
had to stay at Ellis Island for two and one-half months, until
the authorities decided what to do with us. I was ﬁnally re-

, leased from Ellis Island on bail with the right to stay in this

country for sixty days. During these sixty days I again asked
for permission to go to Mexico. Again it was refused. So I
had to stay here during the war whether I liked it or not, as
an ordinary refugee. ’ '

Never Wanted to Remain Here

My transit visa was changed to a visitor visa. On May 25,
1945 immediately after the downfall of Hitler, I with seven-
teen other German anti-fascist refugees applied to the State
Department for permission to return to Germany. Again we
were refused. Time after time we -repeated our plea. We
applied to all other embassies of the occupying powers—for
a long time without success. Then, at last, the Soviet govern-
ment granted me and other German anti-fascists a transit visa
through Russia in order to proceed to Berlin or Leipzig where
I lived and worked before Hitler came to power.

The State Department granted me an exit permit on July
31, 1946. Before it was granted the F.B.I. questioned me for
many hours. It was only in October that I was able to get a
place on a boat. I was to sail on October 18, 1946. My bag-
gage was already cleared and partially on the boat, when on
October 16 I found out by accident that my exit permit was

15

cancelled without reason given. But I found out soon that
Budenz and your Committee had been the reason.

That is the story of how it happened that I am in this
country. It is a matter of official record; all documents are in
l my possession, and the authorities—the F.B.I., the State Depart-
}, ‘ment, and the Immigration authorities——know it is so. They
@ know I came here by accident, that I did everything possible
‘ to go to Mexico, and as soon as it was possible, to leave for
Germany. Budenz is nothing but a cheap liar when he tries

came here on anyone’s order, or through anyone’s inﬂuence.
 Neither the Pope, nor Stalin, nor Churchill, nor Roosevelt, nor
Fulton Sheen, nor anyone else had a hand in my being here.

i - What did I do during my enforced stay in this country?
4 Whatever it was I alone am responsible. No ‘government of
 any state, neither the Vatican, Great Britain, the Soviet Union
H ‘ nor any international organization had anything to do with
‘El _ any of my activities. During my stay in this country I remained
[l a man responsible only to himself. I never had any trouble
5 . with the American authorities; although a forced guest in this
‘ country, I kept the rules a guest is supposed to keep.

Wrote for Anti-Nazi German-American

l

 I have told you of my position as a German anti-fascist in
l regard to the war. I have tried to tell you that I was uncondi-
: tionally for the victory of the American and allied arms in the
war. I admired very much the late President Roosevelt, and I
considered anyone who tried to weaken the war effort of the
American people a traitor to the great cause of humanity’s
ﬁght' against German fascism and the Japanese Pearl Harbor
scoundrels.

By profession a journalist and writer, I tried to put my pen
in the service of the cause of the allies. Soon after the entrance
of the United States into the war, the late Dr. Kurt Rosenfeld,
former Prussian Minister of Justice and for many years a

16

 

5 to tell you that I came here in order to boss the Reds, that If

member of the Social-Democrat faction of the German Reichs- V

  

tag, founded together with other Americans the German
language .paper, the German-American. Dr. Rosenfeld, a
political refugee, became a citizen of your country. Although
I had many political differences with him in Germany (I was
a Communist, he a Social-Democrat), he was a‘ very good
friend of mine. He was my lawyer when I was in prison in
Germany, and he did everything he could in the United
States to help us German anti-fascists in the concentration
camps and prisons in France. He asked me if I would be ready
to write regularly for the German-American, a non—Com-
munist paper. Its main purpose was to counteract Nazi and
Bundist inﬂuences among German-Americans, and to con-

vince ‘them of the necessity of the total defeat of Hitler Ger- "

many and for support of the allied war effort. I agreed readily
and became a voluntary staff writer on the German-Ameri-
can, where I wrote my articles unsigned and signed. I signed
the name of Gerhart Eisler or my initials. After Dr. Rosen-
feld’s death, the trade unionist, Mr. Gustav Faber, became
the editor—in-chief. He asked me to continue my work which
I did.

The German-American, I believe, has a good war record.
It won citations for extraordinary activities in war bond
drives and in the campaigns for blood donations, and the
military authorities consented to its distribution in the
German prisoner of war camps in the United States for edu-
cation and enlightenment. I am not ashamed of the work I
did for the German-American. It helped, it did not harm
the American war effort.

With two other German political refugees I wrote the book
The Lesson of Germany, an evaluation of 400 years of German
history, in order to help the American public understand how
fascism could take power in Germany. I also did research

work for magazines and for people who lectured. I did every-,

thing I could to mobilize help for political anti-fascist refugees
and for inmates of concentration camps.
And now I come to Hans Berger. This terrible Hans Berger!

17

 

 

  

Budenz and a few people of his type have made quite a living
telling stories about Hans Berger.

The Tale of Hans Berger

I was asked by Mr. Joseph Starobin, foreign editor of the
Daily Worker, whether I would write from time to time for
the Communist press about my German and European ex-
periences. Under normal conditions I would have done it. I
would have written under my name. But it was war; I was a
German, a Communist in a country whose authorities don’t
like their own Communists very much, and foreign Com-
munists still less. I didn’t want to have any scandal, I didn’t
want to give the professional Red-baiters in this country am-
munition for raising hell. I agreed readily to give Mr. Starobin
my material, my ideas and knowledge, especially about Ger-
man and European questions, for whatever use he could
make of them. Many refugee journalists did this and many
American journalists accepted such help. Mr. Starobin did
not like my proposal; he did not want to write and sign
articles for which he had not done all the work. We ﬁnally
made a compromise. Whenever he used my material, my re-
search and some of my ideas he would write the articles under
the ‘pen name of Hans Berger. He proposed this German-
sounding name because 90 per cent of all the Hans Berger
articles dealt with Germany. In many cases I saw the articles
only after they were printed. Not always, of course, did I agree
with everything written. But the articles were his responsi-
bility and in general they were very good.

This is the truth about Hans Berger; a name which I never
used in my writings, a name which I did not use as a
pseudonym for my person, and a name that was only used
as a pen name by Mr. Starobin for the product of his literary
collaboration with me. .

I want to repeat that it is not true that I came to this

- country as a so-called agent of the Communist International.

The Communist International was dissolved 1943 in- form
‘ 18


i

 

and in fact. The Communist International was never an
illegal organization and does not exist as an illegal organiza-

_ tion now. The Communist International during the time of '

its existence spoke very openly before the whole world—too
openly in the opinion of its adversaries. It never made a secret
of its policy and decisions. Exactly in order to be able to
function openly and not underground, Moscow was chosen
as headquarters for the Communist International. The choice
of Moscow, however, did not make the Communist Interna-
tional an instrument of the Soviet state, anymore than the
choice of the United States as headquarters for the United

Nations makes this organization an instrument of the Ameri-
can state. '5

Communist Party Not a Conspiracy

A Communist party is not a conspiracy. It acts in the open
and makes no secret of its adherence to an international
organization of the workers. On the contrary, it defends such
aﬂiliation against all attacks and explains the reasons for it.
If such a party ends its affiliation it states the reasons publicly.
Only where reaction makes open political work impossible by
suppressing all civil liberties, does a" Communist party go
underground. Under Himmler nobody was fool enough to
stand up to be counted as a Communist in order to make it
easier for the Gestapo to ﬁnd him out, to torture and to kill
him, and to deprive his family of all means of existence. To
make this still clearer I will give you another example. If, for
instance, Mr. Rankin were to order the Negroes in Georgia,
who I am sure are very hostile toward the barbarian theory
and practice of the white supremacy doctrine, to stand up to
be counted, they would do this only if they were sure that to
stand up did not mean to be lynched.

Of course, in all such cases the time- ﬁnally comes when
the suppressed and persecuted stand up not to be counted,
but to beat their suppressors and persecutors. And history
decides usually who is counting whom: the American

THE PROTEST

_Brought before the Thomas-Rankin Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee in Washington on Feb.
6, 1947, Gerhart Eisler, a prisoner ﬂanked by
two U. S. security oﬂicers, insisted on reading
a statement of protest of his treatment before
being sworn as a witness. The Committee denied
him the right. His refusal to be sworn until he
could read the statement led to his citation for
contempt of Congress.

This is the protest, hand-written in jail, .the
Committee would not allow him -to read:

I am not a free man at present. I am an anti-fascist, political
I was arrested two days ago without a warrant being shown
to me.

I have no doubt that this arrest was instigated by the Un-
American Activities Committee. It whistled and the Attorney
General jumped obediently and put the law into the service
of Thomas and Rankin. A

The reasons for'my arrest are clear:

I. The Un-American Activities Committee wants to prevent
me from telling in public meetings the truth about the mali-

I cious invention of Budenz, the turncoat and provocateur.

2. The Committee wants to create the false impression that
I had to be arrested in order to appear before the hearing.

As a German Communist, I always had only contempt for
my jailers. And the more so when they do their dirty business
behind the hypocritical mask of so-called democrats.

Let the American people and the world beware of American
reaction so cynically represented by the Un-American Activi-
ties Committee and their obedient servants in. high authority.

On the Character of Expert Witnesses

I think it would 11ot be bad, even if you don’t like Marxists
and Communists, to really know what they stand for, especially
if you think about persecuting them. In such cases it is better
to go to the sources than to the turncoats. N(I)ody would have
asked Benedict Arnold to be a specialist of the ideas of the

American revolution and to write its history. Nobody should.

ask a fanatical Mohammedan if he wants to learn the truth
about Christianity. Nobody who wants to know the truth
about Communists should listen to a Budenz.

The dissolution of the Communist International was not a
trick but a real dissolution. It was dissolved by all the Com-
munist parties in the world which belonged to it at that time.
It was not done in order to satisfy or appease the eternal Red-
baiters for they never will be satisﬁed or appeased; they will
only be beaten. It was done to facilitate co-operation between
the-different parties of the working class and all progressive
elements in the ﬁght against fascism and reaction. I_ repeat,
whatever Budenz says, the Communist International does not
exist anymore. And I am sure, if in time to come the parties
of the working class should decide to create a new Interna-
tional, it would be done in the open, before the whole world,
with a program known to everyone; before the eyes of the
workers and not behind their backs; not in secret, not with
so-called agents and bosses and other kindsiof mystery men a.
la Hollywood, police brains and stool—pigeons. Personally I
hope, if such a new International should come about, it will
not be anymore only a Communist International, an Interna-

20

tional with only Communist parties, but an International of
united working class parties of every land in the world.

I think I have given you all the facts pertaining to mycase.
That means I have given you a clear negative answer to the
question whether I am a foreign agent, a spy, the “boss” of all
the Reds in this country, as some idiots have asserted. There is
nothing essential I left outl

I am fully conscious of the fact that I had to speak under
oath. And therefore I tried to speak to the best of my
knowledge.

“Let Me Go Back in Peace”

If you have listened to me without too much bias, you will
stop persecuting me and let me go in peace where I came
from. Germany needs every anti-fascist in the ﬁght for the
creation of a new, peaceful, democratic Germany.

In order to save you time when it comes to questioning I
shall tell you what I am not going to answer:

First: With the exception of Mr. Joseph Starobin, who gave
me permission to reveal our literary agreement, I shall not
mention any names. Not the name of a friend, and not the
name of even a casual acquaintance of mine, not even the
name of my laundryman. No American shall, because he
knows me, become an object for blacklists, smear campaigns
and slanders. This is a point of honor with me. We German
Communists always considered scoundrels those who helped
reaction make life miserable for anyone.

Second: I do not think I am already so old that I have to
write or tell my memoirs. If it comes to it_I shall not forget
you. But at present I shall not give you in detail my biography
and my activities in the ﬁght against reaction during my life-
time. After all, this ﬁght is not over yet. I do not consider you
as my fathers. confessor. I don't trust reactionaries. But I have
told you everything pertaining to the accusations directed
against me. Nothing essential in this regard is missing.

It is enough for you to ‘know that I am since my youth a

INTRODUCTION

MY SIDE OF THE STORY is the defense Gerhart Eisler had pre-
pared for his appearance under subpoena February 6, 1947,
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He
had planned to submit this statement in the course of his tes-
timony. However, he was arrested on February 4 by the De-
partment of Justice when Representative J. Parnell Thomas,
chairman of the Committee, requested the Attorney General

 

to place him under surveillance. He was held at Ellis Island -

as a dangerous enemy alien and brought to Washington for
the hearing under guard. c

Under these circumstances Mr. Eisler refused to be sworn
for questioning by the Committee until permitted to read a
two minute protest. Permission was refused. The House of
Representatives cited him for contempt of Congress on Feb-
ruary 18, and he was later indicted.

Mr. Eisler has since been moved to the Federal House of
Detention in New York, where he is denied liberties accorded
to Nazis at Ellis Island. _

The Civil Rights Congress has undertaken a campaign for
Mr. Eisler’s defense on_the grounds that he is unlawfully held,
that he is not an enemy alien (he was given complete freedom
here throughout the war period), and that far from being in
contempt of Congress, - the Committee itself violated demo-
cratic procedures and plain American decencyﬁ

The defense of Mr. Eisler, and the demand for his release

to return to his homeland with his wife, is part of C.R.C.’s -

3

 

  

larger campaign for the abolition of the Thomas-Rankin
Committee. More and more Americans are reaching the be-
lief that this Committee represents a grave menace to our
constitutional‘ and democratic liberties. C.R.C. will defend, as
in the past, all those victimized by this most un—American
committee, be they outstanding Americans or an anti-fascist
refugee and German Communist, as is Mr. Eisler.

MY SIDE 017 THE STORY is published in the interests of Ameri-
can fair play. Mr. Eisler provided the newspapers, press ser-
vices and magazines with copies; but ignoring his story, they
have preferred the lurid views and alleged facts of the Un-
American Activities Committee and its odd assortment of
witnesses. _

As the new season of Red-hunting opens today, let me tell
you, or try to tell you at the beginning: I am not a spy, not a
foreign agent, not the “boss” of all the Reds in this or any
other country, and that I never did anything to harm the
American people for whom I have a great deal of sympathy.
I am a German Communist, a political refugee, wanting to
go home. .

I am very glad to beable to tell my side of the story at last,
a story invented by provocateurs and rabble-rousing agitators
to smear American progressives and poison the international

_ atmosphere.

I expect you will give me the same opportunity to talk,
unhampered and freely, as you gave to Budenz (Louis Bu-
denz, a former member of the Communist Party and now an
assistant professor at Fordham University). I quote Mr. Ran-
kin from the record of the testimony of Budenz on November
22, 1946:

I want to say, Mr. Budenz, that we are going to
give you all the time you want, if it takes from now
until Christmas or from now until this time next
year.

I shall not take that long because, after 13 years of bitter
exile, I want to go back to Germanyinstead of wasting my
time in discussing the slanders, the falsehoods and the non-
sense of a provocateur. I demand'that the injustice done to
me, a German anti-fascist refugee, in preventing me -from
going back where I came from, shall be at once undone. If

Red-baiting is to be the new great American pastime, it can
be done without me. The world is getting fed up with it; so
am I.

I understand this Committee is a very interesting and re-’

markable American experiment in political inquisition and
persecution. The people everywhere in the world, and espe-

. cially we progressive Europeans, look at this experiment partly

with bewilderment and partly, to say it frankly, with contempt.
I repeat the word contempt.

Witch Hunt with Kidgloves

Mr. Parnell Thomas, your new chairman, has repeatedly
stated in public that he will not follow the notorious practice
of Mr. Rankin-—everybody will recall the treatment of the
famous Professor Harlow Shapley by Mr. Rankin—and that
he will give all his witnesses the same chance to tell their
story, to state their opinions and the facts as they see them, and
the chance to accuse and defend as they deem necessary. He
will, so to speak, organize the witch hunt with kid gloves on.

I beg you to excuse my “Germanized English,” as Budenz
calls it. But it is better to speak the truth withan accent than
detestable falsehood in perfect English. Axis Sally, I heard for
instance, spoke a very good English. I hope I shall make myself
clear, despite my accent, the accent of a foreigner, the accent
of a German Communist who never had any intention of
becoming an American and is here in this country against his
will, intentions and plans.

It is, of course, unavoidable that in my rebuttal to the asser-
tions of Budenz, I shall have to say quite a few things which
some of you gentlemen may not like to hear. No personal
offense is intended. Many things have been said about me and
done to me which I don’t like either. I had to take them. So
you will have to do the same. He who dishes out must be able
to take it. Of course, some of you gentlemen may not be able
to set aside your prejudices against Communists, progressives,
liberals or anyone else who has the tendency to look forward.

That is human and I understand perfectly. On the other
hand, I am human, too, and cannot set aside my contempt
and prejudice against all forms of reaction, backwardness,
bigotry and stoolpigeons. I have seen during my lifetime in
many lands so many similar Committees with ideas like yours
that, with the exception of the American language, your Com-
mittee could be at home in any- country in the world where
reaction and intolerance play yet an important role. Fortu-
nately such countries become fewer and fewer.

I understand from many experiences in my homeland and
in other countries that Red-baiters, provocateurs and stool-
pigeons always have a holiday when social reaction attacks the
workers and all progressive ‘elements. There is nothing spe-
cially American, or French, or Canadian, or Chinese in it.
There are not many national differences between the eggs
laid by reactionary hens in different countries. One is similar
to the other. "Such -things come and go, and even the bad smell
usually disappears. '

_ Record Must Stand Against Prejudice

I understand perfectly well that I have no easy task here.
If you do not believe what this man Budenz told you, but you
only make believe it is true because of your speciﬁc brand of
political interests, I could talk till doomsday without success.
On the other hand, if you are really so prejudiced and ignorant
of the facts of life that you believe all the nonsense Budenz
told -you, my words have hardly a chance to penetrate the
armor of such prejudice. So I shall have to rely on the record

- and speak for the record. I expect, too, it will be the record of

what I said and not anyone’s opinion of what I said.

This Committee is supposed to investigate so-called un-
American activities. There are quite a few Americans who
have very different ideas of what are un-American activities.
There are even outstanding Americans who consider a Com-
mittee such as yours a disgrace to American democratic tradi-

tions. But this is not for me to decide. Itis a matter for Ameri-
cans who know better than I the great democratic traditions of
their country for which I have great respect.

As for me I am a foreigner, a German anti-fascist and not
an American. I never had the ambition, nor would it be
possible, to behave exactly like an American or a Russian or
a Greek for that matter. So a somewhat dogmatic interpreta-
tion could easily classify everything I did, said or wrote as
un-American. In this sense 95 per cent of the people of the
world who are not Americans, and have no intention of
becoming Americans, are un-American. But naturally, you
cannot investigate the whole world, although someone here
may dream of the Century of the Investigated Man, the
Century of the Un-American Activities Committee.

An Anti-Fascist Is Not Anti-American

So if you accuse me of not looking upon the world with the
eyes of an American, and especially with your eyes, you are
deﬁnitely right. I look upon the world with the eyes of a
German Communist, guided by the principles of a German
Communist, which I did not change and would not sell even
if I were to become an assistant professor at some American
university after having been instructed, or to use the language
of sports, after having been ﬁxed.

Whatever ignoramuses say about Communists, a Com-
munist’s ﬁrst love is his country. And that is the reason why
I, a German Communist, can agree with you if you call me
un-American. You see, it cannot be helped; there are people
who are not Americans and who have their own way of life.

Having said this, I must add emphatically: From all this
follows by'no means that I am anti-American. The Nazis were
anti-American, anti-Russian, anti—French, anti-Polish; in short
they were against all un—German peoples. As a German Com-
munist I am in sympathy with all the peoples in the world,
with the more progressive and the less progressive. I may dis-
like American or Spanish reaction, but never the American or

Spanish people. As a matter of fact I like the American people
very much. Not all of them, but most of them. I would never
do anything to harm any people in the world. On the
contrary, I went to Spain to do my bit in the ﬁght against the
German invasion. And, by the way, I learned in Spain how
courageous Americans can ﬁght for a good cause. In the war
against Hitler Germany my heart, my full sympathy and all
my activities were on the side of the heroic soldiers of the
American people and their great allies. Your selective service
classiﬁed me as too old to become a soldier in your army. But
if they would have taken me I would not have fought badly,
because if I am convinced a cause is ‘righteous, I am not a
bad ﬁghter. If New York would have been bombed, which
thank God did not happen, I would have done my duty as an
air raid warden. Let me correct the malicious nonsense told
by Budenz that I became an air raid warden illegally. My
neighbors came to me and asked me to do service as an air
raid warden. I told the police that I am a foreigner, and the
police told me that this did not matter as there were hundreds
of thousands of non-citizens doing all kinds of civilian duties
to help the war effort. I became legally an air raid warden,
I got a citation for faithful service, and I gave blood to the
blood bank. .

If the United States had been invaded by the Nazi or
Japanese armies, I would have defended your country against
the invaders in the ranks of American citizens.

Not “Right or Wrong, ‘My Hitler”

But all the ‘time I 'never would have become an American
agent. I would have remained, as I did, a German Communist,
hopingand hoping that the Germans would liberate them-
selves from the Hitler dictatorship and end this criminal war
—a hope which unfortunately did not come true.

You see, as a German Communist I did not say, right or
wrong, my Hitler, my gas chambers, my Himmler, my race
haters, my trusts, my un-German Activities Committee, my
