TIRED or SKYROCKETING ELECTRIC BILLS?
APPALLED BY THE DANGERS.0E NUCLEAR rowan?

ANGRY AT BEING LEFT OUT OF DETERMINING
YOUR COUNTRX'S ENERGY FUTURE?

wright nigh utility bills by withholding
portions of your electric bill which are
unfairly charged.

Shift our investment to SAFE, CLEAN, and
ECONOMICAL energy sources.

Change the discriminatory rate structure
now in use to one which is based upon pro-
viding basic human needs.

Stop “phantom” tax over-charges.

Create direct consumer decisionsmaking
on energy policy.

  

 

THE POWER IS IN YOUR POCKET

 

HERE'S HOW TO USE IT:

Your electricity cannot be shut off for
non-payment of bills while you are exerci-
sing your right to hearings. Our tactic
is to overload the hearing process,
preventing the collection of bills. The
resulting loss of cash flow will damage
Consumers’ and Edison's ability to borrow
the money necessary to continue their
‘construction programs.

HOW THE STRIKE WORKS

1. Send us the attached pledge coupon.
Mailing, printing and telephones cost
money--please send what you can to
us or your local strike committee
to help with these expenses. We will
send strike news and information to
everyone.

2. Local strike committees are being
formed and will provide information
and support to strikers in their areas.

3. When we receive 1000 pledges in each
service area, we will have the support
to call the strike.

4. Between one and three months after
withholding all or part of your bill
you will receive a shutoff notice.

At this time it is your legal right
to request a hearing. Call or write
your local utility office to request
the hearing BEFORE YOUR POWER IS SHUT
23!.-‘ ’ 7

5. Presently Edison and Consumers’ will

"only grant you a hearing if you claim

they charged you for more electricity

than you actually used. You may raise 8
other questions, but the utility's

hearing officer has the legal power to

decide only disagreements on the amount

of power used. Demands for a hearing

on any other basis (nuclear power,

lifeline) will be sent on to the

Michigan Public Service Comission

where you will likely be denied.

QUEST A HEARING.

ection will continue.

If you request a hearing and the complaint
involves the possible shut off of electri-
city, service will NOT be shut off before
the hearing.

You have the right to demand the power com-
pany inspect your meter. If the inspection.
does not include actual electrical testing
(as opposed to mere visual inspection) de-
mand such testing be done. Testing all

our meters will knot up the utilities be-
fore hearings even begin.

Be prepared!! The electric company will
try to talk you out of a hearing. You
will be asked why you did not complain
about the bill sooner and why you feel
you are being overcharged. They will
want to know exactly what period of time
you are talking about. You need not
agree to anything. These are all proper

questions for the hearing.

Failure to make such a pay-
ment waives your right to a hearing and coll-

At the informal hearing:

a) You may be represented by yourself, an
attorney, or anyone else you wish.

b) You and the power company must each
PRESENT YOUR POSITIONS IN WRITING.

c) Each side has the right to question
witnesses and representatives of the
other side._ Each may examine the
documents of the other. All testi-
mony is under oath.

d) The burden of proof is on the utility.

The utility hearing officer will likely
rule against you. IF this happens you
have five days to comply with the
decision-or... .

another hearing. In any case a de-
cision will be made in 30 days.

Each party has 10 days to comply

Appeal formally to the Public Service

REMEMBER -- Be prepared to pay if you

meantime, however,, you will have effec-
tively demonstrated to the power monopo-
lies your commitment to safe, clean and
fairly priced energy.

SUPPORT

**Upon calling of the strike, more information
and details which you can present at your
hearing will be available.

**We encourage you to represent yourself
before the utility. Contact your local.
strike committee or anti-nuclear group for
information and support.

Throughout the past year, we who realize the
dangers of nuclear energy in Michigan have ac-
tively participated in statewide rallies,
local educational forums, Public Service Come
mission hearings, Nuclear Regulatory Commission
hearings, and have provided support for state
bills, all in an effort to stop the construc-
tion of more nuclear plants in Michigan and
to dismantle the obviously unsafe plants now
on line. Our efforts in these directions will
not cease or diminish. We must maintain our
opposition to nuclear energy on all levels or
else the utilities will blatantly continue
manipulating the consuers to accept the
dangers and to pay the cost of their nuclear
folly.

Revenue for construction of nuclear reactors

.by Edison and Consumer's is eventually

subsidized by us, the consumers.

Utilities are monopolies with locked—in con-
sumers. We can demonstrate vocally our
opposition. We must demonstrate how many of
us will not be deceived. We will then
demonstrate that we as consumers have an
option to pay or not to pay.

WHY STRIKE?

**According to the present rate structure
industry pays only 3¢ per kilowatt hour
(KHH) for electricity.‘ we a 4.5
‘ er KWH. 502 morel! This 18 not only
unfair, it also encourages industry
to be wasteful.

**Construction.work in progress accounts
for about one third of Consumers‘ rate
base and about one fourth of Edison's.
Nearly all of this construction is in
nuclear power plants!

**The utilities—are allowed to pass on
‘the costs of the loans for this con-
struction at a rate of about 7.752.
Edison, for exanple, faces interest

charges-of $130 to $150-million!

**The Allowance for Funds Used During
construction (AFUDC) adds another $75
million to Consumers? income and $67
million to Edison's.’

**Edison and consuers' collect millions
from us for federal income taxes they
did not pay. .In 1977, Edison collec-
ted $36 million for a.total since 1954
of $310 million in "pantom" taxes.

**The utilities build the.more expensive
nuclear plants: The state guarantees
electric companies a profit of 13.52.
"on each dollar invested in generating_
and trannission equipment.» This en-
courages uasteful spending on unsafe
and unreliable nuclear power plants.
For exple, the defunct Fermi I
nuclear cost Edison customers $70
million for only 373 hours of power.

v**Edison7and Consumers’ build more gen-
erating.plants than ﬁe need. Detroit
Edison maintains a 28.62 reserve gen-
eration nargine-8.62 beyond even-the
federal government's recommendations.
Maintaining this plant in 1978 cost
an extra $8.35 million.

**Coupletion of the Various nuclear pro-
jects around the state will double or
triple our electric bills.

GOALS or run srnncr
.Disrupt Edison and Consumers‘ cash flow to:
1) Obtain a fair rate structure for electrical
V power as.well as prohibit the funding, con-

struction, and use of nuclear-power plants;

2) Establish a ceiling charge for the necessary
use of electricity--Lifeline;

-3) Register our concern;

4) Inform consumers-regarding;the
.dangers and costs of nuclear power;

5) Direct investment to economical and eco-
logical sources of energy;

6) Gain community ownership and control of

utilities.
