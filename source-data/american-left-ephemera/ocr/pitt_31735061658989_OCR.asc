HOW FARE YOUTH?

By Tom Dennison 5¢

   

~The result: 300,000 students have left school for ﬁnancial
reasons, reported Omar Bradley, VA chief in early 1947. And
over the future of 2,000,000 would-be students: a question
mark as big as the size of a Republican senator who voted to
abolish the OPA.

The High Schools? Di'|-fa

CHICAGO, ILLIN0IS—15 year old high school stu-
dent to a reporter, January 1947: “Yes, I go to one of the
schools of the South side—don’t say which one and don’t
say my name. I got a friend who was a leader in one -of
our strikes; he’ got ﬂunked in one course for no reason at
all. The school’s on a double shift; there’s hardly a class
where I don’t have to share a seat with someone. That’s
OK but honest, the teachers.’ Some of the students know
more! I hear Lane Tech has’ plenty of new gym equip-
ment but you won’t ﬁnd any in our place. To top it all .I
hear lunch room prices are going up. That’s for about
the fourth time.”

Americans have always believed that a good education is the
birthright of every American child. We know a democracy
needs informed citizens if it is to survive. And we know that
the kind of a job a person gets, and the kind of life he leads,
depends upon how much education he has.

Today GI ]oe’s younger brother and sister face as big a
crisis in the public schools as Joe does in the colleges. There
aren’t enough teachers, enough schools and enough facilities
or enough equipment. Let’s take a look at these facts.

About one in ten of the 25,000,000 children in elementary
and high school know what modern buildings with airy, com-
fortable classrooms, gyms and lunchrooms are like. Accord-
ing to the Education Editor of the New York Times, $4,635,-
‘ooo,ooo would have to be spent to provide adequate buildings.

Many consider New York’s school system good; it spends
$125 a year for each pupil's education and that's not enough.

But 9 states in the South spend less than $50, and nine more——‘

mostly rural states—less than $100.

Many, when they think of country schools, think of the pretty
little red schoolhouse. The ten million students in rural areas
know the 150,000 dingy uncomfortable places for what they
are.

A reporter described one two-room school attended by 84
students in the South, this way:

“Used for the last sixty years, the building appeared ready
to fall at theﬁrst strong wind. Long wooden benches served
as both chairs and desks. Without electric lights, the classes
could only be held on sunny days. The two windows, evidently
broken, some decades back, were boarded up by heavy planks.
The usual pot bellied stove gave off its hot and cold waves and
left the visitors with smarting eyes.”

And how about the teachers?

Students are not supposed to be unhappy when teacher is
absent. But since 1940, 350,000 teachers have been absent from
scho0l—permanently. Because they cannot live on their meager
salaries, three out of every eight teachers have left their pro-

fession. Needed urgently in the spring of 1947: 100,000
teachers to ﬁll vacancies. 125,000 more to replace teachers of’

substandard ability.

FALL RIVER, MASS.—-Mrs. Hannah Kanzak visited
school’ this week to arrange for the withdrawal of her son
Michael. Michael is 16 and in the 6th term. The regis-
trar said he was a pretty good student, excellent in sci-
ence and they were sorry he had to leave. Mrs. Kanzak

‘*A

‘Can.

The number of Michaels aged 15 to 17 in America, 1946,
working when they belong in school:iabout 2,500,000, a mil-
lion less than during the war, but two and a half times their
number in 1940.

VV e need a law to prevent child labor. But more important .

we need to act against the family poverty that forces youth to
quit school. _ i

We call our schools “free public schools” but‘. every family
knows that to keep children in school there’s really a double
expense. The expense for clothes and food, lunches and
bus fares and in 15 states for textbooks. And the family ex-
pense that has to be met because one member of the family
is not earning.

Even if charts and ﬁgures bore you, you should read the
charts in this section at least two times.

They tell two things. They say that every American youth
is not getting as much as a lower school education. And they
say that how much education American youth gets depends
not upon one’s ability, but on one’s ability to pay for it.

Jobs: Going. Going . . . .

NEW YORK, N. Y.—/lpril, I947——Place: the waiting
room of the United States Employment Service. Louis
Friedman, ex T/ 5 Army of the United States talking:
“I was a longshoreman in New Guinea. When I got out I
went to a drafting school for 8 months under the GI
Bill. Then I applied here at the USES and they told me
to come back in 3 months. That was a year ago. There
wasn’t anything doin’ at about two dozen other places I
visited; So I got a job with the Pennsylvania Railroad
cleaning coaches at 85¢ an hour. Last Christmas I got
laid oﬂ with about 2,000 guys. Since then I’ve tried about
a dozen food factories in Queens and about 15-20 union
hiring halls. I tell you things are really tightening up in
New York.”

13

   

Americans have become immune to big numbers. The fact
that there are 1,500,000 jobless GI’s in the Spring of 1947
doesn’t seem like much cause for worry. L

To the well paid writers on the slick magazines the boys
in the “52-20" club are “loafers” and “chiselers,” “ambition-
less parasites.”

But take a walk to the local ofﬁce that pays their unem-
ployment compensation. For the ﬁrst .time since V-] Day you
will see that the line is growing longer each week (6oo,o0o
more jobless in April, 1947, than December, 1946).

Applicants (three out of ﬁve of them) are now reapplying,
back from layoffs. And veterans are “cancelling their ac-
counts” (a quarter of a million have used up their 52 weeks
in 1947). And the faces on the disabled jobless (a quarter of
a million) grow more bitter as the barometer of unemploy-
ment rises. ,

It's not only the veteran among the youthful squeezed by
what the economists call the “tightening labor market.”

There are those whom Melvin Lavine, aged 16, Trenton,
New Jersey, speaks for:

“I was working for a wood company loading box cars dur-
ing the war. I quit school. Six months ago I was laid off.
I been to 50 places looking for a new job. They don’t seem
so anxious to take guys my age group as they used to be.”

About 1,500,000 boys and girls aged 15 to 17 quit school
during 1945 and’ 1946 for full time jobs. Most lost their war
jobs. And without a high school diploma they face tough

- competition from veterans. Many have returned to school;

many can not afford to. Those with jobs hold them precari-

ously, knowing they will be among the first to be ﬁred in.

layoffs.

Then there are the Rosie the Riveters. A million more
women are in production now than there were before the war.
More than half of the six million new women war workers are
said to have “retired voluntarily.” But 92 of every 100 women

SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH YOUTH ARE IN LARGE NUMBERS

war workers, say the experts, worked not for “pin money” but
because they had to. Some one—half to perhaps a million
and a half women are now unemployed—no one even seems
to know how many. 4

Those who remain have had to shift to lower paying in~
dustries or have been downgraded. With little. seniority they
have an unsteady grip on their jobs.

You'|'h—Hi1' Firs!‘ and Worst

In the Spring of 1947, by government count there are only
2 or 3,000,000 jobless. But add_ the workers conveniently
labelled “retired” and there probably are closer to 5,000,000
unemployed. Of these easily a third are young workers—teen
agers, young women and veterans.

It was that way in the ’3o’s too. Youth comprise only one
sixth of the population. But in 1937 1 in 3 jobless was a young
person, 4 out of 1,1 million. In 1940 the ratio was the same.

The economic cycle steamrollers all Americans. Only the
Morgans and Rockefellers escape it and proﬁt by it. But why
is it that youth gets ﬂattened’ like a pancake? 3

Young workers, ﬁrst of all, are new workers. About 2,000,000
“enter the labor market” each year from school. If father is
Mr. Big at the First National, Junior doesn’t have a job

15

 
 

- hunting problem. But in our- economy nothing’ guarantees

2,000,000 vacancies each year.

Secondly, young workers are asked to compete with older
workers on adult standards. Years ago in an era of great
expansion a boss might give a “bright young man” ‘a chance,
experience or no. Today an 18-year-old is asked “how much

experience?” And the answer is: “How can I get experience if

I can’t get a job?”

Thirdly, young workers today, generally speaking, are con-
centrated in those jobs and industries which will bevthe ﬁrst
to feel the eﬁects of this depression. Look for a moment at
the diagram of the industries in which large numbers of youth
work. Generally they are what economists dub the light con-
sumer goods industries, the service and communications‘ in-
dustries, and the retail and office jobs.

Fourthly, wherever youth work they are usually among the .

ﬁrst to be ﬁred. For they have less experience and less senior-
ity. Seniority, trade unionists have learned, is the only way
of protecting workers from the boss’s playing favorites, and his
attempts to pit one worker against another. Understandably,

many young workers are bitter against it. They think they can 0

“get along without it.” O1d—timers can tell them otherwise.
“If young workers do stay and older workers are ﬁred, it is

_‘for one reason: they can be speeded up and the boss can pay

them what he pleases.”

Dead Ends: Job Training , /

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.-Robert Cook, 24, ex-U.S.
Marine Corps speaking: “I’ve had this on-the—job train-
ing program in a- small cleaning place for about six
months now. But there’s. nothing here I couldn’t have
learned in six days. I get about $80 .a month from my
boss and $65 more from the VA. $175 is the ceiling. The
boss, he makes out ﬁne. ‘He’d have to pay all of it him-

16

 

 

self to get anybody else. I didn’t know all this when I
started. I know I’m undercutting somebody else, but
Hell, another job isn’t so easy to ﬁnd thesedays.”

“SKILL: None” is what Army classiﬁcation officers had to
fill in for one out of every three GI’s. And aside from the art
of potato peeling comparaively few in the Army acquired
skills they can now put to a use. That’s why there was the
job training program of the GI Bill. By the end of 1946
700,000 veterans had made use of it;

But shocking as it may sound, with a handful of exceptions,
the program is a colossal dud. ‘

“Increasingly frequent reports,” writes General Bradley,
suggest that.“veterans are sometimes jockeyed into training
programs that offer dead end jobs.” '

Employers have used the plan as a source of cheap labor.
And in the face of high prices, thousands have had to leave the
program because of its low ceiling on earnings. Others stay
only because they know “it’s better than nothing.”

_Non-veteran youth are almost completely out in the cold
as far as apprenticeship goes, reports a special Government
Con/rmittee on Youth problems in September, 1946. “Appren-
ticeship opportunities have never been sufficiently developed.”

Vocational schools are not extensive enough or evenly
distributed. In Los Angeles, ‘for example, only 500 of the
26,000 high school graduates each year have any vocational
skill. ' '

And few students receive any realistic help in picking a job.
Only 6 schools, in 100, says the Office of Education, have a full
or part-time job counsellor. ‘

In 1941 the USES asked 400 ‘unemployed youth what job
they were looking for. 99 per cent of the 16-year-olds and 87
per cent of the 18-year-olds wrote: “Just anything.” The an-
swer is still the same._

Wages: "Now I Ask You .  .?

NEW YORK, N. Y.—/lpril, I947—P;lac/e: a picket line
in front of the Bell Telephone.Company, 14th Street and
3rd Avenue. Stephanie Golewicz, telephone operator,
aged 18, speaking: “Why am I here? Now I ask you, how
can I live on $26? That’s all I get to take home.” 1

"Think back to the jobs and industries in which most young
people work. They are the lowest paying jobs—the jobs that
require the least skill—the dead end jobs. They are the jobs
where conditions are among the worst because unions are the
weakest. _ p

$48.86 was the average industrial wage in March, 1947. No
one has to write how a worker makes out on it. But compare
this wage with those on jobs where large numbers of young
people work:

Retail trade (national average) . . . . . . ..$33.o4
File Clerk (20 city survey) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31.00
Textile Manufacture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 35.31

Westinghouse, Cleveland plant . . 571/2 to 7 31/2¢ an hour
Unskilled Shirtmaker, New York . . .65¢ an hour

Less than 871/2¢ an hour is considered substandard pay.
Three out of ﬁve workers have such jobs. And these include
millions of the youth who work. A

“What are you kicking about?” you can hear Prof. N-. A.
Emulator complaining. “Young people start today at $20 or
$25 or even $30 a week. Before the war it was $12 or $15."

- The numbers look good. Until you take a look at prices. And

until you look at taxes—the “something new” that’s been added
to the youth budget. With an income of $38 a week, says
Fortune magazine, a person paid $190 in income tax in 1946
and $350 in other taxes. A person earning $25 gave up about
a dollar a week in income tax. '

“But youth have always started low” you can hear the
Professor. Yes, they have, sir, but does that mean starting
below a decent standard of living?

Conditions: "The Face Is Awful . . .

ANDALUSIA, GA.—Outside a‘ union hall, cotton tex~
tile worker Evelyn Gcmus, aged 22, speaking: “Why have
you been on strike I0 weeks?” asks a reporter. “Treat-
ment like we are human beings and job security. No more
of this ‘big I and little you’ stuff.”

The young people in the ‘incidents in this pam-
phlet are real people whose stories have been taken
from newspaper and magazine items, special reports
and interviews. Names have been omitted or changed
(pages 8, II, 13, 16) only where identiﬁcation would

~  .,

cause embarrassment to the ‘individual.

 

   

There is hardly a young factory worker in America who
could not put the same feeling into his or her own words.

Let Helen Rykofski speak, aged 19, one of 5,000 girls as-
sembling radio tubes in RCA’s Harrison, New Jersey, plant.
Rykofski’s not her real name. There’s no union at RCA and

' she’d be ﬁred if the company heard her words: “We get paid

according to how many tubes we turn out an hour. The girls
in my department average about 50, and the pace is something
awful. Now the company is talking about raising the quota
to 75 or 100 and time-study men are around. The foreman
begrudges you the 3 minutes you take off for the toilet. By
the time Friday rolls around the girls are so tense and nervous
no one even talks to anyone else.”

These are the reasons hundreds of thousands of young work-
ers have marched side by side with old timers on the picket
lines in the two years since V-] Day. '

These are the reasons that young workers especially need
free, strong trade unions in America.

Down on '|-he Farm

SEATTLE, WASH.—Tall, sandy-haired boy aged 19
speaking: “What’s a farm boy doing in the city? I’m
looking for a job. My older brother will take over the
farm when my father’s done. He’s welcome to it, mort-
gage, worn out land and all. Buy land? Where and with
what? If there’s nothing doing here I may take a look
intoone of the migrant labor camps nearby. But I hear
they’re full up too.”

Life on the farm, Hollywood style, consists of glossy white
barns, and courtin’ at the State Fair.

But in 1942, of every 1oo farm youths in high school only
15 wanted to stay on the farm. 'It’s not that they don’t see
enough movies; they see too much of the farm.

The history of farming in our country for the past half

20

 

 

century is a story of incrasing tenancy, debt, -and the squeez-
ing out of the family farm. In the ﬁve years of war alone, al-

most a quarter of a million farms were swallowed up. And '

with mechanical cotton pickers, and corn huskers there will
not evenbe work for those turned into farm laborers‘-.-7

Each year," according to the American Youth Commission,’
twice as many farm boys reach maturity as farms fall vacant.‘
The result in the 1g3o’s: 2,ooo,ooo “surplusfarm youth”; in

1935, 1,375,ooo on relief.

For ﬁve years the Army and war industries solved the dilem-
ma. For the" next decade each year 300,060 to 400,000 boys
will have toleave the farm. » _

To compete in the cities they will need skills and education.
But rural schools are the poorest of all. And only half as
many farm boys graduate high school and one-ﬁfth as many,
college, as do urban youth.

For millions on the farm the current prosperity is a mirage.
For the rest it is fading fast. -

There was a time when youth were supposed to be able to
climb up the “agricultural ladder.” In 1935, ‘President Roose-
velt said the ladder had become a treadmill. Millions of rural
youth are beginning to walk it again. '

Negro Youth: "With Our Bareﬂunds"

WALTON, GA.—-Negro veteran to an investigator of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People: “They’re exterminating us. They’re killing Ne-
gro vets and we don’t have nothing to ﬁght back with but
ourbare hands. In Italy and Germany we knew which
waythey were coming but here. . . .” '

Many of the men who drove trucks for Uncle Sam are now
driving trucks as civilians. Few of the 15,000 drivers of the
Cannon Ball‘ express are. ‘

21

    

  

Many army pilots landed jobs piloting transports or mail
runs. Not so the members of the 99th Pursuit Squadron.
The 99th and the Cannon Ball were Negro outﬁts. '

 

Wherever they were given the chance, young Negro men -

and women in the Army and in industry showed that they had
the stuff—that there are no inferior races. For the ﬁrst time
they were employed in large numbers in the auto and aircraft
plants, in the shipyards and electrical plants and in govern-
ment oﬂices.

A year after V-_] Day, in June, 1946, the Fair Employment
Practices Committee reported: “The wartime gains of Negro,
Mexican American and Jewish workers are being lost through
an unchecked revival of discriminatory practices.”

The FEPC, through the work of Northen Republicans and
Southern poll-taxers, has been killed. V

Training for young Negroes in the Spring of 1947, the Na-
tional Urban League reports, is “critical with no sign of im-
provement.”

In the South, lynch terror is forcing 700,000 veterans into
low paying, dead end jobs, and is even preventing them from
receiving the millions in terminal leave due them.

Compare the position of Negro youth with white at any
point: '

Jobs: 3,500,000 of 4,500,000 Negro workers work in agricul-
ture, in service trades and as maids.

Wages: In 1943 only 4 per cent of Negro youth earning as
much as $1,000 a year-one-quarter as many as white youth.

Professzbns: 3,500 Negro doctors, 1,500 Negro dentists, 1,300
lawyers for 13,000,000 Negro Americans.

Education: $40.56 per pupil spent each year in 10 Southern
states—$77.83 for white pupils. Average schooling 2 years less
than white youth. ‘

Colleges: 10 per cent of the American population, less than
4 per cent of the college students.

Not even an equal chance to take the last desperate step,

22

open today to white youth. To re-enlist in the Army, a white
soldier does not need a high school diploma. A Negro does.

To Sum Up: Jus'l' One Figure

ANYH/HERE, U.S.A.——Place, a U.S. Army Recruiting
Oﬁice. John Jones, aged 17 to 25 became the one million,
two hundred and ﬁfty thousandth American youth to
enlist or re-enlist in the United States Army.

1,250,000. The one ﬁgure sums up the story of American
youth, 1947.

“For Jobs and Security” say the posters plastered in buses
and store windows across America, “for education and training
—for a career with advancement—join the Regular Army.”

The truth is that “the job of the veteran's readjustment has
been neither adequate nor efficiently handled.” That’s the con-
clusion of a government report never released to the public.

From War Industries to . . .?

  

The truth is that millions of non-veteran youth face a
dim and uncertain future. That too is the conclusion of at
special government report on youth.

The truth is that in the two years since our victory over
fascism American youth have been forgotten and the prom—
ises made to them betrayed.-

And '|-he Future?

WASHINGTON, D.C., March 1938-Young boy tes-
tifying at a hearing on the American Youth Act: “I
haven’t had a chance to work at anything for years. Sup-
pose I would get a rod and hold up one of those bosses.
I wouldn’t take his money or anything. I would ask him
for a job. I would probably get pinched, but it would get
into the papers and I would get a job.”

If now in the midst of a “panorama of prosperity” youth
and the common people of the country are taking it on the
chin, what will it be like if a depression hits America?

In the 193o’s we had steadily from 7 to 15 million people

without jobs. From 3 to 5,000,000 were youth. One out off

every three jobless was a young worker.
If we have another depression we will again have girls
telling reporters at the police station as this one did in 1939:
‘‘I couldn’t get a job. I was starving. I had nothing to sell but
myself. So I sold myself.” . I
In the 1930’s from 500,000 to a million young people be
came migrants, they took to the roadsin search of work, liv-

_ ing in hobo camps and eating out of garbage cans, crossing a

continent in a frantic search for jobs.

In the 1g30’s wages for young workers averaged $12.06
and half of the country's young workers made less.

If we have another depression we will again have ads in
the papers like this one: “H0tel'New Yorker Wants.Bus Boys
—Must Be College Graduates” and 400 boys will show up.

24'

 

 

In the 193o’s some 12,000,000 youth were forced to leave

_ school and education budgets which should have been in-
creased were slashed to new lows to “economize.”

If We have another depression we will again have hundreds
of thousands’ of youth who will literally starve like the*Cali-
tfornia student who told an" investigator: “I only eat two meals

~ a day. I sleep it off during the lunch period.”

~ If we have another depression no» section of young people
willbe spared, for in the 1g3o’s engineers, Ph.D.’s, white collar
workers—all were jobless. V ' A
Above all if we have another depression there will be the
despair. The despair of hanging around the neighborhood
candy store or the county court house day after day after day
killing time. The despair of the endless treks to the employ-
ment office and for the hundredth time “Sorry, nothing to-
day.” The despair of not having as much as the price of a
movie for a ﬁrst date. The despair of waiting years—two,
three and even ﬁve for a job. V —
And if the last depression was a blockbuste‘r,!:then the next
one will be an atombomb.

Did Wé Say "If"? .
We said “if” we have another depression. But economists
no longer debate the “if.” They’re concerned only with pre:

dicting “wheni”

Their estimates vary from 6 months to 7 years and almost .

all agree that we are in‘ ‘for trouble in 1947.

Almost all ’Americans feel the same way. ‘In late 1946, of
every 100 persons Fortune asked: “‘Do you think ‘there will be
a serious depression within the next ten years?” only '17 said
“unlikely” and only 13 “did not know.” Seventy peoplere-
plied: “Yes, likely,” and youth were most convinced of all.

‘ Young people, whether they. sayso orhnot, are worried
about the future. In their thoughts, many of course, try__—to
run away from their fears: “It can’t-happen to me, it’1l

25

  

happen to the other guy.”. Others think: “Yes, things are

getting tough, that means I really have to look out for number _
_ one.”

They think they'll “play it smart.” But they really forget
the most important things. They forget that a depression hap
pens to everyone and forgets no one. What happens to 130,-
000,000 also happens to “number one.” We are all in the
same boat. They also forget that just because there is a storm
coming doesn’t mean we have to stand out in the rain and wait
for the lightning tosstrike.

Americans have never taken it lying down before. There are
things we can do‘ to protect the people of our country. And
there are things we can do here and now to meet the needs of
America’s youth.

Needed: A National ‘Program . . .

It's pretty obvious that the problems facing young Ameri—
cans are both general and special. General because youth
share so many with all Americans and especially American
workers. Special because education, training and experience
are distinctly youth problems.

It follows that anything that beneﬁts the American people
beneﬁts youth.

Holding the line on prices and increasing take.home pay
are specially important to young workers——the lowest _pa_ic_l
workers. A A

Low cost housing and slum clearance ditto for youth.

Above all discrimination in employment and education has
to be wiped out root" and branch because of the toll it takes
from young lives.

For the right to a good education for all youth; for the
universal right to a ‘college education: emergency funds to
states and cities to raise teacher salaries; a long-range program
of federal aid to build new schools, free city colleges, and
state universities; a national system of at least 100,000 college
scholarships to be awarded on the basis of a competitive ex-

But ThCl'|'AAil1'1' All

Youth needs legislation. V .But that isn’t,all youth needs.

These. things won't be delivered on a silver platter. They can
-be won—just as youth helped win the NYA and C_CC, the job
training and student aid of the 1g3o’s, inadequate as they
were .But theyhave to be fought for. And to do that youth
needs weapons. .

Youth needs strong, democratic trade unions. By himself

the young worker—new and inexperienced—gets nowhere. Only
with a union_ can his special beefs be satisﬁed: low wages,
unequal pay, vacations only after years on the job, a speed-up
because he is young and ‘.‘can take it,” promotions only on the
boss’s say so. Only with a union" can he win his rights and be
treated with some dignity. ,

And young people also need a voice of their own. We need
to get together andpool our strength in an organization that

will speak up for our rights. Such an organization is the

American Youth for Democracy, of, for and by. youth; teen-
agers, students, young adults; white and Negro, Christian and
Jew. AYD’s purpose in life is to ﬁght for the things we have
been talking about here. -

HOW FARE vounn

By Tom Denn/ison

LOS ANGELES, CAL, December 1946—Charles
Borgess, 22, a Navy veteran was sentenced to one year in
prison for stealing an automobile. Borgess said he stole
the car so that he, his wife, and baby could have a place
to live. A pharmacist’s mate in the Navy, Borgess received
a Presidential citation for killing zoo Japanese.

LOS AN GELES,‘CAL., April 1947-Mrs. Nyra Borgess,
21 year old wife of Charles Borgess, Navy veteran serving
a year for an auto theft, was arrested for stealing another
car. I
“Sure I stole the car about six weeks ago,” Mrs. Borgess
told oﬂicers.

“Ever since Chuck was put in jail I’d been carrying the _

baby from show to show and park to park. He had a cold
all the time and wasn’t getting fed properly. I got to the
point where I didn’t care if they put me in jail too. I had
to have a place to lie down at night.”

WASHINGTON, D. C., January I947-President
Truman in a message to Congress said that the nation’s
veterans’ program is complete “except for minor readjust-
ments.” ‘

WILLOUGHBY, OHIO, August I946—Friends of
Ralph K. Betz of this city were surprised to hear that 26-
year-old Betz, a former machinist who had served 42

democratic Turkey and Greece and say we must soon spend
10 times that again. Why is there no money for the needs of
American youth?
y The Rankins and the Peglers and the Hearsts will call AYD’s
—  program for American youth_ “Communism.” We say this is the
 charge A reactionaries label everything that is good for the
people. We say reactionaries will hide behind the smoke- §
screen of red-baiting because they can not come out in the open
with their real program for American youth. We say that the
record shows that they have done nothing to help American
youth and indeed have sabotaged all the measures that are in
the interests of youth and the people.

If we have a housing crisis today we can blame the real
estate lobby and their Congressmen who voted to remove
housing -controls and scuttle low cost housing.

If young workers have thedespair of impossible wages we
certainly can blame the men of the big corporations whose
proﬁts are higher than ever before in our nation's history.

If we have inﬂationary prices we can blame the National

’\ Association of Manufacturers and their friends in Congress
who abolished OPA on the pretense of bringing lower prices.

If we have an educational crisis in the schools and colleges
we certainly can blame the imperialists who think appropria-
tions for crusading against “communism” are more important .
than education. .

If Negro young people face only lynching terror in the
South and a worsening Jim Crow in the whole country, surely 2
they can ask the President why the national’ government has
not_ protected the rights of its citizens.

In Their P-lans . . .

The men in high places have not served youth but they
hope to use youth for their own evil purposes.
They would like to set white youth against Negro youth,

30   E

  

Jew against Christian, young worker against old worker, so they
divide and conquer. A . _
They would like to see a few million unemployed so they

A can smash unions and beat down wages.

They would like to see millions of American youth in uni-
form and in military training to help them shake a big stick at
the rest of the world. A

And they would like to use American youth—jobless
and poorly educated—as the storm troops for a fascist America.

And that’s why the real needs of American youth. are-a
“suppressed story.”

. . . Bu! Noi In Ours i

A program like that ﬁts into their plans. But they forget one
thing: it doesn't ﬁt into the plans of 21,500,000 American
youth.

We know that American youth did not spend 4 years ﬁght-
ing fascism for such a future. .

We know that it is not the future that Franklin Roosevelt
envisioned for American youth. I

-We believe, as Roosevelt believed, that in America, the
richest and wealthiest of all countries, there need not be pov-
erty and insecurity and fear of the future. _

We believe -that in the words of the_song The House I Live
In, America is A

. . a land of wealth and beauty
With enough for all to share.

We know it is the'American way for youth to ﬁght for the
things they believe in and to stand up for the rights they know
are justly theirs. .

And we know that if we, the people, use the power of our-
common strength, we can go forward once again and make
this generation of American youth not the “lost generation,"

' not the “depression generation,” but——the “happy generation.”

civilian job with his old outﬁt, the 59th Quartermaster

said Betz, “and prices were so high, you couldn’t live on
your salary if you got a job.” Betz was jailed for illegal
entry into the country.

Too Hoi 'l-o Handle -

You can’t read much in the newspapers about Ralph Betz
or about Charles and’ Nyra Borgess.

Theirs are the stories that make the men who run the big
newspaper syndicates write to their editors:

. “Attention all editors: Kill that story. Bury that story.”

Theirs are the stories that are “too hot to handle.” For they
are stories that raise burning questions for all Americans.

It is now V-J day plus almost two years. It is time to take
stock of America’s resources—and especially of our most valu-
able resource—America’s youth.

Is the GI Joe yanked into uniform from school or a job
secure in a new job or classroom? ~

Where are. the “angels with dirty faces”— the millions of
Janefwar workerswho two years ago were turning out the
goodsof war from the assembly lines?

What of America’s bobby sox generation? For four years of

V war they were wanted. Wanted to collect scrap and wanted as

messengers for civilian defense. Wanted in the summers to
harvest the crops. Wanted in industry and ofﬁce at well paying
jobs. Are they wanted today? ’

5

  

generation, a depression generation and a war generation.
What do the years ahead hold in store?

American youth fought the war for the same reasons all
Americans did. Our country was threatened—the world was
not big enough for a democratic America and a fascist axis.
Our war aims were simple aims. We were looking for the
things we have come to believe every young person entitled to
—a peaceful world free from the fear of fascism and war—a
steady job at decent wages with a hope for the future, educa-
tion, a home, a family, a chance for some of the good things in
life. The things that Franklin Roosevelt summed up in the
Four Freedoms and the Economic Bill of Rights.

Those were the aims. VVhat now is the record?

Buf Why "You'|'|I"? .

“Wait a minute, what’s so special about youth? Why should
they be singled out for special treatment?” do we hear a voice
from the balcony. “Don’t young people just have the same

. problems that all Americans have?” That certainly is true. But

youth is the time for making plans, the time for getting started
in life. So young people—just because they are young people
—have problems no other Americans have.

When something goes wrong with the nation then youth not
only can't get started. They get frozen in their tracks. Some-
thing is going very wrong today. We are at the beginning of a
depression. And youth is getting it ﬁrst and getting it worst.

This is the “suppressed story,” the story you can't read in the
papers. It's the story of 21,500,000 Americans, of one sixth of
our population. ‘

';Hou,sing: Snafu Number One

PHILADELPHIA, PA., March 1947—Ex-Lt. john M.
Hazlett, former combat ﬂier in Sicily and Italy and win-
ner oftwo Presidential citations, has committed suicide.

6

 

 

 

His wife found Hazlett lying in a pool of blood on the
kitchen ﬂoor of their small apartment on Sartain Street,
a 12 gauge shotgun at his side.

Hazlett was a law student at Temple University. Mrs.
Hazlett, who worked in a candy store was out looking for
a room, when her husband killed himself. That morning
they received a notice of eviction. “John was under awful
nervous tension ever since he came back from overseas”
she told reporters. She guessed the eviction was the “last
straw.”

Nobody has to prove to Americans in the year 1947 that
there is a housing “problem.” Some people forget however that
it’s a problem first and foremost for young people and that it’s
getting worse and not better.

. There was a record 1,2 50,000 marriages in 1946. We may have
that many more this year. But at the beginning of 1947

4,000,000 families were in urgent need of homes. 3,400,000
were living doubled up with “his” mother or “her” "friends.

In 1946 only 652,000 dwelling units were built. In 1947, if
weare‘ lucky, according to the National Housing Expediter,
we: can expect 750,00oo‘i1nits'more. ' ’ ‘ '

‘--Few vets moreover can afford to pay the rents and the build-
ing‘ prices asked by greedy landlords and constructors.

Half of the veteransinterviewed at discharge centers said
$36 was top rent for them. Less than one in ten could pay more
than $50.  I '

Of those who want to “build their own” few can afford more
than $5500—and 700,000 no more than $40o0—just about $4000
less than the average that will be asked in 1947.

That’s the snafu 0n'new_ places to live. What about the
homes millions of GI’s returned to and which millions of other
youngpeople grew up in? ’

In 1940 16,000,000 Americans lived in homes which the
government considered “below the minimum standard of
health and decency.” “One third of a nation” still lives in
houses withoutrunning water or a private bath or in need of
"major repairs. We have had ‘no “slum clearing” for 7 years.
That’s “TheiHouse I Live In”—1947—if you have one.

Education: "Nice While I+_pLas+ed"

YPSILAN T I, Michigan, March I947—Austin Thomas,
23, Navy veteran, returned from Michigan State College
this month."Thomas who had completed 2 years towards
a science degree ‘under the GI Bill said he would not re-
turn for the Spring semester’. “I was getting $65 a month
from the government,” said Thomas, “I needed about
$104 to live.'I’ve cashedin a couple of war bonds ‘and I’ve
borrowed some from my folks. But I can’t keep that up

“ for another 3 years; It was very nice while it lasted.”

8

 

 

In the Spring of 1947 some 1,100,000 veterans were enrolled
at the.nation’s colleges. By unanimous agreement they are_:the

I best students the colleges have ever had——hard working and

eager tolearn. __ . ~ .

We have taken one of the "greatest strides forward in .our
entire history towards educational opportunity for all. We
are in the midst of our greatest educational boom. But behind
the boom lies a double barreled crisis that is shooting holes
thr0ugh:.and through the GI Bill of Rights. _

Number one: Our colleges still have ‘not expanded to ac-
comodate all who are and will be knocking on the gates. There

are 2,000,000 more GI’s who have said they want to go to

. collegef In two years an enrollment of 3,000,000, a million

more than the present peak, is a possibility.

After a thorough survey, in early 1947, the New York Times
reported that 99% of the colleges need new buildings and
37% additional teachers. As to housinggon 155 campuses
alone, 340,000 units are needed for 1947-48. _ I

Forveterans some of the admissions squeeze had eased up.
But for civilian high school grads and especially for young
women there is no let up. And only Jewish, Negro, and Italian
students know what trying to crack a college means when

you’re bucking a log jam and a quota system as well.

Number two: Staying in schools has become even more of
a problem than getting into one. On 24 campuses the Ameri-
can Veterans Committee found it costs a single vet——wh0 re-
ceived $65 a month from the VA for his subsistence—$104 to
live. In the picture magazines married vets lead a life of
glamour bringing up baby and cramming for French 1 -in a
quonset hut. In real life they end up atleast 60 bucks. in the
hole. Tuition, rents in crowded college towns, b0oks—inﬂati0n
has spared none. V ' -

“Why in my bio course,” said one New York student,
“they’re getting 6 bucks for a dead c,a_t_:‘-,-they used to get, three
for.” 0 ’
