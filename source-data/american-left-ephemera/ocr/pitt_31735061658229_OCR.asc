“Here comes Molly with the pitcher,” shouted the soldiers,
“Hi, Molly, hurry with that pitcher.” Finally they shortened
it to just “Molly Pitcher”—and the name stuck.

It was the crucial moment of the battle and Molly turned
the tide. She took her place behind ‘her husband’s gun and

There’s a monument to her on the ﬁeld of the Battle of

MANY women have been slandered by the worthy pro-

fessors who write the history books. But few have been as
viciously slandered as Theroigne de Mericourt, daughter of a
French farmer who emerged from the turbulent stream of
the great French Revolution.

Theroigne was born in the little village of Marcourt in
1762 and lived there quietly and peacefully, reading a little
and dreaming a lot about becoming a great singer. Her oper-
atic ambitions were cut short by the upheaval in France.

As a daughter of the rising middle classes which were deter-
mined to oust the corrupt feudal aristocracy from its power,
she was caught up in the spirited mood of the times. Everybody
was talking. Everybody was debating.

Orations and manifestoes ﬁlled the air and the people of
Paris and the working people of all France waited and waited
for action. When it didn’t come, they took matters into their
own hands. On July 14, 1789, they stormed the Bastille, the
fortress which symbolized the tyranny of the bejeweled rulers
of France.

Theroigne still watched from a distance. But when on Octo-
ber 6, the women of Paris marched to Versailles to place their
protests and grievances before Queen Marie Antoinette, The-
roigne was there among them.

Marie Antoinette——-she’s the one who said, “Let them eat
cake,” when she was told the French people had no bread—

.11

    

  

had the women driven from the palace by soldiers. Theroigne
mingled among the men, exhorting them not to shoot upon
their helpless sisters.

From this time on, she took an active part in the political
life of Paris. All activity was centered around so-called “clubs,”
one of which she founded herself. The program of Club Amis
de la Lois (Friends of the Law) was to achieve the revolu-
tion “by peaceful means, education and enlightenment.” Her
interest in this rather anmmic program soon waned. She be-
came an active champion for the rights of women—which
were entirely neglected though the air was thick with talk about
the rights of man. _

Theroigne’s group said that if women had the right to mount
the scaffold and die for their political activities they certainly
had the right to mount the political tribune. ’

“Citoyennes,” she called, “why do we not enter into rivalry
with men? They pretend that they alone have the right to
achieve glory. No, indeed, this should not be. We also wish to

i merit the civic crown, to compete for the honor of dying for
the liberty which is perhaps dearer to us than to them, because
the eifects of despotism weigh more heavily upon us than upon

them.”

In 1790 she returned to her native village to carry the mes-
sage of liberty, equality and fraternity to the "peasants. The
vengeance of the aristocracy reached out for her in this isolated
section. She was kidnapped and carried off to Austria, the shel-
ter of all the French aristocrat-plotters who escaped the guillo-
tine. For six months she was kept in the Kufstein fortress and
ﬁnally brought to trial on November 24-, 1791.

The charges against her were ridiculous. First, she was ac-
cused of having attempted to murder Marie Antoinette on
October 6, at the head of “a wild mob of women.” Second,

12

 

she was charged with trying to bribe the soldiers at Versailles.
She defended herself valiantly:

“My ideas are what they are and it is useless for you to use
eloquent words and gestures to contradict me. The truth is
that I am a fervent patriot and a good citizen. You condemn
the republic; that is your duty. I, on the other hand, I condemn
the monarchy and I think I am right in doing so. Besides I have
only one hope. This is that the principles of ’89 and the ac-
knowledgment of the rights of man will prevail throughout
Europe and in every country in the world. In this work I have
tried to help freedom.”

She was acquitted and upon her return to Paris was hailed
as a heroine. By this time, the struggle between the party of
moderation, the Girondists——they stood for a constitutional
monarchy——and the revolutionary party, the ]acobins——they
wanted a democratic republic—had reached its height. The

‘ division grew sharper daily, and in the meantime the remnants

of the aristocracy, ﬁghting for their lives, continued to plot
counter—revolutionary treachery with foreign countries.

On August 10, 1792, popular rage against these plotters
broke loose. Mass demonstrations and ﬁghting ﬁlled the streets
of Paris. Theroigne was right in the midst of it and her bravery
was rewarded with a civic crown of glory from the Popular
Assembly. -

But her-ideals of women’s rights brought down upon her
head the criticism. of the “reformers” who ﬁrmly believed that
woman’s place was in the home. She had also begun to make
enemies because she realized that the friction between the two
factions would only lead to the weakening of the revolution.

“Danger must unite u:."l’ she cried. But in vain. Her eﬁorts
won her the enmity of both sides and the most furious cam-
paign of calumny against ‘her. She was painted as a wild and

13

  

crazy creature, who stamped around in army boots, armed to
the teeth and shouting for blood. It is this picture that the his-

torians, mentioned above, have seized upon. Broken by the
strain and heartache, her mind gave Way and for the last.
.twenty years of» her life she was shut away in an institution

    

for the insane. This supplied the ﬁnal ammunition. But The-
roigne de Mericourt was a ﬁne, brave woman, a worthy repre-
sentative of the women of France in the days of 1789.

>l< >i< >24

In the ﬁrst quarter of the nineteenth century, the world was
busy recovering from wiarstof conquest. People began to look
about them and see that even in times of peace there were
many wrong: to be rig/tted.

Lucretia Mott

REMEMBER the pictures of the lovely Quaker ladiesin
their simple gray gowns and snowy White ke-rchiefs and
caps? Gentle, soft—spoken ministers of mercy. That’s how they
were painted for us in school books, and that’s what many of
them were in the struggle for the freedom of the slaves.

Lucretia Mott, pioneer of the Abolitionist movement in the
United States, was one of those Quaker ladies. Born on the
little island of Nantucket, in 1.793, the.daug'hter of’ an adven-
turous whaling captain who was an. ardent Quaker, she got her
education at the Friends Schools. At .the age of 15, she became
an assistant teacher at their school in New York City.

14

 

At 18, she married James Mott and settled in Philadelphia.
Her lovely voice was soon heard at the Quaker meetings, raised
against’ the horror and barbarism -of slavery. -

In 1818 she made a trip through the South to see for her-
self how the slaves were treated. She was so incensed by what
she saw that she started out on a ten weeks’ lecture tour during
which she held 71 meetings in almost as many towns, calling
on the people, in her kind, gentle manner, to band together

I against slavery.

By l833, when the movement had gained strength and sup-
port, she was one of the four Women delegates at the First
National Abolitionist Congress representing ten states. The
path of these ardent foes of slavery was not smooth. In the
South——lynching, mob violence, prices on their heads. Three
hundred white persons were lynched in Southern states during
the last 21 years of abolitionist activity. In the North, incited
mobs broke up their meetings, burned their headquarters, tarred
and feathered their leaders.

Mobs tried to break up Mrs. Mott’s meetings regularly. But
she stood her ground, proud and digniﬁed and more determined
than ever. As President of the Female Anti-Slavery Society
she went to London in 1848 to attend the first World Con-
gress Against Slavery. _

With the other women delegates she was relegated to the
balcony. Woman’s place was still out of politics in Victorian
England. It was i-n this balcony that she met a spirited young
woman named Elizabeth Cady Stanton who had come to Lon-
don on her honeymoon and left it determined tolorganize a
powerful movement for women’s rights. Mrs. Mott encour-
aged the young lady. She helped her organize the first woman’s
rights convention, held at Seneca Falls, N. Y., in July, 1848.
The two battles became fused into one for Lucretia Mott.

15

  

    

“The unequal condition of women in society,” she told her
audiences from then on, “was clearly impressed upon my
mind. Learning while at school that the charge for the educa-
tion of girls was the same as for boys, and that when they
become teachers, women received but half as much as men for
their services, the injustice of this was so apparent thatll early
resolved to claim for my sex all that an impartial Creator has
bestowed.”

From here it was just one more step to the recognition of
the basic social problem.

“The oppression of the working classes by existing mono-
polies and the lowness of wages often engaged my attention
and for more than 25 years I have held many meetings with
them and heard their appeals with compassion and ‘a great
desire for radical change in the system that makes the rich
richer‘ and the poor poorer. . . .” ~

Mrs. Mott’s economics were, of course, based entirely on the
warm kindness of her heart. She could only protest. She was
ready to offer no solution’.

Hczrrzlet Tubman

ANY white women, besides Mrs. Mott, did noble work
in the cause of abolitionism-——notable work that brought
results. But none of them accomplished as mu-ch or so splen-
didly as’ one little Negro woman, an escaped slave, named Har-
riet Tubman. A

 

HARRIET TUBMAN

After her own mira-culous escape over the mountains into
fr-eedom, she not only led more than 300 men, women and

 

children out of bondage single—handed, but she organized these"

escapes into freedom through the underground railroad in an
absolutely undetectable manner. I

She literally became the “Moses” of her people. Her child-
hood on a Maryland plantation was ﬁlled with horror. Like all
the little black children she had to go into the cotton ﬁelds to
work almost as soon as she was able to stand. Because she was
a sickly youngster, the master and the overseers were always
threatening to sell her down the river——away from her own
family.

Once while she lay on her sick bed, the master actually
came into their wretched hovel with two dealers who haggled
over how much they would offer for her. .

Finally she decided to escape. Better to die ‘on the road to
freedom than live a slave. One evening she walked slowly past
the rickety dwellings of the slave quarters singing in a loud
and mournful voice:

I’m sorry friends to leave you

F arezvell, 0/t farewell.

But‘ I’ll meet you in the morrzirzg
F arezvell, 0/z farewell.

W/zen you read; the promised land

On the other side of Jordan ~
I’ll be zvaiitug tlzere to greet you

For I’m bound for the promised land.

Just another beaten slave girl singing, thought the overseers.
But her peo-ple—-whom these overseers had driven into song
by forbidding them to speak together—-knew what she meant,
and the next morning she was gone.

18

Harriet Tubman came back into the land of slavery on 19
different trips. They knew she was coming. Each time, before
she arrived, the evening air around the slave dwellings was
ﬁlled with the sorrowful sound of tired voices raised in song:

Go down, Mose:

PVay down in Egypi /./md
Tell 01’ P/mrao/z

To let my people go.

And the news spread from plantation to plantation. The
slave owners and their bloodhounds, human and otherwise,
hunted this elusive “Moses” but they never dreamed of hunting
a small, frail Negro woman in a faded old sun-bonnet.

John Brown recognized her genius. He knew how she had
led her footsore, weary people over mountains and rivers,
through swamps and byroads. Armed with a rusty old pistol
in one hand, and with the other leading a little child or carry-
ing a baby, she marched them to the “Land of Canaan.”

John Brown considered her one of his ﬁrst lieutenants. But
he respected her disguise and always referred to her as “he.”
VVhile he was making his magniﬁcent, desperate, lost battle for
freedom at Harper’s Ferry, Harriet Tubman was rushing
around New York trying to recruit more men, more aid, more
funds for him. .

-Later, John Brown’s conquerors themselves realized her
greatness. During the Civil War, she was invited by the United
States government to act as an oﬂicial scout and spy for the
Union armies in the South. She agreed. Nothing was too dan-
gerous for Harriet Tubman if it would aid the battle for free-
dom. Her work proved invaluable to the ‘high command.

Only the midnight stars witnessed the heroic work of this
truly wonderful woman. She never had the gratiﬁcation t-hat

19

 

comes with public recognition and applause. But she will live
on in the hearts of all who learn her story as one of the most
splendid, courageous Women that ever lived.

Simultaneously with the developing struggle for the free-
dom of the Negro slaves from chattel bondage, a labor mow-
ment was growing up in /4m-erica dedicated to the freedom of
industrial slaves.

Sam}; Bagley

COMMON-SCHOOLED New England female fac-

tory operative.” That’s how the newspapers of the early
nineteenth century referred to Sarah Bagley, one of the ﬁrst
American Women to rise to a position of leadership in the
American labor movement.

The exact date of her birth is not known and ‘her early youth
was no different from that of any working girl in the New
England of that day. Days ﬁlled with twelve to fourteen hours
of hard, -back—breaking toil in the textile mills-—no sunshine,
no fun, no youth. ~

We ﬁrst really hear about her in 1845 by which time she
had organized a Female Labor Reform Association in Lowell,

wMassac'huset.ts. Lowell, Massachusetts-, was the logical place

for such an organization. One of the earliest strikes in Ameri-
can history occurred there among the women textile workers.
Her next step was to establish and edit a newspaper called

20

 

~ q—-— -— —«——(

 

- -a—-— -— —«——f

the Voice of Industry. This paper and Miss Bagley herself
stumped up and down New England campaigning for the ten-
hour day.

The activity of Sarah Bagley, textile worker, was neither
isolated nor unusual. As far back as 1824- American working
women in many industries——needle, textile and s’hoe——had or-
ganized and conducted powerful strikes that slowly and pain-
fully wrested better working conditions from the -mill owners.
The “tailoresses” of New York held the fort for ﬁve weeks
in their demand for higher Wages. Mill hands all over New
England———young girls and old women—-braved the militia and

\ sang and marched on their picket lines.

Sarah Bagley is responsible for one other accomplishment in
behalf of American working women. She spoke and wrote and
campaigned until she secured the ‘formation of a legislative in-
vestigation commission to look into the unhuman Working con-
ditions in the textile mills. V

She is the ﬁrst to emerge in the arena of American trade
unionism as a leader, as a strong, unifying force among all the
women in American industry.

France; Wrzég/at

FROM Scotland came another champion of the economic
and political rights of American women. Frances Wright
adopted this country and its Working people as her own.
When she ﬁrst came here on a visit in 1818, the plight of
the Negro slaves consumed all her attention. She was already a

21

devoted follower of Robert Owen and his utopian idealism. In
fact he considered her one of his ablest assistants and -had made

her the editor of his newspaper, the New Harmony Gazette. S

Frances Wright was determined to translate her ideals into
reality for the Negro slaves. She bought a largetract of land
in Tennessee and proceeded to turn it into a colony for freed
slaves. This dream ended in complete failure, of course, sur-
rounded as it was by a hostile and unchanged social system.

This was Frances Wright’s last attempt at utopian dream-

islands. On her second trip to America, she was already a firm
believer in the necessity for independent political and economic
activity of the working class. She turned all her energies and
abilities into these channels and ‘helped found the first labor
party in the United States. This party, called the Working
Men’s Party, ran candidates in New York in the election of
1830 on a platform based entirely upon the needs of the Work-
ing class. It was the ﬁrst to demand political equality for
women alongside of its general demands for labor.

Frances Wright was considerably ahead of her times. She

was one of the earliest to understand that society was based on

the relationships between two classes and that the interests of
these classes -could never -be identical, that the conflict between
them was inevitable——and that only by independent action in
industry and in politics could the working class work out its
own salvation and ﬁnal emancipation.

  Sumn B. Anthony *

 V ODAY Susan B. Anthony has been oﬂicially adopted as E? 

J’ . - one of America’s great women. The amendment which’ I
won for American women the right to vote is called the
“Susan B. Anthony Amendment.” P I J
has even decorated a 3c postage stamp series with her portrait. y
But at the height of her‘ career in the middle of the last cen- *
tury, she was denounced and lampooned and cartooned as ‘
everything from a “revolutionary ﬁrebrand” to a “cracked old f
maid.” ‘S

Susan Brownell Anthony was one of the most aggressive and 
 clear—t'hinking of the many women who led the movement 
Q for women’s rights in America. Born in ' home l

She became an active temperance campaigner, especially
among women. But she was at the same time actively inter-
ested in the abolitionist cause and in the budding movement
for women’s rights.
The first convention for women’s rights to be held in Amer-
ica, in July, 1848, attracted her attention, though she herself
did not attend.
This conventionlwas the result of the meeting. between Eliz-
abeth Cady Stanton and Mrs. Lucretia Mott in London. Both
'3 had been forced to sit in the balcony of the World Anti-Slavery
Convention, and the younger woman, Mrs. Stanton, came back
to America determined to wage a'ﬁg‘ht to the ﬁnish for equal
rights for her sisters.

The first step was the Seneca Falls convention. Its call was
accompanied by a Declaration of Independence-rewritten
from the original: T ‘

“The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries
and usurpation on the part of man towards woman, having in
direct object the establishment of absolute tyranny over her.
To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.

_ “He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right

\/“He has made her, if married, in the eyes of the law,

“After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if
-she be single and the owner of property, he has taxed her to
support. a government which recognizes her only when her
p operty can be proﬁtable to it.

“He has denied her the facilties for obtaining an education,
all colleges being closed against her.

“He has created a' false sentiment by giving to the world
a diﬁerent code of morals for men and women, whereby moral

Mrs. Stanton. Together they set out to do a great work. Eliz-
abeth‘ Cady Stanton ‘immediately recognized a potential lieu-
tenant in the tall, serious Susan. Their combined efforts com-
plemented each other. It took some time for Susan to realize
that temper‘ance»crusades were largely a‘ Waste of energy and
that drunkenness was a result and not a cause of economic ills.

But when she did come to this conclusion, she threw all her
energies into a combined  ery

\_rr_1ere Proclamation of Emancipation. .

In their _campaign7Yt"h‘e“ballot both Miss Anthony and Mrs.
Stanton came to grips with the law. Determined to make a test
case of _women’s right to vote, Susan B. Anthony simply.went
to the polls and cast her ballot for the President of the United
States. She was promptly arrested and her trial became a
splendid forum’ for agitation against discrimination.

Mrs. Stanton went her one better and announced her can-
didacy for Congress in the Eighth Congressional District in
New York City. The law, she said, only forbade women to
vote and not to run for oﬂice.

 

“Belonging to a disfranchised class,” the platform stated,

26

 

 

“I have no political antecedents to recommend me to your
support; but my creed is free speech, free press, free men and
free trade—-—the.cardinal points of democracy.”

Needless to say, she was not elected.
It was during this same time that the labor movement of
p the United States was making its ﬁrst real strides towards or-
§ ganization after so many glorious -beginnings and defeats. Susan
B. Anthony was approached by the leaders of the Labor Union
Congress to help organize the women. S'he accepted the task
and Went from industry to industry studying the conditions of
the women workers and urging them to organize.
She founded the Working Women’s Association of Amer-
_ ica. Her contact with these Women took her way ahead of the

Louise Mikel

THE workers of Paris had just completed one of the most
difficult military feats. For ﬁve months, from September,
1870, to January, 1871, they had defended their city against
the ﬁerce attack of a superior army—the victorious German
army which had defeated their stuffed-shirt emperor at Sedan
and had subjugated all France. There was nothing to eat, no
communication with the rest of France, little to ﬁght with,‘
save the determination that their city should not fall into the
hands of the conquerors. _

The government which had taken the place of the tinsel
empire proved itself different in name only. It was called re-
public, but it served the interests of the same bankers, land-
lords, usurers and industrialists who had sweated the Workers
with the consent of Emperor Louis Napoleon. This govern-
ment ﬁnally ordered the workers of Paris to surrender, but
when it tried to take their "guns away——guns which theyh-ad
paid for out of their own pockets—-they refused. And they
determined to defy these betrayers and set up a government of
their own. _

This was not a hasty decision. For several years before the
disastrous war with Germany, Paris had been seething with
political ferment and upheaval. True, it was mostly debate and
theorizing, but the idea that the people could rule themselves
was ﬁrmly planted and when they saw that a republic run by
their exploiters was no different than an empire run for them,
they decided to take action.

28

 

 

Louise Michel was a true product of that political upheaval.
Born in the country, brought up on the estate of ‘her grand-
father, a liberal nobleman who sincerely believed in the doc-
trines of the great French Revolution and hated tyranny, she
had been forced to earn her own living from very early youth.
Because she refused to swear an oath of allegiance‘ to the
"tyrant emperor she was not given a state post as teacher, a
position for which she was qualiﬁed. She struggled to ﬁnd
work in small private schools in Paris but her heart and ener-
gies were devoted to the work of the revolutionary clubs in
the workers’ neighborhoods.

From the first moment of the Paris Commune, born in the
dawn of March 18, when the women of Paris persuaded the
soldiers sent against them to fraternize with the people and
turn against their betraying generals, Louise Michel was in the
front lines. Every minute of the 74- short days of the existence
of the Commune Louise Michel worked for its success. She
organized classes for women, communal kitchens and kinder-
gartens, nursing corps for the front; clubs for the education
and organization of working women. And when all that seemed
left to do was to die in defense of the first workers’ govern-
ment in the history of the world, Louise Michel took up arms
and went to the barricades.

She was arrested on the last barricade to be taken by the
soldiers of the murderous republic. Thiers, the president who
was ready to sell his country in return for aid from Bismarck
to crush the Commune, gave orders to drown it in blood.
Thousands of men, Women and children were slaughtered in
the streets of Paris. Hundreds, who were taken alive, were
triedaby drumhead courts-martial, forced to dig their own
graves and mowed down by firing squads.

Louise Michel ‘was kept in a prison for six months before

she was tried and though she demanded the death penalty-—
“I f you do not kill me I shall never cease to call for vengeance
against the murclererx of my brothers,” she cried——she was sen-
tenced to lifelong exile instead.

For eight years she lived in a penal colony on the island of
New Caledonia. But even here she was not idle. She learned
the language of the natives; wrote several books describing
their customs and tried to organize them to rebel against their
French exploiters. ~

Freed by a general amnesty in 1880, she went right -back into
active work in the revolutionary movement. In 1883 she was
once more arrested——this time for marching at the head of a
tremendous demonstration of unemployed demanding bread.

Three more years of her life were spent behind bars, and .

upon her release she traveled all over Europe carrying the mes-
sage of organization and revolt against tyranny.

In 1888 when she was speaking at a meeting in Le Havre,
a young man, incited by the vicious attack which the church
had been conducting against her as the embodiment of “anti-
Christ,” attempted to assassinate her. Fortunately she was only
slightly wounded and appeared in court to defend her assail-
ant. She accused the capitalist system which had made of this
backward young worker its tool. And of course he was ac-
quitted.

Until the day she died in 1905, Louise Michel was one of
the most active political propagandists in Europe.‘ A ‘brilliant
speaker, she held her audiences enthralled as she painted before
their eyes the vision of a free society, a world without hunger
or misery or exploitation. She succumbed to pneumonia at the
age of 75 in Marseilles and her body was brought by train to
Paris. All along the route tremendous demonstrations of the
entire working population honored her memory.

LARA ZETKIN was one of those women who can truly

be said to have belonged to the whole world. By a life of
complete unselfishness and devotion to the cause of peace and
freedom she earned the title of the grand old lady of the revo-
lutionary movement. .

Though she was born in Germany and her ﬁrst interest
was always the welfare of her own people, this courageous
woman battled for the rights and liberties of the working peo-
ple of the whole world. The problems of the young students
in China, the young peasants of Russia, the women of Amer-
ica were her problems.'

A brilliant writer and an even more brilliant orator, all her
talents were devoted to her chosen cause. One of her ﬁrst
undertakings was the editing of a Socialist paper for women’s
rights called Gleichkeit (Equality). It was in this. paper that
she raised the battle for women’s rights from a mere ﬁght for
suﬂrage to an international political struggle for complete
equality, pointing out that without making the fight for wo-

. men’s rights and winning their support—-part and parcel of

the whole struggle for the emancipation of mankind——-success
could never be achieved.

Clara Zetkin’s energies were never hemmed into one chan-
nel of activity. She became one of the outstanding leaders of the
German Socialist movement, the international Socialist move-
ment. At the same time she never missed an opportunity to

31

   

champion the special problems of the women of the whole
world.

She was one of the ablest ﬁghters against the World War.

Clara Zetkin’s great mind was equalled only by her great
heart. She not only made use of the sword of keenest analysis
to slash through the lies and propaganda of the warmongers.
There were facts, ﬁgures, incontrovertible evidence proving the
imperialist nature and aims of world slaughter. But, in addi-
tion, Clara Zetkin appealed to the hearts, to the finest feelings
3f the millions who were called upon to murder each other so
as to pour more gold into the coffers of the few——-the bankers,
the munitions magnates, the ﬁnanciers.

All who heard or read her Words could not help but be
moved to a desire for action.

Her last years were spent as president of the International
Labor Defense. Under her inspiring guidancethis organization
conducted its work in 72 countries for defense and relief for
political prisoners and their families-—victims of the terror and
reaction which Clara Zetkin had always fought.

In the last popular elections held in Germany before Hitler
turned that country into one huge concentration ‘camp——im—
prisoning democracy, freedom of thought and conscience along
with the broken bodies of those who dared oppose him——Clara
Zetkin was elected to the Reichstag on the Communist ticket.
As the oldest member elected, she opened that parliament in
keeping with the old German tradition. ~

And though her age had already made her body weak and
inﬁrm, she held one of her most brilliant and memorable ad-
dresses.‘ Like an ancient prophetess she stood in the rostrum of
the Reichstag building condemning the Nazis for the brutality
they had already shown, calling upon the German people to
unite against the menace of fascism, calling upon the people of
the whole world to organize for peace.

In her death, at the age of 75, the world lost one of the
most valiant "advocates and workers for peace and freedom.

Nadyezda Kmlvrkaya

T the turn of the last century the revolutionary move-
ment in tsarist Russia was just beginning to take on a
cohesive organizational form, emerging from utopian theoriz-
ing and daring terrorism. Many heroic men and women had
given their lives in earlier years in glorious though vain at-
tempts to rid that huge land of the tyrants who were crushing
its -people. Many of the attempts had been successful——even one
mighty tsar, Alexander II, had been blown from the face of
the earth. But tyranny continued, as ruthless and cruel‘ as ever.
Among the valiant successors of the early martyrs was a
young school teacher named Nadyezda (Hope) Krupskaya.
She had begun her revolutionary activity in» 1891 and
through her work in the Sunday Evening Adult Schools she
was able to establish Contact between workers in key industries.
These schools were one of the few reforms forced from the
reluctant tsarist government. Its power rested on .keeping the
workers and peasants in darkest and deepest ignorance. And
its tyrannical rulers could read the handwriting on the wall.
Krupskaya was one of the ablest and most ‘beloved teachers.
When V. I. Lenin came to work in Petersburg in 1893, she was
in a position to be very instrumental in helping him unify the
scattered forces of the various revolutionary groups and study
circles into the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the

Working Class, the nucleus of the powerful Bolshevik Party
of the future.

In 1898 she was arrested and exiled to Siberia. There she
joined Lenin, who had been arrested about a year earlier. They
were married in that frozen wasteland, and in all the years
that followed—years of exile, in Munich, Brussels, Paris, Lon-
don, Geneva-—this woman carried out the double duty of
making a home for Lenin, helping him in all his work and
doing her own heavy assignments. She was secretary of the
Iskra, secreta9y of the Bolshevik fraction in the Social—Demo-
cratic Party, and in complete charge of all illegal correspon-
dence with the underground movement in Russia.

Between these heavy duties she found time to write the
first socialist booklet on the problem of the working woman,
and one of the most signiﬁcant treatises on Popular Education

and Democracy, the first attempt to deal with the problem of .

education of the working people on a Marxian basis.

Upon return from exile in 1917, Krupskaya assumed the
arduous duties of the “first lady of Soviet Russia,” as Clara.
Zetkin called her:

“She is undoubtedly first in Willingness and forgetfulness of
self, in sacrifices to the cause of the toilers and the oppressed.
The closest community of ideas and work in life bound her to
Lenin. Impossible to think of him without thinking of her.
Shewas Lenin’s right hand—-his most convinced comrade in
thought, the most experienced exponent and agent of his views,
as untiring in gaining friends and adherents for the master
of genius with strength and wisdom, as in carrying on propa-
ganda for the working class.”

During the trou-bled years of the civil war and'in'tervention
against the Soviet Union, she was at his side—.-—aiding, helping
to shoulder the terriﬁc burden of beating back" the enemy and

35

    
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
   
   
  
   

organizing the huge, unwieldy mass of 150,000,000 people
into the army of buildersof socialism.

Since Lenin’s death, she has devoted herself exclusively to
her ﬁrst love—the problem of educating the sons and daughters
of the people. ‘

La Pariomzria 0

I) OLORES IBARRURI is perha-ps the most famous wo-

man in Spain today, which almost automatically means one
of the most famous womenin the world.
The daughter and then the wife of a Spanish miner, she has
lived through all the heart—breaking misery and poverty that
were the lot of Spanish womanhood under the kings, queens,
dukes, marquises and Gil Robles republic. Her own home was
no different from the millions of hunger-ridden dwellings of
the Spanish working people and peasants.
That was why Dolores was always able to understand not
only the needs but the thoughts of her people and to realize
that the only way out lay in ﬁghting for freedom. From 1930
onward, her voice began to be heard in the press, from the
platform, rallying the people for militant defense of their
rights. She gained national renown during Spain’s October of
1934, in those glorious days when the miners of Asturias took
up arms against fascism. Dolores Ibarruri was with them -behind
their barricades, encouraging them, helping. It is little wonder
-that in the elections which followed in February, 1936, she
was elected to the Popular Front Parliament.

36

 

Today she is one of the outstanding leaders among the he-
roic defenders of democracy in Spain. One of the ﬁnest regi-
ments in the people’s militia has taken her name. Her husband
and four sons are at the front. She herself divides her time
between the front and the rear guard, inspiring all who come
in contact with her and her great courage. She has traveled to
many countries of Europe to mobilize support—-moral and
ﬁnancial aid—for the defenders of democracy and their wives
and" children‘.

Back in America

HEN President Wilson, elected on a platform of keeping
this country out of War, suddenly “decided” that we had
to ﬁght to “make the world safe for democracy,” American
Women made their voices heard in powerful andeﬂective protest.
One of them was Rose Pastor Stokes, a young cigar maker,
whose devotion to the cause of her class won scarcely an inch
in the newspapers .but ‘Whose marriage to a millionaire made the
front pages. Rose Pastor Stokes never for one moment of her
life forgot her own people and among her many accomplish-
ments was an effective campaign against the world slaughter.
She was arrested and given a ten-year prison sentence for her
pains but President Wilson was forced to pardon her.

In Kansas City, Missouri, Kate Richards O’Hare got ﬁve
years in that state penitentiary for the same “crime.” Dozens of
women all over the land got shorter terms for daring to‘say
that they didn’t want their sons, husbands, brothers, murdered
in at war for plunder. ’

/W02‘/967’ fame;

MARY JONES won the title of “Mother” from the

American labor movement as a badge of glory. She was
one of the most dramatic ﬁgures in the struggles of the coal
miners at the beginning of our century. Perhaps her greatest
contribution to the labor movement which she adopted as her
own was the lesson that public opinion must be won to the
side of the strikers by every means of publicity and dramatiza-
tion of their plight. Mother Jones represented nobody but her-
self and this individualism weakened many of her worthy ef-
forts. Still, her ability to center the glaring searchlight of pub-
licity on an economic crisis, her untiring devotion to the cause
she had undertaken, call for recognition and profound admi-
ration.
‘ ‘With her own courage, she inspired all those around her.
During one miners’ strike‘, she organized the miners’ wives to
march into the teeth of the militia and the gunmen, armed only
with mops and brooms. They would wipe out scabbing, they
shouted!

During a textile strike she gathered together an‘army of
child laborers—their little ﬁngers chopped off by machines, their
faces gray and drawn-——right onto the lawn of President Theo-
dore Rooseve'lt’s palatial summer home at Oyster Bay, Long
Island. If the President wasn’t going to see the situation
Mother Jones was there to show it to him.

She lived to be 100 years old and lies today in a grave in a

0N E of the most colorful and beloved ﬁgures in the Amer-
ican labor movement is Ella Reeve Bloor, approaching her
seventy—ﬁfth birthday this Vsummer——a' real veteran who says
she has no time to grow old and tired because there is too
much to be done.

Her ancestry dates back to colonial days. Her forefathers
fought in the Revolutionary War, and the Civil War. She can
truly be said to embody the best and ﬁnest traditions of free-
dom and democracy.

Her career as a labor organizer has taken her to every state
in the Union, to workers in every basic industry, to the farm-
ers, the students, the teachers-—every section of the population
that Works by hand or brain.

To the miners of Pennsylvania and Colorado, to the textile
workers in Massachusetts and North, Carolina she is Mother
Bloor, who helped them organize their unions and their strikes,
who encouraged them with her experience, her lessons, and her
great and warm enthusiasm. ’

The record of Mother Bloor’s life is the history of the
American labor movement during the last 50 years. She was
among the coal miners at Ludlow, Colorado, when they were
massacred by John D. Rockefeller’s orders. She was among

the farmers of Nebraska and South Dakota and Pennsylvania
when they organized their Holiday associations and stopped
foreclosures of the land they had tilled and cultivated for gen-
erations.

She was on the death watch in Charlestown, Massachusetts,
when‘ the good shoemaker and the poor fish peddler, Nicola
Sacco and Bartholomeo Vanietti, were martyred to the cause
of freedom.

Surrounded by the love of her own children and grand-
children Whose welfare and education she has found time to
supervise carefully and with the most motherly concern, she
has adopted all the young people of America as her own.

When she was thrown into jail in Nebraska two years ago
for helping young girls in a creamery organize a strike against
inhuman conditions, she Won the admiration and' respect of
the vmost hardened victims of present-day society who were
her cell-mates. . T

From her smiling eyes she encourages us to stand up for
our rights, defend our heritage of freedom and democracy,

. and help build a worldof peace, plenty and happiness for all.

FOLLOWING in the footsteps of Mother Bloor is an-

other splendid figure who, though much younger, has
almost as great a following among the men and women who
till the soil and mine the coal and make the steel. They all know

“Gurley” Flynn, whose great, encouraging voice called to
them to ﬁght to the ﬁnish in some of the greatest economic bat-
tles of the century —— Calumet ———- Passaic —— Paterson, New
Jersey.

The foreign-born who came to these shores in search of
liberty and found themselves facing deportation “back Where
they came from” in the post-war “Red” hysteria know her
too and love her for the energetic anti-deportation drive she
organized in their behalf.

The steel workers who fought the battle of 1919 remember
her and the self-sacriﬁcing work she did in their behalf, organ-
izing public opinion to back them up. ,

Her greatest work still lies before her, and all who work
near her say: More power to you, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.

Art; Science, [ndumy

N ‘MORE peaceful spheres—-but meeting up with many o-f

the same diﬁiculties-———women have pioneered and battled for
their standing and their beliefs and won glory for themselves
and their sisters. . f

In the world of science, the name of Madame Marie Curie
will be enshrined for all time to come for her great Work in
the discovery of radium as a cure for disease. It took years of
literal slavery in the laboratory, days and nights of soul-scorch-
ing toil, ability to face the sneers of cynics, but Madame Curie
with true scientiﬁc devotion stuck to her post and Won.

The name of Florence Nightingale has come to be synon-

ymous with mercy and comfort to the suffering. Fearless,
selﬂess, this young Woman left her native England in 1854 to
go oﬂ’ to the Crimean War. Nursing was considered all right
in the calm and silent halls of whatever hospitals there were
in those years. But a woman on a battleﬁeld among dying and
wounded men——where she was really needed—-that shocked
Victorian England. Many obstacles, all the Way from official
orders to slander, were put in her way; But Florence Night-
ingale didn’t look upon a nurse’s uniform as a costume in a
play. To her it was truly a uniform of mercy And her pioneer-
ing work bore fruit.

We American women have the honor of knowing that it
was one of us who single—handed fought'——and won——for wo-
men to have the right to study medicine and become doctors.
It was the accepted thing for women to act as midwives, bas-
ing their practice on old Wives’ tales, legends and superstitions,
which cost the lives "of untold thousands of mothers and chil-
dren. But it was another story for women ‘to study medicine
and become practicing physicians.

Elizabeth Blackwell was the ﬁrst to ﬁght for this right.
Elizabeth applied to college after college and, undaunted by
insulting refusals, continued her quest. Her perseverance was
rewarded by a diploma, the ﬁrst ever to be granted to a woman
anywhere in the world. ,But her own triumph did not satisfy
Dr. Blackwell. She did not rely upon her example alone to
pave the way for other women to follow. She went to England
and to France and not only established her own right to study
and practise but the rights of all women.

In the ﬁeld of letters and scholarship, the names of women
are to be found in the foremost ranks. But in addition to their

talents many of them had to employ many other means to V

secure recognition and publication. Interestingly enough, two of

the greatest ﬁgures in world literature had to hide behind men’s
names—Georges Sand of France and George Eliot of Eng-
land——to get their works published. It is not at all strange that
both these women were active forces in the political struggle
for rights for women in addition to devoting their time and
talents to the creation of great works of art.

Harriet Beecher Stowe, an outstanding American writer,
used her pen for the cause of humanity and stood her ground
against all critics. Her Uncle Tom’: Cabin waslone of the very
powerful weapons in the hands of the A-bolitionist movement
in winning support for the battle against slavery.

In our own day we have Dr. Mary Beard, recognized on
all fronts as one of America’s outstanding historians. We have
Josephine Johnson, whose ~ brilliant talent has won her the
Pulitzer prize in literature and who has devoted that talent
to the cause of labor. Lillian Wald, now 70 years old, has
devoted most of those years to bringing culture, hope and en-
couragement to youth in the poverty-stricken neighborhoods
of New York City. Though her ﬁeld was social work, her
writings have created a valuable ﬁeld of study in social welf are.

In the ﬁeld ofindustry, women to this day——-except in the
Soviet Union——have had little opportunity to show what they
can do. They are still relegated to the least skilled and un-
skilled labors. They are not given the opportunity to advance.
They are kept on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder in
order to keep the general level of wages low and to divide the
ranks of the laboring population.

In the Soviet Union, however, where there is not only equal
opportunity but equal pay for equal work, in every branch of
industry, women have emerged as leaders in every ﬁeld of
production. Women engineers have built bridges, dams, rail-
roads, canals. They run the biggest factories.

When the miner Stakhanov revolutionized Soviet produc-
tion, two girls immediately followed suit in their industries——
Dusya V inogradova in textile and Marie Demchenko in agri-
culture. Both are today performing herculean tasks with the
greatest of ease. Of course, the leading role of Women in the
U.S.S.R. is not conﬁned to industry alone. They are in the
foremost ranks of art, science, literature, "education, and occupy
important posts in every branch of the government.

They ﬁll strategic posts in the powerful Red Army. Inci-
dentally, women as military geniuses are nothing new. A lady
named Emma Ella Carroll, quietly and without publicity, sent
herideas for the military maneuvers of the Northern armies
to President Lincoln during our Civil War. She studied their
movements and the maps, and the successful campaign in Ten-
nessee was entirely hers. Almost all of the Northern com-
mand were forced to recognize her, privately, as a real mili-
tary genius.

HERE is one point at which fascism does not discriminate
against women—in the courts and in jail. There, when
they are accused of any labor or political activity they are
treated no differently than men. They are framed the same
way, chained the same way, thrown into the same cells, and
given the same severe sentences.
At this moment in the lands of fascism, there are hundreds
of women political prisoners. Two German anti-fascist wo-

men have paid with their heads on the executioner’s block for
opposing Hitler. Hundreds of them are in concentration camps,
tortured, beaten, held without trial. In Italy, since 1927 alone,
they have been arrested and imprisoned by thousands-—many of
them only because they are the mothers, wives, sisters of mili-
tant anti-fascists. Many, however, are victimized for their own
activity. There is Giorgina Rosetti, a young textile worker
sentenced to 18 years in 1927. There is Camilla Ravera, a
prominent teacher, sentenced to 15 years in 1930 despite the
fact that she was suffering from an advanced stage of tubercu-
losis and serious heart trouble. There are hundreds of these
courageous women who were ready to sacriﬁce their lives and
freedom for the cause of democracy.

In Rumania there is Anna Pauker, a Jewish Working girl,
who at the greatest cost to her health and personal comfort,
educated herself, raised a family of four children, and became
one of the outstanding leaders of the Rumanian trade union
movement. No legal ban could stop Anna Pauker; she deﬁed
them all. In China, India, Japan, women are paying with
their lives and liberty for their activities in the cause of freedom.

In democratic America there are hundreds of women polit-
ical prisoners.

So much for our "outstanding sisters. Perhaps they somewhat
overshadow the rest of us who in our own small communities,
day in and day out, in the unions, in the shops and mills, are
not only helping create the wealth of the world, but slowly and
surely marshaling our forces in defense of our right to a
proper share in the distribution of this wealth. But our numbers
are growing. Where there was one there are today hundreds.

The battle for our rights has only begun in every country
but two. We have the right to vote in a good many countries,
as well as our own, but we still don’t get equal pay for equal

47

 

work. All thebranchels of industry, art, education, public wel-
fare are still not open to us as they should be. We cannot yet
bring up'our children to be healthy, happy citizens of a free,
.happy and prosperous America. But with the glorious heritage
of the past and the splendid promise of the future we are tak-
ing our places in defense of peace, freedom and democracy to
stay until the battle is Won.

HEROINES

INTRODUCTION

WHEN things begin happening very thick and very fast——
well, what was the old proverb: You ccm’t see ‘the forest
because ‘of the trees? The purpose of this pamphlet is to take
a good look at both the forest and the trees. Womenin every
country of the world are doing big things these days and we
American women are right up in the front lines. In industry,
art, science, politics, the voice of woman is deﬁnitely making
itself heard. Sometimes, it’s true, the voices don’t speak the
words we’d all like to hear. Sometimes they speak in favor of
reaction and tyranny and even fascism. But the voices on the
other side of the fence———the voices that speak for peace and
freedom and democracy——are grovving loud and strong. i
We want to take a look back over the history made by some
of our illustrious sisters in order to understand better What ‘is
happening today, in the light of what came before us.

When the women of Michigan—¥—wives, mothers, daughters =

of the auto workers on strike——where the motor kings reign,
organize to help them, the newspapers treat it as the eighth
wonder of the world. And when the ﬁve-and-dime store girls
fold their arms and refuse to slave to make" more millions for
Barbara Hutton to play with——or buy princes--why, that’s
mutiny! Imagine girls and women actually exercising their
economic power, actually organizing into emergency brigades———

in the face of machine guns, national guardsmen, injunctions,
bitter warnings from the auto kings!

When the Women in Spain shoulder guns and go to the
front with the men in a war to the ﬁnish in defense of democ-
racy, they are called everything from Amazons to harpies . . .
tigresses . . . unnatural creatures.

In fact, every time women do anything anywhere that is
ﬁne and brave and splendid, the press and the radio——every
controlled avenue for molding public opinion———begin to hunt
for the right Word to denounce them and “put them back in

their proper place.”

Fascism has clearly stated where that place is, in the coun—'

tries Where it rules—-slavery to the men of the nation. In many
democratic countries the powers that be still maintain that that
place is the home, at the hearthstone, at the cradle, in the
kitchen. '

The time has certainly come to explode this slave theory
once and for all. Since time immemorial women have played
an important and vital role in fashioning the history and the
civilization of our world, in politics, in science, art and industry,
in the factory, in the school room, in the home and on the
platform.

In only two great countries have women received full and
oﬂicial equaIity—in the Soviet Union and in Spain.

It has been said that one measure of any civilization or
society is the manner in which it treats its Women. ‘

The Women mentioned here are only a few of the most
outstanding. We go back only as far as our own American
revolutionary war and the great French revolution—the be-
ginning of so—called modern times, when the rule of feudalism
and titled aristocracy was deﬁnitely overthrown.

It is interesting to note that many of the pioneer women in

6

 

politics and other ﬁelds of social activity come from the so-
called upper classes and eﬁfrom the aristocracy. That is not
diﬂicult to explain. They a he had access to what little means
of education was available to women. They alone had the tools
with which to express themselves and voice the problems of
their sisters. ,

But as we come closer.to our own day, we see that Women
from the real basis of present-day society are emerging as the
leaders and ﬁghters for freedom——daughters of the working
people, the poor farmers, of the soil and all its riches, and most
signiﬁcant, that their number is increasing.

The millions who are called the "common people-—the major-
ity-'———are beginning to come into their own, are beginning to
realize that they are the masters of their own destiny. And we
the women of the people are marching With them, inspired
by the glorious example of the progress of our sisters in the
U.S.S.R., our heroines in Spain,‘ Germany, China, and our
own heroines of Flint, Detroit, New York, Atlanta, Farrell,

,Pa., and all the centers of industry and toil. The past had its

Mollie Pitchers and Rosa Luxemburgs; Louise Michels and
Sophie Perovskayas. The present has its Pasionarias, Mother
Bloors, Women’s brigades and trade union ladies’ auxiliaries.

The girls on the picket lines, the sit-dovivn strikers of today,
have a glorious heritage, a great tradition, and we can well
afford to pause to look back upon it as We move forward to ‘a
world of peace, freedom and democracy.

N the years when American patriots were just beginning to

think about ways and means to rid this land of the tyranny
of the British, a little girl was born into the family of German
peasants who had come to settle in the new world. '

Even in colonial days, the lure of the cities was great, and
Molly Ludwig, as soon as‘ she was old enough, went off to
work in Trenton, New Jersey. Trained for nothing but hard
work, she became a servant in a rich woman’s house. But down
the street there was a young Irish barber named John Hays.
He had a merry twinkle in his eye and a stout heart that beat
for liberty and Molly Ludwig.

Almost immediately after they were married the first shot

for freedom was fired at Lexington, and John Hays was oﬁ‘
to the War for Independence. Molly Went with him. Many
colonial women followed their husbands to the war, kept camp
for them, cooked for the regiments, washed, mended and
cheered the ﬁghters. ' '
' John Hays was sent to join the forces concentrating at Mon-
mouth, New Jersey. The battle at this point was very strategic.
If the British were routed here, the tide of the war would be
turned.

It was a hot June day. The burning sun felled one tired

What she could to help. There was a cool stream behind the

lines and all day long Molly lugged pitchers of water to the.
