tant point. It would be Well for our American Socialists who
are enamoured of democracy to read carefully the following
lines:

“Every given democratic principle,” said Plekhanov,
“must be considered not as an isolated proposition, but in
relation to that principle which can be called the funda-
mental principle of democracy—sa|us populi suprema lex-
(the welfare of the people is the supreme law). Translated
into the language of a revolutionist it means that the suc-
cess of the revolution is the supreme law. If it were neces-
sary for the sake of the revolution temporarily to jimit the

operations of this or that democratic principle, it would be

criminal to question such limitations. My personal view
is that even the principle of universal suffrage can be looked
upon from the democratic principle just enunciated by me.
It can be hypothetically conceived that we, social-democrats,
may declare against universal suffrage. The bourgeoisie of
the Italian republics sometimes denied political rights to
members of the nobility. The revolutionary proletariat could
limit the rights of the upper classes in the same way as the
upper classes limited its rights. The worthiness of such a
measure could be considered entirely from the rule—saIus

revolutiae suprema |ex.”

The draft program carried a provision for the election

of parliament every two years. In discussing-this provision
in connecti-on with the whole question of democracy, Plek-
hanov said: “The same point of View should prevail regarding
the question of the duration of parliament. If the people,
imbued with revolutionary enthusiasm, elected a very good
parliament, it would be our duty to make it a long parliament.
If, on the other hand, the elections proved unfavorable we
should try to disperse it, not within two years, but within
(Quoted from Report of Second Congress of
the Russian Communist Party.)

These golden words, coming from the father of Russian
Marxism, were enthusiastically acclaimed by Lenin and his
followers, who left this Congress nick-named “Bolsheviks.”
When Zinoviev writes about this period of Russian Party
history, he cannot refrain from speaking about the “Bolshe-
vik Plekhanov.” '

The Third Congress met during the Revolution.
It not only formulated the theory of workers’ and peasants’
dictatorship, but raised the slogan for an armed uprising
as the only means of carrying the revolution to a favorable
c-onclusion. The relation to the existing government on the
eve of itsoverthrow," the attitude towards the provisional
government which would come in its place, and toward the
bourgeoisie, were among the important policies adopted at
this Congress which was sitting as a revolutionary war
council.‘

The General Strike.

The General Strike in October was the natural outcome
of the strike movement which was gaining momentum dur-
ing the year, The politic-al character of these strikes be-
came their dominant feature and the workers began to
look upon the isolated stoppages as preludes to greater
demonstrations.

A general strike was originally contemplated for Janu-
ary, 1906, when the so-called Bulygin Duma, referred to above,
was to convene. The railway workers of the Moscow dis-
trict began to strike October 20, with a view to testing
their strength. Other districts followed. In the meantime,
demands for the 8 hour day, amnesty for political prisoners,
and civil liberties were being advanced. The strikes began
railway workers all
over the country, but other industries as well. Within one
Week the strike became general. Economic life was para-
lyzed as a result in all industrial centers. After trying to
liquidate the strike by the force of arms in several cities,
the government admitted its defeat and “granted,” on October
30, a constitutiton with the promise to convene a parlia-
ment. Although the civil liberties granted in the Manifesto
remained onlpaper, and the Duma was a restricted legislative
assembly, the ca.pitulation -of the government proved the

‘power of the general strike employed for political purposes.

The liberal bourgeoisie declared itself completely satis-
ﬂed with the October Manifesto. They wanted a share in
the government and the constitution gave them that. They
were anxious to see the strike liquidated. In this they were
supported by the Mensheviks and some labor unions who
were afraid that the strike might go “too far,” and endanger
its achievements. The Bolsheviks insisted on the continua-
tion of the struggle and counselled further preparations as
the enemy was not en-tirely beaten. Within three days of
the calling off of the strike, the government, in league»with

the so-called Black Hundreds organized a come-back. The
counter—revolution stalked through the land in the form of
Jewish pogroms organized simultaneously in over 100 cities.
Playing upon the religious prejudices of the ignorant and
superstitious people, hired bands of criminal elements pro-
ceeded under police protection to pillage and massacre Jews,
aiming in this manner to terrorize the population. Under
the cover of these instigated disturbances the government
was preparing to liquidate the revolution.

The Soviet is Formed.

While the general strike marked an epoch not only
of the Russian Revolution but of the international labor
movement as well, it fell on a b-y-product of this strike to
become the single outstanding contribution of the revolu-
tion. When the general strike was spreading in Petersburg
it became evident that a body would have to be formed

58

to take charge of the conduct of the strike and exercise
other functions which -the exigencies of the moment might
demand. There were two revolutionary parties whichwere
appealing to the laboring masses:—the Social-Democratic and
the ‘Social-Revolutionary. In addition, the ﬁrst was divided
into two distinct groups which to all intents and purposes
were functioning as separate parties. No single political
group could then claim complete control, though the Bolshe-
viks were the most active driving force. It was also thought
advisable that the workers directly from the shops and
factories be drawn into the administration of the strike.
It was then that the idea of a delegated body of workers
representing all ‘striking esifabliishments was formulated.
Between October 23 and 26 about forty delegates were
chosen who assembled in the Technological Institute and
constituted themselves the Petersburg Soviet of Workers’
Deputies. The basis of representation was one deputy to
every 500 workers. The Soviet elected an Executive Com-
mittee upon which the revolutionary political parties were
represented.

‘The first meeting of the Soviet issued a manifesto in
which it called upon all workers to stop work and elect
delegates to the Soviet. “The working-class chose the ﬁnal
powerful weapon of the international labor movement-—-the
general strike," the manifesto informed the workers after
reciting the reasons for the strike. It also warned the
workers-tha-t “in the immediate future Russia will witness de-
cisive events that will determine the fate of the workers
for many years. United in our common Soviet we must be
prepared to meet these demands.” Although less than a year
had passed since Bloody Sunday, the workers had learned to
speak a different language than they used in January. under
Gapon. Not only the industrial workers, but clerks, teachers,
engineers and other professionals were represented in the
Soviet. The Soviet became the center of all strike activ-
ities. Although within the framework of -the Czarist regime,
the Soviet became the labor parliament, and the workers
began to look upon it as their class government. It not
only dealt with problems arising within the labor move-
ment and conducted the strike, but it became the spokes-
man of the workers in their relation with the outside world.
Following the Petersburg example, other industrial centers
organized Soviets which took charge of the strike situa-
tion.

When the Czar issued his manifesto on October 30,
the Petersburg Soviet countered with a declaration: “The
workers don't want the knout even though wrapped in a con-
stitution.” The Soviet served notice on the government that
only its complete destruction would satisfy the workers.
The Soviet continued to function when the counter—revolu-
tion raised its head. The defeat of a provoked uprising of
the Kronstadt sailors, the state of siege declared in Poland,
and in many industrial centers, was met by the declaration
-of another strike on November 13. Notwithstanding that
it was only two weeks after the general stoppage, the work-
ers answered the call of the Soviet, and the strike which
lasted seven days forced the government to recall the court-
martial proceedings against -the revolutionary Kronstadt
sailors. _

‘On December 8 the Chairman of the Soviet, Chrustalev-
Nosar was a.rrested. The Soviet continued to carry on
under the leadership of the Presidium of three delegates,

one of whom was Trotzky. It was only after the arrest of

THE XVORKERS MONTHLY

the Chairman, that the Soviet began to consider decisive
action. In a resolution dealing with Nosar’s arrest, the
Soviet declared in favor of continuing and “to prepare for
armed insurrection.” By this time the ,revolution was al-
ready at a low ebb.

The Petersburg workers had gone through two general
strikes within three weeks and the unsuccessful attempt
to establish the 8 hour day by revolutionary means after
the November strike, had further dissipated the energies
of the workers. The decision to prepare for an armed
uprising came too late. Within a week after the Chairman's
arrest, the government considered itself strong enough to
order the arrest of the entire Soviet. The defeat of the
Moscow uprising gave the government courage to take this
step in Petersburg.

The Petersburg Soviet existed ﬁfty days, from October
26 to December 16, and during this time the govern-
ment was forced to allow it to function openly in one of the
public buildings. The «Siovéiet was representative of the
entire laboring population of Petersburg. It consisted of
562 delegates and represented over 200,000 workers. The
delegates came from 147 factories, 34 shops, and 16 trade-
unions. Representatives of the Social-Democrats and So-
cialist-Revolutionists served on the Executive Committee
of the Soviet. The Soviet published an organ——the “Izves-
-tia”—which reported all activities and proceedings of the
Soviet.

The Moscow Uprising.

The Moscow Soviet was led by the Bolsheviks, though the
Men-sheviks and Socialist-Revolutionists were represented
there. Following the third Congress of the Party described
above, the Moscow Bolsheviks developed an energetic cam-
paign for a more resolute policy than was practiced in Peters-
burg. Armed insurrection as a means of the revolutionary
struggle was advocated among the workers and armed units
were formed in different factories under the supervision of
the Bolsheviks. As the counter-revolution was spreading,

the Moscow Soviet called for a political strike on December .

7 “aiming to develop it into an armed uprising.” As the
Moscow garrison was unreliable, a loyal Guard regiment was
sent from Petersburg as a punitive expedition to clear the
city «of rev-olutionists. Troops were «brought from other
cities. The Moscow workers accepted the challenge, and
for ten days they fought like lions an enemy far superior
in numbers, ammunition anditraining. The instructions of
the military commanders to their soldiers were not to
arrest any revolutionists but to kill them on sight. When
a bomb was thrown from some house into a detachment of
soldiers, orders came to ﬁre the house, irrespective of the
fact that there were women and children and others who
may have had no relation to the uprising. One proletarian
section, Presnia, particularly distinguished itself. Barricad-
ing themselves in_ the yards of the Prochorov textile factory
the small armed force held the Guard regimen-t for several
days. ‘When they realized that they would have to give up
ﬁghting, they retreated in orderly fashion and, covered by
the sympathetic workers, were soon outside of the environs
of Moscow.

The military expedition was successful in putting down
-the uprising. Not only the government but the bourgeoisie
breathed freely. The Moscow uprising gave them the great-
est scare. If they had any sympathy for the revolution
prior to the December uprising, they quickly parted with

it, and were grateful to the government for its determined
action in Moscow. And Plekhanov, too, joined the chorus
by declaring that “this (the defeat) was not difficult to
foresee and therefore there should not have been a resort
to arms.” Lenin, on the contrary considered the Moscow
uprising as a highly important achievement of the revolu-
tion. He recalled Marx’ letters to Kugelmann written during
the French Commune in which the latter gloriﬁed the “storm-
ing of the heavens” by the Paris workers.

The Lessons of 1905.

If the Russian workers were born as a revolutionary
class in Petersburg, it was in Moscow that they came of
age. The Russian Revolution began after Bloody Sunday:
it reached its highest form during the December uprising
in Moscow. During 1905 the Russian working-class had
run the whole gamut of revolutionary action. The
Mensheviks considered the defeat of the 1905 Revolution
as irreparable. They counselled new methods, peaceful and
democratic, to a.void sacriﬁces in the future. They proposed

the liquidation of the underground niovement and favored
coalition with the bourgeoisie which was going to function
within the framework of the October constitution. The
Bolsheviks on the other hand were not down-hearted. They
counted the losses during the coun-ter-revolution. They saw
numerous mistakes which were made, but they realised that
during the revolution, during the “storming of the heavens,”
the Russian workers became conscious as a revolutionary
class which was destined to assert its revolutionary will in
Russia. While the Mensheviks were engaged in funeral
rites over the revolution, the Bolsheviks maintained that
Czarism won only a Phyrric victory; that the revolution
only retreated to reorganize its broken lines and to prepare
itself for new action when the opportune moment arrived.
Instead of calling off the struggle, as the Mensheviks pro-
posed, the Bolsheviks threw into the teeth of the govern-
ment the deﬁant declaration that the revolution had only
begun, and that it would continue until every vestige of
autocracy and capitalism was destroyed. The Bolsheviks
put themselves at the head of all those elements of the

60

working-class who had faith in the living forces of the
revolution, notwithstanding the defeats and even temporary
demoralization.

During the years of reaction which foll-owed (1906-
1917), the Bolsheviks were studying every phase of the
revolutionary occurences of 1905. All the major policies
and tactics which were utilized during the stormy days of
1917, were in the main based on the experiences of 1905.

The old revolutionary Plekhanov formula stated by him
ten years before 1905 that “the Russian Revolution will
win as a workers’ revolution or it will not win at all," was
improved by the Bolshevik amendment, including the peas-
ants as a factor in the Revolution. The tremendous revo-
lutionary effect of the peasant uprisings did not contribute
as much as they might have to the 1905 revolution because
they were isolated and apart from the occurrences in the
cities. The Bolsheviks saw the need for a link between
the two basic forces of the revolution—the exploited work-
ers and peasants, if the revolution was to be victorious.

The slogan “All Power to the Soviets” raised by the
Bolsheviks immediately after the March, 1917, revolution,
was the natural result of the experiences with the Soviets
which came into being during the general strike- of 1905.

The betrayal of the 1905 revolution by the liberal bour-
geoisie taught the Russian workers the lesson to share the
revolution only with the peasants——their natural allies. Even
Kautsky, when he was still a Marxist, wrote in “The Road
t-o Power” in 1909—a work inspired by the 1905 revolution,
in favor of the Bolshevik attitude towards the bourgeoisie.

THE VVORKERS MONTHLY

He was sure that coalition with the bourgeoisie “can only
compromise a proletarian party and confuse and split the
working-class.” Kautsky, who then still knew his Marx and
Engels, referred to the authority of the founders of scientiﬁc
socialism to prove his contention. “However willing Marx
and Engels were to utilize -the differences between capitalist
parties towards the furtherance of proletarian purposes, and
however they were opposed to the expression ‘reactionary
mass’ they hav-e, nevertheless, coined the phrase ‘dictator-
ship of the proletariat’ which Engels defended shortly be-
fore his death in 1891, as expressing the fact that only through
a purely proletarian political domination can the working-
class exercise its political power.” (Quoted from A. M.
Simon’s translation of “The Road to Power.” In his trans-
lation Simons rendered the word ‘Diktatur’ into ‘dictation’
instead of ‘dictatorship.’ A. T.).

The attitude toward democracy which Plekhanov formu-
lated ye-t in 1902 and which we quoted above, the Bolsheviks
carried out in toto. Following Plekhanov’s advice, they
sent the Constituent Assembly, which included Plekhanov’s
followers, home “because the election proved unfavorable”
to the interests of the revolution, and as Plekhanov said:
“Sa1us revolutiae suprema lex.”

The armed attempt to seize power on November 7,
1917, proved successful, because the Bolsheviks had the
armed uprising of December, 1905, as an example.

The revolution of 1905 made the victorious revolution of
1917 possible, for as Lenin said: “1905 was the general
rehearsal for 1917.”

Wall Street’s Congress Convenes
By J. Louis Engdahl

-rONG~RESS assembles again this month—convincing spec-

tacle of the complete bankruptcy of even the forms of
capitalist parliamentarism in this country. Senators and
representatives are returning to Washington, D. C., with a
few making the journey for the ﬁrst time, not because any
great issue impends, even for the proﬁt class, but because
the United States constitution, adopted September 17, 1787,
more.than a century and a quarter ago, declared:

“The congress shall assemble at least once in every
year, and such meeting shall be on the ﬁrst Monday in De-
cember,.unless they shall by law appoint a diﬁerent day.”

The day has never‘been changed. The halo of superla-
tive reverence thrown about the two sacred documents-
the declarati-on of independence and the const'itution—for-
bids that. American “democracy” is supposed to stand out
unrivaled “for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,”
among all the forms that the capitalist dictatorship takes
anywhere. No ruling class anywhere seeks so assiduously
to inculcate this idea, “that all men are created equal,” in
the minds of the mas=ses as does the American brand of
proﬁt takers. And no master class has been so successful
in saturating the mind of a subject class with this ideology
that governments derive “their just power from the consent
of the governed,” as the big business interests that guide the

governing power of the United States—today’s richest im-
periali-st nation.
Worship of “Democracy."

America so worships its “democracy” that few, except
revolutionaries, ever rise to question it. It is accepted by
the millions, mentally poisoned by capitalist class propa-
ganda, who voted so overwhelmingly last year for continu-
ing Cal Coolidge in the White House. There has been only
scattered resentment, here and there, especially in some hard-
hit farming communities, that this congress has not been
called into session until thirteen months after its election.
For such is the belief, deep rooted and well-nigh universal,
in the United States, that congress c-an and will exercise a.
remedial inﬂuence on the side of the oppressed, that even
radical elements look to it hopefully in their despair. The
socialists, in the Albany trial for the ousting of their
legislators from the New York state legislature, announced
their preference for the American as against the Soviet form
of government.

It is this fact, that American capitalism stands un-
challenged by any great organized power of workers and
farmers, that made it possible for President ‘Coolidge to an-
nounce last year that there would be no special session of
congress just elected, that it would not convene until “the

DECEMBER, 1925

first Monday in December, 1925.” This is an indication of

‘the growing power of the executive department of the gov-

ernment at the expense of its legislative wing.

To be sure there was a hangover session of the old
congress, that met in the December after the November in
which the present congress was elected. It lived until the
president was inaugurated last March 4; a date that does
come in for some discussion. March weather isn’t good for
the visiting hosts of politicians and their friends in Wash-
ington, so sage discussions are carried on for a ch-ange to a
balmier month. Washington business men, notably hotel
proprietors, will succeed in this demand in time.

While Other Governments Fall.

While this congress, therefore, has been sitting around
for more than a year, ready to windjam on any subject al-
lowed, a whole epoch has swept past in European politics.
Great Britain has gone all the way from labor party rule
under MacD-onald to Baldwin's tory government; in France,
the Herriot government that recognized the Union of Soviet
Republics, is displaced by succeeding governments until an-
other Painleve cabinet comes to juggle frantically with the
falling franc and growing colonial wars;
many the “socialist” Ebert is followed as president by the
militarist and monarchist, Von Hindenburg. This has been
a year of swing from a sh-ort-lived era of democratic paci-
flsm to a period of bold reaction. This year has seen gov-
ernments in Europe come and go, new elections held or de-
manded, while in Germany tod-ay new clamors arise for the
dissolution of the reichstag, to be followed by a new appeal
to “the people,” on the issue of Germany’s acceptance of
the Locarno “security pact.”

Congress in the United States is not permitted the en-
joyment of this participation in government. Under the
dollar slogan o=f “less g-overnment in business, and more
business in government,” it is told that the less it meets to
discuss the day's issues, the better. This while the disciple
of big business, Charles G. Dawes, vice-president, as head
of the senate, tours the country in the demand that the
talking rights of senators be curtailed. Dawes demands le-ss
talk and more eﬁiciency in doing the bidding of business.
In the mind of the Chicago banker that is the prime issue to
come before the senate.

The Third Wheel of the Chariot.

It is n-ot because there are no vital problems for the
American capitalist class to solve that no special sessions of
congress are called. It is rather because congress has ceased
-to function as a vital part of the capitalist state. It is an
almost useless third wheel on capitalism’s chariot. Big busi-
ness puts its chief reliance, not on the legislative branch of
the government, but on the executive -and the judicial branch-
es. It is safely entrenched with the strike-breaker, Coolidge,
as president, and William Howard Taft, the arch-relactioir
ary, as chief justice of the United States supreme court,
dominating the whole American judicial system. The gov-
ernment <by ‘c.hecks and balances” has resulted in a b-al-
ance being struck between court room and executive man-
sion, with congress effectively checkmated.

Even a cursory analysis of the theory of government
by “checks and balances,” with the gradual evolution in its
w-orkings, must convince growing masses of workers and
poor farmers that they live under a cleverly constituted

while in Ger-,

61

tyranny. In spite of all the ﬁne phrases of both the declar-
ation of independence and the constitution, the so-called
“fathers” of America had a deep-rooted distrust of “the
people.” Every possible measure to curb the popular Will
was wheeled into action and many of these continue to the
present day, some of them with improvements.

It is not an -accident that the present congress gathers
thirteen months after its election. All this was carefully
provided for back in the eighteenth century. Dollar states-
men, through the passage of time, must be allowed to for-
get promises to the multitudes made during the heat and
fervor of the election campaigns. N-o echoes -of popular ap-
plause for radical utterances must be allowed to enter the
parliamentary hall. There must even be time for dickerings
with a Robert M. LaFollette, Jr., chosen to his father's
senate seat, so that no stone may be left unturned to
ease his way into the regular republican ranks.

But even a congress so tempered against the slightest
inﬂuence of the multitudes is not considered safe. When
the British house of commons passes a law, it goes on the
statute books. But the acts of the United States congress,
after passage by both houses, must be sent from Capitol
Hill to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where stands
the White House, for the approval or veto of the president.
Coolidge has often used this check upon congress. To be
sure, congress has several times come back and wiped out
the presidential veto, with the required number of votes, but
this is usually diﬂicult. The president thus becomes a pow-
erful legislative factor in spite of the fact that he is only
supposed to be an executive officer of the government. On
the other hand, if the president is not to the liking of con-
gress, it can refuse to enact his recommendations into law,
another balance and check. But even at'ter both the presi-
dent and congress have finally managed to agree on some
bit of legislation, there stands the judiciary with the power
t-o declare it “unconstitutional.” Thus congress may pass
legislation in response to, or as a sop to the labor constitu-
encies of its members, knowing full well that it will be out-
lawed by the courts. Two recent notable instances are found
in the fate that has been meted out to the women’s eight-
hour law and the anti-child labor amendment. The U. S.
supreme court has developed into a most excellent check on
congress; in fact, with its majority vote of ﬁve to four, one
member may assume a dictatorial power exercised by no
other individual in any capitalist government anywhere. It
was, therefore, quite necessary that a man of the reacti-onary
type of Taft, who had been defeated overwhelmingly for
the presidency in 1912, should be elevated to the high posi-
tion of head’ justice of the exploiters’ most important assem-
bly. No Mussolini, seeking to entrench his fascist power,
could desire a class government more suited to his purposes.
It has not mattered, whether democrats or republicans were
in oﬂice, the process of strengthening the grip of the power-
ful few upon the government has proceeded rapidly.

The Dictatorship of Capitalism.

Workers and farmers in America, in spite of intensive
“Americanism” campaigns are beginning to realize that they
are confronted with a class government, that they can ex-
pect no qu-arter from this capitalist dictatorship. As that
realization grows, the sham of “democracy" must fall away.
The viewpoint of Coolidge is openly stated to be, and it
will be his position during the sessions of this congress,

62

that he is out for the interests of big business and he doesn’t
care who knows it. It is certain that the wealth producers
will not -be compelled to strain their eyesight in the days
ahead to.see that Coolidge is the president of the wealth
takers. Coolidge, as the nation's chief executive, in whom
an increasing degree of power is being lodged, feels the
responsibility of administering that power on behalf of his
big-business backing, and he is not backward, and will con-
tinue to be less backward about saying so. One witty
paragrapher was not far wrong when he wrote that Coolidge
is merely submitting a message to congress to give the sena-
tors and representative-s something to talk about.

Congress may protest, feebly or loudly. But it will do
little good. Coolidge, as president, has little responsibility
to congress. He submits his message to it. The writing
of that message is now receiving m-ore attention in the
proﬁt press than all the goings and comings of all the sena-
tors and represent-atives. Coolidge speaks‘ for the republi-
can administration.

If congress doesn’t like what Coolidge does, it cannot
overthrow his cabinet, which is responsible only t-o Coolidge.
No Coolidge cabinet member will go before congress to
account for his stewardship. If congress wants information
regarding the internal affairs of any departm-ent, then Coo-
lidge’s cabinet member can refuse to give this information,

‘charging it would be “against the welfare of the govern-

ment.” Through the use of the espionage act, Postmaster-
General Burleson, in the Wilson cabinet, bea-t down all dis-
senting opinion on the war, and congress looked on helpless,
if it did not applaud. «Caillaux lost his j-ob as ﬁn-ance min-
ister of France when he was unable to negotiate the proper
agreement for the payment of debts owing to the United
States. But congress may override Coolidge’s veto repeat-
edly, or bring the gravest charges against his cabinet mem-
bers, as in the case of the Teapot Dome oil scandal, but
the Coolidge republican administration goes on just the same.
A Fall, a Denby, or a Daugherty may be dropped overboard,
to lighten the load of public displeasure and make the “dear
people” believe that something has been accomplished, but
it is not written in the law of the land that even this con-
cession is necessary.

Promote Unity for Wall Street.

Coolidge is evidently trying to promote unity in the re-
publican party, in order to avoid some of the disastrous cal-
amities that befell -some of his recommendations in the last
congress. Even entrenched power dislikes being assailed.
Coolidge, therefore, is having numerous conferences. He has
talked with Nicholas Longworth, from Cincinnati, son-in-law
of the late President Roosevelt, -but a republican politician
par excellence in his own right. He is scheduled to be
speaker of the house when it is organized. Coolidge also
confers frequently with the obstreperous Senator Borah, of
Idaho, who typifies another anomaly in the national poli-
tical headquarters of the capitalist state.

Senator Borah is head of the powerful foreign relations
committee of the senate, and as such he is heartily in favor
of the recognition of the Soviet Union. The republican admin-
istration from the days of Harding and through the Coolidge
regime has been oﬁicially through its two secretaries of state,
Hughes and Kellogg, bitterly opposed. It is claimed that
Coolidge, in order to win support of some republican indus-

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

trialists, who ﬁnd a mouthpiece in Borah, Raymond Robbins,
and men of their type, pledged himself to send a mission to
Soviet Russia if elected. Whether the visit of Governor
Goodrich, of Indiana, and the recent tour of investigation of
Russian conditions by Colonel William N. Haskell, U. S, A.,
a right hand man of Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce,
have anything to do with carrying out this pledge, the future
will reveal. Soviet trade with the United States is rapidly
increasing and the question of recognition will be an issue be-
fore the next congress. It will come up in a manner much
different than in the last congress, where the late Samuel
Gompers, as head of the American Federation of Labor, and
with energetic support from a selected assortment of rene-
gade “socialists,” made up the chief opposition in hearings
before Borah’s committee. The A. F. of L. oﬂicialdom has
not changed in its hostility, but Green will not be able to
make it effective, as Gompers succeeded in doing t-o some
extent. . ’

The Coolidge-Borah differences on Soviet recognition,
instead of widening the breach between the two, can easily
help bring them together. It is the basis for trading. Borah
is against the world court, an extremist in demanding pay-

'ment of the war debts, and he must get concessions for

the western farmers, in order to maintain a face before his
constituents and get their votes. Above all, Borah is a “poli-
tician,” which means that he is willing to concede on some-
thing he doesn’t want, to get something he desires very

All Eyes on 1926.

Successful political trades are now very important since
the 1926 congressional elections are rapidly approaching and
the harvest of votes must again be gathered in. In fact,
it has been repeatedly pointed out that the presidential mes-
sage to congress, now being written, has its eye not so much
on the senate and house of representatives, but on next
November’s ballot boxes. In the words of an authoritative
Washington correspondent, the message will be the basis on
which ‘_‘the administration will ask for a vote of conﬁdence in
the congressional election next year.”

Equally the president’s message, therefore, and every
act of this congress becomes the basis for an attack by
class conscious workers and farmers in their war against
this Wall Street government that schemes so carefully,
through the Coolidge administration, to maintain itself in
power.

Fighting the Coal Miners.

It was no accident that the above correspondent,’ when .

be listed nine principal points to be covered by the Coolidge
message, put “The creation of machinery for dealing with
strikes of coal miners,” as the ninth and last. It is a fair
indication of the degree of contempt with which the ruling
class looks upon the workers. There will be little attempt
in this congress to placate the workers; not much additional
defense is felt to be necessary by the capitalists against
the workers. To be sure, legislation may be offered in an
effort to outlaw strikes of coal miners. But the indications
are that Secretary of Labor Davis, the Pittsburgh multi-mil-
lionaire banker and mine owner, will, content himself with
urging legi-slation against “foreign-born workers" who make
up seven-tenths of the mine workers and six-tenths of the

DE(‘.EMBER,1925

steel workers, the two basic industries in which Pittsburgh
is most interested. Peace-time sedition legislation will no
doubt also be urged by the same source against the revolu-
tionary press, especially those publications appearing in
foreign languages. It is only at this point that the A. F. of
L. clashes vitally with the capitalist state; the recent At-
lantic City convention declaring that the governmental at-
tacks on the foreign-born was an eﬂort to crush the labor
unions. Thanks to the left wing, organized labor is learn-
ing this important lesson.

Any additional legislation against the anthracite strikers
is really not necessary. There is enough now for all pur-
poses. Coolidge's “Hands Off!" policy is dictated by the
big capitalists, chief among them being John Hays Ham-
mond, who want to handle the situation themselves, at least
for the time being. The political office boy in the White
House will be called on when needed.

Coolidge did raise a whimper against wage cuts in the
textile industry of his native New England, where his cam-
paign manager, the mill baron, Butler, is the dominating
power. Coolidge thought it bad politics. But Butler thought
it good business. So one cut .follows another. There is no
indication that “Cautious Cal” will mention this subject in
his forthcoming message, nor the slightest «symptom that
congress will concern itself with this matter, although it is
the outstanding problem confronting labor today.

Acquiesce in Greater Mergers.

This congress may become historic in that no voice will .

be raised against the era of greater mergers, recording the
bitter cry of a middle class facing gradual extermination.
Coolidge rule has approved consolidations in the packing and
other industries, and congress will favor the merging of all
railroads into a few larg-e systems. This proposition catches
the well-to-do farmers with the promise that consolidations
will result in lower rates. Old-party “progressive” politicians,
like Sen. Cummins, of Iowa, chairman of the senate interstate
commerce commission, who formerly appeared as militant bat-
tlers against monopoly, are now reconciled to what the de-
velopment of capitalism offers them. LaFollette, Jr., is said
to have deserted his father’-s demand for government own-
ership. The only voice against the trusts that can be heard
comes from those trade union oﬂicials who refuse to indus-
trialize their organizations through amalgamation and thus
develop strength to overcome new economic conditions, think-
ing instead to force employers into line through threats of
congressional “investigations.” The bakery, textile and tele-
phone workers, among others, appeared in this pitiful role
at the last A. F. of L. convention.

Thus the workers will be caught between the scissors
of growing monopolies on the one hand, ﬁnancially and
organizationally able to carry on the most bitter warfare
against their workers, and on the other the eager capital-
ist state, straining at the leash in its readiness to do the
bidding of the exploiters in the war on labor.

Something for the Public.

With congress as its forum, the Coolidge crowd will
do its -best to propagandize the public into believing that
the administration's “economy measures,” resulting in re-
duced taxation, will benefit everybody. It will be good “cam-
paign stuff." Reduction of taxation has always been one
of the prize lines of the old-party orator. Instead of the

stump, Coolidge now heralds it through the radio. The
Workers Communist Party, however, opens the eyes of
labor to the fact that this is all camouﬂage for shifting
the tax burden more effectively and completely from the
owning class to the working class.

While capitalist rule in Washington feels no effort nec-
essary to appease the workers in industry, the same cannot
be said of the farmers. The plundered irrigation farmers
of the far west are up in arms, it being declared that the
reclamation policy of Secretary of Agriculture J ardine is bring-
ing ﬁnancial ruin on thousands of hard-pressed -settlers. The
grain ‘farmers of the near northwest never cease in their
complaints against the board of trade bandits in the big
cities; while -the cotton growers of the south now join in
with the charge that government oﬂicials have actually aid-
ed the cotton speculators, through government reports on
the cotton crop. to plunder them to the extent of a quar-
ter of a million dollars. Add to this the reports coming
from Georgia that 1,000,000 farmers there are facing s-tarva-
tion as the result of crop failures, and it is easy to under-
stand why the administration at‘Washington concerns itself
a little with the agricultural situation. But the “farm relief”
measures offered tend to be the time-worn propositions that
aid the small bankers and little business men in the farming
communities, and not the lowest strata of the farm popula-
tion that carries the heavy burden of suffering. Such meas-
ures as are offered, will be to fool the farmers and not to
help them.

Nobody to Make the Fight.

No actual fight will be made for the workers and poor
farmers in this congress because there is no one there to
do the ﬁghting. Representative Victor L. Berger, the Mil-
waukee “socialist” will be there, to be sure. But he will
spend his time telling his fellow republicans and democrats
that he has absolutely nothing in common with the Com-
munists. Florello H. LaGuardia, the New York city repub-
lican, elected on the “socialist” ticket under the LaFollette
banner, will -spend his time arguing that he is not a “social-
ist.” Three farm-er-laborites, O. J. Kval, William L. Cares
and Knud Wofald, all in the house of representatives, come
from Minnesota, where the farmer-labor oflicialdom -seeks
continually to divorce the movement from all class-struggle
actions. It follow-ed LaFollette. It may do worse. All the
others are democrats and republicans. The LaFo1lette bloc
has drifted back 'into the republican camp, while the presence
of any other “insurgents” of days gone by, passes unnoticed.

The senate has one farmer-laborite, Dr. Hendrik Ship-
sted, the St. Paul dentist. The former Non-partisan League
farmer, Lynn J. Frazier, passes as a republican from North
Dakota. So will LaFollette, Jr., and others who flirted with
the third party movement last year.

One Inust not forg-et the forlorn-looking lobbyists of
the American Federation of Labor, hovering about the cloak
rooms for a word or two with this senator or that representa-
tive. In this connection one finds an item in the annual re-
port of the A. F. of L. as follows:

"Legislative expenses, including -salaries and traveling
expenses of three legislative committeemen: W. C. Roberts,
Edward F. McGrady and Edgar Wallace, $14,986.35.”

Money thrown away. “Bill" Roberts, the chief lobbyist,
was formerly “labor editor" of Hearst's Chicago Herald-
Examiner until, during the newspaper strike of 1912, that

64

started in the Hearst plant, this Roberts was ruled oﬁ the
floor of the Chicago Federation of Labor. That is Gompers’
non-partisan political action at work. A pitiful picture! In
this congress, without Gompers, more so than ever.

The democr-ats will oppose the republicans only for the
sake of producing 1926 campaign material. Thus the repub-

~licans plan to cut taxes $350,000,000.00 while the democrats

propose to make the cut a clean half billion. The demo-
crats are in the position of being on the outside looking
in, thus being able to promise almost anything to ‘get in.
Once in, their promises will vanish into air. On the question

-of the world court and other measures, Coolidge will get

as much support from the democrats as from the republi-
cans, if not more.

The Calm Before the Storm.

Aside from a few flurriés, therefore, everything will be
calm in this session of congress; almost as the recent annual
convention of the American Federation of Labor on Steeple-
chase Pier, Atlantic City.‘ The class cry of America's op-
pressed will not be heard, through labor’s class spokesmen,
in this st-agnating appendix of Wall Street’s highly effec-
tive capitalist -state. But the events that there transpire
must speed the crystallization of sentimentgfor independent
class political action through a Labor Party.

While this congress is in’ session the working class
attack inust be carried on from the outside, in the trade
unions, through the farmers’ organizations, Wherever the
exploited can be brought t.ogether.

THE VVORKERS MONTHLY

There are growing indications that labor is rallying for
new efforts. Coolidge confessed this in his attempt at “liber-
alism” in his address to the American Legion at Omaha,
Nebr., and in his recent effusion on the freedom of the
press. Capitalist politicians only talk that way when they
see clouds on the political horizon. Oklahoma has had a
farmer-labor conference. Arkansas and Texas are making
plans for similar gatherings. William Bouck, the militant
executive of the Western Progressive Farmers, is planning
a tour through Montana, at the special request -of the work-
ers and farmers of this state, struggling to build their own
independent political power. Even the oflicialdom of the
A. F. of L., blind to most industrial and political phenomena,
admits the -growing possibility of the Labor Par-ty. This
class sentiment will ﬁnd an expression in attacks even on
this congress. I _

The day will also come when labor’s class representa-
tives will invade congress, in increasing numbers," to use it as
an effective forum to exp-la.in to the laboring‘ multitudes the
real nature of this capitalist state, how great wealth uses
it as an instrument of oppression, and why it must be swept
away to make room for the Soviet state of the workers and
farmers, so that those who do the work of the World can
make real progress along the highway leading to"their com-
plete emancipation. ’

But that will be Communism, against which capitalism
musters all its powers ofresistance.

It will be fairly calm in congress this session. But it will
be the calm before the storm; the storm of growing class
-struggles.

These developments in Great Britain are the more sig-
niﬁcant because the Communist Party of that country consti-
tutes but an extremely small minority within this left wing

There is additional signiﬁcance attached to the rise of
the movement for world trade union unity in Great Britain
when we remember that its cardinal object is the waging
of a relentless struggle against wo-rld imperialism and im-
perialist war.

Imperialism Creates Need for World Unity of Workers.

In the Uni-ted States the American Federation of Labor
testiﬁes to the growing strength of American imperialism-
the deadly rival of the British brand.

DECEMBER. 1925

American imperialism developed later than the imper-
ialism of Great Britain, but its paralyzing effect on the

labor movement is just as apparent as was that of British’

imperialism in 1915, when Lenin wrote the sentences quoted
at the beginning of this article.

Imperialism creates the necessity for world trade union.

unity. It sets in motion also the forces which oppose it.
Nowhere in the capitalist world are these forces more pow-
erful than in the United States. Indeed, it is no exaggera-
tion to say that the most merciless enemy of world trade
union unity is the bureaucracy of the American Federation
of Labor.

At the Atlantic City convention there occurred an event
of historic importance to the American working class. Just
as the publication of the British Trade Union Report on
Russia marked the sweep of the
tremendous inﬂuence of the
Russian revolution into the
British labor movement, so did
the visit of Purcell, as fraternal
delegate from the British Trade
Union Congress to the’ A. F. of
L. convention, mark the begin-
ning of a new period in Ameri-
can labor history. Chairman of
the International Federation of
Trade Unions with its 20,000,000
members, vice-chairman of the
General Council of the British
Trades Union Congress, chair-
man of the British trade union
delegation to Soviet Russia,
member of —the House of Com-
mons, Purcell is the most in-
ﬁuential ﬁgure that ever ap-
peared as a fraternal delegate
of the A. F. of L.

Purcell Pleads World Union
Unity, Russian Recognition.

Purcell appeared as an ad-
vocate of world trade union
unity, an enemy of imperialism
and he "urged recognition of A-
Soviet Russia..

It is impossible to quote extensively from his speech
in an article of this length, and some outstanding sentences

will have to serve to show that he challenged the entire
attitude of the A. F. of L. bureaucracy:

“The call I want to make . . . is a call for the
unity of the world's workers—for the world brother-
hood of all those who toil. I make no apoloy for
making that call. I consider it my highest duty and
finest privilege at this great convention of American
workers . . . In London, Berlin, Moscow and Vienna

I have watched the serried ranks of the hosts
Of labor go marching past . . . a vast, tremendous,
vital force, a gigantic Confraternity of Labor . . . the

tional. . . . I TELL YOU THAT THE POLICY OF

B. Swales, (left) Chairman of the British Trade Union
Congress, and Tomsky, head of the Central Committee of
the Russian Trade Unions.

ISOLATION IS A MISTAKEN ONE . . . THE MON-

ROEDOCTRINE NO LONGER HOLDS GOOD FOR

YOUR GOVERNMENT—AS ITS IMPERIAL POL-

ICY IN THE PHILIPPINES, IN CHINA AND ELSE-

WHERE DEMONSTRATES—AND NO LONGER

HOLDS GOOD FOR YOUR CAPITALISTS. IT

CAN NO LONGER HOLD GOOD FOR YOU!”

Purcell will probably never know the depth of the
black hatred he aroused by these words in the hearts of the
labor agents of American imperialism. To them, accustomed
to disguise their servility to Wall Street and its robber policy
by voicing sympathy for the colonial workers while selling
the unions of these colonials to Wall Street, as in Mexico,
Purcell immediately became “an agent of Moscow,” the most
appr-obrious term they can hurl at an opponent.

But worse was to come.
Purcell continued:

“I have been to Russia.
There I have seen the work-
ers assuming vast r_espon-
sibilities and duties . . . I

am proud of the genius for
organization and the essen-
tial grip of things which
my class in Russia has dis-
played The Russian

ple . . . strong, patient,
hard-working, clever

ERS OF AMERICA HAVE

FROM NOW ON THE OR-
GANIZED WORKERS OF
AMERICA WILL ESTAB-
LISH THE CLOSEST FRA-
TERNAL RELATIONS
WITH THE WORKERS OF
RUSSIA . . .”

Green Insults Delegate of
British Labor.

Purcell’s eloquent plea for
world trade union unity and
fraternal relations with the Russian workers was answered
by a re-aﬂirmation by the convention of the “Monroe Doctrine
of American Labor” ﬁrst endorsed at El Paso. A thinly
veiled insult to Purcell was conveyed in the denunciation of
“aggression by propaganda.” This “Monroe Doctrine of
American Labor,” if the words of the resolution are to be
taken at their face value, is just another weapon in the
arsenal of American imperialism:

“Neither the Red International of Autocratlc
Moscow nor any other international may in complac-
ency ignore this deﬁnition of American labor policy.”
The weapon -is to be wielded against the slaves of

\Vall Street everywhere.

of Russia, the Atlantic City convention replied with a reso-

lution in which its enmity to the ﬁrst workers’ and peasants’
government was set forth as follows:

“The American Federation of Labor declares its

hostility not merely in a defensive manner, but in

a vital and aggressive manner." ‘

Says Losovsky in his pamphlet
Union Movement:”

“The World's Trade

“ . . . inﬂuence of the bourgeois state, has in
every country, its peculiarities. Each country has
its method for the corruption of the working class,
and the bourgeoisie of each country uses these meth-
ods_ very successfully for its own interests. But the
opportunity itself of having such an inﬂuence on the
working class, proves that the bourgeoisie has a
foothold within the working class . . . Thus, the
power of the bourgeoisie is contained not only in
its army, police, courts, but also in its ability to
inﬂuence and control a section of the working class,
and to undermine the labor organizations which
should conduct a struggle aainst it. FOR IF THE
WORLD'S 50,000,000 MASS MEMBERSHIP OF THE
TRADE UNIONS WAS A REALLY UNITED ARMY,
THE BOURGEOISIE WOULD LONG AGO HAVE
BEEN SMASHED TO PIECES.”

Workers’ Unity Menaces Slave-Holders.

The progress of world trade union unity menaces in par-
ticular those nations which hold in bondage great numbers
of colonial slaves, because the very essence of world trade
union unity is a welding of the colonial labor movements
into an indivisible whole with the labor movements of the
imperialist nations. 0

The trade unions must either ﬁght imperialism as a
world system, destroy its inﬂuence over the leadership and
upper strata, free the proletarian mas-ses from this deaden-
ing weight, or see themselves divided, the upper sections
turned into fascist militia and the organizations of the
lower ranks completely crushed. V

The characteristics of such upholders of imperialist dom-
ination as Green, Woll, Lewis and company are their loyalty
to their capitali-st government and hostility to any uniﬁca-
tion of the working class on a ﬁghting basis in the colonial
regions and other sections penetrated by their imperialist
masters.

Betrayers of Labor Feted.

The effusive endorsement and lavish courtesies extended
to the Dawes’ plan labor oﬂicials of the German trade unions
are a case in point, and are in sharp contrast to the cold
shoulder given Purcell. These betrayers of the German work-
ers have been taken on personally conducted tours through-
out the United States “to inspect American industry” while
Purcell, who is speaking to American workers on world
trade union unity, is left severely alone to find his way about
as best he can. His only oﬂicial meeting was that at the
Atlantic City convention.

Says Losovsky:

“In America there is a whole system invented

by the bourgeoisie for the corruption of labor lead-

ers, and for crushing the class struggle and diverting

it into another channel."

THE \VORKERS MONTHLY

I have heard American trade unionists dismiss this state-
ment with the remark that “all these Russians are prej-
udiced.” But what remains of this criticism after Atlantic
City, where world trade union unity was spat upon and ground
into the ﬁlthy dust of the convention ﬂoor under the feet of
labor officials whose four and five ﬁgure salaries are them-
selves proof that at least one method exists “for the corrup-
tion of labor leaders”? (President Green draws $12,000 per
year as “wages” alone.).

Trade Unions Must Choose—lmper-ialists or Workers.

The cold fact of the relationship of forces in the world
today is that every trade union movement must choose
whom it will serve——imperialism or the working class. To
be passively or actively against world trade union unity is
to be against -the working class. The oﬂicialdom of the
American Federation of Labor is, as we have seen, militant
in its opposition.

Does the A. F. of L. support the plunder schemes of
American imperialism with the same militancy?

It does.

To conduct imperialist adventure eﬂiciently a ruling
class needs the closest kind of organizationat home-—-capital
must be concentrated, control centralized and at least a sec-
tion of the labor movement brought into active support of
this scheme of things.

America is the land of concentration and centralization,
but the rapid extension of investments in Europe, China and
La-tin-America makes new demands on the domestic ap-
paratus.

La-bor Bureaucracy Shares Slave Proﬁts.

The A. F. of L. bureaucracy is obliging. It shares the
proﬁts.

The Atlantic City convention endorsed the plan of
Herbert Hoover, the petted darling of American imperial-
ism’s organization corps, for the calling of a national con-
ference of “farm organizations, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS
AND TRADE UNIONS, to consider the elimination of diffi-
culties PREVENTING THE CONSTRUCTIVE ORGANIZA-
TION OF INDUSTRY.’’ (Emphasis mine——W. F. D.)

A dispatch in the Chicago Daily News of October 16 says:

“Secretary Hoover, who ﬁnds constructive efforts
in this direction impeded by legislation, judicial rul-
ings and interpretation, is. understood to view with
favor this new policy of the labor movement, which
is being initiated by Matthew Woll, Chicago, vice-
president of the federation. Mr. Woll was the initia-
tor of the movement for constructive organization of
industry through co-operation of employer and em-
ploye promulgated at Portland two years ago by the
federation."

The language of the resolution is of the frankest kind
and its meaning therefore subject to no misrepresentation.
It declares:

“Sustained progress in industry is possible only
through functional organization of all the various
factors, employers and employes . . . Constructive
activities are hampered by legislation, judicial rul-
ings and interpretation which attempt to limit or
restrict the helpful co-operation between the essen-
tial elements within industry. without this co-opera-

DECEMBER, 1925

tion there can not be the necessary avoidance of
economic waste and full opportunity for industrial
development based on scientiﬁc production plans.
“The. American Federation of Labor therefore
calls, upon congress for the modiﬁcation of existing
legislation tendin to prevent the co-operation be-
tween the essential elements within industry."

The corollary to the above scheme of capitalist; concen-
tration facilitated by the removal of all legislative obstacles,
is the removal of all restrictions for combination for the
purpose of foreign trade.

U. S. Imperialism Holds Whip Hand.

The acquiescence of the A. F. of L. convention appar-
ently removed the last barrier, for in the New York Times
of November 3 we ﬁnd the following editorial comment:

“Secretary Hoover repeats his warning of
three years ago, There is a steadily increasing tend-
'ency among the governments of the world to regu-
late production and fix prices of raw materials of

which they control the output, with results deeply

injurious.. . to us. The case of Enland and
rubber . . . many indispensable articles are similarly
capable of control—jute, sisal, antimony, tungsten,
nickel, tin, quicksilver, asbestos, quinine, iodine,
silk . . . HITHERTO WE HAVE SUFFERED PA-
TIENTLY. BUT THE LAW AGAINST TRADE

COMBINATIONS HAS BEEN SO MODIFIED THAT
WE MAY IF WE WILL TAKE PART IN SUCH
ECONOMIC STRIFE, AND WE HOLD THE DOM-
INANT POSITION WITH REGARD TO OIL, COT-
TON, COPPER-—TO SAY NOTHING OF THAT
PARTICULARLY RAW MATERIAL CAPITAL.”

One cannot be much mistaken as to the meaning of the
above. It is that American imperialism holds the whip
hand and is going, with the enthusiastic assistance of the
subsidized labor aristocracy, to contest for absolute domina-
-tion in every ﬁeld of capitalist endeavor. And in case we are
a little du1l———as dull, for instance, as those who believe in
the ebeneﬁcent promises of American capitalist democracy——
the New York Times’ editorial writer furnishes a very lucid
explanation. He says further:

“M. Loucheur urged upon the League (of na-
tions) the calling of an economic conference . .
when" it convenes we shall have a vital interes,-t.
ITS OUTCOME WILL LARGELY DETERMINE
THE ABILITY OF OUR CREDITORS (sic) TO PAY
. . . TH E QUESTION WILL BE DECIDED
WHETHER . . . THE NATIONS UPON WHICH
THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMERCE DEPENDS
ARE TO BE GOOD OR BAD CUSTOMERS.” (Em-
phasis mine.———W. F. D.)

Nations which have trade union movements committed
to the militant struggle against imperialism in all its forms
and everywhere are very likely to be “bad customers.”

A. F. of L. Supports Capitalists, Wars on Left Wing.

It is here that the close connection between the warfare
on the left wing of the International Federation of Trade

67

Unions, (which is for world trade union unity) on the part
of the A. F. of L. bureaucracy, and the line of American
imperialism, becomes plain as day.

The A. F. of L. is against world trade union unity be-
cause it interferes with the schemes for world domination
by Wall Street and the American government with which
Wall Street is synonymous. This is the real basis for the
repudiation of Purcell at Atlantic City.

Collaboration with capitalism and war on the left wing
at home, unity with the traitors to labor in every country
in which American imperialism operates, support, moral
and ﬁnancial, for the tools of American imperia.lism——French,
German and colonia1——this is the program of the American
Federation of Labor.

Interests of Masses Opposed to Bureaucrats.

But the interests of the great bulk of the American
working class, even of the majority of those organized in
the A. F. of L., are in direct contradiction to such a program.

Most of the work-ers do not as yet realize this contra-
diction of interest, and it is therefore all the more neces-
sary that Communists work with great care and energy so

that the signiﬁcance of Purcell’s visit, the reasons for it’

and the treatment accorded him be not lost but explained
and made the basis for a broad left-wing organization in
the labor strongholds of American imperia1ism——the back-
ward and treacherously-led unions of the American Federa-
tion of Labor.

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

The First Negro Workers’ Congress

By Robert Minor

OR the ﬁrst time in the history of the United States (or
practically for the ﬁrst time), an American NegI‘0 131301‘
convention has been held. Never before, with the exceptlon
of the years just after the Civil War, has there been even
a pretense of a big national congress of Negroes on the basis

of their class character as workers. -

Negro conventions and Negro societies have been many
and frequent, especially since the world war. But always
these “conventions” have belied the real Character Of the
Negro masses. There have been church conventions which
reﬂected of course the blight of organized superstition taught
to the Negro by the white master class. Or there have
been conventions of Negro business men in which all of the
realities of the Negro’s situation in American society Were
ignored in order to give a few Negro small merchants, law-
yers and bankers a chance to pose 111 the attitude of “optim-
ism” of the white Babbit-bourgeoisie. There have been con-
ventions also of “classless” Negro associations, in which the
same small merchant and professional class (representing
no organizations but possessing the railroad fares) took the
lead and also struck unreal poses; and conventions of Negro
teachers suffering under the sorest grievances but fearfully
avoiding all suggestions of the only remedies which exist.
Then there have been the conventions of the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Colored People——an organiza-
tion resembling in its pattern the ancient Abolition society
and breathing the spirit of the white philanthropist in be-
nign collaboration with colored bishops and lawyers, and, of
course, the white Republican politician of the border states
and other parts where Negroes vote and where anti-lynching

speeches can be made.

Class Basis of Race Problem Previously Ignored.

All of these past conventions have belied the real posi-
tion of the Negro masses in American society—have belied
the class character of the Negro masses, have necessarily
ignored the causes of the Negro’s oppression. In one in-
stance a Negro convention made a gesture in the direction of
recognizing the class character of the Negro’s problem; and
strange to say, that was the convention (in 1924) of the most
bourgeois of all of these organizations, the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Colored People. It did make a
demand on the American Federation of Labor for the organ-
ization of Negro labor in the trade unions—which may part-
ly be accounted for by the strained relations between the
white bourgeois politicians and the Negro petty-bourgeoisie
at the time. There was one other instance in which a gesture
was made in this direction——th.e case of the Universal Negro
Improvement Association which in 1920 made a. demand for
the Negro’s rights in the trade unions, but which has since
entirely forgotten the demand under the inﬂuence of a reac-
tionary “Zionism.” With the exception of the African Blood
Brotherhood, which had and still has a splendid “theoretical”

program but which never attained mass inﬂuence, all move»

ments among Negroes have ignored the class basis of the

/

Negro’s problem, or have purposely evaded it, and as a con-
sequence have been sterile or deliberately reactionary.

Subsidized “Negro” Press Attacks Labor Congress.

The-American Negro Labor Congress which met in Chi-
cago the last week of October, was immediately recognized as
a breaker of traditions. It created more excitement in the
so-called Negro press, I believe, than any other Negro con-
vention that ever convened. Instinctively this congress was
recognized as a fundamentally different thing, representing
a rising danger to something or somebody, somehow. Among
the most powerful of what pass for “Negro” newspapers, al-

most all conﬁned their treatment of the affair, before its A

opening, entirely to veiled or open attacks. Anyone who
knows that the lines of control of these most prosperous
“Negro” newspapers lead through the Republican party, and
through Washington and hence indirectly into the ﬁnancial
regions of Manhattan Island, will understand this. The Am-
erican Negro Labor Congress represents objectively and ul-
timately a danger to those who proﬁt by things as they are.
because any movement which really takes the working class
approach to the Negro‘ masses’ problems has found the key
by which those problems can be thrown open to solution.
Hence the “master’s voice” spoke through most of the Ne-
gro newspapers (there were some notable exceptions), warn-
ing the Negro masses against the Congress or at least pub-
lishing as “news” Mr. William Green’s warning without pub-
lishing the answers of the Negro organizers of the congress.

But it is notable that not one of the most virulent enemy
newspapers even attempted to deny the great importance and
substantiality of the congress. Mr. Abbott’s “Chicago De-
fender,” the biggest of the Negro newspapers which push the
white masters’ propaganda among Negro readers, took an at-
titude of complete but cowardly hostility toward the Negro
workers’ congress, but did not even dare to deny that it had
a great mass signiﬁcance. Mr. Roscoe Conkling Simmons’
new paper, the “Chicago World,” which apparently lives on
the lucrative trade of terrorizing Negro sleeping-car porters
for the Pullman Company, published a vicious attack during
the congress, but by the very prominence of the attack and
the admissions in the article, acknowledged that the congress
had wide importance as a mass phenomenon. And other
papers more or less accordingly, although we must remem-
ber that some of the Negro newspapers were honest, sincere
and fair,

What Mass Character?

But what mass character did the congress really have?
The answer to this question is the important thing.

Anyone who regards the matter of the American Negro
masses as one of deep, primary importance, and not as one
of secondary importance—not as a thing to be judged by the
scale of tempests in teapots—will not be ready to say that
this movement is as yet a mass movement. The practically
universal admission of antagonistic newspapers (both the
white capitalist and Negro newspapers) that this congress
was a large mass aﬁair, must not be taken too seriously by

was taken on the night devoted to a discussion of race persecution.

the earnest young men and women who are at the head of
the movement. The fact that its enemies called it a mass
movement shows what a low standard has been set for
“mass” movements among such enemies. This makes a curi-
ously interesting and proﬁtable study.

A look behind the scenes of all Negro movements shows
that they have practically all -been nothing more than periodi-
cal conferences of “prominent persons,” delegated by IlObZ)(1f«'
and present only by virtue of a vague general recognition
and the possession of the price of a railroad ticket. This is
painfully true, and it shows the fatal weakness which has
spelled sterility for previous Negro “movements.” The es-
sential fact was that behind such conferees there was no

organizing of the masses. Bishops would be present because

they were bishops, doctors because they were doctors, law-
yers because they were lawyers, business men because, hav-
ing succeeded in becoming business men, they were assumed
to be the “natural spokesmen” for the Negro masses. No
masses of hard-pressed Negro workers had gone through the
organized process of selecting them. They were not dele-
dates, which means that they were not a product of the pro-
cess of organizing the masses. This was naturally so: doc-
tors, lawyers, bishops and business men do not organize
workers; and the Negro masses are workers.

That method of constituting Negro “conventions” was
the outgrowth of old traditions. And how easily it was
assumed to be the only method was rather humorously
proved at this Negro Labor Congress, which reversed the
method. A Mr. Reed appeared at this congress asking to be
seated. Having realized that some sort of credentials would
be required, he presented a document signed by the governor
of the state of Oklahoma which certiﬁed that he was ap-
pointed as a delegate to the Negro Labor Congress. It was
a perfectly serious document, and strictly in accord with pre-

cedent. It meant that Mr. Reed was a prominent Negro citi-
zen, and according to all tradition this was the sole requisite
entitling him to voice in any Negro convention or congress.
(He was seated as a fraternal delegate.)

Such traditions are clearly traceable to the Negro
church, which for a full century was the only form of or-
ganization existing among Negroes. This trace is found also
in the business proceedings of all previous Negro conven-
tions, which have been mere “preachings” in which a leader,
acting as chairman, ruled everything, decided everything, and.
hardly ever even thought of allowing a vote to be taken on
anything.

Real Organization New Phenomenon Among Negroes.

It must be said that organization, in the true sense of the
word, is a new phenomenon among the Negro masses. And
when we understand this, and when we see the reversal of
the traditions and forms of the past, we get closer to the
answer as to whether there was a mass character to the
American Negro Labor Congress.

A hard-boiled organizer will have to say that there were
only a very few thousand of organized Negro workers be-
hind the delegates who sat in the American Negro Labor Con-
gress. There was only a small handful who directly repre-
sented trade unions, and to anyone who appreciates the es-
sence of this as a Negro labor congress, the matter is highly
important. Undoubtedly, however, the signiﬁcance of this
weakness is mitigated by the fact that many Negro “federal”
labor unions which wanted to send delegates and which were
watching with earnest sympathy its results, were ﬁnally ter-
rorized out of sending their delegates by the threat of the
president of the American Federation of Labor, who implied
that these unions would be deprived of their charters if they
participated. (A considerable number of unions were repre-

sented indirectly through the delegates of “local councils” in
which they participated.)

Anoth-er very serious weakness lay in the complete ab-
sence of representation of Negro farmers.

Must Build on New Foundation.

However, none but the blindest of fools could say that
this Negro Labor ‘Congress has no large signiﬁcance. Whether
the movement has or does not have a mass character is a
question which was not conclusively answered by this conven-
tion, and which will be settled according to whether the young
Negro leaders who have started it will now proceed to utilize
the great beginnings which they have made. Unquestionably
this convention resulted in forming a strong nucleus for a
;mass movement, and a nucleus which already has the begin-

rings of mass connections. The fact that it has succeeded
in drawing together half a hundred young Negro leaders of
(XCeDtiOI13.1 ability—not “prominent persons,” but young
working class men and women with the gift and urge for or-
ganization and a clear goal, and having behind them at least
a framework of mass organization——this fact will be ignored

only by skeptics who know nothing of present day history.

The successful formulation of a clear program, and the
reception of this program by the crowds of Negro workers
who attended the congress, are also matters of much im-
portance. This writer sat through the sessions of the con-
gress from day to day, observing with keenest interest the
development of the program, the uncompromising drive for
what they wanted on the part oi the delegates. the complete
and enthusiastic unanimity of all delegates, ranging from
Negro ofﬁcers of A. F. of L. trade unions to the delegate “rep-
resenting the State of Oklahoma,” and the reverberations of
the program among the un-picked local Negro working-class

audience which attended the mass meeting sessions by many
hundreds. From these observations the writer can say with
complete assurance that the program is not only one which
gives the Negro movement the key to the problem, but that
it is also one which spontaneously and completely captures
the loyalty of the hitherto untouched Negro workers to whom
it is offered.

Dicks and False Race Leaders Fight Conress.

In this respect a severe test had been put upon the con-
vention by the attacks which had been directed against it.
Universally it had been condemned as “red,” as Bolshevik.

The entrance to the hall was crowded every day with about a
score of Mr. Coolidge’s federal dicks. Inﬂuential Negro poli-
ticians (under the direction of their white masters in the Re-
publican party) worked overtime to terrorize the Negro popu-
lation away from the affair, and newspapers with scare head-
lines virtually threatening the arrest of all who attended.
were hawked at the door. Both the delegates and the big

crowds of auditors were psychologized in advance to be sus-
picious and skeptical of any program that might be offered.

But the results proved that it is impossible to hold the
masses of this oppressed people away from the measures
which ring with sincerity and which go to the hard bottom of
their problems. It was enlightening to hear the public re-
ception given to the “ﬁrst-comer” proposal in regard to the
abolition of segregation of Negroes in the “black belt.” It is
a proposal to take out of the hands of landlords the right to
refuse to rent apartments to Negroes or to ﬁx the rental at
a, higher rate for Negro tenants; and this proposal of course
means the taking over under public administration all apart-
ment houses, an interference with the holy rights of prop-
erty of the landlords. The fact that no one can conceive of
any milder proposal for the abolition of the brutal segregation
system, carried the proposal through with a whooping en-
thusiasm and complete unanimity (there being no “natural
leaders” in the shape of Negro real-estate dealers present).
The result of such a proposal is to present in a vivid way the
realization that the liberation of the Negro masses from their
condition of racial suppression (even the matter of residence
segregation) involves a class struggle.

Green's Attack Flat Failure.

The same lesson was learned through the handling of

as a Communist affair. This attack, and attacks of the same
kind from a hundred sources, brought a reaction which shows
that the average Negro worker today is far in advance of the
white worker in immunity to the poison of Gompersism. Mr.
Green's platitudes are adjusted to the highly skilled craft
unionist with a Ford and a cottage; and they roll off the back
of the segregated, super-exploited Negro laborer like water
off a duck’s ‘back. A half-hour in the hall of the Negro Labor
Congress would convince anyone that the American Negro
cannot be told that he is “free.” Black men whose days are
tortured with racial persecution in connection with a double
degree of exploitation cannot be told to “let well enough
alone." For them the “well enough" is not in sight. Nor can
they be told that “the ideals of the American Federation of
Labor" are being threatened by the Communists without be-
ing made to wonder who those ﬁne fellows, the Communists,
might be. It is safe to say that Mr. Green’s attack mad-e

among the Negro workers a powerful propaganda in favor of
Communism. _ g

In fact, the many attacks of the enemies of the Negro
people against the congress as a “Communist affair” simply
brought about a condition in which hundreds of Negro work-
ers in the audience, who had not previously any intimation of

matter of course, and with no organizational basis.

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

what Communism is, were wildly ap-
plauding every mention of Communism.
It was not a “Communist affair”, but
this had a tendency toward making

it so.

In connection with Green's attack
upon the Negro Labor Congress, it
should be ‘noted that the congress even
before it opened had forced Mr. Green
to make at least one gesture toward
organizing Negro workers in New York.
But in no case could the A. F. of L. bour-
geoisie strike at the real problem by
doing away with the Jim-Crow system:
a few pitiful segregated unions “for
Negroes” (like a southern railroad car)
are about all that the A. F. of L. bureau-
cracy dreams of—for its purpose is not
to give the Negro workers an instru-
ment for liberation, but only to keep
the Negro workers from building an
instrument for freedom——to keep them
away from the “social equality” move-
ment and the Communists.

If there had been the slightest touch
of sincerity about the maneuvers of the
A, F. of L. bureaucracy, the resolution
offered by a Negro delegate at the last
convention of the A. F. of L. would not
have been shelved as it was—that is,

the Green bureaucracy did not dare either to turn it down
openly or to pass it. It was a resolution calling for the organi-
zation of Negro workers in the same way that white workers
are organized, in the same unions on equal basis. To this day
nobody can say whether the motion was defeated or not. It
has the distinction of having been acted on in such a way
that it was neither voted down nor passed. Such a cowardly
evasion shows the need of the Negro Labor Congress.

Toward Race Hegemony of Negro Workers.

A factor of primary signiﬁcance in this congress is that
it marks a big step toward the hegemony of the Negro work-
ing-class organizations in the general Negro race movement.
Hitherto there has been professional-class leadership, as a
Now for
the ﬁrst time, groups of Negro industrial workers begin to
elect their delegates. That this tends to throw the center of
gravity of the Negro movement into the Negro laborers’ ranks
is obvious. And that many Negro middle-class intellectuals
are bewildered and frightened by the fact, is but natural.

It was this rather than any “Communist domination," that
scared the Negro middle-class intellectuals. As a matter of
fact there have been Communists in every important Negro
convention that occurred in the last two or three years. In

DECEMBER, 1925

this Negro labor congress there was only on-e delegate repre-
senting the Workers Communist Party, whereas in most
other Negro conventions there have been several. In the re-
actionary “Sanhedrin Conference” last year there were ﬁve
delegates seated with credentials representing the Workers
Communist Party. The difference in the case of this Negro
labor congress is exactly in the fact that it was not domin-
ated by any person or group—and the result was that it
adopted” all of the simple and plain demands that have been
hidden in the minds of Negro mass-es for the past half-cen-
tury but which have usually been choked in their throats by
their “cautious” leaders of the middle class.

Local Councils Formed.

The organizational crux of the plan of the Negro Labor
Congress" lies in the formation of “local councils” in all cen-
ters of Negro population. The way in which the delegates
seized upon this as the basis of successful organization,

. showed that there has at last appeared here a serious move-

ment for organization. The idea is that such local councils
will be composed of delegates from all Negro organizations,
with special emphasis upon labor unions, in each locality, on
the united front basis. Organizations composed of mixed
black and white workers are included, and a peculiarly apt
arrangement is for the inclusion of unorganized Negro work-
ers in connection with the process of organizing them. The
constitution adopted speciﬁes that these local councils (like
the national body) shall not become rival organizations as
against other Negro organizations, or as against any labor
unions, but simply a machinery for the creation and coordin-
ation of a united front. If this is adhered to, it will probably
result in success where efforts to create a “newer and bet-
ter” rival to other organizations would be a failure. From
the speeches of the delegates one would judge that the es-
tablishment of these local councils will be the center of
gravity of the work of the organizers. '

Plan Inter-Racial Committees.

‘But the “united front” principle did not stop there. The
congress made the refreshing declaration in ringing terms
that the Negro Workers demand that all of organized labor
espouse their cause. This takes concrete form in the plan to

73

form “inter-racial labor committees” in every locality,_to be
composed of delegates elected by the “white” trade unions
and those elected by Negro organizations, to meet jointly for
the purpose of bringing the Negro workers into the trade
unions, preventing discrimination, under-cutting of wages. the
use of one race against. the other in strikes, etc., and for
bringing about united action of all workers, black an-'1 White,
against lynching and race riots. In this proposal there is a
touch of reality that is nothing less than startling. If it is
seriously taken up, it is full of potentialities for the future of
the labor movement and of the Negro masses.

As the Negro Labor Congress had at least a sprinkling
of representation from most of the big industrial centers, the
character of the program, as one adapted to the mass needs
of the Negro workers, and as one which is shown to be so
adapted by the spontaneous acceptance of it by many hun-
dreds who watched its development, can be considered in
connection with the question of the mass character of the
congress. I repeat that this question was not answered by
this one convention, but is held in abeyance until the organ-
izers show whether it is in them to utilize the nucleus and
the connections which they have formed.

Lay Basis for Mass Organization.’

This was the ﬁrst American Negro workers’ convention.
It had a reverberation of considerable magnitude among the
Negro masses. It laid the basis for an unprecedented mass
organization. It showed that there have developed among
the Negro workers a number of strikingly able young leaders.
For the ﬁrst time it has thrown among the confused, misled
and swindled Negro toilers a program adapted to the class
character of the Negro masses. There is every reason to be-
lieve that upon the basis already laid there can be a congress
of ten times the size and mass representation, within an-
other year.

No one not a victim of gross ignorance of the subject,
no one who is not a chronic skeptic in regard to the potenti-
alities of the Negro, can deny that the American Negro Labor
Congress was a success. All of those who participated de-
clared that itlwas an inspiring, tremendous success; and its
enemies admitted that it was so. But their estimate is not
true yet—it will be true or untrue only after they shall have
built upon the splendid foundation that they have laid.

Towards a W’or1d Bolshevik Party

By Jay Lovestone ~ 

WHY do the imperialists of every country hate and fear
the Communist International? Why have the capitalist
plunderers of every nationality turned their heaviest artil-
lery -against the Communist International and its s11DP01‘te1‘S?

Then, why do millions of the best of the working mass-
es the world over, the most conscious, the most advanced
and self-sacrificing revolutionary proletari-ans, look to the
Communist International for leadership in the struggle
against imperialist exploitation and oppression?

The answer to these pertinent questions is obvious.

The Role of the Communist International.

The bourgeoisie despise -and dread and the best prole-

tarians revere and follow the Communist International for

precisely the same reasons. Today, in the imperialist stage
of capitalism, the class struggle is international in its fun-
damental aspects; regardless of the speciﬁc forms in which
it may manifest itself and be fought in the various countries.
Consequently, if the workers of any particular country are
to ﬁght successfully against their particular national capi-
talist ruling class, they must learn to estimate the objective
economic and political conditions confronting them, from
an international, from -a world point of view, and to realize
the maximum solidarity of forces and unity of action with
the workers of the other countries.

It is exactly this prerequisite to working class victory
that the Communist International is providing. The Com-

74

munist International is the world revolutionary party of
the international working class. To the heroism of the
struggling proletariat the world over, the Communist In-
ternational adds the vital sparks and the steel rods of a
sound Marxian-Leninist program, clear and deﬁnite aims,
and the unity of organization and action so necessary to in-
sure the victory of the working cl-asses and the oppressed
colonial peoples.

The recent developments in the Communist Party of
Germany afford only additional proof of this role played by
the Communist International.

German Section Needs Help.

For some time the Communist Party of Germany had
been going downward. Largely due to the disastrous op-
portunist politics of the Brandler leadership and to the dan-
gerous ultra-leftist and Right deviations of the succeeding
Ruth Fischer-Maslow leadership, the Communist Party of Ger-
many, one of the mightiest sections of the Communist Interna-
tional, had been traveling towards total isolation from the
masses, towards complete loss of inﬂuence in the labor unions,
and towards a serious organizational weakening. But the Com-
munist International is not an abstract philosophical con-
cept. Being a. real world party with a sound, ﬁrm revolu-
tionary policy, the Communist International soon took a
vigorous hand in the situation, corrected the errors made,
and put the Communist Party of Germany back on the right
road towards winning the German working class for Com-
munism.

The Basis of the Crisis.

In his speech delivered during the sessions of the Ger-
man commission on August 12, 1925, Comrade Bukharin thus
estimated the situation: '

“This crisis has an international significance."

It is tied up with a great regrouping of forces in the

world situation. If we should live through this crisis,

it will also be an important lesson for every other

party in the Communist international.”

Let us see what is the economic and political basis of
the crisis in the Communist Party of Germany.

There are two outstanding tendencies in the develop-
ment of the international situation.

On the one hand we se-e a section of the social-demo-
cratic working masses approaching the Communist Inter-
national. By various roundabout ways these workers are
drawing nearer to the -Communist Parties. Manifestations
of this tendency are to be found in the arrival of German
and Swedish workers’ delegations in the Soviet Union. The
growing power of the proletarian state in the Soviet Union
is winning and will continue to win many new supporters
for Soviet Ru-ssia in the ranks of the working class.

“This was not so before. This is a new fact, a very
important fact. It is a fact of world historical signiﬁcance,
like the drift to the left by the English proletariat." This
is how Comrade Bukharin estimated this tendency in his
speech of August 12, 1925, before the German commission.

Secondly, the Security Pact marks a new
orientation in Germany’s policies. Previous to this event,
there was a wide sentiment of sympathy for the Soviet
Union, not merely among the proletarians, but also in the
ranks of the general masses, the petty bourgeoisie and in
sections of the bourgeoisie. Now this is changed. We
have with us today the so-called western orientation of

THE WORKERS MONTHLY
Germany’s policies. The German bourgeoisie is seeking
protection in the Dawes’ Plan, the Security Pact, the L0-
carno treaties and such other relations of being subservient
to the will of the Entente imperialists.

The “future” of Germany now rests in the West and
not in the East. No longer is there prevalent in Germany

the slogan of a common fate, of the common lot of Ger- '

many and the Soviet Union. The new slogan is: Towards
the West. '

This separation and split away from the Soviet Union
also has its reflex in the ranks of the vacillating social-de-
mocracy. This dangerously treacherous sentiment is like-
wise mirrored in the Communist Party of Germany. We
have been hearing certain comrades speak derisively in
this tone: “Go to Mosc-ow; you are a Muscovite." Such
remarks are nothing but expressions of the beginning of
the return of these comrades from our Communist Party to
the social-democrats. Levi spoke in the same manner on
the eve of his desertion.

Comrade Bukharin sums up this situation very effec-
tively when he says: “We have here two tendencies. On
the one hand, new sound elements from the ranks of the
social-democratic workers are coming to the Communist
Party. On the other hand, the worst elements inside the
Communist Party of Germany are sounding the alarm. They
are reflecting the tendencies manifested by the bourgeoisie.”

It is out of this situation that the crisis in the Commun-
ist Party of Germany h-as grown. Under the leadership of
the Maslow-Fischer group the German Party has not been
able to winover and absorb the social-democratic workers
approaching the Communists. Furthermore, this Fischer-
Maslow 1eader.ship has been unable to withstand the dan-
gerous social-democr-atic, the anti-‘Communist, -the anti-
Marxist attitude shown by the worst elements in our own
Communist ranks.

The kernel of the problem is examined by Comrade
Bukharin when he says: “The party must have such a lead-
ership as will be capable of grasping the new situation we
have. Prior to this We had to compel them (Fischer-Maslow
group) to recognize the world significance of the changes in
the British labor movement.” This is the principal basis
of the decisive action taken by the Executive Committee
of the Communist International in the German Party situ-
ation. A

No Sudden Change of Policy.

-What have been the errors of the Fischer-‘Maslow group?
What is the line of the Communist International in helping
build a powerful Bolshevik Party in Germany? What les-
sons can the American workers in general and the mem-
bers of the American section of the Communist Interna-
tional, the Workers «Communist Party, in particular, learn
from these recent events in Germany?

First of all, it must be said that the problem in the
Communist Party of Germany is not that of persons but
one involving the very fate of the party. Secondly, the
present discussion is not one carried on under the banner
of defeat as it was before the party congress at Frankfort.
The axis of the discussion is to be found in the problems
of the present and the future and not in the past. The
pith of the question lies in the making of the Communist
Party of Germany an organic part, a more virile organ of
the Communist International.

DECEMBER, 1925

Let no one think that the dis-
satisfaction on the part of the
Executive Committee of the
Communist International with the

Fischer-Maslow Central Commit-

tee of the Communist Party of
Germany has come suddenly. The
problems examined and decided
upon in the last resolution of the
Comintern on the German qu-es-
tion have been looked into and
accepted thrice: Yet these decis-
ions of the Communist Interna-
tional have not been executed.
The last congress of the party
merely brought forth this non-
exeCuti0n——th0ugh acceptan,ce—
policy in all its naked ugliness.
The last Berlin convention of the
party was a dead conference. It
reﬂected the dangerous condition
in which the party found itself,
but it mirrored no life in the
ranks of the party membership.

For nearly eighteen months the
careful observer could see the
development of a conﬂict between
the Fischer-Maslow Central Com-
mittee of the Communist Party
of Germany and the Executive
Committee of the Communist In-
ternational. One need but recall
the letter sent by Comrade Zino-
viev to the Frankfort congress of
the party, the opposition by the
Fischer-Maslow delegates to in-
ternational trade union unity at
the Fifth World Congress, the
criticism of the_ German Party
at the March, 1925, the Enlarged
Committee of the Comintern for its failure to normalize and

democratize the party, the opposition of Katz and Scholem
(allies of Fischer and Maslow) to a correct Communist
policy in the elections in which Hindenburg was chosen
president, the negotiations with the executive of the Comin-
tern on the eve of the Berlin Party Congress, among many
other instances, to see that all has not been going well for
some time in the German section of the Communist Inter-
national.

Thus we ﬁnd in the letter of the Executive Committee
of the Communist Internationl to the Communist Party of
Germany:

“Up to the last, the Executive has sought to
avoid the breaking out of an open conflict and the

resulting necessary organizational measures. . . .
We have attempted to convince the Maslow-Ruth
Fischer group of its errors by means of comrade-like
co-operation. Despite our misgivings, we avoided an
open conflict, in order that we might throw no diffi-
culties in the way of the German Left, with wlhose
political line the executive has solidarized more than
once, at a moment when it was undertaking a severe
struggle against'the right and ultra-left deviations
in the German Communist Party. . . .

“The Berlin Party Conference, and the events
immediately following its close, proved ﬁnally to the
Executive that all hopes of settling the differences
in tlhe course of normal co-operation are shattered.

Fischer force upon us the urgent necessit)’ °f laying
the question of the German Party openly before all
the members. . . .

“May our enemies break into a howl of triumph
and point their fingers at the sore spots in the Ger-
man Party. May the bourgeoisie and the social
traitors of all Germany fling scorn and derision
upon the party. LENIN HAS TAUGHT US TO EX-
POSE RUTHLESSLY ALL THE ERRORS OF OUR
PARTY, THE SOLE PARTY OF THE VANGUARD
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT, WITH
BOLSHEVIST OPENNESS, WITHOUT CONSIDER-
ING THE ENEMY. There is no party in the world,
like the Communist Party, able to recognize and to
expose its defects openly and to their logical con-
clusion. THIS IS THE SOLE PLEDGE FOR THE
RAPID AND COMPLETE OVERCOMING OF
THESE ERRORS.” (Our emphasis.)

_ After the Berlin conference Ruth Fischer sent a dele-
gation to Moscow in order to secure the repudiation of the
actions of the representatives of the executive of the Com-
intern at this conference. The answer of the Comintern
was an unequivocal declaration that such politics will no
long-er be tolerated. By this time, the opposition to the
Fischer-Maslow policies which had long been smolder-
ing in the Central Committee, succeeded in winning the ma-
jority of the committee for its position in behalf of the plat-
form of the Communist International and against the lin-e
of the Fischer-Maslow group.

The struggle was intense. Two delegations were sent
to the Comintern. Finally Ruth Fischer made a declaration
admitting the correctness of the criticism leveled against
her policies by the Communist International. The letter
from the Communist International t-o the Communist Party
of Germany referred to above was subsequently accepted
unanimously by the German commission, by the Praesidium
of the Communist International, and by all the representa-
tives of the German Party to the Comintern.

The Points of Conﬂict.

Since then there has been going on a discussion in
the German Party to win over the entire membership to
the line of the Communist International. Concretely the
tasks of the party are outlined in an analysis of the errors
made in the past and the recurrence of which must be pre-
vented at all costs. The main problems of the party and the
chief points of criticism raised again-st the old Central Com-
mittee led by Fischer and Maslow follow:

A. The Increase of the Recruiting Powers of The Party.

The Communist Party of Germany must get a new ap-
proach to the working m-asses. The isolation in which the
party ﬁnds itself as a result of the wrong policies of the
Maslow-Fischer group must be broken. I

Pessimism was the chief characteristic of the attitude
of the Maslow-Fischer Central Committee towards the
masses. The old leadership of the German section had no
faith in the powers and activity of the proletarian masses.
Its ideology was totally pessimistic. The Fischer-Maslow
group failed to react to the new processes, to the new cur-
rents in the working class. It could not see that simultane-
ously with the orientation of the German bourgeoisie west-

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

ward, there was a movement among the workers eastward,
toward the Left, a real growth of sympathy with and sup-
port of the Soviet Union. Not even once did the Fischer-
Maslow leadership realize that the time was really at hand
to help build a left wing movement, especially in the trade.
unions. * _
Apropos of this task of the party the letter of the Com-
munist International declared:

“At the present juncture the most important
task of the party is to react speedily and energetic-
ally to the impending political
the German working class.

“The masses of the social-democratic worlkers

regrouping within

now turning away from their counter-revolutionary

leaders, and beginning slowly and hesitatingly, but
incontestably, to turn towards prole-tarian revolution,
must be made to feel that THE COMMUNIST
PARTY IS REALLY A PARTY OF THE WORK-
ERS, A PARTY WHICH FIGHTS TENAICIOUSLY
FOR THE WORKERS’ INTERESTS, FOR THEIR
PARTIAL DEMANDS, FOR THEIR DAILY NEEDS.
a party which» does not regard the workers merely
as an object for agitation, but as class brothers, and
which is sincerely endeavoring to form the proletar-
ian united front in the class struggle.

“ALL THE OTHER POLITICAL STEPS UN-
DERTAKEN BY THE PARTY MUST BE MADE
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THIS MAIN TASK.”
(Our emphasis.)

B. The Intensification of the Trade Union Work.

All energies of the party must be concentrated on im-
proving and extending the trade union work and campaigns.
This work is far more important than all the shilly-shally
parliamentary maneuvers. Instead of ten percent, at least
seventy-ﬁve per cent of the party’s activities should cen-
ter in the trade union work. .

The errors of the Fischer-Maslow group on the trade
union ﬁeld have been many and serious. It was under the
leadership of Ruth Fischer that the German delegation at
the Fifth World Congress of the Communist International
fought against world trade union unity and branded this
movement as “a pawn of Russian foreign policy” and a
“rapprochement with the MacDonald English government.”
This is the nadir of the “anti-Moscow” ideology. Maslow’s
attitude was of a similar nature.

Even in its attempt to ﬁght the tendency to leave the
unions, manifested in certain sections of the working class,
the Fischer-Maslow group made serious errors. Instead of
reasoning with and trying to win over to the correct point
of view the many good, though unclear, proletarians, the
old Central Committee resorted to mechanical pressure and
cuss-words. This is very much akin to the methods used
by Fischer and Maslow in its handling of the inner-party
problems.

But worst of all is the costly mistake made by the
Fischer-Maslow leadership in dissolving the trade union de.
partment of the party. That is why the last letter of the
Comintern declares: “The organization of a competent trade
union department in the Central Committee of the Ger-
man Communist Party must afford the proof that the lead-

DECEMBER, 1925

ers of the party are seriously inclined to make this work
the fundamental task of the party."

C. Winning Over the Social-Democratic Proletarian Masses.
The party will from now on pay considerably more at-
tention to winning over the proletarian masses still fol-
lowing the banner of the social-democrats. The old lead-
ership practically failed to react to such fundamental, deep-
going diﬁerences as those which were developing in the
social-democracy of Saxony. “One must understand how to
distinguish not only in words but in deeds between the
counter-revolutionary social-democratic leaders and the
broad mass of social-democratic workers,” states the Com-
intern in its estimate of the party’s task on this ﬁeld.

D. The Normalization and Democratization of the Party.

Under the Fischer-Maslow leader-ship there prevailed in
the party too much of a factional atmosphere. Mechanical
pressure from on top was too much the order of the day.
Capable comrades were denied the opportunity to be ac-
tive in the party’s work. There was a fear of new per-
sons. A narrow clique dictatorship was established in the
old Central Committee which sought to maintain its au-
thority through such means and through methods which
really smacked of loud American advertising.

This condition is to be liquidated with energy and ‘19S'
patch. It is a non-Bolshevist relationship. New proletarian
elements are to be drawn into party activities. The initia-
tive of the broad party membership must be enhanced.
Normalizing and democratizing the party will translate it-
self in the uprooting of the old factional spirit. Party organ-
ization must- be prosecuted with far greater vigor than the
Fischer-Maslow group showed.

The letter of the Communist International is very in-
structive on this point of the bureaucratization of the Ger-
man Party when it says: .

“This question formed for us a part of the ques-
tion of the relations toward the non-party and social-
democratic workers. For when purely administrative
methods are employed in the Party, the same policy
is employed on a larger scale to the workers outside
of the Party, and the result is the cuttin off of the
possibility of winning over fresh workers. We be-
lieve.that unless the Party undertakes these inner-
party reforms, it will not be capable of carrying out a
correct policy among the masses. For these reasons
the Executive demanded these reforms to be made in
the direction of ‘normalizing Party life’. .

‘‘In the Party there is a lack of control from be-
low; that is, by the members of the Party. At the
same time, the leading group has been carrying on a
perpetual struggle against control from above; that
is, by the Executive of the Comintern. In this man-
ner such a state of affairs was created as led to a
loss of sense of responsibility, which led to various
and quite intolerable things.”

Particularly severe criticism was leveled by the Comin-
tern against the character of the Berlin Party conference
which did- not reﬂect in the least the Party life and which
was barren in every respect.

E. The Relations with the Communist international.

The more the Communist International develops into a
Bolshevized world,Party, the more importance do the relations
between the various sections and the Executive assume. The

77

attitude to the Communist International displayed ‘by the
Fischer-Maslow Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Germ.any is a very instructive example for all other Com-
munist Parties of how not to deal with the Comintern.

The Fischer-Maslow leadership entertained a childish fear
of the Communist International going to the right. It did not
trust the Comintern. An attitude of separatism from the
Communist International was developing in the Party through
the non-Bolshevist methods, through the dishonest methods
resorted to by this leadership in its dealings with the Com-
munist International.

On this point the letter of the Communist International is
very emphatic. It says:

“Another thing which must be broken with—
definitely broken with--is, the system of ‘double ac-
counting’ employed by the above-mentioned comrades
for a full year in their relations with the Comintern.
Instead of sincerely carrying out the correct line laid
down by the Comintern, this group has made contin-
ual attempts at side-tracking, substantiating their ac-
tion to their own party members by references to an
alleed ‘pressure to the right’ on the part of the Ex-
ecutive. At the same time they have offered sys-
tematic resistance to the Executive by referring to
an alleged ‘Ultra-Left Tendency’ among the members
of the German Party.”

The Central Committee of Fischer-Maslow even sent
emissaries to other Communist Parties in order to propagate
its non-Bolshevist conception of the Communist International.

The fact of the matter is that every anti-Bolshevist devi-
ation which has hitherto reared its head in Germany has be-
gun with an attack on the Soviet Government, the Russian
Communist Party, and the Communist International. All of
these deviations, whether they wore a Right or a Left‘ mask,
soon degenerated into social-democracy and resulted in alli-
ance with the social-democrats against Communism. The role
played by the Communist Labor Party, Levi, Friesland, vari-
ous Brandlerites, and the Schumacher group very well illus-
trates this truth.

And “The changes in the political situation, the ﬁnal
transition of the German bourgeoisie to a Western orienta-
tion, the climax reached by social-democratic agitation against
Soviet Russia, render the danger of anti-Bolshevist deviations
in the German Communist Party at the present juncture
greater and more acute than ever,” declared the Communist
International.

F. The Attempt to Revise Leninism Must Be Repudiated.

These Right, anti-Bolshevist deviations assumed serious
manifestations not only in the openly Ultra-Left gtoup of
Scholem, Katz and Rosenberg, but also in the Fischer-Mas-
low group. '

Comrade Zinoviev in his speech of August 13, 1925, be-
fore the German Commission, hit the nail on the head when
he said:

“The point of view of this group (Fischer-Mas-
low) was that it is the proper West European repre-
sentative of revolutionary Marxism. We in Russia
have been demoralized by the N. E. P. We are an
agricultural country. Lenin is dead. But Maslow
is alive. This was and still is the slogan of this
group. Maslow is the West European Lenin. He
understands the situation and will show the way.”

of Maslow’s cry:

In his book, “The Two Revolutions of 1917,” Maslow
makes a. frontal assault on Leninism. The Third World
Congress, which established ﬁrmly and elaborated completely
the tactics of the United Front, is the target of Maslow’s pen.
In the opinion of Maslow, this Congress drove the Comintern
to the Right, was under the spiritual leadership of Trotzky,
overestimated the Levites, enhanced opportunism everywhere,
and did more harm than good to the West-European Parties-
Maslow charges Lenin with having misjudged the German
Party.

It is obvious that such an assault is an attack on the very
heart of Leninist theory and practice. Thus We ﬁnd the
Communist International in its letter to the German Party
categorically stating: “THE EXECUTIVE DECLARES BE-
FORE THE WHOLE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL THAT
THIS MONSTROUS ATTACK UPON LENIN AND LENIN-
ISM CANNOT BE TOLERATED UNDER ANY CIRCUM-
sTANCES."

‘‘It is no accident that today, in 1925, Comrade
Maslow makes precisely the Third World Congress
the object of his attack.

“The Third Congress embodies precisely THAT
concrete link in the chain of the development of Len-
inism and of the Comintern which is of the greatest
immediate practical significance in the present sit-
uation for all Communist Parties, but above all for
the German."

No one in the German Party would today dare declare
himself in principle against the tactics of the united front.
Yet, actually, this criticism of the Third Congress by Mas-
low is an attack against the entire unit-ed front policy of the
Comintern; particularly is the truth of this seen when we are
now beginning to realize many gains from our united front
tactics.

This policy of Maslow translated into practical work
means total bankruptcy. It means the destruction of all trade
union work and of the party as a living revolutionary organ-
ism. The letter of the Comintern to the German Party—a
most instructive document which every Communist should
study carefully——very properly characterizes the signiﬁcance
“Back to the Second World Congress,”
when it says: '

“Those, who like Comrade Maslow, deny this im-
portant turning point in our tactics, those who seek
to discredit it as a ‘swing to the Right,’ those who
deride it as a concession to Trotzkyism or to the
apostate Levi, ARE ATTACKING THE FUNDA-
MENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COMINTERN."

There is no doubt that one of the best guarantees for the
healthy development of the Communist Party of Germany
into a powerful Bolshevik mass Party is the honest and ﬁrm
determination of the new Central Executive Committee, led
by such comrades as Thaelmann and Neumann, to destroy
all such anti-Bolshevist tendencies as were manifested by
Maslow in his onslaugh-t against Leninism and the" Comin-
tern.

G. The Riht Deviations of the Maslow-Fischer Group Must
Be Corrected.

There are some who will try to misinterpret this policy
of the Communist International as a criticism of the German
Left, as an attack from the Right, as driving the Communist
Party of Germany to the Right. That explains why the letter

THE VVORKERS MONTHLY

of the Comintern to the German Party states so clearly:
“WE CONSIDER THESE ASSERTIONS TO BE

WRONG. IT IS NOT THE LEFT WHICH IS BANK-

RUPT, BUT SOME OF THE LEADERS OF THIS

LEFT, and the Left itself will hold its own along

other lines, winning ever-increasing numbers of the

Party members and developin energetic and posi-

tive work."

The fact of the matter is that the errors made by the
Maslow-Fischer group are not errors of a Leftist character
but of an extreme Right anti-Bolshevist character. We need
but cite the overestimation of parliamentary activity by this
group, its pessimistic attitude towards the masses, its dan-
gerous anti-Comintern attitude and its continuous coquetting
with the Ultra-Left, as only a few of the Right deviations of
the Fischer-Maslow group.

There is no doubt that the Communist Party of Germany
still faces dangers from the Left and the Right. But with the
active guidance of the Communist International, with the Com-
munist soundness at heart of the mass of members and with
the energetic Bolshevization program and activities of the
new Central Executive Committee, the Communist Party of
Germany will surely make considerable progress from now
on towards a mass Bolshevik Party.

Some Valuable Lessons_for America.

From the crisis in the German Party, the American
workers, especially our Party members, can learn much.

The international situation is common in its fundamental
aspects in the various countries and produces similar prob-
lems at particular moments. Of course, the manifestations of
the reactions of the working class to this general condition
take on speciﬁc and peculiarly local forms in each country.
Thus, it is no accident to ﬁnd that the disease of pessimism
has attacked the American section as well as the German
Party at about the same time; though the form in which this
disease manifested itself in the Workers Communist Party
differed from the form in which it showed itself in the Com-
munist Party of Germany.

Luckily, we have a world revolutionary party in the
Communist International that is quick to correct such dan-
gerous errors creeping into the policies and tactics of its
various sections in their particular reactions to their speciﬁc
objective conditions. The Communist International has cor-
rected the error of pessimism in our Party as well as in the
German Party, to the tremendous advantage of both parties.

I. The Question of Pessimism.

In the recent controversy in our Party over the question
of the Labor Party we had the dangers of pessimism perme-
ating our ranks with demoralizing and deadening effect. A
whole theory of the “Masses At Rest” and “The Mass Grave”
developed in the last Party discussion. In the Daily Worker
of November 15, 1924, we read:

‘‘If it is true that the Communists and their

Party were so much ‘impossible’ that the masses will

not turn to them for leadership, even in the hour of

bitter need and in the absence of any other leader-

ship, then. Well, then the only thing the Amer-

ican Labor Movement could do would be to form im-

mediately one general, universal grave-digging asso-

ciation, and begin digging one fraternal grave for the
entire working class." _

This is, in the last analysis, an expression of utter help

DECEMBER, 1925

lessness. To cover the fact that they did not know what to
do, these comrades declared categorically: “Nothing can be
done."

And in the Daily Worker of December 2, 1924, we are
treated to this expression of pessimism, to this confession of
a total lack of faith in the activity of the masses:

“The masses which are dissatisﬁed with the two

old capitalist parties-—as parties—have now found

their haven in the LaFoIlette movement. As far as

building a new party is concerned, the masses are
now at rest.”

More than that. In the very attitude against a Labor
Party policy in our Party we have an interesting resemblance
to the attitude of the Maslow-Fischer group and its ultra-left
ally towards the united front. “We are not opposed to the
united front in principle, but we are opposed to this or that
application of it at this time,” has been the cry of the fol-
lowers of the Fischer-Maslow group in Germany. This sounds
very familiar. It sounds almost like the cry, “We are not
opposed to the Labor Party in principle but whoever raises
the slogan of a Labor Party at this time is not a Commun-
ist.”

The Fischer-Maslow Central Committee sneered at par-
ticipation by the Party in the struggle for the daily demands
of the workers. The Fischer-Maslow group declared that the
masses are not interested in their daily needs. The inactivity
and the passivity with which this leadership was itself in-
fected were transferred to and seen in the proletarian masses
by the Fischer-Maslow Central Committee. After the presi-
dential election in 1924, some of the leaders of our Party in
the United States saw in the masses no activity, all passivity,
pessimism, insofar as the struggle for independent political
action was concerned.

2. Approaching Proletarian Masses.

The Communist Party of Germany had erred in its fail-
ure to approach properly and to maintain sufficient contact
with the social-democratic masses. Our Party made a similar
serious mistake in its attitude after the 1924 election cam-
paign, towards the farmer-labor masses when the labor party
slogan and campaign were dropped and when an intense
ideological campaign was launched to propagandize the Party
against the Labor Party. ’

Fundamentally, these errors in Germany and America
are akin, though their forms differ because of the diﬁer-
ence in the class relationships and the difference
in the extent of the political development of the working
classes in the two countries. In both instances, these errors
were mistakes of an opportunist sectarian character.

The German Communist Party began to bask in the set
sun of its own splendid isolation. Likewise, some leading ele-
ments in our Party tried to make a virtue out of the isolation
into which we fell through a combination of wrong political
policies and unfavorable objective conditions.

3. The Attitude Toward the Comintern.

In the question of its attitude toward the Communist In-
ternational, the American Party has much to learn. This was
demonstrated especially in the attitude of Comrade Foster
toward the last decision of the Comintern. While professing
allegiance to the Comintern, he agitated the Party against
the decision of that body. While protesting loyalty to the
leadership of the Comintern, he agitated among his followers
about the “mistakes” of this leadership.

Such a policy is akin to that of the Fischer-Maslow group.

79

Two sets of books—one for public consumption, with doc-
tored accounts, and one private set, revealing the real
accounts.

The Communist International is the outward, the real
form of the international unit)’ of our Communist movement.
Decisions of the Communist International are the expressions
of one international experience on the problems of the differ-
ent national parties. The value of this experience lies not
only in the fact that, in the form of Comintern decisions, it
corrects wrong policies, but also, and most -important of all,
it conveys this international experience in the form of theo-
retical and practical lessons to the Party concerned. When
a Comintern decision reverses a policy of a national party it
-is done on the basis of an experience that was not at the
disposal of the body which decided the original policy. The
decision of the Communist International makes available such
iI1te1‘Ilati0I1a1 experience to the leadership of the national
party. And this leadersh-ip, in turn, must be instrumental in
making this experience available to the whole membership of
the Party.

The seriousness with which the party leadership ap-
plies itself to this task, is a criterion of its Communist
quality and its loyalty to the Comintern.

In this respect our Party has to overcome serious short-
comings. Formal admittance of mistakes has been used as
a method to conceal them. Minor errors have been inﬂated
to hid-e major mistakes. That is not Leninism. It is the
exact opposite. Leninism is deadly poison to such policies.
What is most important, is that such policies are deadly
poison to Leninism, to Bolshevism. A partyconducted and
led by such methods will never be a Bolshevik Party.

The latest manifestation of such an attitude against
the line of the Communist International was cited by Com-
rade Green when he declared:

“The resolution of Cannon was accepted for the
Communist international. ‘But as candidates for the
Politbureau were selected Comrades Foster and Bit-
teiman who took a position against the Communist
International, against the decisi-on of the Comintern.

In words, therefore, they were for the Communist

international, in action, against it. in words, for

Cannon, in deeds, for Foster and Bitteiman."

Today, the central issue between the right wing and the
Communist elements in our Party is the difference in atti-
tude towards the Communist International.

Was the American Decision Made Suddenly“?

Some have expressed profound amazement at the “sud-
denness” of the Comintern’s “change” of policy for the Ameri-
can Party as shown in its caxbled decision to the Fourth
National Convention of our Party.

There certainly was no “suddenness” in the action of the
Communist International. The decision came after months
of patient waiting, after months of careful and thorough
examination of all the facts.

The decision of the Communist International on the
American question, made in April, 1925, confronted the
leadership of the American Party with a great task. its
fundamental policy was reversed. Did it understand this
reversal? Did it endeavor to understand it or to convey
an understanding of it to the membership?

The Comintern was treated to a. spectacle that it could
not help noticing. Here was a leadership that had been shown
its error and now had to prove its revolutionary reliability
and seriousness by a Leninist self-criticism. Instead of that,
the Communist International found a systematic eifort to-

80

wards deceiving the membership in regard to the Comintern
decision. This attempt at deception was resorted to in the
interest of a faction. The interest of a faction was considered
paramount to the interest of the Party.

Another basis for the action of the Communist Inter-
national was the treatment of the Lore danger in the Party.

‘The Party was instructed to forge the club of unity of the

Party to combat Lore. But in reality the club of Loreism
was swung to combat unity. The interests of the Party
were sacriﬁced on the altar of a faction, while the need of
the hour demanded that the faction should be sacriﬁced
on the altar of the Party.

All this, coupled with the opportunist sectarian tenden-
cies were largely responsible for the deadening of the Party’-s
life and ac-tivities, for the practical collapse of the Party's
trade union work, which vacillated between crazy leftism
and the rankest opportunism; for the practical cessation
of the Party's political campaigns and its almost total isola-
tion. All «this dictated the last Comintern decision on the
American Party.

Lore, and his opportunist allies who may still remain
in our Party, are vainly trying to get solace out of the d-e-
cision on the German question. They say this is a move
to the right. ~ Therefore, the Communist International will
soon reverse its line for America. Lore has expressed him-
-self to this effect in the Volkszeitung. Lore and his allies are
totally wrong. The American decision, like the German
decision, is a deadly blow against the right wing.

Our Main Tasks.

Today, the new Central Executive Committee of our
Party is facing a very diﬂicult time. The new Central Ex-
ecutiive Committee must normalize and democratize the
Party. It must free itself completely of all factional preju-
dices. I-t must remove ruthlessly all vestiges of factional
clique rule no matter where and by whom it manifests
itself.

The new C-entral Executive Committee must increase
the initiative of the Party membership and must activize
our ranks. We must broaden considerably the leading Party
cadre-s. We must drop all mechanical, dictatorial methods.
We must develop a spirit of Bolshevist self-criticism.

In this‘ sense, the signiﬁcance of the uniﬁcation of the
Communist elements, as indicated by the unity between
the Ruthenberg group and those Comrades of the former
majority supporting the line of Comrade Cannon for the
Communist International, cannot be overestimated. This un-
iﬁcation of Communist forces is a positive step toward
putting a’ complete end to the factional struggle in our
Party. With this solidarity of the Communist elements in
our Party, the enemies’ of the line of the Comin-tern have
been struck a severe blow.

This unity will hasten the total eradication of factional
hostility. It will lift completely, the state of siege—factional
siege-—wh'ich has done such -incalculable damage t-o your
Party. This unity will prevent all possible dangers of me-
chanical methods being resorted to by the new Central Com-
mittee. It will tend to uproot the distrust and suspicion
which have been paralyzing -our Party’s life. With this
uniﬁcation, the Central Executive Committee will be able
to proceed even more vigorously with its reorganization
program than it has done so far.

Simultaneously with the drawing of new elements into
Party work there will come an activization of the entire

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

Party membership and the mobilization of -the Party for
mass activities. We will be in a position to begin to utilize
effectively the partial, the every-day demands of the work-
ers for the development of their class, their political con-
sciousness.

The Central ‘Executive Committee must above all see
to it that the Party’s trade union activities are increased at
least ten-fold. Our Central Committee’s trade union de-
partment must be made a muc=h more living, a far better
functioning, an intensely virile department. Our answer
to -the expulsion policy of the reactionary bureaucracies must
be “into the unions” for our membership. .We must destroy

the dangerous concept which has hitherto prevailed in cer-

tain sections of our ranks that trade union activity is the
art and craft of a special group of expert trade unionist
-comrades. L Trade union activity must become the activity
-of all our members.
ally revise our trade union policy to bring it fully in line
with the program of the Red International of Labor Unions.

The labor party campaign must be resumed energetical-
ly. The Central Committee should lose no time in educating
the Party membership to the need of such a campaign and
must carefully prepare the ground for launching a vigorous
campaign for a Labor Party in the trade unions and other
labor organizations. In doing this, we should make effort
to avoid the errors from the left as well as from the right
which we have made in the past. I

Finally, we must elevate the Communist understanding
of our membership. We should train a corps of new Party
workers. We should politicalize our Party much more than
We have done to date. We should “Americanize” and “un-
ionize” our Party in the true Bolshevist sense of the word.
A spirit of Party loyalty must be cultivated in. our ranks.
A spirit of Party work must be developed in larger -sections
of our membership. The uniﬁcation of all Communist forces
for the line of the Comintern, regardless of all past fac-
tional alignments should be the central task of our Party
bolshevization campaign.

The Beginning of Bo-lshevizatioln.

The toes of the Communist International in every coun»
try will be painfully disappointed if -they expect a weakening
of the German Party as a result of the last decision. It is
interesting to note how our enemies outside and within the
Communist International greet the diiﬁculties the various
Communist Parties must experience. Every difficult mo-
ment in the life of a Communist party, every obstacle a
Communist party has to overcome is usually hailed by these
enemies of the proletariat as the beginning of the end of the
Communist party in question. Usually, these critical mo-
ments in the lives of our Parties are only the occasions
for new periods of activity, progress and development of
our Parties.

There is no use in denying the fact that our own Work-
ers Communist Party has been and is still going through
a crisis. We are in the crisis of Bolshevization. We are
taking the ﬁrst steps towards laying a healthy Bolshevik
foundation for our Party. Let our enemies in the ranks
of the bourgeoisie, in the Socialist Party, Lore and Company
and the right wing of our Party welcome our diﬂiculti-es
and hardships. The Workers Communist Party will come

«out of this critical test stronger than it has ever been and

really prepared to develop into a mass Bolshevik Party—a
living, fighting, victorious section of the world revolutionary
party of the proletariat:-The Communist International.

At the same time, we must fundament-

Professor Carver Makes a “Revolution”
By C. E. Ruthenberg

“The Present Economic Revolution in the United States.”
By Thomas Nixon Carver.
N the present historical period, with a, Proletarian Revolu-
tion victorious in Russia and a new social order actually
in the process of being created in the Soviet Union, it is
no longer advisable for the economists who serve as the
defenders of the capitalist system to scoff at theidea of a.
revolutionary change. in the existing social order. Rather,
it is their role to prove that the crude, violent method of
the workers seizing the governmental power, hurling the
capitalists from their seats of the mighty and conﬁscating
industry, is entirely unnecessary because the same result
can be achieved in other ways.
H. G. Wells, for instance, found the Marxian method of
revolution not at all to his liking. The idea of the exploited,

oppressed workers—a class——-throwing their masters from I

their backs by force and proceeding to build a. new soci-al
order, clashed harshly with his conception of a nice, orderly,
peaceful, “New Machiavellian” creation of a new social sys-
tem. In order to escape from the harsh reality of actual
revolution in this world’of ours, he proceeded to ﬁnd sub-
stitutes for the method of oppressed classes revolting against
their oppress-ors and by force ending the rule of their op-
pressors. These substitutes have been given to us in a
long series of novels.

Revolution by Miracles.

“The Sleeper Wakes” gave us a fantastic presentation
of the concentration of ownership under capitalism. The
hero, possessor of a small fortune, remains in a cataleptic
state for a hundred years, at the end of which he awakes
to ﬁnd himself the owner of the earth. The workers have
become a specialized form of human beings physically, as
well as an economic caste. The trustees of the Sleeper’s
fortune own and- rule the world. The Sleeper’s horror be-
cause‘ of what is done in his name precipitates the revolution.
In “The War of the Worlds” the men of Mars, driven from
their own planet by the fact that conditions which‘ will no longer
sustain life are approaching, make a raid upon the earth
with a consequent war between the men -of earth and the
Martians. Unfortunately for the Martians, they cannot
live upon our germ-laden food. They are killed oﬁ by it,
but while the war of the worlds lasts the men of the earth
learn the lessons which result in the creation of a collec-
tivist -society. “The Food of the Gods,” through which men
grow into giants, brings a similar struggle between the
giants and the present pigmy men with the same conse-
quences. “In the Days of the Comet” miraculous changes
take place in human nature through the earth passing
through the tail of a comet, .and mankind awakes to live
and work in a co—operative brotherhood. “The World Set
Free” pictures capitalist, scientist and_ worker uniting to
reconstruct society on a new basis, after a w-ar in which the
chief weapon has been bombs which release atomic energy,
spreading havoc and destruction and wiping out whole cities.
In his latest effort along the same line, “The Dream,” Wells
is even driven to ﬁnd his utopia in another dimension, exist-

ing in the same space and at the same time with our present
earthly social system.

Thomas Nixon Carver, Professor of Political Economy
at Harvard University, in “The Present Economic Revolu-
tion in the United States” makes a similar effort at ‘sub-
stituting an impossible method of achieving a revolutionary
change in our economic system for the way which history
shows to be the only method of achieving such a change.
He endeavors to prove that class consciousness is a “frame
of mind” and class struggle is an outgrown method of ﬁght-
ing, that capitalism in the United States has so increased
wealth production and the workers’ share of the
wealth produced that the _workers are becoming capi-
talists and‘ the owners of industry, and that this process
will continue until the difference between worker and capi-
talist will disappear entirely.

Professor Carver does not only appear in the role of an
economist presenting facts and drawing conclusions from
them. If his book contained such a presentation only one
might ﬁnd it as amusing as one of Wells’ impossible ro-
mances, and pass it over. Carver not only presents his
thesis and endeavors to prove it, but also essays the role
of the propagandist and urges upon the labor movement
the conscious adoption of his method of achieving a social
revolution. In fact, only one chapter of twenty-four pages
is devoted to the “economic revolution.” In the remaining
two hundred and thirty-nine pages he preaches to the work-
ers and gives them learned but unsound advice.

It is worth while, before taking up the main theory of’
the book, to examine some of the views which evidently
pass for sound political economy in our colleges. The book
liter.ally reeks with statements and theories, presented with
all the gravity and seriousness of a professor of political
economy, which will not bear even the most superﬁcial
analysis.

Marxian Materialism.

As a ﬁrst example, we have the following on the Mater-
ialist Conception of History:”

“One of their (The Bolsheviks’) leading doc-
trines is the materialistic interpretation of history
which, under Marx's: perversion, allows for no ideal-
ism of any kind. This doctrine in its more scientific
form did not originate with Marx, nor was he its most
erudite and logical expounder. Buckle did it much
better. Marx combined it, however, with another
doctrine, that of evo|ution'through class struggle.
These two doctrines in combination leave no room
for any form of idealism. Neither doctrine, taken
alone, is so very deadly; at least, no more so than
any other false doctrine. In combination, however,
they are perfectly deadly and completely destructive,
not only of our material civilization, but of all ideals,
on which any civilization was ever based. The pres-
e-nt revolution in Russia is a proletarian revolution,
based upon the crass self-interest of the so-called
proletarians. They do not even profess to be work-

ideals; they stand for themselves alone.
they are consistent followers of Marx.”

Russian Workers Striving for Better Society.

This might pass as a propaganda editorial in a yellow
capitalist newspaper, but from a professor -of political econ-
omy, who is presumed to know even the theories he opposes
when he writes about them, one expects something more
clever. Marx did not exclude idealism (in the sense of the
inﬂuence of a desire for a better state of society) from
among the factors which inﬂuence the action of individuals.
Marxian materialism does say that the way men gain their
living, the cla.ss relationships which grow out of an existing
economic system, are the dynamic forces from which their
actions spring. The workers today have conceived of the
ideal, and are striving for the ideal of a collectivist society,
because the development of the machinery of production
under the capitalist system makes the collective ownership
of that machinery of production the only means of abolish-

By Julian de Miskey

mg the exploitation and oppression from which they suffer
and of ending the class conflict to which the ownership of
that machinery of production by capitalism gives rise. The
Russian revolution is based upon the interest of the work-
ers as a class, but the interest of the workers coincides with
the realization of the greatest ideal which man has conceived
-—the creation of a social order in which one class does not
live and thrive upon exploitation and oppression of .-another.
but in which all men co-operate for the satisfaction of their
common needs.

The fraudulent character of Professor Carver’s attack
upon Marxian materialism becomes apparent a little farther
along in the same chapter from which the above quotation
is taken, when he argues against the possibility that the
proletarian revolution will abolish war. He says:

“The history of efforts to eliminate war by con-
quest, and the elimination of all ruling groups except
the one that is victorious, does not lend much sup-
port to the theory that the PAX BOLSHEVIKA
would endure for a long time, OR THAT IT WOULD
BE PROOF AGAINST THE CONFLICT OF INTER-

ESTS AMONG THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT

MUST NECESSARILY BE INCLUDED UNDER

THE TERM OF PROLETARIAT. (Emphasis mine.)

Marxian materialism and the doctrine of the class strug-
gle “are perfectly deadly and completely destructive, not
only of our material civilization, but -of all ideals on. which
any civilization was ever based” when they are applied to
the capitalist system, but when Professor Carver makes an
argument against Communism he is compelled to seek a
“conﬂict of interest among the various elements that must
necessarily be included under the term proletariat.” Of
c-ourse the conﬂict of interest beween elements of the .pro-
letariat in a socialized society is a ﬁgment of the professor’s
imagination. '

The Basis of Revolutions.

Another example of the same sort of reasoning appears
in the following: -

“An economic revolution may follow as a result

of a political revolution, but it usually does not.-

According to De Tocqueville the one signiﬁcant eco-

nomic result of the French Revolution, which was

primarily political, was that the land of the peasants
‘ was freed from a multitude of duties and restrictions

and became theirproperty in a more complete sense
than it had ever been. Up to the present (1925)
that is the only economic improvement over the old
regime that is noticeable in Russia; yet the specific
purpose of the Russian revolutionlst was to use the
power of government to force a new economic order
upon the people.”

If Professor Carver had read his history aright he would
certainly not have propounded the theory that economic
revolutions follow political revolutions. To -the contrary,
political revolutions follow and are the expression of economic
revolutions. Feudalism gave way to capitalism, because
the capitalist had seized political power and -then proceeded
to build the capitalist social order? Just the reverse! Com-
merce developed under the feudal regime and as soon as
the capitalist class, which came into being with the growth
of new commerce, became suﬁiciently strong, it challenged
the power and overthrew the old regime. Capitalism has
since undergone an economic revoluti-on in the development
of large—scale, collective production, and has created the
modern proletariat. The political revolutions which lie ahead
will express that economic revolution by placing the state
power in the hands of the proletariat, which will use it to
expropriate the capitalists and bring the ownership, man-
agement and distribution of the products of industry in
harmony with the colleqtive lproduction -which the eco-
nomic revolution under capitalism has already produced.

Professor Carver may gain solace out of the belief that
the Russian proletarian revolution has achieved nothing, if
the fact that the Soviet government has expropriated all
capitalists and now owns and manages collectively, in the
interest of the workers, 80 per cent of Russian industry
outside of agriculture, means so little to him as an exponent
and defender of capitalism!

Are Class Distinctions a “Frame of Mind?”

Professor Carver’s views on why class conﬂict and class
consciousness exist in the United States are as unique as the
opinions quoted above. He tells us:

“It would seem that with our democratic tra-

'or the capita1ist’s proﬁts shall be increased.

ditions and our universal respect for labor, with

our common-school system under which employer

and employe could have gone to school together and
called one another by their ﬁrst names-—as‘ they prob-
ably did—such a thing as class distinction SHOULD

NOT HAVE ARISEN.” (Emphasis mine.)

But class distinctions have arisen and Professor Carver
must ﬁnd a reason for them. One reason he gives is that
they are the result of “a frame of mind." Another reason is
that the workers, or as the Professor Carver prefers -to call
them, the laborers, emphasize the wrong thing.

He gives us the example -of the relationship between
husband and wife. There are points of harm-ony and of con-
ﬂict between them. If through some carelessness -they make
the mistake of emphasizing the points of conﬂict there will
be conﬂict between them. On the other hand, if they empha-
size the points of harmony they will have a peaceful and
pleasant life together.

We are glad to accept Professor Carver’s example.
There are things leading to harmony and things leading to
conﬂict between husband and wife, but there is one funda-
mental relationship which is decisive——their sexual life to-
gether. If one or the other happens to stray in relation to
that, all the other harmonies do not help much. They usu-
ally land in the div-orce court.

There happens to be such a fundamental relationship
between the capitalists and the worker. The w-orker wants
the greatest share of his product that he can force from the
capitalist. The capitalist wants the highest rate of proﬁt he
can secure. These two things .are in conﬂict. This differ-
ence of interest divides the capitalist and worker into two
economic classes. The fact that this is so is testiﬁed to by
a thousand strikes, boycotts, lockouts, injunctions, court ac-
tions, use of police and military power, all growing out of
the question of whether the workers’ share of his product
No change in
the worker's frame of mind will change this hard economic
fact. His experiences in this struggle with the capitalists
makes the worker class conscious.

Professor Carver will have nothing to do with this basis
of the development of class consciousness. He does not seek
the reason in economic facts but in a “frame of mind.” He
cites the example of a cattleman: So long as the old man
ran the ranch there was no class consciousness. He was
the friend of every cowboy. When the old man died and the
absentee son,and daughter living in the city became the
owners, class consciousness developed. It wasn't a question
of economic, but of personal relationship. '

Professor Carver might consider the example of Henry
Ford. Ford started his business in a small factory and
probably called his men Bill, Jack and Tom, just as did the
cattleman. He is still intimately connected with his High-
land Park plant "employing forty thousand men and the
River Rouge plant employing other tens of thousands. He is
not an absentee owner. But there is class consciousness
and class conﬂict between Henry Ford and his thousands
of employes. Professor Carver doesn’t see the difference
between a cattleman and his dozen cowboys working together
or Henry'Ford and a half dozen helpers in a little shop and
a modern industrial Plant employing thousands of workers,
except in the terms of the personal relationship of the owner
to his employes. There is a more fundamental difference.

(Gonti-12-uied on. page 87)

84

Henry Ford’s forty thousand workers are producing auto-
mobiles collectively, each performing some highly special-
ized piece of work. They are working collectively, and as
a result think collectively in the terms of their interest as a
class. None of them can hope to achieve the ownership of
Ford’s plant individually. They can make the ownership

collective .and the distribution of the equivalent of the value
of their product collective, just as their work is carried on
collectively. It is not the personal relationship but the new
mode of productionwhich develops class consciousness and
class struggle and ultimately the proletarian revolution and
socialization of industry.

The Revolution Itself.

With this clearing away of some of the incidental argu-
ment We can turn to the main theory of the bo-ok. Professor
Carver states it thus: “Wealth is not only increasing at a
rapid rate, but the wages of those we formerly pitied are
rising, laborers are becoming capitalists, and prosperity is
becoming more and more widely diffused.”

There is not a single ﬁgure in the book to show that the
real wages of the workers of the United States have risen.
If Professor Carver could prove that he would have s-ome
basis for his “revolution.”

Unfortunately for Professor Carver, the contrary is true.
R-eal wages in the United States show a decline during the
last quarter of a century. In place of receiving wages which
will buy more of their pr-oduct, the workers’ wag-es will buy
less of their product.

Another college professor has dug out the facts which
completely annihilate Professor Carver’s arguments. These
are contained in a book, “The Movement of Real Wages-
1890-1924,’’ by Paul A. Douglas, Professor of Industrial Rela-
tions in the University of Chicago. Using as the basic period
for comparison the ten-year period of 1890-1899, Prof. Douglas
comes to the conclusion that a-s compared to the cost of living
and wages paid during this period, the wages received by the
workers in 1923 will purchase only 95 per cent of the product
compared to the cost of the things the workers must buy.
Wages in 1923, therefore, in place of having risen have ac-
tually decreased. In place of the workers having the oppor-
tunity of becoming capitalists because of increase in their
share of the wealth produced, they are compelled to submit
to a lower standard of life because their wages will not buy
as much as they would twenty-ﬁve years ago. That is
reality as compared to Professor Carver’s imaginary basis
of an economic revolution in the United States.

Professor Carver endeavors to prove his point by other
means than through showing an increase in the real wages
of the workers -of this country. He cites the increase in
savings deposits, in saving and loan investments, the increase
in insurance, the purchase of stock by employes and the
growth of labor banking.

Savings deposits in the United States increased from
$8,728,536,000 deposited in 11,385,734 _accounts to $20,873,-
562,000 deposited in 38,867,994 accounts in 1924. These are
striking ﬁgures, but as Professor Carver himself admits, part
of the increase is due to the decline in the purchasing power
of the dollar. As to the workers’ share in th-e savings de-
posits, all that Professor Carver can -oﬁer against the hard
fact that actual wages have declined is, “There is a reason-

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

able probability that wage workers furnish a. fair share of
the small savers.”

The increase of life insurance, the increase in assets
of saving and loan associations and of life insurance out-
standing, which Professor Carver uses to prove his case, is
subject to the same criticism. There is no evidence to show
that this increase was the result of larger investments in
building and loan associations and in life insurance by the
workers. The probability of taking into consideration the
decrease in the workers’ _real wages is against such an
assumption.

Adding up the total savings deposits, the total assets
of building and loan associations, and the life insurance
premiums paid for the last ﬁve years, Professor Carver gets
the sum of $34,666,629,573. He continues his argument as
follows.

“Of course this must be discounted somewhat be-
cause these savings are not wholly by laborin peo-
ple. Discount this as much as we dare, it is still a
fair inference that the share of the working people in
the billions of savings will be somewhere in me bu-
lions. Any day the laborers decide to do so, they
can divert a few billions of savings, to the purchase
of the common stock of industrial corporations, rail-
roads, and public service companies, and actually
control a considerable number of them. This is not
necessarily a good policy, but it is within their power
to do so if they decide that it is to their interests.”

Could there be a slenderer basis for an economic revo-
lution than this! No proof how much of this sum of $34,-
666,629,573 belongs to the workers. It is to be discounted
“somewhat.” Somewhat may be ﬁve, ten or twenty-ﬁve per
cent. But there is no proof that it should not be ulscuunted
ninety per cent. Then what is to happen? The workers
are to withdraw a few billions and buy the common stock
of industrial corporations, or other enterprises.’ Dear Pro-
fessor Carver, think a moment about what would happen if
the workers had the few billions and did decide to Wl[.ll(1I'aW

them from the savings banks or saving and loan associations ’

or the insurance companies. There would be a ﬁnancial
cris-is such as the world has never witnessed. The banks
would close their doors. Factories would stop production.
The workers would be driven to the streets, out of employ-
ment by the tens of millions, and the very likely consequence
would be that the suﬁering and misery resulting would drive
the workers to revolution, the seizure of the governmental
power .and to the abolition of the capitalist system. Thus
Professor ‘Carver’s method of achieving the economic revolu-
tion in the United States would lead directly to a revolution
of the kind the Professor is propagandizing the workers
against throughout his whole book.

Stock Buying by Workers.

Unquestionably some workers, in the fear of losing their
jobs, have invested money in the stock of the corp-oration
by which they are employed. Professor Carver cites the fact
that out of a thousand corporations circularized by the “Fi-
nancial World,” 104 replied that their employees were stock
holders. We must consider, however, that in 1919 there
were 290,105 industrial concerns in the United States and
the fact that a few hundred have inveigled their employes

DECEMBER, 1925

into stock-buying schemes is not of suﬂicient signiﬁcance
so that a claim of economic revolution may be based on it.

We might examine also the actual facts in regard to
some of the corporations which Professor Carver cites as
having adopted employees’ What
share of the capital stock have the employees? How much
control does it give them? Wihat chance is there of the
workers becoming the owners of~industry through this
method?

The investments of employees in stock compared to the
total capitalization is so small as to be practically useless in
giving them a larger share of the product of industry or
control over the industry. Take the case of the General
Motors Corporation, in which, Professor Carver states, the
employees own 270,000 shares of common stock valued in
excess of four million dollars. The total capitalization of
the General Motors Corporation in 1914 was $23,419.213. By
1922, this capitalization had increased to $126,476,237. Dur-
ing the same period the 72,000 employees of the corporation,
according to Professor Carver, were able to acquire the
ownership of four million of the increase of a hundred
twenty-three millionin the capitalization of the company.
The capitalists were able to invest a hundred nineteen mil-
lion to the workers’ four million. At that rate of progress
the economic revolution Professor Carver is writing about
will be a long time in arriving. Also the fact that the 72,000
employees own approximately $50 each of the capital stock
on which they may receive a dividend of $3 each for a year,
doesn’t change to any extent their relation to the distribution
of the products of the industry.

Or we might take the example of the International Har-
vester Company, also mentioned by Professor Carver. The
workers have acquired a ﬁve million dollar interest in this
corporation. The capitalization of the corporation is $143,-
721,971. Workers have not yet acquired a 4 per cent interest
in the capital and at the rate the capital st-ock increases
they will never acquire such an interest.

The clinching argument against Professor Carver’s Whole
case is in the statistics covering the distribution of personal
incomes in the United States. The National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research has published a study of this question, “In-
come in the United States,” based upon all the available
sources of information. The Bureau comes to the conclusion
that the total income of all persons gainfully employed in the
year 1916 was $57,954,722,341. The total number of income
receivers was 37,569,060. Out of this total 32,278,411 received
incomes below $2,000. The total income of this group was
‘$3-1,592,405,292. The remaining income receivers receiving
incomes from $2,000 to over one million were 5,290,649. Their
total income amounted to $23,362,317,049. The overwhelming
number of the wage workers of the Uni-ted States were in
the class which receives less than $2,000 per year. Their
income was at a ﬁgure which required the expenditure of all
that they receivd for the necessities of life. In order to live
half-way decently, they were -obliged to expend their total
income. '

In the class receiving incomes of over $2,000—per year,
there were relatively few wage workers. This class received
incomes upon which they could live and have something left
over for investment. In this class were included all of the
capitalists of the United States.

stock investing plans.

85

I-t requires no great mental acumen to understand that
the 32,278,411 which received $34,592,405,292 of the national
income had very little indeed to invest in the industries,
whereas the 5,290,649 who received $23,362,317,049 of the
national income would have a great deal to invest. Practic-
ally all of the investments in industry come out of their
income. The 32 million cannot compete with them in making
investments and can never hope to gain control of industry
thru the comparative pittances which they could, at the cost
of great sacriﬁce, spare for investment from their incomes.
Professor Carver should study these ﬁgures. They show the
impossibility of the economic revolution which he is offering
to the working class.

The Carver Revolution a Wellsian Revolution.

One could go on citing facts and ﬁgures in_answer to
Professor Carver. One could write about a score of other
arguments in his book which do not stand the test of analysis.
But the case seems clear enough. Professor Carver has
made another Wellsian revolution. This revolution is as
likely to happen as any one of the half-dozen which H. G.
Wells drew out of his imagination.

There is one point, however, in which one might agree
to some extent with Professor Carver. He argues that the
capitalist system will not collapse—-cannot c-ollapse——but that
it will require force to usher it out of existence. The forces
which are weakening the capitalist system have been in
operation since the war. Its solid foundations are being
undermined by these forces. It is being weakened. But its
ﬁnal disappearance will not be the result of these forces alone
but of a power which capitalism generates and which will
deal it the ﬁnal blows. That power is the revolutionary
working class. When the revolution comes in the United
States it will not be through, the forces which Professor
Carver describes, but through the mighty blows of the work-
ing class bent upon coming into its own.

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

Marx and Engels on the Role of the
Communists in America

By Heinz Neumann

(Continued from the November issue)

IV. The Formation of an Independent
Working-Class Party
S early as July 25, 1877, Marx wrote to Engels:

“What do you think of the workers of the United

States? This first explosion against the associated

oligarchy of capital, which has arisen since the Civil

War, will naturally again be suppressed, but can very

well form THE POINT OF ORIGIN FOR THE CON-

STITUTION OF A N EARNEST WORKERS’

PARTY. The policy of the new president will make

the Negroes, and the great expropriations of land

(exactly the fertile land) in favor of railways, min-

ing, 'etc., companies will make THE PEASANTS OF

THE WEST, who are already very dissatisfied,

ALLIES OF THE WORKERS. So that a nice

sauce is being stirred over there, and the transfer-

ence of the center of the International to the United

States may obtain a very remarkable post festum

opportuneness.”

Marx thus demanded, in consequence of the changes
which had taken place in the United States since the Civil
War, the “constitution of an earnest workers’ party.” In
this connection it is of great importance that he emphasized
the special role of the farmers in view of the agrarian crisis
and of the land expropriation in direct connection with the
formation of the mass party of the proletariat.

A decade later Engels touches upon the same problem
in his letter to S-orge dated November 29, 1886. He clearly
and unmistakably demands that the American socialists
work within the Knights of Labor to arouse the masses.
Despite his designating this order as one of “confused prin-
ciples and a ridiculous organization,” he demands that the
American Marxists “build up within this still wholly plastic
mass a nucleus of persons,” who will have to take over after
the inevitable split of this “Third Party” the leadership of
t-he latter’s proletarian elements:

“To tell the truth, the Germans have not been
able to use their theory as a lever to set the Ameri-
can masses in motion. To a great extent they do not
understand the theory themselves and treat it in a
doctrinaire and dogmatic fashion as if it were some-_
thing which must be committed to memory, but which
then suffices for all purposes without further ado.
FOR THEM IT IS A CREDO, NOT A GUIDE FOR AC-
TION . . . hence the American masses must seek
their own road and APPEAR for the moment to
have found it in the K. of L. whose confused prin-
ciples and ridiculous organization APPEAR to con-
form to their own confusion. However, according to
what I hear, the K. of L. are A REAL POWER in

New England and in the West, and are becoming
more so day by day as a result of the brutal opposi-
tion of the capitalists. I believe that it is necessary
to work within it, TO BUILD UP WITHIN THIS
STILL WHOLLY PLASTIC MASS A NUCLEUS OF
PERSONS, UNDERSTANDING THE MOVEMENT
AND ITS GOALS, AND THUS OF THEMSELVES
TAKE OVER THE GUIDANCE OF AT LEAST A
SECTION IN THE COMING UNAVOIDABLE SPLIT
OF THE PRESENT ‘ORDER.’ . . . The first great
step, which is of primary importance in every coun-
try first entering the movement, is always THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE WORKERS AS AN IN-
DEPENDENT POLITICAL PARTY NO MATTER
OF WHAT KIND, SO LONG AS IT IS ONLY A DIS-
TINCT WORKERS’ PARTY . . . That the first pro-
gram of this Party is still confused and extremely
deﬁcient, that it sets up H. George as its leader,
are unavoidable evils, which, however, are o-nly tem-
porary. The masses must have the opportunity and
the time to develop themselves; and they only have
this opportunity as, soon as they have their own
movement——no matter in what form, if only it be
their own movement——in which they will be driven
forward by their own mistakes and will grow wise
through injury to themselves.”

Engels compares—in 1886—the role of the Marxists in
the American Labor movement with the role which the
“Kommunistenbund” had to play amongst the workers’
societies before 1848. At the same time, however, he points
out the differences in order to avoid the opportunist inter-
pretation of any schematic comparison of the situation of
the American labor movement at that time with “the situa-
tion in Europe prior to 1848:”

“Only that things will now move forward in
America INFINITELY MORE RAPIDLY; that the
movement should have obtained such success in the
elections after only eiht months’ existence is en-
tirely unprecedented. And what is still lacking will
be supplied by the bourgeois; nowhere in the whole
world are they so brazen-faced and tyrannical as
over there ‘. . . Where the battle is fought by the
bourgeoisie with such weapons, the decision arrives
quickly . . ."

In his letter to Mrs. Wischnewetzky dated December 28,
1886, Engels again emphasizes that the American Marxists
should not pooh-pooh the proletarian “Third Party” from
without, but revolutionize» it from within.” He again uses
unminced words in condemning, the German sectarians in
America and their dogma of the “role of the party" which in
reality, then as now, renders impossible for the party to
fulﬁll its role in the proletarian revolution by separating
it from the masses, The remarks made by Engels in this

ence with the American Socialists, they rejected any en-
deavor to set up a mechanical distinction between the
Marxist party and the labor party, as two opposites which
exclude each other. The sectarians in the German S. L.
P., who accused them of “liquidating the leading role of the
Marxist party," were criticized unmercifully by them. More
than that, year after year they pointed out through the
results of the progressing labor movement in America that
the leading role of the Marxist party can be best realized
and can only be realized within the great revolutionary mass
party. Only when the Marxist—-or putting it in modern
phraseology——the Bolshevist party fulﬁlls this task within an
extensive proletarian mass party———a labor party——can the
historically conditioned backwardness of the American move-
ment be overcome by the practical experience‘of the masses
themselves, and can the differences and antagonisms within
the working class be settled. In his letter dated November
29, 1886, Engels formulates the task of the Marxist party,
“to build up within this still wholly plastic mass a nucleus

of.’ persons who understand the movement a.nd its goals” and

87

which later takes over the real leadership of the movement,
as follows:

“But just now it is doubly necessary for us to
have a few people who are thoroughly versed in
THEORY and well-tested TACTICS . . . for the
Americans are for good historical reasons far behind
in all theoretical questions, have taken over no med-
iaeval institutions from Europe, but have taken
masses of mediaeval tradition, English common
(feudal) law, superstition, spiritualism, in short, all
the nonsense which did not directly hurt business and
which is now very useful for stupefying the masses.
And if THEORETICALLY CLEAR FIGHTERS are
available, who can predict for them the consequence
of their own mistakes, who can make clear for them
that every movement, whifl does not incessantly fix
its eye upon the destruction of the wage system
as its final goal must go astray and fail, many mis-
takes can be avoided and the process can be consid-
erably shortened." (Letter to Sorge dated Novem-
ber 29, 1886).

passage on the dialectic-materialist conception of the role

of theory are moreover the direct point of departure from
which Lenin developed his doctrine of the importance of
theory in the proletarian revolution:

‘‘It is far more important that the movement
should spread, proceed harmoniously, take root and
EMBRACE as much as possible THE WHOLE
AMERICAN PROLETARIAT, thanthat it should
start and proceed from the beginning on theoretically
perfectly correct lines. There is no better road to
theoretical clearness of comprehension than to learn
by one’s own mistakes, ‘durch Schaden klug wer-
de-n.’* And for a whole large class, lihere is no other
road, especially for a nation so eminently practical
and" so contemptuous of theory as the Americans.
THE GREAT THING IS TO GET THE WORKING
CLASS TO MOVE AS A CLASS; that once obtained,
they will soon find the right direction, and all who
resist, . . . will be left out in the cold with small
sects of their own. Therefore I think also the K.
of L. a most important factor in the movement
WHICH OUGHT NOT TO BE POOH-POOHED
FROM WITHOUT BUT TO BE REVOLUTIONIZED
FROM WITHIN, and I consider that many of the Ger-
mans then have made a grievous mistake when they
tried, in the face of a mighty and glorious movement
not of their own creation,’ to make of their imported
and not always understoodtheory a kind of allein-
seligmachendes** dogma, and to keep aloof from any
movement, which did not accept that doma. Our
theory is not a dogma but the exposition of a pro-
cess of evolution, and that process involves suc-
cessive phases. To expect that the Americans_will
start with the full consciousness of the theory
worked out in older industrial countries is. to expect
the impossible. What the Germans ought to do is
to act up to their own theory—-if they understand it,
as we did in 1845 and 1848-—to go in for any real
general working class imovement, ACCEPT ITS

b FAKTISCHEN*** STARTING POINT as such and
work it gradually up to the theoretical level by point-
ing out how every mistake made, every reverse suf-
fered, was a necessary consequence of mistaken theo-
retical orders in the original program: they ought,

above all give the movement time to consolidate, do

of capital and wage-labor. But anything that might‘
delay or prevent that NATIONAL CONSOLIDATION
OF TI-lE.WORKINGMEN’S PARTY—on no matter
what platform—I should consider a great mis-
take . . . ”

In another letter to Mrs. Wischnewetzky, Engels speaks
of the necessity of ﬁrst, and most important of all, “gaining
the ear of the working class.” He ‘then develops this idea
as follows:

‘‘I think all our practice has shown that it is pos-
sible to work along with the eneral movement of
the working class AT EVERY ONE OF ITS STAGES
WITHOUT GIVING UP OR HIDING OUR OWN
DISTINCT POSITION AND EVEN ORGANIZATION,
and I am afraid that if the German Americans choose
a different line they will commit a great mistake."
(Letter of January 27, 1887.)

It should be noted that Engels wrote these lines just at
the moment of the disgraceful behavior of the K. of L.
towards the Chicago prisoners. H. George founded at that

time in New York a weekly in which he disavowed the New
York Socialists and refused to do anything in favor of the
anarchists condemned in Chicago. Without hestitating a
moment Engels supported Aveling, the son-in-law of Marx,
who even in this situation bitterly fought the sectarian
tactics of the National Executive of the Socialist Labor
Party.

The viewpoint of Marx and Engels in the question of
the American labor party is thus absolutely clear; they de-
manded of the American Marxists the formation of a national
working-class party in America at any price, without regard
to its program so long as the latter include-d the class strug-
gle, but with the complete maintenance of the political inde-
pendence and the organization of the Marxist nucleus within

the great mass party.

V. The Role of the Marxist Nucleus within the
Working-Class Parry

E have already pointed out that Marx and Engels never
wanted to give up the maintenance of a real Marxist
party of the most class-conscious and progressive elements
of the native and foreign-born in the working class within
the great mass party. For thirty years, in their correspond-

DECEMBER, 1925

outlined the fundamental tactical policy of the American
Marxists: working along with the "general movement of

the working class at every one of its stages without giving.

up or hiding their own political position and organization.

In his letter to Sorge dated February 8, 1890, he denotes -
. as their task “to take over through their superior theoretical

insight and experience the leading role” in the masses, as
events themselves drive the American proletariat forward.
And he adds, in order to reassure Sorge, who fears for the
preservation of the past results of the pure Marxist party:

“You will then see that your work of years has
not been in vain."

Although Engels time and again points out that the
working class can only learn from its own experiences, he
is far from becoming a worshipper of spontaneity. In the
same letter, he tells the American Marxists in connection
with the successes -of the miners’ movement in 1890 in
Germany:

“Facts must hammer it into people’s, heads and
then things move faster, MOST RAPIDLY OF
COURSE, WHERE THERE ALREADY IS AN OR-
GANIZED AND THEORETICALLY TRAINED SEC-
TION OF THE PROLETARIAT . . . ”

Finally, taking up the speciﬁc conditions in America, he
fore-sees that in the great labor party, principally composed
of nativeworkers, “the foreign element in the nation will
make its inﬂuence felt through its greater mobility.” This
foreign element, however, comprised and comprises of ne-
cessityuin America the majority of the pure Marxist party.
It is just the Communists’ conﬁning themselves to the ranks
of their own supporters and those who are already in. whole-
hearted sympathy with them, it is just the renunciation of
the formation of a mass party which leads to the spontaneity
theory. to “Khvostism,” to the hindrance of the Communist
task of taking over the leadership of the entire class in the
revolution.

VI. The Role of the Farmers

N his letter of July 25, 1877, Marx predicted the role of the

farmers, who are being revolutionized in consequence of
the agrarian crisis and their expropriation through big busi-
ness, as that of the allies of the working class. He desig-
nated the revoluti-onization of the farmers as well as the
beginning of the Negroes’ awakening “to favorable circum-
stances” for the “constitution of an earnest Workers’ party.”
On the other hand Engels proves in his letter to Sorge dated
January 6, 1892, that the American farmers as a class have
not the strength for the formation of an independent political
party.
party in America must of necessity make this party the play-

Every endeavor to form an independent farmers’
thing of petty bourgeois political speculators and conse-
quently an appendage of the tWo Capitalist Parties:

“The small farmers and petty bourgeoisie will
scarcely ever be able to form a strong party. They
are composed of too rapidly changing eIem_ents,—the

‘farmer is often a wandering farmer, who cultivates
two, three or four farms in different states and terri-

89

tories one after the other; immigration and bank-
ruptcy promote the change of personnel in both; eco-
nomic dependence upon creditors also hinders ‘inde-
pendence—but to make up for that they are excellent
material for politicians, who speculate with their dis-
satisfaction in order to sell them later to one of the

big parties.”

The oppression of farmers by immigration has mean-
while disappeared, but to compensate for that, bankruptcies
have multiplied. Under any circumstances, the fact remains
that the working farmers in America can never defend their
class interests against ﬁnance capital through an independ-
ent party. They can only ﬁght the bourgeosie and its big
parties under the leadership of a mass party of the American
workers, which in turn is led by a Marxist party.

VII. The Modern Development of America

N the third preface to the Communist Manifesto, written
in 1883, Engels pointed out the change in America's posi-
tion in the capitalist world. Marx and Engels often spoke
in the last few years of their lives of the preponderating
participation of the United States in the ﬁght for breaking
British industrial monopoly. In one passage of his corre-
spondence, which has received altogether too little attention,
Engels speaks directly of the possibility of an American
monopoly, of the coming domination of American capitalism
over the whole world. In his letter to ‘Sorge dated January
7, 1888, he speaks of the danger of the European war which
Bismarck threatened to bring about. “Ten to ﬁfteen million
combatants” would take part. “There would be devastation,
similar to that in the Thirty Years’ War.”

‘‘If the war would be fought to afinish without
inner movements, a state of exhaustion would result
such as Europe has not experienced for two-hundred
years. AMERICAN INDUSTRY WOULD THEN
WIN ALL ALONG THE LINE AND WOULD SET
US ALL BEFORE THE ALTERNATIVE: either
a relapse to pure agriculture for our own needs
(American grain forbids any other kind), or—SO-
CIAL TRANSFORMATION.”

Engels thus foresees the imperialist World War and the
resulting world monopoly of American imperialism. His pre-
diction that under these circumstances Europe would relapse
into pure agriculture has not been literally fulﬁlled. Its
place has been taken by the speciﬁcally imperialist method
of pillaging and subjugating old European industrial coun-
tries through the loans and investments of the Dawes sys-
tem. The historical perspective sketched by Engels, how-
ever, remains unchanged; the monopoly’ of American ﬁnance
capital is not to be compar-ed with the former monopoly of
British industrial capital. It cannot maintain itself for a
long period of time; it is no monopoly in the true sense of
the word. It must break down in consequence of the unequal
development of the various imperialist powers, of the compe-
tition of British ﬁnance capital, and principally as a result
of the rebellion of the working masses in Europe and the

90

colonies. In the words of Engels, it sets “us all before the

-alternative” of the proletarian revolution.

Even more clearly than the development of American
imperialism did Engels foresee the future course of the
American labor movement. He knew that the progress of
capitalist production must unavoidably lead to the revolution-
ization of the American labor movement:

“As for those nice Americans who think their
country exempt from the consequences of fully ex-
panded capitalist production, they seem to live in
blissful ignorance of the fact that sundry states,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
etc., have such an institution as a Labor Bureau,
from the reports of which they might learn some-
thing to the contrary.” I

Engels sees the difficulties in the path of development
of the revolutionary labor movement. After the defeat of
the Knights o-f Labor movement, he writes to Sorge on
October 24, 1891, as follow.s:

“| readily believe that the movement is again at
a low ebb. With you everything happens with great
ups and downs. But each up wins definite terrain
and thus one does go forward. Thus for instance,
the tremendous wave of the Knights of Labor and
the strike Fnovement from 1886 to 1888, despite all
defeats, did bring us forward. There is an altogether
different spirit in the masses than before. The next
time even more ground will be won. But with all
that, the standard of living of the native American
working man is considerably higher than that of the
British and that alone is sufficient to allot him "a
back seat for some time to come; added to that im-
migration competition and other things. When the
point is reached, things will move forward over there
with colossal rapidity and energy» but until then
some time may have to elapse.”

The chief obstacles, the high standard of living of the
majority of native workers and the competition caused by
the incessant stream of immigrants have been eliminated
to a certain degree. The World War brought with it the
increase of wage-s of all unskilled workers in America. The
economic crisis after the war led to radical reductions of
wages not only among the for-eign-born, but in even greater
degree among the native workers. The competition of for-
eign workers has been considerably reduced by the restric-
tions upon immigration. , .

Another obstacle, the diversion of the workers from the
class struggles by the hope of obtaining land, has for the
most part been removed by the disappearance of the possi-
bilities of free settlement. There exists “a generation of
native-born workers who have nothing more to expect from
speculation: "

“Land is the basis of speculation, and the Amer-
lcan possibility of and craze for speculation is the
chief inﬂuence holding the native-born workers under
the influence of the bourgeoisie. Only when we have i
a generation of native-born workers, who have noth-
ing more to expect from speculation, will we have
firm ground under our feet in'America.” (Letter to
Sorge dated January 6, 1892).

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

Engels time and again emphasized that the revolution-
ization of the American labor movement, which he foresaw as
unavoidable, would begin under tremendous diﬂiculties and
would experience incessant ups and downs, but would then
develop “with colossal rapidity and energy.” His letter to
Schlueter dated March 30, 1892, concludes with the sentence:

“When the Americans once begin, they will do
so with an energy and virulence, in comparison with
which we in Europe _will be children."

VIII. The International Role of the
American Labor Movement

N his letter to Mrs. Wischnewetzky dated June 3, 1886,
Engels writes:
“. . . one thing is certain: the American work-
lng class is moving, and no mistake. And after a
few false starts, they will get into the right track
soon enough. This appearance of the Americans
upon the scene I consider ONE OF THE GREATEST
EVENTS OF THE YEAR.

“What the breakdown of RUSSIAN CZARISM
would be for the great military monarchs of Europe
——THE SNAPPING OF FHEIR‘ MAlNSTAY——that
is for the boureoisie of the whole world THE
BREAKING OUT OF CLASS WAR in America.
For America after all was the ideal of all the bour-
eoisie: a country rich, vast, expanding, with purely
bourgeois Institutions unleavened by feudal rem-
nants or monarchical traditions and without a perma-
nent and hereditary proletariat. Here every one could
become, if not a capitalist, at all events an independ-
ent man, producing or trading, with his own means,
for his own account. And because there were not,
as yet, classes with opposing interests, our—and
your--bourgeois thought that America stood above
class antagonisms-and struggles. That delusion has
now broken down, the last bourgeois Paradise on
earth is fast changing into a Purgatorio, and can only
be prevented from becoming like Europe an Inferno
by the go-ahead pace at which the development of
the newly-fledged proletariat of America will take
place."

This analysis of the international signiﬁcance of the pro-
letarian class struggle in America holds true even today,
stronger and more vital than ever. There already exists in
America a “standing hereditary proletariat.” The illusion

of the bourgeois paradise has already been dissipated. The

outbreak of the class war in America, its leadership by a
revolutionary mass party, at the head of which the American
Communists will place themselves, and the inception of
revolutionary mass struggles in America would in reality sig-
nify the “snapping of the mainstay” of imperialism through-
out the world. *

THE END.

DECEMBER, 1925

§ Class War for Class Collaboration?
By Max Bedacht

“Without a revolutionary theory there can be no
revolutionary movement.”—Lenin.

EARLY 160.000 anthracite miners are on strike. All ob-

servers agree that up to the present the strike zone is
extremely peaceful and that the whole affair looks more like
a vacation of the workers than like a strikey What is at
the bottom of this phenomenon? Is it because there is
really such a thing as a peaceful strike?

What is the origin of a disturbance of the peace in a
strike?

A strike is a battle between workers of a shop, an indus-
try or a territory, and the owners and operators of such
shops or industries. It is a battle in the economic war be-
tween workers and capitalists.

If this is correct—and no one has ever disputed it——
then rules of war must apply to the conduct of such battles.
Workers or organizations of workers engaged in such battle,
a strike, must bring into play ‘all forces at their command.
Victory can be the fruit‘only of- a supreme effort.

If the workers in a strike bring all their forces into
play, then the proﬁt-mills of the bosses stand still. Not
only do the wheels of the shops and industries stop turn-
ing, but also the stream of proﬁts stops ﬂowing into the
coffers of the bosses.

In this emergency the bosses use all means at their dis-
posal to remove the cause of this stoppage, to break the
strike. Strikebreakers are hired and imported. The state
power is mobilized. This state power appears as police,
trying to club the workers back into the shops; it marches
as militia or federal troops trying to intimidate and, if
need be, shoot the workers back to work; it operates as
injunction judges, outlawing picketing and even striking;
it functions as judges jailing workers. The whole machinery
of government which is ostensibly established to maintain
peace in the state, is used to break the peace of the strike
and to give it its real character, that of war. The bosses
never fail to mobilize their forces. If a strike, in spite of
that, remains peaceful, it is due to the failure of the workers
to mobilize their forces. A one-sided battle is the result.
But a one-sided war is no war. It is merely suppression of
the passive side by the active.

_ Strike “Leaders” Smash Strikes.
The ofﬁcial bureaucracy of the United Mine Workers,

like the oﬂicial bureaucracy of the A. F. of L., adheres to_

the principle of identity of interests of labor and capital.
This creates a paradoxial situation. The tactic of strike is
in direct contradiction to the theory of identity of interests
of the classes. And the inﬂuence of this latter theory, on
the actual strike measures, is, as a rule, disastrous. In
other words: the theory of identity of interests of capital
and labor is smashed by the strikes and the strikes are often
smashed because of the attempts to apply this class peace
theory in the class war. -

The basic principle of a militant labor union must be
that the workers organized in it ascertain their needs and

formulate their demands, and then fight to force the bosses
to grant these needs and to concede their demands. There
are only two sides to such a fiht: The side of the workers
and the side of the bosses.

This, however, is not the concept of the bureaucrats of
the A. F. of L. and of Lewis. To these labor “leaders” the
workers are not actors in this contest, but are merely pawns
in the game. To the oﬂicialdom, the actors are the bosses
on the one hand and the bureaucrats on the other.

The principle of class peace makes the conservative
trade union leader dread a strike as much as the bosses-
and even more. And when the strike becomes inevitable
then he conducts it, but not with a view to injuring the
enemy as much as possible and thus bringing him to terms.
On the contrary, the principle followed is that of injuring
the enemy as little as possible. The strike leaders do not
try to force the bosses down on their knees by leading into
battle the full force of the army of the struggling workers.
Instead they try to get concessions from the bosses by
showing how useful they can ‘be to them by restraining the
strike. Instead of acting as agents and plenipotentiaries of
the striking workers to the -bosses, they actually represent
the bosses to the workers.

This is the theoretical basis of class collaboration. The
very idea of identity of interests between the classes must
inevitably lead to class collaboration. And that is what the
oiﬁcial policy of the average conservative trade union lead-
ers amount to——co1laboration with the bosses in order to
prevent the workers from fighting.

Struggle Develops Strength, So Lackeys Renounce Struggle.

There is method in this madness. Struggle develops
strength and, what is more dangerous, it develops the con-
sciousness of strength. The pro-capitalist trade union lead-
ers are well aware of this. And as good lackeys of capital-
ism, they cannot aid in strengthening the working class and
in developing any consciousness of strength among the
workers.

The present strike of the anthracite miners is a glaring
example of these theories and practices of the pro-capitalist
leadership of John L. Lewis.

There are a number of outstanding facts in connection
with this strike that show with irrefutable clearness that the
strike leadership takes much better care of the interests of
the bosses than of the interests of the strikers.

As shown in the article by Comrade Gitlow in last
month's issue or the Workers’ Monthly, the issue in the strike
of the anthracite miners is the obtaining of decent working
conditions and wages in an industry which produces fabu-
lous proﬁts for the operators. The workers are entitled to
decent conditions, and the operators are more than able to
concede them. But the operators do not concede anything
and the workers must ﬁght. The miners have no resources.
To them a long ﬁght means hardships which weaken any
army,

The bosses, on the other hand, are as a rule, better pre-
pared to stand the effects of a long strike. The war funds

of their national associations are at their disposal. Their
subsistence does not depend upon the immediate labor of
their workers, while the workers .always depend upon the
immediate proceeds of their labor. And, on top of that, the
bosses have it in their power to prepare much more effective-
ly for the strike than the workers. Intensive production for
the period immediately preceding the strike enables them to
store goods for the market during the strike. The strike
affords an opportunity to stimulate the market price ()f such
goods so that, for a time, the strike may even increase the
proﬁts of the capitalists instead of stopping them.

Such is the case with the anthracite mine operators.
They have large quantities of anthracite on hand and as long
as this reserve lasts every additional strike day makes the
price of this" stored coal soar higher.

In addition to this the operators have on hand the culm
bank coal. As long as the supply lasts every additional
strike day improves the market for this dust and dirt, and—
increases proﬁts. Besides, every additional strike day weak-
ens the -striking masses and improves the chances of a
settlement favorable to the bosses. When the bosses get

ready to talk with the strikers about settlement then the
workers are already exhausted and the chances of the bosses
to bring the workers to terms are so much greater.

Lewis Serves Bosses in Strilke.

The leadership of a s-trike must be judged by the services
that leadership renders the strike. Any judgment based. on
the services rendered by John L. Lewis, the president of the
United Mine Workers, to the anthracite strikers must bring
us to the conclusion that Lewis is serving not the strikers,
but the bosses.

The most vulnerable spot of the mine operators is their
property. The miners have it in their power to stop not
only the proﬁts by ceasing to w-ork, but also to cause the
capital to deteriorate and even partially to destroy it. All
they have to do is to walk out of the mines 100 per cent.
Water will do the rest. Underground water is the ally of
the Workers. But instead. of mobilizing this ally, Lewis
mobilizes regiments ‘of the strikers to ﬁght this ally in the
interests of the bosses. Lewis has not to this day mobilized
all the forces of the union in the strike. About 10,000 main-
tenance men are at work protecting the property of the

DECEMBER, 1925

bosses against damages. Why does Lewis not take out his
men? Because Lewis wants to show his capitalist soundness
t0 the b03595 by agreeing to protect their property. But in
doing so, -he shows his proletarian unsoundness, by not pro-
tecting the interests of the ﬁghting workers,
Protect Bosses’ Property, Betray Strikers.

The protection of the property of the bosses turns in this
case automatically into a betrayal of the interests of the
strikers. It prolongs the -strike. It weakens the workers.
It robs the workers of a chance to inﬂict a serious blow on
the enemy in battle.

The miners must attempt to mobilize for the strike all
the working forces that make possible the loading and trans-
portation of the anthracite on hand. They must try to make
impossible the washing and utilizing of the culm banks.

, Lewis has to this day done absolutely nothing to prevent

the operators from loading and shipping their stores of an-
thracite and from capitalizing the strike by washing and
loading culm bank coal. By acquiescing in and making pos-
sible this practice of the operators, Lewis protects the prop-
erty interests of the operators and automatically betrays the
interests of the strikers. .
Bituminous coal is being used during the strike in place
of anthracite wherever technically possible. This means that

93

one part of the union, the miners in the bituminous ﬁelds.
is thus exploited against the other part of the union, the
strikers in the anthracite ﬁeld. Lewis has done nothing to
mobilize the whole union in support of the strike. Contracts
prevent him, he says. But these contracts are at this mo-
ment in the interests of the bosses and against those of the
strikers. The protection of the ,Qontracts at this moment is
a protection of the interests of the mine operators and a
betrayal of the strikers.

Every measure of war that the union fails to use against
the operators. turns into a measure of war taken for the
operators against the union.

If this were only the result of ignorance there would be
hope of overcoming that because experience is an inexorable
teacher. But experience can teach Lewis nothing. He is a
class collaborationist. He believes in t-he identity of interests
of capital and labor. He practices this theoryeven in times
of war between the two groups. Thus he becomes the con-
scious and persistent agent of the operators,

But the masses of the -strikers must listen to their
teacher, -to experience. If they do, they will shelve the
theory of identity of interests of capital and labor. And
along with this false the-ory, they will also shelve their false
class collaborationist leaders.

History of the Russian Communist Party
I By Gregory Zinoviev

(Oo4zti~nu~ed from the November issue.)

The>Third Congress of the Bolsheviks in London and the
First Congress of the Mensheviks in Geneva.

N the summer of 1905 took place the Third Congress of
the party, which, as has already been said, may, in a cer-
tain sense, be looked upon as the ﬁrst Bolshevik, congress,
since they alone took part in it. The Mensheviks, who had
the seal of the Central Committee in their right pocket, and

that of the Party Council in their left, claimed that there was
no need for a congress,‘ seeing that party control was com-
pletely in their hands. Consequently, the Bolsheviks were
forced to call a new congress themselves, in order to extricate
themselves from this situation. The Mensheviks were, how-
ever, so determined in their opposition that we were com-

-pelled to convene it in deﬁance of the Central Committee.

The congress was thus convened by the Bureau of the Com-
mittee of the Majority, and held abroad, in London, in the
middle of 1905. At the same time the Mensheviks convened
their “First All-Russia Conference,” as they called it, in
Geneva. Thus, in the summer of 1905, only a short time be-
fore the revolution, a review of forces was he1d——of the Bol-
sheviks, at their Third Congress in London, and of the Men-
sheviks, at the “First All-Russia Conference,” in Geneva. At
these two congresses both sides worked out-——each for itself-
a detailed tactic to be applied to the revolution of 1905, for
everyone felt that any day decisive events might commence.

The Third Congress possesses a tremendous signiﬁcance.
Its chief contribution consists in the fact that for the ﬁrst

time it presented the idea of the general srtike in conjunction
with armed insurrection, embodying it in a deﬁnite program.
Today, this, as so many other things, seems nothing out of
the ordinary, but at that time it was an entirely novel con-
cept. Let us turn for a while to the question of the general
strike.
The Question of the General Strike.

Int-ernational social-democracy, as represented by the
Second International, completely rejected the above idea. A
saying of the late Auer, the noted opportunist leader of the
German party, was then going the rounds——“The General
Strike is General Nonsense.” Why? Because, he said, if
we should really be able to carry through the general strike
in such fashion that all the workers would quit work as one
man, then we should be capable of accomplishing the revolu-
tion as well. But if we are such a powerful force, we have
no need of the general strike. If on the other hand, we can-
not do this, then it means that we are also incapable of car-
rying through the general strike.
duction: the general strike is a general absurdity. The
Mensheviks agreed with the views of the Second Interna-
tional on this question. It is true that at that time the general
strike did seem a remote issue: it was a. period of such tran-
quility in Western Europe that a small strike that arose in
Belgium over the question of the right of suffrage, lasting in
all two days, came as a tremendous occurrence; and it was
made the object of a large amount of research, including an
examination by Rosa Luxemburg.

In view of the attitude adopted by the Second Interna-
tional and the Mensheviks on the question of the general

Hence Auer drew the de-

94

strike, the Third Congress rendered a great service to the
revolutionary movement by advancing their conception of the
general strike, and by maintaining that the general strike was
not absurd, that it was already on the order of the day in
Russia, and that we meant to assume conduct of it.

The Question of Armed Insurrection.

Even sharper were the...differences on the question of
armed insurrection. The Second International would not
even hear of it, declaring it to be anarchy, and quoting from
the introduction to “The Civil War in France” which Engels
wrote in the ’nineties. In this introduction Engels, pointing
to the furious rate of development of military technique in
bourgeois armies, and to the reconstruction of the streets in
large cities which has rendered them too wide to permit of
barricade ﬁghting, comes to the conclusion that under these
circumstances armed insurrection becomes an exceedingly
diﬂicult affair, so that the bourgeoisie would be able to de-
stroy any such movement within the space of a few hours.
All the opportunists seized upon this introduction avidly, with
one voice declaring that armed insurrection was impossible,
and that this was “proved by Engels,” completely ignoring the
fact that in Russia other_conditions obtained, and that im-
perialist wars might create other conditions in the armies
themselves, even in Western Europe.

Again in this connection the Third Congress of our party
performed a great service for the revolutionary movement,
by stating that it placed the question of armed insurrection
upon the order of the day, that it was possible, and that the
opportunists had misrepresented Eng-els.

It not only advanced each of these ideas separately but
also presented them in synthesis, i. e., the union of the
armed insurrection with the general strike, as though with
prophetic vision foreseeing the events of 1905, and then, of
1917. ‘ ’

The Services of the Third Congress.

Thus the Third Congress laid an indestructible founda-
tion for Bolshevik tactics, and outlined a deﬁnite program
for the approaching revolution. It must not be forgotten
that the sessions of this congress were held only two or three
months before the decisive events of 1905, and that the de-
cisions it arrived at constituted for revolutionary parties the

‘ world over an example -of how revolutionary Marxist ideology

can, when linked up with the mass movement of the workers,
foresee the path of revolution. Reading through the resolu-
tions of the Third Congress today, it can be said that laying
its ear to the ground and listening to the reverberation of
events in Russia, it foretold the further course. of the revolu-
tion on the basis of Marxian analysis.

The Question of the Arming of the Workers.

In the meantime the Mensheviks had completed and put
the ﬁnishing touches to the opportunist program. At their
All-Russia Conference they advanced an entirely new idea-
the theory of the so-called “revolutionary self-government."
They were preparing for participation in the Bulygin.Duma,
dealing with every question on the order of the day in the
same opportunist manner. The question of the arming of the
workers, which the Third Congress of our party brought for-
ward with immense force and energy, will serve as an excel-
lent illustration of the Menshevist approach. Today the
arming of the workers appears to us, as also to many others,
an elementary question. But at that time, during the years
of the peaceful growth of the Second International, when

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

Kautsky and his friends feared a gun like ﬁre, to many people
the arming of the workers appeared in the light of an insane
nightmare of revolt. And when the Third Congress of our
party posed this question sharply, the Mensheviks at their
All-Russia Conference raised the cry that it was unheard-of
anarchy, it was murder! We mu'st arm the workers, they
said, not with weapons, but ﬁrst “with the burning conscious-
ness of the necessity for being armed.” To this Bolshe-
vism gave an excellent reply: You look upon the Russian
workers as little children, you wish to “arm them with con-
sciousness,” but the time for that is already past. They are
conscious already, what they need now is to be armed with
riﬂes, that they may shatter the Czar and the bourgeoisie.

Herein can be seen the gulf that divided us from the
Mensheviks. On the one side the militant workers’ battal-
ions, on the other, shilly-shallying talk about revolutionary
autonomy——i. e., about improving the zemstvos and city
Dumas, and participation in the Bulygin Duma.

The Shidlovsky Commission.

After the events of the Ninth of January, the Czarist au-
tocracy‘ recognized the necessity of making certain conces-
sions to the workers, and with this end in View established
the Shidlovsky Commission, which many Petersburg workers
will surely remember. As chairman of the commission, the
Czar appointed Senator Shidlovsky, and proposed_ to the work-
ers that they send their representatives for joint considera-
tion of matters relating to certain improvements in the con-
ditions of the workers, in the spirit of the demands put for-
ward by Gapon. It goes without saying, of course, that this
commission did not meddle with any basic political questions,
conﬁning itself exclusively to triﬂes. Of course we made use
of the commission, as of every legal possibility that oﬁered,
but the Menshevkis built a whole philosophy on this founda-
tion, and buzzed around the commission like ﬂies around
sugar.

The Bulyin Duma.

Later, when the workers’ movement had reached a fur-
ther stage, when the Union of Unions had been organized and
the movement was growing stronger among the peasants,
when those tendencies which later led to the mutiny on the
ﬂagship “Potemkin Tavritchisky” had begun to ripen——then
the Czarist autocracy began to give thought to the more
urgent “reforms,” and decided upon the creation of the Duma
which received the name of the “Bulygin Duma.” The pre-
paration for this undertaking, that is, the working out of a
suitable electoral law was assigned by the Czar to Bulygin.
The intention of the Czarist clique was to convene a State
Duma of such a character that it would possess no real
rights, but would be an advisory organ alone, bringing its
suggestions to the “gracious attention” of the monarch, by
whom all questions would be decided. Accordingly, the elect-
oral laws presented by Bulygin allowed the workers prac-
tically no rights at all, while it granted full rights to the
nobility and the bourgeoisie.

When the nature of the Bulygin Duma became suﬂiciently
clear, the question arose as to what attitude should be adopt-
ed towards it. The Bolsheviks declared their intention of ab-
staining from any part in this Duma, of boycotting it, and of
mobilizing the masses for its destruction. We felt that the
movement that was developing was of exceptional power,
that the Czarist autocracy would win over no one with the

DECEMBER, 1925

sops it was ﬂinging to the people, that they must be wrested
from its clutches, to go forward with the offensive against
Czarism. The Mensheviks, as was to have beenexpected,
saw in the Czarist scheme the beginnings of parliamentarism
in Russia, and at first declared for participation in the Duma.
When they were ridiculed for this stand, however, they with-
drew from participation, declaring that under the circum-
stances they would call electoral assemblies, and elect their
own candidates, not to the Duma, but to the organs of revo-
lutionary self-government. But then this plan, too, was let
fall, the revolution sweeping on to the next point on the order
of the day, beyond Bulygin and his Duma, and the Menshe-
vik plan of “revolutionary self-government.” The workers
said: it is not child’s-play we mean to go in for; serious
times are coming, the smell of powder is in the air, the real
revolution is near; what is the sense in voting for a Duma
which the Czarist autocracy is trying to thrust upon us?

The October Events of the Year 1905.

The October events of the year 1905 were enacted under
the following circumstances: strikes throughout the whole of
Russia, energetic activity on the part of the “Union of,
Unions,” the granting of various concessions by the autoc-
racy on October 17, and ﬁnally, the -Constitution. A detailed
account of what went on behind the scenes in connection
with the granting of the constitution can be found in the
memoirs of Witte, in whose book all sides of the play of
passions, of parties and court intrigues are illuminated.

This was also the time of the birth of the ﬁrst Peters-
burg Soviet of Workers’ Deputies. I purposely say the Soviet
of Workers’ Deputies, and not the Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies. This is extremely important, for it was
in this precisely that its 'chief weakness lay. The Bolsheviks
said: if we are to be a power, we must have Soviets com-
posed not of workers alone, but also of soldiers’ and peasants’
deputies. This, however, we did not succeed in putting
through, for the movement was as yet too weak.

The idea of the Soviets, like all great ideas, was born
among the masses. The Mensheviks later claimed that the
Soviet idea was the incarnation of their castrated idea of
revolutionary self-government. But the Soviet idea was as
distant from them as the stars. It was not the Mensheviks
who originated the Soviet idea. It was born among the
masses, deep in their midst, in the shops and factories of
Petersburg. The Petersburg Soviet was the embryo of a
government, and thus the following situation obtained: either
the Soviet would take power, and drive out the Czarist gov-
ernment, or the government would drive out the Soviet. As
you know, it was -the latter that to-ok place. A part of the Bol-
sheviks had committed the error of demanding that the Soviet
ad-opt oﬁicially the program of the Social-Democratic party.
But Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee. speedily
rectiﬁed this great mistake. '

The December (1905) Armed Insurrection in Moscow.

The culminating point of the movement was the Decem-
ber Moscow insurrection in the Presnya district. The direct-
ing and organizing role was in the hands of the Bolsheviks,
of a committee headed by Schanzer (Marat) who died abroad
in 1911; Vladimirsky, the present Assistant Commissar of

, Internal Affairs; Sedoy, a party member who is living today,

and several other comrades. This committee organized the

first ﬁghting workers’ militia.

95

The Moscow armed insurrection, which possesses a tre-‘

mendous historical signiﬁcance, was defeated, and drowned
in the blood of the workers. And immediately it was over
even the best among the Mensheviks——~Plekhanov for one——
hastened to disown it. Plekhanov made the cold, soulless, al-
most traitorous comment: “They should not have taken up
arms.” And we answered: whether the movement was
mistaken or no, such words could come only from the pen of
a person who was hostile to the working class. When in 1871
the Paris Communards suﬁered defeat, Marx, who had warned
the Paris workers against the insurrection, did not tell them
that they should not have taken up arms; instead he wrote
that brilliant work, “The Civil War in France,” in which he
immortalized the great work of the Paris Communards in a
book which is the masterpiece of Marxian publicist litera-
ture. Plekhanov, in common with a number of others, did not
follow the path laid out by Marx. Together with other “gentle-
men revolutionists” he held aloof, like a star-gazer, judging
the movement only from an abstract standpoint——“They
should not have taken up arms.” N _

The Bolsheviks followed "a different course. Comrade
Lenin took an exceedingly ﬁne attitude toward this uprising.
His ﬁrst slogan was: study everything, even the smallest
episode of this struggle, the technique of combat, the past
history of the various participants. Lenin was not one of
those “revo1utionists” who identify themselves with victor-
ious uprisings along (and there are enough of this stamp);
even those revolts of our class that were crushed were dear
to him. There are defeats which are worth more than vic-
tori-es, and the December, 1905, defeat was one of them. It
was the ﬁrst revolt of the advanced workers carried on un-
der our party slogans, when they already knew what they
wanted, and no longer followed the banner of Gapon. This
last fact alone shows that the movement had attained a new
level, that the workers had grown to a mighty independent
force, that they had a clear program and were penetrated by
the desire of challenging the Czarist army, armed as it was to
the teeth. True, the movement did not prevail——-we had made
no contract with victory. This the workers usually attain
only through a series of defeats. This, then, is why the B01-
sheviks signiﬁed their full solidarity with the insurrection,
and declared a decisive struggle against Plekhanov for his
renegade phrase: “They should not have taken up arms.”

1905~The Rehearsal for 1917

By Alexander Trachtenberg

AST month the revolutionary workers throughout the
world celebrated the Eighth Anniversary of the vic-
torious proletarian revolution in Russia. Once more workers
everywhere gathered to review the year’s achievements and
to renew pledge-s of solidarity with the proletarian and peasant
masses of the Soviet Union,

This mo_nth two other Russian anniversaries will com-
mand the attention of all revolutionists. Both events, which
the Russian worker will celebrate, are recorded in the annals
of their revolu-tionary history, one as an episode, the other
as an epoch.

The Decembrist Revolt.

The ﬁrst event was the attempt to de-throne Czar Nich-
olas I. on December 14, 1825. The plot was engineered by
some Guard officers a11d civilians who, inﬂuenced by the
ideas of the French Revolution, sought to limit the powers
of the Crown through a constitution. The movement was
restricted to a few conspirators who were not anxious to
establish contact with the masses. Even the soldiers whom
the rebellious -oﬂicers intended to use for the coup were kept
in ignorance of their aims and programs, lest these peasant
soldiers develop ideas inimical to the interests of the land-
owning classes to which the conspirators belonged. Nich-
olas defeated the rebels because on the day of the “uprising”
they were still not agreed upon their aims and methods, and
because of their failure to organize a popular movement in
support of their program.

Viewed from present-day standards, the events of Decem- »

ber 14, 1825, may appear only as a revolutionary ﬂare. At
the time, the shooting down of the soldiers whom the rebel-
lious officers brought to the Senate Square in Petersburg to
demonstrate against Nicholas, the execution of the leading
conspirators and the ﬁendish reprisa-ls of the Czar against all
suspected of harboring disloyalty, produced a marked effect.
The revolutionary ideas which the “Decembris-ts” kept to
themselves became the heritage of larger groups who came
to consider the executed or imprisoned rebels as martyrs.
Celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the Decembrist
revolt, the Russian workers will draw the proper lesson from
the failure of that historic event.

1905-—A Revolutionary Epoch.

The second occasion for reminiscence is of much larger
proportions. It was not an event of a day; it was a series

of events which are recorded in red letters throughout the
calendar of that year. Until eight years ago, 1905 stood out
pre-eminently as an epoch-making year in the history of revo-
lutions. In the nineteenth century only 1848 and 1871 could
compare in revolutionary signiﬁcance with 1905. The rev-
olution of 1905 was not only the rehearsal for 1917, but it
hadaffected the political destinies of many peoples. The
popular movements for wider suffrage in Austria and Bel-
gium; the revolutions of Persia, Turkey and China, were
some of the outstanding events which took place during the
revolutionary era inaugurated in 1905.

The Background of 1905.

Nineteen hundred and ﬁve was the cumulative effect of
sporadic and isolated revolutionary ‘outbreaks of preceding
years, particularly those beginning with 1900. The landless
and poor peasants who were suffering on account of -the
transition from the feudal to the capitalist methods in agri-
culture and were groaning under heavy tax burdens, were
rising against the landlords, setting ﬁre to estates and ex-
propriating agricultural products and machinery. Between
1900 and 1905, nearly seven hundred outbreaks bccurred in
different parts of the country, which brought punitive mili-
tary expeditions to the villages and helped further to widen
the breach between the peasantry and czarism.

The sporadic strike movements in the cities were af-
fecting more and more workers. Long hours (twelve to
fourteen); low wages (six to eight dollars a. month); intol-
erable conditions of employment, mistreatment by foremen,
prohibition of labor unions, drove the workers to resort to
strikes, which, however, were usually broken with the aid of
the police and Cossacks. It is estimated that during the ﬁve
years prior to 1905, over 200,000 industrial workers were
affected in these strikes. The socialists, -though as Yet small
in numbers and only beginning to gain a foothold among
the masses, were utilizing the strikes and the government
interference in behalf of the employers in the attempt to
turn the economic outbreaks into political demonstrations
against the government.

The Police Unions.

To cope with the growing influence of -the Socialists
among the workers the government decided to permit the
formation of beneﬁt organizations and even promised to
intercede in their behalf with employers in order to reduce

STATE AND REVOLUTION

One of the most widely known of the works of Le-
nin. Written just before the Bolshevik revolution, it
is a Marxian analysis of the capitalist state “the
armed protector of Capitalism”, and a lesson in the
revolutionary necessity of the establishment of the

workers’ state, “the Dictatorship of the Proletai-iat”.’

during the period of transition from Capitalism to
Communism. State and Revolution is the final re-
futation of the nonsense spread by right socialists.
anarchists, pacifists and syndicalists regarding the
state. The book contains some of the most import-
ant Communist theory which must be read and 11n-
derstood by every Communist.

IMPERIALISIVI, THE FINAL STAGE OF
CAPITALISM. By Nicolai Lenin

One of Lenin’s monumental contributions to poli-
tical economy. It is this ﬁnal stage of capitalism
that finds its expression in a world struggle for the
monopolistic control of markets, to capitalist ini-
perialism, which brought about the world war and
which must inevitably bring further wars until capi-
talism has been dethroned and the Working class lias
established itself as the ruling power.

“A monthly allowance,———be it
ever so small, means more to men

another big item to them."

THE WORKERS MONTHLY

BLOODY SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.

The priest Gapon leads the masses to their slaughter on the square before the Winter Palace.

somewhat the working day, raise their wages a bit, and
remove some of the objectionable working conditions.
These organizations, in fact, were formed under the aegis
of the government, and are known in Russian labor history
as Police Unions. '

These “labor unions” were to be the Russian counterpart
of the classless unions existing in other West-European
countries—namely the Hirsh-Dunker unions of Germany;
the Catholic unions of Austria and Belgium, and similar de-
revolutionized labor organizations. Instead of yellow unions,
as they are known in other countries, the czarist govern-
ment was going to have -them altogether black. Mussolini
took a leaf out of Russian history when he formed his fas-
cist labor unions. This, however, is not the only resem-
blance that his regime bears to the czarist order of old
Russia.

Zubavtov, the chief of the secret police in Moscow, be-
came the organizer of such unions, in which. he succeeded in
enrolling large numbers of workers. Siding with the work-

ers on a few occasions in their conﬂict with the employers,
Zubatov gained an inﬂuence and for a time proved the effici-
ency of unions organized under government patronage. Dur-
ing the celebration at the monument of Alexander II. in
1902, Zubatov was able -to corral about 50,000 workers.

Under Zubatov’s tutelage, similar “labor unions” were
organized among" the workers of Odessa and Minsk, where
renegade Socialists became the willing aides of the Moscow
chief spy. Zubatov was particularly anxious to win the
Jewish workers who started earlier in forming illegal labor
unions. His endeavors among them met with little success
from the very start.

Large numbers of workers in Petersburg were later in-
veigled into joining these police unions. As in Moscow, the
Socialists warned the Petersburg workers against joining
these organizations, pointing out their true nature and pur-
pose, but some of the immediate results, mostly irrelevant-,
which they had secured through them, and particularly the
right to assemble at their factory clubs to discuss matters

of mutual interest, proved more convincing at the time. It
was in these organizations that the priest Gapon, who was
la-ter destined to play a historic role, was active in educa-
tional and -other capacities. Gapon’s direct contact with the
police was not known then. He was looked upon as a pe-
culiar character with a burning ambition for leadership.

The Russo-Japanese War.

The government had imperialist designs of extending its
domains in the Near and Far East. On February 16, 1903,
General Kuropatkin said to the future Count Witte: “Our
emperor ‘carries around great plans in his head. He wants
to take Manchuria, annex Korea, and Tibet, occupy Persia,
and secure not only Bosphorus but the Dardanelles as well.’’
(Quoted by Professor P-okrovsky from Wit-te’s Memoirs.—A.
T.) In 1901 Nicholas informed Kaiser Wilhelm, whom he
met in Danzig, that he was preparing to ﬁght Japan. In
1903 he again told Wilhelm about the impending conﬂict with
Japan, but was sure that he wo-uld be the one to choose the
time. '

The concessions of Admiral Bezobrazov on the Yalu
river, in which som members of the royal family’ were inter-
ested and which Japan considered as preparatory to the occu-
pation -of Korea, were the immediate casus belli. Japan,
however, knew of Russia’s designs and didn’t. care to Wait
till Nicholas would decide when it would be most conveni-
ent for him to strike. Japan opened hostilities and_ found
the Russian government prepared only on blue prints, and
even those were faulty. Since it has always been the prac-
tice -of governments to inaugurate a “vigorous foreign pol-
icy,” i. e., start a war somewhere, when pressed by internal
troubles, and since the Russian government was planning to
ﬁght Japan some day for the supremacy in the Far East,
Japan’s ultimatums were not heeded and Russia entered
upon a War which contributed a great deal to the Revolution
of 1905. Kuropatkin’s continuous “orderly” and “strategic”
retreats with great losses of killed and wounded, c-on-stant
lack -of ammunition and supplies when needed, graft scan-
dals, quarrels between various military and court cliques,
orgies and debauchery among the commanding staff, and
reports of peasant and labor disturbances at home, con-
tributed a great deal to the revolutionizing of the soldiers
at the front.

The Bourgeoisie and the Revolution.

The war in the Far East helped to expose the inherent

lutionis-ts hoping for a complete humiliation of the much-
advertised Russian military prowess, but even the liberal

the inﬂuence of the feudal aristocracy in the government.‘

This could be achieved by a crushing defeat -in the Far East
at -the hands of Japan and by continuous disturbances at
home organized by the revolutionis-ts. The burning of

estates by the peasants, the outbreaks in the cities led by

‘workers and students, and even the terrorist acts against

high government officials (Ministers Bogeliepov, Sypiagin,
and Plehve) were applauded by the bourgeoisie. It was

53

at that time that Milyukov was continually referring to
“our friends on the left.”

It is claimed (Professor Pokrovsky) that in some cases
employers did not object to strikes, particularly if they
showed a tendency to develop into political demonstrations,
and iembarassed the government. Some employers even
helped their workers to tide over during the strikes so that
the s-trikes could be prolonged. The young capitalist bour-
geoisie was having visions of an approaching revolution like
the revolution-of 1848, when the workers would go forth
to light the entrenched feudal aristocracy in their behalf.

The Mensheviks fell a prey to the ﬂirtatious of the bour-
geoisie with the revolution. The questions of properly evalu-
ating the role of the bourgeoisie during the revolutionary
period and of the attitude of the Socialists towards it, were
the ﬁrst important diﬁerences which arose between the
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks after the second Party Con-
gress of 1903, when these factions were formed. When the
bourgeois liberals began actively to organize their Zemstvo
and other public campaigns in 1904, the Mensheviks pro-
posed that the workers participate in those movements and
support the bourgeoisie in its effort to undermine czarism.

The Menshevik “Iskra” wrote then: “When we survey
the arena of struggle in Russia, we perceive only two forces:
the czarist autocracy and the liberal bourgeoisie which has
already constituted itself and is apower to be reckoned
with. The laboring masses are divided and can accomplish
but little. We do not exist as an independent force and
our aim therefore should be to support the other force-
the liberal bourgeoisie, to support and encourage it and
under no circumstances attempt to scare it with our inde-
pendent proletarian demands.” (Quoted by G. Zinoviev in
his “History of the Russian Communist Party.” The Ameri-
can Socialists, in -thorough Menshevik fashion, have adopted
this policy for the United States, and have “justi-ﬁed” it in
about the same language.)

The Bolsheviks attacked the proposed policy of self-
effacement. To deny the existence of the worker as a mov-
ing revolutionary force was considered by Lenin -tantamount
to a capitulation and turning over of the workers to the
service of the bourgeoisie. The Bolsheviks admitted revolu-
tionary aims on the part of the bourgeoisie at that time,
but they proposed that the workers utilize them rather than
the other way around, as -the Mensheviks Wanted to do.
The Mensheviks never recovered from that original sin and
during their later career they sank deeper and deeper in the
mire of bourgeois collaboration and disbelief in the creative
forces of the proletariat.

“Bloody Sunday."

The year 1905 opened with the Russian armies still re-
treating “in orderly fashion” in Manchuria, and with the
government trying to disguise its autocracy through the
liberal (sic!) regime of Prince Sviatopolk-Mirksy who was
called to power .after a couple of ministers were despatched

to their forbears by the bomb route. Mir.sky’s entrance into ~

the government was advertised as .the beginning of a new
era—a “Spring” after the cold and dreary Winter under the
late but unlamen-ted von Plehve. It was during this “Spring”
regime, when the government was supposed to have re-
formed, and -oﬂicially foreswore any excesses, that -the ﬁrst

_ erable lot.

act of the revolutionary drama of 1905 took place. Decreed
by the fate of the Revolution, the workers who were under

.Gapon’s tutelage _and government protection, -were chosen

to be the performers in that ﬁrst act.

It began with a strike at the Putilov Mills. The strike
was conducted by the Society of Factory Workers-—the
Petersburg police union, with economic demands as the orig-
inal cause. The leaders of the Society and of the strike
who were employed at Putilov’s were discharged by the
administrators. ‘Sympathetic strikes followed, ﬁrst in dif-
ferent parts of the Putilov workers and later spreading to -the
factories until they embraced about 140,000 workers.

It was then that the grandiose plan to present the czar
with a petition was put forth. Gapon, sensing a dramatic
opportunity for himself, urged this plan upon the masses
of -striking w-orkers who were getting beyond control. The
Socialists tried hard to dissuade the workers from adopting
the plan. They warned the workers not to go into the trap
which the government was spreading for them. But it was
of no avail. Gapon and his lieutenants had the control over
the masses. The petition was drawn, in which, in humble
and pious language, the Little Father was importuned to
take pity on his suffering children and improve their mis-
Not being able to stop the proceedings, the So-
cialists tried to introduce some political demands into the
movement upon which they looked with apprehension.

Gapon organized the parade to the Winter Palace in
grand style. He got thousands of workers-—men, women

and children———to join the procession with church ikons and
portraits of the czar carried at the head, attesting to the
religious and political reliability of the masses. The parade
was set for Sunday, Jan. 22. Gapon claimed that he had
notiﬁed the Mini.ster Mirsky about the intended pre-
sentation of a petition to the czar at the Winter Palace.
When the procession reached the square in front of the pal-
ace, it was met, not by the Little Father, but by his picked
soldiers, who sent a volley of shots into the crowd, with the
result that thousands lay killed and wounded on the snow-
covered stones, before the masses could realize what had
really happened. H S

The government knew of the proposed manifestation
and petition. It knew the contents of the document, which
was devoid of any revolutionary sentiments. The petition
was full of humility and resignation. It ended as follows:

“These, Lord, are our main needs which we want to call
to your attention. Decree and swear to carry them out——-
and you will make Russia glorious and powerful; you will
imprint your name on our hearts and the hearts of our
progeny forever. If you will not accept our prayers, we
shall die here on this square in front of your palace. We
have no place to go to, and there is no purpose in it. We
have only two ways, either to liberty and happiness, or to
the grave. Point out, Lord, either one and we shall go to
it without protest, even if it shall be the way to death.
Let our lives be the sacriﬁce for suffering Russia. We are
prepared -to make this sacriﬁce. We shall gladly make it.”
(Quoted in L. Trotzky’s “1905”).

The butchery was a clear provocation on the part of
the government. The workers were fooled into the under-
taking so that the government might administer a “rebuke”
which would be remembered by all those who might want
to embark on a similar course of action. The murder on
Palace Square was the apotheosis of the “Spring” regime.
The autocracy bared the claws which it had kept hidden,
and served notice on the people that it would brook no
opposition, nor even loyal prayers for partial reform. Gov-
ernor Trepov’s orders t-o the Petersburg garrison “not to be
niggardly with bul1ets” was the deﬁant answer of the czar
to the approaching revolution.

The Revolution Is Born.

Almost two generations of revolutionists have come and
gone before January 22, 1905. Many of them have swung
from the gallows and still more were buried alive behind
prison walls, or were laboring in Siberian mines for having
dared to dream about a rising of the people against autoc-
racy. Bloody Sunday opened the ﬂood-gates of the revolu-
tion. The ﬁendish betrayal of the masses on the Palace
Square destroyed in the Petersburg workers every vestige
of trust in the “Little Father” and his government. They
entered the square humble and servile subjects of the czar.
Those who remained alive left the Square with their minds
cleared of the age-long illusions and with a consuming ven-
geance in their hearts for the murder of their fellows.

Not only in Petersburg, but in all industrial centers, a
revolutionary class began to assert itself, realizing the con-
ditions under which it was living and conscious of its power
to alter those conditions. The blood of the murdered Peters-
burg workers cried out for revenge and action, and the
workers everywhere rose in a mighty protest against the
crime perpetrated upon their class. During the following

' bits in front of the

DECEMBER, 1925

month one hundred and twenty-two cities were in the throes
of strikes and political demonstrations of workers.

It was while these events were taking place that the
crafty Witte was writing Nicholas to end the war with
Japan because of lack of funds, and because “we need the
army in Russia to ﬁght our own people.” The Moscow
workers were none too gloomy when they heard on February
4 that Grand Duke Sergius, the czar’-s uncle, was blown to
Kremlin. Outbreaks were occurring
everywhere. The peasants were also rising against the
landowners and the government which was squeezing the
very lifeblood out of them. In the army, particularly in the
ﬂeet, unmistakable signs of revolts were being observed.
During the summer, when it looked as though the govern-
ment had succeeded in arresting the disturbances, the sail-
ors on the battleship “Potemkin” of the Black -Sea ﬂeet, rose
in revolt and attempted to get the rest of the ﬂeet to follow
their example. This rebellion frightened the government,
and it made public a proposal of one of its ministers to
establish a parliament with consultative powers to which
only representatives of the capitalists and landowners could
be elected. This proposal for a parliament was met with
derision everywhere and nothing came of it. The middle
classes, particularly the professionals——-teachers, lawyers,
oﬁice workers, engineers, etc., were also being drawn into the
welter of the revolution. Organizations of these elements
were being formed and national conventions were held in
which sympathies with the aims of the revolution were ex-
pressed. The revolution was beginning to penetrate all
sections of the population. While it was broadening out it
was also striking its roots deeper into the social fabric.

Revolutionary Theory and Revolutionary Action.

The revolution was marching in seven league boots.
The Social-Democratic party was the leading political factor
in the revolution. The Socialist-Revolutionists had little in-
ﬂuence among the workers. Among the Social-Democrats
the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, though in the same
Party, were developing different ideas regarding the various
problems affecting the revolution. The Mensheviks were in
control of the Central Committee of the Party. Immediately
after January 22, the Bolsheviks began to demand the con-
vocation of a Party congress to analyze what had happened
and chart of the course for future actions. The Mensheviks
refused and the Bolsheviks issued a call for a congress which
was held in London. N0 Menshevik delegates came to the
Congress, this faction having called a conference of its own
people in Geneva. Since the majority of the Party organ-
izations were represented at the London Congress it was
considered as a regular Party Congress. The Mensheviks
never accepted that. This was really the ﬁrst Bolshevik
Congress at which a homogeneous group gathered to eval-
uate the changes in the conditions of the country and the
ideology of the workers. It was the most signiﬁcant congress

in the history of the Party. It laid the foundation for the
most important policies, which later marked the Bolsheviks
as a distinct group in the Socialist movement. Most of the
best-known Bolshevik leaders participated at this C_ongress—
Lenin, Kamenev, Rykov, Lunarcharsky, Krassin, Litvinov,
Vorovsky and others were there to formulate the policies
which not only were carried out during the 1905 revolution,

but were at the basis of the revolutionary activity of the
Bolsheviks up to and during 1917.

While the Mensheviks were already getting scared that
the revolution was going a bit too fast, the Bolsheviks were
boldly and optimistically looking forward to the natural
unfolding of the revolution in which the ‘Russian Workers
were destined to cover themselves with glory. It was at
this Congress. that the Lenin formulation of the dictatorship
of the workers and peasants was adopted.

Only a chance discussion of democracy took place at
the previous Congress. This discussion became historic,
because Plekhanov sided with Lenin in the analysis of the
attitude of the proletariat toward democracy. A Bolshevik
delegate, Pasadovsky, raised the following question while
some editorial changes of the program were being adopted:
“Shall our future policy be subordinated to this or that
fundamental democratic principle, or shall all democratic
principles -be subordinated entirely to the advantage of our
Party,” and continued: There
is no democratic principle which shouldn't be subordinated
to -the welfare of the Party.”

“I am for the latter position.

Plekhanov replied by express-

ing solidarity with Posadovsky’s position. It is worth while

quoting his opinion somewhat at length on this very impor--
