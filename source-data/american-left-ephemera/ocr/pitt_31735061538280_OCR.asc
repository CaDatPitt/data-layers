 

attention to the municipal, state-wide and national elections,

i see to it that the. proper candidates are nominated and that

the people turn out en masse and elect them.

Finally, the trade unions must base their political activities
upon the non-partisan principle. That is, they must give their
political support to legislation and candidates upon the grounds
of issues and men, rather than upon mere loyalty to one

for the other of the two big parties. They must learn to cooper- .
ate skillfully with the progressive minority in the Republican.

Party as well as ‘with the progressive majority in the Demo-

T cratic Party. The unions should especially be on guard against

being drawn into untimely third party movements, advocated
by such people as Norman Thomas, Walter Reuther, and the
Trotskyites, as these would isolate them from the democratic
masses of the people, who follow the lead of the two old
parties. -

The basic function of the trade unions continues to be the
protection of the economic interests of the workers, and this
they must never lose sight of. But in our war-devastated world
the trade unions, of necessity, must perform many new politi-
cal functions,‘upon the accomplishment of which the fate of
.-the working class and the whole nation depends. Therefore,
the old-time notions that there should be no politics in the

unions must be eradicated, especially from the A. F. of L.~

unions. The workers should realize that the labor movement
has entered upon a higher stage, the political, and they should
‘become fully conscious of their new national and interna-
rtional political tasks. ‘

Responsibiliﬁes and Represeniaﬁoh

Among the new tasks of the trade unions some of the most
‘basic have to do with the changed relations towards industry
and the employers. From now ‘on the workers will have to
make a far more extensive and effective intervention in the
processes of production than they have ever done before. The
day is past when the employers can run their industries as they
:see ﬁt. Now the Government, the people, the trade union

movement, must have a strong voice in this matter, solvital
to the welfare of the nation.* ' ~ a
One of the most important of labor’s new attitudes towards

industry is the need to see to it, along with other progressive
 forces, that there shall be no economic smashup and mass

unemployment after this war and make certain that full pro-

'_duction and full employment are achieved in the ‘post-war

period. ‘The’ Roosevelt New Economic Bill of Rights nmst

be realized. The unions. should, therefore,,be ardent.support- '

ers of the Roosevelt 6o,ooo,ooo job program, in both its for-
eign" and domestic aspects. The unions must boldly demand

Athe workers’ right to workand setas their goal the complete

abolition of poverty in our country. They should insist upon a
rapid rise in the living standards of the workers as indispensa-

ble for keeping our industrial system going. They should

insist, too, upon sh_orter hours of work, a guaranteed annual

. wage, radically improved safety and health measures, and a
’ complete system of social insurance. No longer can the Ameri

can people, and the workers’ in particular, permit employers

to shut down their plants recklessly, to exploit their workers
mercilessly, and generally to act as industrial czars “as they

l have done for so long. Furthermore, while accepting the

system of private ownership of industry, the workers should.

realize that such privately owned industry must be "supple-.

mented by Government works if devastating economic crises

are to be avoided. » t '
In order to carry out these additional. tasksin industry

labor has to adopt corresponding new responsibilities towards

A production itself. For one thing, having won the right of .
seniority, it‘ must see to it that the jobs are distributed justly.

V ‘ fThis will require special‘ attention to the rights of Negroes,

* Since this speech was made, the A‘. F. of L., C.l.O. and United States
Chamber of Commerce have jointly announced a “New Charter for
Labor and Management,” including a number of the points here dis-
cussed regarding new relations betweenworkers and employers insindus-
try. Labor should give active support to this Charter as a potent means
for the realization of the general program of’ bettering the worker’s life.

tinuous production and for the improvement of industrial

processes. i ' ' e '
This will necessitate newrelationships with the employers,

especially with regard to reducing the number of strikes so far

as practicable. In establishing such cooperative relations with.
’ employers, however, the trade unions must 'not fall into the

errors of the 192o’s when they became reduced to hardly
more than speed-up agencies for proﬁt-hungry employers. The
unions must constantly keep before their eyes the need’ of the
most rapid improvement of the workers’ conditions in the
history of our country and be alert, strong and aggressive
in its realization. Such an improvement is necessary,
not only in the interest of the workers, but of the entire
nation’s prosperity. For only if the purchasing power of the
masses is raised can the industries be kept in operation-

To meet this new and heavy obligation regarding produc-
tion, the trade unions must acquire a much stronger voice in

industry than heretofore. The “labor-management” commit-V

tees established during this war are only a step in this direction

that labor must travel in winning a voice in industrial man- s

agement. The unions must also be especially vigilant to secure
adequate and responsible representation in all Government

bodies relating in any way to the management or control or‘,

expansion of production. ~

Besides these new responsibilities in industry, organized
labor also must take on new and great responsibilities in Gov-
ernment. Only if labor is fully represented in the local, state
and national governments can the unions adequately discharge
the ‘tasks placed upon them by virtue of their own strength
and the tremendous problems facing our country and the

‘ world. An end must be put to the present situation where the
 workers, who make up such a large percentage of our popula-

tion, are virtually without political represenfation in the

various legislative assemblies and other governmental bodies.

Organized labor must insist, then, upon full politicalrecog-
12

women, ex-servicemen and other newcomers inlindustry. The
unions also will have to‘ assume added responsibility for con- \

5.. ".....i'p

 

  

nition in the great democratic coalition that stands behind
the President and the whole Crimea program. This
recognition is a national necessity, for only if labor is well
representedvpolitically can it. exert its full democratic power
for the national program. Labor and its proposals must be
given consideration when it comes to making up election slates
and platforms, labor men and women should be included in
the ‘ various committees making up the war and post-war .
Administration machinery and also given high leading posts, ‘ 
‘ . C and trade unionists should be brought into the President’s 
Cabinet. Labor has come of age in the United States, and this . 
must reﬂect itself by full labor representation in every phase Z
of Government.
A further major responsibility of organized labor in this
' and all other democratic countries is to unite its forces inter- \ E‘:
, nationally and to throw its gigantic strength behind a realiza-, 
tion of the great program of the United Nations, the latest g V.
expression of which are the. decisions of the Crimea Confer-C 1, A
ence of the “Big Three” powers. World labor’s full and 
united strength is indispensable for driving the war through . C 9
to complete victory; for uprooting fascism entirely, and for U‘
the reestablishment of democracy, including the rebuilding \
of the trade unions in the liberated countries; for bringing
about the punishment of fascist war criminals; for relieving
the distress of the impoverished peoples and the rebuilding
of their war-shattered industries; for the industrialization of
the backward nations; for the systematic development of for- , V
eign trade; for the improvement of world labor standards; 
and for the thousand and one other urgent international
problems growing out of the present complicated and difficult ,
world situation. i ‘  ;
The great World Trade Union Conference held in’Lond0n  U
in February, 1945, representing 60,000,000 workers from 40 3 
nations, is the instrument that the workers of the world are
creating for the accomplishment of all the foregoing vital
international tasks. This huge body is now in the process of- y «
consolidating itself into a world federation of labor which . 0 V?

13

5.. W...‘

 

 

will supersede the half-dead International Federation of
Trade Unions. The new world labor federation must become  ‘
the steel structure of the who-le United Nations organization. A

American labor——A. F. of L., C.I.O., Railroad Brotherhoods
and United Mine VVorkers——.are duty bound to affiliate with the
new world federation of labor. The workers of this country
must understand that just as our Government cannot pursue a
policy of isolationism but must work with other Governments
for a; sane organization of the world, so also the American
trade unions must practice full cooperation with the labor
organizations of all other countries. The interests ofthe unions
demand this, and so do those of the whole American nation.
The new world labor organization, born in London,,has :1
program dove-tailing with that of the United Nations. In
order to mobilize the workers of the world behind this com-

-mon program, it is necessary, therefore, that the world labor A

organization be represented from top to bottom in the peace
conference at theend of the war, in the San Francisco Confer-

ence on April 25, and in all other conferences and commissions 2
of the United Nations having anything whatever to do with,

the prosecution of the war and theorganization of the peace.

World organized labor must be recognized as fundamental to

the success of the United Nations,‘ hence the trade unions of

the United States should give this demand for representation"

their fullest support. a

The Weakesf Spot in American Labor

The overwhelming masses of the American working class
are heartily in favor of the decisions of the Crimean~.Con—
ference and the speciﬁc program advocated by Roosevelt.
They want the war driven to complete victory, the extermi-
nation of fascism, the strengthening of world democracy, the
establishment of a solid post-war world organization, andgthe
development of an international economic program. And‘ they
are ready to take the steps necessary to accomplish these great

A ends. ‘ \

The C.I.O. is completely in line with these needs and

wishes of the masses. It is capably led by Philip Murray, and
the foregoing statement of necessary tasks could almost be
taken as an outline of existing C.I.O. policy. The great bulk
of the A. F. of L. unions (like those of the independent

is Miners and Railroad V/Vorkers) are also in general agree-
A ment with these policies.’ But the great weak spot is to be

found in the Executive Council of the A. F. of L. Here is
the main danger point in organized labor, and it is to this
danger that I am going to address myself.

During the war the Executive Council of the A. F. of L.
(unlike the defeatist ]ohn~L. Lewis) has given general sup-
port to the national war effort; nevertheless, it is responsible
for many policies which are distinctly harmful to labor’s and

e the nation's interests, and which, if uncorrected, could be

disastrous in the future.

On the 15—man Executive Council there are a number of
progressives of a sort. The best is Dan Tobin, head of the
giant Teamsters Union, with such men as Harvey Brown
(Machinists), G. M. Harrison (Railway Clerks), E. Flore
(Hotel and Restaurant Workers), occasionally taking a pro-
gressive stand. The balance of the Council ranges from con-
servatives to extreme reactionaries such as Matthew Woll
(Photo Engravers), W. L. Hutcheson (Carpenters), and G. M.
Bugniazet (Electrical Workers).

M7011 is the leader of the reactionary Council clique. He was
long a vice-president of the notorious National Civic Federa~
tion (until compelled by labor to resign) and he is now a
darling of the National Association of Manufacturers. Woll
also has much backing from labor reactionaries entrenched in

the leading bodies of various A. F. of L. international unions, _
, one of his special cronies being David Dubinsky of the
L I.L.G.W.U. The Woll clique is strong and well—organized, and
Dubinsky and W011 are now trying to still further strengthen A
A it by bringing John L. Lewis back into the Council.

The Woll group reﬂect the inﬂuence of the most reactionary

sections of the employers. Woll, Hutcheson and Bugniazet .

are Republicans and they are workinghand-in—glove with the
15

 

attemptof the leaders of the Republican Party to control the

Executive Council and thus to drive a wedge between the

7,000,000 A. F. of L. workers and the present Administra-
tion. Reactionary inﬂuence in the Council manifests itself in
many policies, of which the following are some of the most
important: ’ I

The Executive Council, while subscribing in general to
American -foreign policy, nevertheless keeps up a ‘harmful
barrage of opposition to it on speciﬁc questions. Thus it has
given (up to this time) no general endorsement of the Crimean

Conference, but instead has joined in with the reactionary.

attack upon the decision on the Polish question. Its leaders
also constantly assail our Soviet ally, one of their latest as-
saults being to denounce the London World Trade Union
Conference as a Soviet plot to establish world domination over
the labor movement. They likewise condemn the demand of
the Russians for reparations in kind from Germany as an
attempt to enslave the German working class.

More and more, too, under the pressure of the W011 group
of hard-boiled reactionaries, the Executive Council follows a
line -of carping criticism against the "Roosevelt policies.
Woll, Meany, etc., are trying to force the A. F. of L. into a
position of direct opposition to the Administration, with their
chargesthat it is trying to enchain labor through national ser-
vice legislation, their constant belly-aching about necessary war-
time economic controls, their bitter feud against the National
War Labor Board, their demands for a radical revision of the
Wagner Act, etc. This endless ﬁring into the Roosevelt policies
plays directly into the hands of the Hoover-Dewey-Vandenbcrg
opposition and makes much more difficult the prosecution of
the war and the realization of the Crimean decisions.

Generally, the A .F. of L. has lived up to its n0—strike pledge,
but now the Council is showing signs of yielding to the strike
agitation of such elements as John L.’ Lewis, Walter Reuther,
Emil Rieve, and the Trotskyites. Thus, the Council failed to
place as a condition for Lewis’ return to the Federation an
endorsement of labor’s wartime no-strike pledge, although

16

 

 

Lewis was threatening to tie up the war industries of the
country by a national coal strike.

The Executive Council has also formally endorsed the
Roosevelt 60,000,000 job plan, but actually the speeches of
W011, Meany and other leaders of the reactionary bloc sound
more like those of the heads of’ the N.A.M., what with their
eternal complaints against Government “regimentation,” their
soft-pedalling of the necessity for Government works to sup-
plement private industry in the post—war, etc. All of which
amounts to serious obstruction of the Administration’s vital
program of post-war economic reconstruction.

7On the burning question of Negro rights, which is so essen-
tial to national unity, the Executive Council has indeed a
sorry” record. It is a disgrace to the labor movement that a
.number.of A. F. of L. -unions discriminate against Negro
workers, and also the way the Council refuses to discipline
such organizaitons. One of the greatest achievements of the
C.I.O., which the Executive Council would do well to pattern
after, is the splendid way it is breaking down Jim Crow prac-
tices in the labor movement, in industry, and throughout our
social life. . .

Another grave shortcoming of the Executive Council ‘is in
the matter of working class political action, which is so vital
to the whole aspirations of our people. The political bank-
ruptcy of the Council was exhibited graphically during the
recent Presidential elections, when that body (doing exactly
what the Dewey forces wished), refused to endorse Roosevelt
for President and also supported many of the worst reaction-
aries as candidates for Congress, including Fish, Maas, Dana-
her, Day, Nye, Davis, etc. Fortunately, however, the rank and
ﬁle and the lower oﬂicialdom of the A. F. of L. rebelled against
this outrageous policy. At least three-fourths of the State fed-
erations and city councils, as well as man-y international
unions, disregarding the Executive Council, openly endorsed

-Roosevelt and condemned the Council's list of reactionary

Congressional candidates. This ﬁrm stand of the A. F. of L.
membership was a_ big, if not decisive, factor in preventing

'/ 

  

 

=...l....; 2;, .r..~...«. . ‘\‘.\‘  ,. ,- ~. ~ --.1. x

 

A the disaster of a Dewey election victory.

The position of the Executive Council, dictated by its
reactionary wing, on the vital question of labor unity is also
highly detrimental to the interests of the workers and the
nation. Many A. F. of L. leaders still do not recognize the
fact that the C.I.O. unionsare ﬁrmly established, and these
reactionaries are still dreaming of eventually dividing the
industrial unions, among the A. F. of L. crafts, especially at
the conclusion of the war. This narrow conception was behind
William Green's cynical rejection of Philip Murray’s recent
statesmanlike offer of joint collaboration between the C.I.O.
and A. F. of L. to secure the adoption of progressive legislation

‘ in the present Congress. Mr. Murray’s proposal expressed the

/

 

if deepest interests of the workers and would have constituted

a long step towards organic trade union unity; Mr. Green's
refusal was the action of an irresponsible reactionary, and it
tended to perpetrate the present harmful split in the ranks of
organized labor. _ ‘
Another reactionary policy of great potential danger is

the Executive Counci1’s incredibly stupid stand on the ques-
. tion of international trade union unity. At London, .as we

have seen, the workers of the world, 60,000,000 strong, came
together and launched a new international federation of
labor,— with which to help achieve the present great military,
economic, political and social objectives of the democratic

peoples of the world. But the A. F. of L. refused to attend the

Conference, being the only important labor organization in
the world that was absent. And the reasons? Green, W011,
Dubinsky, et al, claim that the Russian unions are not genuine
labor organizations, that the A. F. of L. cannot recognize on
an international scale the C.I.O. and the Railroad Brother-
hoods, and that the new world labor movement, besides being
‘*a Communist plot,’’ is also a dual organization to the almost
forgotten International Federation of Trade Unions (which
organization, by the way, has become a part of the new world
movement). On such absurd grounds does the A. F. of L.
Executive Council undertake to isolate the A. F. of L. from

//The foregoing harmful policies, autocratically established

’ by the Executive Council, are contrary to the will of the mass

of A. F. of L. members, who, if they had an opportunity to
vote on them, would, like the C.I.O. members, reject them A

3 A g . T V ‘The Democraﬁiaﬁon of fhe A. F. of

paralyze the A. F. of" L. and to prevent it from expressing its 2

labor’s interests, to the Roosevelt policies and, therewith also
to the program of the whole United‘ Nations. The matter of
democratizing the A. F. of L. is, consequently, a, question not
only of national, but of international importance. ,

.Misleadership in the A. F. of L._has been with us for many
years and the working class has paid dearly for it. Thus, to _‘

in these industries were enabled to sweat many additional. 0

has been with many other issues upon which the A. F. of‘L.
took a reactionary stand. All, this was bad enough while it ‘
was still affecting only our own labor movement, but now,
when A. F. of, L. misleadership develops into a serious threat

L democratic will. They should speak out clearly on the -big‘

 

political issues of the day. They ought to give ringing endorse- V

mentito United Nations policy, such as the Crimea Conference;
and they should back up the present Administration whole-

heartedly, whether the Executive Council does or not. As_

regards joint political action with the C.I.O., they should just
go ahead and practice it, even as they did, with such good
results during the recent Presidential elections, establishing

necessary committees and carrying on political activities of all
" sorts, regardless of the attitude of the W011 clique now domi-

nating the Executive Council. The A. F. of L. constitution
deﬁnitely permits this political autonomy. In the matter
of the new world federation of labor, the A. F. of L. unions
should make a categoric demand that the Executive Council

. abandon its ridiculous isolationist position and link its forces

 

with the rest of world organized labor.

Such intensiﬁed democratic activity by the lower bodies in
the A. F. of L. would shake up the Executive Council, stiffen
the backbone of the progressives in the Council, and begin
to get some satisfactory results. It is necessary also to begin to
send progressive delegates into the A. F. of L. conventions,
men and women who will boldly speak out and criticize wrong
policies of the Executive Council. As it is now, the Conven-
tions are composed almost exclusively of high union officials
who rarelyventure to criticize the W011 clique. It is necessary
to put an end to situations as, in the Presidential elections,
when the Executive Council ﬂagrantly violated the will and
interests of the membership, yet not one delegate in the
convention spoke a word in criticism; or where, in the same
convention, virtually the entire body of delegates, according
to President Lindeloflf, head of the Painters International

,Union, were in favor of sending representatives to the World

Trade Union Conference in London, but not one delegate
declared for it, because the reactionary Council was opposed.

Not only are a few live delegates needed in the A. F. of L-

conventions to jostle the dry bones there, but it is also indeed
about time that new, progressive ﬁgures were elected into the
20 '

 

 

Executive Council itself. It is a disgrace, as wellas a grave

injury to the whole labor movement to have such men as

.Matthew W011 and VV. L.‘ Hutcheson elected from year to

year to the Executive Council. And to make it worse, they are

‘elected unanimously. 0

A strong democratic wind is now blowing throughout the
world’s labor movement. This was especially manifest at the
"London trade union conference, where, with 60,000,000 organ-
ized workers behind them, the delegates brushed aside those

dry-as-dust, conservative and reactionary labor bureaucrats who
tried to prevent the crystalization of this great world move—
ment. The A. F. of L. leadership in our country will not a
escape the effects of this new progressive labor spirit. For the

A. F. of L. members, like their brothers and sisters in the

C.I.O., arefull of the new progressivism. Nor will it be long

jbefore their strong democratic trend will register itself in

drastic improvements in A. F. of L. upper circles. The grave

problems confronting our nation and the world imperatively,

demand a better, more progressive, more democratic leader-
ship in the A. F. of L. ExecutiveCouncil. To bring this about
isione of the major tasks of the whole labor movement. The
present A. F; of L. leaders, Earl Browder recently characterized
as “senile and bankrupt.” There is no place for policies and
leadership of the M7011 stripe in the great A. F. of L., with its
7,000,000 members. ‘

Forward +0 Vicfory, Peace, Democracy and Prosperity

The peoples of the world now confront the greatest oppor-

tunity in all their long and stormy struggle to wipe out -

tyranny, to establish permanent peace, to strengthen democracy
and to lay the basis for mass prosperity.pThese great goals must
be achieved, as the alternative to them would be chaos and
another world bloodbath.

In the ﬁght for a new and better world, the United States,
with its huge wealth and great industries, must play a decisive

role. Along with its major allies, the U.S.S.R., Great Britain,

China and France, as well as the rest of the United Nations,
21 i

 

  

it has to exert all its tremendous strength for the’ realization
of the historic program laid down at the conferences in Mos-
cow, Teheran and Crimea. ‘'

The Roosevelt policies point generally in the right direc-
tion to achieve these goals. The gravest danger the Adminis-
tration confronts is that, because of the powerful opposi-

~ tion it has to face, it may be pushed off the correct path

or be so slowed down that it will be unable to adopt, or to
carry through the basic decisions necessary for the "success of
the United Nations program. ‘

This danger makes it imperative that American organized
labor—all sections of it, A. F. of L., C.I.O., Railroad Brother-
hoods, United Mine Workers—should rise to the heights of its
historical opportunities and responsibilities. It must unite all

its great forces, strengthen its leadership and policies, and by

aggressive political action see to it that the present administra-
tion has the full backing and constructive strength of the
gigantic masses of American labor and its allies. If this is

done, there can be no doubt but that our country will play, a ’

progressive and successful world role and that harassed hu-
manity, at the end of this war, will enter upon a period of
unequalled progress. .

ORGANIZED LABOR FAOES THE. NEW WORLD}

By WILLIAM» Z. FOSTER

Labor's New Sifuaﬁon

In the more than ﬁfty years since the ﬁrst strike in which
I participated, that of the Philadelphia street carmen in
December, 1894, the American trade union movement has
made tremendous progress. In those early days, and indeed
right up until only half, a dozen years or so ago, the unions
were ﬁghting desperately to build their organizations and to

_ establish their right to live. The rich, powerful and stiff-

necked capitalists resisted the workers’ demand for organiza-

tion, almost to the point of small—scale civil war. In few coun- A

tries were strikes so violently combatted by employers ‘as in
the United States. With the Government, the courts and the
armed forces at their disposal, the employers used every means
touprevent the workers from organizing to better their eco-
nomic conditions. Their slogan was the “open shop,” and they
sought to check the growth of unionism by spy systems, gun-

men, blacklist, and organized terrorism. Thousands of work»
ers were murdered and millions underwent severe hardships‘
in the long struggle to improve their conditions and to build

the American labor movement-. »

Now, however, the trade unions, particularly during the‘

Roosevelt Administration, ﬁnd themselves in quite a new
situation. The two great objectives, organization and
recognition, for which the unions fought so long and

resolutely have been very largely achieved. Since the

days of my ﬁrst strike in 1894, the population of the country
has just about doubled, but the membership of the trade

7 unions has increased almost ﬁfty times over—that is, from less

than 300,000 to almost 14,000,000. Moreover, the unions are
now widely recognized even by the biggest employers, whose
great “open shop” industries of earlier years have been organ-
ized, while the Government has written into law the Workers’
elementary rights to organize. This does not ignore the facts
that there are still many millions of workers unorganized and
that in various respects the unions are still not recognized by
the employers and the Government. . -

Organized labor, with its two major objectives of yesteryea
—-organization and recognition—well on the way towards
accomplishment, however, finds itself confronted by new tasks.
The unions are by no means in a position to rest on their
oars and take things easy. On the contrary, labor’s new
status is one of great political responsibility and also of un-
paralleled opportunity. It puts upon the unions the heaviest
and most complicated tasks in their history, with an urgent
need for the highest type of leadership.

Today the peoples of the world, beating back the murder-

ous attempt of the fascist states’ to enslave humanity, face

problems-military, economic, political, social—-of unprece-
dented, magnitude. To solve these problems and to keep the
world from sinking into chaos, the utmost activity of organ-
ized labor is required, especially here in the United States.
In the historic wartime conferences of Moscow, Teheran and
Crimea, the leaders of the three greatest powers of the United
Nations, President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin and Prime
Minister Churchill, laid down the free peoples’ program for
winning the war, for eradicating fascism, for establishing a
solid post-war organization to maintain world peace, and for

the rehabilitation of the war-ravaged world upon the basis of

an expanding economy.
The future of civilization depends upon these great objec-
tives being reached. And their realization, in turn,will depend

decisively upon the extent to which the trade unions through- ‘

out the United Nations give them active support. Organized
labor is the very backbone of the present stupendous efforts
of the democratic peoples to defeat fascism and to build a

"free, peaceful and prosperous world. just today, in the I
New York Times, Senator Claude Pepper of Florida is quoted

as saying: “We will not have Dumbarton Oaks or Bretton
Woods unless labor mobilizes its strength and ﬁghts for these
things.” He might have added also that without the support

. of organized labor the whole program of the United Nations

will not be achieved.

Defeat fhe Reacﬁonery Opposiﬁon

In these war days organized labor in the United States has
numerous urgent tasks, including the maintenance of pro-
duction at the highest possible levels, the honoring of its no-
strike pledge, and many others. And with these, it must also
be particularly conscious of the major ‘responsibility, ﬂowing
out of its great strength, namely, to help defeat the opposition
in this country to the whole victory program that is summed
up in the decisions of the Crimean Conference. In this ﬁght
the‘ trade unions must be close and active collaborators with
all other groups of the population who are supporting the

policies of the Roosevelt Administration against the power-

ful opposition.*

All through this war period the American people have had
to contend with such unpatriotic, fascist—minded opposition
elements. These forces have exploited the war for proﬁteering
purposes; they have triedwto soften the blow against Hitler;
they have opposed the slogan of “unconditional surrender”
and have sought a negotiated peace. During the recent elec-
tions the same forces, under the leadership of Dewey, made

‘a desperate effort to seize control of our national Government.

Now they are concentrating their efforts upon defeating or
emasculating the Dumbarton Oaks proposals for a post-war
peace organization that are to be acted upon by the United
Nations at San Francisco. They are also trying to cut the heart
of the Bretton Woods ﬁnancial plans for world economic re-
construction. And, as they go on with these current ﬁghts,

to secure a majority of Congress in the Fall election of 1946.
This stubborn opposition to the Crimean program is made

up of fascist-minded big business men, union busters, ‘Negro

haters, anti—Semites, Soviet baiters, native fascists and the like.

The opposition is typiﬁed by such names as those‘ of Hoover, ,

Taft, Vandenberg, Dewey, Wheeler, Rankin, Dies, Hearst,

McCormick, etc. As against the progressive, Roosevelt pro- ,
Crimea policies of international collaboration, the reactionary.

opposition stands for a program of militant American impe-

rialist expansion. Seeing the‘ United States’ great economic,‘

political and military strength, they would exploit that

strength by trying to develop American domination over the .

war-torn world. Such imperialist ambitions are evident in all
the struggle of the reactionary opposition, in their pro-Hitler
sympathies, in their attempts to set up a weak post—war world
organization which would give the reactionaries of the United
States a free hand for imperialist maneuvers, in their efforts

to distort the Bretton Woods ‘proposals so as to permit of

American imperialist world‘ ﬁnancial dictation.

This imperialist program could only lead to economic dis-
aster, nationally and internationally. It would ruin the
American people's needful 60,000,000 job program; it would

threaten the existence of the labor movement, it would raise ”

a real danger of fascism in the United States; it would start
the world towards a new and still more devastating war.
Hence, this reactionary opposition, which has great wealth
and a huge press behind it, must be ﬁnally defeated. The
crushing of Hitler Germany is a mighty blow against Amer-
ica’s reactionaries; the defeat of Dewey in the elections was

also a great setback for them. But they must be whipped alt0- I

gether—in the present ﬁght around Dumbarton Oaks and
Bretton Woods, in the 1946 election, and whenever and'wher-
ever they may raise their ,heads.‘The defeat of the powerful
reactionary opposition in this country is a fundamental con-
dition for the realization of the great program outlined at the
Crimean Conference. Organized labor, by alert and aggressive

-political action, must furnish the main section of the broad
national democratic coalition necessary to bring about this

After the defeat of Germany and Japan the most powerful

» reactionary forces will be found in the U. S. The militant im-

perialist forces in this country will try to rally the reactionary
elements everywhere against the whole democratic program
symbolized by Crimea. This places_ a double responsibility
upon the labor and progressive forces in the United States, to
defeat and break up this reactionary combination.

Consolidafe Naﬁonal Unify

Beyond question, a large majority of the American people
stand behind the Roosevelt policies and the general program
that was laid down at the Crimean Conference. But this
majority needs organization to effectively carry out the tre-
mendous work of war reconstruction before it, and in order to
defeat the reactionaries wherever they may make a stand. It
cannotremain the loose conglomeration of progressive forces
that it has been up to the present time. Organized labor, in
line with its general political responsibility, must take an
active and leading part in this consolidation of our national
unity. Among the more important steps necessary in this direc-
tion, especially going towards linking labor up with other

progressive groups, are the following:

a. Organized labor must unite its own ranks. Organic unity
between the C.I.O. and the-A. F. of L. is of very great impor-
tance and every effort must be bent towards that end, but the
workers cannot wait until such complete unity is achieved.
They must ﬁnd the means for the main sections of the labor
movement to work together, despite the split between them.
Ample experience during the war has shown this to be quite
feasible, for upon innumerable war boards A. F. of L. and
C.I.O. leaders are working harmoniously. In elections and in
movements for or against certain pieces of legislation the A. F.
of L., C.I.O.\and Railroad Brotherhoods are also to be found
in active cooperation. Such collaboration must be vastly ex-

7 .

 

  

tended and intensiﬁed. It will be a long step towards full trade
-union unity, and it is a fundamental necessity for strengthen-
ing the democratic coalition supporting the Roosevelt policies.

b. Another vital phase of buttressing national unity is for
the trade unions to establish the closest cooperation with the’
Negro people. Important progress has been made in this re-
spect, especially by the C.I.O., some 800,000 Negroes now

being members of trade unions. But‘ very much«' more remains .

to be done. Anti-Negro discrimination must be broken down
in A. F. of L. unions, Negroes must be freely elected to trade
union posts, seniority concessions must be made to them in
order to protect their newly-won position in industry. The
trade unions should become the ardent champions of the eco-
nomic, political and social rights of the Negro people in every
walk of life. ' t V

c. Close cooperation between organized labor and the ex-
servicemen’s organizations is also a fundamental necessityfor
full American support to the Crimean decisions. If the labor
unions and the veterans’ organizations work shoulder-to-
shoulder from now on into the post-war ‘ period, democracy
will be safe in the United States and America’s role in the
world will be a. progressive one. But if the reactionaries should
be able to drive a ‘wedge between labor and the veterans, as
they are now trying desperately to do, it would result in a
perilous situation. Labor should, therefore maintain ﬁrm con-
tact with the men and women intthe armed forces now, and,
when they come back to civilian life, see to it that they have
jobs and full protection for their rights. Vvorker-veteran‘
cooperation will be the most ‘basic necessity of our political
life during the post-war period.

(1. A further vital essential for strengthening national unity
is a much closer cooperation between the organized workers
and the people in the agricultural areas. In the recent Presi-
dential elections, when reaction‘ made a determined ‘effort to

capture Congress and the Presidency, a large proportion of
the votes for Mr. Dewey and his colleagues came from the

agrarian states and from the rural sections of the industrial.

states. This represents a very dangerous situation, and organ-

- ized labor should spare no pains in order to improve it. Among

the urgent measures necessary to draw the agricultural popula-
tion more solidly into the democratic coalition are for the
unions to carry on an energetic campaign to organize the work-
ers employed in small towns and on the farms, and to enter into
closer cooperative relations with the farmers’ organizations on
the basis of their mutual interests. Organized labor cannot
afford to neglect the crucial matter of breaking the inﬂuence
of the reactionaries in the agricultural areas of our country.
e. Organized labor must also be prepared to cooperatewith

V those important and growing sections of the capitalists who

are supporting the domestic policies of the present Admin-
istration and the Crimean Conference. The employers are by
no means all in the_camp of political reaction, and the trade
unions need to be alert to cooperate with those capitalists who
understand that the only way to avoid chaos is along the lines
laid down in the Crimean Conference.

f. The trade unions have need, too, to cooperate politically

with the many other progressive organizations and movements
of women, youth, professionals, national groups, etc. Such
cooperation, necessary for national unity, can beachieved on
the basis of the nation’s domestic and foreign objectives and
the speciﬁc interests of the several movements concerned.
V To carry out these vital objectives, the trade unions should
set up a whole series of political action committees, much as
they did during the recent national elections, to mobilize‘ their
membership for political action. These committees should
link up the A. F. of L., the C.I.O., the Railroad Brotherhoods,
and the United Mine \/Vorkers, and they should likewise es-
tablish connections with all the other groups and movements
listed above. _ T

This network of committees, and the rank and ﬁle of th
unions generally, must become highly active politically. They
should keep close track of all legislation pending in the local,
state and national legislative bodies and make the voice of the
people heard in these matters. They should also pay the closest
