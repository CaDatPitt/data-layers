THE, MINE-MILL UNION

Story of the  

By Al. SKINNER
International Vice President

HE QUESTION of what happened at Bunker Hill has

, been asked by thousands of Mine-Mill members as

' well as by many other union representatives who recog-

nized the national significance of the long Coeur d’Alene

struggle. It has no simple answer, but the outstanding
T‘ factor that contributed to the breaking of '

this 7-month strike at the ballot box was the
{overwhelming economic pressure on the men

and theirgfamilies.

district.

Despite the narrow election defeat (a
‘switch of 25 votes would have changed the
outcome) and collapse of the Bunker Hill
strike, hundreds of members of Local 18 and

} iBut,an7_1amazing development —ro11owm_g
_ then .de‘certi§f,ication was the continued" activi-‘ j
 ty by hundreds of Mine-Mill members in the

its auxiliary were still confident the set-back

wouldprove to be only temporary. Kellogg

Skinner

strike headquarters continued as much a beehive of activity as
. before. More than 400 members attended the regular Local 18

were reopened on Dec. ‘12, con-

ftinuing until a strike-settling
agreement was reached on
Dec. 17 and ratified by a, big
Local I8‘ meeting of AS&R
workers the next night. (See
story on Page 1.)

Fight Goes On

 The Local 18 executive
board has asked me to assure
the’ International officers and
‘all Mine-Mill locals that the
fight in the ‘Coeur d’Alene will

- go on and that eventually
Mine-Mill will be reinstated as

- .._bargaining agent for Bunker

Hill Workers.

This is not the first strike in

Mine-Mill history broken by

the Coeur d’Alene mine opera-

tors. Nor is it the first strike

broken by mine operators else-

. where_ in the U. S. and Cana-

i -da. During its long history of

organization in the metal min-

ing.. -industry, our union has

~ suffered many setbacks far

The ability of the miners,
Inillmen and smeltermen of
North America to absorb re-
verses and then go on to far
greater union achievements
has been proven time and time
again. It will be proven once
more in the Coeur d’Alene

,;;How Formula Operates

1 ' Here’s how the new formula
operatesr

 1. A strike is permitted to
run for months without hasty
opposition or attack on the
union. .

-2. During the course of
months on the picket line, the
company moves to convince
businessmen and community
leaders, as well as the strikers,
that the strike is hopelessly
doomed to failure. The com-

‘pany, meanwhile, evades bar-
gaining and when forced to
negotiate, does nothing except
repeat the offer made before
the strike started.

3. The company then begins"

to develop leadership and com-

munity support for a “new un--

ion” which can deal more “re-
alistically” with management.

4. The “new union," with aid
from business leaders hurt by
the strike, starts a public cam-
paign against the existing un-
ion leadership for-disregarding
the ‘‘community’s welfare.”

This involves all forms of pub-
licity —— community meetings,

5. When enough dissatisfac-
tion with the strike is devel-,
oped and economic pressures
become great, a ‘movement is
started for a decertification pe-
tition to replace the old union
with the so-called “new” one.
During this time, the company
does nothing publicly except to
remind the community of the
economic drain created by the
strike. Behind the scenes, how-
ever, the company through its
supporters in the community
is pulling the strings to pave
the way for a decertification
election. ‘ '

6. After the petition is filed,
publicity is stepped up to con-
vince everyone a vote on “re- ‘
turning to work” is a good,
democratic concept. Prior to
the election an intense cam-
paign, with Madison Avenue
techniques, is aimed at the
people who are now deeply in
debt and under tremendous ec-
onomic pressure from» the
long tough strike. The stage is
set to oust the legitimate un-
ion.

Other Pressures

This was the formula Bun-
ker Hill used to win the 'decer-
‘tification election.

It was accompanied‘ by other
pressures, too—from banks, fi-
nance c o m p an i e s, business
houses and even the FHA;
plus threats to repossess
homes, autos, furniture and
appliances-—all contributing to
break the strike.

Even the school children
were submitted to this pres-
sure when the school” board
cut off the hot lunch program.
New community groups were

organized such as “I Am An ;
“Common
Sense C 0 u n c i l,” “Shoshone ’
County Anti-Communist.

American Youth,”

League,” and gradually church
leaders were drawn into the
drive against the strike.
Union Gains Support
Our union fought hard

against this strike-breaking:

formula with extensive publi-
city of its own. It won wide
support. Financial aid -from
Mine-Mill locals, the Interna-
tional and the entire labor
movement grew to magnifi-
cent proportions. -

Support, financial and mor-

21.], came from hundreds of lo- _

cals and internationals
throughout the U. S. and Can-
ada—longshoremen on the Pa-
cific coast, woodworkers in
the Northwest, teamsters, coal
miners, hotel and restaurant
workers, dozens of locals of
various unions in the East, Ca-

nadian unions, the Idaho and,
Washington state AFL-CIO’

Councils, the Spokane Trades

and Labor Council, and many M

others.

During the week prior to
the election, more than 100
telegrams were received at
Local 18 headquarters from
local unions, state councils
and internationals calling for
defeat of the company-union.
In addition, letters and dona-
tions came in from nearly 500
individual union members,
doctors, ‘ lawyers, 'f a r In e r s,
teachers and people from all

walks of life. Few strikes; in
H recent]-history. have received}

-Despite efforts to smoke
out the source of unlimited
funds behind the company-

never answered, although
there is every reason to believe
that a substantial amount

. came from the Steelworkers.

The Steel union thus was
the only labor organization in
the whole country giving di-
rect aid and public backing to
a company union.

We hope that unions every-
where learn of this Steelwork-
ers stab-in-the-back to 2,200
miners and smeltermen on
strike for seven months. This

INE PRODUCTION of copper since recovery from -last
year’s strikes has been at the highest sustained level in

O  S. history. But U. S. consumption of copper this year -may

be the lowest since 1949. Since last May, the United States has
been able to use its own output of copper and has had to dispose
of red metal surplus to its needs on "the European market. '

This surplus = has been absorbed into ' growing stocks of ”

copper, which in the United States and foreign countries com-
bined, have been rising more sharply in recent months than in

the months before the big ‘copper cutbacks of 1958, or before

the strikes in 1959. Price declines in copper and brass preceded
the cuts in lead and zinc, .and more may be in_the cards.
Our union has been, watching these trends, and in the last

three months has movedto protect and extend the wage gains

of our members. New coiitracts or contract extensions have
been signed since last ‘ October with American Smelting and
Refining, Magma and San Manuel Copper, and American Brass.

These agreements all provide for solid, substantial pay in-
creases effective July 1, 1961, as well as for other benefits.
Significantly, these agreements also restore a common expira-
tion date to all but one ofour contracts with major non-ferrous

. A producers. By these moves, we have anticipated and forestalled

stiffened employer resistance to wage increases that we might
have encountered at the bargaining table had we waited until
next year. ' ‘ ’

—~- Having secured our position on wages, our attention is now

turning to the problems of avoiding layoffs in mining and
smelting, or further curtailment in brass. All the signs point
to this danger unless vigorous action is‘ taken to reverse the

trend.

VERY encouraging development last month was the ap-
pointment of Representative Stewart Udall (D.,_Ariz.) as

that I and some of our other national officers can sit down with -

UR UNION long has favored measures to promote full em-

"hope that our program, will gain a more favorable response

the case with the last. _ . _
Our battle will be more than half won if this turns out to be
the case. But we need other progfitms aimed directly at
strengthening the position of lead, zinc, copper, metals produced
in association with‘ them, and brass.

The House Rules Committee

Third’ Branch of Congress

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Prospects for liberal legislation in the 87th Congress 
depend pretty much on the question of what the new administration will do. toward .
redeeming the Democratic party platform pledge to reform the all-powerful House * 
Rules Committee, champion wrecker of liberal causes. The answer should shape up 
soon after Congress‘; opens on Jan. 3, since Congressional rules can only be changed V» {V
in the opening days of? the ' , . - ‘ 
session. ’  

  
   

 

 

Here is a brief rundown on V

the makeup of the committee-
and how it has operated for
years as the main barrier to
legislative progress. - '  V

The Rules Committe  ‘
12-member body, always n_um- I

bering eight members from
the majority party and four
from the minority. During the
l.ast six years it has been pre-
sided over by Howard Smith

of Virginia. “Judge” Smith, as '

heis commonly called, is also
the master strategist for the
120-odd Southern Democrats in
the House.

‘Most of the committee’s au-

_ thority stems from its right to

decide what bills, of the many‘
approved by regular standing
committees, shall go to the
floor for action. It can clear
a bill or compel drastic
changes as a price for its ap-
proval. More. often it simply
buries measures it doesn’t like.

Almost. nothing can be done
in the House—and thus in Con-
gress—without the consent of
the Rules Committee. Even
wh.en a bill passes both cham-
bers, it has the final say-so by
virtue of its authority to de-
cide, if the bills differ, whether
the House version should go to
conference for a compromise.

31¢‘ 9% >1‘

FOR SOME years the com-
mittee has been manned by
four Southerners, four North-
ern Democrats, and four Re-
publicans. From this lineup
there generally emerged a
neat conservative coalition, in-
cluding the four Dixiecrats and
at least two Republicans.

So high, wide and hand-
some‘ have been its operations,
that the Rules Committee has
come" to be known as the Third
Branch of Congress, equal to
and often superior to the
House and Senate.

What happened to minimum
wage legislation during the
last session is an example of
how the committee’s reputa-
tion has been earned. First,
when the Labor Committee re-
ported a moderately good bill,

. Judge Smith and his coalition

only permitted it on -the floor
under conditions . which helped

. promote a Dixiecrat substitute‘
V that trimmed additional cover-

age to a bare million persons»
and sliced the proposed mini-
mum from $1.25 to $1.15.

Supreme Court Hears Travis Argument

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D.C. --The
Supreme Court of the United
States Dec. 13 heard argument
in the 61/: year-old Travis case.
General Telford Taylor, who
had prepared the briefs to-
gether with Mine-Mill General
Counsel Nathan Witt, present-
ed the case for the defense be-
fore the nation’s highest tri-
bunal.

Travis, former Mine-Mill sec-
retary treasurer, was first con-
victed in 1955 for filing alleg-
edly false Taft-Hartley non-
Communist affidavits in 1951
and 1952. When that convic-
tion was reversed by the Fed-
eral Court of Appeals in Den-
ver, he was tried again and
again convicted. This time the
Court of Appeals upheld the
conviction, and the Supreme
Court then accepted his appeal
on all issues raised by the de-
tense.

Also before the top Court
were two motions for a new

1' trial in the case. These were

based on newly discovered evi-

ence.'_}that ‘-Fred Gardner, one s g

of the three witnesses against
Travis, had committed perjury
in this and another unrelated
case. Both motions and the
original appeal from the con-
viction were argued together
by Taylor before the Supreme
Court.
It! lit *

TO OBSERVERS here it
seemed that the members of
the Court were sympathetic to
Taylor's arguments and impa-
tient with the arguments pre-
sentedsby the government at-
torney.

Although it is difficult to
foretell the outcome of a case
from the argument and ques-
tions of the judges to the at-
torneys, Travis’ counsel were
encouraged by the course of
the argument and the attitude
of the high justices.

One reason for optimism as
to the result is because there
are so many issues in the case,
so that the conviction will be
reversed if Travis wins on
only one. The Supreme Court

seemed particularly interested .

in" two of the issues.
. - I I. I

 

ONE was the argument that
the prosecution of Travis was
improper to begin with be-
cause the indictment was re-
turned in Denver instead of in
Washington, D.C., where the
affidavits in question were
filed "With the _National Labor
Relations Board. If the Su-

preme Court accepts this argu- ,

merit, then the entire case will
be dismissed. ,

The other issue related’ to
the fact that the trial judge
refused to make available to
defense counsel the testimony
which Gardner and the two
other 1 government witnesses

had given to the grand jury, i

to see whether that testimony
was consistent with the testi-
mony they gave during the
trial. - . V

If the Supreme Court re-

verses the conviction on this .
ground, the government could .

try Travis a third time, but it
is doubtful that it would do so.

\\ t I t

A OUTCOME ofthe Travis

A case also has ._.great, signifi-

cance for the ‘appeal of the
nine Mine-Mill leaders from
their Taft -Hartley conviction
on conspiracy charges in 1959.
That appeal is pending in the

Court of Appeals, but action a

has been stayed pending the
Travis. decision because there
are several common issues.

If. the Travis case is re-

versed on one of these issues, —

it will mean that the convic-
tions in the T-H conspiracy
case will be automatically re-
versed without the necessity
of briefs or arguments.
Taylor, formerly chief ~U.S.

prosecutor at the famous Nazi .

war-crimes trials in Nurem-
berg, is also -heading the de-
fense, fight in the conspiracy
case along with Witt.

There is no way of telling

how. quickly the Supreme ‘
Court will hand down its de- -
cision in the Travis case. '
Sometimes a decision‘ is an- . P
nounced a few Weeks after ar- .

guments, but often no decision

. is_made for months. The Court b

The scheme in principle ends
racial discrimination in em-

will permit qualified ' African
employees to advance into

jobs “ ‘previously reserved’ for “

whites. Advancement is likely
to be slow over the next" sev-
eral years, however, because
few African workers have the

skills or training to qualify-

for the better jobs.

To help theprocess along,
new jobs as "assistant” to Eu-
ropean operators are being
created. Africans, it is expect-
ed, can gain qualifying experi-

jobs. Advancement could be

‘Present wage levels for pro-

run from a starting rate of
$1.15 per day plus bonus for
laborers, _to operators’ jobs,
until now reserved for whites,
paying ten times as much.

U. 5. investment

Cheap labor abroad con-
tinues to lure investment by
U. S. companies in foreign
mining and smelting enter-
prises.

The U.S. Commerce Depart-
ment estimates that invest-
ment abroad in 1960 in-'min-
ing and smelting by U. S. com-
panies will reach $358,000,000,
compared with $490,000,000 in
1959.

The decline from 1959 to
1960 is attributed to the com-
pletion of large projects in
Latin America last year.

Braden Talks

Talks continued at Mine-
Mill press time between Bra-
den Copper Company, Kenne-
cott’s subsidiary in Chile, and
Chilean Copper Workers Con-
federation, representing 7,000
workers at Braden. Present

With negotiations continu-
ing up to the wire, hopes that
a strike might be averted are

NEW JERSEY ZINC company workers, after a despera-
tion 16-week strike conducted by the Steelworkers union, re-
turned to Work at the end of November with a 3-year contract 1
running to July 27, 1963.

Miners at Gilman, Colo., and in Tennessee, Virginia and
Pennsylvania signed up for three years under a wage and fringe‘
package totaling 10.5 cents effective Nov. 28, 1960, including
a claimed 2.5 to 3 cents in insurance and hospital benefits. , The
increase runs for 16 months, with a wage reopener" on March
26, 1962. ~ 6

AMERICAN METAL CLIMAX Board Chairman Walter
Hochschild says ‘there is a good possibility that the big copper,
lead, zinc and molybdenum producer will go into the copper‘
fabricating business in the next few years. Frank Coolbaugh, '
President of the company, confirmed Hochschild’s statement in ,
a talk before the New York Society of Security Analysts re-
cently. Coolbaugh said the company management is looking
into the possible acquisition of fabricating plants. Both execu-
tives look to increased copper, lead, zinc Consumption in the
1960’s.

KENNECOTT appears to have stubbed its toe on a couple of
South African investments, thus proving the old adage that it’s
hard to be right all the time. Reports in the industry press
indicate that Kennecott has had enough of two South African
gold mining companies in which it had invested $47,000,000.
They are the Merriespruit Gold Mining Co., and Virginia Orange .

Merriespruit has been flooded since 1956, while Virginia ap-
pears to have exhausted the better grades of ore. Consequently,
Kennecott is reported to be negotiating for the sale of its in-
terests in these properties. A Kennecott spokesman would
neither deny nor confirm the report. '

ALUMINUM industry has hopes of breaking into the $225“*"‘
million home building wiremarket, now dominated by copper,
according to American Metal Market. This metal trade paper ‘
doubts that aluminum can make it, now or in the foreseeable
future. ‘

The larger size of aluminum conductor, its workability and ‘
joining characteristics, and the problem of educating contractors
in its use are cited as points unfavorable to widespread use of .1“
aluminum. Kaiser Aluminum Company is the leader in the
attempt to capture this market for aluminum. They call this
effort the “Assault on the Citadel.” They have compiled a
standard practices book for aluminum building wire and are

" pushing technical help through a sales engineering staff and

with demonstration vans.

American Metal Market notes the absence of any strong -..
counterattack by the copper industry to point out the many
advantages of copper building wire. Nevertheless it concludes,

“If copper prices remain at reasonable levels, aluminum would
be a long time coming.” 7

MOLYBDENUM CORPORATION of America, assisted by
U. S. Interior Department exploration advances, has confirmed
the existence of a large molybdenum deposit near Questa in
northern New Mexico, second only to the world’s largest de-
posit at Climax, Colorado. The only other major U. S. source
of molybdenum is as a by-product of copper mining, principally
in Utah and Arizona. Molybdenum is used mainly in alloying
iron and steel to impart added strength.

More Jobs Cut by New
Great Falls Zinc Mould

GREAT FALLS, Mo«nt.—-More jobs are being eleminated by
the latest development in the casting department at the Ana-
conda Company’s Great Falls reduction plant. A new mould will
cast a 2,400-pound zinc. slab, about four feet square and six
inches thick. The new large slab weighs about 44 times as
much as the 55 pound slab that —
has been traditional in the in-
dustry. ‘

The bottom side is formed
so that a fork lift can be slid
under it, and the cast also has
slots to permit lifting with a
chain hoist. The shape of the
slab is such that one layer fits
the floor of’a freight car and
loads it to capacity.

The new slab will eliminate
jobs in casting, handling,
stacking and handing, and in
bulkheading freight cars.

The new slab is being rapid-
ly accepted by fabricators, es-
pecially those with larger fur-
naces and facilities for han-
dling the new slabs. These

Joint negotiations were ‘con-
ducted in Torrington against
a background of business jour-
nal reports .on the prolonged
brass industry slump and pre-

‘dictions of worse business in

1961 than in 1960.

Wages were increased by‘ 12
cents an hour, with 6 cents ef-
fective last month and another
6 cents next July, 1961. An in-
crease of 3 cents is retroactive

to last July" 1, 1960. The 12 ,

cents per hour increase will be
directly reflected in improved
bonus earnings as a result of
the earlier agreement which,
for the first time, stipulated
that all across - the - board in-
creases must be reflected in
the bonus.

Health and Welfare improve-
ments include (an, increase in
hospital room-and board cov-

erage to $18 a day, and a raise

in sickness _and accident bene-
fits to $45.a week from the
previous $40 (Buffalo, under
its N.Y. state. sick and accident
coverage, gets’ up to $50).

The new ABC pension plan
increases. benefits to $2.35 a
month per year of service for
all employees (who were re-
tired after July 1, 1958; all e.m-
ployees retiring after July 1,
19605 receive $2.40 per month
for past years’ service and
$2.50 per month for future
service.

The contracts now expire on
a common date with the ‘rest

of the Anaconda locals, July 1,-

1962. The new short-term pen-
sion agreement -expires July 1,
