insurance for those railroa-ders who have alreadyilost their
jobs, as well as. substantial pensions for old workers. s
But the workers need and demand sti-ll more. They demand
that the displaced workers be put back to work again. And
a long step. in this direction will be the establishment of the
six-hour day on the railroads. Cashen and other reactionary
leaders, always careful not to offend the railroad corporations,
have been sabotaging for years this basic railroad demand,
while giving it lip service. Com-pare their long dilly-dallying
around on this question with the militant and successful stand
of the Big Four Brotherhoods for the Adamson eight-hour
law in 1916. i
The above is what I had to say in my pamphlet about the
dismissal wage agreement and" unemployment, Mr. Cashen.
And atleast 90 per cent of the workers in the railroad in-
dustry will agree with every word Iwrote. But you, like all

reactionaries, ‘do not dare to meet honestly my real proposi- '

tion. Your way is to twist and belie it and to try to kill
this progressive program with a campaign of Red-‘baiting
which serves only the interests of the railroad companies.

Amalgamation of Closely Related Crafts

One issue raised in my pamphlet, Railroad Workers For—_ ,

ward! that President Cashen is also very careful to misrepre-
sent is that of amalgamation. Every posted railroad worker
realizes that there is an urgent and immediate need for con-
solidating such closely related crafts as the Engineers and
the Firemen into one union, and also the Conductors, Train-
men and Switchmen _into another. Their constant quarrels
and conﬂicts are a source of weakness to railroad workers
generally, and their amalgamation would be a big step
forward. '
Time and again in the past thirty years the membership

of these unions have voted for amalgamation. But a number
of their ofﬁcials have -‘been instrumental in keeping them
apart. Especially has Mr. Cashen been areactionary inﬂu-
ence in this respect. While pretending to favor amalgama-
tion, he has always knifed it in the back. The reason for
this is twofold. First, -the railroad companies, to whose
wishes President Cashen is always very responsive, want
these workers ‘kept divided in order to defeat them all; and
second, Cashen and a handful of other conservative union
officials are afraid they will lose their jobs if these unions
are amalgamated. So these closely related crafts are kept
bickering and apart from each other, t-o the beneﬁt of the
companies and the detriment of the workers. And Cashen
tries to dispose of the whole matter by a blast of Red—bait-A
ing against me.

The Negro and the Railroad Unions A

Another issue I dealt with in my pamphlet, Railroad
Workers Forward! is the shameful practice on the railroads
of barring Negroes from trade union membership. This
means that they are not given the protection of the unions.
They work for the lowest wages and at the worst jobs;
their seniority rights are ignored; they are denied the right
of promotion; they are the ﬁrst ﬁred and the last hired when
jobs are scarce. And in many instances, as in the running
crafts in the North, they are ‘barred from work altogether.

This is a scandalous situation. It is a policy of treating
the Negroes as inferior human beings. It is a grievous in—
jury to the Negro people and also a harm to the white rail-
road workers. It is, furthermore, a violation of the National
Labor Relations Act and the Railroad Labor Act, which
guarantee to all workers, including Negroes, the right of
collective bargaining, which includes the right of union

II

   

membership. President Cashen is very careful not to mention
this disgraceful practice. This is because his union lbears the
disgrace of having a _]im—Crow “male, white person” clause
in its constitution barring Negroes from membership. The
basic principle of trade unionism is to admit all workers,
regardless of race, color, creed, sex or nationality. The
shameful system of discriminating against Negroes violates
this union fundamental, as well as the principles of American
democracy generally. It is contrary to the provisions of the
Constitution of the United States of America. It is a com-
pany-inspired policy, a stench in the nostrils of every pro=
gressive unionist and it must ‘be abolished. The Negro rail-
road workers must be granted the right of union member-
ship and full union protection; and they will be,’ despite
Mr. Cashen and other reactionary leaders.

Government Ownership oi the Railroads

Another proposal in my pamphlet is government owner-
ship of the railroads. This is becoming an increasingly burn-
ing issue. In my booklet I outline the basic conditions upon
which such government ownership can be brought about on
terms most advantageous to the workers, as follows:

“. . . revaluation of the railroads and the squeezing out of their
watered stock and bond values, reduction of bond interest and
stock dividend rates, reduction in the excessive salaries of top rail-
road executives, protection against loss of jobs through railroad
consolidation, and thoroughgoing guarantees of adequate wages,
six-hour day, right of trade union organization and participation
in the management of the industry for the workers.”

Now, I dare say, the overwhelming majority of railroad
workers will agree with these proposals. But not Mr. Cashen.
He is too solicitous of the companies’ interests for that.
The companies oppose such a plan of government ownership,

12

 

'. l

t I

 

and so, consequently, does Mr. Cashen and other reactionary
union leaders, who have their ears so attuned to the senti-
ments of the railroad executives. It is true that, when
pressed,- President Cashen will say he supports govern-
ment railroad ownership; but this is mere lip service,
just as in the case of the six-hour day. The true attitude of
such conservatives is seen in their traditi-onal many years’
ﬁght against nationalization of the railroads, their betrayal
and discarding of the Plumb Plan,'and their present-day
sabotage of the government ownership movement.

‘I also pointed out in my pamphlet that the ﬁnal solution
of the railroaders’ problem, as well as that of the workers,
farmers and middle class elements generally, could only come
through the establishment of socialism, as the ‘Communist
Party advocates. The basic meaning of the many wars, in-
dustrial crises, revolutions and counter-revolutions which we‘
see on all sides is that the capitalist system itself is decaying,
and is in the process of being supplanted by a new and higher
system of society, socialism. But, of course, Mr. Cashen, who
is totally innocent of any basic economic or political under-
standing, would not know anything about that. All he can
do is to denounce socialism, without in the least understand-
ing it. i

Trade Union Democracy

Still another issue raised in my much-attacked pamphlet,
Railroad Workers Forward! is that of the re—establishment
of trade union democracy in the railroad labor organizations.

Every railroad worker knows that democracy in the rail-
road unions is now at a very low ebb. With few exceptions,
the ruling ofﬁcialdom, using every bureaucratic trick, is self-
perpetuating. They go on in oﬂice endlessly like Tennyson’s
brook, until they either fall over from old age or quarrel
among themselves and thus oust each other. It takes almost

13

 

 

O

a rank—and-ﬁle earthquake to dethrone any of them. These
petty autocrats censor from the union journals all criticism
or views that do not agree with their own. They sign agree-
ments without even consulting the rank and ﬁle (as in the last
wage settlement). They load up the union conventions with

‘paid officials whose jobs are dependent upon their good will,

and those workers who object to su-ch practices are often
expelled from the unions and sometimes even ﬁred from the
industry. In short, the conservative leaders run the railroad
unions with the companies’ blessings and do pretty much as
they please, defeating rank-and-ﬁle wishes by a hundred
devices. i

All this, -of course, is highly detrimental to the unions and

' the interests of the railroad workers. Democracy is a good

thing, not only in political life, but especially in the trade

unions. The railroad unions are stiﬂed by the conservative,

dictatorial bureaucrats, of wh-om Cashen is a classical ex-
ample, The unions must be democratized, a free press insti-
tuted, representative conventions established, fresh blood
brought into the leadership and the rank and ﬁle given a
decisive voice in the formulation of «demands and the sign-
ing of agreements. Such democratization will give the unions
new life, greater vigor and a more progressive spirit. With
these sound proposals, I make bold to say, the vast majority
of railroad workers are in agreement, although the bureau-
cratic Mr. Cashen considers them stark Bolshevism.

‘Trade Union Unity

The present split between the A. F. of L. and C} I.O., is
a tragedy for the workers and only the bosses proﬁt fr-om it;
For this split the A. F. of L. Executive Council, of which
Mr. -Cashen, Mr. Wharton, Mr. Harrison, etc., are stout
supporters, is fully responsible. For many years the A. F.

14

 

of L., with its antiquated system of craft unionism, failed
totally to organize the steel, auto, rubber and other mass
production industries. And when a group of A. F. of L.
unions, under the leadership of John L. Lewis, formed a
committee (the C.I.O.) to undertake this work on an indus-
trial basis, as they were fully entitled to do under the A. F.
of L. Constitution, the A. F. of L. leaders, with Mr. Cashen’s
assistance, arbitrarily proceeded to expel them (I,0oo,000
members) and thus to split the labor movement. The A. F.
of L. top ofﬁcials also opposed by every means possible the

A - organizing campaigns of the C.I.O. Notwithsta_nding all this

disruptive w-ork, however, the C.I.O. is succeeding in its
task; the steel, auto, rubber, electrical manufacturing and
other mass production industries being either fully or partly
organized. '

Now there is the greatest urgency to unite the A. F. of L.
and C.I.O. This W-ould make a solid ‘labor movement of some
7,000,000 members and its power would be enormous. John
L. Lewis proposed a sensible plan for labor unity through
the C.I.O. unions afﬁliating in a bloc ‘to the A. F. of L.
and then adjusting all jurisdic-tional questions afterward.
But the A. F. of L. Executive Council bitterly opposes this
sane and proper proposal. Assisted by Cashen, Wharton,
etc., the Executive Council wants to split up the new indus-
trial unions, 4,000,000 strong, into craft unions. This crim-
inally stupid policy would surely destroy these unions and
would again surrender the mass production industries back
to the open sh-op, where they were when the *C.I.O. began
its work. '

One of the principal reasons why Mr. Cashen makes such
a bitter attack on my pamphlet, Railroad Workers Forward!
is because it exposes this disruptive policy of the Executive
Council and supports the Lewis plan of trade union unity.
The pamphlet stands for a great united labor movement, to

Is

‘ z
. ‘ 4 . 

include the A. F. of L., C.I.*O. and Railroad Brotherhoods.
And this is something, I am sure, the great mass of railroad’

workers want, despite the Red—'baiting ravings of Mr.
Cashen.

United Political Action

Still another reason why Mr. Cashen and other reaction~
ary railroad union leaders are assailing my pamphlet is be-
cause it urges upon the workers a program of united political
action. The workers, farmers, professionals and little busi-
ness people constitute the overwhelming majority of the
American people. They have basic interests in common and
they should solidly -organize -their for.ces politically against
their joint enemy, big business. The need for such organ-
ization is acute if the toilers are to be able to repel the
offensive of reactionary big business in this country, to re-
strain the fascist war—makers -on a world scale, and to pre-
serve and develop the democratic rights and living standards
of the American people. ‘

The way to bring about this united political action is by
cons-olidating the progressive forces in the Democratic and
Republican Parties and ‘by linking them up wi-th the trade
unions and such organizations as the American Labor Party,
Labor’s Non—Partisan League, etc., into one broad demo-
cratic front of workers, farmers, professionals, etc. This
wide movement of the toiling masses, embracing a great
majority of all voters and possessed of tremendous political
potentialities, would gradually develop in the direction of a
great F armer-Labor Party, an American People’s Front.

This is the policy of the ‘Communist Party and I advocate
it in my pamphlet. But Mr. Casheri does not like it, nor does
his railway owner friends. For years. the conservative union
leaders have been peddling the votes of the workers back
and forth between the two big capitalist parties to their own

16

i
i

l
:

proﬁt and to the workers’ undoing, and they wish to con-
tinue this practice. But the workers do not want this policy’;
they demand real political organization that will defend their
interests. f

Seventeen years ago the railroad workers took the lead
politically along these general lines by building up the great
Conference for Progressive Political Action. This promising
movement was broken up by reactionaries of the type of
Cashen. But the time is ripe for its rebirth on the new and
higher plane -of a "broad democratic front of all toiling
masses. The vitally important 1938 elections ‘will witness
important -developments in this respect, and all the Red-
baiting of Mr. Cashen and his fellow rea.ctionaries will not
be able to prevent it. Already, symptoms of the new pro-
gressive spirit among railroad workers can be seen in the
many local legislative conferences held in important rail-
road centers.

Some Lies Nailed

President Cashen, like reactionaries generally, instead of
discussing issues on their merits, descends to Red-baiting and
personal slander to accomplish his aims. In the foregoing I
have explained the true meaning of his attack on my pamphlet
and the nature of the proposals. he is seeking to defeat by
such devious methods. Now it remains for me to reply to at

least s-omeof the m.ore important of the many personal slan- 4
g ders an-d misrepresentations with which his article is literally A

crammed. Many of his falsiﬁcations, however, do not merit
reply, such as his fantastic assertion that I began to write
my ‘book about the 1919 steel strike before the strike ac-
tually took place. ’

Lie Number One: ‘Cashen says: “William Z. Foster can,-
not point to a single instance where wage—earners have
beneﬁted from following his advice or leadership,” and then

:-

1/

 

 

he violently assails my part in the great packing-house and
steel organizing campaigns and strikes of 1917-19.

The truth is that I was the ini-tiator and national secretary
of the big A. F. of L. federated campaign that organized the
national meat-packing industry in 1917, the ﬁrst mass pro-
duction industry ever unionized in this country. This move-
ment resulted in the recognition of the federated union, the
establishment of the eight—hour day, big Wage increases, and
a general betterment of conditions nationally throughout
this sweated industry. When I left'the packing industry
in the middle of 1918 to take up my duties in the steel organ-
izing campaign, the meat—packing, unions, 200,000 strong,
were practically I00 per cent organized all over the country.

On the basis of the great success of the organizing Work
in the packing industry, I was elected national secretary of
the big campaign of the twen-ty—three A. F. of L. unions to
organize the steel industry in 1918-19. This campaign, de-
spite the most serious ofﬁcial sabotage, organized 250,000
steel workers and it forced four 2% cents per hour wage
increases, the establishment of the basic eight—hour day and
the smashing of the twelve—hour day and seven-day week.
It also showed that the great steel industry could be organ-
ized in spite of all terror, spy systems, company unions, etc.
The 1919 campaign was the forerunner and trail blazer of
the successful C.I.O. 1937 campaign. And we would have
won the. great strike of 365,000 workers had the A. F. of L.
and railroad unions given this crucial struggle even a mini-
mum of support.

A Lie Number Two: ‘Cashen, with a complete distortion of
the facts, proceeds at length to condemn the holding of the
convention of the Communist Party at Bridgeman, Michigan,
in 1922, where a number of Communist delegates were ar-

rested and charged with violation of the state’s criminal‘

syndicalism law. Then Cashen says, in italics, in order to
' I8

 

cast a slimy insinuation against me: “It is significant that
Foster, one of the promoters of the mutiny, was never
brought to trial.”

This is a deliberate falsehood. The fact is I was the first of
the many defendants to be tried, with Frank P. Walsh as
my attorney. The trial at St. Joseph, lasting over a week
and resulting in a hung jury, attracted national attention.
Eventually, with the help of many trade unions and other
progressive organizations, the Communist Party w-on all
these cases, forcing the reactionary Republican state author-
ities to abandon their persecution altogether. President
Cashen’s studied misrepresentation of this situation is char-
acteristic of I thentone and contents of his whole article.

Lie Number Three: When Cashen says I failed to protect
the steel organizing committee in 1919 against a man whom
he knew to be a spy, he just adds one more lie t-o the many

others in his article. I presume he refers to one Beatty,

representative of the Stationary Firemen on our national
committee. I suspected this man and asked his international
union to withdraw him as their delegate, 'but this they re-

fused to do. So, on my own responsibility, I cut Beatty off

the mailing list for the commi_ttee’s minutes, used every
means to prevent his getting information, and never notiﬁed
him of the holding of our meetings. Several years later he
was exposed as a spy. As for Cashen, he never opened his
mouth then about the matter, evidently being quite accus-
tomed to work peacefully with racketeers and other corrupt
elements in A. F. of L. ofﬁcial circles. And even now Cashen
in his article does not venture to mention the name of the
spy in question.

Lie Number Four‘: One would think that President
Cashen would be ashamed to mention the 1922 national
shopmen’s strike, considering the strike-breaking role he
played in that crucial struggle. But as the old saying is, where

I9

 

angels fear, fools dare to tread. So he has the foolhardiness
and dishonesty to attack me about my part in the strike,
alleging that the Communists were trying to “create sus-
picion, discord and division, and frequently outright deser-
tion in the ranks of the strikers.” A

Now let us look at the facts. What did Mr. Cashen do in.

that strike and also what were our activities? Let’s see who
was trying to weaken the strike and who sought to strength-
en it.

Every old-time railroad worker knows that in the great
1922 strike the thing that defeated the shopmen was that
the engine, train and yard service unions. stayed at work.
The sentiment of the men in these unions was overwhelm-
ingly in favor of a strike. Had everybody walked out the
strike would have been victorious in a few days. But the
Cashens and the Lees and the other reactionary leaders of
the Brotherhoods fought against this tooth and nail. And
these railroad unions’ “chiefs,” with the active assistance of
the railroad companies, the capitalist press and the reaction-
ary Coolidge government, managed to force their men to
stay at work. In consequence, the shopmen lost their strike
and the railroad workers in every craft suffered a major
defeat. It was the worst case of union strike-breaking in
American labor history. '

That was the strike—breaking role of Cashen and Co. in

.1922. Now what was the Communist policy in this great

strike? We were for a united stand ‘by all railroad workers.
It was the only policy by which the great strike could be won.
Among others, I traveled all over the country, urging the
shopmen to stand ﬁrm and calling upon the S.U.N.A. and
the Brotherhoods to join the strike. ‘For this activity  was
arrested in Denver, held incommunicado by the state
police, illegally transported by them across the Wyoming
border, and ﬁnally dumped out on the road near the Ne-

20 ‘

 

braska line. This kidnaping caused such an outcry among
labor and progressive circles that it became a central issue
in the ensuing Colorado fall elections. Sweet, who defended
me against the Union Paciﬁc gunmen, was elected Governor
of Colorado and he abolished the state police for as long as
he was in ofﬁce.

At_the time of" the 1922 strike I did not hear of Mr.
Cashen being arrested or kidnaped by railroad company
thugs. On the contrary, Cashen, Bill Lee‘, Grable and the
other -conservative railroad union leaders were the darlings
of the railroad companies and the objects of their unstinted
praise as sane and sensible labor leaders. And well they de-
served such company praise, ‘because they broke the shop-
men’s strike. No, Mr. Cashen, I would not advise you to
say much about the 1922, strike.

The Communists and the Railroad» Union Leaders

My pamphlet, Railroad VI/orkers Forward! contains a
numiber of criticisms of the present policies of the union
leaders. This is because these policies do not correspond to
the interests of the railroad workers. Such criticism is
proper and_ necessary. But the Communists do n-ot limit
themselves merely to criticism. We also come forward with
programs that ﬁt the workers’ needs, as I have done in these
pages. We also support every step in defense of the work?
ers, regardless of who initiates it. Thus we are whole-

‘ heartedly backing the organizing campaigns of the standard

railroad unions on the railroads and of the C.I.O. in the
mass production industries’; we give our active assistance to
every A. F. of L. and C.I.O. strike; we seek to elect every
genuine progressive irrespective of what ticket he may be on;
we ﬁght for every piece of legislation favorable to the toilers
and as part of it the full legislative program of the standard
21

railroad unions, including the Crosser Six-Hour-Day Bill,
the Griswold-Brown Train Limit Bill, the Griswold Full-
Crew Bill, the Lonergan Safety Device Bill and the Mapes
Track andiBridge Inspection Bill. We also support the con-
servative railroad union leaders in -policies that beneﬁt the

workers, when these leaders make a real ﬁght for them. But‘

we must and do criticize them when their policies are wrong,
or when they sabotage sound policies.

V In conclusion, ‘I once again want to warn the railroad
workers not to be fooled by Cashen’s Red-‘baiting. Don’t let
the Red-Hbaiters throw dust in your eyes and thus blind you
to the machinations of y-our enemies, the railroad capitalists.
Keep your eye on the ball, not on the side-line clowning of
Cashen and other reactionary union ofﬁcia-ls. Especially is
this necessary at this time when there is the looming danger
of a wage-cut and further mass layoﬂ‘-s through consoli-
dations.  _ V

‘The companies have just been given $250,000,000 in rate
increases; but they want still more proﬁts. They are deter-
mined to get the wage-cut and reductions in working forces
if they can. An-d only the mass resistance of the workers can
prevent it. Did we not see ho-w the wage—cut was put across
the last time? First, the companies came out with a demand
for a cut twice as big as they expected to get. Then the rail-
road union leaders made a great show of resistance (as they

are doing now), ﬁlling the newspapers with militant state-V

ments that they would never, never accept a w'age~cut. But,
ﬁnally, when the rank and file thought their wage rates were

safe, the union leaders accepted a ‘compromise wage-cut‘

(which was about what the companies. planned from the
outset to get), put it into effect without letting the workers
vote on it, and then hailed it as a great victory. This must
not happen again. N-or should the workers allow the com-
panies to put through theirconsolidation mass layoffs in

Written by one of the greatest working class leaders in the United
States, this book traces the career of the Left Wing in the Ameri-
can labor movement during the twentieth century.

It is partly autobiographical, but in the main it is an impersonal
history of the rise and decline of syndicalism in the_ United States,
the origin and development of dual unionism and the boring-from-
within policy, as well as an account of the role of the Communists
in the trade unions. It is the work of a veteran organizer who has
always been in the thick of the industrial struggle of his time.

O WAGE-CUTS AND 1.AYo1-‘rs
r   ON THE RAILBOADS  

A Reply to President '1'. C. Cashen or the

Switchmen’s Union of North America
‘ BY WILLIAM z. rosn-*.n

N THE March number of the Swit-chmen’s Journal, Presi-
dent T. C. Cashen of the SWitchrnen’s Union of North
America publishes a long blast against me and my recent
pamphlet, Railroad Workers Forward 1* His article has been
copied far and wide in the railroad labor press.
Now what is the meaning of this artic1e——which is a col-
lection of misrepresentations, slanders and downright lies?
Experience teaches us the answer. When reactionaries want

to defeat a progressive movement they always come out _

with a Red—baiting campaign. By this means they seek to
confuse the workers and to break down their solidarity. It’s
a little trick they have learned from Hitler and iMussolini,
who, under cover of an attack upon the Reds, have de-
stroyed everything progressive in Germany, Italy and

l Austria.

On many occasions we have seeniAmerican reactionaries
use this fascist method. Thus in the I936_Presidentia1 ele-9-.

*Railroad Workers Forward.’ Workers Library Pub/li§hers,’ New
Yqrkz 1.0 cents: '

u

  

tions they denounced President Roos-evelt as a C01‘-nmunist;
in the 1937 New York elections they condemned LaGuardia
as a “Red,” and all the reactionary forces in the country

A (with -Cashen’s support.) are at present ﬁghting John L.

Lewis, head of the C.I.O., which organized 3,oo0,ooo'work—
ers, as a “Bolshevik.” Now the same Red-baiting tactics,
of which Cashen’s article against my pamphlet is an out-
standing example, are being used in the railroad industry.»

The reasons for this are obvious. To begin with the rank
and ﬁle of the railroad unions, disgusted with the bad con-
diti=ons on the railroads, that have resulted from stand-pat
union leadership, are beginning to demand a new deal in
their organizations. This is to be seen in many unions and on
many railroad systems. The members are insisting that the
railroad unions and their policies be modernizedand made
effective. The companies and their close friend labor leaders,
the Cashens, Jewells, Whartons, Harrisons, etc., are much
alarmed at all this. So they turn to the favorite trick of the
reactionary, .Red-baiting, in an effort to confuse and break
up the developing progressive spirit among the railroad
workers.

An immediate and sinister re_ason for this’ fresh outburst
of Red-baiting on the railroads is the demand of the com-
panies for a general wage—cut. Already their spokesmen are
shouting in the press that the railroad workers’ wages must
come down. There is grave danger the union heads will not
ﬁght against this. Did we not see in 1932 how the _railroad

"union leadership, without any struggle, accepted a. general

    

wage-.cut that ﬁnally cost the railroad workers $4-50,000,000,
and then these same leaders boast-ed that it was the greatest
victory in the history of the American labor movement?
Such Red-baiting attacks as iCashen’s‘ ﬁt right in with the
present plans of the railroad owners for wage-cuts and mass
lay-oﬁfs ‘through consolidations. They hav-e the effect of

4

 

breaking the resistance of the workers and thus opening
theway for a general reduction in railroad wages and work-
ing forces. '

But the Red-baiters are 11ot having things as easy as they
onc-e did. The workers see more and more clearly that every
reactionary, whether it is a Hitler, or an American open-
shopper, or a Cashen, has Red—baiting as his main stock in
trade, and hence the workers are not now so easily fooled.
Thus, in-the above-cited cases of Roosevelt, LaGuardia and
Lewis, the masses saw through the wiles of the Red-‘baiters
and defeated them. And so it will be on the railroads; the
Red-baiting of Cashen will be a dud.

President «Cashen, in the manner of conservatives gen-
erally, does not discuss the issues raised in my pamphlet,
Railroad Workers Forward! He does not dare to consider
them on their merits. Instead, he indulges in a general smear
of denunciation, hoping thereby that the real issues will be
beclouded and thus lost sight of by the workers. Let me,
however, nail him -down toa few facts.

Amend the Railway Labor Act

President Cashen states that I propose to destroy the
Railway Labor Act. This is a deliberate lie. What I urged
in my pamphlet was that: “This law should be changed to
strike out all its semi-compulsory arbitration features.”
That is, the right to strike should ‘be restored to the rail-
road unions. ’

As it is now, the Railway Labor Act, with its interminable
delays and virtually compulsory arbitration, deeply cuts into
the unions’ strike "right. When the railroad unions take a

strike vote now nobody considers‘ it seriously: notthe gov— A

ernment, not the companies, not the workers, ‘and least of

.all the union officials. Everybody knows that the dispute,

5

  

if it is a serious one, will be ﬁnally shunted off for settle-

ﬂ ment to some more or less hostile committee.

 

This undermining of their strike right constitutes a serious
weakening of the railroad unions. ’Every labor organization
must jealously guard its right to strike, while atthe same
time, as I say in my pamphlet, it must “use the strike_ right
judiciously and intelligently.” No sincere person ‘wants a
reckless strike policy. But the historical case "of the passage
of the Adamson Eight—Hour Law in 1916 by a threat of
the Big Four Brotherhoods to s-trike was a brilliant demon-
stration of the importance of unions maintaining their strike
right. When unions are restricted in their right to strike, as
under the Railway Labor Act, a large part of their bargain-
ing power is lost. President Cashen and similar conservative
union officials have surrenderedthis basic right. .

The union-crippling character of the Railway Labor Act
is emphasized by the fact that at present the marine unions,
with the support of Secretary of Labor Perkins, are militant-
ly ﬁghting against the employers’ attempts to introduce its
anti—strike principles into the shipping industry. President
J. -Curran of the National Maritime Union says: “One of
the «provisions in" the proposed legislation is to create ma-
chinery, similar to the Railway Mediation Boar-d, f-or the
shipping industry . . . it would limit the union’s right to
strike in i.ts own defense.” In connection with the employers’
attempt to force the Railway Labor Act system upon the
marine workers, Miss Perkins said: “I am also constrained
to question the wisdom of establishing a ﬁxed arbitral pro-
cedure looking forward to award-s having the effect of law.”

President Cashen insultingly states that the railroad com-

‘panies would pay handsomely for my proposals regarding

the Railway Labor Act. B-ut such libels require little answer.
If thecompanies are paying out money or favors, it certainly
is not to people who are defending the full right of the work-
‘ 6

 

 

ers to strike, but to those who, whether by means of the

Railway Labor Act or otherwise,’ are restricting that right.

The Railway Labor Executives’ Association or a
General Railroad Federation?
Cashen further wrongfully declares in his article that I

propose to destroy the Railway. Labor Executives’ Associa-
tion, and that any man who can accomplish that “can name

his own price for the deed and it will be paid without a -

murmur” by the “hard-boiled” railroad companies.

This is libelous slander and a deliberate misrepresentation.
What I proposed was that the twenty--one standard railroad
labor organizations should be linked together into a power-
ful, a1l—embracing railroad union federation.’ Every railroad
worker knows that under the present union set-up the unions
lose enormously in power by being separate and divided.
And for years the railroad companies and their good friends,

such labor leaders as Cashen, have sought to perpetuate‘

this division by ﬁghting against every movement for federa-
tion and amalgamation.

The Railroad Labor Executives’Association does not cor-
rect this division in the railroaders’ ranks. It is only a loose
grouping of quarreling, jealous top ofﬁcials; not a solid,
well-knit organization,‘ such as is imperatively needed. Did we
not see in the recent wage demands that the operating and
non-operating unions under the R.L.E.A. conducted separate
negotiations, thereby weakening the power of the workers
generally, with one group of unions compromising the others’
demands? And if it had come to a strike there would have
again been the shameful spectacle of 1922, with several
unions striking while the rest of them stayed at work. The
only cure for this stupid craft division is to link all the
twenty-one standard unions together into a powerful fed-

7

 

  

eration that would stand as one unit and ﬁght for one gen-
eral national railroad agreement. ‘ '

Such a broad, democratically organized federation of all
railroad unions, besides being more powerful, would also be
far more representative and protective of the workers’ in-
terests than the handful of high-paid top union ofﬁcials who
comprise the R.L.E.A. VVith such a federation in existence
we would not be confronted‘ with the charges, unfortunately
true, of President Whitney o-f the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, to the effect that the R.L.E.A. “circumscribes its
activities by carrier limitations.” f

The foregoing is what I proposed regarding the R.L.E.A. ;
the joining of all'the railroad unions into one powerful
federation. And, furthermore, the overwhelming mass of
railroad workers would agree with me if they could vote
upon the matter. Yes, even the majority of Cashen’s own
union. That is why Cashen does not dare to meet the issue
fairly and squarely, by stating honestly my proposal of an
all—inclusive railroad federation. His recourse is that of the
reactionary: lies, slanders and Red-baiting, in the hope that
thereby the true issues will be kept hidden from the rank
and ﬁle of the railroad unions.

Unemployment and‘ the Six-Hour Day

A real tragedy to railroad workers is the criminal indif-
ference with which the -conservative railroad union lead-ers
of the caliber of President Cashen have mishandled the
question of unemployment. Although leading powerful
unions, they sat around for years, doing nothing, While the
railroad companies drove over 1,000,000 workers out of the
industry into the ranks of the poverty-stricken unem-

‘ployed, thus reducing the total number of railroad workers

from over 2,000,000 in 1920 to less than 1,000,000 in 1938.

The conservative leaders did not even ﬁght for relief for
these workers during the crisis, as u-p until only two or
three years ago Mr. Cashen and other “grand chiefs” were
running all over the country telling the workers (while em-

. ployers enthusiastically applauded them) that unemployment

insurance was an insult to the workers and would destroy
the trade union movement.

It was only after 1,000,000 workers had been displaced
from the industry that these ofﬁcials came forward with
their so-called “dismissal wage” agreement; Far from being
a protection to the workers, this agreement, by peddling
away for a pittance the workers’ right to work, is a direct
encouragement to the companies to make still further lay-
offs through consolidations, etc. It eases the workers out of
the industry and cheaply relieves the companies of all re-
sponsibility for them. Everybody knows that such displaced
workers cannot ﬁnd work in other, also overcrowded, in-
dustries, but Mr. Cashen, safe with his big salary, is not
worried over their unhappy fate. After foisting this miser-
able agreement upon the workers, he and his well-paid
friends have the brass to call it a great victory (even as they
did the 1932 wage cut) and to denounce me for criticizing it.

The progressive railroad workers want a stop put to the

_policy of driving workers out of the railroad industry and

into destitution-—a policy initiated by the companies and
condoned by such reactionary union leaders as Cashen,
Phillips, Jewell, Wharton, etc. The workers are bitterly
opposed to any consolidations or coordinations that will

-further reduce the number of railroad jobs, whether these

reductions in forces are suga.r-coated with “dismissal wages”
or not. This reduction of forces issue is all the m-ore urgent
in view of the plan now before Congress to consolidate all
the railroads of the United States into seven great systems.
The workers also want adequate relief and unemployment
