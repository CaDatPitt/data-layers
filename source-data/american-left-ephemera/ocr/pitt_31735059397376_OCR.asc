Who is James Johnson? James Johnson is you and me. James Johnson is the oldest of
seven children in his family. Those closest to him have always known him to be a gentle
person, very thoughtful person. He has always looked after the welfare of his family. In
search of a better life for himself, James was still in his teens when he left Mississippi for
the industrial jungle of Detroit. Here he lived with his uncle, wh‘o was able to persuade
him to finish school. And so he did, and each day James would travel from Mt. Clemens
High to his after school job at St. Joseph’s Hospital. Always one to depend upon his own
resources, he worked as a kitchen helper there so he could support himself until his
graduation in 1955. After graduating he spent two years in the Anny, whereupon he
received an honorable discharge and returned to Detroit. But Detroit of the late fifties
and early sixties offered a particularly hard life for Black people. As has always been the
case in the United States, what was classified as a “recession” for white workers during
this period, proved to be a real depression for Black workers. Finally after months of
searching, James found work at the Selfridge Air Force Base cafeteria. For the following
three years that passed, he worked in the cafeteria for a paltry $35 a week. Like most
Black workers, James had to sacrifice a lot of little enjoyments just to make ends meet.
But out of his meager salary he somehow managed to save for the home he was to
purchase later. Not one to ever forget his family, however, he regularly sent money back
home to his mother down South. In this way, some of his brothers and sisters were able
to finish their education.

The recession began to level off during the sixties, but the cost of living continually
rose. Like so many other Black workers, James searched for better wages and working
conditions. And he continued to save for that house he wanted so badly. But he never
forgot his family, or people less fortunate than he. His youngest sister recalls how he
would often help people on the street not because he knew them, but because he was just
that way. If he thought that any cause would help someone, if only a little, he would
support it in any way he could. This is how James Johnson is.

James johnson is not a wordly man, but he is a man of honor, a gentle man, a man
with pride, a man with respect for himself and his fellow men. He is an exceptionally
quiet man one who usually keeps to himself. He is not a man whom you would generally
see at parties or in bars. A man who, until now, was without violence in his life. But what
cicumstances caused a man, much like you and me, a man known for his extreme
kindness, to now be charged with the shooting deaths of three men?

James Johnson had been employed at Eldon Avenue Gear and Axle Plant for two
years. Like other Black workers there, he had to put up with the daily harassments by
racist foremen, the lack of proper safety conditions, and the backbreaking and dangerous
work. In addition, James was singled out for special harassment because of the fact that
he rarely laughed or smiled while on the job. He would be put on certain jobs and given
no instruction. Then the foremen would stand around watching him, hoping that he
would make a mistake so that they could fire him. But James rarely, if ever, made
mistakes on the job. So the supervisors evidently decided that since he was not dumb, he
must be a potential troublemaker, and they kept him under constant surveillance.

In May of 1970, James was involved in an automobile accident. His car was a total
loss, and the back, neck, and head injuries which he suffered as a result of the accident,
caused him to undergo treatment twice a week. Because of the seriousness of his injuries,
James Johnson’s doctor advised him not to go back to work. When James went to get his
insurance papers and to tell Chrysler Corporation details of these injuries, he was sent to
an over-crowded “Industrial Clinic” where he was hardly even examined. And, in the
same way that Chrysler did Sister Mamie Williams, which by ordering her off her hospital
bed sent her to her death, they sent James a telegram ordering him back to work
immediately. They refused to give him disability payments for the ﬁve days he was off
the job. Then they sent him a registered letter stating that his insurance had been
cancelled. From that time on, he was forced to work without any insurance whatsoever.

But James Johnson is you and me. What drove James Johnson to the breaking point?

James was scheduled for vacation on June, 1970. The date was posted on the bulletin
board. On May 29, which was a Friday, James had “his” foreman sign his time card, and

left on vacation after work. When he returned to work on schedule, he noticed that his
time card had been pulled from the rack. When he asked the foreman why, the foreman
would just shrug his shoulders and walk away. James was forced to work for
approximately one month without a time card. One racist forema_n had the nerve to
continually ask James why he didn’t go home, since he didn’t have a time card. Bllt.Jal.I1(:S
knew that if he went home, they would surely fire him. And so he stayed, and his time
card finally “reappeared”. But 32-gnies Johnson is not a violent man. What drove James
Johnson. to the point of temporary insanity?

Finally, on July 15, 1970, James Johnson was pushed to the wall. Because he was not
provided with proper safety gloves, and for that reason refused. to work the oven, James
was charged with “insubordination” and fired. The kind of hfe which forced him to
scrimp and save his hard earned quarters and dollars so that he could buy the home he
always wanted, the ﬁnancial support of his family, for which he had taken a
responsibility since his teens; the refusal by racist plant foremen to upgrade hnn, because
he didn’t buck cance or grin each time they passed; the constant harassment. The
inlnimane conditions of work . . . . And, in a manner which all of us oppressed by the
foul. racist machinery of Capitalism, are capable, of being driven, James Johnson was
pushed -to the breaking point.

That is why all of us, and not just James Johnson,-are on trial beginning April 26. And
that is why all of us in turn must put Chrysler ‘on trial that_day, put the sellout UAW on
trial, must put the vicious system of Capitalist exploitation on trial, must put U.S.
“homegrown” racism and imperialism on trial. We cannot afford any more James
Johnson’s to be “judged” and sentenced by the same racist dogs who daily push the
James Johnson in us to the breaking point.

JAMES JOHNSON HAS DARED TO STRUGGLE. LET US ALL DARE TO HELP HIM WIN.
