holds steady

Non-ferrous metal markets neld

';-steady during the past two weeks as

producers anxiously awaited some hint
as to what the new “stockpile objec-

tives” would mean in terms of actual’

purchases of metals.

‘ Demand for copper was uiiiisually
strong. Custom smelters, by the end of

A’ April, reported that their supply of

copper for May delivery was practically
sold out. Scrap copper, used by custom
smelters, was also scarce and moved up
1/; cent a pound in price. _

The White House, in'the meantime,
gave little definite iiifor-mation on the
new stockpile program. Through Ar-
thur S. Flemming, director of the Of-
fice of Defense Mobilization, it re-
leased answers to a number of ques-
tions on the program asked by Senator
Murray (D., Mont.). Flemming said, in
essence, that the new policy provides

..for giving preference to metals and

minerals. of domestic origin, but that
they haven’t yet worked out how this

I ‘ .is to be done. In some cases, he said,
the government would buy metals on‘

the open market. In othercases, spe-

‘cific contracts may be -used. '

Flemming also stated that every ef-

. fort will be made to eliminate “avoid-

able fluctuations “in stockpile objectives
and in acquisition programs.”

All of which adds up to the fact that‘

producers now know .as little about
what to expect as they knew before.

fights grievances

GILMA_N, Colo.—The grievance com-
mitee of Local 581 met last "week with

,New_Jersey Zinc, on problems of work-

ing conditions in the mine here. Mem-
bers of the grievance committee in-
cluded Brothers Joe Chavez, Walter

- Duran, and Intll Reps. J_oe Lopez and

Clint J encks.

A A vigorous p r o't e st was made _,

against the practice of foreman oper-

.. ating motors. The Company agreed to

put a stop to this practice. ,

The committee also asked that help-
ers «be assigned to work with the mo-
torman on all motors. _ . '

THE COMMITTEE pointed out that
contract miners have o‘b'jected.to the
practice‘-of foremen ordering. them ,to

. unload the timber, pull chutes and spot

cars, because shift bosses have not
been giving full company-time credit
for time spent on this off-contract

' _Work; the result being that the time

lost meant money lost to thelminer.

‘On. the matter of seniority. lists, the
company‘ agreed -.to furnish the griev-
ancecommittee copies of the seniority’
lists, so that grievancemen can see that

rules of seniority are lived up to at all _
it times. ‘ ’

labor   legislative conference

TONOPAH, Nev.~—A statewide cam-
pai-gn for repeal of Nevada’s “right—to-
work” law was launched here May 2 at
a meeting of Labor’s United Legisla-
tive Board. -

Taking part were representatives of
Mine-Mill,‘tlie State AFL, United Mine
Workers, Steelworkers, Sheet Metal
Workers and Brotherhoods of Train-
men, Engineers and Firemen. Of 51
delegates, nine’ represented Mine-Mill

, locals. -

The conference agreed on endorse-
ment of several candidates in the Dem-
ocratic primary, including James
(“Sailor”) Ryan for Lt. Governor.

Ryan is president of the Nevada Fed--

eration of Labor, AFL, __and has served
five terms in the State Assembly,
where bills sponsored by him in 1953
increased the occupational disease and
death benefits for miners to $7,500, in-
creased the minimum wage for women
to 75 cents and raised unemployment
compensation. In 1945, he led a fight to

for relief  

I SPRINGFIELD, Ill.—A «Mine-Mill
delegation of 17 from locals in Chi-
cago, Danville, Fairmont-East St. Louis
and Peru met with Governor William
Stratton last month. They urged the
calling of a special sessionofthe leg-

' islature to act on higher unemployment

insurance, a state "public works pro-

gram, a fair ‘employment practices law.

and higher old age benefits.
The delegates reported on unemploy-
ment and suffering in their areas. They

emphasized that when unemployment \

strikes, the Negro and other minority

' groups, having been the last hired are

the first fired, first to run out of un-
employment insurance and the first to
be forced on relief rolls. They said more
than half of those laid off at Mine-Mill
shops in Chicago were"Negroes.
MINE-MILL delegation re-
ceived from the Governor his assurance
that he favored increased unemploy-
ment insurance. After the session,
Stratton called a press conference to
make his_position public, his first public
commitment on the subject.

Our uiiion’s spokesmen presented pe-
titions of about 1,000 signatures. Sev-

historic strike victory  
DANVILLE, Ill. —— Mine-Mill Local 209 won a history-making

victory here after a tough 9-month strike against Hégeler Zinc Com’-
pany. The settlement was enthusiastically- and unanimously adopted

— by the 'me\mbersl1ip.
The agreement provides:

CA1: immediate 91/1-cent wage. increase, retroactive to July 1, 1953.
0 Guaranteed vacations with 6 paid holidays.

0 An additional 5c across the board on July: 1, 1955.

0 Clothes and shoes to be furnished by the -company in various de-

partments.

.0 A health and welfare plan to protect workers for 90 days‘in‘-case
of a strike, and ﬁvmonths in case of a layoff. . A i
The new contract is in effect until June 30, 1956. ‘

L‘ ,- THIS WAS a long strike and a remarkable one. Not only  the

to give .a resounding, defeat to two

raiding unions, the AFL Teamsters.

and the _AFL Auto work\ers‘.' There
. was constant redbaiting from every»

‘angle, including. the local so—called‘la-.

bor press. Despite all this, the picket
line was manned‘ 24 hours a day,. 7'
* . days a week. ,Not a scab entered the-
V ‘ plant. w
I Thecompany used its influence to
try to get railroad workers. ‘to’ take
cars into the plant, but. not one car
entered. The railroad unions-‘and their
rank and file cooperated 100%
the strikers. I ‘

There was excellent cooperation from
Mine-Mill Locals 449, 808, and /854, as‘
well as from AFL and CIO unions in

 -the area in contributing financial and

' ‘moral support to the strikers. Not one

“This attack on our Union, particu-

ECIO leaders criticize  

SIOUX CITY, Iowa——-Two top CIO
leaders joined here last week inicalling V
critical attention to the present foreign
policy of the United States as they ad-
dressed the United Packinghouse Work-
ers’ convention. I

John Riffe, vice-president of the CIO,
criticized the‘ tendency of the United
States to force countries which receive
U. S. aid to conform to political and’
economic policies advanced by the
United States.

l“Every country should be left‘ to
work out its own destination,” he said.

President
UPWA told the -delegates that “abstract
talk of freedom is not a positive policy”
in the battle for Asia.

He continued:«“It is difficult to con-
ceive how -Secretary of State Dulles:

and Vice-President Nixonrcan be so‘

reckless as to bring us to the brink of
war without a program which can pos-
sibly win to our side the people of these
countries. is this the product of sheer
blindness? Or is it the same kind of

blindness which .characterizes the do- ‘
' mcstic policy of this ad‘ministi'atio-n?”

7 Both Rifgfe and Helstein referred to.
the current Army-McCarthy hearings.

Ralph Helsttein of the ,.

 ‘     I.

 U. S. Indo-China policy

Riffe called for President Eisenhower

' to come out and declare himself against

McCarthy: _
Helstein said: “The Senator should

I be on trial before the bar of public

opinion, but he is not being tried for

this real offense. He is a symbol of a

force for evil without; parallel‘ in its

- dangers to our national welfare.”

Holstein ridiculed descriptions of the
current business slump as a “corrective
process.” “We see nothing ‘corrective’

about three and a half million unem-A

ployed workcrs. We see nothing cor-
rective about a process that‘ leaves
dozens of American communities feel-
ing great social distress as is result of
the spread in unlemployment, loss of
overtime pay and reductions in the
regular work-week.’’ . 

Riffe told the delegates that they
“can’t expect anything from this ad-
ministration because it’s headed" and
guidedby Big Business.” He called for
a national program of spending for
construction of highways,‘ schoolsanll
hospitals. 4 .

~The convention endorsed a proposal
calling‘ for elimination of the female
