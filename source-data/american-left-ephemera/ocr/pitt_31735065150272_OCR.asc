  ’ y-DENVER —_ Mine - Mill’s
7'. International Executive

board met at the Cosmo-
politan hotel here on Jan.

...'.15,'16, and 17 and spent,

 nearly the entire three days

‘exploring the likely areas of
@1959 contract negotiations. Re-
serving‘ for its pre-convention

e-jmeeting in San Francisco any

,_'_._vv,ijll recommend in the way of
'7 -5a collective, bargaining pro-
.:  ‘ram, the Board nevertheless

._;“"lopted a declaration that the
g J union this V year “will again

' seek greater income and job
-. security for its members.”

Before adopting its state-

 _ment,, the IEB had held a
. discussion on a wide variety

#0: needs arising out of the
‘ period of the three-year agree-
“ments, which expire in major
“sections of the industry next

I . June 30. Reports were given

to the board by Research Di-
-rector‘ Bernard W. Stern, In-
"surance Consultant Paul Pin-

sky, and General Counsel Na--

than Witt.

;An indication of the union’s
‘temper in, this -year’s negotia-
Vtions was contained in the flat
“our major

to dictate, will be—more pay,

--elimination of wage inequities,

greater .job security, better

 health and welfare programs,

improved security of job ten-

.- ure, and more adequate pro-

tection against the many

 ‘abuses and contract violations

that have occurred in the past

I two years.”
 '6 RECESSION HARSI-I
~ . ’: The board statement ex-

f_;-amined the economic condi-
‘~ti0n of the companies as fol-
’ lows:

“The worst postwar reces-

I Ksion in this industry, has been

‘especially harsh on nonfer-
rous metal workers—wide-
spread unemployment, with
‘over one-third of lead and
zinc and nearly 25 per cent of

 ’ copper workers laid off; short

‘ workweeks; ’
- -sive violations of contracts,
‘ and the constant erosion of

speedup; exten-

jobs by new machines and the
contracting-out of work

"covered by our contracts.

“Throughout this p e r i 0 d,
the companies, while suffering
some decline in income, have
continued to operate at - a
profit—a profit maintained
through» layoffs and speedup.
The prospects are for far
greater profits in 1959. That
‘now seems assured by the re-
covery in prices and produc-

and by sharply reduced labor

Convention Agenda  

DENV-ER—Coll-ective bargaining and constitutional . ‘A
amendments will head the list of important jobs to be
tackled by the delegates to the 54th Convention of the
International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

The convention, marking the 66th anniversary of

the union, will open Mon-
day, March 16, at the Belle-

vue hotel in San Francisco. It

is expected to run the entire

week.

The largest single task of
the convention will be to for-
mulate a wage and contract
policy to guide local unions in
negotiations this year. The his-
toric three-year agreements
with the major sections of the

MINE-Mll.l.’S 54th Convention will
open Monday, March I6 at the

And lniure AsburyeHoward  

(SPECIAL TO MINE-MILL UNION)
BESSEMER, A1a.—Because
he leads a movement to assist

Negro citizens to register and ‘

vote, International Vice-Presi-
dent Asbury Howard of the
Mine, Mill and Smelter Work-
ers was severely beaten here
on Jan. 24‘ by a racist mob
numbering 40 to 50 white men
who attacked him in the city
hall. The union leader was
painfully injured, at least 110
stitches being required to
close a head wound.

Armed with blackjacks,
knives, and other weapons,
the mob assaulted Vice-Presi-
dent Howard following a trial
in which he was convicted in
City Recorder’s court on a
charge of “breach of the
peace.” He is president of the

Bessmer Voters le a g u e, in

which capacity he was arrest-
ed after he had ordered a sign

trated, with a cartoon from-

the Kansas City Call. It’s prin-

cipal legend read: “Vote To-'

day for a Better Tomorrow.”
Howard was told: “You can
say that, but you can’t write
it.” The Mine-Mill leader has
appealed the $100 fine and six-
month jail sentence.
CLARK STATEMENT
Following a long-distance
telephone conversation with
his fellow officer, Mine-Mill’s
International President John
Clark said in Denver:
“There seems to be little
doubt that this shocking at-
tack’ on a respected citizen
and community leader was
well-planned. Brother Howard
has filed a complaint with the
Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion that his civil rights have
been violated. Our union cer-

 -I - SUDBURY, Ont. — The re-

s t r i k e a t t h e International

 Nickel company operations in
F -',CaI_1ada proved many things
. I ‘aboutour membership, but in

my opinion the most outstand-

I  ing of these was the absolute
. confidence the nickel workers
»‘.have in their union.

-proved that despite years of

 ianti-union propaganda and ac-

; V tivity not even a three-months’

 shake this confidence.

I g 1 __ Another, and equally signifi-
Icant ‘outcome, was the fact

  
    
 
  

 whenthe issues are clear,
wh‘e'n_ithe battle is cle arly

_  between wo'rker and
;-emp_l"oyer, deeply.-imbedded in-

stincts of unity of the working
people find their way‘ to the
surface and wash away years
of effort 1 to weaken and de-
stroy this unity. Despite the
sustained efforts of some in-
dividuals and groups inside
and outside the labor move-
ment to isolate our union,
when the battle was joined, the
labor movement came to our
support so overwhelmingly
that one of the largest mining
corporations in the world was
forced to come to terms. And
this in spite of the fact that
throughout the strike condi-
tions generally favored the
company rather than the un-
ion. .
WIDE SUPPORT

And still another revelation,
one which is very heartening
because of the promise it holds

with him was a white Sign

Solski Tells How Inco Strike

for the future, was the fact

that our strike against Inco I

won the support of broad sec-
tions of the population—sec-
tions not even indirectly con-
nected with our union or other
segments of the labor move-
ment. In the strike localities
themselves, the company failed
utterly to mobilize the busi-
ness andprofessional commu-
nity against the union, while
throughout the country a vi-
cious press campaign had lit-
tle discernible effect.

It was quite clear then that
we need not fear any lack of
unity within our own ranks;
that there is indeed a powerful
groundswell of unity among
workers of all unions which
should make more effective

our efforts to achieve organi-
, zational unity with them, and,

finally, that the so-called “pub-
lic,” by no stretch’ of the ima-
gination, has been won over
to the side of the corporations.

But now, a brief summary of
the strike itself.
BACKGROUND

Official Canadian govern-
ment policy, enunciated short-
ly after the coming to power
of the Conservative party last
year, called upon industry to
“hold the line,” to refuse to
concede wage increases on the
spurious grounds that such in-
creases would generate infla-
tion. Inco interpreted this poli-
cy to mean not only “holding
the line” but to push it far
back. The company not only
refused justified wage de-
mands, but pushed back the
living standards of their em-

gaining on new agreements

will be taking place long be-.

fore then. Considerable inter-
est in the union’s bargaining
outlook has been evinced ;for

several months by local unions

throughout the country.

        

< _’_, -:71

Inflated living costs are one  .

reason, of course. Another is
the epidemic of grievances
which have arisen out of the
profit promotion tactics of sev-
eral companies which have led
to speedup, weakening of safe-

ty requirements, contracting’.

out of work traditionally as-
signed to regular employees,
and intensified assaults on
other contract provisions. A
major concern is unemploy-
ment and job security. '
AMENDMENTS

Up for consideration by this
year’s convention will be a se-
ries of amendments to modern-
ize the union constitution in
line with the resolution adopt-
ed by last year's Denver con-
vention and the enabling
amendments adopted in a ref-
erendum this year. The consti-

tutional amendments by con- “
vention action, of course, do

not affect traditional demo-
cratic safeguards in such fields
as dues, union finances, ref-
erendum votes, and rank-and-
file election of officers. These
activities and policies still will
be governed by secret referen-

dum vote as they have been 

since 1893.

The Denver convention, res-
olution authorized the Inter-
national Executive board to of-'
fer amendments this year
which will be acted upon by
the San Francisco delegates. A
board committee has had sev-
eral meetings on the subject
throughout the year.

The metals crisis and the

condition of the industry will ' 

come in for much discussion
and action at the convention
also. Stepped-up Mine-Mill’ leg-
islative activity not only will
deal with this subject, but
with every proposal adopted by
the’ Executive board at its
meeting a month ago in Chica-
go, plus all resolutions on leg-
islative matters presented by
local unions. ' ’

Other subjects expected to
occupy the delegates’ time this

A new agreement, topping
other zinc settlements in the
same area, was signed last
month by Fairmont Smelter
Workers No.82 with American
Zinc company .at ‘East St.
The new one-year
renewing
the old one which expired
June 30, 1958, provided for a

,.-general wage increase of 6

[cents an hour effective on Jan.
1, 1959, with 5 cents of this
pay raise retroactive to June
30, 1958. The agreement called
for the six months of back pay
to be received by the workers
on Jan. 29, 1959. Common la-
bor rate under the new in-
crease is now $2.06 per hour.
Int’l Rep. .J. R. Van Camp

increase if and when the -price

tract settlement partially tied
to the price of zinc was -signed

Thank You!

Mine-Mi1I’s Canadian Execu-

It-ive Board last month extend-

ed “sincere appreciation” to
the union’s U. S. membership

- for their -great support of the

INCO strike at Sudbury and
Port Colborne. A letter ad-
dressed to all U. S. locals and
«auxiliaries said:

“One of the major factors
contributing to the victory of

.our Union over the Interna

‘-tional Nickel Company was “the

4 -all-out effort behind the strike

    

by our U. S. Brothers and Sis-

, ters.

“This support, together with
the Dominion-wide aid of the

labour movement in Canada,-

.and the contributions of Un-
ions in other parts of the
world, plus the fighting spirit
and determination of the strik-
ers themselves, enabled our
Union to inflict the first de-
feat i-n .a strike on the eastern
Canadian Mining Association.

“The support received from
our Brothers and Sisters -in
the United States is a true ex-
ample of international solidar-
ity and living proof that Cana-
dian workers can enjoy auton-
omy within the International
Union without weakening the
fraternal bonds that exist be-
tween -the workers in our in-
dustry.”

CIVIC Award

Butte Miners Union No. 1,
winner of the first John Clark
Award for Civic Achievement
at last year’s convention, has
decided not to enter this year’s
competition in order to leave
the field free for other locals.
A letter addressed to the
Award Committee signed by
Local 1 Financial Secretary
W. D. Dougherty says:

“Inasmuch as
Miners Union No. 1 won the
initial John Clark Award, we
shall not submit -our entry -in
the 1959 contest. We feel -that
the program this award signi-
fies is a worthy one, and our
decision is based on the fact
that many locals are deserv-
ing of the award, but their
-opportunity to win might be
diminished by reason of our
new activities in the commu-
nity added to our _continued
maintenance of the community
work which won the award -for
us last year. It is our .belief
that the winner in any given
year should not make applica-
tion for the award the follow-
ing year.”

Bonne Terre

President A. C. Thomas of
Valley Dolomite Workers No.
618 in Bonne Terre, Mo., re-
ports a serious on-the-job acci-
dent in which a union ibrot-her
was badly hurt. Lester San-
‘asac, of Flat -River, suffered
severe and painful" injury to
his eyes and face Jan. 2 when
gases that had accumulated 
a clinker tank and -an aelevattor
exploded, causing a bl'OW-ib'a'C‘Ik
of clinkered dolomite and de-
bris. Sanasac was first taken
to the Bonne Terre hospital,
then rushed to -the 
hospital in St. Louis. Th;omas
reports that “there is no way
of telling at this time 
much“ damage has “been done
to Brother Sanasac’s eye.”
However, the doctors say that
he will regain the sight in the
most seriously damaged eye,
and is expected to return home
soon.

Thomas also expresses ap-
preciation for the memoran-
rdum -on ‘ unemployment insur-
ance recently prepared and
sent to all locals "by the Mine-
Mill Research department. “I
am sure,” he says, “it will help
in our legislative -program.”

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

  Mine Bureau Report Shows

Need for cl U.S. Safety Law

DENVER——Mine-Mill’s long fight for a federal metal mine safety law similar to one
already in existence for coal mines was given added ammunition recently by an agency

of the government itself.

A study by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, quoted in the December-January issue of
the Mine-Mill Research Report, provides ample proof that non-ferrous metal mining

has the highest accident
rate of any major branch of
the U. S. minerals industry.

That fact was emphasized in 8

the Bureau’s latest release,

8 “Work Injury and Employ-

ment Data for Mineral Ex-
tractive Industries — 1955-
1957.”

The Report, prepared by the
Mine-Mill Research (1 e p a r t-
ment, says “this underscores
the need for federal inspection
of metal mines as now provid-
ed by law for coal mines.”

POTASH

Claims that potash mining
is one of the safest of the min-
erals industries are blasted by
the government release which
also shows that potash mining
has the highest accident rate
of any non-metal mining in-
dustry. In addition,’ potash has
a higher accident rate than
any other major branch of the
minerals industry except non-
ferrous mining.

Accident rates show the
number of disabling injuries
incurred per million man-
hours on the job. According to
Bureau of Mines “figures, in
1957 non-ferrous mining as a
whole had 56.68 disabling in-
juries per million man-hours
compared to 12.37 for iron min-
ing, 44.16 for coal mining, 11.01
for petroleum and natural gas,
31.06 for non-metal mining as
a whole but 52.44 for potash,
15.43 for metallurgical plants,
and 23.72 for stone quarrying.

Covered by those figures
are production and develop-
ment workers only, including
underground, open pit and sur-
face workers. The designa-
tion “metallurgical plants” in-
cludes mill workers as well as
workers in smelting and re-
fining. -
COMPARISON

While 1957 figures on acci-
dent rates for underground
coal mining are not yet avail-
able for comparison with the
1957 rate for underground
copper mining, the 1956 fig-
ures for underground accident
rates show 56.67 in copper as
compared with 55.66 in coal.

Free Enterprise-—How It’s
Practiced in Tin Can Alley

WASHINGTON, D. C.—-The only competition among
the big auto companies is to see how much more the
public can be smooth-talked into paying on the price of
a new car and how much sooner the car buyer can be
made to trade in his new car for a newer one. Unchal-

lenged on top of the heap
in this “competition” is
General Motors.

These are among the start-
ling facts proved in a docu-
mented 300-page report on the
auto industry recently re-
leased by the Senate Subcom-
mittee on Antitrust and Mo-
nopoly headed by Senator Estes
Kefauver (Dem., Tenn.). The
explosive study, based on a
year - long -investigation, re-
ceived only passing notice in
the nation’s press despite the
fact that monopoly car price
manipulation bilks practically
all American families out of
millions of dollars each year.

The shocking “public be
damned” operation of the auto

makers in setting prices the
ordinary Joe has to. pay, or
walk is illustrated in the Ke-
fauver committee’s study ac-
count of 1957 car prices set by
the big three.
COMPETITION?

Ford was the first to an-
nounce its 1957 car prices, 2.9
per cent higher than the aver-
age for the previous year or
from $1 to $104 more on differ-
ent models. Two weeks later
General Motors, the industry’s
dominant producer, announced
its Chevrolet prices. Lower, to
outsell Ford‘? Heck, no! The
Chevrolet prices were 6.1 per
cent higher than the previous
year's models or from $50 to
$166 more.

A week later Ford withdrew
its earlier price list and an-

, nounced revised prices on all

models——higher. Chrysler then
followed with its own price
list announcement in line with
GM and Ford.

OTHER FACTS

Among the facts brought out
by the report: auto companies
compete with each other only
to prevent prices from being
cut; the quality of cars has
steadily deteriorated in the last
10 years while prices have
gone up; labor costs have lit-
tle to do with higher car
prices; advertising is. designed
to convince Joe Public that
he’s practically un-American if
he doesn’t buy a new car every
two years; built-in profits can
make it possible for GM to
operate at as low as 40 per
cent capacity without losing
a cent.

Get the report yourself for

tendent of Documents, Wash-
ington, D. C.; ask for “Admin-
istered Prices: Automobiles, A
Report Pursuant to S. Res. 231,

More Security

‘WASHINGTON-—About 12.5
millicn Americans will start
receiving their 7 per cent so-
cial security increases invtheir
first checks in February. -

FEBRUARY, .1915?-

BIG NONFERROUS mining companies recently polled by‘
Engineering and Mining Journal say they expect nonferrous 
metal sales to be ten per cent to twenty per cent higher in 1959 
thanlin 1958, with the increase due partly to higher prices, partly  "
to more tonnage moved. Companies responding to the survey 
indicated they expected to invest over $200 million in 1959 in dér 
velopment, new plant and equipment, and replacement and mod'-  5:;
ernization of existing facilities in the United States, much less 
in foreign countries. ‘ ' ~ ’

U. S. LEAD AND ZINC consumption will increase in 1959,. g 
says the Business and Defense Services administration ‘of the . 
Department of Commerce. The agency predicts leads consuhmp-3 
tion will be up 5 percent over 1958, zinc up 8-10 percent.-These,~-.
predictions, especially for zinc, may be on the conservativeside.  
For galvanizing, BDSA expects only a 5 percent increase, vvhic ,_
seems low in View of the much greater increase in pro'sp_e' jg:
for steel production, to which galvanizing consumption is‘1_‘e-._ ‘

   

lated. For die-casting, it projects a 12 percentincrease, while

the American Zinc Institute expects use of zinc for automobile - fl
die-cast components to rise by one-third over 1958. 7 .  '

. ‘k * ‘k _ 6 . 
CRUDE COPPER production in the United States in the last
three months of 1958 reached an annual rate of 1,144,304 tons,
according to Copper institute statistics. These data differ some-
what from Bureau of Mines data on mine production of copper, .
but are more up to date. If crude production of copper this 
year keeps up at the same rate, 1959 will be a record year,.sur- ’ 1 .
passing previous peaks during World War II and in 1956-195.7‘.-Q ’

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY is one of biggest U. S. consum-
ers of nonferrous metals, according to latest report of Automo- _
bile.Manufacturers Association. Here are figures on auto‘-‘in-' ‘
dustry use of nonferrous metals in 1957: , r ’ .

PERCENT OF TOTAL

METAL TONS U.S. CONSUMPTION ,.
Copper 128,000 7.8
Lead 495,000 44.2
Zinc 280,000 34.6

Consumption oflead includes tetraethyl lead used in gaso-  "
line. Use of copper has shown encouraging growth since 1957;
when about 34-35 pounds were used per vehicle produced. Cur- .
rent model autos, says Business and Defense Services Adminis- 1 ‘
tration, have been estimated to use 40-42 pounds per car. Largest
single use is in radiators. 9 ’ '-

BEAR CREEK Mining Company, a KEN NECOTT subsid_i- v ‘
ary, has withdrawn its application to lease 933 acres in Porcu-C '
pine Mountains State park in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The company had sought to mine copper in an area of 5,200
acres under Lake Superior and needed the lease in the state

- park as a base for this operation. The proposed lease has -been

protested for over a year by sportsmen and conservation-minded I _ 3
groups, who charged the mining operations would mar the.-f<_j
beauty of the state park—Michigan’s largest—and one of the .,
nation’s last wilderness areas. BEAR CREEK’S president, in N
withdrawing the application, indicated the withdrawal was -
prompted by the opposition it had stirred up, and pointed out ' .
that the State Conservation Director had also publicly indicated. 
his opposition to the project. ,

HOWE SOUND company has announced it will reopen Bri-‘N
tannia copper mine in British Columbia, shut down for nearly
a year. A two-year contract has been signed with Mine-Mill
Local 663, and 350 workers are being called back to work. Prior
to shutdown, concentrates had been shipped to AS&R plant at
Tacoma, Wash., for smelting. ' 0

PHELPS DODGE has announced a $5,000,000 expansion pro-
gram for the Lavender Pit at Bisbee, Ariz. The expansion will
increase the life of the pit by seven years and will require
moving a number of buildings. No appreciable increase in the
work force is expected to result from the expansion.

* F ﬁr *

LEAD AND ZINC prices moved in opposite directions last
month. U. S. price of zinc remained unchanged, but Consolidated
Mining and Smelting, big British Columbia producers, raised
the Canadian price of zinc 14c above the U.S. price. American
Metal Climax, American-owned company, which produces lead
mainly in foreign countries, cut its price on lead from 13c to
12c toward the end of January. Other major U.S. lead sellers
fell in line. American Metal Climax blamed slowness of U.S.—' 
government barter program and “unrealistic differential” beev ’
tween foreign and domestic prices for its decision to cut price.

JORGE ‘ALLESANDRI, President of CHILE, says, accord-* 
ing to press reports, that Anaconda and Kennecott have offered "
to help Chile get loans abroad, and will pay the interest on
these loans out of windfall profits the companies will make
from recent devaluation of Chilean peso. Late last year, Chile V
changed the -value of its currency from 819 pesos, which equals 
one U.S. dollar to 990 to the dollar, thus making the peso worth I ‘
about 17 percent less in terms of U.S. dollars than before. 3'

—Kennecott’s and Anaconda’s windfall profits arise from the

savings they will make in the dollar costs of paying wages and
buying supplies locally in Chilean pesos. How much of these
profits are the companies splitting with Chile by offering to
pony up interest on foreign loans they may be able to wangle?

No estimates have been given out for the reason but youcan, “
bet that a good slice of this windfall, running into millions of
dollars per year, will stick with Kennecott and Anacon_da.——*~

History 

Whenr top stage-screen-TV
entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.
told’ reporters recently that he
wanted to star in: a western,
some r.e:a d-er st may have
thought it - was a publicity
stunt. But Davis was: dead-

» serious, backed, by the: knowl-

edge that such a role: would-
be 3: “natural” in the unfold-
ing story- of the great con-
tributions by Negroes to the
making of American history-.

Historian Carter G. Wood-
son states‘ that the first actual
explorer of what is now

.known as New Mexico‘ and

Arizona was a N egro. This
man, named Estevanico or
Little‘ Stephen, headed a Span-
ish exploring expedition back
in 1539 which moved north
from Mexico‘ into the terri-
tory that later became the
southwestern pa r t of the
United States. -

It was a Negro with the
expedition of Cortez in the
“New World” who, finding
some brown grains in his ra-
tions of rice, planted them as
an experiment, and thus be-
came the pioneer in" wheat
raising, in America.

these, among many, point to-

FEBRUARY. -.1955

Uplifting Person-to—Person Program
Hides Microphone in Gal’s Brassier

NE of these days the carefully created

ﬂlusion of relaxed intimacy you see on
Edward R. Murrow’s “Person to Person” inter-
view program is going to be shattered with a
loud bang when a hidden mike_or battery pack
breaks loose and goes clattering around a liv-
ing room floor.

The celebrities interviewed by Murrow each
week don’t “perform” on a stage set. That’s
the whole “homey” idea of the show. You are
given the illusion of visiting them in their own
homes, kind of an off-stage observer permitted
to_sit in while the celebrities casually chat with
Murrow.

Consequently you see no microphones being
carried in anybody’s hand, no wires under foot
to trip any of the principals as they move easily
from room to room, upstairs and downstairs,
indoors and out. They talk and you hear them;
although no mechanical paraphernalia to trans-
mit the sound appears to be present.

Accomplishing this illusion is no small
trick of studious preparation and engineering.
Murrow’s crew of technicians, about 50, usually
arrive at the house or apartment of the person
or persons being interviewed about 12 hours
before the show hits the air. They spend all
that time setting the “stage,” adjusting lights,
moving furniture around, arranging cameras
and wiring, instructing the principals on their
movements.

HUMAN TRANSMITTER

Each celebrity is then wired for a kind of
remote sound transmission, transformed in
"effect into a human radio station.

Tiny, easily hidden, mikes are used. Easily
hidden, that is, with male celebrities, in which
case the mike is simply hooked on underneath
the necktie. But unless" the female celebrity
being visited is partial to mannish clothes or
highnecked dresses (which they seldom are),
the problem of hiding the mike on the feminine
anatomy is not so simple.

It’s solved by placing the mike in milady’s
brassiere.

Don’t ask us what they do with the proud
gals who don’t ordinarily seem to wear bras-
sieres. That detail is not covered by our source
of information. We’d guess these gals sacrifice
vanity to art and wear brassieres, if only for
the show. ' .

ADDITIONAL GEAR _ _ M
Well, now, that takes care of the mike. -«But

in addition to the mike, the principals on the,

show" are also equipped with portable. power
packs" and miniature transmitters hidden on
their*"=bod.ies. Again, there’s no problem with
the men, who lug the electronic gear on special
belts strapped around their waists without the
extra bulge being obvious. ‘

~'Wrhen the sack dress was in style, maybe
attaching all this transmitting equipment to

: Jayne Mansfield or Sophia Loren slowed them
down. a bit, but the sack solved the problem of
not-. showing bulges where they naturally
shouldn’t be.
sheath or skin-tight gown, though.

. You will notice that in this latter case, the
glamour gals never cross their legs. That’s
because the equipment is attached to their
thighs. Neat, huh? .

The guy on_ Murrow’s CBS-TV “Person to
Person” show who slips, slides and straps all
the vmikes, batteries and transmitting equip-
ment on to both male and female celebrities
aliki is Steve Weiss. Must be interesting

Health Plan Trends Marked

(By Mine-Mill Research Report)

Health and insurance plan changes from
1954 to 1958, as reported in a new Bureau of
Labor Statistics study, reflect recent bargain-
ing trends in this field. The study is based on
93 different plans, each covering from a thou-
sand to half a million active workers. Signifi-
cant trends indicated by the study were——

MEDICAL BENEFITS for non-surgical
cases constituted the chief area of expansion.
About half of the existing medical plans were

‘ improved usually by increasing allowances;
nine plans added such benefits for workers and ’

dependents; five plans extended benefits to de-
pendents; the number of plans extending such
benefits to retired workers and their depend-
ents more than doubled to a total of 26.
LIFE INSURANCE-—53_ per cent of plans
were changed so as to increase either the
— amount of coverage, usually for all workers-
. in some cases only for certain groups.

 . 1 WEEKLY ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS
" -.,BEgNEF’I,'.l‘S=were improved in about 83 per cent-

of cases. In most plans, weekly payments were
increased, most frequently by $5; four plans
(plus 16 that already had this provision) added
occupational coverage. The usual amount pro-
vided for occupational disabilities was the dif-
ference between Workmen’s compensation and
the specified amount for non-occupational dis-
abilities.

_ HOSPITAL BENEFITS——Three outof every
five plans providing cash room and board
benefits raised benefit amounts. Nineteen ad-
ditional plans (making a total of 44 or 47%
of all plans) extended hospital benefits to re-
tired workers;.22 plans (total 44) added hos-
pital benefits for dependents of retired work-
ers.

SURGICAL BENEFI’I‘S——About half of such
plans were improved, most commonly to a
maximum $300 allowance. Eighteen plans
(total 39) added surgical benefits for retired
workers; 20 (total 38) added such beneﬁts for
dependents of retired workers. ’ -. .

DENVER——Startling evidence that employers in the non-ferrous metals industry
are steadily increasing their mine production and consequent profits with fewer and
fewer workers on their payrolls has been marshaled by the Mine-Mill Research depart-’ L

ment.

As presented in the department’s publication, Mine-Mill Research Report, a new

study of data compiled by
the Federal Reserve board
and the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics has verified Mine-Mill’s
assertion of many months that
some mining corporations not

only were trying to shift the .

burden of the metals crisis to
their employees, but were us-
ing the crisis as an excuse to
produce even greater tonnage
and profits by increasing out-
put with speedup, reduced
work forces, an army of “ef-
fiency experts” and pushers,
and even violation of contracts.

Government figures sh ow
that metal mine production in
November of 1958 was 33 per-
cent higher than it was in Jan-
uary, 1958. At the same time,
there were 13 per cent fewer
production Vvorkers employed
in metal mines. (See Chart at
Right.)

Other statistics compiled by
the Research department show
that jobs have lagged further
behind production increases in
metal mining and non-ferrous
smelting and refining than in
durable and non-durable goods

‘ manufacturing.

CHART FACTS

The chart at right and other
data published in the Research
Report are all based on pro-
duction statistics released by

the Federal Reserve board and ‘

employment estimates released
monthly by the Bureau of La-
bor Statistics. Research Direc-
tor Bernard_VV. Stern said that

“all we did to. the data was to.

show each month’s figures be-
‘ginning in. February. as per-.
centages,-.,_of the January , fig-
ures.”  ’ -
Thus, November production
,was 133 percent-of January's
(100), and the number of pro-
duction workers was only 87
per cent of January’s.
; The extent to which payrolls
 are falling behind the produc-
.tion upturn in metal mining
{can be seen in the fact that
1; there were 84,000 production
 workers in” metal mining (all

 non-ferrous, plus iron) in Jan-
: uary, 1958, while in November
 there were only 73,000, a re-
riod.. During the first two 
years, the maximum would be 2'3?

duction of 11,000 workers. The
inescapable conclusion is that

 the speedup, the stretchout, la-

E.-bor-saving devices, and con-
.-="'t1-act violations are paying off
in higher profits, with payrolls
falling behind.

that-the upturn occurring after
the bottom month in 1958 has
been at the expense of the

BOTTOM HIT
Recent figures show that the
rough ‘downhill road of the
last two years has finally
reached bottom and that the
industry is on its way back-
in copper pretty much all the
way back to the levels of 1956
and 1957. But on the way
down, about one production
worker out of every three in
lead-zinc lost his job, two out
of nine in copper. The union
estimates that more than 9,000
lead-zinc production jobs, more
than 9,500 in copper were lost
between January, 1957, and the
low months in 1958. This in-

_ cludes. mining, milling, smelt-

ing, and refining.

By stepping up the output

per man-hour, the big non-fer-~

rous companies have been able
to cut unit-labor costs substan-
tially, offsetting the effect of
lower prices on corporate prof-
its. Now with production on
the upswing, with the stretch-

out tighter ‘than ever before,_ 
with prices improving, the out- _' 

look for big profits is much
brighter for this year.

That Wall Street has seen i

this is borne out by the fact

that common stocks of suchg

copper producers as . Kenne-"
cott, Anaconda, Phelps Dodge,
Magma, and Inspir_ation -had

been bid up an average of 50- _

per cent over,1958 lows by the

UN CERTAINTIES

says there are “some-'uncer-

tainties in this otherwise rosy ,

outlook. In copper there was
an encouraging increase in
fabricators’ deliveries in the
last quarter of 1958 that may
or may not have set the pace
for 1959, and there was a sof-
tening in price in late Novem-

ber that may happen again as ,

THE -MINE-MILL UNION

 

Other Unions

In the News

Discrimination

The top leadership of the AFL-CIO was
publicly censured last month for countenanc-
ing continued anti-Negro discrimination in a
number of affiliated unions. An 11-page docu-
mented memorandum released by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People and addressed to Boris Shishkin, direc-
tor of the AFL-CIO’s civil rights department,
charged that the discrimination follows a pat-
tern of total exclusion of Negroes from mem-
bership, segregated locals, or the separate line
of progression restricting the job classifications
available to Negro workers.

Among the unions cited as practicing such
discrimination were two headed respectively
by George Harrison, a member of the AFL-
CIO civil rights committee, and AFL-CIO Pres-
ident George Meany himself.

The NAACP document charged that “alltoo
often there is a significant disparity between
the declared public policy of the national AFL-
CIO and the day-to-day reality as experienced
by Negro wage earners in the North as well
as in the South.”

Censure also came from another source on
Jan. 19 when the President’s Committee on
Government Contracts called for immediate
action by the building trades unions and
Meany, himself a member of the advisory‘ com-
mittee, to help bring success to the committee’s
two-year efforts to see that Negro craftsmen

are not barred from construction work on

Washington’s Southwest Redevelopment proj-
ect. Specifically cited was a local of the Inter-
national Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

Teachers

The American Federation of Teachers made
the news regarding an election in Los Angeles
and ademonstration for higher pay in Chicago,
but the union’s successful fight to end segrega-
tion among its own membership attracted little
attention. The Board of Education building in
downtown Chicago was picketed by 5,000 school
teachers demanding more than the 75 cents a
day raise approved by the Board. In Los

Angeles the AFT won an NLRB election, the,
-first of its kind, among teachers employed by

the motion picture and TV studios.

._Largely unnoticed, however, was the news
that the Teachers union is now completely de-
segregated. Reinstatement in the AFT was
denied an all-white affiliate in Chattanooga,
Tenn., making it clear that non-discrimination
is both the union’s policy and practice. The
AFT says its loss of 3,000 members in segre-
gated units has been more than overcome "by

a -gain of 6,000 new members in the past two,

years.

Auto Workers

Settlement by the United Auto Workers
Jan. 19 of its 66-day strike at 15 plants of In-
ternational Harvester company in six states
came amid a rhubarb in which: the UAWA Har-
vester 18-man national negotiating -committee
itself was split with a majority voting to rec-
ommend rejection of the pact despite approval
if its terms by Duane (Pat) Greathouse, UAW
vice president and head of its Harvester divi-

A sion; the UAW Harvester council accepted it by

a close vote at a’ meeting described by news
reporters as “laced with shouts and boos”;
some 37,000 Harvester workers in 33 UAW

locals ratified it overwhelmingly. The old con-
tract expired Aug. .1.

Union gains in the new 3-year contract in-
cluded: 6 cents an hour (or 21/; percent) wage
increase retroactive to Aug. 23 and boosts in
the same amount Sept. 14, 1959, and Oct. 3,
1960; a 4 to 8 cent additional raise for some
3,600 skilled workers; liberalized pension,
health-welfare and SUB plans; and four weeks
vacation for 25-year men.

Concessions won by the company included
the right to order vacation shutdowns and the
freezing of the night shift premium at the
amount in effect before the new contract.

Priest Says Meany's
Wandering Up Alley

" LONG BEACH, Cal.if.—A Catholic priest sug-
' gests that George Meany could best serve the labor
movement by resigning his post as AFL-CIO Presié .
dent.

"Father J. L. Donahue,. C..S.V., chaplain of the
it if Chicago ‘Building Trades council and a member of the
Metal [Lathers union, made the. proposal in a speech to
V the ‘Metal Lathers here. - , '

Meany, Father Donahue said, has “lost his spirit of
trade unionism and is wandering up the alley of no-return.”

-LABOR FLOUNDER-ING?

The -priest acddedthat the labor movement is “flounder- V
‘ ing abou ” under its present leadership- He accused the
membersof the AFL-CIO Executives council of having “sur-
rendered their individuality and become yes-men” because
0 -of the “hypocri.-tes” who are attacking labor today.
THE REASON . . _ A

‘Father Donahue said that “all the noise being raised
against Dave Beck, Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters and
others is not intended so much to hurt them, as it is to
weaken the organized labor movement by moulding public
opinion to demand restrictive legislation to shackle the

little people who through their labor organizations are get- A

;   Crises Acute
" NE of the most talked-about books of last

- year, “The Affluent Society,” by John
‘ Galbraith, points up a basic problem of our

, vate goods and services than any other country
,'”.-in the world, suffers from _a - -’ -  - ‘-
,  fpoverty of public goods and
— . services.

_ _ ‘By private goods, Gal-
  ; braith refers to those pro-
 ' duced by private industry
"¥mr .profit; by public goods
 _..ind services, he means
those supplied by local and
national governments with-
out profit.

Two sectors of our econ- ,
omy in which the proverty - 
of public services is most glaringly evident are
education and housing. While housing is gen-
erally supplied by private construction firms
-at a profit, the experience of many countries-
especially those which have been most success-
ful in eliminating slums and raising minimum
housing standards—shows, as Galbraith says,

to “ . . . the housing industry functions well only
in’combination with a large, complex, and cost-
ly array of public services” including slum
clearance, planning, financing, and public hous-
ing.
‘Our educational deficiencies, which should
have be_en0_bVious for years, have now become
—. _ highlighted, by the sudden recognition that
’ , Russia and‘ other countires, are outpacing us.
We are in serious danger, many experts have
warned, of being unable to meet our needs for

First, as citizens and parents, we share with
millions of other Americans a legitimate con-

(From American Friends Service Committee)

 

Washington Column  

WASHINGTON—As expected, the first major piece of busi-
ness on the floorof the Senate was the issue of amending Sen-
ate Rule 22 or, as it is popularly referred to—-“the filibuster.”

The results of this battle are already known. The liberals
took a beating when Senator Lyndon Johnson, majority leader,
prevailed with his compromise. The majority leader. was suc-
cessful in changing the rule so that now debate in the Senate
can be shut off by two-thirds of all Senators present and voting.
This is a far cry, of course, from the simple majority which
liberals wanted to effectively control the “filibuster.”

But While the “filibuster” fight led by Senator Clinton
Anderson of .New Mexico has been compromised, we feel it
would be a serious mistake to consider the “war” for civil
rights and other important liberal legislation lost because of this
“battle.” As a matter of fact, it is our opinion that any “fili-
buster” can be broken, provided the Democratic leadership
decides to crack down. ‘

NOT TRUE BAROMETER .

We also feel that the roll call on the limitation of debate is
not a true listing of the position which the majority of Demo-
cratic and Republican liberals will take on legislation dealing
with the welfare of the people. -Senator Johnson’s statement
that the “filibuster” does not prevent good legislation from
being enacted, commits the majority leader to a program of
dynamic legislation. What comes out of the Congress, of course,
and especially the Senate, will depend on the continued pressure
of the people back home.

FIRST TWO WEEKS

Aside from the “filibuster” issue the business of Congress
for the first two weeks has been organizing. Some important
changes from Mine-Mill viewpoint, have taken place. Congress-
man Lee Metcalf of Montana has resigned from the Labor com-
mittee and now has been appointed to the all powerful Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. The Labor committee will include
20 Democrats to 10 Republicans and it is expected that the new
appointments will strengthen the liberal group on the commit-
tee. Congressman Joseph Montoya, of New Mexico, has switched
from Judiciary to Appropriations. Newly-elected Congressman
Thomas G. Morris of New Mexico has been appointed to the
Interior Committee, while newly-elected Congressman David S.
Wing of Utah has been put on the new Science and Astronautical
Committee.

On the Senate side, newly-elected Senator Frank E. Moss of
Utah has been appointed to Interior and Insular Affairs and to
Public Works, while Nevada's new Senator, Howard W. Cannon,
has been appointed to the Armed Services and the Aeronautics
and Space Committee.

FLOOD OF BILLS

Thousands of bills have been introduced into both Houses
and the number grows daily. Congressman Ed Edmondson of
Oklahoma is expected to introduce a metal subsidy bill along
the lines of the old Seaton plan and Senator Patrick V. Mc-
Namara has introduced a bill to provide, in effect, a subsidy for
both copper and iron ore. Congressman Metcalf is preparing
for reintroduction the non-ferrous mine safety bill, but has
already introduced a school construction bill. Senator John J.
Sparkman of Alabama has submitted his bill for a low and
middle-cost housing program, although some other Democrats
have put into the hopper housing bills far more liberal.

The first major labor bill is the old Kennedy-Ives bill now
reintroduced by'Senator John F. Kennedy. Senator Barry Gold-
water, who now is the ranking Republican member on the
Senate Labor committee, stated he will introduce the administra-
tion bill which is expected tobe far more strict than the Ken-
nedy bill. But the Kennedy bill makes no provision for labor’s
criticism and suggested amendments of the Taft-Hartley law
itself. Many Congressmen believe that no attempt will be made
to alter Taft-Hartley as such and, as a matter of fact, Senator
Kennedy has come up with the idea of the appointment of a
special committee to make a study of the Taft-Hartley law. This,
of cgidurse, would delay Taft-Hartley action for an indefinite

A - Work Is Heavy   -

HE CONVENTION next month in San Fran-

cisco will have its work cut out if it is go-
ing to complete its agenda in the short space
of a k. Th ajor job, of course, will be con-
"""" " " tract demands for our forth-
coming negotiations, and
there IS plenty of evidence
that the membership is by
no means short of ideas on
what these demands should
comprise.

In addition, the conven-
tion will have a new draft ‘-
constitution to consider as a
result of the resolution
passed last year in Denver.
  Since last March a Board
committee has worked intensively in an en-
deavor to bring the constitution up to date,
without of course tampering with basic dem- 4
ocratic provisions dealing with finances, dues
structure, referendum votes, election of officers
and similar basic rights of the membership.
The new draft will eliminate outworn provi-
Sions and contradictory language; it presents a
more simplified approach to our present-day
functions. Since the convention is authorized
by last year’s referendum vote to" revise the
constitution, this will take a big part of the
convention’s work. ' .

The-legislative and legal work of the Union
will also require attention. Even though recent
months have shown improvement—the metal .
mining industry is still far from healthy and
the delegates will certainly consider additional
ways and means of protecting the jobs of our
members. The continuing program of organiz-
ing new members will also come in for thor-
oughgoing discussion and action. I

* ‘I: ‘Ir
LL-IN-ALL, with these important matters

plus the nomination of officers for the
next two years, it will be a busy week. On top»
of that, the convention delegates will have the
advantage of meeting in one of the greatest of ’
American cities with numerous attractions out-
side the convention hall. —- V
Those delegates who attended the last In-
ternational convention to be held in San Francis-
co, back in 1948, no doubt will be anxious to
renew their acquaintance with the scenic beau-
ty, the famous restaurants and the other at-
tractions of the Bay area. Those for whom this
will be their first visit to the city have much
to look forward -to. It is to be hoped that the
busy delegates will have at least some oppor-
tunity to takea look around.
~k ~k *
ECAUSE of its heavy work load, especially
the setting of policy on bargaining, this
convention should be taken most seriously by
every local union. On its decisions will rest the
future of the Union during the next year or
two, particularly in the vital area of jobs, con-
tract security and wages and other improve-
ments. This convention should be as big as pos-
sible, which means that every local union
should send a maximum number of delegates
In spite of the financial hardships inflicted on
the local unions as a result of layoffs and other
problems during the past year, special effort
should‘ be made to send full representations to
San Francisco. **
The big job of formulating our bargaining
program and preparing for negotiations cannot
be done effectively unless there is full represen-
tations from the entire union at the conven-
tion. There is no better way to invest our treas
uries than in taking part in the discussion of
contract proposals and bargaining strategy
which will take place in San Francisco. This is
the only way the membership can be informed
and given to understand the aims of the union
arrived at by the democratic discussion and
majority vote.——ALBERT PEZZATI.

4 Labor Buzzes
Legislatures

Late last month, various state legislatures
still were spinning their wheels at the green
light, but a few had finally obtained enough
traction to shift into high gear. As they did so,
many of the lawmaking bodies found Mine-
Mill local unions on the job, energetically sup

porting such measures as improved unemploy-

ment benefits, workmen’s compensation, edu-
cation, tax structures, health and safety laws,

and labor-management relations.

Generally,

the labor movement was busier in state capitals

than in many years.

Reports from locals and Mine-Mill staff
members were slow in coming into‘ Denver.

"As the Mine-Mill Union went to press, these

were some of the developments:

  Montana

Considerable progress toward co-ordination
between Mine-Mill and other labor and farm

groups marks this term of the Montana legis-'

lature. The Montana Mine-Mill Legislative
committee has. had several meetings. and union
representatives have been very active in

Helena.

A general legislative program has been
: agreed to by various labor groups which in-
cludes, besides unemployment and workmen’s
compensation, a law on occupational diseases,
a state labor relations act, an improved eight-

hour law,_ elimination of the pauper’s oath re-

quirements in the welfare act, and prevention
, of abuses of the initiative petition. Corpora-.
tions in the state already are engaged in a let-
p ter writing campaign to defeat House Bill No.
1 which provides an additional 11 weeks of un-

At a January farmer-labor institute in Great
Falls, Mine-Mill Board Member Ernest Salvas
told, the delegates that “there are three feed

- bills in the legislature; one is whether to feed
-the unemployed, another to feed the legisla-

ture (the legislature immediately passed that)
’ and the third whether to feed the governors
of‘ the nation (apparently at a conference).”

POWERS BUSY

One of the busiest members of this legisla-

ture is State Rep. Maurice “Sonny” Powers,
Mine-Mill international representative. He is
a member of five committees, including that
on workmen’s compensation where he is vice-
chairman. Others on‘ which he is serving are
the committees on labor, mines and mining,
privileges and elections, and social security,

Powers has introduced a bill raising bene-
fits to silicotics already on welfare from $65 to
$100.a month. He also will introduce an eight-
hour collar-to-collar work day for miners. His
name is on four other bills.

A pamphlet opposing the sales tax -has been
published by The Joint Tax Study committee,
Montana State AFL-CIO, Montana Federation
of Teachers, Montana. Farmers union, and
. Mine-Mill.

.Utah

The Utah legislature got underway in Salt
Lake City and good news for Mine-Mill mem-
bers was not long in coming.tState Rep. James
Brusatto, whose principal organized support
for re-election in November was Mine’-Mill, has
been elected chairman of the House Labor
committee, despite behind-the-scenes opposi-
tion from officials of some other unions.

Regional Director Verne Curtis said of the
new development that “all labor in Utah can
be assured that its interests will be diligently
protected if Jimmy, as chairman of the Labor
committee, can possibly do so. There will be no
sly, cozy deals under his chairmanship.” Bru-
satto is a Disabled American Veterans leader
' in the state.
Labor forces in the state already have had

.introduced abill to repeal the state’s so-called

“right to work” law. The bill came into the
House with the united backing of an organized
. labor legislative committee made up of "the
Utah AFL-CIO, Teamsters, Railroad Brother-
. hoods, United Mine Workers, and Mine-Mill.

J Idaho

Rudy Hanson, member of Local 18 in Kel-
-logg, has been assigned by Mine-Mill's Idaho
locals to go to Boise in order to insure proper
presentation of the union’s legislative pro-
posals and positions. Hanson's appointment
followed a Northwest council meeting held in
Kellogg (See story on Page 12).

Anti-labor forces in the legislature already
are busy fashioning a “little Kennedy-Ives bill”

_ and another measure described by Rep. Gregg

Botvin (D., Power) as “a sort of little Taft-

Hartley law.”

Union Wins El Paso
Arbitration Award

EL PASO, Texas—AS&R management’s contention here
that qualification may govern in a comany choice of men to be
laid off “would be to make a shambles of the seniority pro-
vision” of the contract. ~ '

This was the guiding opinion of Arbitrator John E. Gorsuch
in a recent decision which ordered the immediate reinstatement
of Local 50.9 member Aniceto Briones with back pay (about
$1100) retroactive to the date of his layoff on September 29,
1-958. ’

The union’s arbitration victory in this case had an imme-
diate effect on the grievance of two other workers also laid off

at the El Paso smelter on the same basis as Briones. Local 509
.members Jose Diaz and Romero Bonillas were reinstated with
back pay of about $940 each when the company decided not to
. proceed to arbitration on their case as a result of the Briones

decision.
GONZALES CASE

In another and separate" case brought to arbitration by
Mine-Mill Local 501 at the El Paso Phelps Dodge refinery, Gor-
such ruled in favor of the union regarding the “medical dis-
charge” of Fernando Gonzalez who was fired by the company
on the grounds of “physical inability to do the required work.”
Gonzalez was ordered reinstated although without back pay be-
cause, the arbitrator decided, PD management had “acted in
good -faith on the advice -of the company doctor.”

Briones, a man with 11 years of seniority at the AS&R smel-
ter, first was transferred in a reduction’ of force‘ from the me-

chanical department where he was working as a helper to a A

job as laborer in the anode department. He was later laid off,
despite his seniority, in a further plant-wide reduction of force.
The company contended his work record was unsatisfactory
and also claimed the right under its interpretation of the con-

tract to keep what it considered more “qualified” workerson .

the job with less seniority. ’
UNION ARGUMENT _
The union’s argument that Briones had been on the com-

pany pay roll for 11 years without ever being disciplined org-

officially Warned about his alleged bad work record, and that"
management‘ "had accepted every bid for promotion he ever
made, Was upheld as valid by the arbitrator.

Int’l Rep. M. R. Barraza and Business Agent A. C. Montoya
handled the union’s case.

congress, from provincial and

battle‘ against Inco morally
a_nd-ffinancial-ly easier. Indepen-

without stint.

-he Inco Strikers

our union in the U. S.—from
the smallest locals to the In-
ternational U n i o n treasury—-

actually made it possible for
us to continue until victory.
Messages of support from the
U.S. locals raised our confi-
dence in ultimate victory and
were looked for eagerly and
received gratefully.

In all this, however, the per-
sonal assistance rendered our
battle by International Vice-
President Orville Larson, - as-
signed by the International
union to work with us and help
us reach a settlement, did more
than anything else to make our

victory possible. Brother Lar-

‘ son devoted his full time to’

our problem of achieving ,a
settlement, in working with
the bargaining committee, and
in direct bargaining with the

company and throughout the *

period of government interven-
tion.
Brother Larson’s leadership

‘in the final stages of the bar-

gaining served‘ only to raise
our respect for his personal
abilities, but also to link more
closely than ever before the re-
lationship between the Cana-

dian and American sections of
our International union.

COSTLY BATTLE

The -strike is over. It was a
costly battle in terms of fi-
nances since it involved almost
half of the total Canadian
membership. But the gains in
terms of material benefits to
the Workers involved, and be-
yond that, the confidence given
workers in other unions to
continue the battle of the wage

earner again-st the persistent

efforts of the corporations to
deny justified Wage increases,
more than makes up for the
cost of our battle. In this re-
spect, additional bodies of
Workers, encouraged and heart-
ened’ by our successful strug-
gle, are already facing up to
the employers in many seg-

ments of Canadian industry.

We, in turn, are ready and
eager to give them every pos-
sible assistance in their strug-
gles.

In terms of the new unity
created by our strike—not only
in our own ranks, but between
our union and most other Ca-
nadian unions, our recent bat-
tle Was most successful. The
problem now is to create and

carry through new and more

effective methods of working
in unison and in unity with
other unions so that together
we can successfully carry on
the never-ending struggle to
maintain and improve. living

standards and security of wage‘

earners throughout our coun-
try. E

Notice of the Canadian con-

tained in a letter to all locals
in Canada,
signed by William Longridge,
Secretary-Treasurer of Mine-

“that this postponement of the
convention would be regarded
by the membership of the un-
ion as an action serving the
best interests of the union and
ensuring that a full represent-

_ ative convention could be held.”

A new call-”for the 11th An-
nual Canadian convention now

‘rescheduled’ for Sept. 14, will

be issued in June, the notice

advised.

At the same time, the ,Ca- I

says the U.’ S. Treasury de-
partment, are expected to be
the highest on record; nonfer-
rous profits will share hand-

pie.” A

That the union seeks only

_ simple justice for its’ mem-

bership was demonstrated in
the reminder to employers
that “this union has been in
the forefront in support of
government minerals policies
that would help to bring about
greater economic stability ‘in
this industry.” The Executive
board said that Mine-Mill’s ef-
forts in this regard “were a
definite contribution to the re-
covery that has been brought
about, particularly in lead and
zinc. We now propose to
achieve a like stability for the
workers in this industry."
JUS'l‘IFIED

Alluding to the two princi-
pal sources of difficulties be-
setting Mine-Mill members,
the board concluded:

‘fOur economic objectives
are more than justified by the
large increase in productivity
that occurred within the past
two years (see story on page
’-_7)--—one of the highest in-
creases of. any segment of

 

local shall be entitled to repre-
sentation which has -not paid

all indebtedness due to the In-
ternational Union, including
per capita tax up to Jan.-31,
1959. ‘
Delegates’ credential forms
have been mailed to local
unions. The credential marked
“duplicate” (buff colored) must
be in the hands of Internation-
al Secretary-Treasurer Albert
Pezzati at least fifteen days
prior to the meeting of the
convention. No local union
shall be entitled to represen-
tation in the convention which
has not complied with the In-
ternational constitution.

RESOLUTIONS

All locals shall send resolu-
tions to the International of-
fice not later than 15 days
prior to the convening of the
convention, as provided in Ar-
ticle 2. Two copies of each res-
olution should be submitted in
order to expedite the work of
the convention. Each resolution
shall be separate in order that
it may be referred to the prop-
er committee of the conven-
tion. Constitutional amend-
ments may be proposed and
should be submitted not later
than 15 days prior to the con-
vening of the convention.

The International union has
arranged hotel accommoda-

American industry, as well as
by the increased cost of living
since our last contracts were
signed.

“Our members, we are con-
fident’ - through their dele-
gates at our forthcoming In-
ternational convention — will

. translate these objectives into

specific demands and take the
necessary steps to a s s u r e
their achievement.”
OUTLOOK

The [Mine-Mill leaders
studied the union’s bargaining
prospects in the light of-what
has been predicted generally
for American industry in 1959.
In a recent issue of the Mine-
Mill Research Report, for ex-
ample, it was said that “bar-
gaining in 1959 will bring
more substantial wage in-
creases, improved insurance,
pensions, and other fringe
benefits.” The Research depart-
ment said that “about 65 of
every 100 workers covered by
major contracts will be affect-
ed by this year’s negotiations.
Steel. bargaining, scheduled
for a showdown by July 1, oc-
cupies the major spotlight;
other key bouts will occur in
nonferrous metals, rubber, oil,
longshore (east and west
coasts), meat packing, tele-
phone, and railroads.”

“New wage gains,” the Re-
search Report said, “appear
assured by 1) 1958 Wage pat-

tions for delegates at the Belle-
vue hotel, which is also official
convention headquarters. Ad-
vance reservations should be
sent to the secretary-treasulu
er’s office two weeks before
the convention at the latest.
Rates are $9 a day for single
rooms, $10 for double rooms,
and $12 for twin rooms. Mime-
ographed reservation forms
have been sent to the local
unions. In filling out the form,
the delegate should specify
the date and time of his arriv-
al. If this is changed after the
reservation is sent in, the hotel
should be notified directly.

Since the major work of the
convention will be on collec-
tive bargaining, and in order
to provide adequate’ attention
to wage and contract policies,
all Mine-Mill bargaining coun-
cils will be required to meet
prior to the convention. Each
council will meet on Friday,
March 13, at 10 a.m. All coun-
cils then will meet jointly on
Saturday, March 14, at 10 a.m.
The councils shall also con-
vene on Sunday, March 15, for
any additional business that
may be necessary. All council
meetings will-be held at the
Bellevue._

The International Executive
board’s pre-convention meet-
ing will begin at the Bellevue
on Sunday, March 8.

terns‘ which established tar-
gets for other unions to meet
or surpass; and with sales
and profits expected to in-
crease, many unions will be
aiming higher, and 2) built-in
wage boosts, under whic h
many workers are already as-
sured of a wage increase in
1959; these’ tend to set a base
for negotiated gains.

Built-in pay boosts won’t be
as common as last year, but
will still cover some 2.9 mil-
lion workers (4 million last
year). The most common de-
ferred increase provided for
will be seven cents per hour;

Among the main contract
proposals discussed by the
delegates were: a two-year

1958 RAISES

As for 1958, the U. S. Bu-
reau of L abor Statistics re-
ported that wage gains covered
6.8 million workers (a b o u t
85 per cent of all those under

- major contracts.) Of these, 3.5

million , won negotiated in-
creases, the balance secured
cost-of-living and automatic,
pay increases under long-term
contracts. The most common
negotiated increase was eight
cents per hour. Including both

and adjustments under long-
term contracts, six out of
