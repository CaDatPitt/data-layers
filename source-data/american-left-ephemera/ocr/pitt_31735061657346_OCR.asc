From the ofﬁcial record of the Pittsburgh “sedition”
trial. (The prosecutor has submitted a peace pamphlet
as evidence of an attempt “to overthrow the govern-
ment...” Steve Nelson, one of the Pittsburgh Six,
is defending himself.)

NELSON: “Your honor, I would like to know what the
prosecution intends to show with this document...”

COURT: “They are reading papers in your possession.”

NELSON: “Well, is it wrong... to be opposed to the
war policies of the Administration?”

PROSECUTOR: “I object to these speeches.”

NELSON: “In 1847 when this country fought a war
against Mexico . . 

COURT: (shouting) “Wait a minute.”

NELSON: (continuing) “Lincoln got up and opposed
it. He was Congressman at that time and said
that we had no business going into that war.”

COURT: (still shouting) “Mr. Nelson...”

NELSON: (continuing) “I am doing the same thing,
Your Honor.”

COURT: “Restrain this defendant by force...”

The Sedition Act Was First Designed to Give
Union-Smashing a "New Look"

It was after World War I. President Woodrow Wilson had popu-
larized the phrase "New Freedom," and there was enthusiasm among
workers for organizing unions. The Pennsylvania Manufacturers
Association naturally was opposed. Earlier, the manufacturers could
get the courts to rule, without making any bones about it, that it was
a criminal conspiracy for labor to organize. But that was in the last
century. Labor had become strong enough by 1919 to make public
opinion ‘reject such shameless injustice, and now it was no longer
illegal to organize. The manufacturers needed a new law that would
give them the power to smash unions as before, and at the same time
would sit well with the public. That's “why they came up with their
Sedition Act. Here is an example of how it was used:

In 1926 some workers from Iones 6. Laughlin Steel Corporation.
which is controlled by the Mellon interests, were meeting in a private
home in Aliquippa. near Pittsburgh. Police, whose salary came from
the same steel company's treasury, invaded the home, arrested the
workers and grabbed literature that was there, including some Marx-
ist books. With this literature as evidence, the steel workers were
tried under the Sedition Act. The old charge of "criminal conspiracy
to organize a union" was now changed to "overthrowing the gov-
ernment."

When this Sedition Act was first proposed by the manufacturers,
it was opposed by all organized labor, from Sam Gompers, national
president of the A. F. of L.———to Iames Maurer, then President of the
Pennsylvania Federation of Labor— to the rank and file workers.
Torn Kennedy, a leader of the United Mine Workers, went with a
thousand miners to Harrisburg to campaign against this frame—up law.
As a result of this wide protest, there were no moreof these prosecu-
tions after the Aliquppa trial for 20 years, and many Pennsylvania
workers thought that the Sedition Act was dead.

Now the Sedition Act Has a New
Purpose——Si|encing Peace

Then came the Korean war in 1950, and the manufacturers with
interests in Western Pennsylvania had good reason to revive the
Sedition Act. Many of their plants turned to producing war goods.
Here was, besides Iones 6: Laughlin, the Crucible Steel Co., the West-
inghouse Electric Corp., Aluminum Co. of America, U. S. Steel Corp.

The Mellon interests,’. together with the Morgans and Rockefellers,
control all of them. This war would be good business for them.

But here also were the Communist Party leaders, and they were
calling for a stop to the war in Korea. That is why they were prose-
cuted. They could not, of course, be charged openly with speaking
for peace.- So the Sedition Act was used again—to charge "overthrow
of the government." At the beginning of the Sedition Act trial in 1951,
Judge Michael Musmanno, who engineered the whole frame-up,
declared (it's in the official record) that he initiated the prosecution
because Nelson, Onda and Dolsen spoke in favor of bringing the
American boys back from Korea. '

Musmanno——a Natural for Frame-Up Job

It should not be surpising that when laws are used to serve the
political and economic interests of a small group of millionaires,
instead of to protect the public, that we wi.ll find that trials under such
conditions are conducted by people who have no respect for Consti-
tutional and human rights.

What kind of person is it who had the job of engineering this
Sedition trial? Musmanno ran for office on a "Mellon ticket" in 1928,
which placed him on the side of forces frankly anti-labor. But at
-another time, he associated himself with the defense movement for
Sacco and Vanzetti—two men framed up on a murder charge because
they had a dream for abolishing labor exploitation.

It was a big asset for a politician to get a Mellon blessing. And as
for Musmanno’s interest in Sacco and Vanzetti-—well. the case lasted
87 months, and he didn't get into it until the 85th month. By then,
millions of people saw through the frameup and were supporting the
defense. It was good politics then for Musmanno to risk being called a
"red" or "Communist" for his connection with the Sacco-Vanzetti case.

Consider another example of Musmanno’s double-dealing. In 1937,
he was making orations for the CIO, which at that time was conducting
sit—down strikes in plants to make owners recognize labor's right to
organize. And yet, when Mussolini suppressed the same kind of mili-
tancy in Italy through inflicting murderous beatings and doses of
castor oil on the Italian workers, Musmanno praised the bloody dictator
for his "purification of the Italian soil." (In a letter to the Pittsburgh
Press on February 20, 1926.) What Musmanno did at any particular
time was always determined by how many votes he thought it would
bring him. '

In Spirit of Sedition Act, Violating Constitution,
Musmanno Forges Ahead

In 1950, Musmanno was a Common Pleas Court Iudge, and entered
a political campaign for Lieutenant-Governor. With McCarthy getting
big headlines for calling Truman a Communist, it looked as if red-
baiting would make the best political hay. Musmanno plunged into
his red-baiting campaign with no holds barred. He demanded that
the Pittsburgh Communist Party leaders be arrested. District Attorney
William A. Rahauser answered that he could not make the arrests,
since there was no proof that the intended victims had violated a law.

But Iudge Musmanno was operating in the spirit of the Sedition Act.
He would take an act that is legal, and use it as evidence for a
frame-up. He went to the Communist Party headquarters, and asked
Dolsen for some literature that was on sale there. Dolsen sold to him,
as to anybody else. This literature department had been operating
publicly for many years, and was open to anybody who wanted to buy.

Perhaps since his rebuff from District Attorney Rahauser, Mus-
manno felt he couldn't get anyone to agree with him that this literature
transaction was evidence of an attempt to overthrow the government.
At any rate, operating again in the spirit of the Sedition Act, he
disregarded the regular legal channels, and took the job of policeman
and raided the literature office to obtain his evidence and arrest his
victims, —- all to the accompaniment of newspapermen and photog-
raphers to assure him publicity for his campaign.

But that was not all. When Nelson, Onda and Dolsen were ar-
rainged for a hearing, the Magistrate proposed to set bail at $10,000-
already an unreasonably high amount. Musmanno demanded that
bail be set at $100,000, which was of course the same as denying the
right of bail completely—in defiance of the Constitution. Who would
take the dirty job of arguing for this illegal procedure? Musmanno
the judge, who had become Musmanno the policeman, now turned
himself into Musmanno the prosecutor, and brazenly made the
demand. (Which, by the way, was rejected.)

To show how low this hungry politician will stoop to gain office.
we skip a year from the time he engineered his first election campaign
stunt under the Sedition Act. Now he had behind him the conviction
of Dolsen and Onda. But the publicity didn't pay off. Musmanno was
defeated for Lieutenant-Govemor. However, he was already engaged
in another political campaign — for justice of the State Supreme Court.
His red-baiting anti-communist crusade must become more sensational.

-12..

 

 

 

 

So he took on the role of a detective. He would put on an act of
tracking down Steve Nelson.

Actually, of course, Musmanno knew that Steve Nelson was help-
lessly bedridden with injuries from an auto accident, and that since
leaving the hospital he was recuperating in the home of a friend in
Philadelphia. The newspapers had many times published this infor-
mation, including his exact address. But Iudge Musmanno travelled
to Philadelphia, and accompanied by two detectives, stormed into
Nelson's sick-room, stared at him a few moments as he lay out-
stretched on the bed with his crutches beside him, and tauntingly
asked: "When are you coming back to Pittsburgh, Steve?" Nelson told
him to get out, and he left. Musmanno had accomplished his mission.
He reported to the newspapers that he found and spoke to Steve
Nelson. It should be recorded, though, that one of the deputies
lingered behind to Whisper to Nelson: "I'm sorry. I didn't know I
was being dragged into anything this low."

Musmanno could not act as the trial judge in this Pittsburgh
sedition case, but he DID have the power to select the judge to preside
over Steve Nelson's second trial which began last December. At this
time, Musmanno had already won the election for justice of the State
Supreme Court (with less than 10% of the voters participating in the
primaries). His political ambition, however, was far from satisfied.
He had written a book once in which he imagined himself to be
President of the United States. As this pamphlet is being written, he is
encouraging a boom for himself as the next Governor of Pennsylvania.
In order to guarantee a successful conclusion to his stunt for perse-
cuting Steve Nelson, Musmanno picked as the judge for this trial a
Harry M. Montgomery, vice-president of Americans Battling Com-
munism. The nature of this organization is illustrated by the following
incident.

Who DOES Stand for Force and Violence?

Iust before his second trial, Nelson was ordered by Judge Mont-
gomery to go to the Pittsburgh West Penn Hospital for some medical
tests in connection with his automobile accident injuries, to see if he
was fit to undergo a trial. This hospital is used by the Camegie-
Illinois Steel Corporation, a subsidiary of the U. S. Steel. Dr. I. Huber
Wagner, head surgeon for the U. S. Steel Corp., was appointed by
the court to perform the tests.

At the hospital, Nelson was given an anasthetic. Iust a few minutes
after he regained consciousness from it, a man about 40 years old,

-13-

 

flashing a revolver, stormed into the ward shouting that he was a
member of Americans Battling Communism, and approached Nelson
with a threat to kill him. Fortunately, a coal-miner in an adjoining bed
came to the rescue and helped Nelson throw the gunman out. The
gangster, however, felt free to remain in the corridor for another ten
minutes to make threats and utter vile curses to Nelson's wife and
two children who were visiting him that day. In the meantime,
hospital attendants came on the scene. But this gunman who boasted
membership in Americans Battling Communism was allowed to walk
out of the hospital. No arrest was made.

Guilty of Reoson—Con You Outlaw Ideas?

We have seen that because this Sedition trial was based on a lie,
each step in the prosecution had to be carried out by someone who
cared nothing for constitutional or human rights—and that Musmanno
took the role of policeman, detective, prosecutor and judge-picker.
To complete this case, another assault on our American way of life
was needed. A person must come into the courtroom to interpret the
books being used as evidence. He will be an "expert" witness
He will claim that his interpretation is the only one that people have
a legal right to hold—that anyone with a different interpretation must
go to jail—perhaps for 20 years.

Now there are scholars, writers, professors, who might speak with
authority on these books. But they would want their views to be
presented to the public——to be studied, discussed, and then acted upon
—perhaps at the ballot-box*. Only a pompous faker with an axe
to grind would claim that anyone who holds a different idea has
thereby broken the law. In our country, if we abide by the First
Amendment guaranteeing free speech, what a person believes or reads
or speaks can't be illegal (unless he slanders someone); only his acts
that lead to public disorder can be illegal.

And so this policy of taking ideas out of the public arena and into
the courtroom is contrary to every democratic principle known to man.
This is putting books on trial. Such matters could not be decided by
jurors even if all 12 of them were Einsteins. Each man wants the right

‘Because Musmanno was allowed, even after he demonstrated his ignorance, to
claim that the Communists advocate "force and violence," it was necessary for Steve
Nelson to call Dr. Herbert Aptheker, a real historian and Marxist scholar, to expose
Musmanno's distortions. Dr. Aptheker cited history to show that Communists advocate
Socialism as their ultimate aim. and that the monopolies which fear Socialism and
oppose labor resort to force and violence to keep themselves in power. This case, how-
ever, was to be decided not on historical facts, but on "dangerous thoughts" that Mus-
manno claimed he could see in Steve Nelson's mind.

-14-

 

 

to use his own reason. . Any other way puts us in a mental straight-
jacket and leads directly to concentration camps for all who oppose
the views of those in power. Who will dishonor himself by stepping
forward as an "expert" witness in these fascist-like thought-control
trials?

That, too, is a job that fits Musmanno.

At the very outset, he demonstrated that he was not familiar with
the material he undertook to explain. He admitted that of the 180
books, in evidence, he had read only four. When he was asked about
his understanding of CAPITAL, by Karl Marx, which is the main
Marxist theoretical study, he answered that he had read it only
slightly, because it was "too dull and heavy" for him to study.

Besides lacking scholarship. Musmanno was committed to fascist
beliefs that disqualified him. He had chosen Italy as a place to study
law while Mussolini was imposing his bloody dictatorship there, and
praised the use of violence that was directed against the workers by
the fascist storm-troopers. Musmanno is therefore such a blind uncom-
promising opponent of Marxism as to make him totally unfit to render
the objective judgment required in trials by law. Even Judge Mont-
gomery, vice-president of Americans Battling Communism, felt uncom-
fortable as Steve Nelson in his second trial exposed the fakery of
Musmanno's pretentions. We quote from the record:

NELSON: "Your Honor, I object to Musmanno being brought here
as an expert."

COURT: "I don't know whether he (the prosecutor) can qualify
him."

NELSON: "I don't think he can. It's like asking Hitler to express
an opinion on democracy."

COURT:  . . I would certainly afford him the opportunity of
showing that he has more knowledge than you or I or any other
member of the jury has. . . 

NELSON: Your Honor, you can't be an employer operating an
open-shop and qualify on the rights and duties of trade unions."

COURT: "Well, I don't know."

NELSON: "Consequently, you couldn't have him qaulified as an
expert on issues that he deliberately tries to distort."

At this point there was a hurried exchange of glances between
Musmanno and Montgomery. and then:

_15_

 

COURT: "I think we are going to recess. We are supposed to

‘ recess at one o'clock. However, we are going to recess at "this time,

anyhow!"

But even if Musmanno was an expert on what Communists
advocate instead of a faker, who is going to crawl into Steve Nelson's

mind to determine what his interpretation was while he was reading
these books?

The court does not attempt to answer this question. This is a witch-
hunt. so the prosecutors do not have to observe logic or reason.‘ Let us
recreate a scene from this tragic comedy of errors.  ’ '

Placed on a big hand truck alongside the prosecution table was a
pile of several hundred books and pamphlets—studies in economics,
political science, peace movements, history, philosophy, etc.‘ Some
are by Marxists and some by other recognized scholars. The prosecutor
picked up a handful of them and said to the court:

"Your Honor, we have some books here merely for identification
and we offer them in evidence without reading."

Nelson shot back:

"Why doesn't the prosecution put it on a scale? That would be
the way to do it: by the pound. What is the difference what is in them?"

But remember, dear reader, these are not lines from a play. The
prosecutors rest their case on this literature. People are to be locked
in jail for many years on the charge that they have dangerous thoughts.

This Poison Spreads

Some who are reading this pamphlet may deplore this abuse by
our courts and yet feel that it is onlybecause the defendants are
Communists that Steve Nelson and the others are being persecuted.
Supreme Court Justice William Douglas warned against this ostrich-
like attitude in these words: "Suspicion grows until today only the
orthodox idea is the safe one. Suspicion grows until only the person
who loudly proclaims the orthodox view, who once having been a
Communist, has been converted, is trustworthy. Fear runs rampant."

The Philadelphia Tribune, a leading Negro weekly, warns that by
such reasoning, "If a white person enters a Negro home, that Negro
is ipso facto a Communist."

Steve Nelson said to the jury: ”This is a thought-control trial where
judgment is based on what books are to be read and what books are

_'|6_

 

 

not to be read. Now what is thought-control? What does it mean?
It means you can't readvwhat you want. You can't listen to what you
want. You can't say what you want. And if you object, you will be

Ill

called a ’seditionist .

Stoolpigeons Thrive on Musmannoism

Having opened the halls of justice to unprincipled politicians and
unreasonable rules of evidence, it is only natural that stool-pigeons
and labor spies should also be allowed to enter the door. It is now
our sad duty to introduce Matt Cvetic, who was used as "expert"
witness to interpret Steve Nelson’s intentions, just as it was Mus-
manno's business to interpret the literature.

g Cvetic, according to his story, became an informer for the FBI
shortly after he was ordered by a court to pay his sister—in-law $300
damages in a case growing out of a midnight assault on the woman
while she was a guest in his home. He also broke her wrist.

Concealing this court record, he joined the Communist Party in
Pittsburgh. For several years he actively participated in a program
supported by the Communists, to unite Slav-Americans behind Roose-
velt's win-the-war policies. Secretly, however, Cvetic was sending re-
ports to employers and his FBI superiors on conversations of militant
unionists and Pro-Roosevelt members of other organizations, all of
whom he indiscriminately called Communists (probably because the
more reports he sent, the more pay he got.)

In 1950, when the Communist Party was helping organize strike
relief for miners, he revealed himself as a stool-pigeon and made
himself available, at $34 a day, as an expert witness on Communist
Party intentions. Since none of the activities he observed or engaged
in were illegal, he confined his testimony to conversations he claimed
he had heard. Now let us go to Steve Nelson's trial record to see
how Cvetic fits into this frame-up.

Cvetic had just stated that he received many thousands of dollars
for magazine stories and moving picture scripts which he admitted
contained outright lies about the Communists. This material was
advertised as based on information he supplied. Nelson was ques-
tioning him on testimony in a previous trial——for which he was also
paid—that he gave about a woman who thereafter lost her job.

NELSON: "Is it true that after you testified in that case her
employers decided that your accusations against that woman were
unfounded, and reinstated her in her position?"

-17-

 

j!‘
(I
.

 

PROSECUTOR: "This is objected to."
COURT: "Objection sustained." '

NELSON: "I think it is important. I want to show this man will
appear anywhere and testify against anybody.”

COURT: "You have already shown that."

NELSON: "I want to show the way he fingers innocent people
for money."

COURT: "You are doing that."

NELSON: "I want to show that this man can get up and testify
against anybody for money and that's what he is doing here . . ."

COURT: "He’s admitted that."

NELSON: (continuing) "That time and time again he has been
repudiated (in other cases where he testified for money).

COURT: "That doesn't say he is to be repudiated here. . . .”

Jurors Themselves on Trial Make Fair Verdict Impossible

Under normal conditions. of course, a witness like Cvetic would
be repudiated. In fact, a prosecutor would not dare to go before a
jury with testimony from an admitted liar. But in this case, where books
and ideas were on trial, the evidence presented had no bearing on the
jury's verdict.

The jurors felt that they themselves were on trial. If they returned
a verdict other than what the prosecutor demanded, they feared that
they themselves would be labeled "Communists", subject to the same
persecutions. One of the talesman who was being considered for the
jury in the Nelson case asked: "If I should be convinced that Steve
Nelson is not guilty, then will I be called a Communist too?" It took
courage for him to express the fear that dominated other juror's minds.
But, for his courage, he was rejected as a juror by the prosecution.

On the jury for the Steve Nelson case there were seven members
who were employed in plants controlled by the Mellon interests. And
in a city like Pittsburgh where the Mellons and other big interests
control the political and economic life of the people, the economic
security of every member of that jury depended either directly or
indirectly on those interests. "

Federal Smith Act Prosecutions Open Way for Frame-Ups

If the perversion of justice described here were confined to Pitts-

burgh, we might feel that what we have here is like an ugly little .

sore on a body that is otherwise healthy, and that in the process of
normal living—with perhaps a little extra attention—the condition will
return to no;mal. But the way for this judicial abuse was opened by
the Federal government two years earlier—in 1948—when it prosecuted
the eleven Communist Party leaders in New York for advocating
"Roosevelt's policy of friendship with the Soviet Union as against
‘Truman's bi-partisan policy of preparing for war.

Since then, the Federal government has instituted similar prosecu-
tions in other states and in Hawaii, and threatens to spread them until
every part of our country would be infested with these frame-ups.
Onda, Dolsen and Nelson are now indicted even while they wait for
an appeal from their conviction on the Pennsylvania Sedition Act.
Three others in the same district arrested by the Federal government
are Irving Weissman, Ben Carreathers and William Albertson. Now
the six are awaiting trial.

The Federal government uses the Smith Act for framing up its
victims. Of course, the indictments do not say that they are prosecuted
for their stand on peace. Instead, they are charged with conspiring
to teach the overthrow of the government by force and violence. And
the Federal government set the example for the State prosecutors for
bolstering this lie. The only proof that is offered to support the charge
is that the defendants had ideas and expressed them. The ideas are
made unlawful on the basis of books that freely circulate in the public
library or that you may have in your home.

Here is what U. S. Supreme Court Iustic William Douglas said in
an opinion dissenting from the conviction in the first Smith Act trial:
"The doctrine of conspiracy has served divers and oppressive pur-
poses and in its broad reach can be made to do great evil. But never
until today has anyone seriously thought that the ancient law of
conspiracy could constitutionally be used to turn speech into seditious
conduct. Yet that is precisely what is suggested. I repeat that we
deal here with speech alone, not with speech plus acts of sabotage or
unlawful conduct. Not a single seditious act is charged in the
indictment."

Besides showing how to trample on the Constitutional right of free
speech, the Federal government also set an example to the Pittsburgh

-19-

 

 

 

prosecutors on the use of witnesses that ordinarily would be thrown
out of a courtroom. Thus in the Smith Act trial in New York, the
federal prosecutor used the testimony of a stoolpigeon, who, while he
was a spy in the Communist Party, convinced his own brother-in-law
to become a Communist in good faith—only to report him to the FBIE

Judge Montgomery, vice-president of Americans Battling Commu-
nism, who presided over the Steve Nelson case, had a good example,
too, for rushing Steve Nelson to trial without benefit of defense coun-
sel. Iudge Harold Medina, in the earlier Federal trial in New York.
nursed such hatred for the defense attorneys that be sentenced them
for contempt of court; and on this, U. S. Supreme Court Iustice Hugo
Black said in a dissenting opinion that Medina's actions "impress me
as showing such bitter hostility to the lawyers that the accuser

(Medina) should be disqualified to try them."

The conditions surrounding the jury which made it impossible for a
fair trial in the Pittsburgh cases operated even more unfairly in the
New York federal case. We quote again from Iustice Black: " . . . the
records show a discriminatory selection of the jury panel which pre-
vented a trial before a representative cross-section of the community;
the record shows that one member of the trial jury was violently hos-
tile to petitioners before and during the trial."

Ugly Shadow of Hitlerism

When trials by Musmannos and Cvetics replace due process of law,
there is always a danger of government-sponsored lawlessness and
violence against the people. Who does not remember the riotous out-
breaks against minorities——the inhuman torture of prisoners—that the
fascist governments led or encouraged wherever their kangaroo system
of justice was established?

The same danger hovers over our own United States. We have
mentioned how no attempt was made to arrest a gunman from Ameri-
cans Battling Communism who invaded Steve Nelson's hospital room.
On the other hand, 30 FBI men—yes, thirty—were assigned each day
to watch the home in Philadelphia where Nelson was bedridden with
a broken leg, a fractured shoulder and cracked ribs. Since these un-
constitutional trials under the Smith Act began, similar hordes of FBI
men have been trailing men and women who are outspoken in their
opposition to Truman's foreign policy. What a waste of taxpayers
money, and much worse, what a frightening resemblance to fascist,
police-state thought control!

Warmakers Will Not Crush the Right to Speak for Peace

But observers at the Pittsburgh trials report that people understand,
and are ﬁghting back.

For instance, in the early days of the Steve Nelson trial, only a
small handful of friends dared to attend. With FBI agents officiously
surveying all who entered the court room, and little groups of provoca-
teurs in the corridor insulting anyone whom they did not recognize as
their own, there was reason to be afraid, especially since the Pitts-
burgh newspapers will publicly label you a Communist on the mere
say-so of stoolpigeons like Matt Cvetic. Yet as word got around that
Nelson was defying the frame-up, and was fighting the court's legal

hocus-pocus with simple workingclass logic, more and more people
came into the courtroom to show their support.

On the day that Ben Careathers testified for him, the court-room
was crowded. Mr. Careathers, age 60, a Negro, is a Communist leader
of long standing in Western Penn-
sylvania. In the 1930's, the CIO rec-
ognized his popularity among the
workers, and made him an organ-
izer for the steel union. One of the
six Pittsburgh Smith Act victims
scheduled for trial later, he was re-
leased from jail only five months
ago, where he had been confined for
two months until $20,000 bail was
raised to free him.

On this day, his friends expected
to say goodbye to him again. For
they knew that as soon as he got on
the witness stand, the Iudge could

BEN CAREA1-HER; ask him to give the names of others

in the Communist Party; and there

was of course no question but what Mr. Careathers would refuse to

play a stoolpigeon role. Then he would be cited for contempt, and re-

turned to jail. "A little risk now to defend Steve's right to speak for
peace might save us from World War III,” he explained.

After Mr. Careathers testified, scores of people rushed up to him
in the recess to shake his hand—in clear sight of the FBI men or any
Cvetics looking on.

It is encouraging, too, that hundreds of people donated their dollars
to pay for the publishing of this pamphlet. It shows that they want to
help in the fight for free speech. It does not necessarily mean that they
subcribe to the ideas that Steve Nelson and the other Communists hold.
It means only that they know that if Steve Nelson, Andy Onda and
James Dolsen are denied the right to speak for peace, then others -
who may have a different idea of how to bring peace, will be denied
the right to express their views, too. The Musmannos and Cvetics and
Medinas who serve the warmakers will surely be stopped it all of us
who cherish the U. S. Constitution will do our part to defend it.

organization (or group) about the dangers we face from repressive
legislation.

Please send me a free copy of VOICES FOR F'REEDOM—a collection of
opinions onthe recent Supreme Court decision upholding the Smith Act,
including the historic dissents of Justices Black and Douglas.

 

Preface

HE story told in the following pages provides a back-

ground to one of the mighty dramas of our time. We
are all too likely to think of heroes and superb acts of
heroism as belonging to the past, and we are all too slow
to recognize them as part of our present struggle.

Yet the struggle of Steve Nelson and the drama of
Steve Nelson's battle for justice, for America and for
human decency in the courts of Pittsburgh, is an act of
heroism worthy to rank with any of our time.

It is a criminal misnomer to term this case ”The people
against Steve Nelson," as it is officially noted in the court
record. In all truth it can be named in only one fashion,
”Steve Nelson for the people of the United States against
fascism, war, indecency and injustice.”

In this prosecution in Pittsburgh, other men stood with
Steve Nelson. His central role does not and cannot detract
from their own stature and heroism. What follows is the
story of all these men. Read it carefully and with a deep
sense of history, for it contains not only a significant part
of’ your own destiny, but the destiny of unborn genera-
tions of Americans as well.

HOWARD F AST

  

 

It is March, 1952.

In the past year, three men in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-—members
of the Communist Party——have been convicted under the Pennsylvania
State Sedition Act, charged with attempting to overthrow by force and
violence the government of Pennsylvania and the government of the
Unied States. The main evidence against them was that they possessed
and circulated literature. If they are actually guilty of planning any
force and violence against anyone, then we in Pennsylvania—and in
other states, too—should feel insecure as long as they are in our midst.

Well, they are among us (free until their appeal is decided). They
live in homes. They have neighbors and associate with many different
kinds of people. Yet no one ‘really feels alarmed, even though there
is no question but what they believe and act in the same manner
as before. ’

Here is their record — past and present.

Progressive —— Yes . . . But where is the crime?

James H. Dolsen, age 66, a journalist, is one of those convicted.
Descended from one of the first settlers on Neue Amsterdam, now
New York City, and counting among his forefathers a fighter in the
American Revolution, Dolsen became associated with progressive
labor newspapers as soon as he left
college. In the late 1920's, when the
anti-imperialist struggles were de-
veloping in China, he visited that
country and wrote a book about that
movement. For the past 10 years he
has been a correspondent for the
Daily Worker —— a newspaper that
stands for Socialism and that sup-
ports the Communist Party's efforts
to achieve it.

He is still on this job. And as
before, so now, he writes mainly of
the struggles of the common people
  .. ———for better living conditions, for the
JAMES H. DOLSEN rights of Negroes and other minori-
ties, for peace.

 

Then there is Andy Onda, a son of Slovak immigrants. At eighteen,
he was already working in the Jones and Laughlin steel mills in Pitts-

burgh’s Southside. Hours were 12 or more a day, and the pay was

low. There was no union then. Later, when he learned that William Z.
Foster was a Communist, he remem-
bered that it was this same man who
stood up against the steel trusts in
an attempt to organize the workers
in the A. F. of L. It was as a Com-

‘ munist that Onda participated in the
CIO steel organizing campaign in
the 1930's.

Today Onda has a serious heart
condition, and is unwillingly inac-
tive. But in his closing address to
the jury, in his own behalf, he boldly
defended his activities as a Commu-
nist, and declared that the rest of his
life would be devoted to following

ANDY ONDA his principles.

- Steve Nelson is the third de-
fendant. Since the newspapers and radio constantly refer to him
mysteriously as the "top Red," you may want a more detailed descrip-
tion of him.

 

Like millions of other people from working class families, Steve
Nelson had to go to work before he finished grammar school. He
learned carpentry and joined the union as soon as he was eligible.
Since employment in the building trades is seasonal, he also worked
in the stockyards and the steel mills-—at Iones 6: Laughlin in Aliquippa.
While still in his 20's (he is now 49) he became interested in books and
ideas on how to improve living conditions of the working people.

But you want to know what led up to his being charged with at-
tempting to overthrow the government by force and violence. Let him
tell you in the words he used in the courtroom. He is speaking a few
months after the case in which he was originally a defendant with
Onda and Dolsen. Nelson had been injured in an automobile accident
in the middle of that trial, and separated from the case. He was tried
alone, and without an attorney to help him. He and his wife Margaret
had written to 700 lawyers in the county asking them to represent him.
but the red-baiting hysteria had penetrated their ranks, too, and they
were afraid that they would be branded as Communist sympathizers
if they accepted a Communist client. Only two lawyers agreed to

serve, but they asked for two weeks to acquaint themselves with the
record and to study the literature that the prosecutors were using as
evidence of sedition. The judge refused to grant a delay. So we hear
Nelson as he conducts his own defense, giving this description of his
activities:

"During the depression, ladies and gentlemen, I was arrested and
I was tried before a jury of twelve people. The charge against me was
'force and violence,’ for organizing the unemployed and insisting that
our government ought to pass an Unemployment Insurance Bill, that
taxes should be put on the rich so that when a man loses a job through
no fault of his own he gets unemployment insurance. Well, at that
time, the people were able to see through that conspiracy. The jury
found me 'not guilty.’ And I will tell you something, we were the first
ones to draft an unemployment insurance bill in this country, and I
had something to do with that as a young man in 1930."

"And in this very State, scores of times I lead delegations to the
State Legislature For what did we go down there? To overthrow the
Government? We went down there and we said to the State Legisla-

-7-

 

  

ture: 'Pass an emergency bill to feed the unemployed.’ I was one of
those delegates."

"I was then an organizer in the Anthracite coal area. The prosecu-
tion said they were going to bring out my activities in the Anthracite.
But they didn't, and had good reason not to. It's an open book. Thou-
sands of people know what I have done, even though it was over
twenty years ago, and I am proud of every inch of that work."

"Then on foreign issues. We stated in the early 1930's when Hitler
came to power, that he was planning war on all the democratic na-
tions, including the United States. At that time big politicians used to
make trips to Europe and have pictures taken with the Nazi generals.
William Randolph Hearst, publisher of the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph,
had his picture taken with Hess——you recall the name. When he
came back he said, ‘You have got to support Hitler.’ and many backers
gave arms to Hitler and Mussolini and we said that was wrong, and
"because we said that, we were called foreign agents."

"Ladies and gentlemen, Hitler and Tojo used those American loans
we made to shoot our own people down. You know that. I was active
then in an organization known as the League Against War and
Fascism. I was its membership secretary."

"I will show you what we did then. We fought against these loans
to Tojo and Mussolini and Hitler and we said that the democratic
countries ought to get together and prevent Hitler from attacking
other nations and we opposed the terrible things Hitler did against
the Jews in Germany."

"There was another story brought out here. I fought in Spain. I
was one of the 3,000 American volunteers. We felt that if democracy
in Spain was overthrown by force and violence of Mussolini and
Hitler, that the next step was going to war against our own country.
And three years after that war did occur against our nation."

Still For Peace — Is It a Crime?

Steve Nelson brought his record of activity up to date when the
prosecutor introduced a pamphlet which calls upon people to protest
the war in Korea. As the prosecutor started to argue that this call for
peace was "seditious,” Nelson interrupted. We quote from the record:

NELSON: "Your Honor, I would like to know what the prosecution
intends to show with this document. It appears that he wants to justify

-3-

 

 

the continuation of the war in Korea when the majority of the country
doesn't want it."

COURT: "They are reading. . . ."

NELSON: (interrupting) "instead of stopping it."

COURT: "They are reading papers-in your possession. . . 
NELSON: ”Well, it is wrong that citizens of the United States be

opposed to the policies of the Administration?"
COURT: "You can argue that later."

NELSON: "They can't say I went out and told the soldiers to
refuse to go. We said: ‘Write to Congress. Tell Congress to stop

III

the war.

COURT: "If you want to enter an objection to it, or another reason
for your objection, we will note it."

NELSON: "I will state another reason, Your Honor."
PROSECUTOR: ”I object to these speeches."

NELSON: "In 1847 when this country fought a war against
Mexico. . . ."

COURT: (shouting) "Wait a minute."

NELSON: (continuing) "Lincoln got up“ and opposed‘ it. He was
Congressman at that time and said that we‘ had no business going
into that war." a ' ‘ '

COURT: (still shouting) "Mr. Nelson. . . ."
NELSON: (continuing) ”I am doing the same thing, your Honor."

COURT: "Restrain this defendant by force, or will you calm down
and be seated?"

The next page of the court record shows that even after the Iudge's
threat, Nelson continued to speak, telling the jury and the audience
in the court-room that because he calls for an .end to the war in Korea,
he is facing 20 years in jail. But no matter how courageously he stands
up for his right of free speech, there is a danger that he will be silenced.
For with the Pennsylvania Sedition Act in operation, the courts can
jail anyone who expresses ideas that Big Business doesn't like. If we
look back to 1919, when the law was passed, we will see that this was
its purpose. V
