uprising led by Phol Ba Duct in Pathet Lao (Laos) in 1910
and merging into a guerrilla war which lasted till 1935, the
Thainguyen revolt in 1917, and the Yenbai Revolt in 1930.

The current warfare in Indo-China is, therefore a conti-
nuation of this century-old struggle for liberation from colo-
nialism. The fact that the French have proclaimed the “inde-
pendence” of the Associated States of Indo-China has de-
ceived no‘ one with a knowledge of this protracted struggle.
For, throughout this century of warfare, the French on
numerous occasions have sought to undermine and destroy
the ‘liberation forces by various kinds of tactical maneuvers
and phonyvconcessions. ‘

“Treaties” between leaders recognized by the French and
the colonial administration were frequent devices for under-
mining the peoples’ resistance. France signed such “treaties”
with the Nguyen Dynasty (Bao Dai’s family) of Viet-Nam
in 1862; with the Kingdoms of Viet-Nam and Khmer in 1884;
with the Kingdom of Pathet Lao (Laos) in 1893, and again.

' ‘ in 1899. All these “treaties” contained solemn French promises

to guard and promote the welfare of the peoples.

After World War II, when the French were faced with a
liberation struggle more powerful than before, France began
demagogic promises of “independence.” New “treaties” incor-
porating this promise were signed with the Kingdom of
Pathet Lao on ]an. 7, 1946, with the Kingdom of Khmer in
the same year, with the three Kingdoms of Khmer, Pathet
Lao and Viet-Nam in 1949, and against on July 3, 1953. In

each of these treaties, and particularly the ]uly 3, 1953 agree- A V”

ments to which President Eisenhower referred, the French
pledge of full independence was made subject to the require-
ments of the “French Union,” a term which connotes the vol-
untary, democratic association of the peoples in French-
governed territories on a basis of equality, but which the
French colonialists equate with “French Empire.” The Em-
pire’s rulers, who are obviously in Paris, were thus given veto
power over “autonomous” members of the Empire. And it is
this condition which disposes-- of the ﬁction of “independence.”

9 ‘But what is more important is a fact which the Administra-
tion has tried to conceal from the American people. This is
that the French also signed such a “treaty” with Ho  Minh,
President of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. This
agreement of March 6, 1946 stipulated that the French Gov-
ernment recognized the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam as
a “free state having its own government, parliament, arm
and ﬁnance.” - -

But like other treaties the French had signed, it was a
mere scrap of paper to which the Paris government paid no
attention. The day_ following its signature French troops in
South Viet-Nam launched attacks on Viet Nam forces, French
officers at Hanoi refused to give over the customs control to
Vietnamese representatives. In November, the French bom-
barded Hanoi and precipitated the carnage which has de-
stroyed so many lives of theAFrench, Indo-Chinese and Afri-
can peoples for eight years. "Today, certain circles in our
country want to destroy American lives as well.

Such is the truth about the character of thewar in Indo-
China. It is a truth which other, more far-sighted Americans,
are compelled to concede. For instance, in the Aug: 14, 1951

issue of Lock magazine, U.S. Supreme Court Associate ]us- ‘

tice William 0. Douglas wrote:

“We throw our military power as well as our inﬂuence be-'

hind some of the most vicious elements in Asia. I was in

Asia in 1950 when Indo-China asked the United States for D

military aid against the Viets. A shudder passed through
Southeast Asia when General Marshall replied that the gov-
ernment of Indo-China could be assured that America would
send.planes and tanks to help her ﬁght the Communists. Of
course, the rebels in Indo-China are Communist-led. But the

"French imposed on Indo-China one of the most vicious colo-

nial systems in all history. If any power had’ done to us what
the French have done to the people of Indo-China, we would
produce the most glorious revolution the world‘ ever wit-

" nessed.”

11

 

 

  

These facts expose the falseness of Dulles’ statement that

 

Indo-China under French rule is characterized by an “or- s

derly development to independence” which the “Communist
aggressors” are trying to destroy (Speech to the Overseas
Press Club of America, ‘March 29, 1954). Dulles means by
“orderly development” What King George meant in the 1770’s
in respect to the American colonists. But the Indo-Chinese
took their example from Washington and Jeilerson, and as
]ustice Douglas also points out, based their very Declaration
of Independence on ‘our document. What of Dulles’ claim
that the Communists “whipped up the spirit of national-
ism until it became violent,” thereby precipitating the war?

The record of uprisings, revolts and protracted wars of
liberation since French occupation of the country in 1857
disposes of this claim. Dulles obviously ‘assumes that the

American people are totally ignorant of the history of
Indo-China.

Who are Ho Chi Minh and the Vietminh?

_ What of. Dulles’ charge that President Ho Chi Minh is a
“Kremlin agent” who has imposed Communist rule over the

_ Viet-Nam areas ‘under his control?

    

This “Kremlin agent” charge, be it remembered, has been
handed down from Hitler to Mussolini to Franco to Hiro-
hito to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. -It is, in the
mouth of notorious Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy,
a name for ex-Presidents Roosevelt and Truman as well as
themajority of the American people. . - -

- It is true that Ho visited Moscow, that he visited China
during the beginning of the Chinese revolution under Sun
Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek. But he was also in Paris to-

gether with 100,000 Vietnamese troops and 40,000 Vietnamese ’

workers during World War I. And prior to that, since his
boyhood and throughout his life, Ho Chi Minh had been a
leader of the Indo-China peoples’ struggles for independence.
This fact Dulles does not tell us.

12

Nor does he tell us that Ho was the leader of the Indo-
China resistance to Japanese militarism at a time when our
,, national "existence was threatened by the Fascist Axis, and
when our military position in the Far East was under ]apanese
attack. Dulles does not mention that Bao Dai and the French
puppet Kings of Laos and Cambodia collaborated with the
Japanese along with the Vichy French, and placed at the
disposal of Japanese militarism the full resources of their coun-
tries, while Ho Chi Minh led the liberation struggle which
had helped defeat the Japanese before our troops were in a
position to help. '
Nor does Dulles tell us that the Vietminh (The Viet-Nam
Independence League) was established amidst this struggle
against Japanese militarism on May 19, 1941 (before the at-
tack on Pearl Harbor) at a joint conference of political par-
ties and groups including Buddhists, Catholics, Peasants,
Businessmen, Women and Youth organizations and the Na-
tionalists, Socialist and Communist Parties. It was this repre-
sentative conference which elected Ho Chi Minh its President.
Dulles omits to tell us that similar liberation organizations
were set up in Cambodia and Laos; that on Sep. 2, 1945, the '
Vietminh proclaimed establishment of Independence which
quoted from our own Decralation of 1776; that the new gov-
ernment held National Assembly elections on a nation-wide
scale and on the basic of universal, equal and direct suffrage
irrespective of nationality, belief, property ownership or sex,
in which 90 per cent of the people participated and gave the
Vietminh 230 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly; that
even today, of the 16 members of President Ho Chi Minh’s
Cabinet, only ﬁve are Communists, the others including
Catholics, Buddhists, businessmen, intellectuals, and workers.
All these facts give the lie to ' the Administration. They
show that not only is the real issue in Indo-China a struggle
of the people for independence from colonialism, but that
this struggle has a leadership representative of all sections of
the nation engaged in it. It is an all-embracing national strug-
gle for independence.

' 18

  

III. Whose “Vital Interests”?

WHAT OF THE claim, then, that if Indo-China’s people win this
struggle the “vital” interests of the United States will be
placed in peril?

Here, we have to ask, what “vital” interests? Or more to
the point,’ WHOSE vital interests? In attempting to answer
this question we come upon some interesting facts, the chief
one being the not-so-well-known fact that certain interests
in our country have been attempting to intervene in Indo-
China since the end of World War II.

In 1944, Ho offered his cooperation to the Allies against
Japanese militarism, and requested particularly U.S. military
sup ort and recognition of Viet-Nam’s independence under
the Atlantic Charter. _“The Americans made no promises,”
reports Roger Pinto, writing in the United Nations World of
April 1950, “but those in Kunming did begin supplying the
Vietminh resistance ﬁghters with arms. The Vietminh began
guerrilla warfare against the ]aps in northern Tonl<in. They
helped American pilots shot down in Indochina to escape,
and they fought with American equipment parachuted to
them; . . . Late in 1944, an American pilot ﬂew him to China,
‘where he called on General Claire Chennault in Kunming.”

That, be it remembered, happened while Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was still in command of U.S. military and political

olicy.

P iWith the establishment of the Democratic Republic of
Viet-Nam, the reactionary circles in our country began to plot
the seizure of Indo-China from French control. The Office
of Strategic Services .(OSS ), under General William Donovan
(who is now Ambassador to Thailand, bordering Indo-
Chinal ), carried on the preliminary intrigue and scheming to
accomplish this aim.

Hoping to seize control of the people's liberation move-
ment, OSS men began in late 1945 to encourage Vietnamese

resistance to the French govemment’s plan for re-establishing

French control. Led by Major Patti, OSS men told the Viet-
14 ‘

 

  

namese that since France had not participated in the Potsdam
Conference, no agreement existed that French sovereignty
should be restored. In return for this support, in October
1945, the U.S. offered Ho Chi Minh economic assistance in
exchange for concessions to be extended solely to the Ameri-
cans, allowing the establishment of air bases, railroads, and

. ‘roads by U.S. companies.

Ho Chi Minh refused. And from his refusal can be dated
the hostility in our country toward the Vietminh and the
Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam.

On September 22, 1947, the Truman Administration sent
the arch-reactionary, pro-Vichy former U.S. Ambassador to
France, William Bullitt, to confer with French colonial author-
ities in Indo-China. Bullitt’s mission was to try to persuade
the French to restore Bao Dai to the Annamite throne.

Emile Bollaert, French High Commissioner in Indo-China,
in reporting his conversation with Bullitt, noted that: “Mr.
Bullitt seems to show special interest in economic’ ques-
tions. . . .” A -.

Record of [Intervention

Eight months after Bullitt proposed Bao Dai’s ‘restoration,
the French had established a puppet regime for Viet-Nam,

. signed a treaty‘ with Bao Dai “recognizing the independence

of Viet-Nam,” with Viet-Nam “proclaiming its allegiance to
the French Union” and promising to “respect the rights and
interests of French nationals.” In September 1948, almost a
year from the day he had proposed Bao‘ Dai’s restoration,
Bullitt met Bao Dai in Geneva for mutual congratulations and
lans. And with Bao Dai’s assumption, in ]une 1949, of the
role of “Chief of State” of the puppet Viet-Nam regime, U.S.
big business circles intensiﬁed their efforts to seize the com-
manding positions in Indo-China’s economy. The Truman
Administration’s “assistance” program was the jimmy they
used to pry open the safe. The chronology of these efforts is
asfollows:
Jan. 24, 1950, Philip C. ]essup, U.S. Ambassador at large,‘

15

 

visits Saigon to confer with Bao Dai on concessions in ex-
change for U.S. “aid” against the “Communists.” ’

Feb. 7, 1950, the U.S. Government recognizes Bao Dai
and the puppet Kings of Laos and Cambodia.

Feb. 12, 1950, the New York Times, organ of big business,
reports: “Indo-China is a prize worth a large gamble. In the
north are exportable tin, tungsten, zing, manganese, coal,
lumber and rice, and in the south are rice, rubber, tea, pep-
per, cattle and hides. . . .”

March 6, 1950, a U.S. economic mission headed by Robert
Allen Griffen arrives in Saigon to investigate investment’pos-
sibilities in Indo-China.

March 16, 1950, U.S. warships and warplanes stage a show
of strength over Saigon and in Saigon Bay. Three days later,
protest demonstrations by the population are ﬁred on, a num-
ber of person killed and wounded, others are arrested.

May 8, 1950, -U.S. announce it will send “economic aid and
military equipment” to France and its puppet regimes in
Indo-China. V

May_12, 1950, the Paris newspaper L’Aurore published an
interview with Leon Pignon, French High Commissioner in
Indo-China, in which he said: “The arrival of a number of
Americans in Viet-Nam has perhaps induced some Viet-
Namese politicians to turn their eyes towards Washington,
and away from Paris. We must not hide the fact that the
presence of more Americans will cause difficulties for us if
we are not careful.”

' ‘May 30, 1950, a U.S. economic mission headed by Robert
Blum arrives in Saigon to control the use of the U.S. “aid.”

]une 27, 1950, President Truman, directing the U.S. Navy
and Air Force to intervene in Korea and Formosa, also directs
a stepping up of “aid” to Indo-China and orders a military
mission there. \

]uly 15, 1950, a U.S. military mission arrives, tours all the
Indo-China states, especially the border with China, and
stresses importance of training puppet troops.

August 10, 1950,, ﬁrst consignment“ of U.S. war materials

_arrives in Indo-China.

16

December‘ 23, 1950, the U.S. signs treaties of mutual as-
sistance with the three puppet Indo-China regimes, obtaining
the right to supervise the use of U.S. war materials and the
right to “inspect” the resources of Indo-China.

French Imperialists Worried

March 16, 1951, according to a report in the Dutch news-
paper De Waarheid, the National Council of French Indus-
trialists complained in a memorandum to the French govern-
ment that the U.S. economic mission in Indo-China had openly
intervened in the internal affairs of Viet-Nam and had in-
duced Indo-China puppet ofﬁcials to issue directives favoring
“U.S. manufacturers. The memorandum said U.S. trusts had
thus established their control over tin mining, rubber and rice
production, as a result of which trade between France and
Indo-China had dropped whﬂe that between Indo-China and
the United States had greatly increased. '

July -25, 1951, Thomas Dewey, Governor of New York
State and a major power in the Republican Party, visits Bao
Dai in Saigon to study the “possibility of military and eco-
nomic aid being speeded up in Indo-China in the light of the
Korea armistice talks.” 1 .

September 7-8-9, 1951, the U.S. concludes  all three
puppet regimes in Indo-China agreements “eliminating res-

trictive practice” on the import of U.S. goods, permitting U.S.”

supervision of assistance, and pledging “detailed information”
on economic and military matters.

December 19, 1952, the Alsop Brothers report in their
syndicated column that with the inauguration of President
Eisenhower, a new bold plan for winning the Indo-China
war will be adopted. . '

February 3, 1953, Robert S. Allen writes in ‘his syndicated
column that Secretary Dulles is putting heat on France to
win the war in Indo-China, and is demanding that Indo-
Chinese puppet ofﬁcers be trained by the U.S.

May 2, 1953, following the liberation of Samnua province
by the Laos People’s Liberation Army (not the Vietminh),

17

  

Dulles announces “we have already taken steps to expedite
the delivery of critically-needed military items” to the French

and puppet Laos forces. _ I
‘ May; 4, 1953, Senator Alexander Wiley (R-Wis.), chair- -

man of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pro-
poses that the U.S. give atomic weapons to France to use in

Indo-China. .
June 13, 1953, puppet King Norodom Sihanoukof Cambo-

dia “ﬂees” to Thailand, where General Donovan is U.S. Am-

bassador, and declares France refuses to give Cambodia in-
dependence.

5 ,]une 18, 1953, the Paris newspaper L’Observateur says
U.S. encouragement to King Norodom Sihanoulc is motivated
by U.S. desire for (1) a port on the Cambodia coast, (2) a
strategic base on the Gulf of Siam, (3) Cambodia’s support
of a “confederation” to include Laos, Thailand and the Mala-

_ yan ‘Peninsula, as a political and military base against South- 0
east Asia.

August 18, 1953, the U.S. State Department issues a pam-
phlet entitled Indo-China: the war in Viet-Nam, Cambodia
and Laos, which reports that: “Thus far we have supplied the

French Union forces and the national . armies of Cambodia,

Laos and Viet-Nam with more than 170 million rounds of
small-arms ammunition; 16,000 transport vehicles and trailers;
850 combat vehicles; 350 military aircraft; 250 naval craft;
10,500 radio sets; 90,000 small-arms and automatic shells.”

Then "followed the succession of Eisenhower Administ1'a- ‘

tion _ pronouncements concerning Indo-China, a number ‘of
which have been quoted above. When Ho Chi Minh offered
to enter negotiations for an armistice last December, the
Eisenhower Administration ignored his proposals. Instead, as
the Wall Street I ournal reported March 10, the Administra-
tion was determined to continue the war, even if the French
pulled out. And this, even while the conferees at the Geneva

Far Eastern Conference were considering plans for a cease— ‘

ﬁre, ‘remained the Administration objective.

Not Our Vital Interests

On the basis of this record, certain conclusions have be-
come obvious: ’ ’ 4.

1. The real aim of the forces in our country striving for
intervention in Indo-China has nothing whatsoever to do
With defense of the “free world,” but is to seize the riches and
strategic areas of the country. ‘ .

2. In order to disposses the French, and simultaneously

to lull the anti-colonial, anti-imperialist sentiments of the

American people, these forces misrepresented their aim as
one of striving to obtain independence for the peoples of
Indo-China. By this means they sought to by-pass the French
and deal directly with the puppet regimes, which they be-
lieved could be bribed and subordinated to their own control.

8. In order to exploit the country through the puppet

regimes, these forces deem it necessary to arm and strengthen
I them in relation to their peoples, so as to enable them to sup-

press all opposition and resistance to their new masters. Hence

the State Department’s insistence on the training of puppet
~ officers and troops by U.S. military advisers. '

The import of these conclusions is that the “vital” inte-
rests in Indo-China and Southeast Asia for which we are being

I dragged into war are not ours at all--not the American peo-

le’s and not the American nation’s-—but the interests of a
handful of the biggest bankers and corporations. _ _

In the jargon of these money-bags, their stake in proﬁts
has become identical with the “national interest.” Their lust
for raw materials and strategic bases is called “national secur-
ity.” And the methods they use to achieve their aims they label
‘_‘technical assistance,” “anti-colonialism,” “defense of the free
world” against “Communist aggression.”

IV. Our Real National Interest

THE TRUE national interests of our country require really free,

independent states in Indo-China . and Southeast Asia. This

means independence not only from French domination, but
from U.S. domination as well. '

If, after achieving independence, the national states of
Indo-China wishto retain close ties with France, that is their
prerogative, one of the essential prerogatives of -sovereignty.
Indeed, Ho Chi Minh’s delegation at the Geneva Conference
has indicated the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam would
accept such close economic and cultural relations with France,
but he has insisted on the right of the Vietnamese freely to
make this choice. '

Likewise, if these states wish to establish close ties with
our country, that also is their prerogative. And nothing that
the Vietminh has ever said allows the slightest ground for
believing, as the Eisenhower Administration says, that a Viet-
minh victory will result in the “loss” of Indo-China. It would
certainly result-in a loss of a source of super-proﬁts for certain
oligarchs in our country. But as ]o-seph Starobin, the only
American newspaperman ever to visit the Vietminh and inter-
view its leaders, has noted in his recent book (Eyewitness in
Indo-China, Cameron & Kahn, New York, 1954), the Vietminh
leaders and the Vietnamese people, from Ho Chi Minh to the
ordinary peasant and soldier, have respect and warm feelings
for the American people. It is unthinkable that a free, inde-
pendent Viet-Nam would not desire to trade its raw materials

for our industrial products, machine tools, locomotives, and

the like. .

By the same token, if the free, independent states of Indo-
China desire to establish normal, friendly and business-like
relations with the Chinese People’s Republic, the Soviet Union
andthe Peo_ple’s Democracies of Eastern. Europe, that also is

the prerogative of sovereign states. For the Eisenhower Ad- V

ministration to attempt to prevent such relations while talking
about “independence” for Indo-China is the rankest hypocrisy.
Dictation of foreign policy to a nation is irreconcilable with
respect for the independence of that ‘nation. It is, in fact, an
infringement of the nation’s sovereignty. It is a form of inter-
vention in the internal affairs of other countries.

20

 

Truth About Liberated Areas

Dulles, of course, tries to conceal from us this aggressive
aspect of the Administration’s policy. He tries to justify inter-
vention in Indo-China by posing as a savior of the Indo-
Chinese peoples from Ho Ci Mi ’s “police rule” and “slave
state.” This zeal for “saving” peoples who have not sought
“salvation” from us borders on the presumptuous, to say the

-least. But in addition, the allegations of “police rule” and

“slavery” in free Viet-Nam assume that the American people
know nothing of the truth.

The truth is, as Starobin and-others bear witness, that the
achievements of the people under Vietminh leadership, in the
ﬁghting lines and behind them, attest to the freedom of the
Viet-Nam workers, farmers and soldiers. Nothing else could
explain the eight‘-year-long endurance of the French-imposed
war; the fact that industrial output is increasing from 15 to
20 per cent ‘each year; that workers’ real wages are ﬁve times
greater than those in French-administered territory; that an
eight-hour working day is’ in force and child labor is pro-
hibited; that illiteracy has been eliminated and there are now
3,700 primary schools attended by 430,000 children and 206
secondary schools with 80,000 pupils as compared with four
secondary schools, 1,700 opium dens and 120,300 wineshops
under the French administration; that deputies to the Na-
tional Assembly and local government bodies are—for the

 

ﬁrst time—elected on the basis of universal, direct and equal '

suffrage by secret ballot.

But the false pretext given by Dulles and other Administra-
tion spokesmen for the policy of intervention does not simply
apply to Indo-China. ‘It is the basis of the hostility towards
the Chinese People’s Republic. It was the alibi for the ill-fated
and costly “police action” in Korea. It is the justiﬁcation for
our meddling in Italy, Greece, Latin America, the Middle
East, Africa and Europe. What is at issue in the Indo-China
situation is our foreign policy.

21

 

  

A True People’s Foreign Policy 1

Clearly, this foreign policy is daily imposing more hardships
on our families and communities. It is not the vast reservoirs
of surplus capital in the pockets of the Morgans, Rockefellers,
duPonts and the other money kings of our country which the
Administration is using to intervene in other nations. It is the
money in our treasury, money which has largely come from
our pay-envelopes in the form of withholding taxes. We are
having to foot the bill for adventures which are intended to
add more wealth to the wealthy few.

What we give up in the form of withholding taxes is not
all. The funds which might provide us with great housing
projects, public works, higher minimum wages, adequate pen-
sions and disability payments, a national health service, schools,
hospitals and recreation facilities—tl1ese funds are diverted
into ﬁnancing such adventures, and in building a gigantic war
machine in case the adventures misﬁre. Instead of a program
of peacetime jobs to meet the threat of depression, we are

being plunged further into economic crisis by having to pay.

for a program of overseas expansion and war.
This policy threatens not only our livelihood, but our

‘liberties and lives as well. This policy is fully supported by

‘McCarthy and the fascist circles in our country. They see our
involvement in a colonial war or an anti-Chinese and anti-
Soviet war as the opportunity for their seizure of power. They
know how many of our liberties were whittled away during
the Korean war. N o wonder the McCarthy fascists are among
the loudest advocates of intervention in Southeast Asia and
other colonial countries, of continued hostility ‘and eventual
aggression against China. These fascist-minded circles would
not hesitate to use atomic weapons, even the hydrogen bomb,
thus putting our very national existence, along with much of
civilization and the rest of mankind, in peril of extinction.

We Can Change Foreign Policy

The national interest of our country, the interest of world
peace, and the interest of our families and ourselves as indi-

vidual Americans, all require that we put an end to this pres-

ent foreign policy. The opporttmities and possibﬂities for

doing so are yet favorable. The Asian peop1es—China, India,
Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ceylon—have demonstrated their
unwillingness to be drawn into Dulles’ scheme for interven-
tion in Indo—China through “united action.” The European
peoples—British,_ French and otl1ers—have likewise resisted
the Eisenhower Administration’s maneuvers. Hundreds of
millions of people in other countries of Europe, the Middle
East, Asia, Africa and Latin America are ﬁghting to relax
world tensions. The Soviet Union, People’s China and the
People’s Democracies have made overtures for a massive in-
crease in trade with us, for friendly, normal relations with us.

We owe it to our country, ourselves, and our children now
to demand and ﬁght for a new foreign policy, based on respect
for other peoples and the establishment of normal, business-
like relations with all countries. To urge such a new foreign
policy on the President and the Congress, to participate now
in the election campaign with a View to guaranteeing such a
foreign policy, is the highest form of patriotism today.

Let us write letters to the White House, our Congressmen,
state and city ofﬁcials, newspapers, the trade union press,
making known our need and demand for a real American
people’s foreign policy!

Let’s circulate petitions, submit resolutions, hold forums
and lectures and debates, so as to make clear our need and
demand for a foreign policy that serves our national interest!

Let’s enter the election campaign with questions for all
candidates, but a vote for only those candidates who pledge
to resist involvementin Indo—China, to ﬁght against the pro-

gram of “instant, massive retaliation,” and to ﬁght for a for-

eign policyin the interest of our country and our people, rather
than in the interest of a handful of corporation’ owners!

In such a foreign policy that serves the great majority of
the people is the key to our real vital interests.

INDO-CHINA AND WORLD PEACE
‘ By RICHARD WALKER

I. The Threat of Another Korea—or Worse

LESS THAN ﬁve years ago, Indo-China to most people living
in the United States was merely a place on a map. Today,
in the Spring of 1954, we have come close to getting fully
involved in a war in Indo-China, with thousands of Americans
sent to die in its distant jungles. ‘

VVhat is more, this danger is still with us.

Yes, the danger of “another Korea,” so soon after our
three-year-long “police action” in that remote land had cost
us 25,604 killed, 103,492 wounded, 7,955 missing, and up-
wards of 20 billion dollars in treasure. And the danger of
something even worse. '

What almost happened in April, 1954, nine months after‘
the slaughter in Korea had been brought to an agonizing halt,
might not have been restricted to a local “police action.”

For the awful truth is that not only did our Administra-
tion leaders threaten “massive retaliation” against China, .but

- we narrowly escaped their actual employment of atomic

weapons in Indo-China.
’And this is the danger that still confronts us.
“A month ago,” reported columnists ]oseph and Stewart

~ Alsop from Washington in the N. Y. Herald Tribune of May

10, “the American Air Force and Navy joined in offering a
plan that would almost have saved Dienbienphu. . . . Planes

from naval carriers and longer range planes from the Ameri-
can Air Force bases on Okinawa were to join in dropping
hardly more than a hatful of tactical atomic bombs on Dien-
bienphu’s Communist besiegers.”

Something stopped our intervention during April, 1954.,

What was it?

Pierre Mendes-France, a leader of France’s Radical So»-
cialist Party, answered this question in part when he spoke
against the French government’s Indo-China policy in the
National Assembly ]une 9. ' _ A ;

‘United States intervention was to have taken place on
the request of France April 28,” said Mendes-France. “The
warships carrying atomic aviation materiel were loaded and en
route. President Eisenhower was to have asked Congress
April 26 for authorization. Luckily the project for United

‘States intervention was set aside by Britain and by public

opinion in the United States.” . —

Our intervention was swpped “by Britain and by public
opinion in the United States.” And to these. may be added
the French people, the-Asian peoples, and other world forces
of peace.

The French people called the war in Alndo-China “the a

dirty War,” because it befouled the name and honor of France.
For eight, years the French people, together with the Indo-
Chinese peoples, have been the victims of this war. They have
suffered the conscription and death of their youth. They
have ‘endured the crushing burdens’ of taxation and soaring
living costs. They have. been forced to remain in slums
because the costs of the war rendered impossible any program
of housing construct-ion..

Their resistance balked the continuous efforts of the French ,

imperialists and war-minded politicians to “internationalize”
the War, that is, to give pro-war circles in the United States
a free hand in Indo-China. And when Premier Laniel and
Foreign Minister Bidault continued to reject the opportunity
of ending the war at the Geneva Far, Eastern Conference,
the French people on June 12 forced out Laniel and Bidault.

Asian Peoples Said “No!”

The Asian peoples also helped to save us from involve-
ment in Indo-China. They refused to be catspaws of colonial-
ist powers against their fellow-Asians. They spurned the ef-
forts of our State Department to organize a “Southeast Asian
Alliance” against the Indo-Chinese peoples. And the confer-
ence of Asian prime ministers at Colombo demanded, on be-

.half of the governments of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma and
Indonesia, an end to the war and the withdrawal of foreign

troops from Indo-China.

Back of the Churchill Government’s opposition to inter-
vention were not only Tory self-interest in Asia and ties with
Commonwealth cou.nt1'ies opposed to involvement. There was
the strong resistance of a majority of the_ British people to any
development which might lead to a hydrogen-bomb war;
there was the British people’s demand for serious negotia-
tions at Geneva to achieve a peaceable settlement.

In our country, the outpouring of protests against inter-
vention was unprecedented. Thousands of letters descended
on the newspapers, the White House and Congress. Numer-
ous trade union, religious, fraternal and women's organiza-
tions adopted resolutions opposing intervention.

Many of these protests coupled opposition against involve-
ment in Indo-China with demands for control of the hydro-
gen and atomic weapons and for a cessation of hydrogen-
weapon tests in the Pacific. Our countrymen saw the danger
that involvement in Indo-China might spread into a full-scale
Asian war with nuclear weapons, and then into a world war.

So, as Senator Ester Kefauver of Tennessee said on ]une
9, we came “within a hair’s breadth” of intervention in Indo-
China. And we are still standing on the brink of this move
which would mean death or serious injury to tens of thou-
sands of our sons and brothers.

Maneuvers Continue

For Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, in the middle
of June, was still trying to forge his “Southeast Asian Alli-

5

 

 

vention, and to blueprint at Washington plans for military
action with high-ranking . generals of Britain, France, New
Zealand and Australia. Senate Republican leader William F.
Knowland was demanding that negotiations at Geneva be

broken off. There was a desire in some quarters to intervene '

even if the French got out!

And Dulles, Knowland, Vice-President Richard Nixon and
other Administration officials were continuing to employ the‘
threat of “instant, massive retaliation”——the basic program of
Administration war policy. This is the program which in-
creases the danger that any “local war,” any so-called “police
action” at this time might become a world war. It is based
on false “preventive war” and “push-button war” premises,
which assert "that swift hydrogen and atomic blows at the "in-
dustrial centers of a target country will swiftly “win” a war
and leave the attacker virtually unscathed.

The falsity of these premises has been amply set forth by
scientists and military theorists. But their arguments have
failed to convince many inﬂuential political and military lead-
ers in our country.

The American people and the peoples of other countries
stopped the Wall Street-Washington war mob in April. They
can be stopped again. They must be stopped!

II. What’s Indo-China To Us? ‘

Hownm 'rHIs danger arise? How did we become involved in
this Indo-China war, to_the point that the leaders of our gov-
ernment speak about Indo-China and Southeast Asia being
“vital” to thesecurity and well-being of the people of the
United States, without which our very national existence is
put in jeopardy?

For most of us, Indo-China is still a-strange and unknown
land. Those of us who paid attention to this country prior
to the current concern over it had probably done so. during
World War II. At that time, our newspapers and magazines

had frequently published maps and illustrations showing

Indo-China’s relationship to other Asian countries. And we
learned that Indo-China’s liberation from japanese militarism
was one of our war aims in the Far East.

Yet, even during the ﬁghting, few of us really studied the
map. Still fewer concentrated on the little peninsula squatting
in the South China Sea east of Thailand (Siam) and south
of the vast bulk of China. It was a rare American who knew
that the 285,460 square miles of Indo-China are a third larger
than France, twice the size of the British Isles, bigger than
Texas and Massachusetts _combined. Or that its population of
28,000,000 is more than the combined total of New York State
and New England.

The important. fact that a democratically-elected govern- A

ment, headed by Ho- Chi Minh and ruling the State ()f Viet
Nam, has existed in Indo-China since its recognition by France
in 1946 has been known to only a very few of the people of
our country.

Even less known are certain elementary facts about Indo-

' China which now assume importance. For instance, that the
“Indochinese” are not one, but several peoples: the Viet- .

namese, a people closely related to‘ the Chinese and numbering
about three-fourths of the population of Indo-China, who live
in the three coastal provinces of the peninsula called Tonkin,
Annam and Cochin China; the Khmer nation, numbering ap-
proximately three and one-half millions, who live in the state
called Cambodia; the Laotian nation of about 1.2 millions who
live in the state which they call Pathet Lao, but which the
French have named Laos. In addition, Indo-China, consisting
of these three states which the French call the “Associated
States of Indo-China,” is also the homeland of several minor

‘ nationalities, including the Thai peoples in the mountains of .

northern Tonkin, and the Moi in southern Annam. Moreover,
migrants from China and India have established communities
in the country.

President Eisenhower, in his Aug. 4, 1953 speech to the
Conference of State Governors at Seattle, had focused atten-
tion on Indo-China’s importance as a rice-growing area and

7

 

rubber. and manganese.

But not yet has any Administration spokesman tried to

answer why, in view of the fact that greater quantities of
such materials can be obtained peaceably and normally
through lifting the State Department’s restrictions against
trade with China, the U.S. Government feels compelled to
obtain smaller portions from Indo—China at the risk of war.
Nor has any Administration spokesman been able to reply
to the argument that such materials may be obtained from
Indo—China if the peoples of that country are truly inde-
pendent under governments of their own choosing, through

- the normal processes of international trade and exchange.

Besides, 7,000 miles of ocean separate Saigon at the south-
ern tip of the Indo—China peninsula from San Francisco, 11,000
from New York. How could the outcome of a struggle in that
far-off land “sign and seal the death-warrant” of the United
States, as Senator joseph McCarthy had declared in a Mil-
waukee speech on April 24? _

For all these reasons,'the buildup for intervention caught
us oif guard, and we were almost involved in another war.

Now the persistence of the danger of our involvement in
Indo—China and, in consequence, in an Asian and possible
global conﬂict, makes it imperative that we scrutinize the Ad-
ministration’s arguments.

Arguments of Interventionists

The Administration tells us that we are obligated to inter-
vene in Indo—China and Southeast Asia because-
. 1. There is no colonialism in the Indo—China issue at all.
France had announced several times, and most emphatically
last July, that she was ﬁghting to give the three Associated"
States their freedom, their liberty. (President Eisenhower at
his press conference, Feb. 17, 1954.) pp

2. “The free nations cannot afford to permit a further ex-
tension of the power of militant communism in Asia . . . its
(Indo-China’s) loss would be the prelude to the loss of all

8

a land rich in critical raw materials, such as tungsten, tin, »

Frih-inn‘

    

Ct.

  

Southeast Asia and a threat to a far wider area.” (Admiral
Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Ameri-
can Society of Newspaper Editors, April 15, 1954.)

3. The United States as a leader of the free world could
not afford further retreat in Asia . . . if this Covemment could
not avoid it, the Administration must face up to the situation
and dispatch forces. (Vice President Richard Nixon, to the
American Society of Newspaper Editors, April 16, 1954.) .

‘These official pronouncements of Administration leaders
assert that the issue in Indo-China is not one of people ﬁght-
ing for their independence from colonialism, but one of stop-
ping so—called “Communist aggression.” This is the n_ub of the
Administration’s position.

But what is the truth?

The fact of the matter is that those who hold this View
are a distinct minority, not only in the world, but also in our
own country.

Except for the French colonial bureaucracy and a section
of the governing circles in France, and for such self-interested
circles as those around South Korean President Syngrnan
Rhee, the Chiang Kai-shek regime on Formosa, and the

8 French puppet “Emperor” Bao Dai, there is universal belief

that the issue in Indo-China is colonialism.
This is because the record on this point is so clear.

Continuity of Liberation Struggles

Since 1858, when French colonialists ﬁrst invaded Indo-
China, the French have ruled the country with callous dis-
regard of the interests of the peoples. For 80 years the peo-
ples of Indo-China have been struggling against French im-
perialism. Their struggles included many armed revolts and
wars of liberation, such as the Truong Quyen Revolt in South
Viet-Nam and the Po Kum Bo Revolt in Khmer (Cambodia)

‘ in 1863, the Hue Revolt in 1884, the Khmer people’s uprising

in 1885 and 1886, the Saigon outbreak in 1886, the Phan Dinh
Phung Revolt of Viet-Nam in 1893, the war of liberation led
by Hoang Hoa Tham which began in 1903, the Phu Mi Bum
