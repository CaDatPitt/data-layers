in Los Angeles, with both groups

A Mine-Mill strike which has completely closed the Kennecott Copper Corporation’s Western Mining Division
is solid in its third week- as the Union goes to press. '

All attempts by the company to split the workers and to sell them a weak. settlement have failed. And at the
company’s precipitation plant just outside the Bingham Canyon, Utah open pit, Kennecott gave upafter three days
of trying to operate the plant‘ with supervisory personnel during the middle of the month. ‘-

A challenge for open or_ “fishbowl? negotiations, hurled at Kennecott by International President A. C.
Skinner during a press conference in-Salt Lake City on July 15, was rejected by the company, and no further bar-
gaining sessions are‘ scheduled at the present time. .

' Some 10,000 workers, half of them Mine-Mill members, are involved in the strike, which has closed opera-
tions in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. The United Steelworkers of America, representing about 2,300
Kennecott workers in, Utah and Arizona, is also striking the company, as are the International Association of
Machinists and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers. Members of other ' craft unions which

I have small units at the Kenne-
cott properties are respecting

the picket lines.

Press speculation that the
Mine-Mill and Steel strikes

against the company resulted

‘partially from a “game of ‘one-

iupmanship” in the long rivalry

between the two unions was
quickly quashed by the tremen-
dously solidarity of the rank-
and-file members of the unions

“on the picket lines. , .

Joseph Dispenza, president of
Mine-Mill Local 485 in Bingham
Canyon and a member of the

.Kennecott Council’s negotiating

committee, said that this strike

.is the most unified he has ever

seen,‘ and noted that the rank-

Land-file Steelworkers, who

struck first on July 1, were ex-
tremely grateful to be joined by
the Mine-Mill workers.

following day Steel struck the

Garfield smelter in Utah, and
Steel pickets at the Arthur and

Magma mills in Utah and the .
Kennecott property in Ray, Ari-‘

zona were respected by the

Mine-Mill workers, while nego--

tiations between Mine-Mill and
the company continued in Salt
Lake City.

Company Ultimatum

On» July, 6, however, when the
company presented an ultima-
tum that its current proposal be
accepted by the end of the week
or it would be withdrawn, the
Kennecott Council asked for
strike sanction from the inter-
national executive board, which
was given on July 8. A strike
vote in June had carried by a
big majority, and the following

day, on July 9, Kennecott prop-
- erties in four states were down.
Both Mine-Mill and Steel con- ‘
.~ tracts. expired on June 30. The

Eight Mine-Mill locals are in-
volved: the Amalgamated Bay-

Butte Oiiicer Receives Award

For Retarded Children Work

BUTTE, Mont.——Max Salazar, financial secretary of the Butte
Miners’ Union Local 1, was awarded a gold pin on June 3 for
his outstanding work with the Rocky Mountain Association for

Retarded Children.

Elected the first treasurer of the organization, which was
formed several years ago, Salazar has represented the labor

movement on its executive
board for some time. His wife
has also served with the asso-
ciation as vice-president.

Salazar was recently elected

i' to the board of directors of a

committee which will set up
work shopswhere retarded per-
sons will be trained to use sew-
jng machines and other equip-

 ment. His major taskwill be to

contact labor unions throughout
the state, soliciting their sup-
port and financial aid in helping
to p u re h a s e- the necessary
equipment. This work is well
underway, Salazar reports, and
the unions are all willing to co-
operate.

He is also assisting in prep-
arations for a new cerebral

-palsy center, and has been
. asked to participate in a con-

ference of the President’s Com-
mittee on Physical Education
and Research which will be

I held in Washington, .D.C. The
cerebral palsy center will be the-

first one in the state of Mon-
tana.

The Salazars became inter-
ested in the problem of mental
retardation when one of their
twins, Terry, was born blind
because of too much oxygen in
the incubator. This condition is
called RLF (retrolenthal fibro
plasia), and the girl also has
cerebral palsy and is retarded.

Mrs. Frank H. Kelly, presi-
dent of the Rocky Mountain as-
sociation, presented the awards
at the June 3 meeting.

Dr. Arthur E. Westwell, new-
ly appointed executive secretary
of the Montana association, was
the major speaker at the affair.
He outlined the program of the

Governor’s Joint Committee on
Mental Health and Mental Re-
tardation.

from birth and due to some phy-
sical cause. Mental health prob-
lems, on the other hand, can
occur in persons of normal in-
tellectual capacity, and usually
refer to personality problems of
a psychological nature.

NLR Gertiiies M-M Baltimore Local 

BALTIMORE, Md.-—Mine-Mill
Local 625 was certified as the
collective bargaining agent for
some 700 workers at AS&R’s re-
finery here in the middle of
July, when the regional director
of the National Labor Relations
Board dismissed all objections
to the election held on May 20.

On that date, Mine-Mill had
turned back an attempted raid
by the Steelworkers by a vote
of 358 to 311.

Claiming “intimidation” on
the part of Mine-Mill staff
members, Steel asked that the
labor board order a new elec-
tion in Baltimore. Mine-Mill
was also charged with using un-
fair literature. The Baltimore

election had been the closest
one in a series of attempted
raids this year which failed to
make any dent in Mine-Mill’s
bargaining jurisdiction.
Rejected by the workers,

San Manuel

In another jurisdiction dis-

by the National Mediation Board
on July 6 that Steel had with- ’
drawn a petition to represent a
small unit of maintenance of
way employees, working for the 
San Manuel, Ariz., Railroad \ B
Company. a

The railroad workers, repre-
sented by Mine-Mill, were not

THE MINE-MILL UNION

8 3

CARTERET, N. J.—Thomas Chapman, a member
of the Carteret Smelter and Refinery Workers, Local No.
837, is back at his job in the tough pitch (casting) cle-
partment of the U. S. Metals Refining Company’s plant
here as the result of an arbitration award by Dr. George
H. Hildebrand, who also awarded $5300 in back pay in

the case.

, The company had fired Chapman for being absent
from work for more than five days, charging that he had
not notified his foreman of the reason for his absence‘ as

required by the contract.

During the arbitration hearings in April,‘ the union
proved that Chapman had told the company that he was
sick, and, in fact, had received several weekly sickness

and accident insurance checks
during his absence from work
and after having been dis-
charged by U. S. Metals. Since
the company mails out the
checks, it had obviously been
informed by Chapman that he
was sick.

Trosko, and Board Member Al-
fred Petit-Clair handled the ar-
bitration case for the union.

Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, which had not been struck since
1917, threw in the sponge in a hurry this year when some 4,200 Mine-Mill workers

‘ from Trail, Kimberley, Ri-ondel, and H. B. Mine in British Columbia walked off their

jobs at 3 p.m. on Friday, July 17. Union negotiators, after months of stalemated

bargaining, achieved by the following morning a two-year contract settlement valued *

at 40 cents an hour over that period. Included in the agreement were the key de-
mands of the union—-substantial wage hikes and the defined 4-0-hour Monday through

Friday workweek.

The contract, which will expire on June 30, 1966, includes a 10 cents an hour
across-the-board wage hike in the first year, plus 1 cent increment increases from

Grade 3 through Grade 13. Grade 1 will be eliminated,‘ with employees in that clas-.

sification being upped to the second grade.

The defined 40-hour workweek from Monday to Friday was a’ major proposal

of the union throughout the negotiations, which got under way back in January. The

seven workers voted agai; :

Negotiations

   
 
 

with the huge

'. lead-zinc producer had dragged
,' on since Jan. 16.

The initial
company offer was for 5 cents
an hour for each year of a two-
year pact, and was quickly re-
jected by the union’s joint bar-
gaining committee, headedby
Harvey Murphy of Vancouver.
Jack Sherlock, a government
conciliator, ran into stubborn
resistance from the company in

‘ attempting to develop a better

offer.

The union committee, which
also included Canadian Presi-

’_ dent Ken Smith and Board Mem-
_ ber.Al King, recommended re-
jection of the majority report‘

of the Conciliation Board, while
the company went to great

' lengths, including the hiring of

ter to the workers, to urge its

General, incidentally, has opened

Workweek Stressed

The importance of gaining the
defined 40-hour workweek was
emphasized repeatedly "by Mur-
phy, who said that writing such
a clause into the Cominco con-
tracts will pressure the provin-

cial government to enact legis-

lation reducing the workweek
in the entire mining industry
from 44 hours to 40 hours.

The entire union in Canada
supported the determination of
the Cominco employees to
achieve a good settlement.
which will, of course, affect bar-
gaining in the industry through»-
out the country. At a Mine-‘Mill
Western District convention
early in May, delegate after
delegate demanded the floor to
pledge the wholeheated finan-
cial and moral support of his
local to the Cominco workers.

‘ “Never in the history of» our
union," ‘said Murphy, “have the
workers been so: united." ‘

 

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

(Continued from Page 1)

_ which are not yet completed,

will establish a fund for each
worker amounting to one per-
cent of his earnings in the last
12 months plus $25, multiplied
by the number of years of ser-
vice. In case of layoff, the em-
ployee can receive that total
amount in weekly installments
of $25. If-"at the end of 26 weeks,

he has not exhausted his fund,’

he may take the remainder in
a lump sum.

If not needed for periods of
layoff, the fund is turned over
to the worker at retirement.
For example, a man earning
$5,500 a year, ‘who is retiring
after 35 years of service, would
receive a sum of $2,800 ($55
plus $25 equals $80 time-s 35). If
a worker should die, his benefi-
ciary would get the same
amount.

Fund Grows With Salary

Since the formula is always
figured on the basis of the work-
er’s salary for the past 12
months, his supplemental unem-
ployment or retirement fund
increases when he receives wage
increases.

A variety of new health and
welfare and insurance benefits
are included in the new con-
tract, and the employee contri-

bution toward the cost of the"

program is completely elimi-
nated. .
An additional paid holiday
was gained, making a total of
eight. The union also won va-
cation improvements, whereby
the worker will get three weeks’
vacation after 12 years of ser-
vice and an additional day for
each year of service between
20‘ and 25, building up to four
weeks at 25 years. Two weeks
of vacation will begin at two
years of service in some plants,
and at three years in others.

Health and Welfare

The health and welfare gains
include $3,000 of life insurance

paid by the company, an in-

crease to $60 in the weekly sick-
ness and accident benefits, an
increase in major medical cov-
erage for each disability from
$5,000 to $10,000, and major
medical coverage which pays
80 percent of the first $1,000 and
90 percent of the balance.

All terms of the contract are
effective July 1, 1964, except the
additional holiday and improved
vacations which become effec-
tive next Jan. 1..

Several important non-eco-
nomic issues are settled by the
new agreement, including pro-
visions to protect against fore-
men working, a uniform na-
tional checkoff, and an increase
from one to two years in the
length of time for which senior-

 

 

vote showed 630 in favor of strike action if necessary, with 41 opposed. The vote throughout the Unity Council, which

O1-her Councils

The Anaconda Council, be-
cause of the attempted Steel
raid in Great Falls and Butte,
Mont., was late in getting into
negotiations. The Montana-Utah
Joint Bargaining Committee has
meetings with the company
scheduled for this week. While
the full Council has not yet
taken a strike vote, Local 593
in Buffalo, N. Y., employees of
the American Brass Company,
an Anaconda property, voted
531 to 38 in favor. The 93.3 per-
cent total was the heaviest ever
at that plant. Over 100 men
were away on vacation when the
vote was taken on July 15.

And at International Smelting
& Refining’s plant in Tooele,
Utah, an Anaconda subsidiary,
the workers walked off their
jobs one day to conduct a strike
vote, which carried heavily.

Strike votes in all other major
bargaining units also have car-
ried by huge margins. Ninety-
six percent of the workers rep-
resented by the Magma Unity
Council, which is bargaining for
Mine-Mill Locals 937 and 938
and 10 other craft, railroad, and
teamster locals, were in favor
of such action if it becomes nec-
essary to achieve a good settle-
ment. The vote was taken on
July 1.

Last week’s Phelps Dodge
vote produced an extremely
heavy turnout of workers, who
favored strike action if neces-
sary by 94 percent. Local 837
at the American Metals Climax
refinery in Carteret, N. J ., voted
825 to 170 in favor of a strike if
necessary.

DEER LODGE, Mont.—A two-year contract with the Montana‘ A

Phosphate Products Company which provides across-the-board

wage increases of 8 cents in each of the two years was ratified‘ _. ,
this month by 230 underground miners here, members of Deer. V

100 workers at the company’s mine and mill in Douglas, who are
represented by Mine-Mill Local 24 in Philipsburg. .
Effective through June 30, 1966, the agreement provides three
days of funeral leave with pay in the event of a death in the

immediate family of an em-
ployee, a decrease of $6.53 per
month in the employee contri-
bution to the health and welfare
program, and a fourth week of
vacation for workers with 20 or
more years’ service. The work-
ers already got one week for
one year of service, two weeks
for two years’ service, and three
weeks for 15 years’ service.

Additional hospital and med-
ical benefits include ward ac-
commodations for dependents,
$5 per day nursery care for
newborn infants, and intensive
hospital care for both employees
and dependents.

The pension plan will be ex-
tended to June 30, 1966, and

Job Security M aior Issue in K CC Strike

(Continued from Page 1)
has an increase in the shift dif-
ferentials to 8, 12, and 16 cents
per hour and an increase in the
weekly sickness and accident
benefits to $60a week. The com-
pany and union were still far
apart on wages, overall health
and welfare improvements, and
most importantly, job security

* measures.

“Our union would indeed be
derelict in its responsibility,”
Skinner told the radio, televi-
sion, and newspaper reporters
on July 15, “if we were to allow
the present job shrinkage to
continue without writing into the
contract some protection for all
workers who are affected by the
company’s job elimination pro-
gram.” He pointed out that
Kennecott has said that 800 to
1,000 jobs will be eliminated in
Utah during the next two years,
while the production of copper
will be increased by 50 percent.

“While the company views
job security as a cost item in
the contract,” Skinner said,
“our union views it as a moral
issue——a principle for which we
must fight.”

Union Demands

Mine-Mill is asking Kennecott
to agree to a formula to main-
tain the present work force and
minimize loss of jobs and lay-
offs due to automation; contract

,provisions to protect the work-

ers against increased work-
loads, speedup, working short-
handed, foremen working, and
contracting out; and a contract
provision for “retention of rate,”
which would prevent employees
from taking a wage“ cut if

i switched to lower-rated jobs.

.In addition, the union pro-
poses a severance pay plan for
any worker laid off, terminated,
extended vacations
to assist in stabilizing the em-
ployment situation; improve-
ments in health and welfare and
equalization of the program
throughout the Kennecott oper-
ations; and wage hikes of 10

"cents per hour in each of the

three years.

i The strike, -completely order-
lyand peaceful at all properties
for the first five days, became
a real struggle on July 14 at the
precipitation plant near the

?Bingham Canyon open pit.

Breaking an agreement with the
officers of Local 485, Kennecott
on that date attempted to oper-

  
  
  
  
 
   
  
  
  
 
 
    

ﬁf-

ate the plant with some 35 fore-
men. Although, at a meeting on
July 8, the union had agreed to
provide enough men to prevent
deterioration of the plant during
the shutdown and the company
had said it would not try to
operate, Kennecott now charged
that it was “irretrievably losing
property” by not keeping the
plant running.

P. P. Plant Struggle

Kennecott had the foremen
bussed to.the plant gates, but
some 200 pickets were on the
scene and, milling around the
busses, prevented the “scabs”
from getting off.

Saying that police protection
was necessary to prevent vio-
lence, the company called on
the Salt Lake County sheriff’s
department. For the next three
days, from July 14 to 16, close
tov100 deputies and over 200
pickets, including women and
children, were at the precipita-
tion plant whenever the busses

‘were due to arrive.

With the help of the deputies,
who formed lines to keep back
the pickets, the foremen were
sometimes successful in enter-
ing the plant. At other times,
the busses continued on to the
canyon, allowing the supervisors
to get to the plant from the rear
on speeders (small self-pro-
pelled railroad cars) —— a ma-
neuver which cost them over an
hour.

Local 485 leaders worked hard
to prevent violence during the
three days, and no one incurred
any serious injuries. Some scuf-
fles with police_ did occur, the
most serious of which was on

July 15, when police formed a

“flying wedge” to break through
the pickets and get the foremen
into theyplant.

The picket lines, on which
members of Locals 485.and 392
were joined by -members of the
IAM, BLF&E, and several other
unions, were successful in pre-
venting entry to the plant only
on the first day, and, later
changed their tactics—heckling
unmercifully the foremen as
they worked in the yard. The
pickets continued to set up lines
through which the supervisors
had to make their way to gain
access. Union leaders talked to
the foremen over a loudspeaker,
pointing out to them that the
company’s insistence on their
going through this experience

indicated a low regard by Ken-
necott for its foremen.

Company Yields

On Friday, July 17, the com-
pany announced that it was dis-
continuing its attempt to keep
the plant in operation. On Mon-
day, July 20, Judge Ray Van
Cott Jr. of the Third District
Court issued an injunction
against the union to‘ prevent
mass picketing.

Several pickets were detained
by sheriff’s deputies during the
three-day melee, but all were
released without charge except
Dispenza, Robert Peterson, Juan
F. Martinez, Rex Obray, and
Kenneth Borg. They were

charged with picketing to inter-
fere with access and released
under $100 peace bonds.

In other developments in the
Kennecott strike, the company
was forced to call off a meet-
ing at the Salt Lake City fair

grounds, at which it purportedly
was to-explain its contract pro-

pany, however, would not have
allowed an open question and

meeting, and it would have been

volved in the situation for well
over a month. '

‘And it was on the shaky basis
of the mediators being involved
that Kennecott evaded Mine-Mill
challenge to “fishbowl” negotia-
tions, which would be open to
the public and the press. J. C.
Kinnear, general manager of
Kennecott’s Western Division,
replied to a telegram from Skin-
ner by implying that only the
conciliators could reopen nego-
tiations. The company stood
ready to meet any time, any-

where Kinnear said—anywhere, -

apparently, except in the open.

Propaganda Campaign-

During the first days of the
strike, Kennecott opened its
usual barrage of propaganda——
“Dear John” letters to the work.-
ers, ads in the newspapers,
press releases attacking the
union. At his press conference,
Skinner said that the union had
been reluctant to answer the
“false and twisted charges” be-
cause Mine-Mill was interested
in negotiating a good contract.
The union, he said, was not in-
terested in getting into a pub-
licity battle with the company,
which would further widen the
differences between the parties.

“Let’s forget the
Avenue publicity stunts,” he
asked, “and get down to some
honest old—fashioned bargain-
ing.” '

As the Union goes to press,
the strike is solid and quiet on
all fronts.

Goldwater Nod No llolkc

ANY OF THE RECENT remarks about the Goldwater can-

didacy are indeed funny:

“The Senator has announced that he’ll wage a vigorous
campaign, touring all 13 of the states.”

“Goldwater—the fascist gun in the West.”

“Senator Goldwater will make a major address this eve-
ning, to be carried on radio from 8:30 to 7:30.”

We’ve seen printed cards yet with this message: “Hey buddy,
some nut’ put a Goldwater bumper sticker on your car!”

But, in spite of the recent public opinion polls which show
President Johnson leading the Arizona Senator by huge margins,
Goldwater’s candidacy is no joke and should not be treated as
such. Barry is right when he says that the pollsters have been
having a horrible year.

‘I: it *

OLDWATER’S nomination is a tragedy for the nation and

for the Republican party because it puts many right-wing
extremists in positions of power and gives them a platform from
which they can poison the political atmosphere in the United
States for years to come. And it is possible that these people
may eventually destroy the GOP—a prospect that gives us no joy,
although certainly a realignment of political forces in the United
States is long overdue. -

But it would be wrong, we feel, to interpret the Goldwater
nomination as simply a well-organized coup by the right wing,
for it could not have been carried off by the Birchers alone. The
immediate danger is the possibility of a Goldwater victory in
November. _ 1 —

His emotional campaign oratory is a mass of subtle and
not-so-subtle contradictions.
all bad. Goldwater voted against cloture and the civil rights bill,

~ against the nuclear test ban, against medical care for the aged

(/5

in any form.

He has supported anti-labor legislation and has proposed a
federal “right-to-work” law which would cover all states except
those which held special elections and approved the ‘union shop.

He has attracted to his banners all of the fanatics who are
anti-labor,- anti-Negro, anti-intellectural, anti-peace. But these
groups alone could not have given him the nomination, much less
the presidency. ‘ ‘ - i

* ‘k ‘k

Q '1‘ BOTTOM, his chances rest_ on the uneasiness that many of

us feel about the trends in our national life, or, as N. Y.
Times columnist James Reston puts it, “. . . regret over the loss
of'America’s innocent and idealistic youth.” Goldwater, it is said,
is a “politician who is not a politician,” and thatis his real charm
to the responsible people who support him.

' His appeal, to the worst in many, is to the best in some. For
he is an idealist, who is not afraid to take what seems to be
unpopular positions. ~

The Democratic party will make a profound mistake if it
attempts to beat Goldwater solely on the “extremism” issue.
Most if his ideals are wrong and his simple solutions are unwork-
able and, yes, dangerous in the 20th century, but they will not
be dismissed with a label.

For America is confronted with many problems, and its
citizens are lookingfor real, not political, solutions.

Exhausted with cynicism, they are ready to support a new
idealism. A willingness by Democrats to skip these considerations
in favor of “politics as usual” at their national convention in
Atlantic City in August, could spell trouble for them in the crucial
few months ahead.

Not at Time to Relax

N THURSDAY EVENING, July 2, President Johnson signed

» into law the strongest civil rights bill ever passed by the U. S.
Congress. A
Although somewhat waterul down in the Senate, the bill cleared

that traditional graveyard of civil rights proposals on June 19, by

a vote of 73 to 27.

The law gives broad new powers to the federal government to
help end discrimination in employment, public accommodations,
education, and voter registration. The bill was effectively pushed
-this year by civil rights groups, labor organizations, churches, and

_many other organizations. The greatest credit must go to those
‘who were willing to take their protests peacefully to the streets.

The beautifully-organized march on Washington a year ago was
a magnificent demonstration of the huge numbers of Americans
who finally agreed—“Jim Crow Must Go.”

‘A’ ‘k fr
0 ONE should forget, however, that the Supreme Court deci-

sion calling for integrated public schools became “the law
of the land” in 1954. Look at the situation today——10 long years
later——not only in the South, but in Northern cities where de facto
school segregation exists because of the pattern of housing ghettos.
The bill is a milestone, but it must be enforced. The govern-
ment must provide the funds and the personnel who will make the
most effective use of this new tool. Maximum pressure to this end
should be continued on the Administration, the Department of
Justice, and other government agencies.
The fight to end discrimination has many by—products. Not

“ifohly racist, but conservative control of ‘key Congressional‘ com=»*

mittees will be ended when the bulk of the Negroes_ in the South
become registered. State “right-to-work” laws will be repealed in
Southern states when the bars to the ballot box are removed.

The new law outlaws literacy tests and makes a sixth grade
education sufficient to qualify to vote in federal elections.‘ Other
additional protections against discrimination in voter registration
are provided.

The section of the law outlawing discrimination in employment

will bring about an increased awareness that additional employ-.

ment opportunities are needed, if we are to build a society in
which equality of job opportunities exists. Significantly, the 200,000
who marched on Washington called for jobs and freedom.

Passage of the bill does not bring a time for relaxation. On
the contrary,- now is the time to. push vigorously ahead to make
equality of all Americans a living

His record in the Senate is almost"

reality. At long last, we have ~
I the law on our -side in all 50 states of the Union. A

In Chile Settled;

Chilean copper workers struck
Kennecott’s Braden mine and
smelter on July 9, and were out
for over two weeks before set-
tlement of strike issues was
reached. The walkout grew out
of dissatisfaction over contract
terms for 53 drillers.

Although the 15-month labor
contract between Braden and

Confederation does not expire
until Oct. 2, 7,000 employees at
the mine, mill, and smelter
struck, -demanding that the com-
pany pay up amounts owing to
the workers from profits earned
in 1961. Negotiations on wages
and working conditions will ‘be
opened shortly. _
Braden officials took an un-
compromising attitude in the
early days of the strike. One
was quoted by the Associated

Press as saying, “We may have

Conrad in The Los Angeles Times to sit it out, until the workers

easifh Dept. Continues
To Check National Lead.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. -— National Lead Company’s secondary‘

lead -smelter here reopened on June 29, following a one-week shut-_
down ordered by the Indiana State Board of Health and a two-week
vacation shutdown. The plant, still very much on probation and
under close check by the health authorities, was ordered closed
late in May because of a high incidence of lead poisoning among

its employees.

Clayton Associates of Detroit, Mich., was hired by the com-
pany to put the plant in proper condition. During the shutdovm,
considerable cleanup work was done and work was started on

the installation of new ventilat-
ing equipment.

All but four of 27 workers who
had been found to have blood
levels of lead far ‘higher than
what is considered safe were al-
lowed to return to work on June
29. Three of those four, who still
had excessive lead concentra-
tions in their blood at the end

of June, subsequently improved A

and returned to work. However,
three other employees were or-
dered off the job by the health
authorities.

More Tests Set

Still dissatisfied with the con-
centrations among employees at
the plant, the health department
has scheduled further air sam-
pling analyses and blood checks
on all workers on July 29, in an
attempt to gauge the effective-
ness of the ventilating. equip-

ment and other safety equip-
ment and practices ordered by
the department and the Indiana
Commissioner of Labor.

All workers have been wear-
ing respirators continually while
on the job, and are being pro-
vided with changes of work
clothes by the company. Work
clothes are changed daily—and
oftener where required—-and are
laundered by the company.

The plant employs some 45

workers, members of Mine-Mill V

Local 632.

In perhaps the first situation .

in this country where a state
government ordered a p 1 a n t
completely closed for health rea-
sons, the employees voted unani-
mously to cooperate in the pro-
gram and to support the orders
of-the health department. ..

DENVER, Colo.—i-The Mine-Mill executive board has called on President Johnson and the U. S.

BUTTE, Mont.—Nearly 6,000 residents of Butte and the surrounding area showed

city’s oldest holiday except for the Fourth of July.‘

The miners, whose union was founded in 1878, a year before Butte became a
chartered city, marked their 86th anniversary by giving away hundreds of gallons
of ice cream and cotton candy to the children, as well as free rides on the roller
coaster, giant biplane swing, and merry—go-round.

Congressman Arnold Olsen, who is this year seeking his third term from Mon-
tana’s 1st District, spoke briefly during the intermsision of a free dance at the pa-

vilion Saturday evening. A for-
mer member of Mine-Mill Lo-
cal‘No. 1,.he congratulated
labor for always having been

in:-the forefront of the war

against poverty, and said that

.“a better, distribution of wel-

fare and the fruits of industry”
was needed in this country.

- The traditional holiday got
underway in the morning with
20 teams of workers participat-

ing in a first aid contest spon-
sored by the Anaconda Com-.

pany. The Kelley Miners, scor-
ing 1,494 points of a possible

Recent court Decisions Support
 nights, Political Freedom

by Nathan Witt
General Counsel. .
(Editor’s Note: Some recent court decisions, while not directly
affecting either of the Mine-Mill cases, are of general civil liberties
interest. We asked our general counsel to comment on them.)
W0 important recent court decisions, one by the Unitedstates

 

Supreme Court and the other by a federal appellate court, re-

affirm basic principles of the Bill of Rights.

The Supreme Court case involved the constitutionality of the
passport provision of the McCarran Act of 1950. The decision,
which leaves the registration provisions of the McCarran Act or

Subversive Activities Control ‘Act of 1950 in quite a mixed up state,

certainly further weakens those provisions. The Supreme Court
decision, handed down on June 22, prompted The Washington Post
to editorialize that “The Subversive Activities Control Act of,1950
is now nothing but an embarrassment.” _ ' -

Passport Section Dead

The Court struck down the provision of the 1950 Act making
it criminal for any member of an organization which has been
ordered by the Subversive Activities Control Board to register un-
der the Act to use o-r to even apply for ’a passport. ‘Although in
1961, the Court upheld the registration provisions against the Com-
munist party, it now says that the passport’ provision is unconsti-
tutional even as applied to leaders of the party. Such a flat, pro-
hibition against travel, without a hearing, thejCourt’said, is a viola-
tion of liberty under the due‘ process clause of the 5th Amendment.

The decision does not mean that Congressfhas-no" power to regu-
late‘ the issuance and use of passports. However, it doesmean that
an individual must be given a hearing before being denied a -pass;
port and, further, that the passport may be deniedinr a particular

. case only on reasonable grounds. Being a Communist is no longer

sufficient reason in itself to deny a man the right to travel. On
the other hand, a man may be denied a passport if he is going
abroad to hurt the United States in some way, whether or not he is
a Communist.

* ‘k 1*

N 1961, the Supreme Court, as I have said, held that the Com.-
-munist party could constitutionally be ordered to register. At

that time, however, the Court refused to rule on the argument that‘
the registration provisions ‘violate the pri- ‘

vilege against self,-incrimination. It said
that question would have to await a crim-
inal case against the party and its leaders.

Well," the p_arty and its leaders were
convicted for refusing to register, but last

ington reversed the conviction, saying that
the law does violate the constitutional pro-
vision against self-incrimination. Earlier
this year, the Supreme Court refused to re-
view the case when petitioned by the government to do so, mak-
ing the decision of the Court of vAppe,als_the final word on the
subject. I .

Witt

Current Situation . ' A
At the present time, then, we have this situation: (1) The’SA,CB

j has the power to order the party to register, but (2) ‘no punishment

may be imposed upon, the party. for refusing to register, and (3)
no person can be denied a passport simply because he is a mem-
ber of an organization which has been ordered to register. ,
Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote the majority opinion in the re-
cent passport case. Justice Hugo ‘Black, in a concurring opinion,
reiterates what he said in 1961, when he dissented in the registra-
tion case—that the registration provisionsas a whole are unconsti-
tutional because they amount to a bill of attainder which violates
free speech, press, and association guaranteed under the 1st
Amendment and the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.

‘Ir ‘K at . ~
NCIDENTALLY, I again want to point out that the McCarran

Act of 1950 is quite different from the Communist Control Act
of 1954. Only the 1950 Act contains registration provisions which
apply to “Communist-action” and “Communist—front” organiza-
tions. (The Communist party itself is the only “Communist-action”
organization.) Other provisions of the 1950 statute apply to mem-
bers of such organizations, such as the passport provision.

Under the 1954 Act, on the other hand, which applies to so-
called "Communist-infiltrated” organizations, registration is not
required. Members are in no way affected even if the organization
is ultimately found to be "Communist-infiltrated.”

The only two cases involving “Communist-front” organizations
are scheduled for argument and decision by the Supreme Court
after it convenes again in October. The only case under the 1954
Act is, of course, the Mine-Mill case. The case was argued in the
Federal Court of Appeals in Washington in January, and we are
awaiting its decision. .

at it it

HE other recent decision, this one from the Court of Appeals

in San Francisco, said that the section of the Landrum-Griffin
Act which forbids Communists (and those who have been Commu-
nists within the past five years) to be union officers is unconsti-
tutional, violating both the 1st Amendment (free speech, etc.) and
the due process clause of the 5tl1 Amendment.

Trend of Courts

Although none of these decisions have a direct bearing on our
own SACB case, it is true that they, and some other decisions in
recent years, indicate that the federal courts are more and more
rejecting legislation which rests on the philosophy of Mccarranism
and McCarthyism. This is especially true of the Supreme Court. V _

At bottom, the SACB case against Mine-Mill rests solely on
that philosophy--that men and organizations may be penalized not

Arbitratsii

 ‘BINGHAM CANYON, Utah-——About 20 members
of Mine-Mill Local 485 who work at the Yosemite truck

shop will ‘receive several hundred dollars apiece in back

pay as the result of an arbitration award handed down

Angeles, Calif.
Aaron ruled that the

Kennecott Copper Corpora-

tion was Violating an agreement with the union by re-

fusing to pay the men for travel
time. In addition to the back
pay, the workers in the future
will receive travel time of 25
minutes per day at time and a
half. '-

The decision is extremely im-
portant in view of the com-
pany’s expansion program in
Utah and the transition from
rail to truck haulage in its min-
ing operations. A work force
much larger than the present
one at the truck shop may
eventually benefit from the arbi-
tration award. .

The International Association
of Machinists, which represents
some 200 workers at Bingham

Canyon, had previously lost an‘

arbitration case on exactly the
same question. Arbitrator Rob-
inson ruled for the company in
the Machinists’ case, a decision

‘which cost their workers close

to a_,t‘otal of $12,900 a month.

yczompanyi Uses Decision
The Machinists’ d e c i s i o n,

handed down on March 12, was »

introduced by the company at
the hearing on‘ the Mine-Mill
arbitration, which was held on
that same day. Arbitrator Aaron,
however,-ruled that the award
in’ that case was “not a reliable
guide” because it had been
agreed then that “the arbitrator
shall not be bound by the lan-
guage in the supplemental agree-
ment.” »

It was on the basis of specific
language in the supplemental
agreement of Dec. 10, 1952 be-
tween Mine-Mill and Kennecott
concerning travel time that
Arbitrator Aaron made his de-
cision.

‘The agreement provides travel
pay for employees who have to
travel on company property to
get to where their shift begins,
but also makes certain excep-
tions to this rule. The company
maintained that‘: the Yosemite

July-August. ‘I964

THE MINE-MILL" UNION"

Freedom Democratic Party
Challenges Eastland and Co.

A swift undercurrent of fundamental political change is running through this
country in 1964.-, the year in which Congress enacted the ‘strongest civil rights bill in
its history. And, more than any other issue, it has been civil rights that has

sharpened and focused‘ today’s political’ battles.
The nation watched a revolution occur at t

he Cow Palace in San Francisco, as

the Goldwater conservatives, in an amazing display of strength, wrenched control of
the Republican party from the moderates who had been in the saddle for so long.

It did not take the CORE pickets outside to tell the television viewers where the
Republicans now stand on civilrights. The delegates themselves did that, parading,
for all to see, their reluctance to even pay lip. service to the newly enacted bill.

But, although their presidential candidate is already ch osen, Democrats, too,
A must answer some fundamental political questions at their national conclave late in

Augustin Atlantic City, N. J.
Their decisions could affect the
political alignments in the
United States as drastically as
does the ultra conservative take-
over of the GOP. Again, the
question hinges on civil rights.

There will be a move at At-
lantic City, already supported
by nine states, to unseat the
traditional Democratic party
delegates from Mississippi.
Since Mississippi has frequently
walked out of the convention in
the past, this in itself would be
of, little significance. But this
year, something new has been
added — something called the
Mississippi Freedom Democratic
party. Claiming to be more
nearly representative of the peo-
ple of Mississippi,’ it will ask to
be ~_seated at the convention in
place of the regular party dele-
gates. .

Whatis the Mississippi Free-
dom Democratic party? It is an
organization sponsored by civil
rights groups, which pledges

loyalty to national Democratic

party policies. Its members,
most of whom have been denied

A the right to register to vote, ful-

5:9

 

‘u

fill the registration require-
ments of Northern states, i.e.,
are over 21 and a legal resident
of the state. Freedom registrars
in eachcounty have signed up
applicants, the majority of
whom are Negroes.

The party, structurally similar
to the traditional party, has
held, precinct caucuses and
county conventions, and will
hold a state convention on the

same day as does the regular
Democratic . party. The delega-
tion it sends to the national con-
vention will have been elected,
in other words, with grass roots
support.

Possible Effect

Not only could the seating of
this alternate delegation hurt
the traditional party symboli-
cally, but it might also have
some concrete effect on the po-
lice state grasp with which the
party holds Mississippi. Federal
patronage might be withheld

from Eastland and companyl

and key. Congressional chair-
manships could possibly be lost.
In any event, an official basis
for a genuine two-party system
in the state would be laid.
President Johnson, of course,
faces a dilemma. As a Southern
president, he might expect to

carry most .of the South despite,

the fact that ideologically the
region is probably closer to
Goldwater. A strong effort on
the President’s part to seat the
MFDP would undoubtedly cost
him electoral votes from the
South. He may decide to stay
out of the fight, and let the chips
fall where they may.

The challenge to the regular
party is based primarily on two
things: its systematic discrim-
ination in allowing people to
vote and its demonstrated dis-
loyalty to national Democratic
candidates and program.

Regular Party Platform

For example, the 1960 plat-
form of the Mississippi Demo-
cratic party says:

“We are opposed to the enact-
ment by the Congress of the
U. S. of the so-called anti-poll
tax measure . . .”

“We believe that every person
shall have the right to work and
no person shall be denied that
right because he or she is not a
member of a union or other
labor organization . . .”

“We believe in the separation

of the races and are unalterably

opposed to the repeal or modi-
fication of the segregation laws
of this state. . .'.We unalterably
oppose any and all_ efforts to
repeal the miscegenation laws.’’

“We reject and oppose the plat-
forms of both national parties
and their candidates.”

Democratic delegates from
Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin,

Michigan, and the District of

Columbia are strongly com-
mitted to the seating of the
MFDP at this year’s conven-
tion. In addition, the group has
varying degrees of support from
New York, California, Massa-
chusetts, and Colorado, all of
which are committed to attempt-
ing to unseat the traditional
party delegation.

Floor Fight Probable

The fight, which will begin in
the credentials committee, will
almost certainly continue on the
floor of the convention. It takes
eight states to get a minority
report from the committee, and
11 to force a roll call vote on
the floor. V

meier of Wisconsin may man-

dom Democratic party.
In last year’s gubernatorial

race, Aaron Henry, candidate of
the newly-organized Freedom
party, polled 83,000 votes at

freedom election booths set up
around the state. Arch segre-
gationist Paul Johnson, who was
elected, received some 250,000
votes.

Freedom party officials, how-
ever, have well over 100,000 per-
sons now registered and expect
their most effective registration
work to be done in the next
month. They feel they can
achieve a total of over 300,000
registrations before the Atlantic
City convention opens. Only
about 20,000 of an estimated

450,000 Negroes over 21. inthe

held by John Stennis, has toured
the whole state campaigning.
The party also has three other
people running for Congress.

Freedom Democratic party of-
ficials say that the most effec-
tive work that can be done for
their group from outside the

urging people to indicate sup-

 Clark Report on 

WASHINGTON, D. C.—
The “Clark Report”—- a
United States Senate com-
mittee’s proposal for na-
tional economic planning in
the United States -— that
also points up the growing
problem of unemployment,
is being recognized nation-
ally as one of the most sig-
nificant public documents

.of recent times.

Titled “Toward Full Em.-
ployment,” the report was
submitted by the Subcom-
mittee on Labor and Pub-
lic Welfare.

Chairman of the sub-

committee is Senator Jo-.

seph S. Clark, (D-Pa.). The
report is subtitled: “Pro-
posals for a Comprehensive
Employment and Man-
power Policy in the United
States.”

Clark’s major point is
that there is a “manpower
revolution” taking place in
America-—technology is re-
shaping our lives, our econ-
omy and the labor force.
Machines and computers
and other rationalized sys-
tems are taking over un-
skilled and semi-skilled
jobs, and the impact is also
being felt even more in of-
fices, in other white collar
work —— and increasingly
even in the destruction" of
skilled jobs, and the down-
grading of many skilled
workers.

War on Poverty

Clark’s report indicates
that if the committee’s find-
ings are seriously consid-

ered and put into practice

there could be effective‘

action in the war on pov-
crty.

Otherwise, if the govern-
ment does not lead with
some economic planning,
including the creation of
many more jobs, then the
nation is in for increasing
unemployment, w h i c h
means more squalor, more
slums, more delinquency,

and more cruel discrimina-

tion against minority
groups; and against all
young people who are now
the chief victims" of the
jobless crisis.

The report clearly im-
plies that over-all national
planning for national eco-
nomic goals is desirable
and necessary.

Among the goals is re-
activating the Employment
Act of 1946.

In other words, the com-
mittee appears to be say-
ing any administration
that is ready to place hu-
man rights above property
and profit rights has all
the legal machinery it

needs to go full steam’

ahead. , ,

In his vigorous Weekly,
editor I. F. Stone com-
ments: “Poverty represents
an untapped market...un-
employed hands are poten-
tial wealth. The Federal

government ought to do ,

more than set‘ general
goals. There is no reason
why it cannot inventory
specific needs for specific
industries. If we knew how

Company's Bonanza, Utah, gilsonite mine, cuts shaft sink-
ing time. To meet safety regulations, the company puts
down escapeways every 1,000 to 1,500 feet. This shaft
borer puts down a 62-inch diameter bore——large enough
to hold a four-man cage-—‘to 900 feet in two to three weeks

- time. Three such bores, closely spaced, serve as a three

compartment production shaft. Previously, completion‘ of

many pairs of shoes, how
much plumbing, how much
lumber, and how much
clothing would be needed
to raise the miserable mil-
lions on the fringe of our
society to decent living
standards, we would see
the market and the jobs
the war on poverty could
open.”

Goal on Unemployment
The report set a goal of
reducing unemployment to
three percent by January
1, 1968.
Attainment of only three
percent unemployment, un-

der the most optimistic cir-

cumstances, and assuming
that private enterprise co-
operates fully, and that
there is no serious increase
in the rate of mechaniza-
tion, would still demand an
increase in government ex-
penditure of $5 billion!

It has been noted that
unemployment in the last
half century has fallen be-
low three percent only dur-
ing periods of war, or war-
created demands (1918-19,
1943-45, V 1951-53.)

The report also states
that a $10 billion reduction
in defense spending is esti-
mated shortly. To deal
with this “crisis of peace,”
the report proposes planned
conversion of military to
peace-time spending.

In a most significant pas-
sage the report suggests
that perhaps private indus-
try which profits most
from technological ad-
vances should pay a just
share for easing the unem-
ployment situation‘:

“The increase in output
per man-hour currently
adds nearly $20 billion an-
nually to the gross national
product. Many have main-
tained that the benefits of

 productivity should. be

spread broadly through
lower ‘prices, but the tend-
ency has been for the ma-
jor benefits to accrue to
profits and the wages of
those who remain em-
ployed.

“A consensus is growing
that the human costs of
technological displacement
should be charged against
those who benefit from it
by applying some of the
gains from increased prod-
uctivity to measures for
easing the adjustment
process.”

Appolling Facts

The report’s major ser-
vice to the nation has been
its clear outlining of the
apppalling facts about un-
employment and the econo-
my. Here we learn what
the “manpower revolution”
really means.

For example, between
1957 and 1963, “despite sub-
stantial increases in output
and creation of new prod-

. __ ucts ,and industries,” total
‘employment of blue-collar

workers has declined by
900,000. Construction, for
example, went up by 17
percent since 1956, but
there has been no increase
in construction employ-
ment. Including farm work-
ers, the report says, “the
goods-producing sector has
experienced a net loss of
more than 3 million jobs»
over the last six years.”

While the Clark report

‘does not present detailed

figures on mining, smelt-
ing, refining and fabricat-
ing of nonferrous metals,
we know the overall trends
it discusses have cut heavi-
ly into jobs in these indus-
tries.
Mining Industries

For example, U.S. mines
in 1963 produced 35 per-
cent more metals, coal and
other minerals than in
1947. But the number of
miners on the job fell from
870,000 in 1947 to a little
over 500,000 in 1963.

In copper mining and
milling, with production up,
5,000 jobs have disap-
peared since 1956.

In lead-zinc’ mining and
milling, nearly 7,000 jobs
have disappeared since
1956. ‘

In non-ferrous smelting
and refining, 1,200 jobs
have disappeared since
1958.

In the brass mills, prod-
uction since 1958 has in-
creased 33 percent with no
increase in jobs.

-We are told the unem-
ployment rate is steady at
about 51/2 percent. We
know the true rate is closer
to 9 percent. And merely
to keep the figures as they
now stand, to keep unem-
ployment from jumping
any higher, will take 3%
million new jobs every
year! '

To reduce the unemploy-
ment goal to the three per-
cent that Clark envisages
by 1968 will mean the cre-
ation of between 6 and 8
million new jobs every
year!

While the AFL-CIO has
called for $2 billion a year
expenditure. in public
works, the  Clark Report
says nothing less than $5
billion a year, every year,

‘until 41968 will serve to re-

duce unemployment to
three percent.

What are some of the ex-
penditures government
could make to reduce un-
employment, while enrich-
ing our society‘?

Housing. Schools

tions many: ,

the reconstruction of the 0 s

Pressure on
topper Price

Reports persist in the Wall
Street Journal and American
Metal Market that the Chilean
government is maintaining pres-
sure on the Anaconda and Ken-
necott companies to raise the
price of copper produced in
Chile by two to three cents a

pound. Such a move would.in-
evitably be followed by an in-
crease in U. S. producers’
posted copper price and touch
off an upward surge in copper
company profits.

Reﬂecting industry opinion,
the Wall Street Journal said on
July 20, “Some copper trade
authorities in the U. S. assert a
price rise at present would be
inopportune and could be harm-
ful.” Why? Because, said the
Journal, U. S. producers are -
engaged at this time in collec-
tive bargaining anda price} rise
now would put pressure on the
companies to grant union de-
mands. - ‘O * M

The same newspaper on July
27 reported growing talk in in-
dustry circles "that the price of
copper will be raised‘ before the
end of 1964. Unless the. com-
panies’ hands are forced by
-Chilean pressure, any. increase
in price will come after new
labor-management contracts are
signed in the U. S.

Politics Involved

The Chilean presidential elec-
tions scheduled for September
4 are a factor in the govern-
ment’s demands on Anaconda
and Kennecott. The principal
contenders for the" presidency,
Salvador Allende, candidate of
a coalition of socialistic and
progressive parties, and Eduardo
Frei of the Christian Demo-
cratic party which favors a
broad program of social reform,
both advocate strong measures
with respect to the U. S. copper
companies in Chile.

Allende has pledged nation-
alization of the mines, while
Frei has proposed tighter regu-
lation of profits and measures
to increase the amount of cop- 4
per refined and fabricated in
Chile. Allende claims the U. S.
companies, in 50 years of opera-
tion in Chile, have taken $31/2
billion in copper out of the
country, on an original invest-
ment of $31/2 million.

The mine safety bill ofthe Johnson Administration, drafted last year and submitted in January

: calf-Montoya safety bill for mines, mills, smelters, and refineries.

Congress wants_ to study bothtproposals at the same time.
On May 6, ,Interior’Secretary Stewart Udall wrote that his department had been “making every

V ,.,«to the Bureau of the Budget for review,‘ is still pigeonholed there after six months. Failure of the bill
’ to clear the Bureau" to date has also stalled Congressional hearings on the Mine-Mill-backed Met-

- effort to expedite clearance”. of the administration bill, adding that “We are hopeful that clearance

will be obtained shortly and-we will forward our proposed bill . . . to the appropriate committee of

the Congress as rapidly as pos-

In view of the lateness of the
current session of Congress and
the fact that'most Congressmen

launch their campaigns for re-

J pears that hearings on the safe-
ty’ bills will most likely be put

, off until next year.

Uranium Miner Files
Claim in Utah

claim for disabling lung cancer
‘due to contact with radioactive
gas in uranium mining has been
filed with the State Industrial

—~v-'~~—— Commission of Utah. Matthew

P. Rowe, employed in a urani-
um mine near Blanding in San
Juan County, Utah from March
to December, 1963, filed the
claim.

If the claim is approved, Rowe
could receive up to~$1,925 in hos-
pital coverage, and $15,800 in
compensation if declared per-
manently and totally disabled.
Earlier, as reported in this col-
um in the May-June issue, a ur-

Climax Explosion

An explosion and fire at ‘the
big American Metal Climax
molybdenum mine at’ Climax,
Colorado, July 8_ claimed the life
of miner Steve Videvich, 40, of
_Leadvil1e. The mine was closed
after the fire, which is said to
have started in a fan house on
the surface. Cause of the under-
_ ground explosion is being sought
by federal’ and state investiga-

tors. _ .. .
A major tragedy could have
resulted from the blast, but 300
miners who were underground

. at the time succeeded in escap-

ing. Three miners suffered
smoke inhalation and another
suffered a broken arm and pos-
sibly other injuries.

About one million pounds of
molybdenum production wa s
lost due to shutdown of the
mine, according to company of-
ficials. The mine was reopened
five days after the blast and
normal production levels were
regained after an additional
two days. ~ -

Silicosis in Montana

29 cases of silicosis were re- _ ’

ported by Montana employees
from July, 1960 to June, 1963_—
the first three full years of op-
eration of the Montana Occupa-
tional Disease Act. These‘ re-
ported cases represent only a

harmful quantities of "silicon
dioxide dust for .at least 1,000

eight years preceding disable-A

‘ ment, must be totally disabled‘,
‘ and must meet other "require-
ments. V
On the average, close to 700
disabled silicotics unable ‘to
meet the requirements of the
occupational disease law were
receiving monthly‘ benefits un-
der the state silicosis benefit
fund. The fund, formerly ad-
ministered by the State Welfare
Department, is now adminis-
tered by the State Industrial Ac-
_ cident Board. No data is avail-
able to indicate the number ‘of
disabled silicotics in Montana
unable to qualify for either of
the two state programs, or the
number of silicotics who have

The U. S. Bureau of Mines re-

cently reinspected three phos-
phate mines of the Stauffer
Chemical Company in Montana.

Safety improvements" com-
pleted: ' ‘
’ O The space between the rails
at the north section of the west
track at the 5400-level surface
where lagging was unloaded was
floored ‘ adequately.

I Fire extinguishers, fire

. hoses, and water outlets were

provided at the 5700 and the
5400-level portals. The company
placed in service a portable
gasoline—powered fire pump and
800 feet of fire hose to provide
fire protection to those areas
where water was not available
from the regular mine water
systems. This equipment should
give protection equivalent to the
fire hydrants recommended in
previous inspections. ,

' O The ventilation door at the
5700-level crosscut No. 1 was
repaired and placed in working
condition.

0 All electric hand-held tools
were frame-grounded.

O The ends of the hoist ropes
attached to the skip in 5702

back and the cable clamps were

- installed properly.’

_ O The manwayladders in 5702

Recommendations:

OA walkway and sturdy
guardrail should be constructed
along the outer edge of the
track at the 5700—level at the
switch to the waste dump.

0 Additional rope idlers and
guide sheaves should be in-

stalled in the 5402 intermediate ‘V

Hoffa Trials Subject

Of Magazine Article       x
A Copies of “The Hoffa Trial,” a frightening 25-page account of
the lengthy trial in Chattanooga, Tenn., at which the Teamsters

The article by Fred J ._ Cook
appears in the April 27, 1964,
issue of The Nation. Cook, the
author of several books on vari-
ous government agencies and
the ‘military establishment, has
received many journalistic
awards during his many years

_j of reporting.

Hoffa, who was only last‘Sun-

.day convicted in a mail fraud

and “conspiracy” case, was

convicted for the first time in

Chattanooga, ' although he‘ had
repeatedly been brought to trial
on a variety of charges. He

was sentenced to eight years in-
; jail and fined $10,000 on the
_ jury-tampering conviction, which
_ is being appealed.

“Regardless of the outcome
of Hoffa’s individual case on ap-

peal,” writes Cook, “Congress

should. examine the record to
determine whether ‘federal law
enforcement is becoming a law
unto itself.”_ '

On March ‘5,f the day‘ after» I

Hoffa’s first = conviction, the

- president‘ was convicted of jury-tampering, are being mailed to all .
Mine-Mill local officers and stewards. by the international office,

Mine-Mill. international officers
sent him a telegram expressing
“our wholehearted support and
confidence in your appeal
against this unjust decision.”

The Cook article explains in V

detail the extreme efforts of the
Department of Justice to con-
vict Hoffa, and bolsters the po-
sitions of his supporters.
Enough importance was at-
tached by Mine-Mill interna-
tional officers to “The Hoffa

Trial” to have copies distrib-
uted throughout the union in the
hope that it will be widely read.
