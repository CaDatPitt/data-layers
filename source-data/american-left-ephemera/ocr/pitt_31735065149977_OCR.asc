WASHINGTON, D. C.——The U. S. Senate September  * s "  
18 completed favorable congressional action on the
O’Hara mine safety bill. Passed without opposition, the
measure marks a major breakthrough in Mine-Mill’s
long campaign for a national law to guard the safety and

health of metal miners.

Mine-Mill President John Clark hailed the bill’s en-
actment as “an important milestone on the road toward
our goal of federal mine inspection and safety enforce-
ment by the U. S. government.”

Passage by the Senate came just a month after it
had won overwhelming approval in the House. It was on
President Kennedy's desk for signature as the Mine-Mill

Union went to press.

Intensive Mine-Mill acti-
vity was behind every step of
congressional movement on the
bill from its initial considera-
tion by the House Labor and
Education Committee through
House passage, favorable ac-
tion by the Senate Labor and
Public Welfare Committee and
final enactment on the Senate
floor.

THE union’s influential lob-
by work was kicked off with
presentation of testimony by
President Clark to the House
Labor committee which held

‘hearings on the bill in July.

Subsequent action on the mea-
sure was pushed not only by
Mine-Mill lobbyists in personal
contacts with congressional
leaders and top officials in
Vvashington, including Interior
Secretary Stewart Udall, but
by a flood of telegrams, letters
and phone calls by the locals
to their area representatives.

k The great weight given to
the union’s position on the bill
was graphically shown by the
House committee’s report rec-
ommending that the bill be en-
acted into law, and which was
the basis for its approval in
the Senate. A full third of -the
printed report was made up of
material reproduced a l m o s t
word for word from President
Cla-rk’s testimony.

A ﬁnal drive to get the bill
through was put on by Mine-
Mill as soon as it hit the Sen-
ate committee. Telegrams were
sent followed up by phone calls
to members of the committee
and other Senators from Mine-
Mill areas.

ALSO key in the successful
drive were the unflagging ef-
forts of Washington Repre-
sentative Horace White during
the closing days of the session
when chances for Senate ac-
tion on the measure appeared
to be nip and tuck‘.

White worked around the
clock contacting Senators to
get the bill out of committee
and on to the floor for favor-
able action before adjourn-
ment. -

Cooperation was especially
sought and gained from Sena-
tor Barry Goldwater of Ari-
zona, ranking Republican mem-
ber of the Senate subcommit-
tee which had the bill under
consideration. Arizona local
leaders were particularly i_nflu-
ential in this regard.

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Mine-Mill last month opened a vigorous campaign to
protect the jobs of American workers from the threat of Japanese competition for
copper raw materials. The fight was carried directly to the nation’s capital Sept. 14
in around of lobbying by International and local leaders from both coasts. It was re-

inforced by activities launched in Denver and the local areas.

By month’s end, official
Washington was alerted to
the danger posed by unfair
and illegal Japanese competi-
tion on production and employ-
ment in the U. S. copper cus-
tom smelting industry. Gov-
ernment officials were also
briefed with the union’s pro-
gram for removing the threat
to thousands of jobs in this
country.

The serious nature of the
competition was brought home
to authorities here by the
Mine-Mill delegation which met
with officials of the Commerce
and Labor departments and
with Senators and Congress-_
men from the states of New
Jersey and Washington, all of
whom expressed cooperative
concern with the problem.

THE _MlNE-MILL UNION!

October. I96'li

Cleveland Unit
Wins Split Award

The shop chairman and a
grievance committeeman in
the Mor-Flo Company unit of
Cleveland Local 735, dis-
charged for alleged “participa-
tion in a wildcat strike” last
April, were ordered reinstated
with partial back pay and full
seniority rights in a split arbi-
tration decision won by the
union recently.

Dismissal of two other em-
ployees for walking off the
job and leaving the plant
without permission was sus-
tained by the arbitration board
in the written award of its
chairman, Samuel S. Kates.

Albert Sandidge and L. C.
Bolin were among a. list of 11
men originally notified on
April 5 that they were being
given disciplinary layoffs for
insubordination, failure to per-
form assigned work and walk-
ing off -the job.

Although the layoff notice
for all the men Was with-
drawn the same day, a week
later Sandidge and Bolin re-
ceived discharge notices “for
participation in wildcat strike
4-5-61.”

The company's contention
that a sitdown strike had oc-
curred and that the discharge
of the two unit leaders of the
union was not arbitrable was
over-ruled in the arbitration
decision which upheld the un-

ion in stating that no sitdown

strike actually took place and
the case was arbitrable.

Arbitrator Kates ruled the
discharge penalty against
Sandidge and Bolin “was un-
reasonable and not within
good conscience.” Both men
were ordered reinstated with
partial back pay and without
loss of seniority.

their families, as well as
speeches by Int’l Secretary-
Treasurer Dichter, Vice-Presi-
dent Howard and Regional Di-
rector Doster who first joined
the union as a member of this
local.

In dedicating the new head-
quarters as a house of labor
in Saginaw, Dichter said: “I
dedicate this hall to the ad-
vancement of the living stand-
ards of our membership and
their pursuit of freedom, with
the hope that within these
walls all men will meet as

Menendez came with his
wife; Fontana was accompan-
ied by his wife and youngest
son, Louis. Both men took the
opportunity to visit with the
International officers and
staff at Mine-Mill’s Denver
headquarters.

Menendez, a member of the
Local 82 negotiating commit-
tee, has been active in the de-
velopment of company-wide
pension talks by the American
Zinc Coordinating Co u n c i l
which represents AZ locals of
Mine-Mill and four other In-
ternational unions.

Fontana is well-known in
Great Falls as a longtime
leader of Local 16 since the
early 1900s when the organi-
zation was still called the
Western Federation ofvMiners.
He was one of the Great Falls
delegates active in reforming
the International Union at the
St. Paul, Minn., conference in
1926 when Mine-Mill had only
three locals.

Bisbee Auxiliary
Builds Treasury

The recently formed Ladies
Auxiliary of Local 551 at Bis-
bee, Ariz., is already on a firm
financial foundation. Under
the leadership of its president,
Evelyn Elkins, a committee
consisting of Secretary Frankie
Shuck, Louise Hobbs, Mabel
Farley and Billie Dalton has
completed a project netting
around $600 for the Auxiliary’s
treasury.

Business firms in the Bisbee
area took advertising space on
an attractive display in the
Local 551 Union Hall at $10 a
year. Seventy-two firms par-
ticipated. Expected renewals
next year will help furnish the
Auxiliary with a regular in-
come.

The funds raised will enable
the ladies to finance their
political action and community
betterment activities. These
will include backing this
month’s election on a Junior
College for Cochise County.

With the money raised thus
far, the Auxiliary has already
bought tables for a bi-weekly
Tuesday night bingo party at
the Union Hall to afford pleas-
ant diversion for the member-
ship and families and also to
provide a means o-f raising
funds for Auxiliary activities.

Leaders of San Manuel

Local Back Fred Sanchez

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.——Office-rs, stewards and com-
mitteemen here are solidly supporting their full-time
Local 937 President Fred Sanchez, target of attack in
a year-long raid by the Steelworkers at San Manuel

Copper Company, subsidiary of Magma Copper.

Although an election pe-
tition was dismissed by the
NLRB last year, the Steel
agents have continued their
disruptive tactics through a
series of court action harass-
ments of Sanchez. Member-
ship reaction to the attacks on
their union through Sanchez
is one of disgust and resent-
ment against the raiders.

Two of the personal attacks
have already boomeranged. A
Steel-instigated unfair labor
practice charge against San-
chez and the local was thrown
out by‘ the NLRB. Another
“disturbing the peace” charge
was dismissed when the Steel
organizer who filed‘ it failedto
appear in court. ‘

THE latest union—busting
move, now pending in Superi-
or Court, is an action in which
Steel seeks a restraining order
against Sanchez, charging “co-
ercion, threats and putting su-
gar in gas tanks.” There is
little likelihood of division

‘among, the membership on

this matter, either.

Officers, stewards and other
leaders of Local 937 have
signed a statement pledging
“full support to President
Fred Sanchez in. his fight. to
keep th_e Local‘ united and to
defeat the spurious charges
leveled against him by the dis-
rupters from Steel or any oth-

er group attempting to attack

the Union ‘through him.”

Local 937, meanwhile, is
working closely through the
Magma Council with sister
Magma Local 938 at Superior.
in preparation for next year’s
joint bargaining. Their pro-
gram on job equalization is
well underway. Int’l Rep. Lew
Cochran, now living in Mam-
moth, is assisting.

“Mine-Mill,” he said, “is one
union which has not compro-
mised its traditional adherence
to the principle of equality.”
He commended the Southern
membership for always sup-
porting the major battles

-waged by the rest of the work-

ers elsewhere in the union.

Also initiating ’ discussion
was a review by Dichter on de-

A REPORT on the district,
stressing the strike of Local

ley, Tenn., was given by Board
Member Anderson and supple-

Stressed in

Mine-Mill Research Director
Bernard W. Stern gave a run
down on key jobs and rates
in Kennecott, illustrated by
charts highlighting major
wage structure differences be-
tween workers there and in
PD.

He stressed that the higher
Kennecott job rates had been
achieved by the elimination of
three quarters of the long-
existing southwest differential
and the thorough joint job
evaluation program won by
Mine-Mill. Such programs in
PD andotherchains, he said,
eventually will lead to a uni-
form copper industry W a g e
scale. "

STERN also pointed to three
stages to be carried out in the"
PD program: securing job de-
scriptions and comparing them
with already evaluated Ken-
necott jobs; drafting the un-
ion’s proposals for a thorough
joint equalization procedure;
evaluation and slotting of all
occupations into a Wage struc-
ture comparable to the pres-
ently higher Kennecott rates.

In line with this, the Council
decided to step up its work on
stage one, utilizing the serv-
ices of PD Coordinator Sylvain
Schnaittacher, and setting Dec.
31 as the deadline for comple-
tion of this stage with draft
proposals to be ready by the
next convention in March.

Western Vice-President Al
Skinner brought the delegates

activities in South Carolina
and Georgia.

In addition to pledging all-
out support behind both those
contract struggles, the dele-
gates voted to petition the In-
ternational Union to reconsti-
tute the Phosphate and Ferti-
lizer Council so as to coordi-
nate local bargaining at these
plants in the South.

Discussion on defense of the
union, opened by Vice-Presi_-
dent Howard who gave the
latest details on the conspir-
acy and SACB cases led to a

with their congressmen and

senators on pending legisla-«

tion of special interest to the
union.

Following considerable dis-
cussion of Dichter’s report on
union finances, the conference
went on record unanimously
recommending that\ea.ch local
in District 5 immediately start
paying the 75-cent per capita
increase which the district had
voted for in the last referen-
dum even though the proposi-
tion was not passed nation-
ally.

A motion passed by the dele-
gates thanked host 531 for its
hospitality which included ar-
rangements for eating and
sleeping facilities for the dele-
gates.

Many of the delegates com-
mented that the conference
was the best they'd ever at-
tended in the district, and urged
that more of them be held.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

October. 1961 V‘

Vice-President:

Skinner Reports on
Situation in Sudbury

I T THIS writing I have been in the Sudbury mining
district of Ontario for a month. We are now fight-

ing a full—blown raid by the Steelworkers’ Union in the
largest mining district in North America. This raid en-
compasses the 17,000—man Local 598 and Local 902 (an

em amalgamated local of 1600 service workers").

Sudbury isthe best organized union town
in Canada——thanks to Mine-Mill. Sudbury
has the fourth highest per capita income
among all Canadian cities—thanks to Mine-
Mill.

The Steel leaders have for many years
been envious of Mine-Mill’s reputation and
record among the working people in Canada.
They have been attempting for years to
muscle in on Mine-Mil1’s big industrial base
in Sudbury and especially the International
Nickel. Company where Mine-Mill has 15,000
members.

Until two years ago, Steel just couldn’t buy or influence
enough leaders around Sudbury to make a noise. But two years
ago an entirely new executive board was elected in Local 598
committed to oppose the Canadian National Union. Then the
disruption started and Steel found allies among this new execu-
tive board. Plotting in secret meetings with Steel leaders has
been going on for over a year behind the backs of the member-

ship.
‘ fr it it
VERY effort ~'was made by these local leaders and Steel
_ 1 officials to block the organization of the big new Inco
operations at Thompson, Manitoba, last year. But the National

Union won and a potential 2,000 more Inco workers came under
Mine-Mill contract.

During this period Local 598 president Don Gillis continued
to beat the drums for a direct local union charter from the
Canadian Labor Congress. He couldn't get such a charter and
he knew it-—but he continued trying to fool and mislead the

  

Skinner

’ membership. He knew the miners, millmen and smeltermen in

this area didn’t want Steel so he held out the promise of a CLC
charter as a substitute.

‘When Gillis and his local executive withheld per capita from
the National Union beginning last March, the Canadian officers
knew that the showdown was coming with the Gillis faction in
Local 598. Every previous attempt by the National officers to
make peace with the Gillis faction had failed. -

it 7% it

IN AUGUST Tommy Taylor, a. trustee on_ the 598 executive

board, resigned and exposed the whole three-way deal worked
out in numerous secret meetings between Claude Jodoin, presi-
dent of the CLC; VVilliam Mahoney, Canadian Director of Steel,
and Local 598 executives. -Taylor documented the entire story
in a sworn affidavit.

In the meantime, more than 6,000 local members signed
petitions calling on Canadian President Kenneth Smith to take
over the affairs of the local union. These events smoked Gillis
and his group out in the open, and the raid was on. Gillis called
upon Claude Jodoin and William Mahoney to speak at a mass
rally Sept. 10 in the Sudbury Arena where they hoped to deliver
Local 598 to the Steelworkers lock, stock and barrel. But they
made a big mistake and forgot that the rank and file members
had other ideas. ‘ A ‘

Of the 6,000 members attending the,Arena meeting more
than two-thirds ‘of them were determined to stop this bald
attempt to deliver their local to the Steel leaders. These Steel
leaders, with the help of the Sudbury police, barred every
Mine-Mill leader from entering the meeting, including President
Smith, myself, District President Mike Solski and District7Secre-
tary Kennedy.

‘ii? fr it

WITH thousands of members outside the hall demanding
entrance, the doors were bolted, tear gas released by police
and heads cracked.. Such is the way Gillis and his cohorts prac-

tice union democracy. Later the doors -were reopened and mem-.

bers admitted, except those like myself and the other Canadian
officers. This was the first time in 23 years in’ this union that
I was barred from a Mine-Mill meeting, but of course it wasn't
a Mine-Mill meeting—it was a Steel meeting. The only trouble

for]gGillis was there were too many Mine-Mill members in the
ha] .. ' '

Every time Hahoney or Jodoin tried to speak their voices
were drowned -in a sea of “boos” and a constant chant of~“We
Want Smith!” Smith, of course, like myself, was outside blocked
from entering the Arena by the police on Gillis’s orders. But

’ Gillis never actually had his meeting. After two hours Gillis,

Mahoney and Jodoin gave up. The big Steel promotion (they
had 20 tables set up and stacks of Steel application cards ready)
was a big failure! ‘ '
The next day Mahoney, the Steel director, announced that
Steel was in business and the raid was on. Steel has a bigcrew
of staff agents here and, with the help of the Gillis local

machine, they are conducting a vigorous campaign to get cards:

signed. They could never have gotten this raid off the-ground
except for Gillis and his machine_because the overwhelming
majority of members here want nothing to_ do with Steel». But
that won’t stop Steel leaders from raiding-----it never has.

Canada C onvenfion Delegates
Approve Fighf Fund Target

EDMONTON, ’Alberta—A Fight Back fund of $200,000 to be used to defeat Steel
raiders in Sudbury will be the target of Mi ne-Mill locals in C a n a d a. The $200,000
Fight Back Fund, proposed by the Ways and Means Committee of the Union’s 12th

Delegates lined up at the
“mikes” to endorse the sen-
timents of Western District
President Harvey Murphy who
told the convention “this union
will mobilize its entire physical
resources to defeat: the Steel

raiders and splitters.”

Murphy also emphasized that

the entire C an a. di a n labour

movement would be supplied
with full details of the sinister
plot between the Steel leader-
ship, leaders of the Canadian
Labour Congress and the offi-
cers of Local 598 in Sudbury.
He predicted that the majority
of Canadian unionists would
condemn the conspiracy and
would demand an accounting
from CLC leaders. -

The Fight Back fund is to be
raised by pre-payment of per
capita or by any other means

local unions may decide on.

INTERNATIONAL officers,
including President John Clark,
Vice-President Al Skinner,
Vice-President Asbury Howard
and Secretary-Treasurer Irving
Dichter, pledged that the fight
to defeat the Steel raiders
would be hacked to the hilt by
the American section of the
union.

' Vice-President Skinner, who

has been in Sudbury playing a S A

leading part in the fight since
the Steel raid came into the
open, told the convention dele-
gates: “Steel has enough
money to buy a few local lead-
ers but it cannot buy the loy-
alty of the 17,000 members of
Local 598 to their union)’.

In a biting, hard hitting
speech which ‘drew. spontane-
ous applause, he ,d.eclar’ed:

’ ‘.‘Mine-Mill is a great union be;
cause of the miners, millmen "

a Canadian convention, won spirited and unanimous a
who met in the Hotel MacDonald here Sept. 18-20.

provoked by the fact that three
of the Local 598 officers who
sold out to Steel were sitting
in -the back of the convention
hall. ' »

“Let them sit there,” said
Smith. “Mine-Mill conventions
are open to the press and the
public because this union has
nothing to hide. These three

_ Steel agents would like to pro-

voke incidents in the’ hope of
getting publicity. Ignore them,
they are beneath your con-
tempt.” '

Smith said it was ironic that
the three discredited Local 598
officers—Don McNabb, Roger
Joly and George Ingham—had
appeared because they had con-
spired to deliberately break the
Mine-Mill constitution and by
so doing had prevented the
local’s membership from being
officially represented.

“But,” he emphasized, “this
is the way these people work.

THE MINE-MILL UNION‘

 
 

American Labor Gets

‘Labor Day’ Reminder

 At the beginning of last month, Labor Day was ob-
 served and given tribute with millions of words both in
the commercial and trade union press all over the coun-
try. One editorial appeared to be particularly appro-

~ priate as a domestic reminder to labor as a whole of a

task not yet completed.
‘ The editorial appeared in
the Sept. 2 issue of the Balti-
more AFRO-AMERICAN, one
..of the nation’s leading Negro
newspapers. Titled “Labor’s
Unfinished Task,” the editorial
, said, in full: 0
, LABOR DAY is the time
”/“.\\evhen America shows its re-
_. rspect... for working men. The
muscles and skills of Ameri-
can labor have transferred
this continent’s rich, promise
into the realities" of existence
on which the whole world de-
pends directly or indirectly.
Although American workers
. are not unique in their contri-
, bution to their nation—la.bor-
ers everywhere make similar
_ _cont1'ibuti_on —' nowhere els e
‘s have their‘ efforts been so
 lauded and so appreciated.

It was not always so. Al- .

_though this country was
founded on the principles of
classless democracy, the man
who worked with his hands
_was both underestimated and
underpaid; _

BECAUSE this country had
, at least the machinery for

-..democracy, the working men
‘pooled their social and politi-
cal strengths to become mas-

ters of their destinies rather
than pawns of capital.
Through their strength collec-
tively, they won respect for
their worth individually.

In so doing, they nudged
the nation a little closer to its
ideal of true democracy. They
have succeeded in guarantee-
ing that no man can be looked
down upon because of the job-
he holds.

Having helped America thus '
far, the forces of labor can
tackle another obstacle that
blocks this nation from her
dream. They can work toward
the guarantee that no man can
be looked down upon because
of his color. —

>l< >I< III

THIS is one facet o-f_ the so-.
cio-economic s t r u g gl e that
organized la b o Jr has _ over-"
looked too long. A

No longer able to plead the
pressure of other business, the
labor unions should now rid
themselves of the very kind
of evil they ridded the country
of. ‘

boast of its exploits in the
forums of world opinion with-
out holding crossed fingers be-
hind its back.

THE MINE-‘MILL UNION

Mine-Mill Canadian National President K. A. Smith (right) and Team-

Workers at New Gold
Mine Vote Mine-Mill

TIMMINS, Ont.—Workers at the new Kam Kotia
mines in the Timmins gold fields have rejected the Steel-
workers and chosen Mine-Mill as their bargaining agent.
In a representation election ‘conducted by the Ontario
Labor Relations Board on Aug. 25-, they showed their

preference for Mine-Mill
over Steel by a vote of
30 to 24. ‘

Significant in the victory is
the fact that it took place in
an area where the Steel union
had successfully raided Mine-
Mill organized gold properties
some 10 years ago.

Mine-Mill Canadian District
2 President Mike Solski, who
is heading new organizing
drives in the district, said the
Kam Kotia election result
makes it evident “that Tim-
mins workers have had a belly-
full of Steel propaganda which
has left them 47 cents per
hour behind the lowest paid
Mine-Mill member in the gold
fields.”

recently went into production,

ing campaign.

Steel’s belated all-out drive,
including a letter from dissi-
dent Local 598 secretary Ray
Poirier in Sudbury attacking
Mine-Mill, failed to convince
the men at the new property
that the Steel union had any-

thing to offer workers in the

mining industry.

Many Important Issues Still
Face Next Congress Session

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The first session of Congress.under the Kennedy adminis-

tration wound up its business late last month after a final flurry over the Senate fili-

buster rule and foreign aid funds. The exodus of lawmakers out of Washington had

already begun days before Congress adjourned sine die early morning, Sept. 27, just
before Mine-Mill Union presstime.

Struggling since Labor
Day to depart Washington
after its longest session in 10
years, and with more than
eight months work on the
record, the 87th Congress
cleared away most of the
"must" items before quitting.

Many important, issues, how-
ever, were left over to its sec-
ond session which convenes
next January. Classified as un-
finished business are such
items as health care _ for the
aged, civil rights, tax reform,
modernization of unemploy-
ment insurance and adequate
federal aid for schools.

= Mine-Mill, in activity on its
legislative program and in
testimony before several con-
gressional committees, had
made its voice heard on all
these items of unfinished
business as well as on bills
which were passed——including
social security, housing, mini-
mum wage, unemployment
compensation extension, high-
way construction, depressed
areas, aid for needy children‘
and mine safety (see story
on page 1).
* >l= >3:

ON TWO key programs,
foreign aid and assistance to
public schools, the Adminis-
tration suffered sharp -set-
backs. Congress cut the heart
out of the Kennedy program
for foreign economic aid by
refusing to authorize Treasury
borrowing and left the big
school aid bill stranded in the
House Rules committee.

Moneywise, the Administra-
tion wound up with almost all
its original demands on foreign
aid. A Senate-House confer-
ence committee approved total
funds of $3.91 billion, not too
far short of the $4.2 billion re-
garded as “satisfactory” by
the Administration.

The big rub in the foreign
aid outcome is that while the
President had been given au-
thority to make long-term
commitments, he must run
the Appropriations Committee
gauntlet each year to make
good on them. '

>l= !l= * '

ON SCHOOL aid, the most
that could be salvaged was ex-
tension of the National De-
fense Education Act, essential-
ly a limited scholarship pro-
gram, and continuation of
federal help to “impacted
areas.” The latter are school
districts with a heavy con-

ture pensioners, effective next
January 1; removal of age
limitation on disability pen-
sion.

The contract expires July
1, 1962. Negotiations were led

Lead-Zinc Bill Fate
‘Was Still in Doubt’

, “Lead—Zinc Bill Still Bouncing Around in Congress”
was the headline late last month on a story in the Amer-
ican Metal Market, the daily newspaper of the metal
trade. The story, of course, was all about the latest mis-
adventures of Congressman Ed Edmon.dson’s (D., Okla.)

small lead-zinc mines sub-
sidy bill, which passed the
House of Representatives Au-
gust '24 by a vote of 196 to 172.

"\ At Mine-Mill press deadline,

fate of -the bill in the Senate
was still in doubt.

The bill, when passed to the
Senate for action, was referred
to the Senate Mining and Min-
erals Subcommittee chaired by
Senator John Carroll (D.,
Colo.). Here it was tacked on
to the Anderson-Aspinall lead-
zinc tariff bill as a rider in
place of the original Anderson-

_Aspinall bill’s subsidy section.

>l< >l< >l<

A IN this form the bill was re-
ported to the Senate, where
Senator Byrd (D., Va.) insisted
that it be referred to the Fi-
nance‘ Committee of which he
is chairman.

In the Finance Committee,
the bill was pruned down to
the original language of the
Edmondson bill as passed by
the House.

It was reported again to the
Senate and passed under the
unanimous consent rule on
September 21.

HOWEVER, someone slipped
up in not listing the bill on the
“consent” calendar, and Sena-
tor Eausche (D., Ohio’) insisted

that the bill be recalled for an-

other vote.

This had» to be put off until
the following week, which is

~ why the rest of the story of
this bill will have to be put of

another ‘ month. -

Squeeze Pu'l- on
Watered Hams

WASHINGTON —— The De-

put the squeeze on watered
hams. Agriculture Secretary
Orville Freeman ordered that
ham must be ham and not ham
with water added, ‘thus revers-
ing his predecessor, Ezra Ben-
son, who let interstate packers
leave up to 10 per cent added
moisture in smoked pork
products.

Freeman’s order followed ex-
tensive investigation, including
hearings in eight cities, which
showed that consumers did not
want ham with water added.

  ,lNDUSTRYNOTES-

ANTI-TRUST probe of copper and brass industry by U. S.
Justice Department is still “very much alive,” according to a
spokesman for the antitrust division. An air of mystery has
surrounded the probe since the sudden recessing of the grand
jury impaneled to hear the case last April in Hartford, Con-
necticut, after a one-day session.

Since then, according to the division spokesman, three gov-
ernment lawyers have been working full time combing sub-
poenaed company records for law violations. American Brass,
Chase, Phelps-Dodge Copper Products, Bridgeport Brass, and
other major producers are included in the probe. _

The grand jury may be reconvened to hear the govern-
ment’s case before the end of the year.

ﬁzﬁrik

PHELPS-DODGE announced in mid-September that it was
immediately resuming “full production” at its mines in Arizona.
The company announced in July 1960 that it was cutting back
production by ten percent, although many observers have

 

doubted that production was actually curtailed by this amount._

This view is supported by a statement in the company’s

last anmial report that mine work schedules were not reduced.

until late in October 1960, when they were cut from the equiva-
lent of 6 days per week to 53/4 days—a reduction of little more
than four percent in scheduled hours of work.

This could have been offset in whole or in part by speedup ‘

and other steps to increase output per man-hour. The company
says the improved marketing outlook justifies restoring the
production “cut.”

fr it 7%

PHANTOM PRODUCTION CUTS are not confined to U. S.
producers. A dispatch from London in a recent issue of AMER-
ICAN METAL MARKET notes‘ that “although three subsidi-
aries of the Rhodesian Selection Trust Ltd. (African copper
producers controlled by AMERICAN METAL CLIMAX, INC.-
ed.) are supposedly operating on curtailed production sched-

ules, only one showed any appreciable decrease in copper output .

during the . . . year which ended June 30, 1961.”

One can only guess why this sort of deception is practiced.
Perhaps the phony cuts are announced in the hope that com-
petition will be fooled into cutting back, or that purchasers
thereby will be made less eager to look for copper price bar-

gains.
ﬁr air sir

SOVIET negotiations to buy Chilean copper on a long-time
contract basis, stymied earlier this year, have been resumed.
Talks are now being held with small, independent Chilean pro-
ducers over the sale of up to 60,000 tons per year to Russia, in
ingot and semi-processed form. ’

LEAD BARTER DEALS with Australia and Canada were
announced recently by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the
U. S. Department of -Agriculture. Altogether $18,000,000 worth

of surplus U. S. farm commodities, mainly tobacco, wheat and

feed grains were traded off to Japan, Italy and Peru, which
agreed to ship raw materials and manufactured goods of equal
value to Australia and Canada.

In return, the U. S. got 100,000 tons of lead from Broken
Hill, Australian lead producer, and Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Co. in Canada. The lead will go into the U. S. stockpile
and help to reduce the world surplus.

This is intended indirectly to improve the market for U. S.
produced lead, and was part of a plan agreed on at the last U.
N. Committee meeting on lead and zinc at Mexico City. Both
Broken Hill and Consolidated agreed, as part of the deal, to
limit future“ production of lead.

GOLD DBEDGING on dry desert land is under way in the
San Domingo and Weaver areas about 50 miles northwest‘ of
Phoenix, Arizona. The new processpromises to be a practical
method for extracting gold from dry, desert placers. ’

Previously, because of lack of water, it had been impossible
to exploit placer gold deposits which have long been known to
exist in the Southwest.

The new method involves separation of larger rocks by a
grizzly and sifting of what passes through in a series of
vibrating screens until only finer sand remains. Placer gold is
most commonly found in the fine particles. The remaining
material is heated to drive out all moisture and then dropped
onto electro-static separater tables. The gold particles become

fixed to the tables and waste material is blown off, leaving a

residue of gold generally 90 to 95 percent pure.

IN all their discussions, the
union spokesmen called atten-
tion to aggressive Japanese
purchases of copper scrap and
concentrates in the U. S. and
abroad, and to the sharp in-
crease in imports of these ma-
terials by Japan.

Behind this phenomenal ex-
pansion of ’ copper smelting
and refining. in Japan, they
pointed out, are a 10 per cent
tariff on refined copper favor-
ing the importation of scrap
‘and concentrates which pay no
tariff duty, and severe limita-
tions on imports of refined
copper through import licens-
ing controls.

These measures have caused
the price of copper in Japan to
rise to about 5 cents a pound
over the price of copper in
other countries, enabling Jap-
anese smelters to outbid Amer-
ican and other smelters for
Concentrates, even as close to
home as British Columbia. In
the United States,‘ Japanese
buyers have driven up the
price of ‘scrap and have caused

 ,‘sev.ere, "shortages, felt _‘ by SEC‘. ‘

 

  Leads Jobs F

ondary smelters all over the
country. ‘

Such Japanese subsidized
competition not only threatens
the continued operation of the
Tacoma AS&R smelter, where
the work force has already
been reduced by some 600 men,
but also has affected cutbacks
at U. S. Metals in Carteret and
will affect production and em-
ployment at the Perth Amboy
AS&R plant if the difficulty in
buying scrap continues. '

=l< >l= >l<

THE Mine-Mill delegation
urged a three-fold program of
action to remove the threat of
this unfair and illegal Japanese
competition’:

0 Limitation of scrap ex-
ports to Japan by the Com-
merce Department;

0 Protest by the State De-
partment of, the Japanese
treaty violation in refusing to
permit importation of refined
copper even though -the Japa-
nese duty is paid;

0 Action by the State De-

partment on Japanese tariff.
discrimination against refined.

copper imports. (Japanese
tariff on refined copper is 10
per cent, zero on ores and con-
centrates; U. S. tariff on re-
fined copper and copper con-
tent of ores and concentrates
is the same.)

In addition, the union’s lob-
byists urged that these points

be included on the agenda at.

the forthcoming meeting in
Japan of U. S. and Japanese
cabinet members.

‘ =l= #4 >l4

THE delegates came ‘away
from each session with the
feeling that the discussions
were highly fruitful, especially
in the great interest and sym-
pathetic response shown by the
government officials in their
pinpointing of the problem
and its solution.

Adding his voice to the lobby
in Washington, District 7 Exec-
utive Board Member James
Buck sent a telegram to Com-

sideration to immediate impo-
sition of licensing controls on
export of copper scrap to
Japan and "representation to

Japanese government for end-'

ing of. discriminatory tariff
treatment of refined copper.”

-Similar wires were also sent
by Mine-Mill smelter locals in

Senator Douglas Criticizes I g  
Jobless Figuring Method   

WASHINGTON, D. C.——-Sen. Paul Douglas l(D‘., I11.) ; I
says the present method used by the government to‘-figfure”
joblessness fails to give a true percentage of unemployed .— 

workers.

The Census Bureau’s sample of 35,000;fami1,ies~..:in-g

cludes many self-employed
and unpaid workers in fam-
ily enterprises who rarely can
be listed as unemployed. Elim-
inating this group from the
over-all work force and ad-
justing the Census Bureau
sample would have brought
the percentage of unemployed
not corrected for s e a s o 11 al
factors to 8.9 percent in June,
for instance, instead of the
7% percent reported.
Another factor is the under-
statement of part-time work
or “involuntary unemploy-
ment.”- Correcting the statis-
tics for this factor would add
2.4 percent more to the rate of
joblessness for June, bring-

ing the total to 11.3 percent,
Douglas says. ,

Giving due weight to these
factors, the Illinois Senator

notes, it can be seen “that the 
total proportion of time lost
by those in June rose to 11.3 :
percent. In absolute termsthis‘
is a full 3 percent higher than".
the figure commonly used.”~

Integration leader Dr..=Mar-‘

that “stand-ins” at voter regis-
tration places will be the next
tactic in the battle against;-ra I
cial discrimination in voting, . 4‘
rights. “In the future, there,
Will be thousands of Negroes"
standing at places where they
have been denied the right to
register,” the Baptist clergy-
man said. The goal is to double
the Negro voter registration
of 1.3 million in the South, he
said.
