 S WE GO to press this International
 ‘Union again sees its membership
 either back on the job or in some cases

waiting for their call as operations in the
mines, mills and smelters resume. ‘

Six months ago we were ;
 ’ faced with the knowledge 
' A that if any gains were‘ to 
be made in our existing 
contracts, it meant an all 
 -.out _-fight against the non-
ferrous In e t a 1 s industry.
These companies—like steel,
oil, railroads and other in-
dustries -— had, certainly
 through collusion, decided
'0 on a “no give” attitude in

this year's bargaining.
The fight was on, and the

fight is finished. '

., -As usual, the Mine-Mill membership in their
historic tradition went into this fight with a
2 determination‘ to wrest some ‘gains from the‘-

Feb. 12 issue, called attention
to the fact that “The Mine,

tributions fromtother unions to
help it in a two,-pronged fight!”
Written before Phelps Dodge

' t‘ and Anaconda settled, the edi-
'  torial referred: to the continu-

ring copper strike as -one of
the two f1'onts»'-on which the
union was battling, terming
the strike’ “as bitter as that
suffered by the Steelworkers.”

. Advocate, organ of the Colorado State AFL—CIO. The
weekly-vnewspaper, published in Denver, is owned by over
«:60;-labor organizations rep- '

against Mine-Mill. Said the
Advocate:  ,
“Nine past and present offi-
cers of the union are engaged
in appealing conviction of
charges of conspiring to de-
fraud the government by vio-
lating the Taft-Hartley act " on
the non!" - communist affidavit

, wasa ‘conspiracy’ to .‘restrain’

The editorial concluded: . t

.n ‘_ “We have some doubtsabout
the leadership of Mine-Mill (it

was expelled from the old

about the need of its members

Outstanding Strike Solidarity

shown by U.S., Canadian Locals  

DENVER - Some outstand-
ing contributions were made
 by Mine-Mill locals to the cop-
“per strike last month, a few
even from locals which had
been on strike themselves and
exhausted their treasuries.

‘ ‘donations, and does not in-
clude a number of both, strike
and d e f e n s e contributions

Most unusual demonstration
of _ strike solidarity was made
by Local 365 in Perth Amboy,

strike against AS&R for four
months until the settlement
was made in that chain at the
beginning of December.

By NATHAN wrrr . 
Mine-Mill General Counsel ' '

   

There are so many interesting and; 

important angles to the recent conspiracy

trial against the 11 Mine-Mill leaders -that 

it would take a lengthy book to cover
them all. But there is one particularly in- 
teresting aspect of the case I‘ would like to 
deal within this article. , "  ._ —

, As the , members of Mine-Mill». know from," ‘
the trial bulletins and from - the summations
by defense counsel which appeared in the "

the , excerpts of the summation by Telford_- 0-
Taylor, the case against the defendants could

 

scarcely have been weaker. As a lawyer, I ami 7 ‘C 4

quite confident that the appellate courts 
reverse these convictions because the evidence
was insufficient to send the case to the jury
to begin. with. . . _,  . iv
. But the aspect of this matter which I am‘

sure every Mine-Mill member will findof great  

interest, in light of the weakness '_of_ the prose- ’ _
cution case, has to do with the enormous ef--4'

fort which went into building a ‘case against  

the defendants. - To bring this out, I have to 3'

remind you of the extraordinary persecution  

an ran .22: .~ 

 to‘ which -Mine-Mill has been subjected since  ”
. - Taft-Hartley was first passed in-~T19.47-..» ’ A

 fCo,lnoriddo Labor   Advocate in 

In 1953, ‘Jencks was - indicted.  1954, the  
N.L.R.B.- started its tdecomplianceglzcasse against V

Mine-Mill and, in the‘ same%.year;,,,-Travis. was

- indicted. ‘In 1955, the. S.A.C.B. _p;-_I.’ o _c:ee.d i n g

against Mine-Mill was .instituted’. ]in1.€1956, the

conspiracy indictment was  down. *At: 

no time in the last seven years has‘: there been”
a period when Mine-Mill has -.-been; free from

legal . attack on the basis of = the «Communist ,-

issue. ‘There have been trials,i-"hearings, or" ap-' _
peals going -on at all times in“thi,s» seven year-
period. t  7  4

However, to appreciate‘ the tiine,‘ money,  -_
and effort which have gone ‘into "this attempt  4

-to pin the Communist label on Mine-Mill and

to "make it stick, we have to go back to’1948 
at . least. We know from testimony of Ken

,.Eckert and others that in’ that year, if not C

before, the attempt to build a case against 

Mine-Mill or-1 tits leaders under -Taft-Hartley
was under way. . = 7 v ‘

and that of others that, at ‘itimei since then‘?

has there been-, a halt in,‘ the ,effo_rt to obtain-2,; ,

Paid informers were extensively .. used .. for

this purpose—in Connecticut,-;,in, Al_a,bama,-.i_n ‘S I

the Southwest, in California, in,-,M_o_ntana,- and
in other places. Bil1.Mason was making‘ re-
ports to the_.,F_BI in 1953, even.whi_le, he was

still a member‘: of Mine-Mill's Executive‘ Board.  jﬁ
Whenever_ an official or staff member lost 7 ‘

out in Mine-Mill or was fired or merely quit,

he was immediately contacted in an effort to  ’

get damaging evidence from him and a_ prom-

ise to testify. This happened not only... in the: — i 4'

case of Eckert, but.in the cases of Ralph Ras-

' mussen, Fred Gardner, Ralph Locke, Gene .  If

Peterson, Leo Ortiz, Warren Horie, George 5 

Knott, Homer Wilson, and others.

Even officials, staff members,  clerical‘ 7.

Rep. Emanuel Celler, a key

Union's Pension Vesting Drive

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

OTTAWA, Ont.-—-Three days of active lobbying were spent in Ottawa recently by
a Mine Mill delegation headed by Canadian National Executive Board Member Ray
Stevenson and consisting of Officers and Executive members of Locals 598 and 637 in
Sudbury and Port Colborne. The delegation’s trip to Ottawa and the brief presented
to Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament were part of the national campaign

for pension vesting rights
in the INCO pension plan.
The delegation was accom-
panied by Brothers Lukin Rob-
inson-, Research Director, and
Mel Colby, Press Officer.’
The delegation met with the
Minister of Labour, the Hon-
ourable Michael Starr. The ar-
guments presented in support
of the Union’s demand for pen-
sion vesting were so persua-
sive that the Minister said he
thought we had “a good case”
and he said he would give our
brief favorable consideration.
Later, the delegation met
with Mr._ M. J. A. Lambert,
Parliamentary Assistant to Mr.
Nowlan, Minister of National
Revenue. We asked Mr. Lam-
bert What progress had been

" made in arranging the meeting

between the Union, the Com-
pany and Mr. Nowlan, which
the Minister proposed last fall.

-3‘.

Mr. Lambert pointed out that '

all three. parties must be- Will--

ing to attend such a meeting,
and that more work might
have to be done before a date

could lpedefinitely set. He, .su'_g-N
gested that alternative‘_w‘a'ys. of '

arI‘iviI'1g.. ‘at the desired ‘result

could‘ also be looked into.” The

Union stressed the point that

-the final decision on pension

vesting rested with the Gov-

* ernrnent, and we urged the en-
iforcement of pension vesting

as a condition of income tax
exemption.

’ >’.«* an is

THE delegation also met
with a group of Members of

"Parliament from constituen-

cies where there are Mine Mill
Locals. The Members attending

~ had. been invited at the Union’s
suggestion, by Mr. M. L. Mc-

Farlane, member for Kootenay

East. The following attended:
A. C. Cadieu, whose constitu- i
ency of Meadow Lake, Saskat-
chewan, includes Beaverlodge
Local‘ 913; J. R. Garland (Nip-
pissing-Temagami Local 1020) :

IN THE absence of Vice
President Harvey-Murphy, who
was heading; a; delegation of
the Western District Union to.
the B. C. Provincial Govern-
ment, Brother Don Gillis, Pres- -
ident of Local 598, met with
Prime Minister Diefenbaker.
Brother Gillis reported that he.
pressed the ‘case for pension_
vesting vigorously and that
the Prime Minister said he
would let us know‘ as soon as
a decision" is reached on the
matter. ’ .

The group from Local "598,

who arrived in Ottawa the day
before the others of the delega-
tion, met with the.C.C.F. House
caucus, whose members come
from constituencies where
there are several Mine Mill
Locals. Support  expressed
for the Union’s demand for
pension vesting.

In the discussion with Mem-
bers, the Union had the op-
portunity of answering the ob-
jection that pension vesting
properly falls in the_ field of
labour legislation, andis there-
fore a provincial, not a federal
matter. We pointed out that
the requirement of pension
vesting was formerly in the
famous “Blue Book” put“o“tit

_by the Department of National

Revenue, that pension vesting
had been, on paper at least, a
condition of federal income
tax exemption for company
contributions to pension
funds, and that it should be
restored. A

‘ Ii! 4: ea

THE PROVINCES have the
power to legislate- for portable
pensions, if they want. But
this does not in any way limit
the Federal Government’s
power to deal with the mat-
ter by regulation under the
Income Tax Act. The Union’s
brief called on the Federal
Government to do this, to
bring. back the regulations
that used‘ to be in the “Blue,
Book," and to enforce them so
as to give workers the pen-
sion protection they deserve.

The Union’s brief, of which
a copy has been sent to all
Members of Parliament, con-
tained a good deal of new ma-
terial not previously sub-
mitted. - ‘ —

The Montana settlement vic-

«tory climaxed a long and

tough struggle during which
the State Supreme Court acted

‘twice to makewelfare funds
_available to needy strikers
and their families, first ‘up-
holding District Judge Down-

ey’s decision of non-discrimina- -
tion against strikers and then
ruling recently that the State.
Welfare Board must provide
funds. , A
Duringthe strike’s last cou-
ple of months the company
used every pressure and 1111-
fair tactic in a massive at-

’-tempt to force the Local 117

agreement on the miners and
smeltermen. These e f f or t s
,_were rejected ‘time and again
It. became evident to the
people of Montana and even '
as far away as Seattle that the
company literally was trying
to starve its employees into
submission. But friendly hands
‘were held out in all quarters.

The Silver Bow Emergency
Aid committee was formed
and wideksuppgort for _Butte in
its struggle, with the company
was generated from many
communities throughout Mon-'

’ tana and elsewhere. Scores of

organizations and individuals
rallied to aid the miners and

— smeltermen, helping to achieve

the ‘victory over the powerful

I Anaconda company.

‘_ It was during this period
that intervention of Montana's
congressional delegation . was

‘requested by the union. Direct

assistance was also given in

‘strike-settling efforts by In-

tion. Finnegan's intervention
brought about resumption of
negotiations which resulted in
the victorious strike settle-
ment. ’ 3

To members of the Joint Ne-

V gotiating committee, the most

significant factor in the strike
was the two-fol involvement

of the whole community on

the side1'.of,th_e miners and
smeltermen against the An"_a-

conda company. .

First, community-wide pres-
sures built up on behalf of the
strikers for a fair settlement,
with resentment. d e ve I o p e (1
against the company's efforts

to ram its terms down the

throats of the union and the

communities of Butte, Great"

Falls and Eastﬂelena. ‘

need of the strikers, the com-
munity ‘ »tg9,l§,,,,11pon.~.-itself a

after the settlement:

“This struggle has been his-
toric. It has been a substantial
challenge to the company's
domination and the only one
for many years which ln--
volved not only the union, but
the entire state. This strike
victory is more than a satis-
factory agreement for the
union and, its membership. It
is a victory for all of Montana.
and will pay many dividends
