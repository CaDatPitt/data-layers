_ ,T'ORONTO'—-Meeting in emergency ses-
 sion-here last week, the Canadian Mine-“Mill

' lay-offsiin the base metals industry resulted

' ”' in large measure"-from government policies
which choked off trade with important

‘ ‘cou”ntries of the world. i  S

_ Other factors, the Council said, have
7  it been the monopoly control of the industry,
a [development by the monopoly corporations
» of foreign properties operated with low-wage

1‘. X"-_jlabor which are displacing Canadianand U.S. ‘

’  production, and military stockpiling which
7 g f : created artificial shortages and gave bonanza

ii ' ‘profits to the monopolies. With‘ the ending of ,

stockpiling, prices have dropped , and many
‘i v_ small operations‘ have been forced tofclose

E-3  down, leaving ghost towns and ruined, com— .

on Mine-Mill jobs programi

Greetings for a “prosperous New Year” sounded somewhat lhol
low last‘ week to Mine-Mill members in many sections of the non
ferrous metals and allied industries. 0
markets, continued threats of layoffs and cutbacks, and a genera
pessimism about future conditions in. the industry existed in man.
On the positive side, however, Mine-Mill local unions and :members.
were fighting back. Armed with the four-point program- to prevenV‘_
depression in the industry, together with -additional ammunition stem’
ming from four area leadership conferences, Mine-Mill locals wer
beginning to engage in an intensive political action and organizationa-
“crusade against unemployment -and depression.” ’ ' --

 CLI N T   l E    

 

On January 11, the trial of Clinton Jencks will open at El Paso,

Jencks, now a Mine-Mill International Representative, was

president of Bayard, N. M., Local 890 at the time he signed a Taft-
Hartley .non—ComInu'nist affidavit. ’° He is accused now of p'erjury in

connection with the affidavit.

~ The reaction of Local 890 was swift and decisive. In a meeting
that voted all—out support for the defense, a resolution was adopted
declaring _the indictment a frameup. It said: ' _ -

“This attack on Brother Jencks has the purpose of destroying
everything we have gained through our union in the past 20 years.
We will fight against it with all the ‘strength we have.”

The International Union convention last September voted support
for the Jencks defense‘ “all theway to the Supreme Court if neces-

’ sary.” It pledged “every resource of our union” for the defense of
Jencks “a.nd any other_ of our members simila.rly indicted.”

FOR OUR MEMBERS at Bayard,
.the frame-up nature “of this case was
too"obvious for doubt. They had lived
.through hard-fought strikes, including
the 15-month Empire Zinc strike. They

I had seen the employers fighting furi-

ously, bending every agency of govern-
ment to their control, his desperate
effort to hold their dictatorial control

of the peopleof Grant, County, N. M. '

They had. seen J encks, along with hun-
U dreds-"o_t'_other union members, their
‘ wives and children, jailed for walking
.12. picket line.

Before that, they had seen the grow-

.- ing wrath of the bosses against Jencks. ‘

as he helped weld unity of the workers
in the county, set up a’steward- struc-
.tnre and fought every inch of the way
.on grievances.‘ U

Clint Jencks was a pillar ‘of strength
to the union people of Grant County,
and it followed as night follows day
that he would be framed. .

 . .wHEN THE PEOPLE of Local 890

undertook tomake a movie tellin_g—the
story of their Empire, Zinc strike, they
saw the most savage attack madeto
stop them, including use of the-federal
immigration service to arrest a distin-
guished actress of Mexico, offering to
release her if she would promise not
to continue work on the‘ Mine-Mill film
“Salt of the Earth.”

Just a month before Jencks’ indict-
ment last April, Richard C. Berresford
of New Jersey Zinc appeared" before a
Coiigiressioiiial ‘Committee in Washing-
ton to ask the government to help "his

-company remov_e union officers who

were giving “imp/1/'oper” leadership."
Attorneys E. B. Elfers of El-Paso
and John T.. McT,ernan, of Los Angeles
are hahdling the Jencks defense, in
consultation with Mine—Mill General

"Counsel Nathan Witt.

News bulletins reporting the prog-

ress of the trial will be,sen-t to all local-

unions from" the International Office.

’ You can hardly pick up a newspaper

these days without ‘reading about the .-

indictment of some labor leader.

have been and are now being fought‘ in

the courts includes the perjury fra.me- *

, man of the United Electrical Workers,

Union, «Gold of the ‘Fur & Leather

_ SUCH ATTACKS on! unions-tliroug-h
frameup charges, indictment and con-

viction of their leaders are not . just .-

a new and current by—product' of the
present day ‘McCarthy—Velde-Jenner-

Butler—Brownell hysteria against so-

called “reds in unions.” The history
of the labor movement in America is

2, _ -' full of classicavl examples of labor

frameups, i.n which va.rious ,levels of
’g<;vernment—federal, state and local
,_—-‘cooperated hand-in_-glove with em-
. ployers to assault unionsby trying and
in many cases succeeding in sending
their leaders to jail and even death.
MINE-MILL’S own rich‘ history,
from the Union’s very inception in‘
1893 as the Western Federation of
Miners, is studded with famous cases
of such frameups against leaders of
our o1'gani7.ation by the _mining corpo-
rations with .the active cooperation of

federal, state and local agencies. While '

there are dozens that could be re-
counted, not least of these Mine-Mill
cases made famous in labor history
w e r e the V Haywood—Moyer-Pettibone
case, the Ducktown case andfthe Paul
'Corcora.1; frame-up _ in the
- d’Al‘enes. The Corcoran case was es-
pecially revealing. ‘
'l‘he.‘frame_-up of Corcoran in 1899,
six years after the birth of‘ the West-
ern Federation, was carried out not
only to prevent organization of the
Bunker Hill & Sullivan Company and
Last Chance mines, but to smash the
new union in the Coeur d’Alenes.
Theunorgaiiized miners at Bunker

Coeur U

-. Ilill a.ndLast Chance were getting 50 _

cents a day less than the union men
at the other-mines‘ in the area, and the
energies of the union, as Big Bil1,Hay-

wood tells in his book, were directed

c   FRAM   

“to bringing the lower paid miners up I

to the higher paid standard.’-’ A strike. 1'

was called. = . . .
SEVERAL DAYS“after the ‘strike
began, the Bunker*Hill mill was blown

up. In his‘book,'Hay'-wood says: “It was

shown that; the m‘inin‘g company was
responsible for the damage.” And Job
Harriman, a,,ne\vsp,ape.r1iian ‘who wrote

a lengthy pamphlet on the 1899’ strug'- ’

gle in the Coeur d’Alenes,»found many

.. lproofsthat Joseph McDonald, owner of

the rival Frisco. mine,’ajnd possibly the
Bunker Hill &- Sullivan inanager‘him-
self, were .in on-theplan to blow up
the mill.  - . ‘

Only one manjwas ‘ever tried for

conspiracy in ‘the explosion case, Paul

Corcoran, financial secretary_of' the
Burke Miners"-Union. Corcoran was

‘framed and sentenced to 17 years.

-«THE Miivnnsi unions in the‘.-Coeur

than a month after our Union had launched ‘its cam-

emergency in the lead and zinc industries. Nor is it

cluding copper. ‘ '

I find it convenient to have a “litt1e,depression”—and
' they are cold to the thousands" who are already job-

less and the whole communities which are rapidly be-

coming ghost towns. These corporations see only a

new opportunity to tighten their monopoly control of
the industry, speezing out hundreds of little operators.

other attacks on our Union, to company-un_ionize us

This is the background against. which the trial of

By ELI I-IILL

I Eli Hill, a ‘member of Butte Miners Union. Local l, was present at the De-
cember 27 meeting and moved to refer the motion for secession to a referendum

vote. His motion was ruled out of order.

He is the man who gets the rock,‘
» His head, a solid wooden block; ‘

He cares not what he gets for pay

As long as he can sweat all day.

He says, "I am a highball man,
__Try and beat me if you can!

I'll timber up and drill my round;
_ I'm not the type to loaf around."

“And if I do not make 'er pay,

"At least theboss will.like my way;
I'll quit my» job and takemy check
And ﬁnd another boss, by heck!"

Oh yes, he'll ﬁnd another boss,

:But just another double cross;

He'll muck and scrabble, moil with greed,
The paragon of the hoosicIr’s creed.

You'll ﬁndchim in a gassy drift;
He sweats" and curses all the shift;
And when he cannot make 'cr pay,
To shifter,,he will quickly say:

"Another heading would pay more,

If not, then given me three or four."
He has the headingyall alone,

His pardi, a muckpile all his own. ..

They only see each other when

They're going down, or up again;

And through the shift they'll chance to meet
If they should take the time to eat.

You'll also find him in’ a raise
A-drilling in an oily haze;

His head is full of rotgut booze
To lubt‘icate—thc loosened screws.

Hispard is hoisting down below
The timber up,‘how? I don't know;

' H_e's climbingup and down pop-eyed-_ _

Releasing cable from the slide.

He's cussing ladders and ragged. slides,
So mad he'll bust his blank insides;
His pard above with aibuzzy and

A lettuce sandwich in one hand.‘

And twenty ﬂoors above the sill
You'll find the same old scissorbill;
He's slaving there, the simple dope,
To make the cubes in’ a narrow stope.

He timbers alone, this Mighty Mouse;
His pard has gone to the powderhouse;
They're going to make ’er pay today;
They're going to blast in mid of clay.

The highball gyppo's the type of man,
Who'll give foribosses all he can;

* It's lots of work ‘and not much pay
For what he's done_ at the length of day.

But Saturday he'll shout and laugh,

‘"I made a ringer, it's time and a half!" ,
Oh, hark! to the jackass and hear him bray,
‘He won't admit ‘it's sellout pay.

He'll break conditions everywhere,

Which Labor sought and put them there;
For WORK is all that's in his head,

_.The poor dimwit would be better-off dead.

‘He's loved by bosses and scorned by men,

_ The highball gyppo, uncouth specimen;
His union duties he will connive, .
I grieve for the bread that keeps him alive.

He'll curse the-nippers and motormen;
He’: always down on his fellow men;
He sneaks‘ around. like some grisly ghoul
To pounce upon some neighbor's tool.

I .

He mines in his sleep and mines when he
‘dines; V _

He mines at the bar with his‘ beers and "
wines; .

You'll seldom see him at the Hall,

Because he has no guts at all.

A union to him iswhere to pay dues;

A looming strike will give him the blues; .
You won't see him, on a picket line,

He'd rather be slaving in the mine. '

He is the man who gets the rock,

To fill the piles of surplus stock;

But when he's one of the idle mob,
‘He's first to moan, “I'm out of a jawb!"

THE AMERICAN people will be wise to [reserve judgment

as 3. Wave of political hysteria sweeps across the nation. Work-_,

ers and farmers will need cool heads and calm judgment as 7].

they see the McCarthys, the Vqldes, the Jenners and the At-

torney General compete for the biggest headlines with -sub-

penas ‘and irrespgnsible, partisan charges. ,
It is extremely important to remember that this is a

political fight-—,on the lowest possible level. It is a, smoke.  
screen to cover up the miserable record of the Republican party 
_,which the majority of the voters ‘in recent electionsphas re.-

jected as unsatisfactory.

The Republican “high command has decided that Mc; ti

Carthyism can win elections and this is the. opening, gun
the ‘campaign to wi-n the Congressional elections in 1954. 

THE OBJECT of‘ the personal attack on former President Truman-'7  y

is not to catch communists or fight communism. It is‘ impossible to put
dead men in jail or convict suspected communists long out of government‘
service who cannot be compelled to testify.agains.t themselves.

It is ridiculous to charge Harry S. Truman of being soft towa-rdi
communism. Was the Berlin airlift softness toward communism? Was‘

helping Greece drive communists outvof it that country being soft towa-rd.  A

communists ? , c -

A Was the Truman" doctrine of containment of communisni—a land~ 
mark in world history—softness to,'the dictator in the. Kremlin?

Was the Marshall Plan which gave billions of dollars to build up the , ~.

economies of our Allies softness to communism? Was the use of force

-of arms. in Korea, which halted communist aggression, softness toward-

communism? Could putting the eleven top communist leaders in this
country behind prison bars and weeding out hundreds of persons; in gov-‘ -

ernment service suspected of communist sympathies be called softness  A‘

toward communism?_ .

"Since the end"of the war no man in the whole-world has done more
to" fight communism than Harry S. Truman. . . . " -

IT WILL BE WELL to remember that the type of men most active '_
in the present smear campaign were among those who thought we could i

do business with ;Hitler'fand- who approved Hit1‘er’s method of handling

' German workingmen. They are, to speak plainly and this is a time for

plain speaking, incipient American fascists and they will stop at noth-
ing to accomplish their purpose., l ‘ ‘ ~

It was no accident that .Truman’ w-as the immediate target of the’
-present drive to- arouse the emotions of the American people and to fo-
ment hate, anger and distrust" of two former presidents wh_o,.through pro-

history. _ . c , A V _,
Reactionaries themselves recognize this fact, through their propaganda.

which accused the two Democratic administrations of coddling labor and W 

of buying farm votes by farm price supports. _ ‘ '

while expansion of industry and profits reacl1edunp1*ecedented heights: , A ’ A
V‘ The phony patriots, now braying in public placesabout, their ltough-—" '

pressive record to bolster that claim. Members of thewpartyi now in

power were the nation’s prize softies when it came to voting appropria-~ /

tions ‘to fight communism. It is a matter _of fact that the Jenners- and
the Yeldes deserted their own party leaderfon-appropriaions for ‘foreign

' ._aid‘ to fight communism and President Eisenhower actually had to depend‘ —'

on Democrats, now being calledsoft towards communism, to- passthe
