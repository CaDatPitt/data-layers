growing out of the attitude of‘ the A'.M.A. which is

here when members of East Helena Mill

Disgusted by the Steel failure

resulted in a. three—to-one,.,de- -.

Counter-attack HVS. llll3l3_3l't]lyiSln

EVIDENCE of the peo-
p1e’s s prea din g counter-
attack against McCarthy-
ism was noted by Mine-Mill
local unions in Montana
this month. ‘From Butte
and Hamilton came denun-
ciations of McCarthy and
his big lie program which
reflect»how"the fight
against the Wisconsin sen-
ator’s pro-fascist ‘forces is
no longerthe private prop-
erty of a fewmilitant un-
ions, but is embracing
forces within the Republi-
can party and other con-
servatives. .
V, In Butte, an important
Republican attorney, Rob-
ert Poore, told the Butte
Rotary Club that “there is
no more dangerous phrase
‘today in the United States
than ‘I like what. Senator

' McCarthy is doing, but ’.”

Mr. ‘Poore centered his attack
on McCarthy’s use of the
phrase “Fifth Amendment
Communist” in describing per-

_sons who use the U. S._ Co’nsti- .

tution to prevent their being

‘framed by McCarthy and other.

investigating witch-hunters.

Defines 5th.AmenclmentV ,

In .defining the ‘Fifth
Amendment, Mr; ’ Poore"? said:
“It is {in two parts. “The first
guarantees that a person is not

required’ to be awitness against '

himself. The second is that he
shall not be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due
process of law.”

Pointing out i that the first

document in the Montana code
is the Magna Carta‘of 1215,
‘wrung from King John by his
baﬁons at‘ Runnymead,. Mr._
Poore said: “That is the first
appearance of the phrase ‘with-
out due process of law’ which
appears in our Fifth Amend-
' ment. We" are heirs of the Eng-
llsh concept of laws. 
“In the Declaration of Inde-
pendence it clearly states that

Miners Union No. 1 celebrated.

its 76th birthday on Monday,
June 14, with the annual com-
munity celebration of Miners
Union Day at Columbia Gar-
dens. ‘

Miners Union Day in Butte is
observed by the entire city.

‘Stores are closed, craft work- _
, ers as well as the miners have
/ the day off as a ‘holiday.V,A full

day’s festivities for all‘ mem-
bersftf the family‘ mark the
day every year.

Miners" Union Day\this year"

began with a first aid contest
at Columbia Gardens. The team

tinued. “Our laws are refined
by the : fires of. violent revolu-
tion.

Star Chamber
“How close are we getting Vto
the Star Chamber when the ac-

cused is refused counsel, re-‘

fuses to testify and is found
guilt_y?_' Senator McCarthy
makes the -inference of guilt
when a"perso'n invokes our most
fundamental liberty; the , Fifth
Amendment. A subcommittee

’is not a court, where the ac-
cused may be tried, but it is a,

group where issues can be
pressed until the. committee
reaches _a conclusion. or is satis-
fied with the‘ information. '
.“You , are not entitled to
counsel in a Senate subcom-

mittee hearing and. I believe '
