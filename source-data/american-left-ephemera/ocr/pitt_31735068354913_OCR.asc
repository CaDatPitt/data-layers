, - X ' -, By John Clark T A »
HERE is America going? That’s the question that should be
-1 haunting all of us these days, as we see the simplest liberties of

I I_ our people tl11*eatened or boldly snatched away. '

Maybe we get "case-hardened to all of it, because
' the attacks are usually on individuals, rather than
groups-—and the individuals frequently are some
place else, far away. ‘ ‘

Until a case like that of Bill Lanko comes along.

Thousands of members of this 'union know Bill
Lanko personally. Not just those in his own local
in Torrington, the ABC Local 423 which he helped
to organize back in 1937. But members of all the
._ ABC locals, all the Anaconda locals. Indeed members
, V ' ’ of. practically every Mi'ne-Mill local, sin'ce Bill

’ . attended every Mine-Mill convention from 1939 to 1946.

BILL IS KNOWN and loved'by every worker who ever came into.
contactwith him. In Torrin'gton, over the years he became a tower
of strength in boththe union and the plant. He led the fightagainst
the traitorous Driscollsecession movement in 1947, the fight that was
so successful that the Company had to recognize Mine-Mill without,
attempting" to force an NLRB election. '

er 3,500 new

President Trurndn‘«

terror against "Ne-A
groes‘ in Florida;

H ‘Coclocmut clay’, in"T rcrili

Bill ;is Mine-Mill, through and-_ through. c I 

 But now the Immigration Service and the FBI have grabbed Bill
Lanko and taken the first steps aimed at sending him out of the

= country-forever.

It’s typical of the FBI that- they chose the birthday of Abe Lincoln
to do this bit of dirty work. It was Lincoln who said: “Our reliance is
in the love of liberty; our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty,
as the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere. Destroy this spirit

41, I’ and we have planted the seeds of despotism at our own doors. Those

who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and cannot

long, retain it.” . -

And what was the “charge” they brought against Bill Lanko?

Membership in an organization which the McCarran Law says foreign-

born Americans cannot join. This kind of McCarran logic takes no

' account of the fact Bill Lanko has been a loyal American for forty

years. '

THEY IGNORE thelmost, important facts of all. They try to
wipe from mind the fact that Bill has been a machinist for 32 years

in the Torrington ABC plant.‘ The fact that his wife, Helen, was born

-in Bridgeport. The fact that Bill and Helen have six children—four

. girls and two boys. The fact that both of 'Bill’s son's;serve_d ‘inlthe
armed forces in World War II, one in the Army, the other on a Navy

I ' grandchildren.

 ' " Illegal membership indeed! What shocking, brutal nonsense! I
“ And it becomes even more brutal when you find out that Bill has

submarine. The fact that Bill and H

-« been .in ill health for more than three /years now, under the dbctor’s

care constantly for heart trouble which cans

for many months‘ in 1949-50.

 ‘ . Where is America going? I say it’s t_ime'for'us to say: “HALTl”

. to this dangerous stupidity. I say that we of Mine-Mill have a special

g obligation, a duty, to fight the case of Bill Lari-ko through to the
highest courts in the land, if necessary.  ‘ '

. Where do We begin? An avalanche of postcards letters, resolu-

trons tovthe U.*S. Immigration Service, Hartford, Connecticut, should

make a good starter. Tell ’em to let Bill Lanko go free-—at -once. Tell

v ., ’em you know that there is only one reason why they are persecuting
B1ll——the fact that he is amilitant, solidr member of our union. 1

This is one on which we’ve got to really go to the mat.

Lanko 1-hanks officers
for promise of help

DENVER-——The  four International
officers of Mine-Mill got a letter late
last week from Bill Lanko, member
of Torrington Local 423. The letter
speaks for itself:

“I received your telegram regarding

my arrest on deportationcha-rges on _

Monday morning. It warms my heart
to know that my brothers in the labor

movement have considered-me worthy

of their help and support.

“What has happened to me could
happen to any loyal union man who
opposes raiders and union-busters.

“I give you my solemn word, that
I shall continue in the future as I have
in the past—to serve my fcllow—work-
ers to the best of my ability. I feel
so much better now that I know I will

not have to fight this thing alone and ,

unaided. You can ‘imagine how I fel
when the arrest was made. T .

“So from the bottom of my heart
and also from Mrs. ‘Lanko, thank you,
brothers, for everything. With warm-

est regards to you all, Sincerely and‘

fraternally, 'William P. Lanko."

elen have five American-born

ed him to be hospitalized

By'E. l. Walker
Financial secretary, Local 480 ,

‘TRAIL, B. C.——Mine-Mill Local cele-
brated its annual Cocoanut Day here
Friday, February 8, with a special

meeting and dance in the, Canadian,

Legion Hall.

There may be some who-don’t know
what Cocoanﬁt Day means in Trail, so
here’s the explanation:

On February 8, 1950, the former of-

ficers of Local 480, having carefully

maneuvered ‘themselves into position,
walked out in body, handed the keysgfo
Int’l rep. John Gordon, and joined

United Steelworkers, with the inten-- --

tion of taking over our ~certification
lock, ‘stock and barrel for Steel.‘

THE TRAITORS ‘included officers,
chief stewards, sho_p stewards, the
whole caboodle with the exception’ of
Brother Dan Dosen, our No. 1 mem-
ber and chief steward for the smelter
area. Local 480 was finished—that was
their story- I .

Regional director ‘Harvey Murphy,

9 B. C. district union secretary Dave Mc- '

Geeand Kay Erickson flew in imme-
diately from Vancouver, bringing a
typewriter and mimeographing ma-
chine, expecting _to have to set up an

qffice ‘in some hotel room and start ‘

to rebuild Local 480. I .

“Bulletin Bill” Longridge flew in
from Calgary and his nickname is a
tribute from our membership, who for
weeks and months "never entered the
office night or day withoutfinding Bill
pounding out a leaflet or radio speech.
He’s been trying to catch up on sleep
ever since. '

A meeting was called in the Cana-
dian Legion Hall on February 10, and
lo and behold! Brother Murphy found
that Local 480 was still very much
‘alive. They packed the hall "until. Har-

vey was almost forced off the plat- A

form. r‘ A
Nominations were called and for
lack of space, all nominees were

ordered to the restroom with instruc-
tions, to soijt themselves out "and bring
back a président, whichnwas ‘done in
about 10 minutes, Al King being the
unanimous choiceof the nominees.
THE SAME procedure was» followed
-with the other offices, so that we have
come to call itrthe Rest House Election.
Shop stewards were appointed, andthe

first executive was held after midnight. .

Local 480 was on its way. Members of
the Kimberley local came over ‘in full
support and Brother Eccleston, first
sang the “Cocoanut Song” with the

wording changed to suit the occasion.‘
1 So, in remembrance of that day

which saw the rebirth of a fighting
militant union, "following an abortive
“Blitz”——which fizzled out like a damp
firecracker—we all it “Cocoanut Day”.
A special meeting and dance is always

held in that same Canadian Legion

Hall on Febriiary 8th, 9th, or'10t'h, all
three being very significant dates-

V The speakers at this year’s celebra- V

tion were Nels Thibault, our newly
initiated executive board member for
'Dis_trict.No. 8; C. S. Jackson, Canadian
president of the United" Electrical
Workers; Chase Powers, executive
board member for”DistrictINo. 7; Re-
gional director Harvey Murphy; Int’l
rep. ' Martin Walsh; with Brother Al
King in the chair. '

' ‘ CIGARET LIGHTERS bearing the

J‘ T -, ‘-

- Mine-Mill seal were presented to ,Frank jg?" ‘ s
Barnes,’ for the greatest number-I'ofg
cards signed in a month; Marie Fitz-2 ’
patrick, for the greatest number, of "
Auxiliary membership cards signed in 
a month; Al Warrington, for service
in organizing bulletin» ,distributi'on';"
Martin Walsh, for services as .chair-
man of the shop stewards;I,“7Stevej.
Lewis, retiring on a pension; and
Stott, also retiring on pensio . » «:2

Harvey Murphy then presented‘ Wil*
liam Cunningham with an _engraved
Hamilton gold pocket watch. , The
presentation was made in recognition,
of the fact that Brother Cunningham‘
w‘as,na charter member of this "locals"
an untiring worker since our orgzinizlii-A
tion in 1939, and a trade unionistev_er_.
since he took his obligation‘ as aI1..a' ‘

_ ‘prentice in England in 1907. 7 ‘p '

As visible evidence of the success ‘of
480 since the “Blitz,” Brother Al  ,
as president of the Trail Labour ‘Centre’
Building'VCo.~, Ltd. produced tl1e7,n'o.t
from the Bank of Montreal, _-bearirf
over thirty signatures .of men who ha
faith inthe futureof organized-I ‘labou -7

pledged themselves as suretiesrfo"”'

which to help in the purchase of a ‘La

  Peace holds top spot
in headlineliit parade

The “headline hunt” sponsored by
THE UNION slowed down since the
last issue of our paper, but world peace

' still held the top spot in the headline

hit parade. , _

E. N. Gibbs of Local 415 in Carlsbad,
N. M., proposed this brief, all-embrac-
ing head: “THE WORLD AT PEACE
ONCE MORE.” _ A

Inar Larson of Local 392 in Magna,
Utah, suggested: “KOREA TREATY
SIGNED, WORLD AT PEACE

’ AGAIN.”,

Bryant Kelly of Local 867 in Jackson,
wanted to indicate the
close tie-up between civil rights and
peace, so he proposed: “CIVIL RIGHTS
MUST BE GIVEN TO ALL MEN, RE-
GARDLESS OF RACE, CREED OR.
COLOR, NO WORLD PEACE WITH-
OUT IT.”

Anthony Lemnert of Local 537 in
Buffalo, N. Y., alsomade it clear that
he wants peace, plus. Lennert sug-
gested: “PEACE THROUGHOUT THE,
WHOLE WORLD, WSB ABOLISHED,
FREE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

ABROUGHT BACK, FAIR EMPLOY-
MENT

PRACTICES TO ALL PEO-
PLE, NEGRO AND WHITE UNITY
WON, TAFT-HARTLEY LAW DE-
FEATED.” ‘

Earl Hodges of Local 266 in Rich-

mond, Calif., boiled his headline down .

to two ‘simple words which.told a lot:
“WORLD,PEACE.” . A '

From R. R. ‘Graves of the East
Helena Smeltermen’s Union, Local 72,
this ‘most "wanted headline":

CIO director in Hawaii for the last 18
months, has announced that CIO or-

ordered him to close up the office and‘

Eslcovitz came out here shortly after
the 4Marine Cooksand Int’! Longshore-
men’s & Warehousemen’s unions had
been expelled from CIO. But he was
completely unsuccessful inraiding eith-
er union. His recall is interpreted as

an admission of failure on the part of

CIO. He said the decision was based
on “lack organizational possibilities in
the foreseeable future.” ‘

NLRB sets elec-I-ions
in Morenci. Bessemer

Mine—Mill locals were preparing for
two more NLRB representation elec-
tions last week, one in the deep South,
the other in the Southwest.

Workers at the Edwards and Spauld-
ing mines of Republic Steel Company,
Bessemer, Alabama were set to go to
the polls February 26, in an election
brought on by CIO Steel raiders. The
two Mine-Milllocals involved are Local

A 121 and 556. ,

Workers in the various crafts at the
P-D operation in Morenci, Arizona,

were to vote February 28 on whether b

they will remain split up in various AA
AFL craft unions, or go into Mine-

Mill Local 616, which already lbargains
for all the production workers.

\

dian chairman of the Mine-Mill Auxil-
iaries, showedhow she thinks changes

given more chancein government. Her
proposed headline said‘: “WOMEN

Terror wins again
for Steel union

BESSEMER, Ala.——Terrorism paid’

offionce more for the CIO Steelwork-
ers’ Dixiecrat wing here on Feb. 7 when

Mine-Mill lost a 2363 to 1371 decision .
in an NLRB election at the mines,’

quarry and sintering plant of the Ten-
nessee Coal, Iron and Railroad division
of the U. S. Steel’ Corporation.‘

‘As was the ‘case almost three years
ago when CIO Steel raided Mine-Mill

 at TCI, the vote in the February" 7th

election was almost entirely on racial
lines. The Ku Klux Klan elements

, amollg the voters again were success-

a during the campaign.

ful in frightening-the majority of white
workers into voting for Steel ‘on the
grounds that Mille-Mill’s appeals for
Negro-white Aunity on; Red Mountain
would destroy the Southern tradition
of white supremacy.

Also reminiscent‘ of the campaign in
1949, the terror of the George Elliott
gang was directed at white workers.

The latter were told that NLRB and...
Mine-Mill emphasis on the fact that «

the election was by secret ballot was a

Communist trick. White workers were,
told that the Klan would know how’

theyvoted and that any white worker
who voted for Mine—Mill would be driv-
en out of town. George Elliott is the
hoodlum responsible for Mine-Mill's
ASe‘cre~tary-Treasurer M. E. Travis los-
lng an eye in a, gang attack in the TCI
campaign of 1949. He is now an in-
ternationalv representative for CIO
Steel.

DYNAMITE was thrown at the
home of one white Mine-Mill supporter
Others were
threatened on the telephone. On one
occasion, Mine-Mill's office was brok-
en into by vandals and its equipment
and records damaged. On another, a
nitro-g-lycerine_ bomb was thrown at
the_ office but exploded before‘ it
reached the building. Bricks and oth-
er objects were thrown» throughtthe
office windows constantly. '

VANCOUVER, B. ‘C.-Paul’Robeson
will sing for Canadian and U. S. trade ,
unionists at a huge rally" which now
has been definitely scheduled for May
'18. The open air concert will be held
at the Peace Archat Blaine, the border
town where U. S. and Canada meet.
Robeson’s May’ 18 ‘appearance was
announced by. Mine-Mill regional direc-
tor Harvey Murphy, ‘who had arranged
the recent rally in ‘Vancouver which“-
Robeson’ was prevented from attending
by U. S. officials. '
There i a public park at the Peace.
Arch which has been-designated_inter-
‘national property. It is here that "Robe-
son will a pear,"and it is expected that
thousands of workers and their wives
will come from both Vancouver, B. C.
and Seattle-Tacoma,’ Washington," to
hear the concert. -
MEANTIME, the Portland ,,,Oregon-
ian sharply rebuked what is called
“High handedlborder police” who forced _
Robeson ctorelnain in the U. S., de-
claring that “U. S. immigration au-A
thorities acted both arbitrarily and un-
Wisely.” A
“Who is to determine what is ‘in the .
interest of the government’, the’con-
servative Oregonian asks. “The immi-
gration service, presumably. That is
high-handed action indeed.” . '9“
How far U. S.Aimlnigration officials
are prepared to go in upho‘ding the
“iron curtain” between the two coun-
tries was dramatically illustrated with
news that it'had refused to ; rmit six '
members of the Toronto Symphony.Or-
chestra to cross for a concert in‘ De-
troit. _ . .

mented: “Music is supposed to ‘be. an.

J. R. BLACKWELL, Mine—Mill"
member in‘the Couer d’A1enes, sent_,a.~ ‘
letter to the editorial department of
the Spokane Review, declaring. that
“Paul Robeson has not ceasedto be a
great American simply because he en-
listed-in the fight against mceudis-I

crimination and the tragic hunliliation,  up
of ten‘ million Negro Americans and 

other minority ' groups.

“Had Paul URobeson winked ‘at_ the I I it

tionaloBank crowd,-and the Cowles newspaper
chain,_ the owners, of the Minneapolis Star

and Tribune. The Cowles press in Minnesota

has never attacked Humphrey. The Star and
Tribune joined’ with the Junior Chamber of
Commerce to name Humphrey “the outstand-
ing Minneapolitan of_1.945 and" Man of th__e
Year ‘in Minnesota and outstanding Young
Man of the .Year in the state.”

Humphrey effectively consolidated his
support ‘during his first term as mayor of

. “Cereal: City.” His wasa masterful job of

fence-building» and expedient deals, He was

‘yet to be exposed before the nation’s workers,

as their enemy. So he tailored for himself a
flashy cloak‘ of “labor” support. Wheaties and

other industrial giants in Minnesota were un-

Dixie won't have to worry.-

iworried. They gave him even greater support
1 when he ran for and won re-election in 1947.

“Most remarkable, perhaps, the had won
the confidence of a large number of business

and industrial leaders who .had once been

frankly suspiciousaof his labor backing.”
HE “volunteer committee” for the r.e-elec-

tion of Humphrey included some‘ very "
questionable “labor” “ backers, _the president of
the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, and.

such executives as Samuel C. Gale, vice-presi-
dent of "General Mills; Alfred M. Wilson, vice-
president‘ of the Minneapolis-Honeywell Co.;
Bradshaw Mintener, vice—president and gen-

- eral counsel of-Pillsbury Mills, Inc., and David

J. Winton, lumber baron. The anti-labor
Covtles press went all out for Humphrey.

Humphrey’s so-called “labor” support is

worth mentioning here. His chief labor front

man is'i"Robert Wishart who led a succession
movement from the independent United Elec-
trical Workers *(UE)» into Jim Carey’s IUE.
Wishart climbed fast in C10 circles, even be-
coming regional director. He isbusiness agent
of the Minneapolis-Honeywell Local 1145,
IUE, -and chairman of the Hennepin County
C10" Council. Oddly, Wishart is not too fond

‘ of Carey; he has told more than one politico

in Minneapolis and St. Paul that he’d like to
take his membersinto the AFL.

Wishart’s brand of trade uhionism re-
ceived considerable publicity in August of
1950 when the Minneapolis Star carried‘a

. .;feature story on ’Wishart’s secret-police com-

,.

niittee at Minneapolis-Honeywell. The com-

I ,

Of his first. term as.mayor,‘'Survey-Graphic 1,
' said: ‘ ’ »

rnittee was an official‘ stool pigeon outfit’ de- 

signed to help the company -weed"out’any
Workers who were “too militant.” The com-
mittee’s method of operation were reminiscent
of the infamous Burns and Pinkerton detec-
tive agencies. To quote the Star:

“. . . they chatted casually withnew em-
ployeesf They took the’ newcomers to union
meetings, drewrthem into discussions of union
and political affairs, asked their views on
various issues.”

Describing the committee, the Star said:

“They are members of akspecialiunit de-
signed to detect, eacpose‘and closely watch
Communists AND PERSONS OF LESSE

SHADES or RED.” -

The person of a ‘‘lesser shade of red” is
described by the‘Star as follows:-..

“He might merely comment on the terrible
cost, in men and war goods, of the interven-
tion in Korea, and "follow that up talking
about the impact of the Korean war on
American domestic economy, and how the
working man is ‘caught in the price rise
squeeze.” 1 ’

~ The“~= luckless complainant,.said the Star,

was reported to the company and either. fired, k

or prevented from working in certain depart-
ments! ’ ‘ ‘

Wis_hart’s alliance with Humphrey pro-
vides an insight into Hubert’s typical method
of political operation. Humphrey is a past-
master in the school of if-you’ve—got—a5hot-
potato — to_- handle -‘appoint—a-commission-or—a-

stooge. According to- the Associated Press in

a dispatch dated Jan. 31, 1947:

“He got swamped with complaints from
city employees, members of an AFL union.
So he put an AFL man on the civil service
commission. A CIO union had organized city
welfare workers. So ,Mayor Humphrey put a
010 man, (Wishart) on the Minneapolis wel-
fare board.”' ' ’

It is a matter of record that Wishart never
gave Humphrey -any trouble. Neither did the
city welfare workers. v

,, - _ , . . .

TYPICAL OF HUMPHREY’S labor sup-
port, also, was a character named Pat Whalen.
Whalen ‘came out of the‘ Teamsters union of
Chicago. He went’ to Minneapolis as an inter-
national representative for the Building Serv-

. ice Employees. Whalen organized bowling al- A
, ley, pin setters, pin ball machine collectors

and salesmen. . -

He told Minneapolis employers that he was
“always available to enforce a contract” and

\ if hisrvopposition [was too big he’d. use his
“persuader,’.’ a pistol whichlhe always carried ~

to demonstrate the Whalen "ideology of trade
unionism. ‘ A - x ..

Whalenbecameione of Humphrey’s closest 1
advisers. When Hubert ran for; mayor,_Whalen '
' was treasurer of the “Labor Finance Com-

mittee, for Humphrey.” He was cha_irma‘n"’of
the 11th Ward Democratic Farmer-Labor

 party,‘ the Minnesota versionof the Demo.-_

cratic ‘party. , - — ~

Humphrey’s' other main “liberal” ‘support
comes from the Americans for’ Democratic Ac-
tion, of which Senator Humphrey is national

vice—president. ADA is the outfit which “didn’t '

want Truman” in 1948 and pleaded with Gen-
eral Eisenhower. to run for.\presriden't.

The ADA has consistently allied itself
with the_Chamber of Commerce in Minne-

apolis on the political scene. The most note-V’
, wortliykexample of this was its support" of
. Humphre‘y’s “city charter reform.” The char-

ter “reform” advocated by Humphrey was to
have a smaller. city council and to give the

' mayor more power. The labor movement was‘

almost unanimous against these_ reforms and
had been, given; assurances before .~the elec-
tion that Humphrey would "not do anything
contrary to “labo’r’s- interests.” After the elec-
tion he told organized labor to go peddle its

.papers and went ahead” with his. program

backed by 'Big Business and the ADA. Twen-

‘ A ty.-‘four out of '26 councilmen opposed the plan.

Another Humphreydouble-cross of labor
was even more brazen. The word got around
during Humphrey’s first successful campaign
formayor that one Joseph Ryan, a cop no-
torious forhis anti-labor record, was being
conﬁdered for‘ police chief. »Labor queried

V Humphrey, urging him notto make such-1 an

obvious anti-union appointment. Hubert prom-
ised not to appoint Ryan. His first official act
as mayor was the appointment-of Ryan '

THE HUMPHREY RECORD is filled with
incidents of\ opposition to" or double-crossing
of labor. And it is consistently evasive \on
issues in which Minnesota unions have been
interested. It is difficult to find a single oc-
casion when Humphrey, withoutireservations,
allied" himself with trade unionists against
the ‘ employers. ’ e

Labor and other forces in: Minneapolis
made some inlsistentledemands for action to
relieve the city’s acute post-war housing short-
age. Real estéte. interests »and the industrial
taxpayers were against a housing program.

‘iThe issue grew hot with the»return of war
veterans "who could find no places to’ live.
Humphrey appointed a commission, and, the.

nature of‘ the commission was _su’éh“.t‘hat its

‘: .

    

‘ deliberations‘. were i..1.....a«o to -f.n....r ft:

‘the’ very beginning. The AFL ‘and’ C10-f we’;-g;
represented, but so weref—the‘.landlor‘d's, ethic,

realtors, big business, etc. And upon appoint-

ing the-commission, Humphrey demandedithat 

all decision be unanimous.

The commission labored, agreeing onprac-.

‘tically nothing. It drafted a weak-kneed re- 7:

port and Humphrey took to the air. His speech
had one ‘point. Minneapolitans , with: large
homes would please rent outrooms to _return-

ing GI’s.: This ended the housing program of.
,Mayor Humphrey and nothing elsehappened,

on the subject after that.

Another example of _Humphrey’s devious.
dealing with labor was his attitude toward.

the..candidacy oi-":»Congressman Roy W.'Wiér,

who‘ represents Minn'esota’s.Third District ‘in. - 
the House. Wier is a trade-unionist,’ an AFL ; 1

stagehand, who has been active in Minneapolis’-,

laborfnovement‘ since 1920. He was the repreg » 7 1

sentative of the Trades and Labor Assembly
of Minneapolis. AFL members “in” Minneapolis

complain .. that Humphrey -took-» a ‘typical 

“hands off” policy attitude. toward'3 Wier’s

candidacy in 1948 and there are son_1e.trade' '

unionists who’llvtell you that Humphrey didn’t

. want Wier elected. Atkany rate, Wier was not 
looked upon with favorby Humphrey’s politi- ',
cal backers, including. General Mills and other

industrialists. .

Humphrey gave labor another‘ double-cross

“When he nominated,-‘and supported, Edward. 
McKeever, attorneypfor the’ big lumber .com-  ‘H. .
panies, as state chairlnan of the Democratic- f

Farmer-Labor party. M_cKeever’s "record. was

1  I T Ju Cnova Show

  

- In our issue of January 14, we carried a feature calling attention to slander
of the Mexican people in the treatment of the character Pedro on the Judy Canova
radio show. We supported the campaign of the National Association of Mexican-
Americans for a boycott of products of the sponsor, the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet

Company.

We now are pleased to report that this company has discontinued its spon-
sorship. Judy Canova’s show now has no sponsor, but is carried by NBC as a
sustaining program. Protests against its content should be directed to your near-

est NBC radio station.

Two of the letters on this page com-A
menting on our boycott appeal took"

the position that the Judy Canova
show is guilty of nothing more than
“good natured kidding”‘that should be
answered by “another joke on the oth-
er fellow.”

THE WRITERS of these letters ap-
parently do not know that such “kid-
ding” has a direct relation to the eco-
nomic and social status of the Mexi-
can people in this country.

A report to Governor Thornton of
Golorado dated November 28, 1951,

1‘ based on a fieldstudy of aiyear and a

half by the National Child Labor Com-

A mittee, revealed the following shock-

ing facts: «
‘Of 262 families studied—

'——more than 200 children 7 to 16 years
of age were working full days (sun-
up to sundown) in the fields;

-—in. many cases these children are de-

'nie‘d schooling by those in authority
even when there is no field work;

-—average income per. family of 5.7
members, with both‘ parents and
children over '6 working, was $1,424;

—-“The conditions under which inter‘-

state migrants were transported by

truck were inhuman”;

-—“60 percent of families had no bath-
ing facilities”; “

-—“The poverty of migrants, the crowd-
ed and unsanitary conditions under
which they live and their inadequate
diet make serious health problems
inevitable”; ‘ ~

—-“Discrimination against migrants
was marked. It was evident in
schools, commercial recreation facili-
ties, restaurants, churches, law en-
forcement, and retail food stores
’which raised their prices for mi-
grants.”

gone on to include police brutality and
murder)’ means. tremendous super-
profits to the big canning, packing and
sugar companies. . . A
Slander of the Mexican people—of
their intelligence, their willingness to

their whole culture—is a part of the
system of exploitation. This, slander is

EVERY GROUP in history that has
been enslaved for the profit of another
group has been slandered as stupid,
childish, lazy, incapable of taking care
of -itself without the-watchful care of
the exploiter.

Whe_ther or not Judy Canova, NBC,
or any sponsor is awarepof these facts
does not alter the effect of what they
are doing. The use of a stereotyped,
clownish Mexican character’ on the

H show contributes to the lie about the

Mexican people——a lie that helps Great
Western Sugar Company pay dividends
on the sweat and toil of 7-year-old
boys and girls. i .

We again urge our readers to protest
to the National Broadcasting Com-
pany. - _

To the Editor:

Read the article in THE UNION ‘pa-
per about the Judy Canova show and
think you are all wrong, you know
what has made America strong is that

each of us can take a joke about our- .

selves and not take offense.

The Irish seem to have the most
about them, then Jews, Italians, Ger-
mans and in fact any nationality you
want to think of and every one takes it
in his stride and comes back with an“
other joke on the other fellow. '

That piece in your paper sounds very
much like" something Joe Stalin would
print to stir up trouble, have heard
several comments on this and it was
to the point that‘ we are still a free
country and can think and do as we

nesota about the newspaper accounts of an asassina-
tion attempt against Humphrey.

The Minneapolis papers of March 18, 1947, car-
ried a story about three shots having been fired at
the mayor as he entered his home on the night of
Feb". 6, more than a month before. He said he didn’t
His wife heard the shots. No

neighbors ha heard the shots. No signs of bullets

' were found. "Asked why he didn’t make the incident

is

t-.,-.,.‘

 

public earlier, Humphrey said modestly: “I didn’t
want. to talk about it.”

Humphrey’s record in Washington isthat of /an
ambitious man who would rather be President than
right. His voting record is very carefully planned.
Sometimes his vote is at variance with his deeds
off the Senate floor. His present campaign to worsen
the Taft—Hartley law .through amendments is typ-
ical. His voting record shows he voted right on
Taft-Hartley andsubsequent amendments. But his
actions since then in trying to “strengthen” the law
reveal him as an enemy of labor. , A V

THE PROCEDURE is reversed on issues affect-
ing the Negro people. He talks a good game, but

his voting record on Negro rights is one ‘of the

worstin the Senate. He voted against an amend-
ment to prohibit discrimination in public housing.
He voted wrong on an amendment to prohibit segre-
gation in education. He voted wrong onprohibiting
segregation in the army. _

Notorious among his “wrong” votes was his vote
on the McCarran Act. He also helped sponsor a
measure for concentration’camps..

 February 25. 1952  ' ’. »

 

Humphrey was the first of the so-called‘ “fair
dealers” to repudiate the health insurance program.
From a_ farm state, he has withheld his support of

the Brannan plan, designed to help small farmers. '

At the same time that he was demanding legis-
lation to make the Taft-Hartley law tougherfor
labor unions, Humphrey appeared in Minnesota’s
iron range to address a group of miners. In that

speech he called the Taft-Hartley act discriminatory, ~

and attacked it valiantly.

I-I'is d_ou‘b1e-talking on hotppolitical issues‘also
was demonstrated when he was interviewed by Prot-
estant churchmen on the Truman proposal to name
an ambassador to the Vatican. Humphrey’s answer
was a masterpiece in equivocation. He. said in effect:
“At the, moment I am against naming such an
envoy, but, if upon my return to Washington I
learn some compelling reasons to appoint the_ am-
bassador I may change my position.”

“ANOTHER CUTE Humphrey stunt was to lay

low on’ civil rights legislation until Congress ad- .

journed. Then.as a parting shot, while embarking
for Europe, he made a strong pitch for a civil rights
measure. ‘ 4

Sometimes the Humphrey method of operation

is even more devious and sleight-of-hand. He in-
troduced an anti-lynch bill, then hit the papers and
the wire services with a challenge to the southern
poll taxers to oppose the bill. He obviously had no

:1 intention of winning support with such belligerent

tactics. And he failed to do any of the things_ neces-
sary for a senator to get a bill passed.

And just in case there were fighters’ for Negro
rights who were pleased with Humphreyis intro-

Tlhe story of what was left out

Month.

 
 

 . By Herman Schendel

N THE first days of July in the year 1776,
jar young man sat in a hall in Philadelphia,
riting. And as he wrote, he took time out
swat the horseflies biting his legs. .But
he “heat and flies were no great bother, for
was workingat a labor of love. He was
iting a declaration of human rights.

Theyghad told him, the other men gath-
~ered_' there with him-—‘—‘You write it,’ Tom;
;yiiu’re ‘the only one who can say‘ what we

V ean.” ‘
'l*7;"o_So he wrote it- . ._
- ":‘5‘We"hold.these truths to be self-evident,

;ha]t, all ‘menrare created’ equal . . .”*
 And he ‘went on: “. . . That they are
* .,endo’iv!»ed by their Creator with inherent and
't;<inalienable~ rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuitgof happiness . . .”
l; 7 Then he ‘tobk their grievances and listed
..‘thein; and wound up by saying: “And for
,"the,-‘support, of fthis Declaration, we mutually
; pledge‘ to each other our lives, our fortunes,
f and {ourf sacred ' honor.”
  having finished his.,work,.he gave it
’ .toh-the committee for final drafting...

 {They argued with young Tom Jefferson,
A". ry'i,ng;to show him it was wise, for the time‘
fbeing, to say that all men were created equal
?”—';—,except thoseowned by other men. They
 argued, but they didn’t convince him.
 In ‘this way, the Declaration was issued
 .tof-the world. ‘They didn’t say that all men.
M were. not equal. They just didn’t say that
njien owned by other men were unequal.
 -i.V‘So7they fought the Revolutionary War,
'.{and won. Andin those armies, black soldiers
vgfought side by;-side with white. They fought
ndldid honor to themselves and the cause
offfreedom. Other black men,- however, did

(;,G'u'ld not fight.

draw up a Constitution for the new Republic.
And what they had tried to tell Jefferson

was only a small difference of ‘opinion in

177 6, had become bigger. Those who owned

other men not only showed no inclination to .

give up that ownership; they were now
claiming that their ownership of other men
gave them, as owners, the right to vote_ for
their property, and they wrote it into the
Constitution.

So occupied did they become with this
question, that human ‘rights were forgotten,
and the Constitution was submitted to the
people‘ without mention of their rights.
This time, ,Tom Jefferson had to fight to
insert something into the document, not
against something being taken out.

From France he wrote to his friends and

said: “Don’t take it without a Bill of Rights.” 

And they didn’t take it until 10 amendments
were added. The people were strong enough
to say "that human rights had to\ go with
property rights, they weren’t strong enough
to say that no property right could be in
human beings. ,7 g

It happened that the men owned by
other-men were black. And it happened, too,
that great profit and power came to the few
owners. They would give up neither the
profitnor the power. They did, as Jefferson
said they would: they-_“waged cruel war
against human nature itself, violating its
most sacred rights of life and liberty in the
persons of a distant people.”

To hold other men in‘ slavery, they in-
vented the fiction that because all slaves

_ Jwere black, all blacks must’ be slaves. Where

free Negroes had fought freely with honor

in 1776, now the owners of other men car- -

ried on a campaign to rid the land of free
Negroes. The country must be convinced
that the natural state of Negroes was slav-

‘ery. It ‘was not m'an’s,r but God’s, will, they

said. ‘ .
V HEY cast their eyes to the West and
South and saw new opportunities to own

more land and more human beings. By I849,

a Senator from Mississippi was ,saying:
“No one, acquainted with the vast min-

eral res\ources of California and New Mex- _

ico, and who is aware. of the peculiar adapt-
ness of slave labor to mining, can doubt for
a moment that were slaves introduced into
California and New Mexico, for the purpose
of being employed in the mining operations
there in progress . . ._, their labor would re-
sult in . . . profitsnot heretofore realized

V by the most successful sugar planters of the

country.”
. They made their bid, and lost.

But the country never massed the power
to reverse the “small compromise" worked on
Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence; A
new gang of owners arose, not owning other
men, but so concerned with property rights
that they could shake hands easily with

other men whose‘ property had been in ”

slaves. The men of Wall Street joined hands

with the owners in the South; it was a unity‘

of property against human rights. And it
is with us today. i
That is why the situation of the Negro

in America is such an accurate gauge of the; ‘C .
rights, of all the’ people. When the Negro has” 
advanced, the people as -a whole have ad-
vanced. When he has been beaten back, the ‘
whole people ‘have been beaten back.

The people advanced and passed the Wag-  _ C 
ner Labor Relations Act. The men of prop- »- 

erty attacked, and passed-——the Taft-Hartley
Law. The ball is on the Negro’s foot; the
chain is attached to all of us. ’

The treatment handed out to the Negro
people in this land is but the long shadow
of the treatment handed out to ‘all of Abe
L1ncoln’s “plain people.” 

V From the states where men once owned
other men, today come the loudest voices,
demanding attacks against the people. They‘.
scream for concentration camps for labor.‘
leaders, for atom bombs against the world’s
plain people. Where once they wanted to
drop put of the “Union” to keep their prop-V
erty In human beings, now they demand to
drop out of the United Nations.

Negro History Month reminds us that.

the Negro seeks no special favors. It reminds ,

us only that it is high time we‘, corrected the  _
‘compromise of 1776; and- where it says:
All men are endowed by their Creator wi»_th‘-
certain and inalienable rights . . .” we add:
“Including the Negropeople of the United ‘
States.”   6

Negro’ is to breaklthe‘ chain binding all of
us plain people. 7 . ‘ ,

' Who's Humphrey?  
' (Continued from Page 6) , v

to be reminded of what Mine-Mill’s Interiiationalli.
Executive Board had to say, when it warnedthat

“the Humphrey investigation is fraught with danger- “ H _

for all labor.” T g 4
One thing is certain, however; the big business
backers of Hubert Horatio Humphrey are lining
up at the pay window. Hubert has run the gamut.
_His ambition affects him like a drug. He is an ad-
dict of-his own opportunism. ‘~‘It was almost embar-
rassing to watch him operate in getting his name
on the Minnesota primary ballot as “favorite son” 7
candidate for President. Perhaps Harry Truman
believes his sincerity about wanting to hold the pri-
mary line for the President. Perhaps that was one of
Humphrey’s motives in having his candidacy‘ an-

-nounced. But there are too many signposts on Hum-

phrey’s road to the top that convince many Minne-
sotans that running as a “favorite son” in 1952 is
just another Humphrey tactic, with 1956 shaping up
_as.his real goal. ‘

In the process of defeating Humphrey’s attack on
the labor unions, American workers will help place
a political embargo on fuel for H‘ubert’s rocket ship.

" That will be good for labor, and goodlfor America.
s The man is dangerous.

Time magazine once quoted one of Hubert’s po- T
litical lieutenants as saying:‘ A A ;

“The trouble with Humphrey is he never takes ,
time out. He’s never alone with himself. If -the guy‘
would only sit down with himself and say, ‘What.
am I all about?’ But he’s afraid to ask himself that
question.” — '

It is to be hoped that the American workers will
give Hubert Horatio Humphrey enough “time out”-
to ask himself that question. . i
