Leadership Meetings

  Held in Four

Areas

DENVER—More than two hundred local leaders and staff members representing
thousands of non—ferrous metals industry workers in 17 states throughout the East,
Midwest, Southwest and Rocky Mountain Empire participated in four Mine-Mill area-
wide conferences during October in one of the most comprehensive series of rank and
file leadership meetings conducted by the union in years. Districts involved were 1, 2,

3, 4 and 6.
The series, planned by
the International Executive

Board at its last meeting, was
kicked off in September when
some 60 delegates gathered in

Bessemer, Ala., for the District ~

5 c o n f e r e n c e representing
workers in five Southern states
—-Alabama, Mississippi, Ten-
nessee, South Carolina and
Georgia."
. AS Mine-Mill Union went to
press, locals in District 6 had
just held their leadership
meeting covering members in
Connecticut, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania and Mary-
land, closing out thesessions
for the month. The last of the
series will be held by District
7 local delegates Nov. 4 and 5
in San Francisco. Both of
these two conferences will
be reported in the next issue.

All of the conferences have
been guided by generally simi-
lar agendas designed to in-
volve the rank and file leader-
ship and staff in full discus-
sions of the major problems

facing the 11nion "and the pro-
gram and policies flowing
from them. International of-
ficers participated in each of
the conferences, for the most
part acting as discussion
leaders.

Topics receiving the most
emphasis were preliminary
planning for next year’s bar-
gaining and consideration of
means for more effective po-
litical action during the next
session of Congress as well as
in the 1962 election campaigns.

. David Duarte of the Arizona

Mine-Mill Council greeted the
conference in the name of the
Council. An opening address
was delivered by Barraza. who
also chaired the sessions.
The three-day meeting re-

sembled a small convention , V

both in its set-up and ‘talks by
International Union speakers
whose participation interlaced
the delegates’ discussion. The
featured speakers included
Western Vice - President Al
Skinner, Secretary Treasurer
Irving Dichter, Research Dir-
ector Bernard SW. Stern and
General Counsel Nathan Witt.

WHILE their talks gave a
general “pitch,” the main dis-

cussion and action of the meet-.

ing centered around reports
and resolutions presented by
conference committees in
which all of the delegates par-
ticipated. I

These committees were:-01»
ganization and Consolidation
with David Shackelford ‘chair-
man; Bargaining and Equali-
zation with Robert Barcon
chairman; Political Action and
Civil Rights with Lennie Niel-
sen chairman; Defense with
Buren Elkins chairman; and
Finance with Lorenzo France-
ware‘ chairman. ‘

One of the highlights of the
conference was the discussion
on bargaining with emphasis
on the union’s wage equaliza-
tion programled by Research
Director Stern whose report
and answers to questions from
the floor were supplemented
by committee members S.
Schnaittacher, J. Dispenza, C.
Merino and A. C. Yanez.

A greater role for the union
in Washington, D. C. was
stressed in discussionon the
political action committee's re-
port. This called for intensified
activity on legislation covering
the shorter work week, federal
unemployment compensation
standards and workmen’s com-
pensation act, school aid, aged
medical care, income taxes,
civil rights and other social
welfare measures.

The adopted report noted .

study bill. . i ‘

WASHINGTON, D. C. —— A
fishing expedition by the Sen-
ate Internal Security subcom-
mittee here Oct. 13 caught
plenty of newspaper headlines
all over the country, but
turned up nothing to substan-
tiate its alleged purpose-—
namely, to find anything
wrong with the recently signed
pact of mutual assistance be-

, tween Mine-Mill" and the Team-

sters Union. _ h . -

What the’ hearing did estab- 

lish beyond the shadow of a
doubt was the plain and sim-
ple fact that the Mine-Mill,
'l‘eamste1's agreement to assist
each other in all fields of la-
bor activity is a trade union
pact entered into for trade un-
ion reasons beneficial to the
members of both organiza-
tions and the trade union
movement in general.

V The pact itself and the logi-
cal reasons for it were de-
fended aggressively and vig-
orously -by the -leaders :of-both

organizations in their testi-
mony -before the subcommit-
tee. .

SUBPOENAED to t e s t i f y
were President James R. Hof-
fa of the Teamsters and Vice-

tary-Treasurer Irving Dichter,

Vice-President:

 U. S. Report Supports

Randolph on Rights

OT long ago I read an article based, on recent figures
issued by the U. S. Census Bureau which pointed out

. that while Negroes have made economic progress in

recent years, this progress is not as much as most people
think and that Negro family incomes are rising signi-
  ~: ficantly slower than those of white families.

You don’t have to be an expert on this
subject to figure out why this is so. The
plain and simple reason is discrimination
against the Negro in opportunities for jobs
as well as in advancement to higher paying
skills from jobs he already has.

Nothing points this up more sharply than
the much publicized dispute last month be-
tween George Meany, President of the AFL-
CIO, and A. Philip Randolph, President of
the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,
Vice-President of the AFL-CIO and the only
Negro member of the AFL-CIO’s executive
board. -

Randolph, long a champion in the fight to gain dignity and
equal rights for Negroes in the House of Labor, presented a
four-point anti-discrimination program to last month’s quarterly
meeting of the AFL-CIO executive board.

‘Ir ‘k ‘k
T CALLED for the elimination of anti-racial features in the
constitutions of a number of AFL-CIO affiliated internation-

   
   

Howard

' als, equal opportunity for young workers—without regard to

race or color——in the apprentice training programs of all unions,
recognition of Negro trade unionists on policy-making bodies
of their unions, and finally Randolph's program proposed that
the AFL-CIO adopt a code of fair trade union racial practices
which would require expulsion of unions failing to eliminate
racial discrimination in their ranks.

It would seem that such a program is basic to the demo-
cratic objectives of labor and certainly should be part of the
foundation of the merged federation in this day and age.

But the answer which Randolph got from Meany and the
AFL-CIO executive board was a vitriolic blast at himself per-
sonally and a flat denial that the practices he wanted corrected
in the AFL-CIO actually existed. '

**~k

HE NEGRO labor leader was accused of having made “in-

credible assertions” and “untrue and unfair allegations.”

The AFL-CIO boa-rd’s 20-page report rebuked Randolph for
“false” and “baseless charges,” demanded he stop “throwing
bricks” at the AFL-CIO and censured him for creating “the gap
that has developed between organized labor and the Negro com-
munity.” -

By a strange coincidence, the same day that the AFL-CIO
issued its censure of Randolph, the U. S. Civil Rights Commis-
sion issued a report asserting the very same charges which
Randolph had made. '

‘A’ * ‘k

HE GOVERNMENT agency said that American Negroes"

looking for better jobs are trapped by a “vicious cycle” of
racial barriers and urged Congress to pass legislation banning
racial discrimination by labor unions. 2

“Existing civil rights machinery within the AFL-CIO has
proved to be largely ineffective in eliminating discrimination by
labor organizations,” the Commission report said.

The commission emphasized discrimination in the construc-
tion field, noting that union membership is practically a pre-
requisite for a‘job. Yet Negroes are consistentlydenied mem-
bership and especially are barred from apprenticeship training
programs which would give them a chance for better-paying
work, the report said.

‘I: ‘k ‘k

HE COMMISSION also pointed out that some industrial un-

ions freely admit Negroes, but resort to discrimination in
the collective bargaining process.

Further, according to the commission’s report, one result
of such discrimination has been to discourage Negroes from
even applying for skilled jobs or for training to qualify for
higher paid occupations, despite the country's shortage of tech-
nical manpower.

Who’s right—Meany and the AFL-CIO executive board, or
Randolph and the U. S. Civil Rights Commission. — ASBURY

Local 700 Unit Strikes

_ the following

ORANGE, Calif.—Employees
of Great Western Cordage
company here, who make up a
unit of Mine-Mill Los Angeles
Local 700, went on strike Sept.
26 after months of negotia-
tions failed to produce a de-
cent contract offer from man-
agement.

From a position of no offer
at all in March, the company
came up with its first proposal
on a take it or lea.ve it basis
in August—foiir cents across
the board retroactive to May
1. This was rejected by the
members as entirely inade-
quate, especially in view of a
17'/2 cents per hour settlement
made by a company closely
associated with Great ‘Western
in San Francisco.

In face of another final of-

fer from the company in late
September——again four cents,
but this time effective on ac-
ceptance rather than retroac-
tive to May 1 as in the first
offer——the workers voted 58 to
8 by secret ballot to strike.

Four picket teams patrol
the plant gates. A sizable
number of women are em-
ployed at the plant and their
participation in the strike is
unanimous and forceful. All
members are doing picket
duty.

A special meeting Oct. 14
again rejected the company’s
4-cent offer and reaffirmed the
union’s 10-cent wage demand.
The Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service has been
notified of the union’s avail-
ability for negotiations at any
time. '1 -' ._

THE MINE-MILL UNION

LOCAL 515 negotiating committee members pose for photo offer con-
tract settlement with Pend Oreille Mines & Metals Company at Metuline
Falls, Wush., reported in October issue of Mine-Mill Union. In pholo are:
Jim Bryant, Martin Muhuren, Robert Mcihuren, Bert Irwin and Stan
Bucher. They were assisted by District 7 Board Member James Buck.

 

More Contract Gains Negotiated

Erie, Pa.

A new 2-year contract with
Parker White Metal Company
was ratified by Erie, Pa., Lo-
cal 711 at a special member-
ship meeting on Oct. 7. Pro-
viding better than a 10 cents
hourly package increase the
first year and an opener on
economic issues the second
year, the agreement calls for
improvements
this year:

sllqourly pay increases of four
to‘ nine’ cents‘ retroactive to
Oct. 1, raising average earned
ra.te in the plant to $2.96 an
hour; vested rights at age 35
after 10 years of service in an
improved pension plan (vest-
ing was a key factor in the
negotiations) .

Under Health and Welfare——
$10,000 major medical plan
covering 80 per cent of bene-
fits after a $100 calendar year
deductable; $18.50 room and
board hospitalizaton; $450 sur-
gical schedule; $75 out-patient
diagnostic; plus increased spe-
cial services and improved
contract language.

The company pays all costs-
on insurance and pension pro- ,

grams.

negotiations w e r e Local 711
President Mike Bukowski, Jer-
ry Firch, Jerry Ring, Jack
Shadle, George Hein, Don Bur-
ger and Int’l Rep. Joe Scioli.,

Pomona, Calif.

Reopening negotiations were
concluded Oct. 4 by members
of Los Angeles Local 700 with
American Brake Shoe com-
pany in Pomona providing for
total wage and fringe gains in
one year of more than 13 cents
an hour.

Unanimously accepted by
the members in secret ballot
were a wage raise of six cents
an hour across the board, plus
seven-tenths of a cent to cor-
rect inequities which means
an additional increase of five
cents per hour for workers in
three classifications.

In addition, on Feb. 1 of
next year the company will as.
sume the employee’s share of
the hospital and medical in-
surance cost (ranging from
$7.55 to $8.15 per month),
worth an average of 6% cents
per hour in take-home pay.
Removal of certain restrictive
language in the contract’s» holi-
day clause was also negotiated.

Attempts of the company to
exfend the.C0_ntract in all its
terms to 1964 were defeated,

thus enabling negotiations on
all issues prior to next year’s
Oct. 1 expiration date.

Plant negotiating committee-
men Elwin Lee, Wilfred Smiley
and Ozell Alexander were as-
sisted by District 7 Board
Member James Buck, Int’l
Rep. James Daugherty and
Business Agent Rito Valencia.

members while the bill was

being pushed through Con-\

gress.

While the new law is not up
to the original Mine-Mill safe-
ty bill, it is a step in the right
direction and can be improved,
Olsen said. He also assured
the delegates of his support
for the union’s proposal to
lower the social security re-
tirement age for miners.

CONSIDERABLE d i s c u s -
sion was devoted to Research
Director Stern’s report o-n bar-

stressed included: job security,
guaranteed work weeks, sever-
ance pay and improvements in

Internal unity as well as
within the labor movement in
general was stressed by Dicl1-
ter as a necessity for bargain-
ing effectiveness.

In this connection the con-
ference unanimously adopted
a resolution condemning the
raiding activities of the Steel-
workers union “and any other
organization that attempts to
disrupt and cause dissension
among organized workers to
prevent them from obtaining
their just objectives of better
working conditions, wages and

O’Hara bill in the last session of Congress.

Speaking at the union’s
Montana leadership confer-
ence Oct. 6, Clark recalled that
the original Mine-Mill bill was
first introduced in Congress
some 10 years ago by the late
Senator James E. Murray and
Cong. Lee Metcalf and was

known as the liilurray-Metcalf
bill.

Metcalf, who now occupies
Murray’s seat in the Senate,
introduced a_ similar bill this

CLARK said unanimous
Democratic support of the
O'Hara bill in the Senate La-

posed approval by the Senate
itself would not have been pos-

Montana's freshman Demo-

set up its final enactment in

THE MINE-MILL UNION

November. I 

Mine-Mill Fraternal Delegates
Visit With Cananea Strikers

By Maclovio R. Barraza
Board Member, District 2

At Cananea in northern Sonora, Mexico, some 45 miles south of Mine-Mill’s Local
551 in Bisbee, Ariz., Local 65 of the Mexican Miners Union has been on strike against
the giant Anaconda Copper Company for almost two months.

The Cananea miners make a meager $3 a day for eight hours work. Their strike

demand is a 50 per cent wage

The union points out that
even with a 50 per cent
increase the miner’s wage rate
would go to only $4.50 a day,
while just 45 miles north in
Bisbee a. miner doing the same
kind of work and producing
the same metal makes $22 a
clay. ,

_ They further contend that
their union has always taken
a responsible attitude in con-
tract negotiations, pointing out

ithey haven’t.. been on strike

since 1944.

THIS mining town of Can-
anea is known in the annals
of Mexican history as the
birth place of the Mexican
revolution, for it was here
that in 1906 the miners went
on strike protesting injustices,
unbearable working conditions
and the miserable three pesos
a day pay. Like our predeces-
sors, the Western Federation
of Miners who were fighting
for $5 for an 8-hour day, the
Cananea miners were fighting
for five pesos for an 8-hour
day. ,

It was here in Cananea that,
during the 1906 strike, scabs
and strike-breakers were im-
ported from the Bisbee and
Fort Huachuca area, -- a n d
where six strikers were killed.

The strike leaders were then

hustled off to one of the most ‘

feared prisons during the Por-
firio Diaz dictatorship, San
Juan de Ulua, an island off the
coast of Veracruz.

YEARS pass, and the times
have changed.

Now in 1961, instead of
strike-breakers imported to
Cananea, a union delegation

from Bisbee and other Arizona
mining towns have gone to
Cananea on a fraternal visit
offering moral and financial

assistance to the Cananea
strikers.
Our Mine-Mill delegation

consisted of Winston Elkins,
Sam Lucero and Richard Jim-
enez of Bisbee Local 551, R0-
dolfo Garcia of Superior Local
938, Regional Director Frank
Vettorel,
Schnaittacher and myself.

 ~ -1:

THE Cananea strikers re-
ceived us with great enthusi-
asm. We were introduced and
spoke at a mass meeting which
had been called for that day.

After the meeting we were
taken on a tour of the open
pit and smelter. When we got
to the picket line I stopped my
car, but to my surprise one of
the strike committee members
who was with us said: “Go
ahead into the plant; you do
not have to stop.”

He later explained to me
that in Mexico now they do
not set up picket lines to keep
out scabs, but to take care of
the company’s property. This
is because when a strike is
called the union is made re-
sponsible to see that no dam-
age is done to any parts of the
operation.
- it  iii

ANOTHER thing that made
a real impression on our dele-

gates was that a black and red"

flag had been placed ontop
of the smelter smoke stack‘.
The flag means that the op-

eration is on strike, therefore .

increase. The company’s last offer was three cents.

Our brothers in the delega-
tion have reported back their
impressions of the strike to
their locals. Contributions to
the Cananea strikers have al-
ready been made by Bisbee Lo-
cal 551, Douglas Local 4'70 and
Morenci Local 616.

  New Montana Safety Code
Given gtate Board Approval

BUTTE, Mont.——The Montana Code of Minimum Safety Standards for Mining,
"Quarrying and Smelting Operations was approved by the Industrial Accident Board
of Montana at its last meeting October 23 in Helena. . T
_ The code represented over three years of work by the safetycode drafting com-
mittee appointed by the board in July 1958. The committee was chaired by President

— Edwin G. Koch, President
of Montana School of
Mines, Butte, who served as
public representative.

Two labor representatives

and "two management repre-
sentatives were also appointed.
Lab or representatives ap-
pointed in 1958 were Dan Mar-

‘ tin, Butte Miners Local 1, and
William Annan, Great Falls

Local 16. Martin served_

, throughout the life, of the com-
mittee. Annan was unable to
complete his term, and subse-
quently Eugene Corcoran and
Owen McNally, of Anaconda,

especially that of Dan Martin
for his patience and persist-

Cochise County Locals '9   2

Score on Junior College 

DOUGLAS, Ariz.—Establishment of a Cochise Coun-

ty Junior College was approved by voters in a special  2
_election held Oct. 17. — G -

Political observers were convinced that the vigorous
campaign carried on by Mine-Mill Locals 470 in Douglas

and 551 ill Bisbee, major
population centers of the
county, was a big factor in the
relatively heavy vote to carry
the measure.

The vote for the Junior Col-
lege carried by 17 to 1 in Doug-
las and 10 to 1 in Bisbee.

>l< >5! =l<

ORIGINAL idea for the col-
lege was initiated by the two
Mine-Mill locals back in 1957.
Backed by the Mine-Mill Ari-
zona Council, both locals have
lobbied in the State Legisla-
ture o—n its behalf ever since.

Prior to last month’s elec-
tion, the two locals issued a
joint leaflet urging a vote for
the college. The leaflet was
distributed house to house by
Local 470 in Douglas and
mailed by Local '551 to resi-
dents of all towns in the Bis-
bee area.

Significance ‘of the heavy
vote in the recent election is
its expected influence on the
bond election for the Junior

College to be held next spring.

Your Senators and Congressmen

  How They Voted on Key Labor Issues

  

Following is a tabulation of US. Senators and Congressmen. from
M ine-Mill areas" and their votes during the first session of the 87th
Congress on key legislative issues important to Mine-Mill and labor
generally. .

This box score is based on an analysis by AFL-CIO’s COPE. “R”

. (Right) indicates a vote for the bill; “W” (Wrong) indicates a vote

against; “A” means absent. A dash is used where there was no roll call
and consequently no recorded vote. Double asterisks are used in the cases

 

of Rep. M. Udall of Arizona and Sen. J. G. Tower of Texas, both. of whom
were elected to fill vacated seats in the 87th Congress -and did not have

the opportunity to vote on all issues listed. A single asterisk is‘used__

before the names of Senators who are up for re-election in 1962.

The last column, “Percent of Liberal Votes,” is based on an analysis
by Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) of votes cast on 10 key issues
during the session. The figures indicate ADA’s measure of the liberalism
of each Senator and Congressman determined by the proportion of his
votes in harmony with liberal policies.

Philippines

The Philippine government
has recently passed an act to
pay a subsidy to gold produc-
ers. The subsidy is payable to
all producers of gold, whether
it is the mine’s chief product,
or the by-product of base metal
mining. I

Subsidies range from $25.00
to $32.50. per ounce of gold.
Australia, Colombia, the Fiji
Islands and Canada also sub-
sidize gold production, al-
though the maximum Cana-
dian subsidy is considerably
less than that paid in the Phil-
ippines.

A unique feature of the
Philippine subsidy program is
a provision that 5 per cent of
the subsidy payment to any
producer must be distributed
as a bonus to the miners.

Australia

Mt. Isa. Mines, big Austral-
ian lead, zinc and copper pro-
ducers, which is 53.8 per cent
owned by American Smelting
and Refining Co., was struck
September 25 and was still
closed at Mine-Mill Union
press time. 5

Dispatches from Australia
reported labor, and manage-
ment far apart, and predicted
a long strike unless the gov-
ernment should declare a
state of emergency and order
the strikers back to work.

Last year Mt. Isa produced
about 55,000 tons of lead, 20,-
000 tons of zinc and 80,000 tons
of copper, In 1960 it paid $2,-
141,000 in dividends to Ameri-
can Smelting & Refining Co.

"’ConfroversiaI Lead-Zinc Bill

Signed, Still Needs Financing

WASHINGTON, D. C.-——President Kennedy early last month signed the contro-
versial Edmondson bill into law. Sponsored by the congressman representing the
Oklahoma portion of the Tri-State lead-zinc district, the bill authorizes payment of a
subsidy to small mine producers of lead-zinc amounting to. 75 per cent of the differ-

’ , ence between the price of lead and 141/3 cents per pou

. ence between the price o.f
‘ zinc and 141/; cents. Pres-
 .ent prices of lead and zinc are
11. cents and 11% cents per
‘pound respectively. At these
prices, the federal subsidy to
small producers would be 2%

cents per pound of lead and

‘ 1.65 cents‘ per pound of zinc.
_To be eligible for the sub-
,. sidy, a producer must not have

 imined more than 3,000 tons of

 ilead and zinc combined during
' any year after January 1, 1956,
and his production nmst come

    
  
  

duction after that date, and he.

,-.9111 a. ‘mine thatuzas in pres ,

must not have acquired his
mine subsequent to August 1,
1961. .

Subsidies are payable on a
maximum tonnage of 1,500
tons each of lead and Zinc for
the year 1962; of 1,200 tons
each for 1963, 900 tons each for
1964 and 600 tons each for
1965.

:5: ill 9%

WIRE services quoted the
Department of Interior  
ing an cstimaterl 275 mines
may qualify for aid under the
bill.

According to figures sup-

-plied by the?» Departrnent -to

nd, and 55 per cent of the differ-

the House Subcommittee on
Mines, these are small mines
which averaged a combined
production of lead and zinc of
a little over 200 tons per mine
in 1960. Few if any employed
any day’s pay miners. Some
were operated on gypo con-
tracts, most by part time oper-
ators who had other, regular
employment.

The subsidies will have to
be financed by appropriations

each year. Congress has passed‘

no appropriation for lead-zinc
subsidies thus far, and until it

does, -the program cannot go

into operation. » --. » .

INDUSTRY NOTES

METAL PRICES are in the News. President Kennedy
bluntly and publicly warned steel industry last September not
to raise prices as a result of wage increases going into effect
October 1, as provided in contracts signed after the steel strike
nearly two years ago.

The President’s warning followed issuance of a report by
his Council of Economic advisers, indicating the steel companies
could maintain present prices, pay higher wages, and still make
very good profits. Steel industry leaders huffed and puffed,

 

issued truculent statements, but have done nothing about rais-

ing prices. One reason is——in late September aluminum ingot
was cut from 26 cents to 24 cents per pound. Aluminum is be-
coming increasingly competitive with steel in many uses——m0st
recently in tin cans, long a steel monopoly.

Aluminum is also competitive with copper in many uses.
Throughout October, there wereincreasing signs that present
31 cents per pound price for refined copper was under heavy
pressure. ‘Aside from aluminum, high strength plastics com-
petitive with brass have been cut 20 per cent and more this year.

European consumption of copper has fallen off, and prices
there are far enough below the U. S. price that it pays South
American and African producers to ship to the U. S. and pay

the 1.7 cent tariff. Copper scrap prices have fallen by several ’

cents per poundisince the latter part of September. Scrap
prices are often a -good barometer.

On the plus side, U. S. copper users, brass and wire mills,
have bought more copper from producers since last March than
in any corresponding period for many years. Chances are
though that the days of 31 cent copper are numbered.

‘ Even if prices do fall, producers don’t need 31 cents to
make adequate profits. For this statement we cite as authority
the metal companie-s’ own trade paper, American Metal Market,
which criticized the hike to 31 cents last May, calling it an
“aggravation” to copper. users, who feel that “mine producer
profits were quite satisfactory for the first quarter of 1961
when a 29 cent a pound price for copper prevailed . . . the in-
dustry right now would do Well to be thinking of ways to cut
the price of copper and its alloys.” This was written before
the recent cut in aluminum prices.

METAL & THERMIT CORP., diversified, multi-plant de-
tinner, chemical producer and industrialequipment distributor
has proposed merger with Udylite Co1‘p., a supplier of metal fin-
ishing equipment and materials. .

Last year Metal & Thermit sales were over $40 million while
Udylite’s topped $52 million. Wall Street brokers Hertzfeld and
Stern see Metal & Thermit profits hitting a new record in 1962.
Workers at the company’s two plants in New Jersey are rep-
resented by Mine-Mill Local 521.

PINE POINT, huge, rich lead-zinc deposit on the southern -

shores of Great Slave Lake in Canada’s Northwest Territories
moves closer to development. Pine Point is controlled by Con-
solidated Mining and Smelting Co., Which in turn is owned by
Canadian Pacific Railway. ’

Key to developing this remote mining prospect is rail trans-
portation to move concentrates to smelter. Canadian Pacific
has shied away from building the railroad, prefers to have it
subsidized by the Canadian Government. Parliament was about
to pass the subsidy authorization at Mine-Mill press time.

Concentrates will be shipped to CM&S smelter at Trail,
B. C., Pine Point, on the southern shore, is directly across Great
Slave Lake from Yellowknife, where Mine-Mill now has con-
tracts with operating mines. Yellowknife Local 802 is Mine-
Mil1’s northernmost local, about 200 miles farther north than
Local 203 at Juneau, Alaska.

ROCK BREAKING by electricity is a new method recently
developed by Montana School of Mines researchers at Butte.
The new method promises to be safer and faster than secondary
blasting of rock. '

, The equipment needed is a radio-frequency generator, the
current of which is directed by wires to the rock to be broken,

The current heats a path through the rock, which causes more {

expansion to take place in the heated than in the unheated areas,
and results in crumbling of the rock. ‘

SILVER stock-s held by Uncle Sam are being depleted rap-
idly. Silver which Treasury can sell (that is, silver in excess of
what must be held as backing for silver certificates) amounted
to 123%; million ounces last'January 1. As of November 1,
Treasury “free” silver holdings had declined by more than half,
to less than 60 million ounces.

P-resent price of silver at around 91 cents per ounce will
shoot up when Treasury stops selling or exhausts its free silver
stocks. In anticipation, Montreal, Canada dealers are quoting
silver, for delivery next May at $1.05 per ounce.

made it clear that not only did
a legitimate trade union pact
of mutual aid exist between
two of the most important un-
ions in the non-ferrous metals
industry covering their com-
mon interests, but that both
organizations would welcome,
and in fact had, similar labor
unity agreements and under-
standings with other unions.

To the question as to wheth-
er he ‘felt the welfare of the
Teamsters membership is aid-

»-ed by an alliance with Mine-

Mill, Hoffa answered with a
blunt “yes.”

Asked about a press state-
ment issued prior to the hear-
ing by Mine-Mill President
John Clark which defended the
pact for “many sound and val-
id trade union reasons . . .
beneficial to the members of
both of our unions and to all
workers in the non-ferrous
metals industry” and which
questioned the purpose of the
hearing, Hoffa declared:

“It’s a pretty good-sounding
statement to me.”

Clark Statement on Hearing

DENVER—The following press statement was issued by
Mine-Mill President John Clark on Oct. 11, two days before the
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing on Mine-Mill’s
mutual assistance pact with the Teamsters:

“I am proud on behalf of my organization to have signed
the pact of mutual assistance with the Teamsters, the largest
and one of the most militant unions in America.

“This agreement between Mine-Mill and the Teamsters
was arrived at openly, was approved by the International Exe-
cutive Boards of both our organizations, was published in full
in both of our official publications and was released to the
press. There is obviously nothing secret about it.

“There are many sound and valid trade union reasons for
such a pact. It will be beneficial to the members of both, our
unions and to all workers in the non-ferrous metals industry.

“Since when does the signing of such a labor unity agree-
ment, between two of the most important unions in the non-fer-
rous metals industry, fall within the questioning of the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee?” -

He also called attention to

the recent agreement between V

BUFFALO, N. Y.——Nine hundred members of Mine-

the company’s unilateral increase of work loads.

“It is indeed deeply gratify-

the powerful Teamsters Union.
Under your leadership we are
proud to salute the Teamsters

the Taft-Hartley and Landrum-

gone forward to continue to

WITH the men still out,
however, the union called in

developed in the talks between
company and union through
the mediator, the men, at a
special ‘overflow membership

“I know every day in the week

reverse cases found by juries.”
P r e s s e d on this subject,
Hoffa declared: “I don’t intend
to pre-judge people until they
have had their last day in

routine myself,” he added.

He said Mine-Mill s t a n d s

ready at any time to enter into a

similar agreements with every
other union in the industry.

The Mine-Mill S ecretary.
Treasurer read a statement
signed by the union’s four top
officers which documented the
fact that the pact between the
two unions “rests upon a mu-
tuality of interests in the non-
ferrous metal mining industry,
especially copper, where an
increasing production is com-
ing from the open pits in
which the use of trucks has
been of growing importance.”

“Our objective in entering
into this pact.” Dichter pointed
out, “has been to advance the
interests_ of our members and
of all workers in our industry
by the extension of organiza-
tionand more effective bar-
gaining.”

F u 1' t h e r emphasizing the
fact that “the Teamsters ‘Un-
ion is, next to Mine-Mill, one
of the most important unions
in the copper mining industry,
as measured, by membership
and properties under con-
tract,” he said “we expect re-
sults in joint organizing cam-
paigns in the few remaining

unorga.nized mines, and great-‘

er strength and stability in
joint collective bargaining to
flow from this pact.”

He stated in behalf of the

- Mine-Mill officers:

“We are ready at any time
to sign similar pacts with oth-
er unions in this industry as
an important means of advanc-
ing the interests of all work-

. ers in this industry.”

FOLLOWING the reading
of the statement, Dichter and
Sanderson were questioned at
some length about the $100,-
000 loan secured by Mine-Mill
at the National Savings and
Trust Company in Washing-
ton, D. C., which was guaran-
teed by the Teamsters, during
the 1959-60 copper strike for
use as strike relief. and aid to
