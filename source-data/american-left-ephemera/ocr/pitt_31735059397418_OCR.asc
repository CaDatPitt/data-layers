We know that we are no where near understand-
ing what "class" really means...what the dynamics
are...etc. We do have, as we tried to indicate
in "self-criticism - part l"-an idea of what we
should be doing . We think that we should just
start looking at experiences...and jotting them
down...preparing a notebook of our feelings and
reactions...we won't always be able to "analyze"
our experiences and feelings...but we can begin
to try...so starting in this issue we will have
a section devoted to describing various experien-
ces which have something to do with the social
and economic qualities which divide uso...

Lucy and I received a letter from a woman in
‘New Orleans who told us about some of the things
that were happening there. In the letter she
spoke of women coming in from outside and con-
tacting them and wanting to be tricked. well,

I didn't know what that meant - in fact that
.whole Part of the letter confused me...and later
that night we called her to give her support and
just talk. Again the situation with the women
coming in from outside was mentioned and as I
made a face - Lucy visually signalled to me what
it meant.

(I started to type out my little history -
but that was both too long and not really rele-
vant...) So how to put it - will I had, in the
past, taken on an air of self-righteousness when
I talked about my relationships - and had been‘
quite critical of what I thought was the crude

exploitation that happened in the “gay world”....

but as I can now admit, with this subtle air of
‘superiority. Lucy and I had talked about the
“gay world” because she had different experi-
ences from me - and had, in a way, been part of
the gay world and pick-up scenes. She had
helped me at least gain some understanding...
of what it was like to be alone and seeking
comfort and closeness and only having access to
bars - or bathrooms. with this behind me, I was
a?le t0 53Yl0n~the phone that since it was get-
ting to be a real hassle, she should say to the
,women that she just really didn't want to relate
to a woman just in terms of her body... which
was quite different from my initial response be-
fore Lucy and I had spent hours talking about
all of this and how we wanted to relate to each
other and other women. On the way home I no-
ticed the tension and I guess I said something
about how that was really awful that those women
were coming in and exploiting the situation with
our New Orleans friends...Lucy got really mad
at me...and I don't even remember what she said
but I remember what was most real and basic
was a sense of resentment and anger that she
seemed to have. So we started to argue about
tricking. And I said that I didn't think it
was fair of her to get angry at me for not
knowing what the word meant. How could I help
it if I had never been into all of that?

And anyway I said I knew I used to be a lit-
tle self-righteous about it but look what I said
‘to P... Didn't I say you should be sympathetic
to the women but...“

Lucy said she wasn't reacting to my just not
knowing the meaning of the word - she was reac-

' they know...)

ting to a whole air,a whole context in which I

had always made judgments and put people down
for picking people up. And then she said that

that kind of superiority was just one big class
illusion...and started to talk about 'university'
weterosexual relationships ...one isn't “crude”
about things...here a male goes to a party to
pick someone up (a woman, to be picked up) only
it is a “cultural” evening...cocktails - maybe
baroque music...all very smooth, but never-the-
less, a pick-up scene. It just has polish...

or bigger liars.

It isn't some guy walking into a bar and
picking someone up there...the barmaid, a cus-
tomer or a prostitute. That doesn't have class
or polish. That guy's a pig and the other a
‘nice’ guy who is sensitive... ‘ ‘V

The same with women. I was always a little
upset when Lucy would talk about some of her
relationships. And my first impression of her
after we talked when we first met was that she
had been brutalized by both the gay and straight
worlds...and so she went on to talk about all

_‘of that...she said that the pick-up scenes were
at least straight-forward when she was in Berke-

ley...and she remembers those women with fond-
ness and she didn't feel exploited by them...

no there wasn't much real caring or anything,

but there also wasn't any expectation that

there would be. ’

And then she began to talk about the relation-

‘, ships with women that she felt really did do a.

lot of damage to her...and they were relation-
ships that happened within the framework of our
movement - and within the university community.
That was when the real fuck-over came...people
out to dominate and use you - (every town's first
out lesbian knows what it is to be discovered
and played with by all the women who have some
slight fantasy of a lesbian relationship and
seek you out to have a'gay' experience.‘ They
don't relate to you as a person who you are -
but to the fact that you are the only lesbian

In the movement there is the
announcement that people care, that we don't
exploit._ we know women who disapproved of a c
close friend of ours...our friend was seen as
exploitivc because she was Uloose”...the women
had been friends for four years before they re-
lated physically - and there is a faint suspi-
cion that anyone who relates to someone else
sexually before four years is really an exploiter
and only interested in SEX. Men were the model
of exploitation of women and alot of us who were
in Radicalesbians cut ourselves.off from older
lesbians by our air of superiority...”the bar
scene is a bad scene __but those women are not
evil..because we pick them out as women who ex-
ploit other women, we don't even begin to look
at ourselves.

She talked about how 5 or 6 women had sought
her out - how she had become involved with a few
and how destructive she found it all...that in
a one-night pick-up there is no expectation of
very much, and if it is good - fine, and if not,
well you won't see the person again.

But the way smooth people work is different -
because we can't stand to recognize certain
things we build up facades..we create relation-

. saw how shocked each of us was.

ships whcih have some length when they are in
reality incredibly destructive.

I can't even begin to convey the anger that
was being worked out...for I was holding out
about thinking there were differences...altho
I was beginning to weaken..but even if I could
grasp the distant class overtones and dynamics
that she was describing...l certainly remained
individually arrogant and superior...and that
of course infuriated her, and it should have.

well, I had gotten into a relationship when
I became active in the movement...l had seen the
woman at several meetings - and had read an ar-
ticle that she had written...when I found out

‘that she wrote it - I was anxious to talk to her.

We talked one night after the meeting - and in
fact, she stayed with me after that...it lasted
two months...it was a bad relationship for both
of us and that was clear from almost the be-
ginning - but it went on for two months until -
altho she had really rejected me first - but
stayed, I just told her to get the hell out...

Well at the heights of the argument with Lucy
she screamed “look at your relationship with
Edith...what was that but a pick-up but...”

I didn't even hear the end of the sentence.

I just exploded - jumped up and gave a side chop
to the wooden room-divider (of course hurting

my hand) and stomped into the hall where I star-
ted to kick this cardboard box..it wouldn't
break which frustrated me even more.’ And then

I was exhausted.

Of course it wasn't easy to cut through the
explosion but we both began to smile because we
And I explained
my resentment. But you know it wasn't until I
started to type this out and was caught up in
reliving the whole experience that I could
bridge that gap between an understanding that
was in my head and a gut understanding. which
is what Lucy asked of me. For as she told me
her experiences, I would say well, yes I can
see that, but I don't feel it - I don't feel the
need that you are talking about when you say
people need comfort and contact...they know that
they won't get that from a quick embrace...

I had managed to stay far away from any simi-
lar feelings...and Lucy kept saying that i
couldn't say I understood if all those feelings
were so alien to me..and she of course was
trapped by me into thinking that I was super-
good and so she had worried about saying any-
thing in the beginning.

It is only now that I can begin to feel and
recognize the needs and the anguish that led me
to get into that two month relationship...and
because I always had to create a framework of
caring and such to even begin to ask something
from the other person, I would be caught in
these relationships for a really long time..

But just before Lucy made the crack about my
“relationship” with Edith, I was gaining a bet-
ter grasp of the things she was talking about.

I sat there as she was arguing with me and I
thought, “What do I love about Marx, especi-
ally in On the Jewish Question...what do you
talk about when you are trying to explain
Marx's way of approaching problems...I really
respect his ability to make me look at the
“formal” or theoretical and expose what is ac-
tually the case. The lord of the manor seemed
nice to his serfs..but that was all romantizied/
Marx talks of those who are offended by the de-
mand that the family be broken - as tho it were
this beautiful set of relationships, when in

reality it is the heart of oppression and ex-
ploitation. -

And here is Lucy taking social behaviour
and showing me that the same exploitation and
objectification happens, and that I am part of
it ...it only seemed nicer.

Do you remember when a WL group in NY came
out and said the prostitute was their heroine...
the new model? Well, at the time, and even now
I think that is real bulIshit..but I think they
had hold of something. If you have to relate
to men in this society then I think that the
most honest way of relating is to be a prosti-
tute. And they do say something about hetero-
sexual relations. They make the real relations
alot clearer...but certainly not enjoyable.

But no we look down on prostitutes...the
same differences in economic and social back-
grounds and values that Lucy tried to convey
to me is also captured in the differences between
how we seem to drauidistinctions between prosti-
tute and call-girl, call-girl and mistress,
mistress and wife...but take a look at the
reality behind the words...there are reasons why

tricking is something we don't want to support
or encourage..but they are real reasons now.
Not based on differences which happen because
you happen to have certain "advantages, smooth-
ness or subtleties...

-I tend to think that because we were "poor" that
I came from a"working class or lower class"back-
gground...poor carries with it memories of carrying
money and a bill to the Bell Tel office and only
having enough money in my hand for part of the
bill. This meant that the "big ladies" called

all over the place to see what they should do

(it happened every month - you think they would
have known) and they kept asking me if that was
all the money that my mommy had given me...bad
lady didn't she know she was supposed to pay the
whole bill? So we were always harrassed by finances
- but we never starved...and we lived in a decent
hous...in an irish catholic neighborhood...connected
houses...coal yard in the back...railroad tracks
that divided us from thegltalian section ( we

used to throw railroad cinders ay each other)...
my mother came from a poor coal-mining town in
Indiana...grandpa and every other male in the
family died in the mines...pretty proletarian...
my father corrected copy for a newspaper and

my mother always had to work...shit office
jobs...but it was always understood that I would
go to college ( on scholarship,of course...I had
to work like mad to make sure I got scholarships)

 s
- I got a scholarship to a women's college in Pa.
It wasn't one of the breeding schools...but there
was lots of money there...I soon learned that even
tho‘ I was "poor" and they were rich...I could float
in and out of that world...just because I was "
"bright and interesting"...of course I would get
nervous when I visited someone at home...I'd
worry about the $ I spent and about what spoon or
fork got picked up first...I felt "uncultured"
...lacking in grace ( which I was and am...the
only difference is now I am glad..) (ggrﬁ, 7,12

encouraged to read ( specific books were never
suggested) there was no "classical" music in the
house...no "fine" art...ba1let was jeered at...
sports and beign bright at school were important
I felt fine about all of that until I went to
college...then around my wealthy friends who

' had grown up with "high culture" I felt

culturally deprived...ignorant...insensitive...

Illanguage... it seems to play a big role in
figuring out background...privileges...it also
opens up things to you...for with education and
certain opportunities you can learn to talk your

how hard it was to share his excitement because
of shifts in values,etc...(I understood or felt
what she was saying because my father never had
a new car...and the used ones weren' close to

EVEEYDAY ACTIONS FOR EVERYONE

About a year ago, I went to rent an apartment
in a pretty delapidated house. I was getting
pretty desperate because the renting season
was already over and I could only afford $50
to $60 a month.

The landlord took me upstairs and showed
me a/room...and then he shut the door behind
him, grabbed my breasts and asked, "If I rent
this room to you can I come visit you at night?”
Of course I told the old slob that I wasn't in-
terested but I couldn't act to angry or I knew
I wouldn't get the room. So I had to swallow
any illusions I had about being anything better
than an emotion-less body...and ask for the room
anyway. _

when I came back to move in; there was another
woman already in the room! That was it.
a mimeo of the whole scene and stood in the mid-
dle of campus handing it out WITH THE LANDLORD'S
NAME. Then I went over to the apartment house
and stuck a copy under every single one of his
tenants doors. Right on! _

Not much later, I found out that his son had
read a copy of my account...and so had the prick
landlord. One of the tenants told me that he
had asked THEM if it was ALRIGHT for him to in-
stall a new stove and new mirrors in each_apart-
ment - a few days after the mimios appeared un-
der the tenant's doors.

$70? a VHEMI

Like I said, about a year ago I was pretty
smashed broke...so when this teacher at the
college (and ex-next-door-neighbor) asked me if
I'd do nude modeling for him at pretty good pay,
I accepted. One night he asked me to come to
his office (at the college) and take off my shirt
for him so that “he could see if he could use
me”._ I agreed, though somewhat hesitantly - I
told a friend of mine where I was and to come
looking for me if I wasn't back within several
minutes. when I went up to his office, he
looked and looked and said maybe he'd do some
photography in the park. I got a little nervous
and started hinting that I was a little cau-
tious...of course he only looked at me with his
stupid, condescending look which said, “oh come
off it...do you think lLd_be interested in YOU?”

I left somewhat ashamed that I could think
such a thing of him (even though I'd been raped
before and gone through some really terrifying
scenes while hitch-hiking...like the time the
guy had taken the handle off the door so I
couldn't get out...

Anyway he never called me again.

So about a week ago and one year later, I
called up his house. He ans red and I asked
for Mrs. Lang. He said, ”MRS.(?) Lang”...

(as if he were the only pefsoh allowed to
receive calls in the house). I said yes.

when she got on the phone I told her that I
was a student at the college and that her hus-
band had asked me to do some nude modeling for

56TH?

We have a friend who is look-
ing into "medical" birth customs
‘in this kountry. In a later issue
we will give a much fuller report
(with statistics and all)on her
findings - but we wanted to share
the beginnings with you now.

She has nursed all over the

tplace and outside of the USA is
,a midwife as well as a regular
. nurse.

So she really knows the
birth scene fairly well. She
was talking about the very high
infant mortality rate that we
have in this kountry. And given
that we have the most advanced
medical technology in the whole
world...that means we actually
have to kill babies in the birth
process here .

And who runs the show here?
Are women in the US encouraged
to have their children at home
- with midwives,etc? Hell no -
here we have to have the FULL
hospital scene - with lots of
aneasthesia of one form or anoth-
er. In short - the whole birth
scene , as practiced in this
society, serves to eliminate the
mother as a functioning,partici—
pating member. If the mother is
out of it ( because of the aneas-
thesia or because of pain killers)
then she can't do her work -
they call giving birth "labor"
for fairly good reasons - and
if the mother can't do very much
guess who has to take over...?
Right - the doctor,because if
the mother cannot help by push-
ing , the doctor must pull the
child out.

So in a society where women are

told that they are only "feminine"
and fulfilled if they marry and

have children, the women are
being phased out as useful mem-
bers of the process.

Men are always talking about
our "penis envy" - hah! I frank-
ly don't know any women who have
the slightest desire to have a
penis - and if they ever once

_did , it was because it was eas-

ier to pee in the woods if you
were a boy... but I am beginning
to think that all the "penis-envy"
talk is a big distraction...men
just can't cope-with the fact

that they don't give,birth. But

if they can't give birth - they
can (since they control the med-
ical professions) manage to man-
ipulate the whole situation so
that they can take over the whole
thing...so they remain the heroes
of the story come what may. Little
does it seem to matter that by re-
writing the ancient birth scenario
children will die, be brain dam-
aged, or slow learners. If you
fix-up the mother so that she
can't push...well you end up us-
ing things like forceps which

’ do a great deal of damage. The

use of morphine to "soothe" the
mother endSup depressing not only
the breathing of the mother - but
it makes it hard to get the child
breathing...and time without air
can do all sorts of things -

from noticeable brain damage to
making children into what they
call "slow-learners". And why
does all of this happen - because
women, in the kounrty, are re-
duced to a vegetable state when
they give birth so that the males
can play the important role.

As we learn more and more about
the specifics and are able to
analyse it - we will continue
this "story" of what happens
to women in this society.

Again, we felt a little dis-
tant, but we think that it is —
terribly important that women be-
gin to realize exactly what is
going on ...what is being done
to them in order to_feed the male
ego - in order for males to con-

'tr01 more and more. As I typed
gthis up something hit me - I
thought about the tremendous A
amount of money and energy that
is going into creating life in a
test tube. In the past, I had al-
ways thought that it was the "ob-
jective" drive for knowledge which
was the force behind this re-
search...but then I wondered. I
mean we don't exactly have a pro-
blem producing children in women -
... but if it can be done without
women...if men can do it on their
own... what then?

We think that it will be better
for women the sooner that they
realize the destruction and hatred
that underlies their treatment...
we started with the article about
the abortion campaign and talked
about the price women are forced
to pay because men will certain
things...and we end up talking
about what happens to women who
don't abort...who have their
oabies...and in both cases incred-
ible damage is done... they get '
you both coming and going...men
are always "getting" women- but

many women are all too reluctant
to admit it. . .

DEATH, DESTRUCTl0N AND THE MALE EGO

As lesbians who have never
been pregnant and have no intenf
tion of ever even getting close
to the possibility of pregnancy,
we usually feel a little distant
from the struggle for abortions
on demand that is going on all
over the places But then some-
thing happened! It was a brief
sentence somewhere.°,”More US
women die from abortions than
US deaths in Vietnam." And how
much furour has the war caused?
...and in all too many cases
not because we are murdering
Vietnamese all the time.ccno
most of the anti-war sentiment
(as far as we have been able
to tell) that has spread across
this country in the last few
years is because “AMERICAN BOYS
ARE DYING OVER THERE." Because

‘our boys are dying in a "use-

less" (that is for a lot -

a war we can't seem to win)
millions of Americans want some-
thing done about it and right
awayo That more women are dying

_because of the abortion laws is

beyond comprehension¢..talk
about "stupid" and ”useless".°.
and how about all the support
from ”official"types who could
easily change the situation?.o.
or real mass support which
could put pressure on lawmakers
to change the laws? Sometimes
you get so~mad..¢one of the head-
lines on tonights local paper
was that the Mich. Court has
ruled that the "fetus is a per-
son"o.cyou know damn well what
implications that kind of de-
cision will have.And you know
that it is men who make all
those decisions which murder
women. Dre Barbara Roberts

said the following at the first
meeting of the Committee for

a Women's National Abortion
Coalition:

"coo as I continued in medical
school, I began seeing more of
the fall-out of abortion laws.

I saw a woman brought into the
Emergency Room with half of her
bowel hanging out of her vagina;
she had been driven to a crimin-
a1 abortionist because doctors
were afraid to help her, I saw
the bodies of battered children-
burned and broken bodies - ly-
ing in morgues and hospital
wards, Children who were never
wanted,who never had a chance,
who never should have been born.
And I saw women driven to drink
and drugs and suicide by a
Church that told them birth con-
trol was wrong, let alone abor-
tion, and so condemned them to

 

a life of mindless breeding.

'%bortion laws murder women.
Their murderers are not one man,
or several men, but a whole so-
ciety which has sytematically
denied us the one right about
which there should be no argu-
ment -- the right to control
our own bodies."

VThe Women's National Abortion
Coalition's ( l37A W. 14th St.,
NYC,10003)position is that abor-
tion is neither a moral,politi-
cal or population issue. They
are aware that there are forces
which favor abortion as a way
of continuing the oppression
of third world women and they
therefore seek the repeal of
all abortion laws WITH NO
FORCED STERILIZATION. They
want all women " rich or poor,
gay or straight,black,red,yellow,
brown or white - to unite to
demand our right to abortion."
And they see this victory as
the first battle victory of
our Revolution.

The abortion issue needs the
support of all of us - that's
true...the criminal destruction
of women and children which
occurs because of abortion laws
or because of the birth practi-

.ces in this kountry (which are

set-up,controlled and manipula-
ted by males) has got to stop.
Dr. Roberts is right - it isn't
one man or a few men...but she
should have made it clearer

that the"society" which she says
has systematically denied women
the right over their bodies isn't
a neuter society...it is a male-
dominated society...it is ,in
fact, a white, heterosexual,

male society. Repeal of abortion
laws with no forced sterilization
IS NOT AN END IN ITSELF...to be

a change and not just a moderate
liberal REFORM it must be seen

as merely the beginning of our
long-term struggle to free our-
selves... a struggle which in-
volves our TAKING from males that
ability to decide our lives. We,
as lesbians, know the harsh reali-
ties of that struggle ...we know
just how intensely men hold onto
their power - their ability to
rule and terrify...we know how
much destruction and hatred under-
lies their control. Men have an
enormous amount invested in keep-
ing women down - in maintaining
male perogative and ownership

and monopoly.

We know that in our guts...Dr.
Roberts description of her Emer-_
gency Room experiences serves to
strengthen that understanding ...
it fills us with rage...a rage
that gives us the energy,endur-
ance,and courage to fight. But

.to put this information in their

then too we, as lesbians,become
a little uneasy about this whole
thing...because the abortion

issue is basically a "straight"

it is because this may be your
reply that we get so confused and
nervous. For, in the past, those
of us who have struggled against’
W°man'3 issueoo-and in 3 Way it the destructiveness of this soci-
is kePt that Wayo Oh YES: Our ety have somehow always ended up
SuPP°tt is asked for ‘ but We WON? merely making the world a little

det ahout the kind 0t "S“PP°tt" better for straight people. And
We h3Ve 80tteh in the Past and we have always ended up without
what kind we will get in the fu- any help or support from you

ture when this battle is won (as

it will be) and women who relate

to and identify with men are able
to have a certain amount of con-

trol over their bodies.

The demand for "control over
our bodies" can be a revolution-
ary call to real liberation -
or it can just be a demand to
have the right to decide what we,
as women, can do with our bodies
after the men are finished with
their pleasure...a way of allow-
ing men to do the same thing over
and over again without a second
thought.

What we have not seen is any
suggestion that lesbianism is
even a possible alternative to the
present situation. We realize
that there is an imediate need-
to change abortion laws. But we‘
also know that when change is
sought , the way things are talkec
about - the alternatives that are
suggested and validated - help to
shape a future reality. It simply
is not enough to control the re-
sult of’being subjected to the
power of the male...we are asking
that the women ( most of whom are
"straight"-identified) who are
asking our support, start asking
themselves about their lives...
their "straight-identification".
We are asking the women who put,
together the literature for the
abortion campaign to mention and
encourage lesbianism - to give
addresses,etc., where information
about what the lesbian movement
is all about can be gotten -

when we needed it. When your needs
were met - when your situation

was improved — you were finished
with the struggle... but then per-
haps it is because you have never
been able to admit to yourselves
the reality of the struggle.

And we are afraid of that happen-
ing again...if you do say -"but
that will cloud thingsv..well
then we know just what your
commitment is and to whom...

you will have shown that all you
want is a slight improvement in
YOUR situation ...but that you
are not to be relied on for demand-
ing REAL change - for really chal-
lenging the structures,relation-
ships, the men - who make this
society the human diaster area
that it is.

' You see - we trust our own com-
mitment to that struggle for REAL
liberation - because we have put
our lives on the line...for us
their is no turning back or leav-
ing. We have experienced the re-
sults of rejecting all the priv-
ileges and protection ( as well

as the exploitation) of relation-
ships with males...and we have
become strong ...but if you do
not wish to be mindless breeding
machines...providers of cannon
fodder for future wars... we

also do not intend to expend en-
ergy ...a precious resource with
us these days... and our lives

as cannon fodder for battles which
in the end don't change things
very much ... we no longer are
able or willing to try to extract
legitimacy...respect...tolerance
because we work so hard and fight
so well for your causes... causes
which in the end may turn on us
and destroy us.

letters, and folder,etc. We are,
in effect, asking that women who
are active in the abortion cam-
paign make that campaign part of"
the revolutionary struggle to
REALLY CHANGE THINGS. And we
want to make clear that that does
not just mean some sort of lip-
service...not just a distant
support for the lesbian libera-
tion movement...it means looking
at how you live ...asking your-
self why you relate to men...why
your world moves around them,etc.
You may say - "but that would

detract from our struggle...

if we so much as mention leshian-
ism.the men would never listen
to us...and the important thing
is to have them listen so they
will change those laws..." And

  seH-'- criticism

.PART I
TRYING TO SAY THINGS DIFFERENTLY

Well, it is pretty easy to urge other people to
do some things - but hard to follow it yourself.

In an article in the last issue we criticized cer-
tain things in the movement...namely the abstract
"intellectuality" of some movement papers and we
urged intellectuals to cut through distant language
and get down to feelings and experiences.

We have, since the beginning, been just a little
uneasy about some of the things we have written...
and have spent a lot of time talking about how we
should try harder to use experiences" and weave
our analysis of the experiences into our talking
about the various experiences so that we weren't
just making "ideological" statements. Then we got
a letter from a friend who said that she thought
it was really good that we were trying to talk about
class differences .etc. but that she thought that
our discussion of class seemed removed...abstract..
intellectual Marxism...words but no feeling.

This got us to really thinking about the whole
style of our writing and we went back and re-read
the two issues of SPECTRE. We noticed that in both
issues we would go off now and then ( a lot more
in the first issue)...we would cease talking about
experiences and feelings - the things that gave
us certain viewpoints...certain interpretations
that is everything that led us to the conclusions

- ...and.we would only talk about the conclusions.

For instance even for the articles in this issue’ .
it was really hard...the first draft of the article
about what the movement has done to me and why I
think it is important to be honest about your feel-
ings and to express anger began " We think that
there are dangerous things going on in the women's
movement these days...." which is a far cry from
the final version._

We also noticed that we fell into repeating terms
which had been thrown around the left for years...
we used them all the time and we thought we knew I
what they meant and saw them as_short—hand , but
then we found that every time we got into a discus-
sion about ,say, "class"...we ended up really frus-
.trated and angry. I didn/t have the slightest no-
tion of how my friend Lucy used the term and she
didn't understand me ... we would somehow always
end up arguing about where her parents fit - where
mine fit...where did we belong...and why? I tend
to get hysterical in my head sometimes...you know
the feeling I am sure... the "I-don't-want-to-hear-
anymore-because-something-has-gone-wrong-in-this-
discussion feeling...so I said I thought that we
shouldn't use the term class since we obviously
seemed to have different notions about what it was
all about. That was really hard - and it still
is - not to fall back on the terms. And it was
made a lot harder by a pressure ( from somewhere)
to say things as briefly as possible...for as I
said these terms are catch-all phrases - short-hand
terms.

(When Lucy read this article she said that I was’
doing what I was objecting to... damn,it is hard to
change.) ‘

We got some complaints about the lack of graphics
in SPECTRE...people said that other people didn't "
like to read for more than two inches without a Q?’
break...too much writing...( but damn space costs 45
money and we have a lot we want to get in) and then
Lucy was afraid that we took too long to say things-

she thought we should make things brief...to the
point... ( and she did that because that is what
we are taught all the time)...but hell people
read novels and I haven't seen too many novels with
little breaks in the print every page or so...
it can't be that people are afraid of print...it
must be what is done with the print... I don't
finish heavy abstract articles...they are too bor- ~
ing, and as I said before , I can't understand them)“
anymore...but I read ( or used to) lots of novels..J«
why? Because novels allowed you to enter a whole
world...you follow experiences and are part of a
whole emotional reality. We feel in our gut that
understanding...theories...whatevery you call f
are useless if they don't come out of experiences...ﬂ
you have to start with real conditions...real situa-E
tions...real feelings. So we decided that even tho’ Q
it takes plenty more space we want to talk about W
the experiences and feelings that helped us to grow H
and understand things in new ways...we want to . ‘
bring you along with us as we go through things.So
the articles are longer ...much longer this time-
but we think that they are also better and easier
to read because they are not removed statements...
"presentations" ...whatever one calls the kinds
of articles that are "very political". What we
have come to is a belief that politics and life
are not separate...but that men have made that di- E
stinction for us and we have accepted it up til now..
(see there I go off again....) ‘ j°

As I said- we really had heated arguments about ”
"class"...oh sure I can spout off the classical
definition of class in terms of a groups relation-
ship to the means of production...but what the hell;
does that tell you about those people...about a lotk
of their values, hopes,aspirations,investments? _%
A lot of the jargon may be short-hand terms ..;but*
short-hand is supposed to help you not make it moréw
difficult to understand things. For instance, in pg
one of my classes a few years ago we were taiking M?
"freedom" and it was clear from the mess that each‘
person thought that she and everyone else knew what:
was meant by the term ...but it was also clear that?
each person had a different definition,etc. So ‘
I said that no one could use the term...they had
to spell out what specifically they were talking
about and they couldn't rely on this great word any
longer. Smart-asses that they were they said "the
word we are not supposed to be using" for about 5
minutes - but then they started to struggle to ex-
press what they were really trying to say. We are ,
trying to open things up...and we feel that talking?
about particular attitudes,values,interests,needs 9
and reactions as well as what kind nf neighborhood V
you grew up in - what kind of job your parents had,f
the things that were encouraged or discouraged,‘ ;
who you felt superior to and who you felt intimida-p
ted by...instead of immediately branding something I
one traditional class or another will help us to
begin to see what the dynamics were and are...
and because we are not immediately categorizing .
we may be able to see connections ...see how thingsﬁ
are related. So often we find ourselves just get - %
ting caught up in words...playing with words... f
forgetting that we are talking about a living
reality. We too often bury important feelings and
senses of things under a layer of words that has
lost any real meaning for us.

It's hard to change...and we will slip a lot.

We are most nervous about the increased length of
the articles...I got very depressed last night as
I struggled to write this one - partly because this
particular one seemed to be closer to what we were
trying to get away from...and then it seemed ram-

bling and disconnected (as do all the articles)."'
Each issue is different from the one before... A
but (perhaps this article excepted) I think wehave
made a slight breakthrough. . .  1-)

PART II
.aﬂu-thus»

WHAT WAS WRONG WITH LAST ISSUE'S ARTICLE ON MACHO

As I reread an article I wrote in the last is-
sue of SPECTRE, I felt really upset with parts of
it. Seems like I did get an understanding of "class'
differences in men...but I had no understanding of
WOMEN and our status in the power structure. The
article was on macho...and how a lot of us have

' zeroed in on "lower class" and black men as bein
8

more macho that the big shits who don't have to
dirty their fingers as they go to the slaughter.
__.But then I re-read two phrases - which together-

I were really bad. I said :"I was angry at some white

feminist sisters for the wholesale slaughter they
have done on black men - while they claim the alli-
ance and sisterhood of blck women." I went on to
say that "/racism has often resulted in far greater
tyranny and destruction for women and men of colo -
than sexism...and for white feminists to shove aside
the exploitation of black men by declaring them to
be the enemy is exactly why we, as white women
should be working with white women to expose our
own oppressive attitudes - as well as our own op-.
pression." -

What I realize now is that
********* r «

Lucy started the article and got that far when
we started to talk about what she wanted to say.

0.990:

'When she wrote the first articles in issue #2,
mmshemwas_expressing,anger.at,the kind of thing
‘-that went on in Radicalesbians...that is where

no one would even acknowledge that our privileges
help make it very hard for other people...where
women would not admit that women could be oppressors
too in certain ways. Well, things were calm for
maybe 15 minutes and then all hell broke loose .
We had an hour and a half furiously fighting...
most of the argument centered around the phrase
"white feminist sisters for the wholesale slaughter
they've done on black men."

There are certain points that the articles on
macho made that we think are important ...that
nice university white heterosexual males or corpo-
rate executives, or the ruling families (the econo-
mic and social elite ) are no less macho - are no
less of a threat to us than men without the "breed-
ing credentials" who are very blatant about their
interest in women...in fact those nice,friendly,
white heterosexual males who have the"polish" of
university life...who smile and try to pick you up
at an anti-war rally ( how many women were raped
by friendly radicals at the last Mayday thing?),
or exploit their positions as respected professors
to "seduce" female students, or the executives who
go to country clubs and whose wives gr; the society
page ...but who force their secretaries - one
way or another... well those genteel men not only

\exploit the shit out of women..(in happennings with

them it isNEVER called RAPE... ) but they do much
more damage in the end...because they have much more
power...so the real point of the whole things was
that ALL MEN ARE MACHO... and that we just fail to
notice the violence and brutality of a certain kind
of man because of our own privileges...and also
because women have certain investments in their il-
lusions about certain kinds of men...but in the end
there isn't any difference between all those groups

of men...

For instance - we were sitting in a chemistry
class...in this elite and sacred university...and
the professor said " and now we will talk about
the 'big bang‘ theory of the undverse...(snidely)
...of course that isn't what most of you think
about when you think about a big bang is it?"
Thdse bastards - they never let you forget the
power of the penis...to them it's funny...I wonder
how funny the big bang is to the girl who got it?
You see "educated" and powerful men don't have to
threaten you...they just have to tell jokes to keep
you in your place.

But then things got confused ...and as that
happened - things got very heated in our discussion.
When we began to discuss the "slaughter" phrase -
Lucy was talking about wealthy women in this coun-
try ...I wouldn't admit that any women were in a
position to slaughter... Lucy's feeling is that

I-being rich... and that gets vaguely defined...

is a slaughter of the people who are starving...
and she is right...we all have some share of respon-
sibility of the destruction of human beings which
happens here...and if you don't want to participate
in that - then you have to struggle against the
system... ~

But my reaction - deep in my gut was to say -
well there are so few women of economic significance
in this kountry that you can't really talk about
them ( and they are as responsible as the males then
if they are powers in this ruling class)...but
wealthy women don't have power...it is their hus-
bands money and his values that dominate...these
women are beneficiaries...but not direct manipula-
tors of that power...as far as I am concerned '
they contribute to the slaughter by urging their
husbands\on...giving them sympathy and comfort when.
they are discouraged and all of that.-,they are_
perhaps..."collaborators"...but what I know in my
gut is that all the damage that women do is nothing
compared to the damage men do., Whole cities of
women and children are terrorized everyday and
especially every night...

We cannot deal with our racism or our snobbish-
ness by talking about what happens to black
men or working class men...we can be honest enough,
however, to admit that they are no worse than
middle and upper class men...we can cease to see
them as our SPECIAL enemy...yes they are a source
of fear ...yes, I am filled with rage when they
make their noises and try to intimidate me on the
street...but not because of their blackness or
because of their"working-class" character...
BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN -

What happened in the other article was that
we got rich/poor oppression, white/black oppres-
sion, and the refusal of certain women in the
Movement to admit that women can be racists and
economic and social snobs ,all mixed up together.

It took us both a long time to make any sense
as we tried to express ourselves that night...
and there is no way we can take you back along
with us...it was hard and draining and frankly
I can't remember all that much...but while we
want to say that women don't have the power to
destroy and rape as men do,in this society...
that is women don't have the economic wealth
or control that men do...nor do they have to’
.rape to express their "manhood"... while we
want to say yes...women don't have the direct
power that men have...they 333 beneficiaries...
some women call this "having privileges" and
make a great difference between "power" and
"mere privilege"...now if you are only considering
.what "adult"males can do to women and what "adult"

women can then do to men...ok....but what abou1
the life and death power mothers have over the:
children?...

In all the talking about females and males
I think our position is getting clearer...but
we are also finished worrying about that part.

We can only deal with our racism and our snobbish-
ness by focusing our attention on our reactions
to black women (and we want to make it clear that
that doesn't mean we think that black and white
women should work together...separatism makes
incredible sense to me and we don't expect black
women to waste their time and energy teaching us
whites about our racism) and to women that we see
as really different from us in background,educa-
tion,etc. Women do have certain kinds of power...
they oppress the shit and sometimes the life out
of children... I don't think it is true to say
that any kind of women "slaughter" any kind of
men...but I do think that there is something to
the notion that they slaughter those people who
call them "Mother"...I know that women do most

of the bad things they do to children because

of what this society has done to them...be-

cause they have to put up with so much shit...
and I know that fathers get relieved of a lot of
the blame because they aren't around...don't

want to do it...don't give a damn...etc. -

but when you're catching it...well...

I mean I have understood and felt a tremendous
amount of the oppression of women in this society-
and when far away I can look at a picture of my
mother as a young woman and feel - yes FEEL

the tragedy of her life asga woman...but \
she still did some pretty awful things to me...
And then there is what straight women do to
lesbians... .

We just want to make sure that because we
acknowledge that our saying that some women‘

LAST LETTER ‘HOME’

I sent this letter to my mother today. I hope
it will give some strength to revolutionary les-
bians who read this.

Diane,

There are alot of things that happened in our
house which were kept hidden. I can't uncover"
all of it - to do that, I'd have to tell Joan and
Janet - but you have stopped my letters to them.

-But I'd like to deal with some of it.

within a few days after I got back from Africa,
I called the airlines trying to get away again.

I even drove to New York on day (skipped school)
and tried to get a flight back. I was picked up
by some rabid pigs who warned me that the car‘
registration was overdue...so I had to drive back
to Pennsylvania. You know about the other time I
ran away... ‘

You treated me like a mindless rag-doll. It
was bad enoughrbefore I discovered my independence
but after I realized there was a strong, alive and
fascinating woman inside me - and you wanted to
take that all away, I began to hate you even more.,

You wanted to turn me - to break me into an
“obedient, bright, attractive daughter/wife”.,

But I'm not obedient; I'm alive. I'm not bright;

I don't like to ‘make it‘ in a meaningless race for
empty rewards. I understand and feel my feelings
(a morbid taboo in the intellectual and male world)
And I'm not attractive. I'm not a piece of meat »
to be butchered by men; I'm a stnong lesbian.

And I wear coveralls, soiled with sweat and dirt
from work, and I wear boots - to kick the shit out
of any guy who tries to rape me. . - .

I've protected you long enough from what you'ye
done to me. Actually, I quess I've really been
protecting myself because I knew if I made you
angry by telling you how much ygu_hurt me, that
you would get even angrier and maybe punish me.

But I'm not going to protect you and me any
more. This may hurt for you to hear. This may
make you unhappy or even tear at your mind. But
then maybe you'll try to change just a little.

You have GOT to know the consequences of WHAT YOU
DO. And if you're upset by this letter - you'll

‘ learn that it's not because of my hostility -

BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND BECAUSE OF
WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO YOU.

when I was between II and I3 I thought about
suicide alot. I made a phoney attempt the night
Jim graduated from high school. Nine or ten as-
pirins. I laugh to think of it now.. But not at
the torture that went into doing the only thing I

thought would get a little understanding.

But one day I came home after school. And I
made a real attempt. This time I took every god-
damned pill I could find. A whole bottle of aspirin,
half a bottle of Darvon, and god only knows what
else you had in that cabinet. I was careful not to
eat too much dinner...so that that they'd work...
I told you that I wasn't “feeling well”.

And then I got scared. Scared shitless that I
wouldn't die. So I ran to the cabinet downstairs
in Jim's bathroom and took another half bottle of
aspirin... just to make sure.

You came home several hours later and found »
the empty cabinet.

And then I lied to your surprised question, ”why?”.
I mumbled things about school and the people who
didn't like me. I couldn't tell you that it was
you, I hated you, and I hated your authority. Your
arbitrary, unfeeling power.

I had fantisized about killing you (don't be
surprised, almost all young people do) but I knew
if I couldn't kill you - I'd have to kill myself.

I'm beginning to understand a little now. You
had to work literally 2h hours a day for everyone
else. Full-time work as a nurse - and that was
hard, and you worked late hours - even a double
shift for long periods. Then you had to come home
to your other full-time job. Taking care of us.

.And how draining and dismal to come home, totally

worn out, and have four children entirely dependent
on you (because that's how middle-class kids are
bred). And then still have to give support to a
husband as well (because that's what women are sup-
posed to do for men.)

This is surprising me as I'm writing to you. I
guess I alsays thought that I liked Howard better
than you. But I'm beginning to realize that it was
because he_never had to do all the shit-work - he
wasn't the one who had to “discipline” us or ask_'
us to help him do the dishes after standing on his
feet like you did for 8 or even I6 hours...he didn't
even have to stand on his feet...so of course I liked
him better.

What's surprising me is how much I really feel
for the shit you have to go thru as a working wo-
man, wife, mother...so that you are obliterated by
all the roles you have to fulfill.

But the understanding I'm getting of you can't
lessen the pain I felt. I guess what I'm asking
you to do is not to lacerate yourself with this,
to make it melodramatic or to use this as a masochis-
tic whip to hurt yourself...but for you to understand
the reasons why you've done certain things. YOU ,
have been exploited as a woman, and one of a woman's
few powers or ways in which she's taken seriously-
is by ‘her’ children. But that doesn't excuse the
things you've done. , »

Ask yourself why Howard didn't do the chores a-
round the house that you had to do? why didn't HE
have to give support and listen to YOU...why were
you always being drained by having to understand
five other people? Why was that YOUR lob? Why does
this society make a;woman take 'care' of children
and set norms for parental 'authority'? WHY? So it
can breed good little sex-objects and capitalists?
So that the constant authority shoved in young
people's faces keeps them from being anything but
models of their parents - who went thru the exact
same process... “

when I came back from Africa - I had become
pretty anti-U.S. when I went to private school I
came home with some even stronger attitudes. But
instead of arguing the arguments with me - like
why did I believe in this or that - you'd swear
that you should have never given me the MONEY to
go to Africa - or that you'd stop paying the money
for my tuition if I kept coming home with such
ideas.

After I was raped with a gun behind my back,
did I get sympathy? No. I was like a peice of dirt.
I_was bad because I picked up a male in my car.
why didn't I suspect it?‘ "I must have wanted it”.
Therefore it was my fault. But you and the people
around me raised me to think that men were every-
thing...gods. You get MARRIED to men. You live
thru men. Men are strong and smart and clever and
very loving of "their" women-. 

BULLSHIT! Men rape women. Men rape babies._
Men rape men. Men rape anything, even dead bodies.
But you never told me any of that. Instead you
told me you should never have given me the car -

MONEY.
You manipulated me with'your'money. And when

' washed, we get protection from men - approval

I told you that I didn't want your money for college
Howard screamed at me, “Isn't our money good enough
for you?”

Your money? And was it really the money? Or was
it the manipulation? I grew to hate you and your
money.

Last semester I took a course on the Chinese and
Russians Revolutions. While we were talking about
young people, some long-haired slob said, "They're
just rebelling against Mommy and Daddy”, and I said
“BUT MOMMY AND DADDY AR§_THE STATE!” But men keep
us thinking that politics are distant things that
happen only in Senate Conferences and CIA coups.
And it's important to them to keep us women (and
everyone else they keep as slaves to their egos
and money) thinking that.

Because if we all took the rage we have for
the shit that goes on around us, in our families
and in all of our experiences, and understood them
as political- that hatred would destroy this
system.

So they use abstract words - distant ways of
talking garbage to keep us from even realizing that
it's not some “individual quirk” that causes women
to have so much self-hatred, or not to know who she
is. That it's not some “personal” disagreement
that breeds the hatred young people have for their
parents. And that it's not an 'innate' hostility
that causes lesbians to hate men and straight people
It's the shit that's dumped on us that makes us an-i
gry. And THAT'S political.

Maybe the hardest thing for you is for you to
face your relationship with Howard. (Of course,
as*a lesbian I'm the one who's seen as a “pervert”
or in phonier language...a ”deviant”) ‘But why don't
women look carefully at men and see exactly the
shit they do. Probably because we're so well :r:in-

n
for most women...even identification.

I'm only sorry that this is so difficult for me
to say. That it's still easier for me to tell you
that I wanted to kill you than it is for me to say
that on several occasions Howard climbed in bed with
me and sexually caressed me. But of course it's
easier to be honest with women than men - or even
to be honest about the men who women are tied to.
Men have the power to destroy and punish‘a.lot more
than women do.

The first few times it happened, I pretended I
was asleep. I was pleased that I was getting atten-
tion (and what other kind of attention do men give
women?) Anyway sexuality and men were the biggest
fantasy subjects for “little girls”. It was made
secret, mystical and awesome. And later I found
out why...men and their pricks are so disgusting
that the only way to make them attractive is to
build a whole monument to their”desirabilityP. So
even when we women begin to realize that the food
is rancid, we don't even taste the mold because
our taste buds have been extracted and destroyed.

Of course Howard was supposedly drunk, but why
did you think I would throw him out? was it really
because he was snoring or was it because I began
to resent him after a while? why do you think I
told him to go sleep on the couch and NOT with Joan
or Janet? .

But of course Howard isn't the only one. I know
a number of womeniiho have been approached by their

fathers AND their grandfathers AND their therapists...

I hardly know a woman who hasn't been sexually mo-
lested or violently raped by men.

And there isn't a woman alive who hasn't been
trained to think that “attractiveness” is a nice
body...not good values, hard-work or willingness

to struggle and feel...no, woman's major function
is to be a sexual wet'rag for men. Personal laun-
dress. what else? -
If this letter seems ugly to you, I want you

to know that it isn't just more grief brought to
you by the uppity leg of the family, I want you to
know that whatever pain, harshness and brutality
I've talked about to you is not being created by
me - it is being uncovered by me. It has been
there all along. The family is the kernel of all
forms of oppression. The authority of parents
(the State), man over woman,(sexism), age chauvinism

.cIassism,.racism...

You are no different from almost every other
family in this country. ,Don't think that the same
shit hasn't gone on in those families. That would
deny its political character. What I'm asking you
to do is to change that.

The shit keeps going on because nobody ever tells.
There are too many punishments for people who tell.
Like severance of money, support, or the relation-
ship itself. But I'm willing to face that - be-
cause I believe that there are a lot better things
to enjoy and ways of relating to people which are

galot more constuctive.

I've been living with Jessie
for eight months now. And our love just gets more
and more every day. Human relationships can change..
if they're not based on money and power and oh-
jectification. It's not easy and it takes alot

of energy and struggle.

You CAN make that struggle.

I know there are.

Lucy
**************************************************

A P.S. TO ALL OF THIS.....as I finished typing
up this letter for the paper,I turned to Jessie
and said that it was a good thing I had mailed

lit two hours ago...because if it were still a-
round I would be too scared_to do it...I don't
know how they will react...one fantasy is that
my mother would kill herself...the other more
powerful one is that my father, now that I have

told, would come out here to kill me...I know
I can't take responsibility for what they do...
after all all I did was tell them what they had

done to me all those years...but somehow the
threat of them doing something awful to me seems
so real.
when Jessie told her mother she was a lesbian

she really worried about her mother commiting
suicide...it isso awful that we have learned

to take such care of our parents...always see
their possible pain or anxiety as so much more
important than our own pain that they cause.

But what all of this brings out is just how

much fear there is...how much power parents

can hold over their children...it is real

and not distant to me...cause now I am

waiting to see what happens...and I am

scared...

YES! I'M FILLED WITH
or
lessons from the movement

A while back we decided to take a trip and visit
the AIN'T I A WOMAN? group in Iowa City. We really
like their paper and had lots of good feelings a-
_bout them...so we thought it would be great to ac-
tually get to know them ...and we wanted to split
Ann Arbor. So we started driving...we felt really
fine until we started to get close to Iowa City.
Then we found ourselves getting sicker and sicker.
with anxiety...we started asking ourselves why the
hell we had thought it was such a great idea...af-
ter all by long distance there had been a sense of
community...a feeling of an extended collective...
but what if we didn't like them or they didn't
like us? But by that time we were in front of the
house...did we ever walk up to the door slowly...
and I big chickenshit that I am made Lucy go in
first. Obviously we went in quite shyly -looking
around at all the faces...damn were we nervous. We
all started to talk and ended up talking for about
five hours until 4 am ...we felt good about them
so it was important to us that they liked us too.
But in what I have come to call the movement-1acer-
ate-yourself-after-any-interaction-frame-of-mind _
we started to carefully review the whole evening.
So and so hadn't said a word...oh she seemed to be
enjoying herself as we drank the beer...and she
was very casual in her fantastic girl-scout boots
and the most incredible baggy cut-offs I had ever
seen...but SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING...she probably‘
didn't like us then...probably resented us...yes we
did seem to talk a bit...but there was a lot they
wanted to know about us...there were six of them ‘
two of us...the conversation was perhaps 50/50 - but
there were six of them...it should have been more
equal.We wondered what the "quiet" woman had been
thinking as she sat ther in her silence...maybe if
we ran backhand explained certain things like being
very nervous...afraid of strangers and stuff -well
maybe they wouldn't hate us too much for talking
a lot. It was maybe 5am by then and from the sheer

RAGE

exhaustion of that long drive we finally fell asleep ‘

- but with anxiety about WHAT WE HAD DONE.

The next morning when we woke up Lucy was worried
that I didn't love her as much as I did ( which is
her sure-fire way of expressing anxiety)...and so
we spent anout 30 minite talking about our anxie-
‘ties and what we thought was happening. We’felt a
little better - but then we knew that everyone knew
we were awake...and we had been upstairs a long time
without coming down...maybe they thought we were off-
ish or exclusive,etc. we better get right down...of
course it never dawned on us that we might be able
to just talk to them about our anxieties and stuff.

We all sat around talking again...WHEW!...The si-
lent woman finally said something...she is really

,nice - good sense of humor - a good strong woman...

we talked a bit in the kitchen...I liked her and she
seemed to like us...she wasn't thinking bad thoughts
last night. Why are we so blasted silly?

There was going to be a publication collective
meeting so Francie, Lucy and I went off shopping
while the other women went to the meeting. Francie
is fun to be with...we felt at ease and were laugh-
ing and generally enjoying ourselves as we went from
place to place. I had to leave them for a bit to
go back to the liquor store to look for something
we had forgotten while Francie and Lucy were in the
foodstore. As I walked along I did my usual mulling
thinking about lots of stuff. As I walked back to
meet them I realized certain things. Before the wo-

.such dishonest frustrating places...

- now at that point Lucy and I didn't know what the

man. As». .—.

‘men's movement my life wasn't exactly what you would
call easy...going through the decade between 20 and
30 unmarried isn't an experience that this society
values...there were lots of pressures,anxieties,an-
guish...but I had made my own life and I was pretty
confident about myself - or rather - I pretty much
liked myself and felt relaxed about how I interacted
with people...if I felt that I talked too much one
time - it was something that I would work on...but
it wasn't a.disaster. I didn't climb trees to have

_people like me - I did my fair share of shuffling-
_especially with men - but I felt relaxed and myself

around my female friends ( which was most of my
friends). What hit me as I walked back to the mar-
ket was that I was PETRIFIED! Now I went over every
interaction like Sherlock Holmes trying to figure
out his hardest case...each interaction became a
survival thing ( immediate fears of oncoming schizo-
phrenia) ...I dreaded being with women...trusting
had disappeared...and not just for me...for Lucy
too...if people were friendly to us, we were both
suspicious...and with damn good reason too! Then

ALI thought about how suspicious we had been of the

"quiet" woman ...we had been expecting all those
women to descend on us like harpies...I was try-
ing to understand what created all this fear...
tried to figure out why I would say " and with damn~
good reasons were we suspicious." ,

,I went back to that had happened in several wo-
men's groups that I had been in since the movement‘
really got rolling in Ann Arbor. No one would ever
say the things that really bothered her at a meet-
ing...if you disagreed or felt anger and resentment
that was kept inside...not expressed - real feel-
ings were saved for oneself or for a few close
friends...which meant that in the edn there was
a network of information ( feelings) which circled
each group...you might find out a month or two la-

‘ter that someone who had been smiling and friendly

when you did meet really disliked the way you be-
haved in the group...if you were lucky you finally

heard it from the Derson herself...otherwise you
igrapevine - or even more brutally...meetings are

There was a conference of sorts for "gay" peo-
ple in AA - and we finally left the men and went
up-stairs...things were a little strained...but not
too bad. Then a woman walked in and made several
very snide coments about how it looked like a T-
group and did she hate them...after the discussion
had gone on for awhile - about lord knows what -
she burst in and said that she didn't understand
this role-playing stuff - butch/femme and all that._
hell she was getting at for there was so much anta-
gonism in her voice. My first guess was that she
was a really uptight straight woman who was putting
lesbians down - sr something like that -.at least
someone from the outside...but although I didn't
have the foggiest notion of what she was getting at
I sensed tremndous hostility being generated. What
II really wanted to do was turn to her and say -
"look- I don't know what you're asking,but I sense
a lot of antagonism...why don't we talk about that?"
I either wrote a note or whispered my feelings to
my fried to ask her what she thought I should do,
and in a quick discussion we decided that such ann
approach was not acceptable...you had to be really‘;
understanding...it would embarrass her and put her

.on the spot to have her hostility asknowledged...

so I said nothing. Another woman turned to her

and smiled gently and said that we really didn't
have problems with those roles here. It was only
later that we learned that the woman who asked the
question was a lesbian from Chicago and was invol-

ved in a heavy butch-femme relationship there.
When we heard about her - we died at the "we
don't have that kind of problem here"...and then
after Lucy and I had a very heated argument about
how effective certain women were in the group be-
cause they just always sat and listened and never
disagreed or said anything much about what they
felt and how we alienated people because we would
sometimes blurt out what we really felt and thought,
we decided that we had to be hinest from now on...
not just for our own well-being..but because it

pmust frustrate the shit out of women to have their

feelings ( especially anger) ignored. It is exact-
ly what males do to women all the time...they ig-

. nore the emotional reality of a situation. How
» must it feel to have anger and frustration and

antagonism burst out of you as you ask a simple
question and then to have that met with a nice,s'
sweet, understanding smile...I"d go bonkers after
a while...I would begin to doubt my ability to co-

mmunicate...then I would feel awful about all my
hostility when everyone else was being so nice add

friendly. But the whole situation is bullshit - it
is a denial of what the "angry" woman feels ...and
the "understanding" response_denies the feelings
that you had as you sat there getting so tense be-
cause there was so much antagonism...from all sides
it is a big denial game...it is even the super-
shrink game ...don't interact-..don't react to the
emotion that is being expressed..."Understand it".-
But that denial has crept into every women's*group
I have ever been in..."keep things calm"..."meetings
aren't enjoyable if people argue"...mediate the
tensions...deny other women's anger and your own.
Sometimes it is hard not to hate the women who have
done all that in groups...because they were the ones
who denied you and themselves...and their.denial.
created situations which would finally explode...
and destructively — precisely because it had been.
denied and bottled up so long.

But even as I sit here writing all of this - as
I look back on the above paragraph...something is
slowly beginning to creep into my guts'where before
it had been a removed, distant..."understanding".
Look at the description - look at what happened -
it's the kind of thing that men do to women all
the time - men ignore the anger of women - finding

‘it cute or exciting (sexually),perhaps scarey or

repugnant...if the response is positive - then they
want to make it woth you, - what shit - there you b
are really pissed and this creep wants to make you-
to play smacky mouth and touchy-touchy-feely-feely
It doesn't matter that you are pissed...you are
helpless. Granted the situation is a little differ-
ent - the women-aren't trying to "make"her - but
they come across as super friendly...what is dis-
tressing is~the lack of relationship between the
two reactions...hostility...super-friendliness.

If a man doesn't like the anger - then he ignores
it...I remember how my father used to withdraw when
my mother would get upset ( I got in a hell of a
lot of trouble because I fought back) but my father
used to read or putter around...he totally ignored
her anger until ahe would do something wild to for
force him to acknowledge her...sometimes now I won-
der if she went after me so often preciselt because
I would respond to her anger...when she said some-
thing to hurt - I was hurt,etc. But I tried my fa-
thers way too ...if she hit me I wouldn't acknow-
ledge it...that used to drive her crazy...of course
I had to pay for my stubbornness which is some-
thing most men don't have to do...but what I am try-
ing to make clear is how women have had their emo-
tions ignored... men have done it and now women

are doing it to other women. ('4')

We have just got to begin to be more honest -
with ourselves and with each other - not leave

'the honest expression of your feelings for an after-

the-meeting-coment to you friend(s). It does bad
things to you and to the women you are angry at...
that way no one ever knows what the hell is going
on -so how can anyone do any changing? Also it
breeds distrust...if someone always smiles and is
friendly and then you find out later that they
were mad at you for something you had said or done
at a meeting ages ago...wouldn't you begin to be
suspicious of "friendly" people?

It isn't always easy to break away from our tr
training...learning to express feelings is a hard
thing in this society...and to express anger or
disappointment or disapproval...well that is hard.
Although we feel close to the women in Iowa, New

_ Orleans and Washington, there has been a great deal

of tension here in Ann Arbor. We have been relative-
ly alone...which isn't always the greatest thrill
in the world. There are two women that we really
care for and we were terribly excited when they
started.to stop by for long discussions about the‘
many things that think about and are struggling
with. In fact the two.of us were rather like two
small children who live in an area where there are
no other children - so that they have no playmates.
Children in that situation go crazy when the family
has visitors. WOW! you have someone to play with!
For instance when the four of us went to the pool-
we never let them out of our sight...the conversa-
tion was unbelievable..."look!look at Lucy dive.
Lucy is a good diver isn't she?" "Would you come
swiming with us again?" We were so embarrassed

by our behavior when we talked about it later...
but we understood that we had found our "isolation"
hard at times...and we discussed the whole scene
with them. We have spent more time together - talk-
ing things through - but there was an issue that
deeply divides us...I think we all avoided any con-
tact with that topic , altho'now and then we would
say that there are some things we will have to talk

~about. We all avoided it because it would create

some strain,etc. Well, the other night they were
over and they started to talk about this male
friend of theirs who is getting ripped off in bad
ways - from lots of quarters...and it is a bum
scene - no doubt of that...but they talked about it
for a really long time and they talked about the
people who were helping this guy ( spending lots of
energy and time) - most of them were women. Well,

I sort of got hysterical inside and I knew that
sfter they left I would turn to Lucy and say that I
almost lost my mind when they were talking about
Jim...I would ask her — "why do they put so much
time and energy into men?...I don't understand them
or their politics..." but as I sat there I knew
that I couldn't do that ...my sitting there the rest
of the night without expressing my confusion and
anger would have made the whole interaction one

big lie for I would have either had to smile and
say nothing ( the lie) or I would have been strange
and withdrawn ( confusing). I knew that I respected
these women...that they were important to me...and
that nothing good could possibly come of avoiding
the area of disagreement any longer...so I decided
that even if it meant creating - (no change"creat-
ing" to "uncovering" - because the tensions,anger
and disagreement were all there - it was merely

a question of whether they were faced or not -

we don't create tension by doing things like that

- we merely bring them out into the open where at
least something can happen...) real difficulties (5%
and tensions that would mean that they wouldn't
feel like coming over and talking anymore (and that

was valued by us)...it had to be done. We couldn't
pretend that we didn't strongly disagree with them
for spending so much time and energy for a male.

So I raised the whole issue...it was hard for every-
one there and it was not resolved...now there are
awkwardnesses...we have no idea of what is going to
happen ...but I do know that change,respect,trust,
struggle ...are only possible when people are honest
with each other. If stuff is held in ,it begins to
fester...to build resentment. Most of us hate our-
selves when we shuffle and so added to all of this
is the self-hatred one feels when one is a great
big chickenshit...And when I am not being complete-
ly honest with people, I get uncomfortable around
them - and it isn't their fault...it is just that

I am so damn aware of what I am holding back and
aware that I am giving them a false impression

that I can't begin to relax and interact...and the
other people don't know all this - but they usually
pick up my uptightness - my tension...and they
don't know what the hell is going on..,I,afterall,
haven't really said anything...all they know is
that they sense my ill at ease and later that I
begin to ignore ...no ...avoid them...and all
because I feel bad because I know that I have
difficult things to say to them ...until I am
honest about points of disagreement I just

get the creepy-crawlies around the people that
I’disagree with...because I am giving them the
wrong impression...damn it that is what shuffling
is all about...and-damn it I hate to shuffle -

I just can't stand myself when I do it... but

my "friends" don't know that it is because of how,
I feel - because of something I did or didn't do
that I am uneasy with them...and pretty soon they
will start to think that they have done soething.
The destructive results of not getting things out

_ is endless.

We are trying to become more honest...and we know
how hard it is...we know that it is made fantasti-
cally easier by just the support of one other per-
son. We have tried and will continue to try to get
out what we think in the paper - not pulling out‘
at the last minute to hide behind"niceness” or
"gentility" or the necessity for a false front of
"unity"...so much of that we think is disgustingly
patronizing "understanding"...we understand the
reasons for lots of things ...but explanations are
NOT excuses...sure certain men in this society have
been humilated and oppressed - but goddamn it when
they pass that oppression along by raping women..
well that just isn't acceptable...it is not excus-
able...and they are going to have to stop...if only
because women will finally band together into anti-
rape squads to beat the shit out of men who mess.
with women that way - and that means ANY male...no .
matter what political belief,economic class,or what
race. Certain women have been oppressed - but they
also bring a lot of shit down on other women...
and that will change too... and in any of those
battles - when someone is ripping off someone
else - well as the saying goes - our energy goes
with the oppressed and not the oppressor...I am
damn sick and tired of being super nice and under-
standing to women who have known nothing byt enor-
mous privilege all their lives...and-if discussing
how they oppress black women with their racial
attitudes, "less-polished" women with their snobish-
ness , oppresses them and hurts their feelings...
well one thing is clear to both of us...our energy,
our sympathy, and our willingness to provide sup-
port is directed to the women who-are really being
ripped off. Whew! That little bit wasn't even on
what I was copying...it burst out of me as I got
closer to my feelings...as I am more and more able

to feel the rage ...and a rage that has great cre-
ative power. The men who rule this society...

the people who have enormous investments in this
system...well they don t want us to get angry...
cauz once you start letting out your anger...well
...it may take you a long time to direct it right-
but once you are able to not only let it out but
let it out at the real destroyers...a lot of things
can happen...

And what have we as women been trained to do?...
you guessed it...smooth things over...make every-
one comfortab1e.We have been trained to spend enor-
mous amounts of energy protecting people...keeping
things from them- because it would be hard for them.

We have all pretended that we liked large numbers
of people ( for our parents,boyfriends,friends,etc)
and then given phoney reasons for why we didn't
want to go out ...why we couldn't talk to them

on the phone, etc. But even if these people don't
know what is really going on - they are picking up
vibes- the tension - the reluctance...they know
something is wrong...but we have been trained to
deny that anything was wrong.."why no - everything
is just fine...why do you ask...I don't know what
makes you think that." But we live and survive be-
cause of our ability to smell out things...our
ability to feel something in the air...it isn't
magical ...it comes from noting small things,etc.-
but if you really sense that something is wrong
and ether people completely deny it - you begin

to distrust that ability to know that something

is going on... oh I make no claim that we correct-
ly interpret everything...but I think most women
can sense when there has been a shift in emotions-
but when people insist that you are wrong...because
they want to keep things smooth... well that is
really destructive...We owe it to ourselves and

to each other to start being honest about what we
think and feel.

But then, being straight-forward is said to ali-
enate people. We are angry and we try to get that
out ( we also give lots of support too) so there
are those who say we constantly alienate people.
One woman said that our paper was awful_- that
it was so hostile and angry that EVERYONE just h
hated it - just as they hated us...we were told
that we "turned"people off because we were so "hard-
line" ( about separatism,the need to deal-with our
privileges,etc.) we were told that we weren't _
doing anything of value in the women's movement -
we were told that we were mean and not sensitive
to how difficult it was for people to change when

we weren't respectful and obedient to a woman who -—~~

.used.her university position to kick.us~ouE“6f the.
pool~becau§§W$he,didn't lfk€”our attitude when we

" obje8?Ed*to a blatantly sexist rule she initiated-

a rule which she was finally forced to change -

_ but we got really pissed when she kicked us out

because she didn't like our attitude when we broke
an illegal rule...and we didn't say "please,we
promise to be good now...please let us back in."

He worry about all these comments...and try to

see if they are true...after the woman said that
our paper was alienating and hated, I wanted to
take the supporting letters we've received from
women who picked up a copy of the paper somewhere-
I wanted to run over and say "SEE... there are
women - and lots of women ...women in struggle

who relate to our paper." I knew that the intensi-
ty of wanting to say "SEE" was tied-up to gnawing
self doubt...it is hard to be catching shit from
people...it is hard not to collaspe under the pres-
sure to be super-friendly and "understanding" -

it is difficult to believe in yourself and what you

_/

are doing and to have the strength to keep strug-
g1ing...but Those Women, Ain't I A Woman?, Lynn and
Phyllis do give us the spurt of energy and encourage-
ment that we need when we get low. For in the end

- even tho' there are short-range costs attached-

.'..._ _. ; Jug./‘._.e..'.

we_kngw ( and that will generate antagonism because
no one is supposed KNOW anything...in this country
or in the movement...after all everyone has a right
to her own opinion...you never say you"know"...on-
ly that you think perhaps this may be the case but 1
of course it is only a suggestion and I don't want I
to impose my little beliefs on you and so if it is 1
ok with you "I think..." ) yes,we know that honesty '
in the expression of you ideas and your‘ feelings 1
is the most important thing in our relationships I
and in our interactions...change just doesn't ‘
happen the other way. -I ' \ 1

For instance , when we wrote the article about I
abortions - it would have been easy just to write '
a straight abortion thing...reproducing what we 1
got from the National Coalition Office - but we !
have disagreements and concerns...What we did was '
try to express our way of relating to the abortion 1
issue -how we as lesbians felt about it and under- ‘
stood it. We soon realized that we were uneasy about I
the support that was being sought from lesbians...
and remembered that we are always helping every-
body else's cause...but a lot of women kn the move- I
ment get very upset if you ask them to discuss
lesbianism. And we are sick of that dynamic...so
we voiced that anxiety and found ourselves letting
out some of the anger we had because of what has

‘happened to lesbians in the movement struggle.

Women in the National Coalition Office may not be
happy with the article...probably they would have I
liked itpa lot better if it had not had anything ‘
in it beyond the discussion of the abortion issue.

And better still - they would have liked us for

grunning the story ("lesbians are really quite nice Ago
.you know") but what or who would have changed? lea

Would they have known what they were asking us to
do and that there were reasons for us to be a little
Wary of their request to join them? Now they know
some of the mixed feelings lesbians have towards‘
certain battles...and why. What they will do about
it all is something we will have to wait to see

I have come to understand myself better in the

last month. I have learned what has been done to me __g§
and what my real struggles are. I learned that . ~~i

even tho' I stubbornly refused to be my mother's’"
dream-daughter - frilly,help1ea3"aﬁd passive...
even tho_I_Survivéd that pressure from family

.and from everything else that surrounded me...

I did not escape without being crippled. What was
done was even more clever than molding you into

A PLASTIC WOMAN...what was done was to teach me to
turn my anger inward...to be afraid of it...to re-
ject it ...what they did was constipate me with

my feelings...with my anger. But those days are
over...I still have trouble getting it out and the
way women respond to anger doesn't make it any eas-
ier to get it out...but we have begun and so have
others - and the day will come when we can be honest,
angry women - and we will be able to direct our
anger where it should be directed...and the day

that happens we will have a revolutionary movement
like no one has ever seen... '

Sharon's poem to Joan (p.ﬂQ) says it so well

"L.. we saw we had to fight --

to change, to love, even to survive
without the rage
we cannot destroy the past .f

without the joy 
we cannot build the future ..."
