 WH6T IS THE
§ NEW DEAL? A

independent organization of the workers. These things are
to be achieved through the “industrial codes” worked out
by the employers and given the force of law by the signature
of Roosevelt, and supported when and where necessary by
the A.F. of L. and the Socialist Party who have already
entered wholeheartedly into this pretty scheme.

In the labor section of the “New Deal” program is to be
seen the clearest examples of the tendencies to fascism.
This is an American version of Musso1ini’s‘ “corporate state,”
special state-controlled labor unions closely tied up with and
under the direction of the employers. Here we have also
the sharpest American example of the role of the Socialist
Party and trade union bureaucracy as “social fascists,” as
bearers among the masses of the program of fascism, as
those who pave the way for the establishment of fascist con-
trol over the workers. For the working class, the Indus-
trial Recovery Act is truly an industrial slavery act. It is
one of the steps towards the militarization of labor. It is
a forerunner of American fascism.

The ﬁght against the Industrial Recovery Act—How
shall we organize it? This is not a simple task. The
illusions about the New Deal as a road back to prosperity
are still strong among broad masses. To expose and dis-
perse these illusions will require more experience and above
all requires the active, ceaseless, careful1y—thought-out in-
tervention of the Communist Party. These illusions are based
not only upon the “newness” of the Roosevelt regime, upon
the demagogy of Roosevelt, but also upon two other im-
portant factors. These are, ﬁrst: the appearance of “con-
crete results,” as they say, in the increase of industrial pro-
duction that is now taking place, and second: the active
efforts of the A.F. of L. and the Socialist Party in support
of the Roosevelt program.

We should be very clear about the signiﬁcance of the in-
crease in industrial production. It has been a big increase
in certain industries. It would be the greatest stupidity to

deny this -fact. It has, however, been greatly exaggerated
in the capitalist press. What is really important is that in

_most industries rationalization and speed-up have made such

strides in the past year that even with increased produc-

tion, the total number of workers employed is less than it _

was a year ago.

Increased production is not enough to increase employ-
ment. A classical example of this was brought out in con-
nection with the Ford automobile plants, where production
has increased 10 per cent over last year, and the number
of workers declined by 20 per cent. This is a striking ex-
ample of the truth, now generally admitted even by the
capitalists, that even the return of full capacity of produc-
tion in all industries would not put the unemployed back
to work but would leave eight to ten millions permanently
unemployed. When the masses understand this fully, and
realize that this will determine their conditions even if they
are among the lucky ones who get jobs, then a large part
of their illusions about the New Deal will be undermined.

Further, the increase in production does not represent an
improvement in the consumption market. On the contrary,
many of the most important indexes of consumption show
a decline. Thus, department store sales for June, one of the
most important indications in the retail market, declined
5 per cent from a year ago. But if consumption is not in-
creasing (and it is not), then whence comes the demand
that brought about increased production? Equally clearly,
this production is for a speculative market caused bylin-
ﬂation.

With the value of the dollar declining, that is, with in-
creasing prices, all the speculators and proﬁteers are piling
up goods in warehouses to speculate on the higher prices.
Accumulated stores are increasing. In other words, over-
production, a greater amount of commodities than can be

' 11

absorbed in the effective market, is more pronounced than
ever. The stopping of inﬂation would immediately send the
market crashing into a deeper crisis than ever before. That
is why Roosevelt was ready to insult every imperialist na-
tion and broke up the London Economic Conference rather
than stabilize the dollar. But even continued inﬂation, con-
tinued indeﬁnitely, cannot hold up this false market for
more than a time. Sooner or later, probably sooner, the
accumulated stores of materials will break down this specu-
lative market. The indeﬁnite storing of unlimited quantities
of unused goods cannot continue. Even this limited revival
of production, produced by inﬂation, cannot last very long.
The end will be worse than the beginning.

The American Federation of Labor and the Socialist Party
are playing a very important part in building up and sup-
porting the mass illusions about Roosevelt. The bourgeoisie
is very anxious that the masses shall not resist their attacks.
Workers and farmers, however, will ﬁght back. They will re-
sist the attacks, (this is already shown in the rising strike
wave) thus making it difﬁcult for Roosevelt to put across
his program. The administration can be forced at least to
make concessions to the mass resistance. Roosevelt’s prob-
lem is how to keep the masses from struggle. His most
valuable helpers in this task are the American Federation
of Labor and the Socialist Party.

The A. F. of L. unconditionally accepts the Industrial Re-
covery Act and has pledged itself not to allow members to
strike but to accept whatever decisions are made by the
employers and Roosevelt without protest. These leaders co-
operated with the bosses in working out the codes, as in the

textile industry, with a wage scale lower than the present _

average, and 35 per cent below four years ago. They make
glowing promises to the masses of beneﬁts under the Indus-
trial Recovery Act if only they will join the American Fed-
eration of Labor. Great recruiting campaigns _are being‘
carried on ; the workers are led to think that they are join-

ing a “trade” union” which will conduct “collective bargain-
ing” for higher wages. The workers do not yet realize that
the “wage codes” are not even an imitation of collective
bargaining, not to speak of struggle, and that these “trade
unions” are not a means of action but a means whereby_em-
ployers obtain guarantees against any action on the work-
ers’ part.

,. The Socialist Party has been very active in support of
the New Deal. Already in the ﬁrst days of the Roosevelt
regime, Norman Thomas and Morris Hillquit paid a formal
visit to Roosevelt in the White House, were received by him,
and afterwards issued a public statement to the newspapers
praising Roosevelt and recommending his program to the
workers. At the recent meeting of the Socialist Party Na-
tional Executive Committee at Reading, Pa., it was decided
to cast their lot without reservation with the American Fed-
eration of Labor in putting over the industrial slavery law.

The “left” reformists, the Musteites, are wavering between
the position of the Socialist Party and the class struggle,
under pressure of their own radicalized followers. ‘They
are forced, in order to hold their following, to pay lip service
to the united front and even sometimes to take practical
steps into concrete struggles.

The task of the Communist Party is to win these masses
for clear and unhesitant policies. The attack on the work-
ers’ standards of living and the defeat of -these attacks, the
breaking down of the illusions of the masses about the New
Deal, these things require exposure, as also the leaders of
the A. F. of L. and the Socialist Party. The social—fascists
are the shock troops of ﬁnance capital in pushing the New
Deal into the camp of the workers.

The ﬁrst stage in arousing and organizing Workers against
the industrial slavery law is to thoroughly understand what
it means in actual life and explain this to the broadest pos-
sible number of workers. Even this very necessary educa-

tional work, however, requires such activity as to make the

feature of it, and Mr. Allen was really outraged that Mac-
Mahon should come before the public hearings and oppose
What he had helped to work out. -

This revealing little incident is partiéiilarly valuable and
should be carried to every Worker in every industry. We
must make use of this incident very Widely, because in the
future We can expect that this will not be repeated." Un-
doubtedly Mr. Allen and all the other commissioners were
called into private conference and it was explained to them
that they must not expose the collaboration of the A.F. of L.
leaders behind the scenes, but give them liberty to make a
fake opposition in the public hearings. Mr. Allen Will under-
stand the next time why MacMahon speaks publicly for
something different in the open than he does behind the
scenes.

It is also necessary to learn concretely how to expose the
maneuvers of the Socialist Party, typiﬁed by Norman
Thomas. Mr. Thomas is one of Roosevelt’s most valuable
assistants in putting across the New Deal. Of course, this
does not mean that Thomas comes out openly to endorse it.
If he did, then he would be no more valuable than any of
Roosevelt’s direct secretaries. On the contrary, he says he
is opposed to the underlying philosophy of this Bill, but
goes on to say that these politicians in Washington are so
stupid, so poorly prepared to draw up a bill that would
really execute the wishes of the big industrialists, that they
left a lot of loopholes for the Workers to change it into
something entirely different from What the capitalists in-
tended it to be. Mr. Thomas assures the Workers that they
can turn this law into something for their own advancement
instead of the enrichment of the capitalists. ‘These golden
opportunities, Thomas assures the workers, much more than

offset the bad effects which the bill is intended to have in

driving down the standards of the workers, destroying the

right to strike and herding them into company-controlled

unions. This propaganda of Thomas and the Socialist Party
16

is accompanied by declarations of 100 "per cent cooperation
with the A.F. of L. which openly supports the bill in its
entirety.

In the shops -the ﬁght against the “New Deal” must be ex-
pressed in terms of the immediate Working conditions in the
shops, the smallest issue, the question of wages and hours,
making use of every special circumstance that arises out of
any situation to raise these demands among the Workers and
organize them in struggle for these demands. That means
making the fullest possible use of every step of the govern-
ment and of the employers in applying the Industrial Re-
covery Act to transform it into the opportunity for the
mobilization of the masses against the application of ‘the
Recovery Act. That means making use of the formulation
of the codes by the employers and the hearings upon these
codes by the government to bring the demands of the Work-
ers will include the T.U.U.L. arid various unions afﬁliated
demands among the broadest masses and rouse them to ex-
pressions of support and to concrete organizational measures.

Second, this_means -taking some steps much further than
we have so far. Steps should be taken in the drawing in of
the masses of workers into the formulation of their demands,
spreading them, broadcasting them among the masses be-
fore they are presented in public hearings. .

Third, it must be made very clear that while the central
attention is given to crystalizing organization in the shops,
the building up of the revolutionary trade unions, that in
every case where the employers are carrying through their
company union system, the system of employee represen-
tatives organized by the companies, that we by no means
boycott these elections but that we put forward, encourage
and lead the most active and best elements, our members and
sympathizers and everyone that we can reach, to put for-
ward our demands in these elections conducted in the shops
and within these systems of employee representation, ﬁght
for the codes and demands that we Work out.

and public works. It must be said that we have not given
sufficient attention to this. This work has tremendous possi-
bilities and it is directly connected with the shop problems
and especially with the building of the trade unions. It is
precisely the forced labor camps and public works that con-
stitute one of the most direct and easily recognizable blows
which the capitalists are making against the workers’ con-
ditions, hours and wages, especially in the basic industries.

The central point in this ﬁght is the demand and struggle
for trade unions wages on all public works, the ﬁght against
forced labor and for the establishment of trade union wages.
In the forced labor camps it is also the ﬁght for cash pay-
ments, the elimination of all payments in kind and the with-
holding of money for long periods. We must put forward
against the government plans for public works our proposals,
formulating deﬁnite proposals which we can place before
the masses for a public works program, to provide housing
for the workers, hospitals, schools, etc., as against the gov-
ernment proposals which are directed towards military pur-
poses or the services of big corporations.

We must develop in the forced labor camps the struggle
against the military regime within them. We must make
a ﬁght for self-government, the regulation of these camps
by elected committees Within them to break down the military
discipline. We must make a struggle for better food, housing
and sanitary conditions. We must make mass exposures of
the conditions that exist in these labor camps by letters from
inside the camps, by leaflets based upon these inside ex-
posures, the concretization of these exposures in deﬁnite re-
ports by those inside the camps, by sending delegations
elected on the outside to go into the camps, by holding meet-
ings -to report on these conditions and so forth. And ﬁnally,
by directing the efforts within the forced labor camps towards
large-scale strikes to realize these demands.

Among the unemployed masses, the struggle is being ex-
ceptionally sharpened by the latest phase of the “new deal,”

21

and we. must develop-a counter-oifensive through the,unem-
ployed organizations, developing a real mass fight" against
those relief cuts which are taking place almost everywhere
throughout the United States today, intensifying the ﬁght
for cash relief, against the system of food vouchers, etc.
We must organize on a broader scale against evictions which
now in the summer months have again greatly intensiﬁed.
The problem of evictions is becoming an acute mass prob-
lem again. We must give more attention to the struggle
for conditions in the ﬂop houses. We have largely ignored
the fact that this summer when relief generally is being cut
down the ﬂop houses are growing, the number of inmates
is swelling and there is a deﬁnite program to force larger
numbers who formerly got relief into the flop houses. It is
one of -the essential features of the struggle against the
“New Deal” that we shall counter this move by real move-
ment among these large masses, who have been forced into
the flop houses by the cutting down of relief.

Further, we must give more attention to the development
of the work for taxation of the big companies to pay relief
to the workers discharged from the factories; It should be
recalled what an important part is being played by mass
resentment against Ford’s throwing of the tax burdens onto
the small people, the home owners, property owners and the
masses in Dearborn. This has roused the greatest impetus
to struggle against Ford and has created the conditions
whereby a real powerful movement has emerged in the city
of Dearborn. The same thing can be developed in every
company town, provided we study every case very carefully,
develop the issues very concretely and prove to the masses
that we know what we are talking about, and not come with
general phrases and slogans.

At the present moment we must very sharply bring for-
ward a demand of the unemployed for the diversion of war
funds for unemployment relief. At the present moment
when hundreds of millions of dollars have been appropriated

for the construction of warships and other military purposes,
this is most important for tying up the struggle for the un-
employed masses with the anti-war struggle, deepening the
understanding of the whole class struggle.

We must make much more effective use than we have
hitherto of the fact that the government, while cutting down
the funds for unemployed, is increasing tremendously the
direct subsidies to the big capitalists. We must follow up
every development of the operations of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation and, for example, every time another
$50,000,000 is given to the banks of Detroit, the comrades
must make known through the masses of Detroit, that while
the government is giving these tens and twenty millions of
dollars to the banks, Detroit relief has been cut down below
what it was in 1931. The demand to divert these government
subsidies to the relief of the unemployed is an issue on
which we can really rouse the masses. We must take much
more energetic steps to bind together the struggle of the
employed and unemployed, to bring expressions of support
from the workers in the shops to every struggle of the un-
employed, even if it is only a resolution or leaﬂet. Even the
smallest expression will grow and develop into something
bigger. At the same time, we must more carefully and
more systematically and energetically bring the unemployed
Workers into active participation in every struggle that takes
place in and around the shops-in support of the demands of
the employed workers.

First, it must be understood that fascism grows naturally
out of bourgeois democracy under the conditions of capitalist
decline. It is only another form of the same class rule, the
dictatorship of ﬁnance capital. Only in this sense can one
say that Roosevelt is the same as Hitler, in that both are
executives for ﬁnance capital. The same, however, could be

said of every other executive of the capitalist state. To label '

everything capitalist as “fascist” results in a destroying of
all distinctions between the various forms of capitalist rule.
If we should raise these distinctions to a level of differences
in principle between fascism and bourgeois democracy, this
would be falling into the swamps of social fascism. But to
entirely ignore these distinctions would be tactical stupidity,
would be an example of “left” doctrinairism.

Second, the growth of fascist tendencies is a signal of
weakening in the rule of ﬁnance capital. It is a sign of
deepening of the crisis, a sign that ﬁnance capital can no
longer rule in the old forms, it must turn to more open, more
brutal, ruthless and terrorist methods, not as the exception,
but as the rule for suppression of the population at home
and preparation for war abroad. Fascism is preventative
counter-revolution, an attempt to head off the rising revolu-
tionary upsurge of the masses.

Third, fascism'is not a special economic system. Its econo-
mic measures go no further in the modification of capitalist
economic forms than all capitalist classes have always gone
under the exceptional stress of war and preparations for
war. The reason for the existence of fascism is to protect
the economic system of capitalism, private property, the
means of production, the basis of the rule of ﬁnance capital.

Fourth, fascism comes to maturity with the active ‘help
of the Socialist Parties (the parties of the Second Interna-
tional), who are those elements within the working class
that we describe as social-fascist because of this historic
role. Under the mask of an ostensible opposition to fascism,
they in reality pave the way for fascism to come to power,

disarm the workers, bind the workers -to the wheels of the
fascist chariot by means of the theory of the “lesser evil,”
tell the workers that they would be unable to seize and hold
power, create distrust in the revolutionary road by means of
slanders against the Soviet Union, throw illusions of democ-
racy around the rising forces of fascism, break up the in-
ternational solidarity of the workers, support the nationalist
policies of their own bourgeoisie—and carry out all this
treachery under the banners of “socialism” and “Marxism.”
In America, this role is played by the Socialist Party, the

“left” reformists and the A. F. of L. bureaucracy.

The development of Roosevelt’s program is a striking il-
lustration of the fact that there is no Chinese wall between
democracy and fascism. Roosevelt operates with all of the
arts of “democratic” rule, with an emphasized liberal and
social-demagogic cover, quite in contrast with Hoover, who
dispensed largely with these arts and was openly reactionary.
Yet behind this smokescreen Roosevelt is carrying out more
thoroughly and brutally even than Hoover, the capitalist at-
tack against the living standards of the masses at home and

. the sharpest national chauvinism in foreign relations.

Under the “New Deal,” we have entered a period of the
greatest contradiction between the words and deeds of the
heads of government.

Hoover refused the bonus to the veterans and called out
the troops against them, causing Hushka and Carlson to be.
killed. Roosevelt gave the veterans a camp and food and sent
his wife to meet them instead of the troops—but he not only
denied them the bonus, he also took away half of their dis-
ability allowances, about $500,000,000 per year.

Roosevelt’s internationalist phrases have only served to co-
ver the launching of the sharpest trade war the world has
seen, with the United States operating on the world market
with a cheapened dollar, i.e., carrying out large scale
dumping. ‘ 0

biggest capitalists of all, Morgan, Otto Kahn, and others,

who have gone for years without paying any income taxes.

Economy program: While new taxes are piled up and new
billions of dollars given to the banks and trusts, “economy”
is the rule for all government expenditure that reaches the
masses or the little fellows. The government set the example
for the capitalist class as a whole with wholesale wage cuts
of its employees, with rationalization, mass discharges, etc.
The war veterans have their disability allowances cut $500,-
000,000; unemployment relief is substituted by the forced
labor camps; social services are heavily slashed or discon-
tinued altogether.

Farm program: While millions starve for lack of food,
the government turns its energies to cutting down farm
production. Growing cotton is being plowed under by the
direction of the government. A 30 per cent -tax is placed
on bread’ in order that the farmers shall get at best the
same proceeds for the small amount of wheat. Those farm-
ers, in the most favorable case, will still only maintain their
former bankrupt situation, while the masses will have less
bread at higher prices. The mortgage holders will absorb
the great bulk of the government subsidy. This year’s wheat
crop already in the hands of the speculators and bought
from the farmers at 25 cents, will sharply rise in prices
with enormous proﬁts for the speculators, but by the time
the farmers will get 80c to $1 for his new crop, inﬂation,
cheapening of the dollar, will wipe out his gains and what-
ever he has left will go to the mortgage holder anyway; i.e.,
to ﬁnance capital, banks, etc. Farmers will be at even a
greater disadvantage in buying industrial products, monop-
olist prices of which are sharply rising. The allotment plan

is used to attempt to divide the workers from the farmers-

and set them in sharp rivalry. The masses, including the
farmers, pay all the bills.

Military and naval preparations: The wild commercial
war on the world markets, sharpened to an enormous degree-.

by the "falling value of the dollar, has already disrupted
the London Economic Conference and brought all the impe-
rialist antagonisms to a critical point. The government
which carries out this bandit policy abroad, while driving
down the living standards of the masses at home, should
logically go heavily armed. An inevitable part of the “New
Deal” is, therefore, tremendous building of new battleships,
cruisers, new kinds of poison gases and explosives, new
tanks and other machinery of destruction for the army, new
military roads, increase of the armed forces, and increased
salaries for the officers. “Industrial recovery” is hastened
by working the war industries overtime. Such war prepara-
tions have never been seen since 1917.

Militarization of labor: The most direct and open part
of the program for militarization of labor is the forced la-
bor camps with the dollar-a—day wage. Already some 250,-
000 workers are in these camps. This forced labor has
several distinct aims: (a) it sets the standard of wages to-
wards which the capitalists will try to drive “free” labor
