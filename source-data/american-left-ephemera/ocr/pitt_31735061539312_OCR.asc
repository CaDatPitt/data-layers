H/\R0lD l. ICKES

SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR

To the 2nd

V American Slav Congress

   

Mr. Dewey says that he wants to get the record
straight. There is nothing to prevent him. But it is
just as well to set it straight for him.

REPUBLICANS USE BIGOTRRY

Mr. Dewey thinks that Labor Unions are good unions
if they support him. Those unions are bad that are
opposing him. Take the case of Mr. Sidney Hillman.
When Mr. Dewey ran for District Attorney, Mr. Hill-
man’s union made a contribution to him of $5,000,
the largest of the campaign. Mr. Dewey liked it so well
that he passed his plate back for a second helping but
now that Mr. Hillman is suggesting -that the members
of the CIO contribute One Dollar apiece to the cam-
paign fund of the candidate of their choice—Frank1in
D. Roosevelt—he is a danger to our country.

I don’t care whether Mr. Dewey likes Mr. Hillman
or not. But neither do I care for making speeches and
hurling epithets at Mr. Hillman merely because he
doesn't think that Mr. Dewey would make a good Presi-
dent. And, least of all, do I like the issue of race and
religion that has been raised in connection with Mr.
Hillman. Achap by the name of Brownell, who seems

to be Mr. Dewey's campaign manager, and others clo-se ii

to him have been doing this. It is too bad that the
Republicancandidate does not seem to be able to put
in his place Mr. Brownell who keeps referring to Mr.
Hillman by such expressions as “Russian born,” or
“born in Lithuania,” that are not any more proper than
they are politically decent.

All of which means that Brownell’s pious promise to
keep racexissues out of the campaign does not amount
to more than certain other promises with which we have
been regaled. Racism is an ugly, shameful thing that
no self respecting political manager would resort to.. It
is something that a candidate should publicly rebuke.

For Mr. Brownell’s information, it may be said that A

millions of Russian born soldiers have shed Russian

10.

 

 

blood during the last four years in our common cause.
thereby saving millions of American born boys from
the same. heroic fate. When our draft boards call up
young Americans, if they are able—bodied, they are taken
and sent to the four corners of the earth to ﬁght for
American liberty, regardless of where they may have
been born. I recommend to Mr. Dewey that he instruct
his Mr. Brownell that Americanism is a matter of the
heart. It is a state of mind and has nothing to do with
birth or accent. He might say further to Mr. Brownell
that it is better to be a foreign born American than an
American born foreigner, like Bertie McCormick or
Ham Fish or Stephen Day.

DEWEY’S “LOVE” FOR LABOR

But while Governor Dewey does not like Mr. Hillman
any more, he willingly accepts the support of Mr. John
L. Lewis. Curiously enough Mr. Dewey does not know

whether the Chicago Tribune has endorsed him nor _

does he know the whereabouts of Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Dewey, who ﬁnds his ardor for labor mounting
in exact ratio to the approach of Election Day, has
pledged himself to vest greater powers in the United
States Department of Labor and, also, to appoint, if
only he might have the chance, a Secretary of Labor
from the ranks of labor. '

He has given no intimation as to who this strong
man of labor is going to be. It may be that he sees
several likely ﬁsh in the pool and hopes that more than
one will rise to his lure. Now Mr. Dewey has been more
than generous in giving President Roosevelt advice
about his cabinet and I am not going to let him outdo
us in generosity. So I will make some observations that
are just as gratuitous as his have been. I do not want
to seem to be intruding and I hope that he will take my
remarks in the same spirit in which I have taken his.

Mr. Dewey, of course, with his great perspicacity,
realizes that it won’t be an easy job to ﬁnd the right

11 '

 

 
  

man for Secretary of Labor. And, in all honesty, I may
interpose that, if I should experience the surprise of
seeing him elected, I will want him to have the strongest

possible cabinet. No President in our history will more.

greatly need a strong cabinet.

PEGLER . . . DEWEY . . .

And here is where I come in with a helping hand.
I am about to suggest a man in the belief that he will

-meet with the instantaneous and cordial approval of

Mr. Dewey. The man in question is-admired by Mr.
Dewey and his admiration is reciprocated to the degree
that he can admire anyone, except himself. He is an
expert on labor matters, on which he has written ex-
haustively and authoritatively. At this very moment,
according to my information, he is on the trip that
Mr. Dewey has made to woo the West. I suggest as a
“natural” for Secretary of Labor in the Dewey cabinet

that we can at least play with in our imaginations none Z

other than Mr. Westbrook Pegler, an original member
of the "newspaper guild of the CIO, a champion of
labor, a journalistic knight, sans -peur and sans reproche
—-a.nd “sans” a good deal else besides. Mr. Pegler has

the additional qualiﬁcation which I understand Mr. ,

Dewey insists upon in his subordinates in that he has
already learned to sneeze whenever Mr. Dewey takes
snuff.

LABOR PROSPERS UNDER ROOSEVELT

I would be wasting my breath telling the working
men of the country to what degree and to what extent
the labor movement in this country has prospered dur-
ing the Roosevelt Administration. All that they have
to do is to think back a few years to where they stood
under the Harding, Coolidge and Hoover administra-
tions. Labor had hard workikeeping its head above
water in those days. The mighty coal miners union
could make only a pretense of holding the coal operators

12

 

 

 to the contract that they had negotiated. There was .ng.,.
A’ unionism in the Southern Appalachian ﬁelds and the...
owners of the captive mines delighted to thumb their

noses at the United Mine Workers of America. If it had;
not been for an Administration that believed in__the.‘
principle of trade unionism and was willing to support
it, the unions of America would not be what they are“:
today.  
Now the miners have become a mighty union. There ~
; is hardly a coal mine in the Nation that has not been

unionized. The miners, themselves, know this and they

will not run any risk of a return to the conditions pre-

V ceding Roosevelt, however ﬂute-like may be the tunepf.
 of candidate Dewey. The Automobile Workers did not”
' even have the pretense of a union. Only a few years?
1 ago, the steel workers had no right to bargain collec-‘
12 tively. The same was true of other crafts. Not only

3. have new ‘unions come into being, during the last-
§ . ' eleven years, old ones have become bigger and stronge'r.

, . .

l

‘EXTRA-ORDINARY CAMPAIGN '

This had been a truly extraordinary campaign. The
Republican candidate offers no issue—at least no tangi-
ble issue. The Republicans for years have been in-
veighing against the New Deal. They have been
against it and all of its works. Every four years -they‘
have hardly been able to wait until the next election to
3" register their stern disapproval. They nominated Mr.
Dewey at Chicago and adopted a platform. But the;
platform that they adopted is not the platform upon
which Mr. Dewey is now running. And the Mr-. _De_wey__
who is returning from the trip that he undertook to;
woo the West is not the Mr. Dewey who was nominated.
at Chicago. At least he is not the Mr. Deweygwhornj
the Republicans, urged on by reactionary business and:
that section of big business which is the /press of -they ; '
country, thought that he was. I do not know just when;
the metamorphosis occurred but Mr. Dewey, if the».

13

most ardent‘ New Dealers of them all. »

Mr. Dewey has ‘complained bitterly about President
Rooseve1t’s reconversion plans but they have succeeded
at least to the extent of converting Mr. Dewey into a
New Dealer. Four years ago I observed that Mr.
Dewey had thrown his diaper into the ring. At Los
Angeles on Friday night he threw the sponge after his
diaper.

' DEWEY ADOPTS NEW DEAL

In the speech that I made in Grand Rapids, Michi-
gan, on September 12, I quoted from the Philadelphia
speech of Mr. Dewey to indicate that he had adopted
the domestic policies of the New Deal. If he left any-
thing‘ unsaid in that regard in Philadelphia he went

completely overboard in Los Angeles. In that metropo- ‘

lis of Southern California, he undertook to upbraid the
New Deal for ‘not being New Dealish enough. From
some editorial comments that I have seen in Republi-
can papers, the man who went bravely forth to slay the
New Deal Dragon, and is now on his way home tickling
it under the chin with a feather cluster, is not going to
be welcomed with open arms. I hope that he took the
precaution of collecting his campaign fund in advance
for he is going to have difficulty reconciling the political
religion that he got on the sawdust trail in Los Angeles
with the Republican orthodoxy in which he was so
carefully brought up. -

Even before he got New Deal religion, Mr. Dewey
had adopted the foreign policies of the Administration.
Except when he thought that he could pick up a few

‘catch-penny votes, by making an issue of General
...MacArthur, he had endorsed in full the war policies of _
the Administration. As matters now stand this new

convert to the New Deal apparently is with us both in

war and in peace. The only claim for the presidency

that he seems to make appears to rest on two grounds;
14

 

 

means what he says in his speeches, is now one of the

 

ﬁrst, that the Democratic party has not been as New
Dealish as he will be if elected and; second, that he will

do the job better than it has been done. It might be a’
wise precaution, however, to keep our latest convert on

the mourners’ bench until we can be perfectly sure that
this time he means what he says. Meanwhile, we have
a trusted New Deal team to carry on.

ROOSEVELT GREAT WAR PRESIDENT

‘In the White House we need maturity, experience,
and the training that cannot be picked up during a few
very brief years spent as a prosecutor and governor and
candidate for ofﬁce. President Roosevelt has made a
great war president. His most bitter political or per-
sonal enemy would not attempt to gainsay, that. And
he will make a great peace president. The formulation

of the peace will require steadfastness, experience, and

vision to a degree that is not possessed by Mr. Dewey.
The Nazis are not going to vanish into thin smoke
when Germany surrenders unconditionally. They will

simply go underground, millions of them. It were

foolish to blink the fact that even here in America we
have Nazi-minded people. Nazis, whether here or
abroad, will have to be dealt with with understanding

and ﬁrmness or the victory that we are winning over .

Germany will have been an empty thing. We cannot
afford to take a raw recruit in the hope that, in time, we
might train him for the most important job in the world
today. You know whether, as compared with Mr.
Dewey, President Roosevelt has the qualities necessary
to win the war and conclude a peace. With the score
tied in the deciding game of a World Series no sane
manager would send a rookie to the plate. I

I repeat that we need as President a man who is not
only great, valiant, and resourceful in war, but great and‘
wise and resourceful in peace. For the four years‘ be"?
ginning wtih January 20, 1945, America will need a
peace president; not a _piece of a president.

THE SAWDIJST TRAIL

By

HI-IAROLD L. ICKES

Secrefary of fhe Inferior

Speech delivered at the Second
  I ‘ AMERICAN SLAV CONGRESS
Schenely Park

Pittsburgh, Pa.-—Sept. 24, 1944

 

INTRODUCTION

The Second American Slav Congress, held in Pitts-
burgh, Pa., September 23-24, was an inspiring national
demonstration of unbreakable unity of Americans of
Slavic extraction behind the ﬁghting leadership of
President Roosevelt for complete and speedy victory
over the fascist enemy and for establishment of “peace
on earth and good will to men.”

The 2414 delegates and 300 visitors who assembled
in -the Carnegie Music Hall expressed their determi-
nation to do everything possible to assure the reelec-
tion of President Roosevelt in November as the surest
guarantee of fulﬁllment of those aims for which free-
dom-loving peoples everywhere are ﬁghting and dying
today.

At the closing public session of the two-day Congress
Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, delivered
an inspiring message to an audience of 7,000 assembled
at Schenely Park, and to the millions throughout the
country who listened to the speech over the Mutual
Broadcasting System.

We hope that the speech printed in this pamp-hlet,
will be read with great interest by our friends.

Congress, 8 West 4oth Street, New York 18, N. Y.

Dewey Hits the Sawdust Trail

Address given by the Honorable Harold L. Ickes, Secre-
tary of the Interior, before the American Slav Congress
Rally at Schenely Park, Pittsburgh, Pa., September 24,
1944, and broadcast over the Mutual Broadcasting Sys-
tem from 4:00 to 4:30 P.M. 

When I last spoke to a great assemblage of American
citizens of Slavic birth or descent here in Pittsburgh
some two years ago——at a time when it seemed that this
and the other United Nations might fall before the
bloody onslaught of the Axis hordes——I aﬂirmed my faith
that Hitler would not win, saying that “the justice of
God, though sometimes slow, is as relentless as it is
inevitable.” We now know that the hour of justice is
at hand. .

Even as I speak, the men of this country, as well as
of Russia, of Poland, of Yugoslavia, of England, of
France, of Greece, of Belgium, of Holland, and of
Czechoslovakia are crushing the last vestige of the Nazi
might which held sway over too much of Europe for

too long. The role that the Slavic peoples have played’

in bringing about the defeat of Hitlerism is an inspiring
example of patriotism, and a thrilling demonstration of
courage and endurance. ‘

As a result of an unimaginable reign of terror, you
men and women of Slavic birth or descent have acquired
a righteous appetite for justice. The President of the
United States today promises you that "the victims of
Hitler shall. have justice. A ’

ROOSEVELT’S MESSAGE

The promise of the President that justice shall be
done is contained in the greetings that he has sent to

5

i
1
I
I

  

I you and which I have the honor to bring to you in his

name. I quote the President of the United States:.

“The day of liberation of the peoples of Slav
blood in Europe draws near, and with it the time
for administration of retributive justice on their
Nazi enslavers.

“As you rejoice at the liberation of kith and kin
from the Nazi yoke and the bringing of Axis op-
pressors to the bar of justice, I am sure you will be
impressed with the deepened sense of the duties and
responsibilities which we must all assume if a just
and enduring peace is to be made.

“I trust, therefore, that all of your deliverations
may be inspired by wise counsel and constructive
action to further,the great objective of hastening
victory as a preliminary to peace on earth and good
will to men.”

We all support the wisdom and foresight of the Presi-
dent as shown in this message. ' .

But the task of visiting retribution upon the Nazis
and their minions is but one of the many jobs which
will confront this and other nations when the world is
once more restored to peace. Shattered homes will have
to rise again; blasted factories will have to be rebuilt;
farms will have to be restored; libraries replenished;
schools constructed. A good way of life will have to be
brought back to a .secure people. This is particularly
true of those Slavic areas—Yugos1avia, Poland, and

CzechosloVakia—upon which the thieving and murder- l

ing hands of the Nazis lay so heavy for so long.

URGES HELP FOR NEEDY

It is not the purpose of ‘the. Administration to let
down these heroic countries from which you or your .
fathers came and which have suffered so much. We do
not propose to be parties to any policy of economic

 

 

isolationism while giving lip service to political co-
operation between the Nations. I have said on former
occasions that economic freedom is more important
even than political freedom because, after all, one of

the chief values of political freedom is to win and

hold economic freedom.

If, having helped, heroically, to drive out the Nazis,
America leaves their victims to starvation and want, she
will have failed of her duty, and will, for generations
to come, want to hide her head in shame. We will do
no such thing. .

In contrast, .Mr. Dewey, the Republican candidate
for the Presidency, sneeringly remarked in Louisville
the other day that we want no “WPA for the rest of the

world” and charged those whom he called “Washington

wasters” with trying to “buy the good will of the world.”
Surely Mr. Dewey has not forgotten that he coveted
the services of 25 WPA accountants, when he was Dis-
trict Attorney. On April 7, 1938, he wrote: “I am
gravely concerned at the possibility of the interruption
of the WPA project now attached to this office * ’*‘ *.
The discontinuance of the project would be nothing
short of a calamity in the administration of criminal
justice.” I _

You Americans of Slavic strain have a right to know
just what the Republican candidate means by his slur-
ring reference to helping the devastated countries of
Europe to get back on their feet. Does he mean that
America should not help war-devastated and hungry
Poland? Does he condemn, as an “international WPA,”
economic aid to Czechoslovakia? Does he oppose such
“Washington waste” as succor to Yugoslavia?

I believe that America does propose and intend to
help to rehabilitate the countries that have been ruth-
lessly devastated by the Huns. Neither Mr. Dewey nor
his cold—pack isolationist supporters will be permitted
to prevent it.

SLAVS’ EIGHT AGAINST HITLER HELPS AMERICA

‘It was due to our luck alone that the countries of
your ancestors were among those that were nearest to
the Axis. If Poland or Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia had
been three thousand miles away from Europe, with the
United States one of the countries intervening between
the Atlantic and Germany; if this Nation had had to
stand the full force of those terriﬁc blitzkreigs of the
Nazis; if the United States now lay bare and devastated,
with her people tortured, maimed, robbed and mur-
dered, we would not like to hear any glib, derisive talk
denying the obligation of Poland or Yugoslavia or
Czechoslovakia to help us to get to our feet again.

Such talk is nothing to be proud of. Such sneers do
not fall becomingly from American lips. Least of all,
should any American be running for the highest ofﬁce
in the world on the proposition that we let others suffer
and starve while we have more goods than we can sell.
Such talk is not only callous and unfeeling; it is reckless,
and represents bad judgment, bad sense, and bad busi-
ness‘. The best way for this Nation to assure itself of
the unending enmity of the people of the devastated
countries is to refuse to help them, from our own store-
houses which will be bursting with goods. And the best
way for us to assure ourselves of their friendship and
regard-—and their business and trade—is to aid them to
get back on their feet.

DEWEY ASSAILED

The Slavic nations do not want a dole. They will
pay for what they get, and our reward for helping them
will be rich in terms of world trade and of lasting
friendship. These are the very foundations of world
peace. When Governor Dewey derides this program as
an “international WPA” he demonstrates that he, can-
not be trusted with the great responsibility of the presi-
dency of the United States.

Governor Dewey has given other evidence of his un-
heeding attitude toward the grave problems that con-
front this Nation. In Philadelphia, he shabbily tried

, his best to pluck the heart strings of every mother, wife,

sister, and sweetheart of a Service man in order to win
a vote by falsely saying that it was the plan of this
Administration n_ot to demobilize our armed forces as
quickly as possible. I am too polite to give the short and
ugly word which alone would properly characterize this
irresponsible statement. It is signiﬁcant that on the very
day on which Dewey went overboard_into this political
quagmire, the War Department gave out a carefully
considered plan of quick demobilization that has the
well-merited approval of the country as well as of the
armed forces.

Last Monday night at Seattle Mr. Dewey told how
dearly he loves labor. No, I am inaccurate. In a mere
half hour he could not have poured out all of the love
in his heart for labor. He would have them believe that
the Republican Party has been more interested in the
working men than in the aristocrats of steel and alumi-
num and sugar and optical instruments and all of the
other trustiﬁed and cartelized industries that have made
vast fortunes for the men of Wall Street.

In his ﬂippant /and reckless quest for votes, Dewey
kicked his own supporters in the face by assaulting the
War Labor Disputes Act, which he indicated, mali-
ciously, was the product of this Administration. Does
he believe that American working men fail to remember
that this measure became law despite the President's
veto? That bill became a law because the Republican
members of Congress, who now profess such concern
for labor, imposed it upon labor. It became a law be-
cause the Republican supporters of Mr. Dewey in Con-
gress, whose day of reckoning at the polls approaches,
voted 4 to 1 to pass the measure over the President’s

VCCO.
