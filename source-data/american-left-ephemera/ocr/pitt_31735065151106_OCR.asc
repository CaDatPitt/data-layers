SPOKANE, \/Vash.

BEST CONVENTION we e\v'er~had! That was the
opinion of most delegates to Mine—lVlill’s 50th Inter-
national Convention, held here March 14-19. ’

It was a most united, harmonious and constructive
‘convention. The actions taken were those of a union
, moving‘ ahead in collective bargaining, organizing politi—
cal action and defense of its members, while at the same
~ time moving toward renewal of organizational ties with
the mainstream of the labor movement.

It was a history—making convention iniits unanimous
‘ vote for autonomy of Mine-Mil] in Canada. “With auton-
‘ omy, Mine-Mill will be the beacon towards which the en-
..tire Canadian trade union movement will turn for the

full expression of the underlying and pressing (‘anadian

national consciousness which waits but for leadership
' to find release,” said Vice President Nels Thibault, ad-
dressing the convention by telephone and loud-speaker
‘ from Trail, B. C. ’

By JOHN CLARK

  

 NCE AGAIN, Mine-Mill has met in a conven-
tion of rank-and-file delegates and demonstrated
to the world the meaning of democracy in action.

Our Spokane convention, just ended, ought to drown
out for a while at least the voices of those who are for-
ever mouthing charges of “outside control.”

There are mighty few unions left in the labor move-
ment which can honestly boast they hold conventions
3 like ours. The delegates were all elected by the workers-
in theirowii locals ——not appointed by International or
district officers. "

Once the convention opened, every delegate had the
i_iiirestricted right of debate on every issue, pro and con,

both in committees and on the convention floor. Nobody
 was interrupted. There was no gag rule. .
pf Best Convention \
r , g "
, I  AS WE WOUND things up on Saturday, I heard a

good many delegates say it was the “best Mine—Mill con-
vention in a long time.” They had good reason to be‘
proud of their work. “

' The delegates set the pace for the coming year in
defense of their union. They reaffirmed the principles
and policies of their union, and on several important
issues, they drafted new policies and programs. They
nominated candidates for the officers and board mem-

' bers who will steer their union for the next two years.

Every’ item of business before the convention was

, important, of course. But it seems to me that there

i were four actions which stand at the top of the list-—

the decision to recommend full and complete autonomy

for our Canadian members, the adoption of our 1955

bargaining demands, the shaping of a program for de-

..»....._; fense of our union, and the step toward merger of Mine-
"Mill with the “main stream of organized labor.”-

This last convention decision, of course, was met
by howls of anguish from those same people who in the
last few years have attacked Mine-Mill most viciously.

/ “Infiltration!” they shout. “It’s another plot!” And

the louder they shout, the more they expose their anxiety

3 to keep labor divided——especially the workers in the
non—ferrous metals industry.

We lNon't‘ Be Stopped -

WE, OF COURSE, will lnotrbe stopped by suclrliokum,
for we as well as the whole labor movement"~in the U.S.
and Canada understand the aims of those who want
unions to remain-dis-united. -We know they like the splits

\ _ in the labor movement because those. splits have ‘made
it possible for a raft of repressive laws against labor to
be passed, in Congress and in the legislatures.

Events of recent months show that the more honest

labor leaders have come to the conclusion that there is

one urgent need—to solidify labor’s ranks in order to

carry on the fight for repeal of these repressive meas-

. ores, and to put back in labor’s hands the unlicensed
right to run_ its own legal business. 6

‘We in Mine-Mill have always fought against con-
formity. We have fought for the right to be unorthodox,
the right to dissent and to protest. We have even in-

sisted that we have the right to be wrong occasionally.
‘ It seems to me that if you read the papers these days,
more and more people —-— including spokesmen for unions
-e -— are insisting on these same rights".

Q.

Labor Unity

-_ I I  CONVENTION ’S resolution on labor unity set out
the basic principles which we consideij crucial. There is
nothing new about these principles. They are the prin-

/ ciples on which trade unionism has rested for many years
in the U. S. and Canada.

On the last day of the convention, the delegates
_ . nominated candidates for the various offices and board
;’ -.memberships. Every candidate who was nominated is
’ known tcrbe a loyal supporter of this International Union.
L ‘Most of the candidates are well-known throughout the
.;,¥: Intenational union for their contributions to bargaining
 councils, area conferences and conventions.

The choice, as always, is in the hands of the rank-
and—file membership who will vote by secret ballot in
May. I know that whoever is electediwill carry on in
the service of the members of this great International

nion.  i — i ' '1 - A '

SPEICIALI DEMANDS

(To be presented in certain areas where they are of special importance). '
UNION SHOP. To be demanded in everystate where not forbidden, at
every property where not already in effect.
SHORTER WORK WEEK. Demand for a six-hour day for eight hours

, contract demands-A adopted" by the Mine-Mill .

S. All holiday and vacation

Pension demands are:

during any

pay. Renewed and intensified activity by all locals —— through educational ac-
tivity among our members and in the community, and through legislative and
political activity +to bring achievement of six hour day with eight hours pay.

CONTRACT BONUS. Seek incorporation of these principles in all bonus
and incentive systems: right of uni-on to negotiate prices, standards and all
other aspects of system; all work over standard to be paid at least rate for
normal output; full integration of wage increases into contract set—up; right
of workers to- refuse to work on bonus without being disciplined; indirect work-
ers to be compensated for extra effort. A - .

AREA DIFFERENTIALS. Serious effort to be made this year to wipe out

all vestiges of area differentials.

PREMIUM PAY. Overtime pay for Saturday and Sunday work as such.

UNIFORM’ WORK WEEK. A uniform schedule with all employees work-
ing an equal number of days per week. Work week to begin on Monday.

benefits. They also demand
greater union control and com-
plete coverage for all hospital,
surgical and doctor costs for
employees and their families.

Some locals, which made ma-
jor health-and—welfare g a i n 3
last year, are- expected to push
pension demands this year. The
convention agreed to "shoot for
basic retirement benefits of
$2.50 a month for every year
of service, in addition to Social
Security ben efits. Complete
medical, hospital and life insur-
ance coverage for retired work-
ers willalso be demanded.

Lost time plan

Under the lost time pay
scheme, if the worker’s loss of
pay is partly compensated by
either jobless insurance or
workman’s compenstaion, the
employer would make up the
balance to bring the total to
$60 a week.

The holiday—vacation demand
is simple——bring all holiday
and vacation -clauses up to the
highest level which now exists
in the industry.

Fair practices

' The fair employment demand
provides for an FEP clause in
e V e 1' y contract, guaranteeing
no discrimination in hiring, pro-
motion, upgrading, apprentice-

ship, job training, layoff, dis-.

charge or management of any
company facility, because of
race, creed, color, sex or age.
In addition to the five na-
tional demands, the convention
adopted - six special demands,
which will ‘be pressed in certain
areas with full endorsement
and approval of,the entire Inter-
national Union.
Under this ‘heading is the un-
ion shop, which the convention
agreed should be fought for
wherever it is not already in
effect and state law does not
forbid it. .

Shorter week '

Renewing the demand for a
shorter work week with no‘ loss
in take—home, the delegates
open the way fo/r the demand
to be_made in brass and some
fabricating sections, and called
for intensified e d u c a t i 0 n a l,
legislative and political activity
aimed toward the goal of six

hours work for eight hours pay.’

Contract bonus

The convention also called for
“drastic improvement” of the
contract "bonus system in the
Butte, Montana, mines, “as well
as several others.” “These sys-
tems,” a resolution said, “are
frequently used so as to give
the company sole real control
over earnings——-the company
arbitrarily fixes standards and
prices, juggles rates, and as-
signs contracts as it pleases
with little opportunity for the
union to intervene.”

A set of principles to be de-
manded as the basis for all
bonus systems was adopted. The

principles call for the right of
the union to negotiate prices,

ages, health and welfare,
ensions, top '55 demands

standards and all other aspects
of the system. .

Area differentials

The fourth special demand
called for “a serious effort this
year to wipe out all vestiges‘
of area differentials where they
still exist.”

The delegates voted-to sup- »

port the efforts of many coun-
cils now seeking time-and-a-half
for Saturday work as such and
double time for Sunday work
as such.
Mobilization

A uniform work wee‘; was
the sixth special demand. It
would mean that all employees
would work an equal number
of days each week, and the
work week would begin for all
workers in the ‘industry on Mon-
day.

Early mobilization of all
locals around the bargaining de-

mands was agreed on by the

convention, which urged “an im-
mediate educational, campaign
be undertaken, in all loca.ls and
in the communities in which our
members live to publicize this
year’s bargaining program, the
basis for these demands, and
their justification.”

Anaconda, . Mont.

win 512.009

on old claims

ANACONDA, Mont. — Some
200 members of "Mine-Mill Lo-
cal 117 here recently put checks

‘ ranging from a few dollars all

the way up to $155 in their.

pockets. All told, they got some
$12,000—-—as the result of the-

work of “new” Mine—Mi.ll lead-
ership. '

The story goes back to the
days when Charles
Clive Farlin and a few others
ran Local 117. Members of the
union were covered by an in-
surance -program with‘ the Wash-
ington National Insurance .Co.

The insurance company in
1951 suddenly reduced benefits
in violation of its contract with
the union. _Later. that same year
they cancelled "the contract wth

the union, leaving many just
_claims unpaid.

That happened in 1951. But
little or nothing was done about
it aslong as the “McLean gang”
remained in control of Local
117.

Then came the big movement
to clean out the McLeans and‘
their stooges during the 1954.
raid. The membership elected
an entirely new slate of lead-
ers. These new leaders, with
the help of the International
Union, moved to obtain payment
on the claims of the Anaconda
workers. 5

_The results came quickly.
Some 210 Mine-Mill members
and their families shared in the

final payoff. V

- A SPOKANE, Wash. -—- Support for the

campaign to organize large new mining

properties in Arizona was voted by dele-
. gates to the 50th Mine-Mill convention

here.

The convention declared that “Our
brothers in Arizona have begun to show
the way in organizing newﬂproperties by

‘ the victory won at the Banner mine. The .
gneatorganizing victories of our Canadian
members set a real target for us in the
states to shoot at. The constant increase
in open pit type mining operations make it

, essential that we develop new organizing

 3 hispatriotism?

“High officials of our Justice
Department are asking us to
‘support this informer system
and leaders in the legislative
branch of our government are
too lightly treating the recent
. turn-about testimony of Harvey
Matusow as though it were
some pheno'menom unlikely ever
to occur again. I for one, be-
lieve that if this issue of in-
forming is to be joined, then it
should be thoroughly aired, for
.I agree with Sir Erskine May
that the “best protection against

 vinternal enemies‘ lies in open
- ‘discussion. free of the surveil-

lance of spies and informers.”

Corruption of democracy
“History’s appraisal of the in-
former is strikingly uniform,
and therefore it is not strange
“that we find him cast in the
jself—same role in all times‘ and
in all ages where political per-

Fsecution happens to be an ugly

gsyinptom of the times. The
odious thing about informing
is its widening corruption of
our democratic processes and
of our civilized state of being.

In addition to affirming the Execu-
tive Board’s action making Arizona a
“point of concentration” for Mine-Mill or-

continue the policy of surveying all organ-

ANACONDA, Mont. -—~ Ana-

The membership has author-
ized the local union and its
building committee to go ahead

Mogus Building at Park. and
Chestnut streets, in the heart
of the city. The building will
become the permanent home of
Local 117.

A two,-story brick structure,

new home is, considered the
finest building in town. Its
value is estimated at about
$100,000, although it‘ is costing
Local 117 only about one-half
that amount.

Purchase of a union hall. is
only one of many signs that
Local 117 is moving ahead. Dur-

investigation of this type of
witness. There is no defensible
position that I know of that our
governmental agencies can take,
because they have long been
warned about this situation. . .
I think that in the interest of
justice it is quite high time that
the calibre and the veracity of
witnesses in political cases be
examined and investigated."

TllE~CONVENTION SAID.

Here are excerpts from resolutions adopted by the Mine-Mill

Jobs and Unemployment

We call for the following program to fight the cruel hardships
of unemployment by calling on both the United States and Cana-
dian governments to enact legislation for: '

A vast prograrp‘ of public works . . . increased unemployment
compensation to a minimum of $60 a week . . . release of govern-
ment stocks of surplus foods for unemployed . . . open world trade
with all countries to our production of peacetime goods . . . enact-
ment of the Murray-Metcalf $1.25 minimum wage bill.

Convention backs high

level lIell’s Canyon clan:

SPOKANE—Immediately after hearing Gus
Norwood’s speech, the Mine-Mill convention
adopted a special resolution reaffirming our
Union's support for the Hell’s Canyon high dam,
and urging full backing to HR 4719, introduced

 by Congressman Gracie Pfost, and its Senate
/counterpart S. 1333.

The resolution added:

“That we also support any other national
resources projects such as- the Upper Colorado
project, that we believe will be for the good and
welfare of our country as a whole,

“That we go on record to oppose any proposed
project that shows a selfish interest by individual
companies or groups such as the Idaho Power Co.
at Hell’s Canyon. or the Dixon-Yates projects, and

“That our locals take appropriate action to
contact our Congressmen and Senators to push
for such action.”

Civil Liberties

We must do all we can to press for approval of the proposals
which have been advanced to protect the basic rights of any wit-
ness, and to abolish one-man hearings and witchhunt circuses.
Rut civil liberties can only be restored to their high place in

our country by ‘a rededicationv of the principles of freedom estab-
lished in our Constitution. First and foremost, the Smith Act must‘
be repealed. The same is true of the McCarran Internal Security
Act, which further carries out the purpose of the Smith Act.
We give our support to the legislation now introduced in Con-
gress which calls for. basic revision of the l'VlcCarra.n»-Wa'lter ‘im-

migration law. _
Political Action

It is important that we begin to work now to prepare for next ‘
year. Make sure we have a political action committee in every
Mine-Mill local.‘ Develop an adequate voluntary financial program
to be used in advancing political activity. Make sure every nienalter
is registered. Further develop political action unity with other
unions and organizations. Participate in 1955 mayoralty and city
and county elections. ‘ - .

Keep the political pot boiling by ‘pressuring the elected repre-*-
sentatives both state and nation, provincial and federal, for legis-
lation in line with our union’s policy and program and for defeat
andlrepeul of-all anti-labor and -ant.i—democratic laws .

‘Right-to-Work‘ Laws

We join with the rest of organized labor in calling for the
enactment of Congressman Jantes Roosevelt's amenolment which
would delete Section 1.43 of the Ia_ft-Ha.rtle2/ act, that section
which gave legality to the passage of the rash state “Right to

W orlc" laws. . _
Taft‘-Hartley .

Labor in America can unshackle its hands and return to its
important job of advancing the interestsof all our people.
'l‘herel'ore be it resolved, that this 50th convention of the
IUMMSLSW go on record for complete and final repeal of the
’1‘aft»-Hartley law.

Premium Price Subsidy for
Metal Mines i r

We call upon our Congressmen and Sena.tors from the ‘West-
ern States to em/ite a»ro2m.d the proposal of a Preiniam Price Plan
and intro:/vice such legislation as the only prarticail plan te‘p’r0—
-ride relief for the zinc inolzistsry.

Segregation and Integration

A group of liberal Senators has introduced a series of bills
in the new Congress, including one to end Jim Crow in travel. an"-
other to abolish the poll tax, one to outlaw lyncliing‘. and a hill to
set up a Fair Employment Practices Commission. We of Mine-Mill
will continue to be in the forefront of the fight for passage of
such legislation. ’ , ' A

Our Union should be in the forefront of the fight for guaran-
tees by our government of wages and conditions for workers im-
ported for seasonal work. This includes the right to organize,
bargain collectively, and strike. 3

Peace. Jobs and World Trade  

In the light‘ of the latest lm.o7rledge and experience in H
and A bombs, disarm.a.men.t is the only path to save millions of
/lmericans and millions of other huniasn beings from death by the

To unify workers
in our industry ,

if Albert Pezzti, Int’l Secretary—Treasurer, made the

main speech at the opening of convention discussion on
the labor unity resolution. Here are some excerpts:
. . Q _
First of all, this resolution doesn’t propose that we
go out and try to find ourselves an umbrella full of holes.
Neither do we propose to give up the very essence of
the breath of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, the
rank-aind~file democracy oi.‘ this organization. So it is not
the purpose of this union to give up one ounce of .that
quality which has made this union what it is.
Well, then, what is provided for in this resolution?

The purpose of this resolution is to find for the Mine,‘

Mill and Smelter Workers their rightful place in the main-
stream of the organized labor movement of this co'unt.ry
and.Canada——-and we do have a place in this labor move-
ment. ‘

O

Certainly if the AFL and C10 are going to merge, and
they are, in onebig federation, there is a ri.ght.ful place,
for the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers within that fed-
eration. . -

I think it would be absolutely wrong, no matter how
strong we are, for u-s to let the great majority of the
workers of this country and Canada move in one direction
toward a united organization and let us go off in some
corner and sit there, or let us go off in another direction.

0

I say for us to take that course of action would_be to
follow a road into nowhere. I think we have got to head
in the direction in which the majority of the rank-and—file
workers of these two countries are headed.

And, after all, is this so inconsistent with the record
of this Union over the past number of years? Of course
not. We have always been in the forefront of the fight
for unity-—-in one form or another. It wasn’t we who chose
to divide and dismember and weaken the ranks of the CIO.

. We have reached a pretty advanced stage, as a matter
of fact, in some of our developments towarduniity down
below. The establishment of the Anaconda Conference, for
‘example . . . steps being taken to develop a similar confer-
ence in Kennecott. And there are too many to point up
here—-instances where our local unions in various areas
work together with local unions in the same area in other
International unions for the same purpose.

We have fought together in legislative action, and in
particular in the Western states where we have built a
high degree of common "political and legislative action
with AFL‘and CIO groups. ' ’

. .

We want to move in the direction of unifying the work-
ers in, c“-r non-ferrous metals industry. That is our job.

ur jg  lto seek fulfillment of the charter of this organ-
’1zat?ion., nd there are other unions in our industry, some
Who have been there a long time, others who have gotten
in, in‘ the last few years, by raiding us, by chipping off
pieces here and there. ‘

B 0

So we move now toward unifying the non—ferrous
metals industry‘ so that we are able to present a front
against the employers, not on the basis of five or ten or
fifteen different unions dealing with the same employers,
but achieving organic unity so that when we .meet the
employers we meet them with one common, solid front.
That. is our stake in this new move toward organic unity
of the AFL and CIO.

SPOKANE——Four major principles on which Mine-Mill would “establish affilia-

ganiz-ed labor” were set forth by the 50th Convention

The delegates noted that Mine-Mill leaders have recently engaged in “explora-
tory discussions with representatives of various sections of organized labor” and
formally authorized the International Officers to pursue these negotiations.

But at. the same time, the convention warned that the membership is not pre-

pared “to pay a price that would involve the destructio
have made Mine-Mill the outstanding union it is.”

The basic principles on which
they called for al"'f.iliation talks
are:

1. To protect the identity
and integrity of the Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers.

2. To move ‘toward organic
unity of the workers in the en-
tire non-ferrous industry;

3. Guarantee equality to our
Negro and Mexican-American
brothers, and the autonomous
rights of our (‘anadian mem-
bers, and '

4. Assure our democratic
rights to control our own or-
ganization and elect our own

he strongest weapons we
have,” the convention said, “are
the rank and file of our union
who have foughtover the years
for these principles.” The rank
and file, it said, will defeat
“any attempts to smother or
swallow up Mine-Mill, to purge
its leadership or to chop it up
in pieces either before or after
any‘ affilation is arranged.”
“The purpose of this resolu-
tion,” said Secretary—Treasurer
Albert Pezzati, “is to find for
Mine-Mill its rightful place in
the labor movement of the

(571:

~ United States and Canada. And

we do have such a place.”
Calling attention to the “gi-
gantic growth and arrogance of
monopolies in our industries,”
Board Member Irving Dichter

said, “We suffer from the very .

same things that the AFL work-
ers suffer from and that the
CIO workers suffer from.

“We move toward unity for
the Very same reasons that
they move toward unity-—-to
protect the basic interests and
the basic welfare ofour mem-
bership and to contribute to-
ward the protection of the in-
terests of all of the.American
people,” Dichtcr added.

“We move in the direction of
unity from strength and not
from weakness. All of the at-
tacks have not destroyed this
union. ‘We control the basic
jurisdiction of mining, smelt-
ing and refining in the non-fer-
rous industry and everybody
recognizes that—-our enemies
as well as our friends. _

“We move in the direction of
unity with confidence, in confi-
dence that arises from the fact
that we have a hundred thou-

firm in our conviction of the
necessity to tight for the rights
of our members regardless of
race, color or creed."
. .

During the executive session
held by the convention on the
labor unity issue, delegates
from every corner of the Union
hit the floor to speak for con-
tinued “unity talks” based on
the four principles.

Joe Dispenza of Local 485
said, “I am in favor of merger,
but would never stand for any
resolution that would take away
any autonomy or any rights of

Judge Thomason told Matu-
sow: “You deliberately and ma-
liciously and designedly sched-
uled to obstruct justice and
caused the filing of an affidavit
and obtained a hearing on the
motion for a new trial.’-’

The judge also‘ barred Witt
from the Je-ncks case and from
further practice in his court.
At the same time as Jencks ap-
peals from the denial of the mo--

also appeal the action concern-

so confident that he can tell at

swiftly, so categorically and .so

The indictment of Brother M.
E. Travis and the conviction of
Brother Clinton Jencks on
charges of falsifying Taft—Hart—
ley affidavits are not merely
crass and brazen frame-ups of
courageous union men. The le-
gal persecution of these broth-
ers is as much a part‘of the con-
spiracy to break the union as
was the murder trial of Moyer,

-Pettibone and Haywood in the

early days of the Western Fed-
eration of Miners. ~
‘ O

The Taft—Hartley weapon now
being used against us is no
fresh-minted method of persecu-
tion. It is as old as the first
counter—assault of profit-grab-
bing‘ employers seeking ven-
geance against the organized
might of working‘ people.

Murder was -not the crime of
our early leaders. Falsifying af-
fidavits is not the crime now.
The real crime is that the work-
ers in the metal mining and al-
lied industries have consistently
and successfully challenged the
labor policies of the corpora-
tions which employ us.

Mine-Mill is not a weak foe.
It is not easy to split our ranks.
Six decades of Pinkertons, com-
pany stoolies and paid provoca-
teurs have failed to do that.

But still the employers try.
It is only a short distance in
time between the perjury of a
Harry Orchard and the perjury
of a Harvey Matusow. The paid
informer is still being used by
the corporations in their at-
tempt to divide and weapon our
membership.

"I realize the forces -
that need me will em- _
ploy every possible N
weapon against me for ~
recounting these acts
of mine, but my con-
science and the gravity g
of these times ‘require ‘
that the truth be told."

This convention rejects the
charges of the McCarthyites,
wherever they may be-—inp gov-
ernment, employers or the press
-—that this union is dominated
by Communists or .any other
group. It is membership dom-
inated and has been for 62
years.

The response of our member-
ship and local unions to the call
to defend our union already has
re a ch e d magnificent propor-
tions. But. they know, as we

know, that the fight has only -

begun. A long legal and educa-

battle we need more ammuni-
tion.

Naco strike
1% years old;

scabs quit,
pickets stay

To the Editor:
In 1946, when our Union be-
gan its organizing drive among‘

' the fertilizer workers in Charles-

ton, S. C., and Savannah, Ga.,
these workers were only get-

I ting 45 and 50 cents an hour.

Vacations were unknown to
many of the workers. Paid hol-
ldays were out of the question.
Reporting and call in time were
un-thought of. And the 45 and
60 cent wage covered any and
every type of work.

Well, the union has come a
long way since the workers were
organized. Wages have been
more than doubled. After one
year's service, workers get one
week’s vacation with. pay. After
three years, they get two weeks,
and after 15 years they get
three weeks. Six paid holidays
at year. Reporting and call-in
time‘ range from two to four
hours.-

-7 THE UNION has established

good grievance machinery in all
contracts and has improved
working conditions tremendous-
ly. Almost all plants have bath
houses and the safety records
have been improved greatly,
also.

i For morethan 50 years before

the union came, almost all the
‘workers in the fertilizer indus-

try were Negro. But now that
the Negro workers have organ-
ized and improved working con-
ditions andwages so much, the

 industry has become attractive

to white workers. The bosses

., are taking advantage of this.
. They hire white workers every

chance they get and then tell
the white workers that the un-

 ion is a Negro union. As a re-

sult, many of the white work-
ers refuse to join the union.

« ‘ 
IN AUGUST of 1954, the

"Naco Fertilizer Company in

Charleston decided to cut wages.
‘The workers, being Mine,-Mill
let the company

The company then posted a no-
tice on August 17, statingthat

If «all wages’ were. being cut 5

cents an hour starting the same
day.-

The Negro workers refused
to work. They immediately set

up a picket line around the

plant. The strike was on. I The
company told the white workers
to continue working-—-that they

‘would be taken care of. The

white workers have been cross-
ing our picket lines ever since

*’and working for less than fer-
“ tilizer workers in the same area.

MANY THOUSANDS of dol-
lars are being spent by the
Naco company as they use
white workers in their attempt

, to cut all workers’ wagesin the

fertilizer industry. But after 19
months, the Negroes still refuse
to cross the picket line. They
are sticking together to main-
tain that line.

The company has changed
hands since the strike began,
but the new owners haven’t been
able to get production back to
normal, either.

THE PICKETS have seen
more than; 1,400 workers cross
their.1ine in these months since
the_strike began. The turnover
is terrific. Normall'y, it takes
only about 85 workers to oper-
ate this plant. But since the

To the Editor:

No position in the labor move-
ment demands so much charac-
ter and integrity as that of the
Shop Steward.

Sure, I’ll always praise the
strength of character of our la-
bor leaders who have carried

-on such a valiant fight against

privilege and selfish power, and
I feel that great admiration
should be extended to them.

But I feel that the Shop

Steward who remains on the.

job has a far more difficult task
when he chooses to take up the
cause of his fellows in the shop,
putting the needs of those
whose grievances he voices
ahead of his own personal in-
terest as well as standing to
lose the favor of his employer.

We are now living in an age
when industrial and . military
regimentation encroaches on the
personal liberties of most of the
population.

No. one has to stress the ad-
vantages of freedom to me, be-
vcause from the moment I punch
in in the morning until I punch
out at night, Iam deeply con-

' THIS’ IS WHERE the Shop
Steward is able to focus his at-
tention on the difficulties and
the raw deals which can make
life in a shop a torment.

Time was when organization
had to be kept strictly apart
from the place of employment
and carried out in secret; dis-
covery meant‘ discharge and
often imprisonment.

I think, we in our times have
a far greater degree of enlight-
enment and a growing appre-
ciation of the importance of
freedom to the man in overalls.

Whenever there is ignorance,

, unemployment a n d _ economic

weakness on the side ‘of the
worker, the unscrupulous‘ em-
ployer is found ever ready to

thatcpresents itself to get rid
of the most able, honest and ac-
tive of the? Shop Stewards who
are guarding the liberties won
at great cost by the pioneers of

the labor m.ov_ement who gave
so unselfishly of their courage
and talents during the turbu-
lant infancy of organized labor.

THE FACT‘ that Shop Stew-
ard, is now able to stand up
in the shop and say that he
represents the workers and that

«a he demands the right to be con-

sulted on every question which
affects them is one of, if not
the greatest, advance.

It means that we, the work-
ers, are becoming more of a
power in industry instead of
mere “hands.”

The Shop Steward in this
sense is not only the “voice” of
the work shop opinion, but a.
symbol changing times.

Being lved in the process
of production, he is a most vital
instrun_1ent for expressing and
recording the current ideas and
needs of the workers.

It is of the utmost importance
to pick out the best men to be
entrusted with the task of ex-

anadian Council welcomes merger,

-TORONTO. Ont.-—The Canadian Mine-Mill Council, meeting here this month, is-
sued a statement welcoming the proposed TLC—CCL merger as “a positive step towards

unity.”

It was pointed out however that “there will be no real unity” unless the establish-

The statement said also that
“an all inclusive Canadian Trade

2 Union Congress must be based’

on» full recognition of the au-

Vfttonomy of all its affiliated un-

ions and must ensure "full demo-

. ;h»137e»ratic rights to the membership

anteel an end to raiding and

f concentrate on the organization

of the unorganized and the ad-
vancement of the interests of
the Canadian workers on the

\economic, legislative and politi-

cal fronts.” .
“This is unity for a purpose.

A This is what the workers want
A “and expect!

This is what the
Mine-Mill will fight for.”
O
TURNING its attention to the
mining industry the

Council stated “the proposed

~ merger of the TLC—CCL on its
3 present restricted basis will not
i . solve the problems arising from

the divisionand lack of unity
in the industry.” They point
out that in this industry the
workers are represented by sev-
eral unions, with Mine—Mill be-
ing in the forefront by its nu-
merical strength and basic rep-
resentation.

The statement adds that
“while the Mine-Mill has ex-
organization and
achieved the highest wage rates

‘and best conditions in the in-

dustry, the welfare not only of
thegMine-Mill membership, but
of all the workers in the indus-

try, demands action now to end ,
mthe ldisunity in the Canadian

metal» mining industry.”
THE‘ COUNCIL recognized

that their Union, representing

33,000‘ workers in the metal
mining industry, including

T those workers employed by the

two giants of the industry, Con-

‘Jsolidated Mining and Smelting
T and International Nickel, should

take the lead in proposing unity
of all the workers in the in-
4 s steps towards achieving
unity in the industry the Mine-
Mill Council proposes that “we
can and must advance towards
unity in our industry on the
common issues which affect the
membership of all the unions in-
yolved. Various differences that
between t-hese unions
must not be allowed to deter
unity on many questions that

"C3"T':”t‘rei-vital to the interests of all

the workers in the industry.”
"THE ‘STATEMENT further

.,proposes that “discussions be

held at all levels between all
Unions in the industry to seek
maximume unity on bargaining

and other economic and legisla-
tive issues, with policies on_
these issues to be determined
by“ the. workers themselves.”
The statement expresses the
opinion that out of these dis-

’ . Jrnent of one Canadian Trade Union centre included not only the TCL—CCL, but also the
Catholic Syndicates, the Railway Brotherhoods and independent unions.

it should be possible in the not
too distant future to create
conditions for the establishment
of one ‘union in the Canadian

Full Canadian autonomy

voted by M-M Convention.

SPOKANE-Full autonomy—the right’ to run their own affairs in their own way--is in prospect for the Canadian member-
ship of Mine-Mill as a result of the 50th Convention here. '

The convention agreed unanimously to submit to the entire

Mine-Mill membership, in the May referendum, a number of ‘

changes in the International constitution o enin the way for the Canadians to draw up a constitution of their own.

The delegates acted after listening to t ree
Nels Thibault, Canadian Vice President, described the au-
tonomy moves as a “positive beginning from which there
wi_ll be in Canada a full-fledged and powerful independent
labor movement.” .

Tliibault expressed the hope that it may “not be long
before we can again" mingle together free 'of border and

. other obstacles.” And he pledged the continued support

of the Canadian membership for the defence’ of M. E.
Travis and Clinton Jencks.

Greater cooperation

llarvey Murphy, regional director in British Colum- A

bia, explained that “B. C. doesn’t mean Barred from the
Convention, but British Columbia.” “Establishment of
Canadian autonomy means a greater degree of coopera-
tion, coordination and brotherhood between the two sec-
tions of our Union.”

Al King, Trail Local 480 president who had been

barred at the border on his way to the convention, said .

“We’re not going to let that stop us from carrying on our
work. People who try to divide workers only serve to bring
us together."

During lengthy debate on the autonomy issue, dele-
gate after delegate called attention to the fact that Mine-
Mill “will be the first union-—-AFL,CIO or independent-
to recognize the right of the Canadians to have their own
union within the International Union.”

Stronger organization

“This is going to strengthen the International Union,
not weaken it,” said Mike Solski, President of Local 598
in Sudbury, Ontario. “The enemies of our union may try
to interpret this as secession. That is not true. This is
going to mean a stronger organization on both sides of
the line.”

Albert Pezzati, International Secretary-Treasurer,
described the autonomy proposals as “a program of self-
government for the Canadian section of the union‘.-. . it
recognizes their fundamental right to run their own af-
fairs. Mine-Mill will be the first union to recognize the
right of the Canadians to have their own union within the
International union.”

Canadian convention

The constitutional amendments, to be voted on in
May, will go into effect July 1 if they are approved. They
provide for a Canadian constitutional convention, which
probably would be held in September. The constitution,
in turn, would be submitted to the entire Canadian mem-
bership in a referendum vote. »

The amendments also provide that the Canadians re-
tain a majority percentage of per capita dues in Canada,

BATHURST, New Brunswick——A sharp rebuff to the raiding tactics of the (‘IO
Steelworkers Union in their attempted disruption of Mine—Mill’s organizing campaign
here has been administered by the New Brunswick Labor Board.

The Board dismissed Steel’s fraudulent application for bargaining rights at the
Keyinet and Larder U properties. The reason for throwing out the application was
that the Steel Union did not have a paid up membership in the two operations.

C10 Steel organizers had entered the newly-opened Bathurst mining field only
after Mine-Mill's organizing campaign had made considerable headway. Mine-Mill

intl union mgunction
‘VANCOUVER, B. C.-—Local
452 of the Carpenters and Join-
ers won a victory in the courts
last week when they forced the

International officers to remove
the name of the local from the
list of plaintiffs cited in an
injunction against operation of
the local by officers suspended
by International Representative
Bill Page.

The officers were suspended
for distributing a Peace Coun-
cil phamplet on the motion of
the general meeting‘, although
Page and the International says
it was for “disciplinary reas-
ons.” Page, in his name and that
of the local, procured an injunc-

they refused to accept sus-
pension.

The next general meeting
then decided unanimously to
fight the injunction, and to have
the local’s name dropped from
the writ as plaintiffs and that
the local should be made co-de-
fendants with their officers.
This last part of the motion
was denied by the judge.

The local will next week enter
court to have the injunction
itself dismissed.

I

was about to apply at both
Keymet and Larder U.
The irregular Steel union
application was made only
in an attempt to forestall a
genuine one by Mine-Mill.
Promptly intervening in
the Steel application, Mine-

Mill requested a Board
hearing. '

Board Member William 0

Kennedy and Int’l Rep.
Floyd Gates proved conclu-
sively at the hearing that
the Steel union did not
have any paid up members
as required by the Labor
Act, and that the applica-
tion was irregular and
fraudulently made.

The decision by the New
Brunswick Labor Board
several weeks later bears
out Mine-Mill’s case and
exposes the Steel Union’s
trickery to the Bathurst
workers. The decision
should give added impetus
to the Mine-Mill organizing
campaign, which has been
hampered by the smear
tactics of both Steel and
TLC-AFL organizers
brought in by the com-
panies to confuse the issues
and prevent organization of
what could be one of the
richest mining fields in
Canada.
