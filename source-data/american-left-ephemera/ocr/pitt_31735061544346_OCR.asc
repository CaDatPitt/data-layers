the absence of massive aid from the west, and the lack of popu-
lar democratic institutions." The Guban leaders do not look

to the people as decision-makers, and many View "the apparent
success of Russia, the crumbling of duocracy in the west, and
the loss of American prestige" as a rationale for neglecting the
development of popular government.

Her conclusion continues the suggestion of American respon-
sibility for Castro's actions, citing several foreign policy
measures, such as economic aid, technical assistance, and refusal
to finance counterarevolutionary activities, which !might have
dildnished the provocation for repression of freedom” immcdiatelv
after the Cuban revolution. In closing, she notes: "In order
to gain a real peace, we must first make our foreign policy demo-
cratic in more than words§'1u . %

  4 rue SPO ausﬂgt took a stand on Cuba at its April 1961 Ober-

dciin Convention. A telegram was sent to President Kennedy, stating:

‘Although we do not support some of the actions of Castro,l

.we oppose the intervetion of the United Stateisﬁovernment in

the sovereign affairs or the nation of Cuba.“
Regarding Laos, the ,§ﬁ]13;,‘|,}_g31n oi‘ October, 1959, printed
an article entitled "Laos - The Paper Crista" which suggested
that reports of a Oommunist invasion were highly eaggerated.
The Laotian government, it suggested, created the “scare” to _
build up its own power and to gain votes in the election of 1958.
the article quotes ,m§m;;gmn 2953, military expert John G,
Norris, who wrote: i
"There are some indications, in fact, that this latest

flar p of East-west tension was not a long-planned Communist
plc o strike at a free world weak spot, but a reaction against

an Americanwencouraged Laotian internal anti-Communist drive.“

By April of 1961, the ﬁuggtin conceded that there was
“chaos in Laos." This article analyses the entire situation,
and in the process scores John Foster Dulles for repudiating
the results or the 199+ Geneva Accord on Indo-china and build-
ing "the South-East Asia Treaty organization vs. Gonnmnist
aggression 5" The United States, the article notes, "n:oved into
the power vacuum left by the French," paying the  army
and engaﬂging‘ in an “economic ‘pump;-priming’ %operation [which]
became a major cause for concern among anti-foreign aid con-
gressmen and -sold several hundred thousand copies or a book,
entitled mg nag majgam.” The article we notes in passing
that the Russians maintained a “fairly diplomatically correct
attitude" for some time, and then engaged in a small-scale
arms race in World war II guns andplaneso
Proposals made in the artible include: 1) neutralization or

Laos with representation of the complete political spectrum,

2) undertaking this effort through some neutral body, spon-
sored by the U.N.. 3) establishment of a Joint ms. - Russians
economic aid program, administered through the U’..I~I., 1+] a U.N.
"presence," if needed, and 5) "basically rely on the Buddhist
good sense and unity of the Laotians to achieve some harmony and
stability in their politics.“ 17 g

This attitude is also operative in the sen telegram to

President Kennedy onI.aos, which also came out of the 1961
Oberlin convention. It reads: i

There has been only one analysis or the Congo crisis in the
Ehliﬁﬂn. .In an article in January, 191, Norman Uphoff makes
"the same point about Lumumba that Jo Landy made about Castro.
Uphoff notes that Lumumba “sought to get aid from the United
States and_the United Nations before turning to the Soviet
Union. In fact he even termed this ‘going to the devil himsel£'.“
Uphoff explains U.S. support for Belgium on the grounds of the
N.A.2D. and the fact that the Rockefeller family had acquired A
interest in the Union Miniere dn.HIut Khtaiggg the large Belgiaw
controlled mining concern. The article urged the U.S. to support
the United Nations, so that "Belgium will have to leave and...
the U.N. will not become a old war pawn.*19

The reader or the above sumnries may infer, as some other:

hago, that the R11 muﬁm has been taking a "Co1mmmist line”

' on these issues. Several months after publication of the ﬁggggﬁig

commenced, '8PU began to receive letters and comments on this
point, and the result was a refutation by Dan Cohen in the January

~ 1960 issue. Cohen notes that “the American press is very di1i~

gent about exposing the evils of Communism. There is no reason
for a publication as small and crowded as the Eyllggun to restate
what can be found in any daily newspaper.“ Cohen then expounds
the "third force” position, as it applies to Americans!

is heavily pacifist, the majority or the membership is not. The /

light, and demonstrations are oanduﬂhtod under a discipline of
non-violence, but no major attempt has lean made to turn the SFU
itself into a pacifist organization;

p coincident with the continuing discussion of pacifist o£hnta-
tion, andoverlaying it in beoic importance, has been the tlﬂlﬂ
towards viewing the SP0 as the start of a "mass ovementa” In
fact, “the SPU as originally formd with a generally pacifist-

poriontad program, becoming oriented towarda a national movement

more through the broad interest aroused than through original
intotion. with the beginnings of a broader interest came a
broader scope or ideology.” 22  

The revision of the SPU Statement of Purpose is in keeping
with this trend. In its original form, the statement conctruod
the SPU to be: a

"mo: and organization of otudots and young people who have
igined together to seek constructive alternatives to the present
a tennational situation, to study the techniques of reconciliation,
and to work to build a world society which will know no more war,
which will suffer no individual or grogﬁ to be exploited for the
profit or pleasure of another, and whi will assure 33 all the
means for realizing the best possibilities of life." ‘

‘»P3$he revision, quoted earlier, bears repeating:

"After years of bad faith shown by both East and west in
diaarmament negotiations, the Student Peace Union believes that
to be effective, any peace movement must act independently of
the existing power blocs and must seek ngﬁ and cretive means of
achieving a free and peaceful society.”

SPU developed its conaicousl“third-camp“ position aloete
immediately, although; as noted ear1ier,it took the collapse of
the 1960 Ehmmit Conference to translate this attitude into a

part of the institutionalized framework of the organization;

In its first stages, the growth of the "third~eemp" jihatien
was not state as such.e Instead, the stress was on the closely
allied conception of the SPU as "a bled new effort to tear away
the fog of apathy which enshrouds our campuses tﬁdayauue What
better way to transform indifference into action that to offer
students the challenge of the greatest work of our epoch?” 25 ;

“Apathy” came to be a key word in the SPU lexicon. It is
interspersed throughout the discussions of $PU grewth and devel- V

Here too is the first appearance of the term "significant
force.“ In January of 1960, Aitbeeh uses the term “positive
intlunee", and speaks for the tirst time of ”iIlding a movement." 27
In April of 1960 the Easter Week Peace Walks were assessed as
"valuable for their impact on the community, which was made to
roelize that there is a peace mvemnt, and that its appeal is
not iimited to a smell, sectarian group.‘ 28 ,

In May or  the world was eagerly awaiting the results or
the Summit Conference in Paris. Wbrld opinion was focussed on
the eauferenee as a means of settling international disputes and
easing world tensions. The Student Peace Union prepared a petu
ition to the Smit, with proposals for disarmament, unification

of Germany.es a step towards European disengagement, an end to

imperialism, universal membership in the United Nations, aid to

of scietific and incustrial skills for the peaceful exploration //’
of space. 39 10,000 signatures were collected; and Philip Althach
and David Hamilton were sent to Paris to present their peiticns to
the Bib Four. ‘their trip included talks with leaders oi‘ the British
and French peace novements, which were very informative and useful,
but when they arrived in Daria to find the sumit Conference breakn
ing up around them, they left copies or the petition with the

Big Four governmets, and sent the bulk of the petitions to the
Geneva test ban talks.

On returning nose, Altbach lrote for the May 1960 m.J.gu.np_  

on his experiencese He noted that the British campaign for

nuclear Disarmament (END), the group responsible for the Alder-
maston march, "is nov a major force in British political life," 0

and nthenxeﬂe a statement which gave the spit a firm direction to:

its development:

“Both the situation in Great Britain and the fact that
I saw the Summit talks fail at close range has made one fact
very clear to mc.  That is the necessity of a reel mass move- a
ment for peace in the United States. Despite the growth of
the SP0 and other organizations like it in the USA, it is evi-
dent that weunnot have any real effect in our struggle for
alternatives to the arms race unless and until we create a fence
that the "power elite“ listen t0e‘ The forcenn be created.
Despite the Summit failure, one of the main issues in American
life is peace and it can bewlwold" on a mass basis.

"The Br  Gmpaign tor Nuclear Disarmament has shown the
way. Hith some changes to suit the political atmosphere in his
country, the time is ripe for the creation of a GED in the U.S.A.
The sit-ins have shown that studet apathy can be broken...g and
the SP0 was able to collect nearly 10,000 signatures on a mean-
ingful petition a feat impossible two years ago.

"In Englan the Aldermaston marchers said, "Let Britain
lead!" I say, t America load!" In the last analysis‘ it is,

A samciar community of interest has has created bctwcon the /
peace movement and the civil rights ovcmcnt. The sit-ins were ///
viewed as a successful instance of the use of non—v1o1«nt tactics,
and the realization by students that they con1a have a "direct
influence on tic injustices which plague our world" was thought
to “contribute greatly to... the salt of social consciousness
ﬂhich will make possible a major breakthrough by the student peace
movemont.“9: Thus, spa adopts the attitude that “the fight for
peace is directly rolatcd to the fight for froodcm.'1°

The SPU has not confined itself to domestic issues. Engin-
ning with its earliest numbers, the1ﬁEn‘ﬂgL13§mn, reflecting th A
concern or its readers, has carried analyncs.of such situatimndtf
as Guba, Laos, and the conga. These studies navo_bocn quite sic-
ilac in their presentation of the problems and in sigesticns for

 their solution, and a good deal of the similarity can ho traced

vcntually to a single sentence in the SP0 statcmct or Purpose.
Ihia particular portion of the statcmnt was addd when the
document was revised, after the 1960 Suit Conferonco hreak- V
down gave impetus to institutilcllzstion of an attitude which
had bogn prevalent in SPU alnost since its inception.

The first mention of Cuba comes in an article on ”The
Coming Election," in November of 1960, which suggests that
"by aid and encouragement“ t Cuba, who might have had the Castro
regime as an ally. Instead, we have instituted policies unfavu
orable to Castro, and have driven "the ideological leader of all
Latin America... ino the Communist camp.“ The third force posit-
ion is stressed in the statement that "this is the policy on which
hixon stands; this is the policy that Knnedy criticises as too
soft, " and the questions "which candidate is the lesser or two
evi1s?"13

  The same attitude is expressed in more sophisticated form

by Jo Landy, who wrote for the December, 1960  after
spending two weeks in Cuba. Her argument is based on "the

things ﬁhdsaw and the discussions [she] had with economists and

government officials.” She views the Cuban revolution as ‘an

'ettamt at a total reorganization of society and an attempt to

rroofcubg from foreign domination. " and notes that the Cuban»
revolution took place against a background of developing new
nations and the wish for support from these tow-nations by the
"contending blocs in the Cold wur.*
She notes that "after a short time in power, Castro, rebuffed

by the cold attitude or the American government, began moving on

several frets, * among them the nationalization of American~

downed industry, development of co-operatives, building schools

    

and roads, and industrialisation. hﬂo accomplish this program,
Cuba has exposed herself to “the danger or Russian imperialism."
Miss Landy’admits that Cuba is not a democratic country.

she cites two reasons for this: :"severe economic problems in
