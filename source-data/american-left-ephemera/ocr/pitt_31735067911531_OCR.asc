Local 72 have," delivered another smashing defeat
to C10 Steelworkers Union raiders. -_ .

 DEFEATEWvi
In their campaign to defeat Steel, they relied . A .l
pretty much on factual leaflets which told the

75.8 met in their 7th annual conven-
tion‘, .with “unity to fight back” '3
ieir theme. \
 The delegates heard a report by 758
Business Manager James Plnta_ show-
‘-ing" that the loca1’s membership won
' 250,000 a year in wage increases and
‘$50,000 more in fringe benefits in the
~1a’st' ‘year. The "report included 8' “b0X
score” on how each unit of the 10031
took part in major union activities dur-
ing’ the year.

 Int’l secretary-treasurer Travis, vice- ‘

president Wilsonland executive. board
member Dennis addressed the conven-
tion, reviewing developments in our
Union and in Washington. Travis called
"on the members to join in Mine-Mill's
caimpaign to overcome the crisis in the
lllead‘-zinc industry, and to work for
.unity.to' win -1953 bargaining demands.
 "The c‘on’ve‘ntion adopted a wage and
legislative program for 1953, and sent
Vfmessage to President Eisenhower

osition to the Goldwater bill as well

.7To/strengthen the union for‘ the bat-
ztles ahead, the delegates recommended
a'”'f50-cent monthly increase in. dues,

_c1_'easing per capita, tax, which the
‘delegates say may be necessary to de-

The defeat came in an NLRB election, won by _
Milne-Mill 172 to 49. The victory margin of more
than-three to one was even bigger than the margin
by which Mine-Mill busted -a Steelraid here two’

years ago;

The raid began back in March .when Steel
“organizers” sneaked into town while. the Local 72
president and secretary were in Denver attending
the Mining, Smelting Refining Conference. The CIO
Steel union, which had been,kicked outof Mfintana
by Mine-Mill in a series of elections two years ago,
tried the raid here _in what was regarded as a “test”

-of its strength. ‘ ' ,

But the solid unity of Local 72’s.officers, stew-_’
ards and committeeman proved too big a match for

Steel's raiders.

Smelting & Refining.-A Conference’  

n-of Local 1.  

By John_ Clark

I’VE been very much impressed by the great success of the first
steps in our Mine-Mill campaign to end the “depression” in lead and_
zinc. ‘

jobs and bringing a sick industry back -to good health.

' We’ve made a, great start. But we .can’t kid
ourselves that tl1e'campaign is over and won. Now
is the time to step up our ‘activities and make sure

.\we’re putting thei ‘einpliasis where it belongs. .

We have a three-point program, and we’ve said

over and over that all three points are wrapped up

in a single “package,” all pai;ts_‘of which go together.

The aim and target of all three points is JOBS, jobs
for our’ members,‘ jobs for all metal workers.

SO FAR the part of our program we’ve pushed hardest is the
one calling for “relief of the industry.” Here we’ve cei_itered on the
Murray Premium Price Plan. As we told the House -‘Small Business
Committee, passage of the Murray bill would putothe small lead-zinc
operator back in business. And that of course would mean jobs for
hundreds of our laid-off workers.

We must continue our drive for speedy passage of the Premium
Price bill. ~ A

But at the same time we must step up our two-sided drive for
“relief of lead-zinc workers.” That means pressure on both the state
and federal governments for aid over and above ordinary state ‘un-
employment compensation to those lead-zinc workers who have been
laid off. It also means we must fight harder than everfor wage and
other contract gains for lead-zinc workers still on the job.

And it is the third part of our program—“in"creased consumption

of lead and zinc at home and abroad”—on which we can do the biggest
job right now. A — '

JUST THINK, for example, what a Hel1’s Canyon project ‘on the
Snake river at the Idaho-Oregon border would mean to our members!
Not only would it take tons of metals—constructiom of the huge dam

would provide jobs for a great many laid-off Coeur d’Alene lead and , _

sine miners. . ‘

But Interior Secretary McKay now says: “No Hell’s Canyon

project will‘ be built by the federal government.” Instead he says
the privately-owned Idaho Power Co. will build three midget dams on

_ the Snake, and reap all the profits from this gigantic natural resource

which rightfully belongs to all Americans. :

McKay’s announcement is shocking. This power grab; is the
biggest steal since Teapot Dome. But it’s only one part of the giant
“giveaway and handover” program .of the Eisenhower administiation,
which we must fight and halt along withall other j.g‘ood Americans.

HELL’S CANYON is just one of the many projectsawe must fight

_ for. Schools, hospitals, a Missouri and Columbia Valley 'Authority—.—-

these are all projects the country needs and can-vaffoird.’ And they all
spell J—O-B-S, jobs. ’  '

Then there are the huge untapped markets for flead and zinc
overseas which must somehow be opened" up, in order to" guarantee
more jobs? here at home. We are by no means a.lon.e.in, agitating for
quick action to smash the barriers which are keeping,those markets
closed off. ' ‘ ' ‘ . 4 7 « '

Just the other day, the Associated Press 'quot,edf.Clinton. Crane,

_ chairman of St. Joseph Lead Co., as saying that peace -in Korea, or
i even a truce, would bringabout a boom “such as businesslias not seen
for many years.” Peace would restore normal trade and remove

artificial embargoes, he declared:_ _ _

' provide a marketifor every "pound of surplus goods‘ ‘this continent‘

might produce. Peace—real peace-_.é.—-could open that ..market-', not "over-
night of course, but in a relatively short time}? And then the Post
went on to pinpoint the healthy‘ effect such trade would have on the

very. parts of Mine-Mill's jurisdiction, British Columbia’ and the U. S. '

Northwest, which have been hit)hardest‘by the lleadézinc crisis. It said;

“Because/it (B.C. and the Northwest) is c1os'e'st,,it_is this region
with its minerals, timber, fish and'manufactured"g0ods that would

Against U. S. tariffs

Reprinted from ‘Local 598 ‘News . -

.ruH;.h.a by Sudbury Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, Local 59: ,

Support and congratulations to J. A. (Jimmy) Byrne, M. P. Koote-
nay East,'for his stand in opposition to U. S. protectionijsts who want to
discriminate against Canadian industry, was wired last week to the B. C.
Member of Parliament by Local 598 president, Mike Solski.

Byrne, former president of Mine-Mill Local 651 at Kimberley, B. C.,
and now Liberal M. P., called for a retaliatory export duty on shipments .
of nickel and asbestos to the United States if that country increases its.

The telegram sent by Solski stated: “Congratulations on your stand" it
in defense of Canadian industry against U. S. discrimination. It's about
time someone stood up in the House to tell those U. S. high’ tariff people A

A delegation representing the Canadian Mine-Mill Council which. _
met with Trade "Minister Howe and Mines Minister Proudhain earlier. ~‘
last week was accompanied by Byrne. The Mine-Mill brief ‘pointed out
the union’s objection to “any increased tariffs which might be imposed.

- by any country against our present exports of lead and_zinc.” _ _ « _‘

Speaking in the House, Byrne said legislation which now appears to  
beiobtaining support in the U. S. Congress would provide- for a one cent. . ‘f ‘L.
increase in the U. S. tariff for every one cent that the niarketprice -of 
lead and zinc fell below 15% cents a pound; This, hepointed out, would‘ '« ;
be disastrous for lead and -zinc mines in Canada, where already more thano ..
1,000 miners are out of work because of the low prices. Bryne’s speech .

- was applauded by Trade Minister Howe, indicating Government approval ~
. for retaliatory measures against U. S. high tariffs. -

By Graham Dolan

HEARINGS held in the West by the House Small Business Com-
mittee were only the first round in Mine-Mill's all-out fight to save

.-the jobs of workers in the _stricken lead and zinc industries. They
. set the stage for a concerted legislative fight to Win federal assist-

ance for workers and small operators.

The House Small Business Committe is a fact-finding body. It's
evidence and recommendations will be made to the regular " legisla-

tive committees of tile House of Representatives. This will lead to a .

series of hearings by these committees_on_ various proposals to ease
the lead-zinc crisis. In addition-, of course, there will be Senate bills

to consider, such as S 1539, the Premium Price Plan introduced by

‘Senator James Murray (Dem., Mont.) which is being supported by
Mine-Mill.

The job ahead for Mine-Mill breaks down into two parts :'

1. To secure federal legislation that will alleviate the metal
markets crisis and protect the jobs of -Mine-Mill members, and,

2. To popularize the more basic elements of our union’s pro-
gram such as a public works program and broader world trade to

 create larger dpmestic and foreign markets for lead, zinc and prod- .0
ucts made from them.

Accordingly, Mine-Mill’s officers last week urged the local un-
ions to step up their participation in the union’s program to meet

the crisis in the metals industry through the following suggested
 actions: ' ~ ‘ ~

1. ‘Expressions of ‘support for S 1539,
the bill introduced by Senator Mur-
ray which contains a plan for gov-
ernment payment of premium nﬂetal
prices to small mine operators. This
support can be expressed through
petitions, post ’-cards, telegrams and
other methods. Congressmen, Sena-
tors and President Eisenhower should
be the recipients of such mesages of
support,’ as well as Rep. William S.
Hill (Rep., Colo.), chairman of the
House Committee on Small Business,
and Senator Murray. , All Congress-

_ }}_ien can" be addressed at House Of-
fice‘ Building, Washington, D. C., and
Senators at.Senate Office Building.

early action and also to urge special
sessions of legislatures where neces-
sary to increase unemployment com-
pensation and to remove all unneces-
sary restrictions. '

4. Active support of area public works
projects through community meet-
ings, letters, - advertisements and
other media.

5. Community educational programs on
the need‘ for broader’ world trade" in
order to increase the foreign market
for lead and zinc products. Urging
such broader trade to Congressmen
and other public .0fficials°..

6. Continued community visits to busi-
ness men, public officials, and civic
leaders, informing them of Mine-
Mill’s program and urging united

I action ‘to save the lead-zinc communi-
ties from economic disaster. Resolu-
tions from other organizations,
particularly other labor unions. '

The next general “taiget” date will
be the calling of a special national con-
ference on jobs and legislationsome
time in July. Many locals are actively
engaged now in raising special funds
to send their delegations. _ -

‘Idaho, mayors of towns and cities
affected by the lead-zinc crisis should
be urged to proclaim “Preserve Our
Community” Day, on which petitions
addressed to Eisenhower, demanding

Biggest mine organized at Uranium City;

Steel raiders gve  

leave town

URANIUM CITY, Sask.-——Organiza-
tion of the largest mine in this area,
Beaverlodge operation of the Eldorado
Mining & Refining Company, has been
completed. Application for certification
has been made.

One of the first actions of the mem-
bers of Local 913 was to send a dona-
tion of $25 to the striking members‘ of
the Retail, Wholesale & Department
Store Union, CCL-C10, at Regina. In
sending in the donation, President
Belec stated: “Ours is only a new lo-
cal, but our policy is to co-operate with
all labor in improving the conditions of
the workers.”

There is only one mining company
in this area that provides blankets to
the workers, and at all the others the
workers are forced to pay for their
own bedroll. Under the health act and
the regulations that apply to the sani-
tary control of camps, the act states:
“A clean palliasse and clean disinfect-
ed bedding shall be supplied to every
new employe.”

A request has been made by the lo-
cal membership to the Provincial Min-
ister of Health that the employers be
compelled to live up to the act on the
question of supplying a Worker with
his bedroll. Other legislative requests
along the lines of camp sanitary con-
ditions have also been made.

SEVERAL of the mining companies
in this area hire out of Edmonton. This
is done thru the Chamber of Mines
and the Selective Service offices in
that city. The Eldorado Mining & Re-

.:fining Company have their own hiring

offices in Edmonton, but their general
policy is to hire thru their agencies in
.Eastern Canada.

Airplane transportation from Ed-
monton to Uranium City is $64.

For about six months of the year,
the only method of transpo1‘i;ation in
and out of this area is by airplane.
During the summer months, Water
transportation is available by river
boats a.nd barges. It is during this sea-
son that practically all of the heavy
equipment is brought into this area.
The river boats and barges operate
out of the rail head town of Water-
ways, Alberta.

In Uranium City itself, due to the

big staking rush, there has developed ’

an acute shortage of supplies of every
nature. As could be expected, living
costs are more than double outside

.,prices. Almost everything has to be

shipped in by air freight at 15 cents a
pound.

\

LIVING accommodations are re-
stricted mainly to tents or tent‘ frames
boarded up for about five feet With
lumber. There are very few wooden or

Canadian war prisoners  
report good treatment

VANCOUVER, B. C.'—-Canadian war‘

prisoners returning from North Ko-
rean POW camps, who are under no
military censorship, are quite unani-
mous in their stories of good treat-
ment and the best of medical atten-
tion While prisoners. Their stories are
in startling contrast to the fabrica-
tions ascribed to ‘returning Americans,

which yarns the British press, acting ,’

on fair treatment reports of their own
returnees, recently felt5'constrained to

’ tell the United States were doing that

country. no good. in the eyes of the
world. ‘ '

“I was treated-' along with my Amer-
ican companion on an equal basis with
the Chinese and Korean sick and
wounded all around us,” states L/Cpl.
Paul Dugal of Quebec, who describes

extremely considerate treatment in~

savinghis paralyzed legs and curing
a bad head wound.

Chinese doctors are also praised
highly by. P_te., Arthur‘ Baker, who
said to”reportiers"fi '“Iinus't ‘admit in all

OTTAWA’—';-Prediction that lead-zinc
prices -would stabilize at about 12% to
13 cents a’ pound and that the non-.

marginal and efficiently runmines had

nothing to worry about was made by
the Hon. C. D. Howe, Minister of Trade
and Commerce. The CanadiancCabinet
member made. these statements to a
delegation representing the Canadian
Mine-Mill.Council. ‘ "r
The delegation which met here with
Mr. Howe and»-Mines Minister G. Prud-
ham, consisted of K. Smith, Vancouver,
president; ‘M. Solski, Sudbury, secre-
tary; ‘J. Tees, Yellowknife, Northwest
Territories; D. Gold, Kimberley, B. C.;
R. Michel, Calgary; N. Thibault,. Sud-
bury, District 8 ‘Board "Member; H.
Murphy, Vancouver, B. C.-, Regional
Director; W. -Longridge, Calgary, In-
ternational Representative, andﬁL._ Rob-
inson, Canadian Research Director.
Arising out of the Canadian Coun-
cil’s firstmieeting in Toronto imme-
diately prior to the Ottawa talks, a
brief dealing with conditions in the Ca-
"nadian base metals and gold mining in-
dustry was drawn up for presentation
to the Federiali? ministers. ‘

THE coIinﬁc1L's BRIEF empha-

sized the currént depression  the lead-‘ -

zinc industry due to “disastrous” price
drops in _tho,_se,,,metals resulting in se-
vere unemploygment of mine workers.

“This situation,-” the biiief pointed-

out, “is made [worse by the fact that
there is only one smelter for lead, and
zinc in Canada,Lnamely, 1 : smelter at
Trail, B. C. In many mining communi-
ties the situation is as bad today as it
was at the depth of the depression 20
years ago. Government measures to
meet this situation are urgently neces-

in

sary. The International Union of Mine,. . .

Mill and Smelter Workers proposes:
“A. A government price support pro-

gram guaranteeing a minimum price of

20 cents a pound for both lead and zinc.
“B. The building by the government

of a custom smelter in Western» Can-

ada so that all mines will be able to
produce‘ without being dependent on

the smelter at-~.1Trail for processing of-

their ore. _ .. ' *

-,f‘C..Broadening of export markets-
overseas, particularly in the .British‘

Commonwealth and Europe, with ap-

propriate arrangements for payment by 1

means of increased mutual trade. Un-
hampered trade with all countries of
-the world willing and able to buy_'_Ca-

3

,{‘

prices” that prevailed for these metals

‘since 1945.

The minister of trade and commerce
was positive the government would not
consider a floor price of 20 cents for

‘lead or zinc because it would mean

selling at world market prices and the
Canadian people absorbing the loss
through subsidy. He said that subsi- ,
dizing marginal and inefficient lead
and zinc companies was unjustified.‘
AS FOR THE BIG lead-zinc mines,
Mr. Howe pointed out that these com-
panies had made big profits when lead,
and zinc were selling for four and five
cents and that during the years of
high prices these companies made huge
profits. He pointed out that CM&S last
year paid the full divir‘ "ds of Cana-

dian Pacific Railroad out of its profits. —

CPR is a majority stockholder in
CM&S.

When the heavy lay-offs at the New
Calumet Mines in Bryson, Quebec, was
brought to his attention, Mr. ‘Howe
said he did not believe that mine would
shut down and that the lay-offs were‘
of a temporary nature. He said that
the government would have to start
some public works there to take up
the slack until the mine wentinto full’
operations again._ M ‘ A

Comment in the Canadian Council's
brief that copper was now becoming
uncertain and a-suggestion that similar
measures to those proposed for lead-
zinc be considered by the"‘government,
brought the reply from Mr. Howe that
there seemed no ‘cause for concern for
that metal. He" thought the price may
stabilize at a slightly lower _level.than
now in effect but that the future of
that metal was quite good.

ON MATTERS relating to the de-
pressed gold‘ mining industry, the Ca-
nadian Council’s brief proposed:*

“A.‘~'l‘hat the Canadian government-2
ioin with other gold producing coun-
tries in demanding that the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund abrogate all re-
striction on the sale of gold, so that
the price of, gold may be permitted to-
increase substantially.

“B. That, failing such measures, the
Canadian government withdraw from
the Fund and adopt its own effective
remedial measures with regard to gold

A which ‘are required.”

 The Federal Cabinet member insist-
ed that the gold producing countries,
including Canada, could do nothing

‘.9 about the United States refusal to raise

the price of gold. He said that with-

‘ ;: drawal from the Int'l Monetary Fund

\

 would not solve any problems for they

about the ‘plight of the {industry or

  SHORT. TIME AGO I had occasion to participate in a radio debate concerning
   the submerged lands legislation Cll1‘l'e:_,I_ll1ly being debated in Congress. This legisla-
._, S tion would give to a few States tremendously valuable assets now held by the
} §—_i?7/~ Fedeiral Government. ’ "  1.‘ " . ._  . _
I ' I don’t know the Hooper rating Vof} _.t_Vhe. pa.rticul‘ar program, but I think it is

..,l_, ‘K
.‘t

: reasonable to assume that when the program was announced, somewhere, let'”us'

V:  say in _Burlington, Vt., a housewife promptly switched to her favorite comedy

-program, a cabinetmaker in Topeka turned on the fights, and the ‘publisher of~.a '

small weekly newspaper in Utah sought a livelier source -of possible news forhis

._columns. It is resonable to assume that they, and thousands like them, were not
interested in the subject matter under discussion, in the [complacent belief that ;

they were not materially concerned 1'
affected.’ a -.

Yet’ the chances are that that very
day the housewife had had occasion
to be outraged at the high cost of
beef, that the cabinetmaker was con-

cerned about the shortage of top-qual-it

ity_ lumber, and that the publisher
could deliver quite a discourse on the

» perilous position of small independent
newspapers because of the newsprint
‘crisis.

All might be somewhat incredulous
to hear that their immediate problems
are not only closely interrelated, but
also part of the same basic problem
involved in the submerged lands de-
bate—the problem of achieving the
most productive and efficient utiliza-

, l tion of our- natural resources.

Waste affects cost’
IT is all part of one package. Waste-
ful exploitation of grazing lands in

_,_Wyoming affects the housewife’s food

budget in Vermont. Wasteful cutting

practices in the forests of California"

set up a chain reaction which affects
not only our cabinetinaker and our pub-
lisher but thousands of others engaged
in hundreds of occupations ‘on farm
and in factory.‘ Moreover, unwise util-
ization of our ’mineral resources has a
direct and heavy impact on every

phase of our great industrial machine, .

and upon our national security as well.
All of us careconcerned intimately
in this interplay of‘forces; we are all
in‘ the same boat. Our ultimate physi-
cal well being, our standard of-living,
, depends on the sum total of our physi-

‘V cal assets and the ingenuity with which '

-they are put to use.

Certainly 'we would not allow our
.neighbor.to set fire to his own house
-— because he would thus endangerthe
entir-e community. Yet often we are

unconcerned when he wastes our water
and wears out our soil and our mineral
resources.

So far as the role of Government is
concerned, it should be clear that the
Government should bring its influence
to bear on resource utilization_ prob-,
lems to protect the interest of all‘ of

V V the people and not just some of the
people. When the Government engages  "

in give-away programs of its own

. Federal assets, you ‘may. not realize
it,_bnt it is your pocket that is being
picked. '

It is difficult for Americans to tahe 
these problems seriously. Our Nation "
grew up in a tradition of unparalleled - 
abundance. It is hard for us to realize? 

there is. a. bottom to the barrel. I do
_ not suggest we are on the brink ‘- of
disaster. It must "be recognized, how-
ever, that to a considerable extentour
tremendous growth and economic de-

velopment,were"achieved by expendi- *
,.ture. of resource capital which is ir-
' wreplaceable. I

VSelf-sufficiency gone

  the period encompassing the two
i  .world wars. our economy consumed

Vlnore mineral Iiésources than in all our
previous history. V‘
sWe have shifted from a position‘ of

‘the ,world’s7largest exporter -of raw._

 :tt.ll- employment,

materials, to a position of almost‘com-
pleteidependence on import for such
vital materials as chromium and man-
ganese, and to“ significant dependence
on import for lead, zinc~'and copper.
We have become an oil-importing na-
tion to the tune of one million bar-
rels a‘-day. ‘ » =

place them. According‘ to the United

AM not one of those who sees the l

- shadow of poverty and ruin in every
shovelful of material extracted from
the earth. On the contrary, I can fore-

.see continued growth and development

of this nation on an unprecedented
scale, if our assets are wisely em-
ployed. Such productive utilization,
however, does not come about by it-

.O.scar Chapman vvosisecretory, of the Interior until the
change of administration last January 20. Previously. he had

served as Assistant Secretary under Harold lckes.

_ His article on this page wqg prompted by concern over the
reversal of previous government policyof conserving of least
sonic" public resources for the benefit of all the people.

only in lumber, but in“ soil erosion

page upon page. I do. not cite them,
however, as evidence: t of ‘impending
doom. I cite them only to try to em-
phasize the importance of an enlight-

“Nature,” wrote Francis Bacon in
the seventeenth century, “to be com-
manded, must be obeyed.”

Perhaps President Theodore’ Roose-
velt had this bit of Baconian philosophy
in mind when he sounded the alarm
against ruthless and destructive ex-
ploitation of our natural ~ resources
and set us on the road toward a pro-
ductive national policy in this field. A
great deal of progressihas been made.

In 1902, Congress passed the, Recla-
mation Act, designed to promote the
development of the small family-size
farm and the conservation and proper
useof water in the West. In 1905, the
Forest. Service was set up, and addi-
tional parts of the public domain were
withdrawn so that forests might be
preserved.
Act was enacted to guide and’ govern
water power development.

In 1933, with the birth of the Tennes-
see Valley Authority, the interrelation-
ship am<‘mg"res_.ources -was given spe-
cific recognition. Flood control, navi-
gation development, soil conservation,
power development, restoration ‘of for-
ests and wildlife resources, all be-
came part of a’ single plan. The South-
east has become a fertile source of

A strength for the entire nation during

the past 20 years.
Similar progress has been achieved
in the Pacific’ No‘rthwest,/ through the

Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams and ‘A

related projects. Shasta and 'Friant

. , did the same for-the now rich, once
Central - Valley of California.’
Moreover, a start has been made on,

the biggest and most needed viob of
all——that of'con‘trolling, the waterssof
the great Missouri for the~benefit" of
the region and the nation. » '

Conservation gains '

‘ SINCE 1934‘, the. wastingpublic do-'
', t main has been greatly rehabilitated.’ ' T

In 1906, the General Dam '

South "Carolina; Hoey and ‘Smith,

mode:-it science and technology has’

been brought to bear on the problems
of conserving our mineral resources
and finding new ones. . .
Thus our raw materials picture is
neither as black as the prophets of
despair would paint it, nor as bright_
as painted by those rugged individual-
ists who debunk all the warning signs."
We have not yet become a “have not"?
nation, nor need we become one ‘in the
foreseeable future. That is not to say,’
however, that we may not become one '
nevertheless. '

g The determining factor will be the ,/V "V-
natural resources policy we adhere’ to,‘

as a nation. As always there will be
a clash between the immediate com-

mercial and industrial pressures upon 0

our resources, and our ‘long-run eco-
nomic‘ and security objectives. -
It is often difficult for a farmer to

understand that a bumper crop does‘ 
him little good if it undermines his
soil and thus destroys his capital. Sim-Vg,_ Q
ilarly, cattlemen who cannot get un-_'V
restricted access to grazing lands or ’ V
lumbermen to forests may rant against '

an unfeeling government. . _

In the same way, our hungry indus-_’«
try would like to rush in and swal-‘L
low up our richest materials sources?
in tremendous, rapid bites, to get more}
production and more income now. But?-
we_musl; hold the line, or eat ourselve IV
up. The plain fact is that what‘is"—
good for a given industry at a given-

-time may not always be good for the’

country.
Everybody's fight _
- AN we hold the line? 1 don't know.’
In my testimony before the Sen-V7
ate Interior Committee consideringVthe,;
submerged lands legislation, I stated
that I feared this legislation not -sole-‘
ly because it was unwise and unfair"
to give _these assets away, but also,
because of the pattern that it estab-
lishes. The pattern has not been‘long-‘V
in taking shape. , . 
_ Legislation has been introduced»'
granting all minerals and minera._
rights in the xpubliclands of the United-v_
States to the ‘states within which they’-.
are situated. A move has been begun}
to put control of public grazing into
private hands. At least onesenato
has even suggested that we sell TVA
to private interests. ~
These are signs of our times. There

5. KOREAN’ WAR .

_ PROMISE. To end the Korean war honorably and
early. .‘fThe first task of a new Administration will be
to review and -ire-examine every course ‘of action oped
to us with onevgoal in view: to bring the Korean "war to
an early andhonorable end. That is my pledge to the
American‘ people.” Detroit, Oct. 24, 1952. ' __ ,

PERFORMANCE. The war in Korea still goes on.
The Magazine of Wall Street says: “General Eisenhower
has‘. mapped a campaign plan for more cold war,” as it

comments on the President’s big April 16 speech .ad- I

vancin a “new foreign olic .
.3 _ _ .

6. PUBLIC POWER 

PROMISE. To continue and extend public power,
reclamation program. “Anyone who thinks, I. am not
interested in flood control and all the reclamation proj-
ects that we have in sight and others that will stand
the test of practicability is just simply talking through
his hat.” Fargo, N. D., Oct. 4, 1952.

PERFORMANCE. Interior Secretary McKay an-
nounced the Hell’s Canyon project will .be handed over
to the Idaho Power Co. to develop piecemeal in. its own
wa.y——and for its own profit. The Interior Department
budget was cut $202 million .Twelve hundred employes

of the U. S. Reclamation Bureau are being laid off by.

June 30. I ,

Ornfe Lewis, who openly advocates putting all public
domain into private hands, has been app_ointed Assistant
Secretary of Interior in charge of land management and

territories. A Con'gressional movement—led by Repub- 5

licans——- is developing to turn over federal lands, forests
and niineral rights to the states—which means exploita-
tion by private interests. I
McKay‘ has announced plans to hand over public
power projects, paid for- out of taxpayersmoney, to

private utilities for exploitation. A move is under way _

to let private interests take over atomic» energy pro-
gram. President Eisenhower -has. announced plans to
turn" government-owned synthetic rubber plants over
to private industry.

7. GOVERNMENT SPENDING

PROMISE. To cut government spending. ;“_I tell you
from my own experience, Scrutiny of militaryspeiiding
can effect substantial savings in our huge defense pro-
gram.” Troy, N-. Y., Oct. 22, 1952. ' ’

V PERFORMANCE. Some cuts are being made in the
milita.ry budget——nobody yet knows how much. But the
Administration -is not mentioning that there 9 still is
some $90 billion in l,ef\t—over appropriations fontmilitai-y

purposes, still unspent. And the biggest cuts ,made so '

far proportionately have been in the budgets of agencies
serving the peaceful needs of the people. I

Move to’. and grain inspection V
WASHINGTON=—(yFP)——A recent joint announce-
ment by, the Agriculture Dept. and the foodfand drug

division_ of the Health, Education & Welfare Dept. said‘ ‘ If

thetwojhad agreed on a program “to promote im--
provement in. the harvesting,‘ storage, transportation
and processing of grain.”

Oneelement in the new program, the announcement

» said, was to set aside temporarily-certain enforcement

aspects of a program adopted last year.’ Elsewhere
it was learned this meant an end to inspection of grain
for -rodent filth and presence-of insects. The change
was demanded by the grain dealers:

him (the Anterican worker) a high level. of wages with
steady purchasing power so he and his family can share
fully in the comforts of American living.” Boston, Nov.

.1, 1952. . -

_ PERFORMANCE. The 'President= rejected a’ C10

.proposal that he call a conference to consider the’prob-
. lem of full employment when peace comes.

;-No action at all has been taken to meet the crisis in
the lead, zinc, coal mining, shipbuilding, textile indus-

. tries. Thousands of workers in all these industries are

jobless. - _ ’
“Steady purchasing power” is impossible when you

don’t have a job, or when high taxes and high prices are

grabbing most of‘ your wages. _ ~ ‘

9. CORRUPTION

, PROMISE. To eliminate corruption. ‘_“I pledge, a
restoration of integrity and competence to our national
government. The new administration will not tolerate
any deviation from an uncompromising code of honesty

and ethics in government service.” Boston, Nov. 1, 1952.-

‘VPERFORMANCE. The report of the Senate Sub-
committee which investigated Sen. Joe McCarthy’s fi-
nancial affairs was presented to Congress in. January.

It showed: 1') that McCarthy diverted to his own -use 
money contributed to..hi1n to “fight reds,” 2) that Mc— ‘

Carthy used inside government information to trade ‘on,
the soy bean market, 3) that McCarthy and his assistant
Ray Kiermas deposited a total of $144,501.84 to their
personal bankaccounts from sources undisclosed.

This information has been in the hands of the "At-
torney General and the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue since January, yet no step has been taken to prose-
cute McCarthy. And the White House has not lifted a
finger. ., '

After weeks of silence, the Republican Party had to

ask for the resignation of its National Chairman, Wesley ..

Roberts, whose “influence peddling”
the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Charles E. Wilson a.nd other members of the “Billion-
sire Cabinet” tried every possible maneuver to. keep
stock and control over their corporations, after President

was uncovered by

Eisenhower ‘named them to contract—awarding positi ns.

I0. WITCH-HUNTS

PROMISE. To protect" nation without witchhunts.
“We will not engage in witchhunts or character assas-
sination.” Boston, Nov. 1, 1952.

PERFORMANCE. The atmosphere of repression,-
hysteria and fear is-even worse now than it was before
Eisenhower was inaugurated. A n'ew_.~program to “screen”

‘government workers has been set up. Agency heads 

are given even‘ more power to decide who stays on the

payroll, \_vho-gets fired. The test is now “security”

rather than “loyalty.” And it goes without saying that

anyone who ever joined a union or had a. liberal thought

is “insecure.” - I « .

McCarthy runs wilder than ‘ever—-—without rebuke

from the White House._ Velde "and Jenner “investigate”.
schools, colleges and press; they threaten to take on the

churches.

 SITE of the proposed Hell’s Canyon Dam is the deepest"i-iver
}.go‘rge in the United States . . . deeper than the Grand Canyon. But
{that isn’t half _as deep as Interior Secretary McKay and his Republican
-‘fi-lends want to bury any kind of public works project that would aid

,the people.

_ Senator Wayne Morse said McKay is a “well-recognized stooge of
 the tide-lands oil thieves, the private utilities gang and the selfish
  interests of the country who place materialistic values ahead of human

A § values.”

7, " Under McKay, the mile-deep Hell’s Canyon will be running over

_._. with profits for the private utilities. A publicly-built dam, 'u_sing
‘metals and creating markets for metals, would go a long way toward
relieving the kind of situation. that Brother Rudolfo P. Garcia, Presi-
dent of Local 907, testified about at the Small Business Hearings in

. - Phoenix, Arizona.

__ The entire-membership of Brother Garcia’s localwas thi'owii out
 of work when the San Xavier mine shut down. He told the Committee:
.- _‘-:‘Our situation is very serious. Many of ‘our members, who are un-

  employed or partly employed 'are‘ losing their homes and possessions
3-which they were purchasing on time payments. We need Federal

.; j”’reli'ef, in addition to the inadequate unemployment _compensation—

5'.which we can’t seem to collect in the first place.”

I The heat from Hell’s Canyon will still be turned on Mr. McKay

and the Idaho Power Company by the People. The fight isn't lost. Not
;-,.,f ‘by a “dam-site.” Our members and locals should write encouragement
‘.7 ' to Congresswoman Gracie Pfost of Idaho, who is fighting McKay. We
'- yshoiild write strong letters to the Department of the ‘linterior, to Sen-
 ators and Congressmen. ' ' A

Contract mining conference in Butte of ”  

 "AS ANNOUNCED elsewhere in this paper, the International Union
 will sponsor a conference in Butte, Montana, at the end of this month

on the whole question of contract .bonus systems. ‘The conference is
I ’ developing means of protecting, and improving the
_ health and working conditions of the contract miners. " * A

A Appropriately, Int’l Rep. Herbert Lerner, writing in the current
 issue of March of Labor, says of all incentive systems that they" are
’  ‘.‘rle.s-igned to get the worker to willingly speed up, mentally and physi-
cally. The purpose, of course, is to get higher production invtheisaine

- t~in”ze . . . Most incentive or piece work systems resit-ltin a 50 %-higher
speed of labor than clay-rate work.” ‘ ' ‘ ‘

. He goes on to say ,“Proaluction standards, incentive’ rat-es

and

 ' ’ This latter statement points up the purpose of the Butte; con-
‘ eference. The contract system is there and was put there by the em-
~ fployer. I doubt that it will be the purpose of the Butte conference to
-‘try. to eliminate it. But much can be accomplished ‘by representatives

of contract miners from'all over our union getting together and out-

. lining a program to cope with the pro

SAFETY AND HEALTH

Union must sharecontrol  

{in health, welfare plans

e THE i953 BARGAINING program adopted at the Mining,
Smelting and Refining Conference calls for “establishment of
greater union control over health and welfare plans” either

through the establishment of

trust funds or administration of

the various programs by joint employee-employer health and

‘ ' welfare committees.”

Why is if necessary 4
for, the Union '
to share control?
In the past, establishment of
group insurance or other pro-
grams by an employer was in-
variably done aspa paternalistic
gesture. designed to show the em-
~ ployer’s concern over the. welfare
of his employees. In almost every
instance, the employees contribu-

ted the greatest part of the cost.

-of these programs, while having
nothing to say as to_ their selection,
or types and amounts of benefits
.which they provided.

The employer who controlled the
‘program completely was in- a ‘po-
sition to use it, in some instances,
to prevent the growth of unions,
and to keep employees from push-
ing grievances by the threat of
withdrawal of the program.

 The employer usually led his
employees to believe that his con-
tribution to the program was a

_substantial one, though in most
cases, through the return of divi-
dends, tax advantages, etc., his
actual contribution to the cost was
negligible.

Since the plan ‘was not part ofa
union contract, the workers had no

i T  =i'say in its operation. They were, in

‘fact, in the position of being taxed
without representation.

Inithe last ten years, there has

J . been, a; rapid growth of health and
*-.welfare plans to which the em-

. ..-ployer’ contributed all or part of
 ;the costland which unionseither

‘ 0 ‘wholly or partly controlled. The

results can be plainly seen if pres-
cient day plans are compared to the
. old employer-controlled programs.
—- The benefits of such plans’ to ‘the
union members have doubled and

. tripled. \ '

‘With the advent or Taft-Hart-

~f ley, it became a requirement that —

plans must be jointly administered,
and”'cannot be controlled wholly by
_ the Union. Despite this fact, every
\ large jointly administered plan in
. the country shows clearly the ef-

l fects of, the full participation of

the Union in its management.‘

,It/has been, demonstrated over
and» overagain thatonce the em-
ployer has agreed to make a spe-

_ cific’ contribution‘ to a welfare
 _'program, it is the Union which

i g has the greatest" interest ~in~the

—— *p’rogram’s

, continuance and" im-
- vprovement.

Ii welfare—_.progra'ni.~ Only in this
 way," can ~ the j-.Uinion, »-be assured

_, that theibest plan available for
the amount of money has been
chosen. '

The plan must .be established in
such a way that the full amount
of the employer_’s contribution is
continuously used for benefits, and
not returned, to the employer to
reduce his cost. At the same time,
if sufficient surplus is- built up
in the fund, athé trustees gould
‘agree to increased benefits.with-
out the long and painful process
of negotiating a new set of bene-
fits when the Union contract
opens.

Longshore plan }
increased benefits
wifhouf; added charge

One of the best examples of a-

negotiated welfare plan which .is
jointly administered by the Union
andithe employers is the plan
which covers 15,000 West Coast
longshoremen.

This plan, which has one of the_

best and most efficient administra-
tions in the country, was able in
the first year of its life to in-
crease, benefits’ ‘on three separate

occasions,’ without any added con-;-

tribution from" the employers’ or
employes. At the same» time, the
trustees carefully guard the sta-
bility of the program so that the
benefits may be continued in full.

Prior to the establishment of.»-

this plan, limited static programs
had existed, scattered through the
industry, in which relatively. few
workers were able to participate,-

‘ and in which the benefits never
kept pace with the increased costs
of medical and hospital care.

‘ Someunionslhave had the bitter
experience of negotiating» what
they thought were a set of good
benefits in a welfare program,
only to find that their failure to
assureparticipation of the union‘
resulted finally in a welfare plan
-which ‘in no‘way met the needs
of their members.
Union must guard
members’ rights in plan
Aside from the‘ matter of bene-
fits and type of plan, there"_is an-
- other aspect of a welfare’ program
which makes it very important
that the Union participate in its
\ control. This is the matter of eligi-
bility. ' ~ . .

The eligibility of people to" par-,

. ticipate in the program; what
happens to their ‘benefits. when
they are on leave, sick, disabled or

. retired’ is of great concern to the
union. Theseprules must be es-
’ t‘ablished;‘initi__ally on a sound basis.
No one, however, can fforesee all
_the issues‘ that can arise once the
: program’. is ' in? effect.‘ Thus, the
rules and regulat‘-ions pertaining to

- eligibility. must’ be” under‘‘ constant

gitimateildifferences of opinion, even
on funtfamentals. Some things, how-
ever, should in my opinion‘ be ‘very
clear. 5» ‘ -  ;. I -

One is that this is everybody’s fight
-—no one ,.is unaffected. A second is
that the Congress, before‘ it engages
in give-away_programs, owes the peo-
ple of the United States_‘an account-

ing of the stake they have in our na-
tionally owned ‘resources.

Protect ALL the people"

NO businessman in his right mind

would enter into. ‘a ~deal_to _dis-
pose of properties without knowing
exactly what these properties contain
and howramuch'they are worth. Yet,
that is precisely what,.Congress is
threatening to do today. No one really
knows. how. many billion barrels of oil,
how many trillion cubic feet of gas,
how niarfy billion tons of coal, to men-
tion only-‘ a few examples, are con-
tained in‘ our nationally held lands.
No one linows’ how much ' they’ are
worth, although it is certain that the
sum would stagger irnagin: Ion.

‘That isewhy I urged the Senate to
establish». a., commission to inventory
and appraise our nationally held natu-
ral ‘resources ‘before proceeding with
the program to disposeof them. I re- .
new that recommendation now. It is
just plain ‘business sense.

Finally: another fact ‘should be clear
and undisputed. That is that the Fed-
eral Govei-nment ‘should use its powers
to . protect" the "interests of all the '
people in this great national heritage,
and not just some of the people. If .

_ we ever lost sight‘ of that we will have

COMPANY ‘ECONOMICS’ VS. FACTS 

A  -"To the Editor:

About a year ago the Kennecott
Copper Corp. inaugurated a course of
study in economics and these classes

l_ I are attended during working hours by '
‘ the employers where company trained"

‘ economists try to indoctrinate the
V workers with a company's eye view of
economics.
, They infer that in order to save
our economic system we must tighten
our belts and work harder for less
money.
That this is the only way the nation
can become prosperous.
.And then if somemalcontent has the

long run we shall all be greatly bene-
fited.”

Yet they never, succeed in explaining
just how all this is to be‘ accomplished.

Today the power of wealth produc- -
A tion is far greater than ever before in

the history of mankind. It has been re-
corded that in the United States the
rate of production was ~ doubled during
the war period‘ by the use—.of high speed
tools, greater mechanization and bet-
ter organization. And when we‘_ were
suffering from depression and unem-
ployment before the war,‘ official fig-
ures pshowed there was an increased
total output ‘with a million less workers

employed.

’ In other words, the machines were

taking the place .of human beings.
THE ONLY CURE for this "state of

/ audacity to ask how we became’pros-
j;~ ¢.’r~,':peI'OuS by eating less and working
~ ' . harder, the company trained expert

goes into a long and tedious explana-

.’tion, but never seems to come out

with even. so much as a weak answer.
=~ . LOOK. AT LIFE in any city and you

will find the privileged few living

luxuriously and dining sumptuously
‘ from tables laden with choice foods.

' But outside this magic circle the
common people have a hard and
meagre means of living, especially with
the fall in the value of the dollar and
rising cost of living.

Much of our post-war industrial
strife is due to the opposition put up
"by the people against‘ having their
standard of living depressed. But still,
the big business trained experts tell us
that the only remedy for our economic

_ ills is for tlie poor to endure greater

poverty, more speed up and less money.
‘They tell us that we must not try to
‘ "make our wages keep up with the ris-

ing cost of living, but must be ready
’ and willing to go short.

CHOW A COUNTRY can get on. its
feet by lowering the standard of living
of the worker is something that only
the big business experts can explain.

But then, they’ve explained some

«grnighty curious policies ‘in the past.

j ;Remember when the fight was on to

‘limit the working day to eight hours,
and the experts explained that this
would mean ruin to our industries, that
all the factories made their profits
during the tenth hour?

But the wheels of industry still con- I .

tinue. to hum.
With the introduction of modern ma-
I chinery _in the factories, hand workers
toiled and starved in hopeless competi-

_ "tion and the experts explained again '
‘ ~ , ,-that it was all for the best in the long
. .\ ‘run, and still the wretched generation

lived and died miserably, but the eco-

nomic experts cared nothing for that.

‘Their idea of the value of economics

,' was just to show the workers that they

. .could not get what they wanted.
TO GET BACK "to the modern ad-
vocates of lower wages, longer hours

 and greater austerity.‘ Of course thg

‘_ country would become prosperous with
such a policy, on the assumption that

the country and the -working people.

were entirely different entities. Push

' 'the workers down and you elevate the

, ‘country. A point of view not in har-

4 ..-“1T'mony with the sane thinking of any
" j‘ ‘Worker. .

--Always they say, “Oh, but in the

affairs is to push up consumption, to
have a higher general standard of liv-
ing, to cut down the accumulation of
surplus goods.  = ,

We all know. there has been an
enormously increased power of. wealth
production in the last few years.

Take the new -textile mill Twith its
rows of looms like an armygwith its
small number ‘of -workers ; employed
among the rows of spinning. machines
here andthere tending‘ a Whole section.

The same is true" in all industries
throughout ‘the. nation. It :. never was
possible to create so muchiwealth be-
fore, and do it so easily.

AND WHEN‘ WE demand a higher,
standard of living for helping.,to pro-
duce this enormous wealth, the eco-
nomists tell us about, payments, ‘ex-
ternal trade, and competition on the
world market. I guess the worker's in
other countries are told the‘ same old
story—that they cannot have an im-
mediately_'ﬁigh'er standard" I of living,
but must tighten ’their“belts and en-
dure more poverty in order to compete
in the world’s _-markets...- If every
worker in the whole‘ world is sacrific-

ing in the interest of trade, what in’

heaven's name happens to all the sur-
plus wealth produced -in every country ?
..A question‘ that will go, una_nswe'red
by the experts till doomsday.

The laboring class has" "a _right to
demanda greater share of‘"tlie ‘wealth
that can be turned out ‘so7ab'u‘ndantly.
If the experts say that it is impossible
because the present mechanism of eco-
nomics demands that the wealth pro-
ducers should live -poorly, then we bet-
ter see if something can’t.,be'_ done to
change it. 4 __ ‘

OUR ATTITUDE towardfthe divi-

.sion of the national wealth can be.

stated quiteisimply and clearly. As the
total is increased"-the worker"should

-have an ever-increasing share, so he -_

can enjoy a little more of ‘the good
things of life, and his children get a
better break and ac fuller life. For

whatever the workers getmasses over ,

the counters. quickly and "stimulates

trade, which makes" for more produc- '
'tion. 4- * .. ,

Remember that the lack of customers

in‘ the early 30's: forced. men‘ to sell, V

apples on the street corner. to ‘stay
alive. " ' ' '

8 18 families in Sonora

SONORA, Ari’/..——Eighteen families
here have been forced to leave their
homes, with no place to go, because
Kennecott Copper Corp. extended its
open pit mine too close and caused
ca\sé—ins. Extreme hardship has been
caused to these families and to others
with whom they have had to double up.

In this isolated mountain mining
camp. there are just so many houses.
poorly-built as they are, and there is
no place for a Jlexican-American miner
to take his family to live when his
house has to go for the sake of Ken-
necott’s profits.

Some have doubled up, with two

families living in two or three room
shacks unfit to house cattle.
" One family with seven children
moved into a two room shack, but the
beds are out in the open air because
there's not enough room inside for
them.

There is the town of Ray, a half-
mile down the hill, but that is a com-
pany town, restricted to “Anglos"
only. There are good houses in Ray,
some of them brand new. Mine—Mill
Local has stepped up its campaign to
end discrimination in company housing.

LOCAL 915 took the initiative in
calling for meetings to which were in-
vited representatives from veteran's
organizations, businessmen, in e n ' 3

Goldwater hears
from M-M Local 9l5

RAY—SONORA, Ariz.—President Ja-
cob S. Mercado and Secretary. Roy
Abril of l\*line—l\lill Local 915 have writ-
ten a letter on behalf of the local to

V. Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican.

The letter_\\’as in sharp rebuke for
Goldwater's treatment of a Mine—Mill
delegation vvhich interviewed him sev-
eral weeks ago in Phoenix. ‘
§::‘We are not interested in your red-
baiting,” said the letter, “as that feeds
or clothes or houses none of us; that
only helps the copper companies in
the state of Arizona. It is our belief
that you should be using your office
to’ help ALL the people of Arizona, in-
cluding the common people, and not
spend so much of your timr trying to
appease the giant copper companies."
“The membership of this local union
expresses deep diﬁatisfaction with the
Senator in his walking out on the duly
representative body of copper miners
in the hotel meeting in Phoenix,” the
letter said.

clubs, ladies’ clubs, ladies’ auxiliaries
and church groups in both Ray and
Sonora. '

At one of these meetings last week,
a committee was elected representing
virtually all organizations in Sonora
and some in Ray. and agreed on a
program of demands. _

The committeee is calling for imme-
diate housing for the families driven
out of their homes as the result of
cave-ins. They contend that the com-
pany now has about 20 empty houses
in Ray that can be made available im-
mediately.

THE SECOND demand is for the..

company to build more housing both in
Ray and Sonora, clean up the town of
Sonora and get rid of the open sewers.
The third demand calls for an end
to the company's discriminatory rental
policy. It proposes that housing in
Ray be made available to" Mexican-
American workers on the basis of
length of service and size of family.

  Predict June hearings on  
Murray mine safety bill-

WASHINGTON, D. C. —— Staff members of both the Sen-
ate and House Labor Committees indicated last week there is
a good chance the committes will hold hearings in June on
the Murray mine safety "bill and its companion measure in-
troduced by Rep. Kelley of Pennsylvania.

The Senate bill is S. 1599; the other is HR. 4825.

The bills call for “inspections and investigations in me-
tallic and nonmetallic mines and quarries for the purpose of
obtaining information relating to health and safety condi-
tions, accidents, and occupational diseases ‘therein.’’

The proposal is being called a heath and safety reporting
bill. Its. passage would mean that information, much of which
is not now made available to the U. S. Bureau of Mines, would

be reported fully.

Mine-Mill locals and members can help make sure these
bills are acted on by this session of Congress. Write your
Congressmen and Senators a letter, urging‘ that they work for

passage of the bills.

Send letters and resolutions also to Rep. Sam McConnell,
chairman of the House Labor Committee, and to Sen. H. Alex-
ander Smith, chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, urging
them to schedule hearings on the mine safety and health re-

porting bills quickly.

Tennessee Mine-Mill local unions in
quarterly conference at Columbia

I COLUMBIA, Tenn.———More than 30-
delegates from Mine—Mill local unions
in this state assembled in the Local
546 hall early this month for the quar-
terly Tennessee Mine—Mill Conference.

The one-‘day meeting heard first a

§,f~;9§)0l'l' from Int’l rep. J. P. Mooney

reviewing‘ the-"progress of our Hine-
llilill locals in Tennessee during the
past three years, and telling about-the

‘current union-busting campaign of the ~

companies in Rockwood. —

The delegates then heard first hand
reports on what the “Big Business Ad-
n~.inist.ration” in Washington has in
store for labor. These reports were
made by Regional Director Asbury

I ‘Howard, A. 0. "Collins of Local 314,

and Buford Attkisson of Local 278, all
of whom attended the Mine-Mill Legis-
lative Conference in Washington re-
cently.

Vice President Charles Wilson spoke
on the national situation, pointing out
that the Administration’s tax reduc-
tion program aims to help the rich and
not the poor.

After‘ Vice President Wilson ex-.
plained the dangers in the Goldwater-
R'hodcs bill, several delegates wrote
letters to Tennessce.Senators asking
that they act to defeat the bill.

I-nt’l rep. Linus Wampler and dele-
gates from Ducktown, Tcnn., reported
on progress in the campaign to bring

 A the Ducktown miners back into Mine-
" Mill. 2 .

   

"and a letter

Board Member Alton Lawrence led
an educational cl i s c u s s i o n, which
showed how President Roosevelt ‘feared

as far back as 1938 that Big-Business
would eventually get complete control
of government, as they now have.

 The Conference was attended by

delegates.‘ from Locals 278, 314, 486,
546, 547,579 and 583, as well_ as five
delegates from Ducktown. . _

They voted to send a letter of sup-
port to Clinton Jencks, who has been
brought up on Taft-Hartley. charges,
to Attorney General
Brownell demanding that the charges
against Jencks be dropped.

more world trade

BAYARD, N. M.—President Dwight

Amalgamated Bayard District Union,
Local 890, urging him to take steps.
aimed at an immediate armistice in

“This question of rearming has
caused a crisis in the metals industry
where thousands of American workers
are out of work right now," said the

president Juan Chacon.

“If peace in all the world can be ne-
gotiated, the barriers between nations
can be dropped, and trade among all
nations can be resumed immediately.
And the demand for our products will
rise,” it concluded.

Missouri local
wins back pay

STE. GENEVIEVE, Mo.——l>'ack pay
checks totalling $2,000 were pocketed
recently by more than 30 members ot’
Mine—Mill Local 883 as the result of an
arbitrator's decision on piecework
bagging operations. /

The ruling granted a new rate for
bagging pebble lime at the Mississippi

cut the piecework rate because a new
method of operation had been installed.

material to community

BAYARD, N. M.——Some community
leaders and businessmen in this area
have received a message from Mine-
Mill Local 890, signed by its president,‘
Juan Chacon.
Attached to the message are copies
of the testimony presented by Mine-
Mill International officers to the House
Small Business Committee during its
Denver hearings on the lead-zinc crisis. ‘

Chacon’s message is plea that the
community leaders and businessmen
take twenty minutes or so to read this
testimony. “You will see,” he says,
“that our Union is doing all it can to
help the small metal producers who
really need help and to make more jobs
for American workers.”

And’ the letter concludes: “If you
care about providing jobs for men with
families, for seeing to it that bills are
paid and that payrolls keep on provid-
ing storekeepers with a living please
do the following. Write to the four
