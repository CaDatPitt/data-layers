the states of Western Europe into a military alliance under

United States leadership, directed against the Soviet Union‘

and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.
This is the ‘meaning of the many proposals now coming
from such reactionaries as Hoover, Churchill, Baruch,
Bymes, Bevin, Attlee, etc., calling for the establishment
of a West European, anti-Soviet bloc. It is to clear the
way for such a war alliance that the Truman Government
is following the settled policy of by-passing and ‘paralyzing
the United Nations, of disregarding the Yalta and Potsdam
agreements, and of taking unilateral action as it sees ﬁt on
such vital issues as the civil war in Greece, the civil war
in China, the liberation war in Indonesia, the general
situations in Germany and Japan, and the whole matter of
world hunger relief and economic rehabilitation.

RESULTS OF THE MARSHALL PLAN-IN THE U.S.

As we have just seen, American imperialism, with its
Marshall Plan, has disastrous effects abroad by preventing

necessary reforms in Western Europe, by enabling Amer-

ican trusts to grab European industries, by weakening the
national independence of various countries for the beneﬁt
of Wall Street, by moving toward the establishment of a
fascist Europe, by reviving militarism under reactionary
leadership in many foreign countries, by the provocation
of civil war in various countries, and by the building of
a Western European. war alliance directed against the
U.S.S.R., all of which together amount to the active
organization of a World War III.

The Marshall Plan, with the reactionary imperialist
spirit behind it, also has most serious consequences upon
economic and political conditions in the United States.
Therefore, those trade union leaders, labor imperialists,
who have lashed their union organizations to the chariot

10

 

 

of American imperialism and who have joined hands with i

the biggest and most ruthless employers in supporting the
Marshall Plan, are betraying the workers and the whole
American people into the "hands of their worst enemy-
Wall Street. Organized labor will pay dearly, indeed it is
already doing.so, for allowing its reactionary leaders to
attempt to ram the Marshall Plan down the throats of
unwilling European workers, for its leaders’ cynical be-
trayals of the struggles of colonial and semi-colonial peo-
ples in Asia against American, British, Dutch, and French
imperialism, and for its crass abandonment of the workers
and peoples of Lat.in America to the encroachments of
Yankee imperialism. '
The ﬁrst and most immediate effect of American im-
perialism and the Marshall Plan within the United States
is to increase greatly the cost of living for the people. The
squandering of tens of billions of American dollars in
Europe and elsewhere in the world for reactionary eco-
nomic, political, and military purposes, with the blessing
of organized labor, is like pouring a huge quantity of
gasoline on the ﬂames of inﬂation now raging in the
Unit-ed States. It sends prices soaring and makes living
costs prohibitive, it’ is hurling this country into a great
economic crisis, and it is a major factor in creating the
worst drunken spree of proﬁteering that the United States
has ever known in peacetime. American imperialism robs
the workers and fattens- the capitalists. Thus while the
workers’ living standards sank seriously in 1947, the capi-
talists reaped 28 billions in proﬁts, or 61/2 billions more
than the year before. To make matters worse, the trade
unions are crippled in their capacity to defend the work-
ers’ interests by the fact that their conservative leaders are
tied up in entangling alliances with the employers and re-
actionary politicians in support of the Marshall Plan and
the general war program of American imperialism. The
Plan is a menace, not only to the economic welfare of the
‘ ll

   

peoples of Europe, but also to that of the whole American
people.

American imperialism, of which the Marshall Plan is
a major manifestation, also has as one of its consequences
a strong growth of political reaction in the United States,
as well as in Europe. If the agents of Wall Street are to be
successful in putting across their expansionist, war-breed-
ing policies abroad, naturally they urgently need a reac-
tionary political regime here in this country. Imperialism
abroad and reaction at home—-these are the two sides of
the one reactionary coin. Consequently, there are now,
paralleling Wall Street’s reactionary drive in other coun-
tries, niany signs of a sprouting fascism in the United
States. Among these sinister developments are the out-
rageous lynching attacks against the Negro people, the
shameless Red—baiting of the House Committee on Un—
American Activities, the disgraceful “loyalty oath” for
government employees, the passage of the Taft—Hartley
slave labor law, the arbitrary arrest of Gene Dennis, Alex
Bittelman, Claudia Jones and other Communist and pro-
gressive leaders, the emergence of the F.B.I. as an incipient
Gestapo, the attempts to outlaw the Communist Party,
etc., etc. All these dangerous developments are directly
linked up with Wall Street’s imperialistic foreign policies.
They constitute a deadly menace to the trade unions, as
well as to every other democratic institution in this coun-
try. The Marshall Plan has its implications of fascism for
our nation as well as for other peoples. And the danger
in all these threatening developments is made far worse
by the fact that the labor imperialist leaders of the A. F.
of L., C.I.O., and Railroad Brotherhoods are working
hand-in—glove politically with the reactionaries who are re-
sponsible for these threatening growths of fascism.

No-t only are American imperialism and the Marshall
Plan stimulatinginﬂation and creating a dangerous spirit
of reaction in this country, but they are also leading to

12

 

 

the wholesale militarization of our people. Wall Street,
planning for a war against the U.S.S.R., must necessarily

‘ build up a great and aggressive war machine in the United

States, and this is precisely what it is doing. All this mili-
tarism and jingoism in this country is the inevitable conse-
quence of the Marshall Plan. The United States now has
by far the strongest Airforce and Navy in the world, and
its Army is the best equipped. American air and naval bases
are scattered all over the world. American industries are
being systematically mobilized for war. The ‘imperialists
are clamoring for the introduction of universal military
training. They go right on piling up atombombs and
other super-deadly war weapons. Half of President Tru-
man’s 40 billion dollar budget for 1948 is for war prepara-
tions, and the warmongers are clamoring for more and
more funds. The Federal Government, as never before _in
peacetime, is in the hands of military men and the repre-
sentatives of Big Business. All this adds up to the develop-
ment of a war economy in this country. These preparations
for war, coupled with an ever more aggressive diplomacy
by the United States, go on in constantly increasing tempo.
The perspective before us, if this mad militarism and
atombomb diplomacy are not halted, is for a devastating
atomic war that will wipe out tens of millions of our
population and lead our country to ruin. The workers
are drastically opposed to- war and they ardently desire
peace, but their struggle against the constantly more
insolent warmongers is undercut and betrayed through
the support, by their leaders, of the Marshall Plan, of
which the present war-like diplomatic policies and direct
war preparations are deﬁnite phases.

COLLABORATION, NOT WAR THREATS

The Marshall Plan cannot succeed in bringing eco-
nomic health to the nations of Western Europe, or any-
whereelse in the world. Nor do its Wall Street sponsors

13

 

  
 

want it to do so. About the last thing they desire is that
there should be a lot of economically strong and politically
independent countries in Western Europe, able to com-
pete successfully against them in the world market.» Their
aim with the Marshall Plan is not economic recovery but
to get control of ever-ravished Europe and to organize it
for war against the Soviet Union. To this end their every
effort is being turned. ’

As we have seen, the Marshall Plan is making the situa-
tion worse in Europe and all over the world. Europe will
not get on its feet again economically until after it de-
feats the Marshall Plan imperialists and adopts such con-
structive measures as the peoples have applied in Central
and Eastern Europe. This requires that the democratic
masses in Western Europe must break the power of the
rnonopolists, the big bankers, and industrialists, and take
over the control of their nations’ economies through estab-
lishing truly democratic governments by nationalizing the
banks and key industries, and by making a start at national
economic planning. They must also establish democratic
trade relations with the U.S.S.R., the new European
democracies, and the great, formerly colonial countries of
Asia-——to all of which the Marshall Plan is opposed. In
short, Western Europe, like Eastern and Central Europe,
must begin to turn its steps toward Socialism. In Europe
the days of so-called “free enterprise” are numbered. This
is the lesson of present-day history, and all the powers of
Wall Street cannot negate this lesson nor breathe the
breath of life back again into dying capitalism.

One of the biggest lies of the present war drive of
American imperialism is that the Communists are trying
to sabotage European economic recovery. In reality, how-
ever, the Communists are the very best ﬁghters to rebuild
their countries’ economy. Graphic proof of this is'to be
seen in the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, where
the Communist Parties are decisively strong and where
14 ‘

 

 

the peoples are making rapid strides towards recovery.
Moreover, Western Europe can begin to recover only when
it adopts the policies championed by the Communists.

The American people should andmust help the fam-
ished peoples of Europe and of other parts of the world
to rebuild their shattered economies. These peoples, in
the general war against Hitlerism, suffered far greater
losses in human life and property than we Americans
did. Indeed, the United States actually grew fat and rich
on the war. It is therefore duty-bound to help liberally
those peoples who bore the brunt of the strife. The way
to do this is not through the war-breeding Marshall Plan,
but along the lines suggested by Henry A. Wallace.

In brief, the Wallace Plan of economic recovery calls
for liberal rehabilitation grants and loans by the United
States, especially to those peoples who suffered most heavily
in the war. These reconstruction funds would be allocated
to the various peoples without political conditions at-
tached, and they would be administered directly by the
United Nations. Such a program would insure a practical
handling of the recovery problem and would put an end
to the grabbing for world control which is the essence of

the Marshall Plan. It would also put the United Nations .

on its feet and make it into a real force for peace. The
Wallace Plan, too, would receive the hearty support of the
democratic peoples everywhere. It would bring about a
friendly spirit between the United States and the U.S.S.R.,
and it would liquidate the present widespread fear of and
preparations for war. War is not inevitable. They lie who
say that the American and Soviet peoples cannot live in

peace together._ But to accomplish this peaceful collabora-

tion the monopoly capitalists in the United States, who
are the originators of the Marshall Plan and the source of
American imperialism, must be soundly defeated by the
American people. ’

The Wallace general program meets the major immedi-

15 '

 

   

 

ate needs of the American people. However, it will have
to be supplemented, as the struggle sharpens, with still
more advanced measures, similar to those being adopted
by the peoples of Europe; especially the nationalization
of the banks and major industries under democratic con-
trols. The workers will have to begin to realize, too, that
in order to solve ﬁnally the tremendous problems con-
fronting them—low living standards, mass unemployment,
fascism, and war—they will eventually have to defeat the
monopolists decisively, abolish the capitalist system, and
begin the building of Socialism.

The Wallace Plan of economic recovery is the kind of
program that the leaders of labor should be ﬁghting for,
instead of their peddling away the workers’ interests by
running after Wall Street’s Marshall Plan. A program
of friendly international collaboration, such as that out-
lined in the Wallace Plan, would aid our own country
economically and also would help restore the devastated
countries of the world. Those A. F. of L., C.I.O. and
Railroad Brotherhood top leaders who are ballyhooing
the Marshall Plan and chattering N.A.M. slogans about
“free enterprise,” have abdicated the working-class leader-
ship which, as the heads of the basic economic organiza-
tions of the workers, they should be exercising. Just at
the moment when organized labor, _in order to realize the
democratic goals for which so many millions died during
the war against Hitlerism, needs most to be keenly on
the alert against those sinister forces trying to restore
fascism, the labor imperialists are playing the game of
Wall Street. They are following the insane policy of trying
to identify the workers’ interests with those of the great
capitalists here and abroad. They will not succeed!

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE THIRD-PARTY

It is only to be expected that the democratic peoples
of the world should be and are developing a powerful and
' 16

 

growing resistance to the imperialists——American, British,
French and Dutch—and against their Truman Doctrines,
Marshall Plans, and their many other similar devices for
imperialist conquest and exploitation. The great colonial
system of Asia is rapidly falling to pieces; India and
Burma have seriously weakened the controls over them
by Great Britain; Indonesia is in revolt against its Dutch
oppressors; Indo-China is aﬂame against the French; and
the vast People’s China is forging ahead in the establish-
ment of a new democracy in the face of a hostile combina-
tion of Chinese reaction and American imperialism. In

Europe, too, the peoples of various countries are increas-

ingly resisting the American and other imperialists. The
U .S.S.R. and the new democracies of Eastern and Central
Europe are refusing to be intimidated by the Marshall
Plan and by the atombomb threats behind it. In France,

Italy and other continental countries, the labor move-
.ments are waging a stern struggle against the attempts of

Wall Street American capitalists to subjugate their re-
spective countries. Altogether the world picture is one that
brings no joy to the big monopolists of Wall Street, and it
bodes ill to their schemes of world domination. The
central meaning of the world situation is that the demo-
cratic peoples who fought so resolutely against the Ger-
man-Japanese fascist imperialist would-be world conquer-
ors are not going to allow Wall Street to fasten its yoke
upon their neck. They are irresistibly building free demo-
cratic societies, and are moving toward Socialism

It is not surprising either that great democratic masses
in the United States should also be taking part in this
world-wide democratic resistance of the peoples against
the new imperialist attempts to enslave them. This is the
real signiﬁcance of the broad mass movement in this
country led by Henry Wallace, which is heading toward
the formation of a mass third party with its own Presi-
dential candidate in the coming national elections. This

17

 

  

third-party movement, in its foreign policies, ﬁghts against
the economic crises, fascism, national subjugation, and war
inherent in the Marshall Plan; and, in its domestic policies,
it combats the high cost of living, the fascist-like political
reaction, and the widespread militarization which are the
effects of the Marshall Plan and of American imperialism
generally in this country.

The VVallace movement is a grass-roots development.
It comes from -the foundations of the American people.
That is why it is so feared by the great capitalist interests
ofthis country. The latter had succeeded in mobilizing
both of the major parties, most of the top labor leaders,
and their innumerable agents in the press, the radio, the
church, the schools, etc., behind the imperialistic Marshall

- Plan. But now comes the broad third-party movement,

right up from the rank and ﬁle of the people, to threaten
their well-laid plans of warlike aggression. That is why
they are subjecting Wallace and the new movement to
a wild campaign of Red-baiting and bitter denunciation.

The masses in this country are opposed to war. This is
the reason they are warmly welcoming Wallace’s condem-
nation of American imperialism’s pro-war policies. The
people like, too, Wallace’s militant ﬁght against inﬂation,
his strong defense of the workers’ living standards, his
tireless struggle to preserve American civil liberties, and
his dogged campaign to prevent the United States from
being transformed into a military-dominated autocracy.
Large sections of the masses, particularly in the trade
unions, correctly see in Wallace the continuer of the pro-
gressive policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The strength
of Wallace’s following cannot yet be accurately measured,
but it certainly runs int_o the millions. The percentage of

these broad masses that can be brought out to the polls to

vote in the November elections will depend largely upon
the organizing skill and the day-to-day struggle against
18

 

 

reaction that will be developed by the new movement
between now and election day. ~

‘ The labor imperialists of top ofﬁcial circles of the A. F.
of L., C.I.O., and Railroad Brotherhoods are militantly
ﬁghting against Wallace and are trying to paint President
Truman in the guise of -a progressive. Their favorite
argument is that even though the workers may not like
all of Truman's record, nevertheless he is a “lesser evil,”

. as contrasted with any of the-prospective Republican can-

didates. But this argumentation is worthless. Truman is
simply a reactionary, and he offers no protection whatever
to the people against the big capitalist exploiters and
warmongers. He is as much an agent of Wall Street as
Hoover, Dulles, Dewey, Stassen, Taft, and other Republi-
can candidates.

The workers have not forgotten that it was Truman
who ruthlessly smashed the national strikes of the coal
miners and railroaders and who threatened to use the
Navy as a strike-breaking force against -the maritime work-
ers should they dare go out on strike. It was Truman, too,
who allowed the Taft-Hartley slave labor bill to become
law by refusing to mobilize the Democrats in Congress
against it, who formulated the notorious loyalty oath for
government employees, who is doing nothing (beyond
making vague promises) to halt the persecution of Negroes
and the development of anti-Semitism, who condones the
shamelessly reactionary activities of the House Un-Amer-
ican Committee, who is loading dozens of high government
posts with generals and Big Business leaders, who, only
46 days after Roosevelt died, invited the discredited Hoover
into the White House and thus -helped to again make a
powerful political ﬁgure of him, and who goes along arm-
in-arm with Wall Street in its war-like Marshall Plan and
other imperialistic foreign policies. The attempt to present
Truman to the people as progressive is absurd.

Another argument being made against the Wallace

Labor and the Marshall Plan

By WILLIAM 7.. FOSTER

ONGRESS and the whole United States are now

discussing the Marshall Plan, under which it is pro-
posed that this country shall within four years loan or give
17 billion dollars to various European countries. The con-
sequences of this plan, both foreign and domestic, will
constitute the central issues in the approaching Presi-
dential elections. The Marshall Plan is being put forth
as a program for the economic recovery of Europe and
other sections of the war-torn world. On this basis the bulk
of the top leaders of the A. F‘. of L., C.I.O., and Railroad
Brotherhoods are calling upon the workers to join hands
with the Truman Administration, the Republican Party,

I the National Association of Manufacturers, and with other

    

conservative forces to support this so—called bipartisan
European Recovery Plan (E.R.P.).

In reality the Marshall Plan is not a program of eco-
nomic recovery. The essence of it is’an attempt of the big
corporations of this country, who rule both the Repub-
lican and Democratic Parties, to establish their control
over Europe, as a part ofitheir larger scheme to dominate
the entire world. It is a war plan. Any degree of economic
recovery that may take place because of its expenditures
is entirely secondary to its basic war’ aims. Those labor
leaders who are supporting the Marshall Plan are, there-
fore, wittingly or unwittingly, sacriﬁcing the interests of
the workers to the warmongers, and are allowing Wall

.2

candidacy by the labor imperialists, pseudo—liberals, and
other supporters of Truman and the Marshall Plan is that
a third-party candidate in the ﬁeld will bring about the
election of a reactionary Republican President. But peo-
ple who talk like this should straighten out their argu-
ments with those backers of Truman who are claiming
that now that the President is freed of the “handicap” of
being supported by the Communists and other progressive

 

forces he will attract such strong support of the “respect- .

able” people of the country that he will win the election
in a walk.
« Actually, the voting strength of Wallace will by no
means be drawn exclusively, or even mainly, from the
ranks of regular Democratic voters. First, Wallace has the
official support of many progressive international unions
of the C.I.O., comprising about one-fourth of that organ-
ization, who, in any event, would not vote for Truman.
Second, he will draw heavily from the farmers, who tradi-
tionally vote Republican, and third, he will ﬁnd his main
source of strength from those several millions of workers,
both A. F. of L. and C.I.O., lower trade union oﬂicials,
Negroes and middle-class elements, who, disgusted with
President Truman’s abandonment of Roosevelt’s policies,
stayed away from the polls in 1946 and who, were there
the choice only between a Truman and a Republican in
1948, would likewise abs-tain from voting this year.
Conservative labor leaders and so-called liberals, mouth-
ing the phrases of outright reactionaries, are declaring
that, the third—party movement is a “Red plot.” Frank
Kingdon, a radio commentator, says, for example, that it
was the Communist Party that called upon Wallace to
run for President. But Mr. Kingdom and others like him
ignore the tremendous mass meetings that Wallace’has
been holding all over the country, which indicate his
broad mass following among the people. The demand for
Wallace rises right from the ranks of the American people,
who are alarmed by the warlike course of the Government.

20

Of course, the Communist Party, which supports all pro-
gressive developments, has long been champion of the
third party. A recent newspaper poll estimated Wallace’s
prospective vote in New York State at 1,000,000. To desig-
nate such a wide mass movement as a “Red plot” is a
travesty on common sense. Scores of millions of workers
in other countries also are looking with hope -to the Wal-
lace candidacy as _a great means for preserving peace.

Labor leaders are alleging also that for a worker to vote
for Wallace means to throw his vote away. This is non-
sense. The Wallace third-party movement is of profound
importance po1itically—which is why the reactionaries are
so alarmed by i-t. First, the third-party candidacy will pro-
voke a real national discussion of the Marshall Plan war
policies now being followed by the Truman Administra-
tion. Up to this time all the American people have had in
that respect has been a big dose of imperialist propaganda,
dished out freely by both parties and by all the other
opinion-shaping agencies of capitalism. But now American
foreign policy, especially the Marshall Plan, will. be
brought out into the open and given a thorough discus-
sion. It is of major importance in the ﬁght for peace that
the people should understand clearly the dangers to which
the Marshall Plan is leading them.

Second, the third-party movement will give the people
a real opportunity to conduct a day-to-day ﬁght against the
inﬂationists, proﬁteers, Red-baiters, and warmongers;
against all those exploiters who are ruining the American
people's living standards, undercutting our national de-
mocracy, and driving us toward war. As things have previ-
ously stood, with the conservative. leaders of labor tied to
the coat-tails of Wall Street and its reactionary foreign
policy, the ﬁght against the reac-tionaries has been feeble
and ineffective. The warmongers have been virtually with-
out organized opposition. But the third-party movement,
by awakening the people politically and aligning them

21

    

 
 

against Wall Street, brings the masses into daily struggles
and thus deﬁnitely slows up or defeats the drive in this
country toward economic crisis, fascism, and war.

Third, the third-party movement will greatly enhance
the opportunity to elect a progressive Congress. The
Wallace candidacy will s-tir into political action large
masses of voters who otherwise would stay away from the
polls. This increased turnout of voters will everywhere
improve the chances of progressive candidates for election
to the Congress. This is a factor of vital signiﬁcance.

Fourth, the third party movement will bring about the
beginning of the far-overdue independent political action
of organized labor and its political allies. Too long the
workers have tagged along in the wake of the two capitalist
parties. This has disastrously compromised their economic
and political interests. The moment of history has now
struck when the workers of this country, cutting the um-
bilical cord that has bound them to the body of capitalism,
will be born politically as a ‘class. '

The present situation in the labor movement, with the
great bulk of the top union leadership supporting the
Marshall Plan and other warlike policies of the N.A.M.
and the Government, emphasizes the long-felt need to
improve the quality of American trade union leadership.
It is both absurd and dangerous for -the workers to have
at their head men, who, parrot-like, repeat the “free enter-
prise” slogans of the National Association of Manufac-
turers. With world capitalism decaying and collapsing,
and with the workers facing a myriad of complex ques-
tions and struggles, an understanding of Marxism.is neces-
sary in order to give effective leadership to the working
class. Reactionary union leaders are more than ever dem-
onstrating their incompetence at the present time by their
support of the imperialistic Marshall Plan and of President
Truman in the national elections. As yet only a small per-
centage of the unionshave in their leadership men and

22

 

women with a Socialist perspective. There can be no
other result from the misleadership of the present reac-
tionary ofﬁcialdom than eventual disaster.

The complexity of the struggles facing the workersand
the people and the severity of the ﬁght against the
monopolists thereby makes imperative the building of
the Communist Party in this country. One of the most
pronounced features of the world situation is the rapid
growth of the Communist Parties in many countries in
size and mass inﬂuence. They are the forces which, in the

- main, are leading the great democratic. forces in the strug-

gle against warmongering imperialism and fascism all over
the world. Here in the United States, where the workers
have the most powerful of all enemies to ﬁght, namely the
powerful capitalist class, the need for a strong Communist
Party is no less urgent than it is in other countries.

The coming Presidential elections are the most impor-
tant that have been held in our country since the eve of
the outbreak of the Civil War. Furious attacks are now
being made by reactionaries upon‘ the people's living stand-
ards and democratic rights, and a ruthless attempt is being
made by the agents of Wall Street, with their Marshall
Plan, to plunge our country into what would be the most
terrible of all wars. The American masses are full of
anxiety over the situation, and the peoples all over the
world are watching with fear and worry to see whether
the United States, in the coming elections, will turn to-
ward peace or will continue along its present mad course
toward war.‘ The two capitalist parties, backed as they are
by Wall Street, are responsible for the extremely danger-
ous situation that is now confronting our nation and the
world. The best answer to Wall Street would be the defeat
of the Marshall Plan during the coming months and the
development of the third party on a gigantic scale in the
elections. This is what the big monopolists fear most of
all in this fateful year. Now is the time for the workers
and the people to .act.

Street to use them in its program of imperialist expansion
and aggression. They are labor imperialists.

The best way to realize that the Marshall Plan is not a
plan for economic recovery is to examine what has been
the general effect of the other huge sums that the United
States has spent on European “recovery” since the end of
the war. This makes a dismal story. Altogether, since V-E
Day the United States has shipped, as loans, goods worth
over 15 billion dollars into‘Europe, principally Western
Europe. Yet the main countries there, Great Britain.
France and Italy, still ﬁnd themselves in deep crisis and
we are constantly being told that they will collapse alto-
gether 'and be taken over by the Communists if we do
not quickly give them many more billions. Thus, so far
as bringing about economic recovery is concerned, all the

‘billions of American dollars quandered up to now on

Western Europe might just as well have been poured
down a rathole. '
The same can also be said regarding the four billion
dollars that have been loaned since the end of the war
to the rotten Chiang Kai-shek government in China. This
money ‘has been wasted to shoot down the workers and
peasants who are ﬁghting -against one of the most corrupt
systems in the world. And in the future, it is proposed to

expend more billions in this most discreditable enterprise,

which violates all the democratic traditions of America.

_ That the “rehabilitation” policies the United States is
following are not bringing about economic recovery in
Europe (or anywhere else) is emphasized by the fact that
while the much-helped countries of Western Europe are
in deep crisis the countries of Eastern and Central Europe
are making constant and rapid recovery to economic
health. This contrast is all the more striking inasmuch as
the U.S.S.R., Poland, and Yugoslavia, for example, suf-
fered incomparably greater losses in lives and property
during the war (proportionally 10 to 20 times as much)
than did Great Britain, France, or Italy, and they have

3

 
  

received little American postwar aid; yet they are rapidly
traveling the highway to recovery, while the countries of
the West are sick and getting sicker.

The explanation for this contradictory situation is that
the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, the new
democracies, including Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugo-

slavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Albania, have

adopted the necessary progressive economic and political
measures required to bring about industrial recovery,
while those in the West have not. Thus, the people in
Eastern Europe have smashed the power of monopoly
capital, nationalized the banks and key industries, broken
up the big landed estates, set up democratic governments,
and have generally proceeded forthrightly to put their
economic systems in order. (The Soviet Union, of course,

has long had Socialism, which has advanced economic and

political measures even more thoroughly in elfect.) But
Britain, France, Italy, and other lands in the VV est, on the
other hand, have not adopted those necessary recovery
measures, even though the ﬁrst-named country has a so-
called Labor government. This lack of progress is due to
the fact that in all the West European countries "the mon-
opolists remain in full "control; they continue todominate
the governments; they have blocked and crippled the peo-
ple’s nationalization programs, and they have successfully
sabotaged all effective ﬁnancial and economic proposals.

If the reactionaries have thus been able to defeat need-
ful economic and political reforms in Western Europe
and thereby have prevented economic recovery, it has been
primarily because they have had the assistance of the
United States. American loans have been made to these
governments on the condition that they would not adopt
measures similar to those that have brought about eco-
nomic recovery in Eastern and Central Europe. Actually,
therefore, the 15 billions in loans by the United States in
Western Europe have hindered, not helped, economic
recovery. And the 17 billion dollars of the Marshall Plan,

4

 

 

as proposed by President Truman, would have a similar
negative effect on the economic rehabilitation of Europe.
Indeed, the announcement of the Marshall Plan has split
Europe into two hostile camps and has generally worsened
the economic and political situation in the world.

THE MARSHALL PLAN A WAR PLAN

The Marshall Plan is the master scheme of ‘American
imperialism for expansion and war. The men of Wall
Street, who control the Truman Administration, both
major political parties, and the‘biggest industrial system
in the'world, formulated this plan on the cold-blooded as-
sumption that in order to put across their program of
world domination a war with the Soviet Union is inevit-
able. The meaning of the Marshall Plan, therefore, is

precisely to organize fo-r this projected anti-Soviet warzii

to recruit allies among the countries of Western Europe.

A ﬁrst phase of this general war plan, as embodied in
the Marshall Plan, is to try to shore up tottering capitalism
in Western Europe by ﬁnancially strengthening the mo-
nopolists who are now in political and economic command.
This has been the general purpose of the American ﬁnan-
cial loans made in the recent past and also of those that
are being proposed for the future. Thus, according to the

' Marshall Plan as proposed by President Truman to Con-
- gress, Great Britain, during the four. years of the Plan,

would receive the gigantic sum of almost six billion dol-
lars. Most of this economic aid would have the effect of
a subsidy to the capitalists, as it would practically guarantee
their proﬁts and their wealth generally. For, obviously, if
this money were not forthcoming from the United States,

‘the peoples of Great Britain would proceed to raise the

necessary rehabilitation funds by taking them away from

the rich through higher taxes, capital levies, and other

ﬁnancial devices. But with the United States furnishing

billions of_dollars, the rich are spared the demands that
5

  

otherwise would be made upon their wealth by their peo-
ples. Hence, if and when the American people make the
proposed, huge Marshall Plan loans to Great Britain,
France, and Italy and to other monopoly-controlled coun-
tries, they can have the pleasure (sic) of realizing that they
are protecting the ill-gotten proﬁts of the capitalists of
these countries and are subsidizing reactionary allies of
Wall Street for its war program.

Especially, the Marshall Plan aims at re-establishing
full American imperialist control over Germany. Its aims
in that country are to block all efforts at nationalization
of the banks and industries, to give the American trusts
direct ownership and control of large segments of German
industry, to assure the Hitlerite industrialists formal eco-
nomic and political command, to unite the American,
British, and French sectors of Germany under American
domination, and generally to make Germany into a reac-
tionary puppet of Wall Street, armed against the U.S.S.R.

A second basic war aspect of the Marshall Plan is to
weaken the national independence of the countries re-
ceiving the loans and -thus to make them.into obedient
tools of Wall Street. This is the general purpose and effect
of the harsh economic and political conditions which are
either written into the terms of the loans or are, by back-
door diplomacy, implied beforehand as stipulations for
receiving the loans. These conditions would be even worse
if it were not for the strong criticism’ now being made of
them by the Communists and other democratic forces in
Europe. For example, the recent four billion dollar loan
to Great Britain contained very severe economic condi-
tions for that country, which deﬁnitely infringed upon its
world economic position; And the proposed Marshall Plan
loans will embody even stiffer terms, either directly or
indirectly. In consequence of this American pressure,
Great Britain is becoming more and more dependent
economically upon the United States. Actually, the ques-
tion of the maintenance of the independence of that once

proud empire from the United States has now become a
serious political issue in Great Britain. '

So far as the governments of France and Italy are con-
cerned, they have been reduced to little more than pup-
pets of Wall Street. When American agents can demand,
and have their demand granted, that the Communist
Parties, the strongest political organizations in these two
countries, be expelled from the Government Cabinets,
obviously very little national independence is left to the
respective governments. The fact is that various American
State Department agents are now insolently bossing these
governments about, not to mention the dictatorial attitude
they assume toward the smaller countries of Western
Europe; The general aim of all this domination, besides
strengthening the economic grip of American trusts in
Europe, is to reduce the various countries to puppet allies
in the anti-Soviet war front now being prepared.

A third major war purpose of the Marshall Plan is to
create a politically reactionary Europe. Such a Europe is
necessary if its peoples are to be catapulted into war at
the behest of Wall Street. Under the Hitlerite slogan of
saving the world from Communism, the agents of the State
Department all over Europe are ﬁghting against every-
thing progressive and are making war against Socialism.
They are backing the most reactionary elements in the
British Labor Government, while at the.same time they
are plotting for Churchill's return to power. In France,
whilehsupporting the right Social-Democrats against the

Left, they are building up the dangerous fascist, General.

de Gaulle. In Italy, they are the main sponsors and backers
of every reactionary, fascist current ,in the national po-
litical "life. They are also upholding Franco in Spain, and
they are the mainstay of the near-fascist governments in
Greece and Turkey. Everywhere State Department agents
are violent enemies of the nationalization of industry, of
planned economy, and of popular democratic government.
Every monopolist, banker and industrialist, every land-

7

 

  

 

holder, fascist, right Social—Democrat, and reactionary
clerical throughout Europe is welcomed by our State
Department as its friend and ally. Consequent upon all
this_reaction and corruption, there is a menacing revival
of the sinister danger of fascism throughout Europe.

One of the principal aims of this general plan of weak-
ening democracy and cultivating reaction in Europe is to
split the trade unions, to prevent Communist-Socialist
co-operation, and to isolate and destroy the Communist
Parties. In these labor—splitting drives American imperial-
ism has the active support of the top leaders of the A. F. of
L. and the C.I.O., as adherents of'the Marshall Plan.
During the recent general strikes in France and Italy (in
which several million half—starved workers struck for wage
increases), American labor leaders, under the pretext of
supporting the Marshall Plan, urged thse workers not to
obey the strike calls of their unions. In France, they actu-
ally conspired with capitalist reactionaries in splitting the
labor movement after the general strike. Moreover, they
actively supported the reactionary French and Greek gov-
ernments, which adopted anti-strike legislation during the
strikes far worse than the.Taft-Hartley law in this country.
Such actions by these labor leaders were just plain strike-
breaking, and it forever cast infamy upon the names of
men like James B. Carey of the C.I.O. and Matthew Woll
of the A. F. of L. On the same disgraceful level of labor
betrayal is the present attempt of the A._ F. of L. to split
the Latin American Confederation of Labor and to throw
the peoples of Central and South America under the
ruthless domination of Wall Street. And now these reac-
tionary labor leaders, playing Wall Street’s game and act-
ing as State Department agents, are trying to split the
W.F.T.U. over the Marshall Plan.

A fourth war preparation aim of the Marshall Plan
is to revive militarism in anticipation of a general" war
against the U.S.S.R. In many countries—Great Britain,
8

 

France, Italy, Turkey, etc.—Marshall Plan funds will be
used, as past American funds have been used, to recon-
struct the armies of these countries under reactionary
command. Great Britain, for example, since the end of
the war has squandered billions of dollars needlessly on
imperialistic adventures in various parts of the world, and
a great deal of this money came from the pockets of the
American people. With the intensiﬁcation of the drive of
the United States toward war we can be sure, therefore,
that a large percentage of the proposed loans would go for
military purposes. The aim is especially to build Germany
up into’ a great arsenal to produce munitions to be used
against the U.S.S.R.

The American reactionaries do not stop merely at re-
cultivating militarism in Europe, nor at establishing Amer-
ican militarybasevs all over the world, and carrying on
threatening naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean and
elsewhere. In various countries they are also plotting or
actually carrying on armed revolts against the democratic
peoples’ governments. This is the case in Poland, Bulgaria,
and Yugoslavia, and it is notoriously the case in Greece.

In the latter country we have the infamous Truman
Doctrine in operation. The Marshall Plan is the Truman
Doctrine implemented with huge funds and grandiose
pretenses at economic recovery. In Western Euro-pe, no»-
tably France and Italy, the Marshall Plan's tendency is to
develop civil war situations, even as in Greece. It is non-
sense to argue, as some “liberals” do, that the Marshall
Plan is different from the Truman Doctrine: that it is a
plan for peaceful reconstruction. Many of the militarists
whom the Wall Street reactionaries are backing in various
countries, especially such ﬁgures as General de Gaulle in
France, are not only fomenting civil wars, but they are also
inciting a general war against the U.S.S.R. _

Fifthly, the Marshall Plan has the war aim of mobilizing
