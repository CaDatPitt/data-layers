ARTICLE III, Sections I and
2 outlines the structure and
pﬂ_e_r of the Federal Court
System whose judges help
protect rights of citizens.

Section 2 guarantees that
all federal crimes, except
impeachment, shall be by
jury -- and in the State
where crime was committed.

E)‘CEPTlON’- Supreme Court
has ruled that exceptions are
“trials for petty offenses”,
certain criminal contempts,
court-martial or other military
tribunal, and some cases
where defendant has volun-
tarily relinquished his rights.
