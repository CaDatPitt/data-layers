PREAMBLE ,

The Communist Political Associ-
ation is a non-party organization of
Americans which, basing itself upon
the iworking class, carries forward
the traditions of Washington, Ieffer-
son, Paine, Iackson and Lincoln,
under the changed conditions of
modern industrial society.

It seeks eﬁective application of
democratic principles to the solu-
tion of the problems of today, as
an advanced sector of the demo-
cratic majority of the American

ople. i

It upholds the Declaration of In-
dependence, the United States Con-

‘ stitution and its Bill of Rights, and

the achievements of American de-
-.v 3

mocracy against all the enemies of

‘popular liberties.
It is shaped by the needs of the

nation at war, being formed in the
midst of the greatest struggle of all
history; it recognizes that victory
for the free peoples over fascism
will open up new and more favor-

able conditions for progress; it looks

to the family of free nations, led by
the great coalition of democratic
capitalist and socialist states, to in—
augurate an era of world peace,
expanding. production and economic
well-being, and the liberation and

equality of all peoples regardless of

race, creed or color.

It adheres to the principles of
scientiﬁc socialism, .Marxism,. the
heritage of the best thought of
humanity. and of a hundred years’
experience of the labor movement,
principles which have proved to be
indispensable to the national exis-

tence and independence of every
nation; it looks forward to a future
in which, by democratic choice of
the American .people, our own
country will solve the problems
arising out of the contradiction be-
tween the social character of pro-
duction and its private/ownership,
incorporating the lessons of the most
fruitful achievements of all man-
kind in a form and manner con-
sistent with American traditions and
character. ’

aims, the Communist Political Asso-
ciation establishes the basic laws of
