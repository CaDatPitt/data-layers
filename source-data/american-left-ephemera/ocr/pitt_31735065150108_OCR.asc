Musce in Key States  

I July. "I960

DENVER——Evidence of Mine-Mill political muscle was in the western election
news headlines last month. Union—backed primary candidates scored heavily in Mon-
tana on June 7. Practical measures to assure a similar success on the state and coun-
ty level was being put into operation for the primary still to come in Arizona on Sep-

‘ tember 13.

All three candidates
unanimously endorsed by
the state-wide Montana Mine-
M i l 1 Legislative committee
left a multitude of opponents
behind in their races to gain
hotly contested Democratic
nominations for national and
state office.

Cong. Lee Metcalf was an
11,000-vote margin victor over
his closest opponent, former
Gov. John W. "Bonner, in the

top four-way race for the U. S.
Senate seat left vacant by the
withdrawal of veteran Senator
James E. Murray. Murray, in
announcing his retirement, op-
posed Metcalf by publicly en-
dorsing Bonner. A

Metcalf also had to over-
come the vote-getting strength

of Cong. LeRoy Anderson, .

who gave up his seat to run,
and former Veterans of For-

Anaconda Unfair Acts   
Cited by Labor Board

BUTTE, Mont.——Unfair labor practice charges filed-

by

Mine-Mill against the Anaconda Copper corporation

have been upheld by the National Labor Relations Board,
President John Clark disclosed here last month.
The charges arose during the copper strike last win-

ter when the leadership of

-Local 117 in Anaconda

broke with the Montana Joint
Negotiating committee and
signed an illegal agreement
with the company.‘

A complaint sustaining the.

charges A was issued by the
NLRB 19th Regional office
June 2 after investigation
showed‘ a prima. facie case of
illegal acts by the company.

It cited a Whole series of Na-
Relations act
violations in the company's
dealings‘ with Local 117 to
sign a separate agreement.
Also listed in the complaint
were additional unlawful ac-
tivities in the ‘company's un-
successful’ attempt to "make
the same substandard deal
with Local 16 in Great Falls.

FORMAL HEARINGS on its

complaint of unfair labor prac-

tices against the company were i

set by the Board for July. 12
in‘ Anaconda.

The history of the charges
goes back to the beginning of

l ' r

the strike when the -company
with the help of Local 117

-leaders launched an all-out

campaign to break up the
Montana Joint committee and
put over a cheap settlement;

ing a separate local agreement
far inferior to the Interna-

Uniorpbusters Behind 

Kellogg Strike Smear

HE ATTACK against the International Union and its . '

leadership in Kellogg, Idaho, is another sample as
to how far a behind-the-scenes move can go to break
strikes and support the metal companies in their desire
to break up a union.

The strike in the Coeur d’Alenes was
called by the, miners and smeltermen of
Local 18 in a. secret ballot vote. After nearly
a. year’s negotiations during which the oper-
ators were allowed to run, and after a
pattern had been set by the other oper-
ators, the workers in the Coeur d’Alenes
were finally fed up with the continued re-
fusals of the companies to meet the pattern
which their fellow workers, working on the
same kind of jobs,’ha.d accepted in all other
basic sections of the industry.

It was not hard to understand the de-
generate move of the Steelworkers leader-
ship in their attempt to divide the Metaline-
Bunker Hill workers from their brothers in
Kellogg and Wallace, but it is hard to understand the motives
which are being raised in the division of families, businessmen,
and workers presumably started under the guise of an “I am
an American” youth movement. The one motive that is clear
is that it is strike breaking without any frills or flounces.

at**'

0 MY knowledge, this sorry spectacle is the first time that

a major mining company has moved to recruit school chil-
dren in an obvious attempt to break a legal strike.

What a variance there is in this supposed youth movement
with the ones that are spreading throughout many countries in
the world toda.y——Tu1-key, Korea, England, Africa, and other
nations, even in our own country in the deep South and its
support in many states!

These movements are basic, against dictatorships, against
segregation, against the persistent and ever-growing risk of
nuclear War with its total. destruction, and in support of world

peace.
‘A’ ‘k ‘k

T HE spurious cry in Kellogg is the age-Worn tattered cry of‘

 

Clark

 

July. 196?’. pp 

Communism, the last resort of those who refuse to discuss ' I

the issues or the real demands of their neighbors and workers
in their own community.

This is a democracy. Under its functions, citizens who feel
they are persecuted or wrongfully-charged have the legal right
to carry their case to the highest court. Until that court's
decision is given on the question of innocence or guilt the
charges. should not be the basis of castigation or mob spirit
against them. ‘

Anyway, the question of the charges is not communism, but ‘

conspiracy; a charge that has been the nemesis of the labor
movement for nearly a hundred years. That is why this case
against Skinner, Powers and the other defendants is getting»
support from most of the leaders of labor unions, AFL-CIO and
what have you. ‘

‘k*'k

N FOUR more cases conspiracy has been charged——Textile
Workers in North Carolina, International Ladies Garment
Workers in New York, former officials of United Electrical

Workers in Cleveland, and against some of the Brotherhood of '

Teamsters in St. Louis. ,

The late Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote
in an opinion in 1949: “The Conspiracy Law is elastic, sprawling
and pervasive. . . . As a practical matter, the accused often is
confronted with a hodgepodge of acts and statements by others
which he may never have authorized or intended or even known
about, but which help to persuade the jury of the existence of
conspiracy itself. In other words, a conspiracy is often proved
by evidence that is admissable only upon the assumption that
the conspiracy existed.”

There in many instances was nothing truer than this deduc-
tion in the trial of the defendants of the International Union in

our case. p
‘A’ ‘Jr ‘Ir

UR country is dedicated on the_ right of ‘free speech, the =
right to one’s opinion, and the right of redress of persecu-
tion if that is the feeling of a citizen being charged with any
infraction of the statutes. It is democracy to uphold those
rights. This means the support of innocence until the final.
proof of guilt. _

Mob rule, mob spirit and the prejudgement’ of workers on
the rightful issues of the controversy in the Coeur d’Alenes is
preaching and supporting the very theory of the accusations
being raised, communism and dictatorship.

‘k‘k*

HE Executive Board of this International Union issued’ the

following statement. at a Board meeting in September of
1955:

_“We unqualifiedly and loyally support our American form

‘ of government and reaffirm our faith and belief in our demo-

cratic institutions.
“We do not believe nor do we advocate that Communism
is the solution to the problems of the American people.

“Our record over the‘years demonstrates that Mine-Mill has
brought home the bacon to its membership in the traditional
American trade union sense. For 63 years the Internatioiial
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers has upheld, defended
and contributed to the finest traditions of American trade
unionism. We will continue to do so.” ‘ ‘

There has been no diverting; from that statement and we
continue to abide ‘by it.—J.0HN CLARK. 8' A

HAYDEN, Ariz. — Another
Steelworkers raid attempt on

Mine-Mill bit the dust here last
month.

Their petition at the new
crushing operations of the
Kennecott mill in Hayden was
dismissed by the NLRB.

It was the latest example of
Steel's trying to chip off any

by filing petitions whether
they make sense or not.

The new Hayden crusher is
part of the Kennecott mill
operations under contract with
Mine-Mill. Members of Mine-
Mill were transferred from
the old crushing operations in
Ray, Ariz., and from the mill
into the new crusher.

‘ Despite the fact that this
new crusher was already un-

 part of the milling operations,

the Steel disrupters apparently
saw a. new building and filed
their raid petition.

THE MINE-_Ml_I.L. UNION

Vice-President:

 Automation——an Issue

That Must Be Solved

N THE LAST few years we have been hearing a lot
about ‘fautomation” in the industrial plants of North
America. ‘To most people “automation” means the re-
placement of men by ma'chinery—the elimination of many

individual hand operations and the substitution of multi-.
T ple machine operations. 

It means more production with less
men. It. means lower production costs and
higher._profits. If the benefits were properly
distributed among employees, the companies
and the public, automation would be a boon
to mankind. 0

‘Unfortunately the distribution of the

company wants to discuss. Such sugges
tions, they say, are a threat to “free enter-
pr .” If a union argues that automation
should result in ‘higher wages, a shorter
work week for employees and lower. prices

Skinner
to the consumer—that, Brother is “socialism!” .

Automationby itself is only part of the problem. VVliat.:is

really happening in American industry is a management and ‘

production revolution. Every major American corporation is
now engaged in or plannnig revolutionary changes in methods
and production. They call it “cutting costs of production” or
putting; the operations on a‘ “competitive basis” or “increasing

UNDREDS of bigcorporationslare employing thousands of

. time‘_st.u'dy' engineers,T Iso-called “system engineers,” ‘V‘brain
trusters” and “brain washers” to accomplish onemajor goal-—
more jprodllction with less. men. ‘ _ '-

It is not necessarily “automation” when a company replaces
20-ton ore trucks with 60-ton ore trucks, but this eliminates two

' trucks and two truck drivers. .

It . is not necessarily ‘-‘automa-tion” when ore cars are in-
creased, from. 40,-ton -to»80. or 100-ton capacity, but i.t eliminates
many train crews. It -is not necessarily “automation” Vwhen -a
new skip or‘ moving belt is: installed, but this new method of
moving ore eliminates both truck drivers and train crews.

Nor is it necessarily’*‘automation” when a company is able
to convince two employees to perform work previously done by
three employees, but this also eliminates jobs. ’

“kirk

N A THOUSAND devious ways this management revolution
is going on all over America in mines, mills, factories, of-
fices and fabricating plants. The toll of lost jobs-V-jobs that are

permanently lost——is Tmountirig rapidly. In the course of the
" next several years some 8 million to 10 million jobs will be lost

forever.
Here are a few examples of what has .happened in the last
few years: ' t T “
250,000 less production employees in the Auto imlustry
200,000 fewer employees in the Steel industry .
40,000 jobs eliminated in meat packing industry
20,000 to 30,000 fewer employees in metal mining industry.
Production per employee hasgone up rapidly in all these i.mlns-
tries. _
What is needed is a major effort by every trade union in
North America to tackle this problem. Too many trade union

leaders are sitting around scheming how to make up their own —

membership losses by raiding some other union. This, of course,
is insane. '

its

VERY UNION should be doing seine very serious thinking
about how to" solve this most important threat to the jobs
and security of'American workers.

No union can expect to prevent automation or improved
methods of production, but if such changes are going to result
in 10 million unemployed people then the unions, business and
government better start doing something about this problem.

It cannot be called “progress” if the only result of this in-
dustrial revolution is increased profit and increased’ unemploy-

ment. We must measure progress in terms of how people live, V

of their economic security, of their ability to provide a good
education to their children'——of the degree to Which produc-
tive work contribu_tes,to"a happy and productive life. ' '
 * at *
NY MANGEMENT or engineering concept that assumes
the sole purpose of improved production methods at a
higher profit is not only inhumane——it is self-defeating. Where
are we going to sell this increased production?
It’s long past the time when the trade unions must project
a solution to this problem. No one union can solve it by itself.
Our union will certainly spend considerable time on this subject
in the coming International Convention in Denver.
We shall certain.ly discuss ways and means to distribute
the benefits of increased production among employees and the

consuming public.

12*;

NDER THIS discussion will be such subjectsas earlier re-
‘ tirement on full pension, shorter work week at full pay,
adequate severance pay and extended ‘unemployment benefits,

training for new jobs in expanding industries, anewfair labor’

standards law in United States, etc. T .
V 0- Some of the possible solutions we discuss may sound

revolutionary, but it is the corporations that started this in- v
dustrial revolution, not us. It can’t be solved by sweeping it V
"‘-Tunder-the rug. - - I -

Rush for Early Adjournment

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.——'I‘he 86th Congress, its remaining life numbered in days,
was concentrating at month’s end on home-stretch activity on social security, mini-
mum wage, aid-for-education, government pay raises, housing, and mutual security. -

_ These were the main items of national interest listed by the leadership as the
business to be cleaned up before lawmakers scurry from Washington for the election

wars. _

No ex act adjournment
(late was announcecl, but the
opening of the Democratic
Convention. July 11 more or
less fixes‘ a deadline. Somrces
close to the lca.dersl.iip say the
windup may come _by July 4-.

Such a target date, when
viewed against the legislative
work to be covered, might be
regarded as out of the ques-
tion. The leadcrship, however,
appears -confident l.awmakei‘s

can leave the Ca._r>u.ol before‘

July ll for two main reasons.
:3 =3:  ‘

ONE is that most of the
“must” bills have been shaped
into acceptable compromises
and now are virtually ready
for final. action. Another is that
this Congress, despite its in-
flux of liberals from the 1958
elections, has demonstrated it
has no stomach for any major
floor battles.

In only a single legislative

area—medical. care—is Tat genu- ,

ine hot fight aiiticipated. _0n

izing for an effort to amend

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  

July. .19.»

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WINNIPEG, Manitoba—The Canadian Manitoba Labor Board June 17 officially
announced certification of Mine-Mill as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the
workers at International Nickel Company’s huge new mining property at Thompson

Lake.

IN CO’s Thompson nickel project includes the three-phase process of mining, smelt-

ing and refining. In full op-
eration within the next
couple of years it will employ
more than 2,000 workers in
the mines and surface plants.

The union’s newly chartered
local -— Local 1026 of the
Thompson & District -Mine,
Mill, Smelter and Refinery
Workers Union—applied for
certification May 10 after all
eligible Thompson worker s
were signed up as dues-paying
members of Mine-Mill.

Official certification was de-
layed slightly by a Manitoba
Labor Board hearing made
necessary when interventions
were entered by the Steelwork-
ers, Carpenters and Operating
Engineers unions.

it all Ilt

MINE-MILL, in its initial
presentation to the Board,
established th at t the over-
whelming preponderance of
International Nickel company
employees were members of
the Mine-Mill local.

Since the intervening unions
had claimed that the unit ap-
plied for was not an 0 ap-
propriate unit, Mr. Joseph
Zuken, acting for Mine-Mill,
conclusively established that
the employer unit applied for
followed very closely the pat-
tern that has been established
throughout the Canadian min-
ing industry.

In a shameful display of

trade union irresponsibility,
the Steelworkers and other in-
tervenors, none of whom had
applied for certification them-
selves, tried to persuade the
Board that because there was
not a full complement of per-
sonnel at the Thompson prop-
erty at present, a certification
should not be issued to Mine-
Mill.
Ik Ii! ill

IT WAS pointed out that the
employers had repeatedly used
this argument in efforts to
block bargaining rights for
their employees and as a mat-
ter of fact the Steelworkers’
lawyer used company argu-
ments previously tendered to
support his case.

A witness presented by the
Steelworkers in an effort to
show they had some support
among Thompson workers ad-
mitted they did not have a
single member at the -time
Mine-Mill applied for certifica-
tion.
the hearing were eight cards
signed two weeks later.

The witness also admitted
that this miserable show of
Steel “support” was the com-
plete result of the efforts by
the Steelworkers who have
had a number of organizers at

Thompson for the past two.

Howard Fights Vote Denia    it
By County Registrar Board   "

BESSEMER, Ala.——Mine-Mill Vice-President Asbury Howard May 31 was denied-
the right to vote in Alabama's run-off primary involving federal electors. It was one of

the state’s first acts to by-pass the_1960 Federal Civil Rights law. , ' 
An appeal is being made to the Federal, District court in Birmingham on the
g because of race and violation of his constitution-,.ii

grounds of his exclusion from votin

al rights.

Howard has been regis-
tered and voting in Jefferson
county for more than .12 years.
He is President of the Bes-
semer Voters League, a civic
organization devoted to en-
couragement of Negroes to
register and vote. The League
and other community organiza-
tions immediately went on rec-

. ord supporting his fight for

reinstatement to the voting
list.

The’ Mine-Mill officer was
summoned before the Jeffer-
son county Board of Registrars
on May 23 on the fantastic
charge of “vagrancy” and
asked to show cause why he
should not -be stricken from

i the voting list. He denied the

charge, showing evidence of
his gainful employment.

HIS ATTORNEY, David? H.

-Hood, Jr; —-of Bessemer, ‘also.
‘ challenged 'the=B‘aard's:-_author- __

ity in calling Howard only
eight days before an election
when at least 30 days is re-
quired for such a procedure.

Nevertheless, when he ap-
peared at the polls on May 31
he was denied the vote even
though at the time of the hear-
ing a week earlier the ‘Board
of Registrars had given no
ruling as to his right to vote
and an appeal was still pend-
ing before the Board as to the
hearing itself.

As the Mine-Mill Union went
to press, Howard had again
been summoned to appear be-
fore the Board of Registrars
on June 21.

Chile Anaconda Strike Settled

Nearly 5,000 production workers and office employees re-
turned to work late in May after a 31/2_ week strike at the
Anaconda Company’s El Salvador mine and Potrerillos smelter
in Chile. The strike ended suddenly one compromise settlement

 
 

between A the union’s demands and the company’s initial offer.

The new contract, running for

15 months, provides a 51%

increase in wages, and a cost
of living escalator.‘

A nationwide copper strike
in sympathy for the El Salva-
dor and’ Potrerillos workers
had‘ been scheduled but was
called off May_23 because of
the disastrous earthquake in
southern Chile which caused
an estimated $300 million in
property damage and 5,000
deaths. No copper mines were
affected by the quake.

Congo Freedom
The vast Congo, one third

the size of the United States,

and richest minerals store-
house in Africa, achieved inde-
pendence at the end of June.

Under Belgian rule for over
75 years, control of the Congo
passes to 13 million natives
after riots last year forced a
speedup in the Belgian gov-
ernment’s leisurely program
for transition to Congo self-
government. Repressive and

paternalistic Belgian colonial,

policies have left the Congo
ill-prepared to assume the
tasks of self-government.

Fewer than 20 Congolese
possess a college education;
none is trained as an engineer,
lawyer or doctor. Few have
attended high school; all but
a handful of Congolese cannot
read or write. “Higher” edu-
cation for Congo natives was
forbidden until recent. years.
Less than a dozen Congolese
are employed in the upper
ranks. of the civil service,
which has been run by 10,000
Belgians. When Ghana, with
one-third the population, be-
came independent, it had 1,500
British trained native workers
in top government jobs.

It! is tlt

ANOTHER problem in the
Congo is politics. There are
over 200 tribes, many of which.
call themselves political par-
ties. Of 113 parties on the bal-
lot: in recent pre-independence
elections, over 20 won repre-
sentation in the parliament.
The largest party won only 421
out of 137 seats. As this is
written, attempts are still be-
ing made. to form coalitions

which could control the legis-'

lature.
[These growing pains have
led to much uncertainty as to

the treatment to be accorded

  

by the new government to the
Congo’s rich mineral enter-
prises—-‘including copper, zinc,
tin, manganese, gold, uranium
and other wealth.

Uncertainty extends to labor
relations, taxation status, the
policy of the new government
on state control of mining,
even whether a single central
government will remain or be
replaced by several smaller

states. To these uncertainties-

some observers add the pos-
sibility that natives in neigh-
boring copper-rich Rhodesia
may want to follow the exam-
ple of their brothers in the
Congo.

Events in the Congo and in
Rhodesia will be followed
closely by world copper trad-
ers. Uncertainties there are
said by market analysts to
have firmed up the price of
copper in recent weeks.

lCFTU Boycott Call

Int’l Confederation of Free
Trade U n i o n s with which
AFL-CIO is affiliated, has
called. for a worldwide consu-
mer boycott of South African
goods in protest against the
denial of political and trade
union rights to the colored
people of South -Africa. The
Confederations appeal says in
part:

“Trade unionists every-
where, strike your blow for
freedom in South,Africa now
. . . Take the lead in a. mighty
international in ovem en t. of
protest against the brutal op-
pression of the great majority
of South Africans by a. hand-

BRIDGEPORT BRASS, PHELPS DODGE and LEWIN-
MATHES, faces red, made a hasty turnabout on prices last
month. Early in May, Bridgeport Brass announced it would
cease granting discounts on quantity purchases of copper tubing
and wire. The other two companies followed suit. Just how
this was calculated to stimulate sales of brass and wire mill
products isn’t clear.

Evidently other companies saw it differently. Calumet and
Hecla announced late in May that the 5 per cent discount long
applicable throughout the industry to purchases of 10,000 feet
or pounds of tubing would be applied to all purchases over
2,000 pounds. Revere Copper and Brass announced it would
grant the same discount, plus an additional 3' per cent on orders
over 10,000 feet or pounds.

Bridgeport Brass, Phelps Dodge and Lewin-Mathes pulled
in their horns, abandoning plans to eliminate discounts.

COPPER AND BRASS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION says
the U. S. brass mill industry has capacity to produce one million
tons more per year than customers have been buying. Despite
this excess capacity, brass mills are installing millions of dollars
worth of new labor-saving, cost-cutting machinery. American
Metal Market recently printed a half page of pictures of some
of this modern equipment installed by American Brass.

New equipment shown included wire tinning winders at
Ansonia requiring three operators where nine worked before,
14-foot wide rolls at Detroit, a 2,300-ton extrusion press and
billet heating furnace at Waterbury, and a new roller hearth
furnace at Buffalo Tube Mill. These are some of the machines
that have caused productivity of labor in the brass mills to
increase even more sharply in recent years than in the steel
industry.

American Brass officials said early in J uneithat $15 million
had been spent over the last ten years modernizing the Buffalo
brass plant. The program has helped the company cut costs,
the officials say. Capacity of the plant has been expanded, but

even before the current slump in brass, less than two-thirds as .
many workers were employed as held jobs at Buffalo brass _

in 1950.
at ’ * ‘k
BRASS MILL business will pick up in August after _vaca-
tions are over. This is the talk among brass mill executives
as reported in trade and financial papers. We hope they are
right. Orders received by the brass mills since last December
1 have been the lowest for any period of comparable length in
over ten years. Some improvement in hours and number of
men working at brass nulls has been reported in recent weeks,
but full recovery is still in the future.

After being stalled in the House Ways and Means Com-

the bill had less than four weeks to clear both House and Senate

15-cent package over the next

"three years and no retroac-

tivity.
As important, or even more

. so, in the deadlocked negotia-

violations of seniority, job
bidding, scheduling,

THESE were the -issues in
some 200 unsolved ‘grievances
pending before the companies
for settlement in the negotia-
tions. Those plus the money
and fringe package are what's
at stake in this strike.

The strike continues solid
on all fronts with committees

A functioning smoothly on pick-

et duty, registration, strike

publicity, entertainment, wood

other activities.

placed on the ballot as the
only candidate, and before

IN STATE-WIDE political
activity, a 12-man Mine-Mill
committee of staff and local
leaders headed by Regional Di-
rector Jack Marcotti made a

strong bid to persuade former.

U. S. Congressman Richard
Harless of Arizona to run for
Governor.

The committee which met
with Harless at his home in

' Phoenix on June 3 included:

Castulo Sanchez and C.
Gutierrez (Local 470), Sylvain
Schnaittacher and Bobby Gon-
zales (551), A. V. Chaidez

(586),. Henry Marquez (616),.

James Hanley and Tina Torres
(886), Rudy Garcia and Tony
Tameron (938), Int’l Rep. J.
B. Chavez and Marcotti.

Very friendly and deeply_

impressed, Harless said he
was thankful for the union’s
interest in his becoming a
candidate. Because of the
lateness of the campaign, the
fact that one Democratic candi-
date was already announced
and the somewhat clouded pic-
ture in the race, however, he
said he was doubtful, but
would think it over and let the
committee know his decision.

' ON JUNE 10 Harless wired
Marcotti from Washington
stating " that, due to the po-
litical situation around the
Arizona governor’s race this

year, he was declining to‘ run.‘1%§*:'

RECENTLY the 117 leaders
went so far as to publicly de-
clare support for a so-called
“anti-communist” group organ-
ized ‘in the Coeur d'Alenes
since the strike began against
Bunker Hill and AS&R. Its ob-
vious purpose is to smear the
-strike and discredit Mine-Mill.

President Clark," in a press
statement released here, ex-
plained that _ the charges
against the Anaconda company
were filed “to protect the col-
lective bargaining interests of
the miners and smeltermen.”

He said that recent compli-
ments to Local 117 officers by
Anaconda company officials
and statements ‘issued by lead-
ers of that local indicate they
“are not serving the best inter-
ests of the Anaconda smelter-
men and are determined to con-
tinue aiding the employers in
the mining and smelting in-
dustry wherever the workers
are collectively attempting to
improve their wages and work-
ing conditions.”

AS TO LOCAL 117 officers‘
threats of carrying on further
union - splitting action, Clark
said the International doesn't
believe the local membership
is fully aware of the issues "be-
ing raised by its leaders. Every
effort will be made, he said, “to
dispel the fog that is being de-
veloped by these leaders.”

At the same time, he blasted
the Local 117 officers’ support
of the red-smear attack against
