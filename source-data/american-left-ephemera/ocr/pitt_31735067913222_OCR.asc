.,,Mine-Mill, Steelworkers Sign Mutual Aid
  Pact While Merger Talks in Progress

Document Pledges Close Cooperation
In Bargaining and Legislative Activity

DENVER, Colo.-——Agre~eing that substantial progress already has been made in
discussions looking towards merger of Mine-Mill and the United Steelworkers of
America, the three top officers of each of the unions_ on Aug. 26 signed a mutual
assistance pact pledging cooperation between the two labor organizations while the
merger talks continue. _

The agreement, signed at the Denver Hilton, where Mine-Mill last month he]
executive board and national staff meetings, states that each union will “respect the
existing bargaining certifications and contractual relationships of the other in the
non-ferrous metals and other industries in the United States.” Additionally, the docu- '
ment pledges the two organizations to “c0ntinue_their efforts, together with all other
unions in the industry, to develop a common program for the achievement of effec-
tive collective bargaining with the employers” and to “cooperate closely in . . . efforts

to seek improved state and fed-
eral labor and social legislation
for the benefit of all working
people and their families in the
United States.”
Top Officers Sign

Signing the document were,
for Mine-Mill, President A. C.
Skinner, Vice-President Asbury
Howard, and Secretary-Treas-
urer Irving Dichter; and, for the
Steelworkers, President I. W.
Abel, Vice-President_ Joseph P.
Molony, and Secretary-Treas-

with the best interests of our
members and the other workers
in the industry.” They stated
that merger was contemplated
“at the earliest possible time
consistent with the requirements
of our respective constitutions.”

Mine-Mi1l’s eight-man execu-
tive board (see statement on
page 9) and the Steelworkers’
33-member board previously had
approved the signing of the
agreement.

Concern for
Bargaining Strength ._

The officers of both unions ex-
pressed concern with the frag-
mentation of labor bargaining
strength within the industry.
This jurisdictional division, they
said, has cost the workers in the
industry heavily at the bargain-
ing table. ‘

The present agreement. is a
step towards correcting this situ-
ation, they agreed, pointing out

Minimum Wage am    
lmpirovediin Conference

WASHINGTON, D.C.,—A. Senate-House conference committee
on_ the Federal Minimum Wage Bill, whose report was approved

a by the House on Sept. 7, came up with a version of the measure

that is stronger than either of the two proposals with which it had
to work. The accomplishment came about when the committee in-

the two bills.

lcorporated into its ‘final version the strongest feature of each of

The measure, which will raise the minimum wage to $1.60

near future ‘without difficulty,

and President .Johnson’s signa-
ture to become law.

.In‘te_rms of exp.ansion of cov-
erage, "the conference commit-

‘tee accepted the House pro-

posal, more sweeping than the
Senate’s, while it approved the
Senate timetable for hiking‘ the

the‘Fair Labor Standards Act,

thepresent $1.25 minimum will
be raised to $1.40 on Feb. 1,
1967," increasing to $1.60 one
year later. ‘

Even with the improvements
made in the FLSA, however, it

‘ will be still inadequate. A wage

of $1.60 an hour produces only

._-$3,200 a year, while a family

with three children, according
to the Social Security Admin-
istration, requires. an annual in-
come of $3,685 to begin to pull

" out ofthe poverty lev-el.

. A historic breakthrough,
though, was made in the exten-

‘sion of coverage for the first

time,’ to certain farm workers.

 A" minimum of $1.00 will go '

into effect next February, with

' two-sub_sequent yearly increases

of 15 cents each until-reaching
a guarantee /of $1.30 an hour.
Only “farms - which hire substan-

‘ -ftial numbers of workers will be

covered, "however. This amounts

fto protection for ‘only one-fifth

of the‘;nation’s agricultural la-

. bor. force. ’

Additional‘ 1 ‘coverage, totaling
over 7.5 million workers, also
will beprovided to retail work-

,ers.,' restaurant and "hotel em- -

" The newly covered- workers,

regular work wg:-,1‘: for these
employees will be" reduced to
42 hours on.Feb. 1, 1968; and
to 40 hours on Feb. 1, 1969.

Though still inadequate, the
bill represents a big step toward
labor’s goal of an hourly mini-
mum of $2. For the one in every
five families in this ‘country
living below the poverty level
of subsistence, the passage of
the bill may mean an improve-
ment, but it certainly Should not

Two prominent American labor leaders—Frank Rosenblum, general ,secretary-treasurer of the _,
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of—America, and Patrick E. Gorman, secretary—treasurer of _«the
Amalgamated Meatcutters—are members of _a citizens group that recently published a study on the .
Viet'Nam war which, its members say,~“may shed light on our past failures;-and thus open a ‘new’ 

perspective toward peace.”

In a Citizens White Paper entitled “The Politics of Esca

lation,-” thevlgroupi presented indications’ 

that the United States has repeatedly responded to pressuresfor a peaceful settlement-in Southeast? iv 

Asia by escalation of its mili-
tary efforts. In a letter to Pres-
ident Johnson accompanying a
copy of the study, the group
maintained that this pattern has
weakened the credibility of gov-
ernment officials “who publicly
claim that they are searching

for "a real basis for negotia-.

tions.”

AS&R Council Awaits Company  
Counter-Proposal on Pensions

DENVER, Colo.——Members of
the Mine-Mill AS&R , Council,
representing some 5,000 workers
at a dozen of the company’s
properties around the country,
vowed last month to continue

their’ fight for decent pension 6

plan improvements, if necessary
by waiting until the basic con-

-tract expires on June 30, 1967.
“If the company wants a battle ,

at contract expiration time,” the
council’ said in a leaflet pre-

~ pared for distribution at the

local unions, “the union is pre-
pared for this battle.” ‘

In two bargaining sessions
with the company‘, AS&R. has

made no counter-proposal to the‘
union's demands. Stating their’_

readiness to resume negotia-
tions “whenever the company is

2 prepared to talk ’impro'ved pen-

sions,” council members main-
tain there is no point in con-
tinuing “fruitless negotiations.”

Aﬂtwo-day meeting with

- AS&R--took place at the Diplo- .
’ mat Hotel here onrAug. 16 and_ . — .

The’ u'nion’s pension‘ de-
mands, which were prepared by
the AS&R’ Council ;and approved

   

by the membership at the vari-
ous’ properties, were presented
initially to the company at a
meeting early in June in Los

- Angeles. '

The demands include:

In a separate‘ action late last
month, Walter P. Reuther, pres-
ident of the United Auto Work-‘
ers, publicly stated his opposi-
tion -to a st-atemient on Viet Nam‘
adopted earlier by the executive
council of the AFL-CIO.  M

The statement, which com-
mended President Johnson for
“demonstrating to the world”
that the U.S. is “neither irreso-
lute politically ‘nor weak mili-
tarily,”' was characterized by
Reuther _as “intemperate, hys-
terical, jingoistic, and unworthy
of a policy statementof a free
‘labor movement.” ,

Reuther, who had to leavethe
council meeting before the state-
ment ‘was taken ‘up, earlier had
objected toit in committee. A1-

a though he succeeded ‘there in.

having minor revisions made,
he dropped his arguments, he
explained, -when he recognized

THE MINE-MILL UNION

President’: Column

glabor llnity—A Time for Action!

By A. C. Skinner

HE SIGNING of a mutual assistance pact last month between

, Mine-Mill and Steel is not only historic, but an event that few

. ‘ people thought was possible. Certainly our membership and Steel’s

  membership, despite their common aspirations for unity in the non-

 ferrous metals industry, never believed that such a unity _pact

could be achieved. It has not only been achieved, but the officers

“ ofboth ‘unions have been engaged in serious and principled discus-

 .-:_sions of merger for the past several months. With the signing of

" "5--,'.,t.his pact, while we continue at the conference table, we have jointly

‘j taken 'a‘ big step in the direction of organic unity between the two

'-‘major unions in an industry that has for far too long been torn with
‘i. tdissension, union rivalry. and raids. ‘-

.‘iv2:- - ‘

’ "   , Labor Unity—How?

 7 _HE “CURSE” of the North American labor movement for all of
 “ "its history has been cutthroat competition and division. We need
 foiily an elementary understanding of the history of American unions
. ._ , tocomprehend this simple fact—and to comprehend, too, the fact
 2’ that American corporations have always known how to exploit this
 N ._ division’ and conflict between various unions.

, -.1 ' ’ Our membership’ understood this basic problem and proved
‘. "their understanding in convention after convention by resolutions
«‘ i..,.“o’i"i trade union unity. But, as everyone knows, there’s a long diffi-
 hcult road between unity resolutions a;.;l,

- «genuine, principled unity.

' i" ‘ _For many years now, your elected
 'le_adership'has beenworking on, debating,
»*‘:;~?and sweating out the problem of how to
 -take"“unity resolutions” off the shelf and
' “make them a reality.

_ , -We believe that genuine labor unity
,’ ,tc;1.. ‘cannot be achieved by taking the position

V that “if you agree with me, we can have

unity.” We believe that real unity is not

“achieved by “back-slapping” each other
 or by personal deals to take care of indi-
A’ * viduals or officers. This kind of unity we
' -could have had 20 years ago. We believe
thatvthe only kind of unity that makes
_any sense is the kind that puts the interests and the welfare of the
4 membership ‘ first.

We believe your Executive Board is on the road to achieving
 that brand of unity in our deliberations with the new international

— officers of the United Steelworkers of America.

   

, Skinner

 

 L ’ ' Labor Unity Now!

‘>._,'.- ‘ . S MANY of youknow, wehave been achieving results. slowly
, but consistently, in the field of labor unity for the past several
"years. Let me spell out a few examples:

 :, Federal Mine Safety Act—After 20 years of effort by Mine--'-

 ?~’.Mlll,*, this legislation has passed both the House and Senate. It
‘j ' now’ requires only the signature of the President. There is no
1 .,.question-.-about our union's long and difficult struggle to achieve a
{federal law, But over two years ago, your leadership came to the
, conclusion—tliat a united labor effort would be absolutely necessary
' to pass this legislation. We worked hard for such a united front.

Board Urges Political Action,-..

Talks Bargaining, Backs Pact

DENVER, Colo.——The Mine-Mill international executive board, which last‘ month}-

unanimously approved‘ the signing of a mutual assistance agreement with the United

Steelworkers of America, concentrated attention, too, on political action: for? what ; o g
was termed a “crucial election” this fall and on the 1967 bargaining outlook‘ in th_ej_.-:- 
non-ferrous metals industry. ~ '

The assistance pact and continuation of merger discussions between fthe:-:top”‘4of-‘=

ficers of the two unions, board members agreed, undoubtedly immediately enhance the  
possibilities for labor unity on the political and bargaining. fronts in the coming;
months. This" development, the’ ‘ l ' 

boardstressed at its Aug. 24, -25
and 26 meeting at the Denver
Hilton, magnifies rather than
diminishes the scope of the job
facing Mine-Mill locals in the
immediate future.

Noting that Sen. Barry Gold-
water's crushing defeat in the

-,1964 presidential race “did not

put an end to the right wing_
political threat in the United
States,” the board called on all
of the imi'on’s locals to make
every effort to help ensure the
defeat of anti-union, anti-wel-
fare candidates of the far right
in the Nov. 8 election. In a
lengthy statement it adopted on
1966 political action, the execu-
ti_ve board declared, “The pro-
gressive Congressmen and Sen-
ators who have given us such
beneficial legislation as medi-
care, strcngthened civil rights
laws,_the anti-poverty program,
a federal mine safety law, and
many other important. measures
must be re-electec ."

Full participation by locals in
voter registration drives, infor-
mational campaigns on candi-
dates and issues, and get-out-
the-vote drives on Election Day
was urged by the board, which
also called upon individual
Mine-Mill members to donate
the time and money they can
afford to the candidates they
support. '

Warning to Candidates

The statement, too, warned
candidates that in order to be
elected, they must squarely face
the many subjects legitimately
troubling many Americans —-
“. . increasing profiteering in
the cost of food and other items
. . . continuing racial tensions
within the United States . . . the
continuation of a baffling war
on the other side of the world
that is both taking increasing
numbers of American and Viet-
namese lives and "draining the
financial , if'esources' so urgently
needed - for domestic programs
to cure the many social ills of
our. own country.” ' A ’

Another policy statem ent’

adopted pledged continued sup-:

port to the expanded organiza-.

tional efforts of the newly-cre-
ated United Farm Workers Or‘-
ganizing Committee, formed by
the merger of the National
Farm Workers Association and
the Agricultural Workers Orga-
nizing. Committee of the AFL-
CIO. . - .
The board also congratulated
the International Association, of
Machinists. on the substantial
settlement achieved in its strike
against the major airlines. The
“success in breaking through
the imjust and discriminatory
‘guidelines’ is a contribution to
the welfare of all wage earn-
ers,” the Mine-Mill statement
declared. ' ‘

1967 Bargaining

1 Turning to next year’s nego-
tiations in the non-ferrous met-
als industry, the executive board
discussed the upcoming copper
and brass conference, slated for
Oct. 26, 27 and 28 at the Sher-
man House in Chicago. Set up
under the auspices of the Indus-
trial Union Department of the
AFL-CIO, the parley will b-e ‘at-
tended by Mine-Mill, the Steel-
workers, the International Broth-
erhood of Teamsters, the United
Auto Workers, the Machinists,
the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, and others.

Representatives from all Mine--
Mill locals ‘in the copper and
brass section of the industry
are expected to attend. Letters

concerning the conference were-

mailed to these locals on Sept. 2.

Parley on American
Melal lllimax Set
For End of Month

Representatives from three
Mine-Mill locals will take
part in an IUD-sponsored
meeting on the American
Metal Climax Company,
scheduled for Sept. 29 and 30.
Executive Board Members
Raymond Dennis and Alfred
Petit—Clair also plan to at-
tend the conference.

Unions having contracts
with the company already
have sent copies of their
agreements plus pension, in-
surance, and SUB plans to
the Industrial Union Depart-
ment of the AFL-CIO for
analysis prior to the confer-
ence.

Mine-Mill Locals 758 in
Chicago and 735 in Cleveland
represent workers at plants
of the Apex Smelting Com"-
pany, a division of American
Metal Climax. U. S. Metals
Refining Company in Car-
teret, N. J., a subsidiary of
American Metal Climax, has
a contract with Mine-Mill
Local 837.

The latter pact expires on
June 30 next year, while the
Apex agreements terminate
on July 31, 1967.

Increasingly over the last
few years, the IUD has been
playing an important role in
the coordination of union bar-
gaining with large corpora-
tions in the non-ferrous 1net—
als and many other indus-
tries.

 

California Farm Workers Score Historic

Victory in Au.,3,0 DiGiorgio Election 

DELANO, Calif.——The United
Farm Workers Organizing Com-
mittee, in its first election since
the new union was formed by
merging the National Farm
Workers Association and the
Agricultural Workers Organiz-
ing Committee, AFL-CIO, won
the right on Aug. 30 to repre-
sent the fie-ld workers at the Di-
Giorgio Corporation——the giant
grower and packer that had
vowed that its workers would
never be organized.

Just a week before, during its '

August 23-26 meeting, the Mine-
Mill executive board issued a
statement supporting the UF
WOC in its efforts to represent
the farm workers. The board
condemned the “b‘.:'.’-.'_:k-breaking”
working conditions in the “fac-
tories in the field” and the
“shockingly low wages,” noting
that “agricultural labor has
been supplied in large measure
from among the Mexican-Amer-
ican, Negro and Filipino peo-
ple.” The union officials said,
“We pledge our continued sup-
port to the expanded organiza-
tional program that this new
union will launch to improve the
wages and working and living
conditions of this most exploited
group of workers.” -

The election—the first bona
fide union representation ballot-
ing to be held among Cali-
fornia’s agricultural workers-
was conducted at two DiGiorgio
ranches — the nearby Sierra

Watered-Down Civil Rights
Bill Faces Senate Filibuster  

WASHINGTON, D.C. —- The
1966 Civil Rights Bill, already
plagued by delay and weaken-
ing amendments, faces still an-
other crucial test——debate on
the floor of the U. S. Senate
virtually certain to involve a
filibuster.

_The stumbling block to Sen-
ate passage of the bill is the
open housing section. Attempts
have been made to induce Sen-
ate Republican Leader Everett
M. Dirksen to accept a com-
promise in this area. The Illi-
nois Senator, who influences a
large number of votes in the
upper chamber of Congress,
however, has flatly stated, “I’ve
seen no compromise or substi-
tute of any kind that I think is
acceptable.”

The controversial fair housing

provision already was watered
down to exclude an estimated
60 percent of the nation’s hous-
ing, prior to its passage by the
House. ‘Excepted from the bias
ban are individuals engaging in
less than three housing transac-
tions in any 12-month period,
sale or rental by persons oc-
cupying one unit of a dwelling

‘containing no more than three

other rental units, and non-profit
religious, fraternal or educa-
tional organizations.

Additionally, two other amend-
ments were adopted by the
House that are designed to
further ensure that the civil
rights bill will be, if passed, a
toothless tiger.

(R-Md.) offered an amendment
which permits a real estate
broker to follow the written in-
structions of a homeowner, even
if discriminatory, in the sale or
rental of a home, providing the
broker does not solicit the in-
structions.

The second change in the
House bill was introduced by
Basil L. Whitener (D-N.C.). This
provides that the Attorney Gen-
eral cannot institute a suit to
desegregate public schools or
facilities unless a written com-
plaint of denial of equal pro-
tection of the laws is first re-
ceived. As originally drafted,
he would have been able to pro-
ceed on his own where such
segregation exists.

So serious is the Republican-
southern Democratic coalition’s
intention to use the long-winded
filibuster that Senate Demo-
cratic Leader Mike 1‘/Iansfield
concedes the bill’s chances fo-r
passage are dim. It seems
doubtful that the two-thirds vote
required to stop a filibuster can
be mustered without the aid of
Sen. Dirksen.

In addition to housing bias,
the Civil Rights Bill——passed by
the House on August 9-—would
prohibit discrimination in the
selection of jurors in federal,
state and local courts, empower
the Attorney General to bring
suit to prevent official or private
intimidation of any person, and‘
prohibit threat or injury to civil
rights workers engaged in “law-
ful”, activities. '

While Congress in recent

'1 years has enacted civil rights

measures aimed primarily at
discrimination in the south, the
fair housing section of the pres-
ent bill would strike, too, at the

- vast_ de facto segregation, in

urban areas of the north. Al-
though the seriousness of this
segregation _‘has been clearly
demonstrated by recent civil
rights marches in Chicago and

other areas, even many north- -

em liberals are reluctant to
support a tough fair housing

leased, and, until these were
cleared up, the results would
not be official. UFWOC spokes-
men, however, pointed out that
they had challanged as many
votes as the Teamsters did, and
that disposition of these ballots
could not alter their victory.
The Teamsters, backed by the
company in the Aug. 30 ballot-
ing, after winning representa-
tion rights for the smaller unit
of shed workers, said that no
matter what the outcome was,
they would not alter their plans
to unionize the bulk of Cali-
fornia’s 80,000 farm workers.

Congratulations Sent

In a telegram sent to farm
workers leader Cesar Chavez,
Mine-Mill President A. C. Skin-
ner said, “The executive board
of our union extends its con-
gratulations to you and your or-
ganization on your victory in
the DiGiorgio election. We sup-
port you in the campaigns that
will follow to organize our coun-
try’s exploited farm workers.”

This story of the first days
of the Delano grape strike is
told by a man who played an
active part in the movement. It
tells the day by day incidents
in the struggle of the farm work-
e»rs—-faced by pressure and in-
timidation—to win union rec-
ognition, higher wages, and de-
cent working conditions.

This is “The Grapes of Wrath”
thirty years latevr—the organized
strength of the growers, chal-
lenged by their employees, us-
ing all the weapons at the com-
mand of the power structure—
inﬂuence and money, the press
and the police. Facing them, a
fledging union of agricultural
workers armed with determina-
tion, a mimeograph, a few
jalopies, and the allies they
have won from among labor and
the community.

The struggle is moving, and
the book is exciting reading. Of
special interest is the-adapta-
tion to a farm wo-rkers strike of
tactics used by the civil rights
movement and the industrial la-
bor unions.

have been on strike for a year,

ment of the farm workers.
They added, “This is really but

Long-Range Effects 

A beginning it is indeed. The
farm workers,
decades, are now on the move.
The working ‘ people of this
country will long remember the
Delano strike, the 300—mi]e pil-
grimage to Sacramento earlier
this year, and the spontaneous
support the farm workers re-
ceived from the entire labor
movement, civil rights groups,
college students and many oth-
ers. This symbolic struggle will
have long-range effects for fu-
ture organizational campaigns
by farm workers everywhere.

Only a few days ago, Texas‘
farm hands from the Rio Grande
Valley climaxed a 400-mile
march to the state capitol in
Austin, demanding a $1.25 mini-
mum wage law. Governor John
Connally, who previously had
refused to convene a special
session of the state legislature
to enact such a law, was de-
liberately absent as the esti-
mated crowd of 10,000 rallied
on the capitol grounds. These
workers claim that their pres-
ent wages range from 20 cents
to a dollar an hour.

Yes, Delano is really but a
beginning.

Agenda at Denver Meeting

DENVER, Colo.—The Mine-Mill national staff, holding its annual meeting here on

federal mine safety legislation, from International Representative Leo Terrill, who

has been stationed in Washington, and on the present legal status of the union, from

‘Mine-Mill General Counsel Nathan Witt.

important" campaigns for state
x legislative seats. Other Congres-

L sional races throughout the

1 ,country,’.too, will see Mine-Mill

playing a role, although in some
areas the locals have not yet de-
cided upon their endorsements.

In his report on the dismissal
by the Subversive Activities Con-
trc*,.,‘,.,.,’Board of charges of “Com-
muiiist-infiltration” against
Mine-Mill and the U. S. Supreme
Court’s unanimous reversal of
the “conspiracy” case convic-
tions of the six remaining de-
fendants, Witt noted the impor-
tant role that Mine-Mill has
played over the years in
strengthening the civil liberties
enjoyed by all Americans. The
high court’s ruling in the Jencks
case several years ago, he poi.nt-
ed out, was later embodied in a
law enacted by Congress which
has been accepted throughout
the nation as a standard part of
an individual’s rights.

Civil Rights Fund

The executive board reported
on the establishment of an in-
ternational union civil rights
fund, which will funnel dona-
tions from Mine-Mill members

and locals broadly to the civil_

rights movement in the U.S.

The fund was kicked off with a

A BROAD AGENDA THAT INCLUDED 1966 POLITICAL ACTION,“developments in the
non-ferrous metals industry, mine safety legislation, the October IUD copper and brass
conference, and current merger discussions between Mine-Mill and the Steelworkers
was covered by the union's national staff, meeting in Denver on Aug. 27, 28, and 29.
Reports from the union's officers, board, and department heads were followed by
lively and lengthy discussion on the various topics.

$1,000 dona-tion voted by the
board.

Research Director Arthur
Stuart commented on the tre-
mendous expansion taking‘ place
in the non-ferrous metals indus-
try, in outlining prospects for
1967 bargaining.

 

Sen. Lee Metcalf
Rough Campaign Ahead

Metcalf, in Tough Fight,
Strongly Backed by Labor

U. S. Sen Lee Metcalf polled some 74,000 votes in
Montana’s Democratic primary election on Aug. 16, while
Gov. Tim Babcock, a Goldwater Republican running for
the Senate, came up with a total of about 56,000 in the
GOP voting. While both men were unopposed in the pri-
maries, Metcalf’s “plurality” of only 18,000 may indicate

plenty of trouble for the liberal Senator in attempting to

retain that seat in the Nov. 8 showdown.

In his winning campaign six years ago, Metcalf
squeaked by with 50.7 percent of the ballots cast, and
most political analysts figure the Montana race to be one

of the hottest in the nation this
fall. The primary results are
viewed with concern by Metcalf
backers because in other years
a Democrat seeking a statewide
office has run 40,000 to 50,000

ahead of his Republican oppo-
nent in the primary.

‘Cross-Over‘ Vote

While only ,42 percent of the
state’s registered voters turned
out last month, there is some in-
dication as well that a large
number of Republicans voted in
the Democratic primary (a reg-
istered voter in Montana may
vote in either party’s election).
Such a “cross-over” vote, stated
Mine-Mill Board Member Bar-
ney Rask of Butte, was at least
partially responsible for the de-
feat of five Mine-Mill candi-
dates, all of whom were run-
ning in the Democratic primary.

The implications of a heavy
“cross-over” vote are serious in-
deed for Metcalf, who is strong-
ly backed by the Mine-Mill lo-
cals in the state.

Along with other organized
labor groups in Montana, the
Mine-Mill locals are mustering
their forces for an all-out cam-

paign in Metcalf’s behalf. The V_

Montana Farmers Union, too,

angry because of the uncertain.
markets for its members, has‘

joined in forming a “Labor for
Metcalf” committee.

The Butte Miners’ Union, in a
joint effort with the AFL-CIO
Committee on Political Educa-
tion (COPE), is gearing for a
determined v 0 t e r registration
drive. There are an estimated
8,000 or more eligible, but un-
regi_stered voters in the city,
most of whomiare thought t
be Democrats. -

Mine Safe1'yiSuppor'|'er

Metcalf, in addition to playing
a key role in ensuring passage
of the Federal Metal and Non-
metallic Mine Safety Act, also
has leveled sharp attacks on the
powerful Montana Power Com-
pany, while favoring public
power development. Montana
Power, charged with having the
second highest rate of return.in
the country, last year spent 12
cents of every dollar earned to
pay stockholder dividends, while
only 13 cents went to pay wages
and salaries, including the big
ones paid its executives.

Because of his consistent sup-
port of liberal and lab-or-backed

legislation, Metcalf faces the 0

opposition of every conservative
and right-wing element in the
state. And such forces are not
weak in Montana.

An indication of that strength
is the formation of a “Right-to-
Work Committee” in the state,
which is receiving aid and en-
couragement_ from the national
RTW Committee.

' Hurt by the Republican “cross_-
overs,” Rask and Gabriel Kuntz,
a member of the Great Falls
Mill and Smeltermen’s Union
No. 16, were defeated in their

primary bids for state Senate, .

nominations. Also losing in the
Aug. 16 balloting were Max Sal-
azar, financial secretary of the
Butte Miners’ Union, and Ray-
mond Graham, president of the

Great. Falls local,‘ who were"

seeking nominations for the state
House of Representatives, and
Ralph Hocking, a member of
Local 1, who was a candidate
for county coroner.

Graham,
primary defeat, has announced
that he will run as an indepen-
dent candidate for the House in
the general election.

THE MINE-MILL UNION,

September. '

,1.  hSCLC10th Convention Urges
Labor-Civil Rights Alliance

JACKSON, Miss.-—Some 900 delegates to the 10th national convention of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference here last month pledged a close alliance with organized labor in working to
_ effect basic changes in.U.S.‘ society so that all Americans can live in dignity and security. Reiter-
.' ating its support ofthe repeal of Section 14(b)’ of the Taft-Hartley Act, SCLC also called for an

immediate $2 an hour minimum wag

year. i

e and for a guaranteed family income of no less than $4,000 a

Pointing to» many’ Mississippi field hands still making only $3 to $4 a day to support his charge

- that ‘slavery continues to exist in the United States, Cleveland Robinson, president of the American

__._Ne’gro Labor Council, said that
unionization is -an important key
'to the solution of the Negro’s
"problems. by The fight to expand
the coverage" of minimum wage
-and other »l'a_bor laws, he main-
~ tained, should have a high prior-
H ity on "the ‘agenda of the civil
rights movement.

Delegates also heard the Rev. -

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
SCLC president, endorse the pro-
posal of labor and civil rights
_ leader A. Phillip Randolph for
"a federal “Freedom Budget” of
M" $100_ billion_ over the next 10
C years to provide freedom and
opportunity for the nation’s 50
. million poor. Such an appropri-
ation, he said, would be “a small
pittance against $25 billion a
year which is supposed to se-
_ cure freedom of 14 million Viet-
'- .namese._’’ , .

Incalling for unilateral iU.S.
steps to de‘-escalate the Viet
Nam.war, a'-' lengthy resolution
adopted on _the conflict,‘ also
pointed to the disproportionate
role being played in combat by
minority group members.
“There is a direct connection,”-

I I‘ 2 the resolution, stated, “between

the despair and cynicism of
young Negroes drawn to vio-

"lerice'in the slums and the cli-
mate of confused purposes and
violence engenderedby this in-
defensible war.”

' Mine-Mill Donation

Mine-Mill International Vice-
President Asbury Howard, a
delegate to the meeting, pre-
sented at a Thursday evening
community mass meeting a $500
donation to SCLC fromi the
union. The presentatio_n of the
check, a contribution from the
international civil rights fund
recently set up by the Mine-Mill
executive board, was made to
Rev. Ralph Abernathy," the

«treasurer and a vice-president

of SCLC.

,The theme of the four-day
conference was “Human Rights,
the Continuing Struggle.”

Most delegates stayed at the
King Edward and ‘the Heidel-

berg Hotels, which previously

never had accommodated a pre-
dominantly Negro convention,
although they have been regis-
tering Negro guests since_the

. ;',I)I' ‘

Civil Rights Act of 1964 took
effect.

Other speakers at the meeting
included Rev. Walter Fauntroy,
pastor of New Bethel Baptist

Church in Washington; Bayard

Rustin and Rev. Virgil Wood of

‘Boston. Panel discussions also

were held on a variety of topics
including “The Non-Violent Per-
spective.”

Delegates strongly reaffirmed
their commitment to the non-
violent approach for the civil
rights movement. The SCLC
board also was expanded through
the addition of several whites.

The convention called for the
strengthening of the fair housing
section of the civil rights bill
now before Congress. Dr. King
stated that the hostility he has
seen on his open housing
marches in Chicago equals any
that the South has exhibited

, over the years.

Federal Mine Safety Bill"?
Enacted by Congress 

(Continued from Page 1)
not get all it had hoped for
from the conference committee.
The state-option feature of the
House-passed version of the bill,
which labor wanted to see dis-
carded, Was kept in the bill, al-
though in modified and improved
form.

The section allows any_ state
which submits a satisfactory
safety plan to the Interior Sec-
retary to carry out its own ad-
ministration and- enforcement.
To receive approval, such a pro-

gram must provide for annual

inspections, enforcement of stan-
dards substantially as effective
as the federal mandatory stan-
dards, sufficient funds and qual-
ified personnel,'and regular re-
ports to the Secretary of the In-
terior. ’ e

The Secretary retains enforce-

ment authority,. however, in
cases of imminent or immediate ’

danger. Further, federal inspec-
tion of mines in such a state is
permitted, and required on at
least an annual basis for under-
ground mines.

A continuing evaluation of all
app-roved state plans must‘ be
made, based both on the federal
inspections and regular reports
from the states to the Secretary
in such form as he may require.
Should he find that a state plan
is not being carried out satis-
factorily,-he .must cancel his
approval, and enforcement will
revert to the U. S. Bureau of
Mines. .

The inclusion of the state-op--
tion in the compromise version
of the bill means that labor or-
ganizations will havea respon-
sibility in also keeping tabs on
the administration of state pro-
grams.. How many states actu-
ally come up with the finances
and personnel to qualify under
the newlaw, of course, is a
matter for speculation. Very
fewthave played much of a role
under the federal-state coopera-

tive arrangement established by _

the Coal Mine Safety Act;

Long Struggle

The Mine-Mill campaign for
federal safety legislation began

back in-- the late 1940’s, when‘.

Sen. James Murray (D-Mont.)
introduced a bill modeled on the
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act
of 1941‘. Such bills were success-
fully bottled up in committee
year after yearby a powerful
mine owners lobby, but Con-
gressional hearings into the
matter finally were achieved in
1956 and 1957. Lee Metcalf of
Montana, then a Democratic
Congressman, chaired the House

Education and Labor Committee.

hearings that were held in vari-

_ous sections of the country, par-

ticularly in the West. _
Again in 1961, hearings were

-held"on. a mine safety bill -for '

the non-ferrous metals industry.

Although more and more Con-’

gressmen were becoming con-

‘ .vincedof_ the need forsuch leg-'

islation, only a compromise bill
was achieved_'—-one authorizing

Fine Safety Pad  

MIAMI, Ariz.—The Miami Miners Union, Mine-Mill ,_
-Local 586, which on many occasions in «thepasti has _
lodged complaints on safety matters at the Inspiration '  -

Consolidated, Copper Company’s Christmas mine near _ 

Winkelman, recently won an outstanding safety agree-

ment covering the property. , V _ o u -_ 
The formal agreement, which becomes part of the

contract at Christmas, establishes a joint committee of
_three union and three management members to improve.
the overall safety program at the mine. Its responsibilities"
will include reviewing the existing safety rules and prac-
tices at the property and recommending changes in them, ‘ ‘

-inspecting all working places,

shafts, drifts, etc., at least once

in every -four-week period, in-..

vestigating the causes of acci-

L dents with a view to thetpreven-.

tion of future occurrences, and
recommending, the installation
of safeguards.

Juan Antunez, Pete’ Herrera
and Marvin, Sells were chosen
by Local 586‘ as the union mem-
bers of _ the e committee, which
will meet‘ at least once every
two weeks and more often if

necessary. Workers taken away.

from their jobs to attend ‘such
meetings will be compensated
for time lost. - -

At a July 18 meeting, attended
by a local union group, Mine-
Mill Board Member Maclovio
Barraza, and management rep-
resentatives, it was suggested

that a union”-company’ joint safe~- '

ty committee replace the then-
existing system of periodic in-

spections at the Christmas mine ,

by co_mpany personnel, accom-
panied by _a rotating, company-
selected “safety secretary” from
the union ranks. ’

"In subsequent meetings ‘be-
tween management and a union
committee", the present -agree-
ment was hammered out. Inter-
national Representative Sylvain
Schnaittacher‘, ‘Jose Hernandez,
Christmas co-chairman, Ray
Reyes, Robert Wade and Elias
Lazarin represented Local 586
in these discussions.

Features of V Agreement I

"Among" the outstanding ‘fea-

tures of the. safety pact are

those sections dealing with 'en-"
forcement of rules, investiga-
-tions of_acci,dents,- and the re-

quire m ent that Inspiration’s

safety engineer make a written
report to the committee of ac- 
‘tion taken with regard to-all of

its recommendations.

enforced, the agreement states, ;  '
.“provided’ that they shall be-ap-—  — 

plied with equal vigoritof em-"
ployees in the bargaining "unit

’ and supervisory employees."

Thus, the union can insist on the
disciplining of supervisors guilty
of unsafe practices, ﬁle griev-
ances on such matters, and even
"carry to arbitration the enforced
imposition of a penalty. _'At7the
same time, the unioncan defend
a worker disciplined. for -safety
matters if the penalty we're’-to, -~
be greater than that- imposed on
supervisors for similar actions.
The agreement provides that
a union committeeman will in-
spect immediately, jointly with
the company engineer, all seri- -
ousaccidents. _ - \ .
Finally, Inspiration has agreed :_ .
that it- will not object to _a union
committeeman . accompanying a
state mine inspector on any in--

spection tourat the property.

Local 586 also -was given the". '

right to open discussions‘ on ‘ac-  _

In.view of the substantial progress already made in our
discussions looking towards a merger of our two organizations
at the earliest possible time consistent with.the requirements
of our respective Constitutions, we recognize that while these
discussions are in progress rivalry between the two organizaw
tions in the non-ferrous metals and other industries in the
United States is inconsistent with our purpose and with the
best interests of our members and the other workers in industry;

we therefore, agree that henceforth and pending the
culmination of our discussions:

1. Each organization and its constituent bodies will
respect the existing bargaining certifications
and contractual relationships of the other in the
nonsferrous metals and other industries in the
United States. L

2. Both organizations will continue their efforts,
together with all other unions in the industry
to develop a comon program for the achievemen
of effective collective bargaining with the
employers.

3. our organizations will cooperate closely in our
efforts to seek improved state and federal labor
and social legislation for the benefit of all
working people and their families in the United

' THE MINE-MILL UNION

Mine-Mill Executive Board Statement on

Mutual Assistance Pact and Merger Talks

The International Executive Board welcomes the mutual assistance pact signed between our
union and the United Steelworkers of America as a historic step towards reuniting the workers
in our industry into one powerful union. , '

For too many years the workers in the metal mining, smelting, refining and fabricating indus-
try have been split into ‘a variety of unions. This has cost them heavily. It has cut their effectiveness
at the bargaining‘ table, in community activities, and in political action. A _ ' '

In recent years, these splits and divisions rather than diminishing have become more-abundant. 
Four and five unions now find it necessary to split representation among a group” of workers to win "

‘ _ The only group’ that has gained from these divisions is the employers.’ The companies from the

  very inception of_ unionism in our industry have promoted a policy of divide and rule-  memjber‘-5 --
1 '_ ship, always understood this. At convention after convention they instructed the elected -leadership

of our union to work for: the unity of the worke'rs in our industry.

We have done so...whenever and wherever we could. When the Industrial Union Department of
the AFL-CIO began to bring some of the workers in our industry together for common bargaining
objectives, we welcomed the move. We participated in a number of companywide conferences called
by the Industrial Union i)epartment. ‘

When we heard thatlthe Industrial Union Department was calling a conference of all the unions
in the brass and copper industry to prepare for 1967 bargaining, we took steps to see" that our union
was part of such a conference. These steps included discussing the matter with I. W. Abel, presi-
dent of the United Steelworkers of America. These discussions inevitably touched on the merger ques-
tion. We were invited to open discussions on merger and bring an end to the senseless warfare be-
tween us. We agreed.

This was not an easy decision. Seventeen years of hostility could not easily be set aside. We
could have made this sufficient reason to bar any merger discussion.

But we could not live in the past. The division and splits among the workers in our industry
were increasing rather than diminishing. The major companies in our industry were growing more
powerful every day. To disregard these facts would be to invite disaster for all workers. '

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, faced with a similar problem, voted
to disband its organization and merge with the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen and the
Switchmen’s Union of North America into one new organization. In doing so they stated—“The al-
ternative is oblivion, which isolationism and living in the past will surely bring.”

Merger discussions with the newly elected leadership of the Steelworkers have been friendly
and productive. The mutual assistance pact signed on August 26 is one of the results. These dis-
cussions have covered a wide range of subjects with principal concentration on how best to combine
Mine-Mill’s traditional bargaining methods with those of the Steelworkers. Our combined member-
ship represents the overwhelming majority of workers in every major metal mining, smelting, and

Our discussions have ranged from the rights and privileges of our local unions to the assign-
ment of our employees, staff and officers, in a merged organization. We feel the end results willbe
worth the time and energy devoted to these discussions. Our goal is to bring an end to the war be-
tween our unions, to combine the bargaining strength and experience of both unions, to achieve
the wages, working conditions, and job protection our membership deserves, to bring our combined
strength -to bear in improving our communities, in legislative and political action work. To achieve
this goal, we must forget the past and look to the future.

About twice as many people buy electric ‘clothes. dryers as

. ~.CONSUMER REPORTS say that many consumers will find‘

“Ia "gas dryercheaper to operate than an electric one. This con-

- rclusion. is based on a 3c per kilowatt hour rate for electricity

,   and-‘ayrate of 9.4c per 100 cu_bic~' feet of natural gas with a heat

‘,7’: content of 1055 BTU per, cubic foot. On this basis, it would cost

“ .I_‘ you $3.38 to dry 26 loads a month with the least power-hungry

V "electricgdryer tested by Consumers Union for a tidy $40.56 a year.

In comparisongthe most-‘ fuel.‘-hungry gas dryers _tested by CU

,  would .do"the.same job‘ for 65¢‘ a month or $7.80 a year; one-fifth

' Since utility rates vary very, widely from place to place, you

 machine; Of. sets‘ purchased between 1961 and 1965,‘ 55% needed’

 _re‘pairs".and most of these broke down at least once during the

of the set, not even a ‘tube replacement." -
 There were very sharp differences among the ‘13 brands on

spin speeds, and a timer that can be set for both long and short
wash periods. The more flexibility you have in selecting these

settings the better you can ‘adapt the machine to‘ the: increasing '

variety of fibers and treatments used for contemporary washable
fabrics.‘ Thus, the appropriate program for colorfast cottons and
linens is a hot wash, warm or cold rinse, and normal wash and
spin speeds.. Noncolorfast cottons, on the other hand, generally
require a warm wash. Sturdy wash-and-wear items can usually
take a hot wash, but the more delicate ones need a warm

‘V or even cold wash. Wash-and-wear clothes generally benefit from

an. inﬂow of cold water before or during spin. .A cold-rinse, and. a
slow, spin, for this program helps prevent wrinklesfrom setting in.

Some fibers. like rayon or acetate are weaker‘ whilevwet andso
should receive a short, gentle ‘agitation. Wool articles shrink less,

and any color which tends. to bleed should do so’ less‘ when a’

cold‘ washsetting is used. A, cold_wash may also be perfectly,
adequate for regular fabrics that are only slightly soiled—a' point

. that is ‘worth ‘keeping in mind should you want" to conserveyour
‘A ‘separate’ prewash ‘cycle can be "helpful in ‘
loosening heavy soil or stains before the regular ‘cycle._ Users ‘

whenthey wash small loads. , V A  g

All the models in CU's test permitted partial fill, but with
varying degrees of convenience. ‘Some,’ required that you stand
by_and_ advance the timer to shutoff the water. There were sharp

differences among the machines" in the water they consumed at _

their maximum -fillfsettting, but these differences were explained

in part by the differences in tub size. Some- machines use-‘con-;

siderably more water than others in the wash and wear cycle.
CU.’s experience indicates that the results achieved’ with these
“thirsty” machines would probably not be any better than those

attained with machines that use appreciably less water tocool

down the clothes at the w‘ash~and-wear setting.

CU does not look with favor on suds-savers—these. involve
using the wash-water’ _over again. Instead, CU ‘suggests the use of
a cold rinse which will usually save from one-third to one-half of
the hot. water you would‘ use on a. regular cycle. For users with
low water pressure, metered, fill in which the water stays _on
until" it has reached the desired level in the; tub is tofbe. preferred
to time-fill in which the water. runs into; the. tub for a. given
number of. minutes .re_gardless of the’ water pressure.

More than half of CU's test samples werereceived with one
defect or another.‘ The deficiences included ‘suchthings as ‘chipped .-
porcelain, missing or defective dispen—sers, broken back-splash 1

order only minutes before the
hearings were scheduled to
open, it upheld Judge Cor-
coran’s ruling that a three-
judge court hear arguments on
the constitutionality of HUAC it-
self. Briefs on the question
were to have been submitted by
Aug. 22.

On the second day of the hear-
ings, Arthur A. Kinoy, a middle-
aged Rutgers ‘University law
professor, was dragged from
the _room, with one policeman

holding him around the neck.
Kinroy’s forcible removal, ord-
ered by" Pool when the lawyer
objected to the manner in which
some testimony ‘was being
taken, led to the walkout by
seven other lawyers, among
them Joseph Forer, who worked
with Mine-Mill‘ General Counsel
Nathan Witt on the SACB case
against the union that was dis-
missed in June. Kinoy, an
ACLU attorney, was,chief coun-
sel for two witnesses who had

challenged the constitutional
basis of the hearings.

New Kind of Witness
Given the opportunity to find

new counsel at this point, the

subpoenaed witnesses‘ refused
to do so. Unlike so many HUAC
witnesses in the past, who, ob-
jecting to the‘ committee’s prob-
ing into their political "beliefs,

‘ refused to answer questions by
-pleading the First, Fifth, and

other Amendments to the Con-
stitution, the young -witnesses

at the August hearings were-

eager to talk.

And talk they did-——filling the
hearing room with condemna-
tion not only of the Viet Nam
war__ and the bill under con-
sideration, but of the hearings
and HUAC ‘itself. Two wit-
nesses were so eager to con-
tinue that they had to be fore-

-ibly removed from the witness

stand. Two others who had been
subpoenaed were not permitted
to testify, over their strenuous
objections. A '

It was a new experience for
HUAC-—one that the group may
not soon forget.

Interestingly enough, two wit-
nesses subpoenaed by the sub-
committee who simply boy-
cotted the hearings were not
cited for contempt of Congress.
But then, HUAC hasn’t been
doing well with its contempt
citations in_ any event. ‘The last
such citation that eventually
was upheld in the courts oc-
curred in 1958. "Only a few
weeks prior to the August hear-
ings, the Court of Appeals re-
versed the contempt citations
of Mrs. Dagmar Wilson, Mrs.
Donna Allen, and Russell Nixon,
who some time_ ago had been
called “before HUAC concerning
their peace activities.

Over 35,000 striking members of the International Association of Machinists ratified on Aug. 19la.‘new three-S’

The escalator clause, the lack of which was a prime reason in an earlier

tinue their upward spiral." ‘
Congratulations Sent
Mine-Mill executive board
members, meeting in Denver
the following week, sent _con-
gratulations to the Machinists,
calling their success in breaking
“unjust and dis-
criminatory guidelines . . . a
' contribution to the welfare of all
wage earners.” The board state-
ment saluted the unity of the
strikers “in the face of massive
pressure from the employers,
the administration, - and the
press.” , ' ' ,

by American labor, which would

I

“The camp was terrific! Everybody and everything was great!” Lamont Hinshaw,

one of 17 children—sons and daughters bf members of Mine—lVIi,ll Local 593 in Buffalo,
N. Y.—who spent two weeks last month at Richard Lake Camp in Sudbury, Ont., typi-
fies inhis remark above the reactions of the kids to the vacation experience.

A The youngsters and some of their parents, on Aug. 31 after their return, met with
Buffalo Mayor Frank Sedita, carrying greeting“ to him from Mayor Max Silverman of
Sudbury and an invitation to visit the Ontario city. But this was secondary to the trip

and_the vacation itself, as far
as the kids were concerned. ‘

Clarise Gawron, for example,
called the camp, owned and
operated by Mine-Mill'Local 598,
“the best place I’ve ever spent
"a summer vacation.”

Many Activities

, In addition to the swimming,
canoeing, horseback riding, and
many other sports and crafts,
the children enjoyed such spe-
cial events as cook-outs, dances,
hootenannies, and a concert of
bagpipe music. In expressing
their hopes of returning to the
camp in future years, several
-of the youngsters. had high
praise, too, for the food that was
served there.

V The children were the first
such group of Americans to visit
the Sudbury camp, and the ex-
perience was something new
both for them and for the 75 or
so Sudbury area youngsters Va-
cationing at the camp. Both
groups, at the end of the two
weeks, had many new tales to
tell about the fun they had with
their new friends from another
country. '

The Buffalo, Local 593 spon-
sored the vacation trip, picking
up a suggestion from William
Longridge, Canadian Mine-Mill
secretary-treasurer, made on an
earlier trip to Buffalo, that the
Sudbury camp was well worth
visiting. All members of the
local were eligible to participate
in a drawing, through which 10
of the children had the costs of
the Aug. 7 to 20 vacation paid
for by Local 593. Seven addi-
tional children joined the trip as
well. ’

The 850-mile journey was
made by chartered bus, with a
stopxin Toronto so that some
sightseeing could be done there.
Several members of the local
chap-eroned the trip as far as
Toronto, where personnel from
the union’s Canadian office met
the group and accompanied it
the rest of the way.

Sudbury Mayor Silverman, in
welcoming the children to the
city, stressed both the educa-
tional and enjoyable nature of
their trip. He urged, too, the
youngsters never to despair of
the sacrifices involved in obtain-
ing a formal education, since
their future success would be so
heavily dependent on it.

‘Tremendous Gesture‘
The sponsoring of the trip by
the Buffalo local was termed a
“tremendous gesture” by Leo
Jones, reeve of the United
Townships of Neelon and Gar-
_ son and a member of Mine-Mill
’ 598, who in a later letter to the
mayor of Buffalo said, “I am
sure the children of both areas
benefited greatly and spent
many happy hours in friendly
comradeship.”
The Buffalo kids hear him out,
.- and‘. then‘ some. Here’s what a
few of them had to say about
their two-week vacation: ‘

Sonora Local Wins
I5-Gent Wage Hike

SONOLA, Calif.——An immedi-
ate across-the-board wage boost
of 15 cents per hour is included
in a new contract ilgreemgnt
between Mine—Mill Local 542
and the U. S. Lime Products
Company, a division of Flint-
kote. The settlement was rati-
fied at 7 a.m. on Aug. 1 at the

_ ‘change house, where workers
 all were prepared for picket
line action. 9

The union’s bargaining com-
mittee, which had been in ses- .
sion with the company through-

mended approval in_making its
report.

Although the agreement is for
two years’ duration, wages and
pensions bo-th will be open in
the second year, and the work-
ers will have the right to strike
on those issues at that time.

 The Labor Scene

Guidelines Faulty. Economists Admit

Walter W. Heller, who was chairman of the President’s Council
of Economic Advisers under President Kennedy, admits that the
wage guidelines failed to provide for increases in the cost of living.
He told the Washington Star that the jump in living costs has wiped
out any gain in purchasing power .won by workers who we-re held
to the 3.2 percent wage increase guideline.

In the same Washington Star story, an unnamed economist is
quoted as saying-that the “guideposts have been violated mainly
on the price side, rather than by wage increases. Profits,” he
said, “are sitting there like a golden egg, and starting now, labor
is going to demand and get a share of it. I don’t see how we can
ever again expect to obtain labor’s even grudging acceptance of
the guideposts unless we correct the distortions caused by price

increases.” * * *
Over $2 Billion Paid by UMWA Fund

v

The United Mine Workers’ welfare and retirement fund, which

marks its 20th anniversary this year, announces that during that
period it has paid out more than $2 billion in benefits to UMWA
members’ and their families. Pensions were paid to 121,353 miners,
and death benefits, widows and survivors payments were made to
199,731. '

_ The fund, which also provides hospital and medical care bene-
fits, is financed by 40-cent-per-ton royalty payments from the indus-
try on each ton of coal produced.

‘A’ at,
Public Employees Restless

Public workers unions——firefighters, teachers, nurses, municipal
employees—are chafing against the no-strike clauses in their con-
tracts. An unauthorized strike of Atlanta firefighters took place
this year; nurses in several cities have participated in “mass
resignations;” teachers’ strikes have erupted—most dramatically in
New York. Unions with strike bans in their contracts are having
a long, hard look at them.

 Increases In Union Membership

Figures from the national office of the AFL-CIO show an in-
crease of'900,000 in membership, making the total for the first
..time over 13 million. The independent Teamsters report an in-
crease of over 61,000 for the first seven months of 1966, to a total

membership of 1,568,745. , '
 AFL-CIO officials claim that although some membership in-
ﬁ>__.ac-rease is due-to the generally higher economic level in the country,
V there is~also “clear evidence of successful organizing drives.” The
_ -National Labor Relations Board’s report for June is a sample-
-;-u,nions won 62.6 percent of all elections in that month——up from
 59 -percent for June of 1965.

S Disabled and Unemployed

    Non-Union M mer Faces Troubles on His Own     
. - PALISADE, Colo.——Clifton (Curly) Wall, 31, is a permanently disabled uranium miner._ He wears a leather-padded steel back brace and, A‘ 79-;
«  because of his back injury, he has been unemployed for two and a half years. His story serve  ‘.

s_ to strongly point out the need for federal mine safety

legislation, revision of the state workmen’s compensation laws, and perhaps even more importantly, a miner's need for a union. . _
' Wall, after prospecting for four and one half years, went to work in the Burro Mine at Slick Rock, Colo., in the fall of 1959. The uranium mine‘ * ‘

The Burro Mine was non-union-.- Wa-l

earning $50 to,$70 a day ($11-50
per foot for main drifts).

.The company, however, soon
began to reduce the rates for
contract mining. By 1964, vir-
tually‘ all contract mining had

. been eliminated in the mines
,1 operated ‘by Union Carbide, and.

 the ‘miners. were. working for a

‘basic rate of . about $2.45 an

Wall, “the..company was able to
_ _reduce- the pay rates as it saw
fit." . -

In addition to the 1‘educed
‘earnings, there were accidents
at the Burro Mine. There was
‘a cave-in on the mainhallway
-in"1962. Although nobody was
injured or trapped, the miners
had to work nearly nine hours
B overtime to clear the debris.

_ Thefollowing year a fire
broke out which completely de-
-stroyed the No. 5 shaft of the
mine, Again, miraculously, there

, were" no injuries. -

_ “I went into that shaft with
.-federal and state mine inspec-
 tors four days later,” said Wall.

I -“The inspectors concluded that

_it was either a cigarette thrown

into the shaft at quitting time,

" or a main station cave-in caus-
_ ing the power lines to be cut.
V .'‘The shaftwas closed and, as far

'3 . a's'I know, there was no further

' attempt to find out what caused
the fire."

gation of the fire, the federal
governmenthas had no power
to enforce stricter safety mea-
sures in non-ferrous mines. Ad-
ditionally, the'_ Bureau has not

been able to investigate mine .

accidents without the permis-
sion ‘of’ the company involved,
except during a two-year safety
survey authorizedvby the Metal
and Non-Metallic Mines Study
Act of 1961.

The study. conducted from
1962 to -1964,',*.;*ibstantiated Mine-

lMill’s charges that the death

and accident rates in the non-
ferrous mining industry were
excessive.-It also recognized the

A need for a federal mine safety

law in order to standardize safe-
ty codes and inspection, noting
that state mine safety laws and
their enforcement have been in-
adequate. The Metallic and Non-
Metallic Mine Act, having been
passed by both Senate and
House, now awaits only Presi-
dent Johnson’s signature before
becoming a new federal law.

Wall also said that some of
the equipment at the Burro Mine
was dangerously in need of re-
pair. While working as a hoist--
man, he reported to the com-
pany that the brake mechanism
on the hoist_ was not working
properly. “It was days before
that brake was repaired,” said
Wall. He added, “In the mean-
time, men and equipment were

Injured in 1964
On March 4, 1964, Wall and

. another miner were unloading

a 300-pound diamond drill which
they had just brought to the sur-
face in a hoist. Standing inside
the hoist, Wall was lifting the
drill over the lip of the cage
. when he slipped on grease cov-
ered air hoses that were coiled
on the floor. His back twisted

, with the full weight of the drill

on him. The other miner, who
had been helping to lift the drill
from outsid_e the hoist, prevent-
ed it from crushing Wall as
he fell. ‘

The injured .miner reported
the accident to the shift boss at
the hoisthouse. Thinking the in-
jury was minor, Wall declined
an offer to see a doctor that day
and was then sent home. He
later discovered that he was
paid only for the portion of the
shift that he worked prior to his
injury. -

Wall reported to work the next

. day, complaining of back pain

to the mine superintendent, He
was driven to the San Juan Hos-
pital in Monticello, Utah, for an
examination and X-rays. After
having to wait two days for the
results, he was admitted to the
hospital and immediately put
into traction.

A week later he was trans-
ferred to St. Mary’s Hospital in
Grand Junction,_ Colo., and

placed under the care of an.

orthopedic specialist. During his
three-week stay in the hospital,
he received a check for two
weeks’ pay from Union Carbide
——with no explanation.

After being released from the
hospital, Wall visited the Union
Carbide office in Grand Junc-
tion only to find that he had
been laid off, and that the check
he had received was for sever-
ance pay. The Burro Mine had-
shut down. A

“I didn’t think that the com-
pany could do that to me,” said
Wall, adding, ‘_‘I was injured on_
the job before the mine was
closed.” Nevertheless, knowing
that Wall" was hospitalized and
in traction, due to an injury suf-
fered while. on the job, Union
Carbide coldly, laid him off with
two weeks’ pay. ’

.Worke_rs' Responsibility V N

"All of the miners had been.
previously informed of the pend-_

ing shutdown of the mine. The

‘ company refused to transfer the

miners to one of its other prop-
erties, making lt their responsi-
bility to find other jobs. They

3e

    

K‘

 

were told that if they could
make arrangements to be hired
at another Union Carbide prop-
erty, their seniority would be
transferable.

Wall was told by his doctor
that he would be able to go back

Clifton (Curly) Wall
Disabled Miner Has cu Wife
and Four Children

to work within six months. After

five months, heiagain visited the

Union Carbide office, this. time
to ask about his return to work.
He was informed that the poli-
cies of Union Carbide prevented
the company from hiring a
miner with a back injury, even
if the injury was incurred in
one of its own mines. When the
unemployed miner asked about
a different type ofljob, he was
callously told that the company
could re-hire him for a week or
so—-then fire him—thus making
him ineligible for any work-
men’s compensation for his in-
jury.

“I guess that I was lucky, in
a way, that they (Union Car-
bide) refused to re-hire -me,”
said Wall. He added, “At least

I still have my workmen’s com- .

pensation checks.”

Operations Unsuccessful

two separate double back fusion
operations. When he twisted his
back, some vertebrae ,were
pulled loose from each other.‘
The back fusion is an operation

performed to reunite the .verte- .
_ licans, who were included in the3=:_

brae. and fuse them together;

After the second operation, Wall . "
was placed in. a. full body.cast _.

to immobilize his back, and fur-
ther ensure that the bones‘ would
fuse. After this failed, he had a
series of nerve block operations
(the deadening of thelnerves in
order to reduce or eliminate
pain). - ,

In 1965, ‘after his first opera-

" tion, Wall was scheduled to at-

Zinc Producers Expect High Consumption

The recent slackening of auto production resulting from early
model changeovers and the normal vacation slowdown caused a
drop in zinc use in July. However, steel industry use of zinc for
galvanizing continued strong. Zinc producers look for continued
high consumption, too, when auto production picks up in September.

The Auto Safety Bill was ‘
passed by the House by a 365 to

Standard safety equipment to
be included on the 1968 models
are head rests, shoulder har-1

Some of the automobile manu- .

Kennecott Precipiiatin Plant Fatality in Utah

Donald Vicchrilli, 56, a member of Mine-Mill Local 485 in Bingham Canyon, was killed at the
precipitation plant of the Utah, Coppsg, Division of Kennecott Copper Corporation on July 20. He was
struck by a high pressure" stream of water which knocked him into a launder, resulting in fatal in-
juries. The accident was investigated by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, which reports that 3: stream of

leach solution shot uncontrolled from a nipple on a main pipe after the nipple slipped while the main

was being worked on by pipe
repairmen.
The Bureau made the follow-

' ing recommendations to prevent

a similar accident in the future:

0 Regardless of prior in-
pections, workmen should al-
way check the condition of the
couplings and securing bolts
on sections of pipe between
the main and shutoff valve be-
fore dismantling pipe.

0 A regular periodic in-
spection of the piping installa-
tion should be established.

0 Pressures should be re-
duced when work is to be un-
dertaken on the piping instal-
lation.

O Workmen should always

. be aware of the movement of

other personnel in the Vicinity,

and warn them ’ away from
hazardous areas.

.Division’s annual safety report
for 1965 "reports that the acci-.

dent frequency rate was 2.22, as
compared with a record low
rate of 1.49 in 1964. This repre-
sents a 49 percent increase.

There were five fatal acci-
dents in the. Western Division
in 1965, and tota1..lost-time acci-
