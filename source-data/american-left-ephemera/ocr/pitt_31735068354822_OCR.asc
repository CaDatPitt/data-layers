The new settlement was to golbefore the membership in both Sudbury and Port Colborne for ratification this week.
The proposed Inco agreement provides for a wage increase of 71/2 cents across the board, an additional 3 cents for tradesmen and other
adjustments ranging as high as 20 cents an hour for many workers. 0

IT. ALSO CALLS for an extra ,

.week’s vacation for more than
8,500 workers, an additional

statutory holiday with aneasing

of qualifications, improved medi-
‘cal, sickness and accident and life
insurance protection, and several
changes in the body of the agree-
ment which further strengthen

Most important, the settlement
brought a break into the com-
pany’s resistance to the union’s
demand for improvements in the
mines contract bonus system.,, The
mines bonus gains, although not

as originally 7 placed before the
are ’most significant

disputes. --

They set up bonus committees
of employeeson which the Inter-
national union and local union
officers are represented. In addi-
tion, the company will now allow
a process allowance of $1 per day

per man which will be credited to.

the-contract earnings. This allow-
ance will reduce substantiallythe
number pf miners who fail to
make bonus. ‘

BECAUSE of the complicated

bonus -system, it is difficult to"

estimate -bonus gains in the total
package. ‘Without counting the
bonus -(gains, the new -agreernent

adds" up to more than 10 centsan"

hour. The bonusgains may well
bring the total package to about
13 cents an hour.

These gains are in addition to
the 51/2 cents interim wage in-
crease won by the union in
December, which, brings the
union’s' gains at‘ Inco" since last
June to a total of more than 18
cents._f A

Considered by the union as the’

most difficult bargaining in its
history of negotiations with Inco,

2 the talks went on for several

Weeks until a deadlock was
reached. This was followed by
intervention by the Conciliation
service, which resulted in a Con-
ciliation Board hearing in Toronto
July 4 and I5. I

IN THE MEANTIME, im-
patient. with delays and resentful
of » the unfair actions of super-
vision in the mines, miners staged
brief walkouts at three of lnco’s
mines’ in the Sudbury district.
Contract miners also stopped
working on Bonus Rule 1 and

continued at normal effort and on
day's pay. -

Following two days of hearings
before the Board of Conciliation,
the union and the company moved
into direct bargaining, and after
three days of continuous sessions

an agreement was reached for
submission to the membership.

Members of the negotiating
committee were: District 8 Board

Member Nels Thibault, spokes-
man; Local 598 president Mike
Solski, chairman with Local 598
members Carl Nielsen, John Gal-
braith, Clem _Smith and Stan
Racicot. Local 637 was repre-
sented by president Mike Kopi-
nak, S. Houde, Gavin Cowper and
Lloyd James. Int’l representa-

tives John Smaller and George
Herman assisted the committee.

How thé’ government’s so—called
“stabilization” program looks after 17
months of operation was the subject of
a report by Int’l rep. Herman Clott,
Mine-Mill’s Washington representative,
to the National Wage Policy Commit-
tee here. . I
“It’s been 17 months of price increases

.. . and 17 ‘months of‘ wage freeze,” Clott

declared. “Both the wage freeze and
price control have worked finc—for the
big corporations. The stabilization»pro-

gram accomplished exactly (what the

majority of Congress expected it to do
——allow prices to reach their own level
and to grant just as much wage in-

_ creases as the pressure of the workers

demanded.”
Reviewing the record of the Wage

' Stabilization Board, Clott pointed out

that there have been some change in

V the Board’s. outlook.

“The professional wage freezers were '
riding merrily along, giving a little
here and taking a little there, until the
house almost collapsed on them. - The
Board had the audacity to recommend

  IINION enters the final phase of the
: 1952 bargaining struggle in a year of presa

'  «ridential and congressional elections. '

While we fight to maintain and extend the

 .living standards of our membership, we en-

 counte'r"a continuous attack by a reactionary
Congress to suppress our right to fight and; to
destroy our gains.

V’ The-Truman Administration, despite its
avowed. friendliness, to labor, has, in effect,
aided and abetted this growing. - conspiracy
against the unions. It has created and ‘directed '
a foreign policy which has resulted in a dis-
astrous war, which, if continued, can but lead
the American people to economic. ruin. -

— We state that our economic fight cannot
continue _to be successful unless the present di-
rection of our economy is halted. We must

. return to a government_progr'am not for special-
‘ interests and war, but for the people and peace.

. ' YET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE have
little choice, The reactionary Taft is under-
stood for what he is by laboring people every-
where. Eisenhower in the few short weeks’ he
has been back in this country has already indi- ’
cated his own reactionary formula against
labor, in addition to suggesting the immediate

. us,e‘_of the Taft-Hartley Act against the strik--.,
ting ‘Steelworkers.

"  . The Democratic_ Party’s prospective candi-

dates, including President Truman, leave un-

answered the question uppermost in the minds

of the people-—-how to end the wasteful, sense-
‘ '1ess_war in Korea. I I

The war hysteria, the political oppression

oflabor and its allies, the disastrous disunity

WASHINGTON (FP).——Halls of the
national Capitol were quiet July 8 af-
ter the “cold war” 82nd Congress
finally managed to adjourn. It had
voted almost everything for war proj-
-ects but very little for the people at
home, except increased restrictions on
civil liberties and increased discrimi-
nation against racial ‘minorities’ and
the foreign born.
i_The 82nd Congress will not recon-
vene unless called back by President
Truman. The 83rd Congress is sched-
uled to meet Jan. 3 next year.

After stalling‘ for six months on

‘most appropriations, Congress in its
final week-end flurry passed money ‘
bills totaling‘ $56.7 billion‘, some $8
"billion less than requested. Sharp cuts
were made in welfare and domestic
programs. The $60 million appropriat-
ed for the entire economic stabiliza-
tion program was so small that the
Office of Price Stabilization started
-plans .to close many of its regionaland I
district offices. , _

_ ADMINISTRATION requests for
"military and war—connected appropria-
tions were passed almost in entirety.
The $6 billion mutual security. appro-
priation passed earlier had drastically

6 reduced economic aid against the wish-

’ es of the administration and AFL and

CIO leaders. But the military pro-
gram was left almost intact.

In the foreign‘ relations field, Con-
gress approved the Japanese peace
treaty and Pacific security pact as
well as the new contracts with West
Germany, making that country part
of the European defense pattern. ’ ,

The Congress set a record on the
5 domestic front whichcaused many crit-
ics to say that the 80th Congress,
described by Truman as the “do-.noth-
ing” Congress, appeared progressive.

Full text of a statement iiadopt'c\d- by the Mine-Mill In

It June 25‘

In this political climate the International

Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers“ be-

lieves that the best ‘interests of our member-
ship can be served "by-a reaffirmation of our
traditional policy of independent ‘political
action. This Ineanssupport of pro-labor candi-
dates no matter .whether‘. they_.be members of
I Democratic or Progressive
Parties. A.  I 3 “ V

THIS .POLI‘CY, of "course, will be most
effective when  is applied to congressional,

state,,_and ‘local political contests. Byactively,
intervening intthe compaigns now, we can help I

to defeat several of theimost reactionary sena-

tors and congressmen. Our membership, if well

organized, registered, and broughtftoftthe polls
can most certainly help to elect a bloc of pro-

gressive and liberal congressmen and senators

dedicated to a program best suited to the needs
0.f;our‘ unionls membership and of the Ameri-
can ‘people as" ajwhole. ’ . V L’

In state. and local elections we can, in many
‘areas, bedecisive in the election of state offi-
cials who "will commit themselves to ai-program
of revising state compensation laws and fight
for the enactment of additional ‘laws to protect
workers in our industry.

  THE FORCEFUL and independent role of‘
our. union was recognized in the recent confer-'

ence"of~ the National .Wage Policy Committee.

The delegates concluded that one of the most
effective instruments forthe success of our

bargaining fight with the employers is I‘ our
membership’s activities on the political front.

uate our participation in the political arena?
this year: V ‘ '
1: Political action, conferences should 
called in every area and state where, we
have a concentration of membership. ‘

-2:: At these ‘meetings, arrangements should ]
be formulated for the interviewing and,
appraisal of the candidates of all political‘

‘* parties. - f I‘ 

3: These appraisals should be primarily con-‘-,
cerned with the various candidates’ vposi-.f_.
tions on such issues. as Taft-Hartley civil?
rights, fair employment practices," Smith and
McCarran Acts, flood control .and Works
projects, low-cost housing, adequate sch0ols,T
and public. health. Of greatest importance,
of course, is the question of peace and‘pro_s-"
perity as the alternative to warand depress;
sion. A. ‘

4-‘ After appraising the various candidates,
our membership in every area should :.then;
be in a position to endorse candidates. Itfj
may be that in someinstances our members 
may want to runindependent candidaLtes"o’£>

5- In order to guarantee the politi‘caLweight\‘

each local union, embark upon a campaign
‘of full registration of our members and theirs.-

FACTS on prices u
Company‘ . spokesmen are s using. the

foolish argument in negotiations with
Mine-Mill that prices are “declining”

v -therefore they ‘‘can’t afford” to grant

a wage V increase.

The copper price today is 24'/2 cents
a pound. That’s \more. than twice, as
high as the 12-cent price which held
all the‘way through World War II.

._ And the copper companies made plenty

high profits during every one of the
War years. ‘ g

1 Lead is_selling for 16 cents a pound.
That compared with the 61/; cent a
pound price paid during World'War II.
Zinc,,at 15 cents"a.pound today, is just

.a shade less. than twice as high as the-
—8‘/; cent price of the war ye_ar_s.’

,‘The‘copper price hasn’t fa-ltered a
bit in morethan two years.,Lead and

0 zinc prices. dropped a bit this spring,

but they’re up again.
Next -time the company ,“experts”

- trot out the “falling price” argument,

Mine-Mill negotiating committeemen
might remind them that we don't‘ eat

copper, lead or zinc. If we,_did, they’d

be too expensive.

‘Most anti-labor’ gov’t
routed in B. C. vote

VANCOUVER, B. C. —- With
final choices coming in from the
48 constituencies of tliis province,
it is now apparent, that a huge
protest vote registered for the
Social Credit and CCF (Coopera-
tive ‘Commonwealth Federation)‘
parties has swept the old-line
Liberal and Conservative parties
almost in_to oblivion.

Standing of the candidates now
has Social Credit showing an
edge of one seat to the‘ CCF’s 14,
while the Liberals’ have won six
and the Conservatives only two.

Tom Uphill, of the Labor_VRep-
resentation Comximittee, ‘was
elected in Fernie‘ on, the second
ballot, and Mine-Mill member Leo

‘Nimsick of Kimberley, endorsed

by the ~LRC_. biit running as CCF,
was also elected with a large
majority. ’ A

Social~ Credit, the new factor
in B. C. politics, is likely to form

[a minority government in the

opinion of moist press pundits, al-
though With the CCF leading in
six" of the undecided seats it_is
difficult to say how muchcof this
View is due to wishful thinking.

But one thing is certain. If the
parties are honest enough to an-
alyze the June 12 Vote objective-
ly, the dictatorial attitude of the
last Coalition (Liberal and ‘Con-
servative) government towards
the people in general and labor in
particular, coupled with the alien-
ationof most of B. C.’s resources
to foreign interests, must be
blamed for the "complete rout of
the two old parties. ,

If the new government, of
whatever complexion, realizes
this, labor cannot help but bene-
fit from this near extinction of
What was probably the most anti-
labor government in many years

; of B.C. history.

VANCOUVER, B. C.—First major
break-through on the 1952 British Co-
lumbia strike front came last week
with tentative settlement of the AFL
Carpenters walkout. . 

The settlement called for a wage in-
crease of 10 cents an hour and pay-2_

iment of board at the rate of $2.50 to

carpenters working , on’ out-of-town,
jobs. By cracking the contractors’
earlier “no wage increase” position,

the AFL workers helped to open the
road for similar victoriesfthroughout
the strike-bound construction industry.‘ ,
And they split the recently-formedii

 

united front -of British Columbia; em-  

. ployers.

More than 2,000 carpenters were
scheduled to vote ‘shortly on the pro-
posed settlement- ‘

tionary coalition of some character

_may put new weapons in their hands,

although such hopes are growing slim‘-
mer now as final returns come in from

Complicating the labor situation, and
encouraging the employers, is also -the
factthat unemployment in ‘this prov-

D ince is up 70,000 over last year, a pe-

culiar circumstance in an area which
all the boss organs declare is bene-
