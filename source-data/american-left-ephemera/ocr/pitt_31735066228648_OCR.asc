of work can, through the Agitation League, keep
up their end of the job of digging capitalism's

parts of the country. A report of the League's re-
ceipts and expenditures appears each week in the
Appeal. 9

Ratiﬁcation of the Amendments.

SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT.

The sixteenth amendment was unanimously ap-
pr_oved in the Senate July 5, 1909, and by a. vote of
317 to 14 in the House on July 12. It was ratiﬁed

proved January 19, 1886. In case of the removal,
death, resignation or inability of both the Presi-
dent and Vice-President, then the Secretary of State
shall act as President until the disability of the
President or Vice-President is removed or a Presi-
dent is elected. If there be no Secretary of State,
then the Secretary of the Treasury will act, and the
remainder of the order of succession is as follows:

tary of the Interior.

advice and consent of the Senate, and are eligible
under the Constitution to the Presidency..

The act of Congress raising the Department of
Agriculture to the rank of an executive department
and giving its head a seat in the President’s Cabinet

and the act creating the Department of Commerce.

and Labor were both passed subsequently to the
Presidential succession act. By intention or in-
advertence Congress did not extend the provisions
of the succession act'to these two additional Cabi-
net officers. There is no warrant for considering

-the Secretary of Agriculture and the _Secretary of

Commerce as in the line of succession. But no
judicial interpretation has yet been made of the
provisions of the succession law and of the acts
creating the eighth and ninth executive depart-
ments. .

The bill creating the Department of Labor became
a law on the last day’s session of the Sixty-second
Congress, March 4, 1913. The head of this de-

partment, like the two Cabinet officers just men-“

tioned, is not in the line of Presidential succession.

personal economic interests the small farming or
mechanic classes.

The overwhelming majority of members, at least
ﬁve-sixths, were immediately, directly and per-
sonally interested in the outcome of their labors at
Philadelphia, and were to a greater or ‘less extent
economic beneﬁciaries from the adoption of the

constitution.

i * i

(Page 151.) g

It cannot be said, therefore, that the members of
the convention were “disinterested.” On the con-
trary, we are forced to accept the profoundly signiﬁ-_
cant conclusion that they knew through their per—
sonal experiences in economic affairs the precise
results which the new government that they were
setting up was designed to attain.

~k A’ ’

(Pages 324-325.)

_The movement for the constitution of the United
States was originated and carried through prin-
cipally by four groups of personalty interests which
had been adversely affected under the articles of
confederation: money, public securities, manufac-
tures, and trade and shipping. V

The first ﬁrm steps toward the formation of the
constijution were taken by a small and active‘
group of men immediately interested through their
personal possessions in the outcome of their labors.

No popular vote was taken directly or indirectly
on the proposition to call the convention which
drafted the constitution. .

The propertyless masses under the prevailing’ suf-
frage qualiﬁcations were excluded at the outset
from participation (through representatives) in the
work of framing the constitution.

The members of the Philadelphia convention
which drafted the constitution Were, with a few
exceptions, immediately, directly, and personally
interested in, and derived economic advantages
from, the establishment of the new system. ,

The constitution was essentially an economic’
document based upon. the concept that the funda-
mental private rights of property are anterior to
government and morally-beyond the reach of «popu—
lar majorities.

The major portion of the members of the con-
vention are on record as recognizing the claim of
property to a special and defensive position in the
constitution.

three-fourths of the adult males failed to vote.on
the question, having abstained from the elections
at which delegates to the State conventions were
chosen, either on‘ account of their indifference or
their disfranchisement by property qualiﬁcations.
The constitution was ratiﬁed by a vote of probaz
bly not more than one-sixth of the adult males.
,It is ques-tionable whether a majority of the
voters participating in the elections for the State
conventions in New York, Massachusetts, New

. Hampshire, Virginia, and South Carolina, actually,

approved the ratiﬁcation of the Constitution.

The leaders who supported the Constitution in
the ratifying conventions represented the same
economic groups as the members of the Philadel-
phia convention; and in a large number of in-
stances they were also directly and personally in-
terested in the outcome of their efforts. "

In the ratiﬁcation, it became manifest that the
line of cleavage for and againstthe Constitution
was between substantial personalty interests on
the one hand and the small farming and debtor
interests on the other. '

The Constitution was not created by “the whole
people,” as the jurists have said; neither was it
created by “the States,”
long contended; but it was the work of a con-
solidated group whose interests knew no State
boundaries and were truly national in their scope.

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

N DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
Historical Note from the Tribune Almanac.

The delegates of the United Colonies of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and
Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Castle, Kent and
Sussex, in elaware; Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina and South Carolina, in Congress as-
sembled at Philadelphia, resolved on the 10th of
May, 1776, to recommend to the respective as-
semblies and conventions of the United Colonies,
where no government sufficient to the exigencies
of their affairs had-been established, to adopt such
a government as should, in the opinion of the
representatives of the people, best conduce_to the
happiness and safety of their constituents in par-
ticular and of A.merica in general. A preamble to
this resolution, agreed to on the 15th of May,
stated the intention to be totally to suppress the
exercise of every kind of authority under the
British crown. .

On the 7th of June certain resolutions respect-
ing independence were moved and seconded. On
the 10th of June it was resolved that a committee
should be appointed to prepare a declaration to the
following effect: “That the United Colonies are,
and of right ought to be, free and independent
states; that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British crown, -and that all political connec-
tion between them and the State of ‘Great "Britain

, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.”

The Drafting Committee.

On the succeeding day it was determined that
the committee for preparing the declaration should
consist of ﬁve, and they were chosen accordingly,
in the following order: Jefferson, J. dams,
Franklin, Sherman, R. R. Livingston. On the 11th
of June also a resolution was passed to appoint /a
‘committee to prepare and digest the form of a
confederation to be entered into between the col-
onies, and another committee to prepare a plan
of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers. On
the 12th of June it was resolved that a committee
should be appointed by the name of a Board of‘War
and Or nance, to consist of ﬁve members; H '

Onthe 25th of June a declaration "of the deputies
of Pennsylvania, met in provincial ~conferenc*e, ex-
pressing their willingness to concur in a vote de-
claring the United Colonies free and independent
States was laid before Congress and read. On the

28th ‘of June the committee appointed to prepare
a declaration of independence brought -in a draft,
which was read and ordered to lie on the table.
On the 1st of July a resolution of the convention
of, Maryland, passed the 28th of June, authorizing
the deputiesof that colony to concur in declaring
the United Colonies free and independent States,
was laid before Congress and read.

On the same day Congress resolved itself into
a_ committee of the whole to take into considera-
tion the resolution respecting independence. On
the 2nd of July a resolution declaring the Colonies
free and independent States was adopted. A dec-
laration to that effect was, on the same and the
following days, taken into further consideration.

Finally, on the 4th of July, the Declaration of
Independence was agreed to,
signed by John Hancock, as President, and directed
to be sent to the several assemblies, conventions
and committees, or councils of safety, and to the
several commanding officers of the Continental
troops, and to be proclaimed in each of the United

.States and at the head of the army.

The Second Signing. _

It was also ordered to be entered upon the
Journals of Congress, and on the 2nd of August a
copy, engrossed on parchment, was signed by all
but one of the ﬁfty-six signers- whose names are
appended to it. That one was Matthew Thornton,

In Congress, July 4, 1776. I
The unanimousdeclaration of the thirteen United
When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary for one people‘ to

dissolve the political bands which have connected .

them with another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God
entitles them, a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare. the
causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal, that they are endowed

"by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,

engrossed on paper, ,

o

1l0 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND ~

that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Gov-

ernments are instituted among Men, deriving their’

just powers from the consent of the governed;
That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the

 

People to alter or to abolish it, and to" institute a

new Government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dic-
tate that Governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient causes; and ac-
cordingly all experience hath shown, that man-
kind are more disposed to suffer, While evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when
a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to re-
duce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right,
it is their duty, to throw oﬂf‘ such Government and
to provide new Guards for their future security.
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Col-
onies; and such is now the necessity which con-
strains them to alter their former Systems of Gov-
ernment. The history of the present King of Great
Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpa-
tions, all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove
this, let Facts. be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most
wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws
of immediate and pressing importance, unless sus-
pended in their operation till his Assent should
be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly
neglected to attend to them. c

He has refused to pass other Laws for the ac-
commodation of large districts of people, unless
those people would relinquish the right of Repre-
sentation in the Legislature, a. right inestimable
to them and formidable to tyrants only. ’

He has called together legislative bodies at
places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from

- the depository of their public Records, for the sole

purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeated-

fly, for opposing with manly ﬁrmness his invasions on

the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time,‘after such dis-

He has constrained our fellow-Citizens taken _ "

He has excited domestic insurrection amongst

Our repeated petitions have been answered only ‘I

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our \
British brethren. We have warned them, from
time to time, of attempts by their legislature to _
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We k
have reminded them of the circumstances of our
emigration and settlement here. We have a,p— .
pealed to their native justice and magnanimity, ‘
and we have conjured them by the ties of our
common kindred to disavow these usurpations,

«which would inevitably interrupt our connections 2
and correspondence. They too have been deaf to »
the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, ‘ i
therefore, asquiesce in the necessity which denounces .
our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest 
of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United_

States of America, in General Congress assembled,

114 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE CONSTITUTION. _ /7
Historical Note from the Tribune Almanac; 
In May, 1785, a committee of Congress made a

report recommending an alteration in the Articlesj 

of Confederation, but no action was taken onit,‘

ceed in the matter. In January, 1786, the Legisla-

ture of Virginia passed a resolution providing for ,
. . ore. _

the appointment of ﬁve commissioners, who,
any three of them, should meet such commissionerjsi
as might be appointed‘ in the other States of the‘
Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, totake
into consideration the trade of the United Statesf to,
consider how far a uniform system in their com-
mercial regulations might be necessary to their
common interest and their permanent harmony, and
to report to the several States such an act’, relative

A’ to this object, as, when ratiﬁed by them, would

enable the United States in Congress effectually ‘to
provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners,
after some correspondence, ﬁxed the ﬁrst Monday in
September as the time and the city of Annapolis as
the place for the meeting, but only four other States
were represented-—Delaware, New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania. Commissioners appointed by
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and
North Carolina failed to attend.

Under the circumstances of so partial a repre-
sentation, the commissioners present agreed upon a
report (drawn by Alexander Hamilton, of New York),
expressing their unanimous conviction that it might
essentially tend to advance the interests of the

Union if the States by which they were respectively - A

delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to
procure the concurrence of the other States, in the
appointment of commissioners to meet in Philadel-
phia on the second Monday .of May following, to
take into consideration the situation of the United
States, to devise such further provisions as should
appear to them necessary to render the Constitution
of the Federal Government adequate to the exigen-
cies of the Union, and to report such an act for that.
purposetto the United States in Congress assembled
as, when agreed to by them and afterward conﬁrmed
by the Legislatures of the States, would effectually
provide ‘for the same.

The Philadelphia Convention.

Congress, on February 21, 1787, adopted a reso-
lution in favor of a convention, and the Legislatures
of those States. which ‘ had not already done’ so

, ,.,

and it was left to the State.Legislatures to pro-ed.

‘delegates. /On May 25, seven States having convened,
*George Washington, of Virginia, was elected Presi-
_ dent ‘of the convention, and the consideration of the
proposed Constitution was begun. ‘On September

17, 1787, the Constitution, as engrossed and agreed

 upon, was. signed by all the memberspresent, except
M’r. Gerry, of Massachusetts, and Messrs. Mason and

Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the conven-

'tion transmitted the document to Congress, with a

resolution stating how the proposed Federal Gov—
ernment should be put in operation. Congress, on
September 28, 1787, directed the Constitution, with
the resolution concerning the same, “to be trans-
mitted to the several Legislatures in order to be
submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in
each State by the people thereof, in conformity to
the resolves of the convention.”

On March 4, 1789, the day which had been ﬁxed
for commencing the operations of government
under thepnew Constitution, it had been ratiﬁed by
conventions chosen in the various States to con-
sider it, as follows:

Delaware, December 7, 1787.

Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787.

New Jersey, December‘18, 1787.

The President informed Congress on January 28,
1790, that North Carolina had ratiﬁed the Constitu-
tion on November 21, 1789, and he informed Con-
gress on June 1, 1790, that Rhode Island had
ratiﬁed the Constitution on May 29, 1790. Vermont
in convention ratiﬁed the Constitution on January
10, 1790, and was, by anact of Congress approved
on February 19, 1791, “received and admitted into
this Union as a new and entire member of the
United States.” ’

The Possessions.

A government for Porto Rico was established
by the Fifty-sixth Congress. By a law passed Aug.
16, 1916, a new form of government, with a large
measure of home rule, was established in the Philip-

pines, supplanting the previous provisional gov-

ernment. Guam_and Tutuila are each under a Gov-
ernor, as is also the Isthmian Canal Zone, all ap-

pointed by the President. Porto Rico is represented.

in- the Congress of the United States by a Commis-
sioner, and the Philippines by two Commissioners
elected respectively by the people thereof.

ORIGIN OF “UNCLE SAM.”
A correspondent of the New York Times writ

that “after the declaration of war with England in .

1812, Elbert Anderson of New York, then a con-
tractor, visited Troy, where he purchased a quan-
tity of provisions. The inspectors of the articles
were Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson. The latter
gentleman, universally known as ‘Uncle’ Sam,
generally superintended in person a large number
of workmen, who on this occasion were employed
in overhauling the provisions purchased by the
contractor. The casks were marked E. A.———U. S.
Their inspection fell to the lot of a facetious fel-
low who, on being asked the meaning of the mark,
said he did not know, unless it meant Elbert Ander-
son and Uncle Sam,'meaning Uncle Sam Wilson. The
joke gave rise to the nickname.” ,

SOCIALIST WOMAN SCHOOL BOARD P/RESIDENT.

Mrs. Meta L. Berger, wife of Ex—Congressman
Victor L. Berger, who was elected to the presidency
of the Milwaukee school board, in July, 1915, is the
first Socialist and the first woman to be chosen for
that responsible position in any large American city.

In acquiring Hawaii the Government made no
payment, but assumed a public debt of $4,000,000.
The sum of $20,000,000 was paid to Spain for the

‘ territory ceded by the treaty of December 10, 1898,.

and the sum of $100,000 for some additional islands:
in the Philippine group ceded by the treaty of
November 7, 1900. The payment to the Panama Re-
public is exclusive of an annual payment of $250,000
which began on February 26, 1913. The ten-mile
strip along the canal does not become an absolute
possession of the United Statesgbut an area over
which the Government exercises “a perpetual right
of occupation, use and control.”

PUBLIC DEBT‘.
From a Special Bulletin of the Census, 1915

The following table gives the total and per capita-

net_ indebtedness of the nation, the States and the
various minor divisions (counties, cities and dis--
tricts) for the three years 1890, 1902 and 1913. This‘-
indebtedness is computed less sinking fund assets:
or funds available for payment. It will be seen
that the net indebtedness of the nation increased
by $117,544,489, or 13.8 per cent. from 1890 to 1902,
and by $59,106,814,_ or 6.1 per cent. from 1902 to
1913r The per capita debt, however, owing to the
increase of populatiqn, decreased. The increase of

NEW YORK’S PROCREATION COMMISSION.
The Procreation Commission of New York State,

created by an act of the Legislature, is to examine

into the mental and physical condition and the

record and family history of the feeble-minded,”

epileptic criminal and other defective inmates con-
ﬁned in the State hospitals, reformatories, charitable
and penal intitutions; and if in the judgment of
the majority of the board procreation by any such
person would produce children with an inherited
tendency to crime, insanity, feeble—mindedness,
idiocy, or imbecility, and there is no probability of
an improvement in their condition,’ then the board
shall appoint one of their number to perform such
operation for the prevention of procreation that
shall be decided to be most effective. All orders
made, under this law are subject to review by the
Supreme Court. The board consists of three mem-
bers (all physicians) appointed by the Governor.

SEDGWICK ON CONFISCATION.

If the brief and sweeping clause, “Private prop-
erty shall not be taken for public use without‘ just

. compensation,” be made to express themodiﬁcations

and qualiﬁcations in it and, addedto it, it will stand
nearly as follows: _e a A 4‘ _ _ . ‘
“Private property shallin no case be taken for
private use. Private property may be taken for
public use in the exercise of the general police

‘powers of the state or of taxation without making

compensation therefor.”—Froin Dilloii’s Com-
mentaries on the Law of Municipal Corporations,

LINCOLN ON SLAVERY.
Speech to an Indiana regiment, March 17," 1865.
I have always thought that all men should be
free; but if any should be slaves it should be first
those who desire it for themselves, and secondly,
those who desire it for others. Whenever I hear
anyone arguing for slavery I feel a strong im-
pulse to see it tried on him personally.

POTENTIAL SOLDIERS. 1916.
A Census Bureau table issued on July 3, 1916, es-

timated the number of able-bodied men of military
:.age in the United States as about 21,000,000.

The estimate is based on the assumption that
there has been an increase of 10 per cent. in the
population since 1910, when the total male popula-

-tion over 18 years and under 46 was 19,183,000, Of
this number 14,224,000 were native whites, 2,857,000
*were foreign—born whites who had become natural-

ized, 3,052,000 were Negroes and 50,000 Indians.

THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY}

From shortly after the close of the Civil War
until the outbreak of the war with Spa-in, in 1898,

the strength of the regular army remained at "about. '
120,000 men. By the acts of March 8 and April 26,

1898, the army was increased to a maximum of’
65,000‘,'and by the end of August of that year it«
had been recruited up to a total of 58,688. By the:
act o_f February 2, 1901, supplemented by the acts:
of January 25, 1907, and April 23, 1908, the strength:
of the army was ﬁxed at a maximum of 100,-000 and?
a minimum of 57,000. During the year 1901 it
was recruited to a strength of 81,107, exclusive of

5,100 Philippine scouts and 897 Porto Rican scouts.-

The actual strength from that time to 1916 fluctu-
ated between about 58,000 and 95,000, exclusive of
approximately six thousand in the Philippine and
Porto Rican service. '

Dicxgifiiffrh-1?§'EAw.

'The Dick military law was approved by Theodore T

Roosevelt, president, September 26, 1903. Some of
its provisions, it is true, have been in force since
1793, but in its latest form it is greatly ampliﬁed
and “strengthened.” It provides “that the militia
shall consist of every able-bodied male citizen of
the respective States, Territories and the District of
Columbia, and every able-bodied male of foreign
birth who has declared his intention to become a
citizen, who is more than eighteen and less than
forty-ﬁve years of age.” The militia is “divided
into two classes—-—the organized militia, to be known
as the ~National Guard of the State, Territory or
District of Columbia, or by such other designations
as may be given them *-by the laws of the respective

States or Territories, and the remainder to bev

known as the reserve militia.” It will be seen that
all able-bodied male citizens are subject ‘to call,
and all members of the State militia are made
members of the National Militia. The law further
provides that “any officer or enlisted man of the
militia who shall refuse or mglect to present him-
self to such mustering officer upon being called
as herein prescribed shall be subject to court-
martial, and shall be punished as such court-
martial may “direct.” This is the substitution of‘
military for civil rule and military for civil courts,

_at'the option of the president. TA man who refuses
to appear to break a strike may be tried by the

army and shot for his refusal, tried by a court,
“composed of military officers only.” The Secretary;

  

 

  

150 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

 

of War is empowered to arm and equip all soldiers
who may at any time be. called into the ﬁeld, and
“the necessary money’ (to do the work) is hereby
appropriated out of the moneys of the treasury.”
It will not require a special bill to equip and sup-
ply this great army when the time comes; the
appropriation is already made. The law also pro-

.vides for army officers to drill State militia when

 

 

desired and even to military schools and colleges.

DRAFT SECTION IN THE ARMY ACT.

The Hay-Chamberlain army bill was signed by
the President on June 3, 1916. On August 25th
Representative George Huddleston of Alabama in-
troduced a resolution to repeal the section of the
bill which provides for conscription. The section
is as follows:

"‘If for any reason there shall not be enough vol-
untary enlistments to keep the reserve battalions
at the prescribed strength, a sufficient number of
the unorganized militia shall be drafted into the
service of the United States to maintain each of such
battalions at the proper strength.” ,

Huddleston declared that the word “called” had
been in the’ earlier draft of the bill, but that on
March 22d it had been changed in secret confer-
ence to “drafted.” On the following day (March
23d) the matter had been brought up by Represen-
tative Miller of Minnesota, who asked if the word
“ordered” could not be substituted. Representative
Hay, of Virginia, the sponsor for the bill, there-
upon declared that the word “ordered” did not have
the legal signiﬁcance of the word “drafted.” On
Miller’s further question if the word “called” might
not be substituted, Hay replied that the same objec-
tion held. “He (the president)”, said Hay, “may
call Volunteers into the service of the United States,
but this language is necessary in order that they
may cease to be militia.”

On the day (August 25th) when Huddleston intro-
duced his repeal resolution, Hay again took the
ﬂoor. In -reply to Huddleston’s charges, he said:

“He (Huddleston) bases his criticism on the fact
that the word ‘call’ was stricken out and the word
‘draft’ substituted in conference. I do not now
recollect whether that is true or not, but what is
the difference between the President being author-
ized to call men out and to draft them? There is
no difference, so far as the President is concerned.”
Huddleston’s resolution was defeated.

  

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 151

PETTY GRAFT BY CONGRESS.

The House of Representatives ,pays to the tele-
graph companies, at the Government rate, for
messages sent by’ members of Congress, in the
neighborhood of $20,000 a year. This payment is
made from the appropriation for contingent ex-
penses of the House, and is abolutely illegal, as
there is no warrant of law for the use of any part
of this appropriation (nor of any other appropria-
'tion) for such a purpose. Many of the telegrams
which are thus paid for out of the public funds
are on purely private business of Congressmen.
One member’s telegraph bill for a month was $250.
Another member sent a single message upon which
the charge at the Government rate was $60.—(From
debate on urgent deﬁciency bill, Congressional
Record, May 24, 1912.)

The most despicable of all the grafts practiced by
Senfatorsthand Representatives is thzlzat of sttjealing a
par o_ 611‘ secre aries sa aries. very ongress-
man‘receives $1,500 yearly in excess of his salary ts
pay for a “clerk” or secretary. Perhaps one-thir
of them, however, withhold some part of this sum
for their own uses. Sometimes two or thr‘ee_of
th%m1fcombintei1_to1em§loy ﬁn: secaetary, eaclg paying
a a or a ir an poc e mg e remain er.

Sometimes the Congressman forces his secretary
to divide the salary with the statesman’s son or
nephew. In one way or another the graft is pinched
from a hard-working employe Whose salary is ﬁxed
by Uncle Sam, but who 1S unable to claim it be-
cause the money goes ﬁrst to his employer.

THE REGISTRATION AREA.

The term “registration area,” which is frequently
found in statistical matter, means that part of the
United States in which the laws requiring the
registration of births and deaths are sufficiently
comprehensive and rigorous to insure approxi-
mately correct ﬁgures. It consists of California,
Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, In-
diana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah,
Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, the municipalities
of 1,000 and more population in North Carolina, and
43 cities in non-registration States. It contained, on
July 1, 1910, 53,843,896 population. or 58.3 per cent.
of the total for the United States.

152 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

LEGISLATION OF RECENT CONGRESS.

The ﬁrst session of the Sixty-fourth Congress,
which began on Dec. 6, 1915, and ended on Sept. 8,
1916, enacted a greater number of social and indus-
trial laws than any previous session. Among the
more important enactments were the following:

Railroad Eight-Hour Day L-aw.———Establishing

154 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE ADAMSON ACT.

The eight-hour law for railway trainmen, known

as the Adamson Act, was approved by the President
/on Sept. 3 (and again on Sept. 5, the former date
falling on a Sunday), 1916. It is in four sections.

The ﬁrst section declares that after Jan. 1, 1917, ’

eight hours shall be deemed a day’s work for the
purpose of reckoning compensation for all employes
engaged in train operation on all interstate railroads
(electric street and inter-urban railroads are ex-
cepted), including switching and terminal companies.

The second section provides that the President
shall appoint a commission of three to observe the
operation and effects of the law during a period of
not less than six months nor more than nine months,
and to report within thirty days thereafter to the
President and Congress. A sum of $25,000 is appro-

priated for expenses.
‘ The third section forbids, during the maximum ‘

time mentioned above, the reduction of the wages of
the employes below the present standard, and or-
dains the payment of overtime at regular rates.

The fourth section provides for a ﬁne of not less
than $100 nor more than $1,000, or‘ imprisonment
or both, for violations. .,

The commissioners appointed were Major-General
George W‘. Goethals, Elmer E. Clark, of the Inter-
state Commerce Commission, and George Rublee, of
the Trade Commission. :

NEW FEDERAL COMPENSATION LAW.

The Federal Compensation law, superseding the
law of 1908, was signed by the President Sept. 7,
1916. The bill was prepared by the collaboration
of the American Association for Labor Legislation
and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
It extends the provisions of the former act to all
employes of the United States suffering injuries
while in the performance of their duties. It pro-

vides for beneﬁts on a basis of two-thirds of the .

injured employe’s. wages, payments continuing as

long as the disability lasts. Partial disability is ’

compensated on the basis of the wage loss resulting
from the injury. Death beneﬁts to a widow cease
only on her death or remarriage and to children on
their attaining the age of 18, though they may con-
tinue’beyond this date if incapacitated from earning
a living. Other beneﬁciaries are to be provided for
in the absence of the foregoing or subject to their
prior rights.

The maximum beneﬁt payable under the law dur-

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 155

ing total disability is $66.67 per month; the minimum
$33.33. Reasonable medical, surgical and hospital
services are to be furnished in all cases, but no
compensation is to be paid for the first three days
of disability.

A provision including occupational and i.ndustrial
diseases was stricken out during the debate. It was
said on the ﬂoor of the house, however, that laws
of similar phraseology had been construed to include
occupational diseases. . 7

A commiss-ion of three persons, one to be ap-
pointed for two years, one for four years and one
for six years, and thereafter all to be appointed for

six years, is provided for the administration of the ’

act. .

each of ten years for the development of rural roads

\in the national forests.

From the Congressional Directory.

The Capitol is situated in latitude‘ 38° 53’ 20.4"
north and longitude 77° 00' 35.7" west from Green-
wich., It fronts east and stands on a plateau 88
feet above the level of the Potomac.-.

0 Original Building.

The southeast corner stone of the original build-
ing was laid on the 18th of September, 1793, by
President Washington, with Masonic ceremonies.
It is constructed of sandstone from quarries on
Aquia Creek, Va. The original designs were pre-

ared by Dr. William Thornton, and the work was
done under the direction of Stephen H. Hallet,
James Hoban, George Hadﬁeld and B. H. Latrobe,
architects. The north wing was_ﬁnished in 1800
and the south wing in 1811. A wooden passageway
connected them. On the 24th of August, 1814, the
interior of both wings was destroyed by ﬁre, set by
the British. The damage to the building was im-
mediately repaired. In 1818 the central portion of
the building was commenced, under the architec-
tural superintendence ‘of Charles Bulﬁnch. The
original building was ﬁnally completed in 1827. Its
cost, including the grading of the grounds, altera-
tions and repairs, up to 1827, was $2,433,844.13.

Extensions.

The corner stone of the extensions was laid on the
4th of July, 1851, by President Filmore, Daniel
Webster officiating as orator. This work was
prosecuted under the architectural direction of
Thomas U. Walter till 1865, when he resigned, and
it was completed under the supervision of Edward
Clark; The material used in the walls is white
marble from the quarries at Lee, Mass., and that in
the columns from the quarries at Cockeysville, Md.
The House extension was ﬁrst occupied for legis-
lative purposes December 16, 1857, and the Senate
January 4, 1859.

The value of the Capitol building and grounds,
October 14, 1911, was as follows: Building, $15,000,-
000; grounds, $10,400,000; total, $25,400,000.

Dimensions of the Building.

The entire length of the building from north to
south is 751 feet 4 inches, and its greatest dimen-
sion from east to west 350 feet. The area covered
by the building is 153,112 square feet.

The dome is crowned by a bronze statue of Free-
dom, which is 19 feet 6 inches high and weighs
12,985 pounds. It was modeled by Crawford. The
height of the dome above the base line of the east

AGAINST JUDICIAL USURPATION.

In the United States Senate, on January 8, 1917,
Senator Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma, introduced a

--joint resolution forbidding Federal judges to declare

any act of Congress unconstitutional on penalty of
removal from office.

A similar proposition, though relating only to a

speciﬁc measure, was included by Representative
Victor L. Berger, in 1911, in his Old Age Pensions
bill. The section read:
‘ “Section 11. That in accord with paragraph two,
section two, Article III of the Constitution, and of
the precedent established by the act passed over the
President's veto March 27, 1868, the exercise of juris-
diction by any ofthe Federal courts upon the valid-
ity of this act is hereby expressly forbidden.”

1’ INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION.

The Federal Commission on Industrial Relations
was created by an act of Congress approved August
23, 1913. Its duties were to inquire into the general
condition of labor, including agriculture; existing
relations between employers and employes; methods
of avoiding and adjusting labor disputes and a Wide
range of related matters. It held public hearings
in many of the larger cities. Three voluminous re-
ports, including several supplemental reports, were
made public in August, 1915. The Commission ad-
journed sine die August 23, 1915.

The members of the commission, whose nomina-
tion was conﬁrmed by the Senate Sept. 10, 1913.
were as follows:

Representing the public:
Frank P. Walsh, Chairman, Kansas City.
Prof. John R. Commons, Madison, Wis.
Florence J. Harriman, New York City.

Representing the employers:
Frederick A. Delano, Chicago (succeeded by
Richard H. Aishton, Chicago, March 17,‘ 1915).

The members were paid $10 a day and traveling
and other necessary expenses while actually en-
gaged on the work of the commission and while
going and returning from such work.

CHILDREN-’S BUREAU.

The Federal Children’s Bureau was created by the
act of April 9, 1912, to investigate and-report upon
all-matters relating to the welfare of children. The

162 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE SMITHSONIAN AND NRTIONAL MUSEUM.
From the Congressional Directory.
The Smithsonian Institution.

The Smithsonian Institution Was created by Act
of Congress in 1846, under the terms of the will of
James. Smithson, an Englishman, who in 1826 be-
queathed_his fortune to the United States to found,
at Washington, under the name of the “Smith-

-sonian Institution,” an establishment for the “in—

crease and diffusion of knowledge among men.”
The institution is legally an establishment, having as
its members the President of the United States,
the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the
President’s Cabinet. It is governed by a board of
regents consisting of the Vice-President, the Chief
Justice, three members of the United States Sen-
ate, three members of the House of Representa-
tives, and six citizens of the United States appointed
by joint resolution of Congress. The secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution is its executive officer
and the director of its activities.

Through the Hodgkins fund, the income of
$100,000 of Which_ is for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge in regard to the nature and properties
of atmospheric air in connection with the welfare
of man, grants have been made, publications issued,
and medals and prizes awarded.

\ ' On May 1, 1913, the Langley Aerodynamical Lab—]
oratory was reopened. The objects of this labora-

tory will be the co-ordination of its activities with
the kindred labors of other establishments; to plan
investigations for increasing the safety and ef-
‘fectiveness of aerial locomotion; and to collect
aeronautical information and publish such part of
the) same as appears to be of. value to the Govern-
ment or the public.

The Institution, in co—operation with the Library

[of Congress, maintains a scientiﬁc library which

numbers 260,000 volumes, consisting mainly of the
transactions of learned societies and scientific
periodicals.

The National Museum.

The United States National Museum is the de-
pository of the national collections. It is especially
rich in the natural history of America, including
zoology, botany, geology, paleontology, archeology
and ethnology, and has extensive series relating to
the arts and industries, the ﬁne arts and American

history.

1:64 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

According to a report of the Census Bureau,
issued on June 12, 1914, there were, on February
1, 1913, sixty-nine cities with a population of 30,000
or more which had adopted the commission form of
government. These cities are:

Alabama—Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery.

California~—Berkeley, Oakland, Sacramento, San
Diego and Pasadena. 1 A

Colorado~C0l0r'ado Springs, Pueblo and Denver.

District of Columbia——Washington.

Illinois——Decatur and Springfield.

Towa———Cedar Rapids, Des Moines and Sioux City.

Kansas——Kansas City, Topeka and Wichita.

Jersey City.

Oklahoma——Muskogee and Oklahoma City.

Pennsylvania——Allentown, Altoona, Chester, Erie,
Harrisburg, Johnstown, Lancaster, McKeesport, New
Castle, Reading, Wilkes-Barre, Williamsport, York.

Washington First Commission City.

The term “commission form of government” re-
fers to the government of cities administered by a
small number of officials exercising both legisla-
tive and executive authority. This system of gov—
ernment has been given many distinctive forms in
individual cities, and these forms are frequently

spoken of by such designations as the “Galveston”

plan” or the “Des Moines plan.”

Washington, D. C., was the first city in the
United States to be governed for any number of
years by a commission, coming» under that form"
of government by an Act of Congress that became

effective June 11, 1878. The application of this
form of government to the capital of the United
States grew out of the relation of the national
government to this‘ particular city, and the city of

Washington was not considered as an example to /

other municipalities with reference to its form of
government.

The Experiment of Memphis, Tenn.

-The great need of improvement in sanitary con-
ditions of Memphis, Tenn., following a severe visi-
tation of yellow fever in 1878, combined with the
fact that at the time the city had incurred an in-
debtedness equal to its authority for borrowing

~money, led the legislature of Tennessee in 1879 to

put an end to the existence of the city as a
municipal corporation and to create in its stead a
taxing district whose affairs were conducted by a
small body of officers having practically the author-
ity of the commissioners in the cities under the new
or commission form of government. , After the re-
covery of the city from the difficulties which made
this form of government necessary, Memphis was

reincorporated as a city, with its" earlier form of.

government, and its experience was not deemed such
as to encourage this form of government for that
of mayor and council.

Galveston Adopts System, 1901.

A destructive storm having overwhelmed Gal-
veston, Tex., on September 1, 1900, and left the city
prostrate ﬁnancially, as Memphis had been in 1878,
Galveston was placed under a government by a
commission in 1901. The experience of Galveston
under this form of government was such that in
1905 it was adopted by Houston, Tex. Two other
cities, having 30,000 inhabitants, adopted it in 1907,
two in 1908. eight in 1909, six in 1910, ﬁfteen in 1911,
nine in 1912, twenty—one in 1913, and three in 1914.

The City Manager Plan.

An Act of the Ohio Legislature, approved May 6,
1913, provided for a form of municipal government
to be known as the “city manager p‘an,” the coun-
cil to consist of ﬁve members in cities of less than
10,000 inhabitants. of seven members in cities of
from 10,000 to 25,000 inhabitants. and o 9 nine mem-
bers in cities having over 25,000 inhabitants, the
council being elected in all cases for a term of
four years. This council is to constitute a gov-
erning body with power to pass ordinances, adopt

FEDERAL BOARD  CONCILIATION.
From the Congressional Directory.

The United States Board of Mediation and Con-
ciliation was created by an Act of Congress ap-
proved July 15, 1913. The purpose for which the
board was established is to settle by mediation,
conciliation and arbitration controversies concern-
ing wages, hours of labor or conditions of employ-
ment that may arise between common carriers en-
gaged in interstate transportation and their em-
ployees engaged in train operation or train service.

In any case where an interruption of traffic is
imminent and fraught with serious detriment to
the public interest, the Board of Mediation and Con-
ciliation may, if in its judgment such action seem
desirable, proﬂ"er its services to the respective
parties to the controversy.

Whenever a controversy concerning wages, hours
of labor or conditions of employment arises be-

tween such railroads and such employees, interrupt— a

ing or threatening to interrupt the operation of

,.trains to the serious detriment of the public inter-

est, upon the request of either party the Board
of Mediation’ is required to use its best efforts, by
mediation and conciliation, to bring about an agree-
ment. If such efforts to bring about an amicable
adjustment through mediation and conciliation are
unsuccessful, the board endeavors to induce the
parties to submit their controversy to arbitration
and, if successful, makes the necessary arrange-
ments for such arbitration.

(The members of the board are Martin A. Knapp, I

William L. Chambers .and G. W. W. Hanger.)

In addition,_in the -six suﬁrage States where:
women voted _1n 1912 there were, in 1910, 1,346,925»
women of voting age. The grand total is 25,704,439“.

From these numbers should ﬁrst be eliminated:
3,612,700 unnaturalized foreign—born whites, vir-—
tually all of the Chinese, Japanese and “others”
(no Chinese have been naturalized since 1882), and.
perhaps two-thirds of the Indians (those untaxed
and living in tribal relations). The remainder is.
23,224,676. Probably 5 per cent. should be added:
for natural increase between the time of taking the ,
census in 1.910 and election time, 1912. The total
would be 24,385,909. - -

Less than 62 per cent. of these persons cast their
ballots. It is an interesting; speculation as to what,
happened to the other 38 per cent. of the natio»na’s:

‘potential voters. Data on the subject are too» I
meagre to furnish a complete answer, but eno.ug_-lit J
is known to warrant some more or less approxi-
mate guesses.

In the first place, most of the Negro vote may
be omitted from consideration. Eighty—ﬁve per’
cent. of the Negroes of Voting age live south of
Mason and Dixo'n’s line, where their votes are a
negligible quantity. It is not likely that more than
400,000 Negroes in the nation voted in 1912.

It is likely, moreover, that 40 per cent. of the
Women entitled to vote failed to do so.

But what became of the white men’s votes?
There are several answers.

The ﬁgures show that in a considerable part of
the South the average white man does not vote.
The franchise is restricted by poll and other taxes,
and the poor man keeps his money (if he has any)»
and stays at home. A comparison of the vote

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 169

for presidential electors in 1912- with the 1910 cen-
-sus of native white males of voting age shows,
for certain ~Soutl»*1er’n States, the following‘ results:

‘States. of vote cast.
‘South Carolina. .. -.  .. .  . . . . ......* . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 31.00

-‘Mississippi. . i.  ». V.  -. . .  . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34.44

'il'exas. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41.49

Probably not more t_'han.EO ‘per cent. of the native
white males of "the South exercise the franchise.
?In most of the South thevnumber of foreigners is
‘too inconsiderable topbe ‘a factor in the problem. In
.‘South Carolina, for i'nsta‘nce, there were but 3,355
‘foreign-born males ‘of voting: age, as against 162,414
natives. _ ,

But the South is not the only section which
‘shows a disparity, between the number. of votes
and the number of males of Voting age. Even in‘
‘Indiana, where law and custom combine in the
‘effort to \“get out the vote,” and where the num-
ber of foreign-born males is relatively small. the

- proportion ‘of Voters to males of voting‘ age was in

1912 but 84.72 per cent. _
ilndifference, “disgust with politics,” anarcliistic
or “direct action” sentiments will accountfor some
of this disparity, but probably only a_ small degree.
Illness is a much greater factojr. If the estimate
-“made by Prof. Irving Fisher of 3,000,000 persons
"‘on the sick list” at any particular time is correct.
it may well be that on election day 500,000 are
too ill to go to the polls. But it is the mass of
«definite restrictions upon the suffrage that 'ac-
counts for far the greater part of the disparity
between votes and number of voters.

Every one of the States has some statutory
restrictions. Some of these restrictions are, of

course, necessary. The exclusion of mental defec-.

tives is usual. Other restrictions affect in only
the slightest degree the number of voters; duelists
are excluded in Florida, election bettors in New
York and persons “lacking the approbation of the
local board of civil authority” in Vermont. Other
restrictions are more questionable, if not wholly
unwarranted, and greatly curtail the suffrage. A

number of States exclude paupers, and seven or-,

eight States exclude United States soldiers, sailors
and marines._ Both Massachusetts and Wyoming‘
have a partial literacy test. Louisiana excludes
indicted persons.

Most of the States, moreover. deny the Suffrage’

to convicts who have not been pardoned. The
number of these must be very large. In one year
(1910) there were approximately 450,000 persons
released from prison.

All" of.these restrictions reduce the vote. But
none of them, and perhaps not all of them, together,
exercise the restriction upon the suffrage that
is imposed by the various residence qualiﬁcations.
Americans of all classes in the North and, West
are comparatively a migratory people. Even those
who hold their residence in a particular spot
travel extensively. Business men, professional men,

 

drummers, promoters, civil engineers-—hundreds-

of thousands of them—some of them occasionally
and some of them constantly, are moving about
from place to place. The largest part of this
moving army is, of course, composed of workingmen
looking for jobs or working away from home. ‘

Taking into account all the factors mentioned .

above and giving to each a conjectural number, it
seems probable that at every general election not
less than 3,000,000 voters lose their chance to vote
by reason of their absence from their home pre-
cincts. Of this number not less than 70 per cent.,
or 2,100,000, are wage-«earners. '

DEMOCRACY i{§17—1‘i1E POOR MAN.

Democracy in the South doesn’t want the poor
man to vote. So it surrounds the ballot box with
certain “safeguards” against proletarian interfer-
ence. The following restrictions on the suffrage
will illustrate the system:

LOUISIANA~——Poll tax must be.paid to date by
December 31 of each year for two years preceding
the year in which the citizen offers to vote. So
that if he had wanted to vote for President in 1912,

_he would have had to make up his mind to that

effect in December, 1910, to have then paid his poll

‘tax, and again have paid the tax before December

31, 1911. He must also have resided in the State

a for two years.

TEXAS~—Unless he belongs to the exempt class,
he must have paid his ‘poll tax (high one, too)
in the spring preceding the election.

MISSISSIPPI——-He must have paid his tax and
must also have lived in the State two years and
(unless he happens to be a clergyman) in the
precinct one year. ’

GEORGIA—He must have paid all his—_taxes sine

901377.

up

 

ARSENAL or FACTS, 1917. 171

—sofJTH CAROLINA—He must have resided two

‘years, paid his poll tax six months before election,

4

and all taxes of the previous year on property
assessed at $300 or more.

VIRGINIA———The would-be voter must have paid
his tax for the preceding .three years at least six
months before election.

\

NEED OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.

‘ The total vote for Presidential electors, in 1912, i

was 15,052,507 Approximately the same vote was
cast in the elections that year for members of the
House of Representatives. On the trength of their
share of that vote the Socialists should have had
26 representatives. As a matter of fact they had

none. The vote, with the representation earned and
the representation obtained, is as follows:

AUTOMOBILES AND WHAT THEY PAY.

There were 2,445,664 motor vehicles registered in
the various States during the year 1915, and a total
of $18,245,713 was paid by automobilists for regis-
trations and drivers’ and dealers’ licenses. The in-
crease over 1914 was 734,325 in the number of
vehicles and $5,863,760 in fees.
number of cars are only approximate, since some
of the States do not require annual registration,
others do not require registration of motor cycles,
and still others group pleasure and commercial cars
and motor cycles together. In,1906 there were but
48,000 cars registered in the whole country.

In 42 of the States all orthe major portion of the
motor-vehicle tax is expended for the construction,
improvement or maintenance of the public roads or

. for the maintenance of the State Highway Depart-

ment. Revenue from\ this source now defrays 7
per cent. of the money spent on (rural road and
bridge building.

.' I76 ' THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND _

LOW BIRTH RATE’ AMONG COLLEGE GRADUATES. ‘'1,

In a statement published in August, 1915, Ros-
well H. Johnson, professor of biology of the Uni—
versity of Pittsburgh, gives the results of his
researches regarding the marriage and birth rate
among college Women. The investigations included
the marriage records of the alumnae of Wellesley,
Bryn Mawr, Smith, Vassar, Mount Holyoke and Wil-
son. The number of marriages among graduates of
these institutions was found to reach an average
of‘only 39 per cent. of the total.

Prof. Johnson ﬁnds that from all college girls
there is contributed to the race only four—fifths of
a child per capita, while among honor students per
capita the rate amounts to only one—fifth of a child.

“The number of children,” he says, “which are
necessary to maintain a stationary population 1
from these groups should be about 3.7 per woman ‘
student. Among the honor students only about 35
.per cent. marry, and from these only two-tenths of
a child is contributed for duplication of their kind.
There are three causes for this abnormal low birth
rate: First, lack of co-education; second, failure of
their education to make them desirous of having
a home of their own, and third, the excessive limita-
tion of students’ opportunities for social life.”

INVALIDITY OF “GRANDFATHER CLAUSE.”
The decision of the United States Supreme Court

on June 22, 1915, declaring unconstitutional an‘

Oklahoma constitution_al amendment and an .An-
napolis (Md.) voters’ qualiﬁcation ordinance, both
of which discriminated against Negro suffrage,
would seem by implication to annul the “grand-
father clause” in various Southern State constitu-
tions.‘ The decision upheld the conviction of two
Oklahoma election officials Who denied Negroes the
right to vote in a Congressional election and
awarded three Maryland Negroes damages from
election officials in Annapolis who refused to regis-
ter them. - .

The decision was unanimous and was read by

the Chief Justice, a native of the South andia:

former Confederate soldier. The court held that
these restrictions were directly in violation of the
Fifteenth Amendment. In ﬁxing a literary standard
and then granting suffrage to illiterates who them-
selves, or whose ancestors, were entitled to vote
on January 1, 1866, the Oklahoma amendment, ac-

cording to the decision, attempted to circumvent

the plain provisions of: the Federal amendment.
The Annapolis ordinance made a like discrimina-
tion. “Certainly,” reads the decision, “it cannot be
said that there was any peculiar necromancy in
the time named which engendered attributes af-
fecting the qualiﬁcation to vote which could not
exist at another and different period unless the
Fifteenth Amendment was in view.” It was the
ﬁrst time that the “grandfather clause” or any of
its variants had come before the Supreme Court.‘

BLACKSTONE ON I—N—HERITANCE.

There is no foundation in nature or in natural
law, why a set of words upon parchment should
convey the dominion of land; Why the son ‘should
have a right to exclude his fellow creatures from

a determinate spot of ground because his father,

had done so before him, or why the occupier of a
particular ﬁeld or of a jewel, when lying on his

death bed and no longer able to maintain possession,

should be entitled to tell the rest of the world
which of fchem should enjoy it after him.——-Sir

ARSENAL OF FACTS, I917. 181

THE IMMIGRANT AND THE FARM.

_The fact that the overwhelming majority of
immigrants congregate in the cities and that only
a small part even of those who have been farm.
workers in Europe move to the farm districts of
the United States is treated by Prof. Jeremiah W.-
Jenks, in the following excerpts from an article-
syndicated by the National Editorial Service in the
summer of 1915:

Even immigrants with agricultural training, in-
stead of going to the great farming States of the
Union, persist in swelling our urban populations,

~in stagnating in our already congested cities and

in increasing thenumbers of out—of-works, thus.
making more acute sporadic conditions of unem-

. ployment in_ our industrial centers. Only 20,174, or

5 per cent., of the foreign—born males, 21 years of
ageand over, living in Massachusetts in 1910 were
to be found in the rural districts, notwithstanding
the fact that 12 per cent. of the total immigration
to that State from 1899 to 1910 were speciﬁcally
mentioned as farmers and farm laborers. In 1914
23,389 farmers and farm laborers were destined to
Massachusetts, but, judging from past ﬁgures, it is
extremely doubtful whether any appreciable portion
of these agriculturists will ever reach the country
districts. ‘

\ Slightly less than 100,000 immigrants, or only
about 8.3 per cent. out of a total immigration of
1,218,488 in 1914, "were headed towards the great
farming States .of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Texas, Wis-
consin and Wyoming, while the four great indus-
trial States, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
and Illinois, shared between them the enormous
number of 700,000, or nearly 60 per cent. of the
total immigration to this country in that year. Of

the 13,515,886 foreign-born found‘ in the United

States in 1910 these four States contained 6,454,944,
or 47 per cent., clear proof that our incoming im-
migrants add to our overcrowded cities and do not,
to any measureable extent, reach the farm. -

In 1890, 38.2 per cent. of our foreign-born were

’ to be found in rural districts; in 1900, 33.2 per cent.;

and.in 1910 the percentage had fallen to 27.8._ Only
223,731 more foreign-born were to be found in the
country districts in 1910 than in 1890,,while the num-
ber of foreign—born in the cities increased about
4,000,000 during the same period.

It would seem from these ﬁgures as if there was

still considerable work to be done in persuading
the already-arrived immigrant to take up farm life
without adding more trouble through increasing
our urban population by an annual inﬂux of over
a million.i

NATURALIZATION AND MILITARY LIABSILITY.
From the New York Times.

Following is a summary of the naturalization
laws of this country and of the statements made
by the United States Government in regard to the
military duty of aliens and foreign-born citizens.
For further details inquirers are referred to the
Naturalization Bureau regarding questions. of

naturalization, and to the State Department at’

Washington or the representatives of_their native
countries regarding information as to military lia-
bility in Europe.

The declaration of intention to be ﬁled by the
applicant for citizenship must contain the name,
age, occupation, time and place of arrival in the
United States, and show that it is the bona ﬁde
intention of the applicant to ‘become a citizen of
the United States and to renounce forever all
allegiance to any foreign State or sovereign. Aliens
of the age of 21 years and upward, who have been
honorably discharged from service in the armies
of the United States, regular or volunteer, or who
have served ﬁve consecutive years in the United
States Navy, or one enlistment in the United States
Marine Corps, may be admitted to citizenship with-
out ﬁling the declaration of intention. The wife
and minor children take the citizenship of the hus-
band and father, and if an alien dies after taking
out his declaration of intention, his widow and
children need not take out.a declaration of inten-
tion in‘ order to become citizens. Not less than
two years. after an alien has ﬁled his declaration
of intention, and after not less than ﬁve years’
continuous residence in the United States, he may
ﬁle a.petition for citizenship, provided he has lived
at least one year in the place wherein he applies.
This petition must contain not only his name, ad-
dress, and occupation, but the place and date of his
birth, the place from which he emigrated, and
the date of his arrival in the United States. If he
arrived after June 29, 1906, /he must secure a

certiﬁcate ‘showing date and place of his arrival

from the Department of Labor. The petition must
be veriﬁed by two reiiable witnesses, citizens of the
United States, who must state that they have known
the applicant during his entire
State, and that he has been during that time a man
If a
portion of the necessary ﬁve years has been passed
in some other State, the witness may verify so much
of the applicant’s residence as has been passed in
that State, not less than one year, and the portion
of the necessary ﬁve years which has been passed
outside the State may be shown by depositions at
the hearing of the petition. a

Aliens who have declared their intention of be-
coming citizens may“ vote at general elections,
after six months’ residence, in Arkansas, Indiana,
Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota; after one
year’s residence, in Missouri and Texas, and after
two years/’ residence, in Alabama.

The State Department issued a statement August
12, 1914, to the effect that it was “especially im-
portant” that naturalized American citizens should,
during the war, “refrain from visiting their coun-'
tries of origin or countries which are at war there~
with.” August 14 a further statement was issued
declaring as follows: “The United States is not a
party to any treaties under which persons of

,foreign origin residing in this country may be com-

pelled to return to their countries of origin for
military service, nor is there any way in which
persons may be forced into foreign armies against
their will so long as they remain in the United
States. The United States has concluded treaties
of naturalization with Austria—Hungary, Belgium,
Denmark, the German States, Great Britain, Nor-
way, and Sweden. "Copies of circulars concerning

‘the status in their native lands of naturalized citi-

zens of the United States, native of certain Euro-

‘ pean countries, will be furnished to interested per-

sons on request. It is important to observe that an
alien who declares his intention to become a
citizen of the United States does not, by his declara-
tion of intention, acquire the status of a citizen of.’
the United States.” Persons born in the United
States of American parents are American citizens
unless naturalized ascitizens of other countries.

CATHOLIC ON ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION.

/From “Socialism,” Promise or Menace,” by Hillquit
and Ryan (The Macmillan Co.), page 230. ‘

One of the best works in English in defense of
the economic interpretation of history comes from
the pen of a prominent and orthodox Catholic
priest. This scholarly book is entitled -‘‘History of.’

Economics, or Economics as a Factor in the Mak-1.

ing of History,” and its author is the Rev. J. A.
Dewe, late professor of the Catholic College of’
St. Thomas In St. Paul. It_is published by Ben—-

'ziger Brothers, “printers to the Holy Apostolic:

See,” and its ﬂy-leaf bears the indispensable “Nihil.
0bstat” of the Catholic book censor as well as the-
official Imprimatur of Archbishop, now Cardinal,
John M. Farley. '

‘The summary of the author’s economic and his-<

torical views, contained in his introduction, reads-.,

like a page from Frederick Engels. “It is evi—»
dent,” says the Reverend Dewe, “that economics.

'must have an almost unbounded inﬂuence on»,

human conduct, both public and private. For the-
great majority spend the greater part of their-
time either in’ producing or distributing wealth,
and, from the point of View of extension, the time»

\ that an ordinary man has to employ in earning his:

daily bread is greater than that which be can:
possibly expend in explicit acts of religion. ‘This:
al1—pervading activity of economics is still more-
apparent in the state or commonwealth. In the‘
W ol.e course of ancient and modern history there-
is scarcely any single important political event that.
has not been caused, either directly or indirectly_,,
by some economic inﬂuence. i
“Religion and physical causes, may, also have:
been present, but the economic factor seems to have:
been the most constant and tliie most pervasive.”

the whole people. In reply I would say: If you
cannot trust the members of the Legislature, how
can you trust their constituents from whom they
spring? " *

To give to the masses the right of annulling the
acts of the Legislature is to substitute mob law

«for established law.

To recall.a judge because his decisions do not
meet with popular approval is an insult to the
dignity, the independence, and" the self-respect of
our judiciary. Far less menacing to the common-
wealth is an occasional corrupt or incompetent
judge than one who would be the habitual slave of
a capricious multitude, who has always his ear to
the ground trying to ﬁnd out the verdict of the

people.

ABOLITION OF DEMOCRACY.

From the Staff Report of the Federal Industrial
Relations Commission, 1915.

The conditions existing in typical industrial com-
munities which are either wholly or in large part
owned or controlled by a single corporation or
individual employer, present every aspect of a
state of feudalism except the recognition of speciﬁc
duties on the part of the employer. The employees
in sue}; communities are dependent on a single
corporation, or employer, for their livelihood.
Furthermore, the employer in many cases controls

the social and political life of such communities, .

either by the complete absorption of local political
powers or by domination of the local authorities.

The fundamental rights of citizens in such com-
munities are, as a general rule, seriously abridged,
if not actually denied. Among the rights most
seriously violated are the right of free speech and
assemblage and the right of public highways.

In some cases, as for example in Colorado, em-
ployers in such communities have assumed to usurp
the functions of the Federal Government itself in

the issuance of money orders, and have not only ~

denied employees access to the postoffice when
located in their company stores but have opened and
otherwise interfered with the mail directed to the
employees.

Such feudalistic conditions tend to develop prin-
cipally in connection with the private exploitation
of natural resources, being most frequently found
in mining camps, lumber camps (including turpen-
tine camps) and large plantations. * ‘

THE SPREAD OF PROHIBITION.

Prohibition was adopted in 1914 in Arizona,
Colorado, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington, and in
1915 by Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa and South
Carolina. Other prohibition States are Kansas,
Maine, Oklahoma, Georgia, Mississippi, North Caro-
lina, Tennessee, W. Virginia and North Dakota.

The Alabama law, which was passed over the
governor’s veto, went into effect July 1, 1915. The
Florida law of the same year was vetoed. The South
Carolina law was adopted at the polls September
14, 1915, and became effective January 1, 1916. The
Idaho law is a statutory enactment. Iowa became

.virtually a prohibition State through the repeal of

the mulct law (1915).

Prohibition, in oneform or another, was an issue
in 1916 in thirteen States and one Territory.

In Alaska, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska and South
Dakota prohibition was adopted at the polls. In,
California two amendments, one providing for par-
tial prohibition in 1918 and the other absolute pro-
hibition in 1920, were defeated. In Florida a “dry”
Legislature was elected. In South Dakota a local
option, measure favored by the “wets” was defeated
at the polls. In Utah a “dry” governor was elected.
In Colorado an amendment liberalizing the present

I prohibition section of the constitution was defeated

at the polls. In Arkansas the voters defeated a
measure substituting a local option measure for the
present prohibition section of the constitution. In
Oregon the voters defeated the so-called “brewers’
bill” and adopted instead the so-called “bone-dry”
amendment to the constitution. In Maryland, unde-r
local option prohibition was enacted in'a number of
counties and cities but defeated in Baltimore. In
Illinois the issue was prominent in the election of
members of the Legislature.

;In 23 States there is now state-wide prohibition.

In States that have county option there are many

“dry” counties. Out of a total of 2,543 counties in
the nation, all but 355 are now said to be “dry.”
The oldest prohibition State is Maine, whose law
was enacted in 1851. Kansas came second in 1880
and North Dakota third in 1889.

‘WEBB-KENYON LAW UPHELD.

The United States Supreme Court on Jan. 8, 1917,
sustained the Webb-Kenyon law, forbidding the
shipment of liquor from “Wet” States into “dry”
States.

SOCIALISM.

DEFINITIONS OF SOCIALISM.

Standard Dictionary. .

“Socialism is a theory of civil polity that aims to
secure the reconstruction of society, increase of
wealth, and a more equal distribution of the prod-
ucts/ of labor, through the collective ownership of
land and capital, and the public collective manage-
ment of all industries. Its motto is everyone ac-
cording to his deeds.” (This same deﬁnition. word
for word, is given in the Standard Encyclopedia)’

Century Dictionary.

“Socialism is any theory or system of social or-
ganization which would abolish entirely, or in great
part, the individual effort and competition on which
modern society rests, and substitute for it co~
operative action; would introduce a more perfect
and equal distribution of the products of labor and
would make land and capital as the instruments and
means. of production, the joint possession of the
members of the community.”

rWebster’s International Dictionary. '

“Socialism: A theory or system of social reform
which contemplates a complete reconstruction of
society, with a more "just and equitable distribution
of property and labor. In popular usage, the term
is often employed to indicate any lawless, revolu-
tionary social schemes.”

Encyclopedia Britannica, Ninth Edition.

“Socialism has been, and still is, very frequently
associated with irreligion an'd atheism. The same
remark applies to continental liberalism, ‘and partly
‘for a like reason: the absolute governments ,of the
continent have taken the existing forms of religion

into their service and have repressed religious free— ~

dom. On religion, as on marriage, Socialism has no
special teaching.”
Encyclopedia Britannica, Eleventh Edition.
“Socialism is that policy or theory which aims
at securing by the action of the central democratic

authority a better distribution, and in due ‘sub- ’

ordination thereunto a better production of wealth
than now prevails.”
New International Encyclopedia.
“As the term is now used, Socialism is an ideal
economic, system in which industry is carried on

under social direction and for the beneﬁt of society
as a whole. It is contrasted with the competitive
regime of existing society.”

N elson’s Encyclopedia.

“The aim, then, of the dominant Socialism is to
gain political power in order to convert private
property in land and capital into collective prop—
erty and use it for the common good.” ‘

Johnson’s Universal Cyclopedia.

“Socialism is a moral reform; it is the vices of
mankind and the miseries resulting from these vices,
to which Socialism wishes to put an end, and it
seeks its means not in a new religious issue, but
in a new social organization.”

American Year-Book, Cyclopedia and Atlas.

“No w_ord has been more abused and misunder-
stood than the word ‘Socialist.’ The Socialist is not
an anarchist; the two are opposed in theory and
practice. The Socialist does not propose to destroy
the family, abolish religion or divide up property,
nor does he seek to carry out his ideas by riot
and bloodshed. In a single phrase, Socialism means
public’ ownership of the means of production and
working class control of the Government, a chance
to work for all who will, and to all workers the
full value of their product. The typical Socialist is
a rather quiet and thoughtful workingman, serene
in time of trouble and self-contained in the day of
victory. He realizes that the world will move on
very well after he is dead, but remembers that
while he lives it is his business to help the world
move. He considers himself an ally of eternal laws
of nature and is proud to do his little part in the
great cause.” '

SOTCIALIST DEFINITIONS.

Surplus VaIue—-Briefly stated, surplus value is
that value produced by the workingman which he
does not get, but which goes to the employer and
constitutes his proﬁts. To be proﬁtable to his em-
ployer the wage-worker must produce a value in
excess of what he receives as wages. The laborer
must not_ only work long enough and with suffi-
cient intens-ity each day to produce a value equiva-
lent to his Wage, but he must continue his labors
to create the portion required by his master.

‘ Surplus value is both absolute and relative.
The additional value created by prolonging the
working day beyond the point necessary to repro-
duce the value of the worker's wages is called abso-
lute surplus value. The value which is produced by
decreasing the necessary or paid labor of the worker

‘ in its relation to the surplus or unpaid labor is
-called relative surplus value. Any means of in-
creasing "the intensity of labor or augmenting its
productiveness, any improvement in technics or
methods which shortens the time in which a given
commodity is produced, is a means of extracting”
relative surplus value.

Commodity—A commodity is a product designed
for exchange. The wheat a farmer produces for his
own consumption is not a commodity; that which
he produces for sale is a commodity. Hence, in the
words of Marx, “the wealth of those societies in

presents itself as an immense accumulation of com-
modities.” '

The Class Struggle—The history of all hitherto-
existing‘ society is the history— of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord
and serf, guild-master and journeyman—in a word,
pppressor and oppressed-—stood in constant opposi-
i tion to one another, carried on an uninterrupted,

now hidden, now open ﬁght—a ﬁght that each time
ended either in a revolutionary reconstruction of
society at large or in the common ruin of the con-
tending classes. In the earlier epochs of history we
ﬁnd almost everywhere a complicated arrangement
of society into various orders, a manifold grada-
tion of social rank._ In ancient Rome we have patri-
cians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the middle ages
feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen,
_ apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes
‘again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois

society has not done away with class antagonisms.

,It has but established new classes, new conditions

of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the
old ones.——Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.

Materialistic Conception of History—In every his-
torical epoch the prevailing mode of economic
production and exchange and the social organiza-
tion necessarily following from it, form the basis
upon which is built up and from which alone can be
explained the political and intellectual history of
that epoch.————Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.

Surplus Labor Power—That the natural increase
of the number of laborers does not satisfy the re-

‘ quirements of the accumulation of capital, and yet

all the time is in excess of them, is a contradiction
inherent to the movement of capital itself. The
contradiction is not more glaring than that other
one that there is a complaint of a want of hands,
while at the same time thousands are out of work,

,because the division of labor chains them to a

particular branch of industry.——Karl Marx.

OBJECTIONS '1‘O SOCIALISM ANSWERED.
That Socialism Is Against Religion.

Socialism is an economic political movement.
While there may be individual Socialists who are
unbelievers, Socialists stand for toleration in all
matters of belief. They would not prohibit anyone

‘from being religious if they could, and they could

not if they would, for majorities will rule under
Socialism, and even a majority could not make a
man disbelieve anything he did believe. Socialists
are free to condemn abuses in the name of religion,
but after Socialism is inaugurated it will be possible
to live a deeper religious life than can be done
while poverty and oppression are so prevalent; and
when robbery of the worker ceases, the people who
wish to do so will be better able to support the
church by voluntary contributions than they are
now. The cry that Socialism will destroy religion
is no new cry. It was said of abolition, of public
schools, of labor unions, and even of the Christian
gospel itself. (See “Socialism and Religion”)

That Socialism Will Break -Up the_Home.

wealth concentration, crime, juvenile depravity, the
white slave traffic, involuntary unemployment,
blacklisting and the relation of wages to prices

l

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 193

will show that the present order is breaking up the
home at a rate and to an extent that could not be
equaled by any other system whatever. Socialism
will foster home-making by making it possible for
every family to own a home in its own right.

That Socialism Is the Same as Anarchy.

Socialism stands for a fully organized society,
while anarchy stands for the absence of organiza-
tion. They are the very opposites. The present
order is more nearly anarchistic than is Socialism,
for the reason that while anarchy is absence of
organization, the present order is partial organiza-
tion, and Socialism is complete organization. In-
dividualism, the" thing which Republicans and Demo-
crats both have sanctioned as the opposite of Social-
ism, is nothing more or less than anarchism.

_ That Socialism Is a Foreign Movement.

The earlier efforts at socialization began in
America. The Revolutionary war was fought to so-
cialize or popularize government. The socializing
of the postoffice, of the public roads, of the public
schools was all fought out in America. The propo-
sition of Socialism—-the socializing of industry——
is merely an extension of the work that has been
in progress_in the United States for several cen-
turies. The securing of industrial democracy——the

one demand of Socialism as to method—is the legiti-.

mate outgrowth of political democracy. But the
socializing thought has now become world wide.
It is foreign to no nation of earth. It belongs to
America more than any other nation perhaps, be-
cause the machine and the trust are more fully
developed here than anywhere else, making the
need of it greater than in Europe. On another page
there are data which show that 71 per cent. of the

members of the Socialist party of America are na-
5 tives of America. ‘

That Socialism Means Dividing Up!’

The motto of Socialism is: “Workers of the
world, unite.” Its “effort is to secure co—operation
in the place of divisional work. It aims to make
the tools of production and distribution undivided

‘public property instead of divided individual prop-

erty, as they are now. In every way, it is the
opposite of division. They who declare that Social-
ists want to take all the property of the world and
divide it equally among all the people either know-
ingly or ignorantly misrepresent Socialism. Such
a thing has never been proposed by Socialists and

is utterly repudiated by them.

 

 

 

 

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

194

That Socialism Is Disloyal.

Because the red ﬂag is- used by Socialists some
assume that Socialism is disloyal to American ideas.
The fact is, Socialism is thoroughly in accord with
real Americanism. The red ﬂag is used not as a
substitute for the stars and stripes, but as a symbol
ofgrevolt that was used by Americans before the
stars and stripes came into existence, and as a.
symbol of the international movement and universal
brotherhood. The red ﬂag is not rebellion against;
the country or government, but against abuses and
exploitation. They who imagine the red ﬂag means-.
anarchy are poorly posted on the matter. The
black and not the red ﬂag is the recognized symbol
of,anarchy.

That Socialism Will Be a Species of Bossism.

We are under bossism now. A majority of men
can work only as others employ them, and the em-
ployer has full say as to how things shall be done.
Socialism is a system where the order will be re—
versed. Instead of a few employing and bossing
the many, the many will own the machinery of
production, and employ the managers by electing
them. Instead of the worker being in danger of
being turned off or shut out, he, as part_owner, will
be sure of a job, and will have the power of recall
over the superintendents and foremen. Bossism
will thus virtually pass away.

That Socialism Has Been Tried and Proved a Failure.

Socialism has never been tried. It was never
even proposed until half a century ago. What has
been tried was partial socialization, such as social—-
ized roads, schools, postoffice, etc. These have not;
been failures, yet none of them nor even all of
them, constitute Socialism. Co-operative colonies:
and co-operative businesses are not Socialism, but
only co-operative capitalism. Socialism stands for‘
the socializing of industry, the end of capitalism,
the destruction of the profit system, and these have:
never been tried.

That Socialism Will Take Your Farm Away.
People who call on you “to worry over a theory

that someone else will take away your farm, while '

they are taking it away themselves, are evidently
insincere. If you will turn to the ﬁgures on farm

ownership you will see that out of 6,361,502 farms,
only 2,621,283 are owned free of incumbrance, while
debt and
to \1910 farms

1,327,439 are saddled with mortgage
2,354,676 are rented. From 1900

 

ARSENAL or‘ FACTS, 1917 ‘_ 195

operated by owners increased by only 8 per cent.,
while ‘farms operated by tenants increased 16 per
cent. Your farms are already’ being taken away
from you under the present system. This- is a con-
/dition and not a theory that confronts us. As for
‘Socialism, the whole people, including the farmers,
will have the devising of the means that shall give
all persons access to the land, without interven-
tion of the landlord. There is no out and dried
plan; but the whole aim is, not to dispossess the
people but to make it possible for all to have the
use of land. _

That Socialism Would Degrade Womanhood.
Socialism is the only movement that has declared

for absolute equality of the sexes in all things. -

This is freedom for womanhood. She is degraded
now because she is not a citizen and is dependent

on man for a living. This makes her in effect a

slaye, and is the basis of prostitution. When she
is made economically and politically free. she will
be dependent on none and therefore can develop to
the fullest extent her womanly qualities.
That Socialism Is Against Private Property. .

Socialismlwants only the things that are publicly
used to be publicly owned. Its whole aim is to
make it possible for all people to have private prop-
erty, as only a few people have now. The present
or er is ‘the enemy of private ‘property. This is
proved by the vast amount of poverty that exists
under it. Socialism will end poverty by making it
so all can have private property.

That Socialism Will Destroy Incentive.

‘By giving to the producer theyfull product of
his labor (mental or manual) Socialism will aug-

ment incentive to do, to accomplish and to produce-

Under the present system both producers and in-
ventors are robbed of a large part of their just
recompense. Under Socialism they would receive
the full value of their labor. There would be no
destruction of incentive under Socialism.

That Socialism Fosters “Free Love.”

The charge of fostering “free love” has been’

‘made against virtually every advanced movement
-since antiquity. It was repeatedly made by. the
licentious Romans against the early Christians; it
was in later times made against Protestantism;
‘in still later times it has been made against the
anti-slavery movement, against the scientific move-
ment, against feminism, suffragism, Socialism and

Sis sexual promiscu_ity——a thing which Capitalism

fosters in every part of the world and which ﬂour-
ishes, as a general _rule, in almost direct -ratio- to
the degree of capitalist development. Socialism
will make the sex relation “free” in the sense that
it cannot, as now, be bought. But the question
of what legal or ecclesiastical sanctions or pro-
hibitions°shall be put about the sex relation is one
with which Socialism of itself has nothing to do.

SOME ANTI-SOCIALIST HOAXES.

The Wilhelm Marr Quotation.
From “Socialism” (New and Revised Edition, 19.10),
by John Spargo, pp. 69-70.

Marx opposed the “Alliance de la Democratie
Socialiste,” formed ‘by Bakunin, with its head-
quarters at Geneva, almost as vigorously for its
atheistic plank as for its denial of political methods.
The ﬁrst plank in the programme of the “Alliance”
was as follows:

“The Alliance declares itself Atheist; it demands
the abolition of all worship, the substitution of
science for faith, and of human justice for Divine
justice; the abolition of marriage, so far as it is a
political, religious, juridical, or civil institution.”

This programme is frequently quoted against
the Socialist propaganda——~as, for example, by
George Brooks, in “God’s England or the Devil’s ?”——
in spite of the fact that the “Alliance” was an
Anarchist organization, bitterly opposed by Marx,
:and, in turn, bitterly opposing him.

In this connection, it may be well to call atten-
tion to an alleged “quotation from Marx,” which
‘is frequently used by the opponents of Socialism.
‘It appears in_ the work of Brooks, quoted above,

and in Professor Peabody’s “Jesus Christ and the,
. Social Question” (1907), page 16. Used in a public

discussion by a New York union official, April, 1908,
it was widely discussed by the press, and, according
to that same press, drew from the President of the
United States enthusiastic praise of the labor union
official in question. The passage reads:

“The idea of God must be destroyed. It is the
keystone of a perverted civilization. The true root

 

ARSENAL AOF FACTS, 19i7. 197

of liberty, of equality, of culture, is Atheism. Noth-

ing must restrain the spontaneity of the human
mind.”

‘Had the opponents of Socialism been familiar
with the teachings of Marx, they would have known

that he could not have said anything like this,

that it is absolutely at variance with all his teach-’

ing. The man who formulated the materialist con-
ception of history could not by any possibility utter
such balderdash.‘ The fact is, the quotation is
not from Karl Marx at all, but from a very different
writer, an Anarchist, Wilhelm Marr, ,who was a
most bitter opponent of Socialism. As given, the
quotation is a free translation of a passage con-
tained in Marr’s “Das junge Deutschland in der
Schweiz” (pages 131-134). Marr’s programme, as
given in the “report of the Royal Commission on
Labour” (Vol. V., Germany), was the abolition" of

‘Church, State, property and marriage, with the one

positive tenet’of “a bloody and fearful revenge
upon the rich and powerful.”

From “Karl Marx——His Life and Work,” by John

Spargo, pp. 237-238.

.In Hamburg, in addition to arranging for the
publication of his book, he (Marx) met a man with
whom he is often confused, and for whose vagaries
he is held responsible, Wilhelm Marr.

Marr was not a Socialist at all, but an Anarchist

of the most violent type. He was a bitter opponent

of Socialism, and later on became a fanatical,anti-
Semite. In a letter to Kugelmann, telling of his
meeting with Marr, Marx described him as “a kind
of Christian verson of Lassalle, but he is not
naturally worth as much as the original.”

Later, when Marr devoted himself to Jew-baiting.
Marx spoke of him with measureless loathing and

Socialism and Marriage.
From “Applied Socialism,” by John Spargo,
pp. 249-252. ‘

That there are many marriages which are based
upon economic considerations is unhappily true.
There are loveless marriages for fortune, "which is
only a legalized form of prostitution. There are

. thousands of women who submit to brutal husbands

simply because they are economically dependent,
which is only a form of slavery.

\
It is against such marriages as these, and not

 

193 ‘ THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

against monogamic marriage itself, that a great
deal of_ the Socialist criticism of modern marriage
and family life is directed. Thus, in the “Com-
munist Manifesto,” Marx and Engels, who both
looked upon monogamy as the necessary basis for
the ideal sex-relation, answer the old charge of
attempting to abolish the family. First of__all,
they point to the destruction of family life by
capitalism, which has forced the wife to compete
with the, husband and the child with the father in
the labor market; taken away the mother from
the home and the cradle of her child; herded the
workers and their families in hovels and tenements
where it is difficult for virtue to ﬂourish. Then
they point to the commercialization of marriage-
that legalized prostitution which takes place when
men and women marry, not for love, but for wealth,
title, or social position——and to the vulgar prostitu-
tion and the vice with which society is honey-
combed. “Even if we were aiming to bring about
community of women, as you charge us with do-

'ing,” they say in eﬂ"ect, “we should only be trying

to do in a frank and open way that which you
already do but hypocritically conceal.”

Strangely enough, what Marx and Engels wrote \

as a plea for the family and an attack upon the
forces menacing the family, has been quoted to
prove our hostility to marriage and the family.

Again and again I have been called upon to
expose this dishonest and cowardly form of attack.
The Rt. Rev. James A. McFaul, Roman Catholic
Bishop of Trenton, N. J., does not hesitate to take
the words of Marx and Engels, and by omitting
some words and inserting others, make them ap-
pear to have assailed marriage. Marx and Engels
wrote‘, “that the abolition of the present system of
production must bring with it the abolition of the
community of women springing from that system,
i. e., 'of prostitution, both public and private.” In
a Pastoral Letter published in 1908 the Bishop makes
the writers say, “that the abolition of the present
system of production must bring with it the aboli-
tion of the community of women—present marriage
——springing from that system, both public and pri-
vate.”*‘

When I publicly exposed the fraudulent trick,
the Bishop neither apologized nor withdrew the
statement, but in a letter to the Trenton Evening
Times denied that the passage as he quoted it mis-
represented Marx and Engels. It was translated, he

explained, by the Rev. Father Boarman, S. J., who‘

\_

 

 

ARSENAL or FACTS, 1917. 199

exercised. the translator’s right to add a word here
and there “to bring out the true meaning’’*‘‘

The good Bishop of Trenton evidentlyholds the
ninth commandment lightly.

*Pastoral Letter of the Rt. Rev. James A. McFaul,
Bishop of Trenton, Some Modern Problems, 1908,
p. 27. ’ ,

**Trenton Evening Times, Nov. 19, 1908. E’

Note by Mrr Spargo——It will be observed that the
foregoing exposes a Jesuit forgery. Marx and
Engels clearly wrote that all forms of prostitution
were to be abolished. The Jesuit omits the refer-‘
ence to prostitution, inserts the words “present
marriage,” and makes it appear that marriage, not
prostitution, is to be abolished. By the way, this
same forgery is very extensively quoted.

Engels on Monogamy.
From “Applied Socialism,” by John Spargo,
pp. 253-254.

In his little book, “The Origin of the Family,
Private Property and the State,” Friedrich Engels
discusses with admirable lucidity the relation of

private property to monogamous marriage. He
traces the development of monogamy through
private property and its inheritance, accepting

’Bachofen’s view that the development from group
marriage fy monogamy was mainly due to woman.
But the monogamy which arose in response to the
need for a system of inheritance and bequest was
one—sided and bound only the woman, while man
retained his polygamous practices, either secretly
or openly. A very large part of inheritance wealth
consists of property in the means of production.
;Will the abolition of that form of property entail
the abolition of the system of monogamous mar-
riage?

On the contrary, argues Engels, it will place
woman upon a plane of equality with man and make
monogamy the rule for men as well as for women»
“Remove the economic considerations that now
force women to submit to the customary disloyalty

‘ of men, and you will place woman on an equal foot-

ing with men. All present experiences prove that
this will tend much more strongly to make men
truly monogamous than to make women po.y—
androus.”——F. Engels, “Private Property,” etc.,
Chap. III.

 

    

 

200 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

Bebel’s Views on Marriage.

From “Socialism and Motherhood,” by John Spargo,
pp. 104-105.

The Socialist movement is no more to be charged
with responsibility for Bebe1.’s idea of the probable
future development of marriage and family life,
than for the views on vegetarianism, agriculture
and the fertilization of soils contained in the same
volume. Bebel himself, with his usual candor, has
warned us of this, but it suits the critics of Social-
ism to ignore the warning.‘

*Footnote—“This complete solution of the
women’s question is as unattainable as the solution
of the labor question under the existing social and
political institutions. \

“My fellow Socialists will agree with the last
proposition, but I am not at present in a position
to affirm that they will agree to the manner in
which I see its realization. I must, therefore, re-
quest readers, and especially opponents, to regard
the following statements as the expression of my
personal opinions, and to direct any attacks they
think ﬁt to make against me alone. Indeed I have
every reason to believe that my explicit request
will be disregarded by a certain number of them.
They must be left to the promptings of their own
hearts.” .

Thus Bebel wrote in the preface to “Woman and
Socialism.” How accurately he judged the honesty.
of his opponents may be judged by the fact that
an examination of over six hundred books, pamph-
lets and magazine articlesin which his words are
quoted to prove that Socialists advocate free love,
shows that not in a single instance is th re any
intimation of the important fact that Bebel spe-
ciﬁcally states that he is unable to claim that his
fellow Socialists accept his views. .

LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS.

Of the forty-eight legislatures in continental

lUnited States only six—those of New York, New

Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island
and Ge9rgia—meet every year. The remainder, ex-
cept that of Alabama, meet every two years. Ala-
bama legislators are convened regularly only
once in four years and then for a session of not
more than fifty days. Seventeen States allow their
legislatures to sit as long as they please. The
remainder set a maximum limit of days, ranging
from forty in Wyoming to seventy-ﬁve in Tennessee.

SOCIALIST PLATFORM.
For the United States, 1916.

In the midst of the greatest crisis and bloodiest
struggle of all history the Socialist party of America
reaffirms its steadfast adherence to the principles
of international brotherhood, world peace and indus-
trial democracy. _ .

The great war which has engulfed so much of
civilization and destroyed millions of lives is one
of the natural results of the -capitalist system of
production.

The Socialist party, as the political expression of
the economic interests of the working class, calls
upon them to take a determined stand on the ques-
tion of militarism and War, and to recognize the op-
portunity which the Great War has given them of
forcing disarmament and furthering the cause of
industrial freedom.

An armed force in the hands of the ruling class
serves two purposes: to protect and further the
policy of imperialism abroad and to silence by force

The main platform was drawn up in Chicago, in June,
1916, by the joint meeting of the incoming and outgoing
national executive committees in conference with the party
candidates for President and Vice-President. It was then
submitted for ratiﬁcation to a vote of the party membership.
In the form adopted by referendum, as given here, it in-
cludes a substitute beginning with the words “The Socialist
Party,” in the third paragraph, and closing with the words
“preparedness and militarism” at the end of the eighth
paragraph. ’ -

    

204 THE APPEAL ALMANAC.AND

the protest of the workers against industrial despot-
ism at home. ‘Imperialism and militarism plunged
Europe into this world war. America’s geographical
and industrial situation has kept her out of the
cataclysm. But Europe’s extremity has been the op-
portunity of America’s ruling class to amass enor-
mous proﬁts. As a result, there is a surfeit of capi-
tal which demands the policy of imperialism to pro-
tect and further investments abroad. Hence the
frenzy of militarism into which the ruling class has
made every attempt to force the United States.

The workers in Europe werehelpless to avert the
war because they were already saddled with the bur-
den of militarism. The workers in the United States

are yet free from this burden and have the oppor— _

tunity of establishing’ a working class policy and
program against war. They can compel the Gov-
ernment of the United States to lead the way in an
international movement for disarmament and to
abandon the policy of imperialism which is forcing
the conquest of Mexico and must, if carried out,
eventually plunge the United States into a World-
war.

The working class must recognize the cry of pre-
paredness against foreign invasion as a mere cloak
for the sinister purpose of imperialism abroad and
industrial tyranny at home. The class struggle, like
capitalism, is international. The proletariat of the
world has but one enemy, the capitalist class,
Whether at home or abroad. We must refuse to put
into the hands of this enemy an armed force even
under the guise of a “democratic army,” as the
Workers of Australia and Switzerland have done.

Therefore, the Socialist party stands opposed to
military preparedness, to any appropriations of men
or money for war or militarism, while control of
such forces through the political state rests in the.
hands of the capitalist class. The Socialist party
stands committed to the class war, and urges upon
the workers in the mines and forests, on the rail-
ways and ships, in factories and ﬁelds, the use of
their economic and industrial power, by refusing to
mine the coal, to transport soldiers, to furnish food
or other supplies for military purposes, and thus
keep out of the hands of the ruling class the control

of armed forces and economic power, necessary for ,

aggession abroad and industrial despotism at home.

The working class must recognize militarism as
the greatest menace to all efforts toward industrial
freedom, and regardless of political or industrial
affiliations must present a united front in the ﬁght
against preparedness and militarism. ‘

Hideous as they are, the horrors of the far-
stretched battleﬁeld of the old world are dwarfed
bypthe evil results of the capitalist system, even in
normal times. Instead of ‘being organized to provide
all members of ‘society with an abundance of food,
clothing and shelter, and the highest attainable

’ freedom and culture, industry is at present organ-

ized and conducted for the beneﬁt of a parasitic
class. All the powers "of government, and all our
industrial genius, are directed to the end of secur-
ing to the relatively small class of capitalist in-
vestors the largest amount of profits‘ which can be
wrung from the labor of the ever—increasing class
whose only property is muscle and brain, manual
and mental labor power.

The dire consequences of this system are every-
The workers are oppressed and
deprived of much that makes for physical, mental
and ‘moral well being. Year by year poverty and in-
dustrial accidents destroy more lives than all the
armies and navies in the world. i

To preserve their privilege and power is the most
vital interest of the possessing class, while it is the
most vital interest of the working class to resist
oppression, improve its position, and struggle to
obtain security of life and liberty. Hence there
exists a conﬂict of interests, a social war within
the nation, which can know neither truce nor com-
promise. So long as the few own and control the
economic life of the nation the many must be en-
slaved, poverty must coexist with riotous luxury,
and civil strife prevail.

The Socialist party would end these conditions by
reorganizing the life of the nation upon the basis
of Socialism. Socialism would not abolish private
property, but greatly extend it. We believe that
every human being should have and own all the
things which he can use to advantage, for the en-
richment of his own life, without imposing dis-
advantage or burden upon any other human being.
Socialism admits the private ownership and indi-
vidual direction of all things, tools, economic proc-
esses and functions which are individualistic in
character, and requires the collective ownership and

democratic control and direction of those which are

social or collectivistic in character.

We hold that this country cannot enjoy happi-
ness and prosperity at home and maintain lasting
peace with other nations, so long as its industrial
wealth is monopolized by a capitalist oligarchy. In

INTRODUCTION.

This is the third edition of the Almanac and
the nineteenth of the Arsenal of Facts. Much new
material has been added in this issue, and a special
effort has been made to bring each statement or
statistical table.down to the very latest date. In
certain cases preliminary ﬁgures———both official and
unofficial—have been used, which may or may not
be subsequently altered. As was explained in the
previous issue, it is often impossible to obtain late
revisions of statistical matter. An inquiry and
report on a particular subject may be made, and
never followed .up with a subsequent report. In
other cases, such as some of the census investiga-
tions, a period of ten years must elapse before new
ﬁgures are obtainable. What has been attempted
here is a revision of all material to include the
latest available information. ,

Two new summaries have been especially pre-
pared for this issue. One condenses the noteworthy
and valuable report known as Public Health Bulletin
No. 76, and the other the report of the Illinois
Senate Committee on Vice. In the latter will be
found a strong reiteration of the argument that
vice is chiefly the product of poverty.

The long summary of the Rural Credits Law,
published by the Agricultural Department, is deemed
of sufficient importance to our readers‘ to warrant
its inclusion. Since, however, the good faith of

‘the law is questioned, a criticism of the measure,

written by Patrick S. Nagle, is also included.
Many minor additions and innumerable changes
will be found throughout the volume. Particular
attention may be called to the brief abstract of
Prof. W. I. King’s remarkable study of the national
income; the detailed ﬁgures on the appropriations
of the recent congress; the list——along with several
abstracts—of the more important measures passed
by that body; the new ﬁgures on mining casualties
and war costs; the new names in the list of heads
of government; the new table of corporation pen-
sions, and the preliminary ﬁgures on railway earn-
ings. It is hoped that the present issue will be
found the completest and most useful edition so
far of the Almanac and Arsenal of Facts. . e

arising from temporary situations, whether domes-
tic or foreign, must be subordinated to the major
issue—the need of such a reorganization of our
economic life as will remove the land, the mines,
forests, railroads, mills and factories", all the things
required for our physical existence, from the
clutches of industrial and ﬁnancial freebooters and
place them securely and permanently in the hands.
of the people.

If men were free to labor to satisfy their desires,
there could be in this country neither poverty nor-
involuntary unemployment. But the men in this
country are not free to labor to satisfy their desires.
The great industrial population can labor only when
the capitalist class, who own the industries, believe

‘they can market their product at a proﬁt. The

needs of millions are subordinated to the greeds of
a few. The situation is not unlike that of a pyra-
mid balanced upon its apex. Oftentimes this pyra-
mid tumbles and industrial depression comes. There
was such a crash in 1907. If the capitalist owners
had been willing to get out of the way, industry
could have been revived in a day. But the capitalist
owners are never willing to get out of the way.
Their,greeds come first
all, afterward. Therefore business did not quickly
revive after the industrial depression of 1907. Mr.
Taft was elected to bring good times, but in four
years failed to bring them. Mr. Wilson was elected
to bring good times, but not all of the measures he
advocated had the slightest effect upon industry.
The European war has brought to this country
tremendous orders for military supplies and has
created a period of prosperity for the few. For the
masses of the people there is but an opportunity
to work hard for a bare living, which is not pros-

perity, but slavery. As against the boast of the

present national administration ‘that its political
program, now fully in force, has brought prosperity
to the masses, we call attention to the statement of
the Federal Public Health Service that $800 a year
is required to enable a family to avoid physical
deterioration through lack of decent living condi-
tions, that more than half of the families of work-

ing men receive less than that amount, that nearly,

a third receive less than $500 a year, and that one
family in twelve receives less than $300 a year.

The capitalist class, for a great many years, has

been trying to saddle upon this country a greater

army and a greater navy. A greater army 1S de-

guard the foreign/investments of American capital—
ists and to “back up” American diplomacy in its
efforts to gain foreign markets for American capi-
talists. The war in Europe, which diminished and
»is still diminishing the remote possibility of Euro-
pean attack upon the United States, was neverthe-
less seized upon by capitalists and by unscrupulous
politicians as a meanszof spreading fear through-
out the country, to the end that, by false pretenses,
great military establishments might be obtained.
’We denounce such “preparedness,” as both false in
principle, unnecessary in character and dangerous in
its plain tendencies toward militarism. We advocate
that sort of social preparedness which expresses it-
self in better homes, better bodies and better minds,
, which are alike the products of plenty and the
’ necessity of eﬁective defense in war.
The Socialist party maintains its attitude of un-
alterable opposition to war.
We reiterate the statement that the competitive
E -» nature of capitalism is the cause of modern war.
and that the co—operative nature of Socialism is
alone adapted to the task of ending war by removing
its causes. We assert, however, that, even under
the present capitalist order, additional -~ measures
can be taken to safeguard peace, and to this end,
‘7 we demand:
, A MEASURES TO INSURE PEACE.
j (1) That all laws and appropriations for the in-
; crease of‘ the military and naval forces of the
United States shall be immediately repealed.

(2) That the power be taken from the President
to lead the nation into a position which leaves no
I escape from war. No one man, however exalted in

official station, should_have the power to decide the
question of peace or war for a nation of a hundred
millions. To give one man such power is neither
i democratic nor safe. Yet the‘President exercises
such power when he determines what shall be the
nation’s foreign policies and what shall be the na-
ture and tone of its diplomatic intercourse with
other nations. We, therefore,
i , power to ﬁx foreign policies and conduct diplomatic
* negotiations shall be lodged in the Congress and
I shall be exercised publicly, the people reserving the
right by referendum to order Congress, at any time,

to change its foreign policy.
(3) That no war shall be declared or waged by
the United States without a referendum vote of the

entire people, except for the purpose of repelling pp

invasion.

« (4) That the Monroe Doctrine shall be immedi-
ately abandoned as a danger so great that even its
advocates are agreed that it constitutes perhaps
our greatest single danger of War. The Monroe
Doctrine was originally intended to safeguard the
‘peace of the United States. Though the Doctine has
changed from a safeguard to a menace, the capital-
ist class still defends it for the reason that our
great capitalists desire to retain South and Central
America as their private trade preserve. We favor
the cultivation of social, industrial and political
friendship with all other nations in the western’
hemisphere, as an approach to a world confedera-
tion of nations, bu_t We oppose the Monroe Doctrine
because it takes from our hands the peace of Amer-’
ica and places it in the custody of any nation that
would attack the sovereignty of any State in the
Western world.

(5) That the independence of the Philippine
Islands be immediately recognized as a measure of
justice both to the Filipinos and to ourselves. The
Filipinos are entitled to self—government; we are
entitled to be free from the necessity of building
and maintaining enough dreadnaughts to defend
them in the event of War.

(6) The Government of the United States shall
call a congress of all neutral nations to mediate
between the belligerent powers in an effort to es-
tablish an immediate and lasting peace without in-
dengnities, or forcible annexation of territory, and
based on a binding and enforceable international
treaty, which shall provide for concerted disarma-
ment on land and at sea and for an International
Congress with power to adjust all disputes between
nations, and which shall guarantee freedom and
equal rights to all oppressed nations and races.

WORKING PROGRAM.

As general measures calculated to strengthen the
working class in its ﬁght for the realization of its
ultimate aim, the Co-operative Commonwealth, and
to increase its power of resistance against capital-
ist oppression, we advocate and pledge ourselves
and our elected officers to the following program:

‘ 1 Political Demands.

impracticable, ‘the appropriation by taxation of the
annual rental value of all land held for speculation
or exploitation.

6. All currency shall be issued by the Govern-
ment of the United States and shall be legal tender
for the payment of taxes and impost duties and
for the discharge of public and private debts. The

for the purpose of taking over or establishing pub-
lic utilities and for building or maintaining public

or municipalities. Said bonds are to be repaid in
twenty equal and annual installments, and the cur-

tions of workers, and to take such other measures

capitalist class. A ' \

Industrial Demands.

The conservation of human resources, particularly -

of the lives and well-being of the workers and their
families:

By shortening the work day in keeping with
the increased productiveness of machinery. .

2. By securing the freedom of political and
economic organization and activities. ’

3. By securing to every worker a rest period of
not less than a day and a half in each week.

. 4. By securing a more effective inspection of
workshops, factories and mines.

5. By forbidding the employment of children un-
der eighteen years of age.

6. By forbidding the interstate transportation of
the products of child labor and of all uninspected
factories and mines. i

7. By establishing minimum wage scales.

8. By abolishing official charity and substituting
a non—contributory system of old age pensions, a
general system of insurance by the State of all its
members against unemployment and invalidism, and
a system of compulsory insurance by employers of
their workers, without cost to the latter, against
industrial diseases, accidents and death.

9. By establishing mothers’ pensions.

5 The Farmers’ Program.

The following farmers’ program was adopted by

J the National Convention of the Socialist party in

1912:

1. The, Socialist party demands that the means
;of transportation and storage and the plants used
in the manufacture of farm products and farm
machinery, when such means are used for exploita-

tion, shall be socially owned and democratically‘

managed.

. 2. To prevent the holding of land out of use and
to eliminate tenartry, we demand that all farm
land not cultivated by owners shall be taxed at its

‘class emancipation.

212 T  THE APPEAL AIiMANAC AND

full rental value, and that actual use and occupancy
shall be the only title to land.

3. We demand the retention by the National,
State and local governing bodies of all land owned
by them, and the continuous acquirement of other
land by reclamation, purchase, condemnation, taxa-
tion or otherwise; such land to be organized as
rapidly as possible into socially operated farms for
the conduct of collective agricultural enterprises.

4. Such farms should constitute educational and
experimental centers for crop culture, the use of

fertilizers and farm machinery and distributing
points 'for improved seeds and better breeds of
animals.

5. The formation of co-operative associations for
agricultural purposes should be encouraged.
‘ 6. Insurance against diseases of animals and
plants, insect pests and natural calamities should
be provided by National, State or local governments.
7 We call attention to the fact that the elimina-

tion of farm tenantry and the development of

socially owned and operated agriculture will open-

new opportunities to the agricultural wage-worker
and to that extent free him from the tyranny of
the private employer.

8. The Socialist party pledges its support to the
renters and the agricultural wage-Workers in their
attempts to organize to protect themselves from
the aggressions of capitalism and the employers of
agriculture.

9. While the above is offered as a general out-
line for the National Agricultural program of the
Socialist party, we wish to point out that there
are such variations of conditions in the widely
separated districts of the United States that to each
section and to each State must be left the task of
working out the further details of a program
applicable to the peculiar agricultural conditions
in their respective States and districts.

The Labor Policy.

The following resolution was unanimously adopted
at the National Convention of the Socialist party in
1912:

Political organization and economic organization
are alike necessary in the struggle for working
The most harmonious relations
ought to exist between the two great forces of the
working class movement—the Socialist party and
the labor unions.’

recent years made marvelous progress in all direc-
tions. It has steadily increased in numbers and has
reached trades and industries which were before
unorganized. It has in many instances concen-
trated its power and increased its efﬁciency by the
amalgamation of related trades into federations
and industrial unions. Many unions have opened
meetings and journals to the discussion of vital
social and political problems of the working class,.
and have repudiated the demoralizing policies pre-
sented by the National Civic Federation. The or-
ganized workers are rapidly developing an enlight-
ened and militant class-consciousness.

The reality of this progress is attested by the
increasing virulence with which the organized capi-
talists wage their war/against the union. This im-

proved economic organization is not a matter of’
abstract theory, but grows out of the experience of’

the wage-workers in the daily struggle. Only those-
actually engaged in the struggle in the various.
trades and industries can solve the problems of form».
of organization. ~

The Socialist party therefore reaffirms the posi--
tion it has always taken with regard to the move-
ment of organized labor:

1. That the party has neither the right nor"
the desire to interfere in any controversies which
may exist within the labor union movement over‘
questions of form of organization or technical.
methods of action in the industrial struggle, but

trusts to the labor organizations themselves to
solve these questions.
2. The Socialists call_the attention of their

brothers in the labor unions to the vital importance
of the task of organizing the unorganized, especial-
ly the immigrants and unskilled laborers, who
stand in greatest need of organized protection and
who will constitute a great menace to the progress
and «welfare of organized labor if they remain neg-
lected. The Socialist party will ever be ready to
co-operate with the labor unions in the task of
organizing the unorganized workers, and urges all
labor organizations, who have not already done so,
to throw their doors wide open to the workers of
their respective trades and industries, abolishing
all onerous conditions of membership and artiﬁ-cial
restrictions. In the face of the tremendous powers
of the American capitalists and their close indus-
_trial and political union, the workers of this coun-

try can win. their battles only by strong class-,

conscious and closely united organizations on the

economic ﬁeld, a powerful and militant party on
the political ﬁeld and by joint attack of both on
the common enemy. '

3. That it is the duty of the party to give moral
and material support to the labor organizations in
all their defensive or aggressive struggles against
capitalist oppression and exploitation, for the pro-,
tection and extension of the rights of the wage-
workers and the betterment of their material and
social condition.

4. That it is the duty of the members of the
Socialist party who are eligible to membership in
the unions to join and be active in their respective
labor organizations.

Attitude on Liquor Problem.

The following resolution was adopted at the
National Socialist convention, 1912:

The manufacture and sale for proﬁt of intoxicat-
ing and adulterated liquors leads directly to many
serious social evils. Intemperance in the use of
alcoholic liquors weakens the physical, mental and
moral powers.

We hold, therefore, that any excessive indulgence
in intoxicating liquors by members of the working
class is a serious obstacle to the triumph of our
class, since it impairs the vigor of the ﬁghters in
the political and economic struggle, and we urge
the members of the working class to avoid any
indulgence which might impair their ability to
wage a successful political and economic struggle,
and so hinder the progress of the movement for
their emancipation. ,

We do not believe that the evils of alcoholism
can be eradicated by repressive measures or any
extension of the police powers of the capitalist
state—alcoholism is a disease of which capitalism‘
is the chief cause. Poverty, overwork and over-
worry necessarily result in intemperance on the
part of the victims. To abolish the wage system
with all its evils is the surest way to eliminate the
evils ‘of alcoholism and the traffic in intoxicating
liquor. A

. Socialism and Religion. ‘
From Socialist party platform, adopted May 10,
1908, at national convention, Chicago, Ill.
The Socialist party is primarily an economic and
political movement. It is not concerned With triat-
ters of religious belief. '

SAVING MONEY.

In the United States there are approximatelv
thirty million wage—workers, earning an average of
$10 a week. If each saved one-tenth of his income
the accumulated savings would amount to thirty
million dollars in one week; one hundred. and
twenty million dollars in one month; one billion
five hundred and sixty million dollars in one year;
three billion one hundred and twenty million
dollars /in two years—which is more money than
there is in circulation. “ Industry would be totally
paralyzed and the worst of all panics precipitated. '

If it be contended that theworker should invest
his savings in a home-it is pertinent to ask when
he should buy the home? At the end of the first
week when he» has $1. or at the expiration of the
first month when he has $4? Should he wait till

18 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

1>Ui3L1c HEALTH BULLETIN 76.

No more damning indictment of social conditions
under capitalism has appeared during the year than
the bulletin of the Public Health Service entitled
‘:‘Health Insurance: Its Relation to the Public
Health.” It is known as Bulletin No. 76 of the
Public Health Service, and is issued by the Federal
Treasury Department, of which the Health Service
is a subordinate bureau. The authors are B. S.
Warren and Edgar Sydenstricker, respectively sur-
geon and statistician of the bureau. The pamphlet,
which contains 79 pages, is at once a statement of
health conditions, particularly among the wage-
earners, and an argument for government health
insurance.

Average Nine ‘Days’ Illness Yearly.

“It has been tentatively stated,” says the bulletin,
“thateach of the 30,000,000 workers in the.United
States losses; on the average about nine days every
year on‘ account of sickness alone.” This estimate,
it is pointed out, very nearly coincides with the
German and English figures, for more than 26,000,000
industrial workers, which show an average of eight
to nine days of illness per year through a number
of years. Putting the average daily wage at $2,
says the bulletin, and the cost of medical attention
at $1 per day, the annual loss would be $800,000,000.
This estimate, however, leaves out of consideration
the losses due to death and to decrease in efficiency
which follows illness, as well as the effect on the
family of the breadwinner which usually must lower
its subsistence.‘ »* _ T
» Theseiﬁgures, continues the bulletin, give an idea
of the‘ magnitude of the loss, but to be properly
appreciated must be interpreted in terms of human
suffering. It then gives some ﬁgures regarding the
prevalence of disease in particular occupations.
Examinations of some 2,300 wage—earners, including
bakers, tailors, furriers and tobacco workers, by
Dr. George Price, of the New York State Factory
Investigating Commission, showed that from 57 to
89 per cent. of these workers had one or more dis—
ea'ses,’and that from 1.3 per cent. (tobacco workers)
to 6 per cent. (furriers) had tuberculosis. Dr.
James Alexander Miller’s examination of 200 printers
in 1908 showed that 69 per cent. were afflicted with
one or more diseases and that 16.7 per cent. had
tuberculosis. Other examinations in various indus-

SOMETHING VVRONG.

_ , ‘By Robert G. Ingersoll.
There is something wrong in a government
where they who do the most have the least. There
is something wrong when honesty wears a rag, and

, rascality a robe; when the loving, the tender, eat
. a crust, while the infamous sit atbanquets.

THE SOCIALIST AIM.
From a Socialist Panty Leaﬂet.

Our aim is: The free democracy with equal
economic and political rights; the free society with
associative labor. The welfare of all is for us the
one end of the state and society.

We seek justice and ﬁght injustice.

We seek free labor and attack wage slavery. _

We seek the prosperity of all and struggle against
misery. ’

We seek the education of all and ﬁght ignorance
and barbarism. ,

We seek peace and order and combat the murder
of people, the class war and social anarchy. .

We seek the Socialist people's state and attack

the despotic class state.

Whoever desires these things and struggles for
them, let him unite with us and work with all his
strength for our cause—for the cause of Socialism
——for the cause of humanity, whose victory will
soon be gained.‘

222 I THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

MEYER LONDON’S RECORD.
By LUCIEN SAINT.

For two years the Socialist party and the work-«
ing class of the United States have been represented’
in the House of Representatives by one man——Meyer
London, of the 12tli' New York district. London
during this period has been the minority party of
the ‘lower chamber. His was the one voice heard
against the voting of funds for the famous “Get
Villa” expedition into Mexico. He voted against
the big preparedness program, along with a few
timid paciﬁsts and members who wanted a still
larger program of defense. He always voted and
raised his voice for labor in those halls where
labor’s voice is rarely if ever heard.

“Alone in Congress” might be the title of a book
by Meyer London, for he has worked with little help
from even the so-called “labor group” in the House.
Yet he has not been alone, for outside the walls of
Congress were hundreds of thousands of men,
women and children, whom he really represented.
and who stood behind him, giving him moral support.
and power.

London’s bare record shows two years of hard
activity. During his term he has held membership
in three committees—Labor, Mines, and Expendi-
tures in the Department of Labor. He spoke in
debate some thirty times, and answered to eighty-
four roll calls.

Here is the barest summary of the record:

Urges Conference of Neutral Nations.

Introduced, Dec. 6, 1915, House Joint Resolution,
calling upon the President to call a conference of
neutral nations to offer mediation to the warring
powers, and outlining principles on which a durable
peace should be based.

Took this resolution up with President Wilson, in-
company with Hillquit and Maurer of the Socialist
National Executive Committee on January 24.

Conducted hearings on it, February 23 and 24,
before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Twenty
national organizations sent spokesmen to the hear-
ings to support it.

Secured its introduction in the Senate by Senator
Lane of Oregon.

Works for National Insurance Fund.
Introduced, February 19, 1916, House Joint Resolu-

tion 159, “For the appointment of a Commission to -

Conducted hearing on this measure, May 6 and
May 11, before the House Committee on Labor.

Secured approval of Labor Committee for a
modiﬁed form of this measure, which he reported on
behalf of the Committee as H. J. Res. 250, on July
1, 1916. Provides for a Commission on Social In-
surance, to investigate and recommend to Congress
as to a national fund for old age pensions, sickness
insurance and unemployment insurance.

Votes Against Invasion of Mexico.

ments to bills, and voted in Committee of the Whole
and 'n the House, against all phases of the military
and naval expansion program.

Voted alone against the appropriation for the ex-
pedition into Mexico.

Cast one of the two votes registered against
drafting the National Guard for service on or be-
yond the Mexican border.

Cast the only anti-militarist vote against the Hay
military bill. Prevented, as a result of this fact,
the agreement of the House to the proposal of
250,000 men for the regular army, adopted in the
Senate.

Spoke and voted for immediate independence for
the Philippines.

Made, almost single-handed, the fight against dis-
franchisement of 165,000 workers in Porto Rico.
As’ a result, the Senate Committee recommended
that this disfranchisement be postponed for ten
years.

Made only speech of the session to House urging
direct government development and operation of
hydro—electric power. ,,

Voted for government armor-plant and nitrate-
plant amendments to the navy and army bills re-
spectively, but voted against bills as a whole.

Spoke and voted for Child Labor bill, and offered
amendment to Workmen’s Compensation bill to
make it cover occupational diseases.

Spoke and voted for income and inheritance tax
provisions of the Revenue bill. Spoke and voted
against retaining tariﬁ‘ on sugar. Urged Federal
taxation of unearned increment of land values.

RECLAIMABLE SWAMP LANDS, ‘

There are today approximately 100,000,000 acres of
swamp lands in the United States of which 75,000,000
acres can be reclaimed for agriculture, according
to a report issued November 2, 1916, by the commit-
tee on statistics and standards of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States. The area which
could be reclaimed is about 72 per cent of the entire

acreage of our present corn crop and twice the aver-

age acreage planted in cotton.

The work of swamp reclamation is practically all
done by private enterprises, sometimes by individuals,
sometimes by chartered companies, but more often
by co-operative organizations in the form of what:
are .known as drainage districts. The districts are-

~ formed usually by the majority, sometimes two-

thirds, of the persons who own the lands.

SOCIALIZATION IN AMERICA.

From Appeal’s Pamphlet, “The Road to Socialism”
by Lincoln Phifer (revised).

SOCALIZED LAND.

According to official ﬁgures, there were in 1913
public (unappropriated and unreserved) lands in
the United States to the amount of 665,891,029
acres, or 30 per cent. of the total area of the country.
Half of this, however, or 367363.823 acres, is in
Alaska, where it is not favorable for farming.
Much of the remainder is also at present unavail-
able for farming, being listed as agricultural,
marshy, hilly and broken, mountainous and arid.
The public land is found in twenty-ﬁve States of
the Union, besides Alaska and the Philippines,
and in 907 counties in continental United States.
The amount.of swamp and overﬂow land belonging
to the whole people is 74,541,700 acres,—w'nich, when
drained, will become excellent agricultural land.
The Governnient has irrigation projects, intended
to redeem 2,540,633 acres of land, and this, ‘too,
will becomii-. superb agricultural land in time. _

In addition to these public lands, there are
159,801,848 acres in 160 national (public) forests,
on which there are pastured horses, cattle. hogs.
sheep and goats to the number of 9,424,969, and
from which there was cut and sold in 1913 timber
aggregating 2,137,311,000 feet. The various sources
of revenue brought in $2,467,590 in 1913.

There are in the United States national parks
aggregating nearly ﬁve and a half million acres.

The total amount of land belonging to the whole
people, with the general Government as trustee,

’‘ when one adds to the above the land held for

capitols, postoffices, navy yards and other public
works, is at present close to one billion acres. The
land is valued by the Government at $1.25, $2.50
and $5 an acre, an average of $3. This makes
the national lands of America worth‘, as they are,
two billion dollars. They are really worth full
four billions. '

SOCIALIZED SCHOOLS.

Official ﬁgures of the Bureau of Education for
1912 _g1ve the school population as 25,167.445. The
running school expenses for 1912 were $482,315,142.

The number of teachers employed was 549,313. The .

average cost of the schools per inhabitant was

practically an _even $5. Estimating a room for

tries and on a large scale showed a tuberculosis
rate of from 1.1 to 4.6 per cent. .~ .

Causes of Disease. Among . Workers:

“Among the more important factors,” says the
bulletin, “which affect the health of the wage-
working population may be mentioned the following:

“ . The occupational hazards of disease. .

“2. Irregularity of employment.

“3. Unhealthful conditions of living. _ .

“4. The employment of women in industry._under
modernconditions of work, particularly of married
women. ' _ .

“5. The economic disadvantage at which a large
proportion of wage-workers and their families ‘are
placed as the result of low wages and insxufficient
annual income.” ’ ‘

The responsibility of modern industry fora con-
siderableproportion of the workers’ ills, say the
authors, is no longer a matter of doubt. ‘It is
widely recognized that certain specific substances

and conditions in work-places, as well as certain .

conditions of employment generally,‘exert harmful
effects upon health. Many diseases have bVeen'trace’d
more’ or less directly to anoccupation. ' '

Such substances as metals, dusts, gases, 'vap'ors
and fumes encountered in‘ certain occupa‘tions"‘have
been shown in many investigations to be most
deleterious to health. Familiar examples are those
of phosphorus, lead, mercury and arsenic‘ poisoning.
“There is scarcely any one‘-line of modernimanufacé
ture,” writes I. M. Rubindw, “which is free from
the dangers of industrial poisoning.”  " 

Harmful Working Conditions. ‘T

But the general conditions that prevail_in work-
places probably cause more illness in the_mass than
the speciﬁc poisoning encountered in some of, the
occupations. In spite of all that has been done by
the various states to make workshops sanitary.
investigations show that conditions haveimprtoved
but slightly. The second report of the New York
Factory Investigating Commission of 1913, while
acknowledging the existence of certain model estab-
lishments, declares that “much that”is'deplorable”
has been‘ revealed and that “there is a tendency on
the part of many employers to economize ' " * ‘in
space, light, air and certain other safeguards to the
health and lives of the workers.” A report .of.a
sanitary survey of Louisiana factories published in
March, 1914,, indicates that more than 50 per’ cent.

every teacher,’ costing not less than $1,000, the
money invested in the public ‘schools of America
and their equipment is at least $500,000,000. There
are probably not less than half a million acres
of ground set apart for school purposes, if one
considers the public libraries and other auxiliaries
in various ‘sections. This land is worth another
half million dollars. '

PUBLIC ROADS AND STREETS.
The mileage of public roads, estimated by the

census department (page 179, 1911 report) is.

2,199,388 miles. The estimated annual expenses of
maintaining these roads is $142,144,191, or $1.55
per inhabitant. The total investment, including a
modest price for the land traversed and the cost
of maintaining them for ten years, is not less than
two,billion dollars. A conservative estimate places
the number of acres of land in America devoted to
roads at 20,000,000. The roads of the United States

, would encircle the globe nearly one hundred times.

There are in the United States ﬁfty cities with
more than 100.000 population each, and 200 with
more than 25,000 each, besides over 50,000 towns
and villages. The estimated mileage of streets and
alleys in these towns is given conservatively at
more than four million miles, or sufficient to en—
circle the globe about 160 times. The land occupied
by them, averagingthirty feet wide, is not less than
40,000,000 acres, which, valued at only $200 an acre,
which is very low, for city property, would bring the
original investment to more than eight billion dol-
lars. When you consider that thousands of miles
of these streets are paved, the total investment in
streets and alleys and sidewalks in America cannot
run less than twenty billion dollars. There are
probably two million miles of sidewalks in the
United States. '

* WATERWAYS.

«The United States owns about 4,000 miles of sea-
coast, and controls some 32,000 miles of rivers that
arenavigable for large or small craft. The sea-
coast includes harbors, lighthouses and various
other things. It is impossible to give an accurate
estimate of the value of this possession, as it

cannot be reckoned entirely with dollars and cents.

Thousands are employed in the life saving and
harbor Service of America in a public canacitv.

PANAMA CANAL. ,_,

The Panama canal has cost to June 30, 1914,
$332,956,264.55, exclusive of $10,000,000 to Panama
and $40,000,000 to the French company. Until
recently it has employed an average of 45,000 men,
5,000 of whom were Americans. In constructing‘
that canal the Government has engaged in practi-
cally every business, from laundry work and bak-
ing to running grocery stores and boarding houses.
Its handling of the health question has been the

"wonder of the age, making a sickly section as

healthy as any territory in the country.

POSTOFFICE. \
The postoffice department covers 58,020 post-

 

oﬁices‘ and routes that aggregate 436,293 (1913),

miles. It employs more than 150,000 persons, and
expends annually about $270,000,000. The invest-
ment in buildings and equipment cannot be less
than half a billion dollars.

ARMY AND NAVY.

These are departments that absorb a vast amount
of the public wealth, and waste it. However, this
wealth is handled in a better way than it could
be by individuals. There are officers and men in the
army (1913) 92,035, and a reserve force under the
Dick military law of 14,752,293, not to speak of
State militia and the naval force. The expendi-
tures for the army in 1911 were $95,316,665, and
for the navy $127,494,141. While the life of a
battleship is short, and while there are no deﬁnite

;statistics available, it is estimated that the Govern—
'ment has a plant in the forts, arsenals, equipment,

uniforms, ammunition, navy yards_ and various
grades of war vessels of something like two billion
dollars.

LOCAL BUILDINGS.

There are f0rty—six States, all with State capitals,
court buildings, universities and charitable insti-
tutions. The average expenditure along these lines
will reach at least five million dollars for each
State, or an aggregate of about $230,000,000. There

\ are about three_ thousand counties in the United

 

States, each of which has its court house and jail,
many of which have county farms and other insti-
tutions. At an average cost of $20,000 for these
improvements (and that is a modest estimate), the
aggregate county wealth would be more than

some form of city improvements, such as libraries,
city halls, jails, parks, tools, some elaborate and

all these things may very conservatively be esti-

MUNICIPAL RECREATION.

The Socialist city of Conneaut, Ohio, 9,000 people,
owns its own summer resort and bathing beach.
The property has ‘been in the possession of the city
for thirteen years. But under old—party manage-

:ment and private leasing it was allowed to run
«down till the people avoided it. In the fall of

.1913 the Socialist ticket, with D. W. Brace, a rail-
road conductor, as mayor, and S. W. Mahaffey, a
day laborer, as director of public service, was
elected, and the ﬁrst thing these men did was to
clean up the park and declare it a free resort for
people of small means. The venture has been a
success from the start.

Newark, N. J., though not a Socialist city, also
has a municipal summer resort. It lies between
Belmar and Avon and is 111/2 acres in area, with
a frontage on both the ocean and the Shark River.
lt was started in 1906. The management is under
the direction of the public outing committee of the
Newark common council, and every cent that is spent
on maintaining the place comes out of the municipal
treasury. For a season of ten weeks it provides a
week’s outing for groups of 200 children at a time,
and closes with a special “mothers’ week.”

New York City, with its municipal bathing house
at Coney Island, may also be included .in the list

.of cities owning summer resorts.

 

ARSENAL or FACTS, 1917. 229

SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY.

Democracy bears very much the same relation to
Socialism that the circulation of the blood bears
to the human body. Without democracy Socialism
becomes incapable of performing‘ its functions, just
as the organs, of the body become incapable of per-
forming their functions Without the circulation of
the blood. '

Socialism is deﬁned as: “The collective owner-

ship and democratic managzjement of things collec—_

tively used.” Under this deﬁnition Socialism i‘ep1'e~
seiits an established ‘form of society in which its
members control and direct, in their col‘lective

capacity, the management of its social, political and

economic affairs.

The status of such a society then must neces~
sarily be a true reﬂex of the degree and character
of the democracy applied to the workings of the
organization.

Democracy is a term used to represent the medium‘
through which the primal needs and requirements
of society are expressed and through which the
majority give voice to their preference of different
propositions that shall become the law. governing:
and regulating'_ their conduct as citizens of the
commonwealth.

Socialism. as a system of government to be applied
to society, is not a deﬁnite, inﬂexible program. But
on the other hand, it is a program of the greatest
ﬂexibility, Varying to accommodate the inﬂux of
new concepts that are designed to shape its ends
to a’ definite purpose.

It is here that the inseparable relationship be-
tween Socialism and democracy is so clearly maiii—
fested. No one can fail to appreciate the import-
ance that Socialism attaches to the expressions of
an intelligent democracy.

Just as the condition of the blood is revealed in
the appearance of the body,‘ so are the degree and
character of democracy manifested in the organic-
structure of the Socialist organization in which it
functions. The potency of democracy is determined
by the degree of experience and intelligence of
those from which it emanates, and it.s vitality, or‘
feebleness is indelibly impressed upon the Socialist
organization. .
/ Socialism is the only source from which the ideals‘
of the new democracy can be evolved for it is the-

“only organization in which democracy becomes a
/ living reality instead of a theoretic creed,

WHY THEY wﬁivr TO WAR.’
From the Independent.

The British and German. White Papers, giving the
diplomatic correspondence that preceded the war,
show that the various nations involved went to war
for the following reasons (accepting each nation’s
statement of its own case):

Austria—Because Servia would not permit Aus-
trian officials to take part in investigations in

itself.

232 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

Servia into the responsibility of Servians for the
murder of the Austrian crown_ prince and princess.
Servia—Beca11se upon her refusalto accede to

this demand of Austria on the ground that she’
.would be sacriﬁcing her own sovereignty, and in

spite of her proposal to leave the matter to arbi-
tration, Austria attacked her.

Russia—Because Austria was making war upon
:Servia. -

Germany—Because Russia declined to cease mo-
bilizing her army—a mobilization which Germany
believed was directed at herself as well as at her
ally, Austria.

France——.Because her ally Russia was attacked
by Germany.

Belgium——Because her neutral ‘territory, whose
neutrality was guaranteed by a treaty signed by
Germany, was invaded by German arms. ‘
‘England—Because Germany had violated the
treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium,- of
which both Germany and England were signers.

Japan—Because her treaty with England bound
her to join with England when the peace of the
Far ’East was threatened.

The impartial historian will some day know
how to apportion the ﬁnal responsibility for the
great war among the nations that entered it. We
now merely report what each nation has to say for

JINGOISM VS. CIVILIZATION.
From the Independent.

In a published letter Lord Roberts, great military
authority that he was, says:

“My country, right or wrong, * * * is the sen~
timent most treasured in the breast of any one
-worthy the name of man.”

So said Stephen Decatur in a toast given in
Norfolk in 1820:

“Our country!~ In her intercourse with foreign
nations may she always be in the right; but our
.country, right ‘or wrong.”

In response John Quincy Adams wrote: \

“And say not then, ‘My country right or wrong,’

Nor draw thy sword in an unhallowed cause,

But when thy country wanders from the right

Furl up her banners and avert thy sight.”

Which doctrine is right, that of the two soldiers
or that of the statesman?

COST OF THE WAR; »

In October, 1914, when the great war had been
raging for two and a half months, Paul Leroy-
Beaulieu, the economist, estimated that each of
the great lbelligerents was spending $200,000,000
monthly. For the ﬁve great powers the ‘total was
$1,000,000,000 a month. These ﬁgures did not take
into account the losses of revenues, the loss from
the destruction of property, nor the ‘far greater
loss in the productive powers of the nations by
the death or maiming of millions of men. They did
not include, moreover, the expenditures and losses
of Japan, Belgium and Servia. ‘

At the End of the First Year.

By August, 1915, at the end of‘ the first year of
the war, the cost, as computed by the bond expert
of the A. B. Leach Company of New York, had

THE SECOND YEAR.

Estimates of casualties for the second year are
lacking in detail. According to the Current His-
tory’ Magazine the second year cost more than
3,000,000 lives and the wounding of 6,000,000 ,men.
Up to July 1st«the British had lost
totally incapacitated 228,138 and 68,046 inprisoners;
Germany, 664,552 and 137,768; France, 900,000 and
300,000. Russian casualties are unknown, but have
been asserted. by Germany to be 3,000,000, of whom
1,000,000 were prisoners. Estimates of available
eifectives gave, on Aug 11st, the allies 23,300,000 men

 and the central powers 10,600,000.

 

CAPITALISM AND WAR.
From.David Starr Jordan's “War and 'Wages.”

It was found during the recent expose of the Ger-
man war office that the Krupp Company, a German

ﬁrm which manufactures war armaments, subsidized‘

newspapers in France to create animosity against
the German nation and thus create a war scare in

. Germany and‘ a consequent increase in armament.
While nothing quite so ﬂagrant has thus far come -
to light in the United States, there is in our country,

a ,Navy League with headquarters in Washington.

20 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

of all the establishments in the state were in “poor”
or “bad” condition. The conditions revealed in these
two states, as well as in Ohio, are declared by the
authors to be “probably typical for most industrial
localities in the United States.”

Disease Caused by Fatigue.

Excessive fatigue is also a fertile cause of disease.
Long hours, the piecework system, the increasing

use of machine methods and the setting of workers"

at tasks beyond their strength, bring exhaustion,
which in turn breeds illness. In spite of the move-

ment for the shorter workday and of recent favor- -

able court decisions on laws limiting the hours of
women, a large proportion of wage-earners are still
working 10 or more hours per day for a seven-day
week. The latest data of the Bureau of Labor
show.that in the iron and steel industry 62.6 per
cent. of the blast-furnace workers are still held to
84 hours’ labor per week. Further examples are
given, of excessively long workdays. .

The evil effect of the piecework system and of
working at tasks beyond one’s strength in a par-
ticular industry is shown by a report of examina-
tions made upon shovelers in the zinc mines of
Joplin, Mo., by Dr. A. J. Lanza:

“They had shoveled from two to six years; some
had started when 18 or 19 years of age. Now they
could shovel only 35 or 40 cans, where formerly
they could shovel 60 to 70 and upward. Hard,
constant work had broken these men down, so that
at the ages of 22 to 30 they were already on the
down grade * " ‘. Working thus at their full
earning capacity day in and day out, it is not sur-
prising that with the added exposure to rock dust
these men should contract tuberculosis to an exces-
sive -degree. Especially must this be true when they
start in while under age and before their bodies
have fully developed.”

‘The increasingstrain due to the introduction of
machine methods and to speeding-up practices is
also a potent cause of break-down and illness.

‘Sickness and Death by Occupation.

The morbidity——-the sick-rate——in various occupa-
tions is illustrated by a series of ﬁgures from
American and Austrian sources. Statistics on
occupational mortality are also shown. The lowest
morbidity in the Austrian ﬁgures (which are «classi-
ﬁed by age—periods) is for commercial employees

236 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

NATIONAL DEBTS OF THE WORLD.

According to a statement issued by the Depart-
ment of Commerce in Washington, the national debts
of the world aggregated in 1913 the enormous sum
of $42,000,000,000. They showed an increase of 20
per cent, in 10 years and of 100 per cent. in 40
years. The annual charges (interest, etc.) on these
debts amounted to $1,732,000,000, which was an aver-
age of slightly more than 4 per cent.

No later ﬁgures are yet obtainable. The European
war has, of course, vastly increased the debts of
the warring nations, as shown in the table on a
previous page. '

In many cases, especially among nations having
the best_credit, the interest rates were lower than
4 per cent., but with the weaker nations the rates
were much higher. The average rate paid by the
United States ranged from 2 to 4 per cent.; in Great
Britain it was from 2% to 2% per cent.; in Russia
from 2 to 6 per cent.; in Japan from 4 to 5; in the
German Empire from 3 to 4; in China from 4 to
5; in Nicaragua 6; in Panama 7; in Ecuador from
4 to 10; in Honduras from 5 to 10. Of course, these
rates do not accurately indicate what the loans cost
the governments, inasmuch, as in many cases, es-
pecially with countries of weak credit, the securi-
ties were sold at less than par. '

It appears from the ﬁgures that the nation having 9

the largest national debt is France. Russia comes
next, and then in order are the United Kingdom,
Italy, Spain, British India, Japan and the United
States. Following are the ﬁgures for these and a
few other countries showing the change since 1902,
except for Austria and Hungary, when the totals for
1912 only are given:

THE THIRTY PEACE _TREATIES.

The peace treaties which have been negotiated
by the United States with other nations since
August, 1913, provide 1st, that all disputes of
every kind and character, which cannot be settled
by diplomacy must, if they are not by another tieaty
submitted for arbitration, be submitted to an inter-
national tribunal for investigation and report; 2nd,
that the investigation must be concluded within one
year; 3rd,‘that the contracting parties reserve the

‘right of independent action at the conclusion of the

investigation; but, 4th, that they agree not to “re-‘
sort to force during the investigation.

The following nations have, in the order given,
entered into such treaties with the United States:

\ RECENT INCREASES IN FARM VALUES. ,\

Farm land values are increasing almost by leaps
and bounds, according to ﬁgures made public by the
Department of Agriculture on April 9, 1916. Values
for the United States, taken as a whole, increased
25.7 per cent. in the last four years and 11.5 per
cent. between 1915 and 1916. The figures are based
upon reports from the department’s ﬁeld agents.
The value of farm lands without improvements is
estimated at $45.50 per acre, compared with $40.85
a year ago; $40.31 two years ago; $38.10 tliree years
ago, and $36.23 four years ago. 0

Increases have ‘been general with one or two
notable exceptions in the Northwest. The excep-
tiona} increases of the last year are attributed to
thepreaction in the South following the temporary
depression of the year before, and to the stimulws
of war prices, particularly of grain.

FOREST FIRES, 1915.

Forest ﬁres burned over not quite 300,000 acres
of National Forest land in 1915, according to official
reports given out by the Interior Department on
March 24,1916. Out of a total of 6,324 ﬁres, 346, or
51/2 per cent., did damage to the amount of $100 or
more. i
T The timber loss was $190,000. Over 87 per cent. of
this loss occurred in the States of Oregon, Wash-
ington and Idaho, while more than 72 per cent. was
in Oregon alone. Besides the timber loss, ﬁres de-
stroyed reproduction, or young tree growth, of an
estimated value of $160,000. 1

Lightning ﬁgures as the chief cause
fires in 1915, as it does in the average year.

of forest
Twenty-

‘ 1 eight and a half per cent. of the fires were due to
’ this cause.

/NATIONAL FOREST RECEIPTS, 191,6.

Receipts from National Forests for the ﬁscal year
1916 reached the high-water mark of approximately,
This is $341,000 above the 1915 total.
There was a decided growth in the revenue from all
sources, the largest being that‘of $203,000 in timber
sales. Grazing fees showed a gain of $77,000. Re-
ceipts forwater power development were over $12,000,
more than for 1915. Sales of turpentine privileges
and charges for special uses were both considerably
in excess of the previous year.

While census figures show a decrease for the
whole country in the average size of farms from
1850 to 1.880, an increase is shown for the twofol-
lowing decades. The average for 1910 (138.1) is
higher. than that for both 1890 and 1880. . The aver-
age area of improved land per farm rose steadily:
from 1850 (38.5) to 1890 (57.4). In the next decade
it fell to 49.4, but rose again in 1910 to 54.4. i

The ﬁgures, it must be noted, take into account
the area of a great territory, wherein very different
conditions and tendencies prevail. In some sections
tracts are being broken up for small buyers and es-

“pecially for tenant farmers, while in other sections

concentration'into larger holdings is proceeding
constantly. In\ the West North Central division
(Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas), which contains one‘-
third of the improved farm land of the nation, the
ﬁgures are as follows:

FARM MORTGAGES.

The.,Census Bureau’s report on farm mortgages,
based on the Census of 1910, showsan absolute in-
crease, but a relative decline, in the number of
farm homes owned free, as compared with both 1900
and 1890. There were‘ 6,361,502 farms in the
United States in 1910, but only 3,948,722 were 013-’
erated- by their owners. It is of these farms oper-
ated by owners that the following mortgagestatis-,.

In 1870 there were‘ only 3,400 farms in the United

.States that embraced more than 1,000 acres each.

In 1880 this had.been multiplied’ by nine—nearly
30,000. In 1900 the number of farms containing

ore than 1,000 acres had jumped to 47,160, and in
1 10 to 50,135.

TREES TRANSFORMED INTO PAPER.

"The timber from 3,800 ‘acres of land is converted
into paper"daily in the United States, and -the yearly
product of wood-pulp exceeds 1,300,000 tons.

of 16 to 20 years, who lost but three and one-half

days a year by sickness, and the highest that of
metal and iron-ware factory workers of the 61-65
age period who lost 29% days. In the mortality
tables the tuberculosis rate is used as the best
indicator‘. The American census statistics show that
while among 100 deaths of all ages farmers, plant-
ers and overseers averaged but 6.6 deaths from
tuberculosis, printers, lithographers and pressmen
averaged 29.2 deaths.

Irregularity of employment as a disease-producing
factor is next treated. Testimony before the United
States Commission on Industrial Relations at San
Francisco showed that most of the 7,000 applicants
for work at the Co-operative Employment Bureau
there during one season were of the casual labor
class, and that one-half of them were found to be
incapacitated for work on account of poor nutri-
tion, disease and exposure.

Unhealthful Conditions of Living.

The effect of inadequate diet, bad housing and
generally unfavorable environment in causing dis-
ease is treated at some length. Low wages and
high food prices combine to doom the average wage-
earner’s family to chronic underfeeding. “It is
clearly evident,” say the authors, “that the tendency
during the period 1900-13 has been toward an im-
poverishment of the diet of families with low
incomes.” Bad housing, especially when connected
with overcrowding of population, is a proliﬁc source
of disease. Tuberculosis has been found to be
particularly an incident of bad housing conditions.
As Dr. Osler expresses it, it is a “house disease.”
A survey of the Washington street district in New
York City showed that 57 per cent. of the families
lived in two rooms, and 26 per cent. in three rooms,
many of these families having lodgers-. The death
rate from tuberculosis in this district was found
to be about four times the rate generally prevalent.
Other studiesof New York life reveal even worse
conditions.

The average unskilled wage-worker and his
family, say the authors, live in a community environ-
ment unmistakably less healthful and possessing
fewer conveniences than that of the average person
In working-class
districts there is often a lack of water and sewage
facilities, streets are unpaved or unkempt, and there
is delay in making public improvements. A few
years ago it was shown that more than a million

THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

From a speech by Senator La Follette at Spring~
' I ﬁeld, Ill., January 5, 1912. .
Originally the public domain of the United

States amounted in round numbers to 1,800,000,000

acres. Of this amount nearly all of the original

domain available for agriculture and the greater

‘ part of our mineral wealth outside of Alaska have V
been disposed of, amounting 111 round numbers to

more than 700,000,000 acres. _
Out of the 571,000,000 acres disposed of to ind1—

, viduals and corporations, there have been acquired

through the exercise of the homestead right onl_y
115,000,000 acres. The railroads and other corpora-
tions had bestowed upon them by congressional
grants, without any return whatever to the Govern-
ment, in round numbers 123,000,000 acres.

In addition to that, ‘there has been conferred
upon the railroads by State grants land theretofore
granted by the Federal Government to the several
States, ‘increasing the total grant to the railroads,

‘in round numbers, to 200,000,000 acres of land,

enough to make the Statesriof Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin,

IRRIGATION.

On the 30 reclamation projects undertaken by
the Government there had been expended by June
30, 1916, $122,872,000. The area covered by the
projects when completed is estimated at 3,118,011
acres.\ The Salt River project in Arizona~headed

. the list of expenditures, with $14,150,000, and was

listed as 100 per cent. completed. TWO other projects
——those of Hondo, New Mexico, and Okanogan,
Wash.—Were also listed as entirely completed.
The projects’ involving the largest acreage are those
of Boise, Idaho, 255,000; Milk River, Montana, 219,-

FOREST RESOURCES.

According to the report (1909) of the National
Cdnservation Commission, the forests of the United
States now cover about 550,000,000 acres, or about
one-fourth of the total area. The original forests
covered not less than 850,000,000 acres. ‘

Other estimates give the original forest area as
one billion acres. On the latter basis the follow-
ing ﬁgures are given: ‘

Forests privately owned contain at least four-
ﬁfths of the standing timber. “The timber pri-
vately owned,” says'the C0mmission’s report, “is
not only four times that publicly owned, but it is
generally more valuable.”

RURAL CO-OPERATION.

According to an article by Prof. T. N. Carver, in
the Agricultural Year Book for 1913, there were
in the United States in that year 1,867 farmers’
mutual insurance companies. Pennsylvania had
237,.Illinois 230, Wisconsin 203, Iowa 176, New
York 163, Minnesota, 150 and Ohio 102. These com-
panies, says the writer, “have had a longer his-
tory of uniform success than any other type of
business organizations among our farmers.”

There were also 2,165 co-operative creameries, of
which Minnesota had 632, Wisconsin 355, Iowa 308,
New York 120 and Michigan 105. Many of .these,
it is admitted, are not ‘co-operative in the strict
sense, but joint stock companies. Since, however,
their purpose is not the obtaining of dividends but

3

250 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

the obtaining of better prices, they are considered
as co-operatives.

‘ The number of co-operative cheese factories was
336. Wisconsin led with 247, more than 70 per
cent. of the entire number.

There were 2,020 farmers’ co-operative elevators.
Iowa led with 332, and North Dakota was a close
second with 320. Minnesota had 286, Illinois 260,
Nebraska 224 and South Dakota 220.

THE RURAL CREDITS LAW.
From a statement by the Department of Agriculture.

The Federal farm loan act, popularly called the
“Rural credits law,” was signed by the President
and became a law on July 17, 1916.

The primary purpose of this act is to promote
agricultural prosperity by enabling farmers to bor-
row money on farm—mortgage security at a rea-
sonable rate of interest and for relatively long
periods of time. To attain this object, two farm-
mortgage systems are provided: (1) A system
operating through regional land banks, and (2) a
system operating through joint-stock land banks.

To ‘attract money to the farm—loan ﬁeld the act
provides a method whereby those who have money
to lend can ﬁnd safe investment in the form of
debentures or bonds, of small and large denomi~
nations, issued by the banks and based on the
security of mortgages on farm lands.

These two systems are to be under the general
supervision of a Federal Farm Loan Board in the
Treasury Department, composed of the Secretary
of the Treasury, as chairman ex officio, and four
members appointed by the President. This board
has authority to appoint appraisers, examiners, and
registrars, who will be public officials. ‘

I Federal Land-Bank System.

Under.the Federal land—bank system the act pro-
vides for Federal land banks which make loans,
for the ﬁrst 12 months, exclusively through local

national farm-loan associations composed of bor- ’

rowers. These associations shall be shareholders
in the banks, and in that way the members who
are the borrowers will share in the proﬁts of the
bank. The money for the loans is to come partly
from the capital of the banks, and partly’ from
the sale by the banks of bonds secured by ﬁrst
mortgages on farm lands. The act deﬁnes strictly

__._.__.A A... _._n...._...,.

 

 

ARSENAL or FACTS, 1917. 251

the purposes for and the conditions under which
loans are to be made, and requires that the rate of
interest charged on farm loans shall not exceed
’6 per cent. per annum,

 TWELVE FEDERAL LAND BANKS.

The United States shall be divided into 12 farm-
loan districts, and a Federal land bank with a
subscribed capital stock of not less than $750,000,
each share $5, shall be established in each district.
Each Federal land bank may establish branches in
its district. Within 30 days after the capital stock
is offered for sale it may be purchased at par by
any one. Thereafter, the stock remaining unsold
shall be bought by the Secretary of the Treasury
for the United States. It is provided, however,
that the Government shall not receive any divi-
dends on its stock. Ultimately, it is intended that
all the ‘stock in the banks shall be owned by the
associations of borrowers, and provision therefor
is made in the law for transferring the original
stock at par to these associations.

FARM—LOAN ASSOCIATIONS.

The act provides for the creation of local na-
tional farm-loan associations through which it is
contemplated that the Federal land_ banks shall
make their loans. In the event that a local loan
association is not formed in any locality within a
year, the Federal Farm Loan Board may authorize
a Federal land bank to make loans on farm land
through approved agents. Ten or more persons
who own and cultivate farm land qualiﬁed as
security for a mortgage loan under the act or who
are about to own and cultivate such land, may
form such an association, provided the aggregate
of the loans desired by the membership is not
less than $20,000. Each member must take stock
in his association to an amount equivalent to 5
per cent. of the amount he wishes to borrow. This
stock the association holds in trust as security for
the meinber’s individual loan. The association, in
turn, when applying for money from the bank,
must subscribe for stock in the bank to an amount
equivalent to 5 per cent. of the sum it Wants to
obtain for its- members. This stock is held in trust
by the bank as security for the loans it makes
through the association. If a prospective borrower
has no money with which to pay for his association

 

252 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

stock, he may borrow the price of that stock as
as a part of the loan on his farm land.

Underthis plan, then, every borrower must be
a stockholder in his local association, and every
association a stockholder in its district bank. Each
stockholder in an association is liable for the acts
of that association up to twice the amount of his
stock.

HOW LOANS ARE OBTAINED.

A member of a national farm loan association,
before obtaining a loan, must ﬁrst ﬁll out an ap-
plication blank supplied to the loan association \by
the Federal Farm.Loan Board. This application
blank and other necessary papers will then be re-
ferred to a loan committee of the association which
must appraise the property offered as security.
Such application as is approved by the loan com-
mittee is then forwarded to the Federal land bank
and must be investigated and reported on by a
salaried appraiser of the bank before the loan is
granted. This appraiser is required to investigate
the solvency and character of the prospective bor-
rower as well as the value of his land. When a
loan is granted the amount is forwarded to the
borrower through the loan association.

CONDITIONS FOR OBTAINING LOANS.

The act speciﬁcally deﬁnes the purposes for
which loans may be obtained. These are:

(a) To provide for the purchase of land for
agricultural uses.

(bl To provide for the purchase of equipment,
fertilizers, and livestock necessary for the proper
and reasonable operation of the mortgaged farm;
the term “equipment,” to be deﬁned by the Federal
Farm Loan Board.

(c) To provide buildings and for the improve-
ment of farm lands: the term “improvement” to
be deﬁned by the Federal Farm Loan Board. I

(d) To liquidate indebtedness of the owner of
the land mortgaged, existing at the time of the

organization of the first national farm loan asso-.

ciation established in or for the county in which
the land mortgaged is situated, or indebtedness
subsequently incurred for one of the purposes
mentioned in this section.

Loans may be made only on first mortgages on
farm land.

Only those who own and cultivate farm land

ARSENAL OF_ FACTS, 1917. 253

or are about to own and cultivate such land are
entitled tc borrow; .
No one can borrow save for the purposes stated

in the act, and those who after borrowing do not

use the money for the purposes speciﬁed in the-
mortgage are liable to have their loans reduced
or recalled. The secretary—treasurer of each asso-
ciation is required to report any diversion of bor-
rowed money from the purposes stated in the
mortgages.

No individual can borrow more than $10,000 or
less than $100. “

No loan may be made for more than 50 per
cent. of the value of the land mortgaged and 20
per cent. of the.value of the permanent insured
improvements upon it.

The loan must run for\not less than 5 and not
more than 40 years.

Every mortgage must provide for the repayment
of the loan under an amortization plan by means
of a ﬁxed number of annual or semi—annual install-
ments sufficient to meet all interest and pay ‘off
the debt by the end of the term of the loan. The
installments required will be those published in
amortization tables to be prepared by the Farm
Loan Board.

The bank is given power to protect itself in
case of default by recalling the loan in whole or
in part, or taking other necessary action.

INTEREST RATE PAID BY THE BORROWER.

NolFederal land bank is permitted to charge
more than 6 per cent. per annum on its farm.-
mortgage loans, and in no case shall the interest
charged on farm mortgages exceed by more than
1 per cent. the rate paid on the, last issue of
bonds.

[For example, if the bank pays only 4 per cent.
on an issue of bonds, it cannot charge more than
5 per cent. for the next farm loans it makes.

Out of this margin of not to exceed 1 per cent.,
together with such amounts as it can earn on its
paid-in cash capital, the bank must set aside cer-
tain reserves and meet all its expenses. Any bal~
ance or net proﬁts can be distributed as dividends
to the loan associations or other stockholders. The
loan associations, from their bank dividends, after
setting aside the required reserves and meeting ex-
penses, can declare association dividends to their
members. In this way the proﬁts, if any, will be
distributed among the borrowers and Will, to that

extent, reduce the amount of interest actually

paid by them.
RESTRICTION ON FEES AND COMMISSIOl\I_S.
The Federal land banks are speciﬁcally prohibited
‘from charging, in connection with making a loan,
any fees or commissions which are not authorized
by the Farm Loan Board. The authorized fees

need not be paid in advance, but may be made '

part of the loan.

AMORTIZATION PLAN OF REPAYING LOANS.

It has been said that all loans are to be repaid
on the amortization plan.‘ This plan calls for a
number of ﬁxed annual or semi‘-annual payments,
which include not only all interest and charges due
the bank, but the principal as well. These pay-
ments are so calculated as to extinguish the debt
in a given number of years. After ﬁve years the
borrower has the right on any interest date to
made additional payments on the principal in sums
of $25 or any multiple thereof, thus discharging
the debt more quickly.

The table given below illustrates how a loan of
$1,000, bearing interest at .5 per cent., would be
retired in 20 years by an annual payment of $80.24.
A study of the columns shows how from year to
year the interest is reduced and the proportion of
the payment which goes to discharge the principal
increases. The ﬁnal payment cancels the debt.

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 255

After a Federal land bank has loaned on first
mortgage $50,000, it can obtain permission from
the Farm Loan Board to issue $50,000 in farm
loan bonds based on these mortgages, sell such
bonds in the open market, and use the money thus
obtained to lend on other mortgages.

This process of lending on mortgages and selling
bonds in issues of $50,000 may be repeated until
bonds to the amount of twenty times the bank’s
paid—up capital are outstanding. If each bank
should have only its required minimum paid-up
capital of $750,000, this plan will provide event-
ually, if all the authorized bonds of the 12 banks

are sold, over $180,000.000 to lend on first mo_rt— ~

The banks, however, can in-
crease their capital stock above the required mini-
mum and so increase the amount of bonds they
can sell, and thus increase the total amount of
money available for loans on farm mortgages.
To make these bonds attractive to investors, the
bonds, together with the mortgages upon which
they are based, are exempted from Federal, State,
municipal, and local taxation and are made legal
investments for fiduciary and trust funds. ‘The
capital stock of the Federal land banks is also ex-
empt from taxation. Federal reserve banks and
member banks of that system are empowered to
'buy and sell these bonds. They are to be issued
in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.

gages on farm land.

ORGANIZATION OF BANKS.

The temporary management of the Federal land
banks is to be in the hands of five directors ap-
pointed by the Federal Farm Loan Board. As

_i however, as

soon,
the subscriptions from the loan
associations total $100,000 regular directors are to
be appointed as ~fol1ows: Three district directors,
resident in the district, shall be appointed by the
Federal Farm Loan Board to represent the public
interest, and six local directors, resident in the
district, shall be elected by the farm loan associa-
tions who must be stockholders in the bank. The
‘Federal Farm Loan Board shall designate one of
its appointees to act as chairman. The act re-
quires that at least one of the three district direc-
tors shall be experienced in farming and actually
engaged at the time of his appointment in farm-
ing operations within the district. Any compensa-

" tion paid to the directors must be approved by the 5

Federal Farm Loan Board.

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

OFFICERS  LOAN ASSOCIATIONS..

Each loan association must have a board of
directors and a secretary—treasurer. The directors‘
shall serve without pay. The secretary~treasurer
shall receive such compensation as may be deter-
mined by the board of directors. The association
must appoint an appraisal committee for the pur-
pose of valuing lands offered as security for loans.
No member of such committee shall have any inter-
est in the property upon which he passes.

FUNDS FOR CURRENT EXPENSES.

To provide funds for current expenses, the loan
association may retain as a commission from each
interest payment not to exceed one-eighth of 1 per
cent. semi—annually upon the unpaid principal of
the loan. This commission is to be deductedwfrom

» the dividends payable to such farm loan associa-

\

 

tion by the Federal land bank. If the commissions
are not adequate, and an association does not wish
to assess members for current expenses, ‘it may
borrow at 6 per cent. from the Federal land bank
to an amount not to exceed in the aggregate one-
fourth of its bank stock,

RESERVES AND DIVIDENDS.

The law requires both the land banks and the
farm loan associations to make provision for cer-
tain reserves before they can pay any dividends.

AGENTS AND LAND BANK-S.

In sections Where local conditions do not make
the formation of associations practicable, the
Farm Loan Board may authorize the Federal land
bank to make loans through agents approved by
the board. These agents are to be banks, trust
companies, mortgage companies, or savings insti-
tutions, chartered by/”the State. They may receive
as compensation the actual expense involved in
transacting the loan and in addition thereto a
sum not to exceed one-half of 1 per cent. per
annum on the unpaid principal of the loans made
through them. When the Farm Loan Board de-
cides that a locality is adequately served by farm
loan associations, no further loans are to be made
through agents.

J oint-Stock Land Banks.

In addition to the system of 12 Federal land
banks and the national farm loan associations of‘

 

  

 

 

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. V 257

\

borrowers, the act permits the establishment of
joint-stock land banks and authorizes them to
carry on the business of lending directly to bor-
rowers on farm-mortgage security and issuing farm
loan bonds. These banks must have a capital of
not less than $250,000. They are under the super-
vision of the Federal Farm Loan Board, but ‘the
Government does not lend them any ﬁnancial as-
sistance.

The joint-stock land bank is free from many of
the conditions imposed on the Federal land banks.
Subject to the 50 and 20 per cent. value limitation
and the limitation as to territory, the joint-stock
land bank maylend more than $10,000 to a single
individual, and it is not restricted to making loans
for the purposes speciﬁed in the case of the
Federal land bank. .

The joint-stock bank, like the Federal land
banks, cannot charge an interest rate on farm
mortgages in excess of 6 per cent., nor shall such
interest rate exceed by more than 1 per cent. the
rate of interest paid by the bank upon its last
issue of bonds. A joint-stock bank is limited in
its bond issue to 15 times its capital and surplus.

Among the restrictions placed on these banks
under the act. are (1) that their mortgages must
provide for an amortization system of repayment
such as is prescribed in the case of loans through
the Federal land banks, and (2) that they shall
in no case demand or receive under any form or
pretense any commission or charge not speciﬁcally
authorized by the act and approved by the Farm
Loan Board,

The bonds of the joint-stock land banks are ex-

empted from taxation. Their capital stock, how-

ever, is not exempted.
General Provisions.

The law, through the Farm Loan Board, provides
the necessary machinery for frequent examinations
of the banks and the associations, for the proper
cancellation of mortgages, and for the safe custody
of mortgages offered as security for bonds. When

‘any mortgage offered as security for bonds is

withdrawn, the bank is required to replace the
security with other mortgages or with other satis-
factory collateral.

Heavy penalties of ﬁne or imprisonment, or both,

are imposed for violations of the act, malefeasance
in office, fraud, embezzlement, defalcation or other
illegal practices.

THE RURAL CREDIT GOLD BRICK.

By P. S._ NAGLE.

The much xheralded farmers’ rural credit bill is
now the law of the land. It was signed by the
President on July 17, 1916. Hip, hip, hurrah for
the Democratic party, Woodrow Wilson, Robert L.
Owen, T. P. Gore, Scott Ferris et a1.! No more
shall the 120,000 tenant farmers of Oklahoma live
in “pole pen” and one-room shacks with a “leanto.”
No more saleratus biscuit, sorghum molasses and
alkali water for the tenant farmer——it is beefsteak
and pork chops now. The act is known as public
No. 158»

This act covers twenty-nine pages of closely
printed matter. It is involved, intricate, mislead-
ing and_ crooked. Like all capitalist measures pur-
porting to be for the relief of the working class,
the doors are left wide open for hostile judicial
construction. In the caption is one naked truth;
it says the bill was passed “to create standard
forms of investments based upon farm mortgages.”
The billions of dollars made by American capital-
ists in the last two years, selling munitions and
supplies, is seeking a ﬁeld for investment, and farm
bonds at 6 per cent. look good to them. ‘The
the farm mortgage “standard-
ized” like a United States bond before he puts
out his money. ’

Will this so-called “Federal Farm Loan Act”
help the tenant farmer? Not in the least, He has
no land to mortgage; he has no assets—-and the
probability is he never will have under the exist-
ing or er. “For whosoever hath, to him shall be
given, and he shall have more abundance, but who-
soever hath not, from him, shall be taken away
even that he hath not.” \

_ Will it not help the mortgaged farmer, who owns
and occupies his own land? It will not. It is un-
workable. It will take ﬁve or six years to show
that it is unworkable, and then there will be an-
other period of investigation, and before any relief
can be had the small farmer will be closed out and
marching in the ranks of the tenant farmer. The

bill is only a sham and passed solely for election‘
purposes.

When the President signed the. bill a group of ,

“farmer skate politicians” were present and ap-
plauded loudly as Wilson affixed his signature.

The official organ of the American Society of
Equity is The Organized Farmer, with H. G. Tank
as editor. J. P. Tumulty, priva_te secretary to the
President, sent the following telegram: ,
“Washington, D. C., July 14, 1916.

“H. G. Tank, Wassau, Wis.

“The President expects to sign the Rural Credits
Bill at 10 o’clock Monday morning, July 17th. He
has invited a number of gentlemen who are inter-
ested to come in at that time and he would be
glad to have you present if it is agreeable to you.

“J. P. TUMULTY, See.”

The reply was as follows: ’

“J. P. Tumulty, Sec., Washington, D. C.
“Please say to the President that had Congress

passed a Rural Credits Bill favored by the real

 

farmers of America it would have been an honor
to be present when he attached his signature to
a bill of such vital importance to every citizen.
As it is I must respectfully decline the invitation
to sanction by my presence a bill that is at its
very best a makeshift.

cent. over $18,428,270,000 in 1909. The average
capital per establishment was approximately $83,000
in 1914 and $69,000 in 1909. -

The cost of materials usedwas $14,368,089,000 in
1914, as against $12,142,791,000 in 1909, an increase
of $2,225,298,000, or 18.3 per cent.

The value of products was $24,246,323,000 in 1914
and $20,672,052,000 in 1909, the increase being
$3,574,271,000, or 17.3 per cent. The average per
establishment was approximately $88,000 in 1914
and $77,000, in 1909.

The value added by manufacture was $9,878,-
234,000 in 1914 and $8,529,261,000 in 1909, the in-

‘crease being $1,348,973',000, or 15.8 per cent. The

value added by manufacture formed 40.7 per cent.
of the total value in 1914, and 41.3 per cent in 1909.

LABOR AND PRODUCTION IN THE STEEL
INDUSTRY.

From report of Stanley Committee, Aug. 2, 1912.——-
Rep. 1127, 62d Congress, 2d Ses.

The evidence submitted to the committee on the
matter of labor is instructive and impressive.

A most important economic fact brought out and
too often overlooked is that the true measure of a
man's work is the tonnage produced per man. per
day, and not the mere amount of wage paid. The
true economic unit is the tonnage produced per
man, and‘not the wage paid per man. This is a,
most important fact, never to be lost sight of in
the all-important question of cost production. '

A most illuminating piece of reliable informa-

production ?

internal affairs of the tate of Pennsylvania’ on
the production and cost of pig iron, which we

It will be seen. from the above that in 1909, 14,921
men produced 10,721,024 tons of pig iron, as against
8,111,642 tons produced in 1902 by 17,101 men.

Who got the beneﬁt of this enormous increase in
True, there was some increase in the
wages.’ In 1902 the average earnings per year for
each man was $595.97, while in 1909 ‘the average
earnings per year for each man was $627.20. Or,
to put it in daily wages, an increase of from $1.89
in 1902 to $2.09 in 1909———an increase of $0.20 per
day.

But, observe the increase in production, and the
decrease in cost of labor per ton, “the true meas-
ure,” according to Mr. Schwab.

In 1902 the cost of labor per ton was $1.25, while I

in 1909 it was only 82 cents. _.

Again, observe the tonnage produced per man
in 1902 and 1909.

In 1902 the tonnage per man was 1.51 tons, while
in 1909 it was increased to 2.39 tons per man.

In other words, not only was the cost of labor
per ton reduced from $1.25 to $0.82, but at the same
time the tonnage per man produced was increased

. from 1.51 tons to 2.39 tons.

In 1902 the manufacturers produced 8,111,642 tons
of pig iron-at a cost of labor per ton of $1.25;

264 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

while in 1909 they produced 10,721,024 tons of pig
iron at a cost of labor per ton of $0.82.

In 1902 the aggregate wages paid to produce
8,111,642 tons of pig iron was $10,191,757, while in
1909 the aggregate wages paid to produce 10,721,024
tons was $8,762,304, a saving to the manufacturers
1n labor cost of $1,429,455. ,

Furthermore, _the realized value of the 8,111,642
tons. produced in 1902 was $126,857,231; while the
realized value of the 10,721,024 tons produced in
1909 was $186,963,842, an increase for the manufac-
turers of $60,106,611 in realized value.

On the other hand, what did labor get in the,
same period? In 1902 the average earnings per
year for each man was $595.97, while in 1909 it
was $627.20, an increase per man of $31.23 per year,
and as the table shows, an increase in.average
daily wage from $1.89 to $2.09, of $0.20 per day“
This shows a slight increase per man in wages
between 1902 and 1909. But how about the total?
In 1902 there were employed 17,101 men; in 1909,
14,921 men, a decrease of 2,180 men employed. In
1902 the aggregate wages paid were $10,191,759; in
1909 the aggregate wages paid were $8,762,304, 21
decrease in wages paid of $1,429,455.

That, these statistics of the report of the secre-
tary of internal affairs are correct is corroborated
by Mr. Schwab, former president of the Steel Cor-
poration, by his sworn testimony, on page 1356.

“PLUCK ME” STORES OF THE STEEL TRUST.

From report of the Stanley Committee, August 2,.
1912.—Rep. 1127, 62d Congress, 2d es.

As bearing on the question of employees, the pol-
icy of the Steel Corporation in regard to the estab-
lishment of the company supply stores is important.
The evidence before the committee shows that it
is the custom of the company where steel and iron
plants are established and towns and vil ages grow
up around the company’s plants, through a subsi-
diary company known as the Union Supply Co.,
to open stores to supply its employees with gro-
ceries, provisions, and almost every article of

household necessity, together with powder, fuse and

other supplies——1n fact everything the employees
need, either to live or conduct their operations as
employees of the company,

The local grocer, baker, meat and fish dealer,
apothecary, blacksmith, carpenter, coal, wood, and
other dealers are thus brought into direct compe-

tition with the Steel Corporation stores. It may be
said that this is only the application of fair and
free competition.
company stores have great advantages. They deal
with their own employees, who constitute 90 per
cent of their. custom. To be sure the employees are
not obliged by any law or rule of the company to
buy at the company store, but it is undoubtedly
true that they all understand they will be the bet-
ter considered for doing so. The company supply
store knows just what is coming in wages every
day and week to each employee. who deals at the
company store. No other local competitor has the
beneﬁt of this information. This enables the com-
pany’s supply store to extend credit only to the ex-
tent of wages actually due or earned. The result
is practically an actual cash business, with no
losses in bad debts.

The fact that the Steel Corporation does not at-
tempt to maintain these supply stores except where
it deals with its own employes shows pretty con-
clusively that it has no desire to engage in such
trade under ordinary conditions in ordinary-com-
petition. It limits its stores to places where it

‘ deals almost wholly with its own employees.

The proﬁts made and dividends declared to the
Steel Corporation by this system of supply stores
we think are pertinenttand suﬂ"icient to show a
prosperity entirely out of the ordinary.

This supply company was organized in March,
1902, about a year after the Steel Corporation it-
self. Its capital stock is $500.000. Its corporate
name is Union Supply Co.. and it is one of the sub-
sidiary companies of the United States Corporation.

In 1903 this $500.000 subsidiary corporation de-
clared a dividend of $250,000, and in subsequent
years as follows:

1910 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 520,000

It will thus be seenthat this corporation earned
and pa-id its parent company, the United States
Steel Corporation, in‘ dividends a total of $3,490,000

in eight years on retail supplies sold almost wholly '

to its own employees.

MINES,’ QUARRIES AND WELLS.
Compiled from a report of the Census, 1912.

In the United States, exclusive of Alaslia, Hawaii,
Porto Rico and other outlying non—contiguous ter-
ritory, in 1909, 23,682 operators conducted 27,240
mines and quarries and 166,448 petroleum and _nat—
ural gas wells. This number included 6,958 indi-
viduals, 7,040 partnerships, 9,449 incorporated com-
panies and 235 others. Of these operators, 19,933
operated enterprises which were productive in 1909,
while 3,749 operators were engaged solely in de-
velopment work. A 4

The gross value of all products was $1,238,410,322.
This amount includes a duplication of $29,318,316,
representing the value of ore and natural gas proa
duced by one operator and used as material by any
other. With this amount deducted from the gross
value there remains $1,209,092,006 as the net value
of the products. The value of products given for

each mining industry often includes the value of
s-ome products not covered by the industry desig-
nation. For example, the crude product of metal1if—
erous mines may include varying combinations of
metals, such as gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and
iron.

The total number of persons engaged in these
industries, as reported on December 15, 1909, or
nearest representative day, was 1,139,332; of whom
wage-earners numbered 1,065,283, proprietors and
firm members, 29,922, and salaried employes, 44,127.
In mines, quarries and wells for which development
Work only was carried on there were a total of
27,616 persons, of whom 21,499 were wage-earners.
Of the total number of persons, 1,166,948, employed
in productive and non-productive mines, 1,158,775
were men sixteen years of age and over, and 8,173
were boys under sixteen years of age. Distributed
by sex, 1,162,840 were_ male, and 4,108 female, the

latter being employed in supervisory and clerical"

capacities, none being reported as wage-earners in
mining operations proper. Of the proprietors and

ﬁrm members 9,937 performed manual labor in con—.

nection with the operation of the mine. _

--The total net product was $1,209,092,006. Wage-
earners were paid $586,774,079, or 48.5 per cent. of
this. Other expenditures, a considerable part of
which "went to capital in one form or another, were

a net surplus of $166,449,313.

The average yearly pay of the wage-earners was a
triﬂe less than $551. In the factories, as we have
previously shown, the average was _$518.

The report shows that in 1909, 7.1 per cent. of all
the establishments produced 84.6 per cent. of the

MINERAL PRODUCTION, 1915.

The value of the mineral production of the United
States in 1915, according to preliminary ﬁgures
published by the United States Geological Survey,
on July 22, 1916, was approximately $2,373,000,000,
a gain of $258,000,000, or more than 12 per cent.,
over 1914. The value for 1915 has been exceeded

6,017,457,366

but once—in 1913—when a total of $2,439,000,000

est value ever recorded, having advanced from $691,-
000,000 in 1914 to $987,500,000 in 1915~a gain of
nearly 43 per cent. The value of the non—metallic
products in 1915 has been exceeded in 1913 and 1914
only, showing in 1915 a decrease of less than 3 per
cent. from the precedin year. The ﬁgures for 1914
and 1915 are $1,423,00 ,000 and $1,385,000,000, re-
spectively.

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION, 1915.

The United States Geological Survey, in a report
of October 2, 1916, gives the amount of natural gas
produced during the calendar year 1915 as 628,-
578,842 thousand cubic feet, with an average value
of 16.12 cents per thousand cubic feet. The total
value was $101,312,381. West Virginia, Pennsyl-
vania and Ohio, in the order named, were the heav-
iest producers,- while Iowa produced the smallest
quantity.
THE WORLD’S COAL RESERVES.

The world is still rich in coal. Very detailed

‘ .reports recently issued by the International Geo-

logic Congress present data on the-total reserves of
the world. The following table summarizes the ﬁnal
ﬁgures as g1ven.1n these reports. It includes known
reserves of all kinds and grades of coal, arranged
by continents, in millions of tons.

The total known coal reserves of the world, _of
all classes, amount, therefore, to over seven mil-
lion million tons. As the world’s annual consump-
tion of coal is not at present more than about four-
teen hundred million tons, it can be seen that the
total supply provided for some ﬁve thousand years
more of coal, at the existing rate of consumption.
As a matter of fact, however, two things check ex-
cessive optimism. The rate of consumption is still
steadily increasing each decade‘; and much of the
coal contained in the reserves is either of very low
grade or else poorly located, '

CALUMET AND HECLA PROFITS.
From report of the Socialist Investigating Committee.

It has a capital stock of $2,500,000, of which less
than half, or only $12 of each $25 share has ever
been paid in. That is to say, the cash actually in-
vested in it has been $1,200,000. On this investment
has been paid, to and including 1912, dividends to
the amount of $112,500,000, or $1,125 a share, or
about $100 of proﬁts for every dollar of investment.
The actual report, February 27, 1913, gave the value
of each share as $540, $12 having been paid for it.

RAILWAY SHAREHOLDERS.

The Bureau of Railway Economics, which is not a
bureau but a private organization maintained by the
railroads in Washington, issued a statement in July,
1916, giving the total number of railway share-
holders as 626,122, The report covered 1,285 rail-
way companies, with an operated mileage of 257,211
miles, practically all.

The bureau admits, however, that the number is
in excess of the actual number of individuals hold-
ing shares. If an individual is a shareholder in a
half-dozen railways he is listed six times. The
actual number of shareholders is therefore not indi-
cated by these ﬁgures. It is probably not in excess
of the number of persons who pay income tax, some
357,000.

~ THE. RAILWAY POSTAL GRAFT.

The following table, giving a comparison of the
railroad rates for carrying mail, freight and ex-
press, was prepared by Prof. Henry C. Adams,
statistician of the United States Postal Commis-
sion (generally known as the Wolcott Commis-
sion.) Some revisions have since been made (1907),

‘The railroad rate for mail, however, is’ much
higher than shown in the foregoing table. The
Government is cheated in the weighing of the
mails, and is charged exorbitant rent_for the use
of the mail cars. The Government paid an average
rental of $3,500 for each postal car. The average
original cost of a wooden mail car is between
$6,500 \and $7,000. Taking al-l this into considera-
tion, the cost of carrying mail is probably eight
or nine times» the cost of carrying express matter._

THE ALTON STEAL.

The Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906 in-
vestigated the Chicago & Alton railway among

 others and made the following remarks in its offi-

cial report:

“In about seven years, to June 1, 1906, the out-
standing capital indebtedness of this company was
expanded from $33,951,407 to $114,610,937, or an in-
crease of about $80,000,000, and there was expended
in actual improvements out of this capitalization
only about $18,000,000, leaving an increase of its
stock and liabilities, without one dollar of ‘consid-
eration, of about $62,600,000, or $66,190 per mile on
the 946.66 miles of road owned by this company
on June 30, 1906.” '

Mr. Harriman, then chief owner of the road, on
the stand testiﬁed that there were about sixty mil-

lions of stocks and liabilities issued, against which
A no property had been acquired.

Subsequent investigation by the Appeal to Rea-
son led to the discovery that the issuance of this
excessive stock was made legal by a special bill
passing the New York legislature, February 26,
1900, making the securities of the railroad legal
securities for savings banks. This law enabled the
Chicago & Alton to ﬂoat the stocks. It transpired,
too,~that Theodore Roosevelt, then governor of
New York, signed the bill which made the steal '
possible. This was interesting, from the fact that
Roosevelt had severely denounced the steal when‘
it was exposed. The Appeal secured a photograph
of the bil.l and his signature, and offered $5,000
for proof that he did not sign it, but there were
no takers. After much prodding Roosevelt, in an
article in the Outlook, admitted that he did sign
the bill, but tried to excuse himself on the ground
that he did not know it involved a steal. But it
‘was his business to know. The watered stock
made possible by this bill is still in existence and
cannot be told from the honest stock of the road.

THE RAILROADS, 1915 AND 1916.

A The railroads had their most prosperous year dur-
ing the twelve months ended June 30, 1916. The
official ﬁgures of the-Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion will not be available for months, but estimates
. based on preliminary ﬁgures show that for the ﬁrst
time in railroad history what is known as “operat-
ing income” crossed the one-billion line. “Operat-
ing income” is the revenue minus operating expenses
and taxes. The record for gross earnings was also
scored, with upward of three and one-half billions’,
against three and one-eighth billions, the previous
high ﬁgure, in 1913. Preliminary ﬁgures for the
Class I roads, which include 90 per cent. of the total
mileage and 95 per cent. of the total revenues, show
the following result:

mile /is put“ at $4,530, against $3,158, $3,871 and
$3,665 respectively for the three preceding years.
The year 1915, on the other ‘hand, was an off year
for the railroads. 1
Dividends were paid on only 60.45 per cent. of the
stock, against 64.89 the previous year and 67.65 (the
record) in 1911. Though earnings were phenomenal
during the last half of the year (the ﬁrst half of

Kthe calendar year), the depression of the summer

and fall of 1914 told heavily in the summing up of
accounts at the end of June.

WHAT LABOR GETS FROM THE RAILROADS.

One frequently hears or reads the statement that
more than 70 per cent. of the railroad revenues are
expended for labor and material. The statement is
misleading. There is no reason for lumping ma-
terial with labor, since virtually all material pur-
chased by the railroads has already paid from two
to ﬁve capitalist proﬁts in the various transactions
through which it has passed. The share of labor in
railroad revenues cannot be absolutely determined,
but thanks to the ﬁgures of the Interstate Com-
merce Commission, it can be approximated.

In the following computation the ﬁgures for 1912
are used, because in the 1913 ﬁgures the compensa-

tion paid by the Southern Paciﬁc Co. (approximat— _

ing $35,000,000) is missing. The gross revenues
were as follows:
Rail operations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$2,842,695,382

Outside operations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 63,720,487
~ Other income. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 89,180,406
Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$2,995,596,275

Of this,sum the amounts paid to all classes of
employees (except general officers and other officers,

3 who drew $41,502,574), was $1,210,845,123, or 40.4

per cent. Even this sum includes $147,000,000
paid under the classiﬁcation, “all other employees
and laborers,” which includes most if not all of the
many persons engaged as spotters, provoking agents,
spies, secret service men, lobbyists, publicity agents,
lawyers (other than general counsel),.claim agents
and others who in the main do no useful labor but
perform only an anti-social service. Were it possi-
ble to eliminate the compensation of these persons
from the ﬁgures,'the share of useful labor in the

gross railroad revenues would probably be found to .

be about 38 per cent.

Let us see, on the other‘ hand, what the idle .

24 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

Summary and Conclusions.

The main text of the pamphlet closes with the
following summary and conclusions (to which are
added four valuable appendices giving information
regarding health—insurance systems):

“1. The fact that health insurance has been so
generally adopted in European countries as a solu-
tion of the problems of the wage-earner’s health
suggests its serious consideration in this country as
a measure for the relief and prevention of sickness.

“2. At present each of the 30,000,000 wage-
earners in the United States, according to available
data, loses about nine days each year on account of
sickness. Estimating the loss in wages at $2 a day
and the cost of medical attention at $1 a day, the
total loss to the wage-earners of the nation is
approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars
annually.

“3. In addition to conditions which affect the
health of the population as a whole, some of the
most important economic factors which increase
the health hazard of the wage—working population
are: (a) Occupational hazards; (bi) irregularity of
employment; (c) unhealthful conditions of living;
(d) employment of women under modern conditions
of work, particularly of married Women; and (e)
economic disadvantages at which a large proportion
of wage-workers (particularly the unskilled) and
their families are placed as the result of low wages
and insufficient annualincome.

“4. Underlying all of the economic factors is
the fact of poverty and the partnership of poverty
and disease. .

“5. Three groups——employers, the public, and
employees—are responsible for conditions causing
sickness among wage-earners and their families.

“6. With few exceptions, the responsibility of
employers for the health of employees is limited to
places of employment and working conditions.

“7. The public is responsible for community
conditions or conditions common to all classes of
citizens.

“8. The greatest share of responsibility rests
upon the individual wage-earner. Under present
conditions a large proportion are unable to meet
this responsibility, especially the unskilled, low-
paid workers. '

“9. The inability of the wage-earner to meet the
cost of sickness places a serious handicap upon the

capitalist gets. The dividends paid in 1912 amounted
to $400,315,313, interest on funded debt $429,026,-
729 and interest on current liabilities $25,409,689.
The total is $854,751,731, or 28.9 per cent of the
gross revenues, and is almost equivalent to the total
net revenue from rail and outside operations
($871,005,294.)

THE PENNSYLVANIA’S PRIVATE ARMY.

During the hearing before the Industrial Rela-
tions Commission in Washington, May 5, 1915, W.
W. Atterbury, vice—president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company, was questioned regarding the
reported existence of a private army of thugs and
spies in the employ of the company.

“Is the company always in a state of prepared-
ness for any industrial Warfare that might spring
up?” ‘asked Mr. Walsh, “such as having‘"men and
arms and clubs on hand?’’

“We are always prepared for anything the other
fellow is getting ready for, I can assure you,” Mr.
Atterbury replied. ,

“HoW many riﬂes do you keep on hand?”

“I don’t know that we keep any, but we have
everything that is legal that is necessary to keep
on hand to protect the running of our trains.”

“Shouldn’t the control of armed forces, in your
opinion, rest with the State?” Mr. Walsh asked.

“Theoretically, yes, but practically I doubt if you
can ever arrive at that solution.”

In his formal statement presented to the Com-
mission, Mr. Atterbury admitted the existence of
a force of “conﬁdential investigators.”

Of the activity of the confidential employees, the
statement declared: .

“Conﬁdential investigators are also employed to
identify themselves as employees in various de-
partments to secure correct information as to any
efforts of labor organizers among employees which
tend to destroy the harmony and friendly feeling
which for many years have generally existed be-
tween} this company and its employees. Many labor
organizers make special efforts to organize the
foreign-born employees and the susceptibility of this
class of employees to inﬂammatory speeches of labor
agitators requires that necessary precaution be taken
to eliminate as far’ as possible the causes of dis-
satisfaction.” \

medical profession in its efforts for the relief and
prevention of disease.

“10. There is an increasing need for a more
effective method of dealing with the problem of the
wage-earner’s health—one which will place the bur-
den of responsibility where it belongs and stimulate
the co-operation of all concerned in its solution.

“11. Health insurance is the most feasible measure
because (a) it is a method by which the cost of
sickness is distributed among those responsible for
conditions causing sickness and whereby the burden
upon the individual is lightened, and (b) it gives
a ﬁnancial incentive for the prevention of sickness
to those who are responsible for conditions causing
sickness.

“12. "Health insurance in its most highly
developed form (a) ‘provides for adequate cash and
medical beneﬁts to all wage-earners in times of sick-
ness; . (b) distributes the,cost among employers, the
public, and wage-earners according to their respon-
sibilities; (c) becomes an eﬁective health measure
by stimulating the co—operative effort of the three
responsible groups,and by linking their efforts with
those of national, state and local health agencies;
(d) correlates all the forces at work in the preven-
tion of disease; and (e) affords a better basis for
the co-operation of the medical profession.

“13. Under an efficient health-insurance system
a contribution of approximately 50 cents per week
per insured person (25 cents by employees, 20 cents
by employers, and 5 cents by Government) should
enable the insured person to receive (a) $7 per week
when disabled on account of sickness or non-
industrial accident for a period as long as 26 weeks
in_ one year; (b) adequate medical and surgical care
during disability; (c) medical and surgical care of
wife of insured person during conﬁnement; (d) a
death ‘beneﬁt of $100. Budgetary studies of large
numbers of workin,gmen’s families show that many
workers pay as high as 90 cents per week and
receive little more than actual funeral expenses.

“14. A governmental system of health insurance
can be adapted to American conditions, and when
adapted will prove to be a health measure of
extraordinary value.

“The fact that under such a system the employee
has such a large measure of ownership and control
will remove all elements of paternalism. The em-
ployee will then regard the beneﬁts as rights, not
charities.

288 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

 

TRUSTS AND TR-UST MAGNATES.

THE TRUSTS.

In his volume, “The Truth About the Trusts”
(1904), John Moody stated that there were then
more than 400,, large industrial, franchise and
transportation trusts, with a total ﬂoating capital
of more than twenty billion dollars. Seventy-eight
of these trusts controlled 50 per cent. or more of
the product of the industry, 57 controlled 60 per
cent., and 26 controlled \80 per cent. The degree
of control ran from 10 to 95 per cent.

Later Mr. Moody revised his ﬁgures, bringing
them up to January 1, 1908. In that time the num-
ber of plants acquired or controlled had increased
by about 2,200, and the amount of capitalization by
more than eleven billion dollars. The ﬁgures for
the. two years are as follows:

Growth of Standard Oil Proﬁts.. /

The market value of Standard Oil securities is
today $1,300,000,000, or 1,300 times the capital of
the original Standard Oil Company in 1870. The
.capital then was $1,000,000. Fully $800,000,000
’has been distributed ‘in cash dividends by Stand-
ard Oil since that time, Rockefel1er’s share alone
exceeding $200,000,000.

Fully $200,000,000 has been added to the capitali-
zation of the various Standard Oil Companies out
of earnings, in addition to cash dividends.

Following the dissolution decree of the U. S.

‘Supreme ‘Court in 1912, Standard Oil distributed

greater wealth than ever among its stockholders.
In .1913 its dividends were: Cash, $107,795,377;
stock, $81,900,000, and rights, $2,500,000——a total of
$192,195,377.

STANDARD 0IL’S INCOME.

The Wall Street Journal some time ago placed
the net proﬁts of the Standard Oil Company for
the previous twenty—ﬁve,years and six months at
$929,000,000. ;This sum is so stupendous that the
average mind cannot comprehend just what it rep-

/resents. In order to make a comparison, the enor-

mous incomes of the European rulers may be taken

‘together and multiplied by 2”/2.

The latest published civil lists furnish the figures
given below. It should, be noted that most of the

V Czar’s revenue comes out of his extensive private 1

domains. The German Emperor has also vast pri-
vate domains which add greatly to his income,
while the King of England and the Prince of Wales
receive some $700,000 yearly from the duchies of
Lancaster and Cornwall additional to their civil
grants. The War has probably greatly diminished
all private revenues. Other than in the case of the
Czar the sums mentioned represent annual gov-
ernmental grants:

MORGAN’S RECOMPENSE. ~
From a report of the Commissioner of Corporations
in Sen. Doc. 301, 62nd Congress. 2d Session.

When the steel trust was organized in 1901 the
value of all the tangible assets acquired by it was
$682,000,000. This property was capitalizedfor the
enormous total of $1,402,864,817, the capitalization

being more than half water and /exceeding the

actual value of the property by $720,846,817. The
syndicate which put through this enormous deal
was managed by J. P. Morgan. This syndicate‘
provided about $28,000,000 in cash to swing the
deal, and for this cash consideration, plus its un-
derwriting services, it received from the steel cor-
poration 1,300,000 shares of its stock, having an
aggregate par value of $130,000,000. This stock
realized approximately $90,500,000, leaving as proﬁt
to the syndicate, over and above its $28,000,000
cash expenditure, a net sum of $62,500,000. Of this
sum one-ﬁfth, or $12,500,000, went to Morgan for

DOUBLES FATHER’S FORTUNE.

The complete appraisal of the estate of the late
John Pierpont Morgan, made on Aug. 6, 1916,
showed that the ﬁnancier was worth $73,149,000, of
which $53,684,918 went to the present J. P. Morgan.
The present Morgan ﬁrm is said to have made as
much money during the past two years as the
old head of the house made during his Whole
career. Under its contract with the British Gov-
ernment, the ﬁrm has received a commission of 2

per cent. on all purchases of munitions and sup-

plies, aggregating not less than $2,000,000,000. The
ﬁrm has also received a banking commission on all
loans aggregating $1,500,000,000 placed for foreign
governments. There have been further commis-
sions in selling American securities for the British
» Government and still more commissions as well as
interest on call loans.

HOW THE PRICE OF COFFEE WAS RAISED.
(From Pear‘son’s Magazine, October, 1911.)

In December, 1908, the price of No. 7 Rio coffee
in New York was 61/2 cents a pound. In January,
1911, the same grade of coffee in the same market
sold at 131-3 cents a pound, an increase in two
years of more than 100 per cent. This rate was
caused by an arrangement entered into by the
Brazilian government and a group of ﬁnancial ban-
dits, of which J. P. Morgan & Co. are the American
representatives, wherebythe coffee crop of Brazil
is cornered and held out of the market so as to
enable this combination to regulate the price of
cotfee throughout the world. After the formation
of the combination the Brazilian government sent
its agents throughout the coffee districts destroying
growing trees so as to keep down the supply. The
government also has a law limiting: the export of

coffee. It was recently proposed to replace this
law by a new law creating anvexport tax of 10 per
cent. on all exports of coffee, the tax to be paid
in kind and the coffee thus collected to be burne .
This scheme was not carried out because it was
not found necessary to support the monopoly. Coffee
can be proﬁtably produced at a price of 4 cents a

\ pound,

THE TENNESSEE STEAL.

One of the greatest steals in history happened
while Roosevelt was President. It was a fitting
companion to his famous Alton steal bill, signed

' by him as Governor of New York. In November,

 

1907, the steel trust had but one rival, the Tennessee
Coal and Iron Company, which refused to merge.
It was made all the more formidable because Harri-
man placed all his orders for steel rails with it.
The steel trust, backed by the Morgan and Hill
interests, arranged to crush this rival company. In
the midst of the machinations a Heinze bank unex-
pectedly failed. Wall Street was thrown into a
furor. Call money went to 70, 80 and ﬁnally to

 

100 per cent. It looked like a great panic was ,

near.

It is against the, law for any company or com-
bination to control more than 60 per cent. of any
commodity, but the steel trust sent emissaries to
Roosevelt, then President, asked him to keep his
hands off, while the steel trust bought enough
stock of the Tennessee company to allay the panic.
This Roosevelt did, though he was afterward cen-
sured by a congressional committee for having done
it. .Finally the steel trust crowd secured the Ten-
nessee _properties for less than $35,000,000, plus
Rockefeller’s commission for assisting in the deal.
Morgan afterward declared that the properties ac-
quired were worth at least a billion dollars! The
deal gave the steel trust a monopoly of steel for
all time to come. ‘

The episode was “investigated” during the spe-
cial session of Congress, summer of 1911, by the
Stanley Committee, and Roosevelt testiﬁed to his
own immaculate honesty in the matter. Later he
further justiﬁed himself in an article in the Outlook
(New, York), On October 26, 1911, however, the
Government, in its complaint ﬁled against the steel
trust, declared that the magnates had “misled”
Roosevelt, and that by “hammering the Tennessee
stock” and “threatening a general ﬁnancial calamity”

had “unlawfully acquired a power which is a menace
to the welfare of the country.”

Absorption of Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.

From report of the Stanley Committee, Aug. 2, 1912.
—House Report No. 1127, 62d Congress, 2d Session.

As to the contention that the President and Steel
Corporation prevented “a general industrial ‘smash-
up,’ ” it is stoutly maintained by Colonel Roosevelt
and by Judge Gary that -the advantage in the
“sweetening” of Grant B. Schley’s ob1igations——that
is the substitution of steel bonds for Tennessee Coal
& Iron stock in about six or seven million out of

"thirty-eight million dollars of loans—prevented the

most disastrous panic of recent times. Colonel
Roosevelt, when before this committee, graphically
describes the terriﬁc ﬁnancial cataclysm in which
he played so conspicuous a part.

How a panic which had persistently resisted the
combined efforts of the Federal Government and
John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan & Co., and
remained in unabated fury after Morgan and
Rockefeller had turned loose $60,000,000 and the
Federal Treasury $25,000,000 more should suddenly
be stilled by this manipulation of Grant B. Schley’s
loans has not been explained either by Mr. Roose-
velt or byany other witness, Yet it is urgently
maintained that the panic continued prior to this
magical scoop of securitiesand that the instant
the Steel Corporation acquired the Tennessee Coal
& Iron Co.’s stock it subsided instantly and per-
manently.

That Colonel Roosevelt distinctly heard ominous
rumblings in ‘Wall Street at the time he consented
to this remarkable merger cannot be doubted. In
the light of subsequent events, it is equally cer-
tain that it was the receding and not an approach-
ing storm which disturbed him. In an editorial on
June 7, 1911, published in the New York World, it
was clearly demonstrated that the panic was over
prior to the interview between Colonel Roosevelt
and the representatives of the Steel Corporation.

Up until the time of this interview the Steel Cor-
poration owed its succes‘s and its permanency. to
the power and the skill of the ﬁnanciers who had
created and the iron masters who had directed its
operations. Since that time its dominance has been
due in no small measure to the sudden, i1l-consid-
ered, and arbitrary ﬁat of the Chief Executive.

2:36  APPEAL ‘ALMANAC Aixifi

The President’s refusal to interfere was an abso—
lute warrant to proceed. A suggestion from him to
the Attorney General was equivalent to a command;
and upon a refusal of the Attorney General to act,
the corporation was immune. This is admitted by
Colonel. Roosevelt, and he unhtesitatingly assumes
full responsibility in the matter.

If the Steel Corporation could have absorbed the
Tennessee Coal ‘& Iron Co. without a ‘semblance of
injury —to the steel industry or without violation
of ‘existing law, it would not have been necessary
for Judge Gary and Mr. Frick, ‘on a special car
“rigged” up at midnight, to make that hurried run
to Washington. '

WHY “REGULATION” FAILS.

t By Daniel W..Hoan, Mayor of Milwaukee“

There are several reasons‘why “regulation” fails
and always will fail: 0 ' ‘

1. Regulation involves an inevitable and a
never-ending conﬂict between the owners of the

 

corporations and the people. The corporations want ‘

dividends; the people want good service, low rates,

,good wages, etc. The one simply cannot be had

 

without cutting into the other. And there you are.

2." Regulation involves a needless duplication of
effort and expense. The United States Govern-
ment spends over a million and a half dollars an-

nually for its commission. The State of Wisconsin‘

pays $200,000 for its State commission, while New
York State spends over a million dollars annually.

VVith these fabulous sums of money wasted in a
vain and futile effort to regulate utilitieswe
could buy and pay for and turn over to Uncle Sam
all the big trusts in a few years.

3. The task is too great for any commission. The
railroad commission of Wisconsin pretends to regu-
late forty-three railroads controlling 7,586 miles of
trackage; six express companies, several tegegraph
companies, twenty—eight street railway companies,
and in addition thereto 1,164 local utilities.

It is a human impossibility for any commission
ever conceived by our “regulation” statesmen to

handle such an enormous task without intermin—»

able delays. It is certainly impossible to follow
up its orders\and see that they are enforced.

4. And ﬁnally the corporations are sure to strive
by every device known to human ingenuity to
control and inﬂuence the commissioners.

THE INCOME TAX,

The income tax was approved Oct. 3, 1913. It is
a tax ‘on all compensation, proﬁts, sales, interest,
rent, dividends, etc., both of corporations and indi-

rviduals. By the Omnibus Revenue act (approved

Sept. 8, 1916) the rates were increased and are now
as follows:

The normal tax is 2 per cent., upon net income
of more than $3,000, or in -the case of married
couples, upon aggregate net income of more than
$4,000. -

The super-tax is an additional tax on net in-
come in excess of $20,000 as follows: a.

Fixed periodical incomes in the form of salaries,
wages, rent, interest on mortgages, income from
trust funds, etc., are taxed at the source—-that is,
at the office of the ﬁrm or corporation paying such
income. Other sorts of income are taxed upon the
individual. The tax must be paid on or before June
30 of ‘each year, and failure to pay is- followed by
heavy penalties. The tax began upon incomes accru-
ing from March 1, 1913.

THE CORPORATION TAX.

— A tax of 2 per cent. is levied on the total net in-
come of every taxable corporation, joint-stock com-
pany or association, or insurance company organ-
ized in the United" States, but not including part-
nerships. Corporations not included in this provi-
sion are such organizations as labor and agricul-
tural organizations, mutual savings banks, fraternal
societies, domestic building and loan associations,
chambers of commerce, Federal land banks, etc.

$67,943,594.63 in 1916 has not yet been published.

INCOME TAX FRAUDS.

In a series of articles for the Newspaper Enter-
prise Association, published in the summer of 1916,
Basil M. Manly, of the Industrial Relations Commit-
tee, declares that the Government is cheated out of
more than $320,000,000 yearly by income—tax dodg-
ing. Mr. Manly ﬁgures that the national income of
the American people rose to $46,000,000,000 in 1914,
The income tax should have produced at least $400,-
000,000; as a matter of fact it produced only $80,-

‘, .

7 000,000.

At least 250,000 citizens and resident aliens, says
Mr. Manly, who should have paid the tax, failed tit?
ﬁle either a proper return or any return at all.
Mr. Manly declares further that the law is grossly
-defective; that it was framed to permit just such

 

"_‘O"‘<\vLvvaurr-\4v\'JuvvLvg;—._’UU‘»A

ARSENAL or FACTS, 1917. 301

frauds and evasions and to render their perpetra-
tors secure from detection and punishment.

The Treasury Department subsequently made an-
nouncement that up to May 20th frauds and evasions
aggregating $8,380,185 had been frustrated, and that
the amounts would be collected. Approximately
ﬁve-eighths .of the total was due from corporations.
’It is a common practice among corporations, says
the department, to pad expense items in order to
make net income as low as possible.

OMNIBUS REVENUE ACT.

The Omnibus Revenue Act (approved Sept. 8, 1916)
in addition to increasing the income tax, levied an
inheritance tax, an extra tax of 50 cents on each
$1,000 of capital ($99,000 exempted) on joint-stock
companies and associations, a tax of 121/; per cent.
on net proﬁts of munition manufacturers,_ extra

‘ taxes on spirits, wines and tobacco, on stockbrokers,

pawnbrokers, shipbrokers and customhouse brokers
an‘d on certain amusement enterprises. The act also
altered the customs duties on dyestuffs and print-
ing paper, established a tariff commission and put
into the hands of the President certain powers for
use in retaliating against nations that interfere with
United States mail or commerce in transit to or

from any other country, or that practice “unfair,

competition.”

The United States Navy Department announced on.

September 15, 1916, that the superdreadnaught bat-
tleship Arizona was completed on schedule time and
that notwithstanding the eight-hour workday prevails
in the government shipyards and that nine hours
generally prevails in private shipyards; the cost of
construction of the Arizona was $1,000,000 less than

“ the lowest bid of” the privately owned shipyards.

BANKS AND ‘BANKING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.

The banking and currency law, known as the
Federal Reserve Act, was passed December 23,
1913. Under it the United States is divided into
twelve banking districts, each with a “reserve city”
or banking capital, as follows:

District No. 1 (Boston).——Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Con-
necticut. A

District No. 2 (New York City).~—The State of
New York,

District‘ No. 3 (Philadelphia).———NeW Jersey and
Delaware; all that part of Pennsylvania east of the
western boundary of McKean, Elk, Clearﬁeld, Cam-
bria and Bedford counties.

District ’No. 4 (Cleveland).——Ohio; all that part
of Pennsylvania west of district No. 3; Marshall,
‘Ohio, Brooke and Hancock Counties, W. Va.; all
that part of Kentucky east of the western boundary
of Boone, Grant, Scott, Woodford, Jessamine, Gar-

. rard, Lincoln, Pulaski and McCreary Counties.

District No. 5 (Richmond).—District of Columbia,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South
Carolina; all of West Virginia except Marshall,
Ohio, Brooke and Hancock Counties.

District No. 6 (Atlanta).—Alabama, Georgia and
Florida; all that part of Tennessee east of the
western boundary of Stewart, Houston, Wayne,
Humphreys and Perry Counties; all that part of
Mississippi south of the northern boundary of
Issaquena, Sharkey, Yazoo, Kemper, Madison,
Leake and Neshoba Counties; all the southeastern
part of Louisiana east of the Western boundary of
Pointe Coupee, Iberville, Assumption and Terrebonne

boundary of Vigo, Clay, Owen, Monroe, Brown,
Bartholomew, Jennings, Ripley, and Ohio Counties.

District No. 8 (St. Louis).-——Arkansas; all that

FARSENAL, OF FACTS, ‘1917. 303

Harrison, Daviess, Caldwell, Ray, Lafayette, John-
son, Henry, St. Clair, Cedar, Dade, Lawrence and
Barry Counties; all that part of Illinois and Indiana
not included in district No. 7; all that part of
Kentucky not included in district No. 4; all that
part of Tennessee and Mississippi not included in
district No. 6.

District No. 9 (Minneapolis).-—Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota; all that
part of Wisconsin and Michigan not included in
district No. 7. _

District No, 10 (Kansas City).——Kansas, Ne-
braska, Colorado, and Wyoming; all that part of
Missouri not included in district No. 8; all that
‘part of Oklahoma north of the southern boundary
of Ellis, Dewey, Blaine, Canadian, Cleveland, Potta-
watomie, Seminole, Okfuskee, Mclntosh, Muskogee,
and Sequoyah Counties; all that part of New Mexico
north of the southern boundary of McKinley, San-
doval, Santa Fe, San Miguel, and Union Counties.

District No. 11 (Dallas).——Texas; all that part
of New Mexico and Oklahoma not included in dis-
trict No, 10; all that part of Louisiana not included
in district No. 6; and Pima, Graham, Greenlee, C0-
chise, and Santa Cruz Counties, Arizona.

District No. 12 (San Francisco).——California.
"Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah;-all
that part of Arizona not included in district No. 11.

Every National bank is required to become a
stockholder in the Federal Reserve bank of the
district in which it is situated, and any State bank
or trust company which complies with certain
speciﬁed requirements is permitted to become a
member bank. There are at the present time ap-
proximately 7,500 National banks in the United
States which have thus been required to become
\member banks. 

The largest district, in respect to number of mem-
ber banks—the seventh ofr Chicago district—has
952 member banks. The smallest district—the sixth
or Atlanta district—has 372 member banks. The
number of member banks may largely increase in
the near future from the addition of State banks
and trust companies as member banks,

Each’ member bank is required to subscribe to
the stock of the Federal Reserve bank of its dis-
trict in the amount equal to 6 per centum of its
paid-up capital stock and surplus’. The Federal

' Reserve bank does not do business ‘with the public

in the sense that banks usually do; it may better
be described as a bank. of banks. It is made a de-

pository for a certain proportion of the reserve of
all the member banks, and _in addition may also

be a depository for Government funds. An im-

portant function is as a bank of issue and redemp-
tion of currency, for it may secure from the Treas-
ury Government notes known as Federal Reserve
notes, which it is authorized to issue against com-
mercial paper with a minimum gold reserve of 40
per centum. ‘ Besides this, Federal Reserve banks
are granted certain powers in the matter of opera-
tions in the open market, such as the purchase of
commercial paper, foreign exchange,‘etc., and in a
general way are expected to perform important
functions as clearing houses between their member
banks.

Each Federal Reserve bank has nine directors,
three- of whom represent the member banks, three
represent commercial, agricultural or other indus-
trial pursuit (these six being chosen by the mem-
ber banks),_ and ﬁnally three Government directors
chosen by the Federal Reserve Board. These nine
directors are charged with the duty of appointing

~ all necessary oﬂ"icers,.,including the active manager

of the bank, who is designated as its President or
Governor. A

Under the act the whole system is under the
supervision of a central board in Washington known
as the Federal Reserve Board, consisting of the
Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of
the Currency acting ex-officio, and ﬁve members
named by the President with the approval of the
Senate. The ﬁve members first selected (who took
oath of office August 10, 1914) are as follows:\

Charles S. Hamlin, Governor, term of office, 2
years. A .

Frederic A. Delano, Vice-Governor, term of office,
6 years.

Paul M. Warburg, term ‘of office, 4 years.

W, P. G. Harding, term of office, 8 years.

A. C. Miller, term of office, 10 years.

At the termination of the term of office of these
ﬁve members all subsequentappointees will be

named for ten-year terms, except, of course, those “

who may be selected to ﬁll unexpired terms.

The salary of the members of this board is $12,000
per annum each, which salaries, together with all
other expenses of operating the system, are assessed
against the Federal Reserve banks in proportion to

-their, capital stock and Surplus. Secretary t0—the

Cost of the System.

The statement of the Reserve Board for Sept. 9.
1916, showed total resources of $632,594,000, with a

‘gold reserve against net deposit and note liabilities
(of 67.7 per cent.

In a speech reviewing the work of the Reserve

Csystem, Knute Nelson, in the senate, on Sept. 4,
1916, asserted that the system had cost“.up to Aug.)

31st $3,531,911, of which salaries and counsel fees
up to Dec. 31, 1915. had taken $865.895, and original
organization expenses, $493,960. “The new system,”
he said, “had nothing to do with staying the’ threat-
ened panic of 1914. It has.added no«new capital
or new Wealth to our country.”

GENERAL STATISTICS, 1910.

The Census volume on Occupations for 1910 gives
a total of 38,167,336 persons engaged in gainful pur-
suits, of whom 30,091,564 are males and 8,075,772
females. The Census officials are inclined to be-
lieve, however, that an error has been made in the
enumeration, by which approximately 468,100
females in excess of the actual number have been
counted. All the tables are based, notwithstanding,
on the larger ﬁgures, and this basis is followed in
the data given below. The deduction, even if made,
would entail very slight changes in the percentages.
It would reduce the proportion of occupied persons
to the whole population only from 41.5 per cent. to
41 -per cent., and of occupied persons to the whole
population over 10 years of age from 53.3 per cent.
to 52.7 per cent. *

woise noted, from the Census volume on Occupations

The two following tables give the number of
occupied persons (1910) for ﬁveage periods, and
the percentage which each group bore to the whole
population ,of the same age period in 1910 and
.1900: ~

It will thus be seen that a greater number of
woman and girl workers than of man and boy
workers, proportioned to the population over _ten
years, have gone into gainful employment since
1900. Each age period for females shows an in-
crease, while for males the 10-13, 14-15 and 45-and-
over periods show relative decreases. The. effects
of the discrimination against men over 45 are plainly
shown in these ﬁgures. ‘

OCCUPATION BY SEX GROUPS.
The increased employment of women and girls in

\ each of the chief divisions of industry and service

is shown in the following table. The ﬁgures show
the percentages of occupied persons by sex in each

classiﬁcationifor 1910 and 1900. It will be seen 1

that in four_of the ﬁve classiﬁcations the relative

number of males has considerably declined:

The proportion of occupied females to totalfemale
population was slightly greater in England in 1911
than in 1901, but slightly less than in 1891 and 1881.
In the United States the proportion has been for
the last four censuses, respectively, 10.7, 13.1, 14.3
and 18.1 per cent.

’ OCCUPIED PERSONS BY CLASSES.

’I‘he Volume on Occupations for thecensus of 1910
fails to give the ﬁgures classiﬁed in such a way
as to make possible a division into classes. Occupa-

‘tions are given in great detail, but in the main no

distinctionis made between employer and employee.

as follows:/, .

310 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

The 1910 census gives 38,167,336 occupied persons.
The classiﬁcations throughout the volume are some-
what different from those in the 1900 census, but
in a table on page 57 identical classiﬁcations in big
groups are used for the purpose of showing a com-
parison. The table follows:

Unfortunately, as has previously been said, except
in certain categories there is no distinction between
employer and employee. It is therefore impossible,
until further ﬁgures are published, to compute the
number of occupied persons in each economic class.

The groups of the working class in 1900, with
their percentage of increase from 1890 to 1900, have
also been computed, as follows: ‘

Groups. ' Number. P. C. of Inc.
Clerical and distributive . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,825,375 48.4

can so far be made for 1910. -

CHILD LABOR.

, The official figures show an absolute increase in
' the number of child workers——1,750,178 in 1900 and

- 1,990,225 in.1910.
There is also a slightly higher percentage of
the child population over 10 at work—-18.2 per cent.
in 1900 and 18.4 per cent. in 1910. .

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. ' 311

The number of child Workers in. proportion to
all occupied persons» has; however, decreased
slightly——from 6 per cent. in 1900 to 5.2 per cent.
in 1910. _ '

A decrease is also shown in the number of child
workers in non-agricultural pursuits, including fac-
tory work.
ers were employed at other than agricultural toil;
in 1910 only 28 per cent.

In 1880 16.8 per cent. of all children over 10 were
at worli; in 1900, 18.2 per cent.; in 1910, 18.4 per
cent.

Child Labor Committeeils Statement.

A pamphlet, “The Extent of Child Labor Offi-
cially Measured,” based on the new Volume of the
last United States Census, was issued Oct. 22, 1914,
by the National Child Labor Committee to show
the amount of child labor in this country. The

Census volume gives figures for children 10 to 15 .

only, omitting all figures for children under 10.
The’ National Child Labor Committee says that
since many children under 10 are known to_be at
work, the number of child laborers, given In the
Census as 1,990,225, is undoubtedly as much as
2,000,000.

The results of the work of the National Child
Labor Committee and its affiliated organizations

.. are asserted to be shown in the reduction of the

number of children under 14 engaged in non-agri-
cultural pursuits, from 186,358 in 1900, to 95,839 in
1910.

Thepamphlet calls particular attention, however,
to the need of protection. for the children working
at agriculture, who are often thought to be em-
ployed under better conditions than mill hands.

The foregoing ﬁgures relating to the Japanese,
though official, are not believed to be accurate." The
Japanese-American Year-Book gives 91,958 Japanese’
in the United States in 1910 and 95,483 in 1913.
Prof. H. A. Millis, in his work “The Japanese Prob-
lem in the United States” (1915), ‘computes the

- number for 1913 at 95,679, of whom 13,688 were

~ women and 11,111 children under 16. Dr. Yamato
Ichihashi, in his pamphlet, “Japanese Immigration:
Its Status in California” (1915), evidently coincides
with Dr. Millis’ view.

The number of Japanese in Mexico, according to
an investigation made by the Japanese embassy in
the summer of 1916, was about 2,000, of whom 300 _ ,
were women and children. 1

THE WORKER’-S SHARE.
In attempting to compute the share of labor in

its product, we have, for a beginning, certain Gov-.

ernment ﬁgures to work upon. These ﬁgures pur-s
port to be the result of a census, taken every ﬁve
years, of factory production. The latest census
available is that of 1909, since the full results of the
census of 1914 will probably not be published for
some time yet. The lump ﬁgures for 1909 areas

INADEQUACY OF THE FIGURES. 

The ﬁgures are not sufficiently explicit to enable
one to compute from them a satisfactory conclusion.
“Census data,” says the report, “did not show the
entire cost of manufacture and consequently cannot
be used to show proﬁts.”,

We spend millions of dollars on our census, but
it cannot give us the results we demand from it.

0 The ﬁgures are no more than approximations, and
/therefore no computation from them can be exact.

Moreover, some of them are liable to different inter-
pretations, and ‘thus they lend themselves. to widely
diverse conclusions, according to the bias of the

epersonvwho studies them.

What most persons want to know from the

ﬁgures on manufacturing is the relation between ’

the, worker’s wage and the value of what he pro-
duced. Though an exact answer cannot be given,
the ﬁgures are perhaps sufficiently full to enable

‘ the making of an approximate guess.

VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS.‘

In the ﬁrst place, the total value of the products
($20,672,052,000) may be taken as fairly accurate.

iThis is the factory value, of course, and the only

one we are warranted in considering when dealing

with the. worker’s shares If we took the whole- .
sale value, or the jobbing value, or the retail value,

trial employment by the low wages received by
their fathers; that they are separated from proper
home inﬂuences at an excessively‘ early age; that
they are inadequately schooled and are insuffi-
ciently protected; and that many of them become
recruits for the system of prostitution.

4. Unregulated condition of domestic employ-
ment, uncertain hours, absence of deﬁnite social
status and lack of recreative opportunities render
the home, in many cases, for the woman servants,
a breeding place of commercialized vice.

5. That segregation of vice, as a system of
municipal regulation, is an entire failure; that it
promotes and increases immorality; that it spreads
practices of degeneracy; and being an open tolera-
tion of law violation, materially lessens the com-
munity respect for law and order. A

6. That many Women, through inability to live
on the legitimate means at their disposal, or in the
desire of supplementing allowances by husband or
parent, are part of a new and elaborate network
of vice, known as the “ca1l-girl” system; that the
system is rapidly being organized, and fresh girls
are being drawn into it by the assurance of the
ease with which proﬁtable prostitution may be
practised without sacriﬁce of reputation for respect-
ability.

7. That lack of regulation in the employment of
girls subjects them to unnecessary perils,_and often
leads to their downfall.

8. That many women of the underworld are
redeemed; and that, with the proper treatment, the
closing of the vice districts may restore a large
percentage of their inmates to decent lives. T

9. That the sale of intoxicants, in.connection
with public dancing, is: unquestionably in ‘many
cases a strong contributory cause of vice.

10. That the highest standard of‘ morals exists
among the girls in the high schools, colleges and
universities of the state. A T

Each of these ﬁndings is supported by further
statements, by argument or by citations of testi-
mony. In commenting upon No. 10 the report makes
the assertion “that the chance of becoming en-
meshed in the industry of prostitution diminishes
with the length of the schooling is incontrovertibly
proved by the statistics of courts and police
offices.”

we should also have to consider the additional toil
of thousands and thousands of other .men—railway

workers, shippers, teamsters, salesmen and multi-,

tudes of others whose work is necessary in market-
ing goods to the consumer.

‘We have then the statistical statement that a cer-
tain number of wage-earners and salaried per-
sons took $12,141,791,000 Worth of material and con-
verted it into a value of $20,672,052,000. Of course,
a previous proﬁt was made on the production and
marketing of the raw material, but that also in-
volves the toil of men outside the factory. The
value added by the process of manufacture was
$8,530,261,000.

OTHER FACTORS.

This is not, however, the whole problem. There
were miscellaneous expenses, reaching the enormous
total of nearly two billions. If this item were purely
a labor charge, it would, of course, in an attempt
to determine the value of the worker’s toil, have to
be deducted from the total value. It happens, how-
ever, that a large part of miscellaneous expenses
is a capital charge—that is, a toll which capitalism
takes out of the production. The classiﬁcation of
the various entries under this heading in the 1904
census showed that no less than 86 per cent. of this
expense was a capital charge-——rent of offices, rent
of land, insurance and the like. It was a charge

on the individual employer, of course; but it was

a capital charge and not a labor charge. It was the
toll of the money-lender, the real estate owner, per-
haps the owner of the building, the machinery manu-
facturer, the lawyer, the politician, the grafter and
the Lord knows what. However great was this toll,
it was not chargeable to labor. — '

The aid in production that was given by the
790,267 salaried employees cannot be determined.
A certain amount of superintendence, designing,
inventing, planning and clerical work is, of course,
absolutely essential in production. A great many
high salaries, on the other hand, are merely in-
stances of disguised proﬁts, and therefore a part
of the toll of capital. It may be a fair guess that
two-thirds of these salaried employees, —or 526,844,
rendered actual aid in producing values, and that
they received about one-half of the total salary
expense, or $469,287,500, the other one—third of the
salaried persons‘ getting the other one—half of the
total.

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917.

' A CONJECTURAL RESULT.

If we ‘make these deductions, reducing the
amount for legitimate miscellaneous expenses to
14 per cent. of the total given, we shall have a
total net proﬁt of $7,985,471,660, produced by a

total of 7,141,900 wage-earning workers and their -

salaried auxiliaries, an average of, $1,118, each.
These persons received $545. each, or 48.8 per cent.
The other 51.2 per cent. went to capital in some of
its various forms.

The result is conjectural only. The same basic
ﬁgures may be reviewed in many ways, giving the
worker’s share as anywhere from 45 to 52 per cent.
In some industries the value added by manufacture
is very low; in Henry Ford’s automobile factory

it is very high. -. For the whole factory production’

of the nation it is safe to say that capital, in one
or another of its many forms, “draws down” from
50 to 55 per cent. of What the working class pro-
duces. ” A

WORKER’S SHARE DECREASING.

It is, moreover,_ demonstrable that the share of
the worker (in the main, the manual worker), in
what he produces is declining. Making no other
deduction from the gross value_of the product than
that of the cost of materials, and dividing the re-
mainder by the number of persons listed in the
censilis as wage-earners, we have the following
resu t:

Average Av. net Av. share
Year. ‘ Wages. production. per cent.
1899 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$426 $1,025 41.6
1904 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 477 1,150 41.5
1909. '. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 518 1,290 40.1

This 40.1 per cent. is not quite all, if the census
ﬁgures are approximately correct, that the worker
gets. The comparison shows, however, that what:
ever he gets, the amount was relatively less in
1909 than in 1904 or 1899.

The argument that under Socialism the worker
will receive a far greater amount of money or ex-
change values for his toil does not depend wholly,
or even predominantly, upon a determination of the
amount which capitalism now takes from_ him.
A score of other factors are to be considered—the
better organization of industry, greater efficiency
of production, elimination of ‘competitive and other
wastes, provision of opportunities for labor for all

 

318 - C THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

—factors which make for a vast increase in the
‘amount of produced values to be distributed.

The foregoing conclusions are, in the main, con-
ﬁrmed in Prof. King’s work, “The Wealth and Income
of the People of the United States” (1915). Labor,
he says (though he includes salaried persons) gets
“about half of the total product”; but the total
share going to labor, he adds, “has been falling off,
despite the efforts of labor unions and combina-
tions.”

LARGER SHARE TO CAPITAL.

The increasing share of the value of production
that goes to capital is indicated in the ﬁgures given
below.“ The percentages show: (1) in the first
column the increase in the average number of
wage-earners; (2) in the second column the in-
crease in the value of the products. The comparison
is for the ten-year period, 1899-1909, and relates
to manufactures. a

The ﬁgures, it should be noted, are not to be
taken as showing the absolute relation between
increase of wage—earners and increase of values.
Other efactors———inc‘reases in wages, in the cost of
materials and in miscellaneous expenses——somewhat
’modify the proportion. They do, however, show the
fact that in 1909 an average number of wage—earners
only 40.4 per cent. in excess of the number in 1899
produced 81.2 per cent. greater values.

PAY OF RAILWAY MEN.

The most reliable"body of statistics in America,
regarding wage-earners, is to be found in the an-
nual reports of the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion. Below is a table from that source, which
shows what railway men received per day in 1892,
1901 and 1914. Commodity prices in 1914 had risen
about 50 per cent. The salaries of railway officers
have advanced 100 per cent., but the wages, as a
rule, have risen only slightly. ‘Switch tenders, in
fact, receive less today than they did twenty years
ago. Enginemen, the aristocrats of that industry,
receive about 42 per cent. more than they received
in 1892. During that period the railroads have
coined billions of dollars for their stockholders.

WAGE-EARNERS IN MANUFACTURES, 1914.

The average number of wage-earners employed in
manufactures in 1914 was 7,036.;337, against 6,615,046
in 1909, an increase of 6.4 per cent. The total wages
paid were $4,079,332,000, against $3,427,038,000
in 1909, an increase of 19 per cent. The average
weekly wages (including those of women and chil-
dren) were in 1914, $11.15; in 1909, $9.96; an in-
crease of 11.8 per cent. The average increase in
food prices between 1909 and 1914 was, according
to Bulletin 197 of the Federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 16.1 per cent.

FOOD ‘IN WORKINGMEN’S FAMILIES.
’ On the basis of the table given on the preceding

.page, the Federal Bureau of Labor has‘ computed

the increased food cost for the average working-
man’s family. Assuming that each of the 15 prin-
cipal commodities which constituted two—thirds of
the workingmen’s food supply in 1901 bears the

‘ same.relation to the ‘total that it did then, the food

cost forthese 2,567 families wou‘d show the follow-
ing comparison between 1901 and 1913:

826 , THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE MINIMUM WAGE.

Within the last four years eleven States have en-
acted minimum wage laws. Massachusetts was the
ﬁrst (in 1912), though its act did not go into effect
until after ﬁve other acts were in operation. The
dates at which the laws became effective (1913 ex-
cept Arkansas and Kansas, 1915) .were as follows:_

 

Utah. . . . . . . . . . . . . .May 13 Nebraska. . . . . . . . ..July 17
Oregon. . . . . . . . . . . .June 2 Wisconsin. . . . . . .August 1

Massachusetts. . . . . .July 1 Arkansas . . . . . . .March, 1915

~ Kansas . . . . . . . . .May 22, 1915

Michigan, New York and Idaho have also taken
preliminary steps in the same direction.

The laws of 1913 are in the main alike. In Utah
only females are included. All the others include
minors—under 18 in Oregon, Washington, Massa-
chusetts, Nebraska, California and Colorado, under
21 in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

All industries are covered in all the States except
Colorado. All the States, except Utah and Wiscon-
sin, create a commission to administer the law. In
Utah the Labor Commissioner administers it, and
in Wisconsin the Industrial Commission. .

The eight commissions are authorized to deter-
mine" the wage needful for a living. The Cali-
fornia, Oregon and Wisconsin commissions have
also the power to determine maximum hours and
conditions of labor. All the commissions may
subpoena Witnesses, administer oaths and examine
books. In California and Wisconsin they may also
enter premises. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ne-
braska, Oregon and Wisconsin the commissions
(and in Utah the Labor Commissioner) have au-
thority to enforce all their decisions, while in Cali-
fornia and Washington they may enforce only
wage decisions.

The Arkansasstatute became effective on its
passage. It applies to. females working in any
manufacturing, mechanical or mercantile establish-
ment, laundry or express or transportation com-
pany. Hours are restricted to nine per day and 54
per week. The minimum wage is ﬁxed by law at
not less than $1.25 per day for female workers of
six months’ experience, with a minimum of $1 per
day for inexperienced workers. Proportionate re-
ductions for a shorter workday are permitted.

The Kansas law creates a commission to establish
standards of wages, hours and conditions for women

"WAGES OF MALE FARM LABOR.

Farm Wages advanced slightly during 1915 ‘in the
principal grain States and remained stationary or
declined slightly in‘the cotton States, says the
Labor Gazette’s summary of ‘estimates made bythe

.United States , Department of Agriculture. The

h'igher"g"rain prices and lower cotton prices inﬂu-
enced, such changes. During the year there was
less scarcity of farm labor than duringa number
of preceding years. Forithe entire United States
wages per day of ma‘e farm labor increased about 1
cent during the year, and averaged about $1.47
without board and $1.13 with board. For labor
hired by the month the rate without board in-
creased during the year .27 cents, to $30.15 as com-
pared with $29.88 last year; rates with board, Which
is the more general method of hiring, increased
from $21.05 to $21.26—an increase of 21 cents.
Wages have been tending upward almost steadily
since 1894. The increase in the last ﬁve) years is
about 10 per cent.

UNEMPLOYMENT.

INCREASED EMPLOYMENT IN 1916.»_ _
. The chronic state of unemployment for large num-

bers of American wage-ear ers has been momenta-
, rily relieved by the demands for supplies from '

Europe.. The Labor Burea'u’s Monthly Review, which
publishes in each issue a statement of employment
in identical establishments of selected industries,
shows that for August, 1916, the degree of employ-

ment, compared with that of the same mon.th‘,of,

1915, rangedlfrom a slight decrease in cigar making
to an increase of 25.3“ per cent. in iron and steel
making.’ The ﬁgures follow: ’

/ SEASONAL UNEMPLOYMENT.

The census report on manufactures for 1910 has
a particularly interesting set of ﬁgures o/n sea-
sonal unemployment. The state of trade varies ‘in
most of the industries, month by month, and the
difference between the highest and the lowest num-
.ber ofiwage-earners employed is sometimes extreme.
‘In canning and preserving, for instance. 154,800
workers are employed in September, but only 19,998
in January. The minimum number in this case’ is
only 12.9 per cent. of the maximum number. .

Throughout the manufacturing‘ realm November
averages up the busiest month. The average num-
ber of Wage-earners employed is then -7,006,853‘.

CAUSES OF POVERTY.

From report of the New York Association for Im-
proving the Condition of the Poor (1911).

“The two most striking points were the large
number of families reduced to poverty by sickness,
and the insigniﬁcant. part played by intemperance
as a contributing cause. Of the 1,573 cases in the
association’s care, sickness was the cause of poverty
in 681 cases,-or 43 per cent. Intemperance caused a
triﬂe less than 2 per cent. .Unemployment was the
second most important cause, with 25 per cent. In-
sufficient income led 12 per cent. to seek relief;
death and accident, 4 per cent.; old age, 1 per cent.
Other contributing causes were imprisonment, ﬁre,
mental deficiency. immorality and insanity.”

CAMPAIGN AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.

The American Association for Labor Legislation
discussed the problem of unemployment at its
national conference in New York, Feb. 27-28, 1914.
Despite the ,great diversity of viewpoints presented,
there was general agreement on ﬁve main needs:

‘1. The necessity for accurate labor market sta-
tistics. \ .

2. The necessity for a widespread system of
efficient labor exchanges.

3 The necessity for regularizing business, so as
to eliminate seasonal unemployment.

4.. The necessity for vocational training and
guidance. -

5. The necessity for unemployment insurance.

The second national conference was held at Phila-
delphia Dec. 28-29, 1914. Reports were made that six
legislatures had made provision for public employ-
ment exchanges and that a number of cities had
set up municipal bureaus. -

The “Unemployment Survey,” reviewing the con-
ditions of 1914-15 and recommending lines of action,
was issued in November, 1915.

DNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

Three nations—Great Britain, Denmark and Nor-
way—have enacted unemployment insurance laws.

\ The Norwegian system is said to have failed. (The

Danish system has been in operation since 1907 and
has been successful. It is a scheme of voluntary
insurance by workingmen’s societies, under State
regulation and with both State and community sub-‘

sidies to the unemployment funds. On April 1, -1915,’

there were 57 “funds,” or societies maintaining un-
employment insurance, with 139,505 members. For
the ﬁscal year 1913-14 the members paid in 51 per
cent. of the income, the State 30 and the communi-
ties 14 per cent. For the ﬁscal year 1914-15 the total
income was $871,585, the unemployment beneﬁts and
the cost of administration were $825,046. '

Great Britain’s insurance system is compulsory.

It dates from July 15, 1912, though beneﬁts have

been paid only since Jan. 15, 1913. It insures all
workers above 16 in the building trades, in machine
manufacturing, ship and wagon building, iron mould-
ing and saw-milling. It establishes a national em-
ployment fund, with a national system of labor ex-
changes. Five cents a. week is paid by each_ em-
ployee, another ﬁve cents by his employer, and the
Government adds a subsidy equal to one-third of

rmmmﬂmmm “«wmwm-m,....a«.~a. .. ....-.

332 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

the total. The Government also co—operates with
labor organizations having voluntary insurance
schemes by repayment of one—sixth of beneﬁts not
in ‘excess of $2.88. Beneﬁts under the compulsory
scheme are $1.68, per week ‘from the second to the
ﬁfteenth week. The insured must, however, have
worked for at least 26 Weeks in the year for the
previous three years in an-occupation subject to
compulsory insurance, and must not have become
unemployed through strike or his own fault. The
unemployed person does not lose his beneﬁt by reae
son of refusing work at lower wages than those he

‘ formerly earned.

About 2,000,000 workers are insured. Beneﬁts paid
inAJanuaI‘.y, 1914, was $466,955; 1915, $200,743; 1916,
$50,806.

FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT WORK.

From Feb. 1, 1915, to July 1, 1916, the Division of
Information ,of the Bureau of Immigration received
260,260 applications for positions. It was successful
in ﬁnding places for 86,158 applicants. The Division
was establishedin 1907, and until its reorganiza-
tion as apart of the Department of Labor its work
wasalmost wholly limited to obtaining places for
aliiéins. Since February, 1915, it has greatly widened
its activities. During May and June, 1916, it re-
ceived applications for 38,728 workers from 9,744
employers _and 36,438 applications for places, and
found places for 23,413 workers.

NON-FATAL ACCIDENTS IN COAL MINES.

According to Bulletin No. 115, of the Bureau of/

Mines, published in April, 1916; there are no com-
plete records of non—fatal injuries in coal. mines of
the United States. In 1911 the bureau collected
from the operators statistics of 9,106 serious in-
juries (those causing a loss of time of 20 days or
more) and of 22,228 slight injuries for that year.
The ﬁgures. are believed by the bureau, with good
reason, to be incomplete. .

In 1913, according to ﬁgures given by the various
State mine inspectors, there‘ were 6,719 more or
less serious non-fatal injuries in the coal mines.
Pennsylvania led with 1,015 in its anthracite mines
Taking as a
basis the rate of injuriesin metal mines, says, the
bulletin, the yearly rate of non—fatal injuries in. the
coal mines should be 22,900 persons seriously in-
jured and 114,500 -slightly injured. ‘ '

Seventy per cent. of the mothers of girls at the
Geneva home (a refuge for reformed girls) ‘Were,
according to Sophonisba P. Breckinridge, either
washwomen or scrubwomen. “Slightly under 70 per
cent. of the delinquent girls brought into the
Juvenile Court of Cook County were from families
not supported by the‘ fathers, where the mother had
become the wage-learner, and the conditions of
poverty were extreme ” ‘ * This committee was-
unab'le to learn of a single prostitute, in any city
in’ Illinoisvisited or in which its investigators
operated, who had come from a home of even modest
prosperity. Women do not seek lives of prostitu-
tion, except under economic pressure, or economic
expediency, or under the handicap of moral and
mental defects resulting from previous family
economic conditions.”

What Other Committees Say.

The report quotes from the conclusions of a
number of other committees, some state and some
municipal, which during the previous ﬁve years had
investigated the question. One of these investig'at¢
ing bodies was the Chicago Vice Commission, .
appointedby Mayor Fred A; Buss-e_ on March 5, 1910, 1‘
which rendered its ﬁnalyreport on April 5, 1911.

Its” chairman was Dean (no‘w.Bishop) Walter T. 2
Sumner and its secretary, Edwin W. Sims. “One 
of the chief reasons why_girls ‘enter the life of
prostitution,” says this report, “is evidently the
economic one. They cannot live on the wages paid ;
them.” ' _ "

‘_‘Nearly all” (of the 300 prostitutes considered),
says the Massachusetts report (1914), “come from
families in adverse circumstances * * * Only a
few even pretended to come from normal, well-
conducted homes, with a good father and mother
who were able and willing properly to protect and
bring up their children.”

The Philadelphia commission, in dealing with the
causes which induced 258 girls to enter the life of
prostitution, made the following apportionment
(1913): inadequate support, 125; lack of recreation,
44-;»demoralizing surroundings and lack of super-
vision, 89. (That most of the apparently non-
economic causes, such as those given here, are ulti.—
mately resolvable into purely economic causes, is
alwmatter which will be touched upon later. Even

COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS. 1

The United States was the last nation of any im-
portance to take up the question of compensating

workmen for accidents.

The movement had begun

in Germany by thevpassage of a law on June 15,
1883, and by 1909 had spread all over Europe, to
Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.
At that time, however, not a single State in the.

Union had such a law among its statutes.

On May 30, 1908, a Federal act making compen-
sation for the death or injury of Government arti-
sans and laborers was approved, but the States still
hung back; All at once, beginning with 1911, State
measures began to be enacted, and at this time
thirty—ﬁve States and Territories have such laws.

Maryland was the first State to pass a measure
which, though it was greatly restricted, could rea-
sonably be called a workmen’s compensation law.
The act was in effect only from July 1, 1902, to
April 28, 1904, when it was declared unconstitu-

tional.
25, 1910), but
State courts.

New York came second (May 24 and June
this law also was invalidated by the
Not until after a constitutional amend-
ment was carried by the people was New York able,

to enact an effective law (December 12, 1913, to go

into effect July 1, 1914).

Maryland re-enacted a

partial compensation‘1aw (eﬁective May 1,1910),

and two years later a general law.

A new Federal law supplanting that of 1908, went

into effect Sept. 8, 1916.

The first State’ to put into

operation a fairly

general workmen’s compensation law was Neva a.
The table below gives the chronological record of

the

States in passing such laws, with the dates

when the laws went into effect, and the character

of" the laws

whether restricted to certain occupa-

tions consider-ed lizzzrardolis or inclusive of virtually

all employments. The distinction between

COPPER MINE PROFITS.

According to a statement made by Secretary of
Labor Wilson, the largest copper mine in the
Michigan district was organized in 1870 with a

 

capitalization of $2,500,000, only half of which was _

ever paid in. Since that time the company has paid
dividends amounting to $121,000,000 and has made
reinvestments out of its earnings of $75,000,000.
Nearly $200,000,000 of net proﬁts in 42 years on an
investment of $1.250.000. '

SOCIAL PATHOLOGY.

SUICIDES. ,
The suicide rate of the registration -area of the

,IJ_'nited States in 1913 was 15.8 per 100,000 popula-
tion. From these ﬁgures an estimate has been made >

for 1915 of 15,800 suicides. ,

According to the weekly insurance journal, The
Sp"ectator,'quoted by The Independent, March 23,
1914, in 100 American cities containing. a popula-
tion of 14,000,000 in 1893, there were about 2,100
suicides. In 1903, with a population of 18,000,000,
thesepcities had 3,500 suicides, and in 1912, with
23,000,000 population, 4,400 suicides. With an in-
creased population of less than three-quarters, the
number of suicides more than doubled.

The Independent continues:

“It is said that immediately after the earthquake
at San Francisco—though just before that the city
had enjoyed the same bad eminence of the highest
suicide rate as now——there were no se1f—murders
for many weeks. This is What might be expected,
for when everybody is suffering‘ _together there is
apparently much less temptation, to commit suicide
than at other times. A declaration of War usually
brings down the suicide rate in a country. On the
other hand,, a ﬁnancial panic always increases it.
A great many people suffer from the panic, but a
certain comparatively small number have to go
into bankruptcy or proclaim their failure in busi-
ness, and it is the comparison of their situation
with others that leads to unfortunate results.
Hence the truth of the expression that ‘the curve
of suicide frequency and the curve of business fail-
ures have a deﬁnite relation to each other’. Our
highest suicide rate in the last twenty years, 21.8
per 100,000 of population, came in 1908, the year
after the panic. In 1909, when business difficulties
were still causing many failures, the rate was 21.

It has been dropping since then and will probably"

continue to do so until there is another business
crisis.”

.According to Frederick L. Hoffman, statistician
of the Prudential Insurance Company of America,
the number of suicides ‘in 100 American cities for
the decade ended with 1912 was 40,794, a ﬁgure
approximating the estimate of The Spectator. Mr.
Hoffman computes the average suicide rate per

of 1904 says, however, that by reason of changing
modes of caring for the destitute, the relative de-
gree of pauperism cannot be determined. “The
number of paupers reported,” says the preliminary
report of Oct. 26, 1914, “is not a measure of the
extent of poverty in a community, because it de-
pends on the adequacy of the supply of almshouses
or the prevailing policy in regard to outdoor-relief,
on climatic conditions, and on the existence\or num-
ber of special institutions for children and for phy-
sical and mental defectives.”

342. THE ‘APPEAL ALMANAC AND

CAUSES OF WIFE DESERTION.

Judge Henry Neil, father of the Mothers’ Pension,
has spent many months investigating the causes of
wife desertion. During his work he crossed the
continent seven. times and stopped in almost every
city in the country.

Low wages to -workingmen he classes as the
fundamental cause. Eight other causes, all result-
ing from insufficient income, are as follows:

Unemployment—Changing a hard—working man
into a discouraged loafer.

Bad housing—Dwe1lings so small that the man
can ﬁnd no room for‘his leisure hours and is forced
to go out except when sleeping or eating.

Whiskey———Usual1y resorted to as a result of the
preceding causes.

Arrest and imprisonment of low-paid workers on
charges of failure to support families.

Interference of charity workers in the affairs of
low-paid workmen.

Feeling of disgrace because the worker has had
to accept charity.

Prison and military or naval experiences which
taught habits unﬁtting a man for home life.

Conduct of the wife.

Among well paid workmen, according to Judge
Neil, desertions are few; they increase as wages
go down. .

LYNCHING RECORD, 1915.

There were 69 lynchings during 1915, according

gee (Ala.) Institute. Of those lynched 55 were
Negroes and 14 were whites. In 1914 there were 49

_ MOTHERS’, PENSIONS.
Prepared for the Appeal by the Children’s Bureau.
According to a bulletin issued by the U. S. Chil-
dren’s Bureau, up to January, 1914, mothers’ pen-
sion laws had been ‘enacted in twenty-one States——
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massa-
chusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,

Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Okla--

homa (school scholarship), Oregon, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.

‘Mothers’ pensions were included in the initiated old

age pension act of Arizona in 1914 which has since
been declaredunconstitutional. During 1915 Kansas,
Montana, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, West
Virginia and Wyoming passed, new mothers’ pen-

sion laws, and Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma

nd Wisconsin completely revised their existing
aws. Amendments were passed also in a number
of other States. One State,'Maryland, was added to
the list in 1916. ’ 9

The funds for such pensions come from the county
treasuries in all States except California, Massa-
chusetts, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin‘where"par,t
of the expense is borne by the State.’ ,
y In Colorado and Nebraska the law applies to any
parent; in Wisconsin to mother or grandparent; in
most of the States, however, to-mothers only. In
some States as in Iowa,iMaryland, New Jersey, the
aid is restricted to widows. In others it covers
mothers whose husbands are totally incapacitated,
physically or mentally, or are conﬁned in State in-
stitutions. Unmarried mothers are included only in
Michigan. In most of the laws the requirement -is
made that the mother is a fit person, morally and
physically, to bring up her children. “The condi-
tions of residence vary widely in the_ different

States.

The mother (or parent) unable to‘ support a de-
pendent chi‘d is‘ paid a certain’ sum for eac‘ child.
The maximum allowance for one child runs from
$2.00 aweek in Iowa to $15.00 a month in Illinois,
Ohio, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.

Smaller amounts are paid for each additional child._
The maximum age of a child, on whose account an‘

allowance may be made varies from fourteen years
in California to eighteen.years in Nebraska and
Nevada. The legal working age is the limit in Ohio
and Pennsylva-nia. In most of the Statesethe law
is administered by the Juvenile Court or some other
County Court with similar functions. '

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917; 31'

the Philadelphia report virtually concedes the point.
“Any large body of wage-earning families," it. says,
“if dropped below a now fairly well-deﬁned stand-
ard'of living, speedily becomes a seed bed "for the
nurture of the inefficient and criminal ‘individuals
who are the bulk of the goods ‘on sale in the"bu"si-
ness of prostitution.” - '  “ 
“One -of these underlying causes for the social
evil,” the Grand Rapids, Mich., Commission, reports
(1913), “is the inadequate familiyfincome, which
we believe has a considerable bearing.” “A great
variety of unfavorable conditions,” 'r'eafds‘the Hart-
ford report (1913), “have drawn ‘daughters of the
poor’ into traffic with their bodies.” "‘That the
conditions under which women work tend to create
immorality cannot in general be questioned,” the
Wisconsin Commission reports (1914). “Low wages,”
says the Minneapolis report (1911-), “undoubtedly
increase the menace to good morals.” The—Port.—
land, Ore., report (1913) asserts that “the army (of,
prostitutes is largely recruited from the children
of the poor.” Economic factors are also emphasized
in the Pittsburgh report (1913). , -

The Illinois report republishes the paper on “The:

Relation of Low Wages to Vice,” ‘written in 1914
by Henry T. -Rogers, Jr., then ‘a student at'Yale
University:~' Referring to the report of the..pro-
ceedings of the congress of social reformers which
met in Washington in 1913, in which it was "said
that “the experts disagreed most vio1ently” ‘On.-zt'he‘
question ofthe relation of low wages to. prostitu-.

tion, he undertakes to show that low wa_g.es_.;prod,uce_

the general social conditions by which ~prostituti‘o'n‘
is maintained. The wages paid to a vast majority
of self-supporting women workers, he says,~ are
“very appreciably below the wage necessary for the
maintenance of a minimum standard of living.”
Moreover, low wages produce a great variety-“of
causes which undermine the health, .morals and
powers of resistance to temptation of the wage-
worker. Great pressure is brought to bear‘ on these‘
women by agents of prostitution and others, and“'is
most.usually exerted upon the girls least able».-lto
resist it. These premises he supports by a mass of
evidence taken from official_ and other s'tudies,‘,‘o'f
social conditions. Low wages, he concludes, are-‘
really a direct cause of prostitution, because,-they)
break down the physical and moral »streng;t.h.,of
women; and he quotes with approval the statemfetit:
of Jane Addams: (“Of course a girl in such’ a'”strait'
does not go out deliberately to (ﬁnd illiciit imethods

73.66 of the total school population. The average
daily attendance was 14,216,459, or 74.2 per cent. of
the enrollment. The average daily attendance was
just about 55 per cent. of the school population.

ONE OUT OF SIXTY FINISHES.

According to a diagram shown at the San Fran-

of utter weariness and discoura-gement to the tempta-

moment. The long‘ hours, the lack of comforts, the
low pay, the absence of recreation, the sense of

NEW RECORD IN INJUNCTIONS. 

J The anti-labor injunction issued by Judge Jesse"
A. Baldwin, of the Circuit Court of Illinois (June,":,

1916), in the case of the strike of 3,000 tannery"
workers-in Chicago, marks a new record in the

denial of constitutional rights by jud'ge-made law. _

Strikers were forbidden even to look scornfully or
contemptuously at strikebreakers. Among the pro-
hibitions speciﬁcally named were the following:
“From doing anything which subjects any of the
complainants’ employes to hatred, criticism, censure,
scorn, disgrace or annoyance because of their em-
ployment by the complainants, respectively, until
this honorable court in chancery sitting, shall make
order to the contrary. Hereof fail not, under pen-
alty of what the law (Judge Baldwin) directs.”

The strikers “and all others” were ordered not
to induce strikebreakers to leave their employment.
Under Judge Baldwin’s law it was declared “illegal”
for strikers to send “any circulars or other commu-
nications-to customers of the complainants, or to
other persons who might deal or transact business
with the ,co,m'p1,aina,nts.” Under this order these 3,000
workers were guilty of contempt of court if they
appealed even to prospective customers of the tan-
nery _trust foraid in aﬁght against a 12-hour day
and a wage. of $7 a week. ‘ l

INTRODUCTION.

One of the really important events of the year

1915 was the submission, on August 23d, of the
report of the United States Commission on Indus-
trial Relations. (A statement regarding the crea-
tion, work and personnel of the commission will be
found on page 161.
three separate parts, the first of which (the report
proper) is supplemented by several dissenting and
explantory statements, and the second and third
parts of which, published separately, relate to two,
special investigations made by George P. West
and Luke Grant. Other special investigations were
made by a staff of some forty employees, whose
reports Congress his requested to publish. The
whole is subdivided as follows:
i. (a) Report of Basil M. Manly, director of re-
search and investigation (known as the Staff
report). Signed (with reservations) by Frank

acter of its recommendations, its indictment of
conditions is masterly.) ~

34 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE STAFF REPORT.

The Staff report, after the introductory matter,
begins with a summary of labor conditions in the
principal industries, including agriculture. It says,
in part:

Labor Conditions.

“In considering the conditions of labor in American
industries, it has seemed that they could be judged
or appraised only by comparing conditions as they
actually exist with what knowledge and experience
shows that they might easily be made during the
immediate future, if proper action were taken to
utilize the resources of our Nation eificiently and
distribute the products equitably.

“As against this view there has been an attempt
by some persons to urge the judgment of all things
by comparison with the past. Much stress has been
laid by certain witnesses upon the alleged improve-
ment of the condition of the workers during the
past quarter century.

“This point, however, is regarded as generally
immaterial. The crux of the question rather is,
Have the workers received a fair share of the
enormous increase in wealth which has taken place
in this country, during the period, as a result
largely of their labors? The answer is emphatically
—-No!

Wealth and Wages.

“The wealth of the country between 1890 and
1912 increased from 65 to 187 billions, or 188 per
cent., whereas the aggregate income of wage-earners
in manufacturing, mining and transportation has
risen between 1889 and 1909 only 95 per cent., from
2,516 millions in 1889 to 4,916 millions in 1909.
Furthermore, the wage-earners’ share of the net
product of industry in the case of manufactures
was only 40.2 per cent. in 1909, as compared with
44.9 per cent. in 1889.

“Similarly, the attempt to dismiss deplorable
labor conditions in the United States by arguments
that they are better than in European countries is
repugnant. To say that conditions are better than
in Great Britain, for example, is simply to say that
somewhat less than one-third of the population is
in a state of absolute poverty, for that was the
condition reported by the latest British commis-
sion. It should be a matter of shame also to boast
that the condition of American laborers is better
than that of laborers in the ‘black bread belt’ of
Germany.

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. ' 35

“That conditions are, as a matter of fact, but
little better is proved conclusively by the almost
complete cessation of immigration from Germany,
England and France. No better proof of the
miserable condition of the mass of American work-
ers need be sought than the fact that in recent years
laborers in large numbers have come to this country
only from Russia, Italy, Austria-Hungary and the
backward and impoverished nations of southern and
eastern Europe. * * '

The Extent of Poverty.

“It is evident both from the investigations of this
Commission and from the reports of all recent
Governmental bodies that a large part of our in-
dustrial population are, as a result of the combina-
tion of low wages and unemployment, living in a
condition of actual poverty. How large this pro-
portion is cannot be exactly determined, but it is
certain that at least one-third and possibly one-half
of the families of wage-earners employed in manu-
facturing and mining earn in the course of the
year less than enough to support them in anything
like a comfortable and decent condition. The de-
tailed evidence is presented in a separate report
which is submitted for transmittal to Congress. At
this point it is sufficient to call attention to the
results of the most exhaustive and sweeping official
investigation of recent years, that of the Immigra-
tion Commission, which reported to Congress in
1909. This investigation secured detailed informa-
tion regarding the daily or weekly earnings of
619,595 employees of all classes in our basic manu-
facturing industries and in coal mining, and infor-

mation regarding income and living conditions for

15,726 families.

“It was found that the incomes of almost two-
thirds of these families (64 per cent.) were less
than $750 per year and of almost one-third (31
per cent.) were less than $500, the average for all
being $721. The average size of these families was
5.6 members. Elaborate studies of the cost of living
made in all parts of the country at the same time
have shown that the very least that a family of
ﬁve persons can live upon in anything approaching
decency is $700. It is probable that, owing to the
fact that the families investigated by the Immigra-
tion Commission were. to a large extent, foreign
born, the incomes reported are lower than the
average for the entire working population; never-

theless, even when every allowance is made for that -.

fact, the ﬁgures show conclusively that between

one-half and two-thirds of these families were
living below the standards of decent subsistence,
While about one-third were living in a state which
can be described only as abject poverty.” "' " "

Crowded Tenements and Pauper Burials.

“Other facts collected in this investigation show
conclusively that a very large proportion of these
families did not live in decency and comfort. Thirty
per cent. kept boarders and lodgers, a condition
repugnant to every ideal of American family life,
especially in the crowded tenements or tiny cot-
tages in which the wage-earners of America char-
acteristically live. Furthermore, in 77 per cent. of
the families two or more persons occupied each
sleeping room, in 37 per cent. three or more persons,
and in 15 per cent. four or more persons.

“The most striking evidence of poverty is the
proportion of pauper burials. The repugnance of
all classes of wage—earners of all races to pauper
burial is such that everything will be sacriﬁced
and heavy debt incurred rather than permit any
member of the family to lie in the ‘potters’ ﬁeld’;
nevertheless in New York City one out of every
twelve corpses is buried at the expense of the city
or turned over to physicians for dissection.” "’ * *

High Death Rate Among Poor Children.

“It has been proved by studies here and abroad
that there is a direct relation between poverty and
the death rate of babies; but the frightful rate at
which poverty kills was not known, at least for
this country, until very recently, when through a
study made in Johnstown, Pa., by the Federal Chil-
dren’s Bureau, it was shown that the babies whose
fathers earned less than $10 per week died during
the ﬁrst year at the appalling rate of 256 per 1,000.
On the other hand, those whose fathers earned $25
per week or more died atthe rate of only"84 per
1,000. The babies of the poor died at three times
the rate of those who were in fairly well-to—do
families. The tremendous signiﬁcance of these
ﬁgures will be appreciated when it is known that
one-third of all the adult workmen reported by the
Immigration Commission earned less than $10 per
week, even exclusive of time lost“ On the showing
of Johnstown these workmen may expect one out of
fofur of their babies to die during the first yearof

largest cities from‘ 12 to 20 per cent. of the children
are noticeably underfed and ill—nourished.

Limiting Education and Fostering Crime.

“The minimum amount of education which any
child should receive is certainly the grammar school
course, yet statistics show that only one-third of
the children in our public schools complete the
grammar school course. and less than 10 per cent.
ﬁnish high school. Those who leave are almost
entirely the children of the workers, Who, as soon
as they reach working age, are- thrown, immature,
ill-trained, and with no practical knowledge, into
the complexities of industrial life. In each of four
industrial towns studied by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, more than 75 per cent. of the children
quit school before reaching theseventh grade.

“The great seriousness of this condition is even
more acutely realized when it is known that in the
families of the workers 37 per cent. of the mothers
are at work and consequently unable to give the
children more than scant attention._ Of these
mothers 30 per cent. keep boarders and lodgers and
7 per cent. Work outside the home.

“As a ﬁnal statement of the far—reaching effects
of the economic condition of American Wage—earn—
ers, it seems proper to quote the following state-
ment of the Chicago Commission on Crime, which
after thorough investigation has reported during
the past year:

“ ‘The pressure of economic conditions has an
enormous inﬂuence in producing certain types of
crime. Unsanitary housing and working conditions,
unemployment, wages inadequate to maintain a
human standard of living, inevitably produce the
crushed or distorted bodies and minds from which
the army of crime is recruited. The crime problem
is not merely a question of police and courts; it
leads to the broader problems of public sanitation.
education, home care, a living wage, and industrial
democracy.’ ”

Tenantry in Agriculture.

“In agriculture there is no array of exact figures
which can be quoted to show the condition of labor.
But, speaking generally, the available evidence indi-
cates clearly that while in some sections agricul-
tural. laborers are Well paid and fairly treated, the
condition of the mass is very much like that of the
industrial Workers.

“Moreover, there is a peculiar condition in agri-
.r-ulture, which merits a brief but strong statement

 

38 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

at this point as a preface to a more detailed dis-
cussion later. The most alarming fact in American
agriculture is the rapid growth of tenancy. In 1910
there were 37 tenant-operated farms in each 100
farms in the United States, as compared with 28 in
1890, an increase of 32 per cent. during 20 years.
No nation-wide investigation of the condition of
tenant farmers has ever been made, but in Texas,
where the investigations of this Commission were
thorough and conclusive, it was found not only that
the economic condition of the tenant was extremely
bad, but that he was far from being free, while his
future was regarded as hopeless. Badly housed, ill-
nourished, uneducated and hopeless, these tenants
continue year after year to eke out a bare living,
moving frequently from one farm to another in the
hope that something will turn up. Without a large
family the tenant cannot hope to succeed or break
even, so in each tenant family numerous children
are being reared to a future which under present
conditions will be no better than that of their
parents, if as good. The wife of a typical tenant
farmer, the mother of eleven children, stated in her
testimony before the Commission that in addition
to the rearing of children, making their clothes and
doing the work of the house, she always helped with
the crops, working up to within three or four
months before children were born, and that during
all the years of her married life she had had no
ready-made dresses and only three hats.” * * "

Condition of Agricultural Laborers.

“The condition of agricultural laborers cannot,
however, be dismissed without referring to the
development of huge estates which are operated by
managers with hired labor on what may properly
be called a ‘factory system.’ The conditions upon
such estates are deplorable not only because of the
extremely low wages paid (80 cents per day in the
case of one which was carefully investigated), but
even more because these estates, embracing within
their boundaries entire counties and towns, are a
law unto themselves and the absolute dictators of
the lives, ‘liberties and happiness of their employees.
It is industrial feudalism in an extreme form. Such
estates are, as a rule, the property of absentee land-
lords, who are for the most part millionaires, resi~
dent in the eastern States or in Europe.” * * "

Causes of Unrest.

The report then treats of existing relations be-

tween employers and employees and next of the

 

 

 

 

ARSENAL OF FACTS. 1917. 39

causes of industrial unrest. On the latter point it
says, in part:
“The sources from which this unrest springs are,

    

when stated in full detail, almost numberless. But -

upon careful analysis of their real character they
will be found to group themselves almost without
exception under four main sources which include
all the others. These four are: p
“1. Unjust distribution of wealth and income.
“2. Unemployment and denial of an opportunity
to earn a living.
“3. Denial of justice in the creation, in the
adjudication and in the administration of law.
“4. Denial of the right and opportunity to form
effective organizations.”

Unjust Distribution.

 

  

Under the sub-heading, “Unjust Distribution of‘

Wealth and Income,” the report assembles statistical
and other information showing the vast disparity
between the average possessions of the few and
those of the many. It proceeds: .

“We have, according to the income tax returns,
forty-four families with incomes of $1,000,000 or
more, whose members perform little or no useful
service, but whose aggregate incomes, totalling at
the very least ﬁfty millions per year, are equivalent
to the earnings of 100,000 wage—earners at the
average rate of $500.

“The ownership of wealth in the United States
has become concentrated to a degree which is diffi-
cult to grasp. The recently published researches
of a statistician of conservative views* have shown
that as nearly as can be estimated the distibution
of wealth in the United States is as follows:

“The ‘Rich,’ 2 per cent. of the people, own 60
per cent. of the wealth.

“The ‘Middle Class,’ 33 per cent. of the people,
own 35 per cent. of the wealth. »

“The ‘Poor,’ 65 per cent. of the people, own 5
per cent. of the wealth.

“This means in brief that a little less than, two
million people, who would make up a city smaller
than Chicago, own 20 per cent. more of the Nation’s
wealth than all the other ninety millions.

“The ﬁgures also show that with a reasonably
equitable division of wealth, the entire population
should occupy the position of comfort and security
which we characterize as middle class.

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

One Man’s Fortune.

“The actual concentration has, however, been
carried very much further than these ﬁgures indi—
cate. The largest private fortune in the United
States, estimated at one billion dollars, is equivalent
to the aggregate wealth of 2,500,000 of those who
are classed as ‘poor,’ who are shown in the studies
cited to own on the average about $400 each.

“Between the two extremes of superﬂuity and.

poverty is the large middle class——farmers, manu-
merchants, professional men, skilled

more or less" adequate for their legitimate needs
and desires, and who are rewarded more or less
exactly in proportion to service. They have prob-
lems to meet in adjusting expenses to income, but

the pinch of want and hunger is not felt, nor is
. there the deadening, devitalizing effect of superﬂu-

ous, unearned wealth.

“From top to bottom of society, however, in all‘

grades of incomes, are an innumerable‘ number of
parasites of every conceivable type. They perform
no useful service, but drain oﬂ’ from the income
of the producers a sum whose total cannot be
estimated.” * * *

Recommends Inheritance Tax.

Summing up conclusions under this heading the

report recommends a graduated inheritance tax:

“It is suggested that the Commission recommend‘
to Congress the enactment of an inheritance_tax, so«

graded that, while making generous provision for
the support of dependents and the education of
minor children, it. shall leave no large accumula~

tion of wealth to pass into hands which had no:

principal purposes:
“1 The extension of education.

“.2: The development of other important social‘

services which should properly be performed
by the Nation, which are discussed in detail
elsewhere.

“'3. The development, in co-operation with States»

and municipalities, of great constructive
works, such as road building, irrigation and
reforestation, which wouid materially in-
crease the efficiency and welfare of the
entire Nation.” * * " ‘

“There is no legislation which could be passed‘

by Congress, the immediate and ultimate effects of

 

 

 

  

ARSENAL OF FACTS. 1917. 41

which would be more salutary or wowld more
greatly assist in tempering the existing spirit of
unrest.”

Unemployment.

Under the heading of “Unemployment and the
Denial of Opportunity to Earn a Living,” the report
says:

“A careful analysis of all available statistics
shows that in our great basic industries the work-
ers are unemployed for an average of at least one-
ﬁfth of the year, and that at all times ‘during any
normal year there is an army of men, who can be
numbered only by hundreds of thousands, who are
unable to ﬁnd work or who have so far_deg'enerated
that they cannot or will not work. Can any nation
boast of industrial ,.efficiency when the workers,
the source of her productive wealth. are employed
to so small a fraction of their total capacity?

“Fundamentally this unemployment seems to rise
‘from two great causes, although many others are
contributory. First. the inequality of the distribu-
tion of income, which leaves the great masses of
the population (the true ultimate consumers) un-
‘able to purchase the products of industry which
they create, while a few have such a superﬂuity
that it cannot be normally consumed but must be
invested in new machinery for production or in
the further monopolization of land and natural re-
sources. The result is that in mining‘ and other
basic industries we have an equipment in plant
and developed property far in excess of the de-
mands of any normal year, the excess being, in all
probability, at least 25 per cent. Each of these
mines and industrial plants keeps around it a
labor force which, on the average, can get work
for only four-ﬁfths of the year, while at the same
time the people'have never had enough of the
products of those very industries—have never been
adequately fed, clothed, housed, nor warmed——for
the very simple reason that they have never been
paid enough to permit their purchase.

“The second principal cause lies in the denial

‘of access to land and natural resources even when

they are unused and unproductive, except at a
price and under conditions which are practically
prohibitive.” * " "

The Land in Relation to Unemployment.

With respect to the land question, as it relates
to the problem of unemployment, the report sub-
mitted the following “basic suggestions.”:

“1. Vigorous and unrelenting prosecution to re-

 

   
 

 * ......_ _n ___,l.

 
 
 
  
  
  

42 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

rights

gain all land, water power and mineral
secured from the Govenment by fraud.

“2. A general revision of our land laws, so as
to apply to all future land grants the doctrine of
‘superior use,’ as in the case of water rights in
California, and provision for forfeiture in case
of actual non-use. In its simplest form the doctrine
of ‘superior use’ implies merely that at the time
of making the lease the. purpose for which the
land will be used must be taken into consideration,

and the use which is of greatest social value shall

be given preference.

“3. The forcing of all unused land into use by
making the tax on non-productive land the same
as on productive land of the same kind, and ex-
empting all improvements.”

(Other measures for dealing with unemployment
are discussed in the latter part of the report).

The Denial of Justice.

The report then takes up the denial of justice to
the workers and treats of the general refusal of
legislative bodies to enact remedial laws, the action
of the courts in declaring unconstitutional the few
meritorious measures that are forced to passage
and in supporting the blacklist and injunction,
while repressing the boycott. On this subject the
following recommendations are made:

“1. That Congress forthwith initiate an amend-
ment to the Constitution providing in speciﬁc terms
for the protection of the personal rights of every
person in the United States from encroachment by
the Federal and State Governments and by private
individuals, associations and corporations. The
principal rights which should be thus speciﬁcally
protected by the power of the Federal Government
are the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the
right to jury trial, to free speech, to peaceful
assemblage, to keep and bear arms, to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures, to speedy pub-
lic trial and to freedom from excessive bail and
from cruel and unusual punishments.

“2. That Congress immediately enact a statute‘.

or, if deemed necessary, initiate a constitutional
amendment, speciﬁcally prohibiting the courts from
declaring legislative acts unconstitutional.

“ That Congress. enact that in all Federal
cases where the trial IS by jury, all qualiﬁed voters
in the district shall be included in the list from
which ‘more are selected and that they shall be
drawn y the use of a wheel or other device de»
signed to promote absolute impartiality.

 

 

 

 

»,...~., ...»- ..., ..

 

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 43

“4. That Congress drastically regulate or pro-
hibit private detective agencies doing business in
more than one State, employed by a company doing
an interstate business, or using the mails in con-
nection with their business. Such regulation, if
it is feasible, should include particularly the limita-
tion of their activities to the bona ﬁde functions of
detecting crime, and adequate provision should be
made for the rigid supervision of their organization
and personnel.” * " "

Denial of the Right of Organization.

The report next discusses the general denial of
the right of the workers to organize and makes
the following recommendations:

“1. Incorporation among the rights guaranteed
by the Constitution of the unlimited right of indi-
viduals to form associations, not for the sake of
proﬁt, but for the advancement of their individual
and collective interests.

“2. Enactment of statutes speciﬁcally protecting
this right and prohibiting the discharge of any
person because of his membership in a labor organ-
ization. ,

“3. Enactment of a statute providing that action
on the part of an association of individuals, not
organized for proﬁt, shall not be held to be un-
lawful where such action would not be unlawful
in the case of an individual.

“4. That the Federal Trade Commission be
speciﬁcally empowered and directed by Congress,
in determining unfair methods of competition, to
take into account and speciﬁcally investigate the
unfair treatment of labor in all respects, with
particular reference to the following points:

“a. Refusal to permit employees to become mem-

bers of labor organizations.

“b. Refusal to meet or confer with the authorized

representatives of employees.

“5. That the Department of Labor, through the
Secretary of Labor or any other authorized official,
be empowered and directed to present to the Federal
Trade Commission, and to prosecute before that
body, all cases of unfair competition arising out
of the treatment of labor which may come to its
attention. \_

“6. That such cases, affecting as they do the
lives of citizens in the humblest circumstances, as
well as the proﬁts of competitors and the peace of
the community, he directed by Congress to have
precedence over all other cases before the Federal
Trade Commission.”

unrest given in the ﬁrst part of this summary was
adopted by a majority vote, Commissioners Walsh,
Lennon, O’Connell, Garretson and Weinstock
voting in its favor.

A series of statements: (1) declaring for woman
suffrage; (2) recommending the public ownership
of coal mines; (3) prohibiting the employment of

mine owners, particularly John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
and requesting Congress to summon Rockefeller
and W. L. Mackenzie King before that body and
compel them to answer questions they refused to
answer before the Commission, was approved by
Commissioners Walsh, Lennon, O’Connell and Gar-
retson.

A statement declaring that the funds of the
Rockefeller “foundation” consisted of wages with-
held by force and cunning from labor; that the
charter of the “foundation” should be revoked and
that the funds should be conﬁscated and used for

the creation and maintenance of public works, was

approved by Commissioners Walsh, Lennon and
O'Connell. The report of Commissioner Lennon in
favor of a great extension of vocational education
was signed also by Commissioners Walsh, O’Con-
nell, Garretson and Ballard.

A statement, (1) praising the Staff report for its
thoroughness and accuracy, but, (2) dissenting
from the recommendation calling for the establish-
ment of a National board of mediation, (3) de-
claring the further organization of labor to be the
chief means of redressing social evils, (4) ap-
proving the “supplemental statement” of Chairman
Walsh, (5) concurring in the criticism of the Com-
mons-Harriman report by Chairman Walsh, (6)
concurring in that part of the report of Com-
missioner Garretson under the heading “Causes
Underlying Industrial Unrest,” and concurring in
the report of George P. West on the Colorado

strike, was signed by Commissioners Lennon and -

O’Connell.

The “Supplemental Statement”_ of Commissioner
Garretson dissents from the recommendation in the
Staff report of the creation of a National mediation
board; approves the West report on Colorado;
favors the extension of the Newlands act, though
with limitation of powers of the body created by
it; concurs in the reports of Commissioners Lennon
and O’Connell except in certain instances; dissents
in whole from the Commons-Harriman report and
elaborates his own views on the causes of indus-
trial unrest.

The “Supplemental Statement” of Chairman Walsh
recites at some length his views on industrial un-
rest, dissents from the Staff report in regard to
the proposed National board of mediation and the
literacy test in immigration, declares the reforms
recommended in regard to coal camps more easily
obtained through public ownership, and dissents
in whole from the Commons-Harriman report. ‘

 

    

  

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

The Commons-Harriman Report.

The report of Prof. John R. Commons and Mrs.
Florence J. Harriman (signed also, with reserva-
tions, by Commissioners Weinstock, Ballard and
Aishton) dissents from all the ﬁndings and recom-
mendations of the Staff report, “because they have
not the criticism of employers, employees and others
affected by them,” and therefore lack assurance of
accuracy. This report is based on the thesis that
the system of labor legislation in the United States
has broken down and that what is needed is not
new laws, but new machinery for investigation,
legislation and administration. Governments alone,
says the report, cannot be looked to for remedying
evil conditions. The greatest improvements to
come are to be expected through co-operation with
government of such voluntary organizations as em-
ployers’ associations, labor unions and farmers’
societies.

Accordingly the report develops an elaborate and
detailed plan of a Federal commission, as well as
State commissions, for the administration of all
labor laws. All bureaus dealing in any way with
industrial conditions are to be placed under the
direction_of such commission or commissions. Each
commission is to consist of three members, ap-
pointed by the governor (by the President in the
case of the Federal commission) to serve for six
years, except that the ﬁrst appointees shall be
named for various terms in order that no two shall
retire at the same time. Advisory councils are
also provided for. The report is somewhat vague
as to the degree of the commissions’ powers. The
whole scheme is a curious mixture of Jeffersonian
democracy and Prussian bureaucracy. s

A note by Commissioner Weinstock dissents from
a statement in the Commons-Harriman report that
new restrictions on immigration should be enacted.
The Commissioner asserts that we already have
abundant immigration laws and that immigration is
a good instead of an evil.

‘ The Employers’ Report.

As members of the Commission appointed to
represent the employers, Messrs. Weinstock, Ballard
and Aishton join in a report in which they recite
the difficulties that prevent the full recognition

of the unions by the employing class. They dis-~

sent from the recommendation in the Commons-
Harriman report that the secondary boycott be
legalized and also dissent from the proposed limita-
tion of governmental inquiry regarding labor dis-

putes to cases wherein both sides invite such in-
quiry. They declare the Staff report to be partisan
and unfair, and though acknowledging the evidence
before the Commission showing that many em-
ployers had been guilty of grave wrongs toward
labor and society, assert that organized labor also
is chargeable with serious offenses.

They assert themselves in favor of collective
bargaining, but declare that many enlightened em-
ployers refuse to deal with organized labor for one
or more of a number of reasons. “The prime ob-
jection,” they say, “that such employers have to
recognizing and dealing with organized labor is
the fear of: (a) sympathetic strikes, (b) jurisdic-
tional disputes, (c) labor union politics, (.d) con-
tract breaking, (e) restriction of output, (f) pro-
hibition of the use of non-union tools and materials,
(g) closed shop, (h) contests for supremacy be-
tween rival unions, (i) acts of violence against
non-union workers and the properties of employers,
and (j) apprenticeship rules.”

The report is a development of these points and
ends with the expression of a hope that “employers
will strive to work with, rather than against, in-
telligent labor representatives in aiding, through
these various movements, to lessen industrial un-
rest and to still further improve the condition of
wage-earners and their dependents.” Though it is
confessedly written from the employers’ standpoint,
the comment must be made that it is the most
carefully prepared document in the whole report.

A supplemental statement by Commissioner Bal-
lard, which concludes the volume, develops some
individual views on the causes of industrial unrest;

Two Special Reports.
;The report on the Colorado strike and that on

the situation in the structural iron industry, previ-
ously mentioned, are printed in separate volumes.

CAPITAL OFFENSES A CENTURY AGO.

In Great Britain until 1827 stealing a sheep was"

a capital crime. An act of that year removed the
distinction between grand and petit larceny; be-
fore that year the theft of goods above the value
of 12 pence, in the house of the owner though not
from his person, was a capital crime. In 1800, over
200 and in 1819 about 180 crimes were punishable
by the death penalty.

The Age of the Earth. '

In a publication issued in July. 1910, by the
Smithsonian Institution, the age of the earth was
estimated by Frank Wigglesworth Clarke and
George F. Becker, of the Geological Survey, as
“not above seventy million or below ﬁfty-ﬁve million
years.” The age of the earth always has been a
subject for discussion, among men of science, and
largely without any deﬁnite agreement among the
representatives of the different branches of studies
on account of the different points of approach. The
more recent discussions as to the earth’s age have
placed the time as’ follows: Lord Kelvin, in 1862,
20,000,000 to 400,000,000 years, with a probable
98,000,00 years; in 1897 Lord Kelvin revised his
figures to from 20,000,000 to 40,000,000 years; Clar-
ence King and Carl Varus, in 1893, 24,000,000 years;
De Lapparent, in 1890, 67,000,000 to 90,000,000 years;
Charles D. Walcott, secretary to the Smithsonian
Institution in 1893, maximum age, 70,000,000 years;
J. Joly, in 1899, age of the ocean, 80,000,000 to 90,-
000,000 years, and W. J. Sollas, in 1909, age of the
ocean, 80,000,000 to 150,000,000 years.

THE RACES OF MANKIND.

Controversy about race is endless and expresses
itself often in extreme ‘diversities of opinion. From
the school that declares “race is nothing,” there is
a regular gradation of view up to that which de-
clares that “race is everything.” Much of this
controversy, however, is concerned not with race
but with groups or families or stocks of the same
race. Much of it, moreover, is concerned with mental
rather than with physical differences or re- -
semblances.

All observers agree that there are marked
physical differences among men, that certain types
are persistent, and that the strongly marked types
are localized in various sections of the earth. Many
attempts at scientiﬁc classiﬁcation have been made.
Some are based on distribution (or localization),
others on the shape of the top or back of the skull,
still others on the color of the skin, or the straight-
ness or waviness of the hair, and yet others on
language. The language test has generally been
given up, and in general the test of craniology, or
skull shape.

The arrangement of Prof. Amos W.‘ Butler, based
largely on Blumenthal and Huxley, is given below.
It classiﬁes mankind into five main races, with
13 branches, 35 “stocks” and uncounted groups.
The word “peoples” is used for a number of groups.
For instance, the German and French groups be-
long to the Indo-Germanic peoples, to the Aryac or
Aryan stock, and to the North Mediterranean
branch of the European race. Huxley’s distinction
between the “fair whites” of North Europe and
the “dark whites” of South Europe is not shown in
the table. The “dark whites” are supposed to be
a blend of the North.Mcditcrranean and the South
Mediterranean branches.

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917.

THE VANISHING AMERICAN RACE.

In an article by an eminent authority, Dr. Henry
Smith Williams, syndicated by the National Editorial
Service, and published in the summer of 1915, the
following interesting sociological facts appear: .

The census returns show that for every thousand
individuals of the population,~351 are either of
foreign birth or are the children of foreign—born
parents; and that 107 per 1,000 are Negroes. As to
the remaining 538, who are native born and of
native parents, it would be a high estimate to
assume that half are the descendants of the four
million colonists of 1790 unmixed with the blood
of the nine million prior to 1880.

We may fairly compute that in an average 100
individuals of our present-day population, there
are no more than twenty-seven of pure colonial
stock, as against twenty-seven whose ancestors
came to America not more than two generations
ago, thirty-ﬁve who are aliens or of foreign-born
parentage and eleven Negroes.

In Massachusetts, as a whole, there are 117,000
Russians, 89,000 Italians, 48,000 natives of the
Scandinavian countries, 35,000 Austrians, 30,000
Germans, 26,000 Portuguese, 16,000 Turks, 11,000
Greeks, 10,000 Finns. In a single recent year 100,000
immigrants have come to Massachusetts. Two
persons out of three in the whole State are either
foreign—born or the children of foreign-born par-
ents. In one town of less than seven thousand
people, there are representatives of twenty-one
different nationalities, who speak as many different
languages. s

As further illustrating the changed character of
the American race in the centers of population, we
may note that the native whites of native parentage
number only 19.3 per cent. of the total population
of New York City, and only 14.8 per cent. of the
population of Manhattan Borough. Chicago is not
much better off, having only 20.4 per cent. of native
whites of native parentage.

Moreover, this new stock is enormously proliﬁc,
whereas the old colonial stock has become alarm-
ingly infecund. Had the twenty-seven million

Americans who were here in 1860 maintained the
family traditions of their parents and grandparents,
their descendants would have numbered one hundred
and four millions in the year 1910, without taking
stock of the immigrants; whereas in point of fact
the total population of the United States in 1910
was only ninety—two millions, even though twenty-

 

  

60 THE APPEAL ALMANAC »AN-D

three million, immigrants’ hadcome in the mean-
time and proved themselves far more proliﬁc than
the natives. . 7 A a‘
As to the latter point, it appears (accordingto
the census records of 1910) that the total white
population of America increased in the decade 1900—
1910 by 22.3 per cent. But only 14 per cent. of this
was natural increase, of the native whitepopulation;
whereas the increase of foreign-born was 730.7 per
cent. In the State of New York, the number of
immigrants who made permanent settlement each
year exceeds the number of babies born.
_Obviously‘ our race is being transformed’v.ery
rapidly‘ indeed——~more rapidly, in all probability,
than any race was ever transformed before._ If
our racial development should continue for the
ensuing half—century as it has in the past half-
century, the population of the ‘United States in the
ye’ar»1960 will number two hundred and seventy—six
millions, but two hundred and ﬁfty million of these
will be of alien heritage within three generations,
outnumbering the members of the colonial race al-
most ten to one. .

JEWISH POPULATION.

The London Jewish Year Book for 1915 estimates
the number of'Jews in the United States as 2,043,762
and in Russia as 6,060,415. The American Jewish
Year Book for 1910 gives the following estimates:
United States, 1,777,185; Russia, 5,215,805; British
Empire,‘ 380,809; Turkey, 462,686; Austria—Hungary,
2,084,591; Germany, 607,862. The total number of
Jews in the world is estimated (1914) at 13,277,542.
Boththe estimates above of the Jewish population of
the United States are generally regarded as too low.

ALASKA’S MINERAL PRODUCTION.

The value of the mineral production of Alaska in
1915, according to the United States Geological Sur-
vey, amounted to $82,854,229-—$13,788,563 more than
the value in 1914 and far more than that of any
previous annual output during the 36 years that
mining has been carried on in the Territory. The
value of the gold produced during the year amounted
to $16,702,144, copper $15,139,129, and silver $543,-
393.‘ Tin, lead, antimony, marble, gypsum,Aand a
small amount of petroleum and coal were alsoimined.

Since’ 1880, when mining ﬁrst began in ‘Alaska,
the Territory has ‘produced gold, silver, copper, tint,
and other minerals to the value of $300,953,751,

THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

LEGAL HOLIDAYS.

There is no national legal holiday, not even the
Fourth of July. Congress has at various times
appointed special holidays. In the second session
of the Fifty-third Congress it passed an act making
Labor Day a public holiday in the District of
Columbia, and it has recognized the existence of
certain days as holidays for commercial purposes.
The proclamation of the President designating a
day of Thanksgiving makes it a legal holiday only
in the District of Columbia and the Territories.

Each of the States designates the legal holidays
observed therein.

There are no statutory holidays in Mississippi,
but by common consent Lee’s birthday, the Fourth
of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas are observed.
In New Mexico, Washington’s Birthday, Decoration
Day, Labor Day, Flag Day (June 14) and Arbor Day
are holidays when so designated by the Governor.
In South Carolina, Thursday of Fair Week is a legal
holiday.

Arbor Day is a legal holiday in many States, al-
though in some it is observed as designated by the
Governor.

Every Saturday after 12 o’clock noon is a legal
holiday in California in public offices, Illinois (in
cities of 200,000 or more inhabitants), Maryland,
Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsyl-
vania, Rhode Island, Virginia, the District of

Orleans, La., and Charleston, S. C.; in Louisiana in
all cities exceeding 10,000 inhabitants; in Missouri
in cities of 100,000 or more inhabitants; in Tennes-
see, for State andcounty offices, and in Colorado

COST AND REVENUES OF PANAMA CANAL.

The cost of the Panama Canal, including $50,000,-
000 paid to the New French Canal Company and to
Panama, will be about $375,000,000 when the last
appropriation is made. It is estimated that operat-
ing expenses will run from four to ﬁve million
dollars annually. Between the opening of the canal,
August 14, 1914, and June 30, 1915, the receipts
were $4,343,383.69, and operating expenses $4,112,-
550.48. To August, 1916, tolls reached the aggregate
of $7,217,956. Of this sum $1,923,122 was collected
from vessels in the coastwise trade of the United
Sltateg. For many months in 1915 the canal was

68 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE METRIC SYSTEM.
Origin of the System.

From publications of the Federal Bureau of
Standards.

The essential features of the metric system were-
embodied in a report made to the French National’
Assembly by the Academy of Sciences in 1791. A
number of other nations were invited to co-operate
with France in establishing the new system, and?
Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and several
minor states were represented on an international
commission which met i-n Paris in 1799 to accept.
the metric standards constructed under the direc-
tion of the French Institute.

Although the metric system very soon attracted
the favorable attention of other nations, it was
not until forty years later that its use became
general in France. Since 1840, however, its use
has rapidly spread, until at the present time it is
either obligatory or permissive in every civilized
country in the world. Its use was made “lawful
throughout the United States" by Act of Congress
in 1866, and at the same time provision was made
to supply every State in the Union with a set of
metric weights and measures.

No organized effort had been made up to this time
to supply the different countries with authentic:
copies of the metric prototypes which were preserved
in the archives of France. In order to meet the de-
mand for accurate standards whose relation to one‘
another would be known with the highest precision,
metric conventions were held in Paris in 1870 and‘.
1872, which were attended by official delegates from
about thirty countries. At these conferences com--
mittees were appointed to investigate the best form
and material for the proposed new standards. In
1875 a treaty was signed at Paris by seventeen of the‘
principal nations of the world, the United States be-
ing among the number, which provided for the per-
manent organization of an International Bureau of
Weights and Measures under the direction of an In-
ternational Committee. The most important work of
the International Committee was to provide for the-
construction of a sufficient number of platinum-
iridium meters and kilograms to meet the demand of
the interested nations. The comparison of all these
standards with one another and with the original
meter and kilogram was made at the International
Bureau, which had been established near Paris on
neutral territory ceded to the International Commit-
tee by the French government.

This work was,completed in 1889, and, after select-
ing a certain meter and a certain kilogram as the
international -prototypes, the others were distributed
by lot to thepdifferent countries. The international

meter and kilogram have values identical with the,

original meter and kilogram, are preserved in
a special underground vault at the International
Bureau and are accessible only tothe International
Committee. The United States secured two meters
and two kilograms, which are now preserved at the
Bureau of Standards at Washington and serve as

the fundamental standards of length and mass of the
United States. V

ico, Peru, Portugal, Rumania, Servia, Sweden, Nor-
way, Switzerland, Venezuela, Japan and Denmark.

The advantages claimed for the metric systeml
are:

(1) The decimal relation between the units.

(2) The extremely simple relation of the units of
length, area, volume and weight to one another.

UNCLE SAM’S INSURANCE BUSINESS.

According to the report of the director of the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance, of the Treasury
Department, the bureau wrote 1,245 policies on
risks aggregating $82,709,689 in its ﬁrst year of
existence. The’ premiums received aggregated
$2,004,695.65, and the net losses paid amounted to
$695,420.98, leaving a surplus of $1,309,274.67. The
War Risk Bureau was created by act of Congress,
Sept. 2, 1914, to insure vessels and cargoes in are-—

 

’ sponse to the protests against the extortionate rates-.

a_sl§‘ed by private insurance companies to cover war
1‘1S s.

To August 23, 1916, more than 1,500 policies had
been issued, with $141,415,302 of insurance. Losses.
to the latter date amounted to $771,329, less $58,811;
recovered in salvage. The net proﬁt to the Treasury
Department amounted to $2,237,859.

72 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

ALIEN PROPERTY IN WAR.
From the New York Times.

International law has tried to safeguard the prin-
ciple of the inviolability of private property on land.
The fate of property in belligerent territory is sub-
ject to casualties of war, but it depends not upon
the nationality or loyalty of the, owner, but upon
the location of the property itself.

According to Continental practice nationality is
the test of enemy character, so that subjects of
belligerents and their property bear enemy char--
acter, whereas subjects of neutrals and their prop--
erty do not. Under the Anglo-American rule domi--
cile is the test of enemy character regardless of
nationality, and subjects of an enemy State do not
necessarily bear enemy character.

Neutral and enemy property in hostile territory
are in general subject to the same treatment.
Where such property is seized or destroyed for
strategic reasons directly incident to belligerent
action, the private owners need not be compen-
sated, but, as an act of grace, a State may after
peace consent to compensate its subjects and even
domiciled aliens for their losses.

According to Article 23 of the last Hague Regula-
tions, the destruction of private property, even of
enemy aliens, is illegitimate—where no military end
is served. Private enemy real property cannot be
appropriated. Private movables may be appropriated,
but they must be restored at the conclusion of peace
and indemnities paid. Article 46 provides that per-
sonal property, other than war material, may not,
as a rule, be appropriated, though under exceptional
circumstances it may be seized.

When an invading belligerent becomes a military
occupant he is under still greater restrictions with
\espect to private property, according to the Hague
Regulations. ,

As to enemy merchant ships seized in port at
the outbreak of hostilities, both England and
Germany are subjecting such enemy vessels to
mere detention. .

 

‘ MAKING MUNITIONS

In the Krupp Works, at Essen, Germany, in 1906,
30,000 wage—earners were employed. A report in.
July, 1915, gave 100,000 as the number directly and
indirectly connected with the plant. The number of‘
munition makers in New England, in September,
1915, was computed at 84,000.

 

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 73

‘- THE TOBACCO AND LIQUOR BILL.

Exact ﬁgures of the total amounts expended an-
nually in the United States for tobacco, wines, malt
liqu_ors and spirits cannot be given, since they could

*be computed only by means of full records of all

retail sales. The approximate sums can, however,
be reached through the official ﬁgures and an esti-
mate of retail proﬁts.

In the ﬁscal year 1913 the consumption of Spirits
was 147,745,628 gallons (of which 4,121,981 were
imported); of wines 55,327,-461 (of which 6,643,612
were imported), and of .malt liquors 2,030,347,372
(of which 7,669,223 were imported). The average
consumption for every man, woman and child was
one and one-half gallons of whisky, brandy, gin
or rum, one-half gallon of wine and twenty and one-

\half gallons of ale, beer or porter. As a good

many persons, including children, women and pro-
hibitionists of both sexes, Went without, it may be
seen that the persons who did the drinking con-
sumed per capita a quantity far in excess of this
average. The internal revenue collected was $163,-
879,342.*54 on the spirits and. $66,266,989.60 on the
fermented liq-uors,»and the tariff collections on the
imported stuff totaled about $20,000,000. Both the
Internal Revenue Office and the National Grocers’
Association agree that the retail cost of our alco-
holic drink is about $1,724,807,519. The latest ﬁgures
indicate, however, a decrease in consumption. In
the period between November 12, 1914, and May 1,
1915, the internal revenue col1ections,,exc1usive of
the*deﬁciency tax, showed a loss of more than

$22,000,000. Approximately $15,000,000 of this loss.

is ;attributed to the decrease in the consumption of
alcoholic beverages

About half our tobacco crop is exported." We
also import a quantity in value about one-third of
the farm value of the total crop. Manufacture more
than doubles the farm value. and further value (or
price) is added by the tax and tariﬁ‘. The whole-
sale value of the tobacco consumed in 1914 has been
computed at $452,380,661. There seems to be an
agreement that the consumers pay about 33 per cent
more than-this, which would bring the total bill
to $603,174,215. , . ‘

74 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE NATIONAL INCOMEL .1850-1910."

A valuablenstudy of the national income is con-
tained in the book “The Wealth and,Income of the
People of the United States,” written by Dr. VVill-
ford Isbell King, instructor in statistics in the
University of Wisconsin, and published by the
Macmillan Company of New York in 1915.

Prof. King’s computations were made before the
publication of the Census Bulletin on the national
wealth for 1912 (issued in 1915), and his ﬁgures are
in the main taken from the census of 1910. By the
national income is meant the annual money value of
all the labor and service of the people of the United
States, the proﬁts of employers, the interest of
money-lenpdersand the rent of landlords. Since,
however, much land is held by its owners and does
not produce rent in the ordinary meaning, the term
rent is used in its economic sense and is regarded
as a percentage (4 percent. in Prof. King’s com-
putation) of the value of land (exclusive of the
hire of buildings or improvements). Interest is
regarded as from 6 to 8 per cent. of the estimated
value of existing capital goods (such as Warehouses,
office buildings, stores, machines, livestock, raw
materials and stocks of merchandise). The factors
of the national income are wages and salaries, in-
terest, rent and proﬁts. The total national income
for 1910 is put at $30,529,500,000. The ﬁgures for
the census years 1850-1910 inclusive are given in
millions of dollars as follows (in each case the last
ﬁve ciphers being omitted):

(In three cases in the foregoing table the ﬁgures
are reduced by one-tenth of 1 per cent. in order to
/avoid a confusing total in excess of 100 per cent.).

. What the Figures Show.

The ﬁgures show: 1» .

First——That land values have much less importance
than ascribed to them by the‘ single-taxers. The

   

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917; g A _ 75

statement frequently made that all increase of”

wealth goes to the landlord is found to be ridicu-
lously wide of the mark. Since 1850 the national
income has increased by twenty-eight billions,
whilerent has increased by only two and a half

.1 billions. Rent constituted 8.8 per cent. of the na-

tional income in 1860, and exactly the same per-

centage 50 years later. The Socialist contention.

that modern wealth is the product of the workshop
is abundantly proved.
Second——That labor since 1890 has received

» a decreasing share of the national income. Wages

and salaries are not separated in the table, but
since the wage-bill, by reason of the great number
of wage-earners, preponderates so largely over the
\salary bill, the fusion of the two factors into one
affects only slightly the result. “The total share
going to labor,” says the author, “has of recent
years been falling off, despite the efforts of labor
unions and combinations. It still remains a mooted
question Whether any labor organization not
monopolizing practically the whole wage-earning
class can, through combination, cause a larger
share of the total national income to be paid as
wages than would fall to the lot of labor under a
regime of free competition.”

The Distribution of Income.

A computation of the author regarding the dis-
tribution of the national income results in the con-
clusion that the poorest class of families, number-
ing 65 per cent. of the population, receive an aver-
age; income per capita of $197; the lower middle
class, numbering 15 per cent., $314; the upper middle
class, numbering 18» per cent., $494, and the richest,

V numbering 2 per cent., $3,386.

The richest class, numbering 2'per cent. of the
population, receive 20.4 per cent. of all the national
income; the upper middle class, numbering 18 per
cent., receive 26.8 per cent. of the income.; The two
classes together, numbering only 20 ‘per cent. of the
population, receive 47.2 p_er“cent., or nearly one-half

Wof the income, leaving the two other classes, num-

 

bering 80 per cent. of the population, with the other
half of the income. ~

ARSENAL OF FACTS, 1917. 79

OTHER CORPORATION PENSIONS.

The U. S. Steel Corporation dedicated $8,000,000
for a fund with which to pension superannuated
and disabled employes. This fund has been con-
solidated with the $4,000,000 fund created by Andrew
Carnegie after he sold out his holdings in the
Carriegie Steel Company to the U. S. Steel Corpora-

7 tion. The fund is known as “The United States

Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund.” 7

The Western Union Telegraph Company, on Janu-
ary 1, 1913, established a Plan for Employees’ Pen-
sions, Disability Benefits and Insurance, setting
aside a fund of $1,000,000 for the purpose. Pensions
are classiﬁed according to age and length of ser-
vice. The minimum pension is $20 per month, except
when otherwise directed. In cases of disability from
sickness, full pay and half pay are allowed for vari-
ous periods, depending upon length of service; pro-
vision is also made for disability resulting from
accidents and for life insurance beneﬁts, the amount
of insurance depending upon length of service.

July 31, 1916, Swift & Co., the packers, of Chicago,
announced a ‘$2,000,000 pension plan for employes,

‘including those in the main plants there and in

branch houses all over the country.
A notable feature is that -~employes do not con-

tribute to the fund. Officials estimated that $400,-

000 a year, in addition to the income of the $2,000,000
initiatory fund, will be required to conduct, the
system. About 28,000 men and women came under
the plan on the following day when it went into

' operation.

Men in the employ of the company twenty-ﬁve
years, who have reached the age of sixty, may be
pensioned. When they reach .the age of sixty-ﬁve,
they must retire on pension. Women’s ages are
ﬁxed at ﬁve years less. No pension will be less
than $240 per year and none over $5,000 a year.

The figures for Great Britain are those for 1911
plus the number of agricultural workers in 71912.

The ﬁgures for the Netherlands include 16,981
organized members of the military and police.

With the beginning of 1913 the unions of New
Zealand and the Union of South Africa became
affiliated with the International Federation.

The ﬁgures for Bulgaria are those for two na-
tional federations, one with 4,845 members and the
other with 8,502 members in July and September,
1912. The Servian ﬁgures are also for September,
1912. The effect of the Balkan War was to dis-
organize most of the unions. ,

No later report of the International Federation
has been published. The great war has had a de-

moralizing effect on the‘European organizations.

The membership of the unions in the A. F. of L
in 1915 (including Canada) numbered 1,946,347.

LINCOLN AND THE INTERNATIONAL.

The appreciation, encouragement and help given
to Lincoln by the militant section of the working
class in England and on the continent should never
be’ forgotten. At the darkest hour of the Civil
War the two monstergmeetings of workingmen,
in London and Manchester, December 31, 1862,
“prevented Palmerston,” in Marx’s words, “from
declaring war against the United States when he
was on the point of doing it.”

One of the ﬁrst public addresses issued by the
Central Council of the International Workingmen’s
Association, organized in London, September 28,
1864, was a letter to Lincoln congratulating the
people. upon his re-election. It was dated November
29th, and was written by Marx. It reads in part
as follows:

“We congratulate the .American people upon
your re-election by a large majority. If resistance
to ‘the slave power was the watchword of your ﬁrst
election, thp triumphal war-cry of your re-election
is, Death to s-lavery. From the commencement of

’,the 'titanic American strife the workingmen of

Europe felt instinctively that the Star Spangled
Banner carried the'destiny of their class. * * *

“The workingmen of Europe felt sure that, as
the American War of Independence initiated a new
era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the
American Anti—Slavery War will do for the working
classes. They consider it an earnest sign of the
epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham
Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working-class,
to lead his country through the matchless struggle
for the rescue of the enchained race and the recon-
struction of a social world.”

-._,..... \

After the assassination of Lincoln the Central»

Council again expressed itself. The document took
the form of a letter to Andrew Johnson, who
succeeded Lincoln. It was dated May 13th. The

author was most {probably Marx. The original

English text has been lost, and the passages given
below have been Englished by Herman Schlueter
from a German translation made at the time. The

matter is taken from Mr. Schlueter’s “Lincoln, Labor »

and Slavery” (New. York: The Socialist Literature
Co.) pp. 194-197: ‘

“We shall not seek for words of mourning and
of horror when the heart of two continents is
throbbing with emotion. Even the sycophants who
year after year and day after day Were busily en-
gaged in‘ morally stabbing Abraham Lincoln and the

great republic of, which he was the head—~even_
they are dismayed in the presence of this universal
outburst of popular feeling and vie with one an»-
other in strewing ﬂowers of rhetoric upon his open
grave. They have at last come to recognize that
he was a man whom_ defeat could not dishearten.
nor success intoxicate, who imperturbably pressed
on toward his great goal without ever imperilling
it by blind haste, who advanced deliberately and
never retraced a step, who was never carried away
by popular favor and never discouraged by the sub-
sidence of popular enthusiasm, who answered acts
of severity with the sunbeams of a loving heart,
who brightened gloomy exhibitions of passion by
the smile of humor, and who accomplished'his titanic:
task as simply and as modestly as rulers by divine;
right are wont to do triﬂing things with great pomp
and circumstance; in a word, he was one of those
rare men who succeed in becoming great without.
ceasing to be good. So great, indeed, was the
modesty of this great and good man that the world"
discovered that he was a hero only when he had:
died as a martyr.” '

In a succeeding address, directed to the American
people by the International Conference, September
25, 1865, the results of the Civil War are summed
up and an appeal is made to “sunder all the chains
of freedom.”

NEW YORK WORLD’S GREATEST PORT.
According to a table compiled in the Bureau of

' Foreign and Domestic Commerce and published in

the Statistical Abstract for 1915, the foreign com-
merce entering and leaving the port of New York
City for the ﬁscal year ended June 30, 1915, ex-
ceeded that of .any other port, according to the
latest available ﬁgures. The comparison with the
eleven other cities nearest New York in value of
foreign trade is as follows: '

LINCOLN ON LABOR UNITY.

From New Haven s eech, March 6, 1860: “I am
glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New
England under which laborers can strike when they
want to. ” * " I like the system which lets a man
«quit when he wants to and wish it might prevail
everywhere.”

From Hartford speech, March 5, 1860 (Press. re-
port): “Mr. Lincoln thanked God that we have a
system of labor where there can be a strike.
Whatever the pressure, there is a point where the
workman may stop.” ‘ ‘

From an address to a New York workingman’s
association (Washin_gton, March 21, 1864): “The
strongest bond of human sympathy outside of the
family relation should be one uniting all working
people of all nations and tongues and kindreds.”

EMPLOYERS ON LINCOLN.

In 1907, 43 years after these utterances were
made, the National Founders’ Association, the
Metal Trades Association and the Board of Directors
of the National Association of Manufacturers passed
a resolution requesting their members to refuse
funds for the erection of a memorial to Lincoln
until the Lincoln Farm Association removed the
"typographical union label from its stationery. This
resolution reads in part (quoted in Harry W. Laid-
ler’s “Boycotts and the Labor Struggle,” pp. 37-38):

“We are ﬁghting to save twenty million free men
from industrial bondage. We " * emphatically
«disapprove the use in connection with this enter-
prise of an insignia which represents and stands
for the overthrow of the fundamental rights which
Lincoln cherished most dearly.”

Needless to say, the union label disappeared from
the association’s letter-head.

EMPLOYERS’ PRIVATE ARMVIES.

Private armed forces organized by certain agencies
for service to the employing class are said by
Robert Hunter,— in “Violence and the Labor Move-
ment,” to number more men than are enlisted in
the regular army of the United States. '

V INTEREST ON FARM LOANS.
Farmers of the nation, according to a report of
the Department of Agriculture, paid in 1913 an aver-.
age interest rate of 7.75 per cent. on their 1Qa.nS.

84 THE APPEAL ALMANAC AND

THE “INDEPENDENT PRESS.”
By JOHN SWINTON.

(Spoken at a’ banquet of newspaper men in New
York City). .

There is no such thing in America as an inde-
pendent press, unless it is in the country towns.

.You know it and I know it. There is not one
of you who dares‘ to write his honest opinion, and
if you did you know beforehand that it would never
appear in print.

I am paid $150.00 a week for keeping my honest
opinions out of the paper I am connected with—
others of you are paid similar salaries for similar
things——and any of you who would be so foolish as
to write his honest opinions would be out on the
streets looking for another job.

The business of the New York journalist is to
destroy the truth, ‘to lie outright, to pervert, to
villify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell
his race and his country for his daily bread.

You know this and I know it, and what folly is
this to be toasting an “independent press.”

We are tools and vassals of rich men behind the
scenes. We are the jumping—jacks; they pull the
strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibili-
ties and our lives are all the property of other
men. We are intellectual prostitutes.
