" «. s. O
_ bans segregation N

PEORIA, Ill.—-(FP-)—The American
Federation -of Teachers (AFL) 36th
annual convention Aug. 18 approved a '
constitutional amendment prohibiting
racial segregation in its 400 locals-
throughout the U. S. ;_

The amendment, introduced by the
Boston local, was passed 219 to 80.
There was only one dissenting voice.
from the floor, that of Emory S. Luns-
ford of the Atlanta local. He said he
knew‘ the ban would eventually I be
adopted, but he had hoped it would not
come so soon.

, The amendment declared no local.
charter defining or recognizing juris— -.
diction on the basis of_ race or color
would be valid “and the practice of any
local in limiting its membership-on ac-
count of race or color, shall render its
charter void.” - -

Earlier, the delegates heard Prof.
George S. Counts of Columbia Univer-
sity declare he hoped the U. ,S. Su-
preme Court in ‘pending cases would
“consign to’ the waste basket of history
the practice of segregation.” He at-
tacl_<_ed Pres. Eisenhower’s nomination
of South Carolina Gov. James F. .
Byrnes, a strong advocate of segre-

gated education,ito a post in the United», V

Nations. “One. can only wonder;‘’‘.

Z is for zinc. It "is also for zero, which is exactly how muchii. the
two “Z” companies - New Jersey Zinc and American Zinc - have of-

fered their employees in negotiations sofar this year. Here are some '

of the important facts about these two big “hold-out” corporations:

New Jersey Zinc

New Jersey Zinc Company seems to

be working hard to keep its record as

one of the most notoriously anti-labor
companies in the_U. S.

 In fact, it is trying to add a new
chapter to that record by making its

.workers at the Empire Zinc mine in

Gilmau, Colorado, go without a wage
increase for the second year in a row.
Workers at Gilmau have not received

any wage increase since 1951, in spite ‘

of the factthat two wage increases
have been granted——one in 1952 and

‘ another in 1953-—at the nearby AS&R

Leadville smelter and at the neighbor-

ing Climax Molybdenum "mine. ’
New’ Jersey Zinc tries to use the _

lead-zinc price situation as an excuse

' for itsrefusal to meet prevailing wage
‘ standards, not pnly in the industry but

even in its own area. It -hopes the
Gilmau workers will forget that the

“' ores which they dig for the company

are rich in silver, gold and copper by-
products, which sell for very high
prices.

Then there is the fact that the pro-

ductivity—-output per man per hour-— _

of the workers in the EZ mine is un-

' usually high as the result of complete

mechanization of the mine.

This company last year reaped a
profit of‘ $2,474 for eachfand every
employee at all its operations. Its"
profits for the first six months of this
year are lower,.main1y ,as a result of
shutdown of its other operations plus,‘

of‘ ‘course, lower zinc prices.

.But the company,‘ still is far from
broke. _During the first half of this
year it paid out dividends to -its stock-

_ holders at the same lush rate as was

paid in the ‘highly profitable years,
1951\and 1952. Dividends so far this

‘ year came to $2,940,000, or at the same

annual rate as the $5,880,000 paid in

V the last two years. . ,

While it keeps making these very big
payments to its stockholders, New
Jersey Zinc is also expanding opera-
i3i0I1Ss Just recently it started develop-

" ing new mines in Arizona and Tennes-
, see.

These are in addition to nearly
$15 million which the company has
sunk so far into the titanium project
in Quebec, Canada, a joint projectwith
Kennecott Copper Company. New
Jersey Zinc owns a-one-third interest
in the company, called the Quebec Iron

I V & Titanium Corp.

So t-he ‘outlook for New Jersey Zinc

‘ and its subsidiary, Empire Zinc, seems
_ rosy indeed. But the company refuses —

to grant its -workers any part of the
wages increases which are now long

- overdue.

American Zinc

American Zinc Company has been

"crying during months of negotiations

with Mine-Mill locals in E. St. Louis,
111., and Metalline Falls, VVash., about

its “small profits.” The crocodile tears .

were supposed to convince the workers
that the company was right in re-
fusing to grant the 1953 countrywide
pattern of 9 cents.

The company spokesmen point to
their profits before taxes, which were
.25 per cent lower than last year's an’-
nual profit. But the profit figures for
1953 tell only a small part of the
story——the part the company wants to
tell. ‘

THE, REASON the profit drop this
year seems big is because there was
such a gigantic increase in profits in
the three earlier years. ‘During the
three years from 1950 through 1952,
American Zinc profits before taxes

were 68 per. cent higher than they

were for the previous 12 years.

This corporation has expanded tre-

mendously ever since 1946. Its not
worth at the end of 1952 was 81 per
cent higher than in 1946.

But even after you know about the
profit drop in the first half of this
year, you find that A—Z enjoyed "a very
healthy return on its investment. For
each dollar of net worth, it showed a.
profit return, before taxes, of 19 cents
-—when many companies would con-
sider themselves lucky to show 0. 10
per cent return. ‘

FOR EVERY employee on its‘pay-
roll last year, American Zinc raked off
a profit of $1,530. A wage increase
of 9 cents an hour right now would
still leave the company coupon-clippers
with a profit of $1,350 for every em-
ployee. ‘

1 What's more, while the company

stubbornly refuses to grant a. wage,

increase to the workers who make its
profits possible, it is being very core-

ful to take good care of its stock-'

holders. In the first half of this year,
American Zinc paid out $335,750 in
dividends, ‘which was at the same an-

nual rate as they paid out dividend! .

last year.

DANVILLE, Ill.—Hegeler Zinc Local
209 has been on strike since July 28
against refusal of Hegeler Zinc Co. to
grant adequate improvements in a con-

held in which the ‘company made no

The union proposed a wage increase,

CHICAGO, Ill‘.-,—After. five weeks on the bricks, workers at 
cision Scientific Company here were still carrying on a completely;

solid and united strike.

Latest company "twist was a 68—page complaint filed in '.Co‘ok.l
County court, which demanded a far-reaching injunction to stop picket-,’

‘ including the Taft’-Hartley‘ act, the Smith act and a 60-year-old,Illin,o'is , ,

spiracy,” a device that was usedvto bust unions as far back as 1835,.,
and which went out the window more than 75 years ago. J -’ -.

Robert Bey, President of Local 758, was scheduled to appear 
court late last week with Int’l rep.»James Durkin’and union attorneys

with a union committee,’ even after. ,l
Mine-Mill won an overwhelming Vic-_ ,
tory in a Board—conducted election.‘ A

 

A WEEK BEFORE the 1ong_t1éiyij”l
complaint was filed, the company had 
forced the ‘ULRB to subpoena two 

International officers of, the Union’ to

attend a Board hearing in Chicago. - 1'

The" two were President John Clark .
and Secretary-Treasurer M.’ E. Travis. ,
Clark and Travis spent two days on
the stand, while company lawyershour
afte1""hour fired questions at them
which the government attorneys re-.
fused to let them answer, on the.
ground that they had nothing to do‘ '

with the unfair labor.-practice charge.’ 
THE COMPANY, which is appealing . '

the NLRB certification of Mine-Mill,

argues that the Workers should be -'—u- 

forbidden to strike until “all appeals
have been exhausted.” ‘Another silly “

company argument is that Mine':Mi1lg 

is not a. union since it engages in
independent political action! ‘ p is
'If the company were allowed ‘to get

away with such nonsense, of course, it  -
-would destroy practically every union

in the country, since alm.ost ‘all take.’
part-in political action as some time
or other.

The hearing at which ciai-k and-V1‘
Travis appeared was attended cby 35. '

Precision strikers. They expressed:
anger that the two International offi-

cers, extremely busy in major ba'rgaif1-  ;

ing activities in‘ the West as well as

 

in conventioin preparations were forced-v L

to waste their time at the hoariog,:. 

. THEY POINTED OUT that the 7f
officers spent two whole days listening‘-‘
to company questions which .they :
couldn’t answer, because the govern- S
rr_1ent attorney refused to let them. ,

As the company continued its series 
of maneuvers, the striking Wo_rkers.- ’

Precision had picked them as guinea; A
pigs in an attempt to test a” whole ..
series of new union-busting techniques. f
They showed their determination net’

“Don't biiy; Cudahyl’? is the slogan
of a‘ big nationwide d ive launched by
the (310 United Packii‘ ‘house Workers.

The campaign is the answer of the
union and its membeis to a months-
longfdrive by the C*u'dal1ay.. Packing
Company to bust thefliinion. ' Cudahy

industry.

‘The company anti-union campaign
was started very slidrtlyi after the
Presidential electionsilast fdll. It has
been marked ‘by speedup, refusal to
settle grievances, and 7-chiseling on con-
ditions which are guaranteed by both
the union contract and long-standing
industry practice.  

Cudahy’s home plant in Omaha,
Nebraska, has been singled out by the
company sti-ategistsffor a specially
vicious ‘union-busting‘ drive, obviously
because one of the strongest locals in
the union is there."-

_ The members of the Omaha local pro-‘
_ tested against the company’s provoca-
tions in the spring, and t_hey were
locked out for two weeks. Then Cuda-
hy lawyers filed a $1,250,000 damage
suit against the pnion on Taft-Hartley
charges. ’ — i

FINALLY, the company suspended
indefinitely the president, vice presi-__
dent and six other officers of Omaha
Local 60. Theeight suspended workers,
all family men,-have, p.7'totaI of 139
years’ service with t‘héidon1pany. They

Packing. officer charged
with misusing union funds

CHICAGO —— (FP) —— The United
Packinghouse Workers (CIO) dis-
closed that Dist. 9 Dir. A. 0. Mc-
Kinney has been accused by two top
union officers of promoting the mis-
handling‘ of local union funds
attempting to persuade local unions
to secede.

The southern director, ,who was
charged t.wo weeks earlier with violat-
ing the union’s basic anti-discrimina-
tion policy.b_v reviving Jimcrow prac-
tices in some locals, will also face trial
under the UPWA constitution on the
two additional charges. They were
filed by Vice Pres. Russell R. Lasley
and Sec.—Treas. G. R. Hathaway on
the basis of new evidence gathered in
the district during the last 10 days.

Lasley and Hathaway charged that

if McKinney had personally urged lead-

ers of five Georgia locals to disaffili-
ate from UPWA and turn over their
funds,_ estimated at $25,000, to un- ‘
authorized persons. McKinney’s .
efforts to weaken the union, they said, ‘
were accelerated after he was charged
with engaging in a “positive conspiracy '
to undermine and sabotage the union’s

1 an‘ti-discrimination program.” ‘

UPWA said [most locals in its 8-.-
state southern district have refused to
go along with the“secession move. The
district,'with headquarters in Atlanta
includes Florida, Virginia, Tennessee,
North/and South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama and Mississippi.

Among the charges. against‘ Mc-
Kinney was that he barred Negro
members from union social affairs in

_ Atlant-a»and prevented Negro officials
"‘ from particiation in union work.

5‘ ‘Wild man of sfeelincIusfry' p
  gets Eisenhower appointment‘

,Many-of the workers -here likened
Randall to Tom -Girdler, the head of
Republic Steel who in 1937 played a
similar role in the events that led to
the bitter"Little Steel strike. For his
efforts, lastyear Randall was named

“Man of the.Year” by the'Natl. Assn.

of Manufacturers.

The 17-member commission which
Randall now heads’ will make basic
on foreign trade
policiesand will have an important

say -‘on questions affecting the entire

U._ S. economy. Into Randall’s hands

‘has been placed the "delicate question
of U. S. trade with the East..

Such trade, involviiigvmachinery and
other commodities which have begun
gluiting"’the domestic market, may de-"
termine the fiiture ‘employment picture
for workers in many industries.

Randall also heads the government’s
Turkish mission and ,he was due to
leave for the Middle East. Aug. 21 in
that capacity. The mission will study,
the-obstacles to, -the flow of private
in un_-.

en general. El resumen de los resul-
tados del debate indico que el pueblo
apoya el derecho de una union hacer
una pelicula mientras a la vez reser-
vando su opinion sobre los méritos‘ de
la pelicula misma hasta tener la
oportunidad de verla en la pantalla.

Ia pelicula todavia no esta lista
para estreno e‘n.la pantalla, pero hace
algunas semanas que la revista Cali-
fornia Quarterly de Los Angeles
publico el manuscrito entero de la
pelicula. Esta edicion del dicha /revista
Vfué distribuida_ ampliameinte entré el
movimiento obrero y entre la prensa
comercial que tanto ataco la pelicula
mientras se estaba filmando. ‘

Hemos recibido un sin "fin de ed.ito-
riales de prensa comentando favor-
ablemente sobre el manuscrito. En" su
edicion del dia 6 de agosto el NUEVO
MEXICANO, publicado en Santa Fe,
Nuevo Mexico, publico un editorial
que, entre otras cosas, dice:

“El manuscrito de cine de la peli-

cula controversial, ‘Sal de la Tierra’. lo /

hace a uno pensar cual fué,el motivo
de toda la tempestad cuando se estaba
filmando en Silver City. Tan caliente
se puso la controversia que un comité
de viigilantes amenazo enviar a'los
responsables por la pelicula fuera del
pueblo en “cajoues pegros.”' Las ale-
gaciones principles consistian en que
algunos de los conextados.con ‘la peli-
culawhabian rehusado contestar pre-
guntas sobre sus opiniones o sus
conexiones con el comunismo, y que la.
pelicula seria propaganda subversi-
va.” .

“Un estudio cuidadoso del manu-
scrito not revela subversion ninguna.
La. historia se basa en una situacion
do huelga en las minas de plomo y

se cuenta del punto de. vista sindical..

La solidaridad sind_ical alfin ytriunfa
sobre los obvios esfuerzos division-
istas de la empresa, cuyo_ fin era

destnuir la union, y asi termina feliz-'

mente la pelicula.” - .<~

“Si la pelicula es igual que el
manuscrito, la cinta parece set no
mos subversiva que las peliculas
‘documentarias’ hechas por las corpo-
‘raciones que tratan-;7de glorificar su
producto o que tratan tie ‘vender’ el
punto de visto economico 0 social de

- la c0rporacion.”

“No obstante ell Senador McCarthy‘
se gnosj

y el, Congresista Jackson,
ocurre que la union tiene todo derecho
, de presentar su punto de vista. Es
mensaje de venta, y los que lo ven

pueden comprarlo 0 no tal como lo‘

hicieran con‘ cualquier otra propa-
ganda. .Re1'o el tratar de suprimirlo
seria absurdo. . . . El -tratar de hacer
esto, 'y los rezongos de los vigilantes,

~ _han exageraclo la importancia, de esta

pel-ieiila -lejos de lo que merece.”

“La posicioni-‘de este pair; no se hace
gnés lfuerte cuando suprime peliculas
que cuanclo quema libros.”

FBI mansurges local President
to secede, form company umon

, S'l‘AM'l<‘()l:l), Conn.—0pen interference in the affairs of a Mine-
Mill local union on behalf of ascompany was attempted last month by

the FBI agent in charge here.

FBI Agent l.<‘i-ank X. McBride approached Edward Coleman, pres-
ident of Local 552, with a proposal that Coleman should use his influ-
. ence to take the local out of Mine-Mill and operate as a local inde-

pendent (company) union.

McBride attempted also to bargain on behalf of the Stamford
Rolling Mills Company. When Coleman mentioned certain issues be-
tween the union and the company, McBride wanted to know. _‘.‘What
is the union willing to give?” in return for its demands.

The Sunday Herald, published at Hartford, Conn., announced on
August 2 that McBride was leaving the FBI to take an executive posi-
tion with the Stamford Rolling Mills Company. It said he had been
an FBI agent for 13 years, and had at one time been an FBI inspector,
“travelling all over the country on inspectiontours of FBI agencies."

Following is an affidavit written and signed by Brother Coleman:

AFFIDAVIT

Stamford, Conn.

August 1, 1953 .

On Monday, July 20th., at about
4:00 p.m. as I was on the way home
from my place of employment at the
Stamford Rolling Mills Co. in Spring‘-
dale, Conn., I was approached by two
men riding in a car just before I
reached my home‘at 146 Franklin St.,
Stamford. Iwas asked if in)-' name was
Coleman, and if I would talk to them.
I invited the two» men into my home,
and the man that was taking the ini-
tiative in talking identzified himself

by.showing me his credentials which '

stated that_ he was Mr. Francis Mc-
Bride, an agent of the F.B.l. Mr. Mc-
Bride asked my permission to ask
some questions. I consented, stating
that I did not mind answering his
questions. I

Mr. McBride proceeded to ask me

' many questions concerning my history

, ,4»...

and activity from the date of my birth
up to the present time, (July -20, 1953).

‘illlllllllil

3

Questions of a personal and intimate
nature were. asked.
‘ I was asked if I was a communist,
or if I had ever been a communist, or
if I had ever been a member of the
communist party. I was also asked
about my union activities. I was asked
if I knew that the International Un-
ion of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers
had been expelled from the C.I.0. on
-the -charge of ‘following the communist
line and being a communist-dominated
union.
Mr. McBride asked me if there were
any communists in our local union at
the Stamford Rolling Mills Co.

He suggested to me that since our
lnternational Union was branded as
being 3 communist-dominated union
that followed the communist line why
not divorce our local union from the
international and carry on independent-
ly on the local level and cooperate with
the management of the Stamford Roll-
ing Mills Co.

Mr. McBride suggested that I should
go to Mr. McCue, the.owner of the

 

 

Stamford Rolling Mills Co., and tell
him that we wanted to cooperate with
him and be fair with him. as he was
sure Mr. McCue would be fair with us.

I disputed the willingness of Mr.
-'McCue to be fair in his dealings with
the.emplo_vees that worked for him.
I cited two things in particular to sup-
port my position of doubt, first, that
the wage scale at the Stamford Rolling
Mills Co. is below that which exists
in other brass and copper rolling mills;
second, that the Stainl'ord Rolling Mills

_Co. is one of the few mills in Coimet~t.i-

Cut that did not give their employees
any wash-up time.

Mr. McBride countered with the
question. “What is the union ‘willing to
give Mr. McCue for wash-up time
privilege?" I cited the fact that the
American Brass Co. in Ansonia (where
I was hired 33 years ago) was giving
10 minutes a day as wash—up time be-
fore 1920 and continues to do so. The
local union at the Stamford Rolling
Mills Co. has been figlitilig for wash-
up time for several years without suc—
cess.

On Thursday, July 30, 1953, the fol-
lowing’ article appeared in the local
edition of the Stamford Advocate.

“[*'-rancis X. M08-ride, u_(/(mt at the
