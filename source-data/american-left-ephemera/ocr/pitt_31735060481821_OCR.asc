Mr. S. R. Stevens,
Willcox, Arizona,

Dear Mr. Stevens:

It would be great encouragement to us who are pushing‘
in an organized manner this religious and ethical forward movement,
if we had the moral support of the readers of the socialized Sunday
School Lessons as they appear in the Christian Socialist each week.

Rince our organization we have been financially self-

supporting and active in allof the lines indicated in Article IV of

our Constitution except (d) upon which we are now hoping to enter.

In order to continue writing the Sunday School
Lessons the past year tremendous inroads have been made upon the
time and energy of our Pastor, and in addition to the Lessons he has
his regular Church and Sunday_School duties, lectures to the public
and to men's clubs, campaign work, preparatory studies and not in-
frequently the burying of dead who are without claims upon him or
our Institution except that they have been socialists. ‘It has for
some time been apparent to our Board that to enable Mr.Prosser to
continue his community and nation-wide work, he must have an able
assistant. we have, therefore, decided to enter upon a nation-wide
campaign for membership. V g

Your interest in the continuance of the Sunday School
Lessons inspires us with the hope that you will deem it a pleasure
to back in so far as-you are able, the revolutionary movement in
process here and evolving outward over the land. The individual who
has had the soul vision of human emancipation from religious, politi-
cal and economic tyranny can read in our declaration of principles
and object,the first,real, full-rounded organized effort toward the
realization of that vision. Surely it will appeal to you. Our
Institution standsout the one truly religious socialist institution;
it is known locally as "The Socialist Church,"and has gone far to-
ward silencing theopposition to Socialism because of its (socialism's)
reputation of being atheistic. We want our Pastor to continue his
broadening wcrk,but not.at the expense of the influence of our local
Institutional work. This membership campaign is an effort toward
maintaining and increasing both. Will you join us? A membership»
application blank, last pageof enclosed, can be torn out,filled up
and mailed to us. Act ngg; ~

with best wishes for the complete harvest of your
own labors, we are, '

' Fraternally,
