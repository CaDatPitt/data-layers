HANDS-OFF

GUATEMALA!

‘On June 18th, the Republic of Guatemala was invaded from the
sea and air by 6,000 Well-arrmed men from Honduras. The invading
army was composed of Hondurans, Nicaraguans, Guatemalans, and
other Latin-Americans, Who Were armed in Nicaragua With the full
approval of Dictator Gen. Somoza.

The invaders, under the command of a C01. Armas, claimed that
they were out to “liberate” Guatemala from “Communist domination.”

The duly elected government of Guatemala declared that the
attack was instigated by foreign interests in order to maintain their
economic control.

Who is right? What are the facts behind the “Battle ‘of Guate-
mala?

UNITED NATIONS CALL FOR CEASE FIRE

On June 20th, two days after Guatemala Was invaded, the United
Nations Security Council adopted a resolution calling for ‘-‘the imme-
diate termination of any action likely to cause bloodshed in Guate-
mala.” It called on all UN members to “abstain in the spirit of the
charter, from giving any assistance to any such action.”

The Guatemalan government has already called for such a cease
fire and the Withdrawal of the invading army to the borders. The
invaders have refused to heed the UN resolution.

The Republican administration in Washington has given silent
approval to the “aggression” being committed against Guatemala.
Republican Party leader in the House, Rep. Leslie ‘C. Arends declared,
“I hope the anti-Communists chase all of the Communists out of
Guatemala.”

Why is it that President Eisenhower and Secretary of State
Dulles and other Republican leaders have not acted while stating its
strong opposition to the policy of “aggression”?

ECONOMIC DOMINATION ‘OF GUATEMALA

Guatemala is a small Central American Republic the size of the
State of Ohio, with a population of 3,000,000. It is mainly agrarian
with rich natural resources.

For 50 years, this tiny Republic has been under tight economic

THESE ARE THE FAC

control of powerful U. S. interests headed by the United Fruit Co.
The attempt to dominate and control the economy of Latin American
countries has been a pattern of U. S. financial interests—bananas in
Guatemala, oil in Mexico and Venezuela, tin and copper in Chile and
Bolivia, etc.-

Huge profits have been made by these companies . . . all at the
expense of Latin American workers, and destruction of natural ne-
sources of each country.

THE ROLE OF THE UNITED FRUIT G0.

The United Fruit Co. acquired vast amounts of land in Guatemala
in exchange for building a railroad and developing a port on the
Atlantic Coast (which they still own and control).

In the last 50 years they have made billions from their holdings,
all while paying Guatemalan labor as littl-e as 50c per day. Today
their financial interests are estimated to be around $50,000,000!

DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS FORMED

Bitter at the economic oppression, and disgusted with the col-
laborating role being played by their own government, the people
of Guatemala overthrew the government of Dictator Jorge Ubico in
1944.

The following year, a constitutent assembly adopted Guatemala’s
first democratic constitution which guaranteed civil and political
rights, and the right of Labor to organize . . . a right that was illegal
under the Ubico regime.

For 10 years the people of Guatemala worked toward full demo-
cracy and economic independence. Free elections in 1952 elected the
present administration (President A-rbenz) by a vote of 85% of
the people.

EXPROPRIATION OF LAND

In 1950 census figures showed that while bulk of people in
Guatemala were without land of their own, over 80% of the land
was owned by 5% of the landowners including the United Fruit Co.
Much of this land wa.s unused.

In 1952 the Guatemalan Congress passed a land reform law
calling for expropriation of this unused land to be paid for in 25
years by government bonds, at 3% interest.

400,000 acres of unused land owned by the United Fruit Co. was
expropriated under this law and distributed to peasants and small
farmers. Unused land owned by government officials lik-e President
Arbenz and Foreign Minister Toriello was also expropriated.

As a result of this land reform program, the income of peasants
increased. President Arbenz reported that “some peasants had net

\CTS...

incomes of more than $1,000 during the first year of the agrarian
reform” whereas the per capita income in 1952 had been $186.00!

The United Fruit Co. openly opposed this program. See. Dulles
protested the expropriation of UFC land and arrogantly demanded
that the Guatemalan government immediately pay the sum of $15
million dollars. The demand was rejected by Guatemala.

PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM

In addition to land reform, the Government announced plans for
a public Works program. The completion of these projects would have
meant that Guatemala would no longer have to depend on the rail-
Way, hydroelectric plants and sea port at Puerto Barrios which are
all under the tight control of the United Fruit Co. and other U. S.
int-erests. It would have meant further economic independence for
the people of Guatemala.

THE CRIME AGAINST GUATEMALA

Seeing their economic interests threaten-ed, the directors of
United Fruit Co. and other U. .S. firms began fomenting strife in
Guatemala to prevent the land reform and building projects from
being completed. They were overwhelmingly rejected by the Guate-
malan people.

Next, they attempted to organize an army in Nicaragua to invade
and “liberate” Guatemala. Money was given to rebel leaders by the
UFC to buy arms.

~ For example, a premature “uprising” took place on March 29th,
1953, which was quickly defeated by Government forces. Two leaders
of the “uprising” admitted that they Were on the payroll of the
United Fruit Co. and som-e admitted that they had «received $64,000
from the company to buy arms.

It has also been established that a retired U. S. Army officer,
Col. Carl Studer placed himself at the disposal of the United Fruit
Co. and has been acting as a military adviser to the rebel army, now
invading Guatemala.

Along with the open preparation for a War on Guatemala, began
an extensive propaganda campaign. The Government of Guatemala
was labelled as “Communist-dominated” and this tiny republic was
called the “beachhead of international Communism in the Western
Hemisphere.”

Shipments of arms to Guatemala——weapons to defend herself
against inpending attacks—t0uched off hysteria by the U. S. officials
that Guatemala constituted a. threat to the security of our country
and the Panama Canal.

The notion that a country with 3,000,000 people, an army of

 7,000 men, without an arm-alment industry -or an air force is a threat

to the United States, is ridiculous.

How then can Guatemala be considered to be a threat to the

Panama Can5al—-«an installation over 800 miles away?
HAND OFF -GUATEMALA

While. many of the details -of the events of Guatemala remain
obscurie, enoughtis known to establish the following facts:

1.‘ Guatemala has been invaded. The invasion has as its an-
nounced objective the overthrow of the democratically elected Guate-
mala government. This unpnovoked aggression against a peaceful

nation has been organized -and launched at least with the blessing
and encoura.gement of ‘officials of the Eisenhower Administration.

.2. This armed intervention against a sovereign nation is a vi-ola-
tion of the UN Charter and the democratic rights of the Guatemalan
people. The American people want no repetition of the “Big Stick”
policy in Latin America which earned our government the reputation
of “Yankee imperialists”. This policy was repudiated under Franklin
D. Roosevelt and replaced with the policy -of the Good Neighbor.

  WHAT CAN BE DONE
Dem-and that President Eisenhower adopt and “enforce a policy
of HANDS OFF GUATEMALA; and that he:

(a) Demand that Honduras liquidate the insurgent military
base ‘on its territory.

(b) Withdraw all restrictions which are preventing the Guate-
mala ' Government from securing the arms necessary to defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

"(c,) Cease giving moral or material aid to the aggression.
. (d) Support and help carry «out the UN Security Council resolu-
tion adopted Sunday, June 20th which calls for a cease fire.
