THE DEVASTATING JAPANESE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR ON DECEMBER 7, 1941,
horrified the people of the Hawaiian Islands.

David Hyun was then working with an engineering firm specializingin
air conditioning and refrigeration, gaining experience and skill that
proved to be helpful during his years of war service. The coming of
war postponed for a while his marriage to Mary, a U. S. citizen bornin
Hawaii of Korean parents.

Within hours after the attack, David, Mary and their entire fami-
lies volunteered for emergency relief service and worked unstintingly
to help overcome the chaos of that sudden blow.

Early in 1942, Lavid sought active service in the armed forces, but
aas rejected as "an ENEMY alien" because Korea, land of his birth, was
under the heel of Japanese imperialists and militarists.

However, he persisted in offering his services in any capacity. and
because of his honorable record in the ROTC he was finally accepted in
the Hawaii Defense Volunteers. He helped to man the “secondary” defense
line about 300 yards off Waikiki Beach, where Japanese invasion forces
were expected to land. ‘

The Volunteers were later assigned to guarding vital installations,
to relieve pressure on the inadequate regular army forces.

The entire Hyun family were volunteers during the war period. An
American-born brother served with the U. S. Army, and later was assigned
to the American Military Government (AMG) in occupied Korea. A sister,
also a citizen, served in the civilian section of AMG in Korea. The
Rev. Hyun, although retired, nevertheless voluntarily served U. S. auth-
orities, working with Koreans who had been taken prisoner while serv-
ing as conscript labor with the Japanese armed forces.

David, in addition to Volunteer work, aided the Block Wardens in
enforcing blackout and curfew regulations. His daytime work included

aid in planning for important wartime installations. He was highly
commended for his work.

junior civil engineer. then as associate mechanical engineer.

Despite the fact that “aliens”-were classified for limited security
operations, David, because of his reputation and qualifications, was
given special permission to work on military installations of a varied
and strategic character. He helped to solve technical problems made
acute by material shortages in Hawaii.

Again he received high commendation for his work, from the command-
ing officer of the U. S. Engineers.

when a controversy arose over the 25 percent less wages paid to
“Island” technicians, as against technicians from the U. S. mainland,
it was evident that discrimination was its root cause.

David's interest in the welfare of Hawaiian workers, the men, women
and children of many racial origins whose wage rates were abysmally low
and who were victims of intense racial discrimination, dated back to the
days of his childhood and youth, when he toured the islands doing church
welfare work with his father. It had been deepened by his own experi-
ence as plantation and cannery worker. working his way through college.

 

WINNER OF THE ISLANDS-WIDE OEATORICAI. CONTEST ON
”THE MEANING OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION”

 

The principles which he felt deeply enough to win an oratorical
contest on the “Meaning of the U.S. Constitution", were merged with his
deep-seated devotion to the ethical precepts of Christianity.

He uus convinced of his essential American citizenship, despite
denial to him of the formal right to vote or hold political office. He
uas an American, husband of a native-born wife and father of a young
American-born son: his was the right to petition for the redress of
grievances.

He was elected to a committee to draw up and present the petition,
requesting that the U.S. Engineers pay equally for equal work, regard-
less of color or place of birth. The commanding officer of the Pacific
Ocean Areas Engineering Corps complimented the committee on the peti-
tion, and presently the request was granted by order from Washington,Dx1

UPON CONCLUSION OF HIS WAR SERVICE WITH THE U.S. ENGINEERS, DAVID HYUN
worked for a noted architect-engineer in Honolulu, installing air-con-
ditioning systems in major business buildings and supervising structural
engineering work on stores and warehouses.

H, He was now a member of a professional federation of architects,
E chemists, engineers and technicians, and during 1946 he was elected its
h secretary. When the federation was amalgamated with the Office and Pro-
h fessional Workers of America, he was elected president, and was subse-
ﬁg quently appointed to the CIO Council Executive Board.

V

l

He took part in a campaign to organize Hawaiian sugar workers, and
as a CIO Council member was active in aid of their 1946 strike, resist-
ing efforts by the “Big Five" (as the major owners of plantations,
canneries and shipping were known) to crush the strike.

During the 1946 elections he worked with the CIO Political Action
Committee, when for the first time in Hawaiian history the voters
elected a legislature not controlled by the big sugar interests.

 

Without a doubt David Hyun incurred_the hostility of employers be-
cause of the year or so of intense activity on behalf of labor. Pro-
labor activities were being termed ”communistic” and."subversive" by
the commercial press.

About this time a second son was born. He was given.the name “Free-
land” by his parents, to express their devotion to American democratic
principles.

In 1947 David and his wife and two sons left Hawaii and settled in
Los Angeles to study further for his career as engineer-architect.

Throughout 1948-1949 he attended courses in Architectural Design
at the University of Southern California, while employed as draftsman
by various architects of national and international renown.

He was steadily gaining knowledge and experience when a terrible
blow fell, bringing acute disturbance into his peaceful and happy fam-
ily life.

‘A In August, 1949, immigration officials came to his place of work
and arrested him on deportation charges, as an "undesirable alien."

X. 10

 

'.. '\\

THE WARRANT FOR DAVID HYUN'S ARREST DID NOT CITE ANY “OVERT ACTS".
It charged that “at some time since entry into the United States” he
had belonged to an “organization, association, society or group” which
believed in “overthrow of the United States government by force and
violence,” and was subject to deportation.

Thus began the long ordeal for the Hyun family: constant har-
assment, disruttion of the children's schooling through deep and sus-
tained emotional distress; the ceaseless drain on time and resources
to fight each stage of the case, including various re—arrests, long
periods of detention, condemnation without "due process of law", and
finally to save his family from destruction and save Lbvid Hyun from
death by execution or torture in South Korea.

Fortunately, ever since his initial arrest, David Hyun has had the
deep respect and unstinted aid of his colleagues, friends and neighbors.
who have staunchly defended him over the years in the traditional Ameri-
can spirit of fairness.

From the beginning he has fought to ignore the nagging uncertainty
of his future and carry on normal living. In 1949, when he was released
on bail and was invited back to his job by his employer. he resumed his
studies at U.S.C. In late 1949 he passed State Exams for Architects
with such brilliance that he was asked to write an essay on them for
the California Chapter of the Architects Institute of America.

This respite from disruption of his life was short-lived.

In 1950, when hostilities broke out in Korea and the United States
became involved in the United Nations’ “Police-action,” Congress began
hasty enactment of oppressive “thought-control” and “anti-alien” laws.
giving “tyrannical power" to government officials, and legislating
guilt against political dissenters.

Thus the “Mccarran” Internal Security Act of 1950, and later the
“Walter-Mccarran” Immigration 8 Nationality Law of 1952, were passed
over the President's VEYU, despite his description of them as “worse
than the infamous Alien and Sedition Laws” of 1798 which Jefferson
annulled as “destructive of our Constitution."

11

l

HE WAS AGAIN ARRESTED, DENIED BAIL AND “DETAINED” FOR SIX MONTHS WHEN
the ”McCbrran” Act became law at midnight on October 22, 1950. In the
midnight hours of Sunday, October 23, immigration agents knocked on
doors of dozens of deportation victimsthroughout the country, making
arrests without warrants on order of the Attorney General, as a test of
his “discretionary power to deny bail" under the new law.

These arrests were accompanied by sensational publicity; the Attor-
new General in an interview intimated that the “midnight raids" had
saved the country from a terrible “menace to internal security."

David Hyun and other Los Angeles victims were “processed” into the
County Jail. fingerprinted, harassed by jailors, and dumped into over-
crowded cells at dawn on Sunday morning.

Next day they were handcuffed together like “dangerous felons" and
transported to the immigration stockade on Terminal Island; and there
they stayed for more than six months while their petitions for habeas
corpus relief were fought through the federal courts.

In federal court proceedings government attorneys offered no
"evidence" to justify refusal of bail. They merely asserted that they
had information from “sources that cannot be disclosed" justifying deni-
al of bail to David Hyun and others as “dangerous to national security."

When lower courts sustained the Attorney General, the case was tak-
en to the U.S. Supreme Court. which, presumably disagreeing that the
detainees were “too dangerous to be left at large,” ordered them freed
on interim bail.

Six months had elapsed during the court fight. They were grim
months for David Hyun and his family.

While he was imprisoned, his deportation hearing was held. The
witnesses against him were in Hawaii. and immigration officials took
depositions from two of them, alleging that David Hyun had been seen at
“closed Communist Party meetings." He was denied the right to con-
front them or the means to have counsel cross-examine them.

Thus under the new law the “fact” required to justify an order of
deportation was “established.” Such an order was presently issued.

12

 

 

 

FOUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES DISSENTED FROM THE MAJORITY OPINION
which in June. 1952. upheld the Attorney General’s “discretionary power"
to deny bail, though “cautioning" him against its “arbitrary use."

David Hyun's temporary court bail was cancelled, but after a night
in jail he was admitted to immigration service bail.

He was in the meanwhile appealing to the Board of Immigration Ap-
peals to cancel the deportation order on grounds that “unfair hearings"
had been conducted by officials of the Department of Justice acting as
“prosecutor and judges" and denial of “due process of law". The appeal
was denied.

(The President's Commission on Immigration, after lengthy public
hearings critical of the “Walter-Mccarran” Law. concluded that the
conduct of deportation and exclusion hearings and atpeals should be tak-
en out of “control” by the “Department of Justice and the Immigration
Service.”) ’

The case was taken to federal court for “judicial review of the evi-
dence" but this was refused. and in June. 1953. David Hyun was ordered
to surrender for transportation to South Korea. V

He was jailed on July 6. 1953. but a court “order of restraint” was
quickly obtained to prevent him being rushed aboard a ship or plane by
officials. (He was granted bail 5 months later. pending appeal.)

David Hyun's family, friends and colleagues were horrified by the
sudden danger to his life, for they were convinced that both as a de-
tortee labelled "Communist" and because of the many years of bitter en-
mity between Syngman Rhee and David's father, Rev. Hyun, David's deliv-
ery into Rhee’s hands in South Korea virtually assured his death by
execution or torture.

Aware that the delay was only temporary, they undertook extensive
research into books and magazines and newspapers, to collate document-
ary proof of the “danger of physical persecution.” which under the law
permits the Attorney General to use his “discretion” to suspend an order
of deportation.

Counsel invoked this clause, and, aided by public delegations to
immigration officials. obtained official consent to a “special hearing”
for the presentation of evidence.

13

   

THE DANGER OF "PHYSICAL PERSECUTION” WAS PROVEN BY OVER 100 EXHIBITS
of impartial testimony, excerpts of public reports, and affidavits cit-
ing how syngman Rhee and his supporters used “cruelty and violence” to-
wards political opponents in South Korea.

Such noted journalists as Walter Sullivan of the New York Times,
Frederick Kuh of the Chicago Sun-Times. Reginald Thompson of the London
Daily Telegraph. Frank Gibney, associate editor of TIME magazine, and
many others in impartial statements of fact warned of "immediate im-
prisonment” "persecution of the direst nature" and "mortal danger” for
[avid Hyun if he were sent to South Korea labelled "Communist."

Others who warned of “serious jeopardy" "possible execution" and
"brutality and acts of barbarism” were: Ds. J.B.Th. Hugenholtz of the
Dutch Reformed Church of Holland, Roger Baldwin of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Stewart Meachum. former labor advisor to the U.S.Armed
Forces in Korea. Stanley W. Earl, Commissioner of Public Affairs in
Portland, Oregon, and William S. Townsend. international president
United Transport Service Workers.

A Korean minister in Hawaii. warning that David Hyun would be
killed by Rhee’s supporters if sent to Hawaii, recalled how Rhee sav-
agely attacked Rev. Hyun in 1919. when the latter, as Minister of the
Interior in the Korean Republic government-in-exile, was chosen as
Envoy Extraordinary to visit Allied capitals; and how in later years
Rhee's “gangsters” in Hawaii “kidnapped Rev. Soon Hyun and terrorized
him" in an attempt to drive him out of the Korean Independence movement.

Affidavits and statements pointed out how in post-war South Korea
“Rhee's terrorist youth organization" assassinated liberal political

leaders opposed to Rhee's policies; among these were several of Rev. .

Hyun's lifelong friends. one being Lyuh Woon Hyung. well known to visit-
ing journalists. ‘

THOUSANDS OF PROTESTS against deportation of David Hyun to South
Korea were sent to local immigration officials and to U.S. Commissioner
of Immigration and the U.S. Attorney General, in response to Rev. Hyun’
moving appeal “to help save my son's life.”

Elmer Brown of the American Friends Service Commission wrote:

"It is my thoughtful opinion that...anyone under the slightest
suspicion of being a Communist...upuld in all probability suffer torture
and the supreme penalty of death there.”

Methodist and Presbyterian “social studies” and “social action”
committees were joined by hundreds of professional men and women who by
resolution, letter and telegram urged suspension of “this cruel deporta-
tion order" so that “we may be spared the pitiful consequences of sep-
arating him from his wife and children.”

Bishop James Chamberlain Baker of the Methodist Church wrote: "I
have knoun the Hyuns for 25 years. The father uas one of my ministers.
I am...tahing part in the effort to save David Hyun. I do not believe
he is a dangerous person.”

""*"°E~=’ 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED THE “DEATH BY EXILE" ORDER
because of the many letters and telegrams of protest and the weighty
evidence that “physical persecution" awaited David Hyun in South Korea.

However, the suspension is only "...for such a period of time as is
necessary.” The Attorney General, then, has left the way open —- if
David Hyun does not find ways to deport himself -— to "change his mind"
and enforce the order of deportation to South Korea.

The alternative, according to the notice of "suspension', is SELF-
EXILE. But as the late Justice Jackson wrote in “self-deportation”
dissenting opinion, “world conditions mock our deportation policy.’
Why should any country accept persons who are deemed so “dangerous”
that “this stable and powerful United States” dare not let them stay
here, subject like all-citizens to the regular legal code. He concluded:

‘...once they gain admission here, they are our problem and one that
cannot be shipped to some other part of the world.”

other facts makesnonsense out of the “self-deportation” dictum. The
few countries which accept “permanent residents” require huge amounts of
money to be deposited as guarantee against “pauperism" during the many
years they are not allowed to work for a living. Such sums are far be-
yond the resources of most deportees.

There is no guarantee that a country which may, as a favor to the
U.S., accept deportees Labelled "Communist or subversive", would not
persecute thenu

In various dissenting opinions. Justices Black and Douglas have
given the sole answer to this “inhumanity of deportation" - i.e. “the
non-citizen's right to stay here must be protected.”

The PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION, summing up the statements of hundreds
of nation-wide organizations asking repeal or drastic revision of the
present code, declares that we have “...a moral, if not a legal, obliga-
tion to treat such people fairly.” especially when “such long-resident
non-citizens are working, paying taxes. are married and raising American
families, and are integrated in economic and community life."

David Hyun has lived such "an integrated community life" among us
for 31 of his 38 years. He knous no other Language or way of life than
ours. He must not be crucified with EXILE, nor torn from his American-
born wife and sons."

A PETITION TO CERTIFY REVIEW OF TH EVIDENCE IN THE DAVID HYUN CASE
will come before the U.S. Supreme Court in October. It cites many
legal opinions describing deportation of a non-citizen “with deep roots
in this land" as “the equivalent of banishment or exile,” which may re-
sult in loss “of all that makes life worth living" and may. “in the
present upheavals in lands to which aliens may be returned" present
jeopardy to life itself;

Since the deportation order was arrived at without the fair pro-
ceedings which such “terrible penalties and punishment as EXILE” make
necessary. the petition asks review of the “trial in absentia" and
cancellation of the deportation order. to save David Hyun from “for-
feiting family, liberty and homeland.”

However. the history of this long-fought case, with its many rami-
fications and sudden sensational developments, convinces friends and
neighbors, and all persons sympathetic to David Hyun in his tragic
plight. that public action must not stop pending legal considerations.

It is quite possible that within hours of a legal decision being
announced, David Hyun will again be subject to arrest and hasty at-
tempts to transport him into EXILE — even to his death in South Korea
if the Attorney General during the lull "changes his mind” and decides
that the danger of "physical persecution" in South Korea hascﬁamweared.

Such a tragic outcome can be prevented only if a strong, concerted,
widespread plea is made by thousands of Americans asking the Attorney
General to use his discretionary powers to cancel the deportation order
against David Hyun, on humanitarian grounds, as befits this democratic
nation.

MARY HYUN, wife of David and mother of their two American sons who
are threatened with “legal” loss of their father for life, makes her
plea for such action on your part. She says:

"I hope that you, having read my husband's story, agree that to
forcibly separate him from me and his two sons by exiling him forever,
shattering our family and endangering his very life, is indeed a most
’cruel and unusual punishment’ unuorthy of our great nation.

A ”Itis extremely unlikely that it will be possible for us to leave

right as Americans under terrible coercion; and with David we would
wander'forever alien in an alien land.

"So long as a deportation order exists against him, our lives udll
be a turmoil of uncertainty and torment. I ask you to appeal to the

FEDERAL JUDGE LEARNED HAND
ruling some years ago
in a deportation case, said:

“We think it not improper to say that
deportation under the circumstances
(legal residence in the U. 8. since

childhood) would be deplorable.

"Whether the relator came here in arms

or at the age of ten he is as much our product
as though his mother had borne him

"He knows no other language,
no other habits than ours.

"He will be as much a stranger

EXILE

 

JUDGE HAND’S COMMENTS MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT DAVID HYUN,
Los Angeles architect who has lived in United States territory since he
was a child, and the tragic plight that confronts him and his wife and
two young sons, American citizens by birth.

David Hyun faces exile from the United States, not for “heinous
crime”, not indeed for any crime, but because of the accident of his
birth abroad, and his proud adherence to the U. S. Constitution and the

immutable guarantees” contained in the Bill of Rights; concepts of
freedom of worship, speech and press. and equality before the law, ab-
sorbed from childhood to manhood in American grade and high schools and
university.

Because EXILE threatens Lhvid Hyun, his uﬁje and sons must make a
terrible choice: either to remain here udth other relatives and friends
of-a lifetime, and forever lose husband and father, or to renounce their
American birthright and accompany David into exile in any foreign land
that will accept him.

The word “exile” conveys a sense of barbarous cruelty, as Judge Hand
notes. True, in medieval days, when men fought for hunan rights against
despotic kings and princes. exile, or “transportation for life” to bar-
ren islands or colonies, was preferable to being “hung, drawn and quar-
tered” or tortured in dungeons. often for “crimes” which today enlight-
ened men call misdemeanors. Fortunate were the “felons” who found
sanctuary in a church or its domains, thereby escaping death by taking
the “oath of perpetual banishment.”

Virginia. in colonial days, was largely populated by English “cri-
minals” who preferred “transportation” and long periods of indentured

labor. rather than hang for the theft of a loaf of bread. the “cutting ’

of a purse”, or poaching of a pheasant from some lord's game preserves.

Even much later, when men of enlightenment were fighting for the
rights of man, and being forced to migrate to the colonies to escape
political oppression, the legal code with-regard to exile was harsh,
for even those who dared “correspond with transported felons” were de-
clared to be “felons, without benefit of clergy” and therefore them-
selves subject to banishment.

SUCH HARSH PUNISHMENTS IMELLED AN 18TH CENTURY CHRONICLER TO WRITE
(in “The History of New Holland” - i.e. Botany Bay):

‘‘shall then the lawgiver infringe all the ties and privileges of
humanity? Shall he point the sword of justice against the bosom of
fidelity? To such a lawgiver I would say, ‘Consult your heart, and in-
flict not chastisement on actions which a good mind cannot «disapprove’ﬂ

An English novelist. Francis Brett Young. after careful research
into the recorded cruelties of banishment in the early 19th century,
describes a scene in which a young former soldier. accidently in the
company of poachers when they are arrested, speaks out boldly against
poverty that causes crime, and denounces the cruelty and injustice of
the law. The judge terms him “dangerous" and “an agitator" and there-
fore “gui1ty”, and vindictively sentences him. saying:

"Ybu will leave the country; you unll see_your relations no more...
The land you have disgraced will see you no more; the friends with whom
you are connected will be parted from you forever in this world."

Such historical figures as Roger Williams, Voltaire, Heine, Gari-
baldi, Hugo, Bolivar, Zola, were victims of exile or banishment for
their ideas.

Stefan Zweig, grief-stricken because of exile from his homeland,
when Hitler revived medieval execution and torture in-Germany, expressed
the essence of exile when just before his suicide he lamented. “...we
can choose many things in this life, but not where we were born."

England abolished “transportation” or “exile” in 1857. Many other
lands ban deportation after three years residence, or ban it completely
when'residents marry citizens and desire to settle for life.

The people of the United States, proud bf their history as a refuge
for dissenters and victims of political oppression, must now face the
fact that Congress has given power to the Attorney General to“banish"
for life political dissenters whose “accident of birth" makes them
deportable.”

JAMES MADISON, ODDOsing deportation of
Irish and French political refugees

in 1798. said:

”...if a banishment of this sort be

not a tunishment, and among the severest
punishment, it will be difficult to imagine
a doom to which the name can be applied.”

SINCE OUR WAR OF INDEPENDENCE OUR MOST ETHICAL AND SCHOLARLY LEADERS
have striven to uproot and abolish all remnants of medievalism; witch-
burnings and torture. star-chamber proceedings, inquisitions, and exeé
cutions, jailings, banishment and exile for political dissent.

Historically, this enlightened struggle reached a climax in the
discussions by our “founding fathers” as to the essential rights of man,
resulting in adoption of the ten Bill of Rights amendments to the Con-
stitution. the “exact and inviolable guarantees” of freedom of religion,
speech and press, due process of law, and the right to bail and protec-
tion against “cruel and unusual punishment" as stated in the 8th Amend-
ment.

Reversion to medieval darkness took place when, amid anti-French
anti-Jacobin hysteria following the French revolution, the Alien and
Sedition Laws were passed by Congress in 1798. Jefferson said of these
laws that they were unconstitutional and calculated to “forge chains
for the people”; and the Irish and French political refugees against
whom the “banishment” provisions were aimed. he termed, “First victims
of an experiment on the American mind to see how far it will hear an
avowed violation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.” (Jeffer-
son and Hamilton, Claude G. Bowers; H.M. & Co.)

Hamilton also warned his friends against passage of these laws, as
being likely to “establish a tyranny! Others of our “founding fathers”
fought against the “revival of the evils of exile" and cited lawgivers

from Blackstone on as defining exile or banishment as “punishment of—

the severest sort....inflicted principally on political offenders."

The Alien and Sedition Laws were annulled by Jefferson after his
election to the presidency in 1800. Jefferson's remarks about these
laws were referred to by Supreme Court Justice Brewer in 1893, in a
famous dissenting opinion. when he stated that the "framers of our Con-
stitution familiar with history,... wisely gave to this governmentno
inherent tower to banish."

Justice Brewer was Joined in his dissent against the arbitrary power
to deport, by two other justices, all agreeing that deportation is in-
deed “punishment of the severest sort.”

  
 

 

OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY IS “A STRANGE INTERMINGLING OF PREJUDICE AND
logic. of science and pseudo-science. of extravagant hopes and extra-
vagant fears,” says Edward Corsi, former Commissioner of Immigration,
in the Freedom pamphlet "Paths to a New world."

Racial barriers to citizenship have long existed. Negroes des-
cended from slaves forcibly imported centuries ago were not recognized
as citizens until long after Emancipation. American Indians and Eskimos
did not win citizenship status until 1940. Only in very recent years
have Asian peoples (in strictly limited numbers) been granted immigra-
tion as well as citizenship rights.

During early expansion of trade and industry a century ago, U. S.
agents were sent abroad to contract for immigrant labor. In less than
100 years some 50 million immigrants came here to build our cities, fac-
tories. railroads. harbors. and to expand our entire economy into the
richest in the world.

They brought to us cultural lustre and richness, science, invention,
music. art, ethical and folk wisdom; both as anonymous millions in na-
tionality groups and communities, and as brilliant outstanding indivi-
duals like Einstein. Fermi, Carnegie, Knudson, Toscanini, Victor Herben;
Pulitzer and thousands more.

Yet they suffered intense discrimination, were hounded into ghet-
toes, by such “hate” groups as the mid-century “Know Nothings” - spirit-
ual forbears of Ku Klux Klanners and today's bigots.

Still, not a single one of the millions of immigrants was deported
because of beliefs. between Jefferson's annullment of the Alien and Se-
dition Laws in 1800. and the 1880's.

Since then.every crisis has brought enactment of ever-more discrim-
inatory laas against the foreign—born. About oo years ago lawmakers
and high court justices established a "precedent" to the effect that
"deportation is NUI‘punishment," and ever since have used this illogical
"precedent" to justify political deportations.

Now a decade of “cold war" has brought passage of the (Wa1ter-McCar-
ran) Immigration 6 Nationality Law of 1952: the most widely condemned
law in U. S; history because of its racist barriers to immigration, its
harsh punitive measures and abolition of statutes of limitations, re-
duction of all foreign-born to 2nd-class status, and dozens of oppres-
sive deportation provisions. Its repeal or drastic revision is demand-
ed by hundreds of religious bodies, labor organizations, civic groups.

In 1940 David Hyun, after graduating with honors from American
schools and colleges, applied for naturalization. He was bluntly in-
formed that under terms of the Oriental Exclusion Act he was denied
citizenship because he was born in Asia.

Now, under the new code of immigration law, he is threatened with
deportation, uhich is aptly described by Judge Hand as "...EXILE, a

dreadful punishment abandoned by the common consent of civilized
people.”

—PRESIDENT’S COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION

”...to aliens who have lived in the United
States for many years, uho have become
integrated into its community life, and
uhose ties with their mother country may
become remote and purely technical, a
deportation order becomes the most severe
and cruel benalty imaginable.”

 

DAVID HYUN WAS TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE LEFT KOREA. HE WAS BORN IN SEOUL
in 1917. In later life he was to be gravely affected - in fact his life
was, and still is, endangered - because his father was Rev. Soon Hyun, a
pioneer Korean Methodist Episcopal minister ordained in Hawaii in 1905.
and also a leader of the Korean Independence Movement.

Korea was then under Japanese rule. In 1919. inspired by the Allied
victory and the enunciation of principles of freedom for all peoples as
part of the desired peace settlement, the Korean people developed huge
mass demonstrations for their independence.

A Korean “Declaration of Independence" was drafted. patterned on
American democratic principles, and the Rev. Hyun was chosen by 33 K0-
rean leaders to secretly go abroad and solicit the sympathetic aid of
the great Powers for Korean independence. He visited the capitals of
several victorious allies, but his pleas were ignored.

In the meanwhile David's mother, wife of Rev. Hyun. was tortured in
Seoul by the Japanese, in a vain attempt to make her reveal the where-
abouts of her husband. Presently, through bribing Japanese officials,
she was able to flee Korea with her eight children and take refuge in
Shanghai, where she joined her husband, at that time an official of the
Korean “Government in Exile” under Syngman Rhee’s presidency.

(Sharp differences of opinion arose between groups of Koreans as to
the conduct and objectives of the independence movement, and Rev. Hyun
found himself in opposition to Syngman Rhee. These differences were to
continue and to deepen over the years, until the liberation following
World War Two.)

By 1924, allied indifference to the bid of the Korean people for
freedom from the Japanese resulted in savage suppression of the move-
ment. The Rev. Hyun sought and was granted asylum for his family in
Hawaii, and he became pastor of a Methodist Episcopal church.

David Hyun uas only seven years old uhen he first arrived on 02 S.
Territory, where he uas to live continuously from then on, having less
and less identity with the country of his birth as the years passed,
knowing no Korean fellow—countrymen other than Americanized emigres,
and becoming thoroughly English—speaking and American in habit and
thought and association.

DAVID HYUN BEGAN ATTENDING GRAE SCHOOL IN HAWAII IN 1924. SOON HE WAS
taking part in the typical extra-curricular activities of school-
children, joining a boys’ organization called “Friendly Indians!

From the time he entered the fourth grade, he became assistant to
his father, making regular rounds of the Korean-American community on
the Island of Kauai and ministering to the Methodist flock whose mem-
bers needed economic as well as spiritual aid.

David thus learned, early in life, both from his wise father and
parishioners, that the material well-being of man goes hand-in-hand with
spiritual satbfaction He continued this social-religious work through-
out primary schooldays, and when still a lad, short of stature, he was
barely visible behind the steering wheel of the ancient car in which he
drove his father on his rounds.

 

David I-Iyun with fellow classnfcns of the ”gurdon club," 1930.

He entered Kauai High School in 1931. During his four years tuition

there he was chosen to represent the Korean-American Student publica-

tion, and to edit the High School Annual (his copy was scrawledaﬂ
over with a gush of greetings and expressions of undying friendship

between graduates).

He also served as vice-president of the student body, presided over

the “Hi Y Club", and awn the Islands—Wide Oratorical Contest on Whe
Meaning of the Uhited States Constitution." He was then 17 years old.

Meanwhile he steadily maintained his inter-church activities, con-
tinued to help his father whenever possible, and earned his way through
school by means of full-time work on sugar-plantations or in packing
plants, for meagre wages, and doing home gardening for school instruct-
ors during school days.

He graduated high school in 1934. with honors.

He worked full-time for a year before entering the Universityof

Hawaii, where he majored in Math and Physics and completed 3% years in
Civil Engineering. A bright student, he was throughout college days as
American as anyone could be: looking forward to the “pursuit of happi-
ness" with zestful love of freedom.

Cadet Captain David Hyun,
R.O.T.C. University of Hawaii

 

HE FIRST LEARNED HE WAS AN "ALIEN" WHEN JOINING THE UNIVERSITY ROTC
Because he was born in Asia he was not compelled to serve. However, he
desired to serve, and he paid for his own uniform and equipment.

His ROTC record was outstanding. Quite early he was commended and
made color guard, promoted to First Sergeant. and eventually became
Cadet Captain in charge of a company.

Also, during this period he edited the Territory-Wide “Korean Stu-
dents Annual” and was elected as president of the campus club.

He was working his way through college, earning extra money working
in pineapple canneries in summer months, and working as much as 35 hours
a week during semesters, as recreation instructor for the National Youth
Administration and handyman for faculty members.

In 1940, the year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, David
graduated from the University of Hawaii with a Bachelor of Science de-
gree. He immediately went to work as draftsman and mechanic with an en-
gineering firm.

About this time he met Dr. Y.C. Yang, present Ambassador from South
Korea to the United States. They were fellow members of the Korean
University Club.

Only the conversation of his father, who had recently retired from
active ministerial service, and other family members and friends remind-
ed David of his birth in Korea and his early childhood years in China.
He learnt, too, that Korea was still "occupied" by Japan and that an
“Independence” movement - torn with internal dissension - existed in
Korea and among Korean exiles scattered throughout the world.

But David was hardly even remotely identifiable with the tiny boy
of seven who came uath his family to Honolulu in 1o24 as political rejL
ugees. He was now a thorough—going American by education, outlook, ac-
tivities and associations. He looked forward to a professional career,
marriage and the building of a family.

He applied for U. S. citizenship, and though he was allowed to file
“first papers" he was denied the right to naturalization under the
Oriental Exclusion Law because of his birth in Korea.
