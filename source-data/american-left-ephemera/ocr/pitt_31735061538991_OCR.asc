HIGH TIME

Published by the COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS AT TIME INC.

MAY, 1939

HIS is the last issue of HIGH TIME. The Com-
munist Party of the United States (includ-
ing its members in Time Inc.) has decided to
discontinue publication of shop papers. The rea-
sons that HIGH TIME was published in the first
place and the reasons that it is now not to be
published are interesting. Since the Communist
Party has never made a secret of its policies, we
have no hesitation in explaining those reasons
frankly. . -

Communists seldom can state their case through
the usual channels, as capitalists do constantly.
Financed solely by the small «contributions of
American workers, the Communist Party cannot
afford to buy radio time often. It does not get a
hearing in the commercial press (that is, most of
the“ newspapers and magazines of America). The
press does not even pretend to report Communist
activities fairly and objectively, nor does it allow
Communists space to reply to its attacks on the
Communist program. So Communists long ago be-
gan to use substitute methods of getting their story
to the people. One of them was printing and dis-
tributing leaflets. Some of these were written by
Communists for their fellow workers in the same
factory, oflice or shop, and they were called shop
papers. Such a paper was HIGH TIME.

HIGH TIME had a two-fold purpose: to bring
fnto “the clear light of common knowledge” and
to examine critically Time Inc.’s employment
policies and editorial policies. It was really a col-
lective voice of Time’s employees, for it printed
what not Communists alone but many other work-
ers. in Time thought and said. It said things that

.;.::serl.ez‘....t:,~ be said .-Je.r~~..:e insecurity cf .~;;’;;.l.;yn:e:.I

at Time and apparently caused the management
to think about that problem. It also made all of
us much more sensitive to Time’s departures from
truth in the news. HIGH TIME does not believe that
the Time publications are invariably unfair. They
often publish honest, truthful and courageous ar-
ticles. But HIGH TIME, even in its short life, has
cited enough instances to prove that, whether from
ignorance or for more inexcusable reasons, Time
often does violence to the facts. We believe that
HIGH TIME has helped Time employees to under-
stand their publications better and detect bad
propaganda in them.

UT HIGH TIME has suffered from a heavy han-
icap which we readily recognize: its anonymi-
ty. Its authors would prefer not to be anonymous.
They were certainly not anonymous in order to
publish irresponsible statements, for nothing irre-
sponsible has appeared in HIGH TIME; every fact
has been checked more carefully than the Time
publications themselves check facts. The unblink-
able reality is that although the Communist Party
is a legal party in the United States, in their jobs
Communists do not enjoy full civil liberty. Most
employers, including Mr. Luce, would ﬁre a known
Communist like a shot. And so it has been neces-
sary for Communist shop papers, including HIGH
TIME, to refrain from naming their editors. That
brings us to the reasons why HIGH TIME is to be
discontinued.

The main reason is the Communist Party’s de-
sire to strengthen the democratic front against
fascism. Everyone knows that in recent years it
has been the Party’s policy to concentrate on that
objective. Not everyone understands the reasons
for that. Before fascism arose, the recurrence of
economic crises, each worse than the last, made it
obvious to anyone who thought seriously about the
matter that the days of laissez faire capitalism were
numbered. Communists knew that the increasing
suffering caused by capitalism’s collapse would

drive the people to change their economic system.
So did capitalists. While Communists tried to
make that drive fruitful by developing an eco-
nomic system that made better sense, namely so-
cialism, capitalists cast about for a means of re-
taining their proﬁts and control. They hit upon
fascism, a method of restraining the people by
force and regulating capitalism just enough so
that no. obedient citizenwould quite starve.

HE Communist Party believes that democracy
must be maintained at all costs, so that the
people may determine their own destiny, so that
eventually they may vote peacefully for socialism,
which is nothing more nor less than thoroughgoing
economic democracy. And so this party of the

common people has determined that its biggest-

immediate job is to stop fascism, to defend politi-
cal democracy. Democracy needs defending in the
United States. The victories of reactionary candi-
dates (thanks to red-herring-dragging by the press)
in some of last fall’s elections, the present economy
drive throughout the nation, directed against re-
lief, the schools and other social services, the re-
cent defeats of President Roosevelt’s liberal ap-
pointments and progressive measures by a coalition
of Republicans and reactionary Democrats in Con-
gress—all these signs portend no good to organized
labor and the rank and ﬁle of the people. There
are fascist tendencies in the rash of bills abridging
civil liberties, now pending in Congress and many
State legislatures, and in such deﬁance of the
popular will as the widespread disobedience of the
Wagner Labor Relations Act by employers.

Very likely neither Father Coughlin nor Torn
Girdler nor any of the present hopefuls of the Re-
publican Party will become an American dictator.
But they are sowing the seed. Fascism grows in
economic disaster and the people’s despair, and as
another depression approaches (if it has not al-
ready begun), the danger of fascism grows greater.

In the struggle that lies ahead, democracy can-
not be defended by passive wishing, nor by a
minority party alone. It can be saved only by the
active collaboration of all who love democracy.
They must make their wishes felt at Washington,
in the State legislatures and on the labor front.
The Communist Party, therefore, is throwing its
full energy into efforts to unite workers, farmers,
professionals, small businessmen. It avoids doing
anything which may disturb such unity. In the
labor unions it is working hard to eliminate fac-
tionalism, to bring workers together on a common
program.

To that end, the last national convention of the
Party last year decided to dissolve party “frac-
tions” in the unions, i.e., caucuses of Party mem-
bers who met to decide what proposed union poli-
cies they as union members would support. Today
Communists discuss union policies on the union
floor.

The abandonment of shop papers is a similar
step. Its purpose is to avoid setting Communists
apart as a group in their unions. They are not a
group apart, and the zeal of Communists in work-
ing to carry out progressive trade union programs
on which all sincere trade unionists agree is well
known. Nevertheless, because the appearance of a
Communist shop paper creates unjustiﬁed suspi-
cion and inevitably results in attempts to divide a
union, the Party has abandoned shop papers. In
doing so, the Party is motivated also by the grow-
ing progressiveness of the labor unions, which today
provide, in their broader publications, constructive
criticism of working conditions such as the Party
shop papers provided.

ELL, this decision means that the Commu-
, nist Party is pulling its head into its shell,
does it not? Actually, not at all. For today the
Communist Party, in spite of an unprecedented
campaign of misrepresentation and name-calling,
led by the Dies Committee, is stronger than ever.
It is no longer an underground organization. Its
representatives appear and are given a hearing
In legislative halls. Its nominees poll a large vote.
In last fall’s elections that vote increased spectacu-
larly. In place of its shop papers, the Party plans
to publish neighborhood papers in geographical
units, where their editors can be identiﬁed and no
trade union divisions can occur. The Party has an
inﬂuential and growing general press in the Daily
Worker, other dailies in Chicago and San Fran-
cisco, The New Masses. The Party has nearly
100,000 members.

Most encouraging of all, its policy of building
the democratic front has borne fruit. It was a
people’s front in the United States, a union of
organized labor, organized farmers, organized in-
tellectuals, that elected the New Deal and com-
pelled the enactment of more legislation for the
welfare of the people than had been enacted in
nearly a century before 1933. The Communist
Party of course does not claim that it alone ac-
complished that progress. It believes that the rank
and ﬁle of the people of this country have demon-
strated for themselves how great is their power if
they stand together. In creating a great, progres-
sive labor movement they have created instruments
by which they may gain their desires and maintain
their demosfretic institutions. »

What is true of the nation as a whole is true
of workers in Time Inc. To them, HIGH TIME
offers this valedictoryz Let those who would live
in a democratic world raise their collective voice.
