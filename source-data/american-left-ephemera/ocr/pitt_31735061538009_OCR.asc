perate strikes which must accompany such campaigns. They are
class collaborationists, they are afﬂicted with many of the craft
prejudices and much of the conservatism of the right wing. But,
under the pressure of the left wing, they can be pushed into doing
effective organizing work.

The essential form of an organizing committee or move-
ment under present conditions in the American labor movement
is a united front between the left wing and the progressives, with
the left wing functioning as the driving force.

Sabotage by the Right Wing.
The right wing controlling bureaucrats are the real stumbling
block to organization. They primarily represent the skilled work-

ers.,j. They fear that the organization of the unorganized masses '

of semi-skilled and unskilled will overwhelm the organized skilled
workers. The bureaucrats want to maintain craft lines and craft
interests,” in wage scales, in organization forms, and in various
otlierways, and they know that the inﬂux of the unorganized,

mass will tend to wipe out these special interests. They know '

that the struggle to organize the unorganized will compel the
skilled workers to abandon their class collaboration policies, and
they fear it will force them into ﬁghts against the employers that
will jeopardize their craft organizations and preferred wage
scales. J .

They know that with the mass organized, the skilled workers
will not be able to trade so successfully at the expense of the

‘unskilled. workers‘, as, for example, the Railroad Brotherhoods ,

and many other unions are now doing. The right wing bureau-
crats fear the unskilled will ﬂood the unions and capture them
from _the skilled. They dread the inﬂux of the mass because it

lmeans a general disturbance of the equilibrium in the organiza-

tions, the rise of new leaders, and probably their own displace-
ment. They sense the general revolutionizing effect of the inﬂux
of semi-skilled and unskilled workers into the unions, and they
shrink from it. p . _

_ Hence, the right wing bureaucracy is ordinaritly opposed to
the organization of the unorganized,‘ except along their narrow
craft lines, where they often display organizing activity. ‘Their
policy is to set up bars against apprentices, against helpers, and

10

 

4 , _h , 4__A, L __

 

 

to develop their unions into job trusts. They concentrate in cer-
tain industries easy to organize, such as the Electrical Workers’
Union, conﬁning itself principally to the building trades; the
Metal Trades Unions, specializing on the railroads, While they

‘A neglect other industries “hard” to organize.

Even when driven into organizing campaigns by pressure,
the right wing bureaucrats refuse to lend them real support. At
best they then only trail along. Their policy is one of sabotage.
They are affected by a hundred petty craft considerations, and
they raise innumerable technical and other objections in order
to hinder the Qrganizing work. Oftenthey co-operate with the
employers to prevent organization. They usually will accept mass
organization if it is “handed to theme on a silver platter” by the
left wing organizers, but they will not go out and ﬁght for it.
They are lazy, unimaginative, corrupt and petty bourgeois.‘ The
left wing must consider and deal with them as a major obstacle

‘ in the work of organizing the unorganized.

Stimulating the Trade Unions Into Action.

It would be a grievous error, however, to conclude from the
foregoing that the right Wing can block the organization of the
unorganized by the trade unions and that nothing can be done in
these bodies. A Whole series of organization campaigns ‘by the
trade unions belie this pessimism. The impulse of the labor

internationals in the steel "and packing industry campaigns. And/'
on the railroads the more progressive elements were responsible

for the organization of hundreds of thousands of the unorgan-

ized during the War period.  V, ”

The right Wing bureaucrats find it exceedingly difficult to
ﬁght directly against the demand for organization. Their method
is mostly indirect. They commonly adopt organization resolu-
tions, presented by the more progressive elements, and then sab-
otage them to death. They do lip service to the organization of
the unorganized and then prevent it in practice. The American

In the struggle against the right wing over the question of
organizing the unorganized, two principal dangers confront the
left wing, both of which must be guarded against. The ﬁrst is
a pessimistic conclusion that the trade unions cannot be stimu-
lated to do organization work. The second, the other extreme,
is a naive, over-optimistic belief that the right wing will put into
effect the adopted resolutions calling for the organization of the
unorganized.

Both of these tendencies block real organization work. The
proper policy in the trade unions is for the left wing to enter
into alliance with the progressive elements, to force the adoption
of programs of organization, and then themselves to do the
‘actual work of organizing, in spite of the sabotage of the right
wing. The theme of this chapter is correct; upon the left wing
rests primarily the burden of organizing the unorganized.

Chapter III.
THE A.lF. OF L. AND INDEPENDENT UNIONS.

MOST important question for T. U. E. L. militants to under-
stand. in order to carry through sucessfully our work of organ-
izing the unorganized, is our relationship to the A. F. of L. and
Independent Unions. Our goal must be to build mass labor or-
ganization of the workers, and tofbring or maintain these unions
in afﬁliation with the general labor movement, the American
Federation of Labor. This involves the two-sided policy of: (a)! -
stimulating the existing unions into organizing campaigns; and
(b) forming new unions in industries where there are no unions
or where the existing unions are hopelessly decrepit. The two I
evils We have to guard against are on the one side, the devil of
dual unionism, and on the other, the dogma of unity_with the old
trade unions “at any price.” ' »

The advantages of bringing the newly organized workers into
the existing labor movement are manifest, save in certain excep-
tional cases. In most instances positive and direct support for
these workers in their initial crucial struggles is gained by such
affiliation. But even where this is not the case, there are cer-

V tain negative advantages of aﬂiliation to the A. F. of L. For one

thing, the workers are shielded from the disastrous attacks of
the bureaucracy, which are always leveled against dual unions.
To a certain extent, also, -the conservative name of the A. F. of L.
saves the workers from the attaclis of the employers and the
state, even though their policies begs militant as those of any in-
dependent union.   _  T , .

But perhaps the most imporﬁ asit of afﬁliation to the
A. F. of L. is the feeling of thevnewly organized workers that they 1 /
are connected up with the mass labor movement of the country.
This ordinarily gives them far greater conﬁdence and staying
power. It is a feeling they do not acquire in independent unions.
Among a certain section of unorganized Workers there is a deep
hostility towards the American Federation of Labor. The T. U.

E. L. militants must not allow themselves to be dominated by
this antagonism. They must and can 1iqui_date it wherever the

, interests of the workers dictate that they shall be affiliated to the

A. F. of L. unio-ns.
Formation of New Unions.

In the industries Where there are no A. F. of L. unions our
course is clear. We must form new unions and bring them into
afﬁliation with the broad labor movement as quickly as practic-
ability permits. Or if there be independent unions in such indus-
tries we must give them our active support and work for their
affiliation to the A. F. of L. In those ﬁelds where the I. W. W.
functions more or less effectively, such for example as among the
luinber, general construction, and agricultural workers, we must
support it.

In industries where there are A. F. of L. unions, but Where
these unions are so Weak and decrepit, with corrupt leadership,
hidebound agreements, etc., that it is impossible to stimulate them
into the necessary activity to mobilize the mass militant organ-
ization campaigns or to defend their interests in strikes arising
therefrom, our problem is more complicated. There the advan-
tage of affiliation may easily beloutweighed by the disadvantages.
Such situations raise the question of independent unionism in its

 ‘:1 most intricate form. In spite of our most urgent desire for unity
‘ with the general labor movement, we will often, under these cir-
‘ mimstances, be compelled to form independent unions.

But wherever we form such new unions, whether because
there are no A. F. of L. unions in the ﬁeld or because those that
may exist are absolutely decrepit, We must from the outset follow
a program for the affiliation of these unions to the A. F. of L.
We must be keenly on our guard not to get into a dual union
position, by declaring against ,the A. F. of L. in principle or by
permitting an open warfare to develop against it. Experience
teaches us that dual unionism means sectarianism, isolation from
the broad labor movement, and eventually disintegration. One of
the outstanding contributions of the Communist International
and the Red International of Labor Unions to the American labor
movement is their categoric condemnation of dual unionism.

Dualism must be fended off by a two—sided policy of: (a),

14

' their place is in unity with the mass of workers in the A. F. of L.;
and (b), to begin a series of maneuvers to get into affiliation 1
with the A. F. of L. 

The Fight for Affiliation. :4

Such a policy is bound to be successful. On the one hand it E
i

E

teaching the membership of the new unions from the start that ‘
I

checks the dangerous and ever—present spirit of sectarianism, and
on the other hand it either leads to amalgamation and affiliation,
or it gives the new union many of the advantages of affiliation ,
by breaking up the official bureaucratic opposition. When per- ‘ll
capita—tax-hungry trade union officials see a fat independent ‘'
union that wants to affiliate to their organiaztion, they are much
inclined to look upon it with some degree of friendliness and
tolerance, even though, for the time being, they are afraid to
accept its aﬂiliation. Negotiations for affiliation by independent
unions give them standing in the broad labor movement by mak-
, ing that movement understand that the new union feels itself
i to be a part of the main body of organized labor. This, in turn,
*~ strengthens the rank and file of the new union by a knowledge I
of the general friendliness of the mass labor movement.

But while militantly propagandizing amalgamation and
maneuvering for its accomplishment, the new unions must make
every effort to work in harmony with the old unions, by the ini-
tiation of joint organization campaigns, by assisting them in their
strikes, etc. Its aim must be to generally create a spirit of friend-
ly co-operation which shall culminate in an amalgamation.

Where independent unions have been set up, and especially
where there are already existing A. F. of L. unions in the ﬁeld,
our greatest danger comes from a dual union tendency to repel
the old organizations and to maintain an independent existence
of the new union. This bases itself upon various illusions and
wrong policies, such as utopian hopes for the future of the new,
union, under-estimation of the power and importance of the old?
unions, the tendency to seek reasons to quarrel with the old} /
unions rather than to co-operate with them, neglect of ama'l’,.-X
gamation and maneuvers to bring about a consolidation, the pre-
sentation of impossible programs as the basis of amalgamation
or aﬂiliation, etc. -

This whole dual union tendency must be relentlessly com-
batted and the policy pursued of coming more closely into co-

 

’  operation and aﬂiliation with the old unions. The T. U. E. L.

l}; ?1’ilitants must also guard against the opposite tendency of mak-
" , .. rig affiliation with the old unions a fetishism, or develop a “unity—

at—any—price” program. Such a policy is wrong and might easily
 I do big damage by resulting in a surrender off-hand of the leader-
 / ship of strikes, organizing campaigns, and new-formed unions to
 ultra reactionary leaders who would destroy them.

ll

Often these leaders will propose such terms of affiliation as
 to make their acceptance tantamount to the sacrifice of the in-

terests of the workers. We must ﬁght for aﬂiliation to the A. F.
of L. unions, but We also must ﬁght for honest and militant lead-
er_ship, and mass industrial organization. Our growing left wing
leaders must ‘be provided a place to function in the unions, and
above all, at this stage, we must retain the initiative in carrying
on the great work of organizing the unorganized.

In working out propositions of affiliation, or-operating within
the trade unions, these ends must not be lost sight of. One of our
most delicate. tactical problems will be to judge when we can
best further these ends by affiliation to the existing unions, and
when it will be necessary to form or maintain independent or-
ganizations.

But again I emphasize, the greatest danger that the left
wing confronts in such situations is the persistent dual union
tendency to pull away from the old unions and to establish new
and independent organization which isolate our forces from the
main body of organized workers.

Jurisdictional Problems.

Under the general head of left wing relationship to the old
unions, must be considered the problem presented by the juris-

. dictional claims of these organizations. First, the question of
open jurisdictional ﬁghts. In many cases left wingers, taking the
points of view of their respective craft unions, become deeply im-
mersed in the jurisdictional quarrels of their organizations, with
the result that their arguments and programs are almost indis-
tinguishable from those of the ordinary craft unionist. This is
fundamentally wrong. We must rise above such petty, short-

16

' aﬂiliate them, or seek persistentlyto aﬂiliate them to the A, F.

sighted quarrels and base our policy upon the interests of all the
workers in the totality of the unions involved.

Then there is the situation, common in many industries,
where a score of unions, most of them with little or no organized ,
membership in the industry, claim jurisdiction over the workers
of their respective trades in the industry. The left wing cannot
support such ridiculous jurisdictional claims, nor can we Wait
until these reactionary unions decide to amalgamate with stronger

n o o 1 
and more basic unions in the industry. Sometimes it will be it-;_;-_

necessary, in such situations, for the left Wing to ignore the
claims of these dog-in-the-manger unions, and support the basic
unions at the expense of the weaker ones.

Thus, for example, in the steel industry, we must at this V
time insist that the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel &

Tin Workers take in all workers in and around the steel mills A
regardless of the claims of a score or more of other unions for
certain categories of these workers. Also, in the metal industry
generally, we must more and more apply such a policy with re-
gard to the Machinists’ Union. ,

In thus precipitating amalgamation from the bottom, and the A
realignment of the unions according to industrial lines, we must,
however, take care not to provoke open jurisdictional struggles
betw'een the unions.

In the general problem. of our left wing attitude towards the
A. F. of L. and the independent unions, the T. U. E. L. policy must
be: in industries with strong unions, we shall build up these or- .
ganizations; in industries with no unions or with incurably de
crepit unions, we shall form independent. organizations and th

    

of L. This is the basic program ‘which the necessities o t e
present situation dictate. *

Chapter IV.
METHODS OF ORGANIZATION.

N the United States, the taslg of organizing the workers is an ’

extremely complicated and difficult one. The situation in the
industries is not uniform. In industries that are competitive in
character, especially where there are established unions or where
the workers have a tradition of organization, unions and efforts,
to organize them are tolerated; or at least not violently perse-
cuted. .

In other industries, where the organization and tradition of
unionism are weak, and the employers, highly organized, are
applying a militant “open shop” policy, the unions are ruthlessly
crushed and attempts to establish them are met with an iron
repression. This situation necessitates upon our part two gen-
eral kinds of organizing work, open and secret. Bet us ﬁrst dis-
cuss “open” organization Work.

“Open” Organization Campaigns.

It is possible to carry on “open” trade union organization
work in many industries -such as on various railroads, in half
organized northern coal ﬁelds, in the unorganized sections of the
building, needle, culinary, and printing trades, and in the general
mass of small metal and other competitive industries, Where the
employers are not strongly organized. In such situations are
commonly found trade unions, howiever weak. Wherever “open”
trade union organization is possible, the task of the left wing
consists, for the most part, in stimulating the existing unions into
carrying on open organizational campaigns among the workers
by mass meetings, individual. solicitation, etc.

To develop this activity of the old unions necessitates a
variety of means. Every phase and stage of the movement must be
stirred up on the organization question. In every local union the
question of organizing the unorganized must be made a burning
one, and committees established to unite the Workers. Between

18

 

 

 

the local unions of one craft, or among those of several crafts in
one industry, joint organization campaigns can be established.
The Central Labor Councils can also be stirred into action.

A number of years ago the A. F. of L. used to promote in
the various cities what were called “Labor Forward” movements.

In these all the unions of a given city rallied for a general or-_

ganizing campaign, many internationals sending in organizers
to assist. Often good work was done. The “Labor Forward”
type of movement should be revived. Likewise the International
Unions, especially a-t their conventions, can be energized into
making national organizing campaigns in their respective juris-
dictions, either alone or in co-operation with related unions.

In all this stimulation of the trade unions it must never be
lost sight of, however, that the left wing must lead in the actual
work of organizing. Simply to pass resolutions calling for or-
ganization, and then to leave the matter to the oiﬁcialdom, is
futile. Their policy is to let such resolutions die a quiet death.
They cling desperately to old forms and practices. They have to
be crowded into action.

The left wing and the progressives must follow up their reso-

» lutions by demanding the formation of large organizing commit-

tees through which they can carry on actual work of organiza-
tion. Such committees must know how to force through the
necessary reductions of initiation fees, and to generally remove
the many barriers which the reactionary leadership has raised
against the organization of their fellow workers. They must
also kno-w how to mobilize the full ﬁnancial resources of the
unions and to bring the general membership into the organiza-
tion work. Such organization committees offer splendid oppor-
tunities to bring forward the Whole T. U. E. L. program and to
mobilize all the progressive elements in the unions against the
right wing bureaucracy and the employers.

“Closed” Organization Campaigns.

There are many other indsutries, o~n'the other hand, such as
steel, textile, rubber, southern coal ﬁelds, on many railroads, etc.,
etc., where unionism has been eliminated and where “open” or-
ganization work is practically impossible because of the terrorism
of the employers. In these “closed” industries, we must adopt

“LENIN AND THE TRADE UNION
MOVEMENT”

By A. LOSOVSKY.

In this book, written by the secretary of the Red
International of Labor Unions, is told the intensely
interesting story of the development of the ideas of
Lenin during his thirty years of activity, how he
studied the labor movement and drew from it such
conclusions that are a guide to action in the trade
union movement, as in his work as a whole, Lenin
is acknowledged by friend and foe as the world's
greatest labor statesman.

“Leninism has taught the left wing how and
where to fight," says William 2. Foster in the
introduction to this book. “Every militant and

— progressive worker who hopes to become a
factor in the trade union movement must be-
come acquainted with Lenin's great work in
the field of -trade unionism.”

We add that this book is as interesting as any
story can be of the personal development of any
genius in any field of human endeavor.

“secret” or indirect methods of organization.

A most important consideration in these “closed,” unorgan—_

ized industries, is the fact that the left wing must take the initia-
tive in the organizing work, to a far greater extent than in the
“open,” sem‘i—organized industries. Usually there are no unions
at all in the “closed” industries to be stimulated into action and
upon whose resources the left wing can draw. The reactionary
leaders refuse to tackle these tough industries. Consequently the
left wing has to depend primarily upon its own resources and
upon its own direct initiative in launching and carrying through
the-organization campaigns. '

In the industries which are “closed” against trade unionism
by the terrorism of the employers, our basic method for organ-
izing work must be “secret” or indirect in character. It is true
that upon occasion, as in the big organizing campaign among the
steel workers in 1918-19, such gigantic efforts can be put forth
directly that the workers can be openly mobilized in spite of the
most violent opposition by the employers. The left wing must
seek to develop such broad, sweeping “open” campaigns. But
they are the exception. Most-of the work in these industries will
have to be done on a relatively small scale, which means more or
less underground.” " '

Company Unions and Workers’ Clubs.

For a long time the trade unions have used “secret” methods
of organization in such instances. ‘But their efforts have been
crude and ineffective, being usually merely the quiet recruitment
of members into local unions which are spy ridden, ordinarily
dead of dry-rot, of repression by the employers, or through pre-
mature strikes. The left wing will have to be far more skilful in
“underground” trade union organization. It must utilize the most
diverse forms of proletarian organization in order to secure a
basis for the establishment of, unions, or for the launching of
strike movements which will eventually result in building unions.

One form of organization which must be utilized for this
work is the company union. Company unions ﬂourish especially
in those industries “closed” to trade unionism. The left wing
must carry on a policy of working within these organizations

20

 

-,,.«._._ ...___

 

‘,_..._1.._ _n.,,

 

1 where they have any degree of mass participation, with the ultim-

ate aim of destroying them and building trade unions.

We must raise economic demands of the workers in these
organizations in order to expose their nature as instruments of
the employers and to crystallize the discontent of the workers.
We must participate in the plant elections in order to sharpen
and clarify the struggle of the workers against the employers,
and to place our men in strategic positions. At the company
union conventions, especially on the railroads, the question of
trade unionism can be raised effectively.

The experience during the movement of the steel workers,
in 1918-19, when many company unions were captured from
the employers, as well as the experience among many other
groups of workers shows clearly that these organizations can be
utilized for the launching of movements among the workers
which culminate in the destruction of the company unions and
the formation of trade unions.

Another form of organization valuable for organizing in the
“closed” industries, is the various workers’ clubs and fraternal
organizations in the industrial towns. Made up for the most part
of unskilled, foreign-language speaking workers, they readily
adapt themselves to- supporting drives to organize the local in-
dustries. Under cover of these clubs general organizational pro-
paganda can be successfully carried on and committees formed
to lay the ﬁrst foundations of trade union organization for the
various factories. In the textile industry, particularly in Passaic,
Lawrence, etc., their value has been demonstrated. They are to
play an important role in the organization of the great masses of
workers. _

The left wing must follow a policy of establishing such work-
ers’ clubs and fraternal organizations and of winning over those
already in existence, especially in cities dominated by one or two
industries. This does not mean, however, the inauguration of a
campaign to use such clubs as organizing instruments generally
in the industries where there are unions. Wherever it is possible
to organize openly and directly into the trade unions, we must
by all means utilize the opportunity.

Shop Nuclei and Shop Committees.

The shop nuclei of th Workers (Communist) Party are an
organizational form of gr:ft importance in the organization of
the unorganized Workers. These nuclei, distributed Widely
through the industries and uilt upon the basis of the respective
factories, will prove invalua, 1e contact points for the startingiof
broad movements for _the launching of strikes and the establish-
ment of trade unions. Their factory papers Will arouse and edu-
cate the Workers, giving voice to their demands, organizing the
resistance to the company unions, and generally preparing the
ground for trade unionism.

The shop committee movement will_ also be used very proﬁt-
a__bly in the organization of the workers in the “closed” industries.

jxmong the unor anized"‘vvgr,_1_1;ers this movement consists in the
 ' orma ion of committees, moremor less informal, representing the

workers, department by department and”facto~ry by factory. It
carries on a struggle forthe demands of the workers and for
their recruitment into trade unions. In France the shop com-
mittee movement among the unorganized Workersmanifests it-
self pretty much as an “open” movement. In the United States,
however, it will be very largely a semi-“secret” movement in its
earlier stages. The-Malu§.9.£,,§!£9..§£.9£..£.9iQ}.QiE$ X&H$S.

, Under certain circumstances, all these various forms of pro-
letarian organization, such as workers’ clubs, fraternal organiza-
tions, shop nuclei, shop committees, etc., can be joined together
in united front movements, thps uniting all the threads of “under-
ground” organization and facilitating the creation of open trade
unions. Even the representatives of company unions should be
admitted to such united front ‘committees unless there are special
reasons for excluding them. i ‘

All these proletarian organizations will play a big part in the
organization of the workers in the “closed” industries. They will

ployers are not so hostile but Where the Workers are simply
lethargic. Yet they offer no royal road to organization. Upon
occasion the employers will ﬁght them bitterly. They will dis-
charge the workers for militant activities in company unions;
they will clean out the shop committee men; they will ﬁre work-
ers for membership in clubs that are showing a tendency towards

trade unionism; they will ‘ﬁll all these institutions with detectives. .

Nevertheless, We must utilize them. They offer the means for a

ground.” The question of determining just hoW.far we can Work —

inthe “open” and how much we will have‘ to use the indirect
method, will prove one of the mo-st delicate problems We have to

solve in our organization campaigns.

 

 

 

 

Chapter V.
ORGANIZATION AND STRIKES.

HE organization of the unorganized on any considerable scale
in American industry inevitably precipitates hard-fought
strikes. Organization campaigns are the ﬁrst phase of bitter
struggles between the workers and employers over questions of
Wages, hours, Working conditions and the right to organize.

In most industries the acute phase of the struggle, the strike,
comes quickly. Usually, when an organization campaign begins,
the employers take the initiative and try to nip the movement in
the bud by militantly attacking it. But even if they do not follow
this course, the Workers themselves will soon"‘precipitate the
strike struggle by raising their demands against the employers.
This basic connection of strikes with organization movements is
a foundation fact. All our strategy in the campaign to organize
the unorganized turns around it. i

The Question of Demands.

The ﬁrst consideration is to center our campaigns of organ-
ization around the economic demands of the workers. The un-
organized Workers have very little understanding of or desire for
trade unionism as such. It is only the advanced elements who
appreciate the real value of organization. When the masses join
unions it is in the hope of securing immediate satisfaction for
their burning grievances. They want unions directly for What
they can get through them from the employers, and usually they
will not wait long for results. Therefore, We must make the
ﬁght for the workers’ demands the basis of all our tactics in our
organization work, bringing?‘ in ~o’ur general left Wing program a
the struggle develops. W -

A glaring weakness of conservative trade unionists in at-
tempting to organize the unorganized, is their failure to take into
consideration this fact, that the mass of Workers have organized
themselves in order to ﬁght immediately for their demands. The
conservatives stress the purely organizational side too much and
24

,....._u

 

 

 

the struggle side too little. They ignore the urgency of the
workers’ demands. They assume that the mass of workers under-
stand the general value of trade unionism as such. They proceed
upon the basis that the workers can be brought into the unions
slowly, man by man, and then held there and disciplined indef-
initely until the great mass is organized, when, sometime in the

distant future, possibly demands will be made on the employers‘

for better conditions.

Such a theory is of course absurd. It always fails in prac-
tise, a case in point being the ﬁasco of the recent A. F. of L. or-
ganization campaign in the steel industry.

The future trade unions of the great unorganized industries
will be born in the heat of the struggle against the employers over
the demands of the workers. The organization campaign which
does not voice the demands of the workers and envisage an early
struggle in defense of them is doomed beforehand to failure.

The nature of the workers’ demands are determined by the
state of the industry and the moods of the employers and wo-rkers

concerned. In periods of slackened industry, with the employers .

on the offensive, the ﬁght of the workers in their present stage
of ideological development will be to maintain existing standards,
to struggle against wage cuts, lengthening of the work day, etc.
In periods of “prosperity,” the workers will ﬁght for better wa.ges,

shorter hours, etc. But, in any event, in good times or bad, the,

struggle for organization must center around the defense of the
workers’ pressing demands. The workers are especially militant
in ﬁghting against reductions of their living standards. The ﬁght
against wage cuts is one of the very best issues upon which to
organize the workers and to bring them into struggle against
the employers. ‘ ‘

Organization, Strategy.

Organization campaigns in American unorganized industries
are preparations for strikes. They are a struggle for position be-
tween the employers and workers in the big battle that is soon
to come, the strike over the establishment of better conditions.
It is in this sense that such campaigns must be conceived and
carried through.

25

 

  

To prevent the organization of their workers, the employers
have a whole arsenal of weapons which they use with skill and
ruthlessness. When modern employers cut wages they com-
monly slash one group of workers at a time, thus breaking up
the solidarity of the workers; instead of using the old-time method
of making broad-sweeping wage cuts in all departments simul-
taneously, which united the workers. This canny policy makes
the work of the organizer diﬂicult. -

The employers also. ﬁght the introduction of trade unions by
setting up company unions. And when actually confronted with
militant organizing campaigns, they try to break them up by
granting wage increases, discharging active workers, forcing
premature strikes, abolishing free assembly in their company
towns, etc. In the steel campaign of 1918-19, for example, the
steel trust, to head off the movement, conceded the workers sev-
eral increases in wages and established the basic 8-hour day,
while at the same time carrying on a policy of terrorism against
the unions and the workers who joined them.

Plan, Scope, Spirit.

The T. U. E. L. left wing militants must learn to defeat this
anti-union. strategy of the employers by the development of a
thorough-going strategy of organization in support of the work-
ers’ economic demands. The very heart of this strategy is: (a)
our organization work must be carefully planned; (b) it must
embrace the widest possible scope of workers in each case; (c)
it must be accompanied by an inspiring propaganda.

One of the greatest weakness of conservatives in trade union
organization work is their pol-icy of dabbling. They simply drift
into their campaigns, haphazard and planlessly, wherever some
local stir wakes them up a bit. Their efforts are mostly conﬁned
to a local and craft basis, with consequent failure. The method
of the general office of the A. F. of L. itself is typical. It has
never followed a thought-out plan for the organization of the
workers. It simply sends its organizers around, hither and yon,
wherever strikes happen to develop, and these organizers handle
such strikes without regard to the situation in the industry as a
w'hole. This is a policy of following the masses, not leading them.

The left wing must depart radically from such a primitive
policy, which is totally unﬁtted for modern American industry.
When we get into an organizing campaign in a given locality or
industry, We must do so on the basis of a careful analysis of the
whole situation. And we must make a determined effort for the
utmost mobilization of our forces for the struggle. We must
actually lead in the organization work.

Moreover, when the left wing undertakes an organization
campaign it must be made as broad and sw‘eeping as possible.
Our aim must be for the organization of the whole industry, and
all our strategy must go in that direction. Craftism and localism
aretotally out of place and must be fought. In most cases, as
at the ‘present time in the railroad industry, we will, by analysis,
ascertain the opportune time for the organization of the masses
and we will work for the necessary nation-wide campaigns.

But where we are caught napping, so to speak, by sudden
local strike movements of workers in national industries, We
must immediately undertake to spread these movements out on
a national scale. The trustiﬁed state of American industries pre-
vents alsuccessful ﬁght being made on a local scale except in
the most favorable and unusual circumstances.

It must be our special endeavor in all these campaigns to
Win over and develop the youth, who are the bridge to and uniting
force between the masses of foreign-born-workers and the Amer-
ican Workers.

Strike Strategy.

We must also accompany our organization work with a mili-
tant educational propaganda. We must yearn to raise not only
the economic demands of the workers, but also learn to ﬁre the
workers with the spirit of revolutionary enthusiasm. Strikes
offer ideal opportunities to point out to the Workers the full politi-
cal consequences of the class struggle and to awaken their class
spirit and consciousness. One of the failures of conservative
trade unionism is it almost‘ total lack of idealism. It fails to
arouse the ﬁghting spirit of the workers, which can only be done
by militant propaganda. ‘ ‘ ’

Successful trade union organizers must be masters of strike
strategy. One thing they must know it how to deal a blow at

27

 

the employers opportunely. The left wing must learn to hit the

. employers When they are least able to stand it, and to deliver the

attack with a maximum force. The employers are wide awake to
this danger and follow the counter policy of trying to force the
workers into premature struggles.

This was the policy of the steel trust in the 1918-19 cam-
paign. Gary tried to compel the steel workers to strike in cer-
tain localities before the national organization had been com-
pleted, by discharging thousands of them. His aim was to de-
moralize the movement before it got well started. We bitterly
resisted this tactic, forcing the attacked points to stand fast
under the severest pressure until We could mobilize the rest of
the steel workers to support them. Thus we gained most precious
time in which to organize. Nevertheless, Gary did succeed in
precipitating the strike before We were fully prepared for it.

When and How.

On the basis of a careful analysis of the state of the industry
and of the condition of the workers’ forces, the left wing must
learn when to strike and when to organize. Nothing is more

disastrous than ill-timed strikes and organization campaigns, _

which needlessly victimize the Workers and break their spirit.

Left wing organizers must learn every phase of the art of
mobilizing effectively the masses in struggles against the em-
ployers. They must know how to dramatize their strikes and to
make them spur the class instincts not only of the workers in-
volved, but of the Whole working class. They must understand
how to mobilize public sentiment behind their cause, and espe-
cially to enlist the support of the trade union movement. They
must be experts in the collection and distribution of relief. They
must understand the technique of mass picketing and the applica-
tion of the boycott. They  at all times display unfaltering
personal courage. A,‘ Jr,‘

They must know. how ..t(f.build their trade unions among the
inexperienced Workers during the strike, and how to take advan-
tage of such big struggles as that in Passaic by organizing the
masses in surrounding industries and localities who are inspired
by the struggle. In short, they must be practical strike leaders

28

 

vev-«,«,~.--4 . _ . .~>«-_,\..__~,-1....

. __.._.._ -,. ____.____..,,..,.-. _,,-~ ....... .,... ._ ,.-. -,

in order to be effective organizers, and to do this they must take
an active part in all the struggles of the Workers.

The question of organizing the unorganized becomes daily
more pressing. The T. U. E. L. and the left wing generally, have
a central part to play in the great developing movement for or-
ganization. This part We can play effectively if We will bear in
mind the few general principles of organization elaborated above,
namely, that the left wing must lead in and do the burden of the
organization" work, that we must avoid isolation from the organ-
ized masses and be prepared to utilize every form of proletarian
organization in the “closed” industries to further the establish-
ment of unions. -4

We must study carefully the state of the industry and the
condition of the employers’ and the Workers’ forces, base our or-
ganization campaigns upon the economic demands of the Work-
ers and at all times keep the ﬁght focussed on these demands,
plan our organization campaigns carefully and thoroughly mobil-
ize all our forces to put them into execution, extend our scope
of activity over the greatest possible extent of workers, strike
the blow at the opportune time, demoralize the enemy, rouse

- public sentiment with our maneuvers, develop the utmost ﬁghting

spirit in our own ranks by our invigorating propaganda, and fol-
low up our victories to the limit by organizing all the workers
shaken into action by our big strikes and struggles.

" The left wing must take the lead in the organization of the
unorganized millions. This is an historic necessity of the situa-
tion. We must not falter or fail at our task. It is a time for
intelligent, courageous, militant action.

trade union movement from the world view-
point, which deals not so much with the statics
(the unilluminating details of organization and

COMPANY UNIONS

By ROBERT w. DUNN
(With Conclusionkby WM. 2. FOSTER)

This booklet isindispgnsablel to any trade union-
ist who wants to kniowvivvhat is happening in the
labor movement of this country.

7 This shows what it means to the trade unions
that the company unions in American industry em-
brace more than a third the number of the mem-
bership of the American Federation of Labor.

~What caused company unions? What permits
‘them to exist? All is told briefly and accurately.
Besides, the author gives scores of interesting
examples of how thecompany unions work, the
details of their functions in speeding up the work-
ers, allowing the workers to let off steam over
small things but smothering their struggles for
more wages, shorter hours and for real labor
unions. . 1 , .,

The most vicious part of all is the trend among
trade union officials‘toj‘co-operate” with the bosses
and transform the trade, unions of workers into

Chapter I. ' ‘
IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIZING THE UNORGANIZED.

HE question of organizing the many millions of unorganized’

workers is the most vital matter now before the American
labor movement. The future progress of the working class de-
pends upon the solution of this great problem.

The organization of the unorganized is a 1if_e and death ques-
tion ‘for the labor movement. To bring the millions into the
unions is necessary not only for the protection of the of the un-
organized workers, and to further class ends in general, -but also
to safeguard the life of the existing organizations." Many of the
trade unions are now‘ under such heavy attacks from the em-
ployers that their very existence is‘threatened. These struggles
can be resolved favorably to the Workers only by drawing to their
support the great mass of unorganized. '

The Miners’ Union is a‘ case in point. The bituminous coal
industry is shifting from the organized ﬁelds of Illinois, Ohio, In-

. diana and Pennsylvania, into the southern unorganized districts,

with consequent heavy unemployment among the union miners.
The coal operators are taking advantage of this fact by smashing
the union in the organized districts. Unless the southern ﬁelds
are unionized, the United Mine Workers of America is doomed.

Unions in Danger.
To a greater or lesser extent similar menacing conditions

_exist among the unions of Railroad Workers, Metal Workers,

Needle Workers, etc. They -are not only seriously weakened, but
they cannot even» exist with such large sections of their indus-
tries Working under non-union conditions.

5

... .... ..............l..\......xu——-.’ ..—.

 

-~.....

The organization of the unorganized masses will mean a tre-
mendous step forward to the general revolutionizing of the labor
movement. At present the unions have only 3,500,000 workers
out of a total of at least 20,000,000 who are organizable. Doubling
or tripling the total number of organized Workers will, merely by
the increased weight of organized labor alone, enormously en-
hance its power and stimulate all its institutions.

But, bringing the masses into the unions means much more
than simply to add them ‘numerically to the number of organized

' workers. Far more important will be the consequent changing

in the composition of the unions and the shifting of their centers
of gravity into the heavy and key industries.

Will Create a New Spirit of Progresss.

- The overwhelming bulk of the unorganized masses are semi-
skilled and wnskilled. They are the most proletarian and revolu-
tionary section of the working class. Of the 3,500,000 organized
wrorkers, fully one-half are highly skilled. They dominate the
whole movement and color it and restrict it with their craft prej-
udices and petty bourgeois conceptions.
present unorganized semi-skilled and unskilled workers will
drown out these unhealthy tendencies and start the movement
in the direction of revolutionary development. The newly or-
ganized workers, with no craft interests to preserve, will tend
strongly in the direction of industrial unionism—the organization
of the unorganized will mean a great surge forward towards the
amalgamation of the existing organizations.

,It will also mean a powerful development of the Labor Party
movement, partly through the increased class consciousness given
to the movement by the addition of the masses of semi-skilled
and unskilled, partly because of the intensiﬁcation of the class
struggle accompanying the organization of the unorganized, and
partly because the increased size of the labor movement will
furnish a better foundation for the Labor Party—-where the unions
are only skeleton in form, the existence of a powerful Labor
Party is almost out of the question.

Also, the very progress of bringing the millions of semi-
skilled and unskilled into the unions will provoke a whole series
of struggles against the employers and will enormously increase

the militancy of the labor movement. The present epoch of mili-
tancy and class conscious development in the British movement
was hastened very much by infusing into" the old conservative
skilled workers’ craft unions many hundreds of thousands of
semi-skilled and unskilled workers. And a similar result will be
produced on the unions  the United States by bringing in the
unskilled. -» T '
Into the Basic Industries.

Aifurther vital consideration is that the organization of the
unorganized masses will tend to revolutionize the labor move-
ment by establishing its foundations in the basic and other im-
portant industries. At the present time the trade unions are
strongest in the lighterindsutries, such as building, printing,
clothing, etc. Where they touch the basic industries, as on the
railroads, in the coal mines, they are either conﬁned largely to
the skilled workers, or their hold on the masses in general is
weak. .
The big industries present a deplorable lack_ of trade’ union
organization: railroads 35%, coal mining 40%, general metal 5%,
general transport 10%, metal mining 5%, steel 3%, textiles 10%,
leather 15%; while practically no organization exists at all in
the meat packing, automobile, electrical supplies, lumber, agri-
cultural machinery, etc. A trade union movement so Weak in the
big and basic industries of the country cannot possibly make an
effective struggle against capitalism. The ﬁrm establish_ment_ of
the unions in these industries by organizing the great masses will
enormously increase the strength of the labor movement and
throw it at the very heart of capitalism. It will imbue the entire
organization with a new understanding and a new ﬁghting spirit.

The organization of the unorganized is of tremendous im-
portance to the left wing. It tends to revolutionize the labor
movement, to make it more responsive to left winglslogans, and
to generally create a more favorable situation in which the left
wing can operate. Moreover, in the organization process, by tak-
ing an active lead in the campaign, the left Wing will win direct
leadership over large sections of the newly organized masses, for
whoever organizes the Workers leads them. It will also give the
left wing invaluable experience in mass work and leadership.

7

E Ml. 

We must realize the Vital importance of the great campaign of
organization and the leading role the left wing has to play in it.

The present period presents an exceptionally favorable time
to bring the unorganized masses into the unions. Industry is
going ahead at a relatively high rate. The workers are bitterly
exploited, their standards of living are not advancing. In fact, in
many industries such as textile, mining, shoe———in spite of the
prosperity of the employers, the workers are facing wage cuts.
’l.‘here is much discontent in their ranks. The situation is ripe
for a great drive for organizaiton. The present period of “pros-
perity” cannot last indefinitely. Already there are signs of its
weakening. We must take the fullest advantage of the situation
now‘. The workers are in a mood to organize. We must take the
lead and show them how.

A Favorable Opportunity.

Failure of the union to strengthen their ranks now by the
inclusion of vast masses of the unorganized, will expose them to
the most deadly dangers in the slack industrial period that is not
far ahead, when the employers will renew’ their “open shop” cam-
paign of destruction against the unions with redoubled vigor.

The Trade Union Educational League is fundamentally cor-
rect when it places as “Point 1” in its Program of Action, the in-
itiation of a general campaign to organize the millions of unor-
ganized workers.

1 Chapter II.
THE LEFT WING MUST DO THE WORK;

HE organization of the unorganized millions of Workers is

primarily the task of the left wing. There is no other section

of the labor movement possessing the necessary courage, energy,

and understanding to carry through this basic work. This is a
prime lesson that T. U. E. L. militants must understand.

The three general groups. in the trade union movement play
essentially the following roles in the gigantic task of organizing
the unorganized masses: The left Wing militantly leads, the pro-
gressives mildly support, and the right Wing opposes. ' p

The left Wing alone has a realization of the tremendous so-
cial signiﬁcance of the organization“of the unorganized. ‘ It speaks
primarily in the name of the unskilled and semi—skilled who make
up the mass on the outside of the unions, and it habitually leads
a militant struggle to unionize them. It is the champion of indus-
trial unionism and the Labor Party, the fate of both of which is
boundup in the general question of organizing the unorganized.
It realizes that only when the great masses are mobilized in the
unions can effective assaults be made against capitalism. Hence,
it is the life of every organizing campaign, and it must be such,
Whether these campaigns are carried on through the medium of
the existing trade unions, or by the launching of new organiza-
tions.

The progressives primarily represent the skilled, and, to a
certain degree, the semi—skilled Workers.’ They usually mildly
favor and support general campaigns", of organization. They
have some appreciation of the imp ’
into the unions, but they haven’t the ﬁﬁcessiiry "understanding and
militancy to do the actual Work. They m‘ust be stimulated int /
action by the left wing.  '

They lack the leadership to map out and carry through the
broad, daring campaigns necessary for the organization of the
masses in American industries. They fear the militant and des—.
