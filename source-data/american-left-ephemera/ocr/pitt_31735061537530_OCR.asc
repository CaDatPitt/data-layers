THE
COMMUNISTWSVV

E REPORT TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, U.S.A.

By Eugene Dennis

 

It is on the basis of this unstable economic picture and the
mounting offensive of big capital that there is an upsurge in the
strike movement, the farm revolt has assumed explosive political
proportions in the Midwest, and a sharp political and agrarian
crisis is unfolding in the Deep South where tenant and share-
cropping farms have decreased by 30 per cent over the past ﬁve
years.

This situation urgently calls for a rounded-out popular eco-
nomic program of struggle, an immediate anti-monopoly program of
action designed to safeguard the pressing economic interests of
the great masses of workers, farmers, Negro people, and small
business—regardless of when the economic crisis develops. And
this program should include concrete proposals for curbing the
monopolies and for providing for the public ownership of a num-
ber of industries, such as in the atomic energy ﬁeld and public
utilities.

THE LABOR MERGER AND POLITICAL ACTION

Now a few words ' regarding the situation in the ranks of
organized labor: the outstanding development in the recent period
is the re-‘uniﬁcation of the two national trade union centers, the
merger of the CIO and AFL. This re-uniﬁcation is a move of great
signiﬁcance despite the fact that it bears many of the halting
and grudging features that have been characteristic of so much
of labor’s leadership in the past period. Basically it represents the
sentiments and pressures of the mass of the membership in the
shops and on the job, and will, in due course, in the process of
struggle, enormously enhance labor’s economic and political strength
and the advancement of its genuine interests.

Already the merger has removed any basis of so-called “legiti-
macy” for conﬂicts be-tween unions in the same industry. While
uniﬁcation remains a slow and uneven process and requires con-
siderable prodding and rank and ﬁle encouragement, nonetheless
it is giving a deﬁnite stimulus to the merger of dual unions in the
same ﬁeld. *

There are also already visible within the AF L-CIO internal
re-groupings and struggles, some based on an unprincipled struggle
for power, but others reﬂecting to'- one degree or anothe-r differences
on vital issues (e.g., Reuther and Meany on India). By avoiding
a factional approach, yet helping to develop movements and ac-

tions around proposals that bear a progressive character, an im-
petus can be given to organizing the unorganized, especially in the
South, and new alliances can be forged that can help shape many
realignments and developments in the merged labor movement in
a positive direction. Recent experiences in the midwest as well as
in New York City indicate what is possible on this score.

Meanwhile, and as a consequence of the merger, the pronounced
upsurge in the ﬁghting spirit and solidarity of the working class
continues, as has been evidenced in the bitter, prolonged strikes
in Westinghouse, Kohler and Republic Aviation. The demands
of the workers have centered not only around wage increases, but
also against speed-up and the intensiﬁcation of labor, and for
increased layoff and fringe beneﬁts, all of which express the work-
ers’ deep feeling of insecurity in regard to the instability of their
jobs.

While the merger has accelerated labor’s independent political
activity and organization in certain respects, on the whole this vital

ﬁeld of lab0r’s activity has been developing very slowly and ir- .

regularly. There has been an increase in the recent period of labor’s
mass lobbying on questions of defense of trade union rights and
social security, civil rights legislation, and in some cases, on farm
legislation—both on a national scale and in a number of states.
There has been increased trade unio-n intervention in the matter
of inﬂuencing the selection of certain major Party candidates
in Illinois and New York, for example, and here and there the Left
is gaining acceptance as labor’s political mobilization expands.

In respect to the struggle for civil rights, a stronger labor-
Negro people’s alliance is emerging, and even top ﬁgures of the
AFL—such as Meany, are feeling compelled to take a more forth-
right position on equal rights. Similarly on the basic issues of civil
liberties, on the Smith Act, and on the question of the State Sedi-
tion Acts, a new political awareness has been noticeable on the part
of sections of labor, especially in Social—Democratic circles.

But in at least two key aspects the independent political ac-
tivity of labor is far from satisfactory and lags dangerously behind
the needs and possibilities of the situation.

First, of course, is on the struggle for peace. Important dif-
ferences are developing between the Reuther forces and Meany,
particularly on such key questions as foreign economic aid and

EH’

  

the role of the neutrals—a point that was dramatized by the re-
cent speeches of Reuther in India at the same time that Meany
pu.blished a lengthy letter in the New York Times sharply denounc-
ing Nehru and neutralism.

It is also true that other international union leaders have raised
their voices from time to time on behalf of various phases of the
struggle for peace—leading ﬁgures of the Machinists, Butchers,
Packinghouse, Hotel and Restaurant, Amalgamated Clothing Work-
ers and of Railway Labor. However, these voices have been muted
in the recent period for fear of coming in conﬂict with Meany
and upsetting the merger. It is entirely possible that as a result
of the position of Reuther, those voices that have spoken out in the
past, will speak out again.

Nonetheless, with the exception of the recent statements of
Reuther, and the position taken by a number of independent un-
ions, few spokesmen and sectors of labor are differentiating them-
selves from the Eisenhower Administratiorfs foreign policy and
voicing criticism of the position of the Democratic high command
for higher military expenditures. '

Secondly: very little is being done to actually crystallize labo‘r’s.
independent political organizations, which are of such exceptional
importance. Only in parts of Michigan and a few other areas are
the AF L-CIO unions building their independent political ma-
chinery—-without which the political activity of the local union
members is either non-existent, or else inevitably gravitates around
the pressing campaign needs of individual pro-labor political figures.
instead of around the all-around interests of labor. Major attention

» should be devoted to bringing about a change in this situation.

 

THE SOUTH AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS

Next, some observations regarding the South and civil rights:
The sharp political struggles developing in the Deep South con--
stitute a key factor in the present political situation. They are ex-
erting a major inﬂuence on national affairs and the elections.
Against the background of the sharpening economic situation in
the South (especially in agriculture) and the new steps to organ-
ize the unorganized, stands on the one side the new Eastland-
]enner-pro-fascist conspiracy against the Supreme Court and the-
Constitution, supported by the new pro-fascist White Citizens

Councils and the nulliﬁcation policy of the State governments.
On the other side, arising out of this new and sharpening situa-
tion, stands a revitalized Negro liberation movement, the upsurge
of which has reached unprecedented proportions especially in
Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina. This movement which
is developing as a_ bro-ad all—inclusive national freedom front, is
backed by a noticeable growth in Negro-white solidarity in various

arts of the country, as well as by concerted economic action on

the part of the Negro working people.

That this new upsurge is not limited to the South is reflected,
among other things, in the growing unity of the Negro people,
north as well as south. It is reflected in the fact that the Negro
workers, encouraged by the Left and assisted by many white
workers, were able to compel the election of two Negro leaders
as vice—presidents of the merged AFL-CIO.

But also the fact is that despite widespread sympathy and con-
siderable support among the white masses, the struggles of the
Negro people are far from receiving the aid and backing they
need and should get from the white masses, and in the first place
from the labor‘ movement. Here is one of the major tasks we must

’ face up to.

Obviously in this broad movement the Left cannot work in the
old way. The advanced workers must not be impatient with the
methods of action frequently adopted, even where they do not
fully agree, as for example the limitations placed by the NAACP
leadership on mass participation and actions in the recent Wash-
ington Civil Rights Mobilization. By its work, by struggle in our
dwelling places and shops, in the neighborhoods and in the mass
organizations, the Left must win the conﬁdence of the Negro people
and their movements on every level. And ‘now, as never before,
one of the major contributions we can make is to help achieve a
ﬁrmer alliance between organized labor and the Negro peo-ple’S.

movement. V n .
Moreover, around the basic issues and struggles which have

come to the fore and have been joined in the Deep South, it is’

essential to recognize that a profound political crisis is developing
in the Democratic Party, and a sharp constitutional crisis is arising
in the nation. Whereas heretofore it had appeared possible that
these irreconcilable differences would be compromised and tem-

11

    

porarily patched up in the Democratic Party nationally in ’56, life
has shown that the opposite may be the case. This situation con-
fronts labor and the Negro people with new opportunities and with

the vital task of inﬂuencing and shaping the development of this
struggle.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEACE

A word on one aspect of the State of the Union and the issue of
peace: The striking successes of the Soviet and Chinese peace
proposals for lessening international tensions, the headway already
made in promoting peaceful negotiations among the Great Powers
in the recent period, and the resulting pressures from such diverse
quarters as France, Scandinavia, and India, for serious steps
towards disarmament—all this has forced the beginning of a certain
“agonizing re-appraisal” in the ranks of Wall Street and its twin
parties. Both the GOP and the Democrats are casting about for a
method of counteracting the recurring Soviet and Chinese pro-
posals for disarmament and for peaceful trade and cultural relations
and economic competition.

Thus far, while acknowledging that the war danger has dimin-
ished and that the arena of East-West conﬂicts is increasingly
shifting to the economic and ideological ﬁelds, both major parties
strive to continue, although in a modiﬁed way, the basic as ects
of monopoly’s cold war program  e., NATO, SEATO, METO,
etc.) The colossal bipartisan arms program (which has even been
increased this year) is a grim reminder of that fact. Yet within
both major parties greater stress is now being laid on a Point Four
program, and in some GOP and Democratic circles, certain voices
are also being raised favoring some initial steps towards partial
disarmament.

But, above and beyond both major parties, a peace demand is
rising at the grass roots, where the myth of the “Soviet menace” is
wearing exceedingly thin, calling for new moves on the part of
the United States to promote East-West trade and to facilitate a
further reduction of war tensions and a halt to the armaments
race, both through direct conferences at the Summit and through
the United Nations. Broad and inﬂuential groups from women’s,
church, farm, youth, and progressive organizations have been call-
ing for concrete steps to effect universal disarmament, and espe-

12

cially for a ban on A and H bombs. And here and there, as we have
noted, inﬂuential voices are being similarly raised from among
the ranks of labor, especially from among the pro-Reuther forces.

In this connection note should be taken of the recently an-
nounced ten point program of aid to underdeveloped countries
put forward by Reuther in the name of the UAWA. This proposal,
which among other things calls for joint action by the USA and
the USSR through the U.N., is based on a concept of peaceful
co—existence and competition between the two social systems and
holds the possibility of strengthening the ﬁght for peace, for help-
ing end the cold War. Objectively, this program is also a platform
of struggle against the Meany anti-Soviet line in the trade unions,
as well as a positive step in the direction of encouraging the pro-
labor Democrats to modify the reactionary or, in some cases,
muddled——course most of them are pursuing on foreign policy.
Here is one issue, but an important one, which, if properly grasped
and supported, can greatly inﬂuence events and help bring a new
perspective in the labor movement based on an active policy of
promoting peaceful co—existence.

Unquestionably, the struggle for a foreign policy based on

’ peaceful negotiations, together with the burning issue of civil rights

and the farm situation, can tip the scales in the November elections.

FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND BILL OF RIGHTS

A few comments on the extent and nature of rnonopolyis re-
pressive drive in our country: Since 1954 the menace of pro-
fascist reaction has receded somewhat. International factors as
well as the election defeats administered to the McCarthyites and
to the Administration in November, 1954, and subsequently some
of the decisions of the Supreme Court, all played a role in this
development.

But underlying all of these factors, and in some respects the
decisive factor, has been a resurgence of" powerful democratic
expressions by the American people. These have been expressed
in numerous activities and declarations—from the recent forthright

. stand by the American Association of University Professors on the

right of Communists to teach, the frank admission by Acheson
of the basic mistake of introducing the Loyalty Oath, the adherence
13

 

  

of Mrs. Roosevelt, Norman Thomas and A.  Muste to the appeal
for amnesty for the Smith Act prisoners, the various positions
taken by the ADA, to the declarations of a host of inﬂuential
trade unions, liberal and progressive organizations condemning
the Smith Act, the Taft-Hartley Act, State Sedition and right-to-
work laws, the McCarran-Walter Act and the McCarran Act.

This powerful democratic current which has been growing in
the past years and to which our Party has made an important con-
tribution, was likewise expressed in the far—reaching denunciation,
from both conservative and liberal quarters, of the Government’s
action in padlocking the oﬂices of the Communist Party and the
Daily Worker.

Yet it would be a mistake to think that the struggle on this
front has been decided. No one can minimize the ultra-reactionary
signiﬁcance of the Eastland-]enner conspiracy and the rise of the
White Citizens movement in the South; or the continuing indict-
ments under the Smith Act, or the unsettled status of the truly
pro-fascist McCa.rran Act.” Nor can one underestimate the latest
assault of the Administration on the Bill of Rights involved in the
padlocking of the Party and Daily Worker, including the grave
handicaps and disabilities which still prevail and prevent us from
operating in a “normal” way, in accord with our constitutional
rights.

No advocate of democratic liberties should forget the notorious
statement issued by Brownell and  Edgar Hoover from the Eisen-
hower summer headquarters at Denver, after the passage of the
so-called Communist Control Act, in which they stated: “We shall
now proceed to utterly destroy the Communist Party.”

It is true the political climate within the country is changing,
but the reactionary objective of monopoly and its political spokes-
men still remains the same. The post—war process of militarization
and of the “creeping” fascization of the State apparatus has not
yet been reversed, but at best, only partially checked or deterred.

Nevertheless, the over-all favorable course of events, not only
internationally, but also to some extent within our country, demon-
strates that united democratic action and popular struggle to up-

hold and defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is bound

* Since this report was delivered, the U.S. Supreme Court returned the case against the
Communist Party under the McCarran Act to the Subversive Activities Control Board for re-
consideration of what it called “t:unted" testimony by informers Matusow, Crouch and Johnson.

WHAT CAN ‘BE D_ONE IN THE '55 ELECTIONS?

A ﬁnal comment on the vital ’56 elections: Insofar as the 19563

Presidential race is concerned, Eisenhower still has a commanding
lead. He enjoys this lead thanks to the position of -the national
leadership of the Democratic Party (assisted by the Meany _forces)

in belittling Geneva and demanding increases in arms expenditures,
to the manifesto of the So'uthern Democrats on interposition and.
nulliﬁcation; to the “moderate” stand ‘of Stevenson on many key

issues; and to the miserable record of the Democratic-controlled

Congress. All this has made it possible for the GOP to parade-
demagogically as the Party of peace and desegregation, and, to

some extent, as the architects of peace-time prosperity.

The outcome of the November contest, however, is by no means.
a foregone conclusion. As the Minnesota and Wisconsin primaries
have revealed, not only Stevenson, but also the GOP, is in trouble.
The prolonged indecision of the Republican high command before
they decided to include Nixon on the GOP ticket points up certain.
qualms that they hold regarding the merchandizing worth of
Nixonism. The Eisenhower veto of the Farm Bill has still further
complicated their problems. And the recent Times survey po'inting
out the failures and the low prestige of the Administration abroad
in the sphere of foreign affairs underscores the GOP’s vulnera-
bility.

The emergence of these and other key issues in the ’56 cam-
paign shows that it is fully possible to forge a democratic front mass
movement and political combination powerful enough to exert tre-
mendous influence on the course of the elections. Given a strong
and posit-ive stand in support of peace and an uncompromising
position on civil rights at the Democratic convention, a ﬁghting
crusade by the candidates, and above all by their supporters in
the labor and people’s movement, a Democratic presidential ticket
and campaign could develop that might alter the entire election
campaign and picture. This is true, particularly, considering the
anti-Cadillac mood and militancy of labor, the powerful anti-
GOP trends in the rural Midwest, the high ﬁghting spirit of the
Negro people, and the general strong peace sentiment and demo-
cratic currents existing in the country.

15

 

 

 

    

As of this moment, the prospects for such a platform, ticket, and
campaign are far from being assured, to say the least. However,
as events of the past few weeks emphasize anew, the situation is
still ﬂuid. Issues and movements are having increasing impact.
The widespread fears evoked by the GOP intention to put Nixon
“one heart-beat away from the White House”; the fact that Steven-
son has been forced to modify his original stand on desegregation,
and now calls for a ban on H bomb tests, as well as endorses the
new UAW proposals for a UN program of aid to the under-developed
countries based on the principles of peaceful co-existence and com-
petition; the challenging nature and the wide popular response to
the Kefauver candidacy; the statement by Clinton Anderson at the
Physicists convention at Rochester suggesting the banning of in-
ter—continental missiles; and the sharp and growing criticism of the
Democratic majority in Congress by the ADA, the AF L-CIO, and
the NAACP—all this indicates that it is not too late nor impossible
for the labor-democratic forces in the nation to inﬂuence the course
and outcome of the elections.

HOW THE PEOPLE CAN WIN

In any event, among the major responsibilities and tasks facing
our,Party and all other progressives ‘in the 1956 elections, I should
now like to emphasize three: .

1) In the existing situation, we and others of the Left asso-
ciate ourselves forthrightly with labor’s desire to oust the Cadillac
Cabinet—to defeat Nixon and the GOP, as well as the Dixiecrats.

Therefore—and in accord with our prime objective of helping
_forge a broad and effective labor-democratic coalition that can
exert growing political influence during and after the elections-
we must now do all in our power .to imbue labor and its demo‘-
cratic allies with the will to win and with the know-how of how
to win.

The only realistic way to ‘prevent a GOP presidential victory,
to defeat the now serious menace of Nixonism, to‘ oust the Cadillac
Cabinet, and to accomplish this worthy objective in the interests
of labor and the people, is: ’

Not only to oppose Benson’s anti-farmer program, McKay’s
give—away of national resources, or Humphrey’s tax relief for the
rich (all of which most northern Democrats do, at least in words),
BUT also to renounce Dulles’ brink-of—war policies; to institute a

16

    

 

(DU)

W

program of expanded East-West trade, peaceful negotiations, con-
crete steps for disarmament and for banning all nuclear weapons;
to repudiate and nullify Brownell and Nixon’s anti-labor attacks
against the UAW, UE, and Mine—Mill; to stop the current Smith
Act, McCarran Act and McCarran-Walter Act prosecutions against
Communists and non—Communist progressives; to inaugurate and
enforce a federal program of civil rights, including adequate pro-
visions to guarantee the right to vote, stringent anti-lynch measures,
and equal rights in education and employment; as well as an ex-
tensive federal program to vastly expand social security, housing,
educational and minimum wage requirements and standards.

In pursuing and promoting this vital objective in the ’56 elec-
tions, and in joining with the majority of the popular forces to
ride herd on the elephant, we Communists and others of the Left
do not intend to tail after the donkey. Moreover, in this crucial
year the Left and progressive forces should recognize that the
keystone of their work should be not only the defeat of the menace
of Nixonisrn and the Dixiecrats. Above all they should help build
election coalitions and political alliances out of which something
substantial and continuing will remain, no matter what the results
of next November. It is on this, rather than on the general merits
of the major parties and candidates that we have differed with some
of our friends of the Left.

2) In line with this, the Left and progressive forces should
focus major attention on the need and possibilities of forging di-
verse labor—Negro-democratic front coalitions and alliances on
congressional and state levels. This is especially urgent in regard
to some 30 to 50 key congressional and senatorial contests where
relatively favorable possibilities exist for defeating various rabid
McCarthyites, Dixiecrats and anti—Ceneva candidates and of electing
certain congressmen who will be for labor, for civil rights and for
peace, including a number of additional Negro representatives,
as well as trade unionists. Such democratic movements, align-
ments, and coalitions can be formed that should be strong enough
to bring more effective pressure to bear on the present session of
Congress, to inﬂuence the course of current events, and to inter-
vene and exert increasing pressure on the next administration and

Congress, Whatever its political complexion and composition

may be.

FOR A NEW POLITICAL ALIGNMENT

3) Simultaneously, we must bring forward much more con-
cretely and systematically the necessity__p-for crystallizing a new
major political alignment in the country.‘ This will ﬁnd ever
greater response among the masses, andjn the ﬁrst place among
the workers, the bulk of the farmers, and the Negro people, who,
while unprepared this election year to break with the two party
system, nevertheless are becoming increasingly dissatisﬁed with both
the Republican and the Democratic Parties; ‘

It should not be forgotten that since 1948, when Truman was
elected on the basis of the many promises made to the workers,
farmers, and the Negro people, there has been the most dramatic
demonstration of how the interests of the people are betrayed
and election promises unfulﬁlled, irrespective of which Party con-
trols the presidency and Congress.

In 1948 the Democrats captured both the presidency and Con-
gress. In 1950 there was a Democratic president and a GOP Con-
gress. In 1952 both the presidency and Congress were in the hands
of the GOP; and since 1954 there has been a GOP president and a
Democratic-controlled Congress. Yet, during all this time, the
Taft-Hartley law remains on the books, and there has not been
a single civil rights bill passed. Practically no social legislation
favorable to the working people has been adopted. The Congres-
sional witch-hunts have continued under both party labels, not
to speak of the continuing colossal arms expenditures, and the
sanction of a series of aggressive military pacts.

But this does not mean that the ﬁght for a major re-alignment
should be limited to mere agitation for a mass labor-farmer party.
In addition to such agitation, which is long overdue, the Left
needs to unfold a bold, practical, and realistic policy which takes
into account the actual situation, the relation of forces, the battles
that the people are ready and willing to engage in, and those forms
and methods of independent political action which already exist.
This means, for one thing, that more attention is required to
help develop the great potential of the Committee on Political
Education—the united national political arm of labor uniting the
PAC, the LLPE, and all their subdivisions in each unio-n, indus-
try, and geographical and political subdivision.

This means, further, that the progressives should not be in-

_%____:——j_,:j——— v --

different to the developing crisis in the Democratic Party. They
should help implement Reuther’s recent declaration that “The
Democrats can’t have the Eastlands and labor too.” And, in con-
junction with other popular forces, they should do all in their power
to help isolate and defeat the Dixiecrats and the northern advo-
cates of “interposition,” “nulliﬁcation,” “gradualism,” and “states’
rights.” All this can be done without fostering any illusions as to
the possibility of converting the Democratic Party into a people’s
party. —

In this struggle the economic and political interests of labor,
the Negro people, and the family-sized farmers are closely inter-
woven, and the unity of these forces and the organization of a
labor-farmer-Negro alliance is paramount. It is out of these strug-
gles, which will markedly inﬂuence the course of the ’56 elections,
that many important political regroupings in and around the Demo-
cratic Party will be advanced and the Dixiecrat-COP strangle-
hold on Congress can be undermined. And this will provide one
of the big answers as to what extent and to what degree certain
sectors of the Democratic Party and its adherents among the masses
will become an integral part of the new anti-monopoly political
alignment that is now in the process of development.

II. A GRITIGAL REVIEW OF THE PARTY’S WORK

Now I would like to brieﬂy, if inadequately, examine the status
and functioning of the Party in the past period, particularly with
an eye to some of our weaknesses and mistakes.

Without doubt, the past period has been the most trying in our
Party’s history, and naturally it has also been one of the most
difficult periods in the life of our country.

During the ﬁrst phase of the cold war, from 1946 to 1951,
our Party, in unison with many non—Communist workers and pro-
gressives, made signiﬁcant contributions in resisting the imperialist
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and U.S. intervention in
China; in opposing the Schwellenbach proposal for outlawing the
CP as well as the pro-fascist Mundt-Nixon Bill; in defending
Willie McGee, the Martinsville Seven, and Mrs. Rosa Lee In-

19

 

 
 

gram; and in actively supporting the big strikes of the miners, and
the nation’s railway, packing, and steel workers.

It is also a matter of fact and a source of pride that during the
most recent period our Party has continued to display great cour-
age and staunchness. Those of us who were deprived of the ability
to actively participate in the work and leadership since July, 1951,
salute all the brave ﬁghters in and around our Party, and particu-
larly our indomitable chairman, Bill Foster, and the‘ other comrades,
who together with him, constituted the national leadership. We
recognize the extraordinary difficulties under which our Party has
had to operate since July, 1951. And we appreciate no less the
loyalty and steadfastness and the many noteworthy contributions
which our Party made in this period, especially to help end the
war in Korea and to turn the tide against McCarthyism, as well as
the orientation towards pursuing a broad and ﬂexible tactical line.

At the same time it is necessary to note that over the past years
the Party has suffered heavy organizational losses and that its po-
litical influence has been lessened in many areas and ﬁelds. Fur-
thermore, while the Party, directly or indirectly, has developed
certain mass activity in the ﬁght for peace, civil rights and civil
liberties, with few exceptions it did not succeed in setting wide
masses into motion. Moreover, it exercised little inﬂuence in most
of the recent strikes and its role in the historic AF L-CIO merger
has been extremely unsatisfactory.

WAS THE DEGREE OF ISOLATION INEVITABLE?

The causes for the Party’s weakened base and its increased
isolation—in some cases relative, in others absolute—are largely
to be found in adverse objective factors. These are a consequence,
in the ﬁrst place, of the sharp, costly, and continuing political at-
tacks and repressions against the Party, the Left wing, and other
democratic forces. Certainly, we mu.st not obscure nor forget
these problems and difficulties and handicaps, including those
which still operate and will continue to plague us for a long time
to come, i.e., the de facto illegalization of the Party in basic in-
dustry and certain other ﬁelds of employment.

But the question arises: was it inevitable, in View of the post-
war growth of monopoly reaction in the country, that the Party
should become so isolated? Or, so to say: was it impossible, even
20 '

 

 

  

under conditions of rising pro-fascist reaction in the USA, for the
working class vanguard to‘ maintain and develop much broader
and more effective mass ties and political inﬂuence? The answer
must be: No. For as experience has shown, there are certain
situations and areas in our country where we have been able to
surmount the sharp and recurring attacks of the enemy and have
continued to exert appreciable mass political inﬂuence.

What are some of the subjective factors, weaknesses, errors,
which made it easier for the monopolists and their political repre-
sentatives to weaken and isolate us over the past years, especially
since the late ’40’s and even more so after 1951?

Obviously during this period of heightened post-war reaction, all
of the basic, deep—seated and long-standing weaknesses and short-
comings of the Party came home to roost with a vengeance. This
is particularly true in respect to the Party’s historic neglect of mass
work in most of the decisive unions of the AF L and among some
of the mostimportant CIO unions; to the fact that over the past
decade our Party has been afﬂicted with a deeply—ingrained Left
sectarian approach to united front relationships and tactics, and
frequently became a prisoner of Left wing centers in the peace,
Negro people’s_, civil liberties, and trade union movements; and to
the strong and persistent tendency in the Party to apply the experi-
ences of other parties and the science of Marxism in a mechanical
and doctrinaire ,fashion—all of which inadvertently gave aid and
comfort to the slander that we are “foreign agents.”

These decades-old weaknesses made it more diﬂicult for our
Party to most effectively withstand monopoly’s sharpened post-
war oifensive and to retain—let alone expand—our mass ties and
political inﬂuence under conditions of severe repression.

Yet we cannot ascribe the negative aspects of the Party’s work
in the recent period merely, or chieﬂy, to the general shortcomings
which we inherited from the past, or even to the mistakes that we
ourselves made in previous periods. To understand where we erred
in the post-war situation, and why, we need to examine, ﬁrst of all,
the erroneous judgments and tactical mistakes of this speciﬁc pe-
riod in the context of the given time, place, and concrete circum-
stances. f

It is from this viewpoint that I would now like to indicate
brieﬂy what seems to me to have been some errors of judgment

21

    

in our political estimate at various moments. Then, a little farther
on, I wish to note certain tactical errors which flowed from, or were
made in connection with, that which was one—sided and faulty
in certain analyses.

POLICIES IN THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE

Take, for example, the Party’s estimate of the new danger
of war that arose after the end of World War II. By and large,
the general conclusions we drew at the" 1945 convention regarding
the aggressive post-war role of American imperialism, and the
main political line we projected, have proved correct. The devel-
opment and course of Wall Street’s cold war, interspersed with the
hot war in Korea, aﬂirm this beyond question.

At the same time, it must be admitted that there have been not
a few defects and some errors in estimating given moments and
in developing an effective tactical line in the struggle for peace.
While we repeatedly asserted that World War III is not inevitable,
the fact is that we frequently tended to evaluate certain war
preparations and threats of Washington as if a new world war was
.not only possible—but almost imminent. This was so at various in-
tervals in 1948-49, during one phase of the war in Korea, and again
in 1954, around the time of the conference on Indo-China.

It should be stated here that those who argued in the past,
or on the basis of the new and changed world situation now un-
folding, that there never was nor is a war danger—are wrong.
Their view that peace is “inevitable” was and is no less harmful
than the view that war is inevitable. In both cases the Party
and the people are lulled into passivity and fatalism, instead of
facing" up to the realities of the situation, to organizing and mo-
bilizing the broadest sectors of the people in the struggle for
peace.

Our past errors arose, in good part, from the fact that while
resolutely opposing Wall Street’s expansionist program and belli-
cose policies, we did not consistently and convincingly show the
growing disparity between the imperialist aims of U.S. monopoly
and its inability to realize its predatory objectives. Also, in this
connection, we did not suﬂiciently emphasize and understand the
growing rivalries and conﬂicts between the major impe-
rialist powers, nor did we properly assess the sharpening inner

differences and contradictions within monopoly capital in the
USA and how to‘ take advantage of this in order to build a broader
peace movement.

Despite our statements regarding the profound world signi-
ﬁcance of the armistice in Korea and the negotiated peace agree-
ment in Indo-China, our Party did not draw the full conclusions
from the big and favorable changes in international relations which
these events signalized. Otherwise how can we explain that in
1954 the Party’s program“ coupled its observation that Wall Street
had “lost the immediate opportunities to launch an anti-Soviet
war” with the prediction that in 1954 the country was confronted
with an immediate war threat?

Certainly not unﬁl the Bandung Conference did the Party ap-
preciate the new role of the peoples of Asia and Africa and the
unprecedented and signiﬁcant role that most ~of the nations of
these areas are now playing in the ﬁght for peace. Also it must
be said that for some time up to the Geneva Summit meeting-
including the immediate preceding period—there were strong ten-
dencies to underestimate the ability of the peoples to compel the
Eisenhower Administration, on the basis of the new and more
favorable world relationship of forces and the powerful peace
sentiment in the U.S., to enter into peaceful negotiations with the
“East.”

The fact is that even as late as the middle of 1955 our Party
still found the thinking of many in its ranks based on an analysis
which saw the only major difference in the camp of U.S. mo-
nopoly capital as that between “those who want war now, and those
who want war when ready.” Needless to say, such an estimate
made it diﬂicult to convince masses of the possibility of achieving,
under the existing conditions, a protracted period of peaceful

co-existence.
ESTIMATE OF THE FASCIST DANGER

There is no doubt that errors in judgment and analysis as re-
ards the war danger also at times inﬂuenced the Party’s estimate
of the fascist danger. Starting with the late 1940’s, our Party cor-
rectly emphasized that monopoly capital—in pursuance of its
“American Century” policy and its related war preparations, and,

“ The American Way to Iobr, Peace, Equal Right: and Democracy. New Century Publishers,
New York. Sc.
23

 

in order to cope with the strong peace and anti-fascist sentiments
of the American people, more and more had recourse to repres-
sive and pro-fascist measures. '

And during 1950-51, in connection with the war in Korea, the
enactment of the McCarran Act and the Vinson decision, coupled
with the loyalty oaths and the Taft-Hartley Act—we Communists
correctly pointed out that the danger of fascism was increasing.
But even then, and since 1951, more than once the Party over-
estimated the scope, level, and tempo of development of the process
of fascization underway. For instance, in our statement on June
4, 1951, while we stressed that World War III and fascism were
not inevitable, actually we placed things as being a few minutes
before midnight. Certainly, the statement of the National Com-

 

mittee that the Vinson Decision signiﬁed “a wholly new situation” '

was open to misinterpretation.

And some of the organizational steps the Party took at the time
were bound to disorient many, as indeed they did. Among other
things, too, there was a tendency to equate the semi-illegaliza-
tion of the Party with the beginning, or the first stage, of fascism.
At the same time there arose a gross underestimation of the neces-
sity and possibilities to struggle to restore and maintain the legality
of the party. .

Clearly, it was imperative in 1950-52-—when the war in Korea
was raging, when the McCarran Act was adopted, when the Vin-
con Decision came down, that then, as at all times, the Party en-

sure its ability to function under all conditions despite the un-

constitutional curbs upon its wo'rking—class political activities. But
it did not ﬂow from this, nor was it correct, that the Party take
such drastic measures as it did in regard to most of its leadership.
Certainly it was incorrect to have maintained this system of lead-
ership, without any modiﬁcation, for such a prolonged period.
Equally, it was wrong that the‘ Party adopted such arbitrary and
undemocratic measures as it did in 1951 in the process of verifying
the Party cadre and membership—measures, by the way, that re-

duced the Party membership by one-third.

Moreover, it was not correct, and in fact was very harmful,
that for some time after 1951 the Party abandoned virtually all

of its legal positions and avenues for open mass work; and also

that until quite recently it did not raise the question of defend-

24

 

ing the Party and its constitutional liberties to the level of a major
task deserving top priority. Let it be borne in mind that this was
no small partisan question, but one which adversely affected all of
our united front relationships and exerted a negative inﬂuence
on the course of the anti-McCarthyite struggle. Even now, I
would stress, we are only beginning to change this unfortunate
state of affairs and to place the question of developing the broad-
est united front defense of the First Amendment as a fundamental
national and democratic task.

In order to establish the fullest clarity o-n this point, it would be
well, at this juncture, to’ consider some aspects of the 1954 Pro-
gram. There is no doubt that one of the most important positive
contributions of the Party’s Program was the sharpness with which
it raised the danger of McCarthyism and the impact it had among
the masses in facilitating the important rebuffs the McCarthyites
received inpthe 1954 elections. But the program contained some
errors which should be brought to‘ light.

Undeniably, the danger of McCarthyism became most acute
in the period of the sharpest world tensions, especially during
the Korean war. But was it correct to conclude, as the Program
did, that with the easing of the international situation this danger
inevitably was bound to become more menacing? It is true, of
course, that with every defeat and setback suffered by U.S. im-
perialism, the most chauvinist and ultra-reactionary circles of mo-
nopoly lose their heads, become more adventurist, and lead not
from positions of strength but from positions of desperation. This
holds true for all aspects of policy—foreign and domestic.

But it is also true that defeats and setbacks compel major
sectors of Big Business, including very reactionary circles, to re-
appraise their tactics, methods, and timing. And, as now, they seek
to maneuver and draw back from, or postpone, the biggest of
all gambles. Moreover, it is likewise a_ fact that in such situations,
as developed after Korea and Indo-China, the popular forces ac-
quire greater self-conﬁdence and offer greater resistance to the
offensive of monopoly in all spheres, including on the home front.

It would appear that a primary factor in the analysis set forth
in the program as to why the danger of McCarthyism was supposed
to become sharper as a result of certain favorable international
developments was because of the view prevalent in 1954 regarding

25

    

  

an early and major economic crisis. I shall deal with this later,
though here I would remark p-arenthetically that unquestionably,
the onset of a major cyclical crisis will impel important sectors of
monopoly to seek a fascist solution of the crisis. Undoubtedly,
too, there will be big class struggles. But it is far from inevitable
that the coming crisis—whenever it matures—will usher in a revo-
lutionary situation. U.S. monopoly is still able to maneuver, to‘ grant
certain concessions to the masses, and it is also realistic to assume
that in the course of the sharpening struggles that will unfold,
it is deﬁnitely possible for the popular masses to prevent the rul-
ing monopolies from establishing their open and most reactionary
dictatorship.

I would also note in passing that even in mid-1954 it was not
correct tolump the Eisenhower forces and McCarthyism to-gether.
Even then the struggle within the ranks of Big Cap-ital and be-
tween the different wings of the GOP—notwithstanding all its
limitations—was such that it was wrong to treat Eisenhower and
McCarthy as if the Administration and the GOP were one homo-
geneous grouping. It was also incorrect to contend that the major
differences within monopoly cap-ital would be reﬂected primarily
through only one of the two major~parties. Nor was it correct to
equate the over-all danger of fascism with the acute menace of
McCarthyism. For McCarthyism was, and is, only one manifestation
of the fascist danger—although at times, the gravest danger.

We should also have given, and must now give, more attention
to the sinister role of the Eastlands, McClellans, Walters, etc.,
and of the GOP McCarthyites in white collars, z'.e., the Nixons and
Brownells. And we should have analyzed more basically, and
must still do so, the relation between the post-war rise of the
fascist danger and the post-war growth of state monopoly capital
and the accompanying processes of the fascization of the state
apparatus and the militarization of the country. This began under
the Truman Administration and has been carried forward under
the Eisenhower Administration and is today, at best, only partially
checked. '

In addition to the sectarian inﬂuences in our estimate of the
fascist danger connected with ‘certain errors in estimating the war
danger and the imminence of a cyclical economic crisis, etc., I
also believe that in the struggle against the menace of fascism,

 

we under-estimated in practice the nationwide, mass strength of
American democratic traditions, sentiments, and processes. I be-
lieve we underplayed the latent power and mass ﬁghting resistance,
as well as the unique role of the trade unions—and this despite
the Meanys. Also I believe we overlooked the speciﬁc role of the
struggles between and within the two major parties—as well as
certain peculiarities of our governmental structure—which operate,
indirectly, as a certain impediment to the drive of the most reaction-
ary monopoly circles towards establishing a full-ﬂedged police state
system. Likewise, I believe we seriously underestimated the salu-
tary effects of world democratic opinion, including the favorable
changes in international relations, on the domestic situation.

In saying all this, it is necessary to repeat, that despite the re-
cent relaxation of international tensions, and notwithstanding the
very important rebuffs and partial checks given to Knowland,
Nixon, Dulles, Eastland and the McCarthyites, the danger of fas-
cism still exists and is far from liquidated. '

ON IMMINENCE OF ECONOMIC CRISIS

The third and last question I wish to touch concerning certain
errors in analysis and judgment which we have made since 1945
is our repeated over-estimation of the imminence of a new cyclical
economic crisis.

During 1945 and again in 1949, our Party—basing itself on a one-
sided estimate of economic data and factors, and applying the
Marxist theory on economic crisis dogmatically—wrongly con-
cluded that a major economic crisis was then imminent.

In connection with the 1958-54 decline, we again erroneously
evaluated the course of the economic development and perspec-
tives. This view also found expression in the Party’s 1954 Pro-
gram which considered that the decline would inevitably give rise
to a major economic depression in 1955-56.

While taking note of the past role of colossal arms expenditures
in delaying the outbreak of the long deferred cyclical economic
crisis, this analysis minimized the current economic effects of the
continuing arms program, as well as overlooked other factors of the
economic picture—including the extent and effects of ﬁxed capital
investments and of the level of commercial and residential con-
struction; the scope of unsatisﬁed or “pent up” consumer demand,

and the temporary mitigating role of government regulated con-
sumer credits and of the goVernment’s tax program (rebates,
amortization, lower excess proﬁts); as well as the possibility of fur-
ther technical advance in some sectors of the economy.

This faulty analysis, like those of the previous period (1945-
49), was very harmful. It caused us to exaggerate the process of
radicalization of the masses and diverted the Party from advancing
or properly stressing certain concrete economic and political
demands then and now confronting the masses, irrespective of
exactly when a major economic crisis develops. It placed exag-
gerated emphasis on converting government subsidized or pri-
vately—owned facilities engaged in arms production to peacetime
production, and by-passed the pressing need of nationalizing
certain industries. It adversely affected our tactical line generally,
and especially our united front relations and work in the trade
u.nions. Above all, this analysis of the economic situation led the
Party to consider that in 1956 there would be a full—blown economic
crisis, which in turn would confront the country with the imme-
diate threat of fascism and war.

One of the lessons that has to be learned from these repeated
mistakes in the last decade—I do not speak of previous periods-
is the necessity to judge economic and politicalfacts and trends
factually and objectively, not to be swayed by other opinions,
including those of diverse Marxist economists who have not made
a thorough study of all the economic factors and trends in the
United States, and to develop our theoretical work on economic
questions” to the high level it merits.

THE LEFT AND THE SPLIT IN THE CIO

Now I wish to pass on and deal with a couple of tactical mis-
takes, which were directly connected at times and to one degree
or another, with the errors in judgment and analysis which our
Party made in respect to the war danger, the fascist danger, and
the economic situation; and which in turn further aggravated
and contributed to our Party’s weaknesses and isolation.

While the advanced workers opposed and resisted the expul-
sion of the Left-led unions from the CIO, they did not wage an
all—out ideological, political and organizational ﬁght either to try
to prevent this split in labor’s ranks, or to heal this damaging

28

 

 

breach in the trade union movement as soon as possible after the
expulsions had taken p-lace. Prior to the exp-ulsions, the Left ap-
proached the struggle in the labor movement against the Marshall
Plan and the Truman Doctrine as if war was virtually around the
corner. And the Party compounded this mistake by continuing
a very harmful, untenable, and sectarian policy. We developed
the struggle for peace in the trade union movement in a doctrinaire
and inﬂexible manner, not taking into account the level of under-
standing of the workers. Furthermore, we made foreign policy
issues the acid test of all united front relationships, and neglected
the possibility of maintaining certain left-center coalitions on other
important issues, including key economic questions.

The advanced sector of the Left never learned how to combine
its own principled and correct position on a number of these ques-
tions with the necessity to follow a ﬂexible tactic in the trade union
movement, "even as some of the experiences of the French and
Italian Marxists showed was possible and necessary in the CGT
and ICL. ,

After the expulsions of the eleven national unions from the CIO,
the left did not fully appreciate the gravity and consequences of
what was then taking place; and on more than one occasion, the
advanced workers continued to press for the adoption of certain
sectarian policies in the unions which aggravated the sharp breaks
and ruptures that developed between the Left and diverse Center
forces.

During this period, the Left failed to estimate correctly the
relation of forces in the labor movement. It did not suﬂiciently
see the ebb and ﬂow of the movement. It tended to exaggerate
its strength in the CIO. It did not sufficiently realize that much
of its mass inﬂuence derived from its participation in broad left-
center coalitions.

Failure of the Left leaders and of the Party to recognize these
facts of life and to seriously re-examine the new relation of forces
was a factor in all the sectarian errors made and contributed to
weakening Left-center coalition relations.

Some comrades may ask: What is all the commotio-n about?
Could anyone have guaranteed that the split in the CIO could have
been avoided? This is not the question. The real question is: did we
do everything possible to prevent the split? Did we work in a

29

2
2
E
2

   

manner and pursue such policies that would make it more difficult
for the split to occur? To this, we must answer: No.

The split in the CIO was precipitated through a number of issues
on which the Left could have maneuvered and reacted more
ﬂexibly. But the Left’s ﬁghtback policy suffered from all the sec-
tarian tendencies that hampered its united front work in the
mass trade unions led by the more conservative and Right-wing
reformist and Social Democratic leaders. Moreover, the split was,
in fact, already prepared and under way, when the Left allowed it-
self to be isolated and defeated through the break-up of various
Left-center coalitions in a number of the CIO unions where the
Left-progressives were strong. Certainly, the situation in the
N.M.U., the Transport Workers and District No. 65 come to
‘mind.

A contributing factor to the split in the CIO, the slowness in
taking measures to try to overcome this division—was no doubt
the practical abandonment of the Left’s initiative in the ﬁght for
"trade union unity. This went hand in hand with speculation in cer-
tain quarters about the desirability of eventually establishing a
“third” labor federation. Already in the late ’40’s, there was an open
expression that under the existing circumstances (the war danger,
the menace of fascism, the going over of most of the AFL and CIO
leaders to support of the cold war, etc. ), trade union unity and united
labor action would be against the interests of the workers. Instead
-of becoming the champions of trade union unity, and thus coming
closer to the rank and file and certain leaders of the AFL and
CIO and helping to set the workers and their local organizations
in motion, the negative attitude of many Party leaders, including
various trade union cadres, towards labor unity made it easier
for the reformist trade union leaders to‘ isolate the Left still fur-
ther.

Moreover, the extremely harmful nature of this anti-unity ap-
proach can be seen in the subsequent fact, that, in the main, the
advanced workers did not play an active and inﬂuential role in
helping to bring about the merger of the AFL and CIO. Even
after organic unity became a reality, a section of the Left, inclu-
sive of certain Party forces, failed to grasp the very positive achieve-
ment that this historic step represented, and kept pointing to the
dangers, and to the obvious fact that the labor reformists at the

30

 

 

head of AFL and CIO remained reformists. And some went so
far as to assert that the AFL and CIO were “labor fronts,” and
that the merger was engineered by the State Department.

What they did not see is that labor unity—far from being a plot
on the part of Big Business in pursuance of its general policies
and its foreign policy speciﬁcally—was, in fact, spurred on as a
result of the growing attacks on the part of the employers. The
merger reﬂected, to one degree or another, the desires and pressures
of the rank and file to achieve greater unity and strength in the
big economic and political struggles that the workers were being
compelled to wage.

ELECTORAL POLICY IN '48

There is, ‘too, the question of the formation of the Progressive
Party in 1948, which also widened the cleavage in the CIO and
weakened the ties between the Leftwing and the mainstream of the
labor movement. At this point I do not want to‘ argue Whether
or not an independent peace ticket should have been entered
and developed in the ’48 elections. Personally, I believe it would
have been correct and I consider that both the objective conditions
and certain subjective factors warranted such a bold move. Cer-
tainly, the impact of Wallace’s break with the Administration over
the Truman Doctrine and the widespread resentment in labor’s
ranks over the strike-breaking role of the Administration in the
miners’ and railwaymen’s strike—gave a big impetus in 1947 and
early ’48 to the progressive trend towards independent political
action and for organizing an independent presidential ticket in op-
position to the Truman and Dewey candidacies and bipartisan war
program. However, I also believe it was erroneous and harmful
to support the formation of the P.P. as a third party, and not to
have taken into account certain changes in the electoral situation
which developed in the ﬁnal months of the campaign. Insofar
as the position of our Party on the question is concerned, I assume
a particular responsibility.

But the fact remains that whether the Progressive Party came
on the electoral scene as a party or a ticket, life—and the election
returns in November, 1948—clearly revealed that the PP had no
promising future in the political life of the country. Not to recognize
this then, and to entertain the illusion that the contrary might be

31

  

the case, was not only a mistaken political judgment "per se, but
also made it increasingly diflicult ‘for the Left to re-orient and to
forge the broad democratic people’s coalition which it advocated.

While the Party leadership modiﬁed its position on this ques-
tion in 1949 and ’50, as in the Lehman-Dulles senatorial contest-
we did not draw all the conclusions from our mistakes, did not
place the matter for deﬁnitive correction in the 1950 elections.
While the 1952 Draft resolution attempted to do this, sectarian
attitudes in the leadership and in the Party blunted the necessary
corrections in the Resolution as ﬁnally adopted. Consequently,
remnants of this dual policy were expressed in some of the official
reports at the August 1954 national election conference, and are
still to be found in the practical work of some Party organizations.

PERSPECTIVES OF THE PARTY PROGRAM

But, on the whole, the policy projected for the 1954 elections
represented a turn as far as our electoral policy is concerned. The
tactical line set forth in the 1954 Program was a major contribution
designed to re-orient the Party and the whole Left to restore and
extend our mass ties and inﬂuence in the mainstream of the labor
and people’s movements. There is no doubt that the Party Program
played a very positive role in the 1954 elections and in helping
turn the tide against McCarthyism.

It is precisely because of this positive estimate of the role
of the Program in 1954, and the fact that it was so widely dis-
tributed under extremely difﬁcult conditions, that it is necessary
to take note of certain errors and wrong analyses that are to be
found in the Program, not the least in respect to what was en-
visioned for 1956..

The Program approached 1956 as the ﬁrst of three stages of the
tactical and strategic course projected to check and defeat extreme
reaction and to effect the transition from a people’s anti-trust
government to socialism. The Program contended that the Eisen-
hower Administration represented an immediate threat of fascism
and war and that it must and could be replaced by a non—Truman

p-e Democratic Administration, resting on a broad coalition,
capable of blocking the immediate danger of war and fascism, and
of moving forward from where the New Deal left off.

It is true that the Eisenhower Administration, from its incep-

32

 

 

xv

Fl‘ KU KIJ

tion, pursued an aggressive, imperialist course that aggravated
the war danger, especially in the Far East, and also that in ’53
and early ’54, it appeased McCarthy and fostered certain aspects of
McCarthyism (e.g., Brownell’s anti-subversion program and at-
tacks on Truman). Hence, it was necessary, particularly in ’54,
to boldly advance the taskpof defeating this reactionary Adminis-
tration, popularly known as the Cadillac Cabinet.

But in raising this worthy objective, the Program made a num-
ber of mistaken judgments by inferring that ’56 offered an alter-
native between war and fascism under the GOP and a new New
Deal under the Democrats. It minimized the need and possibility
of exerting mass pressure upon the Eisenhower Administration
and inﬂ'u.encing governmental policy. Yet, as we know, the Eisen-
hower Administration was compelled to negotiate an armistice
in Korea, to break with McCarthy and to go to Geneva. The
Program further underestimated the sharp inner contradictions
and differences then taking place within Big Business circles over
McCarthyism and the methods and tactics of implementing Wall
Street’s foreign policy, as well as erroneously concluded that the
less aggressive circles of Big Capital would align themselves with
and express their position through only one of the major p-arties,
z'.e., supposedly through the Democratic Party.

Moreover, the outlook projected for ’56 estimated the relation-
ship of class forces within and around the Democratic Party un-
realistically, including the role of the key subjective factors. In
fact, the illusionary prognosis of the Program for ’56 relied primarily
on the emergence of a devastating economic crisis and mass spon-
taneity to bring about a new political alignment and popular
majority in the country.

Not until mid-’55 was this wrong orientation more or less
rectified. Meanwhile, and among other things, the course projected
in the Program for ’56 fostered an attitude that it was necessary
to defeat the GOP at all costs, and this in turn retarded the efforts
of the Left to inﬂuence the course of the Administration and to
most effectively inﬂuence developments in and around important
sectors of the Democratic Party on key issues.

If it is true that what the Program projected for ’56 (the ﬁrst
phase of the three stage strategy outlined in the Program as the
American Road to Socialism) was, and is, somewhat faulty, it is

33

no less true that the three stages .concept,of, the road to socialism
as a whole suffers from certain seriousdefects and is, to say the
least, very schematic.

OTHER POLITICAL AND TACTICAL ERRORS

Time does not permit consideration of a number of other seri-
ous political and tactical mistakes that our Party made in the past
period. For instance, there was and is the serious tailing, lagging
behind, marked by Right opportunist passivity, in the struggle for
Negro rights; as well as the pronounced Left sectarian attitudes
displayed towards the NAACP and the Negro church movement;
plus the errors made in the internal campaign against white
chauvinism in 1949-53 which distorted and hampered the un-
folding of the necessary mass struggle against the pernicious inﬂu-
ence and practices of white chauvinism.

Also, mention should be made of the fact that in the efforts
of the Party leadership to re-orient the Party after 1952, to bring
the full weight and inﬂuence of the Left into the mainstream of
the labor and people’s movements, this generally correct orientation
was resisted and carried out clumsily and sometimes in a very
sectarian manner.

Very little attention was given to maintaining and extending
the Party’s ties with diverse, honest, and inﬂuential Left-progressive
non-party forces as we effected the change in tactics. And not
everywhere did the Party appreciate that while the course of events
constantly makes it necessary to review policies and organizations,
including the status and role of various Left “centers,” it is one
thing to help transform, merge, or dissolve this or that organiza-
tion that may have outlived its usefulness. But it is an entirely
different matter to do this unilaterally, without consultation with
non-party progressives, or to negate the role of the Left wing and
to weaken one’s relations with diverse progressive forces on the
Left, even if they don’t see eye to eye with us on-all questions.

This partial consideration of some aspects of the Party’s work
and policies over the past period, particularly in respect to certain
of our mistakes, is, at best, very fragmentary and inadequate. The
ensuing discussions in the N. C. will undoubtedly supplement
and modify some of the tentative observations set forth. Obviously,
too, a rounded out and a more definitive evaluation of the past

34

 

 

decade, especially in regard to both the positive and negative sides
of our Party’s role, will have to await the collective judgment of
our entire Party, above all at our next convention.

When the over-all assessment is ﬁnally made, I am certain that
in addition to critically estimating our errors and weaknesses, as is
incumbent on us at this juncture, the Party will not overlook the
positive and some of the outstanding features in our work in this
period, i.e., the steadfastness of the Party in face of continuing
repressions; the steeling and growing maturity of our membership
and leadership, and the fact that not only did our Party ﬁrmly
oppose and resist Wall Street’s post-war imperialist offensive, but
also it made a number of sterling contributions which encouraged,
alerted, and helped mobilize growing sectors of the American peo-
ple to give battle to the McCarthyites, the Dixiecrats, and the
atomaniacs.

MAIN CHARACTER OF THE ERRORS: LEFT SECTARIANISM

Be this as it may, from even a preliminary examination of the
past period, it is amply clear that whatever right opportunist ten-
dencies were manifested reflecting the prevalent opportunism in
the labor movement—nevertheless most of the erroneous analyses
and tactical mistakes our Party has made since 1945 have been
chieﬂy of a Left sectarian character. If we don’t understand this,
we will understand nothing about one of the main causes and

V effects of our isolation in this period". We would be unable to

draw the necessary conclusions to enable our Party to move for-
ward and exercise the great political and organizational initiative
and leadership of which it is fully capable——and which the times
call for and make feasible.

At this point it would be in place to‘ consider, even if only in
passing, why did it take so long for our Party to draw the afore-
mentioned lessons from its past experiences and activity? This
question is very much in order, not the least because during the
late ’40’s we recognized and endeavored to correct some of the
mistakes of that period; and subsequently, especially after the ’52
elections, the Party leadership made a big effort to re-orient the
Party and pursue a broader and more flexible tactical line.

Among the reasons, perhaps the following have some bearing:

1) Operating under great external pressures and difficulties and

 

 

in our determination to give no quarter to the offensive of monopoly
reaction, and to move to the counter—attack—we frequently became
impatient and forgot that it is the task of the vanguard to lead
and mobilize broad masses; and that the independent activity of
the vanguard and its supporters, no matter how brave and heroic,
can never be a substitute for the concerted activity of the masses
and their decisive organizations.

2) Because of our costly experience with Browder revisionism,
in the early post-war years we were prone to concentrate our main
ﬁre against Right opportunism. Subsequently, and as the Left
danger in our ranks became ever more pronounced, many tended

' to blunt our struggle against it by waging a “balanced” struggle

on two fronts, an “even-handed” struggle against both Right and
Left opportunism.

3) It is true that we improved the collective leadership in our
Party following the emergency convention of ’-45, consulted fre-
quently with the leading Party active in varied ﬁelds, and made
certain headway in developing a measure of criticism and self-
criticism. But the facts are that as the attacks on our Party
mounted and the unity of the Party itself was at stake, sharp
political differences which arose in the leadership were often
temporized and left unresolved for long periods, and inner-Party
democracy and the corrective inﬂuence of the collective views. of
the Party membership and sympathizers was narrowed.

COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND INNER-PARTY DEMOCRACY ‘

And in the more recent years when the Party leadership was
dispersed and the Party as a whole worked under the most trying
and complex conditions—collective leadership and inner-Party
democracy became even more severely hampered and distorted,
particularly as sectors of the leadership- on all levels were sorely
restricted in their relationships‘ with many of our trade union and
Negro cadres and members, not to speak of with non—Party masses.
In such circumstances, collective leadership- in formulating policy,
and the collective process of clarifying and correcting errors and
mistakes, especially those of long standing, became more difﬁcult
and protracted. _

One of the central conclusions our Party and the N. C. must
draw from this situation, and one of the main pre—requisites for

36

rectifying these and other mistakes, is that we must take decisive
measures to widen our contacts and exchange opinions regularly
with non-party masses and likewise ensure that collective leader-
ship and responsibility is deve].op-ed continuously throughout our
Party on the widest possible basis.

We must ﬁnd the ways and means, whatever the objective con-
ditions, to confer with, listen to, and jointly hammer out all major
policy and tactical questions in consultation’ with broader circles
of Party and non—Party leaders and masses.

This essential procedure and practice needs to be accompanied
by a systematic development, on all levels of the Party, of genuine
and deep-going criticism and self-criticism, of correction and self-
correction—both by the Party collective and by individual Party
leaders and members. In creating the conditions for the freest
expression of criticism of the Party’s work on all levels, we then
have the right to expect and demand from every Party member
and every Party leader, on all levels, that each and every one
of us start with a deep—going self-critical examination of our own
mistakes and a frank facing up to the question of what each of
us have done to help improve and advance the work of the Party.

What I would particularly like to emphasize is not merely the
imperative necessity of ensuring that democratic centralism be-
come a “two-way street,” but that we focus special attention on
creating an atmosphere in our Party where individual leaders and
members feel free to dissent from the majority and to submit al-
ternative and “unorthodox” policies or proposals.

The only restraint or limits the Party should place on indi-
viduals and a minority is that they submit to the collective judg-
ment and decisions of the majority, and that in the process of free
and critical discussion, the Party is not turned into a mere debat-
ing society or used as a forum for propagating bourgeois ideas.

If we can achieve this, we will add something new and healthy
and constructive to our whole concept and practice of criticism
and self-criticism, of inner-party democracy and collective leader-
ship. As a consequence, Party unity and discipline will be re-
inforced, will become an actuality, not ‘a formality, and the Party
will be strengthened, will earn the conﬁdence of wide masses,
and its political inﬂuence will grow.

PIIBLISHEIVS NOTE

THIS PAMPHLET contains the complete text of the report de-
livered by Eugene Dennis, on behalf of the Communist Party’s
National Board, to‘ the enlarged meeting of its National Commit-
tee, held in New York City, April 28-May 1, 1956. The report was
approved by the National Committee.

The report begins with the remark: “Five years have gone by
since the last full meeting of our National Committee.” During
those years, Dennis and six other members of the National Com-
mittee were serving 5-year sentences in jail under the Smith Act.
Others are either currently in jail, out on appeal, or on trial. Thus,
this meeting was “full” only in a relative sense and was enlarged
by the participation of a number of co-workers of. the National
Committee. Mr. Dennis’ report, dealing with the general problems
and tasks confronting the American people and his Party, together
with the reports of Max Weiss, the Party’s Educational Director,
on the signiﬁcance of the recent XXth Congress of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union, and of Claude Lightfoot, Chairman
of the Illinois Communist Party, dealing with the 1956 elections,
constitute the position presented by the Communist Party on key
issues of the day for discussion by its membership.

In setting forth their point of view, Mr. Dennis, his co-reporters
and the Communist National Committee solicit comment, sug-
gestions and criticism from members of the Party as well as the
general public. Communications should be addressed to: Discus-
sion Committee, P.O. Box 87, Cooper Station, New York 3, N. Y.

“Our American Communist Party, guided by its social-
ist principles and scientiﬁc outlook, is going to take a
new look at all problems confronting our nation and our
people.”

III. TASKS AIIII PEIISPEGTIVES

The big and pressing question is—what is required today to
enable our Party to measure up to its gigantic responsibilities in
this election year of great decision, and to help-the Party break
out of its relative isolation?

Obviously, there is no simple answer. The road ahead is not an
easy one. Together with developing inner-Party democracy to the
maximum and mapping out correct policies, we must make a
more determined effort to go among the people and participate
more effectively in their mass activity and movements. There is
no therapy like mass work and struggle.

We must also take a fresh look at and help solve many of the
organizational problems facing our Party, especially those con-
fronting our membership in the shops and mass organizations.
These and many other questions have to be hammered out col-
lectively and ﬁrm decisions taken to guarantee correct policies
and correct leadership.

Here I wish to stress, if only in a capsule fashion, a few of
the most important political and tactical approaches which need to
be further explored and developed to enable the Party to more
effectively discharge its great tasks now and on. the morrow.

PROMOTE UNITED FRONT RELATIONS AND ALLIANCES

At the very heart of the problem lies the question of taking full
advantage of the new and favorable trends and re-groupings now
beginning to unfold in the merged labor movement, in liberal
and social democratic circles, in the broad and loose peace move-
ment, in the farmers organizations, and in the Negro people’s
movement—all of which open up new and greater opportunities
for promoting united action and for crystalizing broad democratic
movements and coalitions.

Certainly, as our estimate of the present political situation in
the country served to point up, we need to be alert to, cultivate
and help shape, the healthiest trends and re-alignments now emerg-
ing in the country. We need to boldly seek out and establish new

38

contacts and united front relations and alliances, especially in the
labor and Negro people’s movements. And in particular this should
govern our approach to the crucial November elections, which be-
comes increasingly the focal point of all political struggle in the
country.

To enable the Party to move forward most rapidly and to
strengthen its mass contacts and multiply its political inﬂuence-
it is equally necessary to create a new understanding on how the
Party exercises its vanguard role in the present conditions where
the Party, in the main, is largely semi-legal or illegal, and where
big mass labor and popular organizations exist and broad mass
movements are unfolding. In these circumstances, primary em-
phasis must be placed on drastically improving the content and
modifying the forms and methods of work of our members in
existing mass organizations and movements; on how to give more
effective political leadership to the masses in and around the deci-
sive organizations of labor, the Negro people, farmers, youth and
women.

Here there are two cardinal and inter-related questions that
should be stressed—while striving at all times to come forward as
the best representatives and builders of the mass organizations of
the people, and participating in all genuinely progressive coali-
tions and movements, we Communists should also endeavor at all
times to imbue our shopmates and associates with a class-conscious,
a socialist outlook and understanding.

Secondly: it is essential that we p-ut an end to certain sectarian
and harmful practices that alienate the Left from many workers
and other potential allies—namely, the general indefensible and
frequent disregard of trade union democracy and discipline. Like-
wise, the Left forces in the unions should avoid giving support
to various old concepts of “oppositions” and so-called “rank and
ﬁle” movements that are narrow, and do not even embrace the ma-
jority of the left and progressive forces, and tend to separate them
from the majority of the workers and bypass the established union
machinery and procedures which exist in the industrial unions in
the most basic industries.

At the same time, and complementing the above, to enhance
the Party’s vanguard role, we have to devise new ways and means
to enable the Party to come forward publicly more frequently in
its own name, with its views and proposals, and in such a manner

 

as to provide our members, especially workers, with a measure
of protection against the undemocratic restrictions on their right to
a job.

In this connection, and besides the added and extraordinary
importance which attaches to the circulation and. use of our press
and literature, it is necessary to encourage the establishment of a
‘variety of united front mediums of public expression in which
both Communists and non-Communists can appear regularly.

Likewise, we have to take advantage of the many opportu-
nities existing for the Party to establish a host of new contacts
.and working relations, formal and informal, with tens of thousands
of individual labor, liberal, and social democratic leaders and rank
and file members, and with many mass organizations, including
trade unions, on such issues as the defense o'f the constitutional lib-
erties of the Party and the Bill of Rights for all Americans.

ATTENTION TO ORGANIZATIONAL WORK

To reinforce o11r political leadership and inﬂuence in all spheres
.and on all levels, another vital question merits attention: The
whole concept of Party organization, of organizational work and
responsibility, in its fullest political sense, has to be put on an en-
tirely new footing.

In the past period, due to the extreme diﬂiculty in which the
Party leadership functioned, a large percentage of our leaders were
separated from the daily operative work and fro'm close contact
with trade union cadres and members. Leadership was given,
much of the time, in articles, memos, letters, and documents. In-
.advertently, the concept was nourished that if the Party was given
or had a correct political line—the rest would follow.

As all of us know, the hammering out of a correct political line
and perspective is indispensable. Yet all of us must remember that
after a sound line is mapped out, organization decides everything,
including the fate of the line itself. And certainly today, when the
country is faced with a crucial election, when the problems of
consolidating and strengthening the Party organizationally and
politically are so acute, when the question of organizing mass cam-
paigns, united front movements and struggles is so imperative, we
have to imbue the entire Party, starting with the National Commit-
tee, with a new appreciation of the vital importance of political-
organizational work.

FOR A MASS PARTY OF SOCIALISM

Not the least important of the new and serious problems we
should concern ourselves with as we probe and re-assess the pres-
ent status and future of our Party—is the question that keeps com-
ing to the forefront in respect to the possibility of organizing a
new and broader mass party of socialism.

One of the unique aspects of political and social trends in the
U.S. in recent years is the revitalization and growth of a number
of socialist—oriented and pro‘-Marxist currents and groupings. What
explains such a development during a period marked by the sharp-
est repression against our Party and severe attacks on democratic
rights generally?

It is explained, first of all, by the inspirational inﬂuence ex-
erted by the historic victories of socialism and national liberation,
especially by the emergence of socialism as a world system.

Second: these currents have been stimulated by the growing‘
political maturity of a considerable number of left-progressives
who, since the end of World War II, have become sharply dis--
i.1lusioned with the two-party system and with the capitalist eco-
nomic system and structure that underlies it.

Third: precisely because of the vicious onslaught against our‘
Party, some socialist-minded people have sought other channels,
perhaps safer or less vulnerable, for Marxist expression.

Finally: there is no doubt that some socialist-oriented indi-
viduals looked elsewhere than to our Party because of honest dif-
ferences, and not a few have been repelled because of certain
dogmatic and sectarian concepts and methods in our Party, as
well as our not so infrequent rigid intolerance of “outside” criti-
cism.

Whatever may have been our attitude in the past, we American
Communists, on the basis of our own experience, have come to
realize that certain developments in our own country require a
“new look.” And this prompts us to state unequivocally that we
can have only the most positive approach to all honest socialist
and Marxist-oriented groupings and individuals, whatever our dif-
ferences may be on certain tactical and programmatic questions.
We share the aspirations of many of these forces for a mass party
of socialism in our country. We, too, want to create the conditions;
for such a necessary and historic development.

- 41

    

  

We must admit that, in the main, this has not been our approach
in the past. We Communists underestimated the scope and char-
acter of this many-sided pro-socialist development and its possi-
bilities for the American working class. Some tended to see only
the various rightist social—democratic opportunists and the unre-
constructed Trotskyists who were and are out to pervert Marxism
and to exploit the difficulties of our Party, in the manner of vul-
tures.

There has also been a sectarian, dogmatic approach that since
ours is the vanguard party of the working class, all those who‘
really want socialism will eventually have to come to us. More-
over, we have for some time neglected the deep roots of American
socialist traditions, strikingly evidenced in the recent signiﬁcant
Debs Centennial observations where certain inﬂuential labor spokes-
men participated in a major way.

Be that as it may, an entirely new approach is demanded of us.

This of course does not call for any move to try to form a
new party of socialism prematurely. True, socialist currents are
growing and will continue to do so, and the activity of diverse
Marxist-oriented groups is on the upgrade. Yet the task of organiz-
ing -a broad, mass party of socialism, based in substance on genuine
Marxist principles, cannot be ‘easy nor quick. We American Com-
munists will do our utmost to help create the pre-requisite for such
‘a development.

Considerable headway can surely be made -- in this direction
in the next year or two. But this will be a process. It will neces-
sitate sharp political and ideological struggles, as well as our
collective participation with the bulk of all the socialist-minded
elements in united front activity in concert with other progressive
forces. In the course of this a stronger Marxist core will undoubt-
edly crystallize among these diverse pro-socialist groupings and
currents. ‘

In the interim, and as one of the essential pre-conditi.ons for
establishing a broader mass party of socialism, it will surely be
necessary to strengthen our Communist Party politically, ideologi-
-cally, and organizationally—~and, above all, to extend its mass
inﬂuence and United Front relationships.

One of the biggest lessons we American Marxists need to learn
if we are to move ahead boldly, rapidly, and successfully, and
extend our base and mass influe.nce—is the urgent necessity of put-

42

 

ting an end to all dogmatism. As never before, we American Com-'
munists have to master the art of applying an.d developing the
universal science of Marxism creatively, on the basis of the experi-
ence, circumstances and traditions of our own country.

PUT AN END TO DOGMATISM

In this connection, we have to‘ understand the difference be-
tween that which is universally valid in Marxism and that which
is peculiarly applicable only to one or another country. This means
that we have to learn to distinguish between the principles of
Marxism which are valid generally, including the imperative neces-
sity of strengthening the bonds of solidarity between the working
people of all countries and the different ways, forms, and methods
Marxists elucidate and develop their tactics and concretely apply
the principles of scientific socialism in a variety of different situa-
tions. Certainly our job is not to study Marxism in the abstract
or as a catechism, but to study the problems and developments
in our own country by means of the living, dialectical method of
Marxism.

It is with this precept in mind that we should begin to dig
deeper into a host of questions ranging from economic perspec-
tives, the signiﬁcance of the accelerated growth of state monopoly
capitalism in the post-war period, the development of a rounded-
out anti—monopoly program, to the national question and to the
American road to‘ socialism, as well as various organizational forms
and methods of Party work and structure.

We need to develop a method of theoretical-political work
where we examine continuously and more concretely the actual
facts in each given situation, the exact relationship of class forces,
and the speciﬁc level of the mass movement and trends, not only
nationally, but in each state or city, in each industry or rural area,
in each given union, lodge, or chapter of this or that mass organi-
zation. Without this, it is not possible to formulate sound policies,
to apply or develop correct tactics, to exhibit concrete political and
organizational initiative, or to win the support and conﬁdence of
wide masses. 1

In this connection it is incumbent on us to re-appraise our
whole position on self-determination in the Black Belt. For in-
stance, a very important section of the Party’s Program, adopted in

43

l

  

1954, is that dealing with the oppression of the Negro people and
the struggle for equality.

Yet note should be taken of the fact that in the 1954 Program
the previous position of the Party on self-determination in the
Black Belt has been m.odiﬁed—in fact, dropped. I happen to agree
with this, just as I concur with a similar handling of this question
in the New Program for the South“ and in F oster’s recent article
in Political Aﬁ‘airs.“***

It seems to me, however, that it is necessary to do more than
reverse our position by shelving it. I believe we should state
frankly to the Party the reasons and developments which prompt
us to alter our position on the slogan of self-determination. In In
opinion we should frankly acknowledge that while the Negro
question in the Deep South remains a national and an agrarian
question, for some time developments in the South have not moved
in the direction of the establishment of a Negro nation.

The basic demands of the Negro people in the South, which
they themselves put forward and are struggling for, are for the
right to vote and representative government, for full equality’ in
employment, education and in all other spheres of life, and for
achieving serious reforms in agriculture.

In re-appraising our position on self-determination in the Black
Belt, our Party should emphasize, as never before, that the strug-
glevfor Negro rights and freedom, north and south of the Mason-
Dixon line, has emerged as a general, national democratic task,
upon the solution of which depends the democratic and social ad-
vance of the whole nation, particularly of the workers and farmers.

THE AMERICAN ROAD TO SOCIALISM

The ﬁnal question I wish to touch o-n is certain aspects‘ of the
American road to socialism.

During the past years, the most convenient frame-up weapon
against our Party has been the slander that Communists are “for-
eign agents” and everywhere stand for the overthrow of all capi-
ialist governments by force and violence. But the thin ice of lies
upon which the Smith Act and other such thought-control meas-
ures rest their claims is cracking. ‘

That explains some of the startled press comments evoked by
Khrushchev’s discussion on paths to socialism at the XXth Con-
gress. Marguerite Higgins, of the New York Herald Tribune, re-
cently put the problem this way:

. . . “In the United States, for instance, laws for the
prosecution of Communist leaders have been based on
presentation of evidence in United States courts that
Communists advocate the forcible overthrow of the gov-
ernment. But here is Mr. Khrushchev and the entire So-
viet Communist Party congress saying that it is no longer
so. In some cases communism can be achieved by using
existing legal machinery.

“American Communist leaders will undoubtedly insist
that they are, and intend to act, peacefully within the
law. Now they have Mr. Khrushchev to back them up
publicly with a speech ‘that will be a Communist bible.
What happens now to our governmenfs case?”

While Miss Higgins looked to a “bible” for the revelations
on “forcible overthrow,” the truth has been asserted with growing
clarity over a considerable period by Communists in various coun-
tries, including our own.

Already in 1947-48, our Party took note of the new world situa-
tion arising after World War II, and recognized that civil war is
not inevitable in all cap-italist countries. And in that period, in our
answers to the N .Y. Times* and the N.Y. Herald Tribune,“ Com-
rade Foster and I categorically stated that our Party advocated a
democratic solution of all problems confronting the American peo-
ple, including the eventual transition to socialism. Subsequently,
especially in 1949, Comrade Foster developed our Party’s position
further and demonstrated how and why we American Communists
seek and advocate peaceful and democratic processes in effecting
the transition to socialism by the people of our country.*“‘

As world experience has shown, and as the XXth Congress ana-
lyzed, there are many paths to socialism, and each country will

ﬁnd its own path" depending on its own traditions, the ‘conditions
of its struggle for progress, and the desires of the vast majority of
its people.   - ‘  -7

There are also many forms of transition to socialism, and these
are becoming more, not less, diversiﬁed—including the possibility
of transforming certain parliaments into people’s assemblies by
constitutional majorities and mass movements. .

Whether the realization of this or that path and form of social
transformation turns out to be more or less peaceful depends on
a host of circumstances. It is dependent on the concrete relation,-
ship of class forces, the unity and class consciousness of the work-
ing class and its allies, as well as on the strength of big capital
at such a po'int in history, on the extent of its repressive powers,
and on its ability under the given conditions to offer the ﬁercest
resistance to social progress.

FOR A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC ROAD TO SOCIALISM

As for the USA, we American Communists re-afﬁrm that we

do not advocate force and violence. We do not consider civil war .

inevitable nor in any way desirable. We desire and seek constitu-
tional and democratic solutions to current and fundamental prob-
lems. We favor and advocate a peaceful and democratic transition
to socialism.

We Communists and other advanced workers strive for a con-
stitutional and democratic solution to all the problems of today
and tomorrow, in full recognition of the fact that U.S. monopoly
capital is the strongest in the world and one of the most ruthless
in furthering its objectives at home and abroad. The U.S. trusts
and their political representatives have used and will continue to
try to‘ use demagogy, division and force and violence to one degree
or another to halt all social progress and democratic advance here
or anywhere else.

Therefore one main conclusion that the working class and all
popular forces must draw is that it is necessary at every juncture
to prevent and defeat the stubborn efforts of the economic royal-
ists to thwart the popular will. This is so now, especially in the
Deep South, and also in respect to the struggle for progressive
labor legislation and the enforcement of the Bill of Rights for
Communists and non-Communists alike.

46

  

The decisive labor and democratic forces will have to establish
the most sweeping unity of action to‘ cope with the ever-ﬁercer
resistance that the corporate interests will resort to in order to
avert the curbing and eventual breaking of their powers.

Nonetheless, it is our conviction that the course of world and
national trends will increasingly enhance the possibility for peace-
ful and constitutional advance to socialism. Such a possibility will
not arise automatically—it will have to be fought for and won.
The crucial question will be the ability‘ of a united working class
to exert decisive political inﬂuence on all democratic forces to
check and defeat the reactionary offensive of monopoly and to
keep open and extend all constitutional, democratic processes. This
is what we should emphasize and work for today and on the
morrow.

In addition to this, we Communists should develop a much
more graphic picture of what American socialism would look like,
what miracles of achievements it would introduce. Would not
a socialist America in a peaceful world, sharing the beneﬁts of
atomic and thermonuclear energy, make the most rapid advances
in production and living standards in the history of nations? Would
not the advance of the USA to socialism’ mean an end almost
overnight to misery and backwardness in every part of our country?
Would not a socialist society effect wonders in the spheres of edu-

cation, culture, sports, and national health? Would not socialism .

transform the South and convert it into a ﬂourishing and prosperous
area in which the principles of equality, liberty and fraternity
would hold sway? Under socialism would not Congress and the
state legislatures become truly representative of the working ‘peo-
ple? In a socialist society would not civil rights and civil liberties
for all the people-—Negro and white—the equality and dignity and
creative ability of man, at long last be fully realized and ﬂower?

At all times, we Communists should project the speciﬁc Ameri-
can road to socialism without diverting from the central mass eco-
nomic, electoral and other political tasks of the immediate period
ahead, upon the solution of which the way forward depends. We
should avoid oversimplifying and presenting the road to socialism as
a series of schematic stages. At this juncture we should particularly
stress the next immediate stage of progress for the people of our
co'untry—which is inseparably bound up with, and requires the crys-

tallization of a broad democratic front movement and coalition, un-
der progressive labor inﬂuence.

By presenting the possibility of peaceful and democratic
transition to socialism -in the USA in such a manner, we Ameri-
can Communists will enhance the prospects for its realization.
We will likewise focus attention on the main tasks of the mo-
ment and the period ahead, especially the forging of a labor-
democratic coalition whose potential for effectively curbing the
power of the trusts will grow ever more mighty.

The central objective in the ’56 elections is to help create
some of the conditions for the emergence of such an anti-mon-
opoly coalition capable of inﬂuencing the next Administration
and Congress, and of" subsequently bringing into power an ad-
ministration and congress resting on and responsive to such a
popular movement and alliance-—a government committed to
peaceful negotiation and reducing international tensions, to
promoting the economic security of the working people at the
expense of the monopolies, to upholding the Constitution and
enforcing the Bill of Rights. The struggle for and the achieve-
ment of such a democratic anti-monopoly coalition and subse-
quently of such a government, will safeguard the welfare, in-
terests and rights of the American people and will pave the way
for new democratic and social advances, as well as strengthen
the cause of world peace.

Five years have gone by since the last full meeting of our
National Committee. At that time, in 1951, the war in Korea was
at its height. The war in Indo-China was continuing with no
apparent sign of conclusion. In Eastern Europe the rift with
Yugoslavia was stirring the hopes of U.S. imperialism, and on
every front throughout the world Wall Street was pressing the cold
war with mounting vigor.

In the ﬁve years since then, the war in Korea, so hated by the
American people, was brought to an end. Despite the efforts of the
Nixons—Knowlands-Dulleses to prolong and extend the Indo-China
war, this war, so hated by the French people, was likewise brought
to an end. The bold peace initiatives of the Soviet Union suc-
ceeded in lessening tensions in a number of critical situations, as
well as in healing the breach with Yugoslavia.

The general signiﬁcance of the present period is embodied in
Bandung and Geneva, the meaning of which was correctly sig-
nalized at our National Party conference last December. As a re-
sult of the changes ﬂowing from the second world war, and with
the emergence of socialism as a world system, and the historic
victories of hundreds of millions of former colonial peoples in at-
taining their independence—a new relationship in world forces has
taken place extraordinarily and decisively favorable to the camp
of peace, democracy, and socialism.

International tensions have been reduced. In more and more areas
the struggle between the East and West is moving over into the
arena of economics and the battle of ideas. Throughout the West-
ern world the whole policy of aggressive military alliances, such
as NATO, is being brought into question—in fact, NATO is in
the throes of a deep crisis.

Even in the last few weeks we have seen additional reflections
of these changes: The request of little Iceland that the United
States remove its troops from their territory; the overwhelming
election defeat in Ceylon of the former administration which based

 

 

  

its policy on alliance with the so-called “West”; the recent castiga-
tion of U.S. policy by the leaders of the French government; and
the noteworthy impact of the latest Soviet proposals for a detente
in the Mideast—all are signs of the times.

A central feature of the present situation is the gigantic interna-
tional impact of the XXth Congress of the CPSU.* The supreme
conﬁdence of the Soviet people, based in no small part on the un-

precedented results of the last ﬁve-year plan and the epic pros-

pects for the new one, has caught the imagination of the world
with the new possibilities opened up for peaceful co-existence
and competition.

The recognition of the fact that the Soviet Union has already
given unencumbered economic aid amounting to six billion dol-
lars to China and the people’s democracies (including over half a
billion to non-socialist countries), is tipping the scales toward more
sober approaches on the part of many capitalist circles, including
some in the USA, to the questions of peaceful co--existence and
East-West trade. The newly recognized economic strength of the
Soviet Union, and the conformity of its conditions of aid with the
principles of peace and non—interference in the affairs of the recipi-
ent country, is having a profound effect not only on the former
colonial countries, but also on those still struggling for their inde-
pendence, as well as on France and Italy and the Scandinavian
countries.

The XXth Congress also had a profound impact upon all working
class organizations, including the Socialist Parties of the world.
Undoubtedly this will facilitate in the near future a great advance
in united action of Socialists and Communists, of Communists and
Catholic masses, of all who wish to struggle for peace and progress.
This is bound up in particular with the socialist achievements in
the USSR during the p-ast three years, with the positive effects of
the dynamic peace policy of the Soviet Union, and the further
development of Marxist theoretical principles elaborated at the XXth
Congress in respect to the non-inevitability of wars and the possi-
bilities for peaceful transition,to socialism in various countries
—historic theoretical propositions whose immense political and
practical signiﬁcance has yet to be fully grasped.

The re-evaluation of past ideas and practices, which was inﬁ-

nitely greater than just the re-evaluation of the Stalin leadership,
had the purpose and effect of putting an end to those violations
of socialist democracy which did serious damage and were an in-
tolerable hindrance upon the further advance of ‘socialism. It
concerned itself with the elimination of grossly wrong and harm-
ful practices and the anti-Leninist concepts that fed them. There
has been much confusion over these developments and the ene-
mies of socialism in the USA have seemed to- be having something
of a ﬁeld day. But as for us, in drawing the profound lessons of
these developments, let us grasp the achievements of the XXth
Congress in their entirety—in relation to the epoch-making changes
now going on in the whole world, particularly those which have
arisen from the establishment of socialism as a world system, and
from the disintegration of the old colonial empires.

THE ECONOMIC SITUATION

America has not been immune from‘ what has been happening in
the world. Important changes have taken place in our country,
although these cannot yet be characterized as a qualitative change.
There are new elements in the picture, but a big chunk of the past
is still with us. ,

Let us brieﬂy note some of the high points of the present'po—
litical situation in the country:

On the economic front: While factors making for a cyclical
crisis continue to mature, this process takes place unevenly. There
is, as yet, no‘ evidence that would make possible any speciﬁc pre-
diction of the time when a major depression will take place, al-
though it seems highly unlikely for ’56. There is evidence, however,
that a decline in production and employment may take place be-
fore the year is out, which may still be succeeded by another
upturn. High proﬁts and high armaments continue, but the peak
of industrial production has levelled off with some signs of weak-
ening; the decline in auto continues, and unemployment in the in-
dustry is now over 140,000. There is also a certain decline in resi-
dential construction. I

The crisis in agriculture is steadily deepening. Farm income
has declined 26 per cent since its peak in 1951, and almost 2
million workers have been forced out of agriculture since 1950.
The position of the lower one-third economic group rapidly grows

_ more insecure, especially that of the Negro people.
