KELLOGG, Ida.—-From Superior, Ariz., came word that the Ladies Auxiliary
of Mine-Mill Local 938 at Magma Copper had earmarked proceeds from their Lions
Club Carnival booth pastry sale as a contribution to the Coeur d’Alenes Local 18
' strike. In Missoula, Mont., the Business Agent-of the Teamsters union assured a Local
18 strike representative that the truckers would ‘take care of the transportation of

produce and foodstuffs col-
lected from the Missoula-

.1-Iamilton area into Kellogg.

And at Denver, Colo., the Oct.
,17 issue of the Oil, Chemical
& Atomic ,Workers official

"I -_nev'vspaper, Union News, car-

ried a special story on the

i ' M_i n e - Mill Coeur d’Alenes

 

 strike which blasted the denial
‘ of federal school lunches for

__the strikers’ children as ‘‘par-
, gticularly cold-hearted.”

The mounting assist-

' IT WAS also marked by ris-
ing indignation at the inhu-

manness -of Idaho Governor,

Robert E. Smylie’s refusal to
make federal surplus foods
available to the" strikers and

’ their families, and even more

so at the cruelty of the Sho-
shone County school board’s

cutting off of federal hot

school lunches for the strikers’
children.

Both these actions of state
and county authoritiest were
denounced by Mine-Mill Presi-
dent Clark as “encouragement
to the companies in their at-
tempt to starve the strikers
into s;ubmission,” and by a Lo-
cal 18 mass meeting in Kel-
logg which sent a telegram to

.Presid;ent Eisenhower urging

he intercede to get the surplus

foods released and s c h o o 1

lunches reinstated.

‘ Similar telegrams brought

Idaho Senator Frank Church

the foods could be provided at

DENVER——Political ac-
tion work" of Mine-Mill lo-
cal unions across the coun-
try headed for a climax at
the end of October with the
“V” day target set for Nov. 8
--Voting day.

In 16 states, from Alaska to
Georgia, the union’s member-
ship will be involved in the
election of U. S. Senators; in
12 with the determination of
Governors; and in 28 with the
election of U. S. Congressmen.
In all but four of the states
where Mine-Mill members live,
they will have a significant
say in the composition of their
State Legislatures.

As in the past, the union’s
political weight will be felt in
key congressional races, gu-
bernatorial contests and state
votes down to the county and
local level. In several areas of
Mine-Mill concentration, par-.
ticularly in the Rocky Moun-
tain and Southwest states, the
vote of the membership is ex-
pected to be decisive.

Following past custom, the
International Union has left
the question of endorsements
to locals, state councils and
political a c t i o n committees,
emphasizing only that the reg-
istered members vote on the
basis of union program. At
press deadline, here were
some of the political develop-
ments reported:

Union Pr0Pose. ABC Ne9ofiafe

TORRINGTON, Conn.—Mine-Mill’s Joint ABC Bargaining committee last month
called on the American Brass Company to negotiate a 35-hour work week with 40

hours pay as-a new basis for resumin

year contracts due to expire next June; -

Involved inthe negotiations are Locals 423, 445 and 593 representing workers at '
fthe Mine-Mill statement point-

The "union's proposal for ha‘

35-hour week without reduc-
tion in pay was announced fol-
lowing a brief bargaining ses-
sion’ held here Sept. 22 at
which the company withdrew
its original offer, made some
two months earlier, ‘of 4, 4
and 3 cent annual wage in-
creases over a three year peri-
od and’ a new pension plan.
That company offer was re-
jected at the time as totally
inadequate.

THE, STATEMENT also
stressed the fact that the com-
pany is spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars in new
equipment as part of its pro-
gram, and mentioned that “the
35-hour week with 40 hours’
pay would cost no more.”

Hitting hard at the com-
pany’s claim of inability “to
increase labor costs,” the union
bargaining group declared that
t11e_]c0IYlPt_u1y,’s own financial
reports “make a mockery of
this claim.”

The net profit of over $27
million reported «for the first

among the highest reported by
the company for a similar pe-
riod in its history, the state-
ment said. “In spite of the
over-all drop in brass produc-
tion, the American Brass Com-
pany is constantly improving
its competitive position. It now
has a greater share of the
American market than any
other company.”

American Brass was chal-
lenged “to sit down and nego-
tiate some security and job
guarantee for its workers.”

‘ For its part, the union advised

the company: “We are pre-
pared to resume negotiations
tomorrow on a shorter work
week.” '

internal strife in some of the largest unions
in the country? - ~ "

Since the passage of the Taft-Hartley
Act and continuing through the Landrum-
Griffin Act, the House of Labor through a
completely divided leadership has been going
through an era that puts it in a position of
 becoming the prey of the now well-organized
 foes of the organized labor movement of this

The warning by John L. Lewis that
unions complying with, the T-H Act would
become the victims of _the legal profession
and other adversities is now ‘a well under-

stood prophecy. In the mad rush for compliance they became

embroiled in cannibalism and jurisdictional battles which now '

engulfs labor in a divisive and ruinous fight which can only
mean further splits and a threat of self-destruction.

  at A *- at _  
, HE GLORY-SEEKING attack on the leadership ofthe Team-
psters Union, following the continual and harassing moves
against the Longshoremen’s leadership, brought drools of satis-
faction from some of labor’s leadership instead of a unified

movement of support on the knowledge that this was a well
planned move to create inroads against the whole organized

labor movement.

The T4! conspiracy case against Mine-Mill,‘ whose defense
is gaining support from many top progressive labor leaders,
is another attack culminating from the plan against labor in

general.

Ironically, this attack stemmed from a section’ of labor in
the C.I.O. which for the past ten years has and is still continuing

to split and divide the ranks of labor, using in particular the

costly propaganda paid for out of their own members’ dues
and disguising their activities which can only make a cleavage
of workers resulting in splits that may never be unified.

~k‘k*

E NOW SEE the Landrum—Griffin Act being used to its,_._
fullest intent in" the charge of illegal procedures in the --

election of officers in the National Maritime Union, forcing the

elected president Joe Curran to seek ,court action against it,

The complex-*fisC’aI’requirements of the Bureau of Labor-Man-'
agement Reports and the numerous cases against unions under
the ramifications of the Act exemplifies the harassing problems

thrown in the lap of labor.

What moral or legitimate right has the leadership of the
Steelworkers Union, for instance, to proclaim themselves as
the saviours of -any section of labor? The despicable actions of
their last convention, suppressing opposition by gangland or
goon squad methods which received nation-wide publicity, cer-
tainly can’t be conducive for workers to choose their leadership
in the coming fights confronting the labor movement.»

* * it .
RANKLY, discontent is spreading throughout the labor
movement. This again can only be laid at the door of those
who have played a wishy-washy game in the top leadership.

I The specter of adding more thousands to the unemployed
through automation and the ever-growing imports of foreign-
made goods undercutting American workers with cheap compe-
tition seems to arouse only comments, but no unified action to

remedy it.

Praise must be heaped on the Longshoremen’s Union and
its leadership in their new agreement taking care of some of
this problem of their workers to a great degree. Ironically, this
Union, which has been the target of many attacks, is the first
tolead the way in th'is dilemma facing all of us,

  ‘k * ‘A’ ,
CAN’T HELP but quote President Joseph A. Bierne of the
. ‘ Communication Workers who, although he is on the Execu-
tive Board of the AFL-CIO, has the guts to take them to task.
In an address to his union’s convention, Bierne said: .

“Will labor grow in America, or do we face a long period of
down-hill loss of leadership, real or ‘relative, and a loss of in-
fluence at the place of work and in the community as a whole?
. . . Too much time of the AFL-CIO leadership is spent in

‘ . wrangling over jurisdictional disputes and rivalries of Unions,

which unless they soon rouse themselves, may find that their
jurisdictions have disappeared completely under the impact of

automation.”

The answer can be found in the early principles of labor---
‘unity of action around a common program based on the needs

of the workers.--.JOHN CLARK.

Officers Mourn Loss of

George ‘Scotty’ Anderson

DENVER——Feelings of" “deep sorrow and profound
loss” were expressed last month by Mine-Mill’s four top
officers in a message of condolences to the Canadian sec-
tion of the union on the untimely death of George W.

“Scotty” Anderson.

Known to many Mine-
Mill local leaders in the
United States for his fiery
speeches ‘at International Un-
ion conventions and as a tire-
less fighter for the union,
Brother Anderson died of a
heart attack on Sept. 20 at the
age of 52. I-Ie is survived by
his wife, Victoria, tw daugh-
ters and two grandchildren.

“Scotty” died in harness at

Edmonton, Alberta, his new

base of service to the union
after recently being elected
National Executive
Member of Canadian District
1. .

As a hard rock miner for
the Falconbridge Nickel Mines
in the early 1930’s, Brother
Anderson first showed his un-
selfish devotion to Mine-Mill
in helping to found the union
in the Sudbury area at a time
when organizing nickel work-
ers was tough and dangerous

November. mo THE ‘MINE-MILL UNION

The Coeur d’Alenes Strike

the battle against company efforts to bust it continues.

Union of Mine, Mill and Smel-
ter Workers. -

These early struggles have
been indelibly written into the
rich tradition and history of
trade unionism in America.
The infant union was at-
tacked by the ne-wly—formed
Mine Owners’ Protective As-
sociation as “radical—domi-
nated” and “anarchistic.” To
fight the union, the Associa-
tion hired Pinkerton detec-
tives, gunmen, stool-pigeons,
strike-breakers’; . and received
the Willing cooperation of the
local press for its propaganda.

THE BULLPENS

Used, too, were the injunc-
tion and “contempt of court”
charges to jail union leaders.

It was d1u'ing this period in
the 1890’s and early 1900’s
that 13 Coeur d’Alenes miners’
-leaders were jailed following
a company-provoked gun bat-
tle in which three union men
were shot to death . . . that
martial law ,was declared and
1,200 union men were arrested
without warrants and herded
for months in filthy “bull-

which they were later acquit-
ted. '

That was the pattern at the
turn of the ‘century. As devel-
opments inthe present strike
clearly show, the Coeur d’-
Alenes district employers,
while they were forced to rec-
ognize and deal with it, have
never given up their hopes of
breaking the union.

NEW FORMULA

Only their methods have
been more modernized. Today
it’s the Mohawk Valley formu-
la, a strike-breaking pattern

pens.” And it was during this
period when Western Federa-
tion of Miners leaders Big Bill
Haywood, Charles Moyer and
George Pettibone were defend-
ed by Clarence Darrow against
frame-up murder charges. of

SOLATED in the canyons

radiating through the north-

west mountains of Idaho is a
metal mining district known
as the Coeur d’Alenes.

Here, in the mining camps

and smelter towns of Sho-
shone County, is where a la-
-bor struggle has been going
on for the past six months
which had its origin in a fight
for union recognition three-
quarters of a century ago.

The facts behind the cur-
rent strike of 2,200 lead-zinc
‘miners and smeltermen in the

, Coeur d’Alenes are clear cut.
‘For more than a year their
 union, Local 18 of the Interna-
it tional Union of Mine, Mill and
1 Smelter Workers, had been
 f negotiating with the Bunker
‘Hill and American Smelting &
l ‘Refining companies for im-
_provements in their old con-
tracts which expired, June 30,
1959. ‘
THE ISSUES ‘

Issues involved union wage
and contract demands already

‘granted in previous ‘settle-
A ments reached by Mine-Mill
-r. with ninety per cent of the
non-ferrous metals industry,
including AS&R at .12 of its
properties elsewhere through-

. out the country. ‘

The companies not only ar-
rogantly refused to bargain in
good faith on the industry-
wide . pattern established with
the other major producers, but
insisted on contract ‘changes
designed to weaken, the union
and wreck long-standing work-
ing conditions won over the
years.

With all efforts of the un-
ion to settle peacefully having
proven futile, Local 18's 1,700
members at Bunker Hill shut
down that cbmpany’s mining
and smelting operations ‘on
May 5, 1960. AS&R’s mines
were struck by 500 members
of the same local on May 25.

The strike is still going
strong, despite all conceivable
efforts of the two Wall Street- .
owned mining interests to
break it.

EARLIER BATTLE

Essentially, _the p r e s e n t
fight of the ‘miners and smel-
termen for equitable treat-,

. ’ment is a continuation of earl-
ier struggles in this district
dating back to 1887 when
Bunker Hill fired .. the first
‘shot with an announced $1 a
day cut in miners’ wages from
-$3.50 to $2.50 per day.

The company’s insistence on

I paying less than other’employ-

. ers precipitated one of the
‘greatest labor battles in the
nation’s history. It resulted in
the formation of the first local
union in the district, later to
be followed in 1893 by the

in the Mohawk Valley of New

acterized by company support
and sponsorship of third-party
community elements for un-
ion-busting behind a smoke-
screen of red smears ‘to ob
scure the real. issues. 0

Almost immediately after
the strike started, a series of
related strike-breaking activi-
ties began to emerge which is
unmatched in the postwar his-
tory of labor-management con-

flict in the metal mining in- '

dustry.

A long-dormant organiza-
tion, the “Shoshone County
Anti - Communist League,”

which was originally formed
by certain segments of busi-
ness and professional people
during an 84-day strike against
Bunker Hill in 1950, was sud-
denly restored to life.

LATEST MOVES

Then. a “spontaneous” or-
ganization of high school stu-
dents, named “I Am An Amer-
ican Youth,” held an open
evening meeting in the high
school auditorium and later
staged a parade in Kellogg.
Its leaders said they were not
against unions, only against
“communism” in the Coeur
d’Alenes. Little has been

“heard .from them since.

Another “spontaneous” or-
ganization to appear was the
“Common Sense Council,” a
businessmen’s group led by a

by the “Common Sense Coun-

ing signature cards for an
NLRB decertification election

and a quick end to the strike 

on company terms.

ATTACKS FAIL
All of these outfits have

maintained a steady drumfire“ 

of radio, TV and newspaper

attacks, particularly through I I 

the columns and scare. head-
lines of the Kellogg Evening
News, aimed at undermining
srtikers’ morale, splitting the

union and busting the strike. I

Early in October AS&R’s _ "

Northwest Mining Department ‘A

Manager J. C. Kieffer, -issued

an invitation for scabs to,-run  2;
the picket lines with a; ‘-‘De‘.%;~ '- 
. John” letter urging. the strik- —

ers to show “_guts’? and “get
back to work.”_— The letter was

 

attacked by the union as “a  
flagrant attempt at strike-, 

breaking and open call for _vio‘-' I

lence which will never suc-
ceed.-,” It hasn’t. '  

None of these em.-is hlav-ie 
made any real dent in the _

strike. Morale and solidarity

I of the strikers remains high.

'su1u>_I.Us FOOD .. .
Food and other. essential

needs are being taken ca_re- of
by the union in spite. of the
refusal of Idaho’s Republican
Governor Robert E. Smylie to
make federal surplus com-
modities available, and the fact
that Idaho is one of the few
states which, until only , re-
cently, provided no welfarellaid
in labor disputes. 4

The recent change came
when the Governor an-
nounced that the state pub-
lic assistance department
would provide directmonetary
relief to strikers’ families and
others affected by the ldiigﬁ
shutdown in Shoshone Coun-
ty.

Helstill refused, however, to

"foods which, Senator Frank 5
.Church (D. Ida.) has informed
the union, would be made

available from the Depart-

ment of Agriculture at a stroke

of the Governor’s pen.

SCHOOL LUNCHES

The union also charges, that
the federal school hot‘ lunch
program is being used as an

anti-strike weapon by local

authorities.

The Shoshone County school
board has been depriving 1,200
children in the district of hot
school lunches because, it
says, some of the strikers’
children cannot pay for them.

The fight for reinstatement
of the program is being inten-
sified.

SUPPORT snows , 

Responses to Local 18’s,ap-
peals for financial aid have
mounted with the approach of
winter.

Support is increasingly coin-'

ing in from labor and»-farmer
groups in the northwest states
and Pacific coast, in addition
to that mobilized by Mine-Mill
and its locals throughout the
U. S. and Canada. In the state
itself, a broad Idaho Citizens
Relief Committee is actively
soliciting aid for the strikers.

Many leading state ].)Ol‘l:l:L?L§l
leaders, both Democrat and
Republican, have added their
influence in the fight to pro-
vide federal surplus commodi-
ties for needy families and
hot school lunches for the Chil-
dren. ‘ ‘

MORE AID NEEDED

But the snow" has ‘already
come in this area w‘her'Ce tem-
peratures hit 30 below, and
the need for cash and clothes
to care for the families of
2,200 striking miners and smel-
termen grows ‘greater daily.

Larry Riley and Warden John Schavolt resigned their
offices here last month in face of a federal court order 
stopping them and those acting with them from “doing  7
any act in furtherance of secession or withdrawal from

the International Union of
Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers.”

The order by Federal Dis-
trict Judge W. D. Murray fol-
lowed action by Mine-Mill
President John Clark to re-
move Riley and Schavolt be-
cause of their secession activ-
ity on behalf of the Steelwork-
ers and to restore rank and

Clark at v the same time
named Int’l Rep. Tom Mc-

Local 117, as Administrator to
work with the local’s officers
in enforcing the contract with
the Anaconda company and in
protecting the interests. of the
members. .

provided for McGuire as Ad-

District 1 Board Member
Ernest Salvas, commenting on

the resignations- of Riley and

Schavolt, said their resigna-
tions “make it quite clear that
action both organizational and
legal by the union forced them
to remove themselves as offi-

_ cers.”

“Under the Federal Court
Order obtained by the Inter-
national Union,” Salvas said,
“they were bound to function

TIONAL TEAMSTER, monthly magazine of the International Brotherhood of Team-

Mine-Mill case said: “Labor
Backs One of Oldest Unions in

Pointing out that the case is
one of the most “significant le-
gal attacks against labor since

. passage of the Landrum-Grif-
fin law,” the article said that *

the charge of conspiracy being
“used in the effort to decapi-
tate Mine-Mill is an anti-labor

can Friends Service Commit-

tee, who is an expert in labor,

Broome had tried to show
that Mine-Mill’s position on
Taft-Hartley was. part of a
“conspiracy.” Hearing Exami-
ner Francis A. Cherry over-
ruled Broome’s objection and
permitted Meacham to testify
that Mine-Mill's position on

of the entire labor movement.

Production Cuts Follow   
Drops in Copper Prices

Long expected softeningln the price of copper occurred-
early in October, after the longest period of price stability '
eleven months—since the end of World War II. Onoctober 3,‘
American Smeiting and Refining Company announced. a cut in-'
its price from 33c to 31c per pound. Other custom smelters
quickly fell into line. . , f

In announcing the cut, AS&R referred to ample suppIi'es.of1
copper now available, and to the growing disparity between»
London and New York copper prices in previous weeks with”
copper in London early in October between 28c and 29c 
pound. . - ’ .._.

i The custom smelter price cut put pressure on the -large'_  ‘
primary producers’ price, and on October 11, Kennecott, foI- 
lowed by Phelps Dodge, cut the price to 30c per pound. Ana-
conda, smaller primary producers and the custom smelters met  
the 30c price two days later.

. WORLD copper production has exceeded copper consump-.’9
tion by about 10‘per cent for several months, and - market ex- .2
perts say the price adjustment that has taken place would 
have happened sooner except for uncertainty about political“
stability in_ the Congo and the expected strike against A'n_”a-j 

  

‘ conda in Chile. -

 

Since the first price cuts were announced, five large,_pro- 
ducers have announced_ that production would be ‘adjusted 
downward, by about 10 per «cent of capacity. . '   .j 

These include Phelps Dodge, Noranda (Canad€£)',[ Rhode- 
sian Selection Trust and Anglo-American Corp. (Rhodesia), _]
and--Union Miniere du Haut Katanga (Congo). The cuts when
in effect will amount to about:8,000 tons of copper per_month.i

ZINC PRODUCTION, both at mines and smelters has been ‘
substantially curtailed by strikes commencing last May in the" -
Coeur d’Alenes, - last -August at New Jersey Zinc mines and M
smelters, and at Mathiessen and Hegeler. In addition,  
conda Company has cut back zinc mining in Butte. ‘ ~ i '
U. S. mine production of zinc is down by nearly 20 per cent . '__i
from 40,855 tons last April to 33,022 tons last August. Slab zinc .; ~-

U. 8. LEAD mine production, according to American Metal-S . 5

Among the promising possibilities for the future ale the ’

unions in Washington state,
and by wires to the meeting
from the Farmers Union, Rail-
way Brotherhoods and Lum-
ber & Sawmill Workers in
Montana and other unions in
the northwest.

Finally, under pr es S ur e
from all quarters, and after
a delegation of 100 family
heads led by Reg. Dir. Daugh-
erty met with the Shoshone
County Commissioners to de-
mand emergency ‘action on
surplus foods and school
lunches, Gov. Smylie an-

nounced that the state public"

assistance department would
provide direct monetary relief
to strikers’ families and oth-

or-&#;*s affected by the strike.

While welcoming the gover-
nor’s action as a partial an-
swer, the union said it was
still inadequate to relieve the
‘needs that existed for surplus
foods and children’s school
lunches. ’

L a t e r, Idaho Democratic
state chairman John Walters
issued a public statement to
the press in‘which he _urged
the governor “to go all the
Way to assure that Idaho
school children are not forced
to go hungry” and asked that
both the school lunches and
surplus foods be made avail-
able.

THE ENTIRE International
Union was being mobilized in
support of the strike. Appeals
for a continuous flow of aid
to the Coeur d’Alenes were
sentto every local in the U. S.

’ and Canada. Assistance for the
,/.,,,strike was a top agenda point

at a District 2 staff meeting in
Tucson, Ariz., and a Kenne-
cott Council meeting in Silver
City, N. ,M. Special leaflets
were issued to all locals in
Montana.
And the response was com-
. ing in. (See listing of Mine-
Mill contributors on Page 2.)
At the same time, a. tour of
Mo 11 t a n a communities last
month by Local,18 strike com-
mitteeman Rudy Hanson and
District 1 Board Member Ern-
e,°§,t_Salva.s brought heartening
§'"'uarantees of increasing
Coeur d’Alenes strike relief.

A meeting with President

James -Umber of the Montana
AFL-CIO elicited; his expres-
sipn of real concern and the
promise that he would get out
a message to all AFL-CIO lo-
cals in the state urging their
‘support of t-he strike.
SECRETARY; TREASURER-
Ralph Cook of the Montana
Farmers Union agreed to
make additional solicitations
for aid as a follow-up on more
-t-heain 2,000 communications
which -had already been sent

to all '-MFU locals and county; —‘

asking members to start col-

MEANWHILE, negotiations
with Bunker Hill including
federal .. conciliation, which
were resumed in late Septem-
ber for the first time since
the strike began, ran into a
stalemate in mid-October
when the company broke off
the talks and walked out.

AS&R management to sit
