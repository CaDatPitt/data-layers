Rousseau, especially from those Public Libraries where the philoso-
phy of Rome rates higher than the American, French and Russian
Revolutions. Maritain’s activities have been varied. He was special
envoy tothe Vatican from France for a period. He came to America
in 1940, where he received quite a welcome to lecture at our large
universities and prepare for the Church’s new role as the leader of

“Democracy.” Rest assured he met with no lawsuit and court action,_

such as welcomed Bertrand Russell. He is about to take over the
steering of Democracy in America, so one would think from the
praises of Catholic Critics and admiring Irish “Fathers” who de-
scribe him as “the foremost spokesman of the Catholic revival in
France,” and “the most active of Modern French exponents of a
return to medieval ideals.” (Of the Dark Ages and the Witch Trials.)
Maritain wrote a virulent attack, 1928, on “Three Reformers,
Martin Luther, Rene Descartes and Jean Jacques Rousseau.” They
who have read that work may hardly expect him to write anything
of Democracy that will not be a snake bite for'Democracy.
According to Maritain, “the Tragedy of the Democracies” is that
they did not seek democracy through the Catholic Church, hence
they did not get true democracy—as if all those hidalgo regimes of
Fascist criminals and traitors to their own masses of peons, down
in South America, were true democracies because there the Church
reigns supreme to keep the masses degraded; or asif Mussolini had
brought true democracy to Italy by his deal with the Pope, because
the Pope preferred Mussolini as “a man sent by Providence” who
did not believe in “the ugly fetishes of liberalism.” By “fetishes of
liberalism,” the Pope was referring to the notions of Liberty,
Equality and Fraternity. (See Carlo Sforza’s article in Frances

_ Keene’s Neither Liberty Nor Bread.)

Maritain writes on “Christianity and Democracy” and similar
subjects to explain away Democracy in favor of the Holy Roman
Empire. This brings to mind the fact (known and acknowledged
by serious students) that the Pope backed both the Kaiser and
Hitler with the object of restoring the old Holy Roman Empire.
(L. H. Lehmann.) This is further supported by the actions of traitors
Mindszenty of Hungary and Spellman of New York when they
conspired to help restore the Hapsburgs to the Throne of Austria
and Hungary. For his support Maritain calls on Joseph De Maistre,
not Thomas Jefferson, but a ‘great conspirator against Thomas
Jefferson.

This fact, that conspirators control the Press, Pulpit, and Radio,
makes it imperative to expose the nature of that Thought Control
which has become established over the American people by the
American Zaibatsu. Thirteen Monopolies of America, which are
similar in function to the eleven Zaibatsu of Japan, control and
manipulate the means of mass-communication. You remember how,
before and during the War, Americans were horrified at the way
the Japanese Militarists controlled the poor Japanese and their Sun
God Emperor, while the Militarists themselves were controlled by
the eleven Zaibatsu of Japan; and that the first task of General

10

 

 

MacArthur, after V.J. Day, was to break those Monopolies and their
feudal control of 90 million humans; and when MacArthur started
to do that, he was stopped by the loud squawks of such stooges as
Senator Knowland of Oakland, California, who thought it would
reflect too much on our own Zaibatsu. »

I know first hand of a radio reporter who, though a spokesman
for libera.l causes, dares not read to his audience a letter from a
Spanish prison. Is he under orders not to mention “Franco,” the
head assassin of all Fascism’? Sidney Howard was forbidden to use
the word “Fascism” by the Jesuit Censor of the movie “It Can’t
Happen Here.” (See the details of that set-up in Thomas Bledsoe’s
Hierarchy Over Hollywood.)

Think of it! American thinking is controlled, from away back
and from a long ways around. Can any man take a million dollars,
or even five million dollars, and ‘promote a large daily paper if he
opposes the purposes of war—mongers and their conspiracy to keep
America of the Rich, by the Rich, and for the Rich? The three large
news agencies here are: Associated Press, United Press, and Inter-
national News Service. These agencies are of billion dollar propor-
tions and they will not sell their services to those who do not carry
the ball for the American Zaibatsu. For example, you know how
young Vanderbilt wasted three million dollars trying to establish
a liberal newspaper in the early ’20’s. Since then, Marshall Field,
who inherited $164,000,000, found that all his millions “could buy
him only a curiously limited area of press freedom.” (George
Marion.) Why? Because his “Chicago Sun” was set up to combat
the ultra-reactionary Chicago Tribune. He had to fight all the way
to the Supreme Court because even “the local news service in
Chicago was barred to him . . . Not even his fortune could finance
an adequate global news service.” (George Marion.)

In order to understand who are the destroyers of the American
Hope, it is necessary to grasp the concept Criminal Press. Those
who own and control mass communications put out flambuoyant
lies every minute in their drive for World War Three, in addition
to their more smug method of degrading American intelligence by
having it concentrate on a low order of stuff. The well—played-up
submarine scare on the West Coast in ’48 was composed of pure
lies designed to speed up the approaching catastrophe. The big
submarine scare near San Francisco, in late March of 1950, was
timed to influence the Trial of Harry Bridges.

Arthur Shumway, a veteran newspaper reporter of the Chicago
area, stands ready, says he, “to swear from experience” that a vast
number of newspaper headlines are pure fiction. Oftentimes when
a super-crime begins to lag in public interest, the ingenious news
reporters themselves are the ones who make mysterious calls to
the police departments offering tips and clues. Then, shortly, “the
reporters who had called would be at the police station to get a
story about the mysterious new development.” According to Shum-
way, they even write diaries of girls who have been murdered.

In order to avoid the charge of using controversial evidence only,
I shall here use two illustrations on the plane of current headline

11

 

  

news: (1) The black panther and 300-pound gorilla battle in Spo-
kane, Washington, July 23, 1949, was reported by the press and
radio all over the country, as though the show—crowd saw them
battle for two hours with great howling and screaming until, (when
the panther had chewed off one arm of the gorilla) the show-
owners stopped the battle with a merciful bul.let to the head of
the gorilla. But Life Magazine came out two weeks later, August 8,
1949, (as though bent upon setting a new high mark in truth telling).
with the story that the black panther had annihilated “a small
ill-advised ape” with one swipe——thence, the ape had to be shot.
Meanwhile, both the dailypress and Life Magazine carried pictures
of the black panther with one eye destroyed. No doubt, Life Maga-
zine, (which is setting the pace in degrading the level of American
thinking) is due to display some sort of super-honesty after having
caused most other magazines to increase their appeals to the Sex
Urge in order to hold their circulation; but it is also very raw in
the face of.Life Magazine’s drive to promote the Vatican and to
glorify the newly Rich. Remember the glorified pictures in Life
Magazine of the vast throngs of newly Rich spending their stolen
wealth in Miami, Florida? (See Philip Wylie’s description of'7'.'that
lowest of all American Cities in his Generation of Vipers, pp. 169-
175.) You remember the role of Henry R. Luce in publishing planted
Hitler interviews, just before World War 11, designed to influence
American opinion to the side of Hitler. Also, when you go up to
pay twice as much to send a parcel to hungry people as a year ago-—
just think of how much your post office is losing by delivering
Life Magazine below cost.

(2) The Flying Saucers were at last written off as a “myth” after
two years’ work by the special team of scientific investigators of
the United States Air Force, who called in help from the University
Consultants to track down 375 of the rumors of weird and wondrous
sights in the sky—at an immense cost evidently too ridiculous to
let the public in on—and which Flying Saucers served well to whip
up war hysteria as part of the cold war of Godly Truman and
Company.  a--»~

Thus, we have incontrovertible illustrations of the total depravity
of most headline news. And if they lie so easily and flagrantly
about such simple news, is that not all the greater proof that they
will lie to prove the righteousness of their masters—the N.A.M.,
the Oil Interests, the Munitions Firms, and the Vatican? All know
how they lie about their brand of pills, soaps, prepared foods, quick
biscuits, and the superiority of their special manures, by which
they take the whole world for their oyster. Thus, Moronic values
are put forward with such vehemence, repetition, and volume as to
crowd out all others.

What better can be expected of people who control mass com-
munication? Who controls the Press and Radio?—They who own
them. Who owns them? Not the people, but the conspirators for
World War Three, the enemies of the Race, the American Zaibatsu,
the respectable War Criminals of America!

The report of the Commission of Freedom of the Press, headed

12

 

 

by Robert M. Hutchins, Chancellor of the University of Chicago, is
of such superior authority that I would be foolish to substitute my
own words. Therefore, I report from that Report:

From Page 16: “The right of free expression has lost its earlier
reality . . . The Owners and managers of the press determine which

persons, which facts, which versions of the facts, and which ideas
shall reach the public.”

From Pages 45 and 46: “Big money made in other fields is now
going into communications. . . As compared with fifty years ago, an

increasing sameness appears in news’ stories, photographs, cartoons,
and columns.”

All right then, if the average editor is a man amongst men (as,
no doubt, he loves to think) he has done something somewhere or
sometime that would not look good if placed in large headlines of
his daily paper. Rather, it would injure his reputation and business.
Yet, if a fifteen—year-old genius or child prodigy has an indiscretion,
he will blare it in such details as to destroy the future career of
that child. As to whether such details can be published for money
by anyone other than by a criminal is a question of whether it is
possible for a man to be a buzzard without being a criminal.

I know of a small article written to the Public Forum of the
“Oakland Tribune” demanding that the proposed new public library
should be at least as large and as accessible as the city jail; that
any one of those vacant parking lots uptown could be better used
for the new library than to become occupied by beer parlors and
jewelry stores. But even that small article had to be mutilated and
mislabeled by the “Oakland Tribune.”

The criminal press, and the Thought Controllers of Radio and
Hollywood (also Criminals), not only refuse to report the other
side of important issues, but suppress their own reporters when
they turn in un-wanted facts. Here follow a few samples (of serious
consequences for Mankind) from amongst an overwhelming number
that clamor for presentation: _

1. Thegrial of Cardinal Mindszenty. The controlled press in
“free” America (wn1cT took greaFc‘a!'E'1iot to feature the news that
Reverend Norman Dabbs, a Protestant Missionary to Brazil, was
murdered by a mob aroused by Catholic priests) also took even
greater care to report as the truth all the lies invented by the
hierarchy of Rome, Italy, and run rough—shod over their own report-
ers rather than have them truthfully report the Trial of Traitor
Mindszenty from Hungary. Here follows the repudiation by their
own reporters of the lies originated by the Catholic Hierarchy and
completed by our Cold War Press:

“In view of the untrue reports written and broadcast abroad
about the journalistic coverage of the Mindszenty trial, the
undersigned foreign correspondents wish to state that they
regard these charges as unfounded attacks upon the integrity
of their own reporting and they categorically wish to deny:

a. That censorship of any kind is being exercised upon their

telephonic or telegraphic dispatches;

13

  
 
 
 
 
  
  

 

  

b. That the translation of the trial from‘ Hungarian to their
various languages is inaccurate.

c. That the only correspondents granted visas or admitted to
the courtroom are communists or communist sympa-

   
   

thizers.”

senta ives ﬁjournalism in other co aly,

S land. _

There have been more crocodile tears shed over Cardinal Minds-
zenty than any other traitor lately because there have been more
crocodiles abroad to do the crying.

2. China. Daily, for a long time, longwinded and idoctored stories
came out of China——at the very time that reporters from the United
States. Britain, France, and Holland were unable “to tell the truth
about China as they knew it.” Even when they had been sent to
China at considerable expense and their home-editors accepted their
stories, pronouncing them good, the arteriosclerotic owners of the
pgess, who had the final say, would not allow their reports to be

"firinted. “Many of the stories the papers and magazines refused to

print” are told by Jack Belden in his new book, “Chi kes the
World.” (George Seldes, In Fact, November 28, 1 49.) The re n
given by the owners was that they were not going to print any

“goddamn leftie stuff.” The reason true’ stories out of China were
prohibited to be read by “free” Americans is the same reason as

why General Stillwell was brought home, with a glgsed mouth,

3. There was an -important World'Economic Conference held in
Geneva, Switzerland, in March and pri o , r pres ting the
population of the whole civilized world——-many times the population
of Zaibatsu-controlled U. S. A. Did you see anything of that Confer-
ence in your newspapers? Did you hear anything of that Confer—.
ence over your radios? An American news reporter there in Geneva,
who was noticed to be spending his time hanging around the saloon
enjoying his “American Way of Life,” instead of attending the dis-
cussions, was asked how he hoped to give adequate reports of the

Conference. He_r_ep_li.ed, “Oh, been informed the A 'c
ress does not intend to ub IS v n ws nee.”

4. Did you notice how fishy the reports of the Nuremberg Trial
smelled? Why did not our large Dailies, Weeklies, and Monthlies
publish the background conspiracies of the Vatican with the Hitler-
ites as revealed at the Nuremberg Trial in ’46? Were not they of
as much interest to Americans asother aspects of the Nuremberg
Trial?__In that trial our own War-mongering Press had to be very
careful—why Ribbentrop should have been convicted, and Von

Papen cleared of the same kind of crimes in even greater degree
(which, of course, was because Von Papen had played the Vatican
game); why overwhelming evidence emerged that the Vatican had
been on the side of Hitler all the time and had to be white-washed
by Chief Justice Jackson with an expression of gratitude to the
Vatican. The Criminal Press and the Criminal Radio took great care
to cover up the intestines of the Nuremberg Trial.

5. As everybody knows, the Fascist Traitors who run American
bi—partisan Foreign Policy have performed their most un-American
actions in taking over Churchill’s policy of shooting down such men
in Greece as resembled our own Partisans in our Carolinas of 1780.
(I prove this conclusively in my larger pamphlet.) The Greek
Monarchists troops who helped Hitler are the ones we now support,
and the partisans who took to the hills and helped us fight Hitler
are the ones we now destroy. Yes, the Criminal Press would not
print the pictures of our Monarchist Greek troops in Nazi uniforms
because they are our troops now. That would show whom it
espouses. Yes—Why were “free” Americans not allowed to see these
troops in Nazi uniforms, caught with the goods on ’em?

6. When economists in early 1950 warned that the bi—partisan
program of $20 billion for the Arms Race and the Cold War to
re-arm the Fascists of Europe may ruin the United States, why did
the Criminal Press fail to print it in headlines?——but, instead, altered
it to a mere attack on taxes so that it would more likely be con-
strued against our school taxes, against social security, and against
unnecessary aids to hungry people? Since which we have had the
reduction of the United States postal service.

7. Senator Joseph McCarthy’s charges against Haldore Hanson,
official of the State Department, were published in screaming head-
lines by the criminal press all over the country.

But Haldore Hanson’s capable reply was published over on page
23 of the New York Times and not at all in many of the large papers,
which had featured Senator McCarthy’s lies as God’s truth.

8. When has the criminal press even published anything against
the most powerful and un-American lobby in Washington—the
Vatican lobby working through the K. of C., Catholic War Veterans,
National Catholic Welfare Conference, etc. Or when has it even
exposed how Franco killed Americans in World War II or still
persecutes Protestants in Spain? The criminal press suppresses the
important news instead of publishing it.

Then, there is the positive side to the Thought Control of America
by those who own the means of mass communication. What event?
What Humanitarian policy? What item of human progress has ever
been shoved before people with half the diligence applied to Rita
Hayworth’s marriage?

Says Rev. C. P. Bradley, of Saskatoon, Canada, “Rita Hayworth’s
new husband is the Prince Aly Khan, son of the famous Agha Khan.
Father and son live on the ignorance. superstition, and stupidity of
starving millions of their fellows. . .I have never yet read one
sentence to indicate that Rita is womanly, motherly, intelligent...

15

 

Never has the press praised Rita for fine tastes, fine feelings, or
fine sentiments. All the press ever talks about is Rita’s meat...”

Thus, more attention to the personal love affairs of degenerates
than upon the total welfare of the world, is being forced upon
Americans by her Thought-Controllers in this year, 1950. In 1787,
the American Radicals and “Levellers” (Reds), in three separate
places in our Constitution, sought to forestall such degeneracy by
prohibiting heredity titles from Europe. Now, who are the Traitors
to America?

The number of “Christians” in the U. S. A. is 77 millions. If they
had shaken their fists at their head double-crosser in Washington,
D. C., they could have prohibited this Armament Race and cold
war by sheer force of popular disapproval. They do not appear ever
to have read the general Epistle of Saint James: “Ye ask amiss that
ye may consume it upon your lusts.” (Chapter 4, Verse 3.) They ask
God amiss to stop a World War which they themselves can stop.
They ask God amiss for World Peace that they may consume it
upon the lust of the Standard Oil Company toward all the oil in
Arabia, Iraq, Colombia and Venezuela. They ask God amiss for
World Peace that the American Imperialists may satisfy their lust
for exploitation of Colonial peoples as the British Empire formerly
did. They ask God amiss for World Peach that it may be consumed
upon the lust of our Wall-Streeters for more profits.

Why don’t ye “Christians” read the Epistle of St. James? There is
a communist book for you—it is chock full of subversive utterances.

How can ye Christians brag of your hatred for communism when
your Bible announces——yea emphasizes—-that the first Christians
“had all things in common”?

T e windledom of organized Christianit consists of carrying on
a persis§§EE3Eational program against gugan reas , ' st
belie i cause ande ec a ains e incre ocia now e,
against  hope of Euman geﬁerment Ey rational The
doctrine that prayer an supp ica ion W1 accomp ish things needed

instead of revolutionary knowledge and action is a swindle. This
is well illustrated by the way the California pensioneers depended
too much upon prayer and Divine Aid for their righteous cause and
not enough upon direct-action in line with historical knowledge. The
poor elderly people lost while praying for victory. The corporations
won because they controlled the means of mass-communications
and nobody could effectively spread the knowledge of their decep-

tion and crookedness. Result: forty thous ers 01 re ed

Jefferson and George Mason (great radicals of our Constitutional
era) anticipated, by one hundred and fifty years, the present Reign
of Morons, when they gave their estimate of Alexander Hamilton’s
influence. The colony of New York, which had opposed the idea of
Independence almost up the to the Declaration, had been ocqupied

 

by British troops for several years, and had become the great’

stronghold for Tory influence. Those who had become rich trading
with the enemy (while Washington’s ragged troops were freezing
and starving as at Valley Forge) were to become blessed soon after
the Revolution by means of the leadership of Alexander Hamilton.
It was Hamilton who championed the cause of Tory-traitor-wealth
against the rights of future Americans, under the swindle of Prop-
erty Rights.

Thomas Jefferson and George Mason held that Hamilton was “the
evil genius of America”; that he did the country more harm than
“Great Britain with all her Fleets and Armies.” They held that
“Hamilton was singularly incapable of Americanization .  (because)
...His instincts were soldierly. How he delighted in all military

_ things!”

If you would understand why three gamblers have rated higher
in the steering of these United States, for the last forty years, than
any or all philosophers, than any or all educators, than any or all
searchers for Truth and Knowledge—if you would understand why
it has become a crime to oppose our big criminals by advocating
Peace while they are trying to blackmail the world with the Atom
Bomb—you will do well to look into the Tory—traitor bias given to
American History soon after the Revolution. And you will do well
to go to your nearest large public library, get James Parton’s Life
of Thomas Jefferson, study it, and make copious notes;—for the
Jesuits, sneaking their way into power in such pivotal institutions,
may cause it to disappear altogether, while also using Church
pressure to prevent another edition. .

Now, as for the three gamblers. I am not counting the present
thing in the White House famous for its poker games and capacity
for drinking hard whiskey.

Bernard Baruch is the Wall Street gambler who made twelve to

fifteen million dollars before his forty-second year, at a time when"

twelve millions equalled the purchasing power of forty million now.
Baruch is described by Jimmy Byrnes as “adviser to Presidents...
Although never elected to public office, he has served in key posi-
tions since the First World War.” Great praise is given Baruch for
“his informal advice and assistance, sought by and freely given to
SIX Presidents.” Baruch brags that “during my young days in Wall
Street, I had contact with the older financiers and with the great
railroad barons, the ferocious, cigar-chewing men . . .”

Consequently, today you may hear and read more about the
Baruch Plan for World Peace than any other—-(to serve and save
our Imperialists). Baruch’s 16,000 acre estate in South Carolina is

2

 

called “Hobcaw Barony.” He is eminently qualified to sympathize
with the ex-landlords of Poland, East Prussia, Roumania, and Bul-
garia, whose holdings have been divided up and given back to the
Human Race, by the new Peoples’ Democracies over there.

Cordell Hull is the more famous for his “poker face” and “poker
hands” (as when he fleeced his pals in the Spanish American War)
than for his economic wisdom or application to the study of Political
Philosophy and the Thought Heritage. (In Chapter 22 of Hull’s auto-
biography, “Speaking Terms With Russia,” he repeats over and over
the swindle that Russia refused to pay the Czarist War Debts,
though said swindle was exposed by so conservative a text as the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

In various speeches given by Hull, as for example “Our Foreign
Policy,” 1938, the keynote is “International Order” and “The Prin-
ciples of Order.” Which is to say they were concerned with protec-
tion of Vested Rights (Vested Interests). Imperialism!

Ely Culbertson, the White Russian Cardshark, seems to be an
oracle unto the owners of our Radio Broadcasting Systems. He easily
gets a world-wide audience for his “Peace Plan,” both over the
waves and in the headlines. To be sure, he does not expose the
Criminals who compose “The War Against Russia Party” who
started to conspire for an Atomic attack upon Russia even before
1946.

Why do we simpletons spend our lives studying Sociology, Educa-
tion, Philosophy, History and the Greatest Thinkers of the Ages
that we may stand upon their shoulders to see ahead, when we can
obtain so much more “success” in the world by practicing with a
deck of cards?

Why do the Socratic pursuers of Truth and Social Knowledge
rate so low that they have to take special Oaths of Allegiance to
the dollar-chasers’-scheme-for-America, as witness the dismissal of
professors who dare teach the Truth? Because in an economy which
exalts the dollar-chaser above all other people, the philosopher and
the pursuer of Truth and Knowledge rate lower than whale dust,
which is at the bottom of the ocean!

Dollar—chaser-culture removed the charcoal sketch of the proposed
“One World” mural from the wall of La Guardia Hall, New York
University, for being “vicious Communist propaganda.” Dollar-
chaser-culture rewarded Ezra Pound’s poetry attacking Jews and
“Niggers” (and the American people as a whole) on behalf of Musso-
lini while also saving Ezra Pound from the consequences of treason
of broadcasting over Mussolini’s radio on the grounds of mental
disorder. In Pound’s case the critics proclaimed their concern for
“objective perception of values.” In the case of the One World mural,
where was their concern for objective perception of value?

The constant hammering of lies into peoples’ thought structure
by the Criminal Press, the even more Criminal Radio, and the
Jesuit-censored Movies has brought some people to the condition in

3

 

 

  
  

which they openly brag that they prefer Wall Street lies to Com-
munist truths because Communist truths are always denounced as
Russian. This is notwithstanding that every good thing in America
is communal—-—post offices, public schools, highways, harbors, light
houses, and the very National Domain from which the pioneer pre-
empted his land holdings. This is why our major criminals are
crimin'als—-because they steal, pervert, mutilate, waste, and destroy
that which does not belong to them and which cannot belong to
them because it belongs to mankind. Only the other day a big
timber company stole fifty million dollars worth of timber from
the Quinault tribe on the West Coast (for five and a half million
dollars) through the evident collusion of Secretary Krug.

Why was Congress so quiet about the Ship Steal while pretending
to investigate the 5 Percenters who were bad enough but relatively
small fry? “The U. S. Lines, American Export Lines, and American
President Lines had inveigled the Maritime Commission into con-
structing six passenger and cargo ships for $150 million and selling
them to the three shipping interests for $70 million.”

George W. Armstrong, 84-year-old millionaire, as of October 27,
1949, uses his stolen wealth to promote Fascism to the tune of $50
million bequests to such colleges as will prostitute themselves and
their Charters by teaching un-American doctrines. Americans first
let the resources of this and future generations be stolen, and now
are rewarded by such donations to the cause of Fascism, to destroy
what little Americanism still remains. How heroic Americans are
turning o-ut to be!

But there is an elite who constitute the main line of attack upon
American intelligence and who supply the J esuitic casuistry needed
by our own War Criminals who are conspiring for World War Three!

Westbrook Pegler is the number one intellectual prostitute of
William Randolph Hearst, whose press jumps in with a recantation
for Pegler libels to avoid suit when registered by big people; but
who allows the libels to stand when dealing with those who cannot
afford the cost of litigation to fight back. Westbrook Pegler was
trained in Jesuitry and Anti-Americanism at Loyola Academy,
Chicago, during the formative period of his lopsided intellect. This
possibly accounts for his dancing to the schemings of the,Vatican
in opposition to the philosophy o-f Thomas Jefferson. Pegler’s writ-
ings are not noted for quoting such words as the following (of
Thomas J efferson’s hope for the success of the French Revolution):
“to kindle the wrath of the people of Europe and to bring at length,
Kings, Nobles, and Priests to the scaffolds which they have been
so long deluging with human blood.” Nor may Pegler quote Thomas
Paine’s description of the purpose of reactionaries “to keep up
deceitful expectations which prevent people from looking into- the
defects and abuses of government.” ,

Now remember that America owes more to both Jefferson and
Paine than to any Pope that ever lived or to any kisser of the Pope’s
foot. Selah!

Americans, whom do you choose? The guidance of Thomas Jef-
ferson, Thomas Paine, and Ben Franklin, or the guidance of Jesuit
trained Westbrook Pegler, the number one intellectual prostitute
of William Randolph Hearst?

Rupert Hughes is given a_ballyhoo. He claims “the Hollywood
Industry is Fertile Ground for Communist Infiltration.” Who is
Rupert Hughes? I define Rupert Hughes as that literary skunk who
so studiously directed his stench upon the good name of George
Washington, the father of his country, back in 1926 by means of
his outlandish three volumes’ biography of George Washington.

Americans, whom do you choose? George Washington, the Revo-
lutionist whom the English would have hanged had they captured
him, or Rupert Hughes, the mercenary writer and Fascist propa-
gandist for World War III? Meanwhile, nothing is clearer to the
public than the way the moving pictures have degenerated and
their patronage gone down with a sharp curve because their best
writers and thinkers have been sentenced (contrary to the Bill of
Rights) by our Fascist traitor Courts. (See Thomas Bledsoe’s Hier-
archy Over Hollywood, a truthful record of how the Jesuits have
become the censors of our Movies, to censor them politically while
leaving their lecherousness untouched.)

Now remember-when you censor the Movies of information bear-
ing on social and political progress, you are intensifying their drive
in the opposite direction toward the teaching of criminality on the
on the level of egoism, suicide, and dime-novel murders.

Dorothy Thompson: I take care of that lady in another context
in my larger pamphlet by quoting her about the need for a real
revolution in Germany, when she was more sincere than in her
later palaver.

Claire Booth Luce: That Claire Booth Luce (the wife of a great
conspirator against American freedom) is glamorous, and that she
is energetic (or frisky?) may be conceded, on the basis of her many
trips from America to the Vatican. If one quoted from the French
Revolution or the History of Spain long before Franco, with certi-
tude, about the role of the priests as traitors to Democracy and to
the Working Class, the Church apologists would yell that it was
so long ago that you cannot know which was which. Then they
would imply that the Church must not bear‘ the blame for the
intolerance of those times, which_ is but a Jesuitic trick for saying
that the times have changed and that the people were intolerant
but not the Church. Yet when the Church recently converted the
bereft Congresswoman, Claire Booth Luce, Monsignor Fulton J.
Sheen used the same swindle that the Jesuits used three centuries
ago when they converted Christina, daughter of Gustavus Adolphus,
King of Sweden, Saviour of the Reformation and greatest hero of
the Thirty Years War: “The Jesuits had a great share in bringing
that capricious and haughty woman into the pale of the Roman
Church. . .Macado, confessor to the Portuguese Ambassador at the

5 -

 

Court of Sweden . . . persuaded her to seek rest to her disquieted
mind in the unchanged and unchangeable doctrines of Rome.”
(N icolini’s History of the Jesuits.)

Fulton Lewis, Jr. There are signs that Fulton Lewis, Jr. has just
about woven himself too much rope whose strands are anti-labor
poison, fascist propaganda for the National Association of Manu-
facturers, smears and character assassination of liberals as Well as
downright lies. George Seldes’ In Fact of August 7th, 1950, well
exposes Fulton Lewis, Jr. in an article titled: “Official State Dept.
Documents Showing Fulton Lewis, Jr. as a Hitler Adviser Are
Suppressed.” [By the Criminal Press.] Exposure was by Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey (Democrat of Minnesota) and are in the Con-
gressional Record on pages 10295 to 10298.

Who’s Who In America, 1948 and 1949, reports that at the age of
37, Lewis was “chosen as one of America’s ten outstanding young
men.” Fulton Lewis, Jr. was chosen by whom? Is not that another
example of fellow back-scratching and card-stacking, not too differ-
ent from the fact, for example, that “the Reader’s Digest is not a
digest? The political, anti-labor, reactionary, controversial, and pro-
big-business articles which fill a large part of Reader’s Digest are
nearly always originated by the Digest.” (Se1des’ 1000 Americans,
Page 92.) The National Council of Teachers of English discovered
after years of investigation with hundreds of teachers participating
that the majority of articles in the Digest either originated in the
editorial offices of the magazine or were bought and “planted” in
other magazines, then reprinted.

Judge Pontius Pilate Medina, the Crocodile of Foley Square
infamy, made his first half-million dollars largely by legalistic
swindles of elderly heiresses. One suit (involving a widow from her
77th year, 1919, to her 85th year, 1927) dragged on and on many
times longer than the Foley Square Trial. That suit, as well as the
Trial of the Eleven, presents Judge Medina in such a nauseous
record that one may wonder why such a microbe should be con-
sidered an American at all—let alone its being promoted to sit in
judgment on Americanism.

Medina was a .lawyer of large practice in New York City during

the Judge Seabury Investigation of» the corruption of Magistrates

Courts there. Also, when the Wickersham Commission carried on
its nation-wide inquiry into the crimes committed by our Courts
of Law. Yet he was so dishonest in his conduct of the Trial of Eleven
as to pretend to know nothing of “this business of ‘making arrange-
ments’ ” whereby stool-pigeons are saved from prosecution for their
crimes by bearing false witness against others. '

For details, see the Report of National Non-Partisan Committee
and George Marion’s The Communist Trial, An American Cross-
Roads. ' .

As a parting shot at this thing called “Judge Medina,” it seems
appropriate to inquire: Why does America now place the stool-
pigeon above the law? Why did America continue to place the
stool-pigeon above the law after publishing the Reports of the
Wickersham Commission and the Seabury Investigation? An old

lady, 88 years of age, substantially blind and deaf, of good character,
recently was kept in jail four days on the charge of stealing a cube of
butter upon the word of one “special officer,” without trial, her word
against his—in Oakland, California, the United States of America!

On the political side, all a stool-pigeon has to do is to parade as
an ex—communist (now redeemed by the Pope of Rome) and he
immediately becomes above the law. In May of 1949 a judge refused
to allow the return of stool-pigeon Hewitt to the state of Washington
to be tried for swearing a LIE against Melvin Rader, professor of
Sociology.

Emperor Douglas MacArthur of Japan plays an important role
to prevent honest examination of American Imperialism. His ego
is taking on the proportions of a new Sun—God Emperor. How else
can you explain why that a Japanese publisher was given a two
year prison sentence for publishing an item of the Communist
Trial Swindle under Medina at Foley Square? How else can you
explain why Industrial Unions were even barred before the Korean
War from striking against the To-Shiba Monopoly as “interference
with the occupation?” Of course, there is an alternative answer—
MacArthur’s Fascist record in bayonet charging against the jobless
Veterans March on Washington in 1932, and the fact that To-Shiba
Monopoly is 28'}? owned by our own Wall Street Thieves.

Watch out, you jobless, homeless, houseless, loveless, swindled
G.I.’s. If the Republicans get in power, the New Sun God Emperor
will be brought home from Japan to herd you around at the poin
of the bayonet. “

Tom Clark, late of the National Malfeasance Department, called
“Justice,” now on the Supreme Court. What motive did the Pender—
gaster have for appointing him to the highest court of the land?
Just as Truman has given lip service to a few progressive measures
while traitorously appointing their worst enemies to carry them
out, so does he appoint the oily conspirator against The Bill of
Rights to sit in judgment upon those who have the greatest need
for the protection of The Bill of Rights.

You, who have studied, know that ever since John Marshall's
victories (for evil) over Jefferson (in the case of Marbury vs.
Madison and the Impeachment Trial of Justice Samuel Chase) the
Supreme Court has been the greater law—making body while the
lunatic talk—fests of Congress have stood as mere ante-rooms to the
inner chambers. Because of the actions of such Criminals as ex-
Representatives Thomas of the Un-American Committee,_now in
prison for petty stealing, and Tom Clark, the Un-American Attorney
General, it has become a stigma to be known as “being for Civil
Rights.”

Back in 1937, the Texas Senate Committee found that Clark had
“experienced a tremendous and startling increase in earnings” after
his law partner became state attorney general. The Committee was
not satisfied with his answers and “adopted a resolution censuring
him for not being willing and eager to make a full disclosure of his
financial affairs.” (People’s World, August 5, 1949.) What kind of
financial affairs.”

Senator Joe McCarthy. A study of the history of Senator McCar-
thy’s educational make—up shows that his lopsided intellect (like
Westbrook Pegler’s) was formed by the Jesuits. His very charges
against people who were fair toward the Chinese people, versus
Chiang-Kai-Shek, were the product of his collaboration with a
Jesuit of Georgetown University. Yet, where is there a simpleton
who dares argue that Senator Joe McCarthy is a better American
than General Stillwell? If General Stillwell told the truth, then
Senator McCarthy lies. If General Stillwell is a good American then
Senator McCarthy is the traitor. As it stands today, Senator McCar-
thy has become the J esuitic technician of reaction, who makes false
charges so fast and furious that his victims cannot state their cases
before the public has rushed to swallow a new lie—about somebody
else, more congenial to radio-newspaper mentality than reading im-
portant background data that would automatically explode his lies.

A recent U. S. official count shows Germany still 85”/« Nazi.
Hence, as to be expected, Senator McCarthy, (promoted by the
Black Internationale of Rome) now stands out for re-armament of
Germany, as does Emperor MacArthur for Japan.

Victor Riesel is rapidly gaining notoriety by attacking Reds! His
articles are of the direct lying sort of propaganda here considered
as of January 12, 1948, titled “Comrades Handing Down New Line
on Labor Strife—Priest Baiting.” Riesel says that the Association
of the Catholic Trade Unionists (ACTU) is not conspiring with
Rome, to say so is “re1igion-baiting.” Victor Riesel is making too
sure a bet that people have read no history nor may ever—whence
his lies. What about that Nazi-like string of violent actions (in this
land of the “free”) by Catholic Veterans Organizations against
pickets whom they accuse of being Communist?-——which infamous
and un-American actions had their certain start from the Pope’s
call to action in a speech, September 7, 1947, wherein the Pope
urged them that “the time for reflection and planning is past . . . now
is the time for action,” said the Pope. There you have the command
to Americans from a foreign power to go into action. The Associated
Press report of the Pope’s spiel says: “When the Pontiff appeared,
carried aloft on his gestatorial chair, a great roar arose. Cries of
‘Viva il Papa!’ mingled with heavy tolling of the bells of St. Peter.”
(Why is it that only proletarian speakers are called rabble-rousers?)

No doubt, you have noticed the resemblance of the vast throngs
assembled to hear the Pope to those who used to hear Mussolini.
You were right, for the simple reason that they are the same people.

The greatest proof that the Pope is a rabble-rouser is revealed by
taking a look at the political map of Italy. The better educated,
more socially enlightened cities of Northern Italy are largely against
the Pope and for Communism. The masses of Southern Italy an
the black hand assassins of Sicily (who have been kept illiterate
and as dirt under the Pope’s toe nail) give the Pope greater sup-

ort. Thirty-six labor leaders had been assassinated in Sicily in
eighteen months, ending July, 1948, without any action being taken
by the government. Such is the pleasure of the Pope and the glory
of his God, who more likely is the Devil.

When the 800 Catholic Actionists did their stunt of parading and
picketing the Cultural and Scientific -Conference for World Peace
at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (March of 1949), they certainly dis-
played the hand that pulled the strings. The cameramen had a
field day because the parade had not been sufficiently rehearsed.
“God~ damn it! Kneel down! Show grief! Pray! Kneel, damn it!
Kneel down Pray” Such were the raucous commands of the camera-
men to the paraders to get pictures to prove that the Catholic
Actionists were against the Peace Congress because the lying press
and the Pendergast gangster had labelled it “Communist Inspired.”

Now versus such Fascist drivellers as Westbrook Pegler, Rupert
Hughes, and Victor Riesel, let us hear the objective truth from a
real American who had as much claim to being the first American
Revolutionist, the founder of the United States, as any man, and
who became the second P ' John s:

“The Great of State and Church have a ored, in all ages, to
wrest from the populace, as they are contemptuously called, the
knowledge of their rights and wrongs, and the powers to assert the
former or redress the latter.”

“The most refined, sublime, extensive, and astonishing constitu-
tion of policy that ever was conceived by the mind of man was
framed by the Romish clergy for the aggrandisement of their order.
All the epithets I have here given to the Romish policy are just,
and will be allowed to be so when it is conside d that they even
persuaded mankind to believe, faithfully and 1' doubtingly, that
God Almighty had entrusted them with the ‘s to Heaven, whose
gates they might open and close at pleasu _ ith a power of pro.-
curing or withholding the rain of Heaven and the beams of the
sun; with the management of earthquakes, pestilence . . . and famine;
nay, with the mysterious, awful, incomprehensible power of creating
out of bread and wine the flesh and blood of God Himself. All these
opinions they were enabled to spread and rivet among the people
by reducing their minds to a state of sordid ignorance and startling
timidity and by infusing into them a religious horror of letters
and knowledge. Thus was human nature chained fast for ages in
a cruel, shameful, and deplorable servitude to the Pope, and his
subordinate tyrants.”

Was John Adams a priest-baiter? No. The truth is the trutg pd
John am y a ru e e T e new t at peo ee ed
th ,» it. Today they still need the
truth but do not want it because they hate _it worse than death
itself. The fact is, John Adams was not :5 priest-baiter because he
promoted truth to oppose fakers, but Westbrook Pegler, Victor
Riesel, and Rupert Hughes are Red-baiters, because they promote
falsehoods to delay progress.

Americans, whom are you to follow, the political philosopher,
scholar, and co-founder of the United States, John Adams, or the
mercenary writers and Fascist propagandists for World» War Three?

Jacques Maritain is that reactionary French Philosopher and
Church“'conspirator whose books are circulated oftener from many
of our Public Libraries than the writings of Jefferson, Madison, and
