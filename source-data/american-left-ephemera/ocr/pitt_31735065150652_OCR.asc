are modern, decent houses for

some of the miners and their

families. For this, the workers
can thank a community move-
tmentthat was started and sup-

ported by their union, Local‘

915, Mine-Mill.
A year ago, 18 families in

"Sonora were homeless. The

Kennecott open pit ‘had swal-
lowed up their houses, or Wa
about to swallow them. v '

\ . . .
The homeless fa1n1l1es_wer£-\

doubled up withfriends or were

living out in the open. One‘
7 family’ with seven childrenlhad

a two-roomishack so small there
‘Was no room for beds, so they
"slept outside. V

THERE WERE houses avail-»

able half a mile away in Ray.
‘ But this is. another’ company-
oW11ed-toWn, and the company

enforcedr a rigid segregation-1
iAnglos in Ray, people of Mexi-

canidescent in ‘Sonora. .
;SoiLocal 915 called meetings.
They v‘;  invited representatives
organizations,
. businessmen, men’s clubs, ladies’.
"clubs, ladies’
church groups -in both -Ray and
Sonora. V  committee was elect-
ed, representing nearly gall or-
ganizations. A program of de-

mands" was adopted.

FIRST DEMAND was hous-

ilies. ‘

SECOND DEMAND was for

A relatively healthy demand
for copper and lead prevailed
in markets  recent weeks while

zinc, despite higher imports and 4

growing stocks, remained stable,
Improved foreign demandfor
popper and lead, __plus much
lower U. S. mine production
4‘ Werethe main reasons for the
steady tone in these markets.
Foreign supplies, which until re-
-cently were flowing into U. S.
"markets, are now being shipped
abroad in greater volume. To
some extent, this isrelieving
pressure on U. S. markets.
Recent developments in ma-
jor non-ferrous metals include:

000 tons of copper in April‘. This
was the largest amount..of cop-
per sold by refineries since last
December, although shipments
were ‘still nearly 14%. below
those of a year, ago. -1

Total imports of copper in all
forms dropped '15,000 tons in
March from February. In the

first three months of this year, '

total imports werendown 28%
from the same period of last
year.

Substantial improvement ‘in
foreign markets for lead re-
sulted in more Mexican lead be-
ing shipped abroad, and reduced
pressure on U. S. markets.

U. S. imports ofléad in all’

forms for the first three
months of 1954 were 90,203
tons, as compared with 156,631
tons in the same period of 1953

ZINC ‘ p
,The price of zinc remained
steady at .10}/ic a pound, despite
only moderate domestic‘ sales
and a big jump in recent im-
ports. * ‘ ' \
Zinc alone, of the three base
metals, showed a big increase
inimports to a total of ,57,4’70'
tons in March. This, was an in-
crease of 17,000 tons over the
previous month and the largest
imports reported in many
months. -\ . »
Die casters were buying fairly
good quantities of special high

»WASHlNGTON—-The‘ two anti-labor bills sent to
Congress by Atty. Gen. Herbert Brownellon behalf of
the Eisenhower administration and immediately intro-

‘duced by Sen. Homer Ferguson (R., Mich.) are more
i extreme than the Butler bill.

, One would allow the gov-

ernment to dissolve any union‘ almost at will.

They are the product, not of McCarthy, Butler and
' Goldwater, but of the so-called Eisenhower—Brownell

faction. This gives themadded prestige. Democrats also
have given indications they may go along with the

‘? measures.

Labor representatives agreed that only an all-out

mobilization could guard against a blitz to push the {bills

through during the closing

Congress. \

weeks of this session of

Analysis of the measures shows that though they
" are’ being presented to the public -and'legis,l_ators as a
means of “combatting communism at home,” they

acpially would deprive U. S.
working men of hardwon free-
doms and could take away the
very rightto exist from any-_
union.

-Firing without cause__
The first measure, entitled‘by

V, Brownell The Defense Facili-

-ties Protection Act of 1954 and
introduced by Ferguson as S-

53428, extends the socalled atom-
';ic energy formula to all key

industries, allowing the govern-
ment to fire any’ worker whois

. fingered by ananonymous stool-

pigeon. ‘ g ' H
1 The bill would give the Presi-

I dent power -to declare an emer-

gency if he thinks any “sub-

7versive activity” or “disturb-

ance” is threatened and fire
anybody the. government desires
from his job in industry. 

I The bill provides that .the per-

Peon’ fired must benotified and

may"demand a hearing within
15 days after being fired. But

‘I the victim need not be con-

fronted. by his accuser.

 Brownell in a statement on
this bill made much of "the fact

i j that if‘ a worker is fired and

‘later cleared by a_ hearing
board, he is ‘entitled to full back
‘pay. He does’ not explain how
a worker fired" and then not
cleared is going to earn a liv-
ing, ‘after his; livelihood has
been taken from him by secret
informers. ‘

. Like McCarran act‘

The other bill was entitled
the Communist Infiltrated Or-
ganization Act of 1954 by the
Justice Dept., which wrote it
with White House approval, and
‘was introduced by Sen. Homer
Ferguson (R. Mich.) as S 3427.

 _It reaffirms many of the evil

features of the McCarran in-
ternal security law of 1950,

‘ commonly known as-the-police

‘state act, intensifies the speed
with hich the ghvernment can
act against victims and makes
it specifically applicable to un-
ions. ‘ ” ‘
It provides that “whenever”
the attorney general shall have
reason to believe that any for-
ganizatiorl is a Communist in-
filtrated organization” he shall
file with the Subversive Activi-
ties Control Board a petition
asking such a finding and or-
dering the board to take “ap-
propriate action to liquidate and
to wind up” the affairs of‘ the
.organization “expeditiously” if
it is found “guilty.” -
,After finding an organization

, is “Communist infiltrated,” the‘

board may order it “and any of

_. its component parts to, take the
‘ necessary steps to dissolve, li-

quidate and wind up its affairs

A expeditiously.” \.

WASHINGTON (FP) — In 8.

the Senate -handed Pres. Eisen-
hower the worst legislative de-
feat of his administration by
voting 50 to 42 to recommit the
administration’s unionbusting
amendments to the Taft-Hartley
law.

All 48 Democrats were on
hand for the showdown which

rcame on a/motion by Sen. Lis-

ter Hill (D. Ala.) to return the
bill to the labor, committee for
further study. This, in effect,
means’ the death for the dura-

. doesn't know law

The NLRB counsel. James
oley. showed in the course of

the board hearing on Mine-Mill ll

that-The does not know the Na-
./tional Labor Relations Act as

ber of our union, even though
_ this is the law‘ which “he is sup-
posed to be working _uncler.

After making an attack on the '

membership because they -stick
with the union that gives them,
in his own words, "higher wages
and better living conditions," he
w,ont off on, another tack and
, accused the union of. getting
workers tired "if they don't go
along with union policy." .
."They speak to the employer

and get rid of the opposition," ‘

sdid. the Tait-Hartley expert,
"especially)whero ‘they have I
union shop.". \
»_ ‘ Mr. Foley does not even seem
‘to know that under TaffJHorI'ley
no union can bring about anem-
ployee's dismissal except for one

reﬁson. non_-payment of dues.’

The_Tu~ﬂ'-Hartley Act was written '
to protect company stooges and

union-busters within ‘the plant. .

and to give‘ lawyers‘ like Foley
u iob. , .

Mine-Mill as a guinea pig in a

scheme to destroy union bar-

gaining rights. « v ‘
And the , company * lawyer,

B‘/arnabas Sears, sits at the table ,

with Mr. Foley as a “friend of
the court” and ‘runs the ,Boa1fd’s

case in whispered""instructiolns'

to the Board counsel! .

didate and as a secessionist,
was also called butafter the
/badshowing Mason made under

Nat ;Witt’s cross-examination,~

McLean was promptly excused
by the Board and left town just
as promptly. .

Eckert is the star witness,

He’s an old hand by now at the
stool-pigeon game; this is the
fifth time he’s. played _the
bosses’ game with perjury on
the, witness stand. But this

time’ he has a new twist, new at B

, least-for him. , _ l V _T .
*,ECKERT is"'now unveiled as

‘an expert in somethihg called’
VAesopian' language, a languages
,/ that only Communists are sup-’

i posed to understandand which
they use in order to cover ‘up
their real aims and purposes.

The beaiity of ,‘this_/language"

is that it doesn’t appear in any
grammar or dictionary. All you
need is an unprincipled political
degenerate like Eckert to trans-
late_English into Aesopian and
back again, and no -one can con-

tradict him because ‘,he’s the‘

only one who knowsthe lan-
guage. _i ‘

"Higher wages" really
means "lower wages"

' Thus, Eckert testifies that in
Mine-Mill’s Aesopian language
“-black” means “white” and

“night” niedns 5‘dayf’; “higher
‘ ‘wages’: really means “lower
wages”; and “union democracy” 

HIER
; WAGES

 
 

  

“DOWN

   

- really means “overthrowin_g.the

government by force and vio-

lence.” He knows this “because —'

hewent to school in Moscow in
1933.” ‘
This sounds unreasonable and
even insane, in 20th century
America. And it is unreason-
able -and "insane. But behind
the insanity is a very sinister
reasoning; it is the bnly way the

. fear-ridden. fat cats can figure

to"prove_’so,mething which is im-
possible: namely, that all of

Mine-Mill’s members" knew that ,

~'Travis had signed a false affi-
davit in 1949, and that Travis

* admitted it. ‘

IF .HE DIID-N’T admit it in

-English—which he did11’t+_then" .

maybe he admitted it in Aeso-
pian language. And since all of
Mine-Mill’s members understand
Aesopian, which they learned in
some mysterious
Aesop’s Fables, they were in-on
the secret. This is the “logic”
of the NLRB case -7- a logic
which can’t be found outside of
“Alice in Wonderland.”
matter of fact, this case should
go d wn in history as “Mine-
Mill in Eckert’s _Wonderland'.”

A How M-M chains members

At times Eckert put aside his
private language‘ and charged
off in other directions. For
example, at one. point he forgot

the Labor Board’s theory that“-

ST. LOUIS, Mo. — Board

about the Taft’-Hartley affida-
vit ‘he signed" last year. All

questions were related. to. the

affidavit, and seemed to be di-
rected to develop testimony to

g the’ effect that’ "the affidavit.-.

was false,

It was clear from the begin-’

ning that an attempt was being
made to force Wampler to make
a» ‘case against himself; On ad-

‘-vice of his attorney, Wampler
""in_voked—his privilege under the ‘
. Fifth Amendment to the Con-,

stitution.

‘After his ‘testimony on "May

NCOUVER, B. C.--Last
January when Mine-Millv‘;.told_
the minister of labor, Hon. Mil-
ton Gregg, that unemployment
was climbing to the 750,000
mark, the politician was quite
caustic in his remarksrabout
“exagxg-eration," and ridiculed
the suggestion that improve-
ment to the situation as it ex-
isted then was not in sight.

On May 6 it Wasirevealed by s
"Opposition L e a.d e 1' George

Drew,="(Conservative) that the
figure at that date, according
;to . government. statistics, was
770,000, which, in a country of

15 million, Drew said, consti-
 tutes “a degree , of I unemploy-
ment we can _no longer ignore.”

 Drew charged that the gov-
ernment failed-, to rea’d..its own
figures, 3a fact known '-three‘
months ago’ to the Mine’-Mill
delegates 1 who were rebuffed
by Gregg. So;far no‘ one how-

v ever has made the sugigestion’

' that the better.~iiiformed' trade
