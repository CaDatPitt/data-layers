there is no serious intention of carrying out this program, "

  

 

 

Making’ a’ gesture in keeping with the shameless dema;
gogy used by the Democratic Party during the election cam-
paign, the Democrats introduced the Wagner bill in the

if ' recent session’ of Congress. This bill which would have pro?’

vided the barest pittance for the unemployed, has been
‘thrown into the wastebasket on the grounds that “it would

 

cause a drain on federal ﬁnances.” (Statement of Mr. Rai,-.
ney, Democratic leader—New York Evening Telegram, March
1, 1933.) ‘ ‘ ‘

 
 

, This again reveals the kind of “new deal” that the “for- .

gotten man” mayexpect from the Democratic Congress: ‘

 The farm loan banks, which are supposed to assist the
farmers, make loans not to the impoverished farmer, who
is mortgaged to the limit and cannot therefore provide the

l security demanded, but to the wealthy farmerr. The Red .’

Cross, which distributes government owned supplies of cot- 
ton and ﬂour, refuses to use ‘these as relief to the unem-
ployed, but instead pays out these supplies as part of the.
wages to the workers employed in private enterprises in the ’

South_ (Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky miners). ,
The billion dollar subsidies to the bankers and corporations

 

and the millions returned as tax refunds to the rich are con-_ ' I
‘vincing proof that the government of the United States is

not acting in the interests of the working class, but in the
interests of the capitalists.

This is not all. On the specious argument of economy, the .
federal, state and municipal governments are discharging

hundreds of thousands of workers, cancelling practically all

building projects, and cutting wages. Thousands of schools a

have closed up; the school rooms are crowded; the attend-

ance is declining; the health of the children, as a result of

the conditions in the homes and schools, is seriously‘affected;
lunches are not being provided for them in adequate meas-
ure; the teachers are overworked; their salaries have been
cut. The whole educational system of the country is in
danger.

The appropriations of the States and municipalities have ‘

dropped on the score that there were no funds. Under the

12

  

 

 

  

threat of the bankers, a program of economy was and is
, being put through. These bankers, particularly in New

York, threatened to make no further. loans unless there were

Wage slashes, etc., which would enable the city to cut the,tax-
‘ rates. Under the leadership of the same Charles Mitchell’ _ .
' who has ﬁlched tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes‘ '

from the government, the Wall Street bankers dictated to
the ‘Tammany government of New York (which accepted their

“recommendations”) to cut wages, fire thousands of workers’

and reduce relief.

FAKE CONSTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITY RACKETS

T Drives for emergency relief, community chest, ‘and block
aid campaigns, the latter supported. by J. P. Morgan and

V» Norman Thomas alike, have been conducted in the shops,

factories, ofﬁces and stores, the workers being’ compelled to

contribute on pain of losing their jobs. In many instances

the “contributions” have simply been extracted from the
pay envelopes- City employes were intimidated into making

_ donations. This was the process of having the “poor take

care of the poor,” of “sharing the suffering with the jobless,”
and‘of "helping to maintain the income of the rich intact.
Reliefagencies admit that increasing unemployment and the
lowered living standards of the workers are reducing the
revenues from such campaigns and that they are" powerless
to meet the relief demands made upon them. .

A The hundreds of millions of relief that have been raised
have not reached the unemployed. Not only are there mil-
lions of unemployed throughout the country who are receiv-

’ ing. no relief——according to Senator Wagner “4,750,000 fam-

ilies are living in destituti0n”———but those receiving relief do
not obtain suﬂicient to maintain themselves and their fam-
ilies. ¢In~ most places single men get no relief whatever.
Negro and foreign-bornworkers are discriminated against.

” The ‘amount of relief is totally insuﬂicient. According to
A Grace Abbott of the United States Childrens Bureau, from
. $7.50 to $10 is required per -week for a family of ﬁve for

food alone. Nowhere in the country is there such a relief
budget.

fraction of the unemployed are receiving any relief. Thus,

_ according to report of Relief Director Ballinger of Detroit, M 0' ‘V’
~  "only 10 per cent of the 350,000 unemployed there are receiv-, :_ J ’
1 king relief. (Detroit News, February , 1933).

_ It islwell known -that in the large cities, New York, Chi-,  
'cagp, Philadelphia, St. Louis, ‘etc. politicians put their rel-. ’,

‘atives and political friends on the relief list, just as they
put them into relief jobs. Employed office holders have been

found on the relief lists. Relief funds were used for election-

purposes in New York City in the last presidentialelections.
In connection with the Community chests, Mr. Hurlin of
the Russell Sage Foundation states: “I estimate that about

 25 per, cent of the total budgets of these chests would repre-
’ sent actual relief disbursements.” We ask: where does the

rest of the money go? Does graft account for the balance?
Refusing to meet the needs of the situation, the employers

and the government have recognized no limits in their ruth- ‘

less treatment of the unemployed. In an eﬁort to avoid even
the hungry doles, they have deliberately broken up homes.

They take children from their parents and put them into  "l

institutions. They refuse relief to the small homeowner who

cannot meet his taxes, on the ground that he is an “owner.” *

They deny relief to a family that owns a piece of furniture,

demanding that the family be ﬁrst reduced to pauperism. ' ,
“Good” Christian gentlemen, who rail at the radicals, are ’

demolishing the American home.

The share-the-work plan approved by the government, the
leaders of the American Federation of Labor and of the
Socialist Party, was inaugurated under the leadership of
Walter Teagle, President of the'Standard Oil Company of
New Jersey. He claims he has “put 5,000,000 men back to
Work.” This recalls the drive of the American Federation of

. Labor and American Legion to secure 1,000,000 jobs, yet‘
, M the number of unemployed has increased steadily.

PREFACE

On March 6, the letter printed in this pamphlet was
presented to President Roosevelt, through his secretary,
Mr. Howe, by a delegati-on of the National Conference of
the Unemployed Councils. ‘Since that time, the attacks
against the workers and toiling farmers by the United States
government, based upon legislation introduced directly by
Roosevelt, have clearly shown the meaning of the “new deal.”

The closing of the banks, the economy bills at the expense
of the’ government employes and veterans, the so-called farm
relief bill, the inflation measures, the military forced labor
camps for the young workers, the wage cuts, the industrial

recovery bill which will establish conditions, hours and wages »

in the shops against which the workers will have no appeal,
the coming sales taxes, show the real position of Roosevelt.

The United States Congress passed the $500,000,000 relief
bill, which proves that the government does not intend to
provide for the unemployed. The $3,300,000,000 public works
program has as its first provision the building of war vessels,
while the government talks “peace” and disarmament.

On the other hand, -the government continues to give sub-
sidies to the banks and corporation. It has allowed Morgan
and other billionaires to escape paying taxes.

‘The situation of the workers -has become worse since the
inauguration of Roosevelt. Having given him a “chance,” we
ﬁnd, in spite of the ballyhoo, that few workers have returned
to work. The number of unemployed has increased and their
situation has become more desperate. The cities refuse to
grant sufficient relief. Millions of workers have to go without.
The attacks on the workers multiply. What is our answer?
We must strnggle—or we will be crushed.

Unemployment insurance at the expense of the employers
and the government is the immediate need of the Working
class. The Unemployed Council, building up the united front
of all workers, is inaugurating a campaign to win social and
unemployment z'nsurance——through mass pressure to force the
enactment of the Workers Social and Unemployment In-
surance Bill.

 

for ‘Unemployment and Social Insurance at the expense of the
employers and the government. The rank and ﬁle of the

' A. F. of L. are suffering from unemployment. as are

the other workers. They are unable to pay their dues and
assessments and are being expelled from their unions. The
leaders, on the other hand, continue to take high salaries,

. at the same time cooperating with the employers in reduc-

ing the wages and conditions of the workers in the shops

and mines.

‘To this situation facing the toiling masses of this country,
capitalist terror is no answer. The contemptible, infamous
attack of the Hoover administration on the veterans in Wash-
ington on July 28, 1932, which evoked no criticism from the

V A then Democratic presidential canditate, Mr. Roos-evelt, did not
‘ settle the question of the bonus. The police attacks on the,

workers in the cities, ﬁghting for relief and against evictions
do not settle the question of hunger. The police terror against
the National Hunger March in Washington on December 4,

5, 6, did not stop the struggle for relief and insurance. The ‘
 terror against the farmers ﬁghting against foreclosures and

for relief, and the Ku Klux Klan and government terror

" ‘ , against the Negro masses do not settle the farming and Ne-
’ gro questions. ‘Terror is a weapon in the hands of the ruling

class, but it will notllceep the workers from struggle.
WORKERS MAKE IMMEDIATE ‘DEMANDS

We reiterate, therefore, the demands of the workers of this
country placed before the Democratic Congress on December
6, 1932. These demands are so much more imperative in view
of the rapidly worsening situation; the breakdown of the local
and State relief agencies, as admitted by the Mayors and
Governors; and the fact that the federal gooernmentis the
only body able to provide; relief and insurance for all worle
ers throughout the country. In the name of the American

working class we, the “forgotten man,” demand the “new ,

deal.”
. Empowered as we were on December 6, .1932, we are em-
powered again today to place before you, as Chief Executive

of the United States government, the demand then presented,

20

 

 

 

l  

 

as the necessary immediate steps to preserve the ‘lives of. tens
of millions of men, women, and children:

1. Immediate direct federal emergency cash relief
appropriation of $50 for each unemployed and part time
worker, man or woman,'without discrimination, plus $10

' for each dependent, in addition to local relief.

2. Immediate enactment of a system of federal Unem-
ployment and Social Insurance by the goveriunent
through taxes upon wealth and income and the ‘diversion
of all present appropriations for war purposes to relief
and insurance. The Unemployment and Social Insurance T
Bill shall embody the following provisions: .

a) Unemployment and social insurance for each
worker, irrespective of nationality, color, age, sex or
‘ political opinion, when incapacitated for work for reas-

ons beyond his or her control, whether for unemploy- ,

ment, part time work, .sickness, accident, maternity, 4 i

or old age. 3.

Adopted at the Conference Called by the A. F. of L. Committee for Unemployment
Insurance, at Cincinnati in November, 1932

WORKERS’ UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL ,

That a system of federal government unemployment insurance be immediately
established by an act of Congress and made immediately effective, guaranteeing
the average wages in the respective industries and territories in the United States.
The unemployment insurance shall not be less than $10.00 weekly for adult
workers, $3.00 for each dependent, to all workers wholly unemployed through no
fault of their own, for the entire period of unemployment.

For all workers, no disc1:imination——That unemployment insurance be paid to
every‘ unemployed worker, adult, and youth, whether industrial or agricultural,
oﬁce employees, and all other categories of wage labor, native or foreign-born,
citizen or non-citizen, white and Negro, men and women, and without discrimina-
tion against race, color, age or political opinion. No worker shall be deprived of
unemployment insurance because of refusal to take the place of strikers or to
work for less than union rates of pay.

Insurance at the expense of the employers and the government-—That the full
funds for unemployment insurance shall be raised by the government from funds
now set aside for war preparations and by taxation upon incomes over $5,000 a
year. In no instance shall there be any contributions levied upon the workers in
any form whatsoever for this insurance.

Administration by the workers—That the unemployment insurance fund shall be
administered and controlled by the workers through unemployment insurance com-
missions composed of rank and file members of workers’ organizations. That un-
employment insurance commissions be empowered to establish free employment
exchanges for the registration of the workers, the payment of unemployment
insurance, the hearing of contested claims for unemployment insurance and
appeals from awards made.

For other forms of social insurance-—That social insurance be paid to workers
to the amount not less than $10.00 weekly for adult workers, $3.00 for each
dependent to compensate for loss of wages through sickness, accident, old age,
maternity, etc. ,

Part time workers shall receive the difference between their wages and
the unemployment insurance beneﬁt. No worker shall be disqualiﬁed from receiving
unemployment insurance because he refuses to work at wages below what he was

formerly receiving or below the prevailing trade union rates in that vicinity, nor"

shall he or she be disqualiﬁed for refusing to work because of strike or unsafe or
unhealthful conditions, not where hours are longer than the usual trade union
standards in the particularitrade or locality.

An employee shall not be required to accept employment if the establishment
where employment is olfered is at an unreasonable distance from his or her home.

MAKE THE DEMOCRATS KEEP THEIR
PROMISES

(Statement Presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
March 6, 1933)

Franklin D. Roosevelt, '
President of the United States,

A White House,

Washington, D. C.

We herewith submit:

The demands of the unemployed of the United States, as
adopted in Conference on the Washington—Baltimore highway
on December 5, 1932, by the three thousand delegates to the
National Hunger March, elected by unemployed councils, trade
unions of the American Federation of Labor, Railroad
Brotherhoods, Trade Union Unity League and Independent
Unions, and other workers’ organizations, representing the
needs and interests of the masses of this country.

The demands of the unemployed were placed before the gov-
ernment of the United States in December, .1931 and again
on December 6, 1932. The answer of the government in both
cases was police terror.

WHO IS THE “FORGOTTEN MAN”

Mr. Roosevelt, as candidate of the Democratic Party,
during the election campaign you made liberal pledges to
the “forgotten man.” Who is the “forgotten man?” He is
among:

The 17,000,000 unemployed sulfering misery and star-

‘ vation in a land of plenty;
The millions of part-time workers, whose situation, ac-
cording to the Illinois Department of Labor “constitutes

a problem quite as serious as complete unemployment,”

because of the small number of hours that these workers

are allowed to work and their miserable Wages;
The more than 3,000,000 working women, who are un-

able to ﬁnd work; V

3

 

 

The millions of Negroes, Jim-Crowed and discrimi-
nated agaitnst whose lot is the most miserable at all
times, and now h.as become desperate;

The nearly 2,000,000 unemployed exservicemen, who
have been denied‘ the adjusted compensation and whose
disability allowances are being cut;

The nearly 2,000,000 homeless-‘men, women,‘ and youth,
who are abandoned by society, driven out of their homes
by hunger, and whom the government now intends to
impress into the army to prepare them for use against
the unemployed and employed workers who struggle
against hunger, and for use in war; . /

The 14,000,000 children of the unemployed in the United
States;

The millions of impoverished Negro and white farmers

wWl10 are losing their last belongings.

The hundreds of thousands of “white collar” workers,
office workers, engineers, technicians, teachers, profes-
sors, artists, musicians, who are penniless and starving— ‘

These are the “forgotten man,” who was told during the.

election campaign that “no one shall suﬁer from hunger or

cold,” and who was promised “unemployment insurance.” On

the basis of these rosy promises, the masses of workers and
farmers of the United States voted for the Democratic Party,
in the hope that the Democratic Party would give them a
“new deal.” .

Since November, the Democratic Party has been in control
of the country. ‘Not only did it control the United States
Congress, but also at least 38 States. Although the situa-
tion has become progressively Worse, the Democratic Party
has done m'/rtzcally nothing to alter it and to help the millions
of unemployed. This is a clear indication of what th'e election
promises meant—a, bait for votes, but nothing more.

Since the elections, one more million have been added to
the army of unemployed. ’

NO END OF CRISIS IN SIGHT

The decline in employment has gone forward at breaknecl<
speed. Although “optimistic” predictions were made by those

4

\

I

:/7’ _‘\._"/-V‘/;.... . .

 

  
  
    
 

  

 

whose business it is to spread “optimism,” employment de-'
‘ clined 3.9 per cent in January, while wagesdropped 5 per
cent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The steel -'
industry, the basic industry of the country, is working at

only 1'7 per cent of capacity; the building construction in-

dustry is almost at a stadstill. ‘The auto industry is operat- -

ing at about 15 per cent of capacity, while there is pract-_

ically no railroad and shipbuilding construction. Mining is

continually on the decline. The best index of the situation_is

' the power industry, which today is at almost the lowest level

since the beginning of the crisis, the end of which on one
——not even the astute “optimists” or their agents——dare pre-
dict. The crisis is not at an end; there is no upward turn.

Capitalism is in the midst of its basic crisis, and the captal— ‘

ists are seeking methods to escape the burdens by thrusting
them onto the shoulders of the laboring masses. ‘

In the period since the elections, the situation of the un-
employed and part-time workers has been seriously aggra-

’ .vated. Having no reserves to fall back upon, with their last

savings swallowed up in the bank-failures throughout the
country—from 1929 to 1932, 5738 banks with deposits of over
31/; billion dollars closed .their doors———these workers are in
a desperate plight. According to testimony before the U. ’S.

Senate Committee on Manufacturers, many of these men -
‘and women have been out of work for one year or more.
Their physical condition has broken down. These are the

large body of “forgotten man,” who are demanding a f‘new
dea1”—not a promise but deeds. -

The situation of the part-time workers in many cases is

no better. Some big corporations, as, for instance, the
United States Steel Corporation, grant a worker one day’s
Work in two weeks, from which he must feed his family, pay
rent, etc. This is shameless and means starvation for these

workers, for they obtain no relief whatever from the local

or State relief organizations.

The mass unemployment has also reacted with disastrous
results upon the conditions, wages and hours of the employed

workers. Mr. Tone, Industrial Commissioner of Connecticut,‘

During the election campaign, Mr.‘Roosevelt was quoted as

creased. Dr. Appel, State Secretary of Health of the Com-  ‘Y
monwealth of Pennsylvania, states, “there is one under- -

nia,.” According to Governor Pinchot, there are 2,000,000
unemployed, in that State. (New York ’T'imes-—Feb. 15,
1933). These children are suffering from pellagra and ﬂux,

working class to anaemia and physical debility. According to , ,
Health Commissioner Wynne of New York, one-fourth _ » « 
of all the children in New York today are undernourished.  
In WestVirginia and Kentucky, accordingto the New York . 
Times, Jan. 8, 1933, “91 percent of the children in: the most I ; ,-

17 per cent of the population, they are 41 percent of the I
unemployed. Of the 45,000 unemployed» in Washington, D.-

C., 30,000 are Negroes. The Negroes in almost all cities and
towns are denied work; they receive little relief, and where
it is granted, (together with the Latin-American and Italian

.workers) they receive far less than the other sections of
' the working class, on the grounds that “they are used to a

lower standard of living.” (New York Home Relief Bureau).

In the South, the Negroes are allowed to die of starvation,‘
being. considered of _-lower value than chattels.

The Negro
women are losing their jobs, being replaced by white girls.
Pellagral and ﬁux, prevalent throughout the South, and
rickets, especially attack the‘ Negro children. ‘There is such
abject poverty that the children of the working class go
without shoes and in rags. If the Negroes put up a ﬁght
against these conditions, they are jailed and sent to the
chain gang, if they are not brutally shot down by the author-
ities and the Ku Klux gangs. ‘

' Today fully 42 per cent of the working population is totally
unemployed, millions more are working only part time. The
payrolls of the country are down to 37.7 per cent of 1927.
According to the Cleveland Trust Company, the industrial
production index has fallen to about 40 points below the 1929
level.

In Chicago, the situation is even more alarming. In De-
cember 1932, the employment index for manufacturing indu-

stries declined 45.5 points from December, 1927, and payrolls I
declined 63.8 points for the same period, according to the_

Illinois Department of Labor. The statement further reports

I that “the ﬁgures for the last months of 1932 furnish no in-

dication that the bottom has yet been reached.” No serious
economist dares predict that the bottom has been reached,
despite the “optimistic” predictions of Ford, Rockefeller and
Schwab. -

Living costs have not declined in measure equal to the
lowered income of those still working or receiving relief.

‘ According to Mary Anderson of the Women’s Bureau of the

United States ‘Department of Labor, in the last two years,
wages ‘dropped 54 per cent, while the cost of living declined

8

 

 

 

  
 
   
 
 
 

c

only 18 per cent. Rents for the working class have hardly
decreased, except in those cases where the workers organized
and carried out rent strikes. '

The ex-soldiers, for whom the government professed warm»
admiration in 1917, are “forgotten.” These heroes of yes-'

terday, who during days of prosperity were held up before
the youth as examples, are now spurned and denied even the
back wages which are due them. They demand, and correctly,
the immediate payment of these back wages. They demand
thatthere be no cuts in disability allowances. As the years
pass by, more and more of them feel the effects of warfare-
gassing‘, shell shock, etc. The red tape connected with efforts
to obtain medical treatment and proper ‘relief is so fearful
that many of them give up in despair. The discrimination
against the Negro veterans is outrageous.

‘FARMERS ARE DESPERATE

The situation of the toiling farmers is similar to that of
the workers. In three years the gross farm income has fallen
more than 55 per cent. The result is that -the farmers cannot
meet their debts and mortgages, pay their interest and taxes.
By the hundreds of thousands they have been forced off the
farms through actual hunger. They cannot send their chil-
dren to school for lack of clothes and shoes. The Negro and
white sharecroppers of the South are practically serfs on the
land, subject to the whim and will of the landlord and mer-
chant who hold the threat of jail, prison camp, chain gang
and lynching as a whip over their heads. The Democratic
proposal of the allotment plan would not aid the toiling
farm-ers, but would be a direct attack on the cost of living
of the workers in the city.

One of the most shameless forms of exploitation of the

hunger and misery of the -unemployed is forced labor.‘

While pretending to afford the unemployed a means of
work, the state and cit are forcing the unemployed to do
work at miserably low wages. They even compel union men,
who are entitled to union wages, to accept a much reduced

T scale, and then. as in Atlantic City, with the approval of

the union bureaucrats, pay them in food baskets. This
