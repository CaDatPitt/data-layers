The Legacy of Slavery
and the Roots of
Black Nationalism

Eugene D. Genovese

AMERICAN RADICALS, have long been imprisoned by the
pernicious notion that. the masses are necessarily both good and
revolutionary, and by the even more pernicious notion that, if
they are not, they should be. The principal task of radical
historians therefore has too often been to provide the masses
with historical heroes, to make them aware of‘ their glorious
tradition of resistance to oppression, a.nd to portray them as
having been implacably hostile to the social order in which they
have been held. This viewpoint now dominates the black libera-
tion movement, which has been fed for decades by white
radical historians who in this one respect have set the ideo-
logical pace for their liberal colleagues. It has become virtually
sacrilege——or at least white chauvinism———to suggest that slavery
was a social system within which whites and blacks lived in
harmony as well as antagonism, that there is little evidence
of massive, organized opposition to the regime, that the blacks
did not establish a revolutionary tradition of much significance,

white politicians, or on the protection of federal troops, or on
the advice of their own inexperienced leaders who in turn
relied on whites. As Vernon Lane Wharton has observed, “The
lesson learned was that the Negroes, largely unarmed, eco-
nomically dependent, and timid and unresourceful after genera-
tions of servitude, would offer no effective resistance to
violence.’’“ When Whitelaw Reid asked black school children
what they would do if someone tried to reenslave them, most
responded that the troops would not permit it. No wonder
Northern public opinion asked eontemptuously in 1875 why a
black majority in Mississippi constantly had to call for out-
side help. _

The ":>l;-':.eks sealed their own fate by relying on the protec-
tion of others. The Republican Party, the Union Army and the
Freedman’s Bureau all took on the role of protectors, but, if
anything, the new paternalism proved much more flimsy and
more insincere than the old. The best illustration may be found
in the history of the Republicamsponsored, largely black militias.
Ex-slaves, urged on and even threatened by their women, who
were generallly more militant than the men, responded to the
calls of Republican governors and filled the ranks of state
militias, which were put to effective use in guaranteeing Re-

publican electoral victories. In several instances, especially A

toward the end of Reconstruction, militia units opposed each
other on behalf of rival Republican factions. In the most
appalling of these instances, the so-called Brooks-Baxter War

in Arkansas in l874,‘the Republican machine so discredited it-

self that the Democrats soon rodeback to power. As Otis A.
Singletary has sardonically observed, “The Negroes had been
called to arms to fight in behalf of two wl'.ite claimants for the
governorship, as a consequence of which the Negro was
eliminated as a political factor in Arkansas.”" In Mississippi
the radical governor, Adelbert Amcs, called the blacks to arms
in 1875 to counter Democratic violence, and then lost his nerve
and disarmed them in return for a worthless pledge from the
opposition. Significantly the black politicians in his party al-
most unanimously opposed using the black troops in a show-
down. The militia movement failed because it faced greater
force, but no less because its leaders were never willing to see

it steeled in battle, especially in defense of specifically black
interests.

In other respects the Reconstruction experience followed
parallel lines. In the famous Sea Island experiment the blacks
placed their trust in white generals, some of whom meant well
and tried hard but could not prevail in the face of Washing-
ton’s duplicity. When the old plantation owners returned with

- federal support, the blacks protested but ultimately accepted

defeat without recourse to arms. Here, as with the militias,
the masses seem to have been well ahead of their leaders. De-
mands for resistance were heard, anti-white feeling was mani-
fest and the desire for land grew apace, but the leadership
proved timid or mortgaged, and action independent of whites
was deemed impractical. Black Congressmen and state legisla-
tors rarely fought for basic black interests and even opposed (lis-
franchisement of ex-Confederate whites. With no powerful
separate organizations and paramilitary units, without experi-
ence in leading their masses, they temporized and collapsed.
Their fault did not lie in having coalesced with Northern whites,
but in having coalesced from a position of weakness, without in-
dependent demands, organization and force. The masses moved
sharply to the left and expressed an intense desire for land,
but the old pattern persisted; they could not cut loose from
accommodating leaders and from dependence on the ultimate
authority of the whites. They did not so much demand, much

i less fight for, land, as they hoped it would be given them as

Christmas present. -

The black leaders saw the duplicity of their white Re-
publican allies, but had nowhere to go. Most hadbeen North-
emers or privileged Southern mulattoes; their links with the
masses had never bcenfirm. When election time arrived they
swallowed their doubts and frustrations and, with the best of
intentions, lied to their people. Without adequate traditions and
without confidence in their masses they m_ade the best deals
they could. This lying carried on an old ‘habit. Every slave, at
some time or other, would outwit the white folks by pretending
to be stupid or docile; unfortunately too often he simultaneously
outwitted himself. When carried into slave leadership, it was
generally impossible to outwit the whites without also out-

witting the blacks. During the war, for example, the respected
black pastor of a Baptist Church in Virginia offered a prayer
for the victory of Confederate arms. Subsequently he was be-
rated by his deaconstfor betraying the cause of the slaves, but
he pacified them by saying, “Don’t worry children; the Lord
knew what I was talking about.”‘§ Undoubtedly, the Lord did,

A but the good pastor apparently never wondered whether or not

his flock did also. A . _ V

moral standards; he therefore preached the whole gamut of
middle-class "virtues and manners.’ He knew his people had
never» stood on theirown feet and faced the whites as equals;
he therefore preached self-reliance and self-help. Unhappily,
apart from other ideological sins, he saw- no way to establish
self—relianee and ‘self-‘respect except‘ under tlielfinancial and
social hegemony of the white upper classes. Somehow he meant
to destroy the effects of paternalism in the long runliy s'trengtli-

that he failed because of this tactic,‘ but there is no way to be

during -periods of rctrogression in race relations until the up-
surge of nationalism in our own day. Washington was its
prophet; black nationalism has been its outcome. The second
has demanded integration, has stressed political action and
has demanded that whites recognize their primary responsibility.
Frederick Douglass was its prophet; the civil rights movement
has been its outcome. Yet, the lines have generally been
blurred. Du Bois often sounded like a nationalist, and Wash-
ington probably would have thought Malcolm X a madman."
This blurring reflects the dilemma of the black community as
a whole and of its bourgeoisie in particular: How do you
integrate into a nation that docsinot want you? How do you
separate from a nation that finds you too profitable to release?

To probe the relationship between this past and the recent
upsurge of the black masses requires more speculation and
tentative judgment than one would like, but they cannot be
avoided. Let us, at the risk of being schematic and one-sided»,
select several features of the developments of the last few

decades and especially of the recent crisis for such analysis. In‘

doing so let us bear in mind that the majority of blacks today
live outside the South; that they are primarily urban, not
rural, in all parts of the country; that whole cities are on
the way to becoming black enclaves; that the problem in-
creasingly centers on the urban North and West.“ Let us bear
in mind also that the only large-scale, organized black’ mass
movements until recently have been nationalist. Garvey com-
manded an organization of hundreds of thousands; the Muslims
have tens of thousands and influence many more. No integra-
tionist organization has ever acquired such numerical strength;
none has ever struck such deep "roots in the black. ghe toes.

Garvey’s movement emphasized blackness as a thing of

beauty, and struggled to convince the black masses to repudiate”

white leadership and paternalism. The pompous titles, offices,
uniforms and parades did and do evoke ridicule, but their
importance lay, as Edmund David Cronon says, _“in restoring
the all but shattered Negro self-confidence.” There was enorm-
ous ideological significance in Garvey’s delightful description of
a -light-skinned mulatto opponent as “a white man passing for
9315 .

Negro.

A decisive break with the white man’s church, if not wholly
with his religion, has formed a major part of black nationalist
thinking. In view of the central role of anti-Christian ideology
in the slave risings of Brazil and the Caribbean and the general-
ly accommodationist character of American ‘Christianity, this
has been a rational response to a difficult problem. Garvey
tried to organize his own African Orthodox Church. The Islamic
tendency, including Elijah Muhammed’s Nation of Islam, has
followed the maxim of Noble Drew Ali’s Moorish Science
Movement, “Before you can have a God, you must havea
nationality.” Garvey’s Black Jesus and Muhammed’s Allah
have had many attributes of a tribal deity. Of special im-
portance in Muhammed’s teaching is his decidedly un-Islamic
denial of an afterlife. In this way Black Muslim eschatology
embodies a sharp reaction against accommodationist ideology.
The tendency to turn away from the white man’s religion has
taken many forms, including conversion to Catholicism ostensi-
bly because of its lack of a color line. In Catholic Brazil, on
the other_hand, an equivalent reason is given by blacks who
embrace Protestantism."

Black Protestants in the United States have largely at-
tended self-segregated churches since Reconstruction. With the
collapse of Reconstruction these churches, especially in the
South, played an increasingly accommodationist role, but they
also served as community centers, protective agencies, marriage
counseling committees and leadership training schools. As ob-
jective conditions changed, so did many ministers, especially
the younger ones. One of the great ironies of the current strug-
gle for integration has been the leading role played by ministers
whose training and following have been made possible by segre-
gated organizations. The experience of the Protestant churches
and their anti-Christian rivals brings" us back to slavery’s legacy
of accommodationist but by no means necessarily treasonable
leadership, of an absence of collective effort, of paternalistically-
induced dependence and of emasculation. Theoretically, a
militant mass leadership could have arisen from sources other
than enforced segregation; historically there seems to have been
no. other way."

The first difficulty with the integrationist movement arises

  

is LEGACY OF SLAVERY

 

not from its ultimate commitment, which may or may not be
desirable, but from the determined opposition of the whites,
whose hostility to close association with blacks recedes slowly
if at all. Integration may only mean desegregation, and out-
standing black intellectuals like Killcns and Baldwin insist
that that is all -they want it to mean; it need not mean as-
similation. In fact, however, the line is difficult to hold, and
segregationists probably do not err in regarding one as the
prelude to the other. In any case, de facto segregation in educa-
tion and housing is growing worse, and many of the professed
goals of the civil rights movement look further away than ever.
Communities like Harlem face substantially the same social
problems today as they did forty years ago.“ I need not dwell
on the worsening problem of black unemployment and its
implications. .

Even where progress, however defined, occurs, the frustra-
tion of the black masses deepens. The prosperity of recent
decades has widenedthe gap between blacks and whites even
of the same class. The rise of the African peoples has inspired
blacks here but has also threatened to open a gap in political
power and dignity between Africans and Afro-Americans."

The resistance of whites and the inflexibility of the social
system constitute only half the problem. A. James Gregor, in an
article published in Science {"9" Society in l963,.analyzes an im-
pressive body of sociological and psychological literature to
demonstrate that integration under the disorderly conditions of
American capitalist life more often than not undermines the
development and dignity of the participating blacks. He shows
that the" problems of the black masses, in contradistinction to
those of the bourgeoisie, become intensified by an inte ration
which, in the nature of things, must pass them’ by. As Gregor
demonstrates, black nationalism has been the political reply of
these masses and especially of the working class. Similarly, in
his honest and thoughtful book, Crisis in Black and White,
Charles E. Silberman analyzes cases such as that in New
Rochelle, in which poor black and rich children had the
wonderful experience of integrating in school. Why should any-
one be surprised that the experiment proved a catastrophe for
the _black children, who promptly lost whatever ambition they
might have had."

When liberals and academics speak of a “crisis of identity,”
they may sometimes merely wish to divert attention from the
prior fact of oppression, but, by whatever name, that crisis
exists. Slavery and its aftermath emasculated the black masses;
they are today profoundly sick and shaking with convulsions.
It does us no good to observe, with Kardiner and Ovcsey, that
a psychology of oppression can only disappear when the op-
pression has disappeared.” It does us no good to admit that
the sickness of white racism is more dangerous than the sickness
it has engendered. We face an aroused, militant black com-
munity that has no intention of waiting for others to heal them-
selves. Those who believe that emasculation is the figment of
the liberal imagination ought to read the words of any militant
leader from David Walker to W.E.B. Du Bois, from Frederick
Douglass to Martin Luther King, from Robert F. Willliams to
Malcolm X. The cry has been to assert manhood and renounce
servility. Every outstanding black intellectual today—Killens,
Baldwin, Ellison——ma.kes the point in one way or another. Let
me quote only one, Ossie Davis on the death of "Malcolm X:

[Negroes knew] that Malcolm—-whatever else he was or was
not—-—Malcolm was a man.’

White folks do not need anybody to remind them that they
are men. We do! This was his one incontrovertible benefit
to his people. Protocol and common sense require that
Negroes stand back and let the whte. man speak up for us,
defend us, and lead us from behind the scene in our light.
This is the essence of Negro politics. But Malcolm said to
hell with that! Get up off your knees and fight your own bat-
tles. That’s the way to win back your self-respect. That's the
way to make the white man respect you. And if he won’t let
you live like a man, he certainly ean’t keep you from dying
like one.”

Is it any wonder, then, that Dr. King could write, almost as a ‘

matter of course, that the blacks of Birmingham during the
summer of 1963 shook off 300 years of psychological slavery
and found out their own worth?" It is no less instructive that
his aide, the Reverend Wyatt T. Walker, denounced as “hood-
lums” and “wines” those who responded to the attempt on

 

20 LEGACY OF SLAVERY

King’s life by attacking the white racists. King himself put
it bluntly when he pleaded that the black militant be al-
lowed to march and sit-in, “If his repressed emotions do not
come out in these’nonviolent ways, they will come out in
ominous expressions of violence.”"‘

King and his followers apparently believe that con-
certed action for integration can cure the ills engendered by
slavery and -subsequent oppression and break down discrimina-
tion at the same time. In one sense they are right. Their
greatest achievement has been to bring order and collective
effort to a people who had learned little of the necessity for
either. But King must deliver victory or face grave conse-
quences. As we have seen, not "all slaves and freedmen yielded
meekly to the opprcssor. Many fought, sometimes with great
ferocity, but they generally fought by lashing out ra't_l1c1' than
by organized revolutionary effort. It would be the crowning
irony if the civil rights movement has taught just enough of the
lesson of collective effort to guarantee greater and more wide-
spread nihilism in the wake of its inability to realize its program.

More and more young black radicals are currently poring
over F rantz F anon’s psychopathic panegyric to violence. F anon
argues that violence frees the opprcssor from his inferiority
complex and restores his self-respect.“ Perhaps, but it is also
the worst way to do either. Black Americans, like colonials,
have always resorted to violence without accomplishing those
goals. A slave who killed his overseer did not establish his man-
hood thereby——-any wild animal can kill—he merely denied his
docility. Violence can serve Fanon’s purpose only when it is
collective and disciplincd~——that is, political-——but then it is pre-
cisely the _ collective effort, not the violence, that does the
healing."

The legend of black docility threatens to betray those who
perpetuate it. They are ill-prepared for the yielding of one
side of the slave tradition-—-accommodation and servility———to the
other side———antisocia1 and nihilistic action. The failure of intc-.
gration and the lawlessness to which the blacks have for so
long been subjected and subject combine to produce that re-
sult. Jamcs Baldwin and Malcolm X, especially in his remarks
on the prestige of the ghetto hustler, have each warned of

 

 ;...ﬁ,.‘,,,

EUGENE D. GENOVESE 2'

this danger. Bayard Rustin has made a similar point with
gentle irony:

From the point of view of motivation, some of the healthiest
Negro youngsters I know are juvenile delinquents: vigorously
pursuing the American Dream of material acquisition and
status, yet finding the conventional means of attaining it
blocked off, they do not yield to defeatism but resort to
illegal (and sometimes ingenious) methods. They are not
alien to American culture.” .

Those historians who so uncritically admire the stealing of hogs
and. smashing of plows by‘ slaves might consider its modern
equivalent. In the words of Silberman‘:

There are other means of protest, of course: misbehaving in
school, or dropping out of school altogether; not showing up
for work on time, or not showing up at all (and lying about
the reason); breaking school windows or ripping telephone
receivers out of outdoor phone booths; or the oldest form of
protest of all, apathy——-a flat refusal to cooperate with the
oppressor for to accept his moral code.” 4

- Black nationalism, in its various manifestations, constitutes
a necessary response on the part of the black masses. The
Muslims, for example, have understood the inner needs of the
working-class blacks who have filled their ranks and have under-
stood the futility——for these people at least———of integrationist
hopes. Their insistence on the forcible assertion of a dignified,
disciplined, collectively responsible black community represents
a rational response to a harsh reality.“ We need not dwell on
what is unrealistic, romantic or even reactionary in the Nation
of Islam or other nationalist groups; they are easy to see. Ralph
Bunche, in his radical days, Gunnar Myrdal and many others
have for years pointed out that the idea of a separate black
economy is a will-o-the-wisp and that the idea of a separate
territory is less than that. Yet I am not sure how to! answer

iMarc Schleifer who in 1963 asked whether these goals were

less realistic, than those of equality under capitalism or a
socialist revolution in the forseeable future." I am not sure,

4 LEGACY OF SLAVERY

and that our main problem is to discover the reasons for the
widespread accommodation and, perhaps more important, the
long-term effects both of the accommodation and of that re-
sistance which did occur. ~
In 1831 Nat Turner led a slave revolt on which has
hung most of the legend of armed black resistance to slavery.
Of the 250 or so revolts chronicled and analyzed in Herbert
Aptheker’s American Negro Slave Revolts,‘ Turner’s has pride
of place and was described by Apthcker as a “cataclysm.”
Yet, when we look closely, this revolt, like the total history of
such revolts, recedes in importance and magnitude. As many
of Aptheker’s critics have pointed out, most of the 250
revolts probably never happened, being the imagination of
hysterical or self-serving whites, insignificant plots that never
matured, or mere local disturbances of a questionable nature.
Of the three major revolts, one, Denmark Vesey’s, was crushed
before it came to fruition; only Gabriel Prosser’s in 1800 and
Turner’s reached impressive proportions. Even so painstaking
and thorough a scholar as Apthcker has been unable to
discover firm evidence of a major revolt between 1831 and
1865. As for Turner’s, less than one hundred slaves joined. A
revolt of this size would rate little more than a page or two
in a comprehensive work on slave revolts in Brazil. To cite
only two outstanding examples, runaway slaves in the Brazilian
Northeast organized their own colony, Palmares, and waged a
65-year struggle for autonomy with as many as 20,000 people.’
During the first four decades of the nineteenth century there
were a series of violent and extensive risings in Bahia, cul-
minating in the great Muslim-led holy war of 1835.” We need
not dwell on Haiti, as the record of Jamaica, Cuba and other
countries is also impressive. Even if, as Apthcker suggests,
news of many smaller risings was suppressed, the effect would
have been to prevent the accumulation of a tradition to en-
courage and sustain revolt-prone slaves. On balance, we find
the absence or extreme weakness of such a tradition. 0
There were many reasons for this extreme weakness. First,
we need to consider the kind of Africans brought here. It has
long been falsely assumed that, since ‘slave traders mixed their
cargoes, all parts of the hemisphere received similarly mixed

22- LEGACY or SLAVERY

either, that Malcolm X, Harold W. Cruse and Stokely Car-
michael have not been wiser than their Marxist critics in de-
manding black ownership of everything in Harlem.” Such
ownership will do little toward the creation of a black economy,
but many of its advocates are easily bright enough to know as
much. The point is that it may, as Malcolm X suggested, play
a decisive role in the establishment of community stability and
self-respect. .
The black struggle for equality in America has always had
two tcmlcneics----integrationist and separatist--and it is ,likely
to rt-min lmth. Sixwc‘. :1 separate economy and national territory
are not sex-iom: pn.~‘.\'ll)ililit‘.\‘, the struggle for economic integration
will ul1(lOul)lC(.lly be pressed forward. For this reason alone
some degree of unity between the civil rights and nationalist
tendencies may be expected. The black bourgeoisie and its allied
stratum of skilled and government clerical workers will certain-

'ly continue its fight for integration, but the interest of the black

workers in this fight is, at bottom, even greater. At the same
time there will clearly be serious defeats, as well as some victories,
and the slogan “Freedom Now!” may soon turn to ashes.

The cumulative problems of past and present nonetheless ‘
demand urgent action. The assertion of black hegemony in_

specific cities and districts———nationalism if you lwill———offers the
only politically realistic hope of transcending the slave heritage.
First, it seems the only way for black communities to police
themselves, ‘to curb antisocial elements and to enforce adequate
health and housing standards, and yet break with paternalism
and instill pride and a sense of worth. Second, it seems the best
way to build —a position of strength from which to fight for a
proper share of jobs and federal funds as a matter of right not
privilege. Black nationalism may yet prove to be the only force
capable of restraining the impulse to violence, of disciplining
black rebelliousness and of absorbing the nihil.istic tradition into
a socially constructive movement. If this seems like a con-_
servative rendering of an ostensibly revolutionary movement, I
can only answer that there are no ingredients for a successful,
independent black revolution, and that black nationalism can
ultimately go only a few steps further to the left than the white
masses.- The rise of specifically black cities, counties and dis-

EUGENE D. GENOVESE 23

tricts with high quality black schools, well paid teachers, as
well as political leaders, churches and community centers, could
and should uproot the slavetradition once and for all, could and
should act as a powerful lever for structural reform of the
American economy and society.

I do not offer these remarks as a program for a black
movement, for the time is past when white men can offer pro-
grams to black militants. They are, happily, no longer listening.
But I do submit that they are relevant to the formation of a
program for ourselves-—for the American left. If this analysis
has merit, the demands of the black community will increasingly
swing away from the traditional appeal to federal power and
toward the assertion of local and regional autonomy. Even
now Bayard Rustin and others warn that federal troops can
only preserve the status quo. I should observe, further, that the
appeals to Washington reflect the convergence of two power-
ful and debilitating traditions: slave-engendered paternalistic
dependence and the growing state paternalism of white America.
Let us admit that the naive fascination of leftists for centralized
power has, since the 1930’s, greatly strengthened this tendency.
With such labels as “progressive” and even “socialist,” corporate
liberalism has been building what William Appleman Williams
has aptly called a nonterroristic totalitarian society. Yet Ameri-
can socialism has never even posed a theoretical alternative.
When Professor Williams called for a program of regional and
local reassertion and opposition to centralization, he was dis-
missed by most radicals as a Utopian of doubtful mental
competence. We may now rephrase his question: How do. we
propose to support an increasingly nationalistic black radicalism,
with its demands for local hegemony, unless we have an ideology
and program of opposition to the centralization of state power?

The possible courses for the black liberation movement
include a total defeat in an orgy of violence (we ought to re-
member that there is nothing inevitable in its or our victory),
a compromise with imperialism in return for some degree of
local ‘rule or the integration of its bourgeois strata, and the
establishment of black power on the basis of a developing op-
position toiAmeriean capitalism. Since its future depends to a
great extent on the progress of its integrationist struggle for a

place in the economy, the black community must for a while
remain well to the left of the current liberal consensus by its
demands for public works and structural reform. But reform
could occur under the auspices of an expansion rather than a
contraction of state centralization, and the most militant of the
black leaders may have to settle for jobs and local political
control in return for allegiance to a consolidating national and
international empire. The final result will be decided by the
struggle within white America, with the blacks playing the role
of an increasingly independent ally for one or another tendency.
Notwitlnstzinciing some offensive and pretentious rhetoric, the
advocates of black power have judged their pos.ition correct-
ly. They are determined to win control of the ghettoes, and we
would be foolish not to bet on them. The use to which they put
that power, however, depends not on our good wishes or on
their good intentions, but on what they are offered as a quid
pro quo. For American socialism the black revolt opens an
opportunity for relevance that has been missing for decades.
What we do with that opportunity, as the leaders of SNCC have

This recent experience, especially of SCLC, reveals the legacy of the
past in other ways as well. Louis E. Lomax has criticized Dr. King
for organizational laxncss and has related the problems of the SCLC
to the structure of the Baptist Church, “The Negro Baptist Church
is a nonorganization. Not only is each congregation a sovereign body,
dictated to by no one, but it would appear that the members who
come together and form a Baptist Church are held together only by
their mutual disdain for detailed organization and discipline.” The
Negro Revolt (New York, 1962), p. 86. As a result, according to
Lomax, the SCLC is a loose, scattered organization that mobilizes
itself only with great difficulty. Lomav makes good points but fails
to note the extent to which this weakness flows from the entire his-
tory of black America and especially the black South. With justice,
one could argue that the remarkable strength of SCLC in the face
of this amorphousness is a singular tribute to Dr. King’: political
genius. He has mobilized masses who are ill-prepared for the kind of
puritanical discipline preached by Elijah Muhammcd.

bags. But Brazil, for example, received large numbers of
Angolans and Congolese, whose military, religious and cultural
traditions made them especially difficult to control.‘ Brazil also
received a large number of Muslim slaves from Upper Guinea
who proved intractable everywhere in the hemisphere. The
United States, on the other hand, largely drew its slaves from
those portions of Lower Guinea which had a population pre-
viously disciplined to servitude and domination. Ironically, these
Africans were, in some respects, among the most advanced in
technical culture.

Second, the slave trade to the United States came to an
end in 1808, although illegal importations continued to trickle
in; in contrast, the trade to Cuba and Brazil continued well
into the nineteenth century. The presence of large numbers of
newly imported Africans can generally be correlated with in-
cidence of revolt. In the United States the great majority of
slaves during the antebellum period had been born and raised
on Southern plantations. Their ranks received little reinforce-
ment from newly enslaved and aggressive Africans.

Third, a review of the history of Brazil and the Caribbean
suggests that an important ingredient in the development of
revolts out of local disturbances was the division of the whites
into warring factions and the general weakness of thestate ap-
paratus. Together with these conditions went the general in-
fluence of geography in relation to state power. Where suitable
terrain was combined with a weak state, runaway slaves could
and did found maroon colonies, which directly fomented re-
volts and kept alive a tradition of armed resistance. With minor
qualifications, these conditions did not exist in the United
States.

Fourth, a substantial revolt presupposed the formation of
ideology and leadership. In Brazil and the Caribbean two cir-
cumstances combined to encourage both: the cultivation or
sugar led to the establishment of plantations averaging perhaps
200 slaves or more, and the size of the white population was

small. As a result the blacks could keep alive much of their

African culture or could develop a syncretized Afro-Brazilian
or Afro-Cuba culture, which militated against the loss of identity
and which could, under proper conditions,. nurture resistance

movements. Apart from Islam, non-Christian religious cults,
generally of a syncretized type, played a great role in hemi-
spheric slave revolts. In the United States an imposed Protestant-
ism, when effective, generally kept the slaves docile.‘

Half the slaves in the United States lived on units of
twenty or less; most of the others lived on plantations of fifty
or less. Although blacks heavily outnumbered whites in large
areas of the South, they were, in general, ﬂoating in a white
sea. The white planters were residents, not absentees; the non-
slaveholders were loyal, armed and disciplined; the country im-
mediately beyond the plantation areas was inhabited by armed
whites completely hostile to the blacks. Death, not refuge‘, lay
beyond the plantation. For this reason, among others, blacks
often looked to their masters to protect them against the
depredations and viciousness of the poorer whites. ‘Ne niay
therefore understand how, during race riots like that in Atlanta
in 1906, blacks reportedly ran to whites——or at least, to some
whites——for protection. A

The residency of the planters and their hegemony across
the South gave American slavery its particular quality and
especially set it off from Caribbean slavery. Between the Revolu-
tionary War and the War for Southern Independence the treat-
ment of slaves, defined as day—to-day conditions of life
(housing, food, rigor of work routine, leisure time, incidence and
character of corporal punishment) improved steadily and per-
eeptibly. Although manumission was made increasingly dif-
ficult and escape from the system was sealed off, the harsh
slave codes were steadily tempered by community sentiment
and the interpretations of the state supreme courts. During
the late antebellum period steady pressure built up to reform
the slave codes in order to protect slave family life and to
check glaring abuses of the slave’s person. The purpose and
effect of this amelioration in practice and at law was not to
pave the way to freedom, but to consolidate the system from
within and without. Like all liberal reformism it aimed to
strengthen the social ‘system.

S For the planters these trends formed part of a developing
world view within which paternalism became the specific
manifestation of class consciousness. Patemalism did not mean

EUGENE D. GENOVESE 7

kindness or generosity or love, although it embraced some of
each; essentially it meant a special notion of duty and re-
sponsibility toward one’s charges. Arbitrary power, harshness
toward disobedience, even sadism, constituted its other side.
For our immediate purposes, paternalism and the trend of
treatment are especially noteworthy in confronting the slave
with a world in which resistance could be quickly, severely
and legitimately punished, whereas obedience placed him in a
position to benefit from the favor of a master who more often
than not had a genuine interest in his welfare. The picture of
the docile and infantilized Sambo, drawn and analyzed so
brilliantly by Stanley M. Elkins, is one-sided, but he is not far

from the mark when he argues that the Southern regime greatly '

encouraged acceptance of and dependence upon despotic au-
thority.‘’ Elkins err; in thinking that the Sambo personality arose
only in the United States, for it arose wherever slavery existed.
He does not err in thinking that it was especially marked and
extensive in the United States, where recourse to armed re-

sistance was minimal and the tradition of paternalism took such

firm root.

To say that slaves generally accommodated is not to say
that they were so dehumanized as to be incapable of all forms
of protest. Historians are quick to claim rebelliousness every
time a slave broke a plow or stole a hog, but at least some
room might be left for lack of initiative, thoughtlessness, stupidity
and venality. Yet, we do know of enough instances of deliberate
acts of day-to-day resistance to permit us to speak of a strong
undercurrent of dissatisfaction and hostility, the manifestations
of which require analysis.

One of the more prominent and irritating habits of
"recalcitrant slaves was stealing. Plundering the hog pen and
the smokchouse was an especially happy pastime. Radical and
liberal historians have taken particular delight in insisting that
slaves might “steal” from each other but only “took” from
their masters. After all, their labor being unpaid, they only took
that which was rightfully theirs. I can understand this view-
point from liberals because I can understand almost anything
from liberals; I cannot understand it from Marxists. Since
Marxists regard all surplus value as derivingfrom unpaid labor

 

8' LEGACY OF SLAVERY

time, we ought, by the same logic, to be delighted every time a
worker commitsrobbery at his plant. I do not wish to discuss
the general problem of ethics in relation to class pppression, but
I do insist that the encouragement given by the slave system
to thefts had dangerous effects on the slaves themselves. The
slaves understood the link between conventional morality and
the civilized behavior of the whites; by rejecting that morality
they registered a protest, but they simultaneously underscored
their own isolation from that standard of civilization. Few
masters got upset over slave thefts. They expected their slaves

-to steal, and by doing so, the slaves accepted their master's

image of themselves. A

Southern folklore abounds with charming stories of slaves
outwitting masters by behaving like black versions of the Good
Soldier Schweik. The trouble is that too often ‘the masters en-
joyed being outwitted in the same way that a tyrannical father
sometimes enjoys being outwitted by a child. Every contortion
necessary to the job implied inferiority. It proved the slave
a clever fellow; it hardly proved him a man. It gained a few
privileges of crumbs but undermined self-respect and con-
firmed the master’s sense of superiority. The postslavery tradi-
tion of obsequiousness, indirection and the wearing of a mask
before white men has played a similar role in the South
ever since.’ ‘

Arson and the mishandling of tools stand out as more
positively rebelliousness acts. As expressions of frustration and
resentment they are understandable, and might, in a general
context of rebellion, have had considerable social value. As it
was, they amounted to individual and essentially nihilistic
thrashing about. With luck a few slaves might do enough
damage to ruin a planter, in which case he would be forced
to sell out and perhaps have to break up slave families and
friendships. Advocates of the philosophy of “burn-baby-burn,”
whether on a Mississippi plantation in the 1850’s or in a
Northern ghetto in the l960’s, would do well to bear in mind
that of necessity it is primarily the blacks who get burned.
On occasion a slave took direct action against a particularly
unpleasant master or ‘overseer and killed him. For that manly
act he would, if lucky, be hanged.

 

 

EUGENE D. GENOVESE V 9

As we review these actions, which by no means exhaust
the range, we find the formation of a tradition of reealcitranee
but not revolution, action but not polities, dim awareness of
oppression but not cumulative, ideological growth. Thus, where-
as most slaves came out of slavery with a psychology of de-
pendence conditioned by paternalism, the most active spirits

came out having learned‘ little more than that they could get‘

away with individual acts of undirected, misdirected or naively
directed violence. What was missing was that sense of ‘group
consciousness, collective‘ responsibility and joint political effort
which is the essence of a revolutionary tradition.

The formation of class leadership presents another side of i

this development. Legend has it that house slaves and drivers,
by virtue of their special positions, arrayed themselves on the
side of the master against the field hands, who as the most
oppressed were of course the most revolutionary‘ and pure.
Examination of plantation documents casts grave doubts on
this legend. Few plantations were big enough to carry a staff
of servants large enough to constitute a separate caste. Even
then the social life of the plantation proved too enticing for
them to maintain total separation. With much of their everyday
world conditioned by contacts with field slaves, they could ill-
afford to be wholly on the side of the whites. The range of
behavior was wide, but there were many instances of identifica-
tion and sympathy. -

The drivers, or slave foremen, present an even clearer
case. These men often dominated the everyday life of the planta-,

tion. On the whole masters trusted them more than they ‘trusted
their white‘ overseers; overseers came and went after a year or
two, but drivers usually stayed on in positions of authority for
many years. Masters relied on their drivers to tell them if an
overseer was too lax or too harsh and if the hands respected
him. Rarely did a planter take his overseer’s word against that
of a trusted driver. Some drivers undoubtedly were themselves
severe taskmasters who lorded it over their fellow slaves, but
drivers, too, had no social life apart from that of the slave
quarters and had to live with the others. In _general, they
compromised as best they could ‘between the master to whom
they had pledged loyalty and to whom they were indebted for

 

lo LEGACY OF SLAVERY

special favors, and the slaves who constituted their everyday
fellows. Often the driver stood as a protector or interpreter
between slave and master or overseer. Drivers and house slaves
often, although certainly not always, comprised a leading stratum
in the eyes of the blacks as well as in the eyes of the whites.

In the Caribbean these privileged slaves led revolts; in
the United States they served as agents of accommodation.
Toussaint L’Ouverture was only the most prominent of insur-
rectionary leaders who had been trained to leadership within

the system. The problem in the United States was not that the‘

system did not create such privileged strata, nor that these strata
were more docile or less courageous than those in the Caribbean.
The problem was that the total environment reduced the pos-
sibilities for successful insurrection virtually to zero, and there-
fore made accommodatienists out of the most higl1—spirited slave
leaders. When the mass exodus from the plantations took place
during the War for Southern Independence, drivers and house
slaves often led their people to the Union lines. Not docility
but lack of a tradition of armed resistance conditioned their
leadership.

Potential recruitment of insurreetionary leaders was hamper-
ed by many other circumstances, of which three are especially
noteworthy. For reasons already indicated littleanti-Christian
religious sentiment could develop. Religion (Islam, voodoo, or
Afro-Catholic syncretisms) proved to be an essential ingredient
in slave cohesion and organized resistance throughout the hemi-
sphere, but in the United States the enforced prevalence of
Protestant Christianity played an opposite role. The second
group of potential leaders recruited from all strata were those
who had sufficient strerigili, daring and resourcefulness to fiee.
The runaways are black folk heroes,‘ with good reason, but

they also drained the best elements out of the slave class. In ,

much of Brazil and the Caribbean runaways had nowhere to
go except into the back country to form maroon colonies, the
existence of which encouraged slave disorder and resistance.
Finally, the free blacks and mulattoes in the United States had
little opportunity for self-development and rarely could or would
provide leadership to slaves. Elsewhere in the hemisphere, where
whites were relatively few, these free blacks and mulattoes were

 

EUGENE D. GENOVESE ||

needed to _fill a wide variety of social and economic functions.
Often they prospered as a middle class. In some cases, feelings
of racial solidarity or, as in Haiti, the racist. stupidity of the
whites, led them into partial identification with the cause of
black freedom. Thus, withthe exception of a rare Nat Turner,

\‘ black leadership fell to those whose position within the planta-

tion itself encouraged accommodation and negated the possi-3
bilities of effective political organization.

‘The War for Southern Independence brought these
tendencies to a head. The staggering truth is that not one full-
scale slave revolt broke out during a war in which local white
police power had been drastically reduced. In only a few
isolated cases did slaves drive off their masters and divide the
land among themselves. Many, perhaps most, struck for free-

dom by fleeing to Union lines at the first opportunity. The at- .

titude of the slaves toward the federals varied, but the great

_ majority welcomed them with an adulation, trust and de-

pendence that suggests the full force of the old paternalism.’
Many blacks, free and slaves, Northern and Southern, entered

the Union Army, where despite humiliating discrimination they _

gave a creditable account of themselves in action.

For all that, the record of the slaves and ex-slaves during
the war constituted a disaster. Having relied previously on the
protection and guidance of their masters, they now threw
themselves on the mercies of the Union Army. As might be ex-
pected, untold thousands died in and out of virtual concentra-
tion camps, countless women were raped by Union troops, black

‘soldiers generally found themselves used as menials or cannon

fodder. Many decent and selfless white and black abolitionists

I accompanied the Union Army South and earnestly worked to

educate and organize the freedmen; they deserve all the praise
and attention historians are now heaping on them. The fact
remains that no black movement and only a weak black leader-
ship emerged from the war.

As the war years passed into the period of Reconstruction,

these patterns were reinforced. The blacks could and did fight-

for their rights, but rarely under their own leadership. When
they offered armed resistance under competent leadership they

-did well enough, but mostly‘ the-ye relied on the leadership of
