BAYARD, N. M.——“This strike
cannot be broken, not by ‘the
: courts, not by the Empire’s gun-
“men, not by arrests, not by tear
-gas, not by machine guns.” This
is quoted from a radio broadcast‘
 ‘last week by Amalgamated /Bay-
ard District "Union, ‘Local 890.

This was not an idle boast; it was

a’ sober, solid, statement of fact. A
court injunction, arrests, tear’ gas,

' threat_.s/bullets and hit-run driving had
been used on behalf of the Empire Zinc
division of New Jersey Zinc Company.
The strikers had one weapon stronger
than all these—an unbreakable unity.

Although this strike has had na-
tionwide press coverage because ‘of
mass jailings of pickets, some of the
most barbaric attacks. on the strikers
have “been ignored in the -commercial
press. For example—- "

-—Te_ar gasfliombs were thrown into. a
 picket line composed entirely of wo-
men and children.

--—More than 100 women and children
were jailed. ’

.—-A month-old infant was held in jail
more than 12 hours without milk.

-I»-Fifteen children under 12 years of
age were held in jail without either
parent being present. '

..-A would-be scab fired six rifle shots
at two women pickets as they neared
picket line, walking through
. Twocompany supervisors sat
in a parked car at the time of
:s”_l1ooting,'appa1'ently to observe
E ect on the pickets. The reaction

expressed by one of them: “The only

Travis issues  
convention call

" DENVER, Colo.--The call to the 47th
convention of the International Union
‘ of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers was '
sent out last_week to all Mine-Mill
locals by Maurice E. Travis, Interna-

._tional secretary—treasurer. '

2 . The convention will open September
.10 at. the Rancho Grande Hotel in
Nogales, Arizona. Mine-Mill locals
throughout the Southwest will act as
hosts.

M In a separate letter to all local
"qunions, Travis called attention to the
‘need for making transportation reser-""
ovations as far in advance as possible.
The nearest sizable city to Nogales is
Tucson, served by the Southern Pacific
 railroad, American Air Lines and Fron-
' tier Air Lines. Nogalcs is about an
 hour's ride by bus or auto from Tucson.

Shocked

“I have been greatly shocked by
newspaper accounts of the jailing of
pickets, _ irzzcluding women and chil-
dren.”—from letter to President John
Clark from Senator James E. Murray
’(Dem., Mont.), referring to the Em-
pire Zine strike.

a

this line would be to drop an atom
bomb.”

Empire Zinc is following what the
strikers refer to as the “Graves formu-
la” for strikebreaking. This takes its
name from an imported labor rela-
tions “expert.” His formula is simple;
it consists of using law enforcement
agencies to do all the strikebreaking
work.

COMPANY-PAID sheriff’s deputies
have assaulted and arrested the pickets.
Arrests have been made under a court
injunction prepared for the company
with the help of District Attorney- Tom

Foy, his assistant, Vincent Vesely, and ~
Sheriff L. K. Goforth. This is improper“

and scandalous conduct on the part of
public officials.

The union is growing stronger with
every attack by corrupt strikebreaking
public officials. “Business men of the

community have been told the facts in‘

the strike and have signed a peition de-
manding that the company meet the
union’s terms and settle.the strike.

Support from members of Local 890
employed at other properties, and from
other unions, has been mounting as the
company stepped up its ‘attacks.

Last week the local union issued a
special invitation to the'Negro,people
of. the area to attend its strike meet-
ing. Many responded, one of whom,
Samuel Cooper, told the meeting that
he ‘had worked in the mines here years
ago, before he was Jimcrowed out or
a job by the company. He welcomed the
locaL_union’s gesture of friendship to
the Negro people, and looked forward
to the time when Local 890 would lead
a movement to break down the bar-

'riers to employment of Negroes in

industry .here.

- hold take-home, plus 10 cents '

SUDBURIY, Ont.—‘More than 1,300
nickel-copper miners here have won
the 40-hour‘ week-—without loss of
take-home pay—as well as a 10 cents
across the board wage increase retro:

‘ active to June 10.

The big gains were made in an
agreementon the 1951-52 contract he-

- tween Local 598 and the Falconbridge
‘Nickel rMines, negotiated more than

three months ahead of the termination
date of _the_cu1-rent contract. The 40-
hour week will go/into effect on July
80

Additional wage raises are provided
in the contract for several hundred
Falconbridge workers, ranging from
one—half to nine cents an hour.

THE NEGOTIATIONS also won a
medical plan which will give complete
medical, surgical and‘ hospital protec-
tion to all employes and their families.

\Discussions on the plan, which began.

during the bargaining talks, are now
nearing completion.
After the International Nickel Co.
contract was concluded here late in
May; the Falconbridge W0l‘kel'S raised
demands that their wage rates, hours
“and working conditions be equalized
with Inco immediately, even though
their contract. was not due to.expire
until September \12. " ‘

‘Exploratory meetings with Falcon-
bridge resulted in full-scale contract

negotiations on June 13, and an. agree-,

ment Was reached exactly one week
later. '

The interim adjustment brings Fal-

conbridge .a monetary “package”
amounting to well over 30 cents an
hour. Because of the 13 weeks of “ad-
vance” gains, each of the Falconbridge
men will receive about .$115 “extra.”
Broken down into cents-per-hour, this

 

will show an overall gain for the past

year of 5V; cents hourly above and

beyond the 10 cents across the board
increase. -

Membership meetings of Falcon":
bridge Workers overwhelmingly rati-
fied the contract, and by a majority
of about 98 per cent, voted to increase

dues——5O cents a month to follow the‘

pattern already er by Inco workers.
Mike Solski, Local 598 financial sec-
retary, was chairman and spokesman
for the Falconbridge negotiating com-
mittee, while the committeemen in-
cluded J. Andrew, W. Somers, S. Man.

Local 529 asks for
vote to smash raid

ABESSEMER, Ala..—-Workers at the
Alabama Metal Products Co. here
have ended a strike which grew out of
the discharge of one of their fellow-
employes. Their union, Mine—Mill Lio-
cal 529, is being raided by an outfit
known as the “Alabama Metal Prod-
ucts Company Workers Asst/ciation.”

And the Company had been taking
advantage of the division among the
men to treat the men as they pleased.

‘Not only did they strike to let the
Company know they still had a union
to deal with, butlit also hadthe effect
to building greater unityamong the
men. Mine-Mill leaders proposed that

all factions in the plant join in putting —

the discharged employee back to work
and‘ also that theimen unite on"a com-
mon bargaining program regardless of
their -differences over. the choice of

' unions. However, "the so—called “Inde-

pendents” turned down all unity pro-_

.posals', thus confirming the; charge

that. they were acting in the interest
of‘ the, Company.
Local 529, under leadership of pres-

ident O. R. Rhea is now seekin-g an’

early NLRB election in order ../that the
“Independents” may be disposed of and
negotiations for a new contract he
resumed. Rhea has also expressed his
ap reciation fat the financial assist-

.ance for Local 529, during the recent

strike by a number of other Mine-

Mill locals in the area and by the In-

ternational Union.

pension p an,
SAN FRANCISCO.—A pension plan
‘providing for $100 a nionth, in addition
to social security, was negotiated last
month between the Int’l Longshore-
men’s & Warehousemen’s Union and
the Pacific Maritime Ass’n. The con-
tract, effective June 15, provides for a
10-year pension, plan under which men
of 65 with 25 years’ service will be
eligible for pensions starting July 1,
1952. Retirement will be mandatory at
age 68. .
If the plan is not app_roved by gov-
ernment agencies, wages will be in-
creased 11 cents an hour, retroactive to
June 18, 1951. "
THE NEW CONTRACT also _pro-
vides for a wage increase of 5 cents an
hour, bringing pay to $1.97 an hour
straight time for the first six hours
and $2.95% “for, overtime.
under° a welfare fund were also in-.
creased. -i
The hiring hall. section of ‘the con-
tract was modified to meet Taft-Hart-
leyr requirements, but this was done in
such a way, as to protect union mem-
bers from .the'pre-union practices‘ of
discrimination on grounds of union ac-
tivity, color, nationality, religion or
politics.
This contract was negotiated under
leadership of ILWU President Harry
Bridges. It was approved almost unan-
imously at stop-work meetings of the
locals. « ' '
_ AT ABOUT the same time, the Na-
tional Maritime Union and the Amer-
ican Radio Ass’n ended a one-week
strike with a reduction of hours from
4_8 to 44, -improved vacations and »sub-
sistence allowances. On wages, the
NMU- was granted only" 8 per cent
above the level of January, 1950.. The

more. President of NMU is Joseph Cur-
ran, one of the committee of three who

our expulsion fro1n‘CIO.

‘Somebody was wrong’

SAN FRANCISCO.-—Harry Bridges,
president of ILWU, commenting on his
union’s contract renewal with the West
Coast shipowners, said:

“Our pension plan . . . makes the
plans negotiated by-Reuther of the
Auto Workers and Murray of the
Steelworkers look like the phoniest of
all sell-outs . . .

“We were not supposed to get as
much as we got. We were not even
supposed to keep what we had. The
ILWU’s funeralvwas supposed to have
taken place or long time ago . . . Our
union was supposed to fall apart when
we disagreed with the phoney political
programs of the Truman administra-
tion, and the union-busting, scab-
herding, raiding and sell-out programs
of the C10, Murray, Carey, Reuther,
Curran and the whole mob of labor
fakers . . .

“Somehow or other . . . it seems to
me that somebody was wrong . .‘ .”

Answer to ‘Who said it?‘

Officers of Steel local at Laurel
Hill’, N._ Y., refinery, talking to offi-
cials of Phelps Dodge Co. This is their
idea of how to negotiate. See_ story,

SUNDBURY, Ont.—-Woirkers at the
Copper Cliff branch of Canadian In-

of important Wage gains’ in contract
negotiations “ just concluded ‘three
months ahead of time.

The Copper Cliff workers, who won,
an int-erim/'wage increase of 7 to 8'/g
cents hourly last ‘December, have now
won an additional ‘ 10-cent hourly
interim increase,’ retroactive to= June
10. r ' ' i ‘

In addition, their work-week will be
reduced fromV44 to 40 hours on July
8—with the same tal(e’-home pay as
under the 44 hour week. ‘

The latest adjustment,‘ negotiatedi

by Local 598, goes into effect more
than three months ahead of the regu-
lar contract termination date of Sep-
tember 23. Several rates are to’ be ad-
justed upwards as much ,as'9 cents
an" hour, and a number of other con-
tract improvements will go into effect

September 23, thus. eliminating the p,

' need for further negotiations this year.

Apology

Through a ‘serious error, the story
on the election victory of Mine-Mill
Local 365 in the last issue of THE

UNION linked the na eof Mike Berko ‘ 5

with that of Stanley rabowski as hav-
ing given '“aid and comfort” to the
raiding union. _

Mike Berko has long beena fighting‘
supporter of Mine-Mill. He resigned as
grievance chairman voluntarily and on
his own initiative after accepting the
company's invitation to attend fore-
man’s school. He was not “forced” to‘
resign, as THE UNION story errone-
ously stated.’

There -has never been any doubt
about Mike Berko’s loyalty to Mine-Mill 

and his Local. .He was .in the leader-

ship of both .his-local. union and. the , 
AS&R Council for many years, and his ._ I
leadership has; always ‘been highly. - -

HE ‘NATIONAL WAGE POLICY COMMITTEE of the Interna-

July 12. Meetings of the AS__&R, Kennecott, Phelps Dodge, and Ana-
conda. will also be.held——fall of these in conjunction witlla quarterly
session of the‘ International Executive Board. ' -
At the meetings of the Councils and the Wage Policy Committee
in March," we drew up our-demands and general strategy. Since that
. . time, all of the Councils have met with the employers.
It is now time for adoption of a program to deal with
the situation that hasdeveloped. I  .
L We have found all of the employers following one
‘ pattern in -negotiations. They refuse to bargain seri-
ously. They brushoff our demands as excessive,_ and

 
 
  
 
 
 
        
    

 which can be taken as‘ a basis for serious ‘bargaining.
 They talk in termsof the p-honey and irresponsible
fo mulaplaid down by the National Wage Stabilization Board.

cial V address broadcast by President
Joe Mason of Butte Miners Union,
Local 1,-over Station KBOW, June 12.

ByV Joe Mason J

Tomorrow at Columbia Gardens the
miners of Butte will gather once again
to do honor to the birthday of union-
ism in Butte—to the early-day miners
‘ ' ' " who possessed the
courage‘, intelligence
and foresight to
band themselves to-
gether and make a
start
long struggle for ‘a
better life
underground ' work-
ers W h o s e labor
M ‘ creates the wealth
whichtmaintains the Butte community.

 

I believe it is fitting toreview some

of the highlights of this 7.3-year strug-
gle and -also-‘to makesome comparisons
regarding working and living condi-
tions as they obtained in those’ early

years of 1878 and later, and the condi- .

tions that our organized "struggle has
obtained for us up to and including the
year of 1951.

In 1878 and much later‘ than that,

any ‘organized effort by workers any- .

where to improve their’) working or liv-
ing conditions was regarded as a crime
against society. The industrial worker
was not supposed to have hopes or as-
pirations for a decent existence, but
was expected to remain content with
a life of slavery under inhuman con-
ditions—his sole function being to pro-
duce wealth for the benefit of the
privileged class- Consequently, early

efforts of workers to organize was met’
with the most savage repressive mea-_

suresdby the men who controlled in-
dustries or by corporation" executives.

IN THE CLOSING)years of the last
‘century and well into the present one,

mine ownersand their supporters were .

particularly savage in their opposition

' to efforts at organization made by the .
-.miners of the West, utilizing every‘

possible method, legal 01; illegal . in
their determined effort to stamp out

'such organization -and keep the miners, ’

millmen and smeltermen disorganized,
divided, badly paid and victims of in-
credibly bad working conditions.
However, we workers in the mining
industry can say with pride that these

greedy and ruthless attempts to re- A

uce us to utter slavery failed every-
where in the mining camps -of_ the
West. Thepattempt failed in Butte,

when the miners first formed the\

Butte City ‘Miners’ Union in 18_73,'8
union which not only-established bet-
ter, conditions and pay for Butte min-
‘ers, but alsotook the. lead in promot-

ing a great international union which-

BUT-—AND. THIS is a fact I wish
to stress above all,—they failed jmainly V-
because of the provenfact that a strong‘.
and unified international union, which ‘
solidly -unites all workers Within the

non-ferrous mining» industry, is .more ‘.

powerful than any force, which ‘can,be H
employed against it. - ‘

An international union, I repeat, ,

and considgr that well. For our, Union.
is strong- enough now, I believe, to»
admit the fact that we miners and
smeltefworkers have met with many
defeats, many failures, whenever min-
ing corporations were able to so Weak-
en or divide us that we were forced to
deal with them merely on a ‘local un-

ion basis, without" being able to utilize .

the greatly extended and‘ combined

power of ’_an international organiza- 

tion. »

This is the main lesson I believebur » -
.73-year struggle has taught us--that

we must at all - costs maintain V and
strengthenand extend the INTERNA-
TIONAL composition of our Union;
while’, of course, continuing to ‘build
and develop ‘the local: unions which
make up our International.

I believe, too,- that, it would‘ be a
great mistake toassume that because
We now, enjoy certain rights,’ we can
retain them Without" effort. .We ‘ cer-
tainly can’t rest on pastvictories or
in any measure give up our never end-
ing task of defending such rights and
extending them. The continued and-
tireless efforts of our many enemies"

to weaken or disrupt or destroy our, ~

Union are sufficient proof of that. No,
the struggle we have engaged in’ for

_73 years still goes on and must go, on.

-. The War at home

To the Editor: _

There are many thoughts that I have
in mind aboutthis war, but will only
attempt to express a few of them.

Since it is. true that “Charity B0-

gins at Home and Spreads Abroad,”
then why are we connected with the
Korean war, when we have war here
in the U.S.A.? That's easily answered,
it i_s mainly between the Negro and the
Southern Whites. We have great politi-
cians getting paid a salary just to
-hand out death sentences to the Negro
men charged with rape--whether they
are guilty or innocent, without thor-
oughly investigating.

In many cases these were veterans
of World War II. J Will our boys have

.. to continue fighting and getting slaugh- _
tered, and if they survive. this bloody

war, come home .. to‘ be executed for

false accusations? Jim Crow .-is the _

cause of these happenings and Jim
Crow in existence is very detrimental to
both the White and Negro nationality.

Theii with the high taxes’_we have
to pay these days, how does our, gov-
ernment expectus to live? We the un:
fortunate Negro and White would like
to earn adecent living and_reap the
benefit of our labor by having these
conveniences: more and better’ schools,
which would. mean better 1' children;
more and better hospitals, whi'ch would
bring about healthier people; closed
union shops and decent places to live in.

 Our high paid» politicians have the.

better opportunities due to our hard
labor, while they have nothing to do
but force these horrible issues upon
us. Again I will repeat that “Charity
Begins at,Home and Spreads Abroad.”

To the Editor: ‘_ -,-

I am a Negro down here in Bessemer,
thinking of the world’s affairs. The
whole world is torn up'over the fight
to hold down communism. But wars
won’t stop communism—-only a full
range of democracy. A .

I read of what is being done for oth-
er countries and I don’t see a thing_.be-
ing done for the Negro herein Ameri-
ca. There’s no civil rights bill for the
Negro. He doesn't have justice when

how. can this country show other coun-
'tries how to have democracy? And how

can you have democracy for the white —

The real enemy

I happened to hear a radio program’
a few days ago which made me lay
aside what I was doing, draw up a
chair and listen to, “Speak up Ameri-
cans for America before you lose your
Freedom.” ‘ p

I think this ispone of the most fit-

ting, outstanding and necessary orders \

that can be requested at this time for
any ’of us. I see only one way, to bet-
ter that sentence and that is to sub-
stitute the word “wor ” for, the word
“speak.” Being president of the Besse-
mer chapter of NAACP and vice presi-
dent‘ of my local union‘ has made me
‘want to “wor ” for freedom and fair
,play. So I listened to this radio pro-
gram with_ great interest.
The “story? The president of a cer-
tain railroad made it very clear so even

 could understand the " wonderful.

things the railroads _do«for America.
You wouldn’t believe it, the contribu-
tion to thedefense of our country, em-
ployment to thousands of Americans,
great sums of money to the Govern-
ment in taxes and-—after all not clear-
ing too;-much profits. Don't cry yet but
I’m -sure the railroad‘ workers get too
much money in wages, pensions, and
other benefits (or do they?).
The patriotic railroad president, lov-
er of freedom and fair play, and de-
. fender of the Constitution of the U. S.
(as he'- would have you and I see him
and his company), was too modest to
tell us about the fine Work his Com-
pany has done, is doing,’ and shall do
for FEPC, eliminating Jim Crow wait-
ing rooms, or how much money they
have given to support anti-lynch leg-
islation. He didn’t mention‘ if they

thought it wrong to deny people a fair __

trial under the law, if there should be

segregated schools and unequal educa-
tion because of race or creed and a
few hundred other things.

You just don’t. tell me that a great
Railroad Company can’t spare time

’ for such things when they urge us all
to “speak up for America.” The idea,

as I get it from this ,radio program, is "

that we must beware of those people
who criticize railroads‘ and other big
businesses since this does a lot‘ of

damage to bur national unity, destroy- 

ing the faith and trust that must be
ours to save our\ “freedom.” This is
the “enemy” they warn us against.
But I think the people know the real
enemy. I do _not and have never been
a member of a communist organiza-
tion, don’t know if I’ve ever seen one,
so don’t blame my feelings on that as
an easy way out. I don’t belong to the
' KKK either, but I know that I’ve seen

a SOHKL

»I know “in what way’ and by the
hand of whom I have been made to
suffer. I know that I . pay taxes, I

know that I am not allowed in the

“City Auditorium” in -my city. My
children must go to over—crowded and

unequal schools. If I should happen to A

live where there. is‘ paved, streets and
another American with‘ "white skin
l. should want that street I must sell out,
get out, ‘or be bombed out. . ,,
No,‘ I'm not talking about a. street
in Korea, Red China or Russia, but
right in Birmingham district'.ir;..Ala-

bama, the “land of the free.” And -I A

know that the law enforcement officers
who protect me will say they are do-

ing ‘all they can to find the bombers.

but even if V they bomb me three or

' — four timesstill theguilty parties -just

of freedom in America..  '

PEAR’.-1TH AMBOY, N.J.——The execu-

attorney offered a deal. He said‘ he
would turn the women free if they
would stay away from the picket line.
The unanimous answer was: “We will

Next the DA offered individual
freedom to women whose relatives
posted bond. Again the answer was:

. V“None of us will leave until all of us

are freer.” Husbands who went to visit
‘their wives at the jail were told to
“Go out and organize replacements for

By late afternoon the heat was too

women and children. They went directly
back to the picket line, where most of

, unfair prochc-e
BAYARD, N. M.——A motion by Mine-
Mill Attorney Nathan Witt to vacate
the restraining ‘order against Local 890
will be copsidéied in court here on
July 9. By exposing collaboration of
strikebreaking officers of the law with

the company, Witt was able to upset
the plans of New Jersey Zinc’s labor
relations expert to the extent that the
status quo is to be maintained until the

, July 9 hearing.

Picketing is going on- 24 hours a day,
with women relatives of the union
members walking the line.

In the meantime, the ‘National Labor _

‘Relations Board is conducting hearings
on the union’s charge of company re-
fusal to bargain. An NLRB represen-
tative isiinvestigatingv union charges of
unfair labor practices by the company.

‘What the strikers are demanding—-
what they have tried to get for years
and what they struck for last October
17—is nothing more than conditions
and benefits established long ago. by

every other llline-Mill contract in this .

area and virtually every union contract
in the country—the 8-hour day, paid
vacations, holidays, travel-time pay,
health insurance,..sick benefits, etc.

Wide support pours. in
.fo New Mexico strikers

BAYARD, N.‘ M.—Support for the
Empire Zinc strikers has been coming

_ from scores of Mine-Mill and other
stantly helping the AS&R workers to - ‘

local unions throughout the. United
States and Canada. This_has taken the
form of money, telegrams to public
officials hereyand a delegation to help
obtain surpltis food commodities.

One ﬁnancial contribution was made
by a delegation from El Paso, who
made a trip here, bringing a contribu-
tion of $560 from Local 501 and $200‘
from ‘509.
Local 415 at Carlsbad, N. M., went to

the state capitol at Albuquerque to join .
a delegation from here in seeking sur-

plus food‘ commodities to aid‘ the
strikers. .  . ~

In response to an appeal from the

International office, many local unions

sent telegrams to the governor and the
district attorney, protesting the use of
force and violence against the strikers,
their wives‘ and children. '

.Continui~n~g' financial help is needed '

to assure winning this strike.

 A wire to Acheson

We are informed that one of the directors of New Jersey Zinc Com- '
pany, of which the Empire Zinc division is a. part, is Mr. Newall W. Elli-
son, a member of your former'law firm, Covington, Burling, Ruble,

We suggest that your public‘ statements regarding world peace would
, be more convincing if you were to use your influence with Mr. Ellison
toward the end- of bringing peice to Grant County, New Mexico.

At Hanover,-"New Mexico, where our members have been on strike
against the Empire Zinc division of New Jersey Zinc Company since
October .17, 1950, District attorney Tom Fey and Sheriff L. K. Goforth
have thrown 100 women and children into jail and have used tear gas
bombs against a peaceful picket line composed entirely of women and

Those arrested and jailed have ranged in age from 29 days to 69
" years. The month-old infant was held in jail more than 12 hours without
milk. Fifteen children under 12 years of..age.were arrested and‘ held’ in
jail without either parent being present. .' . . ‘ ‘

The barbaric labor policy of «New Jersey Zinc Company is hardly
surprising in view of its record in. World War II, when its international -
patent agreement restricted’ production of‘ zinc in this country while it

= aided zinc output in Germany. This led’ ‘Special Assistant Attorney Gen-
! eral Allan Dobeyto state that"‘This_company (New Jersey Zinz) has
5 .made a vital and substantial contribution to the German war machine.”

- Officials of New Jersey Zine company apparently are no more con-
cerned with the welfare and rights: of their employees in New Mexico to-
day than they were with lives. of American soldiers in the last war".

The majority of Empire Zinc‘ strikers» are Mexican-“Americans.
Areyou satisfied that a former partner, a representative of the firm

with which your name is associated, should be one of those-responsible
for the?barbaric treatment of American-‘workers cited above?

In approaching the 47th‘ Convention of our international union,
it is fitting that we briefly assess the events and activities since our

last convention. » K -
The characteristic to which we can point with greatest satisfac-

tion is the stability-——the bedrock - ~ '
strength which our union has
demonstrated throughout one of.
the most difficult periods in its his-
tory. Our members have proved
the ability of this organization,
while under the most intense fire, to
protect the living standards of:
workers in the industry,-' to suc-
cessfully resist -the attacks of our
enemies, to grow and prosper. Our
union has attained new stature,
both in terms of its role as‘ protec-

‘tor of the democratic and militant.

-ideals expressed ingour Constitu-
tion, and in its role’ asa front line‘

H force in 'the ‘fight for everything
that is progressive and decent in
American life.

_ , Substantial wage and contract gains made early this year, in
the face. Oi unexpired bargaining c_ontracts,sthe militant leadership
given in the fight for contract improvements and wage gains at the
time of the ‘lime expiration of contracts, the record’ of‘ struggle by
our members\to resist speed-up in the. plants and mines, the fight

' to improve safety and health standards, to aggressively enforce our
contracts, to settle.grievances,‘to prevent encroachments by the em-
ployers, are records unparalleled. in the labor movement of this
country. .The series of election victories, preserving the integrity and
[strength of our union, have not only profoundly shocked the raiders,
but have impressed all of organized labor._ No. one any longer ques-

. tions the ability of this organization to endure whatever attack it may

-loyalty" and incredible‘ fighting spirit of 6ur.thous_aﬁds of members
‘ and leaders who made these great achievements possible.

_ This Convention is to be held under circustances which again
seem likely to tax the resources and ability of our union. In spite of

ployers and their puppets who have taken control of our Government
continue to depress’ the economic level of all workers.

Welcontinue to suffer_under inflationary pressure which absorb
wage gains as fast as —we can make them. The tax burden on
workers becomes’ heavier, while the. wealthy amass still greater
7 riches.‘ The employer-controlled bureaucrats burn midnight oil devis-

inglformulas to further restrict the meager earnings of our. members.
. At the .same time, they threaten’to engulf us in a third world’war,
- to further enhance the biggest profit grab__.in history.t " ~

-While the bulk of the American people have expressed them-
selves, by’ polls and in_a hundred different other ways, against the
"death and suffering attendant upon, this program of domestic aus-

terity and foreign ‘slaughter, the hugegmilitaryyrbudget continues to

.We saw the deportation and persecution of trade unionists andpro-C

the outstanding - bargaining successes We have attained, the em-.

even greater victories, strength and prestige in the ‘coming year. ’ V

benefits to be secured from the peaceful development of atomic
power. The “F air Deal" has become the raw deal.

Parallel to this program, we witness on every side the oppressive.
methods adopted to silence the protesting voice of the‘ people." This
year. we saw.Willie McGee hanged on the gallows of Jim Crow;

tradeiunionistsg shot down by deputies’ guns in Ray-Sonora, Arizonaﬁ »

gressives, because they dared to raise their voices for better wages"

and _W_0'rkir.1g‘ conditions or because‘ they — expressed their will for‘ 
. eace ina sincere and forthright manner.‘ W e saw the lives of loyal"-“ Q

g mericans ruined by'_the depraved-antics ofthe’ so—called Un-Ameri-
can Activities Committee. We saw the use of the T_aft—l-lartley law,

and strike‘-breaking injunctions against workers who struggledfor a 

better. wage to provide the bare necessities for their families.

Today it can be a_source"of great pride to every member of our
organization that it has not accepted these conditions, nor- acquiesed
in the program which led to their imposition, -It“ is undeniably true
that we would today have no wage freeze, no economic Franken-
stein threatening even the subsistence levels of Workers’ income, no’
immense war graft, no profits rivalling the riches of Croesus——if the-~-
"labor statesmen" of this nation had not,'with "every crack of. the
whip, become further enslaved to the reactionaries. Our union, to.-_.
gether with the people, the rank and file of organized labor, spoke_
with unequivocal voice against the. whole plot _to destroy ‘the well- —

being and peace of the workers. Because our members had the right} ,.

tospeak out, and because they did speak out, our pranks today
enjoy greater unity than at any previous time. Our program, first of ,
all, is a democratic program, which permits room for expression of
every opinion. Because it is that kind of ‘program it stands vindicated
taday, and finds concurrence from people in every walk of American ’
1e.

\

This Convention, meeting’ at another historic crossroad, will not i -‘

shirkithe responsibilities of providing the leadership and program

"to guide us during the next year. The doctrine of “rank and file con- ~; _

trol," observance of the great slogan “An injury to one is _an injury to,’
all5"——the necessity to continue day-to—day struggle for the economic,-

and social welfare of our membership, will be the fundamentals inf 

which our program is rooted. The fight for the rights .of -all minority
groups, the fight against discrimination, because of color, creed or
nationality, the fight for protection of our nation's economy, the deep_- «

seated need for friendship with allnations, project the goals toward ’ it

which we ‘strive. This convention, representative as it will be of thee‘
most devoted and conscientious forces in’ American labor,,will be ,i
cognizant of its responsibilities. It will boldlyplan and aggressively"]
lead in effecting the program and policies which_ will insure for ,us,,;,.;

elected,by referendum, who will serve the International Union in the

years 1952 ‘and 1953. Constitutional amendments may be proposed.;,_
and referred to _membership referendum. -It is'of ~utmost.importanc‘e.U
