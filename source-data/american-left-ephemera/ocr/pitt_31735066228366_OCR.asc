three-quarters of an hour, sometimes an hour; but usually the
time is too short for him to change his clothes and leave the
plant. After eight hours of conﬁning, mechanical labor, a man
is often too tired even to take his wife to a movie in the evening.
Whenever labor carried the campaign for shorter hours ‘
- "into state legislatures and into Congress, employers’ lobbyists
were always there to oppose every limitation on the working
day. Long, expensive cases fought in the courts have resulted in
outstanding judicial decisions, some upholding, some nullify-
ing, the hours legislation.
Opposition to the shorter workday has been led by the power-
‘ful National Association of Manufacturers, organized in 1895.
For 30 years (1908-1938) this central agency of reaction main-
1 tained its special Washington lobbyist to interview congressmen
;and bring pressure against all progressive labor legislation.

As early as 1902, manufacturers’ representatives appeared be-
fore a Senate committee in Washington to oppose a bill limit-
ing to eight hours a day the hours of laborers and mechanics
. employed upon work done for the United States government.
And in 1926 we ﬁnd James A. Emery, general counsel of the
NAM, warning manufacturers against the ﬁve-day week which
he called “impractical.” 2

But despite bitter opposition by these organized manufac-
turers, federal wage-hour legislation ﬁnally passed in the form
-of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. When the U. S. Su-
preme Court on February 3, 1941, in an epoch-making, unani-
mous decision upheld the constitutionality of this act, it ended
a quarter century of conﬂict over the power of Congress to
regulate working conditions in private industry. The high court
has now «ruled that this power extends to intra-state activities
injurious to public health, morals or welfare and affecting inter-
state commerce.

Most of the gains in the shorter hours struggle have been won
‘by labor’s efforts, with the aid of those who advocated progres-
.sive labor legislation. Without labor’s insistence and support_,

state legislators and congressmen would never have voted for
the shorter workday. Without the solidarity of union organiza-
tion, labor would never have gained the eight-hour day or the
ﬁve-day week. These victories have been achieved by strikes;
byypersistent, tireless building of trade unions; by picket-lines
maintained in the face of starvation, blacklists, police clubs,
tear-gas- bombs, and bayonets. This story of 150 years’ struggle
against long working hours is a vital chapter in American
labor history. '

These 150 years may be divided roughly into three main
periods. In the years from 1791 to 1825, the 12 to 13-hour day
prevailed in all industry. During the latter part of this early
period came the ﬁrst industrial expansion of the young United
States and the rapid growth of an urban population.

The second period, the movement for a 10-hour day, began
about 1825 and lasted until the Civil War. ‘These were the years
of westward expansion, railroad construction, and increased
employment in all branches of industry. Trade unions were de-
veloping in every industrial center and demanding a shorter
workday. The 10-hour day was established for government em-
ployees by executive order of President Van Buren in 1840. By
1860 the 10-hour day had become the rule for skilled craftsmen,
though not for the unskilled.

During the next 70 years, from the Civil War to the economic
crisis and depression of the 193o’s, labor battled for the eight-
hour day. This struggle saw many victories and some defeats.
The United States was rising to its full height as the richest in-
dustrial nation of the world. Increased concentration of capital
and the growth of trusts during these years gave employers

, greater power in opposing trade union demands. But at the

same time organized labor was developing its own strength and
its understanding of issues affecting the workers’ welfare.
Unions were better able to relate the demand for a shorter
workday to the broader movement for progressive labor legisla-
tion. The struggle on both these fronts came to a climax in

‘ 9

 

 

1938 when the 40-hour week in interstate commerce was estab-
lished by law.

BEGINNINGS OF THE FIGHT

When the Philadelphia carpenters struck for a shorter work-
day in 1791, their community was one of the very few towns in
the United States that had a population of over three thousand.
By 1810 there were still only 16 towns of such size, but by 1840
there were 42 with a population of 3,000 or more.

Mill towns were springing into existence almost overnight in
these early years of the republic. Wherever a river furnished
water power or cheap transportation, a new industry devel-
oped. New inventions and new machines were rapidly trans-
forming handicraft into factory production.

“Mechanical improvements were being introduced into every branch
of manufacture. With increasing capital, labor-saving machinery, and
the skillful adaptation of water and steam power, the factory era was
well under way, and cotton, woolen and iron manufactures were estab-
lished on an assured basis.

“The massing of laborers in factories and workshops meant the
rapid growth of an urban population.” 3

The ﬁght for shorter hours came along with the machine
and the factory. For long centuries the working day had been
from sunup to sundown. Poverty drove the workers, agricul-
tural and handicraft, to the longest possible day. Nature set a
limit. When daylight ended, work stopped.

When the machine came, the long day carried over. At ﬁrst
no one thought to change it. Then the employers tried to
lengthen it. New lighting methods encouraged them. Samuel
Gompers said that artiﬁcial light along with steam power and
machinery brought capitalism's El Dorado, enabling the greedy
employer to lengthen the “sun to sun” workday to the “maxi-
mum of human endurance.” 4 Workers in Peterboro, New

10

 

 

Hampshire_, in 1846 protested against the factory custom of
lighting up an hour or two before sunrise. They said that this
making of “two evenings in every 24 hours” was “not only
oppressive but unscriptural.” 5

In 1822, millwrights and mechanics in Philadelphia met in
a tavern and said stoutly to one another that 10 hours’ work in
a day, from six to six, with an hour for breakfast and an hour
for dinner, was enough. But they were still too weak to do
much about it. In 1825, Boston house carpenters, 600 of them,
made labor history by forcing the 10-hour day issue. They
chose a time when building was going on busily, and struck
when the master carpenters refused their demand. Behind the
master carpenters were the real bosses, the big men who fur-
nished the money and the materials for the building. These
bound themselves not to hire men who were pledged to each
other to refuse to work the “customary hours”—an idea they
said that must be “of foreign growth”; nor would they engage
master carpenters who hired such men.

The American labor movement was born of the shorter hours’
ﬁght. In 1827, Philadelphia mechanics went on strike for the
10-hour day. That same year other craftsmen joined with the
mechanics in the ﬁrst “city central,” the Mechanics’ Union of
Trade Associations. Out of this, the next year, grew the ﬁrst
labor party, the Working Men’s party.“ New York craftsmen
won the 10-hour day by 1829‘, aggressively resisted employer
attempts to lengthen it, and followed the Philadelphia workers’
example with a Working Men’s party.

New England workers continued to make history. In 1832,
they organized the New England Association of Farmers, Me-

chanics and Other V/Vorking Men. The latter included factory '

employees. It was thus a sort of industrial union. Its ﬁeld was

both economic and political. Its members pledged themselves

to demand the 10-hour day; taxed themselves for a war chest

to help those penalized for such action; and ordered state vigi-
1 1

 

 

lance committees to promote reduction of hours through leg-
islation. ’

The Association gave strength to Boston ship carpenters and
caulkers who were conducting a bitter strike for 10 hours in
1832. Again it was the big men, the merchants and shipowners,
tied in, with the growing New England manufacturing concerns,
who took the lead in breaking the strike.'’ Boston and Charles-
town shipyards locked out both the organized journeymen and
the master carpenters who employed them.

All along the Atlantic seaboard, ship carpenters and caulkers
were raising their 1o-hour demands. In Washington, in 1833,
carpenters determined to break the custom which they said
bound them to their benches 15 to 17 hours a day. That same
year in Baltimore, 17 crafts joined to demand 10 hours. In
Paterson, in 1835, cotton operatives went out against 131/,'
hours, asking for 11; they went back to work 12.

That year, 1835, was the banner" year in 10-hour history.
Starting in Boston, the demand went southward, taking in
industrial towns in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In Philadelphia, it started with
coalheavers on the docks, and spread to carpenters, bricklayers,
plasterers, masons, hodcarriers, painters; then to leather dressers,
smiths, plumbers; then to the pieceworkers—cord wainers,
cigarmakers_, saddlers, printers; then to bakers whose demand
was for suspension of baking on Saturday nights and Sundays.

Public opinion was changing. As usual the press was critical
even when forced to agree that labor’s demands were justified.
A hostile ﬁnancial editor admitted that a 10-hour day was long
enough, but objected to the Way the Philadelphia workers went
at it to get the reduction. Parades with ﬁfe and drum, placards
berating the “bloodthirsty aristocrats” were not to his liking.
Master craftsmen met and voted to reduce the working day to
ten hours. Municipal workers shared in the gain. \

Starting in Philadelphia in 1836 when navy yard employees

petitioned the President of the United States for a 10-hour day,
a campaign developed to extend shorter-hour beneﬁts to gov-
ernment workers. This movement resulted in the famous execu-
tive order; issued by President Martin Van Buren on March 31,
1840, establishing the 10-hour day on all government works.

By 1840, under the impetus of this federal order, the prin-
ciple of the 10-hour day was thus established for mechanics.
But cotton mill employees were still toiling 11, 12 or 13 hours
out of the twenty-four.

As in England, where the 10-hour day was ﬁnally established

by law in 1848, legislation for a straight 10-hour day for all‘

was now sought in this country. Factory hours had been 14, 16,
even 18, around 1800. In 1839 in New England they averaged
731/2 a week the year round. The manufacturers’ drive for
proﬁts dominated the scene. It kept factory hours long; it also
retarded the craftsmen’s unions. Mill owners were fearful that
the shorter workday would invade the factory. There is testi-
mony)that they would go to the master carpenters and forbid
them to hire “ten hour men.”

So craftsmen led off in the ﬁght for 10-hour legislation. They
based their demand on health needs. They said that 12 and 15
hours were too much for the physical nature of man to stand.
It was a big ﬁght. “Factory girls” of Lowell and other textile
towns in the interest of “future generations” took a spirited

‘ part. So did many other good citizens. There were great public

meetings, monster petitions, legislative investigating commis-
sions. In one factory in Philadelphia, $100 was raised to help get
the 10-hour law throughout the country. In many places em-
ployers victimized workers who took part in the movement.
Results were meager. Ten-hour laws, all limited in various
ways and, as it proved, unenforceable, were passed in New
Hampshire (1847), Pennsylvania and Maine (1848), Rhode
Island and far away California (1851), Ohio (1852), Connecti-
cut (1855). Massachusetts, leading industrial state, and scene of
the greatest agitation, did not get a 10-hour law for another

13

 

decade. Legislative efforts were more and more directed to the
protection of women and minors. ’

In the ﬁfties, trade union efforts for a shorter day swung back
mainly to the ﬁght on the job. The unions had gained in
strength. They saw something better than a standard day ﬁxed
by law. By strikes and trade agreements, they could shorten
their day; and then perhaps shorten it some more. If the em-
ployer broke the agreement, they could strike again.

They were seeing their problem anew at other points, too.
They were now interested in making jobs for the unemployed.
This they believed shorter hours would do. They also believed
that in an expanding industrial situation, wages would go up
as hours shortened. Employers feared the ﬁght on the job. In
1853 in many plants the 11-hour day was adopted to head off
reduction to ten.

The 35 years of the 10-hour day struggle, beginning about
1825, saw the westward movement of the population in the
greatest territorial expansion of American history. Railroad
construction in the West created a demand for materials and
meant employment for thousands of wage-earners, skilled and
unskilled. --

Forges, foundries, machine and car-shops were booming. Im-
proved machinery was introduced in every branch of manufac-
ture. With the invention of the sewing machine in 1846, the
needle trades and the shoe industry were revolutionized. Agri-
cultural machinery, especially the McCormick reaper, was
transforming the new West.

“The twenty years’ interval between the crisis of 1837 and that
of 1857 witnessed the most remarkable industrial development yet
achieved in the United States. The wealth of the country was quad-
rupled in this ‘golden age.’ Riches multiplied more rapidly than
population. Our per capita wealth in 1860 was more than double

that of 1840, more than three times that of 1790." 8
l

This industrial expansion was not seriously affected by the
ﬁnancial panic of 1857. Most producers were little disturbed
by the crisis and no prolonged depression followed Wall Street’s
temporary «setback. But the years of Civil War brought funda-
mental changes, reflected in the young labor movement.

THE EIGHT-HOUR STRUGGLE DEVELOPS

During the Civil War years there arose a movement for a
general eight-hour day. A few unions had already won this
demand. Carpenters and caulkers in the Charlestown Navy
Yard had it as early as 1842. But 10 hours was the rule for
craftsmen. The unskilled usually toiled a much longer day.

Skilled workers were now eagerly joining unions, and or-
ganizing on a national scale. Booming war industries created a

demand for such men, but their wages rose much more slowly

than prices and proﬁts. They ﬁgured that when the soldiers
returned to the labor market there would be wage reductions.
Through their unions and new Eight-Hour Leagues they began
to agitate for an eight-hour day. V/Vhen the post-war depression
came on and unemployment retarded union activity, the cam-
paign for eight-hour legislation took on vitality. It uniﬁed the
workers and paved the way for the ﬁrst national labor or-
ganization.

Delegates from trade unions, other workingmen’s organiza-
tions and Eight-Hour Leagues met in Baltimore in 1866 and
organized the National Labor Union. One of the leaders was
Ira Steward of the Boston Union of Machinists and Blacksmiths
who had worked out a plan of action to win the eight-hour day
and enforce it through the labor vote. Another leader was
William H. Sylvis, of the Molders International Union, “the
ﬁrst great ﬁgure in the American labor movement.” 9

At the Baltimore Congress the question of the eight-hour day
was a main issue. Legislation was the method endorsed. Em-
ployers’ organizations to ﬁght unions were springing up in

15

every industrial center. Yet the National Labor Union frowned
on strikes and favored political action, whether through a labor
party or through labor pressure for planks and support of
pledged candidates. The delegates went home to work earnestly
for labor laws. In 1867, through NLU activity, eight-hour bills
were introduced in more than a dozen state legislatures. In six
they became laws—Illinois, Wisconsin (for women and chil-
dren), Connecticut, California, New York and Missouri.

The year 1868 was a milestone in the shorter hours move-
ment. From time to time during the previous six years Congress
had considered the question of an eight-hour law for govern-
ment employees. Under the leadership of the National Labor
Union the campaign gained headway until Congress ﬁnally
passed the act of June 25, 1868, establishing the eight-hour day
for all government laborers, workmen and mechanics.

This limitation on working hours was upheld in an opinion
by the Attorney General. President Grant in 1869 issued a
proclamation directing that no cut in wages should accompany
the reduction in hours. By federal law, the principle of an
eight-hour working day was thus recognized in the United
States.

But neither federal nor state legislation met the expectations
of the men and women who had fought hard to get it. State
eight-hour laws were limited to jobs where there were no con-
tracts to the contrary; and all were unenforceable. When the
National Labor Union met in 1867 it had admitted the laws
might as well never have beenpassed. It said that they were
“frauds on the laboring classes.”

Labor was learning through experience. Also years of indus-
trial recovery soon gave the unions a better chance for success-
ful strikes. As early as 1868_, miners and other workers in
Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, struck militantly but without
avail for the eight-hour day. That year New York -bricklayers.
also went out with the same demand.

In 1871, New York building trades workers conducted a.

16 6

 

 

t.._..4.._.-.___, _..,._.,-.-_....,_...__ .,

 

spirited demonstration for the enforcement of the state eight-
hour law and to make the eight-hour day standard for all
workers. Negro workers and New York sections of the Inter-
national Working1nen’s Association participated. The Interna-
tional had been started in London in 1864 under the leadership
of Karl Marx. In 1866, it had endorsed eight hours as “the legal
limit of the working day.”

Eight-hour strikes were widespread in 1872. Outstanding was
the renewal of the New York building trades workers’ activity.
Nearly 100,000 went out in a three months’ struggle. It was the
largest strike on record up to that time. On June 10, workers
ﬁlled the streets of downtown New York in a great parade with
music, banners and militant slogans. When the strike ended the
eight-hour day had been won by bricklayers, carpenters, plas-
terers, plumbers, painters, stone-cutters, stone masons, and
others.

It was not a permanent victory. Only the stone-cutters were
able to keep their gains during the bitter depression of the mid-
seventies. And meanwhile the new employers’ organizations
were active in their opposition to the workers’ ﬁght. Neverthe-
less_, a gain was registered. For whereas earlier in the century,
employers were ﬁghting against the 10-hour day, now they were
ﬁghting to keep it against labor’s demand for eight. -

During the 20 years following the Civil ‘Var, a new burst of
economic development throughout the United States was in-
terrupted only by the crisis and depression of the mid—seventies.
It was mainly a period of unparalleled industrial expansion.
In these two decades the total wealth of the country increased
from $16 billion in 1860 to $43 billion in 1880, a gain of nearly
170 per cent.

“Universal buoyancy and unbounded conﬁdence in the future ren-
dered it easy to borrowimoney at home and abroad. . . .The annual
output of pig iron was doubled, that of coal quadrupled, while the
production of steel increased a hundred-fold in the decade following
on the war. . . . '

“The development of manufactures was no less phenomenal than
that of mines. New inventions and improved machinery stimulated
business enterprise in every line of production. . . . Notable among the
material achievements of the war period was the utilization of a new
and valuable raw material, petroleum.” 1°

But labor had little share in this material prosperity. The
increase in industrial output during these post-Civil War years
far exceeded the gains in employment and in total wages paid.
Speed-up and new machinery in the plants meant greater out-
put per man-hour. Fewer workers were producing more in
less time. I

The economic crisis and panic of 1873 were followed by in-
dustrial depression and unemployment more severe than the
country had ever before experienced. The intense suffering of
the depression stirred workers to united action. They conducted
such militant strikes that employers were terriﬁed, and turned
to the government for help. Aid for employers came in the form
of state militia and federal troops. This was the period when
the great armories were built. They stand as monuments to
capitalism’s fear of awakening labor.

THE EIGHT-HOUR STRIKE MOVEMENT, MAY 1, 1886

When the wheels of industry began to hum again and big
proﬁts loomed, skilled workers were in process of rebuilding
unions which the economic crisis had weakened. Closing their
ranks in city centrals and national unions, they were preparing
to ﬁght for better working conditions. Once more the demand
for shorter hours became the focal point of struggle. And once
more it drove to wider labor organization.

The National Labor Union had passed off the stage about
.1872. It had been followed by the short-lived Industrial
Brotherhood. But in passing the Brotherhood left a legacy to
labor. At its last convention held in 1875 it passed a resolution

18

 

 

 

setting July 4, 1876, as the date for the eight-hour day to be
introduced by a “united movement on the part of the working
masses of the United States.”

No action resulted. Presently a new organization, formed
largely by craft unions in 1881., the Federation of Organized
Trades and Labor Unions of the United States of America
and Canada, took up the eight-hour battlecry and put teeth into
it. At its Chicago convention in 1884 it resolved that_ “eight
hours shall constitute a legal day’s work from and after May 1,
1886.”

This was a bold step. The membership of unions afﬁliated
with the F.O.T.L.U. was less than 50,000. How could it inaug-
urate a policy for all labor? The delegates went back to their
unions with the understanding that they must prepare for a
general eight-hour strike. The resolution was reaffirmed at the
1885 convention. Militant workers were now ready for action.
Old trade unions grew in membership; new ones were formed
under the stimulus of the eight-hour-day demand.

Even more ready for action than the skilled workers of the
craft unions were the unskilled and semi-skilled who worked
the longest hours. Many of them were in an organization that
was older than the F.O.T.L.U., the Knights of Labor. Locals of
the K. of L. included both skilled and unskilled workers. Dur-
ing the early eighties, the K. of L. conducted several strikes and
won great prestige with labor.

When the eight-hour cry was raised by a little-known or-
ganization, the F.O.T.L.U., members of the K. of L., and non-
members as well, assumed that this was a K. of L. program.
Members joined the eight-hour movement with enthusiasm.
Non-union men ﬂocked into K. of L. locals to take part in the
good ﬁght. About 600,000 new members came into the K. of L.
in 1885-86. Much of this growth was in early 1886 when prep-
aration for the big strike was in full swing.“

But secretly the K. of L. leadership was opposed to the eight-
hour strike. Soon, of course, the origin and leadership of the

19

 

movement became known to all. This was one big factor in the
decline of the K. of L. and the rise of the American Federation
of Labor, formed in 1886. The F.O.T.L.U. merged into the
AFL a few months after the eight-hour strike.

May 1, 1886, became historic. On that day thousands of
workers in the larger industrial cities poured into the streets,
demanding eight hours. About 340,000 took part in demonstra-
tions in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Baltimore, Washington, New York, Philadelphia, Boston and
other places. Of these nearly 200,000 actually went out on strike.
About 42,000 won the eight-hour day. Another 150,000 got a
shorter day than they had had before.

Chicago workers supported the movement most vigorously.
To combat labor organization and activity, Chicago employers
organized and acted. Pinkerton detectives and special deputies
were in evidence. Policemen were swinging billies and breaking
up knots of workers on street corners.

At the factory gates of McCormick Harvester Co., where a
strike meeting was being held on May 3, policemen swung their
clubs and then ﬁred into the running strikers. Some bystanders
had started to heckle and attack imported scabs who were leav-
ing the plant. The speaker at the meeting was August Spies, a
member of the Central Labor Union, which had supported the
May First strike. He was also a member of a militant labor group
that was at the time inﬂuential in the Chicago Labor movement.
Six workers were killed that "day and many wounded.

Anger ran high through the Chicago labor movement. About
3,000 attended a protest meeting the next day at Haymarke-t
Square. It was a peaceful meeting. Speakers were on their guard
because the workers were tense. The Chicago press reported the
speeches were less “inﬂammatory” than usual. Mayor Carter H.
Harrison who was present testiﬁed later that the meeting was
“peaceable.” But as it was about to adjourn, policemen swooped
down and ordered the audience to disperse. Then some un-

20

 

 

 

known person threw a bomb. It exploded, killing a police ser-
geant and knocking several score to the ground. The’ police

opened ﬁre. At the end of the day, seven policemen and four

Workers lay dead.

At once several Chicago labor leaders were rounded up and
thrown in jail. Eight of these ﬁnally came to trial—Albert Par-
sons, August Spies, Louis Lingg, George Engel, Michael Schwab_,
Samuel Fieldon, Adolph Fischer and Oscar Neebe. The pre-
siding judge helped pick the jury which was strongly anti-labor
and hostile to the defendants. The trial lasted 63 days. All of the
men were declared guilty of murder. All were given death sen-
tences, except Neebe who got a 15-year prison sentence.

A nationwide defense campaign won wide popular favor. The
case was appealed to the State Supreme Court which handed
down its decision in the fall of 1887. It upheld the lower courts.
At the last moment, as a result of widespread protests, the Gov-
ernor of Illinois commuted to life imprisonment the sentences
of Fieldon and Schwab. It was reported that Lingg “committed
suicide” in his cell.

On November 11, Albert Parsons, August Spies, Adolph
Fischer and George Engel were hanged. On the gallows Spies
cried, “There will be a time when our silence will be more
powerful than the voices you strangle today.” Straightway the
defense movement, now led by Albert Parsons’ widow, Lucy
Parsons, turned to efforts to have the remaining three men
freed. Fieldon, Schwab and Neebe were ﬁnally pardoned by
Governor Altgeld in 1893. He was fully convinced, he said, of
the innocence of all the eight men.

Out of the eight-hour struggle which culminated in the strike
of May 1, 1886, and its aftermath, the Haymarket tragedy,
came international May Day. In Paris, France, on July 14, 1889,
leaders from organizedproletarian movements in many coun-
tries came together to form once more an international asso-
ciation of workers, patterned after the one formed 25 years
earlier by Karl Marx. The First International_, inaugurated in

21

 

1864, had been ofﬁcially disbanded in 1872. At the ﬁrst congress
of the Second International, delegates listened to the story
related by the United States representatives, considered a re-
quest from the American Federation of Labor for support of
their eight-hour ﬁght, and voted to make May 1, 1890, a day s
for an international eight-hour day demonstration.

Demand for the eight-hour day became the main slogan of
the international May Day celebrations. At a later congress, the
International extended the purpose of the day to include wider
labor demands and world peace.”

EARLY AFL AND EIGHT-HOUR MOVEMENT

At its 1888 convention in St. Louis, the AFL had voted to
 continue the eight-hour strike movement. Amid great cheers,
May 1, 1890, was ﬁxed as the time for a second general strike.
An aggressive campaign was begun. But at the 1889 convention,
,;Et AFL officials persuaded delegates to agree to a modiﬁed program
.  whereby workers in one industry at a time should strike, all the
 , others supporting these—this process to continue until all had
 won eight hours.

But the ﬁnal effect of this procedure was to slow down the
Whole movement. At ﬁrst it seemed to promise good results.
 The Brotherhood of Carpenters, chosen to lead off, had a large

 

M; membership, a solid organization and a sizeable treasury. For

l

. K '

f :.i :3 others got their hours reduced to nine. In other building trades,
4

several years it had been accumulating a war chest for an eight-
hour drive. The AFL levied an assessment on its afﬁliated unions
and engaged paid organizers to help the carpenters.

As a result of this second May First strike in 1890, about r
46,000 carpenters in 137 cities won the eight-hour day; many

too, the eight-hour day was widely won, often by local strikes.
‘$53 By 1891 all branches of this industry in Chicago, St. Louis,

-  Denver, Indianapolis and San Francisco were working eight

 hours. In New York and Brooklyn, carpenters, stone—cutters,
"“ 22

 

 

painters, and plasterers had won eight hours; bricklayers,
masons and plumbers, nine.“ .

Gains were not conﬁned to the building trades. A large pro-
portion of all the strikes between 1888 and 1890 were for shorter
hours. When in 1891 Gompers called on the national unions
affiliated with the AFL to name three things on which that body
should concentrate, every union included in its list the reduc-
tion o-f working hours.

Miners had been chosen to strike after the carpenters had
won their demand. But that strike was never called. The United
Mine Workers had been weakened by a long struggle in Penn-
sylvania. Large sectioris of the miners were still outside the
union. Gompers later admitted that a strike by miners at that
time could have been easily defeated.

Leading AFL oﬂicials were in fact growing cooler toward the
eight-hour strike movement. In 1892 and for several years there-
after, the convention merely instructed the Executive Council
to continue the eight-hour education and agitation. Attempts
to revive the movement on May 1, 1896, and again in 1897, were
not successful. Thus this phase of the shorter hours’ struggle
came to an end.

During these years, which saw the rise and decline of the
eight-hour strike movement, workers made substantial gains in
hours reduction. The unions were gaining in strength, becom-
ing a stable factor in industry in the United States. A depression
with mass unemployment lasting from 1893 to 1897 failed to
destroy them. Militant strikes in steel, mining and railroads
marked these years, including the great Homestead steel strike
(1892) and the Pullman strike (1894) which brought Eugene V.
Debs and his program of industrial unions into national promi-
nence. A strike led by the United Mine Workers in 1897 won
the eight-hour day along with wage increases and union recog-
nition. Organized employers beginning in 1888 added to their
list of weapons the injunction, destined to be used increasingly

Jo

until organized labor forced its limitation in the Norris-
LaGuardia Act of 1932.

By the end of this century of struggle for shorter hours, the
normal working week in the United Stateslin manufacturing,
building trades, coal mining, transportation, and for unskilled
workers and government employees was 57.3.14 The mass of the
workers had gained the 10-hour day. Some groups of workers
had won eight hours. But hundreds of thousands still worked
a 12-hour shift.

WINNING SHORTER HOURS, 1900-1920

With the turn of the century came a new development in
American industry. The monopoly stage of capitalism was tak-
ing the place of earlier capitalist forms. Marked by greater con-
centration of production and capital, by merging of bank capi-
tal with industrial capital and the appearance of a ﬁnancial
oligarchy, this new stage meant increased power in the hands
of a few.

By 1890 there were in the United States about 4,000 mil-
lionaires and multi—millionaires, whose property aggregated
$12,ooo,ooo,ooo. At that time the rich made up 9 per cent of the
population and held 71 per cent of the wealth; the well-to-do
were 28 per cent of the population and owned 20 per cent
of the wealth; the poor made up 63 per cent of the population,
but could claim only 9 per cent of the wealth.”

This estimate on the concentration of wealth in the hands
of a few was widely quoted in labor papers of the time. It
revealed class contrasts which were becoming more and more
marked in the United States.

By 1904 there were 318 industrial trusts (apart from railroads

and utilities) which represented consolidations or mergers in?

volving 5,288' separate plants. Three-fourths of these trusts

had been incorporated after 1897. The giant U. S. Steel Corp.,

for example. formed in 1901 by the J. P. Morgan interests,
24

 

_ #...»-

represented a combination of the leading steel ﬁrms in the
country. Of 78 large industrial companies in 1904, 26 controlled
at least 80 per cent of their own industry.“

Such trustiﬁcation of industry naturally gave employers
greater strength in opposing workers’ demands. By 1902 the
already powerful National Association of Manufacturers was
centering its anti-labor attacks on the national eight-hour law.
These organized industrialists boasted that their resolution to
Congress and their telegrams to individual congressmen de-
feated the 1902 bill for extension of the hours law. They
denounced the proposed improvement as “a socialistic and
artiﬁcial measure.” The National Association of Manufacturers
and the anti-labor League for Industrial Rights were together
counted responsible for “having secured the defeat of all eight-
hour measures from 1902 to 1912.” 17

But labor too was developing its strength. The American
Federation of Labor increased its membership from about
350,000 in 1899 to over 1,676,000 in 1904. Every year the Federa-
tion went on record for: “Eight hours for work, eight hours for
rest, eight hours for what we will.” In a real program for pro-
gressive reduction of hours, the eight-hour day was the next
logical step. But gradually, under the leadership of Samuel
Gompers, the Federation drifted into a period of inactivity
when it did little or nothing effectively to demand a shorter
working day. Around 1900 it withdrew from any national
hours movement, leaving to the separate unions all efforts to
shorten hours by militant action or other strategy. At its 1907

convention the AFL recorded this negative position in the

report of its committee on the eight-hour day. It declared that
it was not at that time in favor of universal aggressive action for
the establishment of the eight-hour day in as much as some
trades were working 10 hours a day or in some instances longer.

Taking the struggle into their own hands, granite cutters in
1900 went out on strike for the eight-hour day and won it by
their strength and determination. Over 140,000 hard coal

25

 

 

 

 

miners, led by the United Mine Workers of America, went out
in May, 1902, for the eight-hour day and other demands. Miners
had been working 10 hours a day, six days a week.“ It was a ﬁve
months strike, bitterly fought by the Morgan interests who
owned the largest anthracite mines.

Operators were certain they could open the mines if given
enough military “protection.” Governor Stone of Pennsylvania
on October 6, 1902, obligingly sent in 9,000 men of the National
Guard, but still no one could be found to mine coal. Finally,
President Theodore Roosevelt accepted  P. Morgan's proposal
for an anthracite commission to arbitrate the strike. No labor
representative was included on the commission; its decision was
a weak compromise. But winter was at hand; strike funds were
exhausted; miners’ families were starving; and a small majority
voted to accept the commission's ﬁndings. The men went back
to work with certain gains, including the nine-hour day—not
the eight hours they had demanded but an hour less than before
the strike.

Soft coal miners had won the eight-hour day on April 1, 1898,
as a result of their nationwide strike in the previous year.
April 1 is always celebrated in the coal ﬁelds as the anniversary
of this eight-hour victory.

Printers organized in the Typographical Union A (later -the
International Typographical Union) at ﬁrst sought the eight-
hour day by a gradual reduction of working time. Their 1902
convention decided that local union contracts should provide

. for a 15-minute decrease in the day’s work for each of four
succeeding years. But such resolutions were not enough. Spo-

radic strikes for the eight-hour day were followed by a‘ nation-
wide strike of union printers, beginning in January, 1906, and
lasting most of that year. Special assessments to ﬁnance the
strike totaled $3,500,000 in two years. By 1907 the union conven-
tion could record that the eight-hour day was established in
all large cities except Kansas City and Nashville, Tennessee.
26

 

 

 

It was a “struggle that will live forever in the history of the
Union.” 19

Twelve years later the printers were seeking a 44-hour week
to assure *the Saturday half-holiday. But another long strike,
starting May 1, 1921, was necessary before printers in the
stronger locals ﬁnally won their 44-hour week demand. At every
stage of this struggle employer interests fought against shorter
hours. Manufacturers who had adopted the so-called American
Plan threatened in 1921 to boycott any printing establishment
that granted" its employees the 44-hour week. But the strongly
organized printers moved on from victory to victory until by
1931 they began to negotiate contracts for the 40-hour, ﬁve-
day week. a

Clothing workers, too, found the strike a necessary weapon
for shortening hours of work. The main cause of the great
Chicago strike of 35,000 men’s clothing. workers in 1910 was
“long hours.” Sweatshop conditions in the industry stood re-
vealed as the long tense ﬁght continued. But the United Gar-
ment Workers called off the strike too soon; the only gain was
an agreement with Hart, Schaffner 8c Marx for a 54-hour week
or nine hours a day for six days.

Over 100,000 New York clothing workers went on strike in
1913 for a 48-hour week, but were forced to accept a compromise.
Learning by experience that a militant industrial unionism
is necessary when unskilled employees outnumber skilled
craftsmen, these New York garment workers pioneered in or-
ganizing the independent Amalgamated Clothing Workers in
1914. One of the new union's ﬁrst demands was for the eight-

hour day. A strike of 20,000 Chicago clothing workers starting

in September, 1915, won the 50-hour week and strengthened
the union. Not until January, 1917, however, was the 48-hour
week generally established in the main clothing centers. By
1922 the Amalgamated had won the 44-hour week for 96 per
cent of all clothing workers-the ﬁrst union to secure it for
almost an entire industry.

‘LABOR RESEARCH A$SOCIATION

-INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS, NEW YORK

Threat of a nationwide railroad strike brought passage of‘

the Adamson eight-hour law in 1916. War orders were in-
creasing railroad traﬂic. Health and safety demanded fewer
hours for railroadmen who had- won a basic 10-hour day but
were often required to stay on for a 16-hour run. In this 1916
ﬁght for the basic eight-hour day, the American Federation of
Labor co-operated with the rail brotherhoods. With 94 per cent
of the “Big Four” brotherhoods’ membership voting for a
strike, the date was set for September 4, 1916. On appeal from
President Wilson, Congress promptly passed the Adamson Act,
signed by the President one day before the date set for the
strike.

Railroad companies immediately began legal proceedings to
challenge the constitutionality of this eight-hour law. The

A brotherhoods again set a strike date for March 17, 1917, unless

the basic eight-hour day, with pay for overtime, was established.
It took the U. S. Supreme Court only seven hours to ﬁnd the
law constitutional. Railroad workers had demonstrated the
power of united, nationwide, organized mass action.

Two years after the World War ended, the AFL reported that
its membership had doubled, from 2,021,000 in 1914 to
4,079,000 in 1920. The leaders of this great body of organized
labor could have directed its full strength in support of un-
organized workers in the movement for shorter working hours
but did not. The test came in 1919 when 365,000 steel workers,
largely unorganized, struck against the 12-hourshift. Many
steel workers had been forced to work even 13 and 14 hours

on the night shift in alternate weeks and to take the “long _

turn” of 18 to 24 hours every second Sunday at the change of
shifts.

9 The Chicago Federation of Labor took the initiative in press-
ing for a national campaign under AFL sponsorship to organize
steel workers in all the main centers of the industry. Despite
many delays, the campaign ﬁnally got under way and organiza-
tion work continued for over a year before the strike took

28

 

 

place. William Z. Foster, as secretary-treasurer of the organizing
committee, became leader of the strike which lasted from Sep-
tember 22, 1919, to January 8, 1920.

As former general organizer for the Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen, Foster knew at first hand what railroad workers had
accomplished in 1916 by their solidarity and strength. He was
fresh from leadership of a successful campaign in Chicago pack-
ing houses for the eight-hour day, won by a joint craft—union
organizing committee. But in the great steel strike, the AFL top
leadership failed to carry out the plans adopted for organizing
steel on a comprehensive industrial union basis. AFL ofﬁcials
clung to the old craft lines which could not hold in the steel
industry.

Largely because of this weakness and the failure of 24 sepa-
rate unions to stand together, the strike was broken. Every
possible weapon of terror was used against the strikers whose

funds and resources were exhausted. But the strike was not a

failure. Investigations during and after the strike showed that
the eight-hour day could be introduced" in steel with only a
3 per cent increase in costs. I

In 1923 the American Iron and Steel Institute, employers’
association, officially eliminated the 12-hour shift. But long
hours persisted for another decade. In 1931 the eight-hour day
was still a myth in the steel mills and more than half the em-
ployees worked 10 hours a day or more. No-t until the Com~
mittee for Industrial Organization (now the Congress of
Industrial Organizations) with its Steel Workers Organizing
Committee won its historic agreement with the U. S. Steel Corp.,
March 2, 1937, was the basic eight-hour day and 40-hour week
really established in this industry.

Hours legislation has always lagged behind labor’s direct
action to secure shorter hours. Even when a law was ﬁnally
passed, such as New York's 10-hour law for bakers (1895), years
of controversy over its constitutionality delayed its enforcement.

29

 

 

On the grounds of health and public safety, lower courts up-
held the bakery 10-hour law only to have the U. S. Supreme
Court in 1905 declare it unconstitutional in a close ﬁve to four
decision on Lochner ‘U. New York. The high court refused to
admit that a baker's work was hazardous enough to justify
limiting his work day to 10 hours. This was “the ﬁrst instance
of a protective labor law invalidated by the highest court in
the land.” 2° Organized bakers of New York did not wait for
judges to agree, however. In 1905 they secured an agreement
with the bakeries limiting hours of work to 10 a day.

Oregon’s 1o-hour law for women workers was tested in 1908
in the famous case of Muller 22. Oregon. Muller, owner of a
laundry, had employed a woman more than 10 hours in one
day, was ﬁned $10, and had appealed to the higher courts.
Arguing that women’s health needed special protection, Louis
D. Brandeis, later a Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, pre-
sented a signiﬁcant brief on medical and economic reasons why
women should not work more than 10 hours a day. The Supreme
Court in a unanimous decision upheld the 10-hour law, thus
setting a precedent for upholding hours legislation for women.
In 1915 the high court declared constitutional even the very
inclusive California eight-hour law, the ﬁrst state to establish
a maximum eight-hour day and 48-hour week law for women.

State laws limiting hours of work for women and children
were usually passed before any general hour laws. By 1914 a
majority of the states had laws limiting the work of children
under 14 to eight or nine hours a day. But in the South children
were still allowed to work 10 or more hours. V

By its historic decision, Bunting 11. Oregon, the Supreme
Court in 1917 upheld Oregon’s 1o-hour law which included
men and was the ﬁrst general hours statute to come before the
highest court. Applying to all mills and factories the law pro-
vided for a 10-hour day and allowed three hours’ overtime if
paid for at overtime rates. In this case the high court quoted
withapproval the state supreme court's statement: “The cus-

30

 

tom in our industries does not sanction a longer service than
10 hours a day.” .

Thus courts were still debating the constitutionality of 10-
hour law: during the years when’ strong unions were winning
the eight—hour day. In reversing its earlier (1905) position on
hour laws for men, the Supreme Court’s 1917 decision quoted
the shorter hour schedules for workers in other countries and
said the average workday in the United States was then 9%
hours. Trade union gains were thus gradually extended through
hour laws that covered unorganized as well as organized
workers.

IN THE 192o’s

During the World War years there were sharp reductions in
hours throughout industry. Labor shortage gave the trade
unions an advantage which they followed up successfully.
Notable gains were made. Between 1914 and 1919 the number
of factory operatives working the eight—hour day more than
quadrupled. In 1919 the International Labor Conference
sought to standardize the eight-hour day, but the leading in-
dustrial countries did not ratify the proposal on this subject.
Powerful forces were” operating against the shorter-hours
movement. .

During the decade between the end of the war and the be-
ginning of the great economic crisis in 1929 some of the gains
were lost. Construction, railroad and mine workers for the most
part kept the shorter workday they had won. But the percentage
of factory employees on the eight-hour day declined from 48.6
in 1919 to 45.5 in 1929. Some companies reduced hours from
60 and 57‘ to 54 and 51 but others shifted back from 48 hours
to" 51 and«54. ‘ ' '

‘However, the 60-hour week in factories was becoming less
common. The percentage of those working 60 hours dropped
from 12.1 in 1919 to 7.4‘ in 1929". And while in 19‘14"only 25.2

per cent of the factory labor force worked less than 54 hours,
in 1929 the percentage was 70.4. “It is roughly true, then, that
the 40 years [1890-1930] saw a shift from the typical 1o-hour
day in manufactures to the typical eight-nine hour day.” 21
Organized labor’s ﬁght for shorter hours has been the chief
factor in getting the reductions, and trade union members on
the whole enjoy the shortest hours. Available ﬁgures since 1914
show that the average weekly hours of these unionized workers
tend to be from four to six less than for labor in general. But
this is only part of the story. Standards set by the unions tend

to lower hours for all. And organized labor has led the ﬁght for _

shorter-hours legislation covering unorganized workers.
Characteristic of the twenties was the wide public discussion
of the possibility of shorter hours and especially of the shorter
workweek. The post-war depression brought unemployment
to some six million in 1921. Thousands of demobilized soldiers
returned home, looking for jobs. Technological improvements
increasingly displaced men and took jobs away from more than
two million workers between 1915 and 1930. These machines
also intensiﬁed the speed-up.
- During the decade a few ﬁrms experimented successfully
with the ﬁve-day week. These were much discussed and Henry

. Ford made the headlines when in 1926 he announced that his

plants would now go on a ﬁve-day week basis. It was in fact‘ a
policy of intensiﬁed speed-up. As Ford himself put it later, he
would “pay six days’ pay for six days’ work done in ﬁve days.”

New impetus was given the ﬁve-day week discussion by the
AFL’s adoption later in 1926 of a ﬁve—day week program. The
AFL had long been on record for a shorter workweek as Well
as a shorter workday. Now it planned a campaign for the short
week. It was not to be a very energetic campaign. No strike was
to be called on this issue alone. But every affiliated national
union was now to include the ﬁve-day week in its demands on
employers.

There was a driving force behind employers’ experiments,

32

 

 

 

public discussion andthe new AFL policy. It was the ﬁght of

workers on the job. Under left-wing leadership, workers’ mili-9

tancy and sense of unity reached new high levels during this
decade. In 1919 the New England textile industry had been
swept by a renewed eight-hour movement. Mill workers wanted
a straight eight-hour day with no reduction in weekly earnings.
In Paterson, New Jersey, that year broad silk workers were
among the ﬁrst in the textile industry to strike and win the 44-
hour week. In Colorado in 1927 coal miners included in strike
demands enforcement of the state eight-hour law. In the South
in 1929, workers at Marion, North Carolina, launched a bitter
strike against a company refusal to grant a ten—hour day with-
out wage reduction.

A major demand in some of the historic strikes of the twenties
was for the ﬁve—and-a-half or ﬁve-day week. As early as 1908
some workers, through collective bargaining, had won the
Saturday holiday or half-holiday. Between 1915 and 1919 the
Saturday afternoon off became somewhat common in the or-
ganized buildingtrades and in business offices; it was beginning
to be granted in factories. United Mine Workers had included
the ﬁve—day week in their 1919 demands. That same year the
44-hour week was an issue in the Seattle and Tacoma metal
trades strike, out of which developed the Seattle general strike.

In the twenties the great textile strikes in Passaic, New
Jersey (1926), and Gastonia, North Carolina (1929), included
44 and 40-hour week demands. In New York the ladies’ garment
workers struck among other things for 40 hours and the
furriers extended a 40-hour demand to include 32 hours in the
slack season. Men’s clothing workers and the metal trades de-
partment of the AFL were also campaigning vigorously for the
ﬁve-day week. Thus the shorter workweek gained ground,
though slowly. By 1929 about a million workers, especially in
the clothing, building, and printing industries were enjoying
the Saturday half-holiday or its equivalent.

Great credit must go to the workers of the twenties who held

33

 

old shorter-hours gains and made some new ones. For the or-
ganized employers were arrayed against them more aggressively
than at any previous time. Corporations dominated the post-
war scene. Their coﬂfers were bulging with war proﬁts; their
prestige was high because of their seeming patriotism and
their “liberal spirit.” Employers were paying lip-service to a
new American philosophy of high wages and prosperity for
all. They talked of shorter hours—to be attained through a
process of “natural evolution.” They organized “works coun-
cils” and “employee representation plans” (company unions)
and seemed to the public to be negotiating with their employees
for shorter hours.

But at the same time they were ﬁnancing such great anti-labor
agencies as the National Association of Manufacturers, the
Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and a new organi-
zation with even more speciﬁc purpose, the American Plan-
Open Shop Conference. They were in fact concerned through-
out the decade with one thing—the continuation of proﬁt-
making. And this, they believed, called for the smashing of the

V trade unions and all the things for which organized labor had

fought. There was no room in their American Plan for shorter
hours enforced by the power of organized workers.

IN THE CRISIS YEARS

Then came the economic crisis, with closing factories and
mounting unemployment. By November, 1933, nearly one-third
of the workers previously listed as gainfully occupied were job-
less. Labor’s gains including shorter hours were engulfed in
the great catastrophe. To be sure, hours were shortened during
this period. But it was not through labor’s ﬁght nor through
progressive legislation, but through the application of the em-
ployers’ stagger system. Many workers hung on to their jobs
but were employed for and paid for fewer hours. ’

“Work-sharing,” as the employers called it, was in fact‘ an

34

 

 

 

offensive against labor’s living standards. Dividing wages was

V part of the scheme. Labor called it the “share-the-misery’?

system.

In the early months of the crisis, the six-hour day, ﬁve-day
week or its equivalent was instituted in the automobile, steel,
electrical manufacture, telegraph and telephone, oil, construc-
tion, food, publishing, and other industries. A 1932 survey by
the U. S. Department of Commerce indicated that one-ﬁfth of

the workers employed had been kept on by a share-the-work-

policy and that the proportion was expected to reach 37 per cent.

Organized labor meanwhile was turning to regulation’ and
legislation. Mass unemployment lent weight to labor’s argu-_
ment that hours should be shortened tomake jobs. A demand

_ by the railroad brotherhoods for a six-hour day on the rail-‘

roads was argued before the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The AFL focused its shorter-hour movement in a 30-hour" bill
in Congress. The Federation-thus abandoned its position that,
in general, hours should be shortened by trade unionvagreee
ment while leaving special classes of workers to be protected by
law. , _-
Known as the Black bill, the AFL measure would have made‘
the 30-hour week, six-hour day mandatory on employers-_ en~_
gaged in interstate or foreign commerce. AFL officials said that
this would make jobs for 6,500,000 of the unemployed.‘ Their
organ, the American Federationist, argued that a 28-hour week
would give work to all. But the effect of the bill had it become
law would have been to cut wages and throw the burden of
the unemployed upon the backs of those who still‘ had some sort
of jobs. ' .

This was clearly seen by the more progressive sections of
the labor movement. Urging that the bill was only legalizing
work-sharing unless it also provided for a minimum wage, alert
workers were active‘ in getting the billgamended.‘ As a result,

though the Black bill passed ‘the Senate with no such.:-pV1;c>_visio,r1,‘_

35.

 

 

a ‘minimum-wage amendment was ﬁnally added to the com-
panion bill in the House.

As the depression worsened, the AFL bill and employers’
share-the-work plan were merged into President Roosevelt’s
legislative program. The keystone of the New Deal was the
National Industrial Recovery Act, passed in 1933. This carried
maximum hour and minimum wage provisions. Big business
was in the main behind it. For one thing, business men knew
that concessions must be made to labor. For another, they were
to draw up and administer the industrial codes which would
contain the labor provisions. AFL officials also endorsed the
recovery act.

Pending the adoption of codes providing for maximum’

hours and minimum wages Roosevelt’s “Blanket Code” was
presented to business. This called for a 3 5-hour maximum week
for factories; 40 hours for white-collar workers. Many excep-
tions were permitted. Though the code’s acceptance was op-

. tional with employers, it was widely adopted.

VVhen the codes were established a majority extended maxi-
mum weekly hours to 40. Numerous exceptions were allowed.
There was no guarantee of minimum hours. There were no
restrictions on speed-up which became the rule. Agencies set up
by the National Recovery Administration for enforcement of
the codes were widely deﬁed by big business. Workers seeking
the protection of NRA went vainly from official to ofﬁcial, from
agency to agency. They called the NRA the National-Run-
Around. '

Progressive leadership in the unions sought actively to have
maximum hours in the codes lowered, loopholes closed, speed-
up eliminated, violators brought to heel. Meantime in some
industries shorter hours were included in. strike demands. In
1933, strikers in the Ford Motor Co. plant in Edgewater, New
Jersey, demanded the 30-hour week; in the E. G. Budd manu-
facturing plant in Philadelphia, the 35-hour week. Ford and

36

 

 

 

Budd along with E. T. Weir of Weirton Steel Co. were among
the industrial barons who most ﬂagrantly deﬁed the NRA.
Shortening of hours in general resulted from or accompanied
the NRA: The AFL estimated that the workweek was shorter
by four and a half hours at the end of 1933 than it had been
a year before. With business still lagging, two or three days’
work a week was all that was available for millions of workers.
That the shorter workweek had not given jobs to the jobless in
any large way was shown by the ﬁgures. Unemployment at the
end of 1933 still stood around 16 million, as estimated by the
Labor Research Association and the Alexander Hamilton In-
stitute. ~ .
The shorter-hours movement on the whole gained ground
during the crisis years. Maximum hours became part of the
law of the land, along with the minimum wage. Although the
National Industrial Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional
by the United States Supreme Court in 1935, later legislation
provided in new ways for shorter hours and a minimum wage.

\

THE BASIC FORTY-HOUR WEEK

For the ﬁrst time in American history a law was passed in
1936 that established labor standards in plants making ma-
terials, supplies, articles, and equipment for the U. S. govern-
ment. This was the Public Contracts Act of 1936, known also
as the Walsh-Healey Act. Under its terms workers engaged on
any government contract exceeding $10,000 in value must be
assured of the basic eight-hour day and 40-hour week and must
be paid not less than the prevailing minimum wage of the
industry and locality. Overtime hours must be paid at over-
time rates, established as one and one—half times the basic
hourly or piece rate.

In efforts to strengthen this law, the Congress of Industrial
Organizations and other progressive groups proposed amend-
ments to lower to $4,000 the value of contracts subject to the

act, to include shipbuilding, and to require contractors to obey
provisions of both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the
National Labor Relations Act. But the National Association of
Manufacturers with the co-operation of War and Navy depart-
ments succeeded in 1939 in striking out these amendments.

Under Public Act No. 671 (1939), the President is permitted
to “suspend any or all of the laborstandards when in his judg-
ment such a course is in the public interest.” Loopholes in the
act itself allow suspension of its provisions if a government
department head decides the government’s business would be
impaired by complying with its standards.

Despite its loopholes, however, the Public Contracts Act
paved the way for further progressive legislation to shorten
hours of work. By 1937 President Roosevelt in his special mes-
sage to Congress (May 24) was calling for some means to be
found that would insure “to all our able-bodied working men
and‘ women a fair day’s. pay for a fair day’s work.” He pointed
out that “One-third of our population . . . is ill-fed, ill-clothed
and ill-housed.” His message reﬂected the demands of organized
labor for adequate wages and hours legislation.

It took another year before progressives in Congress could
overcome the opposition of ﬁlibustering reactionaries who were
blocking passage of wage-hour measures. Finally the 75th Con-
gress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, signed by
the President on June 25, 1938.

Hours of work in industries affecting interstate commerce
were progressively cut, under terms of this act, to 44 a week the
ﬁrst year, 42 the second year, and then to 40 a week from Octo-
ber 23, 1940. Overtime work must be paid for at.the rate of
time-and-a-half for hours worked beyond 40 a week. The U. S.
Supreme Court on February 3, 1941, held the law constitutional.

Some 13 million workers or about one-third of all wage and
salary workers in the United States are in industries covered by
the Fair Labor Standards Act. About two million who had been
working longer hours gained the basic 40-hour week in Octo-

38

 

 

 

V ber, 1940, under this law. But the law speciﬁcally excludes many

millions—employees in stores and other retail establishments;
seamen; transport, farm and agricultural cannery workers; and
employees‘ in administrative, professional or executive work.
This last group is now so broadly interpreted that even those
earning only $30 a week are excluded from the law's overtime
provisions.

Workers in food processing, vegetable packing and canning
have always been subjected to abnormally long hours during
rush seasons. But the Fair Labor Standards Act speciﬁcally ex-
empted these industries, ﬁrst for 14 and then for 28 weeks, from
the maximum hours and overtime provisions.

Violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been all
too common. “The best way to enforce a law is to enforce it,” said
Colonel Philip B. Fleming, Administrator of the Department
of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, reporting on the act in
September, 1940. “The morning after a good case gets into the
papers, employers invariably line up in front of our ﬁeld ofﬁces,
check books in hand.” 22

But many thousands of wage-hour law violations never get
into the papers and many employers never do pay what they
owe to their employees in overtime wages. Colonel Fleming
admitted his division could not keep upwith investigation of
complaints, although he reported 28,795 inspections in the

year 1940.23 After the Supreme Court’s favorable decision early

in 1941 enforcement became easier but constant vigilance is
still necessary to prevent violations.

Manufacturers who had from the beginning opposed wage-
hour legislation brought out a new argument against the 40-
hour week when wartime production speeded up defense indus-
tries. They claimed that France was defeated in June, 1940,
because" French industry operated on a 40-hour week! The
United States must beware, they argued, lest it fall into the same
trap which caught France. They overlooked the fact that the
French government had abandoned the 40-hour week two years

39

 

 

 

 

 

before France fell. Not 4o-hour week regulations but Nazi sym-
pathizers, the real ﬁfth column of traitors within France, were
responsible for the fall of the French republic.

Supplementing the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Pub-
lic Contracts Act, state laws setting maximum hours for women
workers in 1941 were in effect in all but ﬁve states (Alabama,
Florida, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia) . Some of these
state laws have high standards, such as 40 hours in South Caro-
lina textiles, 44 hours in almost all Oregon and Pennsylvania
industries, and 45 hours in manufacturing in Ohio. Other state
laws are very limited in their beneﬁts.

For some occupations in all states there are no legal limita-
tions whatsoever to the hours that women may work. Generally
agriculture and household service are exempted from state
laws, as they are from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.
The numerous state laws applying only to women and minors
may be regarded as stepping stones to a broad platform of
wage and hour legislation for all workers in industry.

UNIONS WIN THE FIVE-DAY WEEK

Some four million workers in the United States in 1941 had

the‘ beneﬁt of the ﬁve-day week or two daysoff in every seven.

And this beneﬁt was a direct result of trade union efforts ‘to
gain some measure of leisure for their members.

In the short space of 12 years the number of workers enjoy-
ing the ﬁve-day week increased ten times over, as shown in
surveys of the National Industrial Conference Board, employers’
research agency. In its ﬁrst study of the shorter work week, the
board found that at the close of 1928 about 400,000 employees
in‘ manufacturing and building operations were working on a
ﬁve_-_day Week basis. A few large non-union corporations such

4 as the Ford Motor Co. were using the shorter workweek as a

wage-cutting and speed-up plan, and most of the companies
granted it only as a result of union demands:

40

 

‘.-.-.w.J+...v.-..... ..-_. .—....,. ..,.,.c

 

—- 1*-v~—¢.-—-4;-w-i\y<—§.... ..

 

“Most of the instances of ﬁve-day week operation that were found
and studied are conﬁned to certain industries in which, as a rule, labor
‘is highly organized; . . . most progress in the spread of the ﬁve-day week
has probably been in the highly unionized construction industry.” 24

Soft coal miners strongly organized in the United Mine
Workers of America gained the 35-hour week by agreement
with the operators early in 1934. On the seven—hour day, ﬁve-
day week basis, this shorter workweek helped to alleviate un-
employment in the mine ﬁelds but it took vigorous union

_leadership to win the demand.

By 1936* nearly 3,000,000 employees in about 1,400 com-
panies, representing many industries, were working on a ﬁve-
day week schedule, the Conference Board reported. By March,
1940, more than 3,000,000 plant employees and a considerable
number of oﬂice workers were already on the ﬁve-day week.
More than two-thirds of the companies questioned had put
their plants on this basis. By April, 1941, when the war-tirne
emergency was stepping up output, this ern_ployer’s agency
was predicting that “a ﬁve-day work schedule but a seven-day
plant operating schedule with overlapping shifts" will become
more common as effort to secure maximum output is inten-
siﬁed.” 25 This prediction was fulﬁlled during the following
months of increased wartime production.

Wherever practicable, unions seek to have the ﬁve working
days consecutive from Monday to Friday, inclusive. Many union
contracts speciﬁcally call for this arrangement of the workweek.

Ofﬁce workers, slower to organize in trade unions, have been
slower in gaining the two days off in seven. The trend toward
the ﬁve-day week has been much less marked for office employees
than for factory workers. Less than half (47 per cent) of com-
panies on the National Industrial Conference Board list in
March, 1940, had the ﬁve-day week in their oﬂices. But the new
40-hour standard workweek, beginning in October, 1940, under
the Fair Labor Standards Act, increased the number of com-
panies adopting the two-days-off plan for oﬂice operations.“

41

 

 

Many employers, however, were still trying in every possible
way to avoid paying overtime rates to office workers. Some were
calling in experienced former employees for temporary periods,
or at rush times; others were introducing new speed-up devices

‘to reduce time required for clerical work and thus do away

with all overtime.

VACATIONS WITH PAY

In the long struggle to gain some opportunity for rest and
recreation for their members, trade unions began about 1935
to raise a demand for vacations with pay. Many salaried clerical,
technical and professional employees had enjoyed paid vaca-
tions for many years, but the movement to extend this beneﬁt
to industrial wage earners is recent. In the short period of four
years between 1935 and 1939 the National Industrial Confer-
ence Board found the proportion of representative companies
granting paid vacations had grown from 17.9 per cent to 46.4
per cent.

When. the Steel Workers Organizing Committee ( CIO)
started organizing steel workers in 1936, a majority of steel
companies hastened to grant vacations with pay, even before
the union won its ﬁrst written contracts in this industry.“
Other unions soon took up the popular demand for paid
vacations. By August, 1940, about two million union members,
including both AFL and CIO, were getting annual vacations
with pay under collective agreements with employers.

Most of the vacation plans in union agreements provide for
one week's vacation with pay after a year’s service with the
company. About half a million union members in 1940 were
working under contracts which‘ provided two weeks for all
or for part of the working force. Vacation periods of more than
two weeks annually are still rare in union agreements.

During the past two years unions have been working to
liberalize and extend vacation beneﬁts. The United Automo-

42

 

 

 

bile Workers (CIO), for example, announced in the spring of
1940 that it had recently won paid vacations through contracts
in 154 plants.

The strong United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers
(CIO) reported in September, 1941, that it had gained vaca-
tions with pay in contracts covering 370 plants and a total of
about 290,000 workers. This was a major gain over the previous
year when its contracts provided paid vacations for only 120,000
workers. In liberalizing the vacation beneﬁts, this union has
been able to win a longer vacation for those with longer service
in 106 plants, covering 127,000 employees. It has won a two-
week vacation for those employed one year in such important
concerns as the General Electric Supply Co. (Cleveland and
Los Angeles) and the Remington Rand Service; for those who
have served ten months in the Ford Instrument Co. In other
contracts this union has gained two-week vacations for those
who have worked for the company two, three, four, or ﬁve years.

PAYMENT FOR OVERTIME

Overtime-pay arrangements now form an important part of
most union agreements. As required by the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act, all work beyond 40 hours a week must be paid for at
least at the rate of time-and-a-half the regular rate. But many
unions have sought and gained better terms than this time-
and-a-half.

If work is necessary on Sundays or holidays it is a special tax
on the worker who must thus lose his most precious free time.
An increasing number of union contracts now call for double-
time pay for work done on holidays or Sundays. To protect the
ﬁve-day week, a majority of all union agreements call for time-
and—a-half for work done on Saturday, even though such Satur-
day work may not involve working beyond the full-time weekly
hours.” In a continuous process industry, however, where
Saturday, Sunday and holiday work is a regular feature of

43

 

 

 

operation, straight time is usually paid unless working hours

exceed 40 a week. ‘ 1

Of 116 union contracts analyzed by the National Industrial
Conference Board in April, 1941, about half (56) called for

' double—time payments for holiday work and 42 called for double

time on Sundays. These provisions for better overtime rates
appeared in contracts of American Federation of Labor, Con-
gress of Industrial Organizations and independent unions.
Holidays most often recognized in union contracts include New
Year’s Day, Washington’s Birthday, May Day (occasionally),
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Armistice Day
(less often), Thanksgiving, and Christmas. For these eight or
nine holidays, unions may expect to gain overtime rates.

Most of the union agreements in nine important defense in-
dustries, analyzed by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in
April, 1941, called for time-and-a-half to be paid for all work
beyond eight hours a day and 40 hours a week. Many of these
contracts also provided for double-time for work on Sundays
and recognized holidays.

In its first contract ever signed with a trade union, the Ford
Motor Co., in June, 1941, granted the United Automobile
Workers of America double-time payment for work done on
Sundays and holidays, including six main legal holidays.”
Other automobile companies also have union agreements call-
ing for this important double-time rate provision.

Under contracts signed by the United Electrical, Radio and
Machine workers up to September, 1941, some 290,000 workers
in 418 plants had secured double-time payment for Sunday or
holiday work. They represented over 90 per cent of the total
number of workers under contract. Among the important com-
panies granting this double-time rate provision are: Westing-
house Electric 8c Manufacturing Co., General Motors Corp.
(electrical division) and General Electric Co. This achievement
shows what a wide-awake union can accomplish in obtaining
beneﬁts for its members.

To reduce unemployment in the industry some unions have
stipulated in their contracts that union members shall not work
extra overtime hours while other members have no jobs. In
certain seasonal industries such as men’s and women’s clothing,
the union agreements prohibit overtime work. By this prohi-
bition the busy season is somewhat lengthened and the periods
of shut-down are curtailed.

OTHER UNION VICTORIES -

It took courage, determination, solidarity, and years of
struggle to build these unions, able to protect members against
exploitation in the form of long working hours and no leisure
time. While the stronger unions have recently made notable
gains in winning shorter hours, paid vacations, holidays and
better overtime rates, other unions are still battling against an
overlong workweek. Labor papers in 1941 recorded many
union victories on working hours.

Department store employees have traditionally been slow to
organize and their workweek has usually been longer than in
organized industries. A 25-day strike of 1,500 workers, led by
the United Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Employees
(CIO), at Gimbel Brothers’ big department store in New York
City in August-September, 1941, won the 40-hour, ﬁve-day
week. Strike pickets carried signs reading “40 and 5" as the
union's main demand. In the ﬁnal settlement strikers had their
choice between continuation of the existing 421/2 hour week,
with a weekly wage raise, and the 40-hour week. They voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the shorter hours.

These Gimbel strikers even won some protection against the
excessive hours usually worked in department stores during the
Christmas rush season. For those two weeks in December they
now have a 48-hour, six-day week, but they won two extra days
off after Christmas to compensate for the overtime work. This
is an especially important gain since state restrictions on work-

45

 

ing hours in “mercantile establishments” -are almost always
suspended during the Christmas period. By Christmas Eve most
department store employees are too exhausted to get much
pleasure out of the holiday.

Only ﬁve days after the Gimbel strike victory, ﬁve big non-
union stores in New York City granted their employees the
ﬁve-day, 4o-hour week. Other stores soon followed suit.

Metal miners in 1941 recorded a different kind of victory in
a deﬁnition of working hours as from “portal to portal.” On
petition of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers (CIO) , the Department of Labor’s wage-hour division
ruled that the workday in underground metal mining starts
when the miner reports for duty as required, at or near the
collar of the mine, and ends when he reaches the collar at the
close of the shift. Time spent on the surface in obtaining and
returning lamps, carbide, and tools, and in checking in and
out, is also a part of the working day. Metal miners, the union
pointed out, will now get eight hours pay for eight hours work
instead of eight hours pay for nine and a half hours work.

Laundry workers, often forced to put in long hours of over-
time on certain days of the week, are at last beginning to see
the beneﬁts of union organization. In Jersey City, a six-day
strike, led by the Laundry Workers International Union and
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs,
Stablemen and Helpers (both AFL) , in July, 1941, won six paid
holidays in the year, with no strings attached. The workweek
was substantially reduced. Employees who were on a 54-hour
week now work 49 hours; maintenance men who formerly put
in as much as 70 hours won a 48-hour schedule.

In a two- year ﬁght to establish a 40-hour week for cookhouse
and maintenance workers in Northwest logging camps, the

4, International Woodworkers (CIO) in July, 1941, won a court

decision putting these employees under the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act. The Timber Worker, union organ, commented: “The
decision, at one sweep, reduces the workweek from the 75 to

46

 

 

80 hours which cookhouse workers serve in many camps, to the
federal limit of 40, virtually emancipating the kitchen and
bunkhouse slaves of the industry.”

In the South a number of unions in 1941 won better over-
time rates. The International Woodworkers in Little Rock,
Arkansas, after a three—week strike signed a contract with
Koppers Wood Preserving Co. in September (1941) , making
a new and remarkable victory for southern workers. About
three-quarters of the local union membership are Negroes. The
contract provides for time—and-a—hal£ for overtime work and
also for vacations with pay. The solidarity of other unions in
the area, including AFL railroad workers in Little Rock shops,
was an’ important factor in this victory.

In Georgia the strong American Federation of Hosiery
Workers in September, 1941, signed a contract with the Albany
Manufacturing Co., also including vacations with pay. The
United Stone and Allied Products Workers (CIO) gained
double time for Sundays and holidays in a contract with the
Elberton City quarries in Georgia. .

These gains in reducing hours of work and establishing the
right to leisure are typical of many other such victories recently
won by unions in various industries all over the country.

WHERE LONG HOURS STILL PERSIST

But while trade unions have thus established the right to
some leisure for their members and federal laws have extended
the 40-hour week to several millions, other large groups are
practically untouched by such progress. Long hours persist for
household employees and farm hands who are excluded from
the beneﬁts of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Public Contracts

_ Act, and state maximum-hour laws.

Some three million, a majority of them women, are employed
in domestic and personal service, still largely unorganized.
About a million of these household employees are Negro

Women and girls. This total does not include those working
in hotels, restaurants, laundries, cleaning, dyeing and pressing
establishments, all trades in which unions have made consid-
erable headway in recent years. In household employment, the
long hours and other conditions make it particularly diﬂicult
for workers to organize to improve their status.

Seldom does the household employee ﬁnd working hours
limited to a 48-hour week. Recent studies have shown that it
is actually rare for the workweek to be even as short as 60 hours
and often it is 70, 80, and even 90 hours. Long hours and the
lack of any freedom in the evening are the main grievances of
domestic service workers. Often while the master and mistress
go out for an evening’s entertainment, the maid must stay with
the children. Or as one worker put it, when she is dead tired,
usually about 10 P.M., she must take out Madam's dog for his
evening walk. ,

V The Domestic Workers Union in New York City seeks to
win a nine-hour day, 54-hour week as a maximum; twoweeks’
vacation with pay and at least four paid holidays a year.

Another three to three and a half million who toil through
long days are the agricultural wage workers. Their day is from
sun-up to sun-down. The boss may be farm tenant, farm owner,
planter or a corporation running a great commercialized farm.

Increasing numbers of these wage workers are in the army
of seasonal labor and of these some 2,ooo,ooo were migratory
in the fall of 1g41—in spite of defense needs. Often whole
families are on the road. Some have never had a foothold on
the land. Many have been driven from their farms by poverty.
At the same time, demand for seasonal labor—but for much
less than is avai1able—has been created by the development of
industrialized agriculture. The big grower's demand has been

summarized thus: “As much labor as I want when I want it-

and a quick riddance afterward.”
Migratory workers follow the season of hops and citrus fruits,
berries and beets, onions, potatoes and lettuce, cotton and cane.

“Can—see—to-can’t-see” hours are often the lot of all—of women

as well as men; of older children and smaller children, and of
the aged.

To meet the needs offarm and processing workers, the United
Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America
was organized in 1937. It grew out of a country-wide series of
bitter strikes of agricultural labor, especially in the thirties. It
is pitted against such employer organizations as the Associated
Farmers which brings together industrialists, bankers and big
farm operators.

Thus far the chief concern of this CIO union has been with
wages and general working conditions.“ It is urging extension
of shorter-hours legislation to agriculture. A natural next step
will be limitation of the working day in the ﬁelds by union
contract.

FOR FAMILY, SOCIAL, AND CIVIC LIFE

In each period of the ﬁght for shorter hours, workers have
presented stout reasons for their demand. Most of these
appeared early and were repeated in each phase of the move-
ment, sometimes with differing emphasis. Workers have de-
manded more time for family life, more time for fun, for self
improvement, for the duties of citizenship. They have put these
natural human desires over against the employers’ argument
that shorter hours would lead to “temptations and improvident
practices”; that the effect would be bad upon “the morals and
well-being of society.”

“To give working men and women more home life, more
pride in their children,” was put forward as an argument by
leaders of the Eight-Hour Leagues in the Civil War period.
Steel workers in Pennsylvania in the 1goo’s enduring the long

day and the long week complained bitterly, “Home is just

a place where I eat and sleep. I live in the mills.” One of them
said, “As I stood at the grave of my child, I pondered that I

49

 

had never known him. I want a shorter day so I can get
acquainted with my other children.”

Organized labor’s campaigns to shorten hours in the sweated
industries; whether in mill or homework, domestic service or
on the plantation, have always emphasized the threat of long
hours to the American home. Workers have also expressed over
and overlagain their desire for the recreational and cultural
activities which long hours make difficult or impossible.

When a 10-hour bill was before the New Hampshire legisla-
ture in the 1840's, workers and their friends argued that by such
a law “operatives would be allowed the time for intellectual
and moral culture which duty to themselves and to others most
imperatively demands.” In Massachusetts, the worker wanted
shorter ho'urs legislation so that he would have “a fair chance
to use his brain as well as his muscle.”

In the 1919 steel struggle against the long day and the long
week, the argument was that while there were libraries and
recreation halls in Braddock and Homestead and Duquesne, the
steel workers were not patronizing them, nor could they with-
out more leisure.

One of the most persistent pleas for shorter hours has been
based on the worker’s desire to be a good citizen. That, he held,
required time for preparation. This was expressed most glow-
ingly in the earlier years of the ﬁght. Thus Philadelphia crafts-
men, organizing a city central body around their 1o-hour de-
mand, held that long hours were incompatible with citizenship
requirements. They did not allow the worker time for consider-
ation of public questions. He was thus condemned to an inferior
position in the state.“

Before the Massachusetts legislature in 1867 came the patri-
otic statement from those pressing for a shorter hours law: “A
laborer in the United States needs more leisure or relief from
toil than one in the same position in Europe because he has the
elective franchise and is part of the Government.” 32

- Long hours in relation tocitizenship were also an issue as

50

 

 

 

increasing numbers of the foreign-born entered industry. By
1910 there were in the United States some 13 million foreign-
born over 10. years of age. One in every four could not speak

_ English. Between 1911 and 1914 another three million arrived.

If they were to become good American citizens it was important
that they learn the principles of American democracy. A knowl-
edge of the English language was important if they were to
understand the orders and safety warnings in the factories,
participate in community life and in the activities of the labor
movement.

There was wide agitation therefore for night classes and these
were gradually opened in most industrialized cities. But often
the weary workers fell asleep over their primers. Oftener they
did not get to classes at all. A Detroit study in 1915 records that
city’s experience with education for the foreign-born and it
was typical: -

“Some of them work ten or twelve hours a day. Some of them change
shifts every week or two weeks. . . . If they ﬁnish work at six, even those
who know about the schools and are interested are not likely to feel
that they could go home, get supper and wash and change their clothes
and get to night school in time.” 33

Immigration practically ceased with the World War
(1914-18). Foreign-born workers were gradually merged with
the native-born, in industry, in the labor movement and in the
continuing struggle for shorter hours. As new leisure hours have
been won, unions have developed expanding social and educa-
tional programs for their members. Thus they are proving the
sincerity and the realism of their century-long arguments for
the shorter working day.

HEALTH AND SAFETY DEMAND REST

Older workers remember only too well the long day in the
factories, how they came in at seven in the morning and often

51

 

did not get out till after seven in the evening. During winter
months it was dark when they went in and dark again when they
came out. In clothing industries, for example, even as late as
1910, before an industrial union arose to compel regulation,
over-long hours exhausted the workers. As one study described
It:

“Working hours during the ‘rush’ seasons were indeﬁnite. It was not
uncommon to work 15 or 16 hours a day, beginning as early as 5 A.M.,
and workers frequently were even required to take bundles home with
them when they left at nine or ten o’c1ock at night. Old workers in the
trade will tell you how they often slept in the shops in order to save,
time and carfare.” 34

Effects of such a day on the worker's life and health were ob-
vious. He had no sunshine and little fresh air, except perhaps
on Sundays. His meals were hurried and irregular. Sleep was
dangerously little. Fatigue became overwhelming and ended in
what Karl Marx called “the tortures of overwork.”

Generations of workers toiling through such long days have
been stunted in growth. Tuberculosis and diseases of their
trades cut short their working years. Directly because of over-
work the lives of countless thousands ended long before they
had run the normal span of life.

Without adequate union supervision, the use of the conveyor
or belt system in industry may result in physical and nervous
strain on the workers. This fact is admitted in a recent study,
Fatigue of Workers, by the committee on work in industry 0-f
the National Research Council. Psychologists and personnel
directors who made up the committee reported:

“As soon as output standards are ‘set for conveyors, each man must
complete his job in the time prescribed. He is under pressure. . . .

Under such conditions in the automobile industry, considerable‘

fatigue developed, and we must look ahead to the time when more
and more power-driven equipment will be used.” 35

Physicians recognize the disastrous effect on the worker’s
health of such intense, rapid work. Commenting on the dangers
of speed-up, Dr. George M. Kober, a well-known authority on
industrial medicine and occupational fatigue, writes:

“Among all the fatigue factors, none is more potent than. the per-
nicious practice of ‘speeding up.’ In order to meet the demands of
competition, lower prices, high proﬁts, and trade supremacy, in-
ventive genius is ever at work to increase the speed and output of
machinery, and employees have to keep pace with the machine. This
speeding up is manifest in all the mechanical industries. . . .

“The danger lies in the pace becoming so rapid that there is little
opportunity, such as usually exists with the rythmically beating heart,
for recuperation between successive discharges of energy. At the end
of the day’s work, therefore, the physiological mechanism involved is
too often near exhaustion and even the rest of the body may suffer
likewise.” 36

When an employee is required to remain continuously at a
deﬁnite station or machine, trade unions now demand that he
shall be given a relief of suﬂicient time to take care of his needs.
A relief worker should take his place on the belt or machine for
15 minutes; or the machines should be stopped for a rest pause
during the morning and another during the afternoon.

In fatigue, waste products accumulate in the blood, under-
mine vitality and predispose the worker to illness. Unless the
employee gets adequate rest, this fatigue increases from hour
to hour, from day to day, and month to month.

Every industry has its special occupational hazards. Physicians
have pointed out that overwork and long working hours, lack of
sunshine or fresh air naturally increase the worker’s suscep-
tibility to industrial diseases. In particularly dangerous trades,
workers who are overfatigued and exhausted are more readily
attacked by the disease of the trade. Tuberculosis often results
directly from overwork, long hours in bad air, and too long
sitting in a constrained position. « ‘

53

 

 

Too little time for lunch during the workday gives the worke_r
no chance properly to wash his hands before eating. When the
time allowed for a meal is only 30 minutes, workers usually do
not try to leave the plant, but eat their sandwiches by the
machines. Industrial poisons may be carried on the worker’s
hands to the mouth and enter the system. Length of noon hour
and rest pauses and length of the working day thus directly

‘affect the control of occupational diseases.

Night work if continued for too long a time is bad for the
employee’s health. Working time from 12 midnight to 8 A.M.
or from 1 1 P.M. to 7 A.M., known as the “graveyard” shift, means
that the worker cannot sleep during normal sleeping hours.
Human beings always ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to sleep during the
daytime when others are awake. Under this system rest time is
cut short. Months of night work without a change of shifts may
mean less resistance to disease.

Trade unions are therefore justiﬁed in seeking higher pay
for night work, especially on the third shift. A number of com-
panies have recently agreed to pay a bonus or premium for
night work. One company reported that it was paying a 10 per
cent bonus over the base rate to men on the second shift (4 P.M
to 12 M.) and 15 per cent to men on the “graveyard” shift.
Another company reported that even though it used a rotating
shift schedule, it paid a 5 cent an hour bonus to all employees
working between the hours of 7 P.M. and 7 A.M. Still another
company said it paid all men working on rotating shifts an
additional 10 per cent bonus over the base rate of pay for the
job. “In this instance, the employer felt that the ten per cent
bonus tends to compensate the men for the necessity of changing
living habits every four weeks (which is the rotating
schedule).” 37 ‘

Fatigue from speed-up and long hours, physicians agree, plays
a considerable part in causing industrial accidents. When over-
tired the worker cannot pay as close attention to the machine

54

 

nor react as quickly to a warning of danger. After a certain
number of working hours the number of accidents tends to rise.
During the next-to-the-last hour of work, when muscular control
and attention are at their lowest, accidents are most frequent.
“During the last hour the accident rate may fall, owing to
decreased rate of output and anticipation of rest.” 33

Occupational accidents take an enormous toll of life and
working ability, as shown in ﬁgures of the U. S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Such accidents killed over 18,000 workers in
United States industries in 1940, and injured 1,800,000. The
deaths alone averaged about 60 each working day. The em-
ployee-days lost in actual absence from work are estimated at
41,912,000, enough to have provided 140,000 workers with full-
time employment during the entire year. Yet this estimate does
not include the economic time loss caused by deaths and perma-
nent disabilities.” Four times as many man-days are lost by
accidents in industry as by strikes. A majority of these industrial
accidents could be prevented, experts agree. In such prevention
the control over speed-up and shortening of work hours are im-
portant factors.

To the employers’ pressure for changes in the Fair Labor
Standards Act to permit longer hours, labor answers that the
employee must preserve his capacity to work for years to come.
He must be able to work tomorrow with the normal measure
of health, energy and freshness that he possesses today. Too long
a working day may use up more of his strength than he can re-
place in three days. By prolonging the worker’s hours of pro-
duction during the best part of his life the company will thus
shorten his life as a whole. Longer working hours may cause the
premature exhaustion and death of the worker.

PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES

In attacking 40-hour week laws in the United States, the
National Industrial Conference Board, employers’ research

55

 

 

agency, has gone so far as to claim: “If this restriction on work?

ing hours [i.e., in the wage-hour and the Walsh-Healey acts]
were relaxed for the duration of the emergency to allow a 50-
hour week, the productive effectiveness of the existing supply

‘ of skilled labor would immediately be increased by 25 per cent;

a 54-hour week would mean an increase in effectiveness of 35
per cent; a 60-hour week, an increase of 50 per cent.” 4°

If this were true then it might be expected that working 120
hours instead of 40 each week would increase productive effec-
tiveness by 2oo per cent. But this whole argument that “the
more you work, the more you produce" has been proved a
fallacy. During the World War (1914-18) the British govern-
ment learned from a series of experiments in war industries that
by reducing the working hours from 66 to 471/2 hours a week,
production was not lowered but increased about 1.3 per cent.

British experience in World War I and World War II may
be summarized in the following points:

1. Except for short periods, an extension of the usual hours
of work does not give a proportional increase in output.

2. The high production level which follows with the intro-
duction of overtime soon subsides and is followed by a produc-
tion level which the worker feels he can maintain over a longer
number of hours without overfatigue. Total output level may
be“ no higher, in fact may be lower, than during the shorter
workweek.

3. Not only does production drop during extended overtime,
but after the overtime has been discontinued, it takes some time
to regain the higher hourly -production levels. The hourly out-
put mounts slowly,,and it may take months before a steady
equilibrium is attained. The adaptation time usually is shorter
with simpler operations.

4. Excessive increases in working hours lead to increased
lost time during work, absenteeism and sickness, as well as to a
decreased rate of production per hour of actual work. When

hours were lengthened from 47 to 60 a week in the ﬁrst part of
1940, the illness rate increased by 10 per cent.

5. The reduction in hourly output, as working hours are
extended, is most pronounced on processes requiring heavy
manual labor and on processes where the worker has a consid-
erable degree of control over his speed of operation.

6. Rest periods help to maintatin production at high levels,
particularly if the worker can take food during these periods.
Workers must rest, even while at work, and organized rest
periods are better than rest periods which workers take of their
own accord.“

American experience bears out these conclusions. An experi-
ment in a textile mill in Philadelphia, for example, showed
that rest periods increased the workers’ output. During one
month “when the workers were made to stop work for 40
minutes a day, in four periods, and lie down and rest, produc-
tion was 1o per cent greater during the month.” 42 The Kellogg
Co. at Battle Creek, Michigan, introduced the six-hour day,
four-shift schedule, in December, 1930. Finding it so efficient
that the plan has been continued, the company has reported it
means less waste of time and less tendency to succumb to
monotony.

In manufacturing, mining, and steam railroad industries,
average weekly hours of work were reduced from 56.2 in 1923-25
to 35.7 in 1938——a drop of 21 per cent. During these 15 years,
productivity or output per man-hour in these industries steadily
increased; there was no break in the trend at any time. In testi-
mony before the Temporary National Economic Committee, its
economic adviser Theodore  Kreps quoted recent studies to
show this rise in productivity as reﬂecting technological
changes:

“By 1938 ‘the productivity of labor had increased over 192 3-25 levels
by 44 percent in manufacture, 44 percent in railroads, 99 percent in
mineral industries, 1 16 percent in electric light and power, 40 percent

57

   

 

  

in automobile and parts manufacturing, 51 percent in blast furnaces,
steel works, and rolling mills, 55 percent in paper and pulp manu-
facture, 38 percent in cotton textile manufactures, and 153 percent in
the manufacture of tobacco products. . . The increase has ranged as
high as 241 percent for rayon, in 8 industries they were in excess of
50 percent, and in 22 others range from 25 percent to 50 percent. Such
is the magnitude of the technological advance in the midst of which
we now ﬁnd ourselves.”43

Such increases in output per man-hour clearly indicate that
total output can rise while working hours are reduced. In testi-
mony before the temporary National Economic Committee,
union representatives cited many examples of such increased
production on the basis of shorter hours. President Emil Rieve
of the Textile Workers Union of America (CIO) reported:

“A study of 5 major branches of the textile industry indicates that
the total number of man-hours of work contracted by 20.4 percent
between 1919 and 1939, despite the increase in the total volume of
production of a minimum of 25 percent. . . .

"In the cotton-textile industry, production increased 18 percent.

between 1919 and 1939, but man-hours of work declined 28 percent.
The overall increase in production of 21 percent in the woolen and
worsted industry between 1919 and 1939 was offset by a sharp decline
in man-hours of work of ~ 32 percent. The probable doubling of pro-
duction in the silk and rayon industry was accompanied by a reduc-
tion in man-hours of 38 percent.” 44

Similarly, James B. Carey, then general president of United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, reported for the elec-
trical industry that hours worked per week in 1939 were about
25 per cent under 1929. Productivity per man-hou'r in the
heavy goods section of the industry had increased by 32 per
cent in those ten years and was 29 per cent above so recent a
year as 1937. In radio, productivity was more than 100 per cent
higher than in 1929. He estimated that the electrical industry in
1940 could produce the same amount of electrical machinery

‘ as was produced in 1929, with about 24 per cent fewer workers.

58

 

l

Arguing that in the electrical industry a 35-hour week should
be the workweek, he said:

“Our own studies show that if as many employees were working in
our industry as in 1929, but were working on a 35-hour week, then
total production would be approximately the same as in 1929.” 45

Increased productivity in practically every industry means
that fewer workers can produce the same amount of goods-
or more. While productivity rises, employment falls. In their
testimony before the Temporary National Economic Committee
all union representatives pointed to the unemployment caused
by recent technological changes in industry. Philip Murray,
chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (later
president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations), re-
ported that in the steel industry widespread introduction of
strip mills would eventually displace about 85,000 steel workers,
of whom over 38,000 had already lost their jobs.“ In coal min-
ing over 78,000 men were eliminated by technological changes
in the industry during the 15 years from 1923 to 1938.

Industrial production as a whole rose nearly 60 per cent be-
tween January, 1939, and July, 1941, largely because of expan-
sion in the defense industries. But some 5,700,000 workers were
still jobless in July,‘ 1941. It is clear that more men and women
could have jobs and production could be further expanded
without lengthening the basic workweek of those now employed.

In a planned society, efﬁciently organized to promote human
welfare, industry could probably provide for all the needs
of the population on the basis of a 16-hour workweek of four
hours a day, four days a week. Professor Rexford Guy Tugwell,
formerly of Columbia University and later economist in the
U. S. Department of Agriculture, has urged “that machinery
be made to work for us longer and faster than it characteris-
tically does. If this involves cutting down the hours of men

' involved to six or to four, and the operation of four or six

shifts in the day, the increased product would enable us to
59 4

   

 

 

maintain as high or higher wages. ...It would seem worth’
trying.” 47 ‘

Walter N. Polakov, now director, of the United Mine
Workers’ engineering department,. has said that “ﬁfty weeks,
four days, six hours is en0ugh”—a 24-hour week and two weeks’
vacation. Harold Rugg in The Great Technology estimated a
possible minimum living standard between ten and twenty-fold
greater than the minimums of 1929, on a 16 to 20-hour work-
week.“ '

PROFITS FROM OVERTIML

Employers organized in the National Association of Manufac-
turers, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and
other groups have constantly opposed payment of overtime work
rates, as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act and the

~ Public Contracts Act, for hours beyond the 40-hour a week

limit. They have argued that extra overtime payments resulted
in higher costs. On defense contracts this was one of the argu-
ments used in demanding higher prices from the government.

Labor, on the other hand, has pointed out that greater volume
of output, savings on overhead costs, and more efficient use of
plant and equipment have more than compensated for what
employers pay to workers in overtime rates. The demand for
price increases, labor argues, is inspired by employers’ greed
for higher proﬁts.

A government study bears out labor’s argument and con-
clusively refutes the employers’ claim. The U; S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics recently examined 260 corporations in 26 war
industries to discover the effect of a 20 per cent increase in
working hours above those actually worked in 1939. It was
‘found that this rise in working hours, assuming payment of
overtime rates for the extra hours, would increase the combined
earnings of the 260 companies by $75,284,000 or by 2.6_ per cent.

This was a very conservative estimate, the Bureau said, since

it allowed for an output increase of only 16 per cent with a 20
per cent increase in working hours, because of lowered produc-
tivity of labor’during the added hours. In actual experience,
the study pointed out, the employers’ proﬁts, despite payment
of overtime, would be increased substantially more than these
estimates indicate. The Bureau concluded:

“That, in general, the increase in income from sales without an in-
crease in prices is more than adequate to absorb overtime charges and
all other costs incurred as a result of the expansion. . . . With the ex-
ceptions noted, the yield on business investment would be sustained
or improved without increased prices after the full absorption of over-
time wage payments.” 49

WORKING HOURS IN WARTIME

In December, 1941, the United States was drawn into the
world war against the fascist Axis powers. Immediately, the
battle for production in war industries became part of the most
important frontline defense.

Trade union leaders recognized at once that defeat of fas-
cism was necessary for labor’s own defense. The triumph of
nazism or fascism would mean the end of trade unions in this
country as it did in Germany and Italy. To help win victory
in the United Nations’ strugg1e.against the Axis was labor’s
ﬁrst and main responsibility.

Ready to co-operate in every way with the government’s war
program, trade unions took the initiative in plans for greater
output_of guns, tanks, battleships, airplanes and other war
supplies. CIO President Murray’s plan, calling for joint action

by labor and management, headed labor’s proposals for in-

creased production. These plans outlined maximum efforts in
all defense industries, with full employment of machinery and
of manpower.

With some ﬁve million workers still jobless in the United
States at the beginning of 1942, it was clear that thousands

61

 

 

could be trained and re-employed in defense plants. Many
employers in war industries chose to abandon overtime and
take on new employees.

Continuous operation for 168 hours a week called for three
to four shifts. A number of states suspended state hour laws
covering women employees to permit women in war indus-
tries to work on the nightshift and to allow overtime where
necessary. But the individual worker’s basic 40-hour week, with
time—and-a-half for overtime, was still maintained. Scientiﬁc
studies of efﬁciency in this country and Great Britain were
widely quoted to show that the worker's maximum produc-
tivity can be attained and held only on a workweek of less than
55 hours. V

Reorganization of shifts and hour schedules became a prac-
tical problem for all unions in war industries. To protect their
members against excessive overtime and against too long con-
tinued night work, trade unions have insisted that hour sched-
ules be decided upon in closest co-operation with the unions
in each. industry. Trade union representatives know what work-
ers want and need. Production methods must be efficient, but
the health of the people involved must be protected.

The year 1941 rounded out a century and a half of struggle
for progressive shortening of the workday and workweek. Or-
ganized labor, eleven million-strong in 1942, was doing its ut-
most in the battle for production. At the same time it was
determined to maintain its hard-won gains, proved necessary
for health and efficiency, and to extend these beneﬁts to mil-
lions not yet organized.

THE HISTORY OF THE
SHORTER WORKDAY

LABOR’S HARD-WON GAINS

A century and a half ago, in 1791, journeymen carpenters in
Philadelphia went on strike for a shorter day’s work, with addi-
tional pay for overtime. Pointing out that they had “heretofore
been obliged to toil through the whole course of the longest
summer’s day,” they" pledged themselves to carry out a new
resolution: “That, in future, a Day's Work, amongst us, shall
be deemed to commence at six o’clock in the morning, and ter-
minate, at six in the evening of each day.” 1 That was the first
recorded strike in this country for shorter working hours.

The 12- to 15-hour day of the 18th century has been pro-
gressively shortened by labor’s efforts until by 1941 the eight-
hour day, 40-hour week was at least recognized as a standard,
while some union agreements called for a seven-hour day. To
show this gradual cutting down of work hours we may quote

ﬁgures for manufacturing industries during the past hundred ‘

years, by decades. For the 19th century these ﬁgures understate
the average for all industry, since they are drawn largely from
establishments where reduced hours made an earlier appear-
ance than in the mass of American workshops.

By 1930 weekly hours in manufacturing averaged 43.5, re-
ﬂecting an eight-hour day, 51/2 days a week. The following
years of depression and economic crisis saw the factory week
cut down far below “normal” levels, because of unemployment
and part-time work. But by the end of 1941, when war condi-
tions had stepped up production, the hours worked in manufac-
turing again averaged over 40 a week.

Labor’s long ﬁght to reduce hours has been only part of the
larger struggle in this country and in other countries to improve
all working conditions and to establish at least some control
over jobs in factories, mills, mines and on the railroads. Work-
ers of democratic America have proclaimed their right to act as
free citizens, to take part in political and social life, to enjoy
hours of recreation, to play with their children, to guard their
own and their families’ health and safety, and to secure them-
selves and their families against unemployment, illness and
poverty in old age.

Few indeed in this country have as yet gained such freedom
and security..But organized labor is now over 1 1,000,000 strong
—more than twice its size at the end of the ﬁrst World War.
In recent years it has won signed union agreements providing

.for shorter hours and other gains hardly imaginable a hundred

years ago. These latest victories are the fruit of those earlier

struggles when groups of unorganized workers dared to strike
for a 10-hour day, then for an eight-hour day.

ON Two; FRONTS

Fighting through all these years on two fronts, directly for
better terms on the job and also for state and federal legislation,
labor has sought to limit hours of work, ﬁrst for children and
women, then for all workers. At every stage of the struggle it
has met continued organized opposition from employer groups.

Owners of industry have given many different reasons for
bitterly resisting shorter hours. Some have been frank enough
to admit their fear that higher labor costs for shorter working
hours might cut into proﬁts. Usually concealing the proﬁt
motive in their century-long resistance to a shorter day, em-
ployers in earlier years tried to justify the long day on moral
grounds, arguing that “Satan ﬁnds mischief for idle hands to
do.” To keep out of mischief, they said, employees must put in
a 12-hour stretch after which they would be too exhausted to do
anything else. i i

The company ofﬁcial leaning back in his comfortable desk
chair has urged longer hours in his factory with the time-worn
argument: “I work 10 hours a day and like it. VVhy shouldn’t
labor put in a longer day? One or two hours more—what’s the
difference anyway?”

He ignores the fact that he is usually free to go and come at
hours of his own choosing; to take two hours for luncheon at
the club; to see his physician or his dentist; do an errand; have
an afternoon off for golf—-all within working hours.

Nothing in this big boss’ “working day” can be compared
with the monotonous, repetitive machine job of the worker
whose speed is regulated by the conveyor belt; who cannot go
to the toilet or for a drink of water except at a stated moment;
who punches a time-clock at the beginning and end of his day’s
labor. The worker’s lunch period is set for him at half an hour,
