The War on Poverty

“UN CONDITIONAL WAR”

N HIS State of the Union message, President Lyn-
don B. Johnson said: “And this Administration,
here and now, declares unconditonal war on poverty
in America, and I urge this Congress and all Ameri-
cans to join with me in that effort.”

We are prepare-d to join Wholly and Without reser-
vation in such a war.

But if it is to be truly “unconditional war,” we
need to go far beyond the very limited program
which President Johnson proposes. Such a War can-
not be half-hearted or limited to “band-aid” reme-
dies. It must be determined and unrelenting, and
must go to the heart of the problem. It must be a
total war.

Its goal must be nothing less than guaranteeing
to every American able and willing to work, peace-
time employment at a decent Wage or salary; and
to all unable to Work, adequate provision against
want.

E REJECT the view that technological advance

—the ability to produce in ever greater abun-
dance—must lead to unemployment and poverty. We
repudiate any idea that automation is making
workers socially unnecessary. So long as there is
human need, there is need for human labor. In our
land, while one-fifth or more of the people live in

dire poverty, there is a mounting lack of low-rent
housing, of schools a11dﬁ‘6's"p‘i”tals, of facilities for
medical training and research, of civic centers and
recreational facilities. To put America to Work to
meet these needs alone could provide jobs for all for
years to come.

We reject, too, the slanderous view that people
are poor because they are shiftless, unintelligent or
abnormal, or because they are victims of personal
misfortune, to be regarded as nothing more than
objects of charity. No-r is it correct to look upon
the poor as some sort of “subclass,-” as a group set
apart from the main body of the American people.
And no less Wrong are those Who attribute poverty
merely to lack of education.

If coal miners are poor, the basic cause is the
greed of the big coal operators. If Negroes are poor,
it is in the ﬁrst place because they are victims of the
shameful Jim Crow system in our country. If old
people are poor, it is because of the inadequacy of
our social security setup. And so it is for others as
Well. The poor are part and parcel of the American
Working people, and poverty is an affliction from
which no Worker is immune. All are its potential
victims.

The basic cause of unemployment and poverty,
therefore, is not automation, nor is it personal short-
comings o-r misfortunes. On the contrary, the cause
is an economic system in which production is for
maximum private proﬁt instead of for maximum
public good. It is an economic system in which prices
are jacked up while Wages are held down, in which
tens of billions of dollars a year are wasted on arma-
ments and other unproductive expenditures While

 

the people are deprived of vital social needs, in which
human needs go unfulﬁlled while millions go hungry
and jobless, in which abundance itself leads to pov-
erty and privation.

In short, the cause of poverty today is monopoly-
dominated capitalism, and the war against poverty
is a war against monopoly greed.

THIS IS YOUR WAR

THE WAR against poverty is a war of all the

people—of all victims, actual and potential, of
monopoly oppression. In the ranks of its army are
not -only the poor and the unemployed themselves
but ﬁrst a.nd f-oremost all of organized labor. In the
forefront today are the Negro people, whose all-
out struggle to end their.,.Iim Crow status is vital
to the interest of all Americans. Side by side with
them stand the Puerto Rican and Mexican-American
people, the youth and the senior citizens, small
farmers and small business.

All these must join hands, all must lend their
voices and organized strength to the struggle if
real gains are to be wo-n. For winning this war will
not be easy. The p-eople’s army will meet with the
most ferocious «opposition from corporate wealth and
its political stooges, who will do everything possible
to preserve the enormous proﬁts and power of big
business. Already the Goldwaters, the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers, the Dixiecrats, and others
of their ilk are raising the battle-cry of reaction.
Already the big busine-ss publication Barron’s Weekly
has headlined: “The Wrong War: In 1964 Com-
munism, Not Poverty, Is the Enemy.”

  

IIIO
U...‘
' II.l'

  

The war on poverty is closely interlinked with all
the struggles and aspirations of the American peo-

 

ple. All are parts of one war—-a war against cor-
porate greed-—and none can win their o-wn struggles
except in alliance with the others.

The ﬁght against poverty is inseparable from the
ﬁght for peace and disarmament, for the billions
now squandered on arms are obtained at the expense
of the public welfare and social needs of the people.
The war chest for the war on poverty must be
swelled by sharply reducing that of the cold war.
What is called for is a cut of no less than $20 billion
in military spending within the next two years, and
the allocation of that $20 billion to combat poverty.

A central battlefront of this war is the ﬁght for
civil rights, which has become the focus of all strug-
gles for democracy and economic welfare in our
country today.

If, as President Johnson declares, one-ﬁfth of
America is poor, among the Negro people poverty
afflicts nearly one-half. To ﬁght poverty, therefore,
is in the first place to fight poverty among the Negro
people—to ﬁght t-o end segregation and discrimina-
tion-. To wipe out poverty is to wipe out the shame-
ful slum ghettoes which are its breeding place.

The Negro people are heroically waging this battle
today. Indeed, it is their militant struggles which
have served more than anything else to dramatize
the fact of poverty and to bring it forward as the
central issue of the day.

The ﬁght of the Negro people for Freedom Now
is thus in the direct interest of all who would ﬁght
poverty. The myth of white superiority which to-day
prevents the masses of white working people from
recognizing this tie must be fought. The crusade
against the evil of poverty must be dovetailed with
the crusade against the evil of Jim Crow. Without
this it cannot succeed.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO -WIPE OUT POVERTY?

 WAR against poverty will be long and far-

reaching. The needs o-f the American people go
far beyond the measures proposed by the Johnson
Administration. And if the need is so great now in
a period of economic upswing, how much greater
will it be when the inevitable downturn thrusts
millions more into joblessne-ss and want.

What is required ﬁrst of all is an immediate pro-
gram involving large-scale federal economic action,
with government spending on a level sufﬁcient to

 

 

 

 

raise substantially the purchasing power of all low-
income groups.

But the war does not end there. A longer-range
ﬁght must be waged for changes of a more basic
character, changes which will invade the sacred
territory of big business, curb its powers and sub-
ject its operations to a growing measure of demo-
cratic control for the benefit of the people.

Final victory requires even more. The abolition
of poverty can be achieved only by abolishing capi-
talism itself——by putting an end to an economic sys-
tem of exploitation and oppression which generates
fantastic wealth at one end and poverty at the other.

Mankind do-es not exist for the sake of proﬁt. Men
work and produce not to enrich a few but in order
that all may live better. To wipe out poverty means
to wipe out the proﬁt system, which stands in the
way of this aspiration. It means that the factories,
mines and mills of our country must be owned by
the people themselves and op-erated for their beneﬁt
—for use, not for proﬁt. In such an America-—a
socialist Am«erica—abund'ance will cease to be a
“problem.” No one will be unemployed and no one

"/1 WU  /Ier

 

will be poor. Our tremendous productive capacity

will provide for the well-being and security of all.

Toward this noble goal of ending poverty, of se-
curing the right of every person to the prosperous
and happy life which the ability to produce abun-
dance makes possible, we here offer our proposals
for the great battles ahead.

A Program for Today

HE CALL for “unconditional war” has already
been taken up by leading organizations and
spokesm-en o-f labor, the farmers, the Negro people.
These have come forward with bold programs of
action——programs which merit the m-ost vigorous
support of every American who seeks the elimina-
tion of this monstrous social evil.

We fully en-dorse all such programs. We p-articu-
larly applaud the call of the re-cent UAW convention
to “mobilize America for a total war against pov-
erty” and for a program of “bold -and affirmative
action at every level of our governmental structure.”
We greet the convention’s placing as a top
priority in the struggle the passage of civil rights
legislation “as an essential step in the crusade
against segregation, discrimination, and the denial
of basic rights of citizenship to the Negroes and
other minorities with resulting poverty and in-
justice.” We likewise greet the call at the recent
convention of the Farmers’ Union for a 20% cut in
arms spending to ﬁnance the war on poverty.

Incorporating all the positive po-ints of these pro-
grams and approaches, we oﬁer the following pro-
gram for the ﬁght to curb the growth of poverty and
unemployment in our country.

1. PROVIDE JOBS FOR ALL ABLE AND
WILLING TO WORK.

LAUNCH A crash public works program at union
wages, starting with a minimum outlay of $10
billion the first year and rising to $20 billion a year
thereafter, the funds to come from a progressive

depressed areas, and on providing suitable employ-

 

ment in areas affected by reconversion to peace-

_ time production.

Reduce the standard Work Week to 30 hours with

_no out in earnings.

quate hospitalization and medical care for the
elderly.

not less than two-thirds of former earnings, includ-
ing all Wage workers Without exception, and con-
tinuing for the duration of the period of unem-
ployment.

possessions in the case of unemployed Workers.

P 4. INCREASE THE PURCHASING POWER AND

LIVING STANDARDS OF THE WORKING
PEOPLE

AISE THE minimum Wage to $2.00 an hour and
extend coverage to all Wage workers.

Enact basic tax reforms which Will plug -all loop-
holes and shift the tax burden from the Working

 

 

 

people to the giant corporations and wealthy in-
dividuals. Raise personal exemptions to $1,200 and
abolish the Withholding tax. Eliminate excise and
sales taxes on necessities, which bear most heavily
on the lowest income groups.

Establish a federal price control commission em-
powered to establish the strictest safeguards against
all monopoly price-gouging.

Initiate a system of rent controls, with stiff
penalties for failure in upkeep and with rent sub-
sidies where needed to enable low-income families to
secure d-ecent ho-using.

Raise social security pensions to a minimum of
$200 a month for a single individual with $100
additional for spouse.

Permit retirement at 60 years of age with full
beneﬁts.

ganizations in its administration.

As part of such a measure, enact the Administra-
tion’s job corps, Work-training and Work-study pro-

form of direct payments to farmers of the difference
between market prices and 100% of parity.

lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and corre-
sponding authorities in other major depressed re-
gions, to harness their natural resources through
large-scale projects for conservation and production
of cheap electric power and for other federal con-
struction and industrial projects that will spur eco-
nomic renewal and expansion.

Launch public works projects for road building,
scenic restoration, creation of recreational areas and
similar purposes in the Appalachians and other re-
gions.

Amend the Areas Redevelo-pment Act to provide
for adequate re-training and relocation of unem-
ployed workers.

turn to the principles embodied in the Wagner Labor
Relations Act, to secure the ability of labor to safe-
guard and raise the living standards of workers in
all states and regions.

Enact new legislation to abolish regional wage
differentials, end the runaway shop evil, and guaran-
tee equal pay for equal work regardless of age, sex,
race or religion.

Curb the Power of Big Business

HE ABOVE program is necessary to combat

poverty and joblessness. But it is not enough.
The growing impact of automation, which wipes
out an estimated 40,000 jobs each week, combined
with economic stagnation and other factors such
as discrimination and segregation, points up the
need for economic and social measures of a more
advanced character if the rise of poverty and un-
employment is to be more than slowed down.

These are measures designed to place more effec-
tive curbs on the power of the trusts in American
life. They involve the establishment of a growing
degree of government regulation——and where neces-
sary of government o~wnership—o-f the big industrial
enterprises, with democratic controls effected by
assuring a substantial voice to the working people
through their organizations in all controlling bodies.
They involve the utilization of the power and re-
sources of the federal government for the welfare
of the common people, and not in order to fatten
the proﬁts of the big monopolies. The ﬁght for such
basic reforms requires a more advanced level of
political activity on the part of labor and the com-
mon people, aiming at a basic political re-grouping
powerful enough to impose limitations on big
business.

We believe that such reforms, which will lay the
basis for moving toward an ultimate reorganization
of our society along socialist lines, must go in the
following direction: A

1. Growing invasion of “management preroga-
tives” with the establishment of controls over hiring
policy, work standards, scheduling of operations,

 

 

 

moving of plants to new locations, institution of
automation and other new techniques, price setting,
etc.

2. A drastic revisi-on of the tax structure, with
a) a steeply graduated corporate tax aimed at tax-
ing the biggest corporations most heavily (instead
of the present uniform 48% tax for all corporations
making $25,000 a year or more), and b) closing of
all loopholes and taxing of all personal income above
a certain level at a rate of 100%. These measures
Would go in the direction of placing a ceiling on

‘corporate and personal income.

3. Designation of any corporation with gross
assets of $250 million or more, or accounting for
more than 10% of the market of any industry, as
a ﬁrm affecting the public interest and thereby sub-
ject to special regulation and supervision with regard
to its operations, price structure, etc. Also, federal
chartering and regulation of all corporations with
$50 million or more in gross assets.

4. Nationalization of industries directly related to
public service, such as transportation, public utili-
ties, atomic energy and power production, and their
operation under democratic control on a non-proﬁt
basis. Nationalization of other industries such as
coal mining or oil production or of plants closing
down, where necessary to protect natural resources
and to guarantee jobs and living standards. Con-
version of arms plants to civilian production under
government ownership. Nationalization of all natural
resources.

5. Halting of the immense handouts given to pri-
vate industry through government subsidies and
through government ﬁnancing of industrial research,
and utilization of these funds for research and other
purposes of direct public beneﬁt. An end to give-
aways of natural resources and a federal program of
conservation with strict penalties against corporate
interests which waste or destroy these resources.

6. Special measures to protect small business
against encroachments of the monopolies, including
lower taxes and control of monopoly prices. Estab-
lishment of a federal Department of Small Business

lmaking funds available for loans and credits and

giving other assistance. Aid to small businesses up-
rooted by urban redevelopment programs in relo-
cating elsewhere.

7. A vast expansion of social welfare and social
security expenditures, with establishment of a
federally-ﬁnanced and administered comprehensive

cradle-to-grave security program, embracing unem-
ployment, industrial and disability compensation, full
medical and dental care, old age pensions and other
beneﬁts.

The Key to Victory:
United Action

The ﬁght against poverty and unemployment is a
ﬁght against the giant monopolies. It is a ﬁght of all
sections of the American people ground d-own by
these monopo1ies—the working class, the Negro
people, the small farmers, small business. All have
a common stake in this war.

The key to success lies, therefore, in uniting all
these forces in common battle against the trusts.
And for this, the primary responsibility lies with
organized labor, which must mobilize all workers in
the struggle, organized and unorganized, employed
and unemployed, Negro and white, young and old.
The combined action of labor with other sections of

 

the people is equally vital, above all its unity with tion can be laid for the building of a political coali-

the Negro people. tion against the trusts headed by organized labor

and powerful enough to wrest basic concessions from

Without such united action, not even the most them-—a coalition which can go far toward the
meager program can be won. With it, the founda- elimination of poverty in our country.

ACT NOW!

Today, emergency action is imperative on certain urgent questions. Among these are:
EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE AID TO ALL WHO SUFFER POVERTY AND
PRIVATION.

A CRASH PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM, WITH SPECIAL CONCENTRATION ON DEPRESSED AREAS
AND ON NEGRO AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS.

PASSAGE OF ALL CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION AND AN ALL-OUT DRIVE AGAINST DISCRIMI-
NATION IN EMPLOYMENT .

ENACTMENT OF A $2.00-AN-HOUR MINIMUM WAGE COVERING ALL WAGE WORKERS WITH-
OUT EXCEPTION.

AN IMMEDIATE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE JOBS AND EDUCATION FOR OUR YOUTH.

The time to act is now! Enlist in the war against poverty today! In your union, your church, your com-
munity or fraternal organization, take up the battle cry for an end to poverty and joble-ssness in our country.
