Before you shed any tears for the poor boss, or shell out a.
buck so his kids ‘can eat, let’s take a look at the figures on profits.
« The Mine-Mill Research-Department has issued reports on the
1953 profits and ’54 outlook of three of the “Big Four" in non-
ferrous metals -— Kennecott, Anaconda and AS&R. (Phelps Dodge

show that profits, dividends, executive salaries are all high.
Here are some of the" facts revealed by the Research
Department: ‘a .- - 3 V ' '
Kennecotf ‘ ' .
“Kennecott’s reported profits for 1953, before taxes, were the
highest in the history of the company. They total_led-- according to
the company’s annual report, $178,823,210. After paying all taxes

“On a per worker basis, the company made an average profit

of $6,380 for every worker in the U.S. and Chile. Had each of these
workers, last year, rec_eived an additional 25c an hour, the company
would have still had left 8. very handsome return of nearly $5,800

Anaconda.

“I953 profits for the U.S. were easily the second best in history ,’

“AS&R’s 1953' profits came to $34,556,000 beforetaxes

of.tlie stockholders’ original investment . . .__ it would come to 37c:

      Key witness ignorant on union 
  in NLRB case against M-M '

WASHINGTON, “D. C.-—-The National Labor Relations Board wound up its 9

“lunatic asylum” case against Mine-Mill on May 20 with its third and final wit-

ness, one Manning Johnson,‘ a notorious professional informer, being unable to tes-”

tify that he knew a single Mine-Mill officer or member in his ‘whole life.
Under cross-examination by Mine-Mill Counsel‘ Nat Witt, Johnson was forced

to admit that hewas “not an expert on the American ‘labor movement nor familiar,

with developmentsin organized labor,” and that he did not “know anything about

the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, except by reputation.” ' , , I
His only use to the government in this case was that he was once“a communist,
from 1930 to 1940, but when ‘questioned by Witt, Johnsonwas forced to imply that —

his definition _of “communist”
included the . CIO, the AFL,
Philip /Murray and ‘John L.‘
Lewis. The sum and substance
of his testimoney was that
everyone is a communist who
does not think like Joe Mc-
Carthy or FBI director J. Edgar:

_ Hoover, for whom, Johnson ad-

mitted, : he started to be ‘a paid
stoolpigeon b.ac‘ki‘n 1941.
NLRB has no case ,

The vicious anti-union testi-_
mony of this government wits
ness,’ completely exposed by
Witt as unfounded in fact and
bearing no relation to’ our
Union, was final proof that the
NLRB had no case -against
Mine-Mill, and that its use of
the three witnesses-—Mason,
Eckert and Johnson — proved
nothing except that the entire
illegal proceedings is ca desper-
ate effort of an Eisenhower
anti-labor agency to destroy a
fighting union. ‘
Not one M-M member ,

In its whole case, the NLRB
was unable toproduce a single
Mile-Millrank and file member
as a witness to back u-p its
phony and fantastic charges
against our Union, these
charges being that Secretary-
Tneasurer Travis allegedly ad-
mitted signing a false. Taft-
Hartley affidavitand that every
member of Mine-Mill knew it.

With the ‘NLRB resting its
case, the hearing officer re-

;lDENVER—The ~ signatures are. rolling in-—by, the thousands! -

.Reports from all over the ‘country show that the J OBS—NOT-BREADLINES

/

cessed the hearings until June 4 '
without ruling on Mine-Mill's

official demand that the hear-

ings be moved to various cities"
where Mine-Mill members could

hear, see and judge for them-

selves-‘the kind of circus the

union-busters were putting on.

» Hearing officer

expresses doubt

' So fantastic and pitiful was
the gover1iment’s case that the
NLRB hearing officer, Downing,
expressed doubt that board at-
torney Foley had made out a
casgmerely on his own evidence.
It was the hearing "officer him-
self who, "even before Mine-Mill
began its own defense, raised
the question on his own as to
whether the NLRB-attorney had
made a case and set the June
4th date for oral argument on
w h e t h e r the NLRB’s phony
c h a r g e s‘ V against Mine-Mill
should be dismissed. '

2 For hearing officer-Downing

to have suggested ,Witt’s presen-

tation. of oral’ argument prior to
the normal procedure of hearing
the Union’s defense is in itself
a big_ victory for Mine-Mill in
this case. The very fact that
Downing suggested the oral\
argument by Witt is a concrete
indication‘ that he judges the
N LRB’s evidence weak.
However, the phony charges
and the whole illegal proceed-
ings of the board against Mine-
Mill still stood as THE UNION

went to press before Wittfs »

scheduled "oral argument. The

9 NLRB’s -threat to Mine-Mill’s

bargaining rights and the living

standards of every member still .

represented "an effort \by the

ups in the labor board to destroy '

'1 Sharp struggle ahead 3 on

l‘,$Iei:ilailel.S)u/areine Courl ruzing ,.

THE recent U. S. Supreme
Court decision that public school
segregation is unconstitutional
represents a grea_t stride in the
struggle of the Negro people
and their allies for equality.

W ' There is much to be done, ‘how-

ever, before equality in educa-
_tion will become’ a reality, and
not merely a constitutional
— principle. _

In the first place, the Sn-
preme Court will not fashion
'its decree—that is, its order di-

' recting how soon segregation
.- must be ended—until sometime

 ‘next year. It is possible the’

L.~:;.!court may allow a rather drawn-
*'out period for integration.
However, whatever time the
court allowsis not the princi-
ple obstacle. Even after the
Supreme Court decree becomes

 New Social Security bill

final, the Negro people will
have to wages. long fight fin-
ally to win unsegregated schools
in the south.

In the first ,place, it may be
expected that southern school
districts will not eliminate._seg’-
regation uriti'l‘“"they themselves
are made defendants in a law
suit. Technically, the ‘Supreme
Court’s decree will be binding
only onthe particular boards
of education which were sued.‘

For example,» its decree will
immediately ‘affect only Prince
Edward county in Virginia "and
none of the other Virginia coun-
ties. Nor will it direct actign by
the school boards in such states
as Mississippi, Florida, Texas,
Georgia, Louisiana, etc.

If school boards in these
states won’t integrate the

/

schools, it will be necessary for
the Negro people to bring sep-
arate lawsuits against each of
the boards. This time, however,

~they should be able to win their
suits at the first-court level, and

' will not need to go all the way
to the Supreme- Court.

However, it will still take
money and ‘organization to
bring such cases. Furthermore,
in certain areas at least, there
may be such intimidation as to
. make it difficult to find a plain-
tiff to bring the action.

Even more serious will be

various teclmiques of evasion._

which may be practiced in the
southern states, and perhaps
even in some northern areas.
For example, some of the
southern governors are .threat-
ening to make their public

J them.

New Social Security benefits,
which are expected to - start
within a few months, point up
the need for drastic improve-
ment in most of the existing

' pension plans in thenon-ferrous

V imetals industry. The new and

higher security benefits will, in
many cases, practically wipe

-out employer contributions to

pensions unless improved pen-

-sions can be negotiated in the

near future.

* The standard type of pension
plan, such as those which are
now in effect at Anaconda’,‘Ken-
necptt and Phelps-Dodge, pro-

v vides for minimum. pensions of

y_'sA$100 a month inc1uding.Social

Security. This minimum is also
. usually the maximum. .
_The company’s contribution
to the pension is the difference
’ between the $100 and the So-
’ cial Security benefit. Up until
‘now the maximum Social Se-’
curity benefit has been $85.

After January 1, new claim-

~ rants will receive as high. as

$108.50 a month.

Within two months after
passage ‘of. the liill, present
claimants will receive increases
in benefits of as high as $13.50
a month. Thus the new benefits
will sharply reduce employer
contributions and, in very ‘many
c a s e s , completely eliminate

THE NEW BENEFITS were
virtually assured when the
House of Representatives, last
week, passed a bill extending

" "coverage and increasing bene-

.fits of the Social Security sys-

« j« tern. The bill now goes to the

Senate, where it has been given
-top priority. Leaders of both
parties expected passage with-
‘out much opposition.

' Labor leaders generally felt
that the bill fell short of what
could and should be. done, but
was,’ in any event," a step for-

- ward toward a better social se-
curity system.

They a particularly deplored
the cutting out of a'provision
for payment of pensions to dis-

» abled workers before retire
— ment. 1 i

Here are the other key, pro-.
visions of the bill:

BENEFITS: Two months .af-
ter passage of the bill monthly
retirement checks for the 6.3

‘million persons now receiving

31.. benefits would be increased by

at least 5%. Average increases
would be about $4 a month, but
would range ‘from $5 a, month
a to $13.50._Benefits’ for present
“pensioners would range from
$30 to $98.50 a/month.'Depe_nd-
ents, widows, etc. will get cor-

_ responding increases.

Workers retiring in the future

   

will get higher benefits as they
receive higher credits for the
remainder of their working days,
under the new bill. These will
—range from $30 to $108.50.
Maximum benefits for fami-
lies will be raised from the
present $168.75 to $200. Periods

of extended disability will be
excluded from figuring the

worker’s average income and
the lowest five years of income
may be excluded.

’ TAXES: The present tax rate »

of 2% on employers and em-

ployees will be continued but’

the taxes will be levied and
credits computed on the first
$4,200 a year earned instead of

the first $3,600, thus raising
both taxes and benefits. This
will mean "an increase of $12,
per ‘year
taxes.‘ .

‘EARNINGS AFTER ‘RE-

TIREMENT: Under present law.

retired employees over 65 and
under 75 lose a month’s pension
if they earn $76 in that month.

Under the bill retired "em-I

/ployees can earn $1,000 a year,
regardless of the amount in any
one month‘, without losing bene-
\fits. For each $80 above $1,000
earned in a year a pensioner
would \ lose one month's pen-
sion. There would be no limit
on earnihgs of those over

B World!

THE only important W o rk
engineavailable up until recent-‘
ly was the human body.‘

"Long hours of toil was the
usual thing, and it characterized

that side of human history that

has been casually mentioned or
completely omitted, from our
history books:

Mankind always lived on the
‘ragged edge of survival. If a
few lived in‘ great plenty, it
meant" that many’,othersl had to
suffer dire want to compensate
for it. The workersrwerev so
surrounded by toil that they
never knew how to live. They
had to drudge long hours to
produce enough so they could
exist in order to produce more.
Life was a dreary round of
monotony as they_forgot their
children and lost the very
knowledge ‘of how to play.

We have arrived at a point
wherein, no matter what we ‘do,
human labor is fading from the
picture and is getting to the

stage of where it accounts for A

only 2 per cent of the energy
used to produce goods and ‘serv-
ices. A condition has arisen in
which the need for human toil

' as a means of making‘ a living

is fact becoming out—dated.
" WHAT’ is the solution?

The legislating [of shorter
work days and shorter work
weeks along with the lowering
of the age limit forvadequate
pensions on which veteran work-
ers can retire and live with
someisemblance of dignity, are
steps in the right direction.

But, there are those who are
chronically allergic to the yearn-
ings of the common people for
a better life, those who view

‘with hostility every move for-

ward by the common folks,
those who, grudge’ sharing the

(good things of life with the peo-

ple on the lower levels, ’ those
-.fwho__think,thatﬂworkersygill only a I

  

be kept» in their places by in-
security and poverty.\_
They are the ones whomﬂwe

AND,  CASE there are
those whcfmay lay awake nights
worrying about what calamities

may befall humanity if left ex- ‘

posed to the insidious dangers
of all this mass leisure, let us
here and now put their fever-
racked minds at ease.

This earthis so full of- good
clean things to do and learn
about, and so many useful hob-
bies to pursue and so much to
‘do for our fellow-man that there
will be no time left fof mis-
chief.

All these things plus a secure

income for all should assuage‘

the fears of our sleepless
friends.  '

VANCOUVER, 3.0. — Nego-
tiations this week in the Van-
' icouver area have seen termina-

tion in five local foundries with A
' signing of an agreement with‘

. R ,. Metal and Chemical Workers
Union, Local 289.
The contract brings a six cent
 increase in base rates, making
' moulders’ rater $1.95 hourly.

A preliminary meeting has
been held between the Port
Haney Brick Co. sub-local of
‘Local 289, and the brick com-
pany, the union proposals being

..n for a 12 percent wage increase,

two additional‘ satutory holi-

‘days, and certain revisions to

j the seniority clause in \the ex-
isting agreement.» '

Local 578, Gypsum Workers

Union, at New Westminster, has

./

held three meetings , with’ the 0

company, with no result so far.
The local is asking for twelve
cents across the board increase.

Contract committee for the l

, foundries consisted of Presi-
,f.- ,, dent Jack Stehr, C. Woods, Joe
. McGaughey, and Tom Barclay,
- with Wally Smith, H. J. E. Wil-
liams, and M. Kendrick acting

in Port Haney.
Louis Deitz and Jack ,Beattie
 headed the negotiating commit-

_tee for Local 578, and both 10- '

back.”

WALKER FOLLOWED in-
structions for the ‘remainder of
that day. and night, and it is
significant that he was able to
get a cabin in a motelin which
McNabb had had extreme dif-

ficulty in getting accomodation, 7

“due to, the lack of room.”
- The following day, Mr. Walk-

, er deposes, he took the" matter

of this ‘new duty up with his
superior officer, one Unia,

‘regional security officer); and

was informed that McNabb was

under surveillance because he‘

was “a C10 representative.”
Unia said that the orders

. came from the company person-

nel manager, R. S. ’Wilson, who
had ordered that a complete re-
port be made on » McNabb’s

movements and contacts, and-
Walker thereupon refused the

assignment.

“I advised Mr. Unia that as a
police officer I ‘objected to be-
coming involved in union mat-
ters, and did not wish to act on
his instructions. I pointed ‘out

that I was a union man mjﬁelf,

and stated that as police officer
I had no objection to carrying
out ‘normal police duties, but
that I felt that such instructions
he had given me were outside
such normal police duties,‘ and
I did not feel that I had‘ the
right or the cluty -to become
involved in union matters”.
WALKER STATED that he
was then relieved of the assign-
ment, and two other officers,
Jack Fraser and J. C. Andrews,
substituted, and that he believes
these,two, shadowed McNabb
and reported on him during his
stay in Kitimat, as plain clothes
officers although previously in
uniform, and outside the com-
pany police jurisdiction
throughout the townsite.

Mr. -Walker was fired from‘, 

_his job without any explanation
on May 5, and has been unable
to receive any answer from the
company to his demands for a
reason, although he has 'been

advised by the Unemployment,
‘Insurance Commission that his
“ release was for “cause.” '
Mr. Walker attests that: “I .

verily believe that the sole rea-
son for‘ my dlscharge was my
reluctance to become involved

in union matters,‘ by carrying’
-out the instructions given to me

by Mr. Unia as above set forth.
That I have" had 15 yea1's ex-
perlence as a police officer, and

-have hadan exemplary record

throughout that period.”

/-CMS Bluebell miners
vote Strike. 244-I0

‘NELSON, B.C.—-Bya vote of
244 to 10, comprising a’ majority
of 95.7 percentof those elegible,

subsidiary of the Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company,
elected strike action in protest
against the failure of the com-
pany to bargain in any respon-
sible sense.

  CM&S locals apply
for conciliation   

TRAIL, B. C.—TrailLocal 480 and Kimberley, Local”
,. 651, in joint bargaining with Consolidated‘ Mining and
Smelting Company, have applied for. a conciliation office

  
 

cer following a month’s fruitless negotiations. _, , , 
 Consolidated management rejected all proposals of g. 

    

. the workers of Bluebell Mine, a.

This is the first time in about

30 years that CM&S5 has been

facedwith strike action, nego-

tiations having progressed fair-
ly smoothly every" year since
Mine Mill re-entered the juris-
diction,,.but Bluebell wages and
conditipns lag far behind those
at ,the ‘main operations of Trail
and Kimberley. ‘

Bluebell miners belong to a
sub—local of Kimberley, Local
651, and‘ at the time the mine
opened thepromise was made
by the company that when pro-

duction got under way, their

employees at Bluebell would not
be discriminated against.

But" with wages 18 cents an
hour less at Bluebell than in the
two operations, and the com-
pany refusing to implement the

promise, of no discrimination'

and showing no intention of
bargaining seriously, even turn-
ing down the offer of a concili-
ation board chairman of’ a
miserable three cents increase,
Bluebell workers feel that hit-

ting the bricks is the only solu-

tion, and are determined ‘to
carry the fight through until‘
they get the agreement

VANCOUVER, B.C.: Inter-
esting in connection ‘with the
type of “evidence” being given
against Mine Mill before ‘the
National Labor Relations Board
in Washington is a Canadian
columnist’s reactionb to the pi"o-
ex-comrnunists who
supply so’ much copy to U.S.

fessional

newspapers.

VWriting in one ‘of the —most

influential (and reactionary)
papers of. Canada, the Toronto

Globe and Mail, J. V. McAree
asks his readers, referring ’ to
Herbert 2A. Philbrick: “Can ., a
Canadialtjmagine a Canadian

court ‘placing any faith in.such
a scoundrel?” ‘

“But in the United States,”—.

continues McAree, who inci-

5 dentally is one of the oldest of

Canadian columnists,.‘fhe is re-
garded by many‘ as a hero, -who

has deserved so well of his

country that he ought to be

supported‘ in comfort for the

rest of his life.” .

McAREE deals at length with
the perjury exposed during
cross-examination, of FBI and

government witnesses, and '

quotes from Whittaker. Cham-
bers’ book,“‘Witness” to show
how‘ admittedly degraded in
their own minds these profes-
sional witnesses are.

“It is to be noted”_ remarks,
McAree, “that although sev- , 
eral persons have been prose- _ _~ 3,
cuted for perjury on the testi- ., 5
mony of"ex-Communists," no ex- I. .,

umentary evidence submitted on , ;
