International Vice’-President

Editor’s note: For the past several weeks, Mine-Mill Interna-

 

'tional~Vice-President Asbury Howard has_ spent the majority of

his time in Selma, Ala., helping in arranging the marches through
which Negroes and whites are demonstrating the need for equal
voting rights for all. For the past 16 years, Howard has served as
president of the Bessemer, Ala. Voters League—-a group which has
succeeded in registering many of the Negroes living in the Bes-
semer area. This is Howard’-s report from Selma.)

 . ODAY, Selma, Alabama is the scene of one of the greatest

struggles for. freedom in the history of mankind. It differs
from-many in that this struggle for suffrage and 'for human dignity

isbeing ‘waged on the basis of turning the other cheek. '
6 Here, 50 miles from the cradle of the Confederacy, is being

» prepared its grave and final resting place. The battle will be won

here. There will be minor skirmishes all over Alabama and through-
out the South, but they will be merely the last gasps of a dying era.

Men and women, boys and girls, black, and white from’ all walks
of life-—clergy, professional men, laymen, domestics, farmers, stu-
dents——are here laying aside their individual problems and banding
together in this great struggle for freedom.

‘I: ‘ﬁr *
N SUNDAY, March 7, state troopers, Sheriff Clark’s deputies

and posse were acting under orders from Gov. George Wallace
to use whatever means were necessary to stop the march. Tear

' gas, smoke bombs, billy clubs, and bull whips were used to dispel

"the peaceful marchers who had knelt in prayer
when ordered to stop. The mounted posse
trampled the injured and kicked many of the
ﬂeeing demonstrators.

The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ap-
pealed to the nation to join him in Selma for a

rights organizations, and freedom-lovers from
22 states came to Selma to take part. When the
Negro leaders asked the federal court to pre-
vent interference with the march, Judge John-
son enjoined the marchers. Dr..King said, “We

cars side by side blocked the highway. The group of marchers,
-black and white intermingled, sang freedom songs—“We Shall

the feelings of all.

Granduc Avalcmche Kills 26;
Worst B.C. Disaster Since 1930

STEWART, B. C.--The Granduc mine avalanche on Feb. 18, which killed 26 workers and injured‘

18 more, was the worst industrial disaster in 35 years in British Columbia. Back in 1930, 45 men lost
their lives in an explosion at the Blakeburn coal mine. .

An inquest into the cause of the deaths, while attaching no blame, did recommend that in cases
where mining camps are situated in deeply mountainous territory with obvious dangers of snow slides

or avalanches specially trained personnel should be on hand at all

build up of snow on the glacier slides.
Over 100 miners, construction workers, and camp personnel were evacuated safely, although
several suffered severe cases of shock after haviing been flown out of the area by helicopter.
Al King, Canadian executive board member of Mine-Mill, took the first available plane to the site

o-f the avalanche, some 30 miles
north of this Northwest British

Columbia port town, to assist in ‘

the search and rescue operations,
which were coordinated by Lt.
Col. Matthews of the Royal Ca-
nadian Mounted Police.

Mine-Mill Members

Many of the miners at the
development project of the
Granduc Mining Company on the
edge of Leduc Glacier were
members of Mine-Mill from vari-
ous parts of Canada, and the un-
ion took the lead in setting up and
seeking public support for a dis-
aster fund to provide for the
families of the men killed. In
addition, the union agreed to
grant $1,000 bereavement pay to
all the widows or dependents of
the slide victims if the company
would match the payment.

This would be in addition to the
payment of death benefit plan
funds to those beneficiaries of
Mine-Mill members who qualify.

THE IOY OF REUNION is
felt by this Granduc miner
and his wife. More than 100
Workers escaped, but 26
died and another 18 were
injured in the Feb. 18 slide.

times to carefully estimate the

At a meeting of survivors in
Vancouver, John Moffett, a Mine-
Mill organizer, was assigned to
the inquest on the avalanche
and the inquiry that will follow.
Also assigned was Archie Mac-
Donald, president of Local 1037,
Shaft and Development Workers’
Union of Mine-Mill, who was
on shift at the development proj-
ect when the slide engulfed the
camp.

Disaster Fund

Agreeing to serve on the Dis-
aster Fund committee were Glen
Osborne, a former president of
the Bridge River Miners’ Union;
Jack Henderson, longtime trade
unionist and former president
of the B. C. Command Canadian
Legion; Les Walker, Mine-Mill
compensation and welfare offi-
cer; Chris Pritchard, former
commissioner of the Workmen’s
Compensation Board, now with
the Plumbers’ Union; and Mel
O’Brien, forn_1er director of Bra-
lorne Mines. The B.-C. Federa-
tion of Labor and the Vancouver
Trades and Labor Council were
each to add another member to
the committee.

Contributions should be made
out and sent to the “Granduc
Disaster Fund,” Imperial Bank
of Commerce, Main St. and
Broadway, Vancouver 10, B.C.

Mine-M-ill National President
Kenneth Smith and Vice—Presi-
dent Harvey Murphy, in a wire
to Donald Brothers, minister of
mines for the province, de-
manded that the government
act to prevent the re-opening of
the project until a thorough in-
vestigation is completed and all
dangers of a recurrence have
been removed. The union also
advised all employes except the
rescue crews, not to go back to
work until all possible safety
measures have been taken.

The U.S. and Canadian armies
also assisted in the rescue opera-
tions, as did the U.S. Coast
Guard. _

The mine was slated to go

into production in 1967,
eventually produce 44,000 tons of
copper in concentrates per year,
which will go to the AS&R
smelter in Tacoma, Wash.

The development work involves
cutting an 11-mile tunnel through
the mountain between the new
mine and tidewater and in build-
an access road. Some 40 men
were trapped in the tunnel for

many hours after the ‘slide, but .

most of those killed were work-
ers who were on their coffee
break in the bunk houses when
the avalanche hit.

OCAW Urges.
“Don't Buy
Shamrock Oil"

The Shamrock Oil and Gas
Corporation, which refuses to .
allow some 200 men who were ’
on strike against the com-
pany last fall to return to
work, is being boycotted by
the Oil, Chemical, and Atom-
ic Workers International Un-
ion.

The workers involved rep-
resent about half of the strik-
ing group."

Shamrock markets through-
out Texas, in large parts of
New Mexico, Colorado, Okla-
homa, and Kansas, and in a

' small way in Utah, Arizona,
and ‘Wyoming. There are
many "indications that the
boycott is hurting the com-
pany extensively.

Late in February, the
OCAW ended its consumer
boycott against Standard Oil
Co. of California, when the
company finally granted im-
provements meeting the pat-
tern of wage and benefit
gains won by the union from
other oil companies last sum-
mer.

Karen Vettorel
Places Second
In Essay Contest

Karen Marie Vettorel, 13-
year-old daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank L. Vettorel of Tuc-
son, Ariz., won second prize in
a nationwide essay contest spon-
sored by Catholic Miss, a mag-
azine published by Notre Dame
tUniversity by the Holy Cross
nuns and priests. Her entry was
titled, “The Christian Attitude
Toward the Negro.”
This was the third award for
Miss Vettorel, who won first
prize when she was in sixth

grade for an essay called,
“F a t h e r P r o —— The Mexican
Martyr.” Last year, she re-

ceived honorable mention for an
article on the late President
Kennedy.

Second prize carried a cash
award of $10 plus an additional
$10 for Miss Vettorel’s eighth
grade class at St. Cyril’s Pa-
rochial School. Her essay point-
ed out that Christianity grew
because its adherents were not
silent, and urged men today to
speak out or act in support of
the Negroes’ cause.

She is one of the top three
students in her class of nearly
100, maintaining a scholastic
average of 96 plus. Also a-volley
ball and softball player, she be-
longs to the Young Girls Good
Counsel Club.

Last fall, Miss Vettorel re-
ceived the Marian Award—the

highest rank a girl can reach
in scouting. On March 27, she
represented her school in the
district spelling contest.

Her father is an international

representative for Mine-Mill in.

committee and Congress, however, favored the sale of

the metal from the stockpile, as proposed by Sen. Stuart

iMetcalf-Montoya Safety Bill

Gains Additional Supporters

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The Metcalf-Montoya mine safety bill, although still not " '

scheduled for hearings, has picked up some additional Congressional support since
the last issue of the Mine-Mill Union.

George F. (Duke) Senner (D-Ariz.), Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), Edward Roybal
(D-Calif.) and Henry Gonzalez (D-Texas) again have introduced the bill in the House

of Representatives, joining in its sponsorship with Arnold Olsen (D-Mont.), David S.‘

King (D-Utah), Edward J. Patten (D-N.J.), and E. S. (Johimy) Walker (D-N.M.).
The latter three Congressmen are all new sponsors of the proposal, while the first five
men were among the six House sponsors of the measure last session. The other one,
Joseph M. Montoya (D-N.M.),’moved up to the Senate in the November election, and

has introduced the bill there.

The bill in the House has been assigned to the Committee on Education and

Labor, chaired by Adam Clay-
ton Powell (D-N.Y.).

On the Senate side, the pro-
posal has been re-referred from
the Committee on Interior, and
Insular Affairs to the Senate
Committee on Labor and_ Public
Welfare, chaired by Lister Hill
(D-Ala.)——a move which is ex-
pected to increase the chances
of favorable committee action
on the measure. It is now in the
Subcommittee on Labor.

Mansfield - Support

Speaking to the Mine-Mill Dis-
trict 1 conference at the Deer
Lodge (Mont.) Hotel on Feb.
26, Sen. Lee Metcalf, a Sen-
ate sponsor of the bill along with
Sens. Montoya and Frank Moss
(D-Utah), said he had assur-
ances from Democratic Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield of Mon-
tana that Mansfield will support
the bill when it reaches the
floor. .

In addition, Mine-Mill has re-
ceived pledges of support for the
bill from Teno Roncalio, a fresh-
man Democratic Congressman
from Wyoming, Florence P.
Dwyer (R-N.J.), Elmer J. Hol-
land (D-Pa.), and John H. Dent
(D.'P3..).

Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel. (R-
Calif.) has indicated that he will
watch for progress on the bill,
saying be appreciated ‘hearing
from the delegates to the recent
Mine-Mill District 3 conference
held in San Francisco. Sen. Mil-
ward L. Simpson (R-Wyo.) has
promised to give the matter
careful consideration. '

Letters from Congressmen

“I am entirely in sympathy
with the efforts being made to
have the implementing legisla-
tion approVe(,” writes Frank
Thompson, Jr. (D-N.J.), a mem-
ber of the House Committee on

Education and Labor. Another
committee member, William D.
Ford (D-Mich.), mentioned in
a letter to the union his “life-
long acquaintance with both the
urgency of and the need for

-mine "safety legislation and the

difficulty in having such legis-
lation adopted.” Ford’s family
came to the United States to
work in the coal mines of south-
ern Indiana.

Harold T. (Bizz) Johnson (D-
Calif.) writes, “As one who has
long been associated with labor
organizations, working for in-
creased benefits for all, you may
be sure that I will do everything
in my power to assist in secur-
ing consideration of this legis-
lation.”

Cong. Holland and Dent are
also members of the House Com-
mittee on Education and Labor,
and the latter has led the fight
to extend the coverage of the
Coal Mine Safety Act to small
mines employing less than 15
workers. 1 g

“This is to inform you that I

_ plan to support the mine safety

bill to which you referred in
your recent letter,” Cong. Dwyer
wrote to Ernest Jones, recording
secretary of Mine-Mill Local 837
in Carteret, N .J .

Cong. Roncalio informed the L

international office that he was
working with Cong. Olsen, “to
bring about its much needed
passage.” ‘-‘I shall be happy to
help him,” said the Wyoming
Congressman, “and your organi-
zation in whatever way is‘ pos-

sible toward the goals of greater

safety and a more effective safe-
ty program in the U.S. Bureau
of Mines for metal and mineral
mines.”

The Senate bill is numbered S.

996, while in the House the bill
receives a different number for
each of the eight sponsors.

Mine-Mill Unit Meets
With Iowa Solon

COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa--
John R. Hansen, Democratic
Congressman from the state’s
7th District, told Mine-Mill rep-
resentatives at a Feb. 12 meet-
ing that he is sympathetic with
the Metcalf-Montoya mine safety
bill, feeling that such a measure
is morally justified.

Mike Krivokuchi, Blaze Nuez,
and Eugene Fenderson, the
chairman of Local 461’s polit-
ical action_ committee, also
urged Rep. Hansen to support
the repeal of Section 14(b) of the
Taft- Hartley Act. Iowa is a

. “right-to wor ” state, but a bill

has been introduced in the state

legislature calling for repeal.

Congressional action to repeal
14(b), of course, would take the
matter out of the hands of the
states.

The local union delegation
also expressed their desire to
see federal action which would
end the atrocities to civil rights
demonstrators in Selma, Ala.
and would ensure that all cit-
izens of that state were given

their voting rights.  i

Although Local 461 is located
in Omaha, -Neb., quite ‘a few of
its members live in Council
Bluffs. Rep. Hansen succeeded‘
Ben Franklin Jensen (R-7th
District) last November.

The Omaha Sme1termen’s
Union’s PAC also is attempting
to set up a meeting with Rep.
Glenn C. Cunningham, a Repub-
lican from Nebraska’s 2nd Dis-
trict.

Woodbridge's 1st March

Urges Voter Legislation

WOODBRIDGE, N. J .—The
first citizens’ march ever ini-
tiated in this New Jersey com-
munity was held on Sat., March
13 to express sympathy with
the aspirations of Alabama Ne-
groes wishing to register to
vote. Sponsored by the Human
R e 1 a tio n s Commission, the
march was led by Mayor Walter
Zirpolo.

Covering a route which began
on Barron Avenue and ended
in front of the Municipal Build-
ing, the marchers carried signs
protesting police brutality in
Alabama. Other purposes of
the march, included support for
national legislation which would
allow federal registrars to be
used if necessary to ensure vot-
ing rights and which would
abolish the use of unreasonable
literacy tests for Voter regis-
tration. A

Federal intervention was
urged to protect the rights of
the Negro citizens of Alabama.

SNCC Speaker

A volunteer member of the
Student Non—Violent Coordinat-
ing Committee, recently re-
turned from service in the
South, was among the speak-
ers to address the crowd in
front of the Municipal Build-
ing.

Labor representatives took
part in the march, responding
to an appeal for labor’s partici-
pation from the Human Rela-
tions Commission.

William M. (Wiggy) Morton,
recently appointed a Mine-Mill
international representative, is
a inember of the nine-man com-
mission, which was established _

According to ’Morton, pro-
grams and activities during

claimed by Mayor Zirpolo from
Feb. 21 to 28, were very suc-
cessful, reaching many people
who had never been exposed to
such programs in the past.

Committee F attens Medicare;

Expected Soon to Pass House

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The U.S. House of Representatives may get a chance to
vote on the medicare bill during the week of April 5, and all indications are that the
bill will pass. Recently cleared by the Ways and Means Committee, where it was bot-
tled up last session, the bill will be the subject of hearings before the Rules Committee
before being brought out on the floor.

In September last year, the Senate Voted 49 to 44 to add health care for the aged
to the Social Security system. It has been in the House that the bill has had trouble

for the past six years.

The proposal just approved by Ways and Means, however, is not the same as the

bill introduced by Sen. Clinto

of the session. Strangely enough,
it’s been considerably beefed up.
And, stranger still, much of the
credit must be given. to the
American Medical Association.

Propaganda Blitz

No, the AMA isn’t now sup-
porting themeasure. lt’s still
dead set against it. The organi-
zation’s leaders, in fact, met in
Chicago early in February to
lay plans for a massive final
assault against medicare.-

Soon thereafter, the doctor’s
group unleashed a multi-million
dollar propaganda blitz against
the bill, which included radio,
television, newspaper and maga-

zine advertising plus thousands‘

of pamphlets for doctors’ offices.

The AMA House of Delegates"

had voted at its special session
to allow AMA trustees to use the
organization’s $14.7 million re-
serve fund to finance the cam-
paign.

But, its perennial cry of so- .

cialized medicine having worn
thin over the years (recent polls
show 63 percent of U.S. citizens
favor medicare; 28 percent op-
pose it), the AMA took a new
tack. The wail went up that
medicare didn’t provide enough
benefits for the elderly; that a
new program called “eldercare”
provided more—and at less cost.

The eldercare bill was intro-
duced in the House on Jan. 27
by Thomas B. Curtis (R-Mo.)
and —A. Sidney Herlong (D-Fla.).

Eldercare, like the Kerr-Mills
bill passed in 1960, proposes
that federal grants to the states
be matched by state funds——
state funds which, in many
cases, are simply not available.
In addition, under eldercare,
benefits would be provided only
to those persons over 65 who
can prove that their incomes
are below an amount specified
by the state in which they re-
side. '

Distortion of Truth

Then too, Rep. Herlong, a

sponsor of the bill, recently de-

clared that eldercare would not

provide the coverage which the

Rep. B y r n e s of Wisconsin,

most all the medical expenses of

Democrats beginning to smart
under the lash of the AMA’s
propaganda campaign on medi-
care’s shortcoming, Chairman
Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) and other
Democrats on the committee
went along with the proposal-
adding it to the original medi-
care. bill. , '
Basically, it would allow any-
one over 65 to pay a small
monthly premium for a federal
insurance policy covering home
or office treatment by doctors,
all prescribed drugs,‘ diagnostic
checkups in or out of a hospital,
rental of wheelchairs and

crutches, and 60 days of treat-

ment in a psychiatric hospital.
The hospital and nursing home
benefit of the original medicare
bill would be considerably ex-

tended in terms of length of,

would match each enrollee_"s
monthly premium.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Mine-Mill in Forefront of Civil
Rights Battle in Phoenix, Ariz.

PHOENIX, Ariz.—With the 27th state legislature in what is probably the last

week of its first regular session as the Mine-Mill Union goes to press, a watered-down
civil rights bill that is still in a conference committee of both houses is expected to
pass. Several civil rights organizations-, however, including the Tucson and Phoenix
branches of the NAACP, CORE, and the ACLU, may ask Gov. Sam Goddard to veto
the measure——feeling that no bill is better than the weakened Version.
A The Arizona Mine-Mill Council, scheduled to meet in Prescott on April 3, also
will consider calling for a gubernatorial veto on the bill, which has proved to be the
dominant issue of this session of the legislature.
Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain. The civil rights groups have mus-
tered more support for their cause than ever before in this state. Picketing at the
State Capitol has gone on throughout the month of March and other civil rights
marches and rallies have attracted large crowds. .
The fight on Senate Bill 21, introduced by Sol Ahee (D-Pima Co.), was brought
into the public forum on March 1, when some 30 representatives from CORE, the

NAACP, Mine-Mill, and the
Methodist Student Movement
marched outside the Capitol,
protesting the close to 90 House
amendments to the Senate-
passed bill. As the month wore
on, a dozen or more other or-
ganizations, including other

' labor groups, joined the protest.

With the joint conference com-
mittee meeting on the bill on
March 19, 400 demonstrators
picketed outside the Capitol

building.

Ahee Proposal

The original Ahee bill, pat-
terned after the national Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and setting
up enforcement procedures,
would provide equality of voting.
rights, eliminating literacy tests
for anyone-with a sixth grade
education, and would make
illegal discrimination in public
accommodations, in employ-
ment, in labor union member-

 ship. The proposal called for

V‘ - I
‘-53.1’

the establishment of a state Civil
Rights Commission with the
power of subpoena and contempt
citations and provided penalties
for violators of civil rights legis-

‘ lation.

Last year’s federal Civil
Rights Act left enforcement up

6 to thestates, with the Depart-

ment of Justice not being allowed
to interfere in those states hav-
ing such laws and proving a
record of enforcement.

Among the many Arizona
House amendments to the Ahee
bill was one which removed any
criminal penalties for civil

. rights vio1ations——an amendment

which, supporters charged, cut
the heart of the bill out.

In addition to the almost daily
picketing during the month-long
struggle, a sit-in was staged at
the Capitol on March 16 and
there was a bomb scare there
two days later, which proved to
be a hoax.

Immediately following the
initial demonstration, the groups
involv_ed decided to attempt to
broaden the struggle, seeking
support from other organiza-
tions. A meeting was called at
the Santa Rita Hotel in Tucson,
to which some 15 organizations
sent representatives.

Supporters Numerous

Joining the battle during the
month were the state AFL-CIO,
the American Civil Liberties
Union, Links, Lelis Club, the
Democratic District 2 Club,
Young -Democrats of Greater

Club, the Bar Association, the

International Vice-

President Asbury Howard was the main speaker at a
rally at the Santa Rita Hotel, sponsored by a committee
of Tucson civil rights organizations, toprotest the water-
ing down of proposed rights legislation by the Arizona
House of Representatives. On the platform behind Howard
are, L. to R.: Robert Horn (partially hidden), president of
the Tucson NAACP; Hector Morales, president of the
Greater Tucson Young Democrats; James Doran, AFL-CIO,
representing the Tucson Trades Council; William Messing,
ACLU, who chaired’ the rally; Maclovio R. Barraza, Mine-

‘Mill board member, who addressed the crowd briefly;

Mrs. Gloria Hurley, active in the civil rights fight; and
Rev. Iohn C. Fowler, pastor of St. Michael's Episcopal
Church in Tucson, who called upon the audience to
demonstrate in Phoenixin behalf of a strong Arizona bill.

Friends, Pioneer Women,
Tucson Committee on Human
Relations, Jewish Community
Council, the Unitarian Univer-
salist Social Action Club, Tucson
Ministerial Alliance, the Catholic
Church, the AME Church, and
many other church organiza-
tions.

The events in Selma, Ala. dur-
ing this period—police brutality
encountered by the marchers,
the death of the Rev. James
Reeb — also produced increased
support for the civil rights fight
in Arizona. On Sunday, March
14, a memorial service at the
First Methodist Church in
Tucson, called by that city’s
clergymen, was attended by
some 375 persons. Father
Richard O’Keeffe of St. Cyril’s
Church, who has often partici-
pated in Mine-Mill functions
around the Tucson area, took
part in_the service along with
other Catholic, Protestant, and
Jewish clergymen. '

About 100 persons at the ser-
vice then marched to the West-

fern Union telegraph office to

wire President Johnson, asking
for “immediate and appropriate
action” in Selma.

Steering Group

Steering committees to coordi-
nate the various activities of the
organizations supporting the
strong Arizona civil rights bill
were set up in both Tucson and
Phoenix. Mine-Mill had solid
representation from David

a cheering audience ofsome 350 1

people, _ “Your cry should be,
‘Give me a strong bill or no bill

The Rev. John C. Fowler,
pastor of St. Michael’s Episcopal
Church in Tucson, urged his
listeners to demonstrate in
Phoenix the following day.
James Doran of the AFL-CIO

Mill Board Member Maclovio R.

Robert Horn, president of the
Tucson NAACP, and Hector
Morales, president of the
Greater Tucson Young Demo-
crats, also took part.

A year ago, a package of pro-

posed civil rights legislation,.

including a House-passed public
accommodations bill, was killed
in the state Senate.

Mine-Mill also joined in
demonstrations‘ at that time, and
pledged its continued assistance
to the NAACP, CORE, and other
civil rights organizations until
the fight is eventually won. The
union said then that it would
strongly consider the votes by
legislators on civil rights pro-

rights organiza- '

posals in determining its politi-
cal endorsements in 1964.

Senator Ahee and Rep. Tony
Carrillo (D-Pima Co.), one of
the strongest House supporters
this year of the original Senate
bill, were on the Mine-Mill slate
last November.

Some communities in Arizona
have local civil rights ordinances
designed to prevent discrimina-
tion in public accommodations.

War on Truth-in-Packaging

Bill Includes News

 

 ufflng

The $80 billion-a-year food industry has pulled itself together for an all-out drive
to defeat Senator Philip A. Hart's Truth-in-Packaging bill. In this fight, says Con-

sumers Union in an article in its March issue of CONSUMER REPORTS, the food

advertisers are using their strong influence over communications media to stifle news
of consumer complaints, and putting their large trade association network at work to
induce Congressmen to vote against the bill.

Truth-in-Packaging is the bill that calls for clear, legible statement of net weight
on packages; establishment of reasonable standards of weight or size (like 16 ounces
or 8 ounces instead of 13 3/ 7 ounces or 5 7/16 ounces); and prohibition of deceptive
words, deceptive pictures, and deceptive sizes, shapes or proportions of the packages.

The vehemence of consumer complaints at the first hearings on packaging took
the food industry off guard, Consumers Union says, and in contrast to many other con-

Paul Willis, president of the
Grocery Manufacturers Associa-
tion, was telling TV advertising
men that he had met with top
management people from na-
tional magazines and had ex-

plained to them “the facts of.

life” concerning relationships

between food advertisers and"

advertising media. The maga-
zine people were cooperating.

The TV men, too, seemed to
get the message. As he re-
minded them, TV stations re-
ceive “about 65% of their ad-
vertising revenue” from mem-
bers of the Grocery Manufactur-
ers Association.

Appearances Cancelled

So far as CU was able to de-
termine, with two exceptions
the 1963 packaging hearings
were ignored by TV, and Sena-
tor Hart had several TV ap-
pearances cancelled.

With Truth-in-Packaging (now
renamed Fair Packaging and
Labeling) coming up again for
consideration by Congress, the
food industry has begun a new
phase of its campaign. A re-
cent article in a national maga-
zine suggests the nature of this
phase.

Advertiser Charles G. Morti-
mer, chairman of General Foods
Corp., wrote an article carried
as editorial content in the Jan.
26 issue of Look. His topic:
“Let’s Keep Politics Out of the
Pantry.” The article is dis-
cussed in the following excerpt
from the March issue of CON-
SUMER REPORTS.

“Mr. Mortimer salutes the
American housewife, whom he
calls Mary Jones. He finds her
a shrewd and happy woman-—
shrewd because ‘when it comes
to clever buying’ she ‘can give
lessons to a Yankee horse
trader’ and happy because ‘she
takes it for granted that what
she has bought is the purest,
most nutritious, easiest-to-pre-
pare food the world has ever
seen.’ He pays tribute to the
laws safeguarding our food in
making his point about how
confident Mary Jones can be
when she shops, evidently as-
suming her (and the reader’s)
unawareness of the fight the
food industry waged against the
passage of the very laws he

. praises. (Recorded against his

own company, incidentally, are
28 violations in the last 25 years
against one of those laws, the
Federal Food, Drug and Cos-
metic Act.)

Deeply Disturbed

“What disturbs him deeply,
Mr. Mortimer writes, is that
‘Mary Jones probably does not
‘know’ that her great good for-
tune as a food shopper results
from ‘the machinery of free
competition’-—a free competition
that is ‘the heart of our free-
enterprise system’ . Mr.
Mortimer is the chairman of a
food combine that is the nation’s
largest and a prime example of
what the Federal Trade Com-
mission has called ‘economic
power and market concentration
created by the ‘great merger
movement.’ General Foods was
created in the 1920’s, by ‘merg-
ers; it grew into a huge empire
by still other mergers (it

V sumer issues, news of the packaging complaints was reported. But by March 1963,

such that it commands over
$100,000,000 worth of market-
manipulative advertising power
a year.
“Esther Peterson, the Presi-
dent’s Special Assistant for Con-
’ sumer Affairs, is the only gov-
ernment official named, aside
from Senator Hart. When she
urged housewives to send in
‘ complaints to her, she ‘created
doubts in the minds of consum-
ers where none had existed,’
thereby threatening the happy,
but apparently fragile, confi-
dence of Mary Jones. Senator
Hart's threat is, of course,
Truth-in-Packaging.

Other side "Might"
Be Presented
“After the article appeared
Senator Hart wrote to Look’s
publisher and editor-in- chief,
Gardner Cowles . . . suggest-
ing that there was another side

to the packaging issue, and ask- -

ing whether he (Senator Hart)
might not be given the oppor-
tunity to clarify some of these
matters for the readers of
Look. Mr. Cowles replied: ‘I
will be interested to see how
much attention the general pub-

lic pays to this subject in the ‘

next several months.’ If inter-
est should prove high, he might
consider asking the Senator to

SEN. PHILIP A. HART OF MICHIGAN

do something on the subject, he
indicated. He went on to say,
however: ‘It is my present
guess that the public does not
feel any strong need for reform
in the. area Mr. Mortimer was
discussing; but I could be
wrong.’

“Look added a ﬁnal filip to
its latest venture into‘ coopera-
tive publishing by taking full-
page ads in other magazines, in-
cluding a number -of the trade
journals read by GMA mem-
bers, to publicize its sponsor-
ship of ‘this compelling arti-
cle.’ ”

Hearings on the Packaging
Bill are tentatively scheduled
for late in April or early May.
It will be interesting to note
what kind of coverage is given
to this issue by other magazines
and by TV stations.

“The Time for Action Is Now’’--
Presolenl Lyndon . Johnson

by AI Skinner
International President

ITH THE DYNAMIC WORDS above, the President of the
, United States laid down the challenge little over two weeks
ago to the Congress and to millions of Americans watching or
listening on the national TV or radio networks. A

No American president in our history ever made a more
profound or stirring address on equality and civil rights. It was
Johnson’s greatest hour in his long career as a political leader. _
In maintaining, “We shall overcome,” he adopted the battle cry  I
of the Negro people, and without reservation joined them in every
aspect of their great struggle for full equality and full citizensliip.

It has been 345 years since the first Negro was brought to our
shores from Africa and sold as a slave.

It has been 180 years since -the Constitution of the United
States was adopted—declaring that “all men are created equal.”

It has been 100 years since the Civil War ended and slavery _ A I
was abolished in the United States.

; And still today the Negro people are not free.

. The Cancer Still There _

HERE ARE STILL large sections of our nation where a black
American is not free . . .

To vote in local, state, or federal elections;

To eat in a restaurant of his choice;

To sleep in many hotels and motels;

To get a job in the thousands of plants and establishments
that continue to hire whites only; -

To ride in the front of the bus;

To drink water from certain fountains;

To use certain restrooms;

To speak without the permission of a white man;

To associate with whomever he pleases; .
To live in a house and a neighborhood of his own choosing.

, For violation of these and other unwritten laws of segregation
and discrimination, thousands of -Negroes have paid with their
lives. Few, if any, white bigots have ever been convicted or
sentenced for these crimes. Until only recently, it has been easier
in the South for a white man to kill a Negro than to shoot a horse
or cow. ' "

 

A Century of Shame , 1

OR A FULL CENTURY after the end of -slavery, this country , 5

permitted and accepted different brands of “justice” for Ne-
groes and whites.

Only now is the nation’s conscience
finally being awakened. Only now are many
becoming determined to excise this cancer
from the American community.

This happened only after the Negro
people themselves shocked us into action.
By sit-downs, sit-ins, protest marches,
picketing, mass registration drives, the

 

America from its century of shame. Every
one of us should be grateful for the sacri-
fice and struggle of the Negro people—for
America will be a better and more united
nation as a result of this struggle.

There can be little doubt but that the . ’
long and difficult battle for civil rights is now over the hump. But
let us not be mistaken in thinking that no battles are left to be ‘
won before complete equality is achieved.

HE WHITE POLITICIAN in the South is a special breed. He has ’

built his political career on special privilege for the few and
denial of voting rights for the many. He has poisoned the ‘minds
of millions of poor whites with bigotry. He has divided white and
Negro by licensing poor whites to oppress the Negroes. He has
brain-washed white children with a false concept of superiority

Many Southern political leaders in Congress have been respon-  
sible for the defeat of progressive legislation that would have been 7
good for the people of this country. Northern politicians and very
often the Republican party itself have organized coalitions with _
these Southern Democrats to pass anti-labor bills, anti-education ,
bills, and defeat any proposal for decent social legislation. They

_ threaten now to filibuster against the equal voting rights bill.

Many will fight to the last ditch to retain their political jobs  (:-
and keep the Negro from voting. They see the handwriting on the  
wall. When Negroes can freely vote in Southern states, the ‘careers “ ‘_ ‘
of these bigoted politicians will come to an end. 

New and far more progressive political leaders will be elected
to represent the South. The wholenation will benefit when ‘all
people can vote.

THE MINE-MILL UNION _ 7

Two Arbitration Cases Won  
By Morenci Miners Union

CLIFTON, Ariz.——Oscar Buttner, a member of Mine-Mill Local 616, won back a.
job with the Phelps Dodge Corporation and received $3,137.21 in back pay as a result
of an arbitration ruling handed down by Dr. George H. Hildebrand in February. In
another case successfully pursued by the local union, the same arbitrator found that
R. P. Espinoza had been unfairly disqualified by the company as a head panel track
layer and ordered PD to make up the lost pay. caused by his disqualification.

The Labor Scene I

Strike Deadline Postponed

Auto Workers at Chase Brass in Waterbury, Conn., have been
working without a contract since November 15, 1964. Major issues
in the dispute are wages, pensions, SUB, and health and Welfare;
The local asked for and got strike authorization from the interna-
tional, but at the request of Connecticut state mediation officials
have postponed their March 12 strike date.

OCAW Strikes on Automation

Smelter workers at National Zinc in Bartlesville, Oklahoma
represented by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers struck on
March 9. The contract, which runs until August 2, contains a clause
permitting strikes over “working conditions.” The 450 members of
the local are protesting installation of new production methods
which will eliminate several jobs.

Accidents Up Since-Rail Layoffs

In 1963, Congress set up an extraordinary compulsory arbitra-
tion board to settle the dispute over railroad operators’ insistence
on eliminating thousands of jobs‘ held by members of the Brother-
hood of Locomotive Firemen. An ‘award permitting the operators
to make the- layoffs went into effect in March of 1964. Since that
time BLFE membership has dropped 20 percent to 40,000. The final
effect of the award will permit the layoff, retirement, or transfer
of 90 percent of the firemen on freight and switching yard diesels.

Another effect of the award has been to strengthen the cam-
paign for repeal of the “full-crew” laws which were in effect in
14 states. Four states have already repealed these laws and cam-
paigns are under way for their repeal in theremaining 10.

BLFE leaders have filed damage suits over what they charge
is misapplication of the award and look forward to a real battle
when the two-year duration of the award expires on March 31-,
1966. At that time the union will attack the legality of the award
and will emphasize the increase in railroad accidents since removal

Abel Apparent Victor in USW Election

Steel industry bargaining has begun with Steel union officials

* momentarily damping down the charges_ and countercharges that

flew during the recent USW election. Although no official count has
been announced pending investigation of charges of election fraud,
the Abel forces are reported to have made a clean sweep with
comfortable margins for Moloney as vice-president and Burke as
secretary-treasurer, and an 8,000-vote lead for Abel over McDonald
for the presidency. Union tellers are constitutionally required to
report the returns by May 1, which is also -the expiration date of the
steel contracts. .

Rumors that the Department of Labor may intervene and call
for a re-run of the vote are discounted; it is known that although
McDonald favors the idea, other Steelworkers are flatly opposed,
as is the AFL-CIO leadership generally.

Meany Favors Convention Elections

Meantime, the Labor Department has announced that it will
recount the ballots in the bitter contest between James Carey, in-
cumbent president of IUE, and Paul Jennings, challenger. Union
members‘ voted in December and when IUE officially announced
Carey’s victory, Jennings promptly challenged the results in a
court suit. '

- Wall Street Journal columnist John F. Lawrence calls industry
the “innocent victim” of union election contests like the one in
steel and wonders “whether the government should help run union
elections——whether industry should be given some protection against
the damage that balloting bottlenecks can cause.”

AFL-CIO President George Meany says thatin the IUE and
USW elections, “the referendum system hasn‘t Worked.” He favors
convention elections, he says, because they are less likly to have
long drawn-out consequences.

labor organizations in Japan charge present labor law restricts

was fired on June 26 last year
for a violation of safety rules.

Penalty Too Severe
Although the union conceded
that Buttner was guilty of a
safety infraction on June 24, it
argued that discharge was too
severe a penalty. The union at-_

tributed the harsh penalty hand-

ed Buttner to his activity as a
grievanceman, who had on sev-
eral" occasions criticized the
company for violations of safety
rules in the smelter. It was
pointed out, too, that his re-
flexes-at age 52 are undoubted-
ly not as good as they.used to
be.

Hildebrand’s ruling found no
deliberate intent. on the part of
Buttner to violate the safety
rules and ordered the company
to allow him to take a voluntary
demotion as a means of rein-
statement without. break in ser-
vice. The back pay was figured
at the lower job rate and a one-
day penalty layoff andother in-
terim earnings also were de-
ducted. .

Buttner’s safety violation in-
volved pouring slag into a fur-
nace spout without a go ahead
signal, forcing two other work-
ers on anearby platform to run

being burned. .

Second Case

In the other case, Hildebrand
ruled that Espinoza, a panel
track layer for some 13 years,
was not incompetent as a lead-
man as the
charged, but instead was prob-
ably the victim of a plan -by
other workers in the crew- to

discredit him as a leadman.

Explains Mine Safety Bill;

Has High Praise for Union

DEER LODGE, Mont.—-The Metcalf-Montoya fed-
eral mine safety bill which would cover metal and.min-
eral mines, mill, and integrated smelters and refineries
is a comprehensive measure which does not contain the

‘several deficiencies of the present Coal Mine Safety Act,

U. S. Sen. Lee Metcalf said in a Friday evening banquet
speech which highlighted a Mine-Mill District 1 confer-
ence here on Feb. 26 and 27..

The Democratic Senator from Montana» called his

bill stronger than a similar proposal still to be introduced
in Congress by the Johnson administration.

Close to 100 conference delegates and their wives

attended the dinner which also was addressed briefly by
Earl Wahl, mayor of Deer Lodge, and John Fitzpatrick

and Joseph Shay, Democratic central committee chair-
men for Deer Lodge and Silver Bow counties respectively.

During the business sessions of the well-attended

two-day conference, some 65 Mine-Mill members from '

Montana, Idaho, and Washington heard reports on the

gains made by the union last year and discussed plans
for the future.

The group passed a resolution, introduced by Local

16 President Arthur Clausen of Great Falls, to support ‘

efforts to build a $1 million international strike fund and
to raise wages paid to officers and staff. The increased
bargaining power to be derived
from such a fund was stressed,
but no decision was made by
the conference on how the prob-
lem should be tackled. Various
proposals were referred for com-

study.

up to 100,000 tons of stockpiled
copper to industry producers in
order to “eliminate the boom or

tight supply situation now ex-
ists. A bill to that effect that he
and Majority Leader Mike Mans-
field (D-Mont.) introduced re-
ceived the backing of the inter-
national union.

The mine safety bill, intro-
duced on Feb. 4 by Sens. Met.-
calf, Frank Moss (D-Utah), and
Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.), was"
transferred from g the Interior
and Insular Affairs Committee
to the Senate Committee on La-
bor and Public Welfare, Sen.
Metcalf told his audience. Its
p r o s p e c t s are considerably
brighter in the latter committee,
it is felt.

He explained that the bill does
not exclude small mines em-

ploying less than 15 workers, as_

does the Coal Mine Safety Act,
and does not contain a so-called
“grandfather clause,” which
would allow the continued use
of unsafe equipment being used
at the time of the adoption of
the bill.

when it comesto the Senate
floor, Sen. Metcalf predicted.

Saying he was “proud, privi-
leged, and honored” to address

praised the union as a fighting"
group which has helped to pre-
vent “certain employers and or-

Chilean voters, in a nationwide election March 7, handed a sweeping victory to
the Christian Democratic party, whose candidate, Eduardo Frei,was elected president
of Chile last September with a 56 percent vote total.

The Christian Democrats became the first party in this century to win an absolute

majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Chilean legislatnre.f

Christian Democratic candidates were elected to 82 of the 147 seats in the chamber.

-Previously, the party had held only 28 seats. A
In 21 contested Senate races, the Christian Democrats won 12,

total of 14 seats in this 45-member body.
Middle-of-the-road and right-wing, conservative parties lost heavily in the elec-

tions. Two parties to the le t of the Christian Democrats

Socialists increasing their seats

in the Chamber of Deputies

from 12 to 15 and the Commu-
nists from 16 to 18 seats.

While lacking a majority of
the Senate, President Frei’s
party, in the opinion of’ most
observers, is now in a position
to put through the Christian
Democrats’ p r 0 g r a In, which
Frei has labeled “Revolution in
Freedom.” The new legislature
convenes May 21. ,

Points in Program

The program includes a 38-

percent wage increase to match
last year's rise in the cost of
living, land redistribution, gov-

“The cries of pain, the hynms and protests of op-
pressed people, have summoned into convocation all the
majesty of the government of the greatest nation on
earth.” The words are those of President Lyndon John-
son, addressing a joint session of Congress and the
American people on the evening of March 15, in a speech

promising to introduce legislation which would protect

voting rights of all Americans.

: ‘, On March 25, 30,000 persons, Negro and white, '
marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to the Capi-

tol in Montgomery, Ala. in the most massive civil rights
demonstration in the South’s history, shouting “Free-

dom Now!” and singing “We Shall Overcome.”

The

marchers came from all over the country to participate.
There was a group from Canada.

Earlier and Later
Violence

Only a few weeks earlier, on
Feb. _18, Jimmie ‘Lee Jackson,
26, was fatally shot by a state
trooper during a civil rights
demonstration in Marion, Ala.
Jackson was a Negro.

Nor did the successful entry
of the marchers into Mont-
gomery end the violence. That
night, Mrs. Viola Gregg Liuzzo,
39-year-old mother of five, was
shot and killed as she drove
back to Montgomery from
Selma after taking a carlo-ad of
civil rights demonstrators home.
Four men — called Ku Klux
Klansmen by President Johnson
—-have been arrested by the FBI
and charged with conspiracy in
the slaying of Mrs. Liuzzo, the
wife of a Teamsters Union of-
ficial in Detroit.

Last month’s turbulence in
Selma is but a part of a struggle
which dates back for centuries.
And that struggle is far from
over. But Selma is another
milestone. "

Voting Rights Bill

The bill sent to Congress by
President Johnson on March 17
contains four main provisions
seeking to make it possible for
all citizens to vote in all elec-
tio-ns—federal, state, and local.
These provisions would:

0 Eliminate literacy tests or
any other “test or device” as
a means of denying anyone the
right "to vote in a state or
county where less than 50 per-
cent of the persons of voting

I

        
    

ea-.civi1"2-rightsi:-d

age are registered or voting.

0 Empower federal registrars
to register "voters in such states
or counties, wherever 20 or
more residents say they have
been discriminated against in
attempting to register.

.0 Place jurisdiction for en-
forcing the act-—or hearing ap-
peals brought under it——solely
in the Federal Court in Washing-
ton, D. C., thus preventing fed-

eral district judges in the South’

from issuing injunctions against
its enforcement.

9 Outlaw threats, coercion, or
intimidation against any person
attempting to vote under au-
thority of the act.

Most violations of the law
would carry a penalty of up to
five years in jail or a $5,000 fine,
or both. .

The bill, expected to receive
quick Congressional approval, is
designed to enforce the 15th
Amendment to the U. S. Consti-
tution, which declares that the
right to vote shall not be denied
on the basis of race, color, or
creed.

on Washington for Jobs and

—a march in which 200,000 took
part.

In his speech on March 15,

President Johnson gave credit
to the civil rights movement for
the pressure which helped pass
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
will help pass the proposed vot-
ing rights legislation. “The real
hero of this struggle,” he said,_
“is the American Negro. His
actions and protests—his cour-‘
age to risk safety and even life
—have awakened the conscience
of the nation. His demonstra-
tions have been designed to call
attention to injustice, to pro-

voke change and stir reformf

He has called upon us to make
good the promise of America.

No should anyone forget Mrs.

Louis E. Lomax, an assistant

entitled “The Negro Revolt,” re-
calls a Mississippi woman once

“The explosion,” writes Lo-

Parks boarded the Cleveland

Montana Legislature’s Record   
Includes Several Labor Gains

HELENA, Mont.—The 39th legislature adjourned on March 10, having compiled a labor record as
good or better than any session in the past 25 years. Mine-Mill, the AFL-CIO in Montana, the Farmers
Union, and the railroad brotherhoods worked closely together throughout the session to coordinate

lobbying activities.

Indicative perhaps of the tone of the legislative session was the fact that the House of Repre-
sentatives and Senate passed a joint resolution calling upon Congress to repeal Section 14(b) of the
Taft-Hartley Act—that sectionwhich allows states to enact so-called “right-to-work” laws. Although

Indiana repealed “RTW” there, no other state legislature passed such a resolution this year.

\

Originally sponsored in the Senate by Frank Reardon (D-Silver Bow), a bill upping workmen’s

compensation payments by $6 a
week across-the-board was ap-
proved. The payments, which
had ranged from $29 to $50 per
week, thus will be increased to
from $35 to $56.
Silico'l*ics' Payments

In another action of particular
interest to Mine-Mill, compensa-
tion payments to silicotics were
increased from $75 to $90 per
month. Although the House had
passed an increase to $100 per
month, the Senate Finance and

Claims Committee cut the pay-'

ment back to $85. Rep. Thomas

"Tracy of Silver Bow County

moved not to accept the ‘Senate

amendment, and the.bill went to ‘

conference‘ committee where the

final figure was approved.
Included in a general revision

of the laws relating to the De-

partment of Public Institutions,

was a bill changing the name of
the Galen State. Tuberculosis
Sanitarium to Pulmonary Dis-

ease Hospital. Previously limited
to the treatment of TB and sili-
cosis, the hospital will now take
patients with emphysema, bron-
chiectasis, lung cancer, and
other diseases of the lung. An-
other bill authorizes the Indus-
trial Accident .Board to order
the replacement or repair of
artificial limbs damaged in an
industrial accident.

The Occupational Dis e a s e
Compensation Act was amended
by adding asbestosis to the list
of compensable diseases.

An amendment to the Unem- '
ployment Compensation I L a W

tired persons from the program

PETITIONS CALLING FOR FEDERAL ACTION to protect the civil rights demonstrators

Immediately circulated by the union after the police brutality against the Selma

President Johnson. Included among the signers were Mayor Walter Zirpolo of Wood-
bridge, N.I., George Otlowski, a county freeholder, and Norman Tanzman, a state legis-

been detrimental to the workers. ,

One such -bill, while offering an
increase of $3 in weekly unem-
ployment benefits, would have
denied all benefits to workers in
the three lowest brackets—some
30 percent of the total now cov-
ered. It would have benefited
the employers by denying un-.
employment payments to any
worker who quits or is dis-
charged.

Mine-Mill also was a major
factor in the defeat of a pro-
posal which would have in-
creased the insurance costs of
the Montana.-Physicians Service

by about two and a half percent 

—costs which would eventually
have had to be bome by the in
sured person. , '
The legislature set up the ma-
chinery to implement the federal
Kerr-Mills Act, a program to
provide medical assistance to
those older persons who can
show that they themselves or
their relatives can’t finance the

costs.

Also approved was a civil
rights bill providing penalties
for violators.

The legislative session ran 66

days. Late at night on March 9,
a small hike in income tax rates
was approved, with adjournment
coming the following afternoon.
The tax hike will cost two-thirds
of Montana’s taxpayers less than
50 cents a year, and will bring
in upwards of $4 million over its
two-year effective period. The
corporation license tax was
boosted for two years from 4.5
to 5.25 percent. This will pro-
duce an additional $1.7 million.

Mine-Mill International Repre-
sentative G e o r g e Kalafatich
spent full time in lobbying at the
legislature since the session
opened. Barney Rask, the dis-
trict board member, also gave
much attention to legislative de-
velopments, as did other mem-
bers of the Mine-Mill Legislative
Council, the union’s statewide

 political action committee. Rep-

resentatives from local unions

testified at several committee .

hearings on Mine - Mill - backed
bills.

Dist. 5 Delegates OK Strike Fund Plans
Approve Establishment of Smeling.
Die-Casing Conferences for District

NEW YORK, N. Y.—~An eight-point, program of
District 5 activity was enthusiastically supported by 56
delegates to a district conference here on Feb. 19 and 20,
who also unanimously agreed to push towards the build-
ingot a $1 million international union strike fund.

International officers and staff members reported
on the achievements of the union in the past year, and
plans ‘were laid for action in the areas of politics and

Originally scheduled to be held in Baltimore, Md.,
the two-day meeting was switched to the Henry Hudson
Hotel in this city because of recent complaints that many

Negroes. Noting that Mine-Mill
members are accustomed to at-

N tending meeting and socializing

with their colleagues without be-
ing separated ‘on the basis of
race, Board Member Alfred
Petit-Clair, who chaired the con-
ference, pledged the internation-
al’s support to local leaders and
agencies fighting for equal op-
portunities and accommodations
for all persons.

Parren J. Mitchell, executive
secretary of the Maryland Com-
mission on Interracial Problems
and Relations, has vowed to
fight for a bill in the current
session of the General Assembly
which would cover all businesses
catering to the public.

Guest Speaker

George Otlowski, a ‘Middlesex
County (N.J.) freeholder and
publisher of a Polish-American
newspaper there, was a guest
speaker at the conference. He
urged support for the medicare
bill now before Congress and for
federal aid for the education of
all citizens. ‘ '

International Vi c e - President
Asbury Howard led the discus-
sion on political action, during
which the local leaders indicated
that there was a greater degree
of Mine-Mill participation in the
last election campaign than ever
before in the district, which in-
cludes local unions in New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Penn-
sylvania, and Maryland.

Eiglrl--Point Program

Included in the proposed pro-
gram of district activity were
plans to issue a quarterly news
letter from the district office, to
get out regular local union news
letters to the members, to initi-
ate education programs in each
local, to explore the possibilities
of new organizational work in
each area.

In addition, an Eastern Smelt-
ing Council will be established
and will meet regularly and
more attention will be given to
the establishment on a perma-
nent basis of the Die-Casting
Conference in coordination with
District 4, which covers the Mid-
West and South. Each local will
be urged to keep their political

Finally, the board member and
staff representatives will work
closely with local leaders to con-
tinue to improve the carrying
out of the‘ routine functions of

Much of the discussion, which
was lively throughout the two-
,day meeting, centered on future
negotiations with the companies,
with stress being laidlon the in-
creased bargaining power to be
derived from a larger strike
fund. International President
A. C. Skinner pointed out that
negotiations on most of the un-
ion’s pension plans will be open
in 1967, and called for a concen-
trated effort to substantially im-
prove them. ‘

Much credit was given to the

from other Mine-Mill locals in

Kills Kenn-eootl’s Overtime Bill

CARSON CITY, Nev.‘—0n March 18, the Nevada General As-
sembly killed a bill which would have repealed the present law
making it illegal for companies to work mill and smelter workers
longer than eight hours a day—an action that was a victory for
Assemblyman Boyd Manning, the Mine-Mill Union, and other labor

organizations in the state.

Kennecott and many smaller mining companies in the state had

sought the change.

,Verne Curtis, Mine-Mill board member, and Louis Paley, exec-
utive secretary of the state AFL-CIO, testified at joint committee
hearings of the Assembly and Senate thatthe bill would allow the
companies to force overtime work on men who didn’t want it. Point-

ing out that Kennecott would
like to be able to make men
work entire additional shifts,
Curtis said that the company
would then be in a position to
discharge and discipline em-
ployees who refused to ‘accept
such work.

Spending the two weeks before
the vote lobbying on the bill at
the legislature were Tom Jones
and Jay Carson, recording sec-
retary and vice-president re-
spectively of Mine-Mill Local 233
in McGill, and Thomas Jeffer-
son, recording secretary of L0-
cal 124 in Ruth.

Join-l' Labor Committee

A joint labor committee which
included representatives of sev-
eral AFL-CIO unions in the state
was set up to oppose the pro-
posed change in the law. Dale
Egbert of Lodge 279 of the Inter-

national Association of Machin- ~

ists spent three weeks lobbying
against the bill, which had been
introduced by James Wood and
Thomas Kean, both Reno Repub-
licans, and James Gibson, a
Democrat from Henderson.
Other labor lobbyists besides
Paley were Richard Thomas of

the Boilermakers, a delegate

from the White Pine Metal
Trades Council, and Tony Kee-
gan from the I.A.M. The Operat-
ing Engineers were also repre-
sented on the joint committee.
Assemblyman Manning, a
Democrat from White Pine, led
the ﬂoor fight to smother the
bill. The vote was 17 to 15, with
a constitutional majority of 19
votes needed to pass a bill.

Victory

Vancouver, some 30 miles south
of Britannia Beach, to express
the labor solidarity. The Van-
couver Labor Council passed a
resolution calling for a govern-
ment investigation of the com-
pany’s actions.

The United Fishermen and
Allied Union donated about 600
lbs. of choice cohoe salmon to
the strikers and their families.
Donations from U.S. Mine-Mill
locals alone totaled over $7,000.

International President A. C.

Skinner, who was at Britannia ‘V

Beach at the time of the ratifi-
cation meeting, called the settle-
ment a victory for the whole
union. “As usual,” he said, “the
company now settles for what
they said they never would.”

Jack Balderson, president of
Local 663, chaired the meeting.
The immediate wage increases
in the new contract are: Surface
labor, 26% cents per hour; un-
derground labor, 331/2 cents per

hour; miners, 32‘/2 cents; hoist-

men, 35% cents; first-class sur-
face tradesmen, 391/2 cents; and
first-class underground trades-
men, 531/2 cents.

The last strike at the Britan-
nia property, formerly owned by
Howe Sound Mining Company,
was in 1946, although the mine
also was closed for 10 months in
1958, when the price of copper
was down. Anaconda’s only pri-
mary copper producer in Can-
ada, Britannia serves too as the
base for the company’s explora-
tion department in the country.

The mine and mill produce
some one and a half million
pounds of copper monthly-
worth $8 million a year. In the
past, the property has produced
some $330 million in mineral
wealth.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

April. 1965

THE NEW NATIONAL FLAG OF CANADA is raised for the first time over a Mine-Mill
hall in Sudbury, Ontario. “Those participating in the flag raising did not all agree on
its design, its color pattern, or the time wasted by politicians in debate," said the
Local 598 News, but noted, "They did agree that it is the symbol around which Cana-
dians will stand united in defense of their country, their sovereign rights, their

natural resources, and their efforts towards world brotherhood and peace."

Mine-Mill

in Sudbury is involved in an all—out campaign to regain bargaining rights at the

Inco properties.

Anti—HUAC Vote Largest
in Nearly Two Decades  

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Fifty-eight Congressmen voted on Feb.

25 to recommit to the House Administration Committee a measure
appropriating $370,000 to the House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee, calling for open hearings on the justification of the funds.

Another six members of the House were paired for the motion
to recommit, introduced by Don Edwards (D-Calif.). The total of
64 was the strongest display of anti-HUAC sentiment since it be-
came a standing committee of the House nearly two decades ago.

The record appropriation for the committee, pared from the
original $380,000 asked by HUAC by the Administration Commit-
tee, was approved by a 360 to 29 roll-call vote, but the important

vote was on Edwards’ motion
to recommit, turned down 58
to 333. .

Even HUAC’s Chairman Ed-
win E. Willis of‘ Louisiana indi-
cated the significance of the
latter vote when he said towards
the end of an hour’s debate on
the subject, “I suppose the pro-
ponents of the motion to recom-
mit feel that they might be
able to get more votes on this
motion than on a vote to abolish
the committee or to kill its ap-
propriations. I do hope, how-
ever, that the members of this
House will not fall for this. .

A vote for the motion to recom-

mit would play‘ right into the

hands of our real enemies . . .”
Votes in Past Years

Three Congressmen also were
paired against the appropria-
tion—making a total of 32. In
1963, 20 Congressmen voted
against the appropriation for
the committee, while only six
members of the House Voted to
cut HUAC’s funds in 1961.

While 24 Congressmen made
speeches’ or inserted speeches
in the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
ORD criticizing HUAC’s prac-
tices aud lack of legislative
proposals, the defense of the
committee was limited almost
exclusively to remarks by its
own members. Rep. Edwards
called HUAC’s existence “pat-
ently unconstitutional,” charg-
ing that its investigations are
carried on only for purposes
of exposure.

Broiler Could Cook Your Goose

The Cory Broilitizer Model C5 (Cory Corp., Chicago, $29.95)
is unsafe, warns Consumers Union. Although the broiler performs
effectively, it has a serious shock hazard, reported in the April
issue of CONSUMER REPORTS.

The heating element is an uninsulated open wire, strung zigzag
on a removable frame just half an inch below the grill.

True, there is a screened safety cover which actuates a switch
that shuts off power when the cover is opened. Thus the user is
prevented from touching the live element with a cooking utensil.

But when the broiler is disassembled for cleaning, the ﬂexible wire ,

of the heating element may be -bent enough in handling to touch
the metal grill after the parts, have been put together again. If
this happens, the contact could cause all metal parts, including
the safety cover, to become electrically live each time the broiler
is use .

Under these circumstances the element might burn out. Or,
more important, the user might suffer a severe, possibly ‘even a
lethal, electric shock. ’

1965 Curs—"|n-credibly Sloppy"

.’T

\.;J,

In its April issue,_ CONSUMER‘ REPORTS evaluates the prin- ‘

cipal 1965 U. S. automobiles, ranking them in order of estimated
overall quality as family transportation. ’

CU adds a special complaint about quality ‘control; not a single

one of the cars bought for test was delivered in fully satisfactory
condition. Almost all cars had improperly aimed headlights, and
most had malfunctioning directional signals. Some 27 additional
problems were found—-all of which should have been caught at the
factory. '
Z “No problems were found with the basic mechanisms of any of the
cars,” CU said. “They were simply incredibly sloppy.” Many of the
troubles, if not corrected, would have interfered with operating the
cars. In one car, for example, the steering column was loose at the
dashboard; in another the wiring harness was loose so that the
ignition and lights went out; in a third the choke stuck open when
the car was cold, so. that the car wouldn’t start.

What are the chances of having trouble with a new car, and of
getting the trouble properly corrected? For its answer, CU draws
on the experience of readers who bought 1963 and 1964 U. S. models.

Of 48,000 answering a questionnaire in June 1964, about a fourth
said the cars were not in satisfactory condition when delivered.
Those who got unsatisfactory cars were asked further-about the
repair work done under the warranty and close to one fifth said
they were not satisfied. In most of these cases the dealer had tried
to fix the car, but had not succeeded. I A

Inspection at the factory‘ should be much stricter, says CU.
And dealers might do better with repairs if the company made
more liberal allowances for such work.

Safety Standards for U. S. Cars

Cars bought by the federal government will, in the future, have
to meet a set of minimum safety standards. Standards recently pro-
posed by the General Services Administration are discussed in the
April issue of CONSUMER REPORTS by David Klein and William
Haddon, Jr., M.D.

These first standards are far from complete, the authors say.

One important omission is the failure to establish standards for

handling quality (quick and accurate maneuverability) and stabil-
ity (road holding ability when steered hard on "unfavorable sur-
faces). Although handling and stability involve complex problems,
these characteristics are sufficiently measurable to permit the es-
tablishment of standards.

Neverthless, the proposed GSA standards tackle known hazards,
and they are important not only because the federal government
buys some 60,000 cars a year, but because, once adopted, they will
probably be added to the motor vehicle regulations of a number of
states. At that point, manufacturers may find it convenient to use
some, at least, of the standards for their entire production run, so
that all consumers will get more protection than they do now.

Some of the features proposed by the General Services Admin-
istration are already available as optional equipment on some auto-
mobiles; these are features auto buyers may want to look for. The
standards (which could not gointo effect for a year or more at the
earliest) have requirements for:

Padded dash and visors.

Recessed instruments and controls on the instrument
panel. ‘
Impact-absorbing steering wheel and steering column.

Safety door latches and hinges.

Anchorage for seat belt assemblies.

Anchorage of seats.

Dual brake system.

Standard gear quadrant.

Safety glass.

Glare-reductionsurfaces on the instrument panel and
windshield wipers.

Tires and safety rims.

Exhaust emission control system to limit the amount of

Legislative Session in lltah
Provides Few Gains for labor

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah-——Although legislators here passed the
state’s first major bonding program to meet building needs in the
next five years, provided more state funds for schools and teachers’
salaries, enacted a couple of watered-downcivil rights measures,
and dealt with the question of Congressional and legislative reap-
portionment, the session which concluded in the middle of March
provided virtually nothing for labor in Utah.

Three bills that would have required registration of unions with
the state, regulated their contributions to political campaigns, and
placed other restrictions on them similar to those in the Landrum-
Griffith Act were killed in the sifting committee of the House, but,

‘Mine-Mill History

    A Founder of Local 392
Relates Fight for Recognition

(Editor’s note: On March ,5,
Vic Bohne was honored at a
party given by workers in the
electrical department at the
Kennecott mill in Arthur, Utah
—members of Mine-Mill Local
392. Bohne, a founder of the
local union, was retiring. He re-
ceived a severance allowance of
$3,335.34 from the company-
the latest in the long series of
gains achieved by the union in
the years since it achieved bar-
gaining rights with Kennecott in
Utah. According to international
staff representatives and local
union officials, Vic Bohne de-
serves more credit than any oth-
‘er man for the organization -of
Local 392 and for making the
company live up to the contracts
over’ the years.

Following is Vic Bohne’s ac-
count of the past 42 years——an
account presenting a brief his-
tory of Local 392-. . .)

I started work for Utah Cop-
per Co. the last time on May
3, 1923, working as jackhammer
man for six months and then as
a carpenter’s helper for a year.
It’s amusing to look back to
those days as a jackhammer

A man. I received utility pay,

which amounted to $3.75 for
eight hours. There was straight
timeefor overtime and it was
real work. '

After I was transferred to’,

carpenter’s helper, they bor-
rowed men to operate a cement
mixer. They were pouring the
ferrous-alloys balls at the foun--
dry. We had to work overtime,
but they couldn’t pay me time
and a half because I had been

,. loaned to the utility crew. Car-

penters and helpers got time and
a half . yet all I got was
‘straight time.

In 1930 the depression hit and

‘all the men who had much

seniority or were old in years
were laid off. Me . . . I was
only 30 and had no seniority. I
was kept on and hung on by a
narrow thread until both mills
started operating at full ca-
pacity. I was working about 10
days a month. ,

In the latter part of 1936 and
in 1937, I decided to see if I
couldn’t do something about the
way the company was operat-
ing without a union, and met

‘ withrsome people from Tooele

Local Union. In 1937, they had
applied for a charter which is
the charter under which Local
392 operates today.

Original Organizers
Shortly after an NLRB elec-
tion that we lost, we set up an
organizing committee. From the
beginning it was obvious that

' the company didn’t want a local

union with dues-paying mem-
bers. Following our loss in a
run-off election, we immediately
organized a local union. The
first persons to take part were
Bob Monger, Hank Peterson,
myself, Lube McKendrid, Ken

Reid, Dell Andersen, Julian.

Montoya, and others.

‘ At first, we met in Salt Lake
City so the company wouldn’t
have their stoolies watching.
We paid cash dues. Our first
meeting was held on April 17,
1939 and the first ten members

. were initiated. Those first meet-

ings were held every Tuesday
and‘out of. those times came
our present standard meeting
dates of the first and third
Tuesday of each month.

On about July 25, 1939, as fi-
nancial secretary, I turned in
to the company our first check-
off; At first they refused to hon-
or _it, but found out that it was
.a state law. Sothey started the
first dues check-off that Utah

' Copper‘ had ever‘ honored at the

‘ Arthur and Magna mills.

it seemed almost impossible to"

get more. After ‘a year and a
half or two years, we decided
to sign men on a slip to hold,
and one of the first men I con-
tacted was Penny Buckner, now
an international representative
in Utah. He signed.

Lots‘ of T hrea'l's

We were threatened with be-
ing fired, were given dirty jobs,
and were put off by ourselves.
Roy Hatch, the superintendent

of the Arthur mill, called my

foreman and told him to bring
me down to his office. About 3
p.m. one day in March, 1940,
A. W. McFarlane and I went
down to Hatch’s office, where
he accused me of all kinds of
things. “Vic,” he said, “you’d
better stick to your knitting or
the company will have to use
some drastic measures.”

Roy Hatch told me that I had

been turned ‘in for interfering

with the men’s work all over
the plant. McFarlane, my fore-
man, spoke up and said that
my work was being done satis-
factorily, and Hatch was forced
to agree. But he said that when
I was going and coming from
my work I. wasn’t supposed to
stop or say “hello” to anyone.
I told Hatch that if a man
stopped me and had some ques-
tions, I was going to answer
them. I’m not built any other
way.

For a while it was pretty
quiet after that. Eventually, we
got enough signers and the
NLRB sent a trial examiner in.
We had a hearing and there
were proceedings against an
which the
trial examiner found to be
company-dominated. Its abolish-
ment was ordered. We had a
board election and the union
came out on top.

Following the election, there
was a small curtailment in ton-
nage and the company decided
to clean the grizzlies at the car
dumper while the crusher was
running. The wood picker oper-
ator said it was too dangerous
and refused to go. They cut his
wages from operator to helper.
The helper refused and they
cut his pay too. The shift was
going to shut the mill down until
the matter was straightened out.

Meeting with Hatch

At 10 o’clock the following
morning, we met with Hatch,
who said he would meet with
any individual or group, but not
with anyone connected with any
union. I didn’t say anything un-
til we got inside. 9

After settling the matter of 3

the‘ grizzlies to our satisfaction’,
I said, “There’s another item,

fore,” he said, “that I won’t-
recognize anyone from any un-

certification papers in my pock-
et,” I said, “and I want those
men reinstated to their former
positions without loss of time
or pay.” The request was
granted.

From that time on, it's been
one obstacle after another. When
Taft-Hartley was passed in 1947,
the company thought there
would be a clause whereby they
could fire a man for his union
activities, but it didn’t material-
ize, so I’m still here.

_Got one ticket for closing a
door on a stool pigeon and an-
other time I lost three days’
pay because I wouldn’t do an-
other man’s work. That’s been

about all.

ASINGLEVMAN CAN HANDLE THE ENTIRE OPERATION of the new Anaconda Company concentrator in Butte, Mont.
A work crew consisting of one operator, plus a battery of computers handled from a pushbutton control panel,
processes 42,000 tons of concentrates a day. It controls conveying, dumping, grinding (by eight autogenous mills and
tour ball mills), separation, and storage. It also pumps wastes to the tailings pond and enables the concentrator
operator in Butte to control the flow of Water in the 26—mile pipeline between Butte and Anaconda, Mont.

Flexible Quota System Sought
Congressman Wayne Aspinall (D.-Colo.) and Senator Clinton
Anderson (D.-N.M.) have reintroduced their bill to set up a flex-
ible lead-zinc import quota system. They were joined by some 50

 other Congressmen and Senators. The major objective of the pro-

posed _legislation is to regulate the ﬂow of imports in terms of
the condition of the domestic industry. '

Even if all conflicting interests among U. S. mine and smelter
operators could be resolved by such a system, the proposal‘ has
already brought objection from foreign producers. Some of these
have already urged that the question of quota procedure should ‘be
put before the tariff meetings now going on in Geneva.

Cadmium Scarcity Eased; Price Down

Cadmium scarcity is easing after several years of tight sup-

0 plies. Producers’ inventories and imports have increased recently.
‘Government offers to sell cadmium helped some, though only a

small proportion of the total quantity was bought because the gov-
ernment cadmium wasn’t available in the most wanted shapes.
With the easing in the supply situation, U.S. producers cut cadmium
from $3.00 per pound to $2.65 early last month. This was the first
price change since December 1963. In that year cadmium’s price
rose five times from $1.70 to $3.00.

Copper Mine Development for Continental

Continental Copper and Steel Industries, Inc. last month an-
nounced two moves to produce a substantial amount of its own
copper for its fabricating plants in the U.S. Consolidated Halliwell,

; Ltd. of Canada, a Continental Copper and Steel subsidiary, Guggen-

heim Exploration Co., Reynolds Metals C0,, and Cerro Corp. an-

Japanese Smelters

A new Japanese company, Sumitomo ISP, has constructed an
Imperial process lead-zinc smelter which simultaneously produces
zinc and lead bullion from lead-zinc concentrates. The Japan Mining
Association says production costs will be reduced by 15 to 20 per-
cent.

A spokesman for Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company
says negotiations are at an advanced stage for joint construction
of a lead smelter in Japan by Cominco and Mitsubishi Metal Min-
ing Company. The smelter will cost between $4 million and $5 mil-
lion. Trade sources are quoted as saying the likely source of lead
concentrates for the new smelter will be Cominco’s new mine at .
Pine «Point, Northwest Territories. Cominco has also arranged to
have about 40,000 to 45,000 tons of high grade lead-zinc ore treated
for it this year at the Bunker Hill reduction plants in Idaho.

In a third Japanese development, Mitsui Mining and Smelting
Company is planning to build a lead and zinc smelter, but is de-
ferring forthree months a decision as to whether the Imperial .
smelting process will be used. Reason for the postponement is to
allow more time for prospecting work at the Huanzala mine in
Peru, which is expected to become the main source for the new
smelter. . . . _ ‘

Kennecott Precipitation Plant

Kennecott’s new precipitation plant at Bingham Canyon is ex-

it will increase precipitate output from the present 2,500 tons a
month to about 6,000 tons. Awarding of the construction contract
to Bechtel Corporation of San Francisco was announced in Feb-

Gold to Remain at $35 an Ounce

Recent excited trading in go-ld shares on world stock markets
died down when U. S. Treasury officials declared flatly that the
$35 per ounce gold price would not be changed. Although market
observers say that speculation in gold shares is possible again,
they do not anticipate any change in the outlook of U. S. gold
producers—among them American Smelting and Refining, Kenne-
cott, Phelps Dodge, U. S. Smelting, Refining and Mining, and
International Mining Corp.

The U. S. is the world’s fourth largest producer of gold, but
ranks far below South Africa, Russia, and Canada. One-third of
the total U. S. output is a byproduct of other metal processing.

Site for lmperial Smelter Debatecl

The proposal for development of an Imperial Process smelter
by the Area Redevelopment Administration, reportedhere in our
last issue, has Utah operators very interested. They are suggesting
that it be located in Utah, rather than in Colorado. The theory is
that since sulphuric acid is such a large byproduct of smelting, it
would be logical to locate the smelter near Utah’s big potash and
phosphate operations so that it would be convenient for the pro-
duction of fertilizers utilizating phosphate, potash, surfuric acid,
and nitrogen.

Standard Metals Corp., which announced last month that it
would build such a smelter, has still given no indication of where
they will locate it. ’

Lobbying Job for Bobby Baker?

Although Congress has just been assured that the critical coin
shortage is over as a result of speeded up U. S. mint activity,
proposals to change the silver content of U. S. coins are still being
considered. The vending machine industry objects; it says that a
change in the metallic content of coins would mean major recon-
version of the 4.5 million vendingmachines in use. These machines
use a metal sensing device, to separate coins by denomination,
reject damaged or foreign coins and slugs, and make change.‘

cy" Blamed in Blast Kilng 61

A recent coal mine disaster on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido claimed 61 lives and
injured more than a score of miners. The explosion at the Yubari mine was caused by the ignition
of methane gas. Five years ago, 42 men were killed in another blast at the same mine.

A major Japanese newspaper, Mainichi Shimbun said, “The production-first policy of the in-
dustry invited the disaster.” The paper noted that the explosion had occurred despite a warning
from the Japanese Bureau of Mine Safety just ten days before that methane gas had been detected

in the mine.

Police and the Bureau of Mine Safety launched investigations of the disaster, while the opposi-
tion Socialist party sent its own six-man team of investigators to the Yubari mine. The Japanese

Coal Miners Union issued a statement that the mine mana

explosion, and said it was con-
sidering a one-day nationwide

strike of the Japanese coal min-‘

ing industry.

"Two Other Explosions

Other recent major “foreign
coal mine disasters occurred at

the Uricani mine in Western .

Romania on Feb. .24 when 41
miners were killed and 16‘ in-
jured by an explosion, and at a
mine near Barcelona, Spain on
Feb. 20 when three miners were
killed and another seriously in-

jured in a fire-damp explosion.

only about four and one-half as
many accidents as Arizona,

is constantlypstriving to improve,

Well-Wishers

TUCSON, Ariz.——Maclovio. R.
Barraza has resumed his busy
schedule of union work at the
Mine-Mill ‘District 2 office.

Very seriously ill with en-
cephalitis in a Denver hospital
for three weeks in February,
Barraza, supposedly taking a
30-day leave for rest and re-
cuperation, was by early March
tending to union business from
his Tucson home. Frequent tel-
ephone calls to the international
headquarters to check with the
officers on District 2 matters
confirmed the fact that his .re-
cuperative period wasn’t limit-
ed to rest and relaxation.

Barraza andrhis wife Espe-
ranza express their thanks and

gratitude to the hundreds of ‘

per-sonsgwithin and outside the
union who showed their con-
cern for his health with letters,
cards and Wires. '

13,000 helpers (firemen) were
removed from locomotives under
the terms of a compulsory arbi-

has been an increase, of 619 more
persons killed or injured during»
the first six months we havehad

“ mine safety record, Charles Fer-

guson, director of the United

says: i “Preliminary figures, re-

number will increase because
some of the men who were in-
jured will doubtless die as a
result of such injuries.

“. . ..Roo_f falls continue to
be the major killer of mine
workers, w i t h transportation
running a close second.,This is
a clear indication that a large
part of the mining industry con-
tinues to do little or nothing to
abate these two major killers of 0

I men.

“The so-called small mines in
which 14 or fewer men are em-
ployed regularly underground
continue to account for a large‘
number of the fatalities. The
failure of Congress to pass legis-
lation covering this type of...oper-
ation has resulted in the need-
less killing and maimingof coal
miners. Our organization has
introduced legislation on this
problem in every session of
Congress since the passage of
the original Federal Coal Mine

Safety Act and has done so in

the present Congress.

“We hope that Congress will
now assume its responsibilities
and enact the legislation. Unless
this is done, they will be respon»

A sible for the continued killing of

men ‘who are forced by eco-
nomic necessity to work in sub-
standard operations.”
