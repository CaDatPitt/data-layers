three-quarter million houses is the kind of realism we must not
only strive for but attain.”

Such a program could employ 2,250,000 on-site workers and
4,000,000 off-site workers in the production of lumber, steel,
glass, concrete, brick, tile, paint and other building products.

But workers who need rehousing most are not the tenants

. . sought by private home builders who plan construction only

in the $25 to $30 a room per month bracket. To afford a

« $10,000 home or an $80 apartment, a tenant must earn about

$100 weekly. Yet in the so-called boom year of 1942, a little
over half of the American familieshad yearly incomes of less
than $2,000, or less than $40 a week. At that time, a break-
down of incomes and rent ranges showed that:

28 per cent of the American families occupying other than
farm houses were paying less than $15 a month.

35 per cent were paying between $15 and $30.

16 per cent were paying between $30 and $40.

Only the remaining 21 per cent were able to pay more than
$40.

The Journal of Commerce, a Wall Street paper, reported
last Fall that private builders believe “tenants must pay 65
per cent more rent to justify new building in New York City."
Under such terms, only 54,000 of the city's 1,725,000 families
will see the inside of new dwellings. Almost 97 per cent of
the city stands to be neglected.

Rents in the United States have risen steadily throughout
the years with new buildings serving only the top income

l WHY THE HOUSING SHORTAGE?

The housing shortage is no overnight development. There
has been a spectacular shortage of housing for generations,
 with acute crises in postwar pe-
riods. Addition of a half million
families each year and migration
of farm people to big cities during
the war have aggravated the situa-
, tion. The veterans’ plight merely
" serves to dramatize it. 9,
The home building industry
looks upon the shortage as a way
to make quick and thick money
in a “ﬂash” market. And after the
boom will come the bust. It hap-
pened before.
 A similar accumulated demand
 for homes existed after the last war.
C'°‘°d F°' ”‘° S"""“°' The boom started in 1919 and by
the end of the year prices rocketed 40 to 50 per cent above
1918 prices. As a result of neglecting mass need, housing pro- la
duction fell from 405,000 units in 1919 to 247,000 in 1920. '
Again in 1936, when the industry showed an upswing, high l
prices froze the market.
Economic Stabilizer Chester Bowles has already expressed
concern over another boom-and-bust cycle.
Look at the production ﬁgures of housing units provided
during the last 25 years and judge for yourself.

From 192 5 to 1933 building production dropped 90 per cent,
recovering only when the government needed homes for war
workers and military personnel. From 1920 to 1937, the in-
dustry averaged less than a half million units a year; at its
peak, it reached less than 1,000,000. '

Present needs demand one and three—quarter million units
per year for the next decade. Can the industry do it? Or,
we should ask, does it want to?

Government and industry spokesmen act as if they never
foresaw the danger signals despite warnings of the housing
shortage by many housing experts throughout the war. The

rapidly declining vacancy rate served as a warning, if any was '

needed. In January, 1941, a survey by the Real Estate Board of
New York showed an average vacancy rate of 8.6. By September,
1944, the ﬁgure dropped to one-third of one per cent. Today
it stands at the lowest in New York’s history——one-tenth of one
per cent. Only a handful of cold water ﬂats and Park Avenue
suites are currently available.

Part of the housing shortage is the result of a decline in
manufacture of housing materials during the war. However,
before the war the government started proceedings against

HOW MUCH DOES BAD HOUSING COST?

The human cost is incalculable. N0 adding ma-
chine has as yet been devised to compute national
cost of high infant mortality, crime, disease and
delinquency.

Some attempts, however, have been made to de-
termine costs in terms of taxes. The Boston City
Planning Board several years ago found that every
slum tenant cost the city $58 in taxes above revenue.
High rent areas and areas of mixed quality, on the
other hand, showed a net income per person of $190
and $25 respectively.

building materials manufacturers charged with monopolistic
practices. This involved manufacturers of glass, sheet metal,
lumber pile and numerous other materials. Associations of deal-
ers, rings of sub-contractors and even certain A. F. of L. craft
unions were charged with price ﬁxing, division of market and
customers. The largest corporations named in the suit which
was suspended during the war were Johns-Mansville and U. S.
Gypsum. There has been talk of reviving the case.

These same manufacturers were sitting tight after V-E and
V-_] Days, refusing to budge until O.P.A. boosted price ceil-
ings, and the government ended its allocations of materials
program. They have been shuttling their supplies through
the black market instead. ,

There has been a great clamor by builders and manufac-
turers about “uncertain” and “high” labor costs. No mention
is ever made of the fact that building and construction work-
ers, sold out by labor fakers of the Hutcheson stripe, never
received a full 15 per cent raise to which they were entitled
under the Little Steel Formula. Also that the labor shortage
in the industry is the result of miserably low wages.

O.P.A. has been forced to concede higher prices on building
materials. And War Mobilization Director Snyder erased
the allocation system known as L-41 which limited building
materials to comparatively, low-cost homes and essential build-
ing. The hasty removal of L-41 led to luxury construction
and greater diversion of building materials to black market
channels. The government’s action was contrary to the in-
terests of the veteran because all available materials were
grabbed for luxury construction, leaving him virtually aban-
doned. A survey made recently by Johns-Mansville Corp.,
Great Lakes Steel and Westinghouse showed that plants pro-
ducing scarce building materials were only operating at from
27 to 72 per cent capacity in an effort to break price ceilings.

In order to cover up this obvious concession to the proﬁt-
eers, the Civilian Production Administration announces that
if builders construct in the $10,000 ﬁeld only, price quotas
will be instituted." Again the government seems ready to act
after the horse has been stolen. ~

U. S. PUBLIC HEALTH RECORDS SHOW:

Death rates in families living in one room are
about 179 per cent higher than families living in
four rooms.

Death rate for children between one and ﬁve is
300 per cent higher in overcrowded homes.

‘ Home construction has deﬁnitely been stalled because of
builders’ opposition to O.P.A. ceilings on new homes. News-
paper real estate columns record this daily. Persistently ﬁght-
ing against rent curbs on old dwellings, the builders claim that
O.P.A.’s plan for new ceilings halt production. They are will-

A ing to hold back on construction as a blackjack to slug rent

curbs on new houses.

The price agency permits an increase of 20 per cent in rents
above current price ceilings in comparable housing. It esti-
mates that construction costs have risen 35 per cent over
prewar prices but that the difference is offset because taxes,
utilities and other ﬁxed charges have remained fairly stable.

Most outspoken against rent curbs on new construction are
the National Association of Real Estate Boards and the Pro-
ducers Council, an organization of building materials sup-
pliers. Both groups see red when the matter of public housing
is mentioned. They were behind a move in Congress to end all
ceilings before June 30, when the Price Control Act expires.

A serious curb to building is the rampant speculation now
going on in real estate prices. Since V-] Day, land has increased
from 16 to 18 per cent. It is going up at the rate of 3 per cent a
month. t

The accusing ﬁnger for the shortage has been pointed at
reactionary real estate groups and their spokesmen in Con-
gress by Nathan Straus, former administrator of the U. S.
Housing Administration. Strauscharges that real estate groups
have opposed all new housing which could offer competition to
their ancient and unsanitary slums.

PLANS, PLANS, PLANS—BUT STILL NO HOUSES!

There are plans aplenty. Temporary plans. ' Long-range
plans. Many incorporate both features. There's the Wyatt
plan, the O’Dwyer Committee plan, the Dewey plan, the
Straus plan, the Citizens Housing Council plan. Then there
are the American Labor Party and C.I.O. plans. The Wagner-
Ellender-Taft measure in Congress is a plan for long-range
public and private housing. Various city authorities also have
local plans which were interrupted by the war.

Thus far, all the plans put together have housed very few
veterans.

In order to make our way through the maze. of plans, we’ll
divide the problem into its temporary and permanent aspects,
although this is an artiﬁcial separation since those who need
temporary will also need permanent dwellings. And there
are those housing experts who claim there is no possible solu-
tion to the temporary aspect, that only a permanent housing
problem exists.

The most detailed temporary plan for veterans has been
offered by the O’Dwyer Emergency Committee on Housing.
This New York City plan calls for construction of 43,000 tem-
porary units. It anticipates that homes will be provided from
the rehabilitation of “old law” tenements, converting one and
two-family houses into multiple dwellings, O.P.A. adjustment
on summer houses for all year-round use, reconverted military
installations, Quonset huts, demountable houses, trailers and
other temporary types. Some of the latter types have been
provided by the Federal government in its distribution of
the available 100,000 units. The committee’s main reliance is
on Quonset huts, rehabilitated “old-law” houses and recon-
verted one and two-family homes.

This emphasis is opposed by the Citizens Housing Coun-
cil, an organization working for better housing with repre-
sentatives on its main body from real estate groups all the way
to tenant leagues. The Citizens Housing Council expresses

17

.f;;....., 

the view that rehabilitation of “old-law” tenements will only
tend to perpetuate slums, and that reconversionof one and
two-family homes into multiple dwellings will relax ﬁre and
health safeguards which took years to become law. It places
main emphasis on temporary type housing.

The housing committee of the. New York City C.I.O.
also maintains that rehabilitation and multiple conver-
sion will not provide all the temporary units hoped for
because landlords will ﬁnd it too expensive to make altera-
tions on a short-time proposition. It urges that the city reno-
vate the “old-1aw” tenements and acquire the land for future
low-rent projects.

A A serious omission in the temporary program of the O’Dwyer
Committee was the failure to call for the opening of boarded-
up homes, and commandeering of hotels and resorts as was
done during the war. The City C.I.O. and American Labor
Party have urged such action.

An increase in the New York City real estate tax which was
reduced during the past few years would create funds for slum

HEALTH AND HOUSING: NEWARK

The Newark Housing Authority over a two years
period studied the eﬁects of good housing on health
and municipal costs. It found substantial decreases
in disease, accidents, delinquency and ﬁres in three
new public projects compared with three city wards
of the same housing conditions that project dwellers
formerly faced.

Infant mortality in the projects was 16 per cent
lower.

Communicable disease was 28 per cent lower.

Fatal home accidents, 100 per cent lower. —

Fires were 73 per cent lower compared to the

- entire city. '

clearance and general improvement. The Communist Party
urges such action. Councilman Peter V. Cacchione has taken
the lead in demanding that property owners pay higher real
estate taxes in order to cover the cost of the city's rehabilitation
which, in effect, would enhance the value of their holdings.

After a great deal of publicity and plenty of public pressure,
Gov. Dewey came forward with his temporary plan. He is get-
ting several military installations‘ from the Federal govern-
ment free of charge. Magnanimously, he dips into his $500,-
000,000 state surplus fund and brings up $3 5,000,000 for con-

version of these installations. And though he has admitted A

that 269,000 families in New York will need housing by the
end of the year, his program provides a maximum of 25,000
to 35,000 units, most of them unsuitable for family living.
The rest of the veterans he throws to the mercy of private
builders. The rest of the surplus funds he will use to build his
political fences.

So much for temporary plans.

As for permanent dwellings, the O’Dwyer Committee pro-
poses 127,000 units to come from private construction, the pres-
ent schedule of public housing, semi-private redevelopment
projects by banks and insurance companies, additional public
projects made possible by the recent New York State referen-
dum for increased subsidies and the public projects made pos-
sible with the passage of the Wagner-Ellender-Taft measure.
The program also calls for full use of the $80,000,000 still avail-
able in the state treasury.

While this is all good and well, the committee failed to follow
the lead taken by the Communist and American Labor parties
and Democrats, to call for another $300,000,000 to $500,-
000,000 of state funds to be made available through the issu-
ance of bonds. Gov. Dewey also neglected to raise this point.
A referendum is needed to approve such a bond issue and that
takes time. Dewey’s failure to act means a delay for at least
another year in expanding the state’s public housing program.

Nathan Straus is of the opinion that temporary housing is a
waste of time and money. .Instead he advances a plan for
2,000,000 new homes made possible by Congressional subsidies

and grants. Straus, a former housing administrator, has asked
that the government have absolute priority on labor and ma-
terials and that it prohibit private building for a good part
of 1946 until public projects are under way. An alert Congress
could easily incorporate the best features of this plan into
present housing bills.

Tackling the problem of 500,000 substandard homes in New
York City the Citizens Housing Council projects a one per
cent sales tax for slum clearance. Mayor O’Dwyer"s two per
cent sales tax has scuttled the Council’s slum clearance via
sales tax. What appeared to be such a pat and pleasing way
to end the slums, especially to the bankers, just adds up to
another burden on those least able to pay as far as the Citizens
Housing Council plan is concerned.

The vast slum areas still remain to be cleared. Postwar
plans of the New York City Housing Authority call for 13
public projects for 18,000 persons. Another ﬁve projects will
be built as a result of the successful state subsidy referendum.
But most of these projects will not see the light until 1947 or

1948. The Wagner--Ellender-Taft bill which remains to be

passed (it’s like counting your chickens before they are hatched)
will provide 29,000 units in New York City. However, it will
face a stiff ﬁght from the real estate lobby. President Truman
in all his talks to the nation on housing has failed to mention

this measure. Real estate opposition to the bill may have
forced this concession from him. ‘

The Wagner-Taft-Ellender bill, by far the best proposal for
long-range housing and slum clearance, establishes the “goal
of a decent home in a suitable living environment for every
American family." The measure proposes a comprehensive

housing program designed for urban and non—urban dwellers, g

with recognition of the root causes of the nation's housing and
redevelopment problems. It sets up a permanent national
housing agency with a research staff to study plans, designs
and construction.

The bill provides annual contributions of $88,000,000 for
urban and $25,000,000 for rural public housing. A billion
dollar authorization is made to the Federal Housing ‘Adminis-
tration to effect yield insurance on rental housing to be con-
structed by private enterprise that would serve moderate in-
come groups. These funds would permit the construction of
approximately 990,000 homes for the entire nation. In addi-
tion, the Urban Redevelopment title of the bill makes avail-
able to local governments $250,000,000 loan funds and $20,-
000,000 in annual contributions for the acquisition of de-
teriorated sections of cities and their preparation for redevel—
opment by private enterprise. The Rural Housing title en-

_ ables the Secretary of Agriculture to obtain whatever loans

are necessary for housing at moderate rentals. These loans
would bear an interest rate of three per cent and would be
made available to farm owners or groups of farmers to provide
decent housing for them, their tenants, share-croppers, laborers
or seasonal workers. N0 estimate has as yet been made to
determine how many units would be stimulated by this pro-
vision. ’

The bill would also make about $67,000,000 yield insurance
available to families able to pay moderate rentals. Also served
by the bill are cooperatives or mutual ownership projects.
Trade unions are particularly interested in this type of project.

The bill liberalizes F.H.A. insurance, making it easier for
private home owners to meet their monthly payments on low-
priced homes.

2!

As good as the measure is, several important improvements
have been suggested. The New York City Housing Authority
has urged an increase in the size of the public housing pro-
gram which as outlined in the bill would only provide relief
for one-third of the acknowledged need among the lowest in-
come groups. The Authority has also asked permission to
build unsubsidized projects for families able to pay about $10
per room per month. This group belongs to what is commonly
called the “no-man’s land” of housing because their incomes
are too high for public projects and yet too low to attract
private builders.

Both the National Urban League and the national C.I.O.
call for the correction of Federal Housing Administration poli-

cies in the bill. The Urban League points out that the ad-

ministration creates a “discriminated housing market.” F.H.A.
property evaluators are told to guard against “adverse inﬂu-
ences." In the ofﬁcial language of the agency these influences
include “inharmonious racial groups.” Such a directive on
the part of a national agency runs counter to the democratic
principles and aspirations of» the people.

The Communist Party throughout its history has bitterly
opposed Jim Crow housing, as well as all other Jim Crow insti-
tutions. Every American regardless of color has the right to a
decent home in whatever portion of the city he chooses to live
in. Communists have fought countless community battles
against landlords trying to evict Negro tenants from so-called
white neighborhoods. Communist Councilman Benjamin J.
Davis, Jr., led a distinguished struggle against construction of
the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company project, Stuyvesant
Town, on a Jim Crow pattern. (More on this in the follow-
ing chapter.)

The Wagner-Ellender-Taft measure has also been criticized
because it fails to state explicitly that provisions of the bill
shall be made available solely on the basis of need and eco-
nomic qualiﬁcation regardless of race, color, religion or na-
tional origin. Unless this provision is inserted the entire meas-
ure is seriously weakened. V .

C.I.O. amendments tothe measure call for establishment of

a permanent national housing agency with an administrator
who has positive authority and responsibility to coordinate the
functions and policies of the constituent divisions. The bill as
it stands perpetuates the existing set up in which the various
divisions set their own policy.

Any housing measure eventually passed must include these
proposals. .

Discussion of public projects always brings wails of protests
from banking groups that “socialism” is overtaking the in-
dustry. Yet the U. S. Housing Act has been tested in the courts
and proved its usefulness. Under the leadership of the housing
agency, local housing authorities in the years 1938 to 1941 built
more than 170,000 homes which set new records in excellence
of design and economy of construction.

Although everyone agrees that slums are a blight, a cancer
eating into the hearts of our cities, every move to demolish
them is opposed by realty groups. Public housing has proved
a boon to low-income groups. And not until the people succeed
in winning an effective over-all program to build public and
private homes with government assistance, all talk of decent
housing for America is so much hogwash.

“NO NEGROES, JEWS OR ITALIANS ALLOWED”

For the Negro people the housing crisis has always existed.
It is one of the major problems of their urbanization. From the
clapboard shacks of the South, they
have moved to the more enlight-
ened cities of the North only to ﬁnd
themselves herded into ghettos.

If conditions for white veterans
are desperate, they are almost im-
possible to bear for the Negro. In
Harlem, largest Negro community
 in the world, families have been
 doubling up and even tripling up
 for many, many years in order to
9 pay the exorbitant rents demanded
by unscrupulous landlords who
. keep their property in a state of

— virtual decay.

The particular housing problem
faced by Negroes stems from the general racial restrictions on
land and property and the disproportionately low incomes they
receive as a group. These two factors result in:

An artiﬁcially restricted housing supply

Less housing value per dollar

Intensiﬁcation of overcrowding, blight and deterioration.

These conditions lay the basis for increased racial tensions
and explosions.

The 1940 Federal Census showed that 8%, out of every 10
non-white dwellings needed major repairs or had serious
plumbing deﬁciencies, as compared with 41/2 of every 10 white
dwellings. Twenty-ﬁve per cent of the urban units occupied
by non-whites were overcrowded, as against 8 per cent among
whites. The census further revealed, and this is generally
known without census conﬁrmation, that Negroes paying the

24

 

7)W‘.V -«-;»».~:u<'..~: ‘?B:~«f‘.<ﬁ':r.‘ -w:s~ i-.,‘,;,¢.M«. V

same as whites for housing receive in each rental group a higher
percentage of the substandard type.

The federal census on incomes showed‘ that 85 per cent of
the non-white groups has annual incomes below $1,000 as
compared with 54 per cent of the white group. Because of low
income, the housing needs of Negroes were so acute that this
minority, representing one-tenth of the population, absorbed
more than a third of the low-rent housing projects produced
before the war. Full employment and fair employment prac-
tices are mandatory to improve the lot of all the people,
especially the Negroes. Unless Negroes are assured jobs in line
with their ability and given the opportunity to learn new
skills, they will continue to constitute the largest single group
eligible for public housing. And while public housing has
proved a boon to low incomes families, the Negro people do
not want a monopoly ironically caused by their poverty, on
public housing.

A statement of the National Urban League read at a hearing
of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency on the
Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill, pointed out:

“Racial restrictive practices, including covenants and neigh-

THE CRIME OF SEGREGATION

In Baltimore, Negroes comprise 20 per cent of the
population and are crammed into two per cent of
the residential area.

In Chicago, 250,000 Negroes live in units built to
house 150,000. The second and third wards of Chi-
cago have a density of 90,000 per square mile, com-
parable to the density in Calcutta, India.

In West Harlem, a section making up one-sixteenth
of the total Manhattan area, more than one-tenth of
the borough’s total population is housed. On one
Harlem block exists a population of 3,871, considered
the highest population density in the world.

25

 

borhood agreements, artiﬁcially limiting the land and housing
accomodations to Negroes were the root cause of the distinctive
housing problem that Negroes face.”

' The Urban League severely criticized the Federal Housing
Administration which “recommends, and in effect, requires

V racial restrictive covenants on properties it insures.”

Negroes are bitterly aware of the undemocratic practice
which bars them from certain areas. Only after higher-income
group sections have deteriorated and become slums, are Ne-
groes permitted in. This practice also applies to Jews, Italians
and other minorities but not to the same degree.

The ﬁght against restricted covenants has been conducted
for many years by Negroes as well as whites. A signiﬁcant vic-
tory was scored when Communist Councilman Benjamin
J. Davis, Jr., and Stanley M. Isaacs, of the New York City Coun-

cil, succeeded in getting their bill, which prohibits segregation

in city-aided projects, passed. The ﬁght centered around the
Stuyvesant project of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Com-
pany. The law forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color
or creed in any project to which the city grants certain tax-
exempt privileges. But the law was passed after an agreement
to make Stuyvesant Town a Jim Crow blot in the heart of the
city was already a fact. However, no bank or insurance com-
pany engaged in building projects will, hereafter, be able to
erect another walled town in New York. —

The state’s Redevelopment Companies Law still remains
to be amended along similar lines. Assemblyman Hulan Jack
has authored several bills to bar bias in state-aided projects.
Other measures to end discrimination iniall private housing
have been suggested. A hard ﬁght remains to achieve this.

It can be done. In Los Angeles, a Superior Court Judge
recently made a historic decision when he voided a realty
covenant barring Negroes; He said, “It is high time members
of the Negro race were accorded, without reservation and
evasions, the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th"
Amendment of the Federal Constitution.”

A Canadian judge also set the democratic pace for all
countries with discriminatory practices by ruling ‘against a

DEATH RATE IN HARLEM

The infant mortality rate in Harlem is higher than
in any other part of the city. The city-wide rate for
Negroes exceedsany other racial group: whites——67
deaths per 1,000 births; Negroes—98 per 1,000.

The annual death rate from tuberculosis, the dis-
ease of the slums, -is 40 per 100,000 whites, and 225
for the American Negro. The exceedingly high TB

These examples show that bias in housing can be ended.
A people’s ﬁght by the Negro people with their al1ies—white
progressives and trade unionists—will insure victory. The
Communist Party has roused the conscience of America
against injustice to Negroes many times. It has sparked broad
people's movements ﬁghting for equality for all minorities. It
will continue to ﬁght until that day when white and Negro
live side by side in peace and security.

HOME IS MORE THAN A HAT RACK

More and more people are discarding the outworn idea that
home is where you hang your hat. While hat racks are not
out of place there, housing experts are beginning to think
of homes as part of community development where young
and old spend their time working, playing and living con-
structively.

The newest in housing plans calls for over-all projects with
well-built and well—placed schools, parks, shopping centers,
markets, movies, churches, youth centers, nurseries, club
rooms and transit facilities. The blueprints are paper Utopias.

But those who know what makes our economy tick, know
there's a long upward climb to achieve this dream.

There are many who remember what Frederich Engels,
one of the founders, together with Karl Marx, of modern,
scientiﬁc Socialism, wrote: “In such a society the housing
shortage is no accident; it is a necessary institution and it
can be abolished together with all its effects on health, etc. . . .
only if the whole social order from which it springs is funda-
mentally refashioned.”

The housing problem today calls for drastic action. The

children of the men who fought the great battle for democracy
cannot wait. They cannot wait the hundred years it would
take to clear the slums if the present snail’s pace of slum
clearance were maintained. Private enterprise has shown it is
incapable of bold, large-scale programs.

Take‘ the case of New York City. There are currently three
methods of ﬁnancing housing.

The ﬁrst is the historic way, leaving it to private investors
to do it alone. With present methods, standards and costs
such ﬁnancing can provide New York City with houses for
only those families able to pay $25 to $30 per room per month
which means just about 5 per cent of the population.

Under the second method, federal funds—and in New York
City, state and city funds—are loaned to the Housing Authority
for slum clearance and building of housing developments, with
private enterprise doing the construction job. This method
provides housing at rentals of $6 to $8 per room per month.

A third and relatively new way is government and private
enterprise partnership. Through the use of indirect forms
of government aid, a limited return to the investor is per-
mitted. Rentals for this type, known as redevelopment projects,
range from $12 to $15 per room per month. This type is built
by banks and insurance companies.

Completely neglected by all three methods is the group
that pays from $8 to $12 per room per month.

As far as immediate need is concerned, private construction
with its high rent terms is entirely out of the question for
the mass of the people. As for the redevelopment projects,
only a handful are being planned. Thus, the major burden
for rehousing the bulk of the people falls to public housing-
public housing that must cover rental brackets of from $7
to $10 or $12.

The irrefutable facts remain:

Sixteen million homes are needed within the next ten years
for 65,000,000 men, women and children who live insub-

_ standard, indecent homes.

Eighty per cent of the people cannotipay more than $40
monthly rentals. .

AMERICA’S HOUSING
CRISIS

By Louise Mitchell
HOME, SWEET HOME—-IF YOU CAN GET IT!

Two hundred veterans for one apartment!
That was the score on January 14, 1946, when a small “for
rent” ad appeared in the New York
Times for a $42.50 one-room apart-
ment. The agent of the Whitney
estate, owner of the house at 6
 Bank Street, New York City, said,
 “I wouldn’t have placed the ad had
_/w I known this would happen.”
Two hundred veterans and their
wives came hours before the speci-
ﬁed time, and jammed their way
tight into the narrow hallway from
the ground to the ﬁfth ﬂoor. The
:_: old renovated house with its doll-
,1 size, musty-smelling ﬂats shook to
 its weather-beaten frame.
Weary of-the hopeless hunt for
a place to call their own, unnerved by the emotional strains
of living “doubled-up” with relatives and friends, these vet-
erans staged a spontaneous demonstration demanding the city
open its boarded-up homes. A committee was formed on the
spot to meet with Mayor O’Dwyer for housing relief for ex-
servicemen.
One of the men, a former infantry lieutenant, told the
throng, "During the war, the government took over hotels and

The time is long past for half-way measures. The full crisis
is upon the nation. Despite all the plans, there is little in
the offing which shows coordinated federal, state and local
action for wide-scale, long—range housing. The real estate lobby
working through Congress is blocking all attempts to ease
the crisis. The government must immediately release all
building materials held. by the Army, Navy and Maritime
Commission and halt the destruction of overseas materials.
In the United States building materials are being held on to
for no other reason than not to “upset” the market. The
government has too long operated on the principle that it is
better to have a shortage in building materials than to offer

competition to private manufacturers.

Even if manufacturers of building materials were to go
ahead with full scale production, government aid is needed
to increase their productive capacity. Here again private
enterprise cannot go it alone. Stimulation of greater produc-
tion levels for building materials is the aim of the Mitchell-
Kilgore bill. Its passage or similar legislation is needed to
put life into the plans.

Most essential of all is the renewal of the Price Control Act
for the maintenance of rent control. America knows the mean-
ing of inﬂation. It dare not yield an inch in the ﬁght against
the proﬁteers who would break controls.

Despite their outcries, landlords in 1944 made $12,800,-
ooo,ooo, the highest rental income in history. Their net oper-
ating income rose 30 per cent since 1939. And what is more,
81 per cent of America wants rent control continued.

The people through their trade ‘unions, mass organizations
and community groups have their work cut out for them
in pressing Congress to pass the Wagner-Ellender-Taft meas-
ure.

Tenant groups are essential in order to ﬁght for continued
rent control and new and improved housing. Public education

on housing is of extreme importance and can only be carried -

out effectively by tenant, community and union groups. The
people back home who don't mean to live in ﬁre—traps and

slums all their lives have a job ‘to do on city, state and

federal authorities.

The housing problem is one of the broad peop1e’s struggles '

in which the Communist Party plays an important role. The
ﬁght for better housing is a knot to tie a community together.
Neighbors and friends must be rallied on this issue. Whether
it be a small matter like writing a letter on behalf of the
tenants when the landlord fails to provide adequate service,
or organizing a delegation to see a Congressman, ‘legislator
or city oﬂicial, Communists will always be found in the front
lines. ‘Communists, with their vision of the present and future,
are contributing to the ﬁght for the improvement of the

nation's living quarters.
=l= ~35 II

t “The House I Live In” has become more than a song about

democracy. The men and women who built the ships -and
planes and cannons in record numbers have a mind to add
a few timely words to the title: “The House_I Live In Has to

Become a Better One.” The veterans’ version is, “Give Me

a Home.” . _
These are among today’s themesongs.

resorts. It built housing fast. Why can’t the same be done now?
The emergency still exists.”

Another said, we veterans should try to get loans through the
G.I. Bill of Rights, buy an apartment house and turn it into
a cooperative for homeless veterans. His wife added, the
Schwab mansion on Riverside Drive has enough rooms to ac-
comodate 85 veterans’ families. But it still remains closed
after 10 years.

Every day the newspapers run stories of veterans who plead,
“Give me anything that has ‘four walls.” Then there’s the
shameful story of a veteran's family forced to live in a railroad
station for a week, and later removed to a prison celluntil
some private citizen offered his home. The veteran who
couldn't ﬁnd a home spent a night in a cell, not because of any
crime he had committed, but because of a crime committed
against him and his family.

The Oflice of Price Administration reports that $100 and
$200 bonuses are being demanded of veterans by agents and
landlords. Fabulous sums up to $1,000 are asked for old fur-
niture as a way of dodging rent controls.

The clerk at the Housing Division of the Oﬂicers Service
Club at the Hotel Commodore in New York told home seek-
ers, “You can come here every day, every week, call ﬁve times
a day. The situation is hopeless.”

The veterans’ plight was dramatized last Christmas when
ex-servicemen staged a pup-tent demonstration on a busy
Bronx thoroughfare. Collecting signatures to be sent to
Gov. Dewey, their petitions demanded less double-talk and

BELIEVE IT OR NOT! _ NEW YORK

In this world metropolis there are still over a

lack baths.

 

 

 

more action. Their banners read: “Welcome Home, No
Vacancies”——“Is This Our Choice—Pup-Tent or Igloo?”—“A
House to Live In, That's America to Me.”

Countless such instances are taking place throughout the
country. In university towns to which former GI’s are ﬂock-
ing in order to take advantage of the GI Bill of Rights the

' situation is especially critical. The men who know what it
means to be lonely and uncomfortable in a foxhole are warn- ,
. ing cosily-homed public officials that their patience is running

low, that they are tired of being kicked around.

As though there wasn’t enough salt in their wounds, vet-
erans are told to be consoled by the thought that before things
get better they will get far worse. Three million families
are without homes of their own today. By the end of the
year, further demobilization. and demands for homes by newly-
wed veterans will bring the total closer to 6,000,000. In New
York City alone, 1o,ooo veterans applied within two weeks
for the 1,*'oo dwelling units provided under the much-bally-
hooed Dewey housing p-rogram.

To date, only 100,000 units of war housing have -been made
available by the federal government for veterans’ temporary
housing, with most of the larger cities and smaller ones apply-
ing for units. But in the state of Texas alone, numerous locali-
ties have applied for more than the entire 100,000.

The Truman Administration has been slow in helping vet-
erans who have ﬁnally realized that government intervention
in building is imperative if the crisis is to be met according
to a Fortune magazine poll.

As for permanent housing:

Various high~priced schemes were offered from time to time
in the hope that somehow the Administration would muddle
through the crisis. Truman's main reliance has been on priv-

' ate enterprise. But home builders have been sitting ‘tight.

and refusing to budge until exorbitant proﬁts were on the
line. Industry's failure to act and the pressure of public anger
over the veterans’ plight ﬁnally forced Wilson Wyatt, housing
expeditor, to come forward with a program calling for 2,700,000
homes by 1948, in which private builders get ﬁnancial,

priorities and allocations assistance £rom the government.
Nothing in the plan touches on the nation's over-all housing
problem. It corrects previous Administration errors on the
housing front but falls far short of the goal set by Truman
himself-—5,ooo,ooo homes needed at once. The reactionary bloc
in Congress (at this writing) is cutting this plan to pieces.

Federal subsidies will be paid (if Congress will grant them)
to manufacturers of building materials in an effort to
spur production. Producers of building materials will also
be aided by the government, as will new ﬁrms producing parts
or completed homes. The plan calls for the recruitment and
training of 1,500,000 new building materials and building
trades workers. State and municipal governments are called
upon to assist the federal government to keep non—essential
building from eating up scarce materials. Previous Truman
plans gave the green signal to non—essential building at the ex-
pense of necessary construction.

Reactionary Congressmen speaking for real estate groups are

 asking that the price of the Truman proposal be the removal
of rent controls on all housing. Such a price would further

unhinge our postwar economy, open the ﬂoodgates of inﬂa-
tion and be a death blow to effective housing relief. Even.

while the program was being proposed, Congress acted to kill
price ceilings on the sale of old buildings.

This move only

encourages further inﬂation in‘ real estate transactions.

The present Truman plan is a vast improvement over others
which called for construction of homes for veterans up to
$10,000 and apartment units up to $80. Wyatt’s plan calls
for $6,000 homes and $50 apartments. Builders of conven-
tional homes, however, maintain they are unable to build for
less than $10,000.

The success of the plan depends on Congress and judging
from its present mood little will come of it unless the peo-
ple back home put up a ﬁght and get the Administration,
which is long on words but short on deeds when it comes to so-
cial legislation, to talk back to proﬁteers.

While all sorts of plans are proposed for veterans, none
have considered his economic ability to pay rent. We hear
talk of $5,000 homes, $10,000 homes, $50 apartments and $80
apartments but the veterans have a clear idea of what they can
afford.

A survey at various Army discharge centers showed that from
24 to 46 per cent of the servicemen ﬁgured they couldn’t

, afford to pay more than $30 a month when they left the ser-

vice; not more than 35 per cent could pay over $40. Only six

per cent expected to top $50. 5
This country is not without precedent in extensive and

rapid construction. During 1943, the Federal Public Housing

5 Authority made available 377,200 units for war workers. One

thousand units were ﬁnished daily. This was achieved while
the government was involved in vast construction of war plants,
Army camps, etc. This is what happened when the govern-
ment didn't depend on “the initiative” of private industry.
The American Institute of Architects has estimated that $16,-
000,000,000 was spent annually during the peak of wartime
construction. Such magnitude of operation must now be con-
tinued, if veterans as well as the millions of citizens living in
substandard homes are to be aided.

THE HOUSE WE LIVE IN

It is nine years since the late President Roosevelt said: “I see
one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-fed and ill-clothed. . . .”

- ~ What has happened since then?
Our people have been spared war’s
devastations, but greed has brought
almost half the country’s homes to
the brink of dilapidation. There
is press publicity aplenty from priv-
ate builders about postwar “dream
homes” with electric kitchens, ceil-
ing and ﬂoor heating systems, magic
dust absorbers and dozens of other
push-button wonders. ‘

But the stubborn facts remain:

Sixteen million families or about
65 million men, women and chil-
dren live in homes which the gov-
ernment deems indecent, far below
standard for minimum health and safety requirements. Fed-
eral Housing Census of 1940 found in urban, that is, densely
populated city centers:

11 million homes without running water.

15 million without private toilets.

17 million without private baths.

7 million in need of major repairs.

3 million seriously overcrowded.

And many have not one but several of the above-listed de-
fects.

Seven million city dwellings need immediate replacement.

On the rural side, the census found:

82 per cent lack toilets.

 per cent need major repairs.

16 per cent are overcrowded.

14 per cent have no water within 50 feet.

INFANT MORTALITY AND SLUMS: DETROIT

Infant mortality is six times greater in slum areas
than in well-oﬁ neighborhoods; the TB rate is 101/;
times greater; criminals are 15 times more numerous.

 

Housing conditions have deteriorated seriously since 1940
because of the almost complete cessation of repairs and im-
provements during the war. Were another census taken today,
far more shocking conditions would be disclosed.

Estimates of the National Housing Agency on homes needed
within the next ten years range between 12,600,000 and 16,-
000,000. This ﬁgure includes replacement of 7,000,000 units
recognized as substandard as far back as six years ago. Yet the
housing agency warns that not more than 12,000,000 can be
expected to be built by 1955. It p-laces main reliance for con-
struction on private builders. At no time in the nation's
history have builders constructed as many as 1,250,000 units
in one year, the rate projected by the National Housing
Agency. Private builders have never been concerned with re-
housing America. They are only attracted to high priced
dwellings where they can make the greatest proﬁt. One has
only to study the total number of homes planned for this year
to understand this. Only some 400,000 units were anticipated
before the Truman proposal was made. Whether his goal
of 1,500,000 in 1946 will be fulﬁlled is doubtful.

The C.I.O. maintains that the full 16 million housing units
can and must be built by 1955. This is not only imperative
for reasons of health and social well-being, claims the C.I.O.,
but necessary in order to achieve the goal of full employment.

R. J. Thomas, vice—president of the Auto Workers Union and
chairman of the National C.I.Q. Housing Committee, has said,
“If we are to solve the twin problem of housing and employ-
ment for our returning veterans and our unemployed war
production workers, an annual production goal of one and
