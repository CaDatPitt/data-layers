Under the conditions of capitalism and the abolition of slavery since
1865, the Negro has become a composite whole - that is, a nation - and are no
longer just a transplanted agrarian people living under conditions of slavery or
semifeudal plantation system. Obviously, the Negro people would have reached a
higher level of maturity as a nation, had their growth not been partially stunted
by the extreme rigors and double oppression of the Jim Crow system which served
to blunt and smother their consciousness of nationhood. No one can speak of the
full freedom of the Negro people in the Black Belt of the South unless willing to
remove all obstacles to their full, conscious growth as a nation, leading to their
own self-government......
(The Path of Negro Liberation, l9#7, pp.8—lO)

The Negro people are a relatively young nation, in formation only during
the last 80 years. They have not yet reached the point of political maturity
where they recognize and accept the concept of nationhood and fight for the slogan
of self—determination. Nations must pass through a period of growth and matura-
tion.

Not even our own American working class has reached full political matur-
ity. It took the American nation a much greater period to arrive at maturity
and nationhood sufficient to fight for and win the right of self-determination
from the British Crown. Some of the Latin American nations had great difficulty
in acquiring national consciousness, and other attributes of nationhood. But many
have matured into national consciousness. The Negro people in the United States
are now in the process of acquiring such national consciousness.

The main difficulties which have tended to retard the developing nation-
al consciousness of the Negro people are:

l. The capitalists have skillfully used the concept of race to justify
their oppression on the grounds that the Negro people are a biologically inferior
race. This is the substance of the so-called theory of "white supremacy," which
is the ideological basis for the whole system of Jim Crow and national oppression
of the Negro people. Because of certain so-called racially physical character-
istics in the overwhelming majority of cases, it has been easy to single out the
Negroes for special oppression. This has been used by the bourgeoisie to lend a
sort of diabolical plausibility to their lying protestations of the Negro*s in-
feriority. This has compelled the Negro people to fight intensely against this
myth of racial inferiority and the segregationism that accompanies it. In conse-
quence this makes them highly suspicious about any proposals, even those of na-
tional self-determination, that would set them apart from the white population.
Preoccupation with this question of racial discrimination tends to obscure the
more basic conception of their status as a nation. But it would be a major error
to underestimate the large role that the concept of race and physical character-
istics plays in the intensification of anti-Negro oppression.

2. A second ideological barrier to the development of national conscious-
ness among the Negro people is the general question of American democratic tradi-
tions. Negroes rightly feel themselves to be Americans and are justly proud of
their countryls democratic traditions. They take great pride in the contributions
they have made to develop these traditions. Their attitude toward discrimination
is that they want this cancer eliminated from the country in order that they can
more fully realize their birthright as full-fledged American citizens. Thus as
a young and developing nation, they do not yet see themselves as a nation within

-6-

the broad American nation. They are inclined to think of themselves as an op-
pressed minority section of the American people, even though they recognize the
specially vicious character of that oppression.

3. Situated literally in the bosom of the largest and most powerful
capitalist nation in the world, it is difficult for the Negro people, the most
impoverished and defenseless section of the population, to picture themselves
taking a stand as a nation, and as demanding the right of self-determination.

4. The ideological barrage which the bourgeoisie has laid down against
the concept of self-determination is creating confusion and distortions calcula-
ted to conceal its self-governing, land—owning features and other fundamentally
progressive features.

~ Despite the fact that the Negro people have not reached fully mature
recognition of its nationhood, of demanding self-determination, their general
orientation is clearly in the direction of achieving consciousness of nationhood.
 (Ibid. pp.12-13)

The Negro people are developing their national culture and national
consciousness. The culture of Negro people which has already profoundly affected
American culture in general is showing tremendous vitality. The latest period
on Broadway has been marked by the vitality of numerous plays involving Negro
themes and artists on an unprecedentedly high level, thus counteracting to a
marked degree decadent trends in the legitimate theatre. In the field of art,
music and literature, Negro culture leaves its specific imprint.

An indication of the developing national consciousness of the Negro
people is the way they consider themselves more and more as the "Negro people"
rather than as the Negro "race." Reputable scientists and anthropologists in
America and the world over have dealt irreparable blows to the so-called theory
of "race inferiority," and with this the whole myth of "purity of race" has de-
clined. Although there are many different designations current among Negroes,
the concept of "people" is beginning to be the one most generally accepted. It
is interesting that the Chicago Defender,major national Negro weekly, which first
popularized the concept of "race-man," is today one of the principal spokesmen
of the collaboration of the Negroes as a people with labor and white progressive
forces. The developing maturity of the Negroes, plus the well-established in-
fluence of the Communists among the Negro people, have played no small role in
helping to promote this higher concept.

 

A considerable sense of solidarity with the colonial peoples has grown
among the Negro people now fighting for liberation — and not just with Africa and
the west Indies, which is keenly uppermost in their minds, but also with India,
the people of China and the Pacific as well as with the people of Latin America
and other colonial and semi-colonial countries.......

(Ibid. pp.l7-18)

Then I went into the question of self-determination, and I said on this
question that the principle of self-determination is a principle which was not
at all originally a Marxist-Leninist discovery. The principle of self-determina-
tion for nations had existed for many, many years, and President Wilson had used
it as one of his lﬂ points in world War I, and it is nothing more than the right
of a nation to determine its own independence and destiny.

I said that in the deep South, in the Black Belt area, where the Negro
people constituted a majority,our Party raised the slogan of the right of the
Negro people in the Black Belt area to determine their own destiny, to exercise
the right of self-determination; that our Party raised that slogan because the

-7-

Negro people, having lived in that area for 300 years, had all the attributes

of nationhood; that the question of regarding the Negro people as a nation was
co-extensive with realizing the full dignity of the Negro people as a people,
and that they had so regarded themselves and spoken of themselves in many his-
toric documents which I mentioned to the National Committee meeting. I said that
the Negro people in this area, who wanted freedom, who wanted to own the land in
that area, who wanted equality and democratic rights and their full citizenship
under our Constitution, that the Negro people had for over 300 years had an ex-
perience that no one would guarantee their having those rights. The best guaran-
tee for the Negro people in that area having those rights was that they should
be able to determine their own destiny and enforce these rights themselves.

Now I also pointed out however that this could not be achieved unless
the Negro people had allies. First, that they themselves should consciously
believe in this position, and also that the Negro people would have allies, and
their first allies would be the labor movement in the country. other allies
would come from the poor white farmers in the South who to a more or less degree
also suffer oppression by the landlords.

So this could not be achieved except upon the basis of the Negro people
and their allies understanding this particular point and working together against
a common class - upper class foe.

We did not advance the slogan of self-determination as a slogan for
immediate realization; and that at other periods in the Partyis discussion
there got abroad ideas that we did and those ideas were incorrect.

Secondly, we were not advancing the theory that there should be a separ-
ate black republic of the Negro people in the Deep South; that this also was
alien to what we were advocating and to what I was recommending.

I said on the contrary that no one could exercise the right of self-
determination except the Negro people themselves; that that is all we advocated
and that it was up to the Negro people themselves in conjunction with their
allies and supporters to decide just what their relation would be to the state
government or to the federal government or in whatever way they wished to estab-
lish their destiny or fulfill their destiny.

That the Negro people were Americans, that they are proud of their
American citizenship, that they wish not only its responsibilities but they wish
also its privileges, and that what they would do certainly to decide their des-
tiny would be determined by their views at the time that the moment arrived when
they would have the opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination.

The Court: I donlt quite understand what that means yet. I wish you
would explain that to me again, this right of self-determination. Of course
you are explaining what your report was there......

(Continuing) Then I pointed out that the whole question of self—deter—
mination was one which was not an immediate slogan of action. Our immediate
fight for the rights of the Negro people was for their free and equal citizenship,
that is, free and equal in the sense that they would have equality without se-
gregation, without discrimination, without Jim Crow, to their free and equal ex-
ercise of their constitutional rights on the same plane and in the same way as
other citizens, and that that was our immediate-immediate objective.

Then I said that we were therefore avoiding errors that had been pre-
viously made and that these errors I thought should be pointed out there; that
our National Committee should adopt a resolution based upon the discussion and

-8-

gy-

my report, and I said that I considered this report which I gave as the substance
of a Marxist-Leninist view on the Negro question as a national question in this

country.

I remarked to them that Marx had said in Capital - that labor in a white
skin can never be free while labor in a black skin is branded, and therefore this
question of fighting for the equality of the Negro people was a matter of very
deep self-interest to the white workers and to our whole country.

well, this about summarizes the report......
(In Defense of Negro Rights, 1949, pp.39-H2)

ON THE NEGRO LIBERATION MOVEMENT

   

The Negro people are a decisive ally of the American working class,and
their militant struggles against Jim Crow reaction and for national liberation
constitute an anti-imperialist potential that labor has not yet fully seen in
all its dynamic magnitude.

Uppermost today in the minds of the Negroes - as a people - is the de-
sire for unity in their own ranks around a militant program to defeat the pre-
sent anti-Negro campaign, and to move to the counter-offensive for full citizen-

Sh:-potooo

This drive against the Negro people is just as reactionary and "bi-par-
tisan" as the Administration's foreign policy. In fact it is a domestic aspect
of that policy.....

More than 50 lynchings have taken place since V-J Day, in open defiance
of the United States Constitution, without a single conviction. There is no way
of ascertaining how many concealed lynchings have taken place. In the North,
unprovoked police brutality against Negroes, women as well as men, has reached
alarming proportions; and it is directed against the fraternal association that
is incident to Negro-white labor unity. Efforts of the Negro people in the
South to vote are invariably met by K.K.K. cross burnings, floggings, and out-
right murder. A special, organized campaign of poll-tax officials has sought
to intimidate Negro veterans, depriving them even of the right to apply for ter-
minal leave pay. The civil liberties of the Negro people are under attack all
over the country, and these attacks receive immunity from, if they are not in-
cited by, federal and state authorities......

Such is a birdis-eye view of how the wall Street-Southern Bourbon com-
bine ruthlessly pursues the Negro people. while lynch terror and violent re-
pression is the main characteristic of its campaign, reaction does not hesitate
to use bribery, demagogy, cajolery, and empty, cheap gestures to accomplish its
evi1 ends.....

can an effective united people's movement (against this offensive) be
developed among the 15 million Negro Americans? It can - but only by gathering
together the broadest forces among the Negro people, from top to bottom, and
from the conservative to the Left wing. The key to this urgent task is the role
of Negro labor, which, while fighting for the interests of the most exploited
sections of the Negro people, must simultaneously fight for the equal rights of
the Negro people as a whole.

Here it must be noted that the Negro people are a progressive and or-
ganized people. Their principal and most influential organization is the N.A.A.
C.P., which has over half a million members. But they are also organized in

-9-

their churches, business associations, lodges, women's organizations, college
fraternities and professional societies, in trade unions and youth groups, and
in many other ways. In every Negro community various peopleis organizations
exist, most of them concerned with the struggle against discrimination.

But while the Negro people are organized they are not functionally
united, nor do they move in unison - thus making it impossible for them to
wield their full political, social, and economic strength - although this is
their main desire. The main potential basis for establishing such unity on a
national scale lies in the common thinking of the Negro people around such uni-
fying issues as F. E. P. C. and Jobs, and anti-poll tax and anti-lynch legisla-
tion.

Often, however, the efforts of the Negro people to bring their tremen-
dous progressive strength to bear against reaction, are endangered by conscious
anti-unity forces among them.

These disruptive forces express themselves in many ways and forms, but
all of them stem from, or play into the hands of, the trusts and their Southern
poll-tax allies.

By far, the most insidious and dangerous of these disruptive forces is
Right-wing Social-Democracy, which is assuming increasing influence among the
Negro people, although its conscious adherents are small in numbers.

These Social-Democrats tail after and support the reactionary biparti-
san foreign policy and subserviently spread among Negroes the warmongering, anti-
Soviet, anti—democratic demagogy that aims to build support for wall Streetls
drive to dominate the world......

The biggest factor in the present situation so far as the Negro people
themselves are concerned is that they are essentially anti-imperialist, pro-
labor, anti-Jim Crow, and politically progressive, and that they desire united,
non-partisan struggle against reaction on all issues facing them and the nation.
The whole problem of building the Negro people3s movement - and advancing the
cause of Negro rights - depends upon the transformation of that desire into
effective reality.

To achieve this, prime attention must be given to a few decisive tasks:

1. Organized labor and white progressives must take bold initiative
against the main imperialist ideology of white chauvinism in the fight to defend
and extend the democratic liberties of the Negro people. Failure to wage unre-
lenting, open battle on this score feeds reactionary, nationist trends among
Negroes.

2. The advanced labor and progressive forces among the Negro people
must make their paramount objective unity and collaboration with the 1abor-pro-
gressive movement on the basis of issues. This is particularly true as regards
the N.A.A.C.P., the main Negro peopleis organization.

3. Decisive for bringing about the unity of the Negro people must be
the emergence of Negro labor, through its own organizational forms in the Negro
communities, as the leader of the whole Negro liberation struggle. This will
guarantee that collaboration of the Negro people with the trade union and pro-
gressive movement. Organized Negro workers are the best guarantee of the uni-
fication of all sections of the Negro communities.

4. work should be focused on a minimum number of issues - such as

-10-

L-

F.E.P.C. and Jobs, anti-poll tax and anti-lynch legislation - on which the broad-

est area of agreement exists among all strata of the Negro people. This will
intensify the cohesion of the Negro people on a national scale.....

The free and equal citizenship of the Negro people will be won only
through bitter, unceasing struggle. Te reservoir of good-will among the Negro
people toward the Communists was created through the self-sacrificing contribu-
tions made to the cause of Negro rights over the years by our Party. The fierce
anti-Communist campaign that reaction is conducting, is putting strains upon

that good-will, which can be maintained and extended only through the most vigor-

ous and courageous daily struggle on our part against the system of national
oppression in its every manifestation.

we Communists must point out to the Negro people that their Just aspir-
ations can be fulfilled only in joint struggle with the working class on issues
of progress and democracy, on a national and international scale. But the warn-
ing we must raise for ourselves is that, while avoiding the danger of Right
opportunism, any tendency on our part toward a go-it-alone sectarianism - a
hesitancy to plunge boldly into the main stream of the Negro peopleis movement -
must be teneciously combatted.

The common enemy is powerful. But he should no more be overestimated
than underestimated. No section of the Negro people is capable of achieving
success by itself. Success requires the combined action of the overwhelming
majority of Negro Americans and their organizations in collaboration with their
natural labor-progressive allies.

The Comunists must raise high the banner of the struggle for Negro
rights and imbue it with their militant, crusading spirit and boldness. hey
must constantly, and in a way that will further the present struggle, point to
socialism as the only permanent and complete answer to national oppression.

There can be no possible realization of the Negro people's national
aspirations except through the path of struggle for the equal citizenship of
the Negro people in the current struggles of the day. In building the unity of
the Negro people for full liberation, the Communists must be in the vanguard.

(Political Affairs, November, 1947, pp.996-1006:
pp.996-998; pp.1oo3-1004; pp.1oon-1006)

Despite the brutal reactionary offensive against the Negro people, and
despite the imposing bipartisan demagogy. the Negro people are reaching new
heights of militancy and unity in the struggle for their full citizenship. They
are sparking the fight for democracy and against Wall Street's drive toward
fascism. The high point reached by the Negro people in their anti-fascist lib-
eration struggles is a positive factor of outstanding significance to the entire
labor and democratic movements. It is, as Comrade Foster points out, a con-
crete manifestation of the Negro people "representing a mighty anti-imperialist
force." The enormous potential of the Negro liberation movement against U.S.
imperialism has yet to be fully grasped by all sections of the broad peopleis
coalition shaping up in the country today.

It was largely the militancy of the Negro people that wrung from the
U.S. Supreme Court its tiny ambiguous concession in the restrictive covenant
cases. It was the insistent demands of the Negro people for their full citizen-
ship that compelled Truman to tip his hat to the Negro question by issuing empty
Executive Orders relating to discrimination in the armed services and in Federal
employmnt. It is the aggressive struggles of the Negro people, supported by

-11-

their labor and white progressive allies, that forces both the Democrats and
Republicans to try to deceive the Negro people with the most grandiloquent and
lying promises every put forward by the two major parties - and thatls saying
something!

The Negro people are not relying on these false promises and gestures.
They are building their peoplels organizations, particularly the N.A.A.0.P.;
they are playing an ever greater part in the trade-union movement, as in the
packinghouse workers! strike; they are taking their place in the new Progress-
ive Party and helping to shape its destiny; and they are waging against the
Jim Crow system courageous battles which are having results. Even in the deep
South, as in the North, the Negro people have at times defended their lives,
liberties, and homes - in the tradition of "a manis home is his castle" - with
arms in hand.

More than 300,000 Negroes in the deep South, since V-J Day, have braved
Klan terror to register and vote. A grass roots movement has developed in the
South against the Jim-Crow educational system, a movement which has been in-
creasingly joined by Southern white students and progressives.

one of the outstanding examples of the Negro peopleis fight for unity
within their own ranks and with their white allies was the historic June 2 mass
lobby in Washington, where the Independent Non-Partisan Committee for the Pas-
sage of Civil Rights Legislation joined with the Committee for Democratic Rights
in staging the most effective demonstration of Negro and white unity in the
modern history of the capital. when the Non—Partisan Committee pressed upon
the reactionary Senate Judiciary Committee the passage of the anti-lynch, anti-
poll tax and F.E.P.C. bills which the Committee had bottled up, it was this,
perhaps more than any other factor, that broke the Committee's back and con-
tributed to the defeat of the Hitlerite Mundt Bill.

The National Non-Partisan Committee co-chairmaned jointly by the majes-
tic Paul Robeson and by Percy Greene, outstanding Negro Republican leader of
Mississippi, is the concrete proof that unity can be established among the
Negro people irrespective of economic and social status or political affilia-
tion, provided that unity is established around minimum issues and forged in
the crucible of struggle against the common bipartisan enemy. At the same time,
the action of June 2 was a demonstration that Negro-labor-progressive unity can
be established between Negro and white, Jew and gentile, Catholic and Protest-
ant, Communist and non-Communist. Noteworthy among the participants in the
National Non-Partisan delegation were the large numbers of N.A.A.C.P, state
and local officials, branches and members, as well as church and fraternal
groups, among them youth and women. This event was a high point of united
action by the Negro people with their labor-progressive allies.

In the face of the fiercest offensive that the worldls most powerful
imperialism has ever waged against the Negro people, the unity of the Negro
people's liberation movement, based upon struggle in close alliance with the
organized labor and progressive movement, is decisive. The lackeys of wall
Street who try to divide this unity with betrayals, Red-baiting and other divi-
sive tactics, are stabbing the Negro people in the back and are weakening the
whole anti-imperialist, anti-fascist coalition.

Experience shows that the central points of a minimum national program
around which the unity of the Negro people and their allies can be strengthened
and raised to the conscious anti-imperialist level are the outlawing of Jim
Crow and segregation, the passage of anti-poll tax, anti-lynch and F.E.P.C.
legislation, and abolition of discrimination in the armed forces. These, to-
gether with a host of local issues, are the ones which are peculiar to the

-12..

struggle for the free and equal citizenship of the Negro people. But it should
be emphasized that the over-all issue facing the Negro people, as well as labor
and the whole American people, is the war danger. The Negro people and their
struggles for liberation are one of the most powerful forces for peace, and can
be won to an active whole-hearted opposition to all aspects of the Truman Admini-
strationis bipartisan war program. At the same time, it is the fight to prevent
Imperialist Bloodbath III that determines the objective conditions and the rela-
tionship of forces in the struggle for Negro rights.

abor and other advanced forces - including the Communists - will con-
stantly strive to assist the Negro liberation movement in reaching ever higher
levels. It is vitally important that the basis for the unity of the movement
within itself, and with its white allies, be on a minimum program. To base the
unity of this movement on a maximum comprehensive program can only result in the
weakening of the movement and the isolation of the most advanced forces. The
gauge of a correct minimum program is primarily that of the main questions around
which the maximum unity can be obtained and the largest masses moved into united
action. This will help to develop unity of the Negro people, North and South,
and will facilitate the growth of their national consciousness as a people, an
oppressed nation, fighting for their national dignity. The movement of the Negro
people against Jim Crow should be built and approached with the greatest tactical
breadth. At the same time, it cannot be separated from, or built without maximum
attention to, the decisive organizations of the Negro people, in the first place
the N.A.A.C.P. .....

ON THE NEGRO PEOPLE AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT

 

Essential to the struggle for Negro rights is the fact that it must be
based first of all upon the alliance of the Negro people with the organized labor
movement. During the whole Roosevelt era, this alliance, now under serious at-
tack, was the very basis of the limited gains by the Negro people. The Negro peo-
ple are an indispensible and long-term ally of the labor movement. Conversely,
the Negro people must defend, build and strengthen the labor movement as the apple
of their eye; for the trade unions, the organized symbol of the working class,
are the staunchest supporter and backbone of the struggle for Negro rights. No
section of the population has a greater interest in seeing one united labor move-
ment in America than the Negro, who, like labor itself, has been constantly vic-
timized by this split. Nhile labor has the responsibility of taking the lead in
wiping the stench of the slave market out of American life, the Negro workers have
the Job of combatting the forces of disunity among certain Negro circles and win-
ning the Negro people to a closer solidarity with labor. "Negro and white, unite
and fight the common oppressor" must be transformed into reality wherever man is
exploited or oppressed.

Simultaneously, the broadest unity of the Negro peopleis movement on a

local and national scale, is not only crucial, but it is the deepest desire of

the Negro people. what a more powerful force the Negro people could become if
their major peopleis organizations - the half-million strong and anti—fascist
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Negro
Congress, the National Urban League, the National Council of Negro women, the
national church bodies and faiths, the United Negro and Allied Veterans, the fra-
ternal and Greek letter groups and, above all, the Negro workers - could move too
gether on a minimum program to advance the free and equal citizenship of the Negro
people! Just as oppression of the Negro people cuts across their political
faiths and religious convictions, so should the Negro people unite - Republicans,

-13..

- \.._.,.,,._.;.

Democrats, Laborites, Communists, Socialists and Independents - to press, with
the support of labor and white progressives, for constructive, progressive legis-
lation in Washington and the states and cities to promote equal rights for the
Negro, defense of the trade unions, and the democratic welfare of the American
people.

Finally, it is essential that the Negro people take their place on the

s basis of equality in the growing movement in American for independent political

action - for the creation of a national third party, based upon the labor move-
ment, the poor farmers, the middle class and the anti-fascist majority of the
American people......

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST WHITE CHAUVINISM

 

only the Communist Party conducts a serious struggle, rooted in scien-
tific principle, against the sinister ideological weapon of American capitalism
— white chauvinism. But this struggle has not yet been raised by our Party to
the fighting level necessary to combat the systematic, frenzied pumping of this
poison into the American workers and masses. Above all, the struggle against the
penetration of this poison even into our Party3s ranks is being badly neglected.
The fight against white dhauvinism must be a constant and uncompromising battle
by all Party leaders, and especially by our white comrades. This is a political
matter and not a biological one, and no white worker should regard himself as
"immunized" from its influence.

Among several important reasons for the high fluctuation of Negro mem-
bership in the Party, the basic cause is the failure to conduct an adequate and
sensitive struggle against white-chauvinist practices and ideology. Many new
Negro members note these white-chauvinist expressions, and when they see no fight
against them, especially by our white comades, slacken their activities and fin-
ally drop out. The prevalence of white chauvinism also feeds petty-bourgeois
nationalist and separatist tendencies among the Negro comrades.

Paramount among the ways in which white chauvinism expresses itself are:
lack of sustained and vigorous struggles for Negro rights, particularly on a club
and section level, among the white workers and in white communities; inattention
to the development of Negro leaders in our Party and in the labor movement, par-
ticularly Negro women, youth, and industrial workers; lack of support and aid to
Negro peoplels organizations and projects, and to the development of the unity
of the Negro peoplels movement; lack of knowledge of important developments among
the Negro people and lack of acquaintance with the relationship of forces among
them, coupled with an over-simplified approach to work in Negro communities, and
the decline of personal relationships between Negro and white comrades on the
social level.

Some of the more subtle manifestations of white chauvinism are: a patron-
izing and "charitable" attitude toward Negro comrades; the mechanical equating
of Negro comrades with respect to their work, together with an insufficient ap-
preciation of Negro working-class cadres; and, finally, a hesitancy to partici-
pate in the discussion of differences among Negro comrades with a view to resolv-
ing them collectively on a principled basis......

ON THE NEGRO PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY

 

The Communist Party is the party of the American workers, Negro and
white. The Negro-haters long ago tried to scare the Southern white workers away
from the Communist Party by calling it the "Negro party." But it is not only
the party of the American workers of all races, creeds and colors, it is proud
to be known as the party of the Negro people and seeks ever to be worthy of that
name. For only through being the party of the Negro people can it be true to
the interests of the white workers. Because of the growing labor movement in
the deep South, and because of the influence of its Communist vanguard, Negro
and white workers are learning that through unity and solidarity they can effec-
tively combat the poll tax system, lynch law, Ku Klux "Justice" and end the re-
actionary system of divide and rule.

The Communist Party is the party of socialism and socialism alone can
e1iminate...exploitation of man by man. Because of its long-range perspective,
it can champion the immediate interests of labor and the nation......

If you are a Negro citizen - worker, farmer, professional or intellect-
ual, man or woman - and loyally devoted to the patriotic interest of your country
and your people - then you belong in the Communist Party. You have seen the
Communist Party in action - crusading for political, social and economic equality
of all citizens alike, for liberty and religious freedom, for a strong and uni-
ted labor movement, for the Negro and white unity so essential to achieving these
goals. You have tasted the fruits of successes against the Jim Crow system,
fearlessly and uncompromisingly led by the Comunist Party. You have admired
and respected the Communists, and most of you have learned that the red-baiting
slanders against Communists come from the enemies of the Negro people and of the
nation.....

The witness: ...whether the Communists used the Negro people for...

The Court: You mean the use of them for their own purpose?

The witness: Yes, used them as tools or something of the sort.

The Court: Yes, yes.

(Continuing) I then said, on this question, that the biggest use that
had been made of the Negro people had been made by confining them within a system
of Jim Crow whereby they were never able to make free choices. They were limited
by an iron curtain of Jim Crow either in the South or in the North, and that,
for example, Amrica had become a very great and wealthy country primarily be-
cause of the cotton economy in the South from the very beginning of American
capitalism, the heyday of American capitalism, and the basis of this cotton econ-
omy was the Negroes who were never permitted to vote, to be first class citizens
of this country.

The Communists,in the first place were Negro and white, and the Commun-

-15..

ists fought beside the Negro people and with them to achieve their full and
democratic choice of a free and equal life in America, and they could only do
that by fighting against the system which kept the Negro people enslaved in the
deep South, and, to a less extent, all over the country.....

(In Defense of Negro Rights, l9ﬂ9, pp.38—39)

First the Communists fight for the political, economic and social equal-
ity of the Negro people now in all aspects of American endeavor. The Partyls
great contribution to American democracy was first dramatized in the celebrated
Scottsboro case, where it not only burned the plight of the Negro into the con-
science of America for the first time since the Civil war, but it did something
entirely new. It brought for the first time the struggle for Negro rights to
the labor movement, and gave flesh and blood to the Marxist classic that "labor
in a white skin can never be free while labor in a black skin is branded."

On a thousand fronts the Communists at the side of the Negro people have
battled and do battle daily for equal rights. The Communist Party places upon its
white members, and seeks to convince all white workers, that they should be in
the front ranks against white chauvinism, the main ideology and practice of the
monopolist class, not only for enslaving the Negro people, but for exploiting
the white masses. White chauvinism is not tolerated in the Communist Party. This
makes it possible for the Negro Communists, and other advanced forces among the
Negro people, to combat the reactionary nationalism, espoused often by certain
Negro leaders, to prevent the unity of the Negro people with their natural white
allies in the labor and progressive movement.

The Communist Party recognizes Negro ability and uses it. No other pol-
itical party in America, while prating about Negro rights in words, has seen fit
to elevate a Negro to such a post of honor and responsibility as that held by
the young Negro veteran and leader, Henry Winston, Administrative Secretary of
the Communist Party. On the l2—man national board of the Communist Party are
three Negroes; and on the national Committee of the Communist Party, Negro men
and women are in larger proportion than the Negro membership. The Communist
Party is the Party of the Negro people, which it must and can only be by virtue
of being the Party of the white workers. Examples of equal rights for the Negro
set by the Communist Party inspire emulation among all organizations in the coun-
try. Communists are modestly proud of the warm regard of the Negro people, and
seek always to be ever more worthy of this honor.

Can the struggle for peace, democracy, freedom and security, be won in
the postwar world? Can the battle for the Negrols full citizenship be won? To
be sure! And this requires, besides struggle, unity and correct policy, an.
abiding faith in the people of America, Negro and white, and of the world. It
is the fear of this victory of the people that causes the frightened men of the
trusts to wallow in an orgy of Red-baiting, labor-baiting and Negro-baiting.
They see the forces of democracy - of labor and the people - growing all over
the world, including our own land.

The future belongs to the people. whether one is a member of the Com-
munist Party or not - or agrees in toto with it - one must recognize that the
future is not assured without a strong—and ever-expanding Communist Party here,
as in the other countries of the world. I want that future as quickly as pos-
sible - thatis why I am a Communist.

DEMOCRACY VERSUS FASC ISM

 

What then is the major all-inclusive issue before te American people in

the present post~war period? Democracy and progress, on the one hand, versus im-
perialist reaction and fascism, on the other. In the foreign field, it means that
our country should throw its weight, within the framework of the United Nations,

on the side of the democratic anti-fascist forces, for the purpose of extirpating
the remnants of fascism and securing freedom for colonial and semi-colonial peoples
and establishing international security and an enduring peace.

At home, the issue is to check and defeat the ever-growing menace of fasc-
ism in our country (which has already witnessed its first pro-fascist coup, namely,
the thuggish, if abortive, seizure of power by Talmadge in Georgia). Positively,
the issue before the American people is to advance the cause of democracy and pro-
gress in all walks of life, against the pro-fascist monopolists who would take the
country down the ruinous and bloody path of Nazi Germany. First swallow of the
drive toward fascism in the United States is the unprecedented and multiple cam-
paign of Big Business (principally the National Association of Manufacturers and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) against the Communist Party, the trade unions, mass
living standards and political liberties, against minority groups, among whom the
Negro bears the heaviest blows of reaction. The impending economic crisis — a
natural concomitant of the capitalist system - will intensify every one of the
political, economic and social ills from which the American people suffer today.
Unless cushioned by advancing the interests of labor and the people, a great de-
terioration of conditions for the majority of the people will result that will put
the Hoover days "in the shade."

The issue is not Communism versus capitalism or fascism. The fascists use
this posing of the issue in order to confuse the people and to extinguish democracy,
whether capitalist, as in our country, or the higher socialist form as in the Sov-
iet Union. Hitleris anti-Communist crusade was a smokescreen behind which he ex-
tinguished democracy in the seventeen countries conquered by Nazism. None of these
countries was Communist or Socialist. on the international front, the Soviet
Union — because wall Street, through the Truman Administration and its Republican
backers, insists on bolstering world reaction as in Greece, Turkey and China - is
now leading the camp of democracy.

The Communists, in America, as all over the world, who gave their lives
for the independence of their countries against the Hitler conquerors, are among
the staunchest defenders of democracy in the present postwar period.

The terrifying experience of minority groups under fascism, all over the
earth, is but a comparatively mini example of what would happen to the Negro people
in America, where capitalist reaction has already given fascism a head start by
spawning the national system of Jim Crow and “white supremacy" upon the entire body
politic of American democracy. The uprooting of the Jim Crow system is a part of
the battle to turn back the danger of fascism in America. Conversely, the rights
of the Negro people are the acid test of democracy.

Within the framework of the overall issue of democracy versus fascism, the
character of the struggle for the full citizenship of the Negro is the defense and
extension of their gains over the last years, particularly during the Franklin D.
Roosevelt era. Principally, the major issues of this moment are Jobs and the es-
tablishment of an effective F.E.PJ3.3 the right to vote, abolition of the poll
tax and the white primary; anti-lynching legislation, and the outlawing of the
Ku Klux Klan.

How is this urgently necessary and minimum program of action to be

-17-

achieved? First, there must be struggle, resolute and unflinching, because Ameri-
can imperialism is the most powerful in the world. And struggle there is and will
be among the Negro people, who will find at their side increasing thousands of
white workers and progressives in their own self-interest - a repetition of the
Fred Douglass-Abe Lincoln Negro and white unity in modern America. The Negro
people are a people of struggle, having shed their blood, sweat and tears for
every gain. And struggle is the tradition of America, from the time of its birth.

In these critical times, struggle, in order to be effective, cannot be
blind, but must be united and based upon correct policy, the necessary prerequis-
ites for success. The Communist Party, with an increasingly large section of
white workers and progressives, as well as with a considerable proportion of the
Negro people, advocates that this struggle must take place principally against
the lily-white trusts, monopolies and big corporations - and their political hire-
lings - on every front, international and domestic......

ON THE COLONIAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS

   

The colonial-liberation movement is of world significance and scope. This
irresistible upsurge can no more be confined to the Asian continent than the tide
could be stopped by Canute. Its effects are already felt in Japan, American sat-
rapy, in the Philippines, in Puerto Rico. The persecution of the Negro people

and other colored populations in South Africa by the cannibalistic, fascist govern-
ment of Malan is, by its very fiendishness, a sign of the rising activities of the
Africans against imperialist oppression. It is inevitable that the colonial re-
volution in Asia will have its repercussions in South and Central America and in
the Carribean.

These various peoples, although their liberation movements are in uneven
stages of development, are all seeking their national independence and freedom
from the so-called "free world of the west" - that is, western imperialist capit-
alism which has held these countries in a vise. Their armies are fighting the
imperialist bandits of Great Britain, Holland, France and the United States. This
is the same imperialist slavemaster camp of the wall Street monopolies, its allies ,
and satellites, which is responsible for the dangerous war tension in the world g
today. 3

The colonial peoples can no longer endure the destitution, despair, en-
slavement and animal-like wretchedness imposed upon them ever more ruthlessly by
their Western imperialist oppressors. The mortally-wounded imperialist beast, in
the stage of its last agonizing throes, is today even more dangerous. Its murder-
ous exploitation and oppression of these peoples have become outright genocidal.
In their own self-defense, the colonial peoples are now moving from the stage of
combatting their oppression to that of securing their national independence and
freedom with arms in hand. The armed attack by Wall Street's Syngman Rhee quis-
ling government upon the North Korean Democratic Republic made the military re-
sistance of the latter essential to the national independence, freedom and uni-
fication of the Korean people. The revolutionary colonial movement of Asia is
fighting for peace, industrialization, liberty, and, ultimately, for Socialism....

The volcanic eruption of the colonial liberation movements in the Far East
and in other areas of the globe is of major importance to the struggle for peace,
and against the reactionary war program of the Wall Street monopolies for world
conquest. Any tendency to belittle this question and its historic importance can
only imperil the fight for peace and freedom and objectively aid the plans of the
American monopoly capitalists for war and fascism......

-18-

At this moment of world history, the supreme task before the American
working class is to discharge its responsibility in the struggle for peace and
the prevention of a third world war. This necessitates, at all times, connecting
with, and making an inseparable part of the struggle for peace, the struggle for
the freedom, emancipation and national independence of the colonial and dependent
countries from the yoke of the common enemy - American imperialism and its satel-
lites. Tis conception is not basically grasped and acted upon sufficiently by
the peace forces. This necessity is posed sharply by wall Street-Truman aggres-
sion in Korea, China and the Far East generally. working—class internationalism
must be demonstrated by concrete support and solidarity of the American working
class with the proletarian-led Asian colonial revolutions. It requires a new and
deeper consciousness of the significance of the colonial liberation struggle on
the part of the American labor movement - beginning with its Left-progressive,
advanced sector, in order effectively to mobilize the peace-loving American people
for the seating of the representatives of the Chinese People's Republic - embrac-
ing 475 million people - and to defeat the disgraceful Mississippi-like disfran-
chisement which President Truman has imposed upon the Chinese people in the U.N.
This is the immediate key to peace and liberation of the Far East and accounts
for the insane, gangster-like opposition of Wall Streetfs State Department to the
recognition of China.

A special duty devolves upon the American working class in respect to
colonial liberation movements. This duty flows not only from the role of United
States imperialism as the last bulwark of colonial oppression everywhere in the
world today; not only from Wall Streetls growing colonization of Marshallized
western Europe and Latin America. The special duty of the American working class
derives also from the fact that the Negro people in the Black Belt of the South
constitute an oppressed nation within the territorial borders of the United States.

Stalin wrote in April, 1924: "....Hence, the necessity for the proletariat
supporting, vigorously and actively supporting, the national liberation movement
of the oppressed and dependent peoples. This does not mean that the proletariat
must support every national movement, everywhere and always, in every single con-
crete instance. The point is that support must be given to those national move-
ments which tend to weaken imperialism....." ....,

ON THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

   

The indivisibility of the struggle for peace and the struggle for free-
dom - which takes its most basic form in our country in the battle for Negro
liberation - was always of major importance. It began to take on flesh and blood
during the "cold war." But since the American monopolists launched their gangster
war against Korea and China, this battle has become a matter of vital urgency in
the effort to halt the drive to fascism and another world war.

The new element in the relationship between the struggle for peace and
for Negro liberation is the growing acuteness of the contradiction between Ameri-
can imperialism and its war program on the one hand, and, on the other, the
struggle of the Negro people and their supporters to defend their elementary lib-
erties and to advance the cause of full citizenship. This is by far the most
important single new factor of the general political situation to be noted in
connection with the struggle for national liberation of the Negro people.

The prompt, skillful and bold seizing of this factor can advance the whole

-19-

 

cause of Negro rights and raise the American peopleis struggle for peace to a new
high level, nationally and internationally.

The case of Lieut. Gilbert, the mass frame-up of Negro soldiers in Korea,
the wanton police lynching of John Derrick, Negro veteran, in Harlem, the brutal
mistreatment of Negro inductees in the segregated, Jim Crow camps of the mainland
— are the most spectacular expressions of the contradiction between wall Streetis
war program and the struggle of the Negro people for freedom and dignity. These
are also the most spectacular links between the struggle for peace and the strug-
gle for Negro rights.....

These expressions of the acute sharpening of the contradiction between
the war program of the American billionaires and the struggle for Negro libera-
tion can be duplicated on the fronts of civil rights, police brutality and Klan
terror, jobs, housing, health and education - with Negro women and youth playing
an ever more important leading role. These struggles are taking on an increas-
ingly distinct, though not yet conscious, anti-imperialist character, and are
hampering the war plans of the would-be dollar rulers of the world.

The principal lesson to be drawn from this new and sharpening element is
that the Negro liberation movement is objectively a movement for peace and against
war, and that the working class and all other peace forces must give the most
determined and uncompromising support to this movement in all of its aspects.

To win the Negro people — the Negro liberation movement - as a conscious
sector of the peopleis coalition for peace, is a responsibility and opportunity
that falls heaviest upon the advanced white workers, trade unionists and peace
forces. It is they who must wage the struggle against the Right danger, against
the poison of national and white chauvinism, which is spewed forth by a lily-
white ruling class at war with colored, colonial peoples.

Winning the Negro workers and masses for peace is not just winning another
section of the countryis population. It is mobilizing a people whose right to
self-determination and nationhood in the Black Belt, where they are a majority,
is denied by the very imperialism which is pretending to liberate another colored
nation from so-called "Communist tyranny." we must expose this pious fraud and
find the way of raising the timely world-wide demand that the wall Street liber-
ators free the Negro nation imprisoned on the American mainland from the tighten-
ing reins of pro-fascist oppression. Let them do this before they pretend to
fight for the liberation of the Korean people!

It is the profound duty of the white trade unionists and peace forces -
in the vital self-interest of preventing another world war - to support the na-
tional liberation struggles of the Negro people, which are objectively anti-im-
perialist, even though they are neither consciously anti-imperialist or conscious-
ly anti-war. All-out support and participation of the white workers in these
movements is the first pre-condition for helping them to become consciously anti-
war and consciously anti—monopo1y. Such a participation is necessary for advanc-
ing the cause of Negro rights and of advancing the struggle against £&scism.and
war.....

(The Negro People In The Struggle For Peace and
Freedom, 1951, p.3; pp.5-6)

Major attention should be given to the ever greater role which the Negro
people of the United States will play as a fundamental pillar of the fight for
freedom and peace, against American imperialism and its war plans. As Comrade
Foster pointed out, the Negro question in the United States is no longer just a
domestic question, which is becoming sharper; it is now an international

-20..

question. The new stage of the Negro liberation movement merges with the struggle
of the colonial and darker peoples of the Far East - as well as of Africa - again-
st the common enemy - wall Street imperialism. It is the Achilles heel of the
wall Street-Trman foreign policy, exposing its pretensions of "democracy" before
the peoples of the Far East, Latin America, the Carribean and Africa, and causing
the white ruling class to enshroud its sharpening lynch oppression of the Negro
people with extra layers of demagogy, grandiloquent hypocrisy, superficial maneu-
vers and cheap concessions.

Paul Robeson, the great Negro peopleis leader and the great American,
made a brilliant contribution to the cause of peace and freedom with his historic
challenge to the wall Street warmongers, who would plunge the American people,
Negro and white, into a war against the land of Socialism, which has elevated
the oppressed nations of yesterday into free and equal brother nations of the
great U.S.S.R. In that challenge, Robeson eloquently affirmed the vital inter-
connection of the Negro peoplels liberation struggle in the United states and the
liberation struggle of the colonial peoples with the struggle for peace. The con-
tinued panicky response to Robesonis challenge, and the maneuvers of white supre-
macy imperialists of this country, and their Truman government, expose the clay
feet of the wall Street colossus. The central lesson for the Negro liberation
movement from the Asian colonial upsurge is that this movement will rise to new
heights of action and achievement. It is inconceivable that the movement of the
darker, colonial peoples of the East will fail to inspire the sharpest struggles
and activities of the Negro people for their first-class citizenship.

WHITE SUPREIVIACISTS AND PRO-FASCJESTS ON TRIAL

 

(A week after a nine month trial where a prejudiced and intimidated Jury took
only seven hours to bring in a verdict of guilty against the eleven leaders of
the Communist Party, the court was reconvened for sentence by Judge Medina. It
was a day which will go down in the history of our land as a day of shame, cap-
ping the most infamous and monstrous frame-up ever perpetrated. The defendants
made their final statements.)

The Court: Mr. Davis.

Defendant Davis: Your Honor, I wish to associate myself with the state-
ment of Mr. Dennis, and I had not desired originally to plead, but inasmuch as I
was denied the opportunity to serve as my own counsel in the latter stages of the
trial and to address the Jury in defense of my Party and my comades and myself,
I do wish to make a few remarks.

I have in mind not alone my Party and my comrades; I have in mind my
people in particular as well as my country. They are very unhappy. They have
been oppressed for many years in America, and this verdict and the sentence which
you pronounce upon me and my comrades will only continue their oppression.

It will do even more. It will attempt to prevent my people, the Negro
people of America, their working-class allies and their democratic friends among
the great majority of the American people from continuing their struggle for
first-class citizenship. But this will not intimidate my people. They have
fought and they have a glorious record in American history, and everything they
have gotten they have fought for - sometimes alone, but now today not alone. Not
only do they have the working class of America and the democratic people of Amer-
ica on their side, they have the forces of progressive humanity all over the
world on their side. They will never be daunted by this verdict and by this

-21-

 

‘, ._.._——————7. ~.V~-.V ._ .

sentence.

This sentence and this verdict and this trial can only have one effect
with respect to the American people. It is an attempt to reduce the First and
Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution - indeed the whole Bill of Rights
- to the status of the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments so that the American
people, instead of seeing the beautiful democracy of the Negro people raised to
their level and citizenship, now face the terrific trial of being reduced to the

second class citizenship of the Negro people.

The men who should be before you this morning, your Honor, taking sen-
tence are not here. They should be the Rankine; they should be the lynchers;
they should be the Ku Klux which is still free to roam the South and burn and
kill and lynch my people. That's who should be in this dock. And as M. Dennis
says, the men of Wall Street who are plotting the worst force and violence that
our people could ever withstand, and that is the force and violence of the third

world war.

I think that my people and the American people generally will respond
to this hideous anti-Communist crime with which we are charged, something as
alien and foreign to everything that our Party stands for, our Party which has
learned from Lenin, our Party which is based upon the revolutionary traditions
of the American people, of Lincoln and Jefferson and Fred Douglass and Paine;
our Party which is equipped with the science of Marx and Engels and Lenin and
Stalin, and our Party which has been taught by the greatest leader that the Ameri-
can working class ever produced, in William Z. Foster.

You cannot kill our Party, and I must say that this verdict is already
being taken as a signal to deprive the Negro people of New York of their lone
representative in the City Council of New York, their lone flesh and blood in
the City Council of New York, and they are trying to do it by designating a little
political pipsqueak that the Negro people would not even spit upon because he is
on the other side of the fence. He is with the oppressors of the Negro people;
but maybe it is good. He will need a trial like this to help with his political
chances, if he has any. And as for myself, our Party will go on fighting for the
freedom of the Negro people and for the working class and for socialism. And
though you may put Winston in jail, and sentence Winston, there will be thousands
of other Winstons that will arise among the Negro people for years to come, even
greater, and they will strike against force and reaction until the Negro people
are free. I will not be intimidated. I was not intimidated by the lynchersl
court in Georgia, and I will not be intimidated by any court by any forces of
reaction anywhere, and neither will Winston, and neither will my people and my

Party.

We are confident that the American people are going to realize what is
happening here and that they will realize that their liberties, their peace and
their democracy are imperiled. We have all the confidence in them because the
future belongs to the people of America, Negro and white.

FOREWORD

Negro History Week, 1956, is heralded by an upsurge of democratic
struggles on the part of the Negro people, more unified and militant than at any
time since the days of Reconstruction. They are fighting to implement the Supreme
Court decisions on civil rights, to defend the Constitution against the assaults
of the Dixiecrats - in short, to bring democracy to the South and to strengthen
democracy throughout the land. And they are winning increasing support from the
labor movement and other democratic forces of our country.

Marxists hail these struggles,not only as the maturing of the historic
fight for liberation of an oppressed people, but also as a powerful force for demo-
cracy and peace in our country as a whole. As in the past, so now, they do every-
thing they can to hasten the completion of the unfulfilled bourgeois democratic
revolution in the South, which has now become an especially urgent task for the
working class and the nation.

Over the past twenty-five years, American Marxists have made important
theoretical and practical contributions to the fight for Negro rights. Their con-
ception of the Negro Question as a national question has helped clarify the nature
of the problem and to link it with the liberation struggles of oppressed peoples
the world over. Their understanding of the profit-seeking roots of the Jim Crow
system has helped place the question within the framework of the class struggle and
to reveal its implications for the American working class. Their leadership and
support for concrete struggles on many fronts has helped strengthen and give orien-
tation to the movement, and to enlist the aid of important allies.

William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States,
has given consistent leadership to the work of American Marxists in the struggle
for Negro freedom, both through his organizational activities and in his extensive
writings on the subject. Especially notable also have been the contributions of
such Negro Marxist leaders as Henry Winston, Pettis Perry, Benjamin J. Davis, Jr.,
Claudia Jones, James E. Jackson, William L. Patterson, Claude Lightfoot, and many
more.

It is particularly fitting, on the occasion of Negro History Week, to
call attention to the contributions of Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. For three decades
he has been an outstanding leader in the struggles of the Negro people and the work-
ing class - as defense attorney for such victims of lynch-law as Angelo Herndon and
the "Scottsboro Boys"; as New York City Councilman for two terms; as publisher of
the Daily Worker; as member of the National Committee of the Communist Party; as
victim of the thought—contro1 Smith Act, falsely convicted and required to spend
four years in a federal prison; and as staunch champion of all working class and
peop1e*s struggles for democracy and peace. Incidentally, it was a resolution he
sponsored in the City Council in l9ﬂ4 which initiated the annual Negro History Week
proclamations by the Mayor of the City of New York.

We greet the return of Ben Davis to the political life of our country;
and we commend to our students and others the illuminating excerpts here reproduced
from some of his writings.

ON THE POSITION OF THE NEGRO PEOPLE

 

To say it as briefly as I can, I dealt first with the question of the posi-
tion of the Negro people. I said that the Negro people are at the bottom of the
political and economic and social ladder on a world scale; that this existed not
alone in our country but also existed in Africa; that this existed also in the
west Indies; that this existed also in other countries where there were large Negro
populations, as for example in Latin America.

And I pointed out that this was a direct consequence of what could be
called Anglo-Saxon imperialism and that the imperialism of our own country -
meaning by "imperialism" the dominant financial forces and class of our country -
that their oppression of the Negro people in this country was a part of the re-
actionary foreign policy which they were pursuing with respect to colonial peoples
of all races, colors and creeds abroad. I said that this oppression is simply
not based upon the fact that the Negro people in a great majority happen to look
different from white people in terms of their skin and their features, but that
this oppression had as its basis the extraction of super-profits out of the Negro
people. This was especially true in the Black Belt area which constitutes the
main cotton economy area of the Deep South. The treatment of the Negro people
in this country, that is, the national oppression, existed because of the sack of
poison which flowed from the original oppression of the Negro people in the Black
Belt.

I said that a second reason why this oppression existed was because it
was a very convenient way for big business and the big employers to divide the
working class and people of our country, that is to say, to play Negroes against
white, and in that way weaken the power of the working class and of the democratic
forces of our country to put up an effective and successful struggle for their
liberation, for the end of exploitation, for the end of oppression of the Negro
people.

Then the third reason I gave was that this system of the oppression of
the Negro people was buttressed by a whole ideology of white supremacy; that this
idea expresses itself in all aspects of American life; and that this is used to
create the impression that the whites are superior to the Negroes and that the
Negroes are inferior to the whites. I said that this idea was completely unscien-
tific, that it was a form of Nazi ideology because it was more akin to barbarism.

I then said that a fourth reason why this oppression takes place is be-
cause in the deep South there is a constant effort on the part of the Negro people
to look for jobs and employment in other parts of the country, and also to escape
the rigors of lynch terror. Having such low living standards, it was possible for
the employers to play them against the white workers in other parts of the country,
and that therefore the oppression of the Negroes in the Black Belt conStitut€d.9
threat to the living standards of the white workers all over the country. These
were the four reasons which I gave in the report for the oppression of the Negro

' people.

Now I pointed out also that this system of the oppression of the Negro
people in the glack Belt was the most rigorous type of oppression; that we had in
America what is called bourgeois democracy or capitalist democracy; that there are
certain limited very precious rights which the America people hold and which we
want to defend today against all manifestations of fascism seeking to-destroy the
limited rights which the American people have. But I pointed out that down in
the Deep South, particularly in the Black Belt area, these bourgeois democratic
rights had never really been fully recognized by the Negro people and that the

-1-

‘L

nearest thing that they had had toward this recognition was during the Reconstruc-
tion period when the Negroes were able to elect Congressmen and State legislators
and even two State Senators from the State of Mississippi. I pointed out also

that this Black Belt area was characterized by the following disabilities imposed
upon the Negro people: that it was common knowledge that they could not vote ex-
cept under extreme terror; that they could not elect public officials except -
well, there are practically no exceptions to that - I donlt recall mentioning them;
that they could not elect judges, that they could not elect governors and State
Senators and could not hold public office. I also pointed out that they were
pretty much confined to the lowest type of share-cropping, which is a system where-
by the Negro poor farmers and share-croppers are practically attached to the land
and live under a system of peonage on the land which they have tilled for more
than 300 years since they have been in this country, brought here as slaves.

Then I said also that because of the very deep and great oppression of

the Negro people that the white population in this area is oppressed also because
the white workers and poor farmers in this area are also victims of a system of
landlords, of mill owners and others; and that one of the main reasons why this —
the oppression of the Negroes - had existed in this way and one of the main rea-
sons why the oppression of the whites had existed in this way is because of the
system of lynch terror, particularly in the Black.Belt where one is played against
the other, and it had not been possible as yet to get them together; that it was
the purpose of big business and the plantation owners to keep them forever divided.

Then I pointed out what I meant when I spoke of the lynch system. Now,
I said that most people just consider lynching as the physical act of hanging a
person by a rope and, of course, that is the most extreme, savage and cannibalis-
tic form of the lynch treatment of the Negroes, but the lynch system was more than
that. The lynch system meant that the Negro people in this area lived in constant
threat of their lives any time they sought to exercise their rights; and that
lynching is not alone the murder of a citizen but that it is a badge of the infer-
ior status of the Negro people.

I pointed out that in the Black Belt this was enforced against the Negro
people, although it is precisely in the Black Belt areas where the Negro people
are in a majority over the white people.

Now I pointed out also that the Negro people were in this way a victim of
a system of force and violence.

I pointed out also that the Negro people were victims of a conspiracy
that had been carried on against them ever since Andrew Johnson betrayed the cause
of the Civil War by coming to an agreement with the defeated slaveowners to keep
the Negroes in one or another form of feudal slavery.

This conspiracy consisted of the fact that the 13th, lﬂth and 15th amend-
ments were constantly violated in the Black Belt area more than they were in the
North, although it is only a question of degree.

I pointed out too that, for example, the 14th Amendment of the Constitu-
tion requires that the representation from states should be reduced in accordance
with the number of qualified voters but that this provision of the Constitution
had never been enforced.

And I said further, this conspiracy existed in the fact that there were
so many officials of the South, Senators and Representatives, who had not only
been a part of the system of oppression of the Negro people and the poor white
population but that they, themselves, had constantly incited lynch terror and Ku
Klux terror against the Negro people; and that this had been done with the con-

-2-

nivance of the Attorney General of the United States, of the President of the
United States, and of the whole administration of justice.And I pointed out that
one of the worst examples of the inferior status of the Negro people was that in
all the 5,000 lynchings that have taken place in America since 1886 that there
has never been one prosecution which resulted in a conviction of a lyncher either
by a federal court, a federal general-attorney, a federal judge or by a state
court, or by a state attorney~general, or what have you.

The Court: This is all what you reported?
The witness: Yes, yes.

(Continuing) Then I pointed out, that notwithstanding this system of
oppression under which the Negro people lived, that certain progress had been made
by the Negro people over the course of the years. And I said that the progress
was due in the first place to the great militancy of the Negro people themselves,
their unwillingness to accept this inferior status without a fight, and that that
was true even before the Communist Party was ever organized in our country, and
that the Negro people showed this was so because, during the Civil war and during
the slave period, there were many revolts of Negro slaves against the system of
force and violence of slavery.

And then, the second reason that I gave was that in modern America the
principal progress that had been made in the struggle for Negro rights had been
made by virtue of the alliance between the Negro people and the labor movement,
plus the democratic forces of the nation.

Then I said that the Negro people had in recent years made many gains
but that the basic framework of the Jim-Crow system still exists in our country...
(In Defense of Negro Rights, 19#9, pp.34-38)

Among the things that I said, I discussed the question of the crisis and
the Negro people, and I said that one of the most unfailing indications of a com- g
ing economic crisis was the degree of unemployment which was already beginning to i
hit the Negro workers. There were lay-offs and cut—backs which affected the whole 1
working class in America, and we were beginning to have a period of large unemploy-
ment in this country but the major brunt of this unemployment and this period of
economic recession into which we were moving was falling heaviest on the Negro
workers. One of the most important tasks for the labor and progressive forces as
a whole was to fight - to struggle to smash the system of imposing upon the Negro
workers the biggest single burden of the coming economic recession; and when Negro
workers were themselves beginning to feel the heavy brunt of unemployment, then
that was time for the whole working class, for the labor movement, for the C.I.0.
and for the A. F. of L. to start fighting, to see that the burdens of this econo-
mic crisis were not placed primarily upon the workers and upon those Americans
who could least afford to bear this burden.

I said that the real danger that faced the country with the growing
acuteness of an economic crisis was the danger of fascism; that there was al-
ready a head start toward fascism in America by virtue of the fact that the system
of white supremacy with respect to Negro workers had so long existed, so that the
real big danger that faced the American working class and the American people was
the danger of fascism and that this danger could quickly be intensified by the
fact that we already had in America a Jim-Crow system.

Now those were the principal things I said on the crisis; and then I
pointed out as one of the main ways of overcoming the special unemployment which
Negro workers had to undergo was this fighting against the system which had long
existed in our country, symbolized in the statement that the Negroes are the last

-3-

to be hired and the first to be fired. This could be fought against and defeated
only to the extend that the Negro and white workers fought together side by side,
and by the extent that the white workers took the initiative against this idea
that the Negro workers must always do the lowest form of work and receive the
lowest pay.

Those were the principal things I said......

As a Negro American, I want to be free. I want equal opportunities,
equal rights; I want to be accorded the same dignity as a human being and the
same status as a citizen as any other American. This is my constitutional right.
I want first-class, unconditional citizenship. I want it, and am entitled to it,
now.

I want to be free of discrimination, Jim Crow, segregation, lynch law;
I want to be free of second-class citizenship. In short, I want, as an American
citizen, to enjoy the four freedoms which were proclaimed by the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt, and which the State Department is interested hypocritically in prating
about for every place except America.

This is the deepest and most determined desire of the fifteen million

Negro citizens of America. All Negroes, in one form or another - or to one
degree or another - are affected by Jim Crow, segregation and discrimination.

The Negro workers, that is, the great mass of Negroes, bear the heaviest brunt

of the national Jim Crow system. But the relatively tiny Negro upper class, as
well as the middle class, are also hit by discrimination. They have neither
political, social or economic equality, and they are confined almost exclusively
to the Negro market, which they must share with the white ruling class, without
being able to share equally the general market of white consumers over which Wall
Street maintains undisputed sway.

On the elementary issues of democracy in the deep South, where the great
majority of the Negro people live, the white primary, injustice in the courts,
lynch terror, lack of educational facilities, Jim Crow are endured by the Negro
from top to bottom. I, for example, through no virtue of my own, was born into
a middle class family, and received essentially the same educational advantages
of one from a white middle class family. But when I board the trolley in Atlanta
or Birmingham, I am not asked my class origin among the Negroes, nor are my uni-
versity degrees inquired about. I must still sit in the Jim Crow section of the
car. Discrimination cuts across all sections and classes of the Negro people.

So with other walks of life. The white citizen of any class does not have that
additional indignity to undergo, even though he may be exploited as a worker.

The Jim Crow system has its sharpest expressions in the South. But it
spreads its tenaclas all over America, including New York, where I share in com-
mon with all other Negroes the denial of my constitutional right to live, for
example, at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, an exclusive, lily-white area. The
restrictive covenant, against which the Negro people, their labor and progressive
white allies are fighting, makes quite immaterial any Negrois ability to pay the
high rent at 72nd Street. That, too, is Jim Crow a la New York, and it works
its ways not only in housing but in jobs, civil rights, the slum-infested ghetto,
education and in other fields — sometimes covertly and subtly, but, nevertheless,
it is there.

M personal daily experience with Jim Crow - which experiences need no
detailing because they are universally recognized as the basic experience of the
Negro people - confronted me all the way from my native state of Georgia to Massa-
chusetts, where I attended Amherst College and Harvard Law School.

It is certainly ludicrous to observe the imperialist troubadours of a
world war III - together with the monopoly press and radio - attacking the Soviet
Union by referring to an "iron curtain" allegedly maintained by the Soviet against
the world. For the real "iron curtain," which becomes at times cruelly literal,
is the one maintained in our country, separating the Negro Americans from their
birthright - their constitutional rights as free and equal citizens. Such is
life for the Negro people in the United States - such are the facts - without
any "ifls," "and|s" or "butis" or so-called "political propaganda."

I am a typical American, who loves liberty and freedom - the same liber-
ty and freedom that a Dewey and a Truman would sacrifice to the golden altar of
American imperialism, in the name of "fighting Communism."

ON THE NEGRO NATION

   

Since the prime roots of the oppression of the Negro people, on a nation-
wide scale, are in the Black Belt areas of the South, we must look here to ascer-
tain their true status. In order to wage a successful fight on the day-to-day
issues of Negro rights and to defeat the objectives of capitalist tories, the
ultimate, long-range perspective of democratic solution of the Negro question
must be clarified and fully settled. Otherwise, one cannot distinguish which
trends and developments are growing and permanent, however weak at the moment,
and those which are temporary and disappearing, however strong at the moment.

The conscious seizure and development of that which is new and rising, sound and
permanent - even though not fully developed - is the key to the complete libera-
tion of the Negro people, as it is to the emancipation of the working class of
our country.

The Negro people in the Black Belt are a nation and possess the basic
characteristics of a nation. According to the only scientific definition of
nationhood, given by Stalin:

A nation is an historically evolved, stable comunity
of language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up
manifested in a community of culture.

Fears may be expressed that this definition comes from Stalin as if from
the brow of Jove. However, it will be found that every country or people in the
world today which is popularly as well as accurately described as a nation, pos-
sesses the basic characteristics of nationhood analyzed by Stalin. The Black
Belt area in the South is the core and main center of the Negro nation in America.

When, over 300 years ago, the Negroes were first brought to this country
against their will, they were enchained in chattel slavery and did not ripen into
nationhood over night. Even before the Civil War they had certain common charac-
teristics, namely, a common land, language and psychological make—up growing out
of their common oppression. But it was not until after the Civil war and the
abolition of slavery that they developed the higher qualities of nationhood even
though in elementary form.

They have developed a strong proletariat, a petty-bourgeoisie, profess-
ionals and middle class, and a distinct, although weak capitalist class, land-
owners and industrialists. The Negro bourgeoisie is almost 100 per cent confined
to the Negro market for its profits. All sections of the Negro people are sub-
ject to national Jim Crow oppression. The great majority of the Negroes in the
Black Belt area are sharecroppers and poor farmers- almost physically attached
