the force. . . .” At the same time he admitted that enormous proﬁts
would folloW_ a merger. The New I/ork' Times, December 5, 1934,
reported him as saying:

if all the telegraph and cable traﬂic of the United States were handled
by one company, certain operating economies could be effected which,
if there were no offset, would tend inevitably to increase the sum total
of net income in the industry.

‘ Joel Young, president, and Mary L. Cook, secretary, of the
United Telegraphers of America likewise appeared at these hearings.
They contended “that the proposed merger of the two major tele-
graph companies would lengthen breadlines and cause increased
suffering to thousands of veteran telegraph operators.”

Frank B. Powers of the Commercial Telegraphers’ Union, esti-
mated that at least 15,000 would lose their jobs if the Western
Union-Postal Telegraph merger went through. Even F. G. Burton,
president of the Association of Western Union Employees, the com-
pany union, although minimizing the extent of unemployment result-
ing from the merger, admitted that about 8, 5oo would be rendered
jobless. He added that Western Union facilities with the addition of
only 1,000 Postal employes are sufﬁcient to care for normal wire
trafﬁc. It is doubtful if Burton would have made this admission,
had it not been for Western Union’s coolness toward the merger.

Despite the organized workers’ determined opposition to the
merger—expressed especially by the new independent unions—the
Federal Communications Commission has gone ahead with its pro-
gram. On January 21, I93 5, it recommended to Congress that the
consolidation be left to the telegraph company ofﬁcials to work out
with the approval of the Commission. There were demagogic
promises of protecting the interests of the workers through a “dis-
missal wage.” But. the Commission virtually admitted that many
workers would be ﬁred as a result of, the merger. It is signiﬁcant
also that no provisions are made for the more than 3o,ooo telegraph
and cable workers who have been thrown out of the industry since
I929. It is but another example of the Roosevelt government aiding
the monopolists at the expense of the workers.

Unemployment

In the years 1929 to 1933 inclusive, no fewer than 150,000, or
30%, of the workers have been squeezed out of the communications
industry. ' This has been accomplished largely through direct layoffs
practiced by all companies; by the furlough system used especially
by Western Union; by increased mechanization and speed-up.

Thus the three largest communications companies alone accounted
for nearly 146,000 of the 150,000 workers rendered jobless. in the
industry in the 1929-33 period.

Nor has the Roosevelt “New Deal” brought any increase in
employment. The Bell System, for example, boasts in its annual
report for the year ending December 31, 1934, that it has been
operating under. the President’s Reemployment Agreement since
August, 193 3. Yet the number of its employes under this “reemploy-
ment” program increased by only 460, from 248,497 in 1933 to
248,957-in 19341

Employment of telephone and telegraph workers combined in
1934, actually averaged 0.1% less than in 19 3 3/ In both these
years, employment was 11% lower than in 1932, according to the
U. S. Department of Labor.

Bell Kills Jobs

The telephone trust is probably the largest single employer of
women Workers in the country. By the same token the Bell System
* Not including its subsidiaries, Western Electric Co. and Bell Telephone Laboratories.

Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.

has become the largest mass dis—employer of woman labor. For
women telephone operators have been the chief victims of the intro-
duction of automatic operation—the dial system of rationalization.
Between 192 5 and 1932, dial telephones increased from 12.4% to
42.5% of all the telephones in the Bell System.

Even the U. S. Department of Labor said of the dial system that
it has “decreased the employment opportunities for operators by
about two-thirds.”

Another trick has been to seek “voluntary resignation” of tele-
phone workers. “The New York Telephone Company,” reported
New York Times, March 29, I93 3, three weeks after Roosevelt’s
inauguration, “has instituted a policy of seeking ‘voluntary resigna-
tions’ among the more than 2o,ooo employees comprising its operat-
ing force. . . . It is said to be in line with the action of several other
subsidiaries of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company .C. .”

The_ inducement to “resign voluntarily” was a so—called “vacation
payment,” “equivalent to a week’s salary for every year of service.”
This was the workers’ “reward” after long years of service to the
company. But during the same years that New York Telephone
Co. was laying off workers——I9.,ooo were dropped in the ﬁve years
I929—33—the number of higher paid oﬂicers was increased as were
their salaries.

The City Affairs Committee on June 12, 1933, charged:

In 1930 ‘the New York Telephone Co. paid 48 general officers an
average of $306 a week, or $15,912 for the year. In I932 the number
of general officers was increased to 51 with an average of $332 a week,
or an average annual increase of $832. In the meantime the wages of
lowly telephone operators decreased from $32,174,905 to $22,696,406.
Twenty-dollar-a-week operators were compelled to take one, two and
three days off a week with a resulting decrease in pay to distribute the
burden of depression equitably.

What happens to these discharged telephone workers? Unpro-
tected by a genuine system of unemployment and social insurance
such as the Workers Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill
(H. R. 2827) proposes, many are ~forced onto breadlines or com-
pelled to live on charity and relief handouts. Even government
investigators have admitted that despite the youth of many laid-off
operators, it was difﬁcult for them to ﬁnd jobs of any kind.

“Force-R eduction-Furloug/ts"

Early in 1931 Western Union introduced on a broad scale the
mass layoff system known as "force-reduction-furloughs.” Workers
in the entire system were affected, from messengers up.

Originally, under the furlough system, workers who were not
called to work within two years were automatically dropped from
the system. However, the expiration date of the furloughs has been
twice extended. In a letter written November I9, 1934, vice-presi-
dent ]. C. Willever again “agreed to renew the special concession‘
(1) stated in my letter of November 28, 1933, by changing the
effective dates and extending it through the year 1935.”

How does the furlough system operate? A furloughed worker
might be called to work one, two or three days a week and work
from four to seven hours a day. Those on “unassigned lists” may
be called by phone or telegram. They are thus “on the payroll”
which not only disqualiﬁes them from unemployment relief, but also
serves to keep them on the jump every day waiting to be called to
work. Constant worry and stress results from this company policy.

Some workers have been called in for only a few hours when the
business rush was such that it could not be handled by the curtailed
force. During Christmas and other holidays, furloughed workers
might be called in every day and in the busy summer periods for ﬁve
or six hours a day. They are paid on an hourly rather than a daily
basis, so the company “saves” at the expense of the workers.

The furlough system is a. potent weapon for the company, which
is the reason for its extension. It creates a large reserve force for
possible use in strikes; and with such a force the company can
lower labor standards of the employed workers——“if you don’t like
it there are plenty more.” Thus vice-president Willever stated in
Spring, 1934, that the “present plenitude of available messengers
should not cause our people to recruit a larger force than is really’
necessary.” (Letter, May 29, I934.)

Decline of Morse Operators

The rationalization movement to cut out jobs in telegraphy became
particularly marked after 1922 with the introduction of the printer
telegraph———known also as the teletypewriter or teletype. (The

Is

  

teletypewriter is manufactured by Teletype Corp., a subsidiary of
A. T. & T. and is used by Western Union and Postal Telegraph;
by newspapers, press services, brokers and investment bankers.)

As a result, skilled Morse operators, formerly among the most
highly paid workers in the industry, have faced “near-extinction” in
the words of the U. S. Department of Labor. “In the larger offices,”
the same agency adds, “Morse operators have been somewhat slowly
but very largely displaced by operators of printer telegraphs, and
the productivity of printer operators is so great that technological
displacement approximates 50 per cent of the number of operators
who wo-uld be required under Morse manual operation.” These
highly skilled operators have been replaced‘ by women Workers who
are paid a fraction of the wages formerly paid Morse men. As a
result, “In all ofﬁces combined the proportion of male operators has
been reduced from about 80 per cent to about 40 per cent of the
total number. . . .” Even in 1932, the government agency could
say, “The number of Morse operators is now negligible,” having
declined from 63.1% in 1925 to only 15.5% of all Morse and
printer operators combined in 1931.

Messenger Boys

Messenger “boys” are often grown men with families who have
been forced into this low-paid work because of unemployment in
other occupations. Mary L. Cook of the United Telegraphers of
America, speaking also for the Telegraph Messengers Union at the
hearings in Washington last December, “painted a picture of under-
paid messengers being kept from work because they could not afford
to pay repair bills for their dilapidated bicycles . . . she also charged
that messengers were discharged and reemployed at smaller wages.”
(New York Times, December 6, I934.) Messengers have been
paid as little as $22 a month on full time.

The company, of course, prefers to employ younger, unmarried
boys because it can pay them lower wages and speed them up more.
A Western _Union Messenger School is operated in cooperation with
the New York City Board of Education at the Western Union Build-
ing. Another school for training clerks, operators and the like is
located in Bloomﬁeld, N. J. Students of these schools have been
hired to replace furloughed employes at lower wages.

 ¢———-—————~ ~

In April, 1934, Grace Abbott of the U. S. Chi1dren’s Bureau
criticized the employment of messengers under 18 years of age to
make deliveries on bicycles or motor vehicles “because of the extra
hazards involved in this work.” (New York Times, April 4, 1934.)
And yet in August, 1934, vice-president Willever urged an “effort
to increase the turnover in messenger personnel and thus decrease
the average age of messengers.” By arrangement with the Junior
Vocational Employment Bureau “at Philadelphia, Delivery Manager
Allison made an agreement . . . to exchange older boys who will
be placed by the Bureau for 16 year old boys who will enter our
service,” Willever reported. (Letter dated August 9, 1934.)

Wages and Codes

Weekly payrolls of telephone and telegraph workers combined
dropped 30.5% between 1930 and 1934, according to indices of the
U. S. Department of Labor. For 1934, weekly payrolls still averaged

‘ 11.8% below 1932.

According to the conservative ﬁgures of the same agency, per
capita weekly earnings of communications workers increased 2.7%
between November, 193 3 , and November, 1934. But cost of living
(all items including rent) rose 14% between Roosevelt’s inaugura-
tion and March, 1935. The higher prices, workers now have to
pay for necessaries, have more than wiped" out what slight wage rises
there may have been. The real wages of communications workers,
like those of millions of other workers, have been slashed under the
“New Deal.”

The communications companies do not operate under NRA codes.
Western Union, Postal Telegraph and A. T. & T. operate under the
President’s Reemployment Agreement (PRA). Even former NRA
Administrator Gen. Hugh Johnson was forced to remark that tele-
graph workers’ conditions under the PRA were “highly unsatisfac-
tory.” At the 1933 A. F. of L. convention‘ it was reported that
under PRA “telegraph messengers are working for as low as Io cents
an hour. Skilled telegraph girls working in the hotels in Washington
under the Blue Eagle are making only $54 a month, 48 hours a
week.” A

The companies in September, 1933, had submitted a code “unsatis-
factory to NRA.” This code provided for minimum weekly wages

I5

of $12 to $15 ($1 less in 15 southern states), depending upon popu-
lation. Later, proposed amendments called for a 43-hour week;
exemption of “professional” employes, those receiving over $35 a
week and employes in towns with three or less persons in an ofﬁce,
exclusive of the manager. _

But Col. Manton Davis of the R. C‘. A. said that his company
“would have difficulty” even in complying with a 44-hour, $15
weekly code! ‘ Representatives of the Telegraph Messengers Union,
however, demanded a minimum weekly wage of $15 for messengers,
the lowest paid employes.

The Bell System was extremely reluctant to submit to an NRA
code, it stated, because of its “non-competitive,” i. e., monopoly posi-
tion. Hearings on a telephone code were announced for April 23,
1934. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. itself submitted the
proposed code which was almost identical with that of the United
States Independent Telephone Assn., representing the “independents”
in the industry. The telephone code called for minimum weekly
wages of from $11 to $15 a week, according to the size of the
exchanges, and $10 for learners. Proposed maximum hours were
40 a week, but employes with salaries of $35 or more were exempted.
These were such openly sweatshop wages that Marie Correll, a
representative of the Women’s Bureau of the U. S. Department of
Labor, was forced to statezy “The minimum wages represent lower
wages than have been paid in the past in the telephone industry and
are lower than those for other industries.”

Wage Slashes During Crisis

On November 1, 1931, a 10% wage cut affecting some 50,000
workers was put into effect by Western Union with the aid of its
company union, the Association of Western Union Employees. Some
14,000 messenger boys were excepted because they had previously
had their wages cut. In August, 1932, Western Union handed out
another 10% cut to workers earning above the “basic rate” of

$80 a month.

When Western Union announced its ﬁrst 10% slash, New York»

Times, October 14, 1931, reported: “Employees of the Postal
Telegraph, Commercial Cable, All America Cables, Mackay Radio
and other divisions of the International Telephone & Telegraph

16

 

«P

«P

 

Corporation have received various pay cuts.” Postal’s slashes
amounted to from 10% to 25%. -

Asa result of workers’ direct and indirect pressure, Postal Tele-
graph in July, 193 3, was forced to restore 6% of its wage reduc-
tions——b-ut on the basis of the reduced earnings. Western Union
followed suit with 10% on July I, 193 3, and another 5% on
April 16, 1934. But Western Union wages are still 5% below the
time of the ﬁrst wage cut.’ U

Direct wage cuts have been accompanied by a whole series of
devices calculated to increase exploitation of the workers. For
example, on November 29, 1933, Western Union announced: “Sun-
day work to be paid for during this period at straight time rate,”
instead of at time-and-a-half as before. Vacation pay was cut and
Vacations spread “over the I2 months period beginning with January
I,” "to quote Western Union’s order. And workers were forced to
take vacations “with the minimum number of reliefs and with the

‘least disturbance to the service”——i. e., at the convenience of the

company, but not of the workers.

Short tours and compulsory time off without pay, have likewise
reduced earnings. Some skilled workers have been reduced to a less
skilled status with consequent wage reductions. Telegraph company
managers have been demoted to become supervisors, supervisors to
operators, while operators have been reduced to lower paid jobs or
“furloughed.”

Telephone Speed-Up

“It’s the greatest speed-up system in the world,” wrote a switch-
board operator in the Journal of Electrical Workers and Operators.
Here is a description of the telephone speed-up provided by this
operator:

Suddenly I saw the supervisor dart forward. . . “That light has been
going for I2 seconds. Snap into it” . . .

You are allowed only 10 seconds to complete a call-—and just let the
supervisor see you take more than six.

What I hate is this awful sense of being hurried so. '

“Girls often faint during the rush hours and are revived in the
‘attractive rest-rooms’ of which the company boasts in its publicity,”

I7

1

writes Grace Hutchins in her book Women Who Work (International
Publishers).

Hours at the switchboard are generally 48 a week. But in Nevada,
for example, the law permits women to work as high as 56 hours a
week in telephone exchanges. Overtime is common. The “split
trick” operators have their day’s work separated into two divisions
by a period of two to ﬁve hours. Older workers are used on the
night shift, but most operators are young girls, starting at 18,
since it is only the young who can keep up such speed.

Increasing Load of Telegraph Workers

Telegraphers, particularly in the larger offices, have to become
accustomed to roaring noises and vibrations peculiar to the telegraph
industry. The process of feeding into transmitters, for instance, is
accompanied by the monotonous banging of the printing machine.
There is the rattle of transmitters, the sharp clicking of typewriter
keys, the clangor of bells, the noise of buzzers and so on. The
speed-up is terriﬁc.

A large number of the operators in telegraph offices are women.
They pound out telegrams on multiplex or “mux” machines, feeding
tape into a transmitter at a rate of 60 or more words a minute or
from 70 to 89—and sometimes more—messages an hour. The
transmitter is stepped up to a high rate and the operators must race
to keep up with it. A

Western Union operators in the simplex department are often
forced to work two positions simultaneously. Averages of each
employee are taken to assure’ the highest possible rate of output.
Supervisors and staff chiefs see that no one is idle and that the
workers are always “on their toes.”

Managers are also subject to speed-up. One complained that he.

had to combine the duties of porter, operator, stenographer, delivery
clerk, "call clerk, typist, telephone operator, salesman and various
others; to read bulletins from various top ofﬁcials; inspect mes-
sengers’ uniforms; dispatch them and take care of business details.

It is no wonder that many telegraph workers, from messengers
to managers, are victims of nervous breakdowns and that various
nervous disorders are common among them.

Messenger boys are of course forced to use dangerous intersections

and heavily travelled streets in the rush to deliver messages; Often
they have to ride defective bicycles in the delivery of telegrams,

because they are paid too little and cannot afford to have their

bicycles repaired.

The messenger accident rate in Western Union’s divisional ofﬁces

increased 44% between June, 193 3, and June, 1934, ofﬁcial records
show. For the system as a whole they increased 33% and in
district offices 38% in the same period. That “Defective bicycle
equipment has been prevalent as a cause for accidents,” is recognized
by the company, but the company refuses to acknowledge that low
wages prevent repair of second-hand vehicles.

Workers Begin to Organize

Western Union has “always taken an attitude of open opposition
to the membership of any of its ‘essential employees, especially those
working the wires,’ in any labor unions which would subject them to a

‘ ‘strike order either for their own beneﬁt or sympathetically for the

beneﬁt of others’,” writes Alexander M. Bing in his book War-Time
Strikes and Their Adjustment, quoting a company statement of 1918.

Union members or those attending union meetings were ﬁred; a
secret service department was employed to spy on workers; and
workers were discharged by Western Union just before reaching
pension age. We have the admission of Newcomb Carlton, before

the Congressional Commission on Industrial Relations in 1915 that:'

“We do not disguise the fact that we do have special agents” to spy
on workers and that “men have been discharged from the Western
Union since I have been there for membership in the telegraphers’
union.” As early as I9II and 19.12, the hearings further revealed,
telegraphers in St. Louis, Sioux City, New York City and Buffalo,
for example, had been discharged because of union afﬁliation.
During 1918, in common with other trade unions, the Commercial
Telegraphers Union began an organization drive. They were en-
couraged by the promises of the National War Labor Board which
—like Section 7a of the NIRA in 193 3, and in almost the same
1anguage——decreed.: “The right of workers to organize in trade

unions and to bargain collectively through chosen representatives is

recognized and affirmed.” (But the Board also ruled that: “There
should be no strikes orlockouts during the war.”)

TEL AND TEL
THE TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH WORKERS *
By HY KRAVIF

Pick up almost any newspaper or magazine. There you will ﬁnd
attractive advertisements telling you that the telegraph is “the nerve
system of world commerce and trade”; that with the telephone came
the “dawn of a new era‘ of business civilization,” outdistancing the
“swift ﬂight of seconds.”

These typical advertisements are intended for consumers and
potential consumers of telephone and telegraph. They aim to im-
press readers with the distances that can be covered in communica-
tion and to show how the company is “devoted” to the interests of
the public. They are written to create “good will” and to get the
business.

But there is another side of the picture which the communications
companies do not care to advertise, the conditions of the 350,000
workers who make possible the operation of telephone and telegraph.
What are their wages, their hours of work? Many suffer from
unemployment; what protection do they have against it? What of
the workers’ attempts‘ to organize and of the companies’ relations
to their employes? What is the signiﬁcance of President Roosevelt's
Communications Act of 1934?

This pamphlet approaches these questions and the industry as a
whole from the workers’ viewpoint. But to understand the forces
lined up against the workers, we must ﬁrst look into the companies.

Communications services occupy a strategic position in the nation’s
economy, especially in time of war. More than any other large
industry, communications is characterized by outright or near-
monopolies. _

The Bell Telephone ‘System, for example,‘ with assets of over four
billions, is the largest private business in the world. Its monopoly

, position permits it practically to dictate rates despite “regulation.”

Four corporations and their subsidiaries dominate the three

“branches of the industry: two-way‘ telephony; two-way or wire

telegraphy; cable services and radio or wireless telegraphy.

* This pamphlet was prepared with the collaboration of Andrew Overgaard,
E. Phillips and a number of union telegraph workers whose efforts are
herewith gratefully acknowledged. .

Just as under NRA, workers took‘ the “collective bargaining”
declaration at its face value. Organization spread to both Western
Union and Postal Telegraph. After a C. T. U. meeting of teleg-
raphers in Seattle on April 28, 1918, I40 workers were discharged,
Western Union admitted. At the I918 convention of the A. F. of L.,
it was charged that at least 250 Western Union and Postal Tele-
graph workers in Seattle alone were ﬁred; and that over 1,000

unionists had been locked out throughout the country. The resistance -

of the workers led to President Woodrow Wilson’s letter on June 11,
urging both companies to accept the decision of the National War
Labor Board which was: to permit the men to join the union on
condition that they did not strike during the war and that their
grievances be left for adjustment by the Board. But even such an
anti-labor settlement was rejected by Western Union

The Government as Boss

Accordingly, the government took over operation of the telegraph
companies together with the telephone system. Administration was
placed in the hands of the Post Office Department under the
notoriously anti-labor Postmaster General Burleson. A Wire Control
Board of three government officials was appointed and an Operating
Board of four—three of them telephone company ofﬁcials and the
fourth C. M. Yorks of Western Union. What happened then is
best described by Alexander Bing—himself an employer and one of
the “dollar-a-year-men” of the government during the World War—

as follows:

The workers had hoped that Government control would result in the
removal of grievances; instead its only effect was that company oﬁicials
who had been ﬁghting the demands of the men were ‘thereby changed
into oﬂicers of the Government whose wishes it was just that much
harder for the workers to oppose. [Just as under NRA !-——H. K.] The
policy of discriminating against members and officers of the union. was,
the employes claimed, more vigorously pursued under Government than
under private control. . . ‘(My emphasis—H. K.)

Western Union workers were further incensed at the government’s
handling of the wage increases which the company had conceded
just before being taken over by the government. Increases were to
range from 5% to 15% depending upon seniority and were to be

20

.-.  _

retroactive to August I, 1918. But, to quote Bing again: “After
the Government had taken o-ver the wires, a demand for this increase
was presented to the Wage Committee. . . . The Post Ofﬁce Depart-
ment, however . . . reduced the maximum increase to Io% and
later the entire wage advance from January 1, 1919, instead of
from August I, 1918.”

As the time approached for return 0-f the telegraph companies to-

private operation, the C. T. U. called a strike on June II, 1919,
against both Western Union and Postal Telegraph. Demands were:
increased wages; collective bargaining; the right to join the union;
and reinstatement of all ﬁred unionists. In some sections of the
country, especially in the South, the strike was very effective, badly
crippling the service. In Seattle, Western Union sent a detective
to obtain the registration numbers of strikers within draft age;
they were threatened with being called to war service unless they
returned to work. i

Company Union Organized

A major factor in the defeat of the strike was the formation of the
Association of Western Union Employees in July, 1918, one year
before the strike. It is one of the oldest company unions in the
country and its whole history, literature and actions stamp it as a
creature of the employers. The Association was. designed to forestall
the growth of a real trade union, to breed “loyalty” and “efficiency,”
and to ease the way for wage-cuts and bigger proﬁts.

The famous Omaha Agreement of July 25, 1918, is still in effect
between the company and the Association. This agreement binds
the members not to strike, depriving the workers of their strongest
economic weapon. Another provision is for a check-off system
whereby the employers are able to keep tabs on workers who refuse
to “join.” Clauses I and 21 provide a form of “yellow dog” contract.
Proof of the “yellow dog” nature of the Omaha Agreement is seen
in a letter N ewcomb Carlton wrote at the time. Workers ﬁred
since January, 1918, Carlton said, would be reemployed “upon their
application and submission of evidence that they have joined the
Association of Western Union Employees. and relinquished the im-
desirable outside aﬁiliation.” (My emphasis.———H. K.)

21

 

  

Company Union’s Fake Claims

. The Association makes a great show of the periodic conferences
held with company ofﬁcials and of the “innumerable beneﬁts and
concessions obtained,” to quote its monthly organ Telegraph World.
It boasts, for instance, of “general wage increases” from July I,
1918 to January 1, 1920. But this is a falsehood on the face of it.
For we have already seen that the 1918 concessions were granted by
Western Union as a result of the activity of workers in the Commer-
cial Telegraphers Union.

After the wage increases of I919 and 1920, the company union
helped to put over a wage reduction in 1921. As President Hayes
of the “association” stated to company ofﬁcials in 192 5, “In I921
we shared with you the fall in the revenue and since that time we
have been stationary, based on the ﬁgures furnished by Vice-Presi-
dent Gallagher” of the company. (Telegraph World, October, I925.)
Hayes further admitted that between I920 and 1925 “we have been
sitting on the fence,” uncritically accepting the management’s ﬁgures
on revenue. So high were Western Union’s proﬁts in these years
that the workers were beginning to get suspicious. The company was
thinking of raising the dividend rate to stockholders from 7% to 8%
a year. To allay “unrest,” the Association went through all the
motions of “wringing” a concession by asking for “not less than a
IO per cent increase.” After the conference, September 24 to October
3, I92 5, it was announced that pay increases aggregating $3,ooo,ooo
a year, or about 7%, were to be put into effect early in 192 6. The
increase was not to go to all workers, but was to be based “on merit.”

It cannot be over—emphasized that the 1926 wage increase and
those during the war, were not a result of the Association’s efforts.
For workers in other non-company unionized industries were winning
increases at the same time, during the so-called “prosperity” years.
Western Union had to fall in line to prevent real trade unions from
signing up its workers.

Company Union Helps Employers

The outstanding fact about the recent history of the Association,
is the ease with which it was used by the company in slashing wages
20% within a year and in otherwise reducing labor standards. Pres.

22

 

 

 

Carlton’s annual report to Western Union stockholders for the year
1932 acknowledged the Association’s role in cutting wages Io% in
November, 1931, and again in August, 1932. In addition, the
A. W. U. E. during the crisis agreed to abolition of vacations with
pay, time-and-a-half for Sundays, holidays and overtime, and reduc-
tion from full pay to half pay under the Employees Beneﬁt Fund.

F. G. Burton virtually admitted that Association leaders were
afraid to submit the wage cut proposal to a referendum of the rank
and ﬁle “membership.” “A referendum meant serious, vital perhaps
fatal delay,” wrote the A. W. U. E. president in his review of 1931.

Nor can we accept the Association’s claims for the 1933 and 1934
partial wage cut restoration. Full restoration of the second Io%
out had been promised. Yet in April, 1934, it agreed to continuance
of the 5% basic reduction in the face of constantly soaring living
costs; and in November, 1933, it agreed to payment of only 75%
of vacation wages.

“ Unrest”

The restorations arose rather from the company’s fear that the
workers would join hundreds of thousands of their fellows in the
great labor struggles of 1933 and 1934. Albert Vitucci, an A. W.
U. E. ofﬁcial in New York City might declare that through the com-
pany union “unrest” “is missing” and that “the Company achieves
a stabilized state with its employees, i.e., the always horrible threat,
and wasteful act, of strike is done away with.” But Western Union
ofﬁcials had reason to fear that rank and ﬁle workers, both within
and without the Association, would take things into their own hands.
A typical intra-company communication from J. C. Willever. (No-
vember I9, 1934) demonstrates this fear:

. . . the membership at large shows increasingly a captious disposition
and a tendency to criticize the Association officials for alleged ineffective-
ness in the adjustment of individual grievances. . .

It is to be expected that in times like. the present when our organiza-
tion is being curtailed and every possible expedient is being tried to
keep our outgo well within our income, there will be a great deal of
unrest and much unhappiness and even downright hardship as the
necessary adjustments are made.

Because of this “unrest” and the “activities of would—be rival
organizations to discredit the Association”——i.e., the campaigns of

23

 

  

real unions—-—the company felt that things were getting a little out
of hand. Willever then ordered lesser company ofﬁcials: “Instead
of discrediting Association oﬁicials with employees every proper
opportunity shall be availed of to strengthen such Association
oﬂicials in the esteem of their supporting members.”

Support for Low Wage Code

Another grievance by A.W.U.E. members was the leaders’ presen-
tation of substitute provisions at the NRA code hearings in April
and May, 1934. The A.W.U.E. suggested minimum weekly wages
of $15 for a work week of 40 ho-urs averaged over four weeks;
and for messengers, minimum weekly wages ranging from $10 and
$10.50 to $12.50. Although the company union ofﬁcials pretended
to favor work-spreading, they opposed a maximum 40-hour Week
because it might “force the Company to carry an overstaff at all
times of approximately 10% to 20%”! W. C. Welch, Gulf Di-
vision A.W.U.E. president, admitted that “when it comes to mini-
mum wages, $15 per week is little enoug ,” and yet argued in
support of such wages! When Burton was queried on the lack of
detailed provisions covering messengers, he replied: “We left that
out in the interest of brevity. . .”! But later in the hearings he

 

revealed the real reason for his lack of concern-with the interests of ~

the messengers. He feared that the company might “under the
code be faced with the necessity” of increasing wages for messengers
and objected to any NRA code which “increases the operating
expenses of the company. . .” This is typical of company union
assistance to the employer.

The Association’s monthly organ, Telegraph World, mirrors its
pro-company policies. Pictures of and articles by leading com-
pany executives appear frequently. Under the headline “Chicago
Strike Cost Since NRA Set At $5,000,000,” it recently carried a
vicious article in opposition to strikes, reprinted from the reactionary
anti-labor Chicago Tribune. And the leading article of the November,
1934, issue, featured a complete account of the General Motors
Corp. company union plan.

Association leaders now complain “of the very poor attendance
which most of our regular monthly A.W.U.E. meetings bring out.”
Membership has declined from a peak of 37,683, in 1930, accord-

24

 

 

ing to ofﬁcial ﬁgures, to an average of 2 5,2 54 in the ﬁrst six months
of 1934.

Telephone Company Unions

Nearly all telephone companies have conducted company unions
at one time or another. Since the NRA, they have revived this
method of fooling the workers. The Constitution of the New
York Telephone Co.’s “Telephone Employees’ Organization” in the
Manhattan Plant Department is dated January, 1934.

In Boston, Grace Barry of the I.B.E.W. Telephone Operators’
Department charged, according to Federated Press, April 25, 1934:

Even after the operators in her district had expressed their desire to
discontinue the company union and be represented by the I.B.E.W., the
bosses got after them individually, putting each one “on the spot” by
asking her to continue with the company outﬁt.

One company union representative, Marguerite M. Hartnett of
South Portland, Maine, admitted working only about one-third of
the time in the previous six months while the company paid her
expenses on “organizing” trips. There were sometimes as many
as I 5 to 20 girls in Boston on company union work. These “em-
ployee representatives” supported the low-wage Bell NRA code as
written by the company.

Vice-President Charles S. Pierce of the New England Telephone
& Telegraph Co. admitted at a New England Regional Labor Board
hearing in June, 1934, that the “settled policy of the company was
to favor the committee organization [i.e., company union—H. K.]
in opposition to a real union. He conceded that the management
‘worked in close cooperation’ with the company union and that
‘the expenses of organizing and operating the committee organiza-
tion were ﬁnanced by the company’.” (Federated Press, June 12,
I934.) The New England Regional Labor Board ruling that the
company “has the right to announce to its employes its preference”
for the company union as against the real union, shows how the
government lines up against the workers.“

Telephone Workers’ Struggles

The Telephone Operators Department of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (A. F. of L.) arose out of

25

 

  

the spontaneous revolt of Boston telephone workers in 1912.
Like the telegraph workers, telephone workers have been faced
with spies, intimidation and bitter company hostility to unions.
Since Bell employs most of the telephone workers, those blacklisted
for union activity in one Bell company have little chance of obtain-
ing employment in its other subsidiaries.

During the .war period telephone workers struck in a number
of mid-western cities against low wages and union discrimination.
They had practically the same experiences as the telegraph workers
with Postmaster General Burleson who dictated the terms of the
strike settlements.

After being given the run-around by the Wire Control Board
in connection with the refusal of the New England Telephone &
Telegraph Co. to renew its agreement with the union, some 12,000
workers struck April 15, 1919. The strike was 100% effective, tying
up ﬁve New England States for six days. Union waiters refused
to serve strikebreakers and union taxi drivers refused to transport
them in an effective demonstration of labor solidarity.

Two-thirds of the strikers were girls and they picketed the ex-
changes for 24 hours a day. Although Burleson attempted to
alienate public sympathy from the strikers, an almost complete
victory was won. Restoration of jobs for strikers was secured;
also wage increases of $10 to $19 a week for operators and from
50 cents to 62% cents a day for plant men. Discrimination against
unionists continued elsewhere and a general strike was averted only
because an A. F. of L. committee consulted Burleson who issued
a conciliatory statement. Other strikes followed in the South, the
Middle West and on the coast. They were largely successful in win-
ning wage increases. . ' .

In more recent years the union has lacked the aggressive spirit of
its earlier years, following in the footsteps of other A. F. of L. unions
led by reactionary ofﬁcials. The workers must make of it a ﬁghting
organization, extending its inﬂuence to the thousands of unorganized
telephone workers.

Commercial Telegraphers’ Union

The Commercial Telegraphers’ Union of North America, func-
tioning in the United States and Canada, is the oldest organization

26

 

 

 

of its kind. Like other A. F. of L. unions under the thumb of
reactionary labor leaders, the C.T.U. has remained a small craft
organization made up chieﬂy of highly skilled workers. The dis-
placement of Morse operators, for instance, has greatly weakened
the union, since a large part of its membership was among them.

Membership of the C.T.U. has declined from a peak of 4,200
claimed at the 1926 convention of the A. F. of L. to 2,200 in
1933 and only 2,000 in 1934. In 1928-31 it claimed a membership
of 3,800. But the 3,800 ﬁgure for 1931 was inﬂated by about
700 so that its actual membership in that year was about 3,100.

The obstructionist activities of S. J. Konencamp, who was presi-
dent of the C.T.U. during the war years, were very similar to
the present-day sabotage of strikes under NRA as practiced by
William Green and other A. F. of L. top leaders. Konen-
camp and President Samuel Gompers of the A. F. of L. were largely
responsible for the belated calling of the telegraphers’ strike in
June, 1919, when the government was about to turn back operation
of the wire services to the companies. Had the strike been called
earlier, when the workers were in position to win large concessions,
they might have been as successful as were the telephone operators in
their war-time struggles.

In more recent years the C.T.U. has made little or no attempt
to organize the unorganized; to expose and defeat company unions;
and to lead the workers in struggle. It has failed to organize the
women and youth who now comprise a large proportion of telegraph
workers. Instead, the C.T.U. leadership has been intent on weed-
ing out militants, on conducting “red scares” and in praising
the NRA.

As late as 1931 President Powers of the C.T.U. received an
annual salary of $10,000 a year which is in sharp contrast to the
subsistence level earnings of employed workers and the army of
unemployed telegraphers. The union’s failure to organize messengers
was virtually admitted by Powers at the May, 1934, hearings at
Washington, when he said: “Messengers have been under jurisdic-
tion of the C.T.U. of N.A. by charter from the A. F. of L. for
many years, but we do not give authorization for sporadic strikes,
nor to strikes of any character until all constitutional steps have been
carried out.” (My emphasis.—H. K.)

New Unions

Failure of the C.T.U. to carry out aggressive organization cam-
paigns has resulted in the formation of three independent, militant
unions in recent years.

The American Radio Telegraphists Assn. was organized in August,
1931. It functions among commercial radio operators in “marine,
broadcast, airways, point-to—point,” according to ARTA, its official
monthly organ. Nearly every issue of this publication has told the
story of the victories recorded by the union during its brief history.
Wage increases and other improvements in workers’ conditions have
been Won through strikes and militant actions. The union co-
operates with other workers’ organizations as with the seamen’s
union in the October, 1934, strike on the Paciﬁc Coast steamer,
Emma Alexander. Wages were raised from $70 and $80 a month
to $100 and $120 as a result of this strike.

At about the same time the A.R.T.A. won wage increases of $10
a month on four ships of the Matson Navigation Co. A strike on
45 Paciﬁc Coast ships led by this union during 1934 Won for
45 radio operators‘ increases totaling $1,500 a month or $18,000 a
year. In February, 1935, a threatened coastwise strike of freight-
ship radio operators led by the A.R.T.A. won wage increases of $2 5
a month for coastwise operators; raised wages of intercoastal
operators from $85 to $110 a month; established the 8-hour day,
ﬁrst class accommodations, and hiring through the union. The

. union’s ﬁghting policy resulted in tripling its membership in 1934.

The United Telegraphers of America was organized in October,
1933, among commercial telegraph workers in both Western Union
and Postal Telegraph. The U.T.A. has carried on a persistent cam-
paign to organize the unorganized and to expose the Association of
Western Union Employees as a company tool. U.T.A. accomplish-
ments include reinstatement of Postal Telegraph workers ﬁred for
belonging to the union; abolition of extra lists and establishment of
the minimum four-hour trick; exposure of the anti-labor activities
of the companies. In January, 193 5, the union led picket lines in
front of Western Union ofﬁces in New York City to protest the
proposed merger.

Organized in January, 1934, as an independent union, the Tele-

28

 

 

 

graph Messengers Union, in February, 193 5, became part of the
United Telegraphers of America. Successful messengers’ struggles
which took place in the Spring of 1934 in Detroit, Cleveland and
Minneapolis inspired the T.M.U. to take action in New York City.
Faced with a threatened strike led by the messengers’ union, Western
Union made certain concessions: a 10% increase in errand services;
no dollar limit on books; IO cents daily allowance for bicycle mes-
sengers and the like. The T.M.U. was represented at three Wash-
ington hearings and at one of them its leader testiﬁed how he had
been ﬁred from Western Union for union activity as had the boy
who succeeded him. Picket lines in front of important Western
Union ofﬁces and similar militant actions won reinstatement of
three messengers dismissed for union activity by Western Union.

In recognition of the need for unity, all three unions in August,
1934, established a joint council and pressed for a united front with
the C.T.U. to organize telegraph workers and win better condi-
tions through struggle. Furthermore, the U.T.A. began negotiations
for a merger with the C.T.U. ‘

Tasks Facing Communications Workers

The outstanding task facing the communications workers today
is one of organization of the men, women and young workers in
the industry. For many years these workers have been herded into
company unions while thousands remained unorganized due to the
weakness of existing unions and their lack of unity.

Lack of strong communications unions controlled by the rank and
ﬁle aided the employers in putting over wage cuts and otherwise
reducing labor standards. Only the determination of the communi-
cations workers to build powerful rank-and-ﬁle-controlled unions
with a militant program of action will win better conditions in the
industry.

Already the independent United Telegraphers of America (and its
constituent Telegraph Messengers Union) has merged with the
Commercial Telegraphers Union of the American Federation of
Labor. This should result in greater unity among the workers, in
the development of a real organization campaign to secure immediate

concessions from the employers, and to destroy the company unions.

The workers in the real unions will need to ﬁght hard—

The monopolistic position of the four dominating companies is
openly admitted in The Index (January, 193 5), organ of the New
York Trust Co., which says:

Other smaller companies are engaged in providing communications
and the Government has several minor services, but in the main, these
W four companies administer the national communications system and,
V through their cable or radio facilities, communications between this
country and the rest of the world. (My emphasis—H. K.)

Telephone Trust

The Bell Telephone System comprises American Telephone 6'
Telegraph Co., a holding company, with 24 subsidiaries in the
telephone ﬁeld covering practically the entire country. Western
Electric Co. is the Bell manufacturing and equipment-unit.

, The extent of Bell’s monopoly is conclusively demonstrated from
| Interstate Commerce Commission ﬁgures on the 286 telephone com-
F panies operating in 1933. Bell had nearly 94% of the 82,086,828
miles of Wire; over 87% of the 15,400,000 telephones; nearly
90% of the total number of employes; and over 97% of the
“net income.”

Roosevelt’s Interdepartmental Communications Committee report
of January 23, 1934, cited,Bell as having “almost a monopoly in
the domestic telephone service”; independent companies, the report

$0‘ ‘.’‘-'>‘.'’

These are important and essential demands. But they will be
accomplished neither through NRA boards, nor by the “good will”
of the employers. These demands will be gained only by genuine
workers’ unions leading stubborn struggles.

Build the Unions

It is therefore necessary to establish strong committees of work-
ers in each communications ofﬁce. Organization of such commit-
tees in each telephone and telegraph ofﬁce, ship and broadcasting
station should be brought about through the widest participation
of workers in every branch of industry. This will insure the con-
ﬁdence of the majority. These committees will take up all griev-
ances of the workers and ﬁght discrimination of any sort. They
should be in clo-se contact with the executive boards or grievance
committees of their respective unions. And every union member
should carry on an extensive recruiting campaign in order to
strengthen the union.

It is of great importance to carry on work Within the company
unions where they are inﬂuential, particularly in the Association of
Western Union Employees, in order to expose them and to win
over the majority of the workers to unions they themselves control.
Within the company unions candidates can be put forward who
are pledged to the above program of action. Demands can be
made upon company ofﬁcials to restore wage cuts, and for other
concessions. Most important of all is to recruit members of the
company unions into the ranks of the bona ﬁde unions with a
view to smashing the rubber stamp, boot-licking “associations.”

Employed must join hands with unemployed workers in order
to win adequate relief from the various local and other govem-
mental agencies. They should unite to seek enactment of the
Workers Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill (known in the
74th Congress as H.R. 2827) so that the companies cannot use
the weapon of a jobless reserve army to reduce standards.

“Red Scare”

With the develop-ment of organized resistance by the workers
against the attacks of the employers, the latter always resort to
many tricks to destroy the unions and the unity of the workers.
Along with the company unions, the bosses will employ the “Red
Scare.” When they see the workers’ unions growing and ﬁghting
honestly and sincerely for improved conditions, the employers always
try to drive the workers from such unions by labelling them “Red,”
regardless of the name. In this way employers hope to split and
weaken the ranks of the organized workers in order to defeat all
attempts to achieve higher wages and better working conditions.
The “Red Scare” is thus used to cloud the eyes of the workers, to
lead them away from their main demands for improved conditions.
It is to the companies’ advantage to raise the cry of “Reds” so as
to divide inexperienced workers from the most militant and
courageous workers.

Not only do the bosses label as “radicals” and “agitators” all those
workers who ﬁght to better their standard of living, but they foster
various racial, religious and sectional prejudices to accomplish the
same end. Thus Jews are pitted against Gentiles, whites against
Negroes, Southerners against northemers, young workers against
adults, men against women. This is the customary trick of the cor-

’porations bent on destroying workers’ unions.

Communications workers must always be on guard against such
tricks. They should realize that only if all workers ﬁght side
by side with their fellow workers for better conditions——regardless of
politics, race, religious or other be1iefs—will they establish the
unity which will enable them to defeat employers’ efforts to split
their ranks.‘

declared, only “handle a small percentage of the telephone service
of the country.”

A. T. & T. was organized by J. P. Morgan & Co. and Morgan
inﬂuence has remained in control. Although no Morgan partner is
on A. T. & T.’s Board of Directors, it is closely interlocked with
such Morgan strongholds as General Electric Co., U. S. Steel ‘Corp.
as well as First National Bank and Guaranty Trust Co., both of
New York City. Directors include John W. Davis, Morgan lawyer
who with other A. T. & T. directors was on Morgan’s “favored
lists.” The Rockefellers are represented on the Board through
Winthrop W. Aldrich, president of the Rockefeller—controlled Chase
National Bank. The Morgan discount or proﬁt on three A. T. & T.
bond ﬂotations amounted to $21,125,000.

Because of its impregnable monopoly position, the Bell System
has coined hundreds of millions of dollars in proﬁts. In the six
crisis years 1929-34, total net earnings after all deductions (except
interest) amounted to $1,349,000,000, or an average of $224,333,330
each year. Dividends to stockholders reached a new high of
$368,271,024 in the two years 1932 and 1933. Total net earnings
of $182 millions in 1934 were $14 millions greater than in 1933.

At the same time the number of Bell wo-rkers was reduced from
364,045 in 1929 to only 248,497 in 1933. In 1931, the year in
which Bell ﬁred 28,000 workers, President Hoover: chose Walter S.
Gifford, A. T. & T. president, to head the national Committee on
Unemployment Relief!

Gifford’s 1933 salary amounted to $206,000; 18 other Bell officials
in the same year averaged over $48,000 each; and another 57
ofﬁcers and high salaried employes netted over $20,000 each. In
1934, Gifford also drew $206,000.

Two Telegraph Giants

Western Union Telegraph Co. in 1934 handled about four-ﬁfths
of the U. S. land telegraph business. At the end of 1933 it reported
21,261 ofﬁces and 47,798 employes. Western Union also operates
10 transatlantic cables and six to Latin America. Long-standing
contracts with many railroads provide Western Union with exclusive
station rights in return for transmitting the railroads’ messages.

On Western Union’s Board of Directors is Vincent Astor, one of
its largest stockholders. He is a personal friend of President Roose-
velt and c0ntributed,$10,000 to the latter’s 1932 campaign. Roose-

and now administrative ofﬁcer of NRA, is another Western Union

Western Union has been very proﬁtable to investors. In the
seven years 1928-34, after paying out $28 millions in interest to
bondholders, its net income after all charges totaled nearly $52
millions.

In 1932, it was revealed, 68 Western Union ofﬁcers were receiving
$900 each a month, or an average of $10,800 each a year. Average
monthly earnings of all Western Union employes, however, were
only about $90.93 in 19 3 3, according to Interstate Commerce
Commission ﬁgures.

Postal Telegraph (9 Cable Corp., with some 2,800 ofﬁces, is a
subsidiary of International Telephone <9 Telegraph Corp. It is the
second largest U. S. telegraph and cable service and is Western
Union’s most important competitor. Other I. T. & T. subsidiaries
are Commercial Cable Co. with six transatlantic cables from New
York; All America Cables, Inc., with an extensive cable network
from New York to Central and South America and the West Indies;
Commercial Paciﬁc Cable Co., operating a cable from San Fran-
cisco to Shanghai via Honolulu, Midway, Guam and Manila; and
Maclaay Radio 6r Telegraph Co. I. T. & T. also operates 19' tele-
phone and radio telegraph companies in the principal European
countries, in Cuba, Central and South America; 29 foreign and two
United States electrical equipment factories. I. T. & T. had over
72,000 employes (in all) at the end of 1933 of whom 16,800 were
employed in its U. S. telegraph and cable units.

I. T. & T. like A. T. & T., is dominated by Morgan, with Arthur
M. Anderson and Russell C. Lefﬁngwell, both partners of J. P.
Morgan & Co., on the Board of Directors. Lansing P. Reed, George
H. Gardiner and Frank L. Polk, Morgan attorneys, are directors
of I. T. & T. or its subsidiaries.

I. T. & T.’s “net earnings” after all charges, including nearly $55
millions in bond interest, amounted to about $73 millions in the
seven years 1928-34. It paid out in salaries and bonuses to certain
ofﬁcers nearly $3 millions in the ﬁve years 1928-32. Sosthenes Behn,
Chairman of the Board, drew $75,000 each year in the years 1928,
1929 and 1930, $60,000 in 19.31, $51,258 in 1932. In 1933 Behn
drew $48,585; but average monthly compensation of 16,860
I . T. 65' T. telegraph workers in the United States, including Postal
Telegraph employes, was less than $75 in 19 3 3.

Radio Telegraphy

Radio Corporation of America is engaged in international radio
telegraph and telephone service through two subsidiaries. They are
R. C. A. Communications, Inc., with 40 circuits to the West Indies,
South America, Europe, Asia and Africa; and Radiomarine Corp. of
America, conducting 12 marine radio stations with ship-to-shore
services, and ship-to-ship services.

Radio Corp. of America is also in the Morgan sphere, and has
direct connections with the Morgan-controlled Bankers Trust Co.
Rockefeller is also represented on the Board of Directors and close
cooperation has been developed between R. C. A. and Rockefeller
Center in New York City. Close ties have also been maintained
with A. T. & T. and General Electric, both Morgan-controlled.

In 1934, net proﬁts of R. C. A. Communications amounted to

$546,000 and of Radiomarine Corp. to $111,000. Radio Corp. of
America, the parent company, has been extremely kind to its top
ofﬁcers, paying David Sarnoff, president, and James G. Harbord,
Chairman of the Board, over $1,245,000 in bonus and salary for
the six years 1928-33. In the ﬁve years 1928-32, at least $2,181,000
was paid out to» R. C. A. ofﬁcials.
' Macleay Radio 6' Telegraph Co., an I. T. & T. subsidiary, is the
other large radio telegraph company in the United States, with seven
stations. It has a marine radio service with ships at sea operating
eight stations on both the Atlantic and Paciﬁc coasts; and 13 _over-
seas radio circuits to Europe, the West Indies, South America.

. Competition and‘Cooperation
We see then that four huge corporations, thoroughly dominated

by Wall Street, are supreme in the communications services of the ‘

United States. But despite the keen rivalry between ﬁnancial
groups backing the various companies, we ﬁnd also: (I) cooperation
between companies in rival ﬁnancial camps and (2) opposition
between companies in the same ﬁnancial sphere! Thus Postal and
Western Union join to protest A. T. & T.’s teletype service which

, they claim deprives them of revenue. Also, A. T. & T. has entered

the wireless ﬁeld with the radiotelephone, maintaining a dozen differ-
ent circuits with foreign countries and I9 ship-to-shore contacts out
of New York. On the other hand, Western Union has contracts
with A. T. & T. and associated companies whereby the former’s
telegrams are transmitted over the Bell System in towns where
Western Union has no ofﬁces. Also, in November, 1931, the com-
peting Western Union and Postal concerns combined to introduce
a new form of service through coordination of their printer facilities
and through publication of a common directory of printer patrons.
In 193 I", R. C. A.’s communications subsidiaries made an agree-
ment with Western Union for transmitting messages to foreign points
not directly reached by Western Union’s own cable system. In
exchange, Western Union relays Radiomarine Corp.’s ship-to-shore
messages and also picks up and delivers R. C. A. Communications’
messages. R. C. A. is a competitor of I. T. & T. wireless telegraph
services and competes with both Postal and Western Union through
its new domestic wireless telegraph service. ‘

Approaching the Merger

For ﬁve years or more there had been talk of merging Western
Union and Postal Telegraph and of “government regulation” of
telephone, radio and other communications. But it remained for
President Roosevelt to pave the way for mergers by suspending the
operation of the anti-trust laws under the N. I. R. A.

So we ﬁnd among Roosevelt’s early requests upon assuming ofﬁce
a report 0-n communications. The Interdepartmental Communica-
tions Committee then proposed gigantic communications “monopolies
under government supervision.” (See Labor Research Assn.’s Eco-
nomic Notes, December, 1933, p. 10.)

Wall Street’s reaction to this plan was immediate. The step was
one which “bankers for all of the companies are said to favor,”
reported the New York H erald-Tribune, December 14, 193 3.

Administration spokesmen cited the A. T. & T. monopoly as an
example of What was desired. It was further argued that the
proposed mergers would reduce overhead, avoid duplications and
provide a “cheapened service” to consumers. The falseness of the
“cheapened service” argument is perhaps best demonstrated by the
telephone comb-ine itself. As one of the Interdepartmental Com-
mittee’s own members observed in speaking of the telephone
monopoly’s rates, “The absence of competition . . . is probably the
major cause of such high rates.” A. T. & T. has not taken advantage
of its position to reduce rates and provide higher wages and better
conditions to its employes. On the contrary, it has used its position
to charge high rates, to proﬁt enormously and to lay off Workers.

As far back as June II, 1933, the New York Times, referring to
the proposed merger of Western Union and Postal Telegraph, pointed
out that “savings in payroll would be a dominating factor from the
business standpoint of such a deal.”

The Interdepartmental Communications Committee speciﬁcally
cited “the duplication of ofﬁces of the Western Union and Postal
companies. . . . Each duplication means two sets of managers, mes-
sengers, clerks, operators and equipment.” Exclusive of “estimates
for savings through discharges of employees . . . [and] provisions
for the replacement of such employees who left the service of either
company,” reported N ew York Times, December 15, I933, savings
through a Western Union—Postal merger “would amount to about
$20,000,000 a year at the end of three years . . .” (My emphasis—
H. K .). This $20 million a year saving plus the “savings” in payroll
from the dis—employment of additional workers, can accrue only
to the proﬁt of the companies!

Communications Act a War Measure

The United States is practically the only important capitalist
nation in which communications have not been operated under
government monopoly. This has enabled foreign communications
monopolies to best the private and competing United States com-
panies in everyday economic Warfare and in the periodic interna-
tional telecommunication conferences. Hence the United States
government was placed at a disadvantage in case of war. Here, then,
is one of the main reasons for Roosevelt’s Communications Act——to

provide a better coordinated communications set-up in time of war. ‘

Thus the New York Herald-Tribune declared: “Considerations of
economy and national defense in times of emergency are credited
with the development of sentiment for private monopolies.” And
in outlining a similar plan before the Army Industrial College on
May 4, 1933, David Sarnoff of Radio Co-rp. of America, stated:
“This program is suggested as economically sound in times of peace
[and] practicable for prompt and eﬁective transition for use in war.”
(My emphasis.——H. K.)

The Communications Act was passed on June I9, 1934. Where-
upon it was again stressed that it “Empowered the President in time
of war to take over radio and wire ofﬁces in the interests of national
defense.” This emphasis on the war aspect of the Act and the
proposed telegraph merger under which it would be carried through,
ties right in with the whole war preparations program of the
Roosevelt government.

Federal . Communications Commission

President Roosevelt appointed the seven members of the Federal
Communications Commission which began to function on July II,
1934. It took over the telephone, telegraph and cable authority of
the Interstate Commerce Commission and the radio authority o-f the
Federal Radio Commission which was abolished by the new act.
The commission is headed by Anning S. Prall who succeeded Eugene
O. Sykes as chairman. In December, 1934, it began hearings in
Washington at which employers and representatives of the organized
workers appeared.

Representatives of R. C. A., Postal and A. T. & T. all favored the
merger. It was clear that J. P. Morgan & Co. approved it. But
Western Union, a Kuhn, Loeb company outside the Morgan sphere,
has been rather cool to the proposal. Because of its near-monopoly
position, it does not have so much to- gain from a merger as Postal.

As the hearings progressed, Western Union suddenly became
solicitous of the workers’ welfare. Its ﬁrst vice—president, J. C.
Willever, stated that a merger would result in “considerable increases
of unemployment” and that the “major part of the operating econ-
omies possible under any plan for consolidation for competing
telegraph companies must necessarily come through a reduction in
