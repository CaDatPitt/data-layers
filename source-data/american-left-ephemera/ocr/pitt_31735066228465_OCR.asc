The law oppresses IIs and tricks us,
Taxation drains the victim's blood;
The rich are free from obligations,
The laws the poor delude.
Too long we've languished in subjection,
Equality has other laws:
“No rights. ” says she, “without their dntiex.
N 0 claims on equals without cause."

Behold them seated in their glory,
The kings of mine and rail and soil!

3 Whether leading the van of the ﬁghtels
In the bit-terest stress of the strife,
Or patiently bearing the burden_
Of changelessly common-_place life,
One hope we have ever before us,
One aim to attain and fulﬁl, '
One watchword we cherish to mark us
One kindred and "brotherhood still!
For our banner is raised, &c_.

4 What matter if failure on failure

Crowd closely upon us and press?

When 9. hundred have bravely been beaten,
The hundred and ﬁrst wins success!

Our watchword is “Freedom”; new soldiers
'Flock_ each day where her ﬂag is unfurled,

Our cry is the cry of the Ages,
Our hope is the hope of the World!

For our banner is raised, &c.

Long in hunger, shame privation,
Have we borne the degradation

Hope from brighter thoughts we’ll borrow;
Often shines the fairest morrow

Tyrant hearts, take warning!

Nobler days are dawning;

Heroic deeds, sublimer creeds,

Would ye win a name in story?

Strike for home, for life, for glory!

Every pain to count for nothing, every sorrow to forget.
Hearken how they cry. ‘'0 happy, happy ye that ye were born
“In the sad slow night's departing. in the rising of the morn.
"Fair the crown the Cause hath for you, well to die or well to live

-- “Through _the battle, through the tangle, peace to gain or peace to give." V

4 Ah, it may he!‘Of~t meseemeth, in the days that yet shall be,

When no slave of gold abideth 'twixt the breadth of sea to sea.

Oft, when men and maids a.re merry. ere the sunlight leaves the earth.
And they bless the day beloved all too short for all their mirth.

Some shall pause awhile and ponder on the bitter days of old.

Ere the toil and strife of battle overthrew the curse of gold

Q1

Then 'twi.\t lips of loved and lover solemn thoughts of us shall rise;

We who once were fools and dreamers, then shall be the brave and wise.
'l‘here amidst the world new-lmilded shall our earthly deeds abide.
Though our names be all forgotten, and the tale of how we died.

Life or death then, who shall heed it, what we gain. or‘ what we lose‘!
Fair ﬂies life amid the struggle, and the Caase -7fo'r each shall ehoosc

 

The Marseillaise.

And the sun has risen on a fairer day.

2 In -the shops and in the slums,

Working, suﬂering day by day,

We are making wealth for millionaires to hold;
But with joy we pledge our faith
To the cause of all who toil,

Till the better social ‘order sh-all unfold.

3 In the days that -are to be
When the Cause we love has won,
We shall labor for ourselves and for our. own;
Each for all and all for each,
And through many joyful years
We shall pluck‘ the fruit that comrades brave have sown.

JAMES P. MORTON, JR. Am——Auld Lang Syne.

1 Come, brothers, raise a hearty song,
To cheer us on our Way;
The fetters old of hate and wrong
We cast aside to-day. '

, ‘CHORUS. , '
In bands of Brotherhood we stand,
Determined to be free;
That love and justice hand in hand
May bring true liberty.

2 To all the sons of men we call,
Of every tribe and name;
The cause of each is that of all,
The hope of each the same.

CHO. In bands of Brotherhood, etc.

3 We need not ask another sphere,
In realms beyond the sky;
The reign of love iseeven here,
Behold the dawn is nigh!

No. 29. The Ninety and Nine.

ROSE ELIZABETH Smrrn. AIR—In “Gospel Hymns.”

1 There are ninety and nine that work and die

In want and hunger and cold,

That one may revel in luxury,
And be lapped in the silken fold!

And ninety and nine in their hovels bare
And one in a palace of riches rare.

2 From the sweat of their brow -the desert blooms

’And the forest before themfalls;

Their labor has builded humble homes,
And cities with lofty halls, ' .

And the one owns cities and houses and lands,
And the ninety and nine have empty hands.

3 But the night so dreary and dark and long

At last shall the morning bring; ‘

And over the land the victors’ song
Of the ninety -and nine shall ring,

And echo -afar, from zone to zone, _ A
“Rejoice! for Labor shall have its own!”-

2. But the last of the warrior kings had to die,

And his son came in to rule,

And he didn't do a thing but to comb his long hair
And act like a blooming fool.
And his son's son’s sons kept on that way,
And they didn't know enough to rob.
Till“the rest of the warriors got tired of them
: And turned them out of the job.
i For the people can be stilled
‘’ While their dinner pails are ﬁlled,
But at last comes a day
\Vhen they look the other way
And their loyalty iseihilled.

8. John D. Rockefeller is a smarter man

Than the warrior kings of old-

He takes no chances on the ﬁeld of battle,

But he rules the land with gold.

; IIe owns all the oil and the steel already
And a great university, too,

§ And all‘ the little robbers are a-shaking in their shoes
; To think what next he'll do.
And the small exploiter‘s dumb
Under Rockefeller’s thumb,
But the Socialists smile
. In their sleeves all the while,
V For they know what’s next to come.

4‘. The time is coming, and it's not far off,
: ‘When the people who do the work
Will run this nation to suit themselves
And not for the people who shirk.

The machinery then will belong to all.

‘g And the land and the railroads, too,

5 -And the labor of the people will be for themselves
‘ E .-\nd not for the proﬁt of a few. _

 Do you want to see that day?

Would You Give Ten Dollars to Have.
Socialism Come?

Capitalism will collapse soon; then will come socialism or chaos.

If scattered through the working class of America are a hundred

thousand intelligent socialists, who understand the evolutionary

process, and can help guide to intelligent action the millions of
laborers who have never found time to think, then the co-operative
commonwealth will begin in our own time.

4 These hundred thousand thinking socialists can be made in only
one way, and that is by the circulation of the literature of Interna-
tional Socialism. Capitalist publishers will not circulate this litera-

; ture at prices laborers can pay, no socialist alone has the capital

it required to do it. Over thirteen hundred socialists have put ten

 dollars each into a co-operative publishing house to do this work, and

’ 2'! is doing it. But it can do more of it with more money. Your ten

‘ dollars is needed and needed now. p I

 You will get no dividends; you will not get a chance to exploit

the labor of any one else, But you will save being exploited when

you put your own labor into ﬁnding buyers for socialist books.

Publishers’ Note to First Edition.

This book is a ﬁrst attempt at bringing together a collection of Socialist Songs

with music for the use of American Socialists. This will explain many of the most
serious defects that will doubtless appear in it, and it will also explain the -fact that
we have had to borrow more than half our songs from our English comrades. The

words and music of numbers 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 214, 18, 20,21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26,

and the words of 15, 16 and 17 are taken from the admirable book entitled “Chants 2

of Labor,” compiled by Edward Carpenter and published by Swan, Sonnenschein
& Co., of London. The remainder are drawn from various sources, only a fewbeing
original. We American Socialists are only beginning to sing. '

It is the hope of the publishers to enlarge and improve this book at some future

time, and suggestions from comrades using it will be welcome.

Note to Second Edition.

The cordial reception of the ﬁrst edition of the book and its sale within a ‘year
from publication show that we made no mistake in believing that such a. book was
required by the Socialist movement of the United States. In the present edition,
seven new songs with music have been added, without increasing the retail price.
Of these songs, numbers 30, 31 and 35 are from “Chants of Labor,”- 33 and 36 are
original, and 32 and 34 are adap-tations of English Words to familiar tunes. In the
case of number 32 an apology is due the author for the addition of four decidedly
inferior lines at the end of his last stanza. This was made necessary by the fact that
his poem consisted of an odd number offour-line stanzas. Besidse, some audiences
need to have the point of the joke explained to them. _

The ﬁrst edition of this book was criticised in some quarters as being rather too
heavy and sober, and an effort has been madeto remedy this defect by the addition
of a few lighter songs. The compiler has tried,'however, to exclude trashy music
and songs without literary merit,—his own excepted. It is of course a well known

fact that no‘ one can be an impartial judge of the merits of his own verses.
