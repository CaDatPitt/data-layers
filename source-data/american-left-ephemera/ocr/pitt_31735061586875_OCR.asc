Positive Predictions for Computers in”80s  

During the l980's, every-
day life will undergo a
drastic change. This change
will be due to an explosion —
not a nuclear explosion or a
population explosion — but
a technological explosion in
which microprocessors, mini-
computers, and large—scale
computers will literally
burst into the daily lives o
most people. ,

PRESENT/FUTURE

The technology governing
computer processors is ad-
vancing at such a rate that
the computing power that once
required a room-sized machine
to harness it can now be
obtained from an integrated
circuit l/l0 the size of a
postage stamp. This
technology will continue to
advance at an even faster
rate in the future. But
whereas in the past these
advances directly affected
only those people who actually
used computers, i.e., large
industries, business, schools,
or government agencies, in
the future the advances will
affect everyone.

ﬂanifestations of this

'coming explosion already,

exist. The electronic,
round—the—clock bankteller,
the bar—coding of prices on
consumers goods, and the
computerized placing and
processing of orders in the
local discount store are a
few examples. In the future,
the consumer will deal with
more "point-of-sale" computer,
terminals in their everyday
transaction at banks,
department stores, ticket
agencies, etc. These pointr
of4sale terminals can transmit

the information resulting from i

a sale to the central
processing computer
immediately, giving the
retailer better information
and control over sales
volumes, inventory, etc.
The net result should be
better response to consumer
needs, and, hopefully, a
reduction of cost to
consumers. E;

IN THE HOME

Perhaps the greatest impact
of the computer will be felt
right in the home. Micro-
processors, which are in the.
class of smallest computers
in terms of size and power,
may soon be controlling most
household appliances, giving
birth to the "smart" coffee-
maker or the "intelligent"
home environment system.

This system, for example,
might measure and regulate
temperature, humidity, and
other environmental conditions
on a room—by—room basis.
Examples of such "smart"
systems have already appeared.
Computerized maintenance
checks for cars, micro-
controlled stereo components,
multi—function watches and

' calculators are just a few

examples. There is currently
on the market a computerized
controller for all the
electrical appliances
connected to your home wiring
system. with this controller
you can selectively turn on
or off any light or household
appliance, or brighten or dim
any lights in your house.

The microprocessor itself as
marketed by Radio Shack and
small retail computer stores
has become a household
appliance, mostly for
education and entertainment.

" Does anyone recall how to think?"

As the users of these
"appliance" computers become
more familiar with their
potential capabilities, they

will be increasingly used and
relied on to help organize
and plan the complexities of
daily life.

MICROPROCESSORS

Microprocessors have only
a limited amount of power.
will the average person be
able to gain access to the
computer power of’a large
computer? If the large
computing source exists, all
that is needed to take
advantage of it is a
communication system, that
is, a method to transfer
information between you and
the computer, and some way
to display output from the
ycomputer. What is
intriguing is that most of
the components of this system,
already exist in every home.
Information, or data, can be
transmitted between you and
a computer over existing
telephone lines. Information
from the computer can be
received and displayed on a
standard televisionxset.
Thus, using your telephone
dial or pushbuttons to
enter information, using
existing telephone lines
to transmit the data, and
using your television to‘
display the information, you
have almost all the components
of a total information network.
what is missing are interfaces
between these components,
which still need to be devel-
oped and marketed. Also
missing is the computing
source, which is what makes»

‘this network of any interest.

The major advantage of a
large computer over a
microprocessor is the amount
of information that can be
stored. Such an information
network would give the
average person access to more
information than ever before
possible. The possibilitiesp,
include on-line telephone
directories, newspapers,
magazines, whole books,
encyclopedias, dictionaries,
shopping catalogues, films,
etc. Besides Just viewing

work could also do his/her
banking, shopping, receive
his/her mail, or take a course,
all at the touchoof the phone.

IN ms wommnct

Moving out of the home and
into the workplace, we see
the integration of computer
and manufacturing processes
changing the role of the
average factory worker. A
recent article in a manu-
facturing industry magazine
predicted the coming of the
‘"pushbutton" factory, in which
‘hierarchies of computers ,
control all the manufacturing
functions of the factory.
Mini-computers and micro-
processors, for example,
control the operation of the
furnaces, rolling mills, and
other basic processes. They
"report", i.e., transmit,
data concerning their
operation, to higher level
computers that perform
production scheduling,
inventory control, quality
control, maintenance control,
and other plant-level
functions. These, in turn,
report to management—level
computers that perform sales
order processing, invoicing,
forecasting, personnel
administration, etc. Such

complete systems are relative—

ly new to American industry,
but have been in use by our
foreign competitors for some
time, and yielding increased

productivity, lower costs, and

, higher profits. Thus, to
stay competitive, American
industries will be forced to
develop more fully automated
manufacturing processes.

  AUTOMATION?

In the past and present,
the issue of automation,
particularly factory auto-
mation, has been a highly
emotional one. Most workers
regard the introduction of
computers to their jobs with

-fear, apprehension, and’

distrust. The computer is C’

 

viewed as a threat to their
very existence, maliciously
promising to displace them
in the industrial process.
This can be a realistic view,
but it is not the only view.
I would like to consider a
more positive View of this
situation. An increasingly
automated workplace can
release the worker from the
tedious, monotonous, and
especially dangerous tasks
that consume his/her time.
The worker can then assume a
more creative, and thus,
productive role.
not be lost as a result of
automation, only redefined.
These benefits can only come
about if the designers and

Jobs should.

implementers of computerized
control systems apply a
concerned conscience to

their efforts. They must
ensure that the result of
automation is not to degrade,
displace, or dehumanize the
worker, but rather to give
him/her a more productive,
creative role which retains
or even increases initiative
and responsibility. The
View of the 80's as a time
of increasing computer
technology is not to be
feared, but anticipated and
even rejoiced.

when at the last Mill Hunk Her-
§lg_organizational meeting they
asked for a volunteer to write
"something for the close-out issue
on the l970's, I didn't realize
what I had gotten myself into
until I sat down and began to
gather my thoughts. There is a
lot to say. we are going to some
I hard places. I hope that my

thoughts will help you through
the l980's. The things I am
going to tell you took years

and travels half way around the
world to learn and figure out.
They are the fruits of the inner
labors of many people from many
countries and‘many past days-of
my life. People who journeyed
through many ordeals. People

who have not slept through the
20th Century. People who were
wide awake in the l960's. 7

People who dispersed throughout
the world in the l970's. People
‘who stand ready to help in the
l980's.

To comment on the l970's past
.and the l980's coming, I tried
to direct my perception to a ,
high place. An inner high place
where I could climb up to look
.out on the horizon to see what
is coming so that we need not
travel blindly on the terrain to
which we are all going. when I
got to that high place, much to
my surprise I found myself look-
ing in the wrong direction. I
was about to turn around when I
realized that my orientation
provided many clues about where
we are going. where we have been

past events of the 20th Century

' will tell us things if we look

at them with the intensity of
people whose lives are at stake:
That is the starting point for
anyone who wishes to understand
anything about the 20th Century.
That feeling known to many hapless
soldiers of the nations. The full,
total and complete realization
that one's life is at stake. The
lives of one's children. The work

of the labor of one's inner and
outer hands. It is all at stake,
and without that realization, your
chances aren‘t worth a plug nickel.
You would have miles to go down
a road others had already traveled
in the l960's.

You must look closely at the
events of the 20th Century, for
in them is the Voice. The Voice
of something unknown to you; Some-
thing unknown to all of the Presi-
Something
unknown to the Pope, all of the
priests and ministers in all of
the churches and great cathedrals.
Something unknown to the professors
in the great halls of learning.

None of these Eeople,can.help
you. None of

hem will be of any’
use to any of us where we are
going, because none of them has
been of any use where we have '
already been. what did any of
them do to help the first
soldier to die in August l9l4 or
the last soldier to die in
Vietnam? They are of no use

to you. You must know that

if you and your children are

to even have a prayer where

we are going. You must learn

to think for yourself. If you
are still waiting for one of
those people to help you, you
are going to have some rude
awakenings in the l980's.

For if the history of the 20th
Century teaches one thing, it

message: do it now, do it fast,
and do it well. The l970's

were for the slow of wit, the im-
perceptive, to catch their breath.
Those years gave us the last
mercy the Universe will have

upon us. In the l980's, you hadi
better draw some conclusions

and prepare. ‘If you miss the
l980's, you won't stand a *
chance in the l990's, for those
years are going to test us on
what we have learned in'the 20th
Century. I know this because

I have learned something which

is yet unknown to the politic-

_ians, the clergy and the educators.

Something being passed from person
to person across the face of the
earth. I know what year it is.

It is not l979 at all. It is

another year, and the knowledge ‘I(:)

of the year is the knowledge of
the understanding of the 20th
Century. The understanding of
what years and dates foretell
many things and how all of the
events work.

THE HoLLowMEN  

1925 I s

It was the year l899, and I
was writing for a mythical paper
called the Mill Hunk Gazette, I
sitting in an oak-paneled office
at a shutter-top desk. As I
pondered my assignment to writei
about the prospects for the com-
ing 20th Century, 1 stroke my ‘

, great handlebar mustache.
Looking out my window, life
seemed peaceful and quiet enough.
‘I could see a young woman in a
long skirt and high hat standing
gwith a young child in school
coat and cap in the gaslight.
There were budding evidences of '
new vigor and enterprise all
around. ‘The Steel City had
years to go, but it was being
‘built. The molten pig iron and
coal and coke were as veins and '
arteries being fashioned, ones
that would not only steel a city
but also a nation. A great steel
crucible that would forge the
weapons of war of the coming
20th Century. A crucible of
the earth womb of the guns yet
to be born. A century that would
itself be a crucible of men.

Yet how could I foresee the
events lying out in_the darkness
as some ice flow from regions I
below out in the mists before_
the Titanic. That sinking .
itself, still out in the uncharted
waters of the unknown would be-

~ come the great general all-pur-

pose allegory for the 20th
Century. .

The world had known peace for
almost forty years. The American
Civil war was now known to the

new generation only through novels.

Europe had been self—righteous-
ly confident of itself and its
ways. who could doubt its
magnificance? In the Paris,
Berlin and London of l899, all
was sun and light of itself.
People went to Mass.» They hung
pictures of their kings and queens

~ on their walls. They talked in
cafes about the International
or the new Impressionist
painters. The Franco—Prussian

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

war of l87l was something only
talked about by those interested
in the data of steel cannon
versus iron cannon, and of
course a few military planners,
and perhaps a few overly
enthused patriots in Alsace~
Lorraine. 1
The 20th Century was coming.

The great century in which
scientific progress promised
solutions for the age-old

ills of the human race; war,
poverty and disease. People
who mentioned anything about
the underlying nationalism,
militarism and colonialism
beneath the surface of it all
were nuisances and could be
dismissed as unsuitable dinner
companions.‘ g

All would be sun and light, as

it would be in May of l9l0 as
nine kings rode together in the
funeral procession of Edward
VII of England. All of the kings
would ride together in scarlet
and blue and green and purple.
The new king, George V, would
take up the dress sword of the
monarchy. There would ride
Kaiser William II of Germany
and other kings and princes of
Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria,

H. Belgium, Holland, Saxony,

Hesse, wurtemberg, Baden and
Bavaria. There would be Grand
Duke Michael, brother of the
Czar of Russia, and former pres-

’ ident, Theodore Roosevelt. And

of course a tall figure with
green plumes waving from his
helmet, Archduke Frantz Ferdi-
nand of Austria. ‘

As I sat in my little office

»in a city across the sea in l899,

how could I have known that that
day would be ahead of us; a day
that would mark not just a
funeral procession for a way

of society, order and govern-

, ment that would crash down in the

greatest war mankind had yet

experienced. A war in which there
would be 8,538,315 killed and
2l,2l9,452 wounded. A war that
would become fixed in a terrible
agony within its first thirty

days in August l9l4. A war of
four years in which 1 out of

every 28 people in France would

die, 1 out of every 32 in Germany,l
ll out of every 57 in England, l

out of every l07 in Russia. The
awesome legacy of those first
thirty days of the Battle of

The Marne. The days that would
father the days of the next four
years that would be called the
First world war.

As I sat in my little office
looking at my paper, ready to
write, how could I have known
that out of such a devastating
tragedy would come one even
worse. How could I have known
that a Bavarian corporal of the
First world war would achieve
absolute control over a nation
of 50,000,000 people and lead
the world into a blood bath during
which 50,000,000 would die and
men would learn a secret at
the very essence of the nature
of the Universe and fashion it
into a weapon that could des-
troy an entire city with the
heat of'a thousand suns?

 

And there fell upon men
a great hail out of heaven,r
every stone about the weight
.of a talent...and the cities
of the nations fell...
Revelation l6:l9-2l

.j.._—.: 
 —

I could hear the wind outside

my window and the trees blowing
on the night wind before a clouded
moon in the year T899. I sat and
toyed with my pencil and tried

to gather my thoughts to write
about the coming 20th Century.
How could I have known that men
would unleash a terrible power
that they would not be able to
control in the number and sheer
power of destruction of the
weapons which it would enable
them to create. That the two
most powerful nations on

 

 

the face of the earth would-have
‘5,000 missilesand 14,000 nuclear
» warheads aimed at the greatest
cities of the world as military
targets?

How could I have sat at my
desk and foreseen any of thlz, d
trying to look ahead one hun Fe

A day that would be warm an_ I

MICHAEL

I am writing this on October
20, 1979 in the hope that some
of you are thinking about what is
happening around you. That
you are freeing yourselves and
your thinking from the influences
of the mindless who have set
themselves up over you. That
you will begin to see with
your own eyes what is happening
right in front of you. You
must begin to search for the
secret of the 20th Century.
Thousands and thousands of
people did their homework in
the 1960's. People who now
know. People who got out of
the schools and unversities and
churches and began to search.
Combat soldiers in Vietnam,
war protestors, hippies and
straights. People who know
that the time foretold 3,300
years ago is upon us. This \
is it. This is the real thing.

 

when ye therefore shall see the
abomination of desolation spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, stand
in the holy place, (whoso readeth
let him understand), . . . '

St. Matthew 24‘ :15

through the l980's, although
I could be wrong. There will be

It will tell you many things.

Remember the Princes of Meshech

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

For nine months I have
labored on a book in memory
of the 51,126 American soldiers
who were sent to their deaths
in Vietnam. I have done this
in memory of the 303,000 who
were wounded. I have done
this in memory of the sincerity
of the protestors. I have done
this in memory of the ordeal
of my generation. I have done
this because through all that
suffering and sorrow great
knowledge has been given to this
nation. It has come in a way
I cannot fully understand.

But it has come.

The motion picture The Deer
Hunter tells you the secret of
the 20th Century. It tells
you clearly and simply. I was
astonished. There are 3,300
years of knowledge in it.

Many scenes that tell many
things. But the secret of the
20th Century is all contained
in the final scene. You must
know who is sitting at the
table. Your life and the lives
of your children, the hopes of
mankind depend on our knowing
who is sitting at the table.
You must know their identities.
You must understand the meaning
of where they are sitting. It
is not enough to know who ’
Kurtz in Apocalypse Now repre-
sents. That will not help you
enough where we are going. For
we are all going down that river

where waits the Heart of Darkness.

Every man, woman and child on
this planet is going down that
river into something immense.
But there is still time to gain
understanding and prepare. It
will be twelve years before we
reach the bridge..

3

There is still yet time. You
must know who is sitting at
the table. Everything depends
on it. For in doing so you
will know the meaning of the
three deer and the mountain.
You must know their meaning if
you are to even have a prayer
where we are going. For

most of you it will be your one
chance to learn what thousands
and thousands of people on the
earth already know.

Everything as I see it is
made clear in my book. Suffice
it for now to tell you who just
one persbn is in the movie.

You must know who Nicholas is.
You must remember his eyes

at the last instant as the
trigger is pulled. For
Nicholas is you. Nicholas

is Man.

to a new contract which would lower
labor costs. In other words a
pay cut. Terrific--just what the
workers need at this time of year.
will the heating utilities cut the
rates on their monthly bills? what

A course, none of these will take a

But wonderful U.S. Steel feels
their stockholders increased wealth

ers in Ambridge survival, or for

bridge's survival.

Perhaps this is just a dry run
for when U.S. Steel pulls out of
Homestead. After they wreck Am-
bridge they'll have to come up
with some good public relation
lines to justify the phase out.
Practice makes perfect. whatever
P.R. they come up with for Am-
bridge they can polish and reuse
for Homestead. Either way the
workers lose. Loss of jobs or pay
cut, weakening of union, loss of
other benefits, and lots of hard
times ahead. '*_

when I was a kid I used to get hurt

Fonda-Hayden Support

;Consumer- Worker

On Monday. Oct.8,1979
Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden
stopped in Pittsburgh dur-
ing their national speaking
tour. They participated
in a forum at St. Mary's
Center entitled, ‘Labor for
Solutions to Unemployment
Inflation, and Energy.‘
Hayden opened his debate
with the irony of meeting
in a hall which is soon
to be devoured by PPG's
multi-million dollar
structure proposed for
Market Square in down-
town Pittsburgh.

The body of Hayden's
speech outlined symtoms
and causes of inflation
and unemployment.

-Cities have become
gigantic networks of sky-
scrapers; enveloped in a
web of paperwork.

-Ghettos have become
mere statistics. People
living in ghettos are
ignored.

\.

Olipham. The Washington Star

-Continued corporate
profit rather than wage
increases cause recession.

-Demoralization of
peoples‘ work ethics; for
the'first time in the US_
the next generation will
be worse off than the last.

The thrust of Hayden's
talk called for the end of
the power control by bil-
lion dollar business. The
worker must bring the B111
of Rights to work to creat
economic democracy as well
as political democracy.

 

;Yon, rlrare applying fr
temporary government assistance to overcome setbacks I
have snﬂered in the dog-eat-dog arena of the market place!’

Politicans must start to
answer to the consumer and
not to big business; some-
thing the Democratic
Party has failed to do.

Jane Fonda, amidst
thunderous applause, took
the podium next. Her
.first charge was to ana
nounce a change must occur
in the political climate
in the US. She tried to
dispell myths that in-
creased workers' wages
cause inflation by .iting
the argument that oil
executives salaries rose
20% in the last two years.

She stated, as an
actress, she attemtps to
tell the laborers’ story
to everyone.‘ She tries
to reconstruct the heroism
of workers because this
part of US history is
left unexamined in public
education.

Following this line
of reasoning, Fonda sum-
med up her new movie,
Nine to Five.

The beginnings of worker
decision making power which
provides workers in Germany with

almost an equal voice in management
affairs is called “co—determination."
workers and their unions fought

for the right to make manage-

ment decisions at the workplace
after world war II. They insisted
upon that right after experiencing
the Nazi period and the part-
nership that existed between the
Nazis and employers. Hitler

banned unions in l933. Scores of

Recently, the German Federal

highest court, ruled that Germany's
Co-determination Law is con-
stitutional. The law was

enacted in l976. The court

ruling defeated the argument of
German employers and their
associations that the law

violates propertv rights,

freedom of association, profes-

sional freedom, and freedom

of economic action.

_ The Co-determination Law
provides that workers must have
half the seats on the super-
visory board. Such boards _
decide long-range company *
policies and appoint the company '
managers who run the plant on

a day-to—day basis.

The unions expressed satis-
faction with the court ruling.
They are not, however, satisfied
with the Co—determination Law.
The unions state that there
are loopholes in the law t’
which need to be plugged—up. m

Phhiladelphiia-.'The City‘ of Brotherly Love?

Philly is a city of images.
The Liberty Bell, Independence
Hall, the Ben Franklin Bridge,
all stand out in your mind.

But there are other images,
too. Forty thousand

abandoned houses, streets dug
up, handcuffed prisoners being
shot in the back and a blockade
of a handful of Black activists
by 1000 cops for 54 days--
houses in the neighborhood
sandbagged with sharpshooters
staying primed at all times,
residents forced to show passes
to get through the steel
barricades surrounding their
homes, $3.5 million spent to
arrest 18 Blacks for health
violations and weapons charges.
The Warsaw Ghetto comes to the
City of Brotherly Love.

‘ As a native son of Philly all
these images have been a part of
my experience., As a child I
visited Independence Hall and
Betsy Ross‘ House. As a grandson
.I've seen my grandmother become
trapped in a city that is dying.
My grandmother still lives in
the house where my mother was
born. But today, it is one of
the few houses on the block that
is still inhabited. And ever
since she was robbed at knife-
point by a bunch of young

V hoodlums who got in her house by

going across the roof of the
abandoned house next door, she
has lived in a cage. Iron bars
enclose all the doors and
windows to protect her meager
social security check.

This is Philly today. The
town that Frank Rizzo claims is
safe while the Federal agency
ranks it 3rd in crime in the
country. For Rizzo the answer
is simple, "The streets in
Philadelphia are safe; it's
the people who make them unsafe".
Between the cops and the crooks
the people don't stand much of
a chance. That's why few people
wander into Philly after dark.

Some people do make the
mistake. A Black co—worker of
mine told me of how his wife was
assaulted by the Philly cops
when she was involved in a
traffic accident and called for
help. The help she got from
the police resulted in her
spending the night in the police
station and the next couple of
months recovering from the
injuries. She would not file
charges against the cops because
after having lived through the
experience once, she wasn't
willing to take another chance.

To list separately the
incidents of police abuse in
Philly would fill the issues of
this paper for the next year's
copy. Shootings and beatings
are as frequent as auto accidents.
Take the case of Cornell Warren,
a 19 year old Black man. Warren
was arrested for an alleged
traffic violation, and beaten in
a police station where his life
was threatened. The cops,
according to an eyewitness, said,
"Before this night is over, you're
going to die, nigger". When he
was taken to Police Headquarters,
Warren ran from the police, while
handcuffed. The cops subdued him

and while he was on the ground,
still handcuffed, they shot him
in the head.

In the face of all this
Rizzo still claims he's clean.
He still claims to represent
the guy in the rowhouse. The
same Rizzo who has protected
his murderers in blue. The
same Rizzo who spends $400,000
for a house on a $40,000 a year
salary. The same Rizzo who has
seen such staunch allies as
Buddy Cianfrani, Augie Salvitti,
Joshua Eilberg and James
O'Neill convicted for such
crimes as extortion,
racketeering while in office,
receiving kickbacks. The whole
time he continues to uphold them
as upstanding public servants.
The only thing that Rizzo has
in common with the man in the
row house is his support from
the same banks that hold the

mortgages. ‘
I6

25

Even though Rizzo lost his
.chance to run for mayor again,
his police are still busy at
work. Recently there was a
"gas riot" in Levittown PA,
that made national news. While
I wasn't there and don't know
anyone who was, a friend of
mine who works at Fairless
Works (USS) says he heard what»
happened from guys at work who
were there. Seems on the first
night that truckers, angry gas
customers and residents joined
to block a key intersection in
town. Some 2000 people, mostly
orderly, were demonstrating the
frustration that we all feel
at the way we 're getting
fleeced at the pumps. Anyway,
all sorts of cops were called

up from the surrounding area‘
and evidently someone thought
that it would be appropriate to
call in the Philly cops (the
city being some 25 miles away).
When they got there things were
disorderly but still under
control. The Philly cops
proceeded to charge into the
crowd, beat onlookers and
generally turned the display of
outrage at the gas rip-off into
another Philly police riot.
People were dragged off their
porches, pregnant women beaten,
people arrested for no cause.
This quiet working class
community was lit up for several
nights with the fires of over-
turned cars. This was Rizzo's
arm reaching out.

The Justice Dept. suit is still

another chance to cut off that
arm. The citizens of Philly
have already done that in their
city by overwhelmingly rejecting
a city charter change that would

ahave enabled him to run for office
~again.

But now the Justice Dept.
suit must not only be made to
see that Rizzo pays for his
crimes but must also
dismantle the administrative
machinery that made it'so,
easy to get the power that

he did. Those people who

see Rizzo as a road to the
future should wake up to the
future of iron cages,

bloodied streets and political
pay-offs that Rizzo has shown
to us today.

NOTHlNG’S TRIVIAL  

No violation of the Constitu-
tion can be considered trivial,
as the Pittsburgh Press editorial
of Sept. l8 (“The Pope and the
ACLU") labels the American
Civil Liberties Union's efforts
to block Philadelphia and Boston
‘from building a platform for
Pope John Paul II to say a mass.
How trivial are these recent

' calls to the Pittsburgh ACLU

office?

. A 14-year old young woman
is charged with "obstruction of
traffic“ on her way home from
the library.

. A reporter is asked to
reveal under oath her sources
for a story on public officials.

. A man jailed in an adjacent
county is shackled to the bed
with chains.

. A Muslim woman observing
religious practice by wearing a
head-covering is threatened
with dismissal from her job at
a public school.

). A foreign student who
interrupted a police beating is

I himself rendered unconscious for

his concern.

. College women seeking a
public park permit in a nearby
city for an anti—draft rally
get a lecture and no permit.

. Police fail to respond to
a rape victim's call when the
attacker is identified as a
relative of a local official.

These cases aren't dramatic
enough to be cited on the 6
o'clock news or on the editorial
pages. However, these are the
everyday needs of individuals
in our community which are being
met by the ACLU.

Over 8,000 Pennsylvanians
provide for our presence through
their membership, money and gifts
because all the above calls are
from the public, not from
members. we are here to them
today and tomorrow in our
commitment to civil liberties.

LET US BEGIN BY COMITTING OUR-

NEIGHBORHOOD cop

I was born ad grew up in the
Homewood section of the City of
Pittsburgh.

During the time of Hg childood,
there used to be a neighborhood cop
in most all sections of the City of
Pittsburgh. .

In the larger neighborhoods,there
were several police officers and each
had his own section of thatdistrict.

At this time he was usually anﬁdr
dleaged.ma with a friendly smilecri
his face, most of the tine.

He made it a point to know per-
sonaly all business men on his beat.
He also knew most all the families.
And over a period of time he watched
their children growing up. The young
children he seen playing in the
school ground.were the same children
he watched graduate from highschool.

This nam.was nore than just the
neighborhood cop on the beat. At
thnes he was known to help deliver a
baby in soueone's hoe, he would
even drop a letter in the corner _
mail box for one of the elderly cit-
izens, or help with a heavy shopping
ba .

,gNow don't get HE wrong! He was no
saint from the heavenly precinct. He
knew who the local nmbers writers
were, he knew the good and he knew

the bad.

So the first time you got caught
stealing candy at the local confec-
tionery, you.had to sweat it out,
whether or not he would tell your
dad the next time he seen him.

And if you.played hookey from
school, he was the one person you
didn't want to run into.

And if by chance you were to get
youself into some Here serioustrou-
ble, the greatest percentage of the
tine it was not in your neighborhood
but someone else's, and that would
leave you at the mercy of a cop who
ddn't know you, and resented the

-fact you came into his neighborhood

and caused trouble, which.nore than
likely would result in your first
introduction to juvenile court.

That was years ago. I now am a
grown nan, married and have a fami-
Ly of Hy own. I left the City of
Pittsburgh and.live in Penn Hills

' ' I was going to raise my
family in a better environent.

I just left a local hospital
where one of Hg son's received
stitches to his head and left ann.
I was told that he resisted arrest
while local police were in the
process of breaking up a teenage
beer party.

What ever happened to the neigh-
borhood cop?

THE MILL HUNK HERALD 916 MIDDLE 51'
PITTSBURGH, PA.‘|521g-_'3

Welcome to the 1980's and the
Mill Hunk Herald. Perhaps you're
wondering what the hell this is
all about. Good. Read on.

This paper was started about a
year ago by people who were
frustrated by the way all other
publications are run. From the
dailies to the union journals,
everything is controlled from
the top——democracv be damned.

The Mill Hunk Herald is trying

to be different. It is set up

so that the rank and file

readers will control it, not

merely the publishers. The

Herald is the first of its
kind———an experiment in

democratic journalism.

Here's what we mean.

What it is: a quarterly

magazine for the reports,

opinions and stories of the

average person.

What it is not: Profit making,
owned by anyone, operated from the
top—down, ass kissing, the
Pittsburgh Press.

The Name: (catchy ain't it) It was
chosen for that reason. However,
this mag is not just for mill-
workers, the title simply
acknowledges the important work they
do in Pittsburgh. The Herald is for
all working people: homemakers,
office employees, retirees, nurses,
teachers, bus drivers, bar tenders,
you name it.

who can write for the Paper:
can —~«9l people contributed
articles for this issue.l75
.different writers have had articles
appear in the Herald's first 4
issues. There are very few pro-
fessional writers involved as you can
probably tell. For this kind of
publication, polished writing style
is not ascrucial as timely and real
things to say. So what you write

and how you say it will be printed.
Finally, it is also important to

know where people are coming from.
Therefore, articles must be

signed, with your occupation and

what part of town you live in or

be accompanied by a brief and
printable explanation as to why

this must be anonymous.

How is it run? DEMOCRATICALLY!

The Herald holds periodic

editorial meetings to discuss
problems and new ideas. Decisions
made at these meetings must be

Anyone

 

ratified by subscriber's mail
ballot (see back page).* Here are _
some examples of recent decisions made
at the last meeting, December 6,
attended by 28 people.

Advertising: There is none now.
The meeting came to a consensus
that it was better to try and

sell the Herald on newsstands

and to friends for 75 cents and
hold fundraising parties, etc.

than to put energy into hawking
advertizers and thus limiting
article space and the publication's
independence. But this decision
must be ratified (or reversed)

by the ballots of the 400 plus
subscribers and new subscribers
(like yourself) before it

can be made good (again refer

to back page)

*****If you are a subscriber,

clip and mail the ballot and get
your vote in. If you are not

a subscriber, clip the ballot

and send it in with your 2 bucks!

Example #2. Subscription Price
$2.00 a year. Consensus was to
keep it there so everyone can
afford it. But suppose the
meeting voted to raise the
subscription price 150% to keep
up with OPEC and the state
legislature, that decision would
have to be ratified bv
y9u——the subscriber.
Example #3 Political Stands
There are none now. Just a
collection of individual opinions.
But suppose the meeting voted to back
a Stargell—Bradshaw ticket in
1980. That decision once again
must be ratified by mail ballot
before it can be enacted.
The principle here is democracy~—the
rule of the clear majority of whom the
Herald serves. That is how the Mill
Hunk Herald is set up. Now, try.to
imagine the Pittsburgh Press or
Time Magazine operating this way.
HOW ARE ARTICLES CHOSEN?
Herald writers and organizers are
invited to an editorial meeting.
All articles are circulated and
rated (from best to worst) by all
present. This way, those doing
lay—out know the priorities. It
may seem like a lot of trouble,
but it has turned out to be very
fair, upfront and an interesting
process.

many Congressmen and Senators are im-
pelled more by economic considera-
tions than by the nation's actual
military needs.

Defense contracts have become a
gigantic, nationwide public works
project - a form of technological
leaf—raking. hundreds of communities,
thousands of corporations and mil-
lions of workers have become pathet-
ically dependent on the Pentagon for
prosperity, profits and jobs. The
American economy has become as hooked
on “defense” as a junkie on drugs.
In response to anxieties of members
employed in the defense-related in-
dustries, unions have usually been
in the vanguard of support, beating
drums and leading the cheers for the
Military's annual raid on the U. S.
Treasury.

The time has come to inform union
members of the facts, and show them
where their real economic and social
interests lie.

FACT: Military spending gener-
ates more unemployment than jobs.
Defense industries are so capital
intensive it takes a billion dollars
to create 45,800 jobs. By compari-
son, a billion comitted to the ci-
vilian sector creates from 58,000
jobs in mass transit to 98,000 in
public service employment. Every
dollar taken by the Pentagon leaves
less for other purposes. .Senator
Ted Kennedy has found that "defense"
causes a net decrease in jobs in 26
states with 60 percent of the popu-
lation.

Many experts contend that $30
billion could be cut from the $128
billion Department of Defense budget
without risk to the nation's securi-
ty. If applied to civilian or pub-
lic service sectors this $30 billion
would create between 414,000 and 1.2
million new jobs, over and above the

Spending cripples Civilian Economy-

cutbacks. The multiplier effect or
the resulting increased civilian de-
mand for civilian products would rip-
ple throughout the economy and create
still more jobs and promote the na-
tional full employment goal.

FACT: The Pentagon is a perpet-
ual inflation machine. It drives up
prices by pumping dollars, but not
goods and services, into the economy,
by siphoning scarce resources and~
raw materials into non-productive
purposes, by condoning waste, cost

contractors who maximize profits by
inflating costs, and by fueling ever

More than half the present national’
debt is directly traceable to the
Pentagon. ,

FACT: The Military drag on the
civilian economy has accelerated a
flight of American capital, tech-
nology and jobs to other lands.
with military priorities monopoliz-
ing the nation's industrial technol-
ogy, U.S. based corporations have
stepped up investment overseas.

Such corporations invested $47 bil-
lion in offshore enterprises in the
1960s. According to current pro-
jections they will invest $28.8
billion in property, plants, machin-
ery and equipment overseas this year,
and $32 billion next year and $32.6
billion in 1980. If these dollars
were invested in civilian and con-
sumer industries in the United
States unemployment would diminish
and billions of dollars now being
spent for welfare, food stamps, un-
employment compensation and other
relief programs could be saved.
addition, the formerly unemployed
people would become taxpayers, pay-
ing an average per worker of between
3-4 thousand dollars in all forms of
taxes for a total of at least three
billion dollars.

FACT: Military spending weakens
rather than strengthens the economy.
This is proven simply by comparing
the U. S. economy with West Germany
and Japan. Because the Military grab
off 26 percent of the federal budget

In

' the rest of the economy has deteri-

orated into a chronic"condi€ion of
high unemployment, trade deficits,
ruinous inflation and steadily weak-
ening currency. While making only
token contributions.to their own de-
fense, Japan and west Germany have
achieved booming prosperity, full
employment, trade surpluses, stable
prices and strong currencies.

CONCLUSION: An alternative must
be found to the death and destruct-
ion business which is impoverishing
America.

_jobs lost through defense production

The dilemma for unions is that the

people that there is a better way. ‘ f

tracts are cancelled. ,
Planned Economic Conversion means
shifting resources and facilities now
being devoted to war into production
for peace. It means, for example,

larger deficits in the federal budget vastly stepped up development-of

solar and other non-fossil energy
sources, rebuilding the nation's
once great railroad system, con-
struction of urban rapid transit,

 

‘ renovation and beautification of de-'

cleaning up the nation's air and

‘hvaterways. b?

Economic Conversion is the humane
way, the sensible way, the only way,
to get workers, communities, states
and even corporations off the hook

of defense dependency.

American workers are drafted into
defense production in the interest of
national security. Since there is no
onnection between maximum national
ecurity and the current overkill
apacity, then defense workers de-
erve better treatment than to be
-iscarded on the free market's huan
crapheap of unemployment.

 AND JUSTICE FOR ALL

As children, those beautiful,
inspiring words of the pledge
of allegiance are programmed
into our heads at the start

of every school day. "...One
nation, under.God, with liberty
and justice for all " is what

we are taught America represents.

Although this movie had mixed
reviews locally, I feel it is
an extremely important film.
It especially brought out that
our prison system is a totally
inadequate way of dealing with
crime. It propagates it.
Prison is a place for only
the hardened criminals; those
that commit hideous acts
against society. They should
be segregated and rehabilitated
on a one to one basis, given
a chance for an education or
skill and then returned on a
strict work—release program.
The petty, non—violent criminal
(shoplifter, unarmed theft,
prostitutes, small drug user)
could be rehabilitated in drug
detoxification programs and
work—release programs to pay
their debt for their crime
and instill pride as well.

But we should never mix the
hardened with the soft core
criminal

Currently there is an inves-
tigation of the Allegheny
County Jail. Fifteen inmates
have been charged in rape
alligations. Rape is a very
violent crime. why were

these rapists not segregated
from the general population?
Maybe this is why the uuclde

rate is so high for men
convicted of minor offences.
They would rather die than
go through the prison system.

Are there any judges that care?
Are~there any lawyers that care?‘
Humanity must care! we must
stress rehabilitation and not
incarceration.

wake up, Americans. A more
humane justice can be available
fgr_all, if we strive no matter
what the cost, for prison reform,
judicial reform and get back to
the united call of the pledge of
allegiance, "...One nation, under
God, with liberty and justice

Brenda resented Mike's obvious

have been more "her" centered. At

Mike deplored Brenda's obsession

NO-FAU LT DIVORCE

It is evident from the recent de-
feat of the unilateral provision of
the no-fault divorce bill that those
legislators who voted against the
provision have no concept of the

» mental anguish suffered by those peo-

ple whose marriages have died in ev-
ery sense except the legal one.

Most of these individuals are not
divorced only because the price de-
manded by the contesting partner to
end the marriage would constitute
finacial rape.

If the bonds of love and trust
have been destroyed, where is the
validity in a marriage that exists -
by force - only on paper?

No-fault divorce will not destroy
the family unit. The currentdivorce
laws have already done ancmitstanding
job of that.

Years of bitterness ad ager be-
tween a husband.ad wife canot give
the children involved ay sense of .

security, ad.neither partner isfreet

to build a new life because each is
bound to the other by legislation.

The Pensylvania Catholic Confer-
ence is strongly opposed to the uni-
lateral provision of the bill. What
gives this religious body the right
to dictate secular law to non-Cath-
olics?

The Conference certainly has the
right to encourage its members to
practice obedience to the caons of
their church, but church and state
are supposed to be separateentities.

G Patching Holes in the American Dream a 

when plants close down or
transfer part of their opera-
tions elsewhere, they leave
unemployed workers in their
wake. Delegates to the UAW
Bargaining Convention noted

the human suffering this causes
and took steps to end it.
Endorsing federal aid to
affected workers and com-
munities, they also called for
collective bargaining agreements
which would require advance
notice, transfer rights, prefer-
ential hiring, retraining, and
protection of other employee

.rights whenever plant shutdowns

or relocations occur. Contract
measures like these would make
life a little more secure for
thousands of workers. One of
them is Ed Tordoff, a parts-
picker at a GM depot in westwood,

S_Mass.

Ed Tordoff, 3l, knows all about
the American Dream.

His lost piece of it? Owning
a home. Raising kids in it.
Building equity and paying off
the retirement a firm foundation.

"when I went to work for GM,"
he recalls, “I made a plan for
our future. First, a new car.
Then more savings. There was a
lot more, but we never got past
the new car.“ 1

Unemployment struck the
again and again,
blowing holes in their dream.
Inflation delivered the coup
de grace.

“Now,” Tordoff says, "our
savings are gone. I just can't
seem to get it all back
together.: '

Two and a half years ago,
unable to save for a down payment,
Ed and Sue gave up their hope
of buying a home. They left
their duplex in Canton, Mass. and
moved into the house Sue's
father owned in nearby Bellingham.

"we pay a little rent,” Ed
says, "and we get along'well,.
but it's not like owning your
own place...

"I can see the end of the

middle-income families coming,”

he says. "One day this country”
will have just a few rich
people and a few million poor.
Already families like us are
being squeezed out of the

home market. with apartments
renting for $300 or $400 and
with everything else going up,
who can save for a house?”

The future looked brighter
when Tordoff first went to work
at GM's parts depot in westwood,
Mass. ll years ago. He was a
parts-picker, and he enjoyed
the relative freedom he had to
move around the depot. 'But
then the layoffs came. One time
he was sent home for several
months, another time for almost
a year.

“The depot used to have lots
of young workers who didn't
swallow the company line,”
Tordoff says. “They were pretty

‘militant. Through the layoffs,
GM weeded them out. It
manipulated the workforce any
way it saw fit."

On Oct. l, l974, Tordoff
punched in at the depot for the
last time in four and a half
years.

"GM wiped out the whole
second shift.“ he says.

For about a year, Tordoff
collected state unemployment and
SUB checks totalling $l62 a
week — almost as much as his take-
home pay. ' ‘ '

Then, the the fall of l975,
the real crisis hit.

“Ed's unemployment ran out,”
Sue recalls, "and I got very
pregnant. Look, I told him,.
go get work. Any work."

. -Ed got a job as an electrician
in nearby Canton; Sue found work
again, too. Six months after
their son was born, she took a
minimum-wage job at a dungaree

warehouse. But the pressure of
working and caring for two small

.children proved too great after

her mother died in the fall of
l976, and she quit.

Finally, GM recalled Ed two
months ago. He's hoping it will
be for a long enough time to
start saving for a home again.

Ed Tordoff knows many other
UAN families are caught in an

' economic crunch, some more

severely than his own.

“The layoffs I've experienced
are caused by people not buying
enough,“ he says. “They're
not buying enough because they
don't get paid enough. 50
companies cut back on production
and lay workers off.

"Throughout it all,” Tordoff
says, “the big companies go on
making profits. GM can padlock
our little depot without losing
a dime. ,It can wipe out all our
jobs and still make a profiti
because it's a monopoly.

Tordoff concludes.

“The free enterprise system
works.for everyone but the worker,"
he adds. "I'd like to think
I can retire on an adequate
pension. I like to tell Sue
we'll never have to worry -

,but there's no way I can tell

her that.“
Can something be done to

’but down the number of layoffs?

Tordoff things two remedies
would help. First, legislation
could stop companies like GM-
from arbitrarily moving whole
shifts or plants out of an area.
And second, UAW contracts
(negotiated with the automotive
Big Three and other companies)
could shorten the work-week
without any loss in pay.

"we have been putting out all
our lives for the companies,“
"Now they
have to put out for us.”

we were told that this is

west Virginia is being operated
and that this is the way
they will operate the plant
in Swissvale, Pa.

I.U. 3730 U.S.w.A. were locked
out. This was the beginning
of one of three long cold
winters.

all union activity. Until T970
when a new contract was being
negotiated and a couple of
new faces on the bargaining unit
representing the local union and
four days on the street-the com-
pany realized they had lost their
control.
. The company,not being able to
contend‘ with this situation,
decided to build another plant
.in Paw Paw, west Virginia, with
the understanding there would
be absolutely no union activity
permitted in this plant.
in 1973; itcame time for another
contract,and the plant in
west Virginia not in full produc-A

to bargain for a decent contract
and .th'iS time we went on the
street for five days

In l976 when contract time
came, there was no bargaining.

Virginia was in full production
with a full crew of non-union

The president of Vesuvius
Crucible Company had previously
sat in on negotiating contracts
himself, but being a bull
headed, demanding type of person
he is, he realized he could
not withstand the pressure, so
he hired one of the local law-

for him. .

Late in October T976 with our
contract expiring on the 3lst
we were handed a copy of_a new
contract with no bargaining
power on our part.‘ we were _
told, take it or leave it. This
is it, there will be no bargaining.

This contract in no way could
be accepted. The Vesuvius
Crucible Company wanted the men
of Local Union 3730 U.S.w.A.
to take a reduction in pay that

 

"Come in, come in, gentlemen. The company would like

to introduce a new idea in negotiations.

It was almost two years on
the street before the company
gave any indication whatsoever
that they were interested in‘
negotiating after one spokes-
man for the company made the re-
mark, "we will break this union
one way or another."

After forcing many hardships
upon the men of Local 3730 and
their families over a period
of 33 months, l2 good union
men held firm.

' This was a strike where a picket
line had been established and
maintained in one of the most
orderly fashions ever recorded
in the history of the union
movement.

The picket line was marred
with one incident, in which the
Company using circumstantial
evidence and a paranoid night
watchman to accuse one picketer
of . criminal trespass and
property damage.

They illegally discharged him, had
him arrested and took him to court,

only to be ‘thrown out not once, but

twice .

 

This company,still not satis-
fied with the action taken in
court, still refused to hire
him back after a contract was

- signed with the International,

but did agree to take the issue
before an arbitrator (waiting
for the arbitrator's decision)3*

The Vesuvius Crucible Company
offered this contract to the
men of I.U. 3730 who voted it
down 29 against, 6 for.

District l5 Director, Paul
Lewis, ordered Local Union 3730
president, Alfonse Magnotti, and
staff representative, Caleb
Scott, to go ahead and sign the
contract. So this contract was
not ratified by the rank and
file from 3730.

After 33 months on the street,f

let's face it, the Vesuvius
Crucible Company only offered

a contract to the men of local
3730 to make them the token shop’
to the union movement.

This company owns plants all
over the United States and
around the world which are all
non-union.

The President of the company
himself has been anti-union
for years. He has made that
plain, and after 33 months
on the street not being able to
break the back of all the
members of Local 3730 U.S.w.At
does not mean he will give up.
This man will still
continue to use his unscrupulous
tactics in every way he can,
and he will also continue to
demand that all plant management
do the same.

I congratulate all brothers
from Local Union 3730 U.S.w.A.

A who for 33 months withstood bad

weather and company tactics to
prove the point that there are
still good, strongmen in the
labor force that will not bow
down to company dictatorship.

and one of the affected facilities,

I stated that although he didn't know

how much his plant made for the
company, he did know that last
year "we turned a profit. We
contributed to the profitability
of U. 8. Steel"

This feeling was acknowledged
by Harry Loftus, plant supervisor
of employee relations for three years,
who said that the closing came "pretty
much as a surprise".

f This surprise, coupled with anger,
was also felt in Youngstown where’
workers at U. S. Steel's Ohio Works
had been led to believe that the
facility was turning a profit and
would be kept open as long as it was
profitable. In fact, the plant,
opened in 1898, won a profitability

pcontest last year, beating a modern

U. S. Steel mill making similar
products in Baytown, Texas.

Since February of last year,
workers and management have worked-
hard at making the plant an asset to
U. S. Steel. Operations were con-

osolidated and the work force was

reduced from 5,000 to_2,500. Steel
«production was halved and the 11 old

’ Mcconald mills nearby were consoli-

dated into six units.

"We gave voluntarily," said Robert
Vasquez, President of U. S. W. Local

our damnedest down here. The
supervisors told us we did everything
humanly possible...Now we feel
clobbered, like we've been treated
dirty. We were led to believe we
were making money, but they've taken
the money they've made here and
reinvested it in hotels, in Disney-
land. They've bought chemical
companies. They've diversified so
much, steel no longer is the big
monevmaker for them."

Workers in Ambridge, PA, also see

Steel strategy.to oppose union demand.
Several weeks ago the company gave an
ultimatum to American Bridge workers
in Ambridge and Shiffler, PA., and in
Gary, Indiana, either to accept a wage
freeze or face the fact that the
"American Bridge division will cease
to be a source of job opportunities
for steel workers." '
Workers at all three locations

rejected the corporation's proposals.
Although the Gary plant was spared,
Roderick stated that the workers "have
made their decision. We as a company
must live with and respect this
decision. We are not asking for any
reconsideration." The Ambridge plant
was then ordered closed, ‘

 

marginal plants, diversifying into
chemicals, fertilizers and oil
refineries, and getting tough with
labor.
Youngstown workers, therefore,

have decided to get tough with

U. S. Steel.
Youngstown steelworkers, accompanied
by 100 Homestead steelworkers,

marched on the U. S. Steel head-
quarters in Pittsburgh to accuse the
company of breaking its promise to

the workers. The night before, Frank
Leseganich, District Director for the
Youngstown area, counseled the workers
against "over—reacting" and refused

to join them on the march. He was

met with widespread criticism from

the workers, who-spoke of striking

and occupying the Ohio Works plant.

Although neither a strike nor a-
plant occupation seems likely, a
lawsuit does. Staughton Lvnd, a
Youngstown lawyer representing the
workers, stated that U. S. Steel
essentially broke its contract with
the workers to keep the plant
operating as long as it was
profitable. The workers were led
to believe the plant was profitable
and may now move to open up the
books to see if they were correct in
thinking so. Then, they would seek
an injunction to keep the plant open.

In addition, the federal Economic
Development Administration of the
Department of Commerce has promised

"irrevocably."

STOP RUN-AWAY JoBs

U. 8. Steel, however, has since.
dangled the hope of re-opening the
Ambridge plant before the workers.
"But, it has to be somebody else's
initiative," said George Esherick,
a spokesperson for U. S. Steel.
"If the union comes to us with a
proposal, we would re—examine our
vdecision." One USW official, who
asked not to be identified, said
"I'm sure we will examine it very
closely and see what sort of
favorable position we could take.
It would be foolish for us not to
pursue that option."

Workers in Youngstown, however,
have not been presented with the~
possible option of re-opening and
are considerably more angry. They
see the timing of the cuts as being.
deliberately aimed at influencing
next year's contract talks which
will begin in about three months.
The plant closings are seen as an
attempt to convince the workers to
moderate their demands, a
possibility originally rejected by
the Ambridge workers. The plant
closings, they claim, are part of
a strategy by the new U. S. Steel

leadership consisting of closing

$225 million to the Youngstown area
to construct a new coke plant and

to encourage diversification. The
leaders of Locals 1462, 1418, and
1330 in the Youngstown area say they
don't want a new coke plant, which
would employ only 600 workers.
Instead, they want the money spent
on modernizing one of the closed
plants..

The Ecumenical Coalition of the
Mahoning Valley, as well as industry
sources, has stated that $225
million is exactly the amount needed
to install modern electric furnaces
and a continuous caser in any of the
mills.- Therefore, the workers are
demanding that the money be
committed to re-opening and
modernizing the Briar Hill works.
The Ohio Works, they say, remains
open and U. S. Steel should be
forced to invest in it, rather than
in Conneaut.

This response to the shut-downs is
the only feasible one, says
Staughton Lynd. "The closings," he
said, "come on the eve of new steel
contract talks and are obvious attempts
to influence bargaining terms.

»Essentially, it is a lock—oux

designed to get Ell steelworkers, not
'just the Ambridge workers, crawling
back on their bellies. The workers
can only lose by being intimidated."

The More You Sweat, the Less You'Get

 

It's absolutely bizarre the dif-
ferences I've seen in jobs over the
last five years.

First, slaving in a salad's ware-
house for $2.90/hr. I worked end-
less overtime in order not to be em-
barrassed at the bank, and I smelled

A like cole slaw the rest of the time.

Then, I operated a gasket machine at
a steel container shop, a fan on one
side, an oven on the other. I froze
and roasted simultaneously, plus .

lost some hearing, all for $4.50 an
hour. The only good thing is, I got
involved in the Steelworkers Union,.
supporting Sadlowski (remember him?)

-for president.

Then, on to a better paying small
foundry in Lawrenceville - $5.75/hr.
I could hardly breathe right again,
got a timed 10 minute break, rushed
15 minute lunch, no shower time,
became a grievance man and learned
all about futility and harrassment.

The Slab Mill shapes hot steel,
not overheated people. It's modern
- the machine age at least. The
Foundry resembles prehistoric times;
jagged, smoldering beaches with
workers winding slowly thru the hot
ruins. The Slab Mill is shanty and
booth work; watching, fixing and
waiting.

The Foundry is more MACHO - take:
a lot of endurance - while the Slab
Mill is slicker, takes in a lot of
maintenance and coffee. You're not
worn out when you leave.

Some years back, the company
eliminated one-half the Foundry
workers and substituted a few bucks
incentive. That incentive has been
a standing sick joke for years.

Finally, the Foundry, under the
“genius” of the Super , works below
its manpower quota constantly. The
Slab Mill operates usually at full
quota.

So, naturally, the Foundry's got

The producers are not as import-
ant as the product. Hopefully, the
rest of our lives aren't run or dic-
tated like that. V V

The sorriest thing is this - this

’place is not run by those who know

it best. There are old timers who
could make both great steel and.
great friends - if ever they were
respected for their full value.

But, it's the manipulators and
investors who run it all - and they
never worked any of it. The system
is upside-down, and it might fall on
our heads unless we realize it's
1980, and it's time to act on our

terms once and for all.

A tremendous step forward in the
campaign to get three more states to
ratify the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) has been taken by the labor
movement. The Labor for Equal Rights
Now conference held in Richmond, Va.
in August, unanimously adopted a

‘resolution calling for a demonstra-

the rally include Frank Mont, Direct-

Local 65; Edward Coppedge, President

for Women (NOW).

The rally organizers are reaching
out to the labor movement and women's
rights organizations nationally. Al-
ready endorsements have been received
from the recent national convention
of NOW and the Coalition of Labor
Union Women. Autoworkers in New Jer-
sey, steelworkers at Sparrows Point,

sociation.

The conference resolution explains
why the ERA is important both for
women's equality and for the labor
LERN's resolu-
tion says "The entire labor movement
will gain as women win equal rights.
The employers} attempts to divide
workers by sex will be curbed;
women will play an increasing role

their numbers and power to roll back

the greater unity in our ranks will

In Virginia, a "right—to-work—for—
less" state, workers in USWA Local

tween the employers’ anti—union of-
fensive and the struggle to ratify
the ERA. The 15,000 shipyard workers

 Shovel ing Money& Steel Chips

“I'm in there for the money!”
explains Mary Pat Manso about her
job at the Homestead works of
United States Steel.

Mary Pat graduated from
Steel Valley High School last
May and is now making $8 per hour
in the Valley Machine Shop as a
Materials Handler-Hooker, a
position usually filled by a man.

As a Materials Handler—Hooker,
she hooks up steel to cranes from
trucks and does other "small

I jobs“ such as shoveling steel
chips.

Mary Pat explains that the
job is not too difficult for a
female: "It's all in your atti-
tude. If you have the attitude
that you can't do it, you won't
be able to. You never have to
pick up something you can't
handle."

She, along with approximately
25 to 30 other women in her shop,
encounters many problems while
trying to "make it in a man's
world.“

"First of all,” said Mary Pat,
"many bosses don't like women in
the shops; they try to make it
hard on them so they'll quit.“

_ One woman in her shop was
given a disciplinary slip for
walking too fast, an offence
that is usually cleared up with
a friendly warning.

But along with the type of
supervisor who is always out
to get you (referred to as a
"bad head" by the workers),
there are supervisors or “white
hats” who will "cut you a break
and help you out,“-the good heads."

Male co—workers can also be
a problem for the female
employees at the mill.
are three types of guys in there:
the old guys who pinch, which
amounts to about ten percent; the
talkers, who will tell you all
about what they want to do to
you and can sometimes get '
ignorant, amounting to about
l5 percent; and the other 75
percent are the nice guys who
will help you out when you need

’ be held back from her.“

“There N

them,” Mary Pat explains.

I

Sometimes the men will make
the job difficult for a woman by
closing the grated trap doors
because they know a female will
be cleaning up the steel chips
that pile up there.

Mary Pat describes another
"trick" pulled by the men on
female workers: "Some men in
the mill do sick things with rats
and mice. One guy killed a
mouse, put it in an envelope,
and put in in a new girl's mail
box." _

A major problem for the work-
ing women at the Homestead mill
is that the women's locker room
is located outside, across the
street from the shop "where,
anyone off the street can go
in.” On her way to use these
restrooms, Mary Pat recently

Mary Pat and her colleagues
are presently working toward
improvement of this dangerous
situation.

Says Mary Pat, “I'm not a
‘women's Libber'but I feel that
if a woman thinks she is capable
of doing a job, it-shouldn't

In the past few months there
have been four female machine
apprentices in her shop. Out
of the four, two had nervous
breakdowns and one quit. Only
one woman apprentice is left.

why would a woman go through
all of that to try to become
a machinist? "Machinists make
up to $15 an hour,” explains
Mary Pat. “If an apprenticeship
comes I'll think I'll try for

Pgh Women 1 Against Porn

it.”

At the mill salaries are based
on job titles from Class 5 to
Class 30. A machinist is a Class
l5 job. .

Despite the problems of dis:
crimination, weather conditions,
and occasional boredom, Mary
Pat gets along with her job.

She presently remains undecided,
however, whether she will stay
or just stay long enough to save
money for further schooling,

will present a slide-
show at Western Psychiatric

January 9, at 7:30 PM. It is a
slideshow of abusive images of
women in pornography and the
media. The slideshow focuses on
pornography's woman-hating
messages and illustrates the way -
in which hard—core porn imagery
is increasingly pervading pop
culture. Pittsburgh Women
Against Pornography believe that
pornography is any depiction of
people being victimized or
objectified by violence or
dominance for the purposes of
sexual gratification. Currently,
PWAP committees are showing the
slideshow, organizing women's . ' ﬂ
tours of the Liberty Avenue %
pornography district, directing
letter-writing campaigns to
local media, and conducting
research on the issue. We
invite all interested women to

Feminist Denounces  
;lr*******  ********

It is important for people to
’realize that the Ku Klux Klan, in
addition to being against therights
of individuals on account of race,
is also against the rights of in-
dividuals on account of sex.

The Klan opposes ratification of
the Equal Rights Amendment, affirm-
ative action, teaching sex educa-
tion in the schools, and providing
contraceptives to minors, to name
just a few of its political stances.

These same people do not permit
a those of the Jewish faith to join
' their organization and have also
I participated in union-busting ac-

tivities.

The article printed about the
Klan on Oct. 21 edition of the
Pittsburgh Press ("KKK: How Big Is
The Komeback?") gave the impression
that the only focus of the Klan is
racism. This is indeed not the
case. In fact, it appears they are
against indiviudal liberties of
quite a few Americans.

The National Organization for
=Women realized long ago that those
—'who oppose equality on the basis of

sex also oppose equality on the
basis of race. We deplore divide-

‘ and-conquer tactics used against
the oppressed and work to eliminate
racism in our society as*well as
sexism.

An Angry Letter

If you were hiring someone
for a job would you consider
my friend T? T is in her early
thirties. T has not worked for
over 3 years. Of the last
4 years she has spent several
months out of each year in
a mental ward. T is currently
out of the hospital. She is
on good medicine. She is
attractive and intelligent.
If you knew her history would
you hire her?

Recently our Governor made
a big emotional appeal about
getting "able-bodied" people
off welfare. He is talking
about the State General
Assistance Program which
provides income to single
people. My friend T is on
welfare because no one will
hire her. Employers say
be honest, we provide
equal opportunity, but admit
that you have been a
mental patient and you can
forget about getting a job.
My friend T worked at a
number of jobs before she
became ill. She also
completed 2 years of college
and did very well. VT
deserves a chance to live
a normal life but chances
are she will never get it.

My friend T has been turned

.down for the most mundane

jobs. She has been turned
down for dishwashing jobs,
for fast—food jobs, for
minimum wage sales jobs.

My friend T gets $164

a month on General
Assistance welfare, and
about $50 in food stamps.
Of that money $100 goes for
rent. If $50 worth of food
is all she needs for a whole
month that leaves her just
$64 for all personal items
such as doing the laundry,
trying to maintain a decent
enough wardrobe so she can
accept a job if anyone ever

gives her a chance, bus money £2‘?

for doctors appointments
(she's still in counseling)
and all other personal

needs.
Next time you start

complaining about "able-
bodied" welfare recipients
consider my friend T.

She would be considered
"able-bodied” under the
Governor's definition. He
wants to eliminate the little
she has to live on. T

has no family to take care

of her. Would you hire my
friend T? If you honestly
wouldn't than quit bitching
about "able-bodied" welfare
recipients. No one in

their right mind is going

to live on $164 a month

unless for some reason they
are forced to. My friend

T is a trapped woman. There
is no equal opportunity for
her here. T cannot "pick
herself up by the bootstraps"
when she can't even get hired for
minimum wage. If any of

you out there have any solutions
I would love to hear them. My
friend is signed up with the
bureau of employment security,
she has discussed the problem
with numerous "counselors" of
every sort. Doctors agree that
my friend T will probably not
need to be hospitalized again
and that she is capable and
able'to work. Any of you

hard working tax payers out
there have any suggestions?
And guess what, my friend T

is not a unique case. There
are lots of people in similar
situations who cannot get work
because of employer prejudice.
What is the solution! If I
had one I wouldn't be writing
this letter. This is an
angry letter and I am angry
because I know that my friend
T's life is at the mercy

of budget-cutters and
opinionated employers and
there is precious little she
can do to help herself given
these circumstances. She '
has tried very hard.

Pittsburgh—Sti|| Class D

Waen Woodie Guthrie came through
Pittsburgh during the 1940s , he was
so taken aback by the effects of war-
ti.me industry that he wrote the song
"Pittsburgh Town is a Smoky 01' Town.‘

Shortly after the war, the Wall
Street Journal assessed the condi-
tion of American cities and ranked
Pittsburgh among the most misera-
ble - Class D.

Difficult political decisions were

made towards making Pittsburgh a liv-

able city. Smoke-control and flood-
control became major factors in Ren-
aissance I. .

Department stores wanted an end
to the ﬂooding of the Point and
Downtown before they would commit
themselves to staying. I_t meantDem—
ocratic boss Mayor David Lawrence
had to wangle funds from Republican
administrations in Harrisburg and
Washington for flood-control locks
up the Allegheny River and for the
creation of Poi.nt State Park. The
stores also wanted Downtown's air
to be cleaned up. This meant Law-
rence not only had to stand up to
local industry, he also had to face
the decision of supporting a smoke-
control ordinance that forced most
Pittsburghers to change their home
heating from coal to gas. '

Believe it or not, back in those
days one of the pri_me movers behind
smoke-control was the Pittsburgh
Press.

But as much as Renaissance I did,
it left all the more to be done.
Like the nursery rhyme, Pittsburgh
had one shoe off and one shoe on.

The pollution is no longer chunks
of dark smoke but a haze of fine par-
ticulates. These particulates are
what local politicians concur with
industry executives in calling the
final 10% that is too expensive to
clean up.

As then, the School Board contin-
ues to evade the issue of desegrega-
tion. Past and present mayors and
city councils concur with their si-
lence.

Local hospitals have raised their
average cost-per—day to $200. Coun-
cil has endorsed the right of citi-
zens to free medical care. Yet Coun-
cil has made no effort beyond quiet-
ly passing the resolution, rather
than rallying public sentiment so
that bills such as the National
Health Service Act will be taken ser-
iously by Congress. '

Labor unions have come a long way
in organizing the industries of steel
and coal. "From the Allegheny to the

Ohio, people are joining the CIO,"
sang Woodie Guthrie. But labor has
not done well in organizing the in-
dustries of education and health-
care. The largest employers in the
city are the University of Pittsburgh
and the University Health Center.
'1hey are also the largest non-union
employers in the city. Three unions
have failed to organize clerical
workers at Pitt. And last year, the 
first strike by the only hospital
workers’ union in the city against a
Pitt-run hospital received luke-warm
support from other unions and the
cold shoulder from elected city of-
ficials, supposedly friendly to ‘
labor.

Wide-scale displacement from the
Downtown construction boom of Renais-
sance I has waned. Still, Mayor Cal-
igui.ri and Council this spring per-
mitted Pittsburgh Plate Glass to use
city government as a vehicle for re-
meving merchants from prime Downtown
property. _

The offset, we are told, will be
5,000 new jobs at the 40-story tower
to be built near Market Square. Yet
there is no committment, not even
any mention, about minority-training,
minority—hiring or even local hiring.

So how livable has Pittsburgh be-
come? How livable is it that you’
breathe with the knowledge that your
lungs may be an incubator for a can-
cer. . .that you tap a glass of water
and have to wait for the suds to
clear. . .that your kids, if from a
certain neighborhood, are. locked into
an inferior education. . .that youprob
ably won't be able to afford the cos
of your health. . .that you consider
your job demeaning and unsafe?

SIDE IS NO LONGER PART OF THE GREAT
CITY OF PITTSBURGH? MAYBE THE PEOPLE
IN THIS AREA SHOULD SECEDE FROM THE

THIS AREA HAS NOT SEEN A MAJOR IM-
PROVEMENT IN THE NINE YEARS I HAVE
LIVED HERE, LONGER FOR MANY OLDER
RESIDENTS. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY
BE AS MANY AS 90 YEARS BEFORE WE GET
ANY RETURN ON OUR TAX DOLLAR.

THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR AN AREA THAT
IS CONSIDERED A LOW-INCOME AREA. IF
THIS WERE ANY PLACE WHERE A POLITI-
CIAN MIGHT LIVE, I AM QUITE SURE
THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM WITH AN
ADDED EXPENSE INCURRED IN BUILDING A.
NEW FIRE STATION. BUT, THEN AGAIN”/
THIS IS THE EAST NORTH SIDE AND WE
DON'T HAVE A POLITICIAN WHO LIVES IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS NOTED THAT A
NEW, CENTRALLY LOCATED FIRE STATION
WAS NEEDED TO BETTER SERVE THE AREA.
THREE YEARS AGO THE CITY CAME IN AND
TOLD THE COMMUNITY WE WOULD BE GET-
TING THE MUCH-NEEDED NEW FACILITY.”

THIS STARTED A BATTLE OVER TWO
SITES AND FINALLY, AFTER MANY MEET-
INGS, ALL PARTIES CONCERNED AGREED
THAT THE AREA BORDERED BY SPRING
GARDEN AVENUE, CHESTNUT STREET, ITIN
STREET AND SALTER WAY WOULD BE THE
BEST LOCATION.

THIS AREA WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR AN
UPGRADING OF EXISTING STREETS AND
INTERSECTIONS ANYWAY DUE TO THE IN-
CREASE OF TRACTOR-TRAILERS MAKING.

, THEREFORE I THINK FIRE CHIEF KEN-
NELLY'S REMARKA6 TOTHE COST OF WID-

T LEAST 15 YEARS. '

WE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE THANK-
FUL THAT THE BUILDING THAT WAS BE-
COMING A HEALTH HAZARD IS GONE, A-
LONG WITH A FEW OTHERS, BUT WE DID

SIX OF THE BEST BUSINESS NEIGHBORS
YOU COULD ASK FOR.

mind expanding as if to unveil a
/wondrous mystery hidden deep within
the illuminated glass. His mind was
free to drift to any tine or place
that it cared. Favorite thoughts
would camouflage the dreadfully in-
evitable encounter of being punished.
The memory of previous abusive nnnr
ents had to be repressed, and there
was no tornent to endure whileinag-.
ining that one were walking through
a steep stand of oak trees with
their protective canopy of leaves
overhead. The steeply sloping walls

M of the valley lead to a picturesque

streambed so typical of a Pennsyl-
Vania landscape. Sunlight gently
trickled through the dense umbrella
of foliage to reveal a patchwork

of intersecting streanbeds and the
black humus-laden soil underfoot.

He remenbered standing before a
newly discovered tree, a hemlock,
the crest of which towered some
seventy feet above the ground - the
nassive trunk rising like a pillar
from a thicket of surrounding mount-
ain laurels. The splendor of this
gentle giant inspired within him a
genuine respect for the beauty of
nature. It seemed more sanctimoni-
ous being in the presence of god's
natural handiwork than attending that
frequently crowded church. He felt
comfortable in such surroundings,
nmch more so than sitting on achurch
pew beside some babushka covered
head that kept coughing into a faded
handkerchief.

How beautiful it was to be alive
"and in full possession of the senses
of sight and sound, and to experi-
ence the exhilarating smell of the
sweet fragrance of wildflowers
growing along the streambank. This
was the stream on which he and his
friend built small dans of mud and
rock. Sometimes the reservoir of
water grew so large that they hur-
riedly designed a spillway to serve
as a means of releasing the excess
pressure.

At the top of the ridge that para-
lleled the valley was the hiding
place of a small herd of whitetail
deer. It was on the day he explored
the limestone outcroppings near the

crest of the ridge that he'd cone
upon several deer napping amongst
the underbrush. From a terraced
vantage point the deer quickly es-
caped his sudden presence by gallop-
ing down and across an adjacent val-
ley. How incredibly graceful they
fled and with such amazing speed,
finding finn footing where dense un-
derbrush obscured the pathway.- He
didn't understand how anyone could
want to kill such delicate and nag-
nificent creatures. For a nnnent,
the image of his neighbor's yearly
kill came to mind. Every year at
the onset of hunting season, the dead
body of a deer would be hung by a
rope from Mr. Hansen's naple tree.

A hideous blood-dried tongue dangled
from the lifeless mouth, the eyes
whitened over as though huge catar-
acts had developed.

Mr. Hansen had once explained to
him the need for wildlife management.

"Thinning the herd is necessary to
prevent overpopulation and starva-
tion,” he said, as he hoisted a
newly killed deer up into the air.
"You've got to keep this meat high
enough, elsewise; dogs will getit,”
he continued, his breath straining
from the exertion of pulling and

the natural predators had been elim-
liminated, it was inportat that
hunters kill a certain number of‘

stiffened carcass saddened him.

The one flaw he found in the
hunter's argument was the difference
between natural selection of the fit-
test to survive as comared with the
indiscrﬂninate ndsfortune of being
within rifle range.

NUMBER ONE

Has anyone noticed how most Amer-
icans just can't stand to think that
we're not number one in everything
anymore? This seems to be especially
true of the sports types who get all
starry eyed during the national an-
them and then transfer this fierce
patriotism to the home team as if
World War II were being reenacted on
the field.

Just’ mention to one of them that
Sweden has a much higher standard of
living than the U.S. and watch the
reaction.

After hearing the suicide line
dozens of times, I checked the alman—
act. Sure enough, Sweden has alower
suicide rate than East Germany, West
Germany, Hungary, Austria, Denmark,
Czechoslovakia, or Finland. Mean-
while, the rates in Sweden and the
United States, l8 and 12 per 100,000

"people respectively, were both much
higher than rates of 3 or 4 per
100,000 in Italy, Ireland, and \
elsewhere.

In the world almanac is a chart
showing the murder rate in Sweden at
0.5 per 100,000, within the U.S.more
than 14 times higher at a whopping
7.2 per 100,000! Here is where the
old might"is*right crowd is number
one.

Yes, the grand winner in the in-
ternational murder rate, more than
double everyone else, and blasting
in at 7.2, is He good old U.S.of A.

Sweden does have a higher stand-
ard of living than the Unitedstates,
but check to see if the person
you're talking to is packing a gun
before you mention it.

ARE FOREIGN AID DOl.l.AR$' SUBVERTING '
OUR DEMOCRACY?

Since the end of the Second World
War and the beginning of the Coldhhr
one of the more secret and shameful
chapters in American history was the
export of the principles of dicta-
torship.

While our government publicly
championed political liberty, it in
fact made that goal secondary to Am-
erican financial interests through-
out the world.

Through the CIA, the U.S. Infor-
mation Agency, and other intelli-
gence and propaganda bodies, our tax
dollars were used to set up puppet
governments, overthrow nationalist
or even democratic governments, and
to support and train dictatorships
in how to control local populations
and popular movements.

The goal, of course, was to pro-
tect American interests: copper and
tin in South America, oil from the
Middle East, cheap labor for runaway
American shops in‘Taiwan, SouthKorea
and the Phillipines, where unions to
this day are illegal.

But the results of this export of
dictatorship and the means toumin-
tain it are only beginning to hit
home for Americans. The secret pol-
ice forces that the CIA created have
now begun to undermine democracy and
political freedom in the mostunlike-
ly place of all - American itself.

The intelligence and secret pol-
ice networks that our CIA developed
for other countries are well-known:
the IranianSAVAK, the Korean KCIA,
the Chilean junta's DINA, the expat-
riate Cuban organizations centered
around Miami; their personneltrained
by Americans, financed by American
dollars in the name of American in-
terests.

American foreign aid dollars pro:
vide them with everything from sur-
veillance equipment to thumb screws
used in gathering "intelligence" by
torture. '

But, as continuation of support
for these groups comes under chal-
lenge within the U. S., our very
dollars are now being used to sub-
vert gur democracy, in our Congress,
in our free press, in the streets of
our cities.

Item: A bomb explodes in mid—day
in the streets of Washington, D. C.
blowing up the street, a limousine,
and an ex—minister of Chile's former
Allende regime. Two years later,
eight are under indictment, includ-

32

ing 5 right-wing Cuban emigres and 3
Chilean DINA operatives, including
General Manuel Sepulveda, head of the
CIA-trained DINA and the right hand
mand of Chilean dictator AugustoPin—
ochet.

Item: Numerous members of Con-
gress are indicted for receiving
funds from KCIA operative Tongsun
Park. Each had a key role to play
in continuing massive American aid

_to Korea, most of which was used to

bolster the Park dictatorship in?
South Korea and to stamp out politi-
cal dissent. Investigations show

that the bribery scandal wasfinancedi

by the very aid Congress had voted
the previous year.

Item: Right-wing Cubans involved
in the Watergate scandal were part
of several networks of emigre organ-
izations operatiqg in the U.S. and
financed by CIA funds — in violation
‘of the CIA's Charter regarding such
funds which are not to be used in
domestic operations.

Why has our government not taken I
action against these foreign spies
operating in America?

Why are foreign agents permitted
to operate on our soil, not onlywith
the knowledge of our ownintelligence
network, but with its support?

And why have the interests ofmul-
tinational copper, tin and oil com-
panies, organizations which havedone
much to aggravate our inflationrate,

been put ahead of the realintentions‘

of our democracy and foreign aid, to
build freedom ofgolitica1.expression
in these other lands?

America's image in the world over
the past thirty years has not been
merely sullied, but reversed. We,
through the misappropriation of our,
foreign aid dollars, have become a.
monster in the modern world, as much
a source of dictatorship as the Rus-
sian monolith we allege to keep at
bay.

And now these monsters we've cre-
ated are returning to subvert the
source of their power, by breaking
our laws, by bribing our Congress,
and by doing the exact opposite of
what we aided them to do, i.e.,
maintain freedom for their peoples
in their own lands. -

It's about time that this country
collars its dog - before it destroys
its master next. A

FROM AMBRIDGE T0 TEHRAN

How much is the U. S. Government
willing to spend for one man?
Depends on who he knows. If he

- knows David Rockefeller and Henry

Kissinger, the U. S. will spend
nﬁllions and mobilize its nﬁlitary

. lmight to keep the ma.n in the U. 3..
If he works at U.S. Steel and only

knows his neighbors in small towns
like Ambridge, Lawrenceville, or
Youngstown, it won't lift a finger.
Who needs the help more? The
Shah with his billions pilferedfrm
his country's treasury with the
blood of thousands of Iranians on
his hands? Or mill hunks who have
twisted their bodies from back-
breaking work only to be told that
the only way U.S. Steel wants any-

) thing to do with them is if they

work for less?
The U.S. Government says the

'’issue is the 50 held hostage. If

that is the case, why did they turn

up the talk of military intervention’ _

after the_black and women hostages
were released? It would seem that

=’instead of seeing it as a positive

sign to win the release of the
others, they chose to use the oppor-
tunity to whip up hysteria for its,
own purposes: Yes. Mr. Carter,
those 50 lives are important to us.
So, too, are the 13,000 lives torn
apart by the closings by U.S. Steel.
When will we see you threatening
USS Chairman Roderick the way you
threatened the Ayatollah?

A Mr. Carter, if you continue on
this course you will wind up doing
the same thing Nelson Rockefeller
did at Attica State Prison. Both
prisoners and guards were killed by
the guns of the Very police sent to
"rescue" the hostages. Whetherit's
in Attica, New York or Tehran, Iran.
it still comes down to same thing.

Some signs made up at Homestead
read, "Send Roderick and the Shah
Back to Iran.” Carter seems willing
to turn a blind eye towards the

. crimes of both. The same Carter
who almost called out the National
Guard against the coal Hdners, is
now ready to use big guns so the
Shah is free to spend his billions,
billions that the U.S. Government
and the oil companies gave hnn gen-
erously - paid for through our taxes
and high gas prices.

IRAN

SOIvIE'RI£IF'l.ECTIONS ON MODERATION. 

The crisis of the American hos-
tages in Iran and their plight drags
on and on. Here are some thoughts
to ponder:

(1) The U.S. military arsenal is
irrelevant and useless in Iran. It
could only be used after the hos-
tages are free or dead as Vengeful
retribution to "teach Iran a lesson.
Perhaps a positive outcome will be
the recognition (finally) that mil-
itary might is not an adequate de-
fense of our nation. Iran is no mil-
itary threat to the United States.
Neither was Viet Nam, Cambodia or
Laos. Our military over-kill could
and nearly did "bomb them back to
the stone age.” The legacy of this '
policy is not "victory" but refugees
from and starvation in Southeast

1!

.Asia, an American generation (both

those who served and those who re-
sisted), deeply scarred by the ex-
perience.

(2) It's too bad that thelranians.

-- righteously indignant about the
Shah's repressive government and his
stealing from the national treasury
(although neither is unique in Iran-
ian history) -— don't recognize the
real power available to them in the
United Nations. Whatever truth
there is in their charges of U.S.
embassy "spying," that is not the
issue. Any embassy of any nation
would be "guilty" of the same prac-
tices. Unfortunately, no nation
can be self-righteous about that.
But a "fair trial" in the U.N.
fonnwm of the Shah's excesses would
"prove" Iran's charges against the
Shah. Further, it would serve as an
I important precedent to strengthen

iresolve itself.

the U.N.'s capacity to deal effect-
ively with such internationalissues.
(3) I suspect the real issue is
neither the Shah nor U.S. spying,
whatever the truth of these charges.
The basic effort in Iran (if the
current goverment is to survive) is
tactical, to distract the population
fr monstrous, divisive and perhaps
insoluable internal problems, and
unite them against a common'satanic”

enenw. Khomeini is a dangerous and ,

irresponsible denegogue -- cunning,
shrewd and intelligent. He is not
a religious madman.

(4) For our own best interest as
well as theirs, we must scrupulously
defend and protect all Iranian stu-
dents in our country. Once anyone's
constitutional rights are violated —
for expediency, or fear, or anger,
or a bargaining point - everyone’s
rights are in danger. .

FEAR: GOOD FOR BUSINESS

I woke up afraid themomimg after
I viewed the NBC White Paper; "No
more Vietnam, but...” During the
night the real message from our most
trustworthy seers of NBC arose to
neke He uneasy and axious. The
'lﬂiite Paper" format usually evokes
that aura of ‘special revelation,’
the real truth you should have known,

and were afraid was being kept frm

you.

Add to that the special fear the
petrolem crisis brings to Americans
who are already fearful that ou life
style is in jeopardy. The netrix of
the whole prograniwascxuxeagain the
collusion of forces attacking ou
progress, our democratic systems,our
financial stability.

A futher spectre of fear cane
from the shadow of Russian interven-
tion lurking just over ou shoulders,
forcing us to compromise gg_non- J
interventionist preferences, re—eval-
uate our advocacy of human rights.‘
It's a matter of self-defense, we
must be practical as a matter of
self-defense, we must be practical
as a matter of principle.

Finally there was the pervading
innuendo of the old Jewish conspir-
acy to trap the west in its guilt
trip for further committment and
defense of Israel despite our nag-
ging conscience that Palestinias
have rights to a national homeland,
too.

The conclusion came in the form
of a question: "Why not take the
oil?” Yes. Once again.we might
just have to rake war to preserve
peace. Arnenents to allies, in-
creased foot soldiery for ourselves
spell out ou security. No mention
of the fact that the war neterials
are good business for the U.S.A.

DEFENSE SPENT

Protests, Protests, Protests.
It seems that just about every
time we opened a newspaper, we
found something new to protest.

_ The average American citizen is
being taken for a “ride” in so
many ways these days, it is
indeed pitiful. But the one that
really riles me is when I hear
a politician clamoring for more
defense spending, and practic-
ally all national politicians
are.

Even Jimmy Carter was black-
mailed into supporting more money
for defense.

Here is our nation with its
enormous arsenal of atomic
weapons, probably enough to
raze every major Russian city,
and yet these greedy politic-
ians still clamor for more.

At first they lacked a major
argument, one that had any
meaning to anyone today. But
then someone recalled those
couple thousand Russian esperts
that had in fact been in Russia
for years. Could this be made
into an up-to-date argument?

It not only could but it was.
So those few Russian experts
quite suddenly became thousands
of thoroughly experienced,
thoroughly trained, completely_
equipped Russian combat troops,
secretly brought to Cuba in

the last few nights all for the
purpose of leading an invasion
of the U.S.

Then quite suddenly how the
clamor for increased defense
spending rose, from all those
subservient politicians. Every
senator with or without presi-
dential aspirations. That is
except for the two or three with
ibetter sense who saw through this
sham.

I . CIVILIZED

As I watch the irrational reaction
of Americans to the events in Iran,
I think that we really have not come

. too far since the early days of this

country.

The actions of the government and
individual Americans to Iranians in
this countrygbring to mind the
‘Palmer Raids“ in 1919, the intern-
ment of Japanese-Americans during
world War II, and the threats of de-
portation and in some cases actual
deportation of immigrants who were
un—American enough to strike for a
better life for themselves and their

live up to that.

President Carter agreed to
appoint a Blue Ribbon Panel to
view the evidence and advise
him. well the public was never
informed of those findings.
why weren't we? A

I have my own good idea of
why we weren't. How can you
prove the existence of a ghost?

50 with no contrary evidence
- Carter running for re—election,
dared not be positive - those
politicians clamored all the
louder. V

The answer is simple. Because
the defense industry is the most
profitable of all industries,
exceeding even the oil industries.
Their constant greed is never
satisfied. It constantly demands
more and newer sophisticatedg

weaponry for all military services. §
All of which means more and more i.

and still more profits. And

their servants, those subservient
politicians constantly echo 1
their demands. - ‘ Q

If the American people are
ever going to control these
large corporations - as this
must be done if we are to con-
trol our own destiny - a
beginning should be made with
those in the defense industry.

Regarding this craze for
defense spending, this is the
last paragraph in an opening 3
article in the November issue
of the magazine THE BULLETIN,
the magazine of the Atomic_
Scientists: '

“Kissinger is right after all,
The Cuban troup crisis does in-
deed represent the tip of an ice-
berg. The rest is the whole
realm of military kookery that
we are being sold in its wake.

Withoutwarning, without prelimina-

nuclear strike against the United States.
Soviet MlRVs and SS9s arced upward from
Kasputin Yar, Plesetsk, Irkutsk, Bciikonur,
and a hundred other launch sites. The un-
thinkable suddenly took form. The balance
of terror tipped.

The United States, of course, had no
defense. American policy makers based
survival upon a strategy known as Mutual
Assured Destruction: MAD. Any attack
upon the United States would be met with
an overwhelmingly destructive counter-
attack. It had always been deterrant
enough.

‘Until now.
Within seconds of launch, U . S.

and flashed the information to NORAD,
the North American Air Defense nerve

Except _for_  breathing and the rain

falling heavily upo'n'the”'building, -there — _
was no sound. Not an insect called, not
a rat scuttled.

Even in the lpre-dawn gloom the pilot
recognized familiar shapes among the
hundreds of ancient planes. He wandered

to him: a 1911 single-engine French
Bleriot, the kind which first flew across
the English ‘Channel, and over there was
an early attempt toward a human-carrying
aircraft, the Langley Aerodrome A . He
passed an early helicopter, the 1943 Pia-
secki Model PV-2, and paused briefly be‘-

fore an antique Albatross D. Va., a Ger- 1

man fighter from his father's war very
similar to the one flown by Baron Manfred
von Richthofen .

But he was searching forian older
plane, one from the war after that.

Then he was among the warplanes: a
P-47 Mustang; a P‘-38 Lightning; a Navy
Hellcat; a Corsair F4U which might have
flown with PappyvBoyington's Black Sheep
Squadron; a Thunderbolt, which, he re-
membered, they used to call "Bucket of

Then the foreign warplanes: the Mit-

subishi A6a’\:'\2, Model 11, designated Type

O, or Zero-sen, the "Zekes" which virtu-
ally annihilated Claire Chennault's Flying
Tigers, John Wayne and all; Hitler's Mes-
serschmitt 262, the world's first jet fighter;

the German Arado 324, the first operation-

al iet bomber of his own war, the previous
r"Big One", World'War 11.

At last he found it, covering the
length ofithe hangar's back. He stood be-
fore the old B-29, swaying slightly as the

A -excitement brought back another surge of

nausea. In the gathering light of the grey
dawn he made out the faded name on the
dusty fuselage. After a while he walked
under the bomber's nose and looked up at
the other side of the cockpit. Stenciled

 in faint black paintwas "Colonel P. W.
Tibbets" and the fqmilar names of the eight

crewmen. .Above the names was the
legend: "FirstAtomic Bomb, Hiroshima--

’ Aug. 6, 1945:“

He returned and stared once more at

the name. A And this time he whispered the
bomber's name to himself.

"Enola Gay," he said.

That night, after working through the
day on the bomber, he slept fitfully in the
plane's lly,_.  _ ’ —

And again he dreamed he saw Wash- 1

ington die .

The fireball erupted, as if sundering
the earth and belching from the belly of

hell, and a bluish-green light o'verwh‘elmed
the sunlight. A leviathan column of purple

flame climbed upward, Jovian lightning
screaming up from the earth toward the
heavens. The base of the rainbow fire-
pillar was ten miles wide, tapering to

ready for tnansferral to the National Air

and Space Museum in ‘Washington, they

.would have smoothly flown there if the

technicians had put oil and fueljin them
instead of the preservative they used to
prevent rust and corrosion .

The pilot spent a week draining the
preservative from the B-29 and replacing
it with stockpiled reserves of aviation fuel
and high grade oil.

Then he spentthree weeks of declining
_ strength outfitting the old bomber with

four miles at the top. The seething, boil- makeshift tanks for the thousands of gallons

ing base was brown, the writhing center
amber, the top white.

At 6C,OOC feet, the fire column blos-
somed into the familar foaming fury of the
mushroom, erupting, rolling, ripping ‘
through the clouds and finally separating.
The mushrooIm's colossal speed carried the
detached cap into the stratosphere within
seconds and another cap emerged from the
still ascending column, giving it the aura

of a titanic gorgon's head of coiling snakes.

old Libero tors took off from desert strips in
North Africa and flew 2,000 miles to
Rumania, hittheir targets,.and those that
survived turned around for the long flight

fuel tanks.

Eyesjon the 80’s

Those who remember the Great _
Depression sometimes say things like,
"I realize the dollar was worth more
than it is now, but nobody had any
dollars then!" what is going on now
is reminiscent of those days, but with
many new twists.

' In a recent article in The New
Republic, Paul Blumberg (preview-
ing some of the material he is put-
tin into a book due out next year)

notes that between l967 and T978, the.

average gross annual income of Am-
erican steelworkers rose from $7426
to $19,573, or 34.9% after taking
inflation into account. This was
the highest percentage increase of
(any work group in the U.$., at least .
among the 25 groups he included in
his analysis. Most of the big in-
creases were scored by blue-collar
groups, the white-collars falling
off the most. Coalminers and auto-
mobile workers were not too far be-
hind steelworkers (around 30% and
25%), while college professors and
librarians dropped around l0% (all
fingures compared with inflation
rates).

These days, of course, many steel-
workers might say, "well, I know my
average salary has increased a hell-
uva lot, but what do I care if I
don't have a job?“ This is very
similar to the other cry, " I know
the unemployment rate is 7%, but
I'm l0O% unemployed!" The perils of-
wage labor are what they always have
been, at least for the most part.
Layoffs are liable to come suddenly
and by the thousands, and nobody a-
round Pittsburgh has to be reminded
of that in December l979. So
what does it all mean?

I focus here on just a few major
points about the direction in which
the world is heading. First, so long
as our system is designed the way it
is (andI mean the world system, not
just a capitalist or socialist system,
since I see no difference between the
two), inflation can only get worse
and worse from here on in. There is
only one reason for this; the world
is running out of resources, it cost
more and more to find them and ex-
tract them from the earth, and no
conceivable increase in "producti-
vity" can possible overcome the
escalating basic costs of resources.

Second, who knows how many coun-
tries, determined to "prove" they
have become "big-timers," have de-
cided to build their own steel mills?

whenever a lot of people decide that
more and more production facilities
are needed, too much is produced.
while many disagree with this, it is
clear to me that the greater the
competition in any industry, the more

likely it is that the industry will
produce more than can be sold for the
costs of production. The problem is

more one of overproduction across the,

The Workbook/cpf

board than it is one of "inefficient" ‘i.

plants, and "high—cost" labor. Anyway,
with inflation setting in, there are
not enough customers for all the
steel plants now in the world.

Third, because we are running out
of resources, the "pie" cannot con-
tinue to expand. The only way any
group can now become any richer is
to take directly from other groups,
so are we going to have a “class war,"
or a complicated war of all groups
against all other groups, or what?

Herewith, just a few non—Marxist
assertions:

-It will not be long before people
start talking seriously aobut sepa-
rating work from income. If resources
are scarce, it will not mean anything
to earn a lot more money than anyone
else does--there will be nothing to
buy with the extra money.

-All sorts of property will have
to be "shared," not "owned." How to
manage this is going to be tough,
but we will not have any choice.

- If property and resources must
be shared, it will make no sense to
have some people labeled "bosses" and;
others labeled “nonbosses." Again

 

198OARK

It would seem that the age ofnﬁra
acles, as in biblical times, is still
very nmch with us!

There was such a "shortage" of
gasoline that panic in the streets

passed the hysteria during theibnﬁne,
plague and pestilence of olden times.
Suddenly, lo and behold, yea and
verily, as the price of gasoline

there is ultimately no choice.
-Everybody is beginning to learn
that the 40-hour "be productive" week
is coming to an end. work will simply
have to be shared. whether this begins
with the 35-hour week or something
else, we will have to discover. These
cannot be "tip-toe" steps, however,
because in our system, full employ-

ment is impossible without making

inflation much worse. There can be
no solution, then, except separating
work and income. In the immediate
future, we may have to figure out
new ways of "sharing" layoffs---

November 22, 1963: Whatwas it
Malcolm X said when he heard the news

r from Dallas? Or was it Stokley Carmich-

T _a_e_l? The pilot's memory was slipping
away. What was it they said?

"The chickens have come home to
roost. "

That's right, the pilot thought. That.

That's what they said. ‘Nell, this bird's
coming home. This bird's gonna roost.

Searching for its nest, Enola Gay flew
easily after sleeping for so many years.
With the lurid glow of what had bee/n
Washington off its portwing and Philadel-
phia off its starboard, Enola Gay headed
for the sinking sun.

Enrico Fermi's laboratory beneath the
stadium at the University of Chicago was
radioactive dust along with Chicago. Oak
Ridge died with the rest of Tennessee. ‘

But the Los Alamos Scientific Labora-
tory slept securely beneath the New Mexi-T‘
can moon. Although it had remained en-
gaged in nuclear weapons research and
development, it was a ghost of its I943

self when it had been established as an
integral part of the Manhatten Proiect.

It had ceased to matter in any strategic

or miltary sense and its very isolation pre-
served it from the universal destruction.

The laboratories still looked down
upon the civilian residential areas, but
their security was no longer provided by‘
MP5 and fences. it was protected, instead,
by the curse unleashed there. Los Alamos
was haunted, spectral place, shunned by
the light, avoided by the breeze,

Nothing disturbed the aura of ancient evil
which clung to the eery, deserted build-
Ings.

And no one saw the winged phantom
from another era which droned out of the

,_  ,._,_':,.un‘w

night from the east and was briefly silhou-  
etted against the desert moon, a demon
from thepast. Like a mishapenwutch

searching for her coven, her midnight

altar, it circled the haunted hills of Los
Alamos. The huge shape performed its
last sacrament for the dying land, a Black
Mass of retribution and atonement in the
moon light which splashed across the
twisted pinon pines below.)

And then it dropped upon Los Alamos,
its extra fuel tanks exploding in a blazing‘
fireball of orange and oily black, splash- _
ing its own lightacross the compound like-N, 3:.
witch's napalm, cleansing the mouth of
hell.

Enola Gay had come home.

About half a million people
live in Pittsburgh proper, about
one and a half million more in
the metropolitan area. About
eleven million people live in
Pennsylvania. So imagine about
half of the state — to include
six million people, a good many
of them farmers and small towers.
Pretend we're a country and the
capital city is Pittsburgh.
Think about what happens after
A Pirate game at Three Rivers
Stadium, what happens when we get
thirteen inches of snow all at
once, what happens when the
bridges are under repair and
Fifth Avenue is ripped up
"just as school begins.

In light of well—known dis-
ruptions, what if, over a five
year period, over 500,000 tons
of bombs were to fall out of
the sky upon our homeland, each
year killing or injuring about
one fifth the number of people
living in Pittsburgh, each year
widowing about 10,000 women,
each year orphaning over 50,000
children. If you were a farmer,
you would see your crops, your
livestock, your barns, your
creeks, maybe your house, your
neighbors and your roads blown
up. If you survived, you would
probably gather together those

 

who hadn't died and flee to Pitts-
burgh, where, you had heard, no
bombs were falling and there

was food. (It might be brought
in by the same airplanes that
drop the bombs, but you wouldn't
have much choice). ~
Pittsburgh, a city snarled by
baseball games, snowfall, bridge
and road repair, would swell to
three million in five years.
Refugees from the fiery country-
side would squat wherever' they
could, scrabbing to live. The
pressure on our amenities would
be extreme, on necessities fer-
ocious. The Giant Eagles would
be dirtier, more crowded. There
would be begging and theft.
Violence and blackmarket trade
would prosper. Corruption
would flourish. Out in the
countryside, the war would con-
tinue. Food supplies would
,diminish, and some would go

hungry. Inequalities would be $3

neighbors and passers-by with ,f

we competed with them to *

Cambodia between l970 and l975.

sufficient rice-growing country ,
of about six million, loosely AEQ
ruled by a cagey prince who had '“
managed to maintain Cambodians

’ more quietly to the north in Laos

(with Thailand in between, pro-
_viding sanctuary and bases for

American forces). In l970

there was a small group of
extreme radicals, French-trained
intellectuals, led by one Pol :4
Pot, who attracted an insignifi- iﬁ
cant number of followers and ?'
operated out of the forests and «g u
hills. Also in l970, a right wing ﬂ
coup deposed the prince. The
U.S. knew that the coup would
take place, according to William
Shawcross (author of Sideshow:
Nixon, Kissinger, and the De-
struction of Cambodia), and had
reason to welcome it. Shawcross
says that those who carried out
the coup were fairly sure they
would get American support if

Ed Snyder, of the Friends
Committee on National Legislation,‘
has just returned from Indochina
after a visit by a delegation of
Quakers. He reports that in
Cambodia there is terrible star-
vation and hunger. Pol Pot's
regime destroyed money, so the
only medium of exchange for rice,
which is in short supply as food.

He saw, he says, one hospital with
400 patients for 200 beds, with l3
nurses and no doctors; there are
only 60 doctors for the whole country
Even if there were food enough, says
Snyder, it would be nearly impossible
to distribute it. There are few
trucks, no parts, little gas, bad
roads, and little administrative
structure. There are, further,
remnants of Pol Pot's regime who
have fled back to the hills where
they continue to fight.

The American Friends Service Com-
mittee, UNICEF and OXFAM Interna-
tional are planning relief food,
medicine and vitamin shipments, but
the U.S. government sits back and
refuses to hear the cry for help:
one-time officials like_Henry Kiss-
inger say it's all the fault of
communism. .

Vietnam too is in desparate need,
according to Snyder. It's an extra-
ordinarily poor country, he says.

In the north especially, the back-
breaking work of re-building goes
on with little mechanical help.
Food is scarce following years of
bombing, defoliation, napalming,
dike destruction, and mining.
Floods and droughts have resulted
in three poor crops out of the last
six. Lack of reconstruction aid
from the U.S. was exacerbated when
China withdrew its aid to become a
belligerent, nor has the USSR helped
much, says Snyder. He adds that
the Vietnamese think they are on
the right track with their revolu-
tion, despite the difficulties,
despite the fact that many people
have decided to leave.. (He talked
to former Third Force people who
deny that there is torture or per-
secution in Vietnam, who say the

hardship discourages those who had
grown to like the soft neo-colonial
way of life.)

ABROAD

Mark Twain concentrated on the germanic countries when
he visited Europe in his famous “Tramp Abroad" journey
when I got around to visiting Europe with
my hard earned steelworking money at the ripe old age of
23, duffle bag slung over my shoulder, Germany was too
expensive and reminded me too much of Philadelphia.

I traveled south to the Iberian penincula, and the
coast of Spain.

December 3, I978

Here in Barcelona on the eve of the national referendum
for a predesignated constitution, there is a war of the
wall posters. Colorful, politically fired messages are
glued to almost every inch of available space on the
ornamental Latin—Gaudi buildings of this warm Mediterranean
seaport town, urging Spaniards to vote for the referendum,
against it or abstain on election day.

It is here that a little more than 40 years ago George
Orwell wrote his masterpiece Homage to Catalonia during
the thick of the Spanish Civil war. Francisco Franco won
the war against the Second Spanish Republic,* but the
political activism that prevailed during that conflict has
apparently not been subdued. (*The first Spanish Republic
was in l868, but only lasted two years before the monarchy
regained control). ,

Nor has the distinctive culture of this region disappear-
ed. A culture manifest in the tastely prepared seafoods,
the bustling noisy markets and the peculiar language native
Catalonians speak among themselves. This tongue is a mix-
ture of French, Italian and Spanish without the 'Castilian
lisp.‘ The Catalonian language was virtually outlawed’ ‘
during the Franco years. .

Also outlawed was the language of the Basques who live
in the north west mountains of Spain. These stocky, barrel-
chested fair complected people speak a language that is
perhaps the oldest surviving language in Europe, and has
similarities with Hungarian and Finnish. ’

Both the Basques and the Catalonians were granted region-
al autonomy during the years of the second republic, but-
now nothing short of independence will satisfy many of
these people.

’ The liberalization of Spain following the l975 death
of Generalisimo Franco and the auendence of King Juan
Carlos and Prime Minister Suerez have undoubtedly proven
to be steps up for the traditionally liberty concious
working people of Spain._ Even the question of autonomy
is once again on the national agenda, though total in-
dependence is doubtful._

I was told by somewhat radical Barcalonians that Spain
is more free in the past few years. This new found liberty
becomes apparent when you see the large influx of South
Americans, primarily Argentines, that have fled persecution
in their own lands for the relatively laxed political
atmosphere of Spain. In Argentina, a protracted civil war
against democratic, socialist and other center—left*
guerrillas in the last four years prompted the military
government to move on all sources of desention, including
organized workers and intellectuals. The result is upwards
of l0,000 persons "missing" and thousands of refugees
living in Europe. (*That's if you like to use that old
left-right political thermometer). .

According to one Argentine friend, "In every Latin
American country except Venezuela and Mexico, you will

_ 0n Barcelona's main drag, I saw an ornate statue about
five stories high with waterfalls in four directions

Recardo was very much impressed that I read 0rwell's
Hommage to Catalonia and spoke a little Spanish (more like
Texican), but when I showed him my United Steelworkers of
America-District l9 windbreaker, I was “in”. It came out
that my host was very much interested in workers soli-
darity. He was partial to libertarian-anarchist politics.

I when I figured out that this guy was talking anarchy,
I immediately thought of the bomb—throwing, acid-pitching,
anarchists that were described to me in fifth grade history
class at Park Place School in Point Breeze. I was worried.

But these folks in Spain were different than I had_
originally figured. The origins of the spanish anarchists
were with the poorest of the poor. Their rhetoric was and
is fired with working-class pride, rejection of fascism and
private corporations, and suprisingly enough, strong on
personal liberties. They were telling me that the unions
should run just about everything. Richardo showed me the
headquarters of the anarchist labor union in Barcelona.
It is called the CNT and their headquarters lS decked in
a hugh red and black flag. They came out of the closet
when Franco died, and now have about 50,000 members.

(CLUE)

That's what I'm asking these daysas
Congress, though it is peacetime,
seems determined to pass any one of
a nuber of bills to conscriptyoung
people for either national or mili-
tary service. Is it a crime? I
think so. To ask a young man or
woman to spend formative years of
early adulthood learning to obeyor-
ders meant to override the inclina-
tion and ability to think for him
or herself, is a crime. I also
think it's an authoritarian lesson,
and that we teach it to our kids at
our peril. Conscription, for what-
ever purpose, treats kids as gov-
ernment property rather than as the
reason for government, and I be-
lieve people ought not to serve but
be served by government. We used
to object when press gangs went a-
round taking folks from whatever
business they were engaged in and
making them do the king's bidding.
But years of war, each one supposed
to make subsequent wars unnecessary,
and years of scary stories about how
pitiful and helpless this giant and
overarmed country is, have dulled
our’senses. We have learned to ac-
cept government's contention that
we were born to serve it.

Or have we? Jefferson wrote,when
the colonies declared their inde-
pendence from a country that wasal-
ways at war, that pressed men into
service and bled far—off citizens
of taxes, that governments were in-

~stituted"among men" to secure the

inalienable rights of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness, and
that governmenusget their just pow-

ers from the consent of thegoverned.

Now in the first place, though mem-
bers of Congress say they aren't
hearing from their constituents,
they haven't asked for our consent
in the matter of conscription.
Congress has worked fast and quiet-
ly, tring to sneak one version or
another of a draft bill through V
without arousing opposition, by
such means as tacking conscription
on as an item to a defense appro-
priation bill. Without national
debate thereis no way of knowing
whether or not we consent to con-
scription by government.

I would not consent. For con-
scription violates the inalienable
rights of people that government
was instituted to secure. By serv-
ing the government involuntarily,
young people have to give up their
liberties, their pursuits of hap-
piness, even their lives to serve
ends decreed -- though often un-
known because classified - by mys-
terious governmental process.

During the most trying days of the Spanish civil war in
perated the telephone ter-

l936, I'm told the CNT union
minals throughout republican Spain. I had to laugh when
I thought about 50,000 anarchist telephone operators.

Anyway, politics are a lot different in Barcelona than

in Pittsburgh. Hell, you're labeled a leftist in Pitts-
burgh if you vote for Tom Forester.

One evening, I was flying down a dark narrow Barcelona

back street about 60 miles an hour in a car loaded with

Spaniards and Argentinians when we screached to a halt
next to a public telephone.

of them huddled around the phone and Richardo pulled
out a thin, firm wire and slyly inserted it into a key

hole on the side of the phone. Turning his tool with the

precission of a master machinist, Richardo made contact,

and the phone was ready for a toll-free call anywhere in
the world.

"This is great!", I thought to myself. As soon as the
' Argentinan finished talking to their loved ones back home,

I called my pals back in Pittsburgh and got a progress
report on the Steel Curtain.

I learned that every European telephone booth has its
flaw. In Amsterdam, you must hook up a web of wires
from the mouth—piece to the cord to the phone box and_
BINGO- free calls. In Germany, you must take a l2 ounce
hammer and bang on the receiver about 50 times. In
Italy, you must kidnap the operator and hold the phone
book ransom.

One misimpression I had of Spain, nurtured during a
drive I took with some friends to Mexico in l973,
was that the Spanish people are elitist and partial to a
rigid class structure.‘ In Mexico, it is noticable that
the ruling class has more Spanish blood than the poorer
folks, who are predominately of Indian ancestory.

Looks are often decieving.

I left Barcelona because of economic determinism---I
spent all of my money. It would have been nice to go to
the Balaric Islands in the Mediterranian, which are said
to be warm, sensual and inexpensive. But no bucks. You
kngw how it is._ Some things you have to let slide by in

i e.

My last night in Barcelona was a fantastic, soggy,

staggering blowout. I drank the wine and kissed a sweet

blushing brown-eyed Spanish woman. She said I was
"excelente”.

Awaking before dawn, I dressed and packed my duffle bag

in the darkness, left a thank you note to Richardo and
Rosa along with my address and an English edition of
Homage to Catalonia. I took a slug of cold milk, washed
my face, stepped on the cat, and descended five flights
of stairs to the damp 4 o'clock streets of Barcelona.
The sun came up through the train car window and I
could see the entire city from the overlooking northern
mountains. Moments later, the train passed a suburban

industrial town where I saw a huge smoke belching factory
.;and without turning my head saw a peasant rinding his mangy
donkey near a row of houses that weren't fit for dogs.

I thought to myself, "this plase is nice, but they've
got their problems, too."

The only thing that consoled me about leaving Barcelona,
.-the gem of the Mediterranean, was written on my railway

ticket/PARIS.

So who benefits? Like a good de- 0 t
tective, trained on Nancy Drew, Sher-3 a
lock Holmes, Nero Wolf, Rodney Al1yn,§fg
Alan Grant and others, I can discoverj
who doesn't benefit. Certainly not
the kids who's lives will be dis-
rupted without their or our con-

sent to form a ready pool of man-and egg,

woman-power for foreign adventures,
or who's lives may be forfeited al-
together should government decide to E
expend them in battle. Certainly
not their parents, who have given Q
them birth and nurture, who have fed ‘
and clothed them, visited teachers,
bandaged scraped knees, taken temp- ,
eratures, scolded, mended jeans, and E
so on. Certainly not civilian soc-
iety which needs creative, self-
sufficient, independent adults cap-
able of saying no to bad ideas andof
thinking for themselves. The mili-
tary already has its big guns for ( g
big wars and a volunteer force (ac-' fl
tive and reserve) of over 3 million
so it's hard to see what it needs

with more men and women unlesssome— §,'

one has in mind more wars in the a
third world like the one that did so “
much harm in Indochina. ' *

So who benefits? Well, I ran a-
cross the clue back there in the
apple tree with Nancy Drew. Nancy
and Carson Drew, their friends and
neighbors, always benefited from
locking up all those suspicious
people who were forever lurking a—'
round looking dishonest. They were
busy preserving a way of life for
the people of River Heights, who
were well-dressed, well—housed,
well-educated, gracious. They
didn't dirty their hands the way
the lesser crooks did, whom Nancy
always caught, and their where-
withal came from -- as nearly as
I could tell —- the air, But
clearly they had interests to pro-
tect and the scruffy folks knew it
and resented it.

 

 

Thanks to Nancy, I graduated to ,V
more sophisticated stuff and now gjg
know that it's the people whodon't “
look the part that you have tosus-
pect. They are those with wealth
and power and influence over Con-
gress, Nancy's and Carson's neigh-
bors in River Heights, and they
want obedient, expendable citizens
at home whom they can send abroad
to protect their interests.

HOW'MANY NUCLEAR ENGINEERS DOES

IT TAKE TO SCREW

Light bulbs are commonplace
pieces of electrical equipment.
From the moment we first turn on
the bedroom light in the morning
until we turn off the lights at
night we are surrounded by light
bulbs...Sometimes bulbs burn out,
but most people have no trouble
replacing them... except nuclear
engineers. Recently there occur-
ed four accidents at nuclear power
plants which were caused by the
seemingly simple act of replac-
ing burnt out light bulbs.

l The first accident occured in
March, l977, at the Dresden 2
reactor outside of Chicago.
(This is the same reactor, which,
on June 5, l978, had the acci4
dent on which the movie China
Syndrome is based.) In attempt-
ing to remove a burnt out indi-
cator bulb, the operator acci-
dentally twisted the wires and
caused a short circuit. The
short circuit caused a surge of
power which knocked out other
equipment on the same system,
including a heater which heats
the water going into the core.
For 20 minutes, the water going
into the core was l50 degrees
colder than it should have been.

This might not sound like such
a terrible thing, except that the

_ plant was designed for a maximum

temperature drop of only l00
degrees and not 150 degrees.
Therefore, the significance of
this light bulb-caused accident
is that it surpassed the worst
accident for feedwater heaters
which the designers of the plant
had imagined and planned for -
this is called surpassing the

4-3

maximum credible accident, and
is never supposed to happen.

Four months later, in July,
l977, an almost identical
accident happened at the Mill-
stone l reactor in Connecticut.
A technician was replacing an
indicator light and twisted the
wires, which caused a~short
circuit. which led to a train of
events which eventually resulted
in shutting off the supply of
water to the core. As a result
of this accident, the reactor
was closed down for one and a
half days.

In March, l978, a light bulb
accidentally fell into an open
light assembly on the control
panel at the Rancho Seco reactor
in California. That created a
short circuit in the power supply
to the sensors which measure
pressure, temperature, water flow
and water level in the reactor.
The readings on these control

 

 

Somerville Community News/cpf

guages went haywire, sending con-
flicting signals to the automatic
controls, and forced the baffled
reactor operators to make an
emergency shutdown of the plant.
The worst of these light bulb
accidents occured in October,
l978, at the Pilgrim reactor out-
side Boston. when changing a
burned-out bulb, the circuit was
accidentally grounded, which
caused an overcurrent relay to
open and cut off the generator.
This necessitated the emergency
shutdown of the reactor. However.
this time, a steam relief valve
accidentally opened and dld n0t
close again until the reactor had
lost two thirds of its pressure-
This time it took is days_bei0re
the plant was working again and
cost the consumers eight million
dollars.

  

West Germany/cpf

These four accidents suggest a
disturbing trend. The first one
exceeded the maximum credible
accident for one important part
of the system, but did not inter-
rupt service. The second acci-
dent interrupted service for one
and a half days, while the third
and fourth accidents interrupted
service for five and l8 days
respectively. All four accidents
were caused while replacing light
bulbs, and each was worse that
the preceding ones.

So how many nuclear engineers
does it take to screw in a light
bulb? More, it seems, than the
designers planned for.

MODERN-DAY
INQUISITION

Ralph Nader, testifying
before a congressional committee
recently, was accused by one
congressman of being against
technology.

Mr. Nader retorted that,
although he wanted all nuclear
plants already built to be
Closed and all nuclear plants
contemplated left unbuilt, he
was not against technology.

But the congressman's charge
reminded me of the old days when
heretics were accused of being
against God and for the devil.
Implicit in the charge is the
notion that high technology is
sacrosanct, that we must simply
endure the hardships it imposes.

Surely, all of us are aware
these days that very high
technologies have the capacity
for very large disasters.

Three Mile Island was a
harbinger of nuclear-plant
accidents: the DC-l0, for as
yet unclear reasons, fell with
more than 270 people to crash
almost On top Of a settlement
of trailer houses; and Skylab
fell from its orbit.

The point is not being
against or for technology but
living within our means.

If we go hog-wild for elaborate
technologies which consume with-
out replenishing finite resources,
which require a degree Of per-
fection impossible for human
beings, we will have to pay

Rockwell should think about donating

about supplying the baby, family

just an empty manger with this

Too often when people dis-
cuss social change -— makingthe

J conditions of their lives mater-

ially better and more just --

;. one hears comments like these:
':""That's great on paper, but

it'll never work;” or "You just
can't get everybody working to-
gether because people are greedy by

' nature;” or "It's impossible to

fight these big companies.” Fortun-
ately, however, not everyone agrees
with these negative statements, and
those who don't go to prove that
alternatives to our present society
really can work.

One of the most concrete examp-
les of such an alternative is Pitts-
burgh's co-operative food distribu-
tion system, Consuer Cooperatives
of Pittsburgh, or CCP for short.

’~.‘.Cbmprised of approximately fifty

food co—ops and buying clubs in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, CCP

‘supplies its members with high-qual-

ity, low-cost food through the ap-

‘ »plication of the principles of co-

operation.,
'Cb-operation is a theory of
social and economic organization

I H" which stands at odds with the cap-

italistic assumption that competi-
tion is the driving force behind the
production and distribution ofgoods
and services, and the foundation of
hman relations. It is based on the
premise that all people have basic,

«V common needs and that these needs
. can be more equitably and bounti-

fully fulfilled if people work to-
gether rather than against one
another.

_ The.guiding principle of co-
operative economdcs is that goods
are produced and services rendered
to satisfy the needs of people
rather than to provide a profit for
an_entrepreneur. As a result,
while capitalism tends to "create
scarcity out of plenty,” reducing
the amount (or availability) and
quality of commodities in order
to maximize profits, co-operation
insures a sufficient supply of
high-quality commodities at the
lowest possible cost.

Although there are many differ-
ent kinds of co—ops -- food co—ops,
housing co—ops, credit unions, bank-
ing co-ops, marketing co—ops, even
volunteer fire companies —- they
all have in common the idea that
peqle can gain some savings or
better service for themselves by

Food foriPeopIe,

pooling their resources and acting
in their common interest. CII“s
motto, "food for people, not for
profit,” succinctly and accurately
reflects this ethic.

CCP is owned by and serves two
types of co-ops, buying clubs and
store-front food co-ops. Buying
clubs are'usually organized on a
neighborhood or commmnity level.
Members are given a list of foods
the CCP warehouse can supply, and
each household places its order
with the member of the club who's
turn it is to compile and collate
orders. This member then places
the club's full order with the
warehouse. Several days later, the
goods are delivered to the club's
break—down point (a large rom
equipped with a scale, some scoops,
and packaging materials) on the
co—op truck, or members come to
the warehouse to pick up the goods
themselves. Everyone helps to un-
load the truck and to break—down
the bulk items into smaller parcels
for distribution to each household.
By doing the work themselves and
buying in bulk by combining their
purchasing power, members realize
a substantial savings. S

Store-front co-ops, such as the
East End Food Co-op in East Liber-
ty and the Semple Street Co-op in
Oakland, look and operate more
like conventional retail stores.
Members pay a small fee to join’
and are required to work a few
hours each month at the store
packaging, cleaning, pricing,
stocking the shelves, or perform»
ing some other necessary function.

‘Those members who don't work, with

the exception of senior citizens;
pay a substantially higher mark-
up on their groceries than those
who do. Buying at a store-front
co-op is just like buying at a
retail store, except that you
wait on yourself and the total
price rung up is 10% to 30% less'
than you would have paid at a '
supermarket.

Again, like with food buying clubs
co-op members save money because of
combined purchasing power, low over-
head (no muzak or fancy packaging),
member participation in the opera-
tion of the store, and low mark—ups
on goods due to the absence of a
drive for profit. Control over what
goods the co—op carries and what
the mark—up on products should be
is exercised by members either
through an elected Board of Direct-
ors or through general membership
meetings.

Since both types of co-ops pur-
chase goods through their own co-

operative warehouse, the latter is

3:

Not for Profits

able to realize‘great savings by
purchasing large amounts of goods
at wholesale prices. Eliminating
intermediary food handlers keeps
prices down by cutting out the
profits of the middleman and mak-

ing unnecessary such things as
expensive packaging, processing,
and advertising; it sometimes
prevents the introduction of
chemical additives (like preserv-
atives) to foods. too. Buying from
other co-operative networks like

the Peoples‘ Wherehouse in Ann

Arbor, tends to lower Costs, as
does contracting for some items
directly from producers.

Through the system described
above, some 15,000 individuals '

in this region have cast their
economic votes for co-operation.
They maintain their co-ops and
their warehouse for many reasons:
to fight the duble-digit infla-
tion found in the supennarkets;
to provide themselves with a
more pleasant, socially reward- ‘
ing place to shop than the
sterile, alienating, plasticized
chain stores afford; to obtain
purer, more high-quality food.

But implied in their participa-
tion in the co-operative system
is also a dream, or ideal, about
a society run to serve all people,
not just the rich, a society
where people co-operate rather
than compete, where human rela-
tionships are more important
than profit margins.

‘ People taking control over their
lives out of the hands of anonymous
corporations and returning it to ’
themselves: that is part and parcel
of the co-operative spirit. The
members of CCP areni content to
simply criticize agribusiness, high
prices and corporate control; they
,are taking things into their own
hands to prove that the co-operative
alternative can work, can bring
people together to achieve a common
goal, can challenge the big compan-
1es.

If you're ready to help yourself;
call CCP at 361-1521 to find out how
you can join wdth your friends and
neighbors to provide your commmnity
with food for people, not for profit.

c REV. EMMANUEL D’EGo.

PRIEST.

  AUTHOR. LECTURER

Father Emmanuel D'Ego of
St. Caesar's Parish here, died
yesterday afternoon, stricken
with an attack of gout while .
teeing off the l3th hole at the
Elysian Fields Country Club.
He‘was pronounced dead on
arrival at Ultimate Mercy
Hospital. He was 58.

Father D'Ego's accomplish-
ments during his ministry were
many and varied. At the time
of his death, he was serving as
Special Chaplain to this city's
chapters of the American Med-
ical Association, the American
Bar Association, and was the

‘Chaplain serving at the Chapel

of the Chosen Children, Elysian
Fields Country Club. He also
dedicated himself as missionary
extrordinaire to the financially
beset and extremely wealthy,
including local financiers and
political figures.

Father also instituted several

organizations of special interest
. to women--—The women's Council

for Charismatic Pregnancy,
Sacred Order of wives, and
Ladies Aid Society for Clerical
Authority, among others.

At St. Caesar's Father

Although a marked rise in cases
of malnutrition and exposure

Father D'Ego also developed
several lecture series on sub-

them, "The Parousia and Me,”
"Let's walk on water," and
“You, Too, Can Be Perfect.“ He

May the Lord forgive me, but I am convinced
that the working man has to be powerfully suspi-.

prayer as a solution to his problems as a worker.

Do not be alarmed, my little ones, I am not
taking a stand against prayer. I want workers to
pray, I want all people to pray, but I grievously,
distrust and dislike the use of prayer as an indus-

"Christian" approaches to labor relations. Pro-‘
moters of this sort of "Christianity" have more in
common with businessmen than with laborers. One
does not hear them urging businessmen to tone down
their aggressive competitive inclinations. They
put the cart-before the horse as they urge workers
to vie with each other to produce and serve the W

SAME MESSAGE,

DIFFERENT ncsrousts 

Two weeks ago the people on
my morning bus were talking
about how wonderful the pope was
at the United Nations. There he
stood, bringing a moral voice to
the world, and talking about the
insanity of the arms race and
the need for more cooperation in
the world. A

Last week the same people

- were highly upset by Castro's

visit to the United States and
his speech at the United Nations.
There he stood, bringing a moral

, voice to the world, and talking

about the insanity of the arms

race and the need for more

cooperation in the world.
Funny how both men point to

the irrationality of spending $300 fi_iT

billion on the military each year
while 30 million people literally
starve to death. Both say that
we cannot have peace without
justice. It's strange how one

is seen as the vicar of Christ,_

while the other is viewed as evil,.§["

In fact, I can't understand
why Castro wasn't even more
popular than the pope to the
people on my bus. Castro said
he favored the Pirates to take
the world Series and he didn't
call any of them immoral for
their use of birth control.

of Thomas Bell's Out of This Furnace ers, and to denounce the notorious

this play any seem_at—first austere.
The four players are continuously
on stage. All wear essentially the
same costume. With the exception of
Father K, the players take on a
series of roles, indicating the
transition fnan one role to another
by walking to the back of the stage
and facing away from the audience.
Props are minhnal.

Moreover, the character of Father

K is somewhat ambiguous. Evidently
he was aware of his wit and good
looks. In one of his frequent en-
counters With the Bishop it is said

that nothing alleged in criticism of

Father K begins.to compare with the

rumors circulated by his own parish-

ioners. He lived well, was rmored
to keep one cask of wine for the

sacrament and another for the sacri-

lege, and (so I was told after the
play) drove about in a chauffeured

Packard. (This may in part have been

due to the fact that he had a bad
leg, ultimately amputated.)

But, so, evidently it was. If we
are to "tell it like it is” about
the United States Steel corporation
we must also tell it like it is
about those who go forth as Davids
against the corporations, then and
now. ‘

Who can presume to say what in the
nature of tenperament and life style

was required for an ordinary parish
priest to permit union members to
neet in his church, to take up col-
lections for the aid of the strik-

Pennsylvania constabulary, in the
sane words used by his flock, as
”cossacks”? One thing is for sure:
Father K had a sense of humor. At
one point he says that the most ef-
fective three-in-one phenomenon he
knows about is a-kind of oil.

' In writing the play, the Iron
Clad painstakingly gathered its por-
trait of Father K from diocesan doc-
uments and the mmory of Father K
preserved by word of mouth in his
parish. As is their custom, the cast
gathered with the audience at the
end of the play to see if any one in
attendance had additional infomnntion
which might be incorporated.

This play is an invitation to
think through and act out the vision
that labor and the church should
join hands against Mannnn. Individ-
uals like Monsignor Charles Rice,
organizations like the Tristate Con-
ference on the Impact of Steel and
the Ecumenical Coalition of the
Mahoning Valley, and_situations like
U.S. Steel's attempt to induce its
workers at Ambridge to take a wage
cut, remind us that this story is
also about us. .

Blacklisting Brian

‘In recent weeks much has been
written about the latest Monty
Python film, "Life of Brian."
Most of this has been out-and-out
condemnation by people who

obviously haven't seen the film,

aren't familiar with the Python
style of comedy, and consequent-
ly do not know what they are
‘talking about.

‘Contrary to current opinion,
“Life of Brian” does not present
Jesus Christ as an ob3EEt of

I mockery. what the film does do
is spoof organized religion and
people in general; something that
the six, highly talented Python
members have been doing since
their BBC days (l969-l974)--
long before the idea of “Brian”
was conceived.

This controversy brings to
mind a similar situation when
the rock opera, “Jesus Christ
Superstar" first appeared.
That, too, was thought to be
a blasphemous thing that was

47

certain to destroy the
m°"a75 Of People everywhere.
Did it? Have we become a
wanton nation because of it?
Hardly.

This country was founded on
the principle that each of us
has the right to choose things
for ourselves. By allowing a
few religious leaders to decide
which films we should and should
not see, we are,returning to
the blacklisting of the 50's;
or worse yet, moving ahead to
the “Big Brother" days of
George 0rwell's "T984".

. when you come right down to
it, is all this for—and-against
bickering really necessary?
After all, it is only a movie.
If this type of thing offends
you, then don't see it; but
don't try to force your beliefs
on others.

I went to Miami for the Super

came in droves and camped out in
pick—ups, guzzling Irons, sporting
the black and gold jerseys ( a
1,000 Lamberts and Hams), and red
and blue bandannas for all that
sweat Pittsburghers are used to.
Almost 20,000 I guess - most with- .
out tickets like me - came right
from work. Partying. Proud, rowdy
but definitely not snobbish -
except maybe for the USS, Alcoa
and Mellon executives in their
private party tents. Dallas jetted

in or arrived in Caddys or monster
campers. Before the game, the

hunkies of Pittsburgh blocked the
6-lane highway to the Orange Bowl,

some 10 gallon htﬁ capped very
nervous grins because the class
difference was so obvious in the
fans. That made me think to myself
with a certain amount of amusement,
"good thing for Dallas this is just
a football game..“

A weird feeling - like the ‘
Steelers were not just a great team
but representing the good guys in
black jerseys. Now, I've lived long
enough to know that behind every
feeling, there's a material reality
-- so let's compare, for a moment,
Pennsylvania and Texas.

bad news is that they'll also take

a definite high noon brewing over

we are a solid fam-i-lee when Super-

 S kids want more

The rate of unemployment among
young people of twenty-five and
under, in the United States is
atrocious. Young people want to
‘work, but they can't find jobs
that meet.their aspirations..

More than their fathers and
mothers, they claim the right to
profit from their aptitudes and
talents; to participate in decision
making and to assume responsi-
bilities. On the other hand they
willingly challenge authority, are
less loyal to their employers

.»and less involved in their work.

The reaction of young people to
work in general at "dead—end—jobs"
appears to be a serious obstacle
to their employment.Whi1e young
people seek "interesting work,"
the type of job offered them often

ygdoes nothing for the fulfillment
ljof their expectations.

The young

then refuse to work out of
"obligation". Many of them prefer

. unemployment to accepting a job

which they consider as a "dead—end".
A The unfavorable opinion that
employers have of young workers

nhurts their employment in the work

iienterprises think that the young

The head's of American

people have false ideas about the
working world. "They are more
undisciplined and more unstable
than their elders. Their
absenteeism is greater", they say.
Some corporations feel that various

lhsocial welfare measures and
‘Xunemployment insurance are not

stimulating young people towards
work in general. They also say
that the education system does
not train the young in the right
occupations and that their
training is too inadequate, and

‘too theoretical.

What can be done? Only a very

'~.great capacity for innovation
‘mainly, at the level of work

organization and production will

‘allow us to take up the challenge
of youth. The first possibility

to explore is the improvement of

the quality of the work life: job
enrichment, participation of

1 workers in management decision,
,.AND inducement for further educa-
i_tion,~etc..

It would be appropriate to adapt the
machine to man, rather than the re-
verse, which is the present tendency.
A few things that have to be done

in the near future are: l) lowering
the retirement age, 2) reducing the
hours of work, 3) lengthening vaca-
tion periods, among other things.
Union and management must meet the
needs of young people in the 1980's

STEVENS BOYCOTT

Protests by the boycott
committee have proven effective,
Gimbels has agreed to stop selling
J. P. Steven's products in the
Pittsburgh area.

Following demonstrations at all
the Gimbels stores in the area, a
Gimbels representative met with
Paul Stackhouse of the Allegheny
County Labor Council.

Following the meeting,

Gimbels agreed to stop selling
Stevens products in this area.

I 281-9983 I

The other two major department
store chains in the area, Hornes
and Kaufmans do not carry
Stevens products now and have
agreed not to in the future.

To realize these goals along
with others has required the
efforts of about 300 people over
the last two years. Hopefully
this type of hard work will
prove successful with the
boycott's current endeavors. They
are now seeking to force Hill's
and Geebees to remove Stevens
products from their shelves.

  Questions for the 80’s

will “we the people" still have’
the problems in the l980's that

we have had in the l970's. will

corporate greed for profits

continue to cause accidents

from overloaded trucks with

faulty brakes that tear up our
roads and threaten the safety
of our citizens?

 

‘ ; oosAsT£R-> U

will we continue to have acci-
dents from trucks and trains
carrying lethal and chemical
wastes that threaten the lives
and safety of residents of
entire towns? _
will we continue to bus

school children away from the
safety of neighborhood schools
to far away districts, or worse
provide them with a Pass to
ride on Public Transportation
making them vulnerable to the
overtures of sex perverts?

what will happen in case of an
.attack or an emergency where

it will be impossible for
their parents to reach them?
Also, where will we get the

gas or the money to pay for it
for all those additional buses
they want?

will the News Media still be

as biased and prejudicial and
unfair that it still will not
print both sides of a story or

..event whether local or world-

wide. will it continue‘it's

unfair harrassment and criticism

of every work or move of our.
President as he attempts to
_deal with the problems he
inherited from his predecessors,
and then glorify a man who left
his office in disgrace and whose

policies of unwarranted bombings

in North Vietnam and Cambodia

and support of the Shaw of Iran \’-

are now coming home to haunt us.
will Congress continue its
erratic voting like giving Senior
Citizens a 9% increase in

‘Social Security benefits, then
turning around and voting a 25%
to 30% rent increase in the

rent of low-income Seniors living
in Public Housing and then voting
to give billions of dollars for
military hardware to countries
over seas.

will rising food and fuel
prices pose a problem to many
whether to eat or freeze?
The plight of the low-income,
no-income and unemployed blue
collar workers and Senior Citi-
zens on a low fixed income is
so acute they are being priced
out of their very existence
and will soon be known as the
“Yankee Boat” people as they
find themselves up the well-
known creek, not only boatless,
but without a paddle. ~

ywill doctors, hospitals and
drug companies who lobbied

A _against Medicare continue to

feed like ghouls off the sick
bodies and minds of the mis-
fortunes of the ill and_con-
tinue raising their prices?
will our government continue

to encourage Nuclear Plants to
overcharge customers for the
billions they spend on Nuclear
Power and only produce about

l2% of our electricity? what
about the radio-active and
chemical wastes that are so
deadly that the effects last for
thousands of years and would
eventually pollute every part of
our land and water and could
lead to serious illnesses like
Cancer and Leukemia. Overseas
Nuclear Plants send their radio-
active waste to this country:

we build special containers, and
it travels on special ships and
it is then buried in the Carolina
states. .

 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  

51 i«;Im..\ —A'l'l./\!V |‘1(_;

 

Last year l2 million
gallons was shipped here, and
supposing one of those ships
sank at sea? what a pollution
of our oceans!

will Israel still refuse to
talk to the PLO and give the
3 million Palestinians their
own homeland? Since 1973 the
OPEC Countries have said they
would raise the oil prices if
Israel refused to talk and to
date they have refused and
since we support the Israelis
this has aggravated our own oil
problems. why doesn't the
United States policy of freedom
from oppression and the right ‘
to a homeland extend to the.
Palestinians? .

  

will the big oil corporations
still spend millions of dollars

on lobbying with our congressmen..

and senators in a fight to secure
rights for an "oil" witch hunt

in ' our children's herit-
age of National Parks, Forests,
waterways and Coastal fishing.
regions, that would lead to
‘their destruction and finally the
apathy of the American Public

is appalling in all these prob-
lems and especially-the one
concerning their own very
existence and that is while

- jobs and sources of employment

go down the drain due to
corporation's greed for profits
and their transferring their‘
plants to overseas slave

labor area, the American

worker still buys merchandise
made overseas. "To be a real

President Carter announced
today that he wants to see home
monitoring of radiation as
national policy by I990: “a
meter in every home." The FEA
would administer the system,
checking rads monthly just as

,gas and electric readers now

If I were a pessimist, I could re-
cite a long list of the evils that
lie in wait for us in the future
(oil shortages, rising prices, wide-
§pread unemployment, terrorism,
increased pollution, and perhaps,
even atmic war). But in my opinion
there are enough disaster predictors
in America today. That's not my
style. Those who know me will attest
that I'm a die-hard optimist. To me,
dwelling on the problems of society
1S only another form of laziness--
it's the easy way out. Too many
people give up. They dig the-
selves into a rut and stay there.
"It's no use to try, you can't win.
You can't fight City Hall. Big
bsiness runs this country." I
hear these phrases every day. All
they are are excuses. An excuse
for not voting, an excuse for not
getting involved and especially an
excuse for not having to work for

a better life. No one ever told me
that life would be easy. It's a
constant struggle full of risks and
sometimes failures. But there are
the times when you can look back

at what you did and say "I did it.
It was hard but damn it, I won."

I'm not talking about contests
where you win a car or money, but
the contest of life where you win
the satisfaction of knowing that
you rule your own life. So don't

be afraid to take a chance to fight
the system. I won't guarantee that
you'll succeed and you may very well
fail, but what have you got if
you've never tried. So don't oun-
plain about the problems you have,
but start working on the solutions.

What's caning in the 80's?

I hope a time when people take re-
sponsibility for their lives. No
more excuses, if you don't like the
way things are, do something about
it--at least try. That sums up what
I want to see in the 80's—-a world
that tries.

Vote ‘em out
Write it down
or Pack it in

I have been asked by Steelworker
Evans, in light of my articles to
the Press to write something for
the "80's", so here goes.

To begin with I am neither
soothsayer, seer, nor do I have a
crystal ball, I am only a retired
Mill Hunk who has time to reflect
on the past and hope for better
things in the future.

As far'as the future is
concerned, we must all remember
that no matter what our race,
color, creed or political
affiliations, we are, come hell or
high water, Americans. We have
too many enemies outside our
shores, including some of our
"allies" to fight among ourselves.

I believe that we should vote
not for party but for the best
available man or woman and I also
believe that we should write to
our elected officials whenever we
feel that we have been given the
shaft. .

When was the last time any of
your readers wrote to the above
mentioned, believe me I have!

Let them know how you feel

; about everything, after all aren't
there more of us than them.

I look forward with hope because
without hope and determination we
might just as well pack it in.

BILL HINZEL
RETIRED STEELWORKER

As I begin to write this essay
for The Mill Hunk Herald, I can
see in the book shelves across

my office walls rows of books

devoted to the general theme of

futurology. They range in
content from discussions of

the efforts to predict the coming
of the next ice age to learned

analyses of the fate of the

Third world, the coming of new
technological marvels, the in-
evitable collapse of the dollar
and such oft told tales as the

global energy crisis,-famine,
age
global ambitions. I am

concerned with the future,
though professionally, as an

historian, I deal with the past,
a past, which I tell my students,
is but prologue to what is to be.
I am convinced that if this gen-

eration does not have day by

day concern with the future - in

all its possibilities -— some
future will overwhelm us. we
will become the debris tossed

around by the wave of the future, '

not masters of our destinies.

Even short term predictions

about the l980’s in the USA
must start with some flat
assertions about the state of
our society and isolate those
constraints which are apt to
remain constant during the
period under review.
the following list of con-

ditions and of social processes:

l. The age of cheap energy

is over.

2. The age of cheap food
is over. .

3. The age of cheap capital
is over

4. The age of the exponen-
tial growth of the popu—.

lation and the production

of most types of comod-
ities is over.

U1

poration is the chief
shaper of American
destinies is over.

:6. The age of the political
dominance of the tradi-
tional two party system
is over; this will fall

becomes more aware that
traditional politics

has become a huge con
game, akin to sports and
show business. There

may be one last hurrah of

elections by media hype,

public relations, manipu-
lation of corrupt politic-

al machines and outright

and the nearness of a new dark

fraud. But the trend
seems clear enough. well
over a third of the popu-
lation has expressed an
interest in a third party.
55% of the population does
not even care to vote.

The traditional guardians

of public order: and morals,
police, firemen, municipal
officials and employees,
school teachers, etc. no
longer feel an overriding
loyalty to the communities
that employ them but strike
for their own well being

as they define it.

The financial viability of
self run local governments
has ended. Note the irre-
versible fiscal crises of a
New York City, Cleveland
and Wayne County (Detroit).
Note the spread of urban
blight in places like
Philadelphia, Gary, Newark,
Buffalo, - a human disaster
that cannot be compensated I
for by building spectacular
shopping malls, condominiums
or corporate palaces of
glass and stainless steel;

The decline of the schol-
astic ability of our stu-
dent population will
continue and this will
tend to erode the compet-
itive position of the
United States in the

' global market place as this

depends on scientific and
technological talent.

A permanent "underclass"

‘bound to poverty and “"

spiritual despair has been
created by those mysterious
"market forces" that we were

told were the guarantors of V.

our liberties and our

eternal progress. To the
above, one might want to
add the demographic fact-
ors: the declining birth

  
 

A rate and the linked fact

that the population as a
whole is aging: therefore

I that a larger percentage

of our people are over 65
years, and hence unpro-
ductive in-the "tradition-
al" sense. Furthermore,

the social security system
which was supposed to sup-
port life in those "golden
years“ is facing bankruptcy.
And what is the value of
private or union pension

funds invested in Chrysler,

w. T. Grant, the Penn

Central, the Milwaukee
Railroad, or Youngstown
Sheet and Tube...? ”

Prediction against a background
such as this, is a chancy '
affair:

But fools will rush in:

1:

Class lines will harden
and tend to coincide with
ethnic divisions.

Religious lines will be
drawn more sharply as pop-
ular piety and conversion
missions, backed by hugei
financial resources move
to center stage.

The old order of establish-
ment linked Labor leaders
will die out or be pushed
aside. Ed Sadlowski types,
uninhibited by outworn
mythologies will appear.

It will no longer be a
matter of heresy or treason
to advocate the Community
ownership of energy
sources, public utilities,
means of transportation

and food supply systems.
Majorities for all of this
are already in place or
will be by the mideighties.

In our foreign relations,

the imperatives for global
cooperation will probably

outweigh the pressures of

those who hope for a quick
military fix by seizing

O

the Persian Gulf states or’ '

playing the China card or
bombing the hell out of

: Havana or Moscow.

The urge to preserve Rhodesia
and South Africa "for whites
only” will be dampened by the

threats of riots in all American
Somoza and the Shah of

cities.
Iran will be joined by a half
dozen new tyrants-in-exile.

  GUESS MESS

Predicting the future, what a
ridiculous idea. Let's face it,
‘everything affects everything else.
For instance, An orangutan farts in
New Guinea and global wind currents
change. A miniscule amount but an a-
mount nevertheless. The same fart
produces a change in the amount of

. various organic compounds in the
atmosphere. V

The truth is, that fart pro-
duces an.infinite number of changes
into the environment, some crazy
Life Science professor could spend
his entire life analyzing and»
studying that fart and not be able
to explain all the revelations of
nature contained in it.
