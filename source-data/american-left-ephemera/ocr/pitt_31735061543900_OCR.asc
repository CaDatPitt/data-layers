or at least a temporarily revived, body politic (other-
wise doomed), with a deferment of the ultimate or in-
evitable dissolution, and, consequently, an increase in
the violence of the spasms and death-throes of the dying
social organism.

And this_ is what is happening today.

The world is not out of joint because there arose in
Germany a perverted wretch of a creature named Hit-
ler, or a strutting mountebank and power-drunk ego-
maniacal despot in Italy, or a scheming, calculating,
petty bureaucracy in Russia, or an overriding military
despotism in Japan. And so forth. No, on the con-
trary, these governmental gangsters, petty dictators and
sabre~rattling martinets arose precisely because’ the
world is out of joint. The distinction is vital, and not
a mere rearrangement of words. For if We fully real-
ize that the puny autocrats who at the moment seem to
enjoy mass approval in their respective countries are
not the churners-up of the waters, but are themselves
but the ﬂotsam and jetsam, the scum,.as it were, that
has risen to the surface of the turbulent social sea of
our time, we shall have no diiiiculty in understanding
that the problem calls for more than a mere settlement
of accounts with these wretches—-—in short, that it is the
conditions which created them and made them possible,
rather than the creatures themselves, with which we
must deal.

These conditions are, of course, of more than local
signiﬁcance and peculiarity. The symptoms being World-
wide, the conclusion is inescapable that the cause is
world-wide, and it follows, then, that the remedy, what-
ever particular form it may take, must be universal in
character. The Socialist Labor Party has designated
world-wide capitalism as the cause, and each and every

8

 

incident of major importance taking place today con-
ﬁrms the conclusion that capitalism is directly respon-
sible for the world’s chaos and bloody disorders, that
no other conclusion can stand the test of reason and sci-
entiﬁc analysis, that no other conclusion makes sense.
And our remedy, our remedy for getting the world to
snap back into joint, is Socialism, the Industrial Re-
public of Labor, the international brotherhood of man,
based on an economy of plenty and social equality. And
we proclaim this to be the true democracy, the only de-
mocracy that will work, the only democracy wherein
the people will really rule, and under which neither des-
potism nor anarchy can make an appearance, nor (if
attempted) possibly survive.

 

II.
The Economic Basis of Bourgeois “Democracy.”

But, we are told, we have true democracy in this
country today. What's wrong with it? And if the
questioner is a native “Fifth Columnist,” or an “Amer-
ican Columnist” (that is, a member of the reactionary
outfit, “The American Column”), or just a common
ordinary capitalist press columnist, he is apt to add that
if you don’t like this democracy (or this country), go
back where you came from-—even if you are a native-
born Indian! Now, as to not liking this democracy,
we might tentatively reply that it is not so much a case
of not liking this democracy, but rather a case of not
liking the economic basis on which it rests and which
determines the practical working out of this democracy.
For, contrary to common belief, we Socialists are far
more passionately attached to democracy than are most
of those who swear by “our wayof life,” whatever that
may be. And as to going back to where we came from
-—-and without taking this naive riposte too literally lest
we restore all the country to the Indians l——we might
remind our columnists of whatever denomination that
a somewhat similar invitation was extended by the slave
power in this country to the critics of chattel slavery. If
you don’t like slavery, stay out of the slave states-—-go
back to where you came from, go up North! The
trouble with that advice was that slavery followed on
your heels, it had a way of refusing to stay where it
supposedly belonged, being forever in quest of new ter-
ritory, new ﬁelds in which to root the abominable evil
of human slavery. And so with the economic system

I0

 

which its defenders misname democracy———-wherever you
go you ﬁnd it, although in some countries it may be less
vicious than in others, while in other countries it oper-
ates without the base alloy of hypocrisy!

But undoubtedly we do have a sort of democracy
in this country, a very limited democracy, which, how-
ever, whatever may have been its original virtues and
usefulness, now fails to justify its designation, except
to those who are satisﬁed to accept shadow for sub-
stance, or form for content. And so we must ask our-
selves: What is true democracy———-has there ever been
such a thing, and (assuming that we haven’t got it
now) shall we ever have it again? We answer, yes,
there has been a true democracy; we have not got it

now, for the once healthy democracy inherited from our i

fathers has been worn down to the bone. But, when
the workers make up their minds, we will have it. again!

The true democracy which the race once enjoyed
was the democracy of the ancient communes, in this
country among the Indians, in Europe notably among
the Greeks, before the advent of private property. It
was a democracy of equality, but it rested on universal
poverty, and having achieved its elflorescence, remained
stagnant and suffered decay and corruption. Hence its
downfall. The democracy to come—-—Socialist Indus-
trial Democracy———will likewise be one of universal
equality, but it will rest on an economy of affluence, of
super—abundance. Hence, it will (contrary to the anci-
ent communal democracy) afford leisure and culture for
all; it will for that reason be incapable of stagnation,
and will thus not suffer decay and corruption, but rather
grow and expand both materially and culturally, multi-
plied by all the modern factors that make for human
happiness and well-being.

II

We see, then, that so far as forms are concerned,
there is nothing absolute about democracy. Like the
abstraction truth, democracy must be related to the eco-
nomic basis of thegiven society, th.e essential character-
istics of which it necessarily reﬂects. Emerson well said
that “No truth (is) so sublime but it may be trivial to-
morrow in the light of new thoughts.” As the truth of
one age may become the falsehood of a succeeding age,
so the democracy of “one age may become the despotism
of a succeeding age, though the shell of democracy sur-
vives, and though the name democracy is retained.
Truth, it has been well said, is that which ﬁts all the
facts in the case. Democracy may be said to be that
popular rule which ﬁts the economic facts and material
potentialities of a given period. The essence of democ-
racy, however, the enduring quality of democracy, is
that it is rule by the people, whatever be the particular
forms through which it is expressed, and whatever may
be the current purposes and designs for which it is exer-
cised and applied.

Deﬁnitions of “Democracy.”

But to get a clearer understanding of democracy,
let us examine brieﬂy some of its forms of manifesta-
tion, and let us review some of the deﬁnitions given of
it. Let us begin with the formal deﬁnitions. The Stand-
ard Dictionary tells us that democracy is “government
by the people; a system of government in which the
sovereign power of the state is vested in the people as
a whole, and is exercised directly by them or their
elected agents.”

Nominally, that fits the political democracy of the
United States. But let us look at Webster’s deﬁnition
of democracy, given as being “government by the pco~

I2

ple; a form of government in which the supreme power
is retained by the people and exercised either directly
(absolute or pure democracy) or indirectly (represen-
tative democracy), through a system of representation
and delegated authority periodicallyrenewed as in a
constitutional representative government, or republic.”

The term democracy derives from the Greek word
“deme” which is the designation‘ applied to a geo-
graphical unit in Attica’ —— that is, “deme” is the
political unit, the township, evolved by the Greek state-
builder Cleisthenes who lived some 500 years B. C.
“Deme” is now deﬁned as “a district,” “the people.” In
passing, it is of interest to note Lewis Henry Morgan’s
commentary on Cleisthenes and his epochal innovation,
the deme, or the township. While crediting Cleisthenes’s
forerunner, Solon, with launching the idea of a politi-
cal society, it took, said Morgan, nearly a century “be—
fore the idea of a state was fully developed in the Athe-
nian mind.” Referring to Cleisthenes as “a man of
the highest genius,” he reminds us that Cleisthenes di-
vided Attica “into a hundred demes, or townships, each
circumscribed by metes and bounds, and distinguished
by a name.” And Morgan adds: “Every citizen was
required to register himself [how very modernl], and
to cause an enrollment of his property in the deme in
which he resided. This enrollment was the evidence as
well as the foundation of his civil privileges.”

Thus was organized the ﬁrst political democracy, as
definitely distinguished from the earlier communal de-
mocracy Which had broken down. As? we see, the civil
privileges of the Athenian citizen rested on private

.13

  

property, whereas the denizen of the ancient commune
owned no individual or private property.

However, from the word deme was derived the
word demos, which deﬁnitely means “the people.” To
designate this political society as the ‘rule of the people,
the Word “Kratos” (meaning authority or rulership)
was added (“Demos-Kratos”), hence “democracy.”
Democracy, then, means, andcan only mean, rule of
and by the people, such relationship originally being
meaningless except as directly related to the economic

life and material possessions of the citizen.

The Greek political democracy has been analyzed
by Aristotle in considerable detail, and in certain re-
spects we ﬁnd similarities between the Athens democ-

racy and the democracy launched in the United States‘

in 1776. They were similar in that both contained vast

numbers of slaves who were considered property, or in-’

struments of production, rather than human beings. In
Athens, out of a total population of 500,000, only 90,-
000 were citizens who could vote and participate in
public affairs. Of the remainder, 365,000 were slaves,
and 45,000 aliens or freed slaves who possessed no
civil rights. The slaves, in fact, were scarcely consid-
ered human beings. Speaking of property and various

instruments of production, Aristotle observed that “in- A

deed the use made of slaves and of tame animals is not
very different; for both with their bodies minister to
the needs of life.” This conception, grotesque as it
sounds to us, was held by the Athenians as being per-
fectly natural. With that conception, and in View of
the economic development at that time, “the people” of
Athens numbered at most 135,000 out of the 500,000,
and the citizens numbered, as said, 90,000. When the
ancients, therefore, spoke of equality in a democracy,

14

 

they meant that equal rights prevailed among the 90,-
000 citizens. “If liberty and equality. . . . ,” said Aris-
totle, “are chieﬂy to be found in democracy, they will
be best attained when all persons alike share in the gov-
ernment to the utmost.”

“All persons,” then, obviously did not include the
majority of Athens’s population of 500,000 “souls”;
“all persons” meant the small minority of 90,000! It
is in the light of this we must understand and appraise
Athenian democracy, the democracy Which, as Aristotle
also observed, “arose from men’s thinking that if they
are equal in any respect, they are equal absolutely.” If
the 90,000 were not equal in all respects (in civil rights
and duties), there would not be a democracy. It might
then be, for example, an oligarchy, or a monarchy, or a
tyranny, or “aristocracy or government of the best.”
But only “democracy and demos in their truest forms
are based upon the recognized principle of democratic
justice that all [i.e., “all persons”-in Athens less than
one—ﬁfth of the population] should count equally; for
equality implies that the rich should have no more
share in the government than the poor, and should not
be the only rulers, but that all should rule equally ac-
cording to their numbers. And in this way men think
that they will secure equality and freedom in their
state.” (Aristotle, “Politics.”)

Freedom and equality-——resting on an enslaved ma-

Two thousand four hundred years have passed since
the noble men of Athens struggled with the problems
which still confront us today. In the bigger things as
in the smaller things we ﬁnd certain aspects of the prob-
lem the same. Aristotle could sagely observe: “Poverty

15

   

is the parent of revolution and crime.” Though we
may dislike the association here of crime with revolu-
tion, the statement is nevertheless true. Twenty-four
hundred years after Aristotle, the great dramatist.
Henrik Ibsen, could likewise say:

“He who would grow a bed of crime,
Let him with poverty manure it.”

And Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s efforts to curb the
predatory instinct in our modern plutocrats, to make
them give up a bit more of their superﬂuities so that the
petty businessmen might have a bit more, and so that
the workers’ miseries might be abated somewhat, thus
enabling them to drag out a miserable existence a few
years longer, link across the centuries with similar ef-
forts and remonstrances of the Athenians, struggling
with similar unsolvable problems—-—unsolvable, that is,
within the framework of private property socially used
and needed. Summing up the problem in the light of
past experience, Aristotle observes that “the regulation
of property is the chief point of all, that being the ques-
tion upon which all revolutions turn. This danger [he
adds] was recognized by Phaleas of Chalcedon, who
was the first to affirm that the citizens of a State ought
to have equal possessions.. . . . Plato in the ‘Laws’ was
of opinion that, to a certain extent, accumulation should
be allowed, forbidding, as I have already observed, any
citizen to possess more than five times the minimum
qualiﬁcation.” (Aristotle, “Politics.”)

Here speak the New Dealers of the mighty state
of antiquity! These ancient New Dealers have long
since gone the way of all ﬂesh, as will presently those
of our generation, futility and defeat attending their ef-
forts. The problem which defied the attempts to solve

I6

 

  

it twenty-four hundred years ago will defy attempts of
the New Dealers and plutocrats alike of our age to
solve it. For it cannot be solved their way. It can
only be solved the Marxian way, and it shall be solved
the Marxian way.

Aristotle to Madison.

The American bourgeois democracy at its inception,
as stated, resembled the ancient democracies in several
respects. The problem of how to account the slave-—
that is, whether as property or human being—-—had to be
solved. In economics the slave was property — no
doubt about that. Just as in Athens, in aspects of eco-
nomics, there was no essential difference between a
chattel slave and a tame animal! But in politics the
question was a different one. For the South wanted to
include the slaves as persons in the total population in
order that their representation in Congress might be
larger. As we have seen, that problem did not worry
the Athenians, for they excluded slaves altogether as
persons, and would probably have looked upon any
citizen as a lunatic if he had objected! To make a
long story short, an agreement was ﬁnally reached
among the “founding fathers” that it would require
five Negroes to equal three white persons. An amus-
ing solution if one can forget about the deep, star
tragedy underlying this arrangement. V

Apart from the slavery question, another question
confronted the democracy-builders, both in Athens and
in the United States. As in Athens, so in the United
States, the problem of giving the voteto propertiless,
though, of course, free citizens, and the possible eﬁects
of so doing on the property rights of the wealthy mi-
nority, troubled Aristotle as much as it troubled James

Many crimes are committed in the name
of democracy. It is essential that the
working»— class become familiar with its
definitions, and with the political and eco-
nomic oppressions practiced in its name.
More, it is essential that the working
class understand the need for industrial

brings “the rule of the people” to its high-
est form of expression.

of man's attempt to get rid of “the man

Madison. In two passages, remarkably alike, though
penned at periods almost 2,300 years apart, these two

profound political thinkers pose this problem. Said
Aristotle:

“How is this [political] equality to be obtained? Is
the qualiﬁcation to be so distributed that ﬁve hundred
rich shall be equal to a thousand poor? And shall we
give the thousand a power equal to that of the ﬁve hun-
dredi’. . . . Democrats say that justice is that to which
the majority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier
class; in their opinion the decision should be given ac-
cording to the amount of property. In both principles
there is some inequality and injustice. For if justice is
the will of the few, any one person wh-o has more
wealth than all the rest of his class put together ought,
upon the oligarchical principle, to have the sole power
——but this would be tyranny; or if justice is the will of
the majority, as I was before saying, they will unjustly
conﬁscate the property of the Wealthy minority.” (Aris-
totle, “Politics.”)

James Madison, eighteenth century political phil-
osopher and nineteenth century statesman, said:

“Under every View of the subject, it seems.indis-
pensable that the mass of citizens should not be without
a voice in making the laws which they are to. obey, and
in choosing the magistrates who are to administer them,
and if the only alternative be between an equal and um-
versal right of suffrage for each branch of the govern-
ment and a conﬁnement of the entire right to a part of
the citizens, it is better that those having the greater
interest at stake, namely, that of property and persons
both, should be deprived of half their share in. the gov-
ernment than that those having the lesser interests, that

1.8

 

of personal rights only, should be deprived of the
whole.” (“Letters and Other Writings of James Madi-
son,” Vol. IV.)

Neither Aristotle nor Madison could solve the
problem satisfactorily, and the reason was the same in
both cases: The mass of wealth was in the hands of
the minority and the majority of the people had little
or no property, though, to be sure, the opportunities for
acquiring wealth were inﬁnitely greater than they were
in the days of Aristotle, and inﬁnitely greater by far
than they are today. If the problem had increased,
say, tenfold, from the days of Aristotle to Madison’s
day, it has increased a thousandfold in the -one hundred
ﬁfty years that have passed since Madison’s day to ours.
With wealth concentrating into ever fewer hands, the
point having been reached where now 59 per cent of
the wealth is owned by one per cent of the population
while 87 per cent of the population now own only eight
per cent of the wealth, the solution of the problem can
no longer be deferred.‘ The reason for the inability
of Aristotle and Madison to solve it and the reason
why it can and must be solved now have been related
elsewhere.’ The solution of the problem lies in the
principles and program of the Socialist Labor Party.
If that program is not put into effect, society will lapse
into barbarism, a barbarism already foreshadowed in
the rise and momentary triumph of the Fascist-Nazi
despotisms. Failure to translate the S.L.P. principles
into concrete reality can result only in the establishment
of the despotic collectivism of Industrial Feudalism
(Fascism). The only answer to the threat of despotic

collectivism is the democratic collectivism of Socialism
(The Industrial Union form of Government). The
former collectivism spells death to the freedom of the
individual. The latter collectivism insures new life to,
and enlargement of, individual rights and liberties. As
Georg Brandes has so succinctly put it: “Collectivism,
deprived of the fundamental principles of fraternity and
self-government, is by the very nature of things a lib-
erty-sapping doctrine.” Fraternity and self-government
are obviously ruled out in the Fascist regime of despot-
ism. -It is just as obviously included, and in the very
nature of things guaranteed, in the collectivist Com-
monwealth of Labor.

"Democracy” and “Republic.”

Certain persons, claiming to believe in what they
call individual liberty, have arisen recently who, with
much show of learning, have told us that this country
was not formed or intended as a democracy at all, but
as a republic, and we are to conclude that in their prac-
tical application the two were entirely different. The
patent absurdity of this claim is instantly realized by
anyone familiar with the subject and the meaning of
words. It is quite true (as James Madison pointed
out‘) that if principles be ignored, and if the meaning
of “republican form” be sought “in the application of
the term by political writers, to the constitutions of dif-
ferent States, no satisfactory (answer) would ever be
found.” And he goes on to cite Holland and Venice
as states where the people were subject to absolute or
despotic rule though denominated republics; and Po-

land, in which country, he added, prevails “a mixture

1 The Federalist, No. 38.

of aristocracy and monarchy in their worst forms,” and
England Where, he continued, there is “one republican
branch only, combined with an hereditary aristocracy
and monarchy”—yet, all these have at one time or an-
other “been digniﬁed with‘ the same appellation"-—i.e.,
republic. Brushing these aberrations aside, then, Madi-
son offers this deﬁnition of a republic:

“We may deﬁne a republic to be, or at least bestow
that name on, a government which. derives all its pow-
ers directly or indirectly from the great body of the
people, and is administered by persons holding their
offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during
good behavior.”‘

The deﬁnition of republic by the Standard Diction-
ary, though much shorter, follows substantially the
Madison deﬁnition and, as we see, that deﬁnition does
not depart in essence from the deﬁnition of democracy.
For all practical purposes, then, the two terms may be
said to mean the same thing. Alexander Hamilton, co-
author with Jay and Madison of The Federalist papers,
emphasized this fact when he made the following com-
ment:

“The genius of republican liberty seems to demand
on one side, not only that all power should be derived
from the people, but that those intrusted with it should
be kept in dependence on the people. . . .”’

And returning to Madison, we ﬁnd him saying,
anent democracy and republic:

“The ﬁrst question that oﬁers itself is whether the

1 The Federalist, No. 38.

21

  

general form and aspect of the government be strictly
republican. It is evident that no other form would be
reconcilable with the genius of the people of America;
with the fundamental principles of the Revolution.”
(Emphasis mine)‘

And where do we find these “fundamental principles
of the Revolution” enunciated? Where but in the De-
claration of Independence? And has there ever been
a document of similar character and official recognition
where the principle‘s of democracy---political dem-oc-
racy, to be sure—have been more clearly or more force-
fully stated? J

A conclusive answer to those who seek to make a
distinction between the terms “Republic” and “Democ-
racy” as used in America may be found in the fact that
Thomas Jefferson, the outstanding champion of democ-
racy, was originally called a republican, and the party
espousing the principles of Jellersonian democracy was
called the Republican party, as distinguished from the
opposition party, the F ederalists!

he reactionary assailants of democracy insist that
the revolutionary fathers had no intention of establish-
ing a democracy, and that (through Jefferson and
others) there subsequently developed opposition against
what was supposed to be what they did intend to estab-
lish——i.e., a republic——the result of this opposition sup-
posedly being a corruption of their intentions, namely,
democracy! Hence, Jeffersonian democracy, supposed-
ly the arch foe of libertyll _One of these reactionary
writers, one John Corbin, whose book on this subject,
“Two Frontiers of Freedom,” has been discussed and

reviewed at considerable length recently, vigorously

1The Federalist, No. 38.

22

 

   

denounces democracy and sneers at the "rule of the peo-
ple; and though he professes to reject the autocracy of
the European bandit dictatorships, he does, in fact,
embrace their principles, as indeed he who denounces
democracy must necessarily do. Referring to the revo-
olutionary fathers, he says: “The government they
founded was as diﬁerent from democracy as day is
from night—-namely, a Republic.” And he adds:

“The dictators are right that the trouble with the
world is democracy. It is equally true (though they
do not say this) that democracy has_ always been the
arch enemy of freedom.”

The United States Constitution is by this reaction-
ary enemy of democratic principles conceived to be the
antithesis of democracy, or, rather, he conceives the
Constitution as the corrective of democracy, not as the
instrument to protect and safeguard it. The Constitu-
tion, being a compromise (and a necessary one under
the circumstances), the charge is not wholly Without
some justification, though not in the sense implied by
this arrogant enemy of democracy, and in the main the
charge is false. The charge, in any event, is not true
in any ﬁnally determining sense, least of all as applied
to the condition of that time, nor is it true with respect
to the intentions of the revolutionary fathers. We have
just seen how emphatic both Hamilton and Madison
were in insisting that a democracy, inkeeping with the
fundamental principles of the Revolution, was their
aim. It is amusing then, to say the least, to find" that
this reactionary defarner"of the American Revolution
names Madison andiil-Iamilton asjopponerits of democ-
racy, while Thomas Jefferson" (among. others) is in-
cluded among those who supposedly corruptetl the noble

work of Washington, Madison and Hamilton by intro-
ducing democracy in the American system of govern-
ment.

Another writer, an economic illiterate and vulgar
reacti-onary, who does a weekly turn “with a book-
worm” in the New York Herald Tribune, seconds Mr.
Corbin’s attempts at misrepresenting and defaming the
revolutionary fathers. The following, taken from her
recent comments on the theme of Corbin’s book, suf-
ficiently demonstrates the vulgarity of the lady’s concep-
tion of democracy: “Democracy [she says] is simply
majorityrule, the totalitarian state.” It will be news
to Hitler, Mussolini and the rest of the totalitarian
fraternity that majority rule prevails in their gangster
realms—and that they are really passionate adherents
of democracyl A reactionary, even a defender of re-
actionary vulgarism, need not necessarily be an im-
becile. But here we certainly have a choice specimen
of vulgar reaction and imbecility in Wedded blissl

In another reference the same writer, with the now
familiar brazen misrepresentations of the revolutionary
fathers, repeats in substance the same imbecility:

“The constitution [she writes] was devised as A
safeguard against the deadly principle of democracy

V (majority right)-—and to preserve the vital principle

of liberty (individual right).”

One has to go back to the utterances of the most
violently reactionary among eighteenth century tories
to find anything to match this gem dropped by our bla-
tant Lady Chatterbox. It was Edmund Burke (curi-
ously enough defender of the American revolutionists,
but viliﬁer of the French Revolution, and the French
revolutionary leaders)—-Edmund Burke, British ora-

24

 

tor, who, in referring to the struggle to overthrow the
monarchy in France, and to establish a political democ-
racy, exclaimed:

“A perfect democracy is therefore the most shame-
less thing in the world.”

How comforting it must beito our present-day re-
actionary assailants of democracy to know that their
hearts beat in perfect unison with that of the man who
descended to the lowest levels in attacking and defam-
ing that inspiring exempliﬁcation of human struggle
for liberty, that magniﬁcent blow at black reaction and
ruling class parasitism, the great French Revolution!

When the People Are Not People.

Democracy, I repeat, is then not something that one
can approve or condemn unqualiﬁedly. First, we must
understand what we mean by “democracy”; secondly,
we must understand what is meant by people, and when
people are not people! And, thirdly, we must relate de-
mocracy to the economic basis of a given society, since
obviously democracy, meaning rule of the people, must
reﬂect the people’s material needs, and the possibilities
and means of satisfying these needs.

How stand matters today with respect to what gen-
erally is understood by the term democracy? We need
not ponder the question at length, for it is obvious that
democracy as understood by the revolutionary fathers
has little or no meaning as applied to the practical needs
of the majority of the people. Conceived, among other
basic things, as a means to protect property, and the
fruits of labor, at the time of the American Revolution
———that is, at a time when the acquiring of property
(however unequally distributed at any given period)

25

  
  

was still possible on the part of the average citizen, it is
obvious that that same democracy cannot mean now
what it meant then, since the mass -of the people are not
only n-ow without property, but also (in the phrase of
Madison) “without the means or hope of acquiring it."
That which 150 years ago furnishedthe basis of, and
gave meaning and rationality to, the American Idea of
democracy having disappeared, no honest, thinking per-
son would insist that that form of democracy can any
longer serve and satisfy the needs of the majority of
the people today. Just as in early communal society
democracy formed an inseparable part of the economic
way of life of the denizens of that democracy; just as
in 1776 (and the years that followed until the great in-
dustrial revolution made its effects felt everywhere),
the early American, or bourgeois, democracy was insep-
arably a part of the economicway of life of our fathers,
so today democracy, to have any meaning other than to
serve as a mask for economic despotism, must constitute
an inseparable partof the way of life of the vast ma-
jority of the people today.

But what is the “way of life” of the people -of today
——meaning primarily the Vast majority, or the wage
workers? We know that it is not the way of life of
the people 150 years ago. We know that the way of
life of the Ford workers, for instance, is not the way of
life of Henry Ford and his kin and retainers. Mr.
Ford owns vast wealth; his workers own nothing out-
side themselves. Mr. Ford buys labor power, and he
naturally wants to buy it cheap; his workers sell labor
power, and they just as naturally want to sell it at the
highest price possible. His workers sell their labor
power (which in effect means selling themselves) in the
labor market; Mr. Ford, not being a vendor of labor

26

 

power, sells in the automobile market——that is, he sells
the products of his workers in the appropriate commodi-
ty market, just as the workers do in theirs. Just as no
one would ask a Ford wage slave: “How well did you
do in the automobile market today?” so no one would
ask Mr. Ford: “Did you sell successfully in the labor

market today?” (And, incidentally, there was, of‘

course, neither an automobile market nor a labor market
in the days of the fathers——reference to either would
have been just so much gibberish to Washington, Jeffer-
son and Madison!)

And as it is with Mr. Ford and his wage slaves, so
it is with every other capitalist and his wage‘ slaves--—
the way of life of the one is the exact opposite of the
other. Since democracy necessarily must be related to
the economic, that is, the basic way of life, how can our
present form of democracy mean the same thing to
classes with diametrically opposed economic interests?
The fact is, of course, that except as a means of eHect-
ing peaceably fundamental social, political and histori-
cally unavoidable changes, present-day political democ-
racy can have no meaning to the vast majority, the
working class. So divorced from actual participation in
governmental affairs has the majority of the people be-
come, that it is taken for granted that it is not within
the province of the workers, for instance, to understand
the business of government today, and the "majority has,
in fact, surrendered political power in all important mat-
ters to politicians and so-called statesmen. And the
workers themselves, frequently——-too frequently——impa-
tient with what they call politics (capitalist politics),
make statements implying that it is not their business to
meddle in statecraft, and they are quite content to let
the lawyers and the professional politicians do their

thinking and acting for them. This is a natural conse-
quence ﬂowing from the fact that to the working class
political democracy, by and large, has lost the sense of
reality, since it has no direct or immediate relation to
the thing which concerns them above all, namely, their
jobs, their industrial relations and problems.‘ William
C. Bullitt, American Ambassador to France (or what
is left of it), in his recent pro-conscription and pro-war
speech, unwittingly offered conﬁrmatory evidence on
this head, with particular reference, of course, to that
attitude of contempt which the ruling class has assumed
in respect to the workers’ ability to exercise democratic
functions in governmental affairs. Said Mr. Bullitt in
his speech delivered in Philadelphia on August 18,
1940:

“Control of government by public opinion is the es-
sence of democracy. And it has always been our belief
that free speech and a free press and a free education
would enable us to form and express our opinions suf-
ficiently swiftly not only t-o permit but to compel our
government to act quickly and effectively. But the prob-
lems of world affairs have become so complex, in -this
day of -volcanic change, that the average citizen has the
greatest diﬁiculty in understanding them and judging
what is best for his country before it is too late.”

Precisely so, except that Mr. Bullitt might have been
a bit more candid and acknowledged that it is not mere-
ly diiiicult, ‘but virtually impossible, for the average citi-
zen to understand what these doings are all about, be-

‘ “Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that rarely strikes
his senses will generally have but little inﬂuence upon his mind. A gov-
ernment continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be expected
to interest the sensations of the people.”--J1‘&1e Federalist, No. 37.

28

 

cause they have no relevancy to the things that are vital
to at least 90 per cent of our people today, their jobs,
their economic problems, their means of making a liv-

mg.

It might be added, incidentally, that Mr. Bullitt also
proved how worthless to the ruling class is the democ-
racy to which they sing such paeans when to do so serves
their economic purposes, or their class interests. With-
out mentioning names, he referred to that section of the
French ruling class which prepared the Way for the
fascist invader, and which cared no more for the politi-
cal democracy of France than Hitler did. The collapse
of capitalist-bourgeois France constitutes an important
lesson in the history and Working out of what our own
capitalists and their spokesmen call “our Way of life.”

This attitude of contempt toward the “average citi-
zen” (Which is to say, in the main, the working class)
with regard to his understanding of, and interest in, af-
fairs ofpgovernment, suggests a startling parallel to the
attitude of the ancient Athenians toward slaves and
freedmen. As We have already noted, in the latter in-
stance neither slaves, nor freedmen were, for the pur-
pose of governing, considered persons. In the former
instance, when ruling class spokesmen refer to “public
opinion,” “the public,” and to “the people,” they really
do not mean what they say. By “public opinion” they
mean ruling class opinion, by “the public” they mean the
ruling class, and by “the people” they mean “the best
people”! And so forth. As Marx, in his profound
observation, puts it: “The ruling ideas of each age
have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.” Or, to
turn it around, and paraphrase it slightly, “The ruling
class of each age ever imposed its class notions and

29

   

 

views upon the mass of the people as the ruling ideas
and views of that age.”

Ruling Class Contempt for Free Speech.

As to the still surviving usefulness of political de-
mocracy (and it is indeed a usefulness of vital signiﬁ-
cance), all efforts of the present-day ruling class are
directed at restricting, abolishing, or otherwise render-
ing nugatory, the exercising of that vital remnant of de-
mocracy, and they attempt to do this in the very name
of that democracy which, without that exercise, would
become as meaningless and useless as it in practical
aﬁairs had already become! It is by no means an un-
usual thing for politicians or other servants of the plu-
tocracy and the industrial feudalists to speak in terms
of contempt of free speech, for instance, at the very
same time that they boast of their liberalism and their
adherence to democracy.- During the first World War
there was organized in this country a body calling itself
the “American Defense Society.” In a book written in
1917 by one of the leaders of that organization, one
Dr. William T. Hornaday, we ﬁnd this significant
statement:

“The people of the United States are bowing down
in besotted "worship to the ridiculous fetish idol called
Free Speech.”

“One night a few Butte men of sand decided that
at least one of the I.W.W. leaders should literally
reach the end of his rope. .Taking the rope with them,
six of them called at leader Little’s hotel, took him from
his bed, and in a most quiet and orderly way imaginable
hanged him to a railroad bridge in the suburbs of Butte
until he was dead.”

30

   

Just like that! Substitute the hangman’s noose for
free spec" 3 And lest you tell me that that was in
1917, let me cite the recent utterance of one of our
voluble New York “statesmen,” George U. (“Rubber-
hose”) Harvey, who on August I 3 delivered himself
of a tirade against free speech, saying:

“Free speech and all that damned nonsense just
provides an excuse for letting those who Want to over-
throw the government have their way.” (Herald Trib-
une, August 14, 1940.)

Free speech, according to the Harvey conception, is
only for those who agree with gentlemen of his stripe
and their political caveman’s idea of democracy! Po-
litical and economic illiterates will never understand
that free speech, the essence of democracy, has no mean-
ing except as the means to settle diﬁerences of opinion,
and, in great social crises, to arrive at decisions that
meet the needs of society, on the terms of majority
opinion. “Man is not free, when he is not thinking,”
said Friedrich Hegel, the famous German philoso-
pher. Obviously, then, man is still less free when
he cannot freely express his thoughts. The sort of
freedom which vulgar politicians cherish is the kind de-
scribed also by Hegel, i.e., “the power to sell one’s vote,
and to purchase a seat in parliament.” And these
deadly enemies of liberty and democracy call them-
selves liberals! How well Ibsen summed up the matter
when (in referring to those political cave dwellers who
suppressed utterance) he said: “The liberals are the
worst enemies of liberty.”‘

Distorted Democracy.

But perhaps, after all, they do sincerely believe that
theirs is the true democracy-—-the democracy of the bar-
racks I—-—and that it really serves “the people,” the “best
people,” of course! Perhaps unwittingly, even in their
ignorant and vulgar way, they are revealing their kin-
ship to those earlier ruling classes who simply took for
granted the slave status of their workers, considering
them as little different from “tame animals”! And why
not? If they can conceive the drudgery of the Ford
shop, with its unlimited autocracy, as constituting “the
way of our democratic life”; if men slaving in the steel
mill infernos are conceived to be enjoying real democ-
racy; if the horrors of the tenant farmer, the unspeak-
able existence of the share-croppers, the endless grind
of Wage slaves generally———if all this is democracy, then
I Why should not the Prussian ideal, the slave state, be
considered democracy? If the robot-like acts of the
«, Ford wage slaves are acts of persons enjoying democ-
‘N racy, why is not the goose-stepping of Nazi-Prussian
§ militarism the self-determined gait of a free and happy
 , people? And why is not, then, the denial of free speech
” to those who really need it the most the very essence of
democracy? Indeed, why not? i

Ill.
The Economic Basis of Industrial Democracy.

The old form of democracy reflected a way of life
which, in its essence, has gone forever. The private
property, to which it related in its origin, exists no more.
That property, though private still in point of owner-
ship, has become social in form and operation, and un-
der capitalism the vast majority stand bereft of it. The
blacksmith shop of I 50 years ago furnished the means
of a living to him who owned and operated it-like
Longfellow’s village blacksmith, who, “mighty man,”
free and independent——

“His brow Wet with honest sweat,

(he) earns whate’er he can,

And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.”

Where is he today? What has become of his “vil-
lage smithy”? That “village smithy” has become the
United States Steel Corporation, the Weir and the
Girdler steel mills, and the sturdy blacksmith has be-
come the exploited steel wage slave in these industrial
infernos, in which he has not a particle of vested inter-
est nor the slightest part of governance. He who owns
these modern “smithies,” but who never wields “a
heavy sledge,” nor ever sees “the ﬂaming forge,” nor
hears “the bellows roar” (except possibly as an occa-
sional visitor)——the owner of this mighty blacksmith
shop sits, not “under a spreading chestnut tree,” but
more likely under a spreading palm tree, in whose
shade he guzzles cool drinks, while his slaves-—the

33

   

descendants of the sturdy blacksmith of I 50 years ago
-—-—ceaselessly toil in the driving sweat of their weary
bodies. _

And as with the “village smithy,” so with all other
crafts and shops once individual in ownership and op-
eration. The one-time wheelwright and the Wagoner

‘now slave in the Ford plants; the shoemaker at the

bench once making a complete shoe or boot now is a cog
in a boot and shoe factory, toiling at starvation wages
for the proﬁt of another; and the one-time self-sustain-
ing tailor is a mere number in a huge clothing factory,
while the proud and independent farmer is a poor and
vretched tenant-farmer or share-cropper——none of them
any longer free and sturdy craftsmen, able to look “the
whole world in the face,” but angry or trembling wage
slaves, fearful of losing the jobs they do not own—the
jobs that are owned by their capitalist masters who,
with a word or a pen-stroke, can plunge thousands into
misery and want by throwing them on the streets, thus
manifesting possession of a power which an Oriental
despot might well have envied them!

Indeed, just as the once free American has become
a wage slave in the factory hells and mill infernos
owned by the capitalists, so have these latter become
industrial autocrats, in a sense and to a degree that
laugh to scorn our claims to democracy in America to-
day! In short, the political democracy, theoretically
surviving and nominally exercised.by the propertiless
workers, is practically cancelled by the industrial au-
tocracy de facto in existence today. “You take my life
when you do take the means whereby I live,” groaned
Shylock, and so it is. He who owns the means of life,
the things to which we must have access in order to
live, owns our lives, owns them in a sense and to an

34

 

effect as real as if actual chains bound us to the master
and his machine. Again, where, in the presence of such
actual industrial despotism, does our vaunted democ-
racy fit in—how does it retain sense and substance in
such a situation? The answer again must bethat that
democracy, in the vital, practical needs of the everyday
way of our lives, possesses neither sense nor substance,
nor relevancy, to the vast majority of the people, the‘
wage workers. That is to say, it has lost sense and
substance to what is, in fact, the people, and only the
parasitical few, the capitalist owners, and their slave-
drivers and medicine men, enjoy the beneﬁts of this
so-called democracy.

H ow Revitalize Democracy?

What, then, I repeat, must we do to revitalize the
democratic principle? How must we translate it into
modern terms that give it meaning? How must we
apply it so that again it acquires sense and substance?
And in What manner may we transform the present way
of life of the working class——which is the way of eco-
nomic slavery——into a way of life that will be in keep-
ing with our standards of civilization, a way of life that
will spell true freedom and true, all-around democracy?
That it cannot be done piecemeal, nor under the old
forms, and within the framework of a society based on
private property, we know. For wherever it has been
attempted to graft this new vital democracy on the old
dying tree of class democracy, the result has been reac-
tion, retrogression, or frustration and disillusionment,
ever the forerunners of the man on horseback. It was
tried in France in 1871 and the immediate result was
black reaction, and a setback to "the cause of French la-
bor from which it never fully recovered. It was tried

in Germany after the World War—though indeed it
was in a limited way-—-and Hitlerism was the answer.
It was tried in Russia, and Stalinism was the fruit,
though, to be sure, the drama———or perhaps tragedy-—-of
Soviet Russia has not yet been played to the end of the
last act.

' Leisure, ./lﬁfluence and Cultural Progress.

Political society arose on the ruins of communal so-
ciety, which perished because equality on the basis of
universal poverty inevitably results in stagnation, with
eventual reversal to the most primitive way of life.
Leisure and affluence are prime requisites for the insur-
ing of social and cultural progress, and if leisure and
affluence are not available to all, then they must be as-
sured to the few at the expense of the many. This is
the course history took after the dissolution of the
ancient commune, a course it had to take if progress
were to be served. But that course inescapably spelled
slavery, classes, and the rise of the organ to keep the
oppressed class down, the Political State. From that
time to our present day, government has constituted a
force apart from the economic organism as such — a
force superimposed from above, as it were, incapable of
integration with the productive functions, and, of
course, never intended to be so integrated. The very
nature and function of political government precluded
anything of the kind. Consequently, political govern-
ment has always constituted an extra burden, or charge,
on the economic or productive organism, a necessary
burden, of course, since without political government,
in a society resting on an economy of scarcity, retrogres-
sion, anarchy and eventual disintegration would inesca-
pably follow. But political government today is no

36

 

longer needed, for the reason that we now have an econ-
omy of amplitude. It is no longer necessary to set
aside a small class, in leisure and guaranteed economic
security, in order to insure preservation and promotion
of the arts and general culture. All can now enjoy
leisure and plenty, hence all may be carriers of culture,
with no dangers of a relapse into barbarism, and with
the danger of social disintegration eliminated. But
although political government need no longer be main-
tained—-indeed, political government has become solely
an incubus on society, and an obstruction to social
progress—-a governing, or central directing and coordi-
nating, body is required lest society (leisure and aPilu-
ence notwithstanding) nevertheless sulier disintegration.
Since the primary task is, and ever must remain, that of
producing and insuring a constant supply of the things
needed to insure life, well-being and happiness for the
dwellers in human society, and since a superimposed
organ of force is no longer needed, it follows that the
government required is simply one that directs the
processes of production and distribution of articles for
use, and which insures maintenance and replacement of
the productive mechanism. The answer is the indus-
trial administration of things, as Frederick Engels called
it, or the Industrial Union Government, as Daniel De
Leon called it, and as the Socialist Labor Party today
designates it, varying it with the appellations Industrial
Republic of Labor, The Industrial Commonwealth of
Labor, Industrial Democracy, or simply Socialism.

Industrial Democracy——Complete Democracy.

Like its forerunner, political democracy, Industrial
Democracy will be organized on a representative basis.
Having dispensed with the old, worn-out Political State,

The human race is gradually leam-
ing the simple lesson, that the people as a
whole are wiser’ for the public good and‘
the public prosperity, than any privileged
class of men, however reﬁned and culti-
vated, have ever ‘been, or, by any possibil-
ity, can ever become. Governments over
societies the most advanced are still in a
transitional stage; and they are necessarily
and logically moving . . . . in the direction
of democracy; that form of self-govem-
ment which represents and expresses the
average intelligence and virtue of ' a free
and educated people.

which derived its representation from geographic units
(town, county, state), geographic or territorial demar-
cations and boundary lines are now discarded. Indus-
trial Democracy, then, derives its representation from
industrial units, and from industry generally. It will be
organized from the bottom up, that is, in an ascending
scale of organization—single plant or group of plants,
Local Industrial Union of a given industry, National In-
dustrial Union of the given industry, and finally the
All-Industrial Congress, representing all industries.
This All-Industrial Union Congress will be the govern-
ing board, or the Industrial Government of the Social-
ist Republic. Its task would, in the words of De Leon,
be “the easy one which can be summed up in the statis-
tics of the wealth needed, the wealth producible, and
the work required.” In short, how much of this or that
article do We need, how much can be produced of that
article with present equipment, and how many hours
of labor will the Workers have to render on the basis of
need and capacity? The answers lie close at hand.
The workers, in the ascending scale of industrial
organization, will elect their own foremen and man-
agers, their representatives to the local and national
unions, and ﬁnally to the All-Industrial Union Con-
gress, with the power of recall never surrendered, and
complete democracy—Industrial Democracy—prevail-
ing. This democracy——though necessarily representa-
tive-—-will be a complete democracy such as the world
has never before enjoyed—one is tempted to say a
“pure” or “perfect” democracy, though it may be
best not to yield to the temptation by reason of the man-
ner in which defenders of the acquisitive society have
misrepresented these terms. Certainly it will be an in-
finitely purer and vastly more “perfect” democracy than

38

 

any the human race has ever known. And with its in-
stitution the golden age of mankind will begin. “With
the institution of political society under Cleisthenes,”
wrote Morgan, “the gentile organization was laid aside
as a portion of the rags of barbarism.” In the same
spirit, and rendering full tribute to capitalism and pre-
ceding acquisitive social systems for the services ren-

dered the cause of civilization, however terrible the

cost, civilized man of the (we hope) near future can
say: “With the institution of Industrial Union society,
as conceived by De Leon, the political society is laid
aside as a portion of the rags of primitive civilization.”
True democracy, not qualified democracy, nor a democ-
racy cancelled by the limitations inevitably imposed by
a class society resting on an economy of scarcity, will be
at last enthroned and made secure by that strongest of
bonds, the bond of the enlightened material interests of
man, united in a common brotherhood made possible by
the rendering unnecessary of individual acquisitiveness,
and the rendering superﬂuous of petty motives of per-
sonal selﬁshness.

W orld-W ide Collapse of Bourgeois Democracy.

The present world-wide, titanic conflict is nothing
else than the collapse of what we have called bourgeois
democracy. The World War, fought in desperate
fury, utter savagery, and in ruthless disregard of human
and material values, constitutes the proof of the collapse
of the bourgeois democratic era, becoming at the same
time the instrument of its complete destruction. The
war is the continuation and the culmination of the com-
petitive commercial and economic warfare which pre-
ceded it. And unless the workers organize to preserve
and extend democracy, clothing it in its new industrial,

39

administrative garb, the temporarily rejuvenated bar-
barism of Fascism and Hitlerism will eventually crush
this now essentially useless form of democracy, thereby
possibly thrusting society back into a new dark age, the
duration of which may be for a long time. For there
is no longer any middle course possible. V Under the ter-
riﬁc impact of the savage war, established institutions,
ancient landmarks, old traditions and loyalties, old
faiths and illusions are swept oil the board as if they
had never been! Mankind presently stands bewildered,
and must soon choose between the two roads: Back to

‘ barbarism via fascism, or onward to the higher civiliza-

tion and brotherhood of man via Socialism. There is
no halfway settlement possible, and man cannot stand
still. It is either onward, or backward. We believe,
and hope, it will be onward.

IV.
Conscription, -Phenomenon of Degenerated

Bourgeois “Democracy.”

Our own ruling class, trembling with fear at the
prospects of having its “civilization” (capitalism) de-
stroyed by the Hitler scourge, is feverishly struggling
for a solution, struggling to escape What seems like im-
pending doom as an independent ruling class. The
spokesmen of the plutocracy are screaming themselves
hoarse in an effort to corral the Workers into military
and industrial regimentation. Many of the arguments
advanced by the plutocracy reveal the sham nature of
the democracy which they acclaim, and the form, or
shell, of which they would eagerly discard if threatened
with the true and inﬁnitely higher democracy of the So-
cialist Commonwealth. So desperate have they become
that they boldly presented the demand for military
and industrial conscription in peace time, an unprece-
dented assault upon the country’s traditions of liberty
that might have precipitated a bloody uprising if ad-
vanced even a year ago. With an audacity born of their
panic, and nurtured by their contempt for the intelli-
gence of the proletariat, they do not hesitate to corrupt
and distort history, and to misrepresent unscrupulously
the founders of the republic in order to present con-
vincing and supposedly authoritative testimony in behalf
of the conscription bill which, incidentally, they were
compelled to modify because of the storm -of protests its
utter fascist and undemocratic character evoked. The
ultra-plutocratic New York Herald Tribune, ‘for in-

41

 

 

   

stance, in a recent issue, with a shamelessness unsur-
passed even in these days of unprincipled lying and falsi-
ﬁcation, quoted Thomas Jelferson, purportedly in favor
of conscription. Yet, not in even the remotest sense
could anything which the paper cited from Jefferson’s
writings be construed as favoring conscription. Jefferson
merely repeated what had been said so often before and
since, that every citizen should have the right to bear
arms, and that all the citizens ought to be trained to use
these arms. Indeed, the Herald Tribune even quotes
Jefferson as saying that only such an armed nation could
dispense with a standing army, thereby knocking the
argument in favor of a conscript, standing army into a
cocked hatl In a letter written in 1814 (in which, in-
cidentally, Jefferson makes references to England strik-
ingly similar to the references England and the United
States now make to the Nazi gangster government) Jef-
ferson discussed the question of national defense, and
rejecting the suggestion -of a standing army, said: “The
Greeks, by their laws, and the Romans by the spirit of
their people, took care to put into the hands of their
rulers no such engine of oppression as a standing
army?” i

Our conscription defenders are usually fond of
quoting from Washington's Farewell Address in sup-
port of this or that reactionary plan, but, strangely
enough, none of them has as yet discovered this passage
so illuminating to the subject in hand: “Hence like-
wise,” said VVashington, “they [the United States] will
avoid the necessity of those overgrown Military estab-

 

1 “In Virginia a draft [conscription] was ever the most unpopular
and impracticable thing that could be attempted. Our people, even under
the monarchical government, had learned to consider it as the last of all
oppressions.”--Thos. Jefferson, in a letter to John Adams.

42

 

  
 

lishments which, under any form of Government, are
inauspicious to liberty, and which [are to be regarded]
as particularly hostile to Republican Liberty.” And even
the far from liberalvl-Iamilton spoke of “standing ar-
mies [that] are dangerous to liberty. . . .”

Madison on M ilitarism.

But no one spoke more forcefully against war and
standing armies and the conscription implied than our
fourth President, James Madison. In a strong state-
ment denouncing war and military establishments, he
said:

“. . . .armie5, deb-ts and taxes are the known instru-

ments for bringing the many under the domination of
the few.. . . . no nation could preserve its freedom in
the midst of continual warfare.“

And at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 he
warned against “a standing military force,” which, he
said, “with an overgrown executive will not long be safe
companions to liberty. The means of defense [he con-
tinued] against foreign danger have been always the
instruments of tyranny at home.”

Ponder this well: “The means of defense . . . .have
been always the instruments of tyranny at home”!
Powerful words, prophetic words, thesel But Madison
continues: “Among the Romans it was a standing maxim
to excite a war whenever a revolt wasiapprehended.
Throughout all Europe [he added] the armies kept up
under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the
people. It is perhaps questionable [he concluded]
whether the best concerted system of absolute power in

alarms of external danger could tame the people to the
domestic yoke.” L

Woodrow Wilson on Conscription.

Even the President w-ho led this country into the
first World War (before he succumbed to the enormous
pressure exerted on him)———even Woodrow Wilson,
supposed idol of Franklin D. Roosevelt, denounced con-
scription in eloquent terms. In his second annual mes-
sage delivered before Congress in Joint Session, De-
cember 8, 1914, President VVilson discussed the subject
of national defense, with particular reference to con-
scription. In taking up the subject, he said:

“It cannot be discussed without first answering some
very searching questions. It is said in some quarters
that we are not prepared for war. What is meant by
being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon
brief notice to put a nation in the ﬁeld, a nation of
men trained to arms? Of course we are not ready to
do that; AND WE SHALL NEVER BE IN TIME
OF PEACE SO LONG _AS WE RETAIN OUR
PRESENT POLITICAL PRINCIPLES AND IN-
STITUTIONS. And what is it that it is suggested we
should be prepared for? To defend ourselves against
attack? We have always found means to do that, and
shall ﬁnd them whenever it is necessary without calling
our people away from their necessary tasks to render
compulsory military service in time of peace.”

And identif in his 0 osition to conscri tion in
Y 8 PP P
peace-time with the “finer passions” of the American

people, he went on:

“We never have had, and while we retain our pres-

44

 

  

ent principles and ideals we never shall have, a large
standing army. . . .we shall not turn America into a
military camp. We will not ask our young men to
spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of
themselves. . . . And especially when half the world is
on fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance
against the spread of the conﬂagration very deﬁnite and
certain and adequate indeed?”

Conscription in America in time of peace is now a
fact. How will the defenders of conscription escape
the logic of President Wilson’s condemnation of peace-
time conscription? According to Woodrow Wilson’s
dictum, America has now abandoned its historic “prin-
ciples and ideals,” and America is now turned “into a

military camp.” And this happened under the adminis- .

tration of one who has hailed Woodrow Wilson as his
guide and mentor!

Youth Not Resold on War.

Perhaps the two most brazen assertions of the con-
scription advocates and warmongers were (I) that the
masses were clamoring‘ for conscription, and (2) that
conscription is the very essence of democracy!- As to
the ﬁrst, this brazen falsehood was proved such by the
Hood of protests against the conscription bill that
‘poured into the Senate and the House. and which
forced the militarists into a retreat that threatened to
"become a rout. A writer in the pro-administration New
York Post recently (August 12, 1940) reported his
-ﬁndings with respect to the popularity of conscription,

and discovered what no honest and discerning person ~

1 “The Messages and Papers of Woodrow Wilson,” Vol. I, pp. 76-78.
45

 

   

had doubted, that conscription is rejected overwhelm-
ingly by the people. This writer quotes a young college
man as saying (speaking for himself and his class-
mates) :

“We are pretty thoroughly s-old in -college that war
was a hell of a business and never beneﬁted anybody
except people who made a profit out of it: I guess now
this is a new kind of war, only Dorothy Thompson and
the rest of you haven’t completely resold us.” And he
added (undoubtedly with the irreverent irony of
youth) : “The best thing you can say about this new
war is that if we win it, things will stay the same [H].
And a lot of us don’t think very highly of the way
things are.”

And probably with a thrust at the artificial and
shabby new “patriotic” song by the inventor of rag-
time, the young man added:

“But you can’t expect Irving Berlin to write a very
stirring marching song about how swell it is to go out
and die for the status quo !”

True talk, this! To die for the status quo is to die-
in defense of the chains we wear! To die for what our
plutocratic masters call “democracy” is to die for the
preservation of capitalism, for the protection and exten-
sion of trade and world markets. This is the sordid‘.
business we are asked to lay down our lives for!

Cartoonists, sometimes unwittingly, often express
the truth about such questions in a manner that centers.
attention on the essential points. The Herald Tribune‘
cartoonist, “Ding,” succeeded in doing this in a recent;
cartoon entitled “Fighting for our Freedom.” The-
cartoon shows on the top a scene from the American-

46

 

revolution, revolutionary soldiers ensconced behind bar-
ricades exchanging shots with the red-coats. It is
marked “I776.” The lower section, marked “I940,”
shows a ﬂock of ‘young men and women rushing pell-
mell toward a building with a sign reading “Marrying
Parson, an arrow marked Draft Exemption” pointing
to the building, and a larger sign bearing the legend
“National .Defense——Universal Service Draft.” Car-
toonist ‘Ding,” an ardent conscriptioneer, we. may be
sure, brought out two important facts otherwise over-
looked.or.suppressed by the press and other spokesmen
of capitalism—-the fact that in 1776 the average alive
American knew that he had a stake in the Revolution,
and was eager to ﬁght for the cause; and the other fact
that in 1940 the average American knows‘, or certainly
strongly feels, tbat.he has no stake in this war—that,
on the contrary, he 1S deﬁnitely opposed to war and con-
scription, and is even willing to take a life-sentence in
matrimonial servitude in order to escape both!

‘However, if these warmongers were so sure that the
majority favored conscription, why did they not submit
this vitally important question to the referendum of the
voters at the November election? Surely, if they
thought they were right,_ they could have lost nothing,
and they would have gained a great deal if their con-
tentions had been upheld by the majority of. the people.
But they did.not do this, ‘and the reason‘is that they
knew that their claim constituted a huge swindle.

As to the second, if conscription, military and/or in-
dustrial, is democracy, then the ant-hill is a democracy,
ang Hitler’s and Mussolini’s armies are degnpcracies,
an goose-stepping 1S indeed the relaxation 0 rec and
liberty-loving men! It has been the favorite pastime
of opponents of Socialism (beginning with Herbert

Spencer) to charge that Socialism would be the “coming
slavery,” and one of the reasons usually trotted out was
that Socialism would reduce all to one common, dead
level, this, of course, constituting the very antithesis of
democracy. Those visualizing such a prospect would
shrink back in horror. Yet, nothing can, in the lan-
guage of Artemus Ward, be deader nor the common
level of conscripted armies. So we see that the sup-
posed dead level at one time constitutes the very oppo-
site, indeed the mortal enemy, of democracy, while at:
another time that same dead level (of conscript armies)»
becomes the very soul, the very ﬂower, of democracy!

Conscription, a Brazen Coup.

This successful attempt to fasten on the American
people peace-time military conscription (which, if
America finds itself at war, probably will be followed"
by industrial conscription) was one of the boldest, one

of the most brazen, ever planned by the predatory’

ruling class of America. That it is unconstitutional
goes without saying, and, barring war, it seems certain-
that the United States Supreme Court would so declare-
it, unless the court should go oil at a Dred Scott tan-

gent! Horace Greeley, in his massive Civil War chron-

icle (“The American Conﬂict”) in 1863 bitterly de-

nounced the draft, saying: “. . . .the Draft itself—an_v’
Draft——was unconstitutional, needless, and an outrage-
on individual liberty and State rights.. . . .” And he
went on to quote The World (New York) as declaring:-

“The idea of a military conscription being itself”
profoundly repugnant to the American mind, it might"

have been supposed that unusual steps would have been

taken by the friends of that resort [i.e., the friends of"

48

 

conscription] to present it with utter frankness, and in
the light best adapted to dissipate the popular hostility.
‘Nothing of the sort was done.. . . . It was not only a
conscription, but an act passed by conscription.”

Defend Economic Despotism?

This might have been written about the recent arro--
ggant and impudent manner in which the conscriptioneers
forced this anti-democratic, this Hitleristic measure,
down the throat of the American people. And declar-
ing this choice morsel of Prussianism to be the very
jewel of ‘democracy at that!

They will taunt us: But surely you oppose the Hit-
ler “way of life,” and so you would certainly want to
defend the country, its “glorious democracy” and insti-
tutions, against Hitlerism, and how are you going to do
this without a disciplined, trained army? Our answer

, to that is that We detest Hitlerism (which most of the

conscriptioneers and warmongers do not), and that we
will fight it to the death, but we prefer to start and finish
that ﬁght within our own borders. We have hundreds
of thousands of Hitlers right in our midst, and it will
keep us quite busy to ﬁnish the fight, and, when once we
have finished that job, we shall have a democracy with-
out alloy, a democracy we can and will defend with en-
thusiasm, against any Hitler outside our borders, if by
that time there are any Hitlers left. To defend our
own economic despotism in any manner whatsoever
would be to defend the Very things to whose destruction
we have dedicated our very lives. “When freemen un-
sheath the sword, it should be to strike for Liberty, not
for despotism I” 1

Yes, We do not deny that even our greatly qualiﬁed
democracy is superior to the unspeakable hell of Hit-
ler’s Reich, and if the choice were limited to United
States capitalism, and the utterly decayed capitalism of
the Axis powers (Hitlerism), we should, no doubt,
support the lesser evil. But there is a third choice-—
industrial democracy———and we know also that conscrip-
tion and war will turn this country into a similar, if not
worse, hell of Hitlerism and Fascism. And so, again,
we should be defending the very thing of evil which we
would destroy. That sleek and oily champion of pluto-
cratic interests, Walter Lippmann, protestingly exclaims
that there is not “one scintilla of historical truth in the
assertion which is so frequently heard that free nations
transform themselves into totalitarian states when they
recognize the need for organization, discipline and au-
thority”——by which three designations Mr. Lippmann
means the shirt and ugly word “conscription.” And he
argues that “the downfall of the democracies has been
due to their weakness; they have been disintegrated
from within and then conquered from without because
they failed to discipline their liberties and to establish
authority in their democracy.” Cunning words, and
partly true words, but true in what respect? First, in
that those who did the disintegrating from within were
the very plutocratic elements for whose American coun-
terparts Mr. Lippmann labors so valiantly; and, sec-
ondly, that the weakness was the weakness caused by
the decay and collapse of capitalism and capitalist insti-
tutions. And there is no way of “curing” that weakness
except by adopting Hitlerism——leaving out of account,
of course, Socialism. That is what happened in Ger-
many, that is what happened in Italy, Spain, etc., etc.,
and in a somewhat different sense and set of circum-

50

 

stances, that is what happened in Russia. And the same
weakness is inherent in United States capitalism, and
the same result will be produced here if and when the
choice must be made between capitalism and Socialism,
and Socialism should fail of establishment; and it will
then happen whether a Hitler knocks on our gates or
not.

Discipline of the Barracks".

It is not democracy which the plutocrats and their
poodles are anxious to defend. Oh, no, it is their eco-
nomic system, their way of life, about which Mr. Will-
kie, that Wall Street paladin of democracy, also spoke
so feelingly the other day at Elwood, Indiana! And
the discipline and authority these plutocrats and pluto-
gogues shout about is the discipline of the industrial

barracks; the authority is the authority which wage ‘

slaves are supposed to owe the benevolent autocrats of
industry. It is signiﬁcant that these pleas and intellec-
tually dishonest arguments are identical to those ad-
vanced twenty-ﬁve years ago, during the period of pre-
paredness propaganda then carried on by the same ele-
ments that now are straining for military conscription
and industrial servitude. Pleading for conscription
then, the late Major General Leonard Wood assured
his masters and associates that conscription would make
of the young men “better citizens morally because they
will have learned to respect the law and the constituted
authority.”

Get it? Law and Constituted Authority! Respect
for constituted authority——free citizens in a free democ-
racy salaaming before the servants they themselves
placed in office! What General Wood meant, what
Lippmann means, is that the workers must accept their

SI

industrial servitude meekly, they must not strike, they
must work long hours at small pay, they must not ques-L
tion the prevailing order of things-—-in short, they must
be good industrial serfs! And that is the status they
are asked to defend against, Hitler—the glorious “sta-
tus quo” for which they are asked to lay down their
lives!

V.

Socialist Labor Party, Goal-Conscious Carrier
of Indtustrial Democracy.

The immediate future in America is not going to be
a pleasant one—except for the politicians, perhaps, the
War camarilla, and the despoilers of labor generally.
What little freedom is still left is likely to be curtailed
even more, until the time may come when, as the char-
acter in the play put it, “about the only freedom we got
left is the freedom to choose which one of our rights
We’ll go to jail for.”’ With conscription a fact, the first
step has been taken to fasten industrial serfdom
on the workers. The S.L.P. has ceaselessly warned
against just such a situation. We have been ignored, or

~ laughed at, and even now, while the chains are being

forged before the Very eyes of the workers, they pay no
heed. Just as the huge elephant permits puny men to
chain it, so giant labor, potentially all powerful, permits
puny politicians——conspirators against their liberties and
against American libertarian laws and principles—to
chain him, though with a brush of his hand he could
dispose of the lot of them as one brushes aside a mos-
quito.

History repeats itself, it is said, and not always as
a farce, but rather as a tragedy made inﬁnitely m-ore
tragical. We know we are in for it, and we must face
the situation as only well-posted and wide-awake men
and women can do————that is,,unﬂinchingly, unafraid, and

determined to cling to principle, and to maintain our or-
ganization, at this fated historic hour the only deter-
mined, goal-conscious carrier of the new democracy——-
Industrial Democracy—until sanity returns to this dis-
tracted generation. Since principle and organization are
one, we cannot abandon one without abandoning the
other. Hence, the matter for practical consideration is
the preservation and strengthening of our Party, the
husbanding of our resources. For these clouds will pass,
and the sun of freedom will some day shine on a race
of men who have learned that freedom springs from
knowledge and understanding, just as courage resides
in the head rather than in the heart.

Socialist Labor Party Press M ust Be Preserved
to Spread the Truth.

Of immediate importance is the safeguarding of our
press, that most precious weapon in the hands of civi-
lized man. Voices have been raised from the camp of
the enemy that the two old parties adequately supply
the needs of the people at this time. What this means
is clear-——the workers are expected to cling forever to
the shoddy bankrupt outfits which again and again have
betrayed them. And the industrial feudalists, the plu-
tocrats and their allies and servants, apply the same

-principle to the press. “Read the lies in our paper,”

they say in effect: “why bother about the truth and facts
when lies have brought us to our present eminence!”
Well, we repeat the timeless truism, that Truth alone
can make us free. And that until Truth and Freedom
are established, resting on the broad basis of economic
equality and total absence of exploitation, there can be
no democracy worthy the name, no world fit to live in
by civilized man.

54

 

The S.L.P. press, and in particular the WEEKLY
PEOPLE, must be preserved at all cost. Fain would
the powers that be silence the eloquent voice of the S.
I..P.-——fain would they put a gag upon our lips did they
but know how! Wendell Phillips, in thundering his de-
nunciation of the foul murder of Lovejoy, answered
the detractors of the free press——-those who had argued
that Lovejoy had no right to express opinions differing
from accepted views. “The gentleman,” he said, “says
Lovejoy was presumptuous and imprudent,—he ‘died as
the fool dieth.’ And a reverend clergyman of the city
tells us that no citizen has a right to publish opinions
disagreeable to the community! If any mob follows
such publication, on him rests its guilt! He must wait,
forsooth, till the people come up to it and agree with
him! This libel goes on to say that the want of right to
speak as we think is an evil inseparable from republican
institutions! If this be so, what are they worth?”

Echo answers: What are they worth! Of what

use are our vaunted rights if we are not to exercise them

in accordance with the light given us to judge what is
for the best of all? Are we to View the Declaration of
Independence-—noblest of immortal documents--and
say: This once stirred the hearts of men and brought
freedom into the world! Now it is only a museum-
piece to be treasured as we treasure the ancient marble
and dust of the Acropolis ?—Or are we to take it, per-
haps with rude, but reverent hands, and say: This is
our charter of freedom! Here and now we infuse it
with the breath of new life——the spirit is the same, for
that spirit is immortal. But the purpose is new, the ap-
plication is dilierent, the goal is enlarged. And by this
charter of freedom we stand-——as our revolutionary
fathers won political liberty and independence by its

55

 

terms, so we, if we be worthy sons of noble sires, shall
win industrial and economic freedom by its terms and
enjoinmentsl “Timid men,” said Thomas Jefferson,
“prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of
liberty.” We claim “the boisterous sea of liberty”!
Let the timid men embrace the beastly creed of fascism,
of Hitlerism, of Henry Fordisml We want none of
their barbaric industrial creed, none of their deadening
state-ism. The Political State is not merely the outward
symbol of class-rule; it is not merely the token of op-
pression; it is not merely the instrument of coercion——
it is all these, and more: It is the destroyer of our
manhood, the debaser of our intellects, the reducer of
our human dignity and the perverter of the noblest sen-
timentsl It is all these things, first by its original nature
and purpose, and secondly, by virtue of the fact that to
original iniquitous, however necessary and justified, pur-
pose, there has been added the fact of outlived useful-
ness. It exists on borrowed time, it smells of the tomb.
To history’s graveyard we consign it!

We of the Socialist Labor Party are charged with
being uncompromising, unyielding in our clinging to
principles. As to principles, we are uncompromising,
we are unyielding. As to means and measures, we say
that they must be in keeping with the goal, but also that
the end must not be invoked to justify meansvthat are
unworthy of the end which is the goal of Socialism.
Lincoln told us, and we agree, that “important prin-
ciples may and must be inflexible,” and that “compro-
mises of principles break of their own weight.” This is
profoundly true, and those who contend otherwise are
deceiving themselves if they are not deceiving their fel-
lows.

When disillusioned dreamers, doubting Thomases,

56

 

or impatient enthusiasts ask us: What is" the matter
with the working class? When they ask us: Why do not
the workers organize to establish that new, that higher,
form of democracy which some day must and will
prevail? We answer: There is nothing the matter
with the workers, except that they are exploited and
browbeaten, ﬂeeced and swindled and tricked out of
their rightful heritage. And we say that it is in human
nature to refuse indeﬁnitely to submit to exploitation, to
refuse indeﬁnitely to submit to being browbeaten and
swindled, and that in their search for the way out of
their misery and slavery, and with our never-ceasing
help and guidance, the workers are bound to strike the
trail that the Socialist Labor Party has blazed f-or them,
and which will lead them to the summit of working class
emancipation and the liberation of the human spirit.
That trail will lead to social and economic equality,
which is to say, to the true, to the real, equality-——~not the

- “equality” which concerns itself with mere external: or

trivialities. And that equality is the condition for peace
and happiness. Solon, the lawgiver, 2,500 years ago laid
down the maxim that “Equality causes no war.” VVe
say that it will guarantee peace, the quest of all men
whose minds have been stirred, whose consciences have
been touched by the great evil of our generation, and its
ramiﬁed consequences, the exploitation of the workers
by the capitalist class, in short, Wage slavery, capitalism.
“I believe in the spirit of peace,” said William Lloyd
Garrison, “and in the sole and absolute reliance on truth
and the application of it to the hearts and consciences
of the people. I do not believe that the weap-ons of
liberty ever have been, or can be, the weapons of des-
potism. I know that those of despotismare the sword,
the revolver, the cannon, the bombshell; and, therefore,

57

 

It is surprising that, while men and
women have struggled to achieve political
democracy, so I1-ttlc has been done to in-
tnoduce‘ democracyln industry.

——Bertrand Russell,
“Why Men FightL’_’

 

 

 

the weapons to which tyrants cling and upon which they
depend are not the weapons for me, as a friend of
liberty.”

This is as profoundly true now as it was one hundred
years ago. As we of the Socialist Labor Party seek to
terminate the class war in the only way this can be done,
that is, by abolishing capitalism and wage slavery; as
We strain to organize the useful Workers for their great
historic mission; as We labor to build the foundation for
the noble democracy of the future, We at the same time
oppose with all our strength the mad War now laying
Waste the earth, destroying our best manhood and
womanh-ood, While especially we resist to the utmost the
involvement of this country in that savage War.

58

 

VI.
Conclusion.

The sensitive German poet, ErnstT-oller, who died
a victimof Prussian militarism and of Hitlerism, wrote
that “man’s stupidity has no bounds at all.” We might
paraphrase that and say that the hypocrisy, arrogance
and impudence of a ruling class have ‘no bounds at all!
Through the intellectually dishonest logomachy of plu-
tocracy’s hired “landsknechts” of the pen, conscription
becomes democracy; capitalist private wealth is similar-
ly transformed into commonwealth, and the most brutal,
the most sordid, of all wars, the one that sins more
deeply than any previous war against human dignity,
human rights, against all that is sacred to civilized man,

‘ becomes a holy war, so pronounced, and so blessed, by '

the priests of established creeds! A London bishop,
the Rt. Rev. Geoliry Francis Fisher, as reported in the
press (Herald Tribune, August 12, 1940), declared
that this war (in part carried on againstfthe Italian
bandit state)-—-this war is “a war of freedom and reli-
gion, ‘but a war, too, of hopeful creation.”

“Freedom”! “Religion”! “Hopeful Creation”!
“F reedom”———a war which on all fronts is waged against
freedom! “Religion”—a war which everywhere is de-
stroying the very spirituality and dignity of man!
“Hopeful Creation”—--a war which in vast areas all
over this earth is causing untold destruction! And
down in Africa, a herd of wretched conscripts — prob-
ably poor, superstitious peasants—as shown in a news-
paper photograph, are kneeling before a Catholic priest.

59

 

receiving communion “before they go into battle against
the British”! So says the caption. The same G-od who
is asked to grant victory to British arms against poor
Italian peasants and workers is also asked to bestow
victory on Italian arms against poor British workers
and farmers! And they call this religion, the gospel
of the Christ who is said to be the Prince of Peace!
How long will civilized man suffer such hypocrisies,
such blatant blasphemies! When will the workers say,
of capitalist slavery and its beneﬁciaries and high priests,
what Wendell Phillips said fourscore years ago of slav-
ery:

“An intelligent democracy says of slavery, or of a
church, ‘This is justice, and that iniquity; the track of
God’s thunderbolt is a straight line from one to the
other, and the church or state that cannot stand it must
get out of the way.’ ”

Raucous noises ﬁll our ears; reason is for the most
part in exile; the hairy apes at the moment have the
upper hand; the spent and exhausted body of the old po-
litical class democracy totters to its grave, even before
its successor, Industrial Democracy, has yet taken shape.
Yet, the blessings of peace with plenty shall at last be
our enduring heritage; reason shall ﬁnally be perma-
nently enthroned in the universal, all-embracing democ-
racy of the future, and the surviving apes shall be placed
in security where their brute power can no longer harm
us. For powerful as are the devotees of brute force
now, they are in the long run the essence of weakness.
As the great German philosopher, Hegel, said (and
would that the German workers, at least, would heed
his words) :

“Material superiority in power can achieve no en-

60

 

during results: Napoleon could not coerce Spain into
freedom any more than Philip II could force Holland
into slavery.”

Organization—the M agic Key.

No, brute force can by itself neither establish free-
dom nor slavery. Knowledge of economic laws, under-
standing of social forces, and ORGANIZATION -
these are the magic keys which will open to mankind
the portals of true, imperishable democracy. As our
German poet said:

“Bounded is the sea,
And the earth is small;
Man’s stupidity
Has no bounds at all.

*
“Yet, if he chose, the earth
And all her fruits were his;
And lucky .be the man

Who now unlucky is.”
*

Men are dying by the countless thousands in Europe
today in defense of a dying social system, or in defense
of the dark creed that was rejected almost a half mil-
lennium ago. What a tragedy! Indeed, is it possible
for anything to exceed in tragedy and futility this: that
men should die for the dying, or the inglorious dead,
and perish on the altar of burnt-out faiths?

We of the Socialist Labor Party will hold fast. In
all this darkening world, where one tiny ﬂickering light
of freedom after another is extinguished, we will hold
aloft the torch of world freedom, residing now solely
in the ideal of Marxism. We will carry on to the last,

61

  

knowing that so long as there is a spark left from that
torch, there is still a chance to set the world aﬂame in
freedom and new life. And who can doubt that, de-
spite the present ascendency of the forces of darkness
—who can doubt that we shall yet witness the dazzling
light of working class freedom and human emancipa-
tion? For the ancient tree of democracy is not dead,
and it shall not perish. Rather shall it grow and yield
a more golden fruit of freedom than any which man has
known since the days of Solon and Cleisthenes-—the true
and complete freedom which can only be realized
through Industrial Democracy and the conquest of the
industrial ballot. Looking back on the age-long struggle
of man against slavery, recalling the countless heroes
and martyrs who died in order that that tree of democ-
racy might spread its branches shelteringly over all peo-
ples in ever higher and fuller measure, who can doubt
that we shall witness the passing of strife and conﬂict
among the children of earth, and that we shall witness
the materialization of the ideals for which the hearts of
men have bled, and for which the mightiest intellects
and noblest spirits have strained, since time immemo-
rial?

Ours is the privilege to be the actors in the greatest
drama in all human history. And ours, peculiarly, is
the duty, and the responsibility, to arouse the working
class to take the leading -part in this drama, and to play
it to a successful and glorious finish!

Ballot, “The Freeman's Vote,”
A Sacred Heritage.

Much has been said of late concerning the “battle
of the ballots” versus the “battle of the bullets,” with
American professional patrioteers patting themselves,
and each other, on the back in unctuous self-approval
for still clinging to the ballot as a means of settling so-
cial disputes. The “one hundred percenters,” or the
“two hundred percenters,” have neither cause, nor the
right, to claim any credit for the fact that the ballot,
however battered and trimmed, still survives in Amer-
ica. The professional patrioteers are either of the
propertied class, or representatives of that class, and
particularlyof the plutocracy. Had these gentry had
their way, democracy, the ballot, and all that goes with
these, would long since have ceased to exist altogether
and the republic of the founding fathers, meaningless
without democracy, would now be a thing of the irre-
trievable past. That the American democratic system
of balloting still survives, after a fashion, is due, first,
to the ceaseless efforts of the genuine Socialist move-
ment to support it, and, secondly, to the fact that as
yet no issue of sufficiently compelling importance has
arisen to frighten the plutocracy into exerting its great

65

    

power to scuttle democracy completely, as scuttle it
they Wlll eventually unless Socialist labor rises to rescue
1t, and to enlarge the scope and purpose of democracy.

The ballot, “the freeman’s vote,” is, or should be,
a sacred thing. It should not merely be placed beyond‘
the reach of the power of any group to corrupt it and’
restrict it, but it should be maintained in such a state
of health and responsiveness that on all grave questions.
aﬂecting the true interests and welfare of the majority,
it spontaneously presents itself as the arbiter, as the in-~
strumentality naturally and instantly to be employed by
the mass of the people who alone possess the right to
pass upon all such questionsland without whose exercise
of such right democracy ceases to have any meaning at
all. Where an entrenched power——be it a group of’
politicians in the guise of current government, or a
group of powerful and wealthy industrialists——effects
to restrict the ballot, to" deny the majority of the people
the use of the ballot for the settlement of unprecedented
questions of paramount importance, democracy, the
ballot, has been debauched, and an act of usurpation
has been committed by the entrenched minority. The
usurping minority may claim that its deﬁlement of the
ballot had for its purpose the saving of democracy; it
may designate its act of usurpation the very essence of

democracy. No matter. Usurpation it was;usurpation
it remains.

During the struggle between our revolutionary fore-
fathers and the British Crown it used to be said (as
was said while the great struggle between Charles I
and Parliament was developing more than I00 years
earlier) that “What an English king has no right to
demand, an English subject has a right to refuse.” Have
not American freemen even greater cause to say: “What

66

 

an elected government has no right to demand, an
American citizen has a right to refuse”? And Amer-
icans ask Congress and the President: Where» is your
‘warrant for imposing on freemen, without precedent.
military conscription in peace-time? If you hold the
freeman’s ballot sacred, why did you deny its exercise
‘to the sovereign power, the people, in a matter affecting
them most profoundly? Does not your refusal to sub-
mit peace-time conscription to the decision at the ballot
box imply contempt for the ballot, and distrust of your
"masters, the sovereign people? Answer, gentlemen,
answer now. If you do not answer now, you will do so
later when you will be held to strict accountability, if
the freeman’s vote survives under your battering as-
saults!

Restrictions on Ballot.

The restrictions imposed on the ballot, and the
abuses and misuse of the ballot, constitute a fascinating
subject for study. The restrictions are of two kinds:
The restrictions effected through usurping legislation,
and the restrictions (or revealed inadequacies) result-
ing from the process of transforming a political society
into a non-political, or industrial, society. The abuses
and misuse of the ballot are manifold, and some of
them have formed the subject of sermonizing by re-
formers who ignore the truth of the old saying that he
who keeps horses cannot look for clean stalls! Where
there are politicians there is bound to be corruption.
And politicians will be with us so long as the soil of
politics is cultivated, which is to say so long as capital-
ism is with us.

Restricting the ballot, in the sense of making it dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to start new parties that are

FOREWORD.

Can" democracy be reconciled with totalitarian com-
pulsion? The natural reply, already forming on your
lips, is NO! Yet “democracy”——the phrase, not the
substance——is being used in America today to promote
the very antithesis of democracy. It was “democratic”
to introduce to America the hated European system of
internal passports via alien registration. Conscription,
the most “abominable of despotisms,” as Daniel Web-
ster described it, that form of involuntary servitude that
is the very foundation of totalitarian regimes, became
the essence of “democracy” simply by calling it so. By
the same token, in this age of double-talk, to assert
one’s rights to those freedoms presumedly guaranteed
by the Constitution frequently becomes “treasonable.”-

How far this outrageous farce may be carried was
foreshadowed during the closing days of the Seventy-
Sixth Congress when Representatives brazenly proposed
direct compulsion for "labor and applauded the sugges-
tion that the “American people . . . . exercise a bit of
this force business” against those who "refuse to con-
form. It was a bold incitement to mob violence-—-again,
in the name of “democracy.”

On that occasion Representative Hoffman of Mich-
igan blurted out the ominous potentialities of conscrip-
tion. He said:

“You ask, What is the remedy? [For strikes, etc.]
The remedy is easy, and we have it in our hands if we
want to use it. . . . . I will support an amendment to the
conscription law which will conscript these men in the
factories and require them to render service to their
country the same as the soldier in the ﬁeld. (Applause)

 

out-and-out anti-capitalist, is a comparatively new de-
velopment in American political history. It is doubtful
that it antedates the present century. Of course, there
were property qualiﬁcations that restricted the indivi-
dual’s right to vote, but that is not the kind of restric-
tion discussed here. The restrictions making it increas-
ingly difficult for a minority party to appear on the bal-
lot have reached a point in certain states where they
amount to an unblushing declaration by usurping politi--
cians that no political party shall be tolerated which
challenges the present capitalist society and form of
government, thus reducing to mockery the claims in
behalf of American democracy advanced by politicians
and patrioteers generally. .

In California, for instance, upward of one-third of
a million signatures must be secured by a minority party
in order to qualify for the ballot, a task obviously be-
yond its power and resources if such a minority is a
working class party. California is probably the banner
state of political usurpation in this respect. In other
states the number of signatures required, while not so
large as in California, is nevertheless so large as to levy
an almost prohibitive tax on the resources of a working
class party, but even where this hurdle has been cleared.
there are usually a number of “hidden” bars which
come into full view when the main obstacle (the exces-
sive number of signatures) has been overcome. For in-
stance, in such states as New York and Illinois a certain
minimum number of signatures in so many counties
must be secured regardless of the excess number col-
lected in the state as a whole. Thus in Illinois a total
of 25,000 signatures must be collected, with not less
than 200 signatures from each of at least 50 counties.
In New York a total of 12,000 signatures must be col-

68

 

lected, with not less than 50 from each of the 61 coun-
ties in the state. If for any reason whatever signatures
should be rejected, the petitions are rejected, though
the total collected for the state as a whole may be many
times the number required. Through trickery it is a
comparatively simple matter for usurping or corrupt
politicians to cause the petitions from one county to fall
one or more below the required number. The ticket of
the minority party is then kept off the ballot, the heart-
breaking work and great amount of money expended to
secure the signatures having all been rendered vain.

Then there are filing fees, in some cases prohibitive,
perhaps a certain percentage of the salary attached to
the ollice for which nomination is made, the total of
which often is prohibitive, certainly to a working class
party. And, again, the right of a voter to sign a peti-
tion is in some states so qualiﬁed that it is virtually im-
possible in some communities to find enough qualiﬁed
voters to sign petitions. And where even these ob-
stacles fail to prevent a minority party from complying
with requirements, mob action and oﬁicial lawlessness
enter the scene and make certain that the ticket of the
minority party does not appear on the ballot, as witness
the outrageous collusion between lawless officials and
mob-leaders in certain Illinois towns recently, amount-
ing in effect to a conspiracy to keep the Socialist Labor
Party off the ballot in that state, a conspiracy which,
unhappily, proved successful.

Political Vote, at Founding of Republic,
A Complete Vote.

The latter-day opponents of democracy, the con--
tenders against the principle that majority rule must
prevail if we are to ha.ve an orderly society, never tire

69

 

 

of telling us that it is impossible, ﬁrst, to have all the
citizens meet in the manner of the earlier, primitive
township meetings, and, secondly, that the average citi-
zen knows nothing about aﬁairs of state, and, knowing
nothing about such, they ask why he should by his vote
be given the power and right to decide questions aFfect-
ing the welfare of the state and nation. Sometimes the
argument is also advanced (by the more outspoken plu-
tocratic elements) that since the vast majority own no
property, why should they be given the power to dis-
pose of the private property of the propertied class.

These are not arguments and contentions against
the ballot, or democracy. They are in reality argu-
ments against a political society and against private own-
ership of socially created and socially required wealth.
It is assumed, by the enemies of democracy, that there
must always be a political society, and that there must
always be a special, a small class which owns wealth,
and a large class which produces wealth. Although the
proposition is not put quite so bluntly, that is in eﬁect
the sense of the contentions against the right of the
majority to decide questions in a democracy.

Now, there is nothing natural or inherently rightful
about political society and private property. Political
society is a development and private property reﬂects
that development, and is otherwise a creature of man-
made law. There was a time when there was neither a
political society nor private property, and both will pass
in the fulness of time. The primary question is not one
of natural conditions and natural rights. Primarily the
question is: Which best serves the interests of the race
under particular conditions over which man has little or
no immediate control? If progress decrees that a small
class shall enjoy leisure and comfort (at a time when

 

abundance is not available to all) in order to promote
culture and the arts, and to prevent society from lapsing
into primitive savagery, then it follows that a large
class must subsist in poverty and slavery to provide the
wherewithal for the class of culture and social progress.
Slavery and poverty become “right” and “just” when
they constitute the price to be paid for progress. Slav-
ery and poverty become “wrong” and “unjust” when
such a price need no longer be paid for social progress.
At this point it may be in order to deﬁne slavery. Her-
bert Spencer has deﬁned it as follows: “That which
fundamentally distinguishes the slave is that he labors
under coercion to satisfy another’s desires.” That is as
satisfactory as any other deﬁnition that may be given of
slavery. We shall come back to it later.

At this point, however, we are concerned with such
restrictions or inadequacies of the ballot (i.e., the right
of the majority to decide questions affecting all) as
result from social changes in property relations, and in
the economic basis of society itself. Conﬁning ourselves
to America, we point out that when the Republic (or
American democracy) was founded, ownership of pri-
vate property was general, however uneven, or the ac-
quisition of property was within reach of all able-bodied
adults. Hence, there was no conflict between basic po-
litical rights and essential economic equality (barring
chattel slavery, of course). Hence, further, the politi-
cal ballot, insofar as it was reasonably unrestricted,
served the needs of the average citizen, and his exercise
of the rights of the ballot amounted in fact to an exer-
cise of his right to dispose of his property as he pleased,
and to order his society in such ways as to protect his
economic rights. The ballot under such conditions was
in fact a complete, a whole, ballot. It had meaning and

71

 

 

substance to the citizen, because it logically related, in
the main, to his economic status, and corresponded gen-
erally to the economic basis of his society. But it fol-
lows, then, that in the measure that the ballot ceases to
correspond to, or reflect, the individual’s economic sta-
tus and economic requirements, in that measure it ceases
to be a whole, a complete, ballot—in that measure, to
that deg-ree, it ceases to be a “freeman’s vote.”

In the earlielrdays the citizen, within the limits im-
posed by nature, was his own economic master. He
was, generally speaking, monarch of all that he sur-
veyed. In so far as he had to work, he was master, or
owner, of his work, of his “job.” Except for conditions
imposed by nature, he could determine his own hours
of labor, he could decide when to quit, What to do, and
how to do it. Only in his relation to the outside world,
that is, in his relation to fellow citizens who in the main
were similarly situated, was it necessary to submit ques-
tions to a majority decision (or sometimes to arbitra-
tion) and, of course, in matters concerning his and fel-
low citizens’ relations to the commonwealth, or the gov-
ernment. The political vote was inclusive——it was a
complete vote, unrestricted by his economic conditions,
chieﬂy to protect and safeguard him in the enjoyment of
his material possessions.

How stand matters today? Is the average citizen
economically independent, economically free? The
question need not be pondered at length———he is not eco-
nomically free, he is not economically independent. The
mass of the people stand today practically stripped of
private property. For the mass of the people of this
country (and the same is true generally throughout the
world of capitalism) private property rights have vir-
tually been abolished. This is no longer, as in the days

72

 

of our fathers, a system of society based on property
rights. It is a system of society based on the denial of
property rights to all but a few. According to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (1926), 87 per cent of the
people own only 8 per cent of the country’s wealth,
while 13 per cent of the “people” own 92 per cent of
the wealth in America. The propertiless work for the
owners of wealth, the owners of industry. They are, in
a very real sense, slaves—slaves in the economic sense,
and that is the sense which really determines slavery.
Let us go back to Spencer's deﬁnition of slavery:

“What is essential to the idea of a slave? We pri-
marily -‘think of him as one owned by another. To be
more than nominal, however, the ownership must be
shown by control of the slave’s action-—a control which
is habitually to the beneﬁt of the controller. That which
fundamentally distinguishes the slave is that he labors
under coercion to satisfy another’s desires. The rela-
tion admits of sundry gradations. Remembering that
originally the slave is a prisoner whose life is at the
mercy of his captor, it suffices here to note that there is
a harsh form of slavery in which, treated as an animal.
he has to expend his entire effort for his owner’s advan-
tage. Under a system less harsh, though occupied chieﬂy
in working for his owner, he is allowed a short time in
which to work for himself, and some ground on which
to grow extra food. A further amelioration gives him
power to sell the produce of his plot and keep the pro-
ceeds. Then we come to the still more moderated form
which commonly arises where, having been a free man
working on his own land, conquest turns him into what
we distinguish as a serf, and he has to give to his owner
each year a ﬁxed amount of labor or produce, or both:

73

 

retaining the rest himself. Finally, in some cases, as in
Russia until recently, he is allowed to leave his .owner’s
estate and work or trade for himself elsewhere, under
thecondition that he shall pay an annual sum.. . . .The
essential question is——H ow much is he compelled to
labor for other beneﬁt than his own, and how much can
he labor for his own beneﬁt? The degree of his slavery
varies according to the ratio between that which he is
forced to yield up and that which he is allowed to retain;
and it matters not whether his master is a single person
or a society.” (“The Coming Slavery.”)

The part quoted in italics may well be accepted as
Spencer’s deﬁnition of wage slavery, though he does not
name it so. The workers, toiling in the industrial tread-
mills, “yield up” to their masters, the employers and
owners of industry, the bulk of the wealth they produce.
According to U.S. Census Bureau ﬁgures for 1932, the
workers in the manufacturing industries produced $49,-
ooo,ooo,ooo worth of wealth, of which they received
$7,ooo,ooo,ooo in wages, or 1/7 of what they pro-
duced. That is, they “yielded up” to the masters ap-
proximately 85 per cent of the fruits of their labor.
“The degree of his slavery Varies according to the ratio
between that which he is forced to yield up and that
which he is allowed to retain” (Spencer). The ratio in
other pursuits (agriculture, mining, etc.) obviously does
not vary materially from that in the manufacturing in-
dustries, and the I 5 per cent, approximately, the work-
ing class as a whole receives out of the total wealth it
produces corresponds roughly to the wealth “owned” by
the workers, i.e., eight per cent, which is to say, practi-
cally nothing!

The workers in the factories work for a subsistence

74

 

Wage, that is, just enough to enable them to buy the
necessaries of life. Every worker knows that this is no
theory——it is a bitter fact. And we have the Word of
an early President of the United States that such a
-state amounts to slavery. It was John Adams, second
President of the United States, who observed:

“When the workers are paid in return for their
labor only as much money as will buy the necessaries of
life, their condition is identical with that of the slave.”

_ And so it is, and all the talk about democracy, free-
dom of action, etc., etc., cannot alter that stern, and, in
our day, criminal fact!

Today, Industrial Vote Is “The Fre-eman’s Vote.”

In what way does the exercise of the political vote
in behalf of so-called social legislation affect the eco-
nomic condition of the workers? In a real sense the
answer is: It does not affect it at all, except possibly
for the worse. Insofar as the workers succeed in having
laws enacted which supposedly improve the conditions
under which they labor, the voting merely aids in con-
solidating their slavery, and in codifying the terms of
their slavery. It does not, and cannot, alter or bene-
ﬁcially affect wage slavery itself. The political vote is
utterly unrelated to the economic status and conditions,
except as aforesaid. The political vote, taken as a
whole, is at best but a half vote—-it is not whole or com-
plete. “Cast your vote,” said Thoreau, “not a strip of
paper merely, but your whole inﬂuence.” The “whole
influence” of the workers’ vote must include the indus-
trial vote of the workers" within the precincts of indus-
try. To cast the political vote, citizens are organized

75

   

in political units—-wards, districts, counties and states.
To cast the industrial vote, the Workers must organize
into industrial units-—into Socialist Industrial Unions,
thoroughly integrated—that is, in the particular indus-
tries where they Work. When they vote in industry they
have an unrestricted ballot. For by the industrial ballot
they determine their hours of labor, they elect their own
foremen and superintendents, they elect their delegates
to the local and national industrial councils and to the
general congress of all industries where sits the indus-
trial government-—democratically elected, responsive to
the will of those who elected them, and charged with
the task of coordinating industry, and of integrating the
various industrial processes, in effect estimating the
needs of society and administering production and dis-
tribution as a whole. And they vote on any other ques-
tion aﬁecting their welfare as industrial workers and
members of the commonwealth.

But possession and exercise of the industrial ballot
require, first, organization into Industrial Unions, and.
in, due time, by the democratic process of the political
ballot, the abolition of private property rights in land
and industry—-in short, the abolition of capitalism and
the instituting of the Socialist Industrial Republic of
Labor. Then, and not until then, will the workers en-
joy true democracy; then, and not until then, will the
workers truly possess the freeman’s vote. For then,
but not until then, will the ballo-t———-the industrial ballot
—-really relate to the things vital to their lives and Wel-
fare, and then, but not until then, will the exercise of
that ballot have meaning and eﬁectiveness in governing
their affairs as producers, as co-owners of industry, so-
cially operated as it will then be socially owned.

To complete their citizenship——or rather, to emerge

76

 

at last as freemen in every sense, the workers must de-
mand, and organize to enforce the demand——

THE SOCIALIST RECONSTRUCTION
OF SOCIETY——
THE INDUSTRIAL VOTE.

But in setting about to effect the great change that
will insure the workers a whole, a freeman’s, vote, the
political ballot must be used, and this is the last great
service it will be called upon to render. And a truly
noble climax that will be to that great instrument forged
by man in his struggle for freedom, the political ballot.
For there is but one way in which the change from the
robber system of capitalism to the Industrial Common-
wealth of Labor can be effected peaceably, and that is
through the political ballot. Only at its peril will labor
discard prematurely this precious instrument of prog-
ress——precious still, however inadequate—-and when the
industrial ballot is the secure possession of the citizens
of the future, it will contain within it all the enduring
qualities of the political ballot. The industrial ballot
will become the crown-jewel of Industrial Democracy.
In the words of the great American writer, H. D.
Thoreau:

“Only his vote can hasten the abolition of slavery
who asserts his own freedom by his vote.. . . . Cast your
vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole inﬂu-
ence. A minority is powerless while it conforms to the
majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irre-
sistible when it clogs by its whole weight.”

The workers must use their political vote to hasten

the abolition of wage slavery, and to speed the conquest

77

  

And why not?” (Congressional Record, Nov. 25, ’4o.)

Why not, indeed? That, too, would be “demo-
cratic.” Have not these “democratic” Congressmen
said so?

It is true that it is only a philistine conception of
“democracy” which can be reconciled with totalitarian
compulsion. This “democracy” cannot be deﬁned as
government “of, by and for the people.” It can only
be deﬁned in nebulous terms, such as those used by the
knighted British labor leader, Sir Walter Citrine, before
the 1940 convention of the A. F. of L. “Democracy”
is “not a form of government” at all. “It is a way of
life. It is a spiritual quality,” he said.

Thus the “spiritual quality” is presumedly to be re-
tained, while the liberties we have heretofore associated
with democracy are one by one uprooted and new dis-
abilities are put upon us.

Surely, if ever a word needed redeﬁning, it was
“democracy.” It was natural and imperative that a
Marxist should undertake this task, ﬁrst because he
treasures the degree of democracy man has thus far
achieved; secondly, because he is devoted wholly to the
mission of bringing democracy into full ﬂower. Mil-
lions of workers today harbor doubts concerning the
“democracy” of recent measures adopted by the capi-
talist Political State under the pretext of “defense.”
Those who read this historical deﬁnition will learn that
their doubts are Well founded. They will learn that
beyond doubt democracy is being debased to evil ends.
And they will acquire the knowledge with which to help
combat the most monstrous swindle of our age.

of the industrial ballot. Though a minority today, the
Socialist Labor Party represents the interests of the
vast majority. It represents the hope of the workers,
and the practical possibilities of the future. At this
historic election we take our stand on the proposition
that the interests of the working class are the true in-
terests of society as a whole, and of civilization and
progress.

We shall resist the majority and stand alone as long
as the majority is Wrong, in the ﬁrm conviction that thus
alone are the ends of freedom and democracy advanced,
and in the only way by which they can be advanced. And
we shall prove irresistible; for we shall _“c1og” by our
Whole weight. '

And so, to the polls:

“The crowning fact

The kingliest act
Of Freedom is the freeman’s vote.”

By Daniel De Leon

No one was better equipped to outline the structure of the Socialist
Industrial Republic than De Leon, who ﬁrst conceived Industrial Union
Administration. In this classic of classics, De Leon cont-raposes ﬁe
political vote of capitalism with the industrial vote of Socialism; demon-
strates the workability and the desirability of democratic industrial rep-
resentation; and outlines in master strokes the program for Socialist
rewnstruction. The -most important single document a worker could

Introduction.

The time is out of joint, but unlike Hamlet we do
not cry—-

“Oh cursed spite,
That ever (I) we were born to set it right!”

The time is out of joint, and We who were born to
assist in setting it right hail with joy the opportunity of
doing so. There is none so dull but that he knows that
there is something fundamentally wrong in the world
today—none so illiterate but that he finds words to ex-
press his alarms, his fears- and, sometimes, his hopes.
But, unfortunately, there are but few who have any
inkling of what is really wrong——or, knowing, will risk
present security and comfort in order to right the wrong.
And fewer still there are who know how to snap back
again into joint this dislocated age. And one of the
reasons for that is the pernicious habit of men to con-
sider the political and economic institutions of their own
period as being of and for all time, and even when they
concede the possibility or advisability of change, the
concession is made with the sole thought of preserving
the essence of the current social order, though it may
be (as is the case now) the very cause of the disjointed
world. And so, in great crises, men will tinker with
externals, with this or that symptom of an organic so-
cial disease——a disease that is fatal, a disease that can
neither be cured nor endured—with the result that, on
the one hand, there is a momentary strengthening of,
