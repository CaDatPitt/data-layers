On Saturday, January 3 1 st following the Con-
ference on Repression, there was a midnight
march through the streets of Ann Arbor to the
County Building, the University Administration
Building and finally to North Hall, the home of
R.O.T.C. on this campus. These events have been
the subject of much discussion and therefore the
stating of the political ideas behind these events
should place them in a clearer perspective.

At the Conference, Jerry Rubin forcefully
reminded us that the government of the United
States does not care if we all sit in classes and talk
about being Marxists or communists or revolu-
tionaries: it is only when we act that the govern-
ment becomes concerned. And only through act-
ing, only through living our politics can we hope
to accomplish any radical change. The Ellllllilllli
march to the County Building was a concrete
manifestation of that idea. We demonstrated that
we will not only talk. but we will act—we will
march in the streets of this country to show the
leaders of this country that we will not be iiitim-
idated by them: we will not be afraid of the in-
creasing repression they are bringing down on our
Black brothers and sisters in Los Angeles. Chicago.
New York and Ann Arbor and our white brothers
and sisters organizing at the Chicago C o 1lSpIl‘LlCy
trial and elsewhere.

We will be in the streets of this country exer-
cising our power. It is in this context that the
trashing of the ROTC building must be seen. First
of all, it was a spontaneous. unplanned action by
approximately thirty of the 250-300 people who
continued on the march to North Hall. Though
it was spontaneous, it was not simply an expres-
sion of personal anger or frustration. Quite to the
contrary, it was a rational, politically motivated
action on the part of all who participated.

Clearly a few, or even many. broken windows
will not destroy ROTC. However. it is a symbol-
ic act against that institution, demonstrating to
the U.S. government and military that there are
people who will not only talk about destroying-
but who will act to bring about that end. They
will act by organizing a political movement which

will destroy ROTC and other institutions in this

country which perpetrate imperialism. The action

Saturday night was a stimulus to this. It was a

beginning. Above all, it forced people to confront

the issues involved-it hit people at all levels of
political consciousness and forced them to think
deeply about the issues of the use of violence a-
gainst institutions such as ROTC and the military.
It strengthened the participants and strengthened
and moved observers,so that perhaps the next

time the observers will become participants.

The issue of the “violence” of the action must
also be seen in its proper context. That context
is: certainly it was violence—-but it was violence
against property, not against human beings! As
Bishop Crowther pointed out to us at the Teach-
In, many people in this country are concerned
about violence to buildings but not about physi-
cal violence to men and psychological violence
to the minds of men. The U.S. government per-
petrates violence against human beings on a scale
more horrible than our minds can imagine. The
government is attempting to commit genocide
against the Vietnamese people and the Black
Panther Party. This University supports those

: policies with $16 million of classified and war

research, with recruiting for the U.S. military and
multi—national corporations, and with the train-
ing of military officers through ROTC. And yet
people are still concerned about violence to build-
ings. People cry, people hurt, people suffer. And
if we must choose between people and buildings,
we will choose people every time. I

Student Pickets
Close GE Plant

CINCINNATI (LNS) —— 100 non-union pickets.
mostly students. succeeded in shutting down the
Evendale General Electric plant for several hours
the morning of Jan. 28. A court injunction had.
banned union picketing because the Evendale
plant is a major government supplier ofjet engines
and rocket casings.

The demonstrators. mostly from Antioch Col-
lege, stopped cars at the plant gates, distributed
leaflets and discussed the strike with the drivers--
resulting in a major traffic tie-up. Cincinnati pol-
ice. caught off-guard, were slow in arriving, as they
were busy preparing to handle a massive march in
support of the municipal workers’ strike, now set-
tled. When the cops did arrive, the students left
peacefully, planning to return every morning for
the duration of the strike.

The student picketers (typical sign: “GE Gets
Rich, Gls Die”) were well received by union mem-
bers, who intend to continue the strike till GE
meets their demands: wage increases geared to
inflation, a union shop, and functioning grievance’
boards.

With a guard at every door.

The burly plaiiiclothes pig glanced suspicious-
ly at each student walking ast. It was clear they
all looked the same to him. He was on alien turf
like a white man in Harlem with deep dark fears
that some "crazy yippie would put a knife in his
back, real or rubber, that his manhood would be

his fragile sanity destroyed by LSD in his coffee.

There were lots more like him pacing the SAB,

All came to the carnival—the Chase Mziiiliattaiiikgg
Stop—the-Recruiter Life Carnival, the latest ir‘i‘-‘at-'~
series of SDS recruiter actions. I

SDS had previously hit the Navy and marines,
Allied Chemical for DDT, and Dupont for its
racist control of Wilmington, Delaware. Now it
was Chase's turn.

It was like Nelson in South America. “Ilonkic
go home.” Like Nelson, the recruiter was here to
check out the profits from corporate investments,
here the corporate investments iii‘higlier education’
rather than those in plantations, South American
military dictatorships or supermarkets. Like
Nelson, the Chase man didn’t make it through his
planned stay, and wasordered home to New York
rather than face a student demonstration.

Chase Manhattan is the Rockefeller’s bank.
Nelson’s brother David is chiirman and largest
single stockholder.

The Rockefellers together own controlling
interest in Chase. Chase Manhattan is also one of
the key financial institutions in holding together
and extending the American economic and
political dominance over the underdeveloped
countries of the third world.

The protection of American foreign invest-
ments and corporate profits demands stable
capitalist third world governments. The price of
these investments is often heavy repression and
intolerable living conditions for the people of the
third world nations. A case in point with particu-
lar relevance for Chase is South. Africa.

In South Africa, twelve million black people
are the culture slaves of the growing Afrikaner
fascism of some three and a half million whites.
While the whites have the fourth highest standard
of living in the world, every third black child dies
of undernourishment before she is a year old.

The average white mine worker makes $3,214 a
year, the average Black miner $196. This is the
system called apartheid.

In 1960, a peaceful demonstration by Blacks
for subsistence living turned into a massacre as
troops fired into the crowd. The Sharpeville
massacre made foreign investors wary. The Black
revolt, so long brutally suppressed, seemed to be
coming at last. The regime was in trouble, its
economy collapsing. It was then that a consortium
of American interests, including Chase Manhattan

Bank and First National City Bank, whose board
chairman is cousin James Rockefeller, put up a
$150 million loan. The economy became sta-
bilized and apartheid was saved.

Apartheid was saved because apartheid was
profitable for Western corporate rulers. South
Africa has absorbed $4 billion in U.S., British,
French and German direct investments, which
yield a return nearly twice the world average.
South Africa also produces 70% of the Free‘

Fruehauf on Strike

 

“Watch out, he’s a bad one,” said one of the
women in the picket line at Gate 2. The man to
whom she referred was trying to drive his white
Mustang through the moving pickets. Two pigs
assisted him by clearing a path through the line.
Three days before the man in the Mustang had

run his car into the woman who shouted the war-
ning.

Similar scenes were played at four other gates
as Fruehauf executives and scabs drove in to re-
port for the morning shift. At Gate 4 in the rear
of the plant, some of the more militant strikers,
assisted by a dozen students, bumped on fenders
of the cars of scabs until Detroit police reinforce-
ments arrived. Altogether, 40 young people from
Ann Arbor and Detroit last Friday began walking
picket lines with some of the 290 members of
lUA\tlV Local 889 who are on strike against Frue-
iau .

Fruehauf principally is known for making truck-
trailers. In recent years it has expanded to build-
ing shipping containers and army truck beds. It
currently has a rush war contract to develop an

 air conditioner for army trucks, presumably to

make them easier to use in tropical climates like
Vietnam or Thailand. Recently Fruehauf has
been looking fora piece of the action in ghetto
redevelopment: in its Detroit yards stand several
prototypes of low cost housing, each consisting of

, two semi-trailers welded together and selling for

$17,000. '

In May 1969 the office and technical workers
at Fruehauf began to organize a UAW local which
would bargain for them. Petitions were circulated
and an election was called which the union won.

Eighty per cent of the workers are women. As
secretaries, clerks and comptometer operators.
they appear to have held spiffy wliite-collarjobs.
In reality they had serioustgripes. Georgia Pope.
a 22-year-old secretary. was promised three pay
increases. She got one. After six months with-
out one of the promised raises she went to her
boss. “He answered that he didn’t like my atti-
.tude.” Another woman asked her boss what pen-
sion she would get after 37 years with the coni-
pany. He replied that she would get SI6 a ‘month.
There is no hospital or life insurance for Fruehauf
retirees. Without grievances like these, the union

_- would never have won the election.

Throughout the summer and fall, Fruehauf re-
fused to bargain. The company didn’t invoke any

 of the “individuals have a right to work” bullshit

i

which characterized company excuses in the thir-
ties and forties. Fruehauf has said repeatedly that
it just doesn’t want a union, period. The workers
struck last November 19. The conipany’s stra-
tegy has been to wear down and starve the union
by engaging it in a proliferation of court actions
which couldn’t be settled before 1981. The Nat-
ional Labor Relations Board, supposedly a neutral

, mediator to the dispute, has sent several staff mem-

bers who have recorded the names of pickets and

 

SCRB ED

prevented them from talking to scabs.

Violence began November 24 when a company ‘
executive gunned his car through a picketline.
Three workers were seriously injured. The police
who witnessed theincident, have never arrested
the executive.

On the rear of every blue-and-_white.Detr_oit_
Police Tactical Mobile Unit car IS the inscription:
“Protectors of Liberty.”

"Protectors of Fruehauf,” said a woman picket.

The pigs never have been neutral. Symbolically,
they use the Fruehauf guard shack as a warming
station, a place to drink coffee and have a smoke.
Really, they enforce liberty by ushering scabs into
the plant with clubs.

The pigs have beaten pickets several times

in the strike. On December 5 during a peaceful
solidarity march of 400 people, 200 pigs came
armed with clubs, gas and shotguns. The police
haven’t brought shotguns to picket lines since the
thirties. “Police brutality” is an easy phrase among
the strikers.

Perhaps one might examine what kind of liber-
ty it is which the pigs protect. The government’s
laws, of course. are supposed to uphold liberty.
As invoked by Fruehauf in the courts and enforced
by the pigs, those laws uphold the right to scab
and break a union. Further, examine the chief
enforcers of those laws. Raymond H. Lyons is
a Fruehauf vice-president; he is currently in charge
of breaking the strike. Lyons also sits on the
governing board of the Michigan Employment
Security Commission, which has as one of its
paper functions the duty to uphold the right of
workers to organize. During the strike, Lyons

_ has held on to his position.

So the young people came last Friday. At the
rear gate a young woman worker began things by
throwing a rock through a company window.
Later, as the pickets tried to stop Fruehauf exec-
utives from driving in, they opened car doors,
ripped off antennas, smashed headlights, and
banged on car bodies. In front, glass doors were
mysteriously chipped by thrown ball bearings.
Edward Grace, the bald-headed president of
Fruehauf, later came out to pick up a few bearings
and rolled them in his hands to the accompani-
ment of cries of “Mr. Grace, you’ve lost your
balls.’’ Each time a scab or executive tried to
drive his car through one of the gates, the pickets
tightened and slowed, and the pigs had to clear a
way. ’

For 80 days before Friday the strikers have
fought similar battles. They have not yet won;
they probably will not Win until hundreds of
people can outmaneuver the pigs and block the
gates to the plant.

A striker in the union hall said: “We won’t go I
back to work until no one else can get in.”

Who were the 44 million unpaid domestic wor-
pkers in the United States in l969?—women. We
swept the floors, sani-ﬂushed the toilets, scraped
the dog-poop off the rug, and raised the children.

We found ourselves slaving in our homes in a society
 that not only refused to recognize our labor with

‘wages, but was crass enough to glorify that labor.

The limited role of mother and housekeeper has
been foisted upon us from the doll house to the .
kitchen. Society keeps us virtually powerless in
this role. Women are isolated in the home from
the social and political apparatus and from other
women. We live through the man whose company
and house we keep.

Since eighty percent of the consumption in
society takes place in the home and women pur-
chase most of those goods, advertisers aim to please
women. As “housewife” she buys, and as “sex-

. mate” she buys. “Nothing makes markets like a

marriage. There’s new business in setting up a

.1 house and further business in raising a family. All
1 together it’s big business, appliances and house
_ ‘furnishings to stepped-up insurance and bigger

luv»

cars.” (N.Y. Times ad for T.V.‘Guide, 1 1/6/68)

Last year women spent 36 billion dollars on
fashion goods in the United States. While we are
keeping ourselves desirable for our boyfriends,
our bosses, or our husbands, corporations are get-
ting richer. In 1968, Revlon, producers of cosme-

-tic lotions and beauty salon fixtures in twenty-six
domestic and thirty‘-nine foreign plants, made a
profit of $46.5 million. Max Factor profited
$28.7 million in 1968.

Not being vital to production, women are de-
graded to mindless consumers. Our consumption
keeps production up, as more items are created
for us to consume.

— We leave the drudgery of the home only to per-
form menial jobs in society. Women as industrial
managers, administrators, or professionals are
scarce. Five percent of the doctors, nine percent
of the scientists and one percent of the engineers
are women. Of the 1,495 four-year college pres-
idents in 1964, only 1 17 were women—-and all but
eight headed Catholic women’s colleges. Of the =
644 two-year college presidents, only 62 were
women,fwith all but eleven heading Catholic
women’s colleges. On the other hand, 7 out of 10
clerical workers and 9 out of IO receptionists
were women. »

Society also herds us out of the home to pro-

, cluce when there is a labor shortage (which occurs

when consumption is carried on by the govern-

 ment in the form of huge defense expenditures).
 -Afwe then flock to fill the labor vacuum; doing

clerical work, service jobs, and unskilled factory

I work. During World War II, when ‘the men were

fighting, American women filled their vacated
jobs. When the war was over, men returned to
claim their jobs, and Rosy the Riveter became
Rosy the can-opener.

Brought up not to expect meaningful labor,

We are easily manipulated on the labor-market.
Two-thirds of the women working in 1967 held
part-time jobs, saving their employers the expense
of fringe benefits and medical care. We accept pa
part-time work because our first allegiance is to
the home-work is something done in our spare
time. Of the 28 million working women in 1968

. (together comprising one—third of the labor force)

a meagre fifteen percent was unionized.

When seeking employment, women face dis-
crimination on the basis of sex. Women are paid
proportionally lower wages than men holding the
same position. When a woman takes home $.60
the neighboring white male pockets $1.00. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Department of Labor Sta-
tistics, in 1964 non-white males earned a median
annual income of $4,300, white females, $3,800,
and non-white females, $2,674. White males far
exceed any group with an annual wage of $6,950.

The most disadvantaged group in the labor
force is the non-white female. She is exploited
both on the basis of her color and her sex. She
is given the lowest-paying jobs. In 1964, half
of the domestic workers were non-white women,
receiving a yearly wage of $1,133. Along with
the majority of working women, she has to work
torsupplement her husband’s meagre earnings.

But what about the children? Are they left
unattended while the woman works‘? Only a few
women can afford to send their children to child-
care centers that cost $25 or more a week. All
todether, there were 13 million children of work-
ing mothers in this country last year (one-fifth of
the children under the age of fourteen); there
were child-care facilities for only 350,000 of
those children. '

We are not going to be granted economic and
political equality without a fight. It is not in the
interests of those who control the means of pro-
duction to improve the economic status of women.
In fact, capitalism and women’s equality are
mutually exclusive. Only by completely restructur-
ing the economic system will we be able to gain
liberation. We will fight to build a society in
which women and men share equally in the lives
they create for themselves and their children,
and in which both will assume only the roles
necessary to allow them to fulfill their potential.

The Tidal and Victobg
  of Robert Smith

The trial of an EMU black student, Robert
Smith, ended in a mistrial called by Judge Ross
Campbell, presiding in the Washtenaw County
Circuit Court on January 23 during the fifth day
of the trial.

Smith was arrested February 20 of last year for
making a speech to a large crowd assembled in
front of and across the street from Old Weird -
Haro1d’s house (Harold Sponberg, President of
EMU) at 1 1A.M.,just two hours after 13 black
students were arrested in an attempted takeover
of the administration building to enforce their
demand for a black studies program, open admis-
sions, and a black Vice-President for Minority
Affairs—-there were 11 demands in all. Most_nf
the demands were recommended _to the President
in May, 1968 by EMU’s Human Relations Com-
mission. But from May to February the President
had taken no action and given no response.

When arrested, Smith was charged with “using
obscene language in the presence of women and I
children,” although the charge was quickly‘
changedto “inciting people to riot,” a felony.

” During the four days of testimony, Prosecutor

Karl Fink called several witnesses, all of whom

were poliee officers except one. Even with the aid _

of these well-respected” prosecution witnesses, «i

11: Elk Vzlals liinable to establish that_the words Smith
ere 3 , In fact,’ incited people to riot.” The

prosecutor was slow and dull -witted, with a court-
room manner like his name.

 

On the other~hand, Smith was represented by
the brilliant and outspoken black revolutionary
attorney _Ken Cockrel of Detroit. During cross-
examination of prosecution witnesses Cockrel
demolished the prosecutor’s case.

Only two defense witnesses were able to testify i
before the mistrial was declared. Some of the '5
significant facts that Cockrel was able to establish
are: 1) the crowd reacted to Smith’s speech only
by cheering, singing, clapping, and raising clenched
fists. ‘Most prosecution witnesses verified this. In
addition, the first defense witness showed a fifteen
minute movie depicting thenon-violent mood of
the crowd just prior to and immediately following

Smith’s speech. Fink submitted no films for evi-

dence, although there were at least two policemen
taking movies on February 20. 2) All the area
police agencies (Ypsi, Campus, Washtenaw Coun-
ty, and State) knew of the disturbance at least by
7:30 P.M. the night before. Sponberg made no
attempt to contact any black students to discuss
their needs, but permitted squads of riot-equipped
police to enter, occupy, and intimidate an other-
wise peaceful campus. 3) Captain Smith of the
Ypsi police, who was in charge of preparing the
prosecution’s case, had taken no notes at any of
the 180 interviews he had conducted, had kept

no written records of his investigation, had made
no attempts to interview any of the people who
were in the crowd, and didn’t even know who the
complainant was!

The prosecutor and his witnesses were exposed
as nothing but untogether idiots. The jury was
obviously responding to Cockrel and the defense
case, while sitting back and dozing whenever Fink
addressed the court or questioned witnesses.

The judge, Ross Campbell, sensed that the
prosecution’s case was going poorly. The role of
most judges is that of a segc_>n_d prosecutor,Aand,

Judge Campbell was no exception. When Ken
Moon, a black Assistant Dean of Students at EMU
was onthe stand for the defense, Fink asked:

“Did you hear the statement ‘If you don’t meet
with us we’ll burn this place down’?” Cockrel
objected on the grounds that the question was
prejudicial and inﬂammatory. The judge hesi-
tated and then asked Cockrel_“Do you really. think

it’s prejudicial?” Cockrel reaffirmed his position.

Then Judge Campbell spoke in a very serious
tone. “This is a serious problem. It’s the court’s i
duty to see that this is a fair trial. This is an A- ’
merican court of justice.” (Gallery snickers.)
Then he went into a long rap about what Amer- I
ican justice is supposed to be and _declar_e_d a mis-
trial. - FRANK MICHELS

Herbicides llll‘ Illllllll ﬂllll Pllllll

Dow must have been nervous about it. On the
one hand, if the company made a formal
announcement that it no longer produced napalm,
it would have appeared that the anti-war kids
had won. On the other hand, if Dow made no

announcement, the sit-ins, and file-burnings would
continue and the evil publicity would continue.
So in late November Chairman Carl Gerstacker
quietly let the word drop in a speech in Los
Angeles. Dow wasn’t making napalm any more.

Well kids, it ain’t so. Not only is Dow planning
to continue making napalm, but also the company
is protecting American imperialism with even
more genocidal products.

In the middle of December an investigator in
West Germany discovered that a Dow subsidiary,
Badische-Dow, was building a $50 million plant
there. One of its products was to be napalm.

But Dow Chemical manufactures more than
10,000 products. Some of them are far more
insidious and effective killers than napalm. Two
of these are made in the company’s agricultural
chemicals division. They are herbicides: 2,4-D
(dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5
trichlorophenoxyacetic acid).

On February 4 a report appeared on ABC
News that after the U.S. Forest Service had
sprayed herbicides in several canyons around
Globe, Arizona, frightening things began to
happen. Plants which formerly grew straight now
grew in coils. Children became delirious. Women
suddenly experienced vaginal bleeding and
several had to undergo hysterectomies. The off-
spring of goats and chickens were either born
dead or with massive deformities. The spray used
was a mixture of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5—T.
A similar mixture, given the code name Orange, is

dropped on Vietnamese jungles in concentrations
ten times that used around Globe.

Dow Chemical Company is one of the Chief
developers of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. In the early and
mid— Sixties the company signed many contracts
with the Pentagon to study the application and
defoliating effects of herbicides. Company
chemists wrote academic articles with theses that

herbicides like 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were beneficial
“when used properly”. Today Dow is one of the
biggest producers of allherbicides and one of the
largest suppliers of herbicides used in Vietnam.

Why are Dow’s herbicides dangerous?
Scientists began to question the use of 2,4-D
'2.4,5-T, PCNBand cacodylic acid (a compound
containing 55% arsenic) in Vietnam in 1966, when

‘Wit became apparent that rather than testing the

if,‘ chemicals on an isolated range, the Chemical

"' Corps was using populated areas of Vietnam for
trials. Cacodylic acid, for example, was found to
turn rice stalks yellow “in a single application.”
T-he effect of cacodylic acid and other herbicides
on the people eating the rice was not studied.
Whether or not this was a sin of omission in 1966
didn’t matter by 1968 when the United States

gave up trying to win the Vietnamese countryside
away from the NLF and instead began a deliberate
campaign either to kill or to drive into the Ameri-
can—controlled cities the people of Vietnam.
Genocide.

On June 10. 1969, the Saigon newspaper Tia
Song reported numerous human birth defects in
Tayninh province after repeated sprayings with
3.4.-D and 2.4.5—T. Several days later the news-
paper was closed down. Early in November the
Provisional Revolutionary Government reported
that after extremely heavy sprayings in Tayninh
from July 18-20. fifty children died. In the months
afterward there was a marked increase in mis-
carriages and malformed births.

These published accounts are corroborated by
laboratory studies conducted’ last year by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the British
National Cancer Institute (BNCI). NCI classified
2.4.5-T and PCNB as having “probably dangerous
teratogenic (birth—deforming) effects.” 2.4-D was
classified as “potentially dangerous.” The BCNI
report revealed that 54% of experimental mice
affected by 3.4.5—T and 2.4—D had cleft palates and
serious eye and other birth defects. Still another
American study showed that while the usual pro-
portion of abnormal fetuses among rats ranged from
7 to 13%. that percentage rose to 39% when the

rats were given a daily dose of 4.6 milligrams per
kilogram of body weight of 3.4.5-T. That pro-
portion rose to 90% when the dosage was increased
to 21.5 mg per kg. Arthur W. Galstoii. a biologist
at Yale. estimates that a pregnant Vietnamese
woman would ingest 50 mg of herbicide per day
after a “normal” spraying.

A 50 mg dosage after such a spraying probably
is neither lethal nor teratogenic. However. most

sprayings are not “normal.” Pentagon officials ad- »

mit that herbicide-laden planes often develop

mechanical trouble or are fired upon, causingthem

to dump their loads over small areas.
But since 1968 most deaths and birth defects

cannot be attributed to such accidents. What may I

have been non-lethal concentrations of herbicide
in 1966 have been increased and used in lethal
ways. Noam Chomsky has shown in “After Pink-
ville” that the United States is attempting sys-
tematically to wipe out the NLF-controlled coun-

tryside. In this context deaths from herbicides ‘ -
like 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are not accidental by-

products of war. The herbicides themselves, then, 
are not mere defoliants designed to strip the iun- 

gle cover from the Vietnamese, which was the

Pentagon’s original rationale. Rather, herbicides. I —. 

are a weapon of mass slaughter in a desparate
attempt to destroy the successful Vietnamese
revolution by destroying-the people: - - ~ A»

Dow produces herbicides as it produced
napalm: for profit, market and country. By

selling 2,4,5-T, Dow not only makes a profit for  

itself, but also performs a social act which re-
: inforces and perpetuates a monopoly market ex-
’ change system which consists of a pattern of
’ billions of such acts. This economic system,
whether called “free enterprise” as it was fifty
_r years ago, or a “guided economy” as it is today,
still defines the national interest of the United,
f’ States. Americatries to defend this interest abroad
 by promoting societies with similar economic

 systems. For example, John Kennedy’s Alliance
.for Progress, the “democratic alternative” for
».South America, was in reality a mechanism for

Einsuring profitable investments for giant American
 firms. The risk of these investments was to be

1" averted through facades of democracy in Latin
America which included the rich and the middle
,classes and excluded the overwhelming majority
 of poor people.

 : Fin—ally_, Dow sells herbicides for country. By,

S‘  4 jturnirfg“9a profit on weapons of mass slaughter,

F Dow not only participates in the American

 national interest, but actively defends that interest
 as well. - BILL BACHMANN

REPRESSION AT HURON HIGH

(note: The writer, a student at A nn A rbor
Huron High School, was suspended for three .
days for distributing the last issue of the
_Up_A gainst The _W_a_ll Street Journal

inside the school.)

Feb. 2,1970

The school, an institution of the people, the
main educator of social ethics and idealism, the
brain camp of Imperialist America...

The ‘underground’ paper, the voice of the
decent people, has been silenced today, as it’s
always been in the past! During class change,
students hurriedly took the voice into their
possession. but the administration’s S.S. was on
the job, as usual, and reported immediately to
‘reactionary headquarters’. The iron hand was
lowered swift and hard upon the fly they had in

their web. The result, suspension, (or might I say ‘

‘eliniiiiatioii’). Today was the first day of the
semester. an important day, for a new class
schedule must be digested. On that same day,
communists are eliminated from the school of
‘democracy’.

Saturday night, the R.O.T.C. building was
trashed. Right On!! It was a target of the
Activist Forces. Mission Accomplished. The
movement must expand, move beyond the uni-
versity. and into the high school, a place where
oppression first begins to hit hard. The high
school is where education in revolution must
begin. The high school must be a main target of

the movement. The people must take what is
theirs! Freedom of speech must be won. nowll

.— BULLSIHT
  AT HURON HIGH

Congratulations go out to the nicotine freaks

, at Huron High. They were recently awarded

the privilege of attending a smoking clinic

upon being caught smoking in school, instead

of being immediately suspended. However, if

they don’t attend the clinic they will be sus-

pended from school as they will be if they are
caught smoking a second time.

This clinic apparently will inform the smokers
of the dangers of tobacco and tell him that
smoking “may be hazardous to his health” _
by causing cancer, heart trouble, and emphy-

V sema. Students attend a few sessions of this
clinic and are then free to go out and wait to be
suspended for exercising their addiction.

Once again the power-holding people in our
society have chosen to treat a sickness (tobacco
addiction) by dealing out penalties to the
“offenders.” And this time they have decided
to force_ some anti-smoking information down
your throat. Ann Arbor school administrators
have recognized that punishing people for
smoking diminishes respect for their authority.

Why don’t they realize that punishing people
for refusing to digest the information they
hand out, for failure to attend classes, for not
accepting the general harassment of students
by teachers and administrators diminishes
respect for their “authority” many times

more? But after all, that is their authority.

di a1 edrtic .

How a person just like you comes to raise the
NLF flag at the County Building, trash the ROTC
building, and smash Ann Arbor Bank’s windows;
and say “it is good”:

. The state is a body propelled in a certain di-
rection. My study has resulted in a level of in-
formation—continually substantiated—that the
direction of our state is bad because of the way
it affects those without as well as within. Con-
venient classifications for the malady are capi-
talism, racism, personal profit, and imperialism
of the classic Roman-British model. It is neces-
sary to arrest and redirect the motion ofthe
body.

The initial means was dialogue and argumen-
tation. The insufficiency of this means was soon
evident. The reason this method didn’t work
was its fallacious assumption on our part of
willingness to reciprocate on the part of the state
{and the state is anyone who supports things as
they are). A further false assumption on our part
was that we thought we were addressing what
was of value to the state. that is, a common set
of idealistic principles. A new means had to be
found. It was and is necessary to raise the level
of the struggle so long as the people in power
persist with the status quo.

When it was discovered that the true basis of
their values was.mat.eria1ism and profit, a cor-
responding application had to be made. Since
we can’t rent a Rand military think-tank and

fight with the state on its own terms, we must
adapt and engage in the selective destruction of

property.

The message is still the same; that is, I address
what you hold‘ to be of value and state my grie-
vance regarding a matter that concerns both of us.

So the dialectic has ended and tliere’s oc-
casion for random observations like it’s really
funny to read the Ann Arbor News shockingly
report that there appeared to be no attempt to
take money from the bank although its windows
were broken. Don’t they understand that to
have done so would have been to accept their
methods and values‘? Respect for humanity
will assert itself over the power of the dollar.
Power to the imagination and fuck money!
Our celebration is the assertion of life. Our
vision transcends national boundaries and ex-
presses solidarity with the oppressed in the

Third World as we struggle in the mother country.

We are participating in something larger than
ourselves. Power to the life culture.
