MELLON
GOT RICH

Aluminum was a gold mine during the war, for the Mellons
charged the United States government 32 cents a pound for this
indispensable war metal. After the war was over, the price
dropped to 22 cents and even now the government has suits pend-
ing against Aluminum for wartime over-charges.

Oil and Imperialism

When a penniless prospector struck the Lucas oil gusher in
Texas in 1901, he unwittingly gave the Mellon family a big boost
toward their $743 ,ooo,ooo oil corporation. This was the biggest
gusher ever struck and the ﬁrst one in the Southwest. Lucas and
his backers, Pittsburgh men, had to turn to Mellon for cash to
develop the new oil ﬁeld. The result was Gulf Oil, a proﬁtable
and completely integrated independent oil company.

The Mellons had their hands in oil before. They speculated in
the western Pennsylvania ﬁeld and trimmed Standard Oil to the
tune of $2,000,000 when in 189 5 they forced the Rockefeller com-
pany to buy their pipe line from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. That
involved changing the Pennsylvania law forbidding pipe line
mergers, but the Mellons and the Rockefellers took care of that in
the legislature, thus illustrating their control of the government
machinery.

Gulf Oil Corp., in on the ground ﬂoor in the great Texas ﬁeld,
was too big for the Rockefellers to push under, especially when
the Mellons stood behind it. So Standard Oil, Gulf and a few
other big companies came to an agreement regarding prices and

‘production and a virtual monopoly was set up. The little fellows,

the owners of the wells, protested long and loud to the Federal
Trade Commission and the courts against the price-ﬁxing tactics
of Standard and Gulf. But all to no avail. The big companies
encouraged the little fellows to take all the chances in developing
new wells. Standard, Gulf and others then stepped in and dictated
the prices at which the small producer could sell. Proﬁts naturally
were fantastic. In one year Gulf made $4o,ooo,ooo.

“Oil is as necessary as blood in the battles of tomorrow,” said
Clemenceau, war premier of France. Mellon understood the
patriotic importance of oil in the next slaughter; for that reason

his Gulf Oil Corp. made use of the U. S. State Department to
gain vast reserves of oil in Colombia, to uphold, with other United
States interests, the gruesome dictatorship of Gomez in Venezuela,
and to change Mexican oil legislation.

A Independent oil producers of the southwestern United States
fought bitterly against the ﬂood of Mexican, Venezuelan and
Colombian oil which poured into the United States market, ruining
them. They claimed the imported oil was “foreign”; but to the
Mellons and the Rockefellers, the countries along the Caribbean
are just as American as Oklahoma or Texas. As’ a matter of
fact, from the towers of Wall Street, Colombia and Venezuela are

even more American, for there are bigger proﬁts in petroleum .

wrung from the forced labor of semi-colonial countries than in the
domestic product.

For that reason the little independents were never able to get a
tariff on oil comparable to the tariff that kept foreign aluminum
from competing with Mellon’s Aluminum Co. of America. They
failed to understand that tariffs, as well as other government
measures, are framed by the big industrial capitalists to suit their
private interests, regardless of the effect on petty competitors or
exploited workers.

Soon after the workers and peasants of Mexico declared a social
revolution in I910, the Mellons, along with the Dohenys, Sinclairs
and Rockefellers, found themselves in mortal combat with theories
of social ownership which declared Mexico’s natural resources
belonged to the people. For the next decade the oil interests
played cleverly among the politicians and generals of Mexico,
subsidizing this one, overthrowing that one, hiring guerilla bands
of their own. All the while, the U. S. State Department threatened
invasion to protect oil rights and twice American troops marched
into Mexico.

In the meantime, oil was discovered around Lake Maracaibo in
Venezuela, and there the Mellons followed Standard and Deterd-
ing’s Dutch-Shell, to exploit rich concessions. Venezuela was

different. There dictator Gomez, rivalled only by the recently V

overthrown Machado of Cuba, held power, thanks to his army
and his jails. He gladly signed concessions giving British and
American companies the ‘ right to Venezuela’s oil in return for

II

 

 
 

   

 

subsidies to maintain his own rule. The oil companies thereupon
threatened a boycott of Mexican oil. The Mexican government
made peace by I92 8. A branch of the National City Bank was
opened in Mexico City. Dwight Morrow, until then a partner in
Morgan & Co., was sent as ambassador, and Lindbergh, soon to
be his son-in-law, ﬂew down to cement good will between Wall
Street and the rising bourgeoisie of Mexico.

With Mexico safe for Mexican Gulf Oil and Venezuela pouring
liquid gold into Mellon tankers, the Pittsburgh bankers now turned
their attention to Colombia. Right next to the Venezuelan border
was the Barco concession, owned by a ﬁrm composed of H. L. Doh-
erty, the oil magnate, and J. P. Morgan & Co. The Mellons paid
Doherty $1 , 500,000 for his share of the concession, which the Co-
lombian government had just announced it was about to cancel.

If this cancelled concession was worth $1,500,000 to Mellon,
why did Doherty let go of it? There were two reasons. Millions
of dollars would be needed to lay pipe lines and develop wells
before the ﬁrst barrel of oil was pumped into a tanker. Standard
Oil already being busy in the Carare district of Colombia, the
Mellon company was the only one with enough free capital to
undertake the development. Even more important, however, were
the diplomatic angles involved. Tremendous pressure would be
needed to get the cancelled concession validated. Gulf Oil, whose
proprietor, Mellon, was Secretary of the Treasury in the Harding-
Coolidge Administration, could see that the proper pressure was
applied.

Colombia had distrusted the United States long before the
seizure of Panama in 1903 by Theodore Roosevelt who wished by
building a canal there to assure United States naval supremacy
in American waters. The United States government tried to buy

off Colombia’s hatred with a $2 5,000,000 payment in a deal which ‘

let Standard Oil into the Carare district. This deal involved a
scandal in Colombia comparable to the Teapot Dome exposé in
the United States and resulted in the resignation of the Colombian
president. The Colombian Congress thereupon passed legislation
which stated that petroleum resources were national property, and
that the Mellons must show documentary proof to their title in
the Barco concession.

 



 

  

The Mellon and Rockefeller ﬁrms » retaliated. They hired
Francis B. Loomis, former State Department ofﬁcial who had
helped Roosevelt in the Panama grab in 1903, to present their
case to the State Department and President -Coolidge. Secretary

. of State Kellogg ordered the United States minister in Bogota

 

to intercede for Mellon. Allen W. Dulles, another former State
Department ofﬁcial, joined Loomis in the ﬁght for the Mellon-
Morgan concession.

When Colombia refused to knuckle down, Herbert Hoover’s
Department of Commerce declared a practical embargo on loans
to the Caribbean country. That crippled Colombia and, in the
resulting industrial paralysis, discontent increased. At this junc-
ture the presidential election was held, and the Colombian minister
to Washington, Olaya, a man thoroughly imbued with the Wall
Street point of view, campaigned for the presidency. He was
elected by I2 I ,ooo, a thumping majority in a country where
workers and peasants have no vote.

President Olaya immediately invited National City Co. (Na-
tional City Bank afﬁliate) to send a representative to Colombia,
and he himself visited Wall Street and Washington where he talked
with the bankers and with Secretary Mellon. Mellon, of course,
later denied that he had mentioned his concession when he talked
with Olaya.

As a matter of fact, Olaya shortly after the interview got a
$20,000,000 credit from the National City Co. and returned to
Bogota to force Mellon’s concession through Congress. With him
went a Princeton University professor and the oil law expert who
helped Ambassador Morrow clean up the Mexican oil tangle. As
soon as the Mellon oil law was passed by the Colombian Congress
and signed by Olaya, the National City Co. released the last
$4,000,000 of the loan.

All this came out in testimony before a U. S. Senate committee
investigating the ﬂotation of foreign loans. Witnesses revealed
that excited cables ﬂew back and forth between the State Depart-
ment and Bogota while Mellon’s concession was hanging ﬁre and
that Secretary of State Stimson was concerned in helping with
the deal.

The upshot of this piece of dollar diplomacy was that the

13

 

  

Mellons were conﬁrmed in ownership of oil lands valued by a
U. S. State Department ofﬁcial at from $350,000,000 to
$2,000,000,000, and all for the triﬂing price of $1,500,000 plus
the pressure of the United States government.

International diplomacy was again called into use‘ when the
Mellons shouldered their way into Iraq oil. When Standard Oil
learned that the British oil companies had staked out the rich Mosul
ﬁeld in Iraq as their own, thanks to a British mandate from the
League of Nations, it indignantly protested to the State Department
that the principle of the “open door” for all capitalists was being
violated. It was arranged ﬁnally that Standard Oil was to have
one-fourth interest in the Turkish Petroleum Co.

When Gulf Oil executives heard that, they boiled over with
indignation. They demanded that the State‘ Department pry the
door open even wider so they could get in. Accordingly, the
Near East Development Corp. was formed by the Standard Oil

companies and Gulf, and the Mellons were given one—ﬁfth interest.

Proﬁts in Explosives

War brought another rich treasure to the Mellons. That was ‘

the Koppers Coke Co. , _

Dr. Heinrich Koppers was a German scientist who had come to
America before the World War to introduce a type of coke oven
which made use of the valuable gases which the old-fashioned bee-
hive coke ovens wasted when converting coal into coke. When
war broke out in I914, Mellon saw that explosives meant millions,
and these explosives were made out of those very gases that Dr.
Koppers saved in his by-product coke ovens. So he bought out
Dr. Koppers’ patents and business giving him $300,000 worth of
shares in the new company and a salary of $10,000 a year.
Mellon proceeded to sign fat contracts with agents of the Allied
nations.

When the United States entered the war in 1917, the “alien
property” law was passed. The law declared that all German and
Austrian property, including patents, in‘ the United States, was
to be conﬁscated.

Mellon’s Koppers Coke Co. immediately informed the govern-

I4

 

ment that one-ﬁfth of its stock was owned by Dr. Koppers, a
German citizen. Accordingly, the stock was conﬁscated and then
offered for sale at auction in 1918. The Mellon company bought
Dr. Koppers’ share for a mere $302,500. Proﬁts for the ﬁrst six
months of 1918 alone easily exceeded what the Mellons paid for
Dr. Koppers’ one-ﬁfth share in a $15,000,000 company.

The Koppers company hastily erected by-product gas plants
throughout the country during the war, to cash in on the high
prices paid for ammunition. The government designated the
Koppers units as “war order” plants whose products were essential
to the manufacture of explosives. After the war was over, the
Mellon company continued building these gas plants, and became
a big factor in the so—called public utilities companies which sell
gas to industrial and to domestic consumers. Koppers Gas & Coke
Co. was organized and grew rapidly until in 1931 its assets were
$177,ooo,ooo. To control big gas properties in New England, the
Mellons then organized Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates, a
$2o3,ooo,ooo ﬁrm. In 1931 this company alone had proﬁts of
5135;775:000-

Through their control of valuable St. Lawrence River power
for use in their aluminum plant at Massena, New York, the
Mellons acquired 21% ownership in the Morgan-Niagara Hudson
Corp., a vast holding company which controlled light and power
throughout New York State. They became powerful in the United
Light & Railways Co., a $498,ooo,ooo concern; in United Light
& Power Co., a $57 5,ooo,ooo concern; and in U. S. Electric Power
Corp., whose assets are $1,2 57,ooo,ooo.

Low Taxes for the Rich

Banker Mellon’s rise to command of the U. S. Treasury was
logical. What more reasonable than that one of the nation’s
greatest money masters should take charge of the nation’s ﬁnances?
A variety of reasons dictated the choice of Mellon as Secretary in
I92 I. First, the war had been terribly expensive, and the question
came up as to who should pay for it. For the Republican Party
there was only one answer. Those who had coined millions out
of the war must not be called upon to pay for it. What better

15



 

   

assurance was there that taxes would be eased on the wealthy
than to have the richest banker in the key tax position?

Second, the Republican Party had incurred a tremendous deﬁcit
in the I920 campaign and somebody had to pay for that. Andrew
Mellon made the biggest contribution, reported by the‘ New York
Times as $1, 5oo,ooo. He must be rewarded.

Mellon was glad enough to change from Pittsburgh to Wash-
ington. His corporations gathered dividends as the earth soaks
up rain; the process was nearly automatic. Although he was on
the top rung of the millionaire ladder, hardly anyone outside Pitts-
burgh had ever heard his name. He felt the need for public
acclaim in keeping with his position. Further, no family ties
bound him. His two children were away in private school and he
had divorced his wife back in I9I2.

That divorce showed Mellon’s power. Mrs. Mellon came from
a wealthy Irish brewer’s family, liked gaiety, hated the smoke and
grime and coldness of Pittsburgh and*her husband’s concentration
on ﬁnancial affairs. She obtained a legal separation, but Mellon
refused to permit herto have their children part of the year. She
deﬁed him by moving back to the Mellon house in Pittsburgh.
Thereupon he sued for divorce. The Pittsburgh newspapers re-
fused to publish Mrs. Mellon’s statements defending herself against
his charges, and even the telegraph agencies helped to keep any
news of the sensational divorce from getting out of the city.

Mrs. Mellon found a parallel between her position and that of
thousands of foreign-born workers who toiled in Mellon mills.
“It crept over me,” she wrote, “that perhaps I, too, a foreigner
like his Huns and Slavs, had been weighed coldly, dispassionately,
on the scales of demand and supply and as a wife ranked merely
as a commodity in the great plan of this master ﬁnancier’s life-
work. The babies were there; even the male heir was there.
Was the wife to be laid off like other hired help when the steel
mills shut down?”

Mellon wanted no publicity on his divorce. Accordingly Boss
Penrose had a law passed quietly in the Pennsylvania legislature
providing for secret divorce hearings. Then the banker discovered
he wanted testimony taken in Europe. This too was arranged
by Penrose.

I6

 

  

Nevertheless news leaked out and was published in certain
eastern newspapers. Mrs. Mellon demanded a jury trial and the
court granted it. Then Mellon was all for settling. Grounds for
divorce were changed to simple desertion and the decree was
granted in I912.

The whole incident illustrated Mellon’s inﬂuence on Pennsyl-
vania politics in obtaining passage of special laws to suit his needs,
in hushing publicity and controlling courthouse ofﬁcials. Boss
Penrose naturally was anxious to please the powerful Pittsburgher;
Mellon was a heavy contributor to Republican Party funds. These
gifts had» run as high as $150,000 at a throw. Penrose and other
bosses of Pennsylvania, then as now, got their support from
Mellon, General Atterbury of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Joseph
Grundy of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Assn., and similar big
employing interests. No wonder all efforts to obtain minimum
wage, child labor, and old, age pension legislation invariably failed
in the legislature!

In Pittsburgh, Mellon worked hand in glove with the Magee-
Flinn Republican political machine and its successors, including
the Coyne machine. Vice, poverty and corruption ﬂourish, mak-
ing the name of Pittsburgh pre-eminent in that regard among

‘ American cities. The big employers care not at all about that.

Their workers live in miserable houses and shacks in the steel and
coal towns surrounding the city, work long hours, or not at all,
and get barely enough to hold body and soul together.

Senator Penrose and Senator Knox, faithful servants of the
steel and coal interests and political messenger boys for the Frick-
Mellon interests, both saw to it that their friend Andrew Mellon
was made Secretary of the Treasury. Mellon’s ﬁrst job in Wash-
ington was to see that the excess proﬁts tax on the fat earnings
of the big corporations was done away with, and to reduce income
taxes in the “higher brackets,” that is, upon the very rich. Be-
sides sparing the rich the burden of keeping up their government
this also avoided leaving extra money‘ in the Treasury for the
veterans’ bonus, for federal unemployment insurance or any other
social legislation.

Money which might have gone into social insurance funds was
dumped into the stock market, into further expansion of industrial

17

 

  

plants and into foreign loans. Building more factories when those
already built were not being used to capacity hastened the in-
evitable crash of 1929, and the foreign loans brought nearer the
day of United States participation in the next imperialist war.

Under the Mellon regime the Bureau of Internal Revenue made -

tremendous refunds to great corporations and wealthy persons.
These refunds were returns to them of taxes on war—time proﬁts
years after the war ended. Refunds to the capitalist class totalled
close to $3,0o0,oo0,00o.* U. S. Steel alone received $96,384,000.
Mellon served not merely himself but his class, and in serving
his class served himself. He made refunds to his own corporations
totalling about $14,500,000. His own personal refund amounted
to $405,000.

Mellon himself, as the result of these favors to fellow-mi1lion-
aires, and corporations, became the idol of the Big Business press.
He was regarded as more powerful by far than President Coolidge,
and as the Greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander
Hamilton! He was undoubtedly the power behind the throne in
Washington from 1921 to I929.

As beﬁtted such a power in ﬁnance and government, Mellon
had his daughter married to the son of a reactionary Maryland
Senator in a million-dollar wedding that was the talk of society,
and recalled those feudal rites in Pittsburgh where Mellon girls
were married to the sons of steel magnates in made-to-order
medieval castles. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were lavished
on these affairs, even though thousands of Mellon miners might,
at the time, be living on starvation rations while striking against
Pittsburgh Coal Co. On the very day Sarah Cordelia Mellon was
married, Mellon coal and iron police were evicting miners from
their homes.

The Mellons did not believe much in charity and gave little.
One exception was the $3,000,000 given to build the East Liberty
Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, known locally as the “Mellon
ﬁre escape.” Millions were invested in the Mellon Institute, a
research laboratory for manufacturers and for Mellon corporations.
The Mellons and allied magnates controlled the board of the

No. 30.

I8

 

University of Pittsburgh, which became notorious for ﬁring pro-
fessors and radical students and suppressing freedom of thought
on the campus.

The Mellons continue to invest heavily in the Republican Party.
They gave and lent $250,000 in the notorious 1926 Republican
primary in Pennsylvania. Mellon defended his gifts on the ground
that they were the same as gifts to the church. Each vote for
the Mellon candidate for U. S. Senator in Pittsburgh cost $4.14.
The Mellons also controlled the Democratic Party in Pittsburgh,
through alliance with its chiefs, a fact that became doubly im-
portant after the Democratic victory in I9 32.

M ellon’s Workers

Mellon is a staunch believer in long hours and low wages for
his workers. The state sweatshop investigation in Pennsylvania
in 1933, as we have noted, revealed that his aluminum factories
paid 18 cents an hour to women. His aluminum plants worked
the 11%-hour night shift even in 1933.

Strikes periodically convulsed his spy-ridden factories and mills.
In 1913 his aluminum workers in New Kensington revolted, and
wives of strikers used blacksnake whips to beat off strikebreakers.
State police were rushed to the plant to break up meetings and
picket lines. After six weeks, the workers were forced back under
promise of arbitration.

In 1915, at Massena, New York, his aluminum workers struck,
took possession of the aluminum plant and threw up a barricade
in front of the main gate. Governor Whitman (Republican) of
New York, sent in companies of militia which stormed the barri-
cades and ﬁnally drove the workers out in a series of bloody
encounters. Strikers’ homes were raided and a strike leader later
died of wounds inﬂicted by guardsmen. A hundred workers were
jailed. The strike was soon settled with the company promising
slight wage increases and correction of grievances over rents.

Again in 1916 the Aluminum workers in New Kensington struck,
demanding the 8-hour day and recognition of A. F. of L. unions,
but were defeated when the company shifted its war orders to
other plants. The workers were forced back after three months.

COMPOSED AND PRETED BY UNION LABOR

 

   
 

In the Standard Steel Car Works at Butler, Pa., in 1919, state
troopers beat back workers who joined the great steel strike. The
troopers’ horses were trained to kick in the doors of workers’
homes and to enter, scattering terror among wives and children
of the strikers. i

In Pittsburgh Coal, however, the Mellon labor policy came to
highest fruition. R. B. Mellon, once chairman of the company’s
board, practically admitted before a Senate committee that “you
can’t run coal mines without machine guns.” Pittsburgh Coal,
Charley Schwab’s Bethlehem Mines Corp., and Rockefe1ler’s Con-
solidation mines, took the lead in 192 5 in breaking a contract
with the United Mine Workers and smashing that union. Miners
were evicted from the company towns in which they had been
forced to live; coal and iron police, licensed by the state and paid
by the coal and steel companies, terrorized strikers. Tear gas and
machine guns helped the operators. When miners joined the
National Miners Union in 1931 and conducted another great
strike, Pittsburgh Coal Co. exceeded its previous efforts. Dozens
of miners were shot, hundreds were gassed, others were sent to
prison for long terms, their families evicted and starved. But a
Pittsburgh Coal superintendent and a bunch of company guards
at Arnold, Pa., who shot and killed John Philipovich, a strike
sympathizer, were convicted of mere manslaughter and paroled.
Two Pittsburgh Coal guards who tortured Mike Barkoski to death
in their police barracks were given light sentences.

Company towns are an integral part of the Mellon apparatus of
oppression. Andrew Mellon’s partner, Henry Clay Frick, found
the company store convenient in the hard times of the 187o’s, for
paying his miners and coke workers when he was short of cash.
He gave them scrip redeemable at the company store, and found
the practice so proﬁtable that it was continued and adopted by
other coal companies. Workers were forced to trade there, and
high prices kept them in debt to the company. Popular outcry
against these “pluck me” stores became so vehement that the
Pennsylvania legislature abolished them. Thereupon the coal and
steel companies organized dummy ﬁrms‘ to operate them, and they
ﬂourish under this thin disguise to this day.

In the company town the company owns not only the stores, but

20

 

 

all the drab, monotonous shacks, the school, the church and
everything else. The company is also the “law.” It hires and
pays the private police who patrol the streets and roads, help
keep organizers out, spy on militant workers, and try to disrupt
their organizations.

The East St. Louis race riots of 1917 were laid at the door of
the Aluminum Co. and other employers by a Congressional in-
vestigating committee. Aluminum Ore Co., ﬁghting its low—paid
white workers then on strike, imported hundreds of Negroes from
the lower Mississippi valley. So many were brought in that there
were jobs for only part of them. Race hatreds were fanned. In
the terrible riots that followed at least 25 Negroes, men and
women, were burned to death, shot, drowned, hanged and their
homes burned. The police and militia refused to interfere.

In 193 3, the Aluminum Co. signed a code stipulating 30 cents
an hour as the minimum wage in the industry. But even this
hunger wage was too much to suit the Mellon company, and
within a few weeks it was paying hundreds of its women workers
at New Kensington, Pa., 2 5 cents an hour, in ﬂat deﬁance of its
own code. The workers at the New Kensington plant made their
opposition felt by an overwhelming vote against the company union
which was to be set up on the basis of the code.

Mellon’s Pittsburgh Coal Co. signed a N.R.A. code and a working
agreement with John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers which
took away from the miners, on strike at the time, the right to
strike. Under this agreement between Pittsburgh Coal and Lewis,
the checkoff was forced on the miners, to be paid into the district
ofﬁce instead of to local unions, the previous practice. In this
way the local unions were robbed of their ﬁnancial autonomy.

The Panic Helps Mellon

During the 11 years he held the ofﬁce of Secretary of the
Treasury, Andrew Mellon’s private fortune and that of his family,
leaped from the hundreds of millions to over a billion. The
policies he sponsored—1ow taxation of the wealthy, easy money
for speculators, unchallenged sway by the big corporations-
padded his own fortune and those of his fellow-millionaires.

21

  
  

After the economic crash of 1929, his usefulness to the Re-
publican Party declined. During the years of stock market pros-
perity he had been praised extravagantly as the author of good
times; when stocks crashed, factories closed and millions roamed
the streets looking for work, he was blamed. Veterans whose
demand for a bonus he defeated; workers who knew his anti-labor
policies had been responsible for low wages during “prosperity”
and for lack of adequate relief and unemployment insurance during
the crisis; and farmers who had been “deﬂated” since I921 under
his pro-corporation program, joined hands to denounce him.
President Hoover thereupon sent Mellon as Ambassador to Great
Britain. This, of course, meant no change in U. S. Treasury
policy as millionaire Ogden Mills out-Melloned Mellon in his
favors to his class.

Mellon used the crisis of 1929, as he had those of 1893 and
1907, and as his father had used the panic of 1873, to “clean up.”
His corporations, if necessary, paid interest and dividends out of
vast surplus funds which had been piled up in good times. They
bought up small companies in distress for a song. Mellon acquired
numerous banks in western Pennsylvania when they became in-
solvent. He could have saved these banks and the workers money
deposited in them. Instead he waited till they went on the rocks

I and then bought them up.

His Union Trust Co., keystone of his ﬁnancial structure, con-
tinued to pay 200% annual dividends. An analysis of his family’s
income showed hardly any decline during years which saw at
least I 5,000,000 unemployed. In 1929 the Mellons received about
$35,000,000 in dividends alone. In 1930, their estimated income
went up to $38,000,000 and even in the panicky year 1931 the
ﬁgure declined only to about $33,000,000. (These ﬁgures are based
on our estimate of Mellon share of control or ownership of particular
companies.)

Despite this personal prosperity, however, his companies ruth-
lessly slashed wages and working forces. Some of his aluminum
workers, by I9 3 3, were working for as little as 18 cents an hour.
Thousands were laid off by Gulf Oil. No unemployment insurance
protected them. In 1931 Mellon and his brother gave a grudging
$300,000 to Pittsburgh charity, less than 1% of their income for

the year. Later they were obliged to contribute $750,000 more.
But that was just a fraction of the sum that Andrew Mellon
spent in that year for art treasures alone! From Union Trust in
1931 his family drew dividends of more than $2,400,000, and
other banks yielded him a million more.

President Roosevelt, seeking desperately to save the capitalist
system from collapse, announced the “New Deal” in 1933, and
instituted the National Recovery Act. Mellon continued to ﬁght
unionism, higher wages, and .shorter hours with all the forces at
his command. ‘

Mellon——A Class Symbol

Mellon is the supreme expression of predatory, acquisitive capi-
talism. In this system of exploitation and individual acquisition,
he did his best to search out, control, acquire and hold on to
everything he saw that looked as if a proﬁt could be made out
of it. The more he, and all capitalists, acquired, the deeper in
misery became the masses.

Mellon did not create this wealth, which he today controls. He
sought only to gain control over wealth, that he might intercept
the proﬁts. And he used these proﬁts to gain further control—the
process being almost endless. But the source of this wealth and
these proﬁts remained as always——the exploitation of the resources
of the country and the labor of the masses.

It is against this system of capitalism—mass exploitation for
individual gain—that the workers ﬁght. It is capitalism that pro-
duced Mellon, just as it produced the wretchedness of workers’
lives, the horrors of our civilization and the army of half-starved
unemployed.

Capitalism yesterday produced its great fortunes, today produces
its Mellons and Rockefellers and Morgans, and tomorrow another
set. Under capitalism all wealth becomes concentrated. It is for
a new order of society, granting no place to exploiters, as in the
Soviet Union, that we ﬁght. The workers, creators of this wealth,
will then have its use.

HOW MELLON GOT RICH

BY HARVEY O’CoNNoR

The M ellon Fortune

Towering among the ﬁnancial giants is the Mellon family with
its billion-dollar hoard, probably the largest in America. The
Pittsburgh titans of ﬁnance capital, are directly interested in cor-
porations with assets of $1o,5co,ooo,ooo. ’

Although he is usually described as king of aluminum, Andrew
Mellon, former Secretary of the Treasury, raked in his billion from
an amazing variety of industries. In this the Mellons differ from
the Fords and their auto fortune, the duPonts and their chemical
millions, the Rockefellers and their oil empire. For the Mellons
draw tribute from real estate, banking, steel, railway equipment,
oil, coal and its myriad by-products, aluminum, utilities. Workers
in almost every industry you can name are being exploited to
enhance the ﬁnancial power of the Mellons.

Count off the major enterprises of Mellon and you will include
most of the basic industries. His hundred Pittsburgh Coal Co. and
Koppers Coal Co. mines stretch all the way from western Penn-
sylvania through feudal West Virginia into Kentucky. He prob-
ably draws more interest and dividends from the labor of steel
workers than any other person in America. His family has
important interests in Pittsburgh Steel, Crucible Steel, and Beth-
lehem Steel and a sizeable block in U. S. Steel.

Coke links coal and steel. It is the pure fuel left when gases
have been driven out of coal, and it is used to smelt iron ore.
Through his Koppers Co., Mellon is the most important commercial
coke producer in the United States and Canada. The by-products
derived from coal constitute the base for explosives and all war
gases. The Mellons hold key positions in the war industries
through steel, coal, and by-products of coal gas and petroleum.

Bethlehem Steel cashes in handsomely by the sale of armor plate
for battleships built in .Bethlehem’s own yards.

The Mellons sell the gas from their Koppers coke ovens to
domestic consumers in scores of cities. V They have become major
owners of so-called public utility systems. Gigantic holding com-
panies in which they have an interest include Eastern Gas & Fuel
Associates in Boston, Plymouth and New Haven; United Light
and Power, which sells gas and electricity in a thousand communi-
ties; U. S. Electric Power Corp., and others. They are big
stockholders in the Philadelphia Co., the monopoly which controls
all the gas, electricity and street car services in their home city,
Pittsburgh. Their Brooklyn Union and Brooklyn Borough Gas
companies “soak the poor” in Brooklyn. They make a minimum
charge of $1 a month, although most working class families actually
never consume a dollar’s worth of gas in any month.

Most famous of all Mellon’s corporations is Aluminum Company
of America, which, through its control of raw materials and
patents, holds a 100 per cent monopoly on the manufacture of
this extremely useful light—weight metal. Aluminum is one-third
the weight of steel and just as strong when properly alloyed.
Aluminum Co. of America, ever since its organization way back
in the 8o’s, has enjoyed the express protection of the United States
government through patents, tariffs and failure of government de-
partments to prosecute it under the anti-trust law. Its tremendous
proﬁts have exceeded $20,000,000 in one year. The sweatshop
inquiry in Pennsylvania in 193 3 found that Aluminum was ﬁring
men, earning $4 and $5 a day, from some departments, and hiring
women to do their work at 18 cents an hour.

Biggest of all Mellon companies is Gulf Oil Corp. with gross
assets of $743,000,000, and exceeding those of the Ford Motor Co.,
whose owner has been considered the second richest man in the
country. Gulf, like Aluminum, also proﬁts from monopoly for it
has quiet price-ﬁxing agreements with Standard Oil and other big
oil companies.

The full list of Mellon companies ﬁlls many pages. They are
heavy stockholders in the Pullman sleeping car monopoly, Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass, American Tar Products, and National Lumber
& Creosoting.

The Mellons are the perfect example of the fusion of industrial
and ﬁnance capital. Their $2 5o,ooo,ooo Union Trust Co. in
Pittsburgh has the highest cash dividend rate in the banking world:
zoo per cent. Their $2 5o,ooo,ooo Mellon National Bank ﬁnances
industries far and near. Another $2 5o,ooo,ooo is represented in a
chain of banks which covers western Pennsylvania. The Mellons
maintain close relations with the Morgan and Rockefeller banking

interests in Wall Street, and have considerable holdings in other '

corporations dominated by one or both of these groups.

Judge Thomas Mellon

Andrew Mellon was born rich. His father laid the foundation
of the family fortune in Pittsburgh as a corporation lawyer and
money-lender. As soon as he was out of law school, Thomas
Mellon began buying mechanics’ liens, making loans on notes.
Then he went into real estate. Through marriage he acquired
control of East Liberty, most important of Pittsburgh suburbs, and
made millions as the city grew, through mere ownership of land
that other people had to have to build homes. He became the
trusted conﬁdential attorney of corporations andlater he organized
corporations of his own. After serving ten years as judge, he
opened the T. Mellon & Sons bank in 1871. Here young Andrew
learned the secrets of using money to make money.

Old Thomas Mellon was the perfect embodiment of the small
competitive capitalist and money lender of the middle nineteenth
century, before the age of imperialism. He was a studious old
skinﬂint. More far-sighted than many, he foresaw the inevitable
conﬂict between the classes. “The employees and their families in
the larger manufacturing and mining establishments,” he wrote in
188 5, “are often designated each by his number and live in num-
bered tenements, and are all subjected to the same routine, and
treated alike; too much like the soldiers of an army or inmates of
a prison. The opportunity to work up and out and better their
condition is rendered so remote as to appear to them hopeless.”

But when the “hopeless” workers rebelled, Judge Mellon was for
drastic action. “The vicious classes,” he wrote, “seem to be
greatly on the increase or at least show more boldness than ever

.°\ ‘.

before‘. It indicates a demoralized condition of public sentiment,
which may require blood to purify.” Two years later the Hay-
market anarchists were hanged in Chicago.*

Judge Mellon hated Karl Marx and studied Herbert Spencer to
ﬁnd arguments against Marx’s statement that ‘labor is the author
of all wealth. He believed in religion, not so much for himself as
to assure the stability of the capitalist system.

Aside from amassing more millions, Judge Mellon’s chief satis-
faction in life was to see his sons develop into “smart business
men.” - Very smart they were. The older brothers kept on sub-
dividing real estate and selling it at a handsome proﬁt. Then
their lumber ﬁrm sold building materials for houses to be built on
the lots. Their street car companies carried people back and forth
from Pittsburgh to East Liberty.

When Judge Mellon retired, it was Andrew who took charge
of the money-making end of his fortune, that of T. Mellon & Sons
bank, already the largest in Pittsburgh. He early formed a close
alliance with Henry Clay Frick, the coke king, whom Judge Mellon

had helped by loans to acquire control of Fayette County, source ,

of much of the country’s ﬁnest coking coal. From Frick, Andrew
Mellon learned the technique of open shoppery. Frick engaged in
bloody wars with his coke workers until in 1889-90 by starvation
and bullets, he stamped out their union. Carnegie took him into
his steel corporation as general manager, and in 1892 he smashed
the steel workers’ union at Homestead and established industrial
tyranny in the steel industry that was unchallenged until 1919,
when William Z. Foster led the great steel strike.'{'

Frick sat on the board of Union Trust, Mellon’s new bank, along
with representatives of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the big
corporations of the Pittsburgh district. The two men made millions
speculating in downtown real estate. In one deal Mellon made as
much as $200,000, although he added not a penny to the real worth
of the property.

War——Mellon’s Ally

War has been the Mellons’ best ally. The peace-time stride of
their fortune then quickens into the double march. The Mexican
War started Pittsburgh off, and with it old Judge Mellon, chieﬂy

through his transactions in real estate, laid the foundations for his

fortune. The Civil War placed him in the millionaire class. . The
Spanish-American War, with its fat contracts for guns and ammuni-
tion, made his son Andrew a peer of Wall Street bankers and the
lord of Pittsburgh, the seat of war industries.

The Mellons did not believe in ﬁghting during the war. There
was no money in that. Old Judge Mellon, instructing his sons
during the Civil War, wrote: “It is only greenhoms who enlist.
You can learn nothing useful in the army. . . . In time you will
come to understand and believe that a man may be a patriot
without risking his own life or sacriﬁcing his health. There are
plenty of other lives less valuable or others ready to serve for the
love of serving.”

The conquest of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, the
coming to age of imperialistic America, stuffed the Mellon banks
to bursting with the proﬁts wrung from the workers in Pittsburgh’s
glowing mills. Armed with the proﬁts of war, promoters began
forming whole industries into gigantic trusts. Mellon worked
feverishly in Pittsburgh. He helped form two coal combines in
19oo-or from which emerged Pittsburgh Coal Co., at that time a
monopoly in western Pennsylvania coal mining. Me1lon’s banks
sold their watered stocks to the public and then obtained mortgages
on every scrap of the‘ coal combine’s property in return for ﬂoat-
ing bond issues. Crucible Steel and a score of corporations were
products of Mellon ﬁnancing in this era. Nearly every big enter-
prise in Pittsburgh was ﬁnanced by the Mellons in return for
mortgages which covered all their property and gave them the
right to foreclose in case they didn’t pay.

About this time Andrew Carnegie fell out with his general
manager, Frick, over the division of the tremendous wartime
proﬁts which ﬂowed into Carnegie Steel Co.’s treasury—
$40,000,000 in the year I900. Frick was ﬁred. In revenge he
and Mellon formed Union Steel Co. and threatened to build mills

s

  

rod and wire mill at Donora, Pa. Eventually the new Union
Steel Co., Mellon and Frick threatened, would add blast and
open hearth furnaces to offer thorough-going competition to
Carnegie’s mills. T

Carnegie capitulated before this threat and settled with Frick
to the tune of $31,000,000. The bluff had worked so well for
F rick and Mellon that Carnegie himself used the same tactics in
forcing J. P. Morgan to pay a fancy price for Carnegie’s steel
mills when the New York promoter organized U. S. Steel.

Mellon watched the success of these tricks as used by Frick
and Carnegie, and decided to take a hand at the game himself.
So he announced that his Union Steel Co. would build a rail mill
that would put the U. S. Steel Corp.’s rail mill at Braddock, Pa.,
out of business. Further, he would construct a railroad from
Pittsburgh to Lake Erie to haul his iron ore cheaply. He bought
out the Sharon Steel Co., a big independent, and was in position
in 1902 to compete with the steel trust in nearly every branch of
steel making.

The U. S. Steel «Corp., thoroughly frightened, bought Mellon’s
company for $7 5,ooo,ooo. Mellon had put only a few million into
Union Steel. An example of his tremendous proﬁt from this deal
was an ore mine for which he had paid $150,000 and which he
sold to U. S. Steel for $4,000,000.

It was a handsome piece of poker-playing that brought perhaps
$2o,ooo,ooo into the Mellon pockets.

Industrial Capitalist

Up to the Spanish-American War, Andrew Mellon had been
primarily a banker and real estate promoter. Then he began to
blossom out as a ﬁrst rate industrial capitalist. Back in 1888 the
owner of patents for reﬁning aluminum in electric furnaces sold a
share in their Pittsburgh Reduction Co. to the Mellons in return
for $250,000 to set up a mill at New Kensington, Pa. This
company controlled by the Mellons has grown into properties
valued at $3oo,ooo,ooo, known as Aluminum Co. of America and
its Canadian afﬁliate, Aluminium, Ltd.

rivalling Carnegie’s. A company town was built around the new .

 

  

Monopoly is the essence of Aluminum’s success. The govern-
ment protected Mellon’s monopoly rights through patents until
1909. From the ﬁrst, subservient U. S. Senators saw to it that
Mellon’s company had a high tariff to keep out foreign aluminum.
It has ranged from 2 to 7 cents a pound and is now 4 cents. The
Mellon company has understandings with the European aluminum
companies regarding production and prices. These agreements
also provide that the Mellons are to be sole sellers of aluminum
to the United States government, while the German, French and
British companies are guaranteed no competition in selling
aluminum, made into a multitude of war uses, to their respective
governments.

Mellon’s monopoly ran smack up into the opposition of power-
ful industrial interests——particu1arly automobile and airplane in-
terests—who wanted to buy the lightweight metal cheap. They
succeeded in IQI2 in getting the U. S. Department of Justice to
ﬁle suit against Aluminum Co. of America. The court ordered
Aluminum C0. not to monopolize bauxite, the ore from which
aluminum is reﬁned, not to delay shipments, or ship defective
material to companies which competed with Aluminum’s sub-
sidiaries in fabricating the raw metal into ﬁnished products.

How utterly useless the court order was, came to light in 1924
when the Federal Trade Commission found that Aluminum was
not only continuing its price-ﬁxing and its discrimination against
competitors in fabricating aluminum, but had gained a 100%
monopoly over the mining of bauxite and the reﬁning of raw
aluminum.

The full extent of this monopoly was brought out in court
when George D. Haskell, a Springﬁeld, Mass., manufacturer, sued
for $15,000,000 damages for conspiracy in restraint of trade. The
jury awarded him an $8,000,000 verdict, but the court of appeals,
happily for Mellon, reversed the verdict. Haskell had formed
an aluminum company with James B. Duke, the Carolina tobacco
magnate who had cheap water power in Quebec. The Mellon
company bought out Duke for $15,000,000. Testimony also re-
vealed that the Mellons had forced the Canadian government to
get bauxite concessions in British Guiana for them, in return for
furnishing aluminum during the war.
