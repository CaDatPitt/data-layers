TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAVEN :

Monday night Richard Nixon announced the mining of Haiphong

Harbor and all other North Vietnamese ports. This move not only
continues the disastrous policy of the United States in Vietnam
but brings us to the brink of nuclear war as well. Nixon believes
he can stop the NLF by threatening Moscow. We know that this is
not only stupid but dangerous.

Nixon has asked for the unified support of the American peo-
ple on behalf of this new escalation. It is urgent for us to show

in a dramatic way our outrage at this naked aggression.

Therefore, on Friday morning people will block traffic in down-
town New Haven, in an effort to show that business as usual will
not be permitted to continue in New Haven while Nixon's insanity

destroys the people of Vietnam and threatens the world.

Here's how to act:

Small groups of 5 to 15 people should organize among
themselves and pick busy intersections in the downtown area.
Go directly there Friday morning at 7:45 and block traffic.
For suggestions on targets come to 425 College St. (2nd floor)
Others should assemble at the corner of Temple and Church Sts.
(at the end of the New Haven Green). we will move out from

there. For further information call 776-7453.

To 5 - ~ , .
