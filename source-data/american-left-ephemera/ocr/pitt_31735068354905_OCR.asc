‘ production, to production of war goods.
 Jobs are down, hours of work are down,
_~V”wages are down, taxes are up.

“In .1951, 3,300 brassworkers lost
their jobs, a drop of 14% in total em-

Junk the freeze - now! .
‘ INE-MILL’S top "wage policy,-making’ bodies convene in Denver
this week to determine this union's bargaining demands for 1952.

There's no doubt that the 150 delegates, coming from all sections
of our industry, will reach agreement on a sizable wage demand.

_ , But in the back of every delegate’s mind, as he considers the urg- J

ent need for such sizable wage
aboutthe wage freeze?” ,_ .

THAT QUESTION is made more urgent by the hearings now in
progress in committees of both the Senate and House on. extension of
the so-called Defense Production Act. This is the
the built-in wage freeze. _

The Defense Production‘ Act has been a phony and a fraud from
the beginning. . , ' . , 

When Congress first passed it, we were told it would “stabilize’_'
prices. Yet inthe 20 ‘months since the Korean war began, prices have
gone up 11 per -cent even if you can swallow the extremely distorted
figures of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.‘ They're up 20 per cent if

increases, willbe the question: “How

you accept the UE index, which takes much more careful account of , V
the items which go into the living expenses of the ordinary worker

and his family. _ ' 4 . . ,
As matters stand today, some 10 "to 14 million workers are em-

ployed in industries where 'prices- have been decontrolled. Congress

apparently intends to extend the area of decontrol to still more indus-

tries. And the laughable Office of Price Stabilizationsays it has an-_ 

other list of articles from which it plans to remove controls shortly. *
Price _“control” is a vicious fraud. \ A
BUT CONTROLS on wages are being enforced rigidly and exactly.

Wages have “not merely been stabilized; they have been frozen. As the

backlog of wage cases before the WSB mounts beyond the 18,000 point,

more and more millions of workers are seeing»~their"wages frozen by
sheer do-nothingﬂness. d V " V i ‘ " '
y In theory, wage control‘ and price control are tied together like

Siamese twins in the Defense Production Act.« Supposedly one can’t be

enforced unless the other is also.
Yet Workers in every industry, who see no evidence ‘that price
controls are working anywhere, find that their Wages are frozen solid.
There is] only one answer to this; junkthe wage freeze !. And -while

served, only: to enrich the wealthy

 

law which carries .

, MMSW Washington Representative
.1‘ 0, IN SPITE of protests and disapproval

 

.from practically all sections of or-

- ganized’ labor, Senator Humphrey

seems prepared to move on his hear-7

 ings on “Communism in trade un-

. ions.”

K Humphrey poses as a friend of la-
bor. This is the basis on which he feels

 .; he must conduct the hearings-—it.o pro-

I tect labor from ,’itself. But 1let’s look -

at" the» operation of his committee.
On January 18th, 1951, a group of
'. 7Republi‘cans introduced a bill—S551,
I "fcalling for an enactment of a fair ~em-
fployment practices Act. Several months
.later, that is in June, both. the" De-
partment of. Budget and the Depart-
_ A 1, ment of Labor okayed this bill as ac-
 ,ceptable from their point of view.
I ' 0 Obviously," not to‘be outdone, Hum-
A, phr'e-y,‘ as a Democrat, and on behalf

of several other Democratic Senators, 5

on August 23rd introduced a similar
bi1l—S732. The bill was again sent to
Sthe Department of the Budget and to
the Labor Department and received
the same approval. ‘

However, eight months later no_ ac-

tion has been taken nor have hearings
been scheduled. -

"But there are no headlines on FEPC _.

and a great deal of opposition in the
Senate. Senator Humphrey knows how

‘ IT ALMOST GOT by in the shuffle
but Business Week of February 9th,
‘1952 had a real gem. Let us quote

_ somewhat from their observations on

A world peace. ' ' j ~

Business Week says, “If jitters were
medals we’d all have enough; Never in

the last year and a half have the vari- * ,
ous markets been more nervous than '

this week.” ’ ’

.“New curbs on world trade are the
_ biggest factor. These coincide with
. ‘brighter truce prospects in Korea. In
.addition, A'nthony Eden tells Parlia-
ment that ‘Fear of immediate war’ has

, lessened.” '

“ ‘Is that bad?’ you might ask. No;
the peace news is good. _But, if you
held a. lot of high-priced commodities,
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY?” (Capi-

' tals ours.)

-li"Well, we don’t hold a lot of high-
priced commodities so we can’t tell
whether we would be happy or not.

fBut we do know that millions of

American mothers would be made very

‘happy if. real peace were established
-in Korea. 5

? Brass Council drafts  J
ianti-depression program  

Without an outlook for peace there can

be no hope of ‘improving the wages, .

working conditions or living standards
of the brass workers. In a year and a
half of war, the real wages of the brass
workers have dropped close to WPA
levels. The leaders of our nation ‘must
be made to feel as we do that there is
no alternative to peace. Peace will

mean lower taxes; a return to civilian’

production, free international trade, the
building of homes, schools, hospitals,
roads—in effect, jobs for ‘brass work-
ers. '

“2. With the continued mechanization
of the industry, there seems to be only
one solution to the problems of jobs or
wages —a shorter work week. The
union therefore recommends that we
open the fight for a 30-hour week with
40 hours pay. If the 30-hour week_were
put ‘into effect today it would restore
employment in the brass industry to
1947 levels.

“3. The enormous profits of the brass
companies must be siphoned off "to
lighten the load on the workers and to

pay the cost of increased social securi- '

ty, increased unemployment compensa-
tion benefits, increased workmens’ com-
pensation, and to ‘pay for a broader
social security ' and welfare program
for the workers.

“4. We must secure passage of a Na-
tional Fair Employment Practices Act,
which will guarantee equal rights for
all regardless of race, color or sex.
Discrimination means lower wages, less
purchasing power andless “jobs for
brass workers. a

“We feel that to insure the securing
of this program. we must fight for the

vger , s -

repeal of ‘all anti-labor and repressive
legislation and the election of those
men and ‘women who will fight to se-
cure this program.”

Int’l vice president Orville. Larson,
in a speech to the conference, said that
if we are to win the ﬁght for better

wages and working conditions, we must _

at the same time battle against anti-
labor laws and for the civil rights of
our members. And he urged develop-
ment of a political action program.

compensation laws“

CALGARY, A1berta'—The Alberta
provincial legislature has approved a

_ bill to implement the report of a spe-

cial legislative committee on work-
men’s compensation.

The report recommended an increase
in compensation payments from the
former 66% per cent to 75 per. cent
of the worker’s earnings. It also sug-
gested an increase .of ‘ minimum pay-
ments to $25 weekly, elimination of
the three-day waiting period, increase
in funeral benefits,‘ upping of the wage
ceiling to $3,000, and doublingrof per
diem allowances. 

The committee made its report after
hearing submissions from interested

, labor and employer groups, which in-

cluded testimony from Mine-Mill.

The Mine-Mill brief presented by a
large delegation repfdsenting. all 10-
cals in the province, called for 100 per
cent compensation. Although this goal
was not achieved at this session of the
legislature, there is no doubt that
pressure by organized labor succeeded
in winning major concessions in work-
men’s compensation legislation. It is
estimated that the concessions granted
will total over "$800,000.

arbitration decision
- LYLE, Tenn.—Goodwill Furnace
Workers Union, Local 314, has just
won an‘ «important arbitration. case
against the Tennessee ‘Products &
Chemical Corporation. _ ‘

The case involved interpretation _of

the contract clause on call out pay af- .

ter 8 hours work in a day or after'40
hours in a week. The company insisted
that the pay should be at straight

time, while the union contended that it

should be at overtime‘ rates of time
‘and a half. .

o

The arbitrator, J. M. Porter of the
University of Tennessee, ruled "that “if
an employee is called out after having
already worked eight hours in the same
day; or ‘forty hours during, the same
week, he is entitled to a minimum of
four hours ‘pay at one and one "half
times his straight time rate.”

iandits affiliated companies——the list would be

..-2C,.Qrporation_ and Revere Copper and Brass, to
mention just a few. '~

‘THE SYSTEM‘

Take a look at Mexico. In its 1950 annual
report, AS&R‘ admits ownership of some 14

major "properties in Mexico. Actually, we are 

told, it owns some 40 properties. AS&R so
completely dominates the Mexican mining in-’
dustry that the workers there call it “the sys-
tern.” They have been fighting “the system”
now for some 60 years. . '

It is impossible to understand‘ the position
of AS&R mine andsmelter workers in Mexico
unless we at least glance back” over these 60
years. The process of bringing the principality
of -Mexico into the Guggenheim family empire
was begun in‘ 1890 when Don Porfirio Diaz,
Mexico’s president and iron-fisted dictator,
granted-Daniel Guggenheim the right to estab-
lish three smelters. The governor of the state
of Nueve Leon next year. kindly exempted the
Guggenheim properties there from all state and
H. , municipal taxes for a period of twenty years.
Thus began a ‘pattern of close collaboration

the capital and exploited the workers—and‘ a
little clique of politicians, generals and land-
lords got their cut in the form of certain taxes
or certain jobs. ' '1

AS&R LABOR RELATIONS ’
The following. story told by O’Connor illus-
trates how this partnership worked out in
practice. He describes’ a strike at AS&R’s
Aquascalientes smelter, despite the repression
‘of the mine manager the governor and the
dreaded rurales (Mexican mounted police). In
the wordskof the plant manager: '
“The men really didnft know‘ what they
wanted,” he related years later.‘ “Their leaders
camein and when we asked them‘wh.at they
wanted, all they could answer was ‘Mas dinero,
menos trabajo’—more money, less“ work. I
phoned the governor and when I didn’t get
action right away, I phoned Mexico City. Next
morning a troop of thirty rurales came riding-
up the road. The Jefe came into my office and
asked me what was wrong. I told him. He
clicked his heels, saluted, and strode out. 1
“Two hours later I saw five men . . . march-
ing down the road. Their arms were stretched
out, one hand chained to the pommel of a
rurale’s saddle to the right of him, the other
, to the pommel on the left side. .
_ “A little later.the J efe came into my office,
saluted, and said: ‘Everything’s all right now,
seﬁorl Your men arecready, to go to work.’
“Well, that evening I walked down‘ the road A
V by the adobe wall that surrounds the smelter,
1 and "there was 'a fresh—dug grave. The five
ag1tat‘ors.1had been lined uppgagainst the wall
and shot, and their "bodies thrown into the dc

“That’s the way to handle the labor_ pro
lem,” commented the manager. “It’s simh
and direct and it gets results.” (Page .326.) , A‘

Some‘ idea of ‘the’ conditions these Mexi 1'
miners. were fighting may be gathered fr
another incident O’Connor ‘describes duringit 

revolution beginning in 1910. ’ ~  
John Reed, the famous journalist, a:sk_e’dj
one of the men ,“What are you fighting for?"
The man answered: “Why, it-is good fight,-.5

WAGE LEVELS at AS&R mines in Mexico, like the one shown here, are as low as fl '20 cents an hour fora, mashing. miner, 

cents an hour‘/for a mucker.

State of Oaxaca (Southern Mexico)

,. Tractor driver in pit ...... --17 cents
Mucker (underground) .- 9 cents
Surface labor lead'man--_- 6 cents

There are things in these wages that are-
different from ours. Part of it is a recent 12:

to 15 per cent cost of living increase won in the

middle of last year. Part of it is a sliding scale ’ "J
basedon the price of the metal mined or proc- .

essed. Not included in these wages are benefits
which may be worth another 5 per cent such as
the company’s contributions to recreation and

sports funds, toward the union halls and health’

clinics. And not included are company housing,
sometimes furnished at nominal or free rentals.
These wages might be contrasted yvith AS&R’s
893_million dollars in profits before taxes in the
last 25 years. A i

Take it all in all, however, the living stand-
ards of these workers in Mexico are not much
different from their brothers in Chile and Peru

as the following comparison of "wages makes,

all too clear.

levels in Mexico together with what we have
intimated about government -repression of
unions are the factors underlying great unrest

' among Mexican workers.

THE ‘GREAT MARCH

"The most dramatic example of this unrest
started early last year in the small towns of

‘ .Nueva Rosita and Cloete, about an hour’s drive

south of the border from Eagle Pass, Texas
This is AS&R country. - ‘

\ None of us had heard much about Nueva
Rosita and Cloete until early last year when-

THE UNION published an article about some-
thing quite unbelievable.’

The press in the United States was silent

about it. The press of Mexico was -silent about

it. Only a few union papers below the border
carried this .story about 4,200 striking Mexican
miners who marched 1,000 miles to Mexico City.

The long trek was made across steep moun-
tainous land covered with ice. The march took
almost 80 days in the dead of winter from

January 20 to March’10’of last year.

Close to 200 wives and 30 children marched
with them. One woman gave birth to her baby
on the way. They marched though their feet
were swollen and bled, though they had to sleep
in the open and the snow.’

Here, perhaps, was the.most stirring labor
demonstration ever held anywhere on the Amer-
ican continent. Why did the miners _do it?‘

Piece by piece the story finally. came out

A and we can now put itrtogether. Their strike '
against AS&R was three months old before,
they started their epic 1n‘arch.. _ They had seen,

For the Native Born 1
There was the McCarran Act of 1950.
 Because of this law, four federal con-
centration camps are being bu1lt—m

.one in‘Oklaho1na, two in Arizona (see
photostats, this page). ‘ _
0  Last July, the- Congressaheard 811
 ii appeal from James V. Bennett, Federal
.V Prison Director, for $775,000 to oper-
ll ate the concentration camps. At pr_es- ,
 -ent, Bennett is . quietly v. cru1t1ng
“guards to serve in them.

l0n January 16 of this year, Sen.

if 1 :' Eastland of Mississippi introduced a

resolution for a Congressional declara-
 tion of an “internal security emer-.
 gency” which would “place. into full
 effect” the concentration camp pro-
; jg’ visions of the McCarran act.
' . In his message vetoing the McCarran
'Act,~ President Truman said that “an-
- ider our glcgalsystem, to detam a man
“not charged with a crime would raise
l__’-Ierious Constitutional questions." » V
But ‘the law does not,’ require the
President to build concentration camps.
nor to- staff them. It merely authorizes

'0 j . him to do soif he chooses. If he meant-

jwhathe said in his veto message, ‘he
 would hardly be taking action which
‘ ' 1- this law does not direct him to’ take.

The McCarran Act provides for hear- it -

s f, iings and appeals, but “the Attorney
" General or his representative shall not
"'”be required to furnish information the .

revelation of which would disclose the

‘ .; identity or evidence of ‘government
C -fagents or officers which he believes it
.1. would be dangerous to national safety
 and security» to divulge.” . ‘

So men and women could be held for ‘ 5,

0 ,  months or years without ever knowing
' .1 what they were accused of or who ac-
‘ -.;(:used them. 1-» A ' ‘ ~
For the Foreign Born

Not satisfied’ with the rate of de-
portations takingplace under the Mc- ‘
' Carran act of 1950, Sen. McCarran and

" Rep. Francis Walter (_Dem., Pa.) have
‘:-sponsored a bill that would place m1l- '
"lions of foreign born jnnericans at the
‘complete mercy of the Attorney Gen-

era! and the immigration service.

So complete is ‘the power of the im-
migration service under terms of the
proposed legislation that Harry N.
Rosenfield, U. S. commissioner on the

’ ,/:t.; Displaced Persons Commission, who is‘

not known as a radical, recently told a
Washington audience: “The proposed
,_ - McCarran legislation is Amerz'ca’s Nur-
‘ emberg law. It is racist and archaic,
"based on the theory that people with
different styles of noses should be
treated differently.”
Rosenfield said “this thoroughly vi-

OTTAWA, Canada—-—The_ Canadian
Commonwealth Federation, stepclilild
of Canada’s CIO, has issued a sharp
attack on Canada’s participation in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). A 4 A
The CCF statement declared that

Canada and her North Atlantic allies '

have gone overboard on rearmament in
a “disastrous and irresponsible” way
and blamed American military influ-
ences for Canada’s huge military
spending program.

Leaders of the party, which often
is described as “socialist,” demanded

that military increases mapped at the.

recent Lisbon NATO parley be
dropped and the money spent instead
on economic rebuilding of Europe.~

Captain Wm. W. Herridge, CCF
M.P. told Parliament that he backed
his party’s claim, that “the Atlantic
Alliancegcommitted Canada to unreal-
istic, disastrous military targets.” He
declared that U. S. military leadership
is dominating NATO, and that U. S.
leadership may drag the West into a
war with China.

These critical views, Herridge said, A

are supported by far more Canadians
than some members of Parliament real-
ize. “We are opposed,” he added, ,“to
association with former Nazis or fasc-

sites in perpetuity to huge U. . cor-

the legislature have made any stfong
protest against this alienation of Ca-
nadian resources, but labor doesn’t like
to see _Canadian bosses replaced by
Americans, as is the case at the Alcan
development in Kemano, and Canadian
exploiters who aren’t getting their cut
of the melon are clamoring for a larger
slice. .

The forest management schemes, by
which_ whole counties are allotted to
those able to pay, which almost‘ always
means American interests, are. putting
a lot 0f\ smaller operators out of busi-
ness. One such, speaking to‘the writer
the other day, declared he had $10,000
.to gamble on a CCF nomination. For-
merly he was a Coalitionist. He of
course is an ‘isolated and . extremist
case, but many of his colleagues, as
well as a lot of disillusioned CCF sup-
pointers, are going to cast a protest
vo e. _ ~

‘ Opportunity for this is being pro-

’ vided by the Social‘ Credit League,

which has announced its intention of
contesting every seat. A “Christian
party for good government” by its own
admission, it is a catchall for dissatis-
faction, and is gulping down-disgrum
tled CCF-ers as well as peeved indus-
trialists. _

There is strong suspicion, probably
well-founded, that the league is fa-
thered by the Conservatives, the most
optimistic of whom have slight hope
of gaining a majority. But another
Coalition with Social Credit, presum-
ing each win enough -minority seats,
would-enable them to form as conserv-
ative and reactionary a government as
could be desired even by the Pentagon.

Certainly, ever since the Conserva-
tives began to be restive within the Co-
alition some two years ago, the Social
‘Credit League had plenty of money for
organizational purposes, and no one
seems, to know where it is coming from.

Solski protests plan for
compulsory arbitration
SUDBURY, Ont.—-The giant Mine-

Mill Local 598 has opened a campaign,

to stop the threat of legislation which
would call for compulsory arbitration
of all labor disputes, including contract
negotiations, in Ontario.

A letter from Local 598 president
Mike Solski to Ontario Minister of
Mines Welland Gemmell, pointed out
that: “Free collective bargaining be-
tween industry and labor is the only

, way in which the democratic processes‘

of our society can be carried out. ,
“Sudbury Mine, Mill‘ and Smelter
Workers’ 17,000 members are‘ solidly
united in their determination to oppose
‘any’ such’ legislation which would im-

_, In addition to the demand for a sub-
J 1’ stantial wage increase, the conference
 proposed that Mine-Mill seek a 5-day,

3  40 hour work week, Monday through
‘T.-"Friday inclusive, with premium pay of

'7 time and a" half for Saturday and

7. double time for Sunday, as such. ‘T On

‘burns mortgage

CARLSBAD, N. M.—At one of the
largest membership meetings held here
in the last two years, Carlsbad Potash
Workers_Local 415 voted unanimously
to continue union dues of $4.50 a month
for another year in support of the 10-

, cal’s iminent contract negotiations.

The increased dues had been in effect
for over a year as part of the Local’s
campaign to.pay off the mortgage on
the Union Hall _and free the‘ Locallof

debts accrued as a result of the 73-day

strike two years ago: 1
Held in two sessions to include at-
tendance of all shifts, the membership
meeting’s unanimous vote to continue
the higher dues as is went beyond the
Local executive board’s recommenda-
tion to maintain the dues only /until
after negotiations were completed, and
then lower them to what they had been.
The morning meeting amended the rec-
ommendation to extend continuation of
the $4.50 dues for _another year, and
the night meeting also approved the
amended ‘motion unanimously. 1 _
THE ' GENERAL feeling expressed"
at both meetings was that whereas the
main goal had been reached to free

-the local- of alldebt, itrwas still neces- -

sary to build a fighting fund to ‘back
the union’s coming contract negotia-

. tions,‘ protect the union from any and

all attacks and build up the local’s
funds sufficiently to expand facilities
of the hall for the good and welfare of
the membership. I

The members, and the wives who also
attended the meeting’, witnessed a spe-
cial ceremony in which the mortgage

on the union hall was burned as a sym-

' bol of the Local’s stability and progress
during the past two years. The cere- '

mony itself represented a solid tribute

Carlsbad local in campaign.  
formillion dollar hospital  

By C. D. Smothermon
Board Member, District 2

CARLSBAD, N. M.—Car1sbad Pot-
ash Workers Local 415 has gone into
action to assure the construction of
much needed hospital facilities for the
entire community.

For a number or’ years the shortage
has been so bad that the sick have fre-

_ quently been treated. in the hallways
« of the two available hospitals or denied _

entrance. With a growing population

_ resulting from pending operation of

two more potash companies, expected
to employ a total of at’ least 1,500
workers within the next few months,
Mine-Mill Local 415 was gravely con-
cerned about the hospital shortage.

' Now, as a direct result of action by
Local 415’s membership and the Ladies’

. Auxiliary, the County Commissioners
, are proceeding with plans to hold a

bond election within the next 65 days
so the people may determine whether

1 a $1,000,000 modern hospital will be
_ constructed in Carlsbad.

‘THE LOCAL ‘UNION formed a com-

' mittee in cooperation with Ladies’ Aux- '
‘ iliary Local 206,, investigated the legal

procedure on bonds, got petitions
printed andobtained‘ over 1,500 signa-
tures of electors within a J matter ‘of

‘ ‘two weeks. - -
v When the ‘membership of this Mine-A

Mill local opened their campaign for

construction of a County, hospital in‘

Carlsbad, other groups. throughout the
County beganto get active.’ In.Artesia,
N. M., _some 25 miles away but in the

same County, a groupof business and.
_ professional men got busy. They, too,

claimed a need for additional hospital
facilities in their community. A
As a result, their forces joined with

I those of Mine-Mill Local 415 to form

an alliance and push for the construc-
tion of two hospitals, one for Artesia
as well as one for Carlsbad as orig-
inally planned by the union and its
Auxiliary. The Artesia group included
bank presidents, merchants, contractors
and oil executives.

4” Npw still another group has opened
a drive for a smaller hospital to‘be
constructed at Loving, N. M., "in the
South end of the County. The County
Commissioners now have on file peti-
tions calling. for three hospitals: the
original ‘$1,000,000 hospital for Carls-
bad, a $600,000 hospital for Artesia and
