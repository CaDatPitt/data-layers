the toughness of Finland and by Hitler's impatience for a quick settle-

, ment. At the end of the war it was not merely Finland but more than
’ half of Europe which was in the grip of the Kremlin. Actually, the

whole of Europe was in a revolutionary ferment. While the Kremlin
could afford to warm its hands where a limited, localized revolu-
tionary fire was concerned, it knew well enough that it would only
burn its hands in the case of a general European-wide revolutionary
conflagration. This is -why, from the beginning, far from warming
its hands at the fires of revolution, the bureaucracy became the
extinguisher of revolutionary fires everywhere in Europe. This is
a fact nobody can successfuldy deny. ‘

Instead of warming its hands in revolutionary fires, the Kremlin
set itself entirely different objectives -- to crush revolutions and
to pillage the countries entered by the Soviet armies. What we actu-
ally witnessed was outright and open counter-revolution by the Kremlin
in all the buffer countries. The comrades of the minority say, we
all know that. Naturally, we don't minimize the counter-revolutionary
role of the Kremlin. The Stalinists suppressed the workers; they
wiped out all of the incipient organs of dual power, the workers‘
committees. They shot militant workers who on their own initiative
took over factories; they returned these factories to the owners.
Sure, we know all of that. But, what happened nevertheless, espe-
cially since l9#8? True, this quotation of Trotsky's did not apply
in the first three years following the war, but doesn't it apply now?
Hasn't the Kremlin been warming its hands at the fire of revolution
since l9%8? Or to put it more charitably, hasn't it been carrying

.on a "special type" of civil war since then?

Such argumentation may appear formally correct. But as Marxists
we are duty bound to analyze the stages of Kremlin policy in buffer
countries in their interrelationship. At least this is what Comrade
Trotsky always taught us and this is how he always analyzed the Soviet
Union in its degeneration. The workers state established by the
October Revolution could not escape the barbarism and the backward-
ness inherited from Czarism. This barbarism and backwardness became
incarnated in the bureaucracy. But the Bonapartist bureaucracy is
unable to wrench itself free from the revolutionary origin of the
regime. This is the basic contradiction of the degenerated workers
state and in it is to be found the explanation for the Old Man's
insistence on the origin of the Soviet Union every time he defined
its social nature.‘ This insistence on origin is not an abstraction,
not something secondary and certainly does not flow from a mere sen-
timental attachment to the great October Revolution. It is this con-
tradiction that has determined, as it still does, the relationship of
living forces in the USSR.

The various stages in the evolution of the buffer countries must
be examined in their interrelationship. What is the origin of these
so-called workers states, if you want to call them that? Their
origin is in counter-revolution, isn't it? Who has forgotten that the
advancing Soviet armies suppressed the insurgent masses and crushed

tthe elements of dual power created by them, along with all manifesta-

tions of independent working class action? The Soviet bureaucracy
made its alliance with the remnants of the native bourgeoisie, on
occasion even with the fascist elements. National unity and the

’ the political crystaluzation and the organization of regimes took

place in those countries under Stalinism. National unity provided the
Kremlin with a good cover for its pillage and subjugation. Under
this cover it could stifle resistance to the heavy reparations it
imposed. Under this cover it was able to dismantle "German-owned"
plants and remove them to the USSR. It seized the stocks in indus-
try and banks the Germans had themselves plundered. It established
Joint-ownership corporations for the exploitation of these countries.
It took away grain, livestock, and other goods by the hundreds and
thousands of carloads. It made these countries pay for the upkeep
of the occupying forces, as some are still doing to this day.

The respective bourgeoisies tolerated this pillage because they
had little choice.- They could not challenge the Kremlin without their
big uncle in Washington who wasn't ready as yet for a showdown. The
first partial test came with the Marshall Plan. The governments

of both Poland and Czechoslovakia decided to join the Marshall Plan,
and it is safe to say that every government in the buffer zone would
This was a warning signal to the bur-
eaucracy of how easily, the buffer countries could slip out of its
control. Moscow became panicky. It was then that the measures
against the various native bourgeoisies were undertaken in earnest.
Nationalizations were stepped up. It was then that a number of

purges was undertaken. The weight of American dollars proved unequal
in the contest as against the Kremlin's military might and pressure.
Stalin won this round.

But, what is the social condition of these countries today,
after the purges and nationalizations of 19MB? The minority com-
rades offer their "sociological definitions." Our answer is that
what happened there, following this Marshall Plan experience,
hasn't at all led to a social overturn in these countries. A purge
of individual capitalist politicians or groups from top government
posts, changes the ruling personnel but not the bourgeois character
of a state. Removal of individual capitalists or groups from com-
mending posts in industry is important to the individuals involved
but does not change decisively the social relationships in the
country. But, where then is the bourgeoisie? It continues to exist
in every pore of society in the buffer countries.

We must not be hypnotized by statistics on nationalizations.
Bare figures can never give us the correct answer to the existing
relationships of social forces in society. We can come much closer
to a correct answer if we examine the actual position of the class
forces in daily life. And such an examination will disclose, for
example, that the bourgeoisie remains in industry as managers of
nationalized plants. I had occasion to talk recently with a Rumanian
who left that country shortly after the bulk of nationalization had—
taken place. I asked him what was the procedure followed in taking
over the factories. It was very simple, he said. A couple of gov-
ernment functionaries came to the owner and told him that the enter-
prise no longer belongs to him but that if he wanted to sign up in
the Communist Party he could remain as the manager. In most cases the
owners, of course, signed up in the Communist Party.

-11-

This story is quite credible, and I dare say it is typical of
practically all of the buffer countries. It stands to reason that
the constitution of a new regime to run all economic and political
and cultural institutions, including individual plants, scores of
thousands of men and women are required, Where did they all come
from? In some of these countries even the Stalinist parties them-
selves have hardly existed. The Hungarian Communist Party, for
example, had the grand total of 110 members when the Soviet army occu-
pied the country. Tk;is'kmtified to by the Yugoslavs, who are Surely
in a position to know. The situation in the other countries approxi-
mated that of Hungary.

Only a proletarian revolution could have brought forward the
staff required for a new regime. Lacking such forces, Stalin had tc
draw on the native bourgeoisies. They exist in all the departments
of government as we are so often reminded when another batch of them
jumps over the fence. And these include high diplomatic personnel
from all these countries. They desert in droves when sent on diplo-
matic missions to the West. And bear in mind that when the Stalin-
ists send somebody abroad they try at least to make sure to send those
who are the most reliable, Yet even out of this closely-sifted selec-
tion we see such a high percentage of bourgeois. This surely provides
a sort of gauge for measuring of the living relationship of forces.

As for agriculture, the relations there remain, of course, bourgeois,
owned and operated privately, even though with some government re-
strictions. These countries with the sole exception of Czechoslo-
vakia are, as we all know, heavily agricultural, even Poland about
50%, Bulgaria 80%, Hungary about 70%.

The bourgeohﬂe and its representatives permeate the educational

.system of these countries; they are deep in the police force, the

staffs of the army, the clergy, which now takes loyalty oaths, with
mental reservations, for double their former salaries. All these
elements are simply biding their time, waiting for their chance and
in the meantime they are camouflaged, if you please, as the best
Kremlin patriots.

It is by no means excluded that numerically the relationship of
class forces within these countries has in recent days shifted to
an extent even more in favor of the bourgeoisie. The Kremlin over-
lords have unquestionably become more and more hated by ever larger
sections of the population, including the working class. What can
the workers now get from or see in the nationalizations, except
another form of Russian oppression. Together with nationalizations
comes the job freeze, longer hours, the piecework system, a con-
tinued scarcity of necessities and consumer goods, etc. In any case,
we may be sure that a prolonged dreary struggle still lies ahead
and the true relationship of class forces in these countries will
first really be revealed in the course of such a struggle.

Those who believe that a real social transformation has already
taken place in the buffer countries and that they have become
workers states do not understand the meaning of the "special type"
of civil war to which they are now making so many references. Actu-
ally, this is to have more faith in the possibility of effecting
bureaucratically a social transformation than does the bureaucracy
itselfo

.Kremlin bureaucracy had revealed itself quite fully in life, belying

-12-

Let us take some instances of the "special type" of civil war
of which the bureaucracy is capable to see what it really is like.
Let us, for example, take a good look at those territories that were
actually absorbed in the Soviet Union. In each of those cases whole
populations were uprooted and expelled across the borders or exiled
into Siberia, as happened in the Baltic Countries. It is not for
nothing that we have so often argued in the past that the bureau-
cratic method, the bureaucratic purges, not only cannot produce so-
cialist results, but that their cost in human lives is extreme.

We have a classic example of how vast is such cost when a bureau-

cratic liquidation of classes is attempted. we saw this in the

Soviet Union itself in 1929-33 when the Kulaks were first liquidated
as»a class. The bureaucratic struggle against this single layer of
the population twelve years after the October Revolution cost mil-
lions upon millions of lives. And it is quite understandable.

Revolutions are fought out not only in the streets. They are
first fought out in the factories, in the schools, in the offices,
in the meeting halls, by oral and written arguments. Masses become
convinced and are drawn into the struggle, living an intense politi-
cal life. A revolution transforms the whole way of thinking, the
social consciousness of peoples and classes and groups in society.
Purges on the contrary only make the population more hostile, requir-
ing in turn more purges. Everybody knows that. We hardly have to
argue this point among ourselves. But knowing this we ought also to
apply this knowledge to the events transpiring in the buffer countries.
They are still in their initial phases. If and when Stalin ever gets
a chance to assimilate these countries, then we will see purges there
on a scale at least comparable with, if not more horrible, than
Stalin's operations against the Kulaks.

The reason Stalin is proceeding today in such slow and easy
stages is not alone for fear of Washington. Personally, I think that
aspect is quite secondary. Stalin's primary fear is that of a gen-
eral explosion in these countries which would shake off the tenuous
hold the bureaucracy has on them.

Yugoslavia's break with the Kremlin offers us a good example of
the sentiments of the population toward the Kremlin. Yugoslavia is,
of course, different in every other important respect from the
buffer countries. Nevertheless, it is instructive that Stalin, with
all his vast resources, was not able to mobilize among the Yugoslavs
more than a corporal's guard against Tito. If you read the litera-
ture of the Yugoslavs you will find how throughout the war, and fol-
lowing it, the Yugoslav Communist Party kept assiduously preaching
love for the Soviet "socialist fatherland" and, in the first instance,
for Stalin. Stalin's writings were used as the chief textbooks in
the education of the Yugoslav cadres. But despite all this adula-
tion of Stalin and the Soviet Union, there could not be found in the
country any sizable group that would favor Stalin in the split.
Undoubtedly one of the reasons is that the predatory nature of the

and nullifying the high-pressure propaganda. In the case of Yugo-
slavia, the revolutionary origin of the regime created the conditions
for a clean break with the Kremlin in a leftward direction. In
Yugoslavia there was no bourgeoisie strong enough to benefit from the
mass hostility to the Kremlin. It had been defeated during the civil

-13-

war and the revolution. The state and all its institutions found
themselves in the hands of new cadres forged in revolution, who had
a stake in defending the revolutionary gains: It is these cadres
which gave organized expression to the revolt against Moscow domina-
tion and made its success possible to date,

The very same causes which provoked the break between Yugoslavia
and the Kremlin exist in the other buffer countries to an even higher
degree, They have been squeezed much harder by the Kremlin than
Yugoslavia ever W330 We have every reason to assume that East Euro-
pean populations are just as ready for a break with Moscow as the
Yugoslavs proved to be. What is lacking for such a break is, of ‘
course, organization and leadership, But if and when any of the
buffer countries does break out of the Kremlin*s grip, it is not at
all certain in what direction it would then go -- because the rela-
tion between the classes hasn't been resolved in the buffer countries
as it was in Yugoslavia. As of the present, the advantages would be
heavily on the bourgeoisie's side. For the proletariat to gain the
upper hand, it would have to fight hard and long for it,

The existing relation of class forces is what accounts for the
twofold character of the purges in the buffer countries. They are
directed not alone against bourgeois elements who are biding their
time and waiting for a more favorable international conjuncture, but
also against the native Stalinists who have any sort of independent
base among the workers and who might become likely candidates for
leaders in a movement in a revolutionary direction against Kremlin
exploitation.

Let me repeat, to compare Stalin's course in the buffer countries

with his course in Eastern Poland and the Baltic countries in l9HO
is to distort and misinterpret the true picture of developments, In
l9HO Stalin was compelled to give an impulse to the revolutionary
action of the masses in the territories incorporated into the Soviet
Union in order to eliminate the bourgeoisie. Once rid of the bour-
geoisie he could turn against the revolutionary workers and estab-
lish the domination of the bureaucracy, '

In the buffer countries, just the reverse happened. Here it
was the working class which had to be dealt with first and Stalin
made his alliance with the bourgeoisie, This alliance lasted sev-
eral years, permitting the Kremlin to pursue unhampered its plunder
and exploitation of these countries. The result was the demoraliza-~
tion of the proletariat and the rehabilitation of the bourgeoisie,
until the Marshall Plan imposed a new course on the Kremlin. A wave
of purges followed. Nationalization was stepped up, All classes
in the population of the buffer countries have become alienated and
repressed in turn. But what must be emphasized in this connection
is that nowhere and at no time has there been a decisive showdown
between the classes, -

The whole course of the Bonapartist Kremlin bureaucracy in the
buffer countries has been one to prevent what it fears the most;
namely, such a showdown between the classess The bureaucracy could
not survive it, and knows it. It is hated by the bourgeoisie as
well as the proletarian masses. In advance of this decisive

%

-lH-

showdown we cannot possibly draw the conclusion that a social revolu-

l tion had taken place in these countries.

The simplified approach which reduces itself in essence to the
proposition: nationalization equals workers state, can only disorient
our movement. It is a caricature of Marxism. It substitutes bureau-
cratic nationalization decrees for a real analysis of the living
class forces and their relative position in society. Such an approach
cannot conceivably serve us either as a guide to understanding the
events transpiring in the buffer countries or as an aid in shaping
our policy toward them. Nationalization of industry, important as
it is, can be considered as only one field in which the bourgeoisie
has been compelled to surrender its decisive positions. But the
bourgeoisie still has, as I mentioned earlier, considerable strength
in society. Not the least of these is the fact that the agricultural
relations remain capitalist, and that the bourgeoisie permeates all
the institutions of the state, nationalized industry included.

In this connection let me cite frlm Comrade Trotsky's writings
to illustrate the contrast in the method he used in arriving at con-
clusions about the social nature of a regime, as against muaschematic
approach employed by the minority. ‘

My quotation comes from his writings six months prior to Stalin's
campaign to liquidate the Kulak as a class. This was, as we all know,
a very critical period. Here is what Trotsky wrote under the date
of May 1, 1929, assessing the internal class relations within the
Soviet Union: "Weak as our native bourgeoisie is, it is conscious,
and for good reason, that it is a section of the world bourgeoisie
and that it constitutes the transmission mechanism of world imperi-
alism. But even the internal base of the bourgeoisie is far from
negligible. To the extent that the rural economy develops on the
basis of the individual market, it must unavoidably produce a numer-
ous rural petty-bourgeoisie. The mouzhik who is enriching himself
ar the mouznik who is only trying to enrich himself but runs up
against the Soviet legislative barriers, is the natural agent of
Bonapartist tendencies. This has been demonstrated by the whole
evolution of modern history. This has been once more verified by the
experience of the Soviet Republic. Such are the social origins of
the elements of dual power, which characterize the second chapter
of the October Revolution following Lenin's death" (La Revolution
QEQLEEEEEJ Paris: 19292 P- 11)»

Comrade Trotsky, it will be noted,speaks of the Soviet regime
in that period as a regime of dual power. He reached his conclusions
not from any statistics on nationalizations but from his appraisal
nf the than existing relations between living class forces, not the
least important of whom is the peasantry. (Some minority comrades
have tried to brush aside the significance of the fact that agricul-
ture in the buffer countries remains privately owned and operated).
Comrade Trotsky then proceeded to estimate the relative weight of the
contending elements under this dual power.

“The problem of dual power therefore consists at the present
time in knowing to what extent the bourgeois classes are rooted in
the Soviet State apparatus and to what extent bourgeois ideas and

#15-

tendencies are rooted in the apparatus of the proletarian party. For
on this degree depends the party's freedom for maneuver and the possi-
bility for the working class to take the necessary measures of

defense and attack." (Same, p. 15.)

"We thus return here to the question of establishing to what
measure state power still finds itself in the hands of the proletariat
and its party, that is to say, to what measure the state power con-
tinues to be the power of the October Revolution. One cannot answer
this question a priori. Politics has no mechanical rules. The
forces of classes and parties reveal themselves in the course of
struggle. And this entire struggle still lies ahead." (Same, p.15.)

Six months after the Old Man _penned these lines, the struggle
he had predicted came to a head. The Stalinist bureaucracy had set
out to liquidate the Kulak as a class. Trotsky wrote later, "The
basic conquests of the revolution were saved in the end at the cost
of countless sacrifices." (New International, July 1935.) He also
referred to this operation against the Kulaks as a supplementary
revolution. I quoted Comrade Trotsky not because I think there is
an identity between the situation in Russia at that time and today's
situation in the buffer countries. On the contrary. He was analyzing
the class forces in a country where the proletarian revolution had
taken place eleven and a half years earlier. But it is precisely
this that gives greater emphasis to his method which penetrates
beyond the facade of bureaucratic monolithism and official statistics
designed to disguise the class struggle, in order to deal with the
actual contending forces in society. It is only on the basis of
such a method, which takes into account all the factors, that one
can form a sound judgment of the class character of the state.

Some comrades will say, as they have already said, that by
setting up such a yardstick for determining the class nature of the
buffer countries, we are thereby opening the door for a revision of
our position on the Soviet Union which we continue to characterize
as a degenerated workers state. They bring up the similarities
between the regime in the Soviet Union and the regime in the buffer
countries and.demand: Where is the difference? The regime in the
Soviet Union is totalitarian and bourgeois inasmuch as it defends the
privileges of the bureaucracy. The proletarian party has been
smashed, capitalism is reproducing itself even in collectivized agri-
culture, and so on.

superficially such arguments may appear weighty. But actually

they are not. There are indeed many features of the counter-revolu-
tionary Bonapartist regime in the Soviet Union which we find also in
the buffer countries. But these are not the features which have ever
determined for us the fundamental working class character of the
Soviet Union. our criterion has always been: the proletarian revo-
lution of October 1917 and the correlation of social forces and pro-
ductive relations which resulted from it.

An inseparable part of Comrade Trotsky's definition of the class
nature of the Soviet Union was always the fact that "the social revo-
lution, betrayed by the ruling party, still exists in property rela-

tions and in ths consciousness of the toiling masses" (My emphasis).

-16-

It is true that the proletariat has been expropriated politically in
the Soviet Union; that the party which was once the instrument of
proletarian class rule has been long transformed into an instrument
of the bureaucratic caste. But it was the revolution which has also
determined the specific character of this privileged caste, its
strength as well as its weakness.

To identify the class nature of thebuffer states with that of
the Soviet Union is to say that the ruling "supra-class" bureaucracy
which has come into existence in the Soviet Union as a consequence of
a given set of historical conditions has found a way of reproducing
itself at will in other countries regardless of the differences in
the objective conditions. Such a line of reasoning can give aid and
comfort to the proponents of bureaucratic collectivism. The method
of reasoning would be quite similar except for this, that while
Shachtman conjures up a new class, our minority discovers new workers
states.

The trouble with all this is not only that it violates our
previous conceptions on the nature of Stalinist Bonapartism, but what
is far worse, it assumes as resolved one of the main contradictions
plaguing Stalinism and which may well be the cause of its collapse.
If the Kremlin bureaucracy is capable of reproducing at will its
social regime in other countries, it would thereby be assured of a
bright future. Fortunately, this is refuted by the facts. The status
of the buffer countries resembles more that of occupied areas which
are coming more and more under the direct rule of the occupier. The
Kremlin bureaucracy rules the buffer countries more and more through
a system of gauleiters, its own direct appointees.

In Bulgaria, for example, the bidding of the Kremlin is carried
out by a group of some 500 who have lived most of their lives in the
Soviet Union in the service of the GPU as part and parcel of the
Russian bureaucratic caste. The native Stalinists have almost all
been purged. The dominant figure in Poland today is none other than
Marshall Rokossoveky. The whole course of the buffer countries is
consequently not one toward establishing workers states, or even per-
mitting them to exist as independent states at all, except as a legal
fiction, but to assimilate them structurally under the direct rule
of the Russian bureaucracy.

The Russian bureaucracy has even improvised a theory to Justify
this course.“ In Russia, they have sought to Justify themselves by
means of the "theory" of socialism in one country. But they will
not permit their agents in the buffer countries the benefit of this
"theory" for themselves. The "theory" supplied them is that there
can be no liberation without the Soviet army and that they must all
accept the "leading role" of the Soviet Union.’ This is a doctrine of
abject subordination and unquestioning obedience to the dictates of
the Kremlin. It has been imposed on the Kremlin because of the nature
of the bureaucracy and its own limitations which make it impossible
to pursue any other course except that of structural assimilation.

In pursuing this line, the Kremlin comes into conflict with the class
interests of the proletariat, the peasantry and the bourgeoisie and
violates the national interests of the masses. This conflict has

 

so

 

-17-

by no means been resolved not only in the historical sense but in

the immediate.sense. And it would be wrong to assume that the struc-
tural assimilation of these countries has already been achieved or
even that it will ever be achieved. The struggle is still ahead.

The IEC Resolution lists the obstacles remaining on the road to struc-
tural assimilation. I need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say
that anyone of them may prove to be the spark that could blow up

the predatory schemes of the Kremlin bureaucracy, and eventually the
bureaucracy itself. ‘

EEPORT ON BLFTBR COUNTRIES BY M. STEIN AT NAIIONAL COMMITTEE PLENUM
February l0-13, 1950

The problem of Eastern.Europe we are discussing is really not a
new one. It has been with us for several years, ever since the advan-
cing armies some six years ago entered foreign soil in pursuit of the
defeated Germans and began to occupy one country after another. So-
vkx control over Eastern Europe was a recognized fact by the end of
l9#4, following the Big Three agreements at Yalta and the armistice
agreements with Bulgaria, Finland and Hungary.

The evolution of the countries under Soviet control, to which
we have been referring as the "buffer" countries, has been watched
carefully by the world Trotskyist movement. Every stage in their
evolution has been carefully analyzed in articles and documents. It
was examined by the Second World Congress of the Fourth International
in April l9#8, and the views of the world Trotskyist movement at the
time were incorporated in the resolution on the USSR and Stalinism.
This document has been the common platform of all Trotskyists who
hold the position that the Soviet Union is a degenerated workers‘
state. Only one tendency in the international Trotskyist movement --
the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain -- differed at
that time on this question. They said even then -- two years ago --
that the changes in Eastern Europe, brought about by the Stalinist
bureaucracy, had in effect established workers states there. But
no one took these views very seriously. This tendency, represented
by Jock Haston and his friends, had long ago made a name for itself
by its empiricism, political imbalance, and a leaning for a solution
of the social problems on forces outside the revolutionary movement,
and hostile to it.

when the discussion of Eastern Europe was resumed a year later
at the Seventh Plenum of the International Executive Committee, the
views in the world movement remained essentially the same so far as
the buffer countries themselves were concerned. The differences
which emerged at the Seventh Plenum concerned only Yugoslavia.

Some comrades at the Plenum -- and many more today -- considered
it was a mistake to lump Yugoslavia together with the rest of the
buffer countries in analyzing this question. These comrades felt
that while the resolution was correct in speaking of a tendency toward
the structural assimilation of the buffer countries dominated by the
Soviet bureaucracy, Yugoslavia is in a distinct category; that,
because of the historic origin of the Yugoslav regime, which came
into power as a consequence of a civil war and revolution and because
of the subsequent economic and social transformation of the country
culminating in the break which freed it from the Kremlin's special
forms of restraint and exploitation, Yugoslavia can be considered
a workers state, even though with bureaucratic deformations.

This, briefly, is the background of the present discussion. It
was originally even called the discussion over Yugoslavia. But by
the time this so-called Yugoslav discussion was taken up by us, it
became evident that there was no common position within the Political
Committee on the totality of the problem, and not merely on Yugo-
slavia alone. Let me add that in Europe, too, the discussion has

Qvva wan.

since gone beyond the question of Yugoslavia. There too, judging
from the discussion bulletins, the entire previous analysis of the
buffer countries has now been brought up for reexamination by some
comrades.

For the purposes of my opening presentation I will deal with the
buffer countries under Kremlin's control and leave Yugoslavia aside
for the moment. Because to lump them together can only confuse the
issue, theoretically as well as practically. I shall state my point
of view on Yugoslavia in the summary and I believe that following
the Plenum we will have to enter into a more thorough discussion of
Yugoslavia.

r Our preliminary discussions in the Political Committee have
revealed two positions: (1) that of the majority of the Political
Committee which bases itself in general on the analysis and conclu-
sions of the World Congress theses and the IEC resolution; (2) that
of the minority which considers that the buffer countries have ceased
to be capitalist states and must now be considered as workers states
(deformed or degenerated).,

These differences have not as yet been spelled out in different
tactical lines. This means that we can afford a leisurely discus-
sion. We are under no pressure for immediate conclusions which
would affect our daily activity. But in discussing and studying this
problem, we ought to bear in mind that involved here is not merely
a question of what label to pin on one or another country. Class
definitions in the Marxist movement have a logic of their own and
williin time lead to different conclusions in perspectives and

ac cs.

Noteworthy also is the fact that even though there seems to be
general agreement among us on the facts concerning the evolution of
the buffer countries and on the concrete situation prevailing in
them at present, we, nevertheless, disagree on the method of inter-
preting these facts. In other words, a sort of difference over
methodology is involved here. A difference in appraising what is
and what is not a workers state.

Let us therefore start with this question of: What are the
criteria for a workers state? In Harxist theory and in historical
experience, we know of only one way in which a workers state can come
into existence -- by way of the proletarian revolution. That is,
the proletariat, through its independent mass action and guided by
the revolutionary party, is the only force in modern society able
to abolish capitalist rule and construct a workers state. We know
also, from theory, and one might add a century of lhrxist practice,
that the bourgeois state cannot be reformed into a workers state,
but it and all its institutions must be abolished. And only then,
can ittb replaced by a workers state and its specific ruling organs.
Now these propositions have been ABC in the Parxist movement. They
have been defended by the Marxists throughout the years against the
Blanquists, against the Social Democratic‘opportunists and against
the Stalinists. ~

Purely economic criteria for establishing the existence or non-
existence of the workers state have figured in our movement only in

-3-

discussing the degeneration of a workers state previously established
by a proletarian revolution. In discussing the Soviet Union and its
degeneration, Comrade Trotsky on several occasions ridiculed the
petty-bourgeois snobs who viewed the Soviet Union, dominated by the
monstrous bureaucratic caste; who compared it with the norm of a
workers state described by Marx and Lenin, and as it emerged out of
the October Revolution, and then shied away from reality because it
did not measure up to the norm. But in defending his position that
the Soviet Union remains a workers state so long as its economic
foundations established by the October Revolution remain, even
though the working class there had been expropriated politically by
a privileged bureaucracy, Comrade Trotsky never for a moment assumed
that the working class can also be expropriated politically in the
task of accomplishing the revolution and creating a workers state.
In other words, Trotsky never assumed that there can be such a mon-
strosity as a "bureaucratic revolution." And when Shachtman tried
to impute to Comrade Trotsky the idea that a bureaucratic revolution
was possible, the Old Man angrily rebuked Shachtman for such a
monstrous distortion of his views. He said that "this charge is not
only incorrect but disloyal." "Disloyal" was one of the sharpest
words in the Old Man's vocabulary. He couldn't have rejected this
proposition more emphatically.

This exchange between Shachtman and the Old Man took place in
1939 over the incorporation of Eastern Poland into the USSR and the
problems raised at the time by the Soviet-Finnish war and the occu-
pation of the Baltic countries. Comrade Trotsky, you will recall,
watched these developments very carefully and made some predictions
as well as analyzing the events. He summed up the role of the Stal-
inist bureaucracy in the territories it incorporated into the Soviet
Union in the following two propositions: (1) The Kremlin bureau-
cracy would be forced to destroy capitalism in the territories it
incorporates into the Soviet Union, because it cannot and will not
share its power and privileges with the bourgeoisie; (2) in order to
destroy capitalism in the regions it incorporates into the Soviet

‘ Union, the bureaucracy must give an impulse to a revolution, limited

though it may be. It must call the masses into action. As he
wrote at that time ". . . without such an appeal even if worded with
extreme caution it is impossible to constitute a regime." The
meaning is quite clear. Even in cases of direct incorporation of
new territories into the USSR, the bureaucracy would one way or
another be compelled to bring the proletariat on the scene in order
to effect the transformation. Without this "it is impossible to
constitute a new regime."

It is essential, before we go any further, to try to understand
fully the Old Man's reasoning in these propositions. And to under-
stand his reasoning, one must first understand the dynamics of social
revolution. I hope the comrades will go back to our classics and
Ieaiempecially Trotsky's monumental work on the history of the Russian
Revolution to get a feeling of what a social revolution is.

A social revolution means the transfer of state power from the
hands of one class into the hands of another class. In the case of
the proletarian revolution it means, in the first instance, a socia-
list program which attracts the workers, which convinces them, a

party which organizes and mobilizes them as a class. It means the
smashing of the old state and all its institutions. It means the
setting up of the new state based on workers‘ councils as the organs
of the new power. '

No mistake is possible in establishing the existence of a
workers state once the revolution has taken place. Nobody made that
mistake after the October 1917 revolution. To recognize the exis-
tence of a workers state at that time it was not necessary to study
the statistics on nationalizations or whether planning had been
established or if there was a monopoly of foreign trade. Before
anything was nationalized, everybody knew there was a workers state
in Russia. And above all the Russian proletariat knew it- it knew
it was the master of the house in Russia; it was imbued with socia~
list consciousness; it was led by a confident party which the
workers trusted. No one doubted that the socialization of industry
would follow as a matter of course.

In brief, the most important element in the social revolution
is the consciousness and self-action of the working class as
expressed in the policy of its vanguard party.

Even the Bonapartist Kremlin bureaucracy was compelled to

appeal to the toilers in Eastern Poland and the Baltic countries

in 1939 because without such an appeal it could not constitute a
new regime in these territories -which it incorporated in the USSR.
It had to resort to the mobilization of the masses because otherwise
it could not get the men and women to replace the old regime.

Even the bureaucracy when it acquired new territories was
forced to bring the working class on the arena for a limited period
in order to be able to select the personnel even for its type of
police regime.

The Kremlin bureaucracy faced an entirely different situation
in the final stages of the war -— from l9%3 to l9H5. The occupation
of new territories by the Soviet armies coincided with a widespread
and deep~going revolutionary upsurge of the masses. This upsurge
wasn't confined to this or that country. It was European in scope
and even world-wide. At this stage the Stalinist bureaucracy, which
fears the revolutionary action of the masses more than anything
else, made a common front with the imperialists for the suppression
of all revolutionary manifestations. This is all recent history
and there is no need to recount here in detail the measures by which
the revolutionary masses were thrown back and defeated. Nobody
among us had any doubts on this score at the time.

The bureaucracy was not able to afford even a limited appeal

to the, masses in order to establish a different regime. In the
territories the Kremlin bureaucracy annexed or re-incorporated into
the Soviet Union, it no longer resorted to an appeal to the masses.
The resort instead was to a total depopulation of these territories.
In the Karelian territory that was annexed, for example, they
expelled 400,000 across the border into Finland. In the annexed
strip of Eastern Prussia, they expelled every last German and brought
in some 500,000 Russians from White Russia and other areas. One and

a half million Rumanians were expelled from Bessarabia and Boukovina.
They expelled %,OO0,000 Poles from the territory east of the Curzon
line into Western Poland. And Poland is supposed to be the ally of
Russia.

What we see here, in the absence of even a limited appeal to

the masses such as was witnessed in 1939, is a process of the most
brutal and complete Russification. When incorporation or annexation
of territories into the Soviet Union takes place, there is no diffi-
culty in recognizing the fact. Such territories become indistinguish-
able from the rest of the Soviet Union. They have one and the same
productive relations, one and the same GPU, one and the same state,
one and the same army, etc. There is, of course, a change in popula-
tion. The whole weight of the Soviet bureaucracy, which isn't insig-
nificant as we all know, is brought to bear on a limited area in order
to achieve the results.

We have witnessed an entirely different process on the scale of
virtually half of Europe -- that is, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania and Eastern Germany. This process is
defined_ in the documents of the world movement as a tendency to
"structural assimilation." First there came the alliance of the
Soviet bureaucracy with the remnants of the native bourgeoisies for
the strangulation of the revolutionary mass upsurge and for the recon-
stitution of bourgeois regimes in these countries subservient to the
Kremlin. And then, as the conflict between the Soviet Union and
U.S. imperialism began to unfold and found its expression in the
countries within the Soviet orbit, the Stalinist bureaucracy found
itself obliged to resort to a series of economic reforms and purges
of the state institutions in order to keep its stranglehold on these
countries.

This process is still going on. The question is, what will be
its end results? Barring any sudden changes which can come about if
war breaks out or if one or another cozitry tears itself out of the
Stalinist orbit, the process would end, as the Resolution of the IEC
points out, in the‘organic linking of these countries with the Soviet
Union. in that case their relations with the Soviet Union would be
no different than, for example, those of the Baltic countries. That
is the only outcome we can envisage as far as the end of the road of
structural assimilation is concerned. I shall deal later with some
of the problems the bureaucracy faces before it reaches the end of
this road. ~

Obviously we cannot draw the conclusion that the structural
assimilation has already taken place because that's not so. They are
moving in that direction. But they haven't as yet been assimilated
into the Soviet Union. The IEC Resolution singles out six, seven,
or eight important fundamental differences between the Soviet Union
and these countries. They differ in their economies, in their social
relations, in the political regimes, and so on. No, the process
hasn't been completed and the Soviet bureaucracy knows only too well
that it has many important hurdles to overcome before it can consider
these countries as component parts of the Soviet Union.

Is it the conclusion of the minority that these countries should
be considered workers states in their own right? For example, that
it is correct today to consider Czechoslovakia as the Czechoslovak
degenerated workers state; Hungary as the Hungarian degenerated
workers state; and the same for Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, or Eastern
Germany? If that is the case, the comrades of the minority will have
to explain to us how all these workers states came about, by what
process. And, to begin with, they will have to try to square their
conclusions with the basic Marxist concepts of social revolution.

I have been trying to find out exactly what it is that the
minority wants us to do, and I turned to Comrade Hansen for an expla-
nation. He devotes a good part of his article to attacking the idea
that economic planning is a criterion for a workers state. He is, I
admit, very forceful in his criticism. By the time he is through
with the point on economic planning there is little left of it but
shreds. But what bearing does this have on the nature of the buffer
zone countries?

If we were dealing here with workers states, established by pro-
letarian revolution, and some of us refused to recognize them as such
because they are too small or too backward to engage in real planning,
then such an argument would be completely in place. One need only
point out that there wasn't any real planning in Russia for a number
of years after the October Revolution. We all know this. But the
question of planning has been raised in an entirely different con-
nection. It was raised by Comrade Germain, for example, as one of
the guide posts on the road toward structural assimilation of these
economies with the Soviet Union and not at all as a criterion for a
workers state established by revolution. There is a profound dif-
ference between proletarian revolution and the process we are witnes-
sing in the buffer countries. But Comrade Hansen refers to the two
interchangeably as if they were one and the same thing.

Let me quote from his article to illustrate my point:

"For socialist planning you do need a minimum material base.
But it seems to me that Comrade Germain should have added for the
benefit of revolutionary-minded workers in Rumania, Luxemburg and
Paraguay that they can still make a good start toward the goal of
socialist planning by conquering power and setting up their own gov-
ernment. That would give them a workers‘ state, and while this is a
long way from socialism, still it is a most essential and most deci-
sive step in .Iz1.«:-%laias_.s..s.‘§a_;'.t."

Then comes the punch line:

"Comrade Germain could not do this, however, without running up
against the criterion laid down in thezresolution that the qualita-
tive point of change between a capitalist state and a workers state
is the institution of ‘real planning‘ which is possible only on a
minimum material basis which neither Rumania, Luxemburg, nor Paraguay
has available."

Comrade Germain knows the ABC's of Marxism and I also know that
if a revolution made by the working class takes place in any country

- "‘*‘-in-Vt‘-I'«> .~.-«M... v.. y ...,./.t 

in the world he would surely recognize such a country as a workers
state, planning or no planning.

It seems to me that it is Comrade Hansen and not Germain who
needs enlightenment -- not on planning -- but on the difference
between a workers state arising from a proletarian revolution and
this process of structural assimilation, or incorporation, of coun-
tries which the Stalinist bureaucracy is now trying to carry through
as a substitute for proletarian revolution. As a matter of fact,
Comrade Germain is quite explicit on this point in his article. He
says, "Actually, Lenin often insisted on the fact, and Leninists
have always recognized, that the victory of the socialist revolution
(that is establishment of the Soviet power) is itself the decisive
criterion proving its own existence. The state resulting from such
a revolution is 'proletarian' to all intents and purposes, even if
the economic relations have not yet undergone any immediate overturn."
(International Information Bulletin, January 1950, page 14.)

The minority will be wasting its shots if it continues to fire
away at planning as a criterion for a workers state; or at dependence
on the world market; or at the capitalist nature of agriculture in
the buffer countries, and so on. We readily grant all these points
and even go a step further and say that the immediate nationalization
of industry is not necessarily a criterion for a workers state either
-- provided the:regime in the country is that of workers’ power aris-
ing from a proletarian revolution.

But even from a cursory knowledge of the various stages in the
evolution of the buffer countries since the end of the war, it is
clear that the existing social relations in these countries did not
result from a proletarian revolution. What we witnessed instead was
the Stalinist strangulation of the revolution, the establishment not
of workers’ power, but of bourgeois stateg.

The nationalizations and the purges of the capitalist elements
which followed at the next stage have been purely bureaucratic police
measures. But while a bureaucracy is capable of degenerating and
undermining a revolution, it is not capable of substituting itself
for the proletariat and making the revolution. The Kremlin bureau-
cracy knows this very well. This is why its objective in the buffer
countries can only be their total incorporation or assimilation into
the Soviet Union so that every phase of life in these countries
becomes no different from the Soviet Union. It is in this connection,
in connection with assimilation, that we speak of the still formid-
able differences in the existing political, social and economic rela-
tions inside the buffer countries as compared to the Soviet Union.
These differences should not be dismissed. On the contrary, we must
realize that all of Stalin's elaborate schemes may well blow up sky
high in his attempts to resolve precisely these differences. This is
not merely a hypothesis but verifiable fact. We have already seen
this happen both in the case of Yugoslavia and Finland. Yugoslavia,
because of the revolutionary origin of the regime, resting on the
popular masses, simply refused to be assimilated and has embarked on
an independent course. In Yugoslavia it was the revolutionary prole-
tariat which proved too tough to crack. In Finland, on the contrary,
it was the bourgeoisie.

I said at the beginning that we all seem to be in general agree-
ment on the facts concerning the evolution of the buffer countries.
It is more accurate to say that we had been in agreement on the facts
until recently. But now that the minority is seeking to Justify its
position on the buffer countries, it is compelled to revise the facts
to bring them somewhat closer into harmony with what it conceives to
be the end result of the developments there, that is, workers states.
The comrades of the minority are faced with a hurdle they cannot
surmount: their "workers states" have come into existence not by
means of proletarian revolution but through bureaucratic counter-
revolution. How square this with our Marxist concepts of the prole-
tarian revolution?

They are fully aware, for example, that the origin of the Soviet
Union in the October Revolution is an inseparable part of our defini-
tion of the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers state. They have
tried to overcome this difficulty in two ways, both equally dangerous.
On the one hand, some of them try to minimize the importance of
origin. This is very dangerous because such a course can only lead
them into the trap of "bureaucratic revolution." That would be the
unavoidable conclusion of such an argument pursued to its logical
end.

Some comrades of the minority must surely be aware of this trap.
So they have tried to provide themselves with an escape hatch. They
have suddenly discovered that we did in effect have a proletarian
revolution of sorts in the buffer countries. This revolution appar-
ently escaped even the minority up to the present. But once they
embraced the workers state concept for the buffer countries, they had,
so to speak, cataracts removed from their eyes and can now peer into
the past and see clearly what none noticed before. Let us examine
these new claims and see if they are real or only a mirage.

I must refer once again to-Comrade Hansen's article. He bases
himself in his argument on quotations from Comrade Trotsky's writing
One of these is from an article written for the
St, Louis Post Dispatch in January 1940. It reads as follows:

"In order to include Finland in the framework of the USSR --and
such is now the obvious aim of the Kremlin -- it is necessary to
Sovietize her, i.e., carry through an expropriation of the higher
layer of the landowners and capitalists. To accomplish such a revolu-
tion in the relations of property is impossible without a civil war.
The Kremlin will do everything in order to attract to its side the
Finnish industrial workers and the lower stratum of the farmers. Once
the Moscow oligarchy finds itself compelled to play with the fire of
war or revolution. it will try, at least to warm its hands. It will
undoubtedly achieve certain successes in this way." (Internal Bulle-
tin, Vol. XII, No. 2, page 25.) .

Comrade Hansen then goes on to explain how the bureaucracy has

been warming its hands at the fires of war or revolution in the buffer

countries. The trouble is, it is necessary to do violence to the
facts to make them fit this quotation. This prognosis of the Old
Man's did not, as everyone knows, come to pass in Finland either in
l9#O or in the postwar period. In 1940 the Kremlin was frustrated by
