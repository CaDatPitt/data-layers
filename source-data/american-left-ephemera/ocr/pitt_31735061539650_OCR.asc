answered. But then the answer could only read to the effect that the
increased power of the Secon-d International meant increased power of
the bourgeoisie, that “increased power ” of the Second International
meant increased power of the international organization of imperialism,
the League of Nations, whose agency the Second International has been
ever since its reestablishmenttvafter the World War. ‘

The openly eﬁec-tevd split in the Second International which, in any
case, was by nature a body sulﬁciently rent since 1914 by the national
interests of the bourgeoisie, did not come unexpectedly; least of all did
it surprise the leaders of the Second International. In the very same
article in which Vandervelde "made his exalted declaration concerning
the good fortune of the Second International (Kampf, July-August, 1931),
he was forced to allow the uninitiated to peep behind the scenes of the
Second International. This peculiar “ internationalism ” contained
within itself, even at the peak of its fortunes, the lustily sprouting _seeds
of disintegration of the Second International. Vandervelde expatiated
on this “ internationalism ” of his International as follows:

“I could cite new proofs from all countries showing to what extent
we are to-day, now that Social—Democracy has become a real mass
party, up to our necks in social patriotism. When some time ago in
the Belgian Chamber we did our international duty in the struggle
against the armament credits (i.e., when the Social—Democratic Party
made a manceuvre to cause the fall of the government and thus _be
able to create a new government coalition in which Social—Dernocracy
would be included——B. K.) a Social—Democratic member of the Cham-
ber declared that since the War he had never sha/{en hands with a
German. At almost the same time one of our German comrades in
a Commission of the Reichstag stated that in the question of national
defence--—he stood on the side of General Groner against the Com-
munists. One must have read the speeches delivered at the last
French Party Conference in Tours to realize against what resistance
Léon Blum, Lebas, Vincent Auriol and Paul F aure had to ﬁght when,
on the same question of national defence, they made efforts to have
unanimous resolutions passed." (Emphasis mine.—B. K.)

To illustrate this “ internationalism ” on the part of the Second Inter-
national and its sections, it suﬂices to supplement this description of
Vandervelde’s by sta-ting that the unanimous resolutions for the adop-
tion of which Léon Blum and his comrades exerted themselves by no
means exclude the “duty of national defence.” On the contrary, on the
question of national defence, Léon Blum and his comrades stand no less
on the side of General Weygand, Chairman of the French war council,
against the French Communists, than their German colleagues stood
on the side of General Groner and stand to—day on the side of Hitler.

They have merely thought -to maintain their capacity to manoeuvre, in
order to be able to exploit the vote on the military credits of French
imperialism for smaller or bigger political deals with the bourgeoisie.

II
OLD TREASON——NEW DISINTEGRATION

The policy of the Second International and all its Parties in the post-

war period has been to declare permanent the policy of August 4, 1914.
This applies to the time when the Second and Two-and-a-Half Inter-
nationals were still marching separately, in order to ﬁght jointly—-like-
wise in conjunction with their bourgeoisies——against the revolutionary
liquidation of the results of the war, against the proletarian revolution.
It is no less applicable to the developments subsequent to the unity con-
gress of the Second and Two-an«d—a-Half Internationals in 1923, when
they and their sections all considered the time had come to unite openly
in lining up with the bourgeoisie. Open and concealed class collabora-
tion, co—operation with their own bourgeoisie in all questions of national
and international policy, support for all essential measures of the bour-
geoisie aimed at overcoming the post—war crisis of capitalism at the
expense of the toilers—-from the system of ar-bitrating disputes to
rationalization and suppression of economic struggles by armed force——
disarming of the working class, surrender of their arms (with which the
fascist gangs were equipped), condemnation of proletarian force, while
simultaneously supporting the employment of -the force of the hour-
geoisie against the revolutionary working class, ‘support of the inter-
national organization of imperialism, the League of Nations, on the
basis of the Versailles robber peace system, support———concealed or open,
according to circumstances—of the preparation of imperialist war for the
re-division of the world——this has been the work of the Second Inter-
national in the post-war period, from its re—establishment to i-ts recent
disintegration, which, as we shall see, had‘ necessarily to occur in con-
sequence of the entire present international development.
‘To speak of the recent treason of the Second International, or to re-
gard the individual acts of class treason torn out of their historical con-
text, would be to misunderstand completely the nature of the Second
International, which these acts exposed during and after the war. Such
a conception would allow that since the war the Second International
has improved and has adopted new tactics.

During the war, Lenin summed up the collapse of the Second Inter-
national in 1914 in the following manner:

“ The collapse of the Second International came into the clearest
relief in the ﬂagrant betrayal by the majority of the oﬂicial Social-

[9]

Democratic Parties of Europe of their convictions and of their solemn
Stuttgart and Baslc resolutions. However, this collapse, which means
the complete victory of opportunism, the transformation of the Social-
Democratic Parties into National—Liberal Labour Parties, is only a
result of the entire historical epoch of the Second International, which

  

covers the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth‘

century. The objective conditions of this epoch——a ‘transition period
from the completion in Western Europe of bourgeois and national
revolutions to the beginning of Socialist revolutions-gave birth to
and nurtured opportunism. . . . . The crisis that was created by the
great war has torn off the coverings, has cast away the conventions, has
opened the abscess that had long ago become ripe, and has shown

opportunism in its true role as an ally of the bourgeoisie.” (Page 52,

War and Second International, Vol. II, Little Lenin Library.)

The history of the Second International in the post-war period is by
no means the history of a “ new ” betrayal, and its disintegration repre-
sents just as little the consequence of a “ new ” betrayal. Rather, in the
entire history of the Second International, in all its deeds-—during the
whole period of capitalism’s post-war crisis, during the period of in-ten-
siﬁed struggle of the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples
against irnperialism—we find the old treason continued in permanence,
to be sure on a correspondingly higher plane. The Second International
will always surrender the proletariat to the bourgeoisie in accordance
with the prevailing form of the latter’s policy.

Since its re-establishment the Second International has not been more
than a superﬁcial association of nationalist social—chauvinist parties, each
one of which has fought against the revolution of the working class in
its own country, against the national revolution in the colonies of its
own imperialism, in alliance with its own bourgeoisie. Each one of its
sections has helped its own capitalism, crushed by the war, to get on
its feet again at any price, at the expense of the working class. For
these parties the purport of an international organization was-besides
the duping (masquerading as proletarian internationalism) of the work-
ing masses aspiring to international solidarity in the struggle against

. capitalism—--the very same endeavour that moved the individual "im-

perialist powers to collaborate internationally. The purpose of the in-
ternational collaboration of the imperialist powers was to create the in-
ternational prerequisites for overcoming the post-war crisis of capitalism
by “ peaceful T’ means. The organization of the League of Nations was
a part of the Versailles work of robbery, a part set up to conduc-t a
struggle against the proletarian and national revolutions. The inter-
national organization of the Social—Democratic Parties had as its pur-
pose in no less degree than the international collaboration of the “im-

[10]

   
 
 

perialist bourgeoisie—the international assembling of forces to fight
against the revolutionary labour movement, against the Soviet Union,

‘against the‘ threatening proletarian and colonial revolutions, against

world bolshevism, To further the national, imperialist interests of their
own bourgeoisie within the scope of this international organization was
in no less degree the object of the individual Social—Democratic Parties
of the Second International, just as it was the object of the governments
of the individual imperialist powers in the League of Nations, Where the
policy of different imperialist countries has been not infrequently repre-
sented by “ former and future ” members of the Executive of the Second
International. The members of the Executive of the Second Inter—
national have been, for the time of their ministerial activities, freed from
the exercise of their functions on the Executive (this was a concession to
the “ principle of the class struggle ”), in order to enable them to pursue
their principal occupation, the representation of the interests of their own
bourgeoisie. The I-Iendersons, de Brouckeres, Paul Boncours and other
leaders of the Second International, including also Vandervelde, have
taken the chair alternately in the Bureau of the‘ Second International
and its commissions, and in the Council and the commissions of the
League of Nations.

It is no accident that the disintegration of the Second International
becomes apparent at a moment when the preparation of imperialist war
and the partition of China have already proceeded to such an extent that
the existence of the League of Nations has been gravely menaced by the
withdrawal of Japan, the collapse of the Disarmament Conference and
the negotiations on the creation of an organization of the leading im-
perialist powers, which is to stan-d above the League of Nations.
It is no accident that the sharpening of imperialist aritagonisrns which

— has already arrived at a decisive stage, as well as the re—grouping of the

imperialist powers, in the shadow  «direct war prepa'ration=s for the
re—division of the world, for the alteration of the Versailles frontiers
and of the spheres of interest in the Far East as laid down by the
Washington agreement, have accentuated at the same time the an-
tagonisms within the Second International. With the crisis of the
League of Nations the disintegration of the Second International, too,
has begun.

VVhen the Second International-eby uniting the  social-
imperialists and the former social—paciﬁsts———was pasted tdgetlier 
the words uttered by Kautsky in 1914: “ the International can bnly be an
instrument of peace,’_’ still lived in the memory of many Social-Dlemolcratic
workers. They still remembered how the Second International collapsed
with the ﬁrst blast from the imperialist World War; they rcmetﬁbéréa

how in the trenches they were driven to despair, not only physically by

I ‘the hardships of war, but also morally by the “ carry on ” policy of _thc
So_cial-Democratic Parties. Now in order the better to be able to
deceive the internationally minded masses of Social—Dernocratic workers,
A the Statutes of the Socialist Labour International, which in other re-
fgjf spects are a feeble imitation of the Statutes‘ of the League of Nations,
 , were made to contain one point, according to which the International

' . will stick together even in the event of war. This famous fourth point
of the Statutes reads:

5

 

l

 A “The Socialist Labour International is not only an instrument for
ll the tasks of peace, but likewise an indispensable instrument during
 any war.”
' The Second International, however, cannot even last out the period of
_[ peace. It is already in the condition of being badly split before the
 military advance of the imperialist armies has even begun. A sudden
r turn in the direction of regrouping the imperialist powers for the direct
preparation of war has sufficed to compel some Social-Democratic Parties,
German Social-Democracy among them, to come out openly for the war
ii aim: of their bourgeoisie, and to cause the Second International, in time
ft’ of peace, to fall asunder into two or three groups.

  

III
 SAVE WHAT CAN BE SAVED

Individual parties of the disintegrating Second International are still
trying to save all that can be saved, to‘ a certain extent in order to
satisfy the “honour,” the “internationalism” of the Socialist Labour
International. The unevenness in the development of the domestic and
foreign policy of the various imperialist powers makes it necessary for
the various Social—Democratic Parties, also, to adopt correspondingly ,
different attitudes to the questions of the International. Whereas German L  —
Social-Democracy after the taking of oﬂice by Hitler is no longer able to I 7
maintain even the pale semblance of its “ internationalism,” French “
Social-Democracy is still able to continue its support of the war policy I
of the “left” bloc government under the mask of paciﬁsm. That is
why Otto Wels and German Social-Democracy had to take the initiative
in. destroying the Second International and that is why Léon Blum and
French Social-Democracy are able to play the role of the saviours of
the international.

 

' Otto Wels, Chairman of the German Social—Democratic Party, was .
the first to resign from the Bureau of the Second International. The . M. _
signiﬁcance of his action is in no way altered by the fact that a few ' L
weeks later Wels declared this resignation a manoeuvre, and resumed

[:21

   

  

 

 

 

  

   

his mandate. His withdrawal was approved by the Social-Democratic
Party with the following justification:

“ The Executive Committee considers the conduct of Wels justified,

because. the decisions of the Bureau of the Socialist Labour ’I_nter— y

national, besides political measures, also deal with organizational

measures which have been adopted without the collaboration of

German Social—Democracy. The German Social-Democratic Party

must decline the responsibility for the decisions thus adopted.”

Up to now neither the Executive of the International nor any of the
Parties aﬂiliated to it has in any way reacted to this very important event
in the Second International. (We write these lines on April 30."-B.K.).
A number of Social-Democratic Party Conferences have taken place
since the withdrawal of the German Social-Democratic Party from the
Second International (in France, Switzerland and Austria) but not one
of them has uttered a single word concerning such a great event as the
virtual withdrawal of the most powerful section.

Even the resolutions of the Bureau of the Second International, which
for \Vels and his Party were the oﬁicial pretext for their retirement from
the Socialist Labour International, do not contain any seriously critical
remarks on the policy of German Social—Democracy towards the Hitler
government, much less a deﬁnite condemnation of its open support of
fascism. .

The first of these resolutions—which were the occasion for the With-
drawal of Wels-— gave a lukewarm reply to the speech of the Reichstag
incendiary, the present premier of Prussia, Goring, which the latter
delivered before the foreign journalists on the subject of the “ atrocities
propaganda ” against the Hitler government, and in which he spared
no threats against international Social—Democracy on account of this
“ atrocities propaganda.” The second resolution referred to the appeal of
the Communist International, proposing to its sections to submit united
front proposals to the Social-Democratic Parties for a common waging
of the struggle against fascism and the offensive of capital. The resolu-
tion of the Bureau of the Second International prohibits the Social-
Democratic Parties from organizing common actions against fascism, as
well as from conducting negotiations on the establishment of an anti-
fascist united front, under the rather obvious pretence that such negoti-
ations on a national scale should be preceded by negotiations between the
Communist International and the Second International.

If these resolutions involved an “interference in the internal affairs ”
of the German Social-Democratic Party, this “interference ” could only
be construed in the sense that the German Social-Democratic Party was
not to conduct negotiations with the German Communist Party in regard
to a common struggle against the dictatorship of Hitler. The Social-

[I3]

 

 

Democratic Party of Germany left no one in doubt concerning its ever
having had the intention of ﬁghting fascism, It has provided clear

proofs that Social-Democracy must inevitably collaborate with every .

party of -the bourgeoisie in order to be able to save capitalism. The
National Socialist Party is as little an exception to this rule as any other
bourgeois party with which German S.ocial—Demo.CIacy formed an open
coalition. The decisive days of July 20, 1932, and Ianuary 30, 1933,
when German .Social—Democracy ﬂatly rejected the offers of the Com-
mtlnist Party to organize a general strike against the advance of fascism,
leave no «doubt that the Executive Committee of the Social—Democratic
Party did not dream of even entering into negotiations regarding the
united front proposal of the C.P.G. to organize the anti—fascist struggle.

In connection with the resolutions of the Second International the
question was one of interference in the internal affairs of Hitler Germany,
in the‘ common cause of Hitler and German Social-Democracy. German
Social—De_mocracy feels -it -has coalesced with the Germany of Hitler-not-
withstanding everything. The form of collaboration with the bour-
geoisie _has changed in so far as the Social—Democratic leaders, the small
and the big party bosses, have been ousted from their well—paid jobs in
the state apparatus, in the municipalities, in the health insurance, etc.,
and have even been removed from the trade unions. The self—disband—
ment of the “ Reichsbanner ” organizations of the “ Hammerschaften ”*
and for that matter even of Social—Democratic Party organizations is a
‘proof that Socia1—Democracy is no longer capable of severing its
connections with the bourgeoisie, in view of the danger of the
sncial revolution. To the _Social-Democratic Parties in the service
of Erench -imperialism it seemed proper to propagate their “ inter—
national” vdispleasure against German imperialism arming for a war of
revenge.

'5I?he internationalism of Social—Democracy represents merely a tempor—
a1‘.y,_external connection,‘ regulated according to the diplomatic objects of
the moment, between the Social—Democratic parties of various countries,
whereas -the nationalism of Social—Democracy, its dependence upon its
own bourgeoisie, is part of the inmost nature of socialfascism. This is
why the Social—Democracy of Germany has offered no resistance to the
-pressure put upon it by its own bourgeo1sie—represented for the time
being by Hitler——to deal the first blow to the swaying structure of the
Second International and to bring about its collapse.

“The Socialist Labour International is a living reality only to the
extent that its resolutions in all international questions are binding on

"“ “ Reichsbanner ” and “ Harnmerschaften ” were Social—Democratic
defence organizations.—Ed.

all its parts," the Statutes of the .,seeondInternat_ioaa1te11us= “Every

resolution of the International organization means, therefore, a self-

willed restriction of the autonomy of the Parties of the individual
countries."

There is not a single case in the whole history of the Second Inter,-
national in which this ‘7 self-willed. restriction 05 31¢ a_11t0I10mY Of the
parties of the individual countries " has bﬁcornc 3 .faCt- N0 50531‘
Democratic Party has all0.W.€d. i..£.:$.¢1f 129 hi? féstlficted ill its natimlal
interests, save in those cases in which the bourgeoisie itself prescribe
this. ‘

Even in time of peace, German Social.-Democracy will not allow itself
to be restricted in its autonomy with regard to support of Hitler and the
coming national war of Germany, will not allow itself to be restricted
by any forces external to the German nation, by any International.
Even the most outrageous fascist terror on the part of Hitler will not be
able to deter it from this. This is a matter between itself and Hitler,
who, after al1~a7id this is recognized even by Léon Blum-—came to
power by detnocratic means.

The disintegration of the Second International, started by German
$o£ia;l,—Demoeraey, must nevertheless be “explained” to the working
masses, The Second International must still be defended, must be saved.

Leon Blum contends that even after the withdrawal of German Social—
Democracy, tbs? Second International can still be useful. Peace still
§¥_i$,t$. V Painlevé, who has been French War Minister on several occasions,

vdeelared only 3 short time ago that this summer it will not yet come

 Q roar. Until the fall, perhaps even later, a “ rump ” International may
still be used as an “instrument of peace.” Even in war time it may
.serve for winning over to the side of French imperialism and its allies
certain “ neutral ” Social—Democratic Parties. By defending the “inter-
national idea " French Social-Democracy has been able to keep up before
the Workers the appearance that it votes for the military budget of
French imperialism only occasionally, in order to save precisely the
paciﬁsm of Franee, this “ entrenchment of democracy” in Europe.

Therefore a fairy tale must be spun in regard to the dissolution of the
Second; International. There are forces at work which try to explain
this dissolution by tmical d-iﬁercncc: of opinion between German Social-
Democracy and tilt Social.-Democracies of other countries. Thus Léon
Blum writes in the Arbeiterzeitwrzgz ~

" This 1/.1f1.'taal breaking.-oﬁﬁ of relation: (i.e., between the German

party and the Second International——B_.K.) correspond; in fact to a

dzﬁarence of opinion existing between the two, to a diﬂerencc in

azctg,-5."

This is as much as, to say that German Socia1—Democracy goes too for

[Is]

 

 

in supporting its own bourgeoisie; the other parties, on the other hand-
at least those whose countries group themselves round democratic
Franc.e—are not _willing or do not like to go as far as their German
comrades. They do not support fascism and will not support -it, even if
their bourgeoisie should resort to the methods of fascism.

The question is therefore framed like this: Fascism or Democracy.
Things are put as if there had arisen differences of opinion on .this
question between the Second International and German Social-
Democracy. From the putting of this question and the political and
tactical conclusions derived from it, it is then intended to draw the
tactical line of demarcation between ‘Léon Blum and Otto Wels, Iouhaux
and Leipart, Vandervelde and Stampfer. ’

The fairy tale that is being woven round the dissolution of‘ ‘the
Second International, namely, that this dissolution is a result of tactical
diﬂerences of opinion between its national sections, ‘is the saving means
by which the dissolving Second International is to be kept alive at
least for a short time until the outbreak of a new imperialist war.
Nothing, however, is further from the truth than this fairy tale.

The reason for the disintegration of the Second International is not y
that its national parties apply diﬂerent kinds of tactics and that, owing
to this, diﬁerences of opinion have arisen between them. On the contrary,
the reason for the renewed disintegration of the Second International
is at present, just as during the war, that all its parties apply the
same tactics, that their attitude towards their own bourgeoisie, towards
their own proletariat, towards the war preparations of their hi’
own and the foreign bourgeoisie, towards fascism and towards
proletarian revolution is one and the same. This attitude, these tactics
are expressed in a more or less developed form corresponding to the
different degrees of ripeness of the revolution, in the different countries
and to the different foreign political relations of the individual imperialist
countries. The basis of this policy, however, is the same: solidarity
with their own bourgeoisie and hostility to the proletarian revolution.

Thus as time proceeds it is not the diﬁerences in tactics which become
unbearable for the Second International, but the similarity of attitude
on the part of the Social-Democratic. Parties in each country towards
their own bourgeoisie. It is this which was expressed in the renewed dis-
integration of the Second International, in a new. stage of history, at
a time when the post-war crisis of capitalism has reached a "stage at
which the old connections and relations between the individual imperi-
alist powers are being severed. At this stage the bases of the capitalist
system’s world political order of the Versailles peace treaties are already
undermined, and a regrouping of the imperialist world for -the un— 
chaining of imperialist world war is on the order of the day. The

[15]

  

 

   

 

   

C

existence of capitalism is threatened anew by revolutions and wars. This
is what wemean by the expression: the end of capitalist stabilization.

Those. leaders of the Second International who believe that their
political business interests still require them to stock the commodity
Social—Democratic Internationalism, are now endeavouring to explain
the withdrawal of German Social-Democracy from the Socialist Labour
International, its open expressions of solidarity with Hitler’s policy, as
demonstrated in Potsdam, and its defence of Hitler’s dictatorship before
international public opinion as the original sin of German Social-
Democracy. The lost virginity of German Social-Democracy is lamented
by many leaders of the Second International.

All the arts of parliamentary lawyers are employed in order to remove _

the common responsibility for the Social—Democracy of Germany-or
at least for its present actions-—.from the Second International as a whole
and from its sections. The whole Social—Democratic press has been
mobilized in order to make the workers in France, Belgium, Czecho-
Slovakia, England and other countries believe that the road of German
Social-Democracy from Weimar to Potsdam, from Ebert to Hitler, is
the road of one that walks alone, of a solitary wanderer. This fairy
tale of the “ poor sinner Social—Democratic Party of Germany ” is
intended to save the honour of the Second International as a whale.
. Every Communist must say: Be on your guard, Social,-Democratic
workers! The road of German Social-Democracy is the road of the
whole Second International, however differently the various Socialv

Democratic Parties may be utilized by the bourgeoisie to push forward

fascization l . ,

IV

GERMAN S'OC'IAL—I§EMOCRACY IS: S(i)CIAL-DEMOCRACY IN
ITS PUREST FORM

‘V The shipwreck of German Social-Democracy and of the German

reformist trade unions, their open capitulation to Hitler and their actual
secession from the international organizations signify a heavy blow to the
Second International and all its national parties.

The Social-Democratic workers in all countries rightly raise the
question: How has it come to this? How could it happen that the
party, which has defended bourgeois democracy with such tenacity and
ruthlessness againstproletarian dictatorship, did not raise a ﬁnger against
the setting up of the dictatorship _of Hitler?

; The Second International and its leaders avoid any attempt at an
analysis of the German events, at an investigation of the tactics of
German, Social-Democracy. They appeal to future historians, and are

I I7 ]

 ,.,,;—,_.,, _, _. -w .

content to indicate that the German workers’ movement was split, and,
in consequence, the Hitler dictatorship was bound to arise.

Warned by the Hitler terror and by the capitulation of Social-
Democracy in Germany,but also by the conduct of their own leaders’
who continue to make compacts with onward storming fascism in
Austria, some delegates to the Party Conference of Austrian Social
Democracy on April 16, 1933, gave voice to their desperation: Do not
the tactics of Austro—MarXism (this fungus of a clique of the rottenest
Social—Democratic leaders, who have constantly posed as a “ Left "
wing in the Second International) lead the very way as that marked
out by German Social—Democracy?

In the face of the warning example of Germany, Otto Bauer could
give to this despairing cry no other answer than that things in Austria
were not yet so bad as in Germany, the relations were not yet
so far developed. Only, no employment of the last resource, no em-
ployment of force on the part of the proletariat. It would be an
exaggeration “if one were to say that already the path inevitably leads
to fascism in Austria ”—-thus, hoarse and timid, came the answer of
the shrivelled Otto Bauer, as if from the interior of an ice—chest, in

  

 

which he, together with his theories and the Program of the Social- O

Democratic Party of Austria, had been placed by order of Dolfuss,

Otto Bauer raises, then, the question of the inevitability of the
development to fascism. It follows from his speech that the triumph of
Hitler in Germany was unavoidable. What else could his assertion
that Austria’s path does not yet inevitably lead to fascism mean?

Otto Bauer cannot get out of it without deception. He puts the
question as if in Germany, and also in Austria, the advance of fascism,
the inevitability of its triumph, is dependent only on objective forces,
forces independent of the working class. This deception serves to defend
German, as well as Austrian, Social-Democracy.

How is it with thelinevitability. of the development to fascism in
reality, that reality which has to be veiled by the Second International?

Doubtless it is not determined by the working class whether and when
the bourgeoisie gives preference to fascist methods over bourgeois-
democratic methods.’ Imperialism is an age of political reaction and
the post-war crisis has still further developed this attribute of im-
per ialism.

“The political superstructure of the new economy, of monopolist
capitalism (imperialism is monopolist capitalism)”——-wrote Lenin in
his article A Caricature of Marxz':m——“ is a turning from democracy
to political reaction. To free competition democracy corresponds, to
monopoly political reaction . . . .”

From this, of course, it by no means follows that the bourgeoisie,

war period in Germany, the cripplingof the forces of the worlcing class
and therewith the victory of fascism—-in view of the relation of forces
between the Social-Democratic Party and the Communist Party
necessarily follow. Not for the working class, but for the bourgeoisie,
was the path to fascism objectively determined. Since, however, the
path of Social—Democracy is the path of the bourgeoisie,‘ Social-
Democracy inevitably became a fellow—traveller of the bourgeoisie to
fascism. ' . * ‘

V In other countries the inevitability of development to fascism is
likewise by no means determined for the working class. The Germany
of a higher fascist development does not necessarily present «to the
countries whose bourgeoisies still prefer bourgeois-democratic to fascist
methods, a picture of their own future. The question of the inevitability
of fascism was and will only be decided by the tactics of Social—
Democracy. The working class in other landscan avert the “German
fate,” if it rejects the Social—Democratic tactics, and will restore‘ in time
the united front for the struggle against fascism. But if Social-
Democracy retains its inﬂuence over the majorityof the working class,
where this is the case and at the moment when the bourgeoisie decides
to combat the crisis of capitalism and the proletarian revolution and
prepare for imperialist war ‘by repressing the class movement of the
workers through fascist methods, there and then development to fascism
can become inevitable. I ‘ ‘ ' A

The fate of the German working class, which has temporarilybefallen

lated into different tongues—,—the music of the by ‘no means ' distant

mention shall be made,” enlightened people already wrote in the dark
Middle Ages. ‘ . i '

But how can it be ‘denied that the classic seat of Social-Democracy,
not only’ before the war, but also in the post—war period, was precisely
Germany?

V If one is to consider Social-Democracy in its pure culture then it is
just the sway of German Social-Democracy to which one must pay re-
gard. The Social—Democratic Party of Germany has been politically
active in a country of highly developed capitalism, where all thematerial
prerequisites of socialism are suﬂiciently to hand. It operated in a land
where there is a working class powerful in numbers. It has developed
its activity in a land where the class antagonisms are the most acute and
the class struggle has taken the sharpest forms; where SociaI—Democracy
and the reformist ‘trade unions have, in comparison with all other
countries, embraced the largest masses organizationally and had these
behind them politically. Even in the Hitler elections of March 5, 1933,
German ‘Social-Democracy polled about eight million votes. In Germany
the leaders, the staff of functionaries of Social—Democracy, have climbed
the highest rungs that are attainable in a bourgeois state by upholders
of this state. The Social—Democratic Party of Germany had approxi-

Amately 300,000 public functionaries in its ranks. It had built up the

most powerful and influential labour bureaucracy. It had earned the
greatest, possible credit for saving the capitalist system and the bour-
geois state; it created a complete constituti.on of a great realm, the
Weimar Constitution, in its image. By it the entire Second International
swore to show the democratic way to socialism. German Social-
Democracy was the “ civilized opposite pole,” to “ Bolshevism of Tartar

origin I”

on the basis of the German experiences, has not the priceless Kautsky
reported as late as February of this year (Kampf, 1933, No. 2, p. 48):

“ Democracy islnot merelya way to the socialist goal, but is itself
part of this goal, which desires for all not merely wel1—being but also
liberty and equality of rights." (Emphasis mine———B.K.). ’

German SociaI—Democracy has, even better than the English Labour
Party, the Belgian, Polish, Swedish, Danish and other Social-Democrats,
who, as ministers, administered the affairs of the bourgeoisie, succeeded
in making the broad masses of workers believe that participation of
SociaI—Democracy in the management of the bourgeois state apparatus
is equivalent" to participation "of the working class in the power of the
bourgeois state. No other Social—Democratic Party has been quite so

"successful as the German Social—Democracy in persuading the workers

 

that the democratic-istate " embodies, not the power of a class,’_’ but the

[.21]

 

 

   

division of power among the classes, between the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie. ‘
. A president at the head of the Republic, whose candidature was en-
dorsed by Social-Democracy; Social-Democratic ministers in the govern-
ment of the greatest state of Germany, Prussia, and also in other states;
many dozens of provi.ncial governors, district councillors, the highest state ,,
officials and--what is-most important——police chiefs in the biggest towns, 
police oﬂicers organized in free trade unions and friendly intercourse A
daily with Reichswehr generals—was all this not power accordingto the if
conception of the whole Second International? Did not this, in the
view of the leaders of the Second International, signify the power of the
workers, in contrast to Bolshevik Russia, where “ a dictatorship over the _ __
working class holds sway?” Before Iuly 20, 1932, which of the leaders 5
of the --Second International warned the. German working class .by
telling it: that this power of Social—Democracy was so constituted that it
might be overthrown in twenty-four hours? t . . , .
And, in fact, Social-Democracy in Germany was not overthrown; it
was dismissed. ‘ ‘ -
Dismissed like a courtier, a valet, a portier, . . .
And ‘then, in harmony with the propaganda requirements of "‘ the
‘fascist dictatorship treated to the kicks of the fascist boot!”
Even after its dismissal it demeaned itself entirely as such. It
haggledv with its master over the size of its pension; it appealed.to the
gratitude owed it by the bourgeoisie for long, and faithful services
rendered; it brought actions in the Supreme Court; .it threatened and
blackrnailed the bourgeoisie; only one thing it would not do; it would
not fight against its former master. The dismissed Social-Democratic
Party of Germany did not go down in the ﬁght against fascism; it
collapsed under the ingmtitude of the bourgeoisie. The bond of its
‘S ﬁdelity to its master, to German capital, could not, however, bcibroken
 its fascist successors. This Otto Wels,‘ the Social-Democratic parlia-
mentary fraction in the Reichstag, and the Executive Committee of the
General Federation of Gerrnan‘Trade Unions’ in its May Day appeal have
brilliantly proved.- ~ ; e V . . .
x The Second Intern‘ational, the Social-Democratic parties in all other
lands, must‘ needs give ' some ‘explanation to the workers, to make

'Democ[raey;'~ -. -.‘ ‘ i ‘ C -I  ~ ~‘ - .1
The triumph of fascism in ‘Germany they explain by the split ‘in the 
workers’ movement and’ by the policy of ‘the Communists (we will return“ 
to this base Icalu-mny). The attitude of German Social-Democracy,
however,’  sought "to elucidate by saying that German Social-

[22]

   

  

 

 

Democracy had radically changed its tactics in regard to fascism and
dempcracy.

They thereby seek to make it appear as if the path of German Social—
Democracy were not also the path of the Second International, as if
German Social—Democracy were not “ genuine and true Social-
Democracy.”

Has the Social-Democratic Party of Germany changed its principles,
its policy? Did it adopt different tactics from those of yore, when it
capitulated to fascism‘, publicly ﬂung itself at Hitler's feet, and, at his
command, sufficiently dissociated itself from the Second International?
Has it changed them, or not? I

. Have the Second International as a whole and its national parties
acted in the class struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat on
diﬁcrent principles, have they pursued a different policy from German
Socia~l—Democracy?

These are the two preliminary questions that, after the shipwreck of
German Social—Democracy, must be answered before we can bring to
light the real cause: of the split in the Second International;-which are
carefully concealed by the leaders. These questions must not be answered
merely in Germany, where——thanks to the Social—Democratic Party and
the reformist trade union leaders——instruction on them is given in a
school whose principal pedagogic methods are drawn from those steel
rods of the Storm Troops and Defence Formations piled up under
Scucring, Grczsinski, and Zacrgicbcl, as well as other Social-Democratic
police chiefs. In all countries a correct Marxist answer must be given
to these questions for the common good of the working class, in order
that it may be able to shape its destiny otherwise and avoid what, with
the active cooperation of Social—Democracy, fell to the lot of the working
class in Germany.

«There can be no doubt that considerable sections of the German
working class, which, after Ianuary 30, after Potsdam, severed their
connections with ’ the Social—Democratic Party organizationally, still
remain under the ideological inﬂuence of Social—Democracy, and are of
opinion that a better S‘ocial—Democracy than theirs is possible. If, in
consequence of theself-dissolution of the organs of the Social—Democratic
organizations, the German workers now no longer imbibe the poison of
the Social-Democratic press and agitation centres in such quantities as
before, nevertheless the -opium of Social—Democratic ideology still affects
the minds of many, many German iproletarians. All too strong is the
tradition of the Social—Democratic spirit that has grown up in Germany.
The politically and morally finished Social—Democracy constantly
operates" still, and will continue to operate further. Even the National-

[23]

 

 

 

 

    

Socialists help it to do so, when they brand Social-Democrac
representative of Marxism. . V s

“ We suffer not only from the living, we also suffer from the dead,”
wrote Karl Marx. ‘Social-Democracy, even after it is quite dead, which

yas the

‘is not yet the case, will still long poison the air.

. M
TRUE TO ITSELF TO THE VERY END

The first question, then, that has to be answered, reads as follows:
Did the Social-Democratic Party of Germany pursue a diﬁerent policy

 

 

from that of yore, did it change its policy, its principles when it A

capitulated to fascism, publicly flung itself at Hitler’s feet and, at his
command, sufficiently dissociated itself from the Second International?
Did it change them, or not?

From the mild reproaches which are levelled in the direction of
German Social—Democracy by some of the leaders of the Second
International, especially in the countries allied with France, one may
sense that they answer this question in the aﬁirmatit/e. Léon Blum has
left the ﬁnal decision of the question “ whether German Social-
Democracy has looked after the interests of the workers well or other—
wise ” to the "‘ judgment of history;” nevertheless he considers that the
party of Otto Wels has made such concessions to the National—Socialist
Party of Hitler, and taken such a cautious, moderate and, so to speak,
objective attitude in face of Hitler fascism “ as conceal within them-
selves the recognition of the accomplished facts.” V ‘

The alleged turning in the tactics of German Social-Democracy,
with which Blum and his friends cannot, as they say, express solidarity,
would therefore seem to consist in a transition to a “ cautious, moderate

' and, so to speak, objective attitude ” to Hitler fascism. What, however,

was the attitude from which the German Social-Democracy made a
transition to that attitude which has given occasion to Léon Blum’s
taking up a “ critical” position-as to this he affords not the faintest

indication.

Hitler, also, is of entirely the same opinion about the tactics ‘of

German Social—Democracy as those leaders of the Second International

who-—at least since Hitler’s triumph-——essay to humbug their proletarian
public concerning a change in these tactics. Hitler’s answer to Wels
in the Reichstagr You come late; still you come—is nothing else but
a declaration of the kind that Léon Blum has made concerning the
change of attitude of German Social-Democracy to National-Socialism

and its policy. Only, he is of opinion that Social-Democracy has taken

this turn in the direction of the “ National Revolution ” too late.

[24]

 

 

The leader of the Second International and the leader of fascism, in
Germany-—Léon Blum and Adolf Hitler-—do the Party of German
social—fascism a like injustice.

The Executive Committee of the German Social-Democracy has not
yet answered this charge made by Hitler and the Second International.
The press prohibition of the fascist government comes as a timely aid
to German Social-Democracy, just as the censorship during the W'orld
War did, when the Social—Democratic leaders were given the possibility
of shrouding themselves in silence until such times as “certain diffi-
culties could be overcome,” and they could write openly what was
commanded by Hindenburg and Ludendorff. V ,

Truth, however, will not be buried. It will out, if not by way
of the Social-Democratic Party press, then through the organs of the
trade unions, which have now been fascized by Hitler. It was,spoken
in the iofﬁcial organ of the General Federation of German Trade
Unions (since subjected to assimilation by fascism), the Gewerk-
sclzaftszeitung, in an article entitled “Working Class and National
Revolution ” (April 15, 1933). This ‘truth is intended for the leader of
the “National Revolution,” Hitler; at the same time, however, it
can be considered an answer to the mildireproaches of the Second
International: ‘ I A

" T/ze German Revolution, which began neither on March 5 nor
on Iuly 20, 1932, but in November, 1918, has entered a new stage.”

(Emphasis mine--B.K.). _ '

" In this sentence is stated nothing short of the truth that the
“National Revolution” of Hitler isaa new stage of the “German
Revolution” begun in November, 1918. It is indubitably established
that the November R‘evolutio-n—-—not of the German proletariat, but-
of Scheidemann, Ebert, Noske and Haase, and the “ National Revolu—
tion ” of Hitler—Goering-Goebbels—Rosenberg, are two extremes of one
and the same process of German historical development, which have
a common content. The unbroken connection in the further develop-
ment of German history from November 1918 (and in the sense of the
Ninth of November of Ebert, Scheidemann, Noske and Haase) until
Ianuary 30 and March 5 was not maintained by National-Socialism, but
by Social—Democracy. In other words: Ebert sowed, Hermann
Miiller, Otto We]: and Rudolf Hilferding nursed the growth, and
Hitler-reaped.

Upon the Hitler government's declaration of February I, did‘ not the
Vorwiirts of February 2- (morning edition) give expression to the same
thought, when it commented as follows:

“Herr Adolf Hitler! . . . You spoketof the ‘November crime.’

But without this ‘November crime’ a man from the German work-

[25 J

 

    

., \

. r:~?'sﬁ~.'e5\'

ing class, like you, would never have become chancellor of the

German nation.”

The semi-official article of the Social—Democratic trade union leader-
ship, likewise, does not lack proofs of this when it establishes the
unity of content of Social-Democracy’: November policy and Hitler’:
"National Revolution.” This Social-Democratic trade union leader—
ship proves that the Weimar Republic, with its bourgeois democracy,
represents only a halting place on the road to Hitler’s “ third empire,”
to fascism (The Social—Democratic theorists use the words: “ From
the relativist democracy of the Weimar Republic to the authoritarian
democracy of the Presidential Republic ”): Concerning the task set
the Weimar Republic and performed by Social-Democracy, the article
contains the following: _

“, The first halting place, the Weimar Republic, was determined by
three tasks: that of liquidating the lost war, that of warding off
Bolshevism and that of saving out of the destroyed order what was
still to be saved.”

This sentence contains the pure, unadulterated truth. Only the
sequence should be changed; the warding oﬁ of Bolshevism should
be set out as the first task. The article in no way represents an
unprincipled adaptation to the circumstances of the press under the
Hitler dictatorship. It contains nothing that had not under the
circumstances of the most complete “freedom of opinion and the press
in the Weimar democracy,” as well as under Papen and Schleicher,
been repeatedly and oﬂieially stated before by the most prominent
Social—Democratic leaders, and by all authorities of the Social-Demo
cratic Party and trade unions.

Even before the coup "état of von Papen, did not the General
Federation of German Trade Unions most ofﬁcially declare in its
resolution of Iune 14, I932:

“ All national phraseology aside, the working class was the strong-
est support of the German state in all the perils of the post—war
period.”

What the article of the trade union paper stresses is precisely the
continuity of the national policy of Social-Democracy, and if it has
concealed anything with an eye to the ministry of Goebbels in propa-
ganda matters, then i-t is only, perhaps, the following thought: You
Nation-al—Socialists, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and the rest, could not
yet reach the table with your nose when we, the Social-Democratic
Party and the leading trade union officials, were already ﬁghting for
the national cause of Germany.

We have to set ourselves no all too broadly conceived task in order
to prove that German Social—Democracy and the leadership of the

[25]

  

 

 

~ front, it gave out the slogan of the

reformist trade unions are right when they assert that the “ ﬁrst halting
place, the Weimar Republic,” has fulﬁlled all those tasks which under
changed circumstances, the “ National Revolution ” of Hitler promises
to perform. To prove this, it will not be necessary to relate in detail
the whole post—war history of Germany and German Social-Democracy;
it will be sufficient to adduce some tests of the proposition in order
to show that the Weimar Republic, with its bourgeois democracy,
really forms only the ﬁrst halting place and the preparation for the
second stage of the German counter-revolution, the “ National Revolu-
tion.”

We will not have recourse to the kind of proofs that emanate from
“ doubtful sources.” We will rather let the Social-Democrats them-
selves speak!

The yﬁrst task of the November Revolution and of the Weimar
Republic was, according to the Social Democratic conception, “ to
liquidate the lost war.”

How did Social—Democracy execute this task in November, 1918? It
certainly did not do this in the proletarian way, by way of transforming
the imperialist war into a civil war against the bourgeoisie. No one,
not even Hitler, brings such an accusation against German Social-
Dernocracy. It liquidated the war in the same way as all the other
parties of the Second International: by defending to the last, as best
it could, in the given circumstances of the end of the war, the interests
of its own bourgeoisie, and the interests of its own imperialism. _

In view of the threatened defeat of Wilhelm and Hindenburg at the
“ national uprising ” ﬁfteen years
before the “ National Revolution ” of Hitler.

On October 7, 1918, there appeared in the Social-Democratic Party
papers a semi—oﬂicial article of the Executive Committee of the Party,
a desperate appeal to carry on, that even Goebbels could not have
couched in different terms:

“ . . . then the whole popular representation, the whole people,
the whole army will rally round the Empire’s storm—flag, and draw
out of themselves the utmost strength, anger and love of the father-
land. Then a Ministry of National Defence will stand in solidarity at
the Empire’s disposal.”

On the point of why the Empire’s storm—ﬂag was not unfurled, the
hermit of Doom, Wilhelm II, or that still closer associate of Hitler’s
in the Wilhelmstrasse, Field-Marshal von Hindenburg, can give
particulars.

As to what, after the failure of a “Ministry of National Defence,”
Social-Democracy did to save from the German proletariat for the
German bourgeoisie all that the victorious Entente Powers left, con-

[27]

cerning this, Schei-demann, in his well known book on -the Zusammen-
bruch* (p. 210), has given the following frank account_ without distorting
the facts:

“ Social—Democracy was above all successful in avoiding the blood-
bath that the Ninth of November threatened to become. In the
early morning, before the outcome of the movement was in sight, its
representatives, above all, my friend Wels, went into the barracks,
addressed the soldiers and guided the fearful excitement into bloodless
paths. A single, resolute ofﬁcer corps and the brave admonishers
were settled, aye, the whole movement might have been once more
suppressed. Such an officer corps was as hard to ﬁnd as a commander
loyal to the Monarchy.”

The road to the socialist revolution was open, the collapse of the
Germany of Wilhelm was complete. Wherein did Social—Democracy
perceive its historical mission under the circumstances? Wherein
has it even later, up to -the present day, seen the historical service
it believes it has rendered .in connection with the liquidation
of the lost war? The deceased Chancellor of the Reich and Chairman
of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, Hermann Miiller, was
surely competent to give the answer to this question. At a time when
the Weimar Republic was still in its heyday—therefore when he was
not living under the oppression of Hitler’s dic-tatorship—he wrote about
his friend Ebert, Hindenburg’s predecessor in the presidential chair of
the German republic, as follows (Gesellschaft, 1925, p. 304):

“ Occupying the highest oﬂice in the Reich, Frederick Ebert had
to shoulder one heavy responsibility after another. The first months of
the Presiden=t’s activity were ﬁlled with the struggle for peace.
The champion of a peace by agreement at the right time saw him-
self in the position of having to make a decision upon the dictated
peace of Versailles. He was a convinced opponent of this dictate of
the arrogant victors . . . . When the first National Ministry,that
of Scheidemann——Coun't Brockdorf, resigned because of -the Versailles
Treaty, Frederick Ebert would have dearly loved to have gone with
them . . . . If success was achieved in saving the blood-and—iron
creation of Bismarck from complete dissolution, this was possible
largely for the reason that Frederick Ebert forced himself to stay.”
(Emphasis in the original——B.K.).

On what, however, does Hitler found his “ third empire,” if not on
this blood~a1zd—iron creation of Bismarck’s, whose salvation from the
proletarian revolution Social—Democracy, with full right, regards as its
very own work?

- "‘ Collapse.

[28J

  

 

 

    

Where has a change in the policy of German Social—Democracy
occurred, in face of the national aims of the German bourgeoisie?

The second task which, according both to the earlier and also to the
present conception of Social-Democracy, had to be performed at the
“ Weimar halting—place of the single German revolution,” was that
of “ warding oft’ Bolshevism.”

Did. not German Social-Democracy begin its governmental activity
by driving out the Embassy of the Russian Soviet Republic?

This was the period when German Social-Democracy called for the
formation of the “ Ministry of National Defence ” and for the un-
furling of the imperial storm—ﬂag of Wilhelm’s Germany, and when
Lenin, foreseeing the revolution in Germany, wrote in an instruction
of October 1 as follows:

“ Let us all give our lives to helping the German workers in the
cause of pushing on the revolution beginning in Germany.
Conclusion: Ten times more efforts to raise bread (to collect all
supplies both for as and also for the German worl(ers).” Emphasis
in the original—-B.K.). '
The words of the Bolshevik were followed by deeds. Trains were

got ready and loaded with grain. A semi—oﬂicial report of the Social-
Democratic government announced in this connection on November
11, I918:

“ The Soviet government has offered the new German people’s
Republic consignments of grain, and has also despatched two train-
loads of flour already . . . . The German Government . . . has
declined the offer of the Soviet government, more particularly as the
Entente has held out the prospect of foodstuffs for Germany, and, on

the other hand, the shortage of foodstuffs in -the large "towns of Russia '

is so severe that the population can scarcely survive the winter.”

(Cited from Eberhardt Biicher, Reoolutionsdokumente Revolutionary

Documents).

The first two ﬂour trains were rejected by the Social—Democratic
government. The warding oz? of Bolshevism was thus begun by
Social-Democracy tearing the bread from the mouths of the starving
German workers, in order to be able to conclude the Versailles Peace.

The historical work of German Social-Democracy in warding oﬁ
Bolshevism consisted, further, in its paralysing with its poison the
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Councils, and in ﬁnally strangling them.

With full right, then, Hermann Miiller shed bitter tears at the
Giirlitz Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, as he
declaimed:

" We wish to establish that up to the present we socialists have
received no thanks for holding down Bolshevism. I would also like

[29]

 

to remind the German Nationals of how their leaders haunted the
lobbies of the Weimar Theatre after the putsch of March, 1919, and
asked : -Will Noske really manage it? That was their only care!”

We pass by an endless series of all too well—known facts, which prove
that from 1918-32 the leaders of German Social—Democracy not only
smoothed the way for the Hitler dictatorship, but positively provided the
model which showed the fascists how terror is to he ruthlessly and
bestially employed against the working class. The names of Ebert,
Noske, Wels, Horsing, Severing, Zorgiebel, Grezinski and the rest
will not be eclipsed in the‘ history of the murder of the workers even
after such giants as Hitler, Goring, Count Helldorf, Rohm (and others
of the kidney of the hangmen and hangman’s asistants in the Brown
houses and barracks of the National-Socialists) have acquired their
heritage in the employment of murderous terror against the working
class. Even in the struggle against the murderous terror of Hitler
fascism, which butchers hundreds of the best proletarians, tortures
thousands and casts into jails and concentration camps tens of thousands
and more, the deeds of the Weimar democracy may not slip into
oblivion. The murders of Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Iogiches and
ten thousand German proletarians, which were perpetrated at the
Weimar halting-place of the republic;' the protective arrest, the minor
and major states of siege, the gagging of the workers’ press, the
garrotting of the revolutionary workers’ organizations, of the League of
Red Front Fighters, and the other terrorist measures employed by

Social-Democracy—these will stick in the memory of every decent_

worker, even if such methods of terror are no longer employed in the
name of Weimar democracy, but in the name of National-Socialism.

In the warding off of Bolshevism, Social—Democracy did not conﬁne
itself to preserving for the future what could be saved of the Germany
of Wilhelm and the. force-apparatus of the bourgeoisie: the oﬂicer
corps, the Prussian district councillors from the ranks of the reactionary
Iunlqers and the high police oﬂicials. Every germ of the future fascism
was carefully nursed by Social-Democracy, and protected from the

rebellion of the proletariat. When Hitler did not yet play his role of

leader even within the limits of a larger Munich pot-house, Noske already
protected and screened by all the methods of the state of siege that
organization which at this time formed the reservoir for the future
National Socialist mass movement-—Nthe Citizens’ Guard. His edict
(cited from A Settling of Accounts with the Right Socialists, a pamphlet
by Crispien, now member of the Executive Committee of the Social-
Democratic Party) ran as follows:
“ By reason of p.9 on the state of siege, I therefore prohibit all
economic intimidation and injury (boycott) of members of the

[30]

 

 

 

 

 

Citizens’ Guards and their families, as well as summoning and

inciting to boycott. I further prohibit public and written insult and

intimidation of the Citizens’ Guards in the press and pamphlets.”

No one, not even the braggart Hitler, could deny that, prior to’ 1929,
it would have been an easy thing for the German working class to have
devoured the entire National—Socialist Party, skin, hair and all, had
not Social—Democracy, through its ideological inﬂuence on the majority
of the working class, through the police power of the state machine,
prevented this in the interest of the common struggle against the
proletarian revolution, against Communism. We admit that the Social-
Democratic leaders did not foresee that fascism, which at this time
stood in the position of a reserve behind the counter—revolutionary front
of Social-Democracy—drawn up against the proletarian revolution-
would move up into the very front line for the defence of German
capitalism. This, however, is by no means to say that the tactics of
German Social—Democracy in the face of fascism would have been deter-
mined by anything else but the interests of the bourgeoisie, of the
struggle against the proletarian revolution. That the Social-Democratic
leaders have miscalculated in their reckoning of the prospects of fascist
development, merely shows that political wisdom, political foresight, is
lacking in the arsenal of their weapons. But even if they had come
to see earlier whither the path led, they would still not have been
able to do otherwise than they have done, and do even now, when
fascism is in power. To be able to ward oﬁ‘ Bolshevvism, they disarmed
the proletariat before fascism at the Weimar halting—place. They were
bound to do this! . . _. .

Let us now consider the third task that Social-Democracy, on its own
confession, set itself at the “ Weimar halting-place ” of the transition to
Iuly 20 and Ianuary 30 the task “ of saving out of the destroyed order,
what was to be saved.”

Do we need to say first, that this order was the capitalist order?

German capitalism lay there destroyed, having collapsed under the
blows of four years’ imperialist war. Taken all in all it was only a
heap of ruins. What still remained of an “ element preserving order ”
was——the Social—Democracy, the heads of the reformist trade unions.
Despite the fact that the Social-Democratic Parties (the Majority Party
and the Independents), as well as the heads of the reformist trade

unions, hung with all their weight on the neck of the German working‘

class, nevertheless the latter, even if not in its entirety, did take the
broad highway of proletarian revolution. In spite of all, the German
working class, in its immense majority, trod the path of struggle, of
violent combat, for the improvement of its desperate economic position.
It did not wait until the bourgeois power, composed of Social-Democrats,

[31]

 

 

\

had brought the laws on the eight hours’ day, social maintenance, and
the improvement of labour conditions in the factories, into the ' safe-
keeping of the National Assembly. On their responsibility and without
regard to the law, the workers in every factory, in every district, in
every province of Germany, themselves realized the eight hours’ day,
made the arrangements for social provision, and changed the conditions
of labour. Arms were still in the. hands of the workers—the dismay of
the bourgeoisie had not yet abated. What the working class——without
the aid of Social—Democracy and against its will—-wrung from the
capitalists by revolutionary means, the Social-Democratic legislators
by degrees took back again, so soon as this was possible, and, of course,
hand in hand with the disarming of the workers.

The Social-Democratic leaders and the leading functionaries of the
zrade unions not only plume themselves quite openly on being the sole
saviours of the capitalist order in Germany; they carry on the work of
estoring the economic power of German capitalism, in order to re-
ronquer the old position of German capitalism on the world market.
F hey have, indeed, taken the lead in the struggle for Germany’s future
place in the sun, for the goal which Wilhelm II failed to win in
.he World War and for which Hitler now ﬁghts.

The first thing that “ was to be saved out of the destroyed order”
Jvas co-operation between organizations of employers and employees and
its development through Legien and Stinnes.- Out of this co-opera-tion
grew the system of compulsory arbitration of disputes, which brought
about a further limitation of the right to strike, aimed at realizing
the notorious slogan o r “ class struggle round the table,” and ﬁnally
served as a basis for the trade union leaders’ strike—breakingTpolicy,
a policy that, in the guise ofeconomic democracy, was elevated to a
theory by Hilferding, Naphtali and Tarnow.

The second thing that was to be saved outof the destroyed “_ order ”
was the capacity of German industry to compete in foreign markets, the

creation of the new prerequisites for realizing the new “ urge towards
the East.” -

The demand made by -the German trust magnates for the “lightening
of the social burdens interfering with German industry’s capacity to
compete ” was the argument with which the Social—Democratic Min-
ister for Labour, Wissel, abolished unemployed maintenance and intro-
duced unemployed insurance; with this argument Social—Democracy
heaped upon the shoulders of the working class the burdens of the
miserable unemployed dole. The Social-Democratic Party took the initi-
ative in reducing social insurance, in order to be able to provide
the economis basis for the German bourgeoisie’: new imperialist policy

[32]

 

 

 

 

of expansion, by pillaging the unemployed dole, the sick funds, and
the old age and invalid pensions.

The carrying out of this task also necessitated the cuts in wages and the
capitalist rationalization of industry at the expense of the working
class. Wage—cutting began in Germany under the government of the
Social—Democratic chancellor, Hermann Miller. In the emergency
decrees of the Briining government, Social—Democracy not only “ tolcr—
ated ” what it had begun under the government of Hermann Miiller.
Since the Herman Miiller government, from July, 1929, to August, 1932,
the wage-robbery of the German industrial workers attained a magni-
tude of 19 billion marks. For the whole of the workers and employees,
the wage-cuts during this period are estimated to amount to 38 billion
marks. These wage-cuts were perpetrated, in part, directly by Social-
Democracy and, in part, they were “tolerated ” by it. If two crooks go
burgling and one breaks in while the other watches out, it will not
be appropriate to say that the latter has “tolerated” the, burglary.

At the same time, not to be unmindful of the interests of agrarian—
capital, the Prussian Iunkers were also presented with a charitable gift
by a Social—Democratic food commissioner, Baade, the member of the
Reichstag. The Baade duties raised the price of bread, the bread of the
factory and oﬁice workers, of the petty bourgeoisie and the small
peasants. This was likewise part of the task of saving from destruction
what was to be saved.

If to—day German industry, under Hitler’s leadership, publicly makes
the “Push East” policy again the guiding principle of its foreign
politics, it should not be forgotten that the foundations of this policy
were furnished from the wage cuts and the plundered unemployed, sick
and invalid relief funds, while a twofold and tenfold sweating of the
German worker by capitalist rationalization served as mortar for the
same policy. It would be one of the worst cases of ingratitude in
history, if the bourgeoisie in Germany should forget that it has
effectively carried out all this, in part through Social—Dernocracy directly,
and in part with its active cooperation.

The bourgeoisie changed its methods in Germany when it went over
from bourgeois democracy to fascism, in order to be able to hold down
the proletarian revolution. Social-Democracy, however, has not changed
its tactics in a single essential. Its principles are the same, even if
it previously made use of different phraseology from that which it
employs to-day. - A

While the German bourgeoisie held the time was not yet ripe for
letting Hitler and his ideological henchman, Alfred Rosenberg, pub-
licly inscribe on its banners the slogan of “ Push East,” it permitted its

[33]

   

 

interests for the time being to be served by the other slogan of “ No
More War.”

At the bottom of this paciﬁst slogan of German Social—Democracy,
however, was the same thought that moved it to confess at Potsdam
that it “ assents to the demand of the chancellor in the sphere of
foreign politics ”—-a demand which embraced the national policy of the
Hitler government. It is superﬂuous to set forth Hitler’s foreign
policy in any detail, since it may be tersely designated by a single
word-—u/ar. A What, in the last analysis, the motive for the pacifism of
German Social Democracy was, the dead Social—Democratic minister of
the Reich and unforgettable die—hard politician during the World War,
Edward David, has disclosed in his pamphlet; The Paciﬁeation of
Europe (Berlin, 1925, p. 7): .

"A new world war lead: inevitably to proletarian revolution.
Every thoughtful politician should be conscious of this casual con-
nection. If in 1918 and 1920, success in setting bounds to the
Bolshevik revolution and in setting up in Germany a Social—Demo-
cratic buffer ‘was achieved only with great difﬁculty-then a second
world war will at once let loose social earthquakes and explosions in
which the present state systems of Central and Western Europe will
collapse like a house of car-ds.” (Emphasis in the original——B.K.).
At the same time, he has stressed no less than Papen, Schleicher or

Hitler, Germany's‘ demands for equal rights in an imperialist world
preparing for war, when he argued:

“That it would be impossible permanently to keep Germany
defenceless, in a wholly one-sided manner, in the midst of a Europe
everywhere engaged in the most feverish preparations for war, is
obvious.”

In the post—war period, German Social—Democracy has been tempor—
arily opposed to war, because, on the one hand, the German bour—
geoisie was not yet prepared for war, and because, on the other hand,
in its fear of proletarian revolution, it still considered the arming of the
working masses dangerous.

Meanwhile the German bourgeoisie, with the help of Social—
Democracy, has proceeded to arm itself in secret. It now speaks more
openly. The fascist press in ‘Germany openly incites to war, and there-
fore, at this second halting-place of the “ German revolution,” Social-
Democracy also expresses its old attitude to German imperialism in
clearer language. Thus we read the above-cited article from the
Gewerkschaftszeitung, the following:

“ The workers form the broad basis of the nation, without which
neither greater expansion nor mobilization of the nation for war—as
the great war has taught-—-is possible . . . . We recall that the atti-

%l 34 1

 

 

 

 

tude of the German workers on the outbreak of the great war in
1914 was at first uncertain, stand-oﬂish, differentiated. Only the
position taken by the leading organizations, by the then General
Commission of the Trade Unions (naturally, by the Executive Com—
mittee of the Social—Democratic Party also—B.K.) gave to the vac-
cillating disposition of the mass a uniform purpose. Thus the
‘ German Wonder ’ was consummated, the overwhelming unanimity of
a. people, which contributed no little to the strategic results and pre—
vented Germany from being simply overrun . . . . The days of
August, 1914, which are now so often extolled as the days of national
unity, force themselves on us once more for comparison, and we
recall that then the order of relations between state and workers
followed the principle quid pro quo. On the day after the
German declaration of war -against Russia, on August 2, 1914, all
wage struggles were suspended by resolution of the union executive
committees. ‘.Civil peace ’ thereby came into force. There followed
directly upon this the declaration of the government, by which the
existence and the work of the trade unions were secured; ‘for we are
happy,’ the declaration stated literally, ‘ to have a great organization of
the working class upon which the government can rely.’ ”

The meaning of these expositions is this; You nationalist leaders have
come to power on our backs; our backs are further at your disposal.
Instead of using our backs as spittoons, you ought to avail yourselves
of them as one of the foundations of the national policy, as Wilhelm II,
Ludendorﬁ and Hindenburg did.

The tactics of German Social-Democracy have not changed. Since
August 4, 1914, at least, it has pursued these tactics logically and with-
out vacillation. in relation to the German bourgeoisie, to German
imperialism. Even if at one or another halting place of the Weimar
Republic, or, in its own words, at one or another “ national halting
place ” of the German revolution its own phrases sound different, yet
behind the phrases was an unshaken purpose: To save, in cooperation
with the bourgeoisie and under all circumstances and conditions,
capitalism and the rule of the bourgeoisie from the proletarian revolu-
tion, and to represent the interests of German imperialism abroad.
Social-Democracy would naturally have preferred to effect this salvation
alone, or together with the more moderate sections of the bourgeoisie.
It would certainly have preferred “ democratic ” methods, the more so
since it has been demonstrated that, in some circumstances, proletarian
insurrections can be repressed with ruthless terror under the slogans of
bourgeois democracy. ,

To save capitalism’ in Germany, to save bourgeois rule, Social-
Democracy has split and disarmed the working class, and has armed

[35]

 

 

 

 

the bourgeoisie and its fascist bands. There were many Social-Demo-
cratic functionaries and theoreticians who saw clearly that by its
policy and tactics Social-Democracy drives numbers of workers and
great masses of petty—bourgeois and peasants directly into the camp
of fascism, and weakens the forces of the proletariat by splitting them.
There were a few of its theoretical spokesmen who brought themselves
to the point of a barely audible mumble about the necessity for a

 

change in tactics. Such a change in tactics was, however, impossible; _

a change in tactics has become impossible for Social-Democracy, even
should it have been seriously intended, precisely because its basic
orientation, i-ts main principle was and remains: to corn-bat--by every
means—-proletarian dictatorship; the struggle of the working class*un_der
the leadership of the Communist Party for the overthrow of bour-
geois rule, and the setting up of the dictatorship of the working class.

Its tactics during the war; the revolution in November, 1918 and I919,
and the years I920, 1923 and 1928, were the same as those on Iuly 20,
1932 and January 30, 1933. The enemy-in—chief was always on the
left! The ideological poison gas attacks, like the Krupp bayonets, the
trench-mortars, the machine guns, and the armoured cars were always
directed against the left. All the fascist parades took place under
the protection of police, subordinate to Social-Democratic ministers and
police chiefs. A turning point in therhistory of fascism in Germany

was the “ German Conference ” in Halle on May 11, 1924, a demon-'

stration to which adherents of the Swastika ﬂocked from all parts of
the German Republic to demonstratively mock this Republic in the
presence of -the Crown Prince, Ludendorff and twenty—seven other
generals of Wilhelm. Ten thousand German proletarians demon-
strated in a united ﬁghting front under the leadership of the C.P.G.
against the beaten generals of .Wilhelm and the future chiefs of the
-bands of the “third empire.” The police provoked, batoned and
maltreated the proletarians; they ﬁred on the masses several times, and
wounded and killed dozens of workers in order to defend the fascists.
The Halle chief—of—police was a member of the Social-Democratic Party
of Germany; the local governor was a member of the Social-Democratic
Party of Germany; and the Minister for Home Affairs was~Sez/ering.
All National—Socialist publicists agree that the rise of Swastika fascism
dates from the “ German Conference "at Halle.

German Social—Democracy’s tactics of July 20 and January 30 are in
their whole concreteness a repetition of the same tactics it has already
employed several times before. On Iuly 20 and January 30' the wheel
of history in Germany could still have been turned otherwise if German
Social-Democracy had not declined the repeated proposals of the
Communist Party of Germany to organize in a united ﬁghting front

[36]

 

 

 

the general strike against Hitler. Moreover, itwas not satisfied to pass
over in silence the united front -proposals of the Communist Party.
After all its papers had rnanoeuvred for weeks and months on the
‘question of the necessity for a united front, on Iuly 20 and January 30
it called upon its members, its wider political following and the
working class to give no support to the general strike slogan of the
Communist Party of Germany. It denounced the Communist Party of
Germany to the fascist rulers and fed the workers with empty promises
in the constitutional way.

- What Social—Democracy did after Iuly 20 was the logical consequence
of what it had done when in oﬂice, or had publicly supported,
“ tolerated,” when out of power, in the matter of disarming the work-
ing class.

After July 20 was not Noske still in office as provincial governor of
Hanover? After July 20 was not Zéirgiebel still chief—of-police in
Dortmund? Were they not at the same time esteemed members of the
Social—Democratic Party of Germany? An incomplete list shows that
after Iuly 20 the ofﬁce of chief—of—police was held by registered members
of the Social-Democratic Party in the following towns: Frankfurt-on-
the-Main, Hanover, Weisenfels, Stettin, Bielefeld, Walderrburg, Ham-
burg, Wilhelmsburg, etc.

What did the Social-Democratic police chiefs do when Hitler made
a direct bid for the chancellorship, and when his bands behaved as
masters of the situation? They acted in accordance with the old tactics:
they had the revolutionary proletarians who wished to block Hitler's
path batoned, incarcerated and shot by their police. Was it not the
Social-Democratic police chief of Liibeck who had a Social-Democratic
member of parliament, who was present by accident at a workers’ anti-
fascist demonstration, arrested?

Did it happen for the=ﬁrst’ time that Social-Democracy in Germany
stood with the bourgeoisie against the revolutionary proletariat in a
solid, reactionary united front? And was, perhaps, the procedure of the
Party Executive " Committee and the Reichstag fraction in rejecting
therefore, after Hitler's assumption of office on Ianuary 31, the united
front demand of the Communist Party of Germany for the organiza-
tion of a‘ general strike againstfascism, without parallel? In the follow-
ing appeal (Vorwiirtr, special edition of Ianuary  it is stated:

"‘ We ‘wage our struggle on the "basis of the constitution . . .
I 'Undiscipl‘ined‘aetion'.‘ofT individual‘ organizations and’ ‘groups on their

I:'"ow'r1 "'responsibili‘t”y’ ‘(meaning "co-operation with the’ Communists

against?Hitler-—B.K.) would ‘most seriously injure the whole labour
movement.” 4
Remember, the matter was one of the restoration by revolutionary

proletarians of the united front against the National-Socialists, against
Hitler’s regime of terror and murder.

Was there a change in the tactics of the German Social-Democratic
Party, when, by obstructing the united front, it made possible the
victory of fascist reaction? .Was there a change?

By no means!

At the Party Conference of the-German Peoples’ Party, which was-.
formerly the Party of heavy industry, in Hanover (April, 1924), the:
then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Stresemann, thanked the Social--
Democrats on behalf of the German bourgeoisie for having shattered.
the united front of the working class in 1923. He observed:

“If we marched into Saxony and Thuringia without bloodshed‘
(Stresemann covers the bloody tracks of the march of Reichswehr and
police with the graces of the christian’s love of his neighbour
-—-B.K.), this, perhaps, was only possible because Social-Democracy
stood for the march, and because we had therefore to face only the
Communists’ and not some sort of proletarian united front, which at
that time might have taxed our strength very severely."

The obstruction of the united front of the working class by Social-
Democracy is precisely the tactic that follows from Social-Democracy’s
nature, from the basic orientation of its principles. Its action on
Ianuary 30, when it issued the slogan: “ No co-operation with the Com-
munists against Hitler,” was merely logical and true to principle. If,
by way of exception and under pressure from the masses, the Social-
Democratic Party let itself be forced into united action with the revolu-
tionary workers against the bourgeoisie, or particular groups of the
bourgeoisie, even -then the leaders always shattered the united front.
This was_ the case on the occasion of the campaign against the grant to
the princes, when, after the plebiscite, the Social-Democratic Party, at
Hindenburg’s command, proposed through its parliamentary fraction to
allow the expenditure of -billions on a gift to the exiledruling houses
of Germany. V

The Social-Democrats maintain that the Communists manoeuvre by
means of the united front.

Who it is manoeuvres. by means of the united front, the vice-president
of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, Herr Crispien, can relate,
on the strength of his own experiences.

On Iune II, 1920, the chancellor, Hermann Miiller, wrote a letter to
the president of the then Independent Social-Democratic Party, Crispien,
which contained an offer that the two Social-Democratic Parties, the
Majority and the Independents, should form a Government together.
In reality the government of Otto Wels and Hermann Miiller wanted
absolutely nothing of the kind. Two days before, on June 9, the

[38]

 

 

 

Social-Democratic Party_ had issued a circular to its leading function-
aries, which stated:

" We are reckoning on a government of the Right parties coming
into oﬂice. At the moment a government of the kind can only be
desired by us. We have staked everything on the representatives of
die Right parties conducting t.he negotiations in Spa.”

The Social-Democratic chancellor, therefore, wrote the letter to Cris-.

pien, in which he proposed a united front for the formation ofa
common government, subsequent to the issue of this circular. The
whole manoeuvre in connection with the uni-ted front accordingly
merely served the blackmailing purposes of the Social-Democratic clique
of leaders in regard to their capitalist masters.

It was not the will of the Social—Democrat leaders, who wanted to
hand over the German nation to the parties of the Right, which, in
1920, frustrated the entry into ouﬂ-ice of a government of the character of
the subsequent government of von Papen. At that time Social-
Democracy was already inclined to lift the blackest reaction publicly
into the saddle: the bourgeoisie merely held that, in view of the
existing international situation and the given relation of forces between
the classes, the time was not yet ripe for this. It is, however, historic-
ally established that, on Iuly 20, 1932 and Ianuary 30, 1933, German
Social—Democracy did not pursue the policy of consciously and deliber-
ately delivering governmental power into the hands of open counter-
reaoltttion for the first time.

What was not yet ripe for the German capitalists in 1920 became so
in 1932-33. German Social—Democracy has taken care, always in
harmony with economic development in Germany and the international
political situation, to let the political pre-requisites for Papen, Schleichcr
and ﬁnally Hitler, ripen. The method employed was the tactic of the
"lesser evil," by which the Social-Democratic Party and the reformist
trade union leaders prepared, at the Weimar halting-place of the~German
counter-revolution, the halting-place of the “ national revolution ” of
Hitler.

Whoever wants to interpret German Social—Democracy s tactics in
face of political reaction, of fascism, as having changed, must falsify
the entire tactics of German Social-‘Democracy from August 4, 1914
to November 9, 1918, to Weimar, to the “ pure ”‘ Social-Democratic
governments,-to the governments of the‘ small and great coalitions, to
the purely capitalist governments tolerated by Social-Democracy," from
Briining to Schleicher. Otherwise, no change of tactics, either on or

~.after Ianuary 30, can be made out. German Social—Democracy has

pursued, and still pursues to-day, a policy based on principle. And
even if -the wheel of history could, perhaps, be turned back by “ divine

of a

ordinance,” German Social-Democracy could still not do other than
it has done. Else it would cease to be Social-Democracy.

VI
ALL GOING THE SAME WAY, ARM IN ARM

The leading, the oldest and the most powerful party of the Second
International, German Social—Democracy, has met, overnight, the fate
“ poor relation.” Moreover, it brought disgrace on the family,
when, in pursuit of its business, it was caught in the very act. It
lifted the veil that hid the secret of this business and laid bare the
social fascist character of the capitalist labour parties, which carry on
their struggle against proletarian dictatorship, against Communism, in
the name of democratic Socialism.

We must now answer the second question, a reply to which is do
manded by every thinking worker who is no longer willing to let
himself be duped by Social-Democracy:

Has the Second International as a whole, have the individual Social-
Democratic Parties, acted in accordance with diﬁerent principles,
adopted diﬁerent tactics from those of the Social—Democratic Party
of Germany?

To answer this question in the aﬁirrnatiue is in the first place to

. maintain that the Second International has at some time discounten»

anced the policy of German Social-Democracy, even be it only since
this Party has defended such “ lesser evils” as Brz'ining’s policy 0/
emergency decrees, the election of Hindenburg as President, the policy
of Papcn and of the "social general" Schleicher, etc.

At the various conferences of the Second International, however, and
also in the various declarations of its individual leaders, just the opposite
of disapprobation of German Social—Democracy’s policy has found
expression. V

In his loudly applauded speech at the Vienna Congress of the Second
International, Otto Wels, in reply to the Englishman, Maxton, who had
expressed certain doubts about the correctness of German Social-
Democracy’s position, said in his best Prussian sergeant—major manner:

“ The rise of fascism, Maxton says, begins with the coalition policy
of Social-Democracy. Maxton, read the history of the German revolu—

tion. The coalition policy began in the ﬁrst days of the revolution . . .

We have only saved democracy in Prussia only through the coalition

policy, pursued by Braun and Severing, and the thanks of the Inter-

national haae been expressed to us for this policy." (Minutes of the

Fourth Congress of the Socialist Labour International, 1931, pp. 583-85.

Emphasis mine.——B.K.).

[40]

 

 

 

Otto Bauer, who at this Congress, reported on the item of the agenda
upon which the discussion of the attitude of German Social—Democracy
-to fascism suddenly arose, took the following “position.”

“In my opinion this Congress could be guilty of absolutely no
greater levity than, if at this critical hour, when it may shortly
be a matter of, perhaps, liberty or death for the German working
class, it should seek through our resolutions to limit even in the
slightest degree German Social-Democracy’s freedom of movement,
the elas-ticity and adaptability of i_ts strategy.” (Report of the Vienna
Congress, p. 525).

Truly the “ strategy” of German Social—Democracy is not wanting
in elasticity and adaptability. Its elasticity in questions of class struggle
has grown to such record dimensions that it proclaimed, as the principal
task of the German working class, not merely the curing of all capital-
ism, but the combating of all those revolutionary workers who, follow-
ing the slogans of the Communists, disturb the repose of that exalted
patient by strike movements and simila-r misdeeds. Upon the adapta-
bility of this “ strategy ” there is no need to waste many words: Hitler
has himself borne witness to it when he affirmed that the Social—
Democratic Party has adapted itself to the policy of the National—
Socialists.

The Second International, however, has not only given its approval
to the tactics of German Social-Democracy in the Hindenburg election
and in tolerating Bri.ining’s emergency decrees. The leaders of the
Second International have declared the attitude of German Social—

Democracy after July 20 and Ianuary 30, after the assumption of ‘power

by Hitler, to have been quite correct.

Otto Wels and his companions could, at and after Potsdam, not only
cite the fact that in February, 1919, immediately after the war, at the
Berne Conference of the Social—Democratic Parties, they had already
come forward as spokesmen of the Hitler of to—day, for proof of their
allegiance to the “national revolution” they could quite calmly read
out the declaration of Leon Blum. In this declaration (Populaire,
February 9, I933) this brave leader of French Social-Democracy and the
Second International definitely expressed his solidarity with the internal
policy of German Socia1—Democracy, with its attitude to Hitler, when
he stated:

“ To-day Hitler is chancellor . . . but is he in possession of power
to-day in the same times and circumstances as if on the day after
his last elections, he had, seized it by force alone? . . . To—day he is
no more than the leader of a coalition government! Messrs. Von Papen
and H ugenherg are on his side; other parties form a eounter—u/eight to
his party; he governs only through the shameless viola-tion of the

[41]

 

 

 

 

Weimar Constitution, but his predecessors have acted in exactly the

same way; he has, however, not a complete and open dictatorship.”

(Emphasis mine——B.K.). _

These -words of Blum’s not only speak highly for his positively
prophetic political foresight in things German, in questions of inter-
national politics; rather they mark out clearly Léon Blum’s path in the
future, when the French bourgeoisie will demand the same from him
as the German bourgeoisie has demanded from Wels, Hilferding and
company. The key to the politics of Leon Blum is the same tactic of
the "lesser evil,” the tactic of compromising with the “lesser evil”
instead of ﬁghting it, which German Social—Democracy pursued from
Weimar to Potsdam: the tactic which has its roots—not to go back
further into the past—in the policy of August 4. This policy, however,
was in no slight degree the policy of the French Social—Chauvinism,
as well as of the German Social Imperialists.

For Leon Blum, Hitler with Papen is a lesser- evil than Hitler with-

out Papen. Whether for the German proletarians the concentration
camps, the tortures and the murderous terror of the fascists are easier
to bear if Hitler, the former lance-corporal, commands the terror, not
alone, but in company with the former cavalry captain ivon Papen and
the privy councillor Hugenberg-—on this point Léon Blum can aﬁord
no doubts, else the whole tactic of the “lesser evil ” would be
endangered.

Van-dervelde, too, on the occasion of Hitler’s assumption of power,
defended the tactics of German Social-Democracy against _his own
dissatisﬁed party comrades as follows:

"Peuple” February 12, 1933:

“Among our comrades . . . are some who put the blame on
German Social—Democracy and maintain that it is its ‘policy of the
lesser evil,’ its too passive opposition in face of fascist force, which
has brought it to where it is . . . ‘I, too, can concede that errors
have, perhaps, been committed, not, however, in the present, hut_in
the past, in the already distant past . . .” (Emphasis mine——B.K.).
Accordingly, the President of the Second International has himself

said: Everything that was done or not done on Iuly 29 by Social-
Democracy is completely -in order; it was right for Wels, Hilferding,
Breitscheid, Braun, Severing, Leipart and Grassmann, to cause Papen’s
coup d’etat to be swallowed, by the members of the S.P.D. and the
reformist trade unions, with Weimar constitutional sauce, to prevent
the workers from following the general strike slogan of the C.P.G.

front of the working class against fascism and, by preventing the
general strike, opened wide the door to Hitler and his murder bands . . .
German Social-Democracy has committed errors-—in the authoritative
opinion of Vandervelde——only in the “ already distant past.”

It is not altogether easy to guess when such errors were actually
committed; or what was their nature. Perhaps it was ﬁfty or sixty
or more years ago, that the mistakes Vandervelde has in mind were
made, at a time when German Social—Democracy professed Marxism,
and thereby not only made possible the anti-socialist law of Bismarck,
but also afforded the latter—day disciple of the “iron chancellor,”
Hitler, the chancellor of the “ third empire,” an opportunity of giving
free reign to his demagogy under the slogan of Anti—MarxismP Or,
perhaps, it was in 1907, when, at the Stuttgart Congress of the Second,
International, German Social—Democracy was irresponsible enough to
make a compromise on a resolution moved by Lenin and Luxemburg
and to agree that in war it is the duty of the working class, not to
defend the fatherland, but to hasten the overthrow of capitalist rule;
for this, of necessity, caused its actual treason on August 4, 1914, to-
come all too clearly in view. Or, maybe, it was in 1910, when Bebe]
declared at the Party Congress in Mag-deburg: “If I, a Social-Demo—
crat, enter an alliance with the bourgeois parties, then the odds are a
thousand to one that, not the Socia1—Democrats, but the bourgeois parties
are the winners . . . I may (i.c., then) no longer ﬁght . . . I am
forced to be silent . . . to justify what may not be justified, to
palliate what cannot  palliated  . ”

Perhaps, however, Vandervelde was thinking’ of Social—Democracy
going to Hindenburg? Not, to be sure, of Hindenburg’s election—this
was not “in the distant past ”——but of its going to Hindenburg during
the war period, when Vandervelde, as His Belgian Majesty's Minister,
considered the defence of the fatherland justiﬁed in the case of himself

‘and his allies, including the Russian tsar; but, on the contrary, denied

this right to Social—Democracy in the non-Entente countries.

Let us now consider the leaders of the Second International in their
relations not merely with their German brother—party (it was a brother-
party only in peace time, or, in war time, only if it was in the same
imperialist camp). The revolutionary smites the class foe in his own
land, the Social-Democrat supports him—likewise in his own land.

AUSTRIA

Germany’s- neighbour country, where the democratic institutions
based on the Social—Demoeratic constitution put the “ most ideal Swiss
democracy ” in the shade, lives in a condition’ in which the rights of
theworlkers are regulated by the war law of the Hapsburg monarchy.

[43]

 

 

 

The republic, whose every municipal convenience in Red Vienna is
extolled and theoretically expounded by Renner, Otto Bauer and Seitz
as “ a bit of socialism come into being in the correct democratic
way,” and is contrasted with the centre of the “ Bolsheviks’ barbaric
Asiatic socialism” in -the land beyond the Dnieper, is under a rule
which the Social-Democrats characterize as “ Clerico—Fascism.” Last
year, on the occasion of the ﬁfteenth aniversary of the October Revolu-
tion, Otto Bauer had already, in the name of the Austrian workers,
renounced material well~being in the democratic lands for the duration
of the crisis: only “ democracy,” a“ freedom of opinion” was to be
retained, which the Bolsheviks had “ destroyed ”—-—to be sure, for the
capitalists——-“ with rough hands.” A

How was it that the Austrian workers, of whom every fourth man
is a member of the Social-Democratic Party, could have been brought

to a position that closely approximates to the conditions prevailing in
Germany?

In 1918 it was regarded,as the “lesser evil,” in comparison with
bolshevism, to elevate the overthrow of the Hapsburg monarchy effected
by the workers to a “ general national revolution,” andto declare as
its aim, union with the German Reich; to prevent the overthrow of
capitalism. In 1919 Renner, sandwiched between the Hungarian and
Bavarian Soviet Republics, betook himself to Prague, to Benés, to obtain
the “lesser evil ”—'the occupation of Austria by Czech troops~—in the
event of a Bolshevik revolution in Vienna. Meanwhile, by means of
the People’s Guard, the Social-Democrats themselves—-as Otto Bauer
has boasted-—drowned in blood the proletarian insurrections of Maundy
Thursday and Iune 15, 1919, and put the country on the hunger
rations of the Entente, in the name of the struggle of democracy
against «bolshevism. After the purely Social-Democratic government
had» performed its duties to the Entente, it could go. The coalition with
the present “ Clerico—Fascists”; the supporting of the government of
Police-Chief Schober, which on Iuly 15,1927, had the machine—guns
turned on the workers, while the Social-Democratic Mayor, Seitz,
commanded the ﬁre—hoses playing on the burning Palace of Iustice;
the I-Iiittenberg pact with the “ Home Guard ” (Heimwehr) Fascists,
which secured to the Home Guard trade unions equal rights with the
free trade unions in the factories—-all this was regarded as a “lesser
evil” than communism. On the strength of the theory developed by
the Social-Democratic military expert, Julius Deutse/1, the Social-
Democracy of Austria has handed over to the bourgeoisie the weapons
and all instruments of power that it declared to be proletarianfjust as
Braun and Severing handed over the government offices in Prussia.
The former leader of the Defence League has summarized this theory

[44]

 

 

 

 

(Defence-Power and Social-Democracy, p. 23) in the following terse
words: -

“ The aﬁrmative attitude of Social-Democracy to the state, how-
ever, demands the assumption of a positive attitude to the state’:
instruments of power also. One cannot possibly espouse the state and at

' the same time see/{ to rob it of every instrument of power.” (Emphasis
mine-—B.K.). ,
A truth as pure as gold! A rare phenomenon in the Austrian Social-

-Dcmocracy: deeds correspond to words!

 

The army, which, in its immense majority, was once composed of
soldiers organized in the Social-Democratic Party and the free trade
unions, was purged by Julius Deutsch of the commu—nist—minded
soldiers and handed over to the state which was “ affirmed,” even when
under christian social control. The police, the gendarmerie, consisting
in its majority of oﬂicials organized in the Social-Democratic Party,
was transferred by Social—Democraey -to Schober. The Vienna municipal
police was dissolved by the Social-Democratic City Council. Obvi-
ously, in Social—Democracy’s view, the weapons——the proletarian and the
bourgeois, the democratic and the fascist-Ibelong to the power

 

apparatus of the -‘state. The Executive Committee of the Social- a

Democratic Party, therefore, was only realizing its own principle when
it made repeate-d proposals to the christian government that all “ private
defence formations ” should be disarmed and their weapons transferred
-to the “ afﬁrmed state.” Meanwhile, the Fascist Home Guard forma-
tions were, in fact, already recognized parts of the power apparatus of
the ‘aﬂfrmed state. The part of Social-Democracy’s proposals realized
in fact was——the disarming of the Defence League (Schutzbund). The
handing over of the weapons of the members of the Defence League
from the arsenal, from the workers’ homes in Ottakring, from Weiner
Neustadt, Gratz, etc., has signiﬁed the more extensive arming of the
Home Defence, whose leader, Major Fey, the Commissar for Order in
the Republic of Austria, was and is the real commander of the power
apparatus of the state. The Social-Democratic Party leadership allowed
the Defence League to be disarmed; it has got rid of it through its
dissolution by the Dollfuss government. At the same time it has got rid
of a plank of the never seriously regarded Linz Program; its promise to
defend democracy by force against bourgeois force. Now, at the latest
party conference, Karl Renner, who, in confraternity with his worthy
“opponent,” Otto Bauer, has led the Austrian workers happily along
the democratic path, past a whole sequence of “lesser evils,” to the
reenactment of the war laws of the once so hotly defended Austrian
monarchy, could——without being disturbed by armed members of the

 

Defence Leaguc—<:almly repeat what, at the last Congress‘ of the Social- -

I45]

 

Democratic Party of Austria ‘(see the party Congress Report of 1932)
he solemnly expressed in these words:

“ The art is to ﬁnd a. rational equilibrium in the “mi-dst of such
antagonisms. It is a general rule that you will ﬁnd this rational
equilibrium only if you proceed objectively and justly. Yes, I know
that everyone says, ‘ The others «don’t do it.’ But, party comrades,
it is just in this that we are different. (Hearty applause). Instead of
arbitrariness, we wish to create a just order of human community,
and we are diﬁerent from the others, whose last word on every
occasion is force, because we say: No, freedom and justice."
(Emphasis in the original—B.K.).

T oday Hitler is knocking at Austria’s door, and lol—the Social-
Democracy of Austria has discovered one more “lesser evil.” Mussolini
and Italian fascism. Mussolini is now-—*-if things go Austrian Social-
Democracy’s way--to become the Saviour of Austria from Hitler,

since Italian Fascism, by reason of its imperialist policy, is for the time ,

being opposed to the union of Austria with Germany and is hostile
to Hitler’s subjecting the Austrian Republic to assimilation. As long
as Mussolini adopts this standpoint, the Otto Bauers, the Renners
and the Dannebergs will let the democratic republic be governed under
the war laws of the Hapsburgs.

In Austria, Social—Democracy has brusquely and abruptly rejected
every oﬁer of the Communist Party of Austria for a united front.
It declared that in Austria the working class is not split and that
Social—Democracy embodies the unity of the Austrian working class.
It is a “lesser evil” to tolerate the the Home Guard Fascists, to serve
the ends of Mussolini’s foreign policy and to seek an equilibrium with
the “ Clerico—Fascists,”v than ‘to confess the bankruptcy of Austro—
Marxist politics and take up with the Communists a common struggle
against Fascism, against depriving the workers of their rights, against
reduction of unemployed insurance.

Are these tactics of the model party, the “ Left ” wing of the Second
International, different from those of German Social—Dernocracy in any
of the essential questions of class struggle ‘between proletariat and
bourgeoisie? Diﬂerences are only to be found in the phraseology and
the speed of the development to Social—Fascis_m; and these are, in the
first place, to be traced to the lessiacute class antagonisms of Austria,
in comparison with Germany. Both the German and the Austrian
parties have led the workers one and the same way, with the sole
difference that German Social—Democracy has taken, the right side of
the street, while Austrian Social—Democracy has taken the left.

FRANCE

By the “ fa-scisation ” of Germany, Social-Democracy has been put in
the “ agreeable position” of already being able in the name of the
“ great Western democracy,” once more to undertake the defence of
French imperialism, _not merely against Italy, but also against Germany.
During the World War it adopted just the same attitude to “ Prussian
militarism.” To be sure, it might have diﬂiculty in persuading anyone
to—day that French militarism was better, less lustful for annexations or

' - less agressive than Prussian militarism used to be. Neverthelss, French

 

Social—Democracy still has a possibility of donning a “ paciﬁst and
democratic ” disguise. As the victor, French imperialism has, to
all appearances, satiated itself, at least for a time, and is today the
"‘ defender« of the status quo.” French finance capital has amassed
so much booty that the Paris Bourse still feels itself ﬁnancially strong
enough to retain intact the foundations of the parliamentary system, the
notorious French system of corruption, and, therewith, to permit
French Social—Democracy, also, to play its “ opposition ” role.

For a very long time now, the French Social-Democrats have not
allowed principles of any sort to hinder them from making themselves
partners in the business of the French bourgeoisie. To take a holiday

 

from the Socialist Party to become a minister—was a discovery of the

French Socialists Millerand, Briand, V-iz/iarzi and others of their
kidney. In the war period this method I of taking a holiday was
already no longer necessary to enable Social-Democrats to occupy
ministerial posts and look after the affairs of French imperialism;
Guésde, Sembat and Albert Thomas were, indeed, simultaneously,
active Social—Democratic leaders and capitalist—ministers. In his
"Memoirs " Poincaré has lifted, though with extreme caution, the veil
hiding the secret of that internal mechanism, by which the French
bourgeoisie directed the Social—Democratic Party, and still directs it
today. Poincare is not at all concerned to tell tales of scandals and
corruption, in which individual Social-Democratic parliamentarians
ﬁgure, who were bribed to take care of the business of individual
Bourse speculators and bogus banks. Rather, he shows up how the
bourgeoisie as a whole, as a class, guides and directs Social—Democracy
as a whole, as a Party. Behind the cool objectivity too, with which
Poincare reports, can be seen his gratitude for the patriotic services
that French Social-Democracy rendered its bourgeoisie in those most
difficult days, when it was necessary to repress the revolutionary move—
ment arising out of the longings of the men in the trenches for peace,
and when the “ Socialists ” strangled strikes that production of arms
and munitions might not be held up. He relates in his book The
Troubled Year of 1917 how Albert Thomas, the «SociaI—Democratic

[47]

Minister for Munitions, regretted pro-forma that the governments had
refused passports to Stockholm (where the social—Patriotic parties held
a peace conference in collusion with their governments-—-B.K.) (see
pp. 262-3). To ‘form an opinion, however, it is most instructive to
examine, not merely the past, but the present policy of the Socialist
Party; then it may be clearly seen how the social—democratic leaders had
prearranged their game of opposition with the government.

On September 9, 1917, when a governmental crisis was approaching,
Poincare wrote in his diary (pp. 277—8):

“ Thomas should call on me again. He was here about half-past
two with his Socialist colleagues; Renaadel was their spokesman.
He spoke vaguely and solemnly. He explained that the Socialists had
already shared the responsibility of power too long, that the war has
not been conducted with the requisite energy, that the government
lacks boldness in its social legislation, etc.” (Emphasis mine-—B.K.).
The game was pre-arranged, and Poincaré (p. 279) continues:

“ Thomas is, moreover, of the opinion that it would be better
if no Socialists were in the government during the National Congress
(i.e., of the Socialist Party of France), which is to assemble next
month. It would be easier to obtain a majority for a patriotic
motion.”

Is, then, what Léon Blum and Paul Faure do now, when -they play
opposition to Paul Bancour and Daladier, any diﬂerent from what
Albert Thomas and Renaudel did during the war?

Is this “opposition ” to the preparations for a new war different from
the “ opposition ” of Albert Thomas, who—according to Poincaré’s
" Memoirs ”-—eould not break the resistance of Clemenceau to the
Socialists, and therefore must needs report to Poincaré with the mien
of a deluded tanner: _ -

“ Agreement is, once and for all, impossible. He does not believe
in strikes, nor in dangerous movements, but an opposition will be
unavoidable.” .

Is this any diﬁerent from the “opposition ” of German Social—
Democracy? Does it not read like a page of German history -when
the periodical Vie Socialiste reports a speech by Léon Blum on February
II, 1933, in which he dealt with the question as to whether the
Socialist Party should participate in the government or should rather
support it from outside, as follows:

“ Do not let us impale ourselves on the horns of a dilemma:
participation or opposition. I wish the Daladier government a. long
life. No doubt, it will not be able to bring in a ﬁnance bill, to
which we could subscribe. But we shall, perhaps, be able’ to vote

[43]

 

 

 

 

for it, after‘ our hill has _been defeated . . . . There is another con-

fusion that I wish would vanish from your minds: we confound

our inﬂexible (I) opposition to the bourgeois state with a tactic of
systematic Parliamentary opposition! . . . . Systematic opposition?

I reject that. And if you overthrow all the ministries, then the result

will be concentration-—the Union Nationale and, ﬁnally, anti—parlia—

mentarism.” (Emphasis minedB.K.).

How can one pursue a “ systematic opposition ” in the French
Parliament, when it is a question of the defence of the Versailles
system, which was also defended by Blum in the Second International
no less successfully than it was defended in the League of Nations by a
former leader of the French Socialists, Paul Boncouri‘ A little no-
conﬁdence vote of a party conference cannot stop the majority of the
Socialist parliamentary fraction from voting for the armament ex-
penditures and the police estimates; it did so in December, 1932, and
again in the present year. Thomas has shown the way: it is better
sometimes to play the role of an opposition. But if the interests of
French imperialism are seriously at stake, then Léon Blum and Paul
Faure will certainly not long “impale themselves on the horns of a
dilemma,” but will participate in a “ national union,” under which not
only will Renaudel -resume the report on the aerial war—budget and
Varennes his vice-royalty in Indo-China, but even the “ Left” Iyromsky
will lie in the arms of Tardieu. Relations between the Socialist Party
and Tardieu, and even Millerand, are not difficult to resume; even after
the war they were never quite broken off, and still exist to-day. In
the “ National Federation of Ex—Service Men,” whose President
Millerand formerly was an-d Tardieu now is, and which, in France, is
generally regarded as a semi—fascist body, approved and prominent
Socialists take a very active part, in this connection they endeavour,
hand in hand with their party leaders, to play off the above body
against the revolutionary organization of service men, which wages a
real struggle against the preparations for imperialist war.

lust as social—democracy was in Germany the champion of a Western
orientation in foreign politics, and, in this way, ‘pursued the aim of
forcing Germany to line up in the anti- Soviet front, so, too, the French
Social-Democrats are professional advocates for the u‘Irec}(ers and spies
who have, in the Soviet Union, done the dirty work of the imperialist
General Staﬁs-—and Russian White—Guards, from the Grand Duke
Cyril to Abramovitch.

Nor on the question of the united front do they lag behind their
German colleagues in point of shabbiness. At the same time as Paul
Faure and I. B. Seuerac, the two secretaries of the Socialist Party, "were,
for the purpose of duping the masses, ostensibly negotiating with the

[49]

  

ﬁn ,

 

  

 

 

Communist Party in France on the ‘subject of the united front, the
leaders of the Socialists were carrying on serious discussions with the
imperialist government, ﬁrst of Paul Boncour and then of Daladier.
A few days later, they expressed -their conﬁdence in the Daladier
government.

The difference between German and French social-democracy lies
neither in their principles nor in their tactics, but in the degree of
acuteness attained by the crisis and the class struggles in their respec-
tive countries. ‘But one must not be unfair: their manners are also
different. Thus Wels would never exchange his Prussian sergeante
major style for the small-talk style of the Paris salons peculiar to Léon
Blum. On the other hand, however, the relations of the two parties
to all underlying questions of class struggle, and in the first place to
their own imperialisms and LO proletarian revolution, relations which,
in the last resort, determine their attitudes to democracy and to fascism,
are as like as two eggs. Only, social-fascism in Germany, having been
fully hatched, has already emerged from the egg, while French social-
fascism is still stuck in the shell. When this egg—shel1 will be broken-
depends on French ﬁnance capital.

ENGLAND,

too,’ has its‘Social-Democracy, which constitutes a much praised section
of the Second International, the Labour Party,»but which we shall only
brieﬂy consider here. To be sure, some “insular characteristics ” still
cling to its tactics. Nevertheless, it is in no slight degree a vulgar
Social—Democracy in the Continental sense. Its peculiarities are con-
ditioned by the two-party system prevailing in England, which——
according to Marx—forms the bulwark of the bourgeoisie against the
discontent of the masses.

The Labour Party has always had an aversion to coalitions with
bourgeois parties; quite recently it has elected to form an “ Opposition ”
rather than a coalition (the separate group of National Labourites
round MacDonald excepted). The avowed aim of the British Labour
Party was—and is——'to take -the place of the Liberals in the two-party
system in opposition to the Conservatives. And actually it has alrea-dy
succeeded in elevating itself to the position of British Imperialism’:
second party; Probably it will also understand how to maintain this
position. ‘

It has shamefully broken one of the greatest strikes in the history
of the world, the miner’s strike and the general strike of 1926; but
it has thereby proved to the English capitalists that it is not only
willing. but also able to represent the interests of British imperialism.
Together with the General Council of the Trades Unions and the

[ so 1‘

  

 

 

 

deceased wire—pu1ler, Lord Melchet-t (formerly Sir Alfred Mond), it has
created, after the German _model, the “insular version ” of the‘collab0r—
ation of employers’ organizations and -trade unions, to wit, Mondism.

When the Labour Party first took over the administration of the
aﬁairs of British imperialism, the MacDonald “ Labour ” government
allowed the laws passed by the Conservatives and directed against
the miners to remain in force; it also set the seal of its whole authority
to the law providing for the lengthening of hours in the mines. When,
for the second time, it became the administrator of the British bour-
geoisie, it at once understood the latter’s program in the matter of
“ a standard of life for the workers of Great Britain worthy of human
beings ” in the same way as German Social-Democracy understood the
program of its own bourgeoisie in regard to this; it promoted capitalist
rationalization at the expense of the workers with all its might; ‘through
its peacemakers it permitted the miserable wages of the whole of the
textile workers to be cut in the interest of making the textile ‘industry
capable of competition; by rapid rationalization it increased unemploy-
ment to an unvprecedented extent, and prepared the wage cuts .of the
‘sailors and the civil servants, as well as a reduction in the un-
employed dole. It has increased English indusutry’s reduced capacity to
export, by means similar to those employed by German Social—Democracy
and the German trade unions. The Labour government of MacDonald
has, as the administrator of the capitalist Shylock, not only demanded
its “ pound of ﬂesh ” from the impoverished workers for the back debts
of the formerly aristocratic working class of Great Britain, but has cut
this out of their hides with the sharp rationalization knife of capitalist
exploitation. -

The democracy of the Labour Party is constituted in the same way
as its socialism. The Labour government understood how to conduct the
British Empire not at all badly, to conduct it so that, of over 4oo,ooo,ooo
inhabitants of the English world—empire, over ,3oo,ooo,ooo continued to
be robbed of English civil rights. Under the second Labour government,
some 60,000 to 70,000 Indian workers, peasants and intellectuals were
arrested for ﬁghting for Indian independence, and the Meerut prisoners
of British imperialism continued to be incarcerated.

The Labour government has so conducted England’s foreign policy
that, after" one year of “labour ” government, even Vandervelde felt
himself compelled to express his disappointment at the lack of pacifist
activity on the party of the Labour Party.

Anybody maintaining that the ways of German Social—Democracy
and the English Labour Party are fundamentally different——as has
frequently been maintained by ‘numerous Continental social-democrats
.—should turn his eyes to India, where the method: of Zéirgiebel were

[511

\

 

practised on a gigantic scale under the Labour government. He should
also recollect the statements made in 1930 by the present opposition
member of Parliament and former Colonial Minister of the “ Labour ”
government, Mr. Benn. This Mr. Benn answered his own question:
" In such cases as in India, what is the duty of a government?” as
follows. “ The duty‘ of a government is-—to govern.”

When the “left ” Brown proceeded to supplement Benn’s question by
the question: “ But what is the duty of a Labour government?” the
social—democratic Minister thereupon replied, with a clarity that could
not have been surpassed by either Severing or Ziirgiebelg amidst
applause from both Conservativesand Labourites, as follows:

“The duty of a Labour government is also to govern.”

And he left his hearers in no doubt that by the “ governing” of the
“ Labour ” government was meant by no means a governing of the
capitalists, but the governing of the colonial peoples and the English
working class.

If to—day MacDonald is no longer the leader of the Labour Party,
but a “ National Labourite ” and the head of a coalition government
containing an overwhelming majority of conservatives, still, he has
surely not forgotten the plaudits of his former Party that followed a
speech in which he declared that the Labour government “ may not
yield to force ” in India, “ since this would be contradictory to the
principles of democratic government, and to the responsibility of
representatives of the people.”

These are by no means the last “German words” of an English
leader of the Second International.

Iust as German Social-Democracy has presented Hiirsing and Otto
Strasser to German fascism, and Japanese Social-Democracy the “labour
leader,” Akanutchie, to Japanese fascism, so the Labour Party has
brought :,forth Sir Oswald Mosley and his fascist party from its ranks.
The La5our government of MacDonald prepared all the measures that
the National government of MacDonald has put into operation. The
former has, by its tactics, prepared the victory of the Conservatives in
no slight degree, just as German Social--Democracy paved the way for-—
Papen, Schleicher and Hitler.

Next comes

ITALY,

till now the most typical Fascist country, whose leader, Mussolini,
despite his “southern race,” is acknowledged even by Hitler as his
master.

Prior to the victory of fascism in Italy more than ten years ago, Italian
Social-Democracy had been unable to realise collaboration with the
bourgeoisie in the form of participation in the government. The

[52]

 

 

i

g .

 

revolutionary upsurge, which rendered the resistance of Social-
Democracy’s worker members to open collaboration of the classes
extremely strong, contributed to prevent this. Social—Democracy had
to support the bourgeois governments under cover of oppositional
phrases. The leaders of Italian Social—Democracy have subsequently
done public penance several times for having neglected to play the
part of Noske, and for having thereby engendered the Mussolini re-
quired by the bourgeoisie as an executioner of the working class.
When German Social—Democracy preened itself——as in the highly
embellished speech of,Wels at the latest party conference——on Germany's
being “ no Italy,” it was actually boasting that German Social-
Democracy—as distinguished from its Italian colleagues—had shown no
timidity in looking after the affairs of its own bourgeoisie within the
state—apparatus itself, .

The disarming of the working class before Fascism is, however,

pursued by social-democracy in diﬁerent ways.

One of these ways is .the method employed by Noske, Severing and
Wels, that of, the brutal force of militarism, of police provocation and
of open conﬁscation of the workers’ weapons by the state—apparatus.
Another method is that which we observed in Austria, where Otto
Bauer and Iulius Deutsch, had the revolutionary minority of the work-
ing class disarmed by the Social-Democratic troops, and, in addition
surrendered the weapons of the majority of the working class to the
bourgeoisie. Besides these, however, there are’ still other methods-,
among them one which might almost be designated as the christian
method; this was employed by the Italian Socialists. As we know,
the Italian Socialists worked in close proximity to the Romish Pope.
It is, therefore, no wonder that Filippo Turatti (now dead), a leader
of the Second International, on April 26, 1921, after six months’ raging
Fascist terror, gave the following counsel to the Italian small peasants
for the “ struggle ’.’ against Fascism:

“ Do not let yourselves be provoked. Give no opportunities to the
Fascists; do not reply to their insults. Be good, be patient, be holy.
You were so for thousands of years; he so to—day! Endure, forgive,
even now!

Turatti addressed this letter to Barutta, Mayor of Violanti, at a time

when Mussolini’s Fascists did not yet number one tenth of “those
i workers who were organized in trade unions under social—democratic

leadership, and when 138 Social-Democratic deputies regarded abuse
of the thirteen Communist deputies as their main task in the Italian
Parliament.

On August 3, I921, ensued the publication of the agreement arrived
at by the Fascists and the reformists. This agreement was a real non-

[53]

 

 

 

agression pact between Fascists and social—democrats, in which the
social—democrats repudiated all anti--Fascist action, and, in particular,
the mass organization of workers hostile to Fascism—-Arditti del
Popolo. In regard to this, the notorious par. 5 of the agreement reads as
follows: ‘

“ The Socialist Party of Italy declares that it has nothing in
common with the organization and activity of the Arditti del Popolo.”
Directly after the March to Rome, when the Italian bourgeoisie had

delivered governmental power into the hands of Mussolini, Italian
social-democracy coined the words for Wels’ speech by declaring:

“ We remain at our post and say to the toilers: Preserve your’

solidarity; hold your peace; avoid provocations. Wait, till the hostile

wave has passed by.” ' H

A name that will not be forgotten is that of D’Arragona, the leader‘
of the Italian trade unions, who has shown the General Federation of:
German Trade ‘Unions the way. He went openly to Fascism, and, on;
May 22, 1924, just before the murder of the Social-Democrat Matteoti,.
gave the following statement on Mussolini to the press:

“ He (i.e., Mussolini) pursues the policy of a great philosopher..

He knows the masses, the complex soul of the masses. I have spoken;

twice to Mussolini since he came to power. He has proved this to:

me. Mussolini—I repeat—knows the masses well enough to be:
able to pursue a proletarian policy.”

Un-der Fascist dictatorship, the reformists excluded the Communists:
and revolutionary workers from the trade unions, just as the German.
Social—Democratic leaders continue to denounce the Communists to’
Hitler. Nevertheless, the Fascists in Italy have dissolved the reforrnists
trade unions, as well as the Social-Democratic Party.

Should anyone seek to discover a contradiction between the two facts:
that Social—Democracy prepared and serves Fascist dictatorship. yet
is maltreated, dissolved, and subjected to "assimilation ” by the
Fascists, he should not forget that, under the capitali~s=t’s Fascist“.
concentration of power, this is not only the fate of Social—Democracy and?
the reformist trade unions. In Italy the Catholic People’s Party, the‘
party of the so—called “ Popolari,” was persecuted in just the same way
as the Social Democratic Party. In Germany the National-Socialists are’
in process of subjecting all bourgeois parties to assimilation such as‘«
the reformist trade unions have experienced. The persecution of the
Social-Democratic Party is nothing but a method of assi»mi.lat:ing it with:
a baton. I .

Acordingly, has German Social—Democracy’s path, perchance, been!
other than that of Italian Social-Democracy? No one can say it has..
The sole difference lies in the fact that German Social-Democracy’s

present time under the Hitler dictatorship has been somewhat quicker

march to Mussolini.
Social-Democracy in
POLAND

The Socialist Party of Poland will now play a bigger role in the

Second International, since it works in a country that adheres to the

‘  system of French military alliances, and is therefore a “ natural” ally

of the French Socialists against the German Social—Democrats. It merits
that its deeds should now be brought forth from their narrower national
conﬁnes into an international light. /

The P.P.S.,* preceded German Social-Democracy, along the road of
an open support of fascism. To-day it excels in many respects its
founder, Pilsudski; the fascist dictator of Poland, who takes the Jews
under his protection in Germany, but organizes Jewish programs in
Poland. The P.P.S. not only supports the police actions against the
Communists_in Poland; it also support: z/ac murderous terror of the
Hitler gang: against the Communist Party of Germany.

We know no press organ anywhere in the world—-those of the
Swastiklers excepted—tha't has essayed plausibly to represent Goering’s
Reichstag incendiarism in the way the P.P.S. has done. The P.P.S.’s
Cracow organ, Napred (Forward), erected a giant monument of -shame

I to Social-Democracy, when it declared on March I, 1933:

“ The setting on fire of the Reichstag by the Communists reveals
the horrible role of Communism in modern history. . . . There is
method in this Communist madness, in setting fire to the Parliament
just at the decisive moment of the struggle between the parliamentary
democratic system and the Hitler dictatorship. This is a historical
symbol, that discloses the whole evil essence of Cornmunislmi’

But not merely Pilsudski has been excelled by this Social>Democrac'y;
it has surpassed even the parliamentary fraction of the Social—Demo-
cratic Party of Germany, which, as is well known, refused the request
of the Communist fraction excluded from parliament to present a
declaration of the Communist deputies, in which the incendiary provo~
cation was repudiated.

This Party, the P.P.S., cooperated with Pilsudski in 1920 in waging
the Polish war against the Soviet. In 1926 it supported Pilsudski’s
fascist coup d'état. Its leader, Daszinski, has published the book,
Pil5udsl(i——-A *Great Man. It, the P.P.S., still supports the fascist,
semi-military organization Strelez (Riﬂ-eman), which constitutes
Pilsudski’s mass organization. It itself organized the strike-breaking

bands and murder gangs (the '-so-called “ Bojusk-i ") against the revolu-
tionary movement of the workers; these gangs in no way fell short of
Hitler's Storm Troops, an-d only had to be dissolved because they
developed into “ bands of robbers ” of quite the usual kind, and thus
endangered the private property of individual capitalists.

This Party has played and still plays “ opposition ” to Pilsudski, in
the way that Wels has done and still does against Papen, Léon Blum
against Daladier and Lansbury against MacDonald.

In 1931, after a number of its leaders, together with their bourgeois
and big peasant coalition confréres, had been arrested, and had been
mocked and spat upon in the Brest-Litovsk prison by the oﬂicials of the
Republic, one of the most prominent leaders of this party, Liebermann,
defended himself, his party and his coalition‘ comrades in court, as
follows: e

“ The opposition deputies have taken upon themselves all reports
on’ the Estimates, and have worked day and night on the State
Budget. We have understood the requirements of the country; we
have not desired revolution; we have hoped that even up there
(i.c., by Pilsudski) the situation would be ﬁnally and conclusively
understood.” ‘

If Léon Blum has translated the arguments for the French Socialists’

“ opposition ” posture from the German of a Breitscheid into French, ‘

then the oppositional explanations of the P.P.S. deputies are trans-
lations of the speeches of Blum and his French colleagues into Polish.
On February 16, 1933, when the P.P.S. fraction voted in the Senate
against the Enlistment Law, the P.P.S. leader, Dembski, gave the
following reason for this vote: i i

“ The P.P.S., which voted in the Diet against the Enlistment Law,
has demonstrated during the whole period of Poland's -restoration,
and subsequently,’ when in 1920 (i.e., during Pilsudski’s and the
.French Marshall Weygand’s anti—Soviet war—B.K.) Poland was in
difﬁcult circumstances, that it sacriﬁces i-ts blood for her independence.
To—day, when clouds are again gathering over the international arena,
an-d the menace of Hitler is so great, we see no adequate guarantees in

the existing government . . . therefore we vote against the govern-

9)
o

ment’s legislation . . .

If the fascist Pilsudski can be such a solid ally of democratic France,
why, then, cannot the openly social-fascist people of the P.P.S. be
worthy allies of the “ paciﬁst” Blum? That Blum can “ understand ”
this tactic of the P.P.S. better than the similar tactic of Wels in regard
to Hitler, only shows that he possesses a proper social—fascist under-
standing of the interests of French imperialism.

‘Is Social—Democracy in
CZECHOSLOVAKIA

any better than those Social-Democracies we have previously con-
sidered? Nobody has yet asserted that the Czechoslovakian Social-
Democracy, or its fraternal German party in the same country,- has
been any more radical than the party in the German Reich} on the
contrary, they have spent every minute of the entire post—war period on
class collaboration. In Czechoslovakia, the serious fascization tendencies
are represented, not by the adventurer Gaida, formerly one of Kolchak’s
generals and Masaryk’s Chief of the General Staff, but by the clique
that surrounds Masaryk in the Prague Hradzhin. These “fortress
fascists ” (who to—day give effect to their fascist measures under the
slogan: “ Defence of democracy even by the methods of fascism ”)
base themselves first of all on the Sokol organizations, on the former
legionaries that were the shock troops of Russian counter—revolution in
Siberia, and further on Social—Democracy’s coalition comrades, the
Czechoslovakian National—Socialist Party.

The Social—Democratic athletic organizations, which were mobilized
in 1919 against the Red Army of the Hungarian’ Soviet Republic, and
were armed against the workers during the strike of December, I920,
in Moravia, -orm, as it were, the auxiliary troops of the Sokol and
legionaries’ associations. .

On one occasion, after gendarmes had shot down the workers, the
Social-Democratic Minister for Iustice, Meissner was asked at a con-
ference of Social—Democratic women how the government could tolerate
this sort of thing. His answer was as follows:

“ We want no Kerenskiade in our country; we tolerate no weak-
ness. For he who demonstrates his strength is ultimately the victor.”
Espousal of a “ strong state ” is common to fascists and Social—

Democrats alike. Often enough the Social—Democratic ministers in the
coalition government have demonstrated their strength—to be sure,
against the workers. For «three to four years they have, through their
gendarines, organized a b1ood—bath whenever a considerable strike of
industrial or agricultural workers has occurred. The revolutionary
workers’ press is gagged by the Social—Democratic Minister for Iustice
in exactly the same way as it was by Braun and Severing in Germany.

It only remains to say that the Czechoslovakian Social-Democracy is
the party that stands ﬁrmes-t on the ground of the Versailles system of
robbery, and supports with all its energy the warlike preparations of
Czech imperialism. The German Social-Democrats in Czechoslovakia,
who have likewise a representative in the government, vote no less
decisively in favour ofthese warlike preparations. Czechoslovakian
Social-Democracy has direct and very close connections with French

[57]

 

 

 

and Czechoslovakian armament capital; in common with the Foreign
Minister, Benes, it pursues without reservation the foreign policy of
French imperialism, adhering to it through thick and thin.

To assert that this Social-Democracy is going a diﬂerent way from
German Social-Democracy, or that it takes a diﬂerent stand in regard
to its own capitalists, such assertions are beyond the tcmerity of even
the Social-Democrats in the Second International.

A Nor are matters otherwise in

SPAIN,

where the mass movements of the workers, and small peasants are
drowned in blood by a government, three Ministers of which are
Social-Democrats. '

They secured the passing of -the Law for the Protection of the
Republic, by virtue of which more than 400 workers and peasants have
been shot and hundreds of, organizations of revolutionary workers have
been prohibited since April, 1931. The Law for the Protection of the
Republic is enforced with the approval of the Social—Dem0cratic
Ministers, as was the case in Germany under Severing. The Communist
newspaper Manda Obrero was banned, since it opportunely disclosed
the preparations of the monarchist generals for a putsch. Then, when
General San ]'u-rjo actually staged the putsch, it was quelled, not by the
state machinery, but by the revolutionary workers, the Communists,
who disarmed his band; by way of thanks for this, however, they were
manhandled by the republican police.

In cynicism, too, the social—fascists of Spain are a match for their

-German colleagues. The government drowned in blood a movement of
the revolutionary agricultural workers of Casa di Vijesas, evincing a
brutality which surpasses that of Noske, Severing and Zorgiebel.

The Social—Democratic parliamentary fraction thereupon expressed
its conﬁdence in the government of the bourgeois and landlord bloc.

 

The leader of the Social—Democratic Party, Pristo, one of the most.

highly esteemed “ grandees ” of the Second International, made the
following statement, according to the Social—Democratic Iournal La
Lun,.in Barcelona on March 5, I933, anent this deed of blood:

“ The killing of these men was not a matter of the determination
and the will of the government; for they waged an armed struggle
against it for hours and days together. Had they given themselves
up, we should have been magnanimous to them; our magnanimity
is proved. We should have saved them from death, as we saved
General San Iurjo ” (the leader of the monarchist ,putsch——B.K.).
(Emphasis mine—B.K.).

The notorious Associations Law of April 8, 1931, is also the work

[581

 

 

.-’/I!:=r~:>'\~ \ -«es-v.~/n.. «x.

 

of the Spanish socialists ;‘ in _a.cc01_fdance with this, every strike of which
fourteen days notice has not  given to the Governor and which
is not sanctioned by him, may. be declared illegal and the trade union
organization of the strikers may be prohibited. By virtue of this law,
the revolutionary trade unions o_f Seville were suppressed for the
duration of three months, from May to August, 1931. This occurred
at the very time that the monarchists could prepare their putsch
undisturbed. By virtue of this law, local groups of the reformist trade
unions were also dissolved. Iust in the last few months the fascist
menace has been growing in Spain at a tremendoris pace; the Social-
Democrats, however, to cover the fascist onrush and pacify their own
following have already devised an “ anti-fascist racial theory.” In the
newspaper El Sozzalista March 16, 1933, they announce:

“ The racial spirit _of the Spanish is hostile to all dictatorships;

this, then, is another reason why fascism cannot force its way into

Spain.” _

Primo de Rivera over a period of years proved precisely the contrary
of this thesis by setting up and exercising in Spain the most naked
military fascist dictatorship. This “ insigniﬁcant fact,” however, does
not exist for the Social—Democrats, any more‘ than does the swiftly
growing fascist movement.

The best method of struggle against proletarian revolution—and this
struggle is the historical mission of Social—D_emocracy in Spain, too-—
may be summarily expressed by the slogan: Against proletarian
re:/olution_—the riﬂes; against fascism——the racial spirit.

In this way the Spanish proletariat is being most surely led along the
path already trodden in Germany.

Even under a microscope it would be very diﬂicult to perceive
“ tactical differences ” between German and Spanish Social-Democracy.
To make such differences perceptible, at least a giant spotlight would
be necessary.

We will refrain from piling up further examples. We will pass
by a whole series of Social—Democratic parties. Merely by reason of the
concrete examples we have adduced, the following fact is now
established: ' _

It is sheer fraud for the Social-Democratic leaders to attempt now to
trace the cause of the crisis in the Second International in the attitude
of German Social-Democracy towards democracy and fascist dictator-
ship, and explain the brea/(—t4p of the Second International by diﬂer-
ences of opinion.

Is it the first time that a Social—Democratic party-—as at present in
Germany——has capitulated to fascist dictatorship, delivered the working

class into its hands and offered to come to an understandingwith it?
‘By no means! This is» ‘not the first case, no, it is not even the
most obvious case, although, owing to its international signiﬁcance, it
is the case that has created the -greatest sensation. ‘ b _
Does‘ not thevSocial-Democratic Party of ’Hungary also belong to th
Second International, and was it. not the-ﬁrst——to say nothing at all
of itsetreason during the proletarian revolution and its agreement with
Horthy and Count Bethley in I924——to give the ‘signal for the hang-
man’s Work of Horthy, by publishing the following in its central organ
Nepszat/a (People's Voice) on October 20, .1919, with ‘ the objectof
inciting the tribunals of hangmen to proceed against the proletariat:

“In numerous cases, we have already expressed our opinion that it ~

is impossible to oppose‘ the punishment of individuals who have
‘ committed crimes during the dictatorship (during the dictatorship of

the proletariat). Whoever sins against the state and society m-ust be
_ brought before the courts.” ,
~'This‘was written at a time when the present -leader of»the Social-
Democratic Party of’Hungary and participant in the congresses and
deliberations of the Second International, Karl Peyer, was a minister

in Horthy’s government ‘of hangmen. Under his ministry, -not only,

were Communists hanged en masse, but even the writer of the above-
quoted article of incitement against the Communists, Bela Somogyis,
the editor of the N epszaz/a, was foully murdered by a special detachment
of military fascists. - . A _ - a _ . _

_Who in the Second International has seen ﬁt to protest against
such “ triﬂes,” _- in the matter of the social—democratic attitude to
fascism? _  . o

Is it an accident that the military fascist dictatorship of the hangman,
King Alexander, has prohibited all parties in Iugoslaz/ia, ,even Serbian
bour.ge.ois_ parties, "yet ‘.‘ tolerates” the section of the Second Inter-
national? 'The Iugoslav Social-Democracyiis the strongest support of
the Serbian-fascist general’s dictatorship. _ 7

Was not Bulgarian Social-Democracy an active participant in the
fascist coup-d’etat of Zankov? Was not the most prominent leader of
this Party, Pasbuehou, a candidate for the position of prime minister
and a pathﬁnderfor the fascist “ revolution?” _Did not another leader
of this Party, Dimo Kasa}(oz/,.become a member of the fascist Zankov’s
murder government?" . _ ,_

Moreover, has anyone read a single word in the oﬂ-icial or semi-
ofﬁcial publications of the Second International, has anyone received as
-much as aslight hint from them, to the effect that, in view of the
participation of Bulgarian Social-Democracy in the open fascist govern-

[601

 

  

 

 

ment, the question would be,raised, at least theoretically, of the “limits”
to the aﬁirming of the state by the Social-Democratic parties?

No one has done so. For Social-Democracy, in the period of the
postwar crisis of capitalism and of proletarian revolutionary move-
ments, there is no limit to its support of the bourgeois state, the bour-
geoisie and the allies of the bourgeoisie against proletarian revolution, no
matter whether these allies are Prussian Iunkers, feudal holders of
broad acres, or Chinese Mandarins.

Social—Dcrnocracy has become, to its inmost being, a social-fascist
party since the capitalists, by “fascizing” the state, began and have
continued to seek a way out in the preparation of imperialist war and of
military intervention against the Soviet Union, and continued this.
Social-Democracy, whose historical mission has become the holding-
down, the repression of the socialist revolution, the struggle against
proletarian dictatorship, inevitably becomes, to its dying breath and to
the end of the road, a bosom companion of the capitalists. Herein lies
the development of Social-Democracy: from opportunism past social-
chauvinism-—to social fascism.

The case of Wels only shows this in a more glaring light. It is
not merely ‘an individual case; it is typical of ‘the manner in which
Social-Democracy, in deﬁnite historical situations, acts, will act and
must act in all countries. l

Such a Social—Democratic party may support its capitalists against
the proletarian revolution by all means of deception, murdering workers

~ and provocation, not one of its fraternal parties of the Second Inter-

national will see anything» blameworthy or reprehensible in this, so
long as this policy does not aﬁect the interests of the capitalists of such
a fraternal party. When that happens, however, the affability comes
to an end! ‘ . ’

Driven by the necessity of duping the workers in their own countries
with democratic phrases, and of selling themselves to their bourgeoisies
as clearly as possible, individual Social—Democratic parties, or their
leaders, may deem such a capitulation to fascism as that of German
Social—Democracy to be incxpedient, or a hasty anticipation of ‘events,
as Léon Blum has written. But this is certain: it is not the relationship
of Hitler to the German proletariat, but the relationship of Hitler to
France and to her allies (Poland, the little Entente, ete.), that makes the
attitude of German Social-Democracy towards Hitler intolerable to the
French socialists.

Here, in the domain of the relationships between states, but not in
the domain of relationships of Social-Democracy to the bourgeois state,
to the question: democracv or dictatorship, the underlying causes of the

4

. crisis in the Second International‘ must be sought.

To this chapter on the tail of the Second International we have still
to add the tail end: Monsieur Leon Trotsky and his world—redeeming,
counter—revolutionary sect, which stands outside the working class.
What Hitler has not succeeded in doing, Trotsky would like to achieve:
he would fain make an end of the Communist Party of Germany and
obliterate it completely. He accuses Vandervelde of “ hysteria,” when
the latter gives expression to his fear that the tactics of the Executive
Committee of the German Party in regard to Hitler are driving
Social—Democracy into the abyss. Trotsky tries to persuade the leaders
of the Austrian Social—Democrats that they should wrest power from
Dollfuss in a revolutionary way for the purpose of restoring
“ democracy.” But the Communist Party of Germany, the Party that
day by day wages the most self-sacriﬁcing and most heroic struggle, he
will have none of. This, however, does not prevent him from giving
his sectarian fraternity counsel, for which Hitler’s police themselves
proffer him grateful thanks. This is what he says: .

“ We will put forward in the Communist cells the demand not to
circulate the bad official literature, to boycott the apparatus, to break
off connections with the Central Committee. It is clear that we will
carry out all this tactfully and reasonably, with regard to the degree
of development of the cell members, as well as to the circumstances.”
Truly, we have here a model for the activities of the state police,

detailed by Hitler to practise provocation work in the illegalized Com-
munist Party of Germany.

VII 7
‘ ‘ARMS_ CLASH——INTERNATIONALISM VANISHES

Each Social-Democratic Party combats communism in its own
country, combats the dictatorship of the proletariat in the name of
“democracy ” by all requisite means, in order to hold down the revolu-
tionary movement in its own land (and also in its own colonies); it cares
for or manages the affairs of its own capitalists within and without
the capitalist state machine, to weather the crisis of its own capitalism
at the expense of the working class and other toiling sections in its
own country; it represents the interests of its own imperialism  the
basis provided by the Versailles Peace.-

All the Social-Democratic parties are united in an international organ-
ization, they support with their united strength the struggle against the
common enemy of the _world bourgeoisie, against the land of ‘prole-
tarian dictatorship, against Soviet Russia; with united strength they
combat the international danger of world bolsbevism, the Communist
International, and the revolutionary struggles of the colonial peoples
for freedom; they form the complement of the international organiza-

[52]

..., p

tion of the" great imperialist powers, the League of Nations, particularly
to the extent" that the stabilization of world capitalism through the
overthrow of the Socialist Soviet Republics and at the expense of the
colonial peoples, is in question; they support the activities of the League
in every case, whether it be that in such case “peaceful” means be
employed, or whether it be that a “ solution by force of arms ” must
be supported. '

This conception might well have presented itself to the minds of the
Social—Democratic leaders, when they patched the Second International
together again before the beginning of capitalist stabilization.

In this ‘historical conception the “internationalism” of the Second
International is expressed. Need many more words  wasted to prove
that this produce of the prostitution of the workers’ movement has not
the least thing in common with proletarian intemationalism? Is it
conceivable that such parties which, all and sundry, feel themselves in
solidarity with their own capitalists, with their nationalist, imperialist
aims, and lead the struggle against the revolutionary proletariat-—that
these parties could be the bearers of proletarian internationalism?
Although,‘ as Engels wrote, the proletariat is internationalist by its
inner nature, nevertheless proletarian internationalism arose as the ex—
pression‘ of a more developed consciousness of the working class, as
a product of its becoming conscious not only of the antagonism, but
also‘ of theirreconcilability of the ‘interests of the‘ working class with
those of the capitalists of ‘its own nation.’ Proletarian internationalism
means‘ not merelyunderstanding of the community of interests of the
proletariat of all lands, not only the mutualdsupport and the common
struggle of the workers of the diﬁerent nations‘; it means no less that
each working class must,‘ above all, smite its own capitalists. In the
epoch of imperialism—-of «imperialist wars ‘and proletarian revolutions—-
and particularly at the time of the general crisis of capitalism, of the
victory of the socialist revolution over a sixth of the earth’s surface,
proletarian internationalisrn makes still lziglzerdemands on the working
class: increased co—ordination of the ﬁghting activities of the working
class against the ‘common actions of international imperialism, which
purpose weathering thecri-sis ‘of the capitalist system and preparing new
imperialist wars; in particular, however, increased co—ordination of
fighting activities for the protection of those parts of the proletariat
that stand at the most advanced posts in the ﬁght against the common
foe. Proletariarr internationalism demands ‘coordination of ﬁghting
acdvities in support of the proletarian ‘dictatorship-—temporarily, to be
sure," only in the Soviet Union, which at the moment, is still the sole
Soviet Repub1ic——as well as of the national revolutionary movement in
China, of the Chinese Sovietterritories. ' ' 7

[63]

 

 

 

A It is obvious that the Second International represented and represents
the exact opposite of what a Marxist conceives as proletarian inter-
nationalism.

The policy of the Second International during the whole of the
post-war period has signiﬁed, as we have already established above,

the declaration of the policy of August 4, I914, in permanence. If

opportunism in its less developed form was already irreconcilable with
proletarian internationalism, then August 4 plainly signiﬁed a leap
forward in the development of opportunism in the workers’-movement,
namely, a leap into social chauzzinism. Opportunism and social-
chum/inism are two stages of class-collaboration at two stages of histor-
ical deuelopment, as Lenin has demonstrated with classic clarity.
(Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second International):

“ The political essence of social-chauz/inism and opportunism is the
same. It expresses itself in class collaboration, repudiation of prole-
tarian dictatorship, rejection of revolutionary action, obeisance to the
bourgeoisie and bourgeois legality, lack‘ of conﬁdence in the prole-
tariat, -conﬁdence in the bourgeoisie . . . . Social-chauvinism is a
direct continuation of and a logical conclusion from Millerandism,
Bernsteinism, the English liberal Labour Party it is their sum total,
their consummation, their highest ach.iez/ement.” (Lenin, Collected
Works, Vol. XVIII, p. 398). (Emphasis mine—B.K.).

The imperialist development and concomitant decay of capitalism
have not remainedsat a standstill. The proletarian revolution has be-
come a fact; in contrast to the general crisis of capitalism, we have a
mighty rise of socialist economy in the Soviet Union. Revolutionary
class struggle and proletarian internationalism have made their home
in the Communist International. In its development Social—Democracy
has called a halt to social—chauvinism just as little as capitalism has
halted. It has played its role of prize—ﬁghter of capitalism, of the
bourgeois state an-d of imperialist reaction, in the ring of bourgeois
democracy, where it has exercised every means of mental and material
violence. “It was the Social—Dernocratic. parties that rescued capitalisin
from proletarian revolution "in the lands wherethe class struggle grew
most acute. They did this, in the struggle against proletarian dictator-
ship, in the name of “' democracy," i.e., bourgeois democracy. Their
international organizations also, the Second and‘ the Amsterdam Inter-
nationals, basing themselves on the principle of equal rights, taiclass
treason, have done their share in rescuing the new order of the imperi-
alist system created-‘by the World War. Attheir congresses and other
conferences the deliberations have revolved round two weighty
questions: the Versailles system and the Soviet Union——the defendin
of the former and the combating of the latter. V

[64]

 

 

 

     

' The prerequisite for the re—establishment of the Second International
was a certain stabilization of the Versailles frontier: through repeated
“ voluntary ” renunciation of a revision on the part of the bourgeoisies
of the defeated and plundered countries, in order to bring about, in
this way, an international collaboration that would make possible a

certain capitalist stabilization. This would, in turn, make possible the ,

international collaboration of all Social—Democratic parties. The first
words of the re—established Second International were:

‘. . . The restoration of the devastated areas remains one of - the
most essential conditions of the material and moral paciﬁcation of
Europe, and it is incontestable that the burdens of this restoration
must be borne by Germany . . . .” (Proceedings of the International
-Socialist Labour Congress in Hamburg,.I923, p. 102.).

“Directly after this came another resolution, which bore the title:
International Struggle against International Reaction, and in which an
onslaught on the Soviet Republic was announced: '

_“ It (the Congress) condemns the continued employment of terrorist
methods by the Russian Government and the casting aside of demo-
cratic foundations, as a menace, not only to, the Russian ‘workers,
but to the most important interests of the international proletariat.”
(Ibid., p. 105.). i

»No doubt the Social—Dernocrats of the defeated countries put their

_ signatures to those agreements which endorsed the Versailles system,

with gnashings of teeth; they did thismerely to the extent that their
bourgeoisies also stood on the same ground of given facts and sought
to overcome the crisis of capitalism from this platform. On the con»
trary, they acted in complete inner harmony when they assumed a
hostile attitude to the Soviet Union. They had a double interest in this;
On the one hand, they sought to weather the crisis of world capitalism
at the cost of the Soviet Union, in order to avoidrthe heaping or
this cost by stronger irnperialisms on the bourgeoisie. of weaker
countries; on the other hand, there was the fact that the victorious
proletarian revolution, in the land of socialism-in-the-making, the com-
munist movement, endangered their mass basis in the working class.

Be there ever so many shades of opinion in the Second International
on the subject of the Soviet Union—fr_om° the frankly whiteguardist
and -interventionist ‘standpoint of Kautsky to the conciliatory attitude of
Otto Bauer, and, beyond this, to the “friendship towards the Soviet”
of Maxton,—-one thing is certain: that the parties of the Second Inter-
national were, and still are today, the advance guard of imperialism
in the ﬁght against the Soviet Union. Who can forget that the little

phrase, “ red imperialism,” was coined by Social-Democracy? Has

and is: open life and death struggle against tlae $01/iet Union. The
change: in its method: of agitation up to the point of recognizing the
duty of the international proletariat to protect the Soviet Union, are
opportunist phenomena, means of betrayal, dished up as concession: to the
international working class, whose sympathies for the land of socialism
and whose readiness to defend the Soviet Union are growing.

The deepest, most hidden meaning of the Second Internation_al’s
“ policy of conciliating the peoples” is precisely that, by “ conciliating "
the imperialist powers, their capacity to ﬁght world bolshevism is to be
increased. The principal aim of the domestic, as well as the inter-
national politics of all sections of the Second International always was
and still is, to ward oﬁ Bolsheueism.

Nothing  this respect is more characteristic than the deliberations of
the Vienna Congress of the Second International in 1931. The Vienna
Congress made the central point of its debates on foreign politics the
stniggle for a Franco-German understanding, for the ﬁnancial support
of German trustiﬁed capital by the ‘Paris Bourse, in order to avoid an
economic catastrophe  Germany. As the highest expression of
international working class solidarity, Otto Bauer, Breitscheid and Léon
Blum offered up a common prayer, from all the Social-Democratic
parties to the wolves of the Paris Bourse and their political agents
(from Tardieu to Herriot), begging them to open up their money—bags
to Thyssen, Krupp, von Bohlen and the big German banks. At the
same time, the well—known political wirepuller, Rechberg, was con-
ducting similar negotiations with the magnates of French heavy in-
dustry——with the avowed objectaf placing Germany under the hegemony
of France in the anti—Soviet front. Immediately after ‘there followed
the correspondence between the French ex—an1:i-militarist and patented
jingo Gustav Herué, and Adolf Hitler, in which the plan of a Franco-
German understanding, directed against the Soviet Union and prole-
tarian revolution in Germany, was discussed. On behalf of Herrenltlub"
circles, Herr von Papen conducted like negotiations with French arma-
ment capital, with the ﬁrm‘Schneider-Creurot.

Are not these parallel endeavours for the “ conciliation of the peoples ”
just too moving manifestations 0 “international solidarity? Léon
Blum and Hervé, Breitscheid and Hitler, Otto Bauer and Rechberg and
von Papen—-in this bunch of blooms, in very truth, the blossom of the

  

". Nobleman’s Club.

German and French sections of the Second International is united-with
the ﬂower of the international of mass murder.

One must not, however, imagine that all this was only a caricature

of history during a deﬁnite period. Not in the least.
, The existence of the Second International, the international organ-
ization of Social—Democratic parties, every one of which maintains
unbroken collaboration with its own capitalists, depends in vital
measure on the international cooperation of imperialist countries with
one another.

Of course, co-operation of the imperialist powers is actually im—
possible for any length of time; the antagonistic robber—interests com-
pletely exclude it. Nevertheless, agreements of a temporary nature
between imperialist powers or groups of powers are possible-—to be
sure, mostly at the expense of a third power or group of powers. In
this conection, it is not absolutely necessary that all the participants in
such an agreement should enter into it “voluntarily.” The Dawes
and Young pacts on the plunderings of Germany, as well as the
Washington Agreement on the forms and methods of plundering China,
are very far from being “ voluntary ” agreements of the participants
in these compacts. The world system of imperialism is a system of the
subjection of the weaker by the stronger, the plundering of the less
powerful by the more powerful, through a display of naked force, or
potential force.

It could not be otherwise than that the relations in the Second Inter-
national should more or less clearly reflect the relations among the
imperialist powers. The famous principle of non-interference with the
“internal” aﬁairs of the individual national parties, was and is merely
an expression of the fact that the bourgeois labour parties parley with
one another, indeed, but without their bourgeoisies can make no sort
of decisions. How should the International of the Social-Democratic
parties decide independently concerning the political affairs of‘ the
individual parties, when all these aﬁairs are actually the common
-concern of the Social—Democratic Party in question and its own
capitalists.

Thus the foreign policy and the political method of the Second
International were and are nothing but a policy and method of work,
tinted with socialist-internationalist hues, of the international organiza-
tion of imperialism, the League of Nations: rotten, tentative, oaeil-‘
lating compromises, non-interference with the internal aﬁair: of the
individual parties (always excepted those cases where individual
countries were violated by the great imperialist powers in common),
and the endeavour to adjust the antagonisms at the expense of a third
party, the Socialist country, the Soviet Union.

I

THE FATE AND END OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL

HE Labour and Socialist International, known as -the Second In-

I ternational, has arrived at a new stage" in its disintegration. Its
largest, and at one time most powerful, national section, the
Social-Democratic Party of Germany, in fact no longer belongs to the
Second International. In the ofﬁcial organ of Austrian Social-Demo-
cracy, the Vienna Arbeiterzeitung of February 7, 1933, the prominent
leader of French Social—Democracy, Leon Blum, places on record that:

“ The relations between the German Party and the International
have virtually ceased.”

The leader of the Austro—Marxists, Otto Bauer found no words for
this most important event in the life of the Second International. The
split was placed on record in the leading organ of the Second Inter-
national by a Frenchman. There could be found no German Social-
Democrat, not even one from Austria, who dared to place the “ respon-
sibility ” for the disintegration of the Second International on the Ger-
man Social-Democrats. The Frenchman’s declaration, on the other
hand, was intended merely to keep up the appearance of inter-
nationalism in the Second International. The fact, however, that the
disintegration of the Second International has begun, could not be con-
cealed, any more than it was possible -to conceal the organizational dis-
solution of shipwrecked Social-Democracy in Germany.

A section of the Second International which, although having a
smaller membership, played a very important part in the international
sphere, the Independent Labour_ Party of Great Britain (I.L.P.), at its
last Party Conference oﬂ'icially'declared its withdrawal from the Second
International. . ‘ '

The Finnish Social-Democratic Party, too, threatens official withdrawal
from the Second International.

  

In the Social-Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia, inﬂuential organiza- --

tions "declared that they are not in agreement with the decisions of the
Executive of the Second International. The Pilsen organ of the Czecho-
slovakian Social-Democratic Party, “ Nova-Doba ” has already presented
an ultimatum to the Z1'irich'International and has done so because of

[5].

 

 

‘ Anagreement directed against the Soviet Union was the most natural
course for the intrigues of the imperialist powers to take during the
whole post—war period. Therefore, .. the Second International’s “ work
of conciliating the peoples,” too, was always merely a counterpart to
their anti—Soviet activities within the compass of preparations for
military intervention in the Soviet Union.- That such an arrangement
has not been reached can only be ascribed to the unswerving pcacepolicy
of the Soviet Union and the increasing superiority of the Soviet system.

The Second International’s “ activities in conciliating the peoples ”
were, naturally, not crowned with success. The bourgeoisie of every
country endeavours to liquidate its economic crisis, not only at the
expense of its own working class, at the expense of the toilets of the
Soviet Union and of the colonial peoples, but also at the expense of the
buorgeoisie of other countries. - The stabilization of capital is at an end,

it has been upset by the world economic crisis that has developed within‘

the general crisis of the capitalist system; the antagonism of interests of
the imperialist powers has become so acute that preparations for war
in the immediate future are in full swing in every direction. This
is taking place largely with the intention of trying to overcome the

. crisis in one portion of the imperialist world, at any rate partially, at the

expense of the other portions._ The ever more extensive and direct
preparations of the imperialist powers_:for the redivision of the world
have led, on the basis of the world economic crisis, to the end of
capitalist stabilization, have led to thewar of Iapanese imperialism in
the Far East on China, to the exit of Iapan from the League of Nations,
to the crisis in the League, of Nations, to the Disarmament Conference

as a method of masking the increase in imperialist‘ armaments, to the "

bankruptcy of this conference, to the more violent offensive of capital
against the working class in all_capita1ist countries, as well as to the
strengthening of imperialist reaction, to, the strengthening of fascization
tendencies and to civil war against the working masses engulfed by the
revolutionary upsurge in many capitalist lands.

We have seen how, with the strengthening of fascist tendencies before
our eyes, Social—Democracy has come to social—fascism. To—day, in the
example of Germany, we see withextraordinary clarity that the offen-
sive of capital, the fascization of the bourgeois state, and, in -connection
with this, the fascization of Social—Democracy signify not merely a concen-
tration of bourgeois power against proletarian revolution in the home-
land, but also the preparation for direct transition to imperialist war,
and to anti-Soviet military intervention.

It is not Hitler’s home politics, the abolition of the most elementa
rights of the German workers still remaining from theGerman Revolu-
tion and the Weimar Constitution, nor the bestial furies of the fascist

[53]

 

  

Storm Troops, who cut strips of ﬂesh from the backs of living
workers, that decided the attitude of the Social—Democratic parties to
German fascism. All this cost Messrs- Léon Blum, Vandervelde,
Niedzialkeovski and Bechyne scarcely the swelling of a tear gland.
If it were only a matter of making the German workers disfranchised
helots, of torturing them to death and “ shooting them while trying to
escape,” then Hitler’s agents from the Social—Democratic camp, on

K returning from the tour they made to counteract the “ atrocity propa-

ganda,” could have proudly announced to Propaganda-Chief Gobbelsz
It is done, the international solidarity of Social—Democracy is a living
reality; our comrades abroad have nothing to say against collaboration
with the present representatives of the “ majority of. our people;” they
will report on the events in our common fatherland in a manner beseem—
ing cultured people. .

vWhy it happened, and had to happen, otherwise, why many Social-
Democratic leaders in the lands that are menaced by Hitler’s taking
ofﬁce, gave the cold shoulder to Victor Schiff, foreign editor of
Vorwarts, on his propaganda tour undertaken for Hitler, Vandervelde
has divulged. In the article already cited (Le Peuple, February 12,

1933), in which he defended German Social—Democracy’s policy of the

  

“ lesser evil,” he gave expression--for reasons connected with the in-
terests of his Belgian fatherland——to his anxiety concerning the Hitler
policy of German Social—Democracy in the following words:

“ The Labour Party, the Belgian Section of the Socialist Labour
International, cannot pay enough attention to the reactions that the
events ‘in Germany are having . . . . In the Walloon country (the
east province of Belgium, on the German fron-tier——B.K.) . . . people
in the Belgian Labour Party are afraid that an army of invasion

, will appear from the east, and there the qestion is peremptorily asked:

Can we still rely on Social—Democracy (i.e., on German Social-

Democracy—B.K.), to keep the peace.”

It is therefore believed in the Walloon country that the German
territories annexed" by Belgium are in danger, and also, perhaps, that
Belgian Congo might be endangered. Renaudel, again, spoke more
plainly to Victor Schiﬁ; he spoke once more of the “ Boches,” when the
envoy of VVels paid him a visit on behalf of his party.

The decomposition, the splitting of the Second International is hound
up with the Faseization of Germany in the same measure as this
fascization promotes and develops the splitting of imperialist Europe
into two camps. This splitting of Europe into two imperialist camps
has become, although not yet in quite complete form, a fact. Each
party of the Second International, however, must march into its own
military camp before the peoples are placed on a war footing, in order

I59]

 

 

 

 
 

to be ready and able to take a becoming part in 1.1:: preparation: for
the “defence ” of its own land.

The Second ‘International has survived the outbreak of war in the

‘Far East without a crisis. It is, in actuality a European organization._

Only on the question of the danger of war between Japan and the
Sovi‘etUnion did diﬂerencesof opinion arise, Hilferding making the
disclosure, at the session of the Second International-’s Bureau, that the
victory of the Soviet Union in a Soviet—]apanese war would be a blow
to the Second International, while Herr Liebermamz explained that one
ought not to make demands on the Polish Social—Democrats that bring
them in conflict with their conscience, such as the demand for the
defence of the Soviet Union. If the crisis of the Disarmament Con-
ference was already a severe strain on the Second International’s
capacity to carry its paciﬁsm, then the cleavage of Europe" into two
imperialist camps, which was widened by Hi'tler’s assumption of power,
of neeessity brought to light the rottenness of this International-
although not yet to its full ”exent——-and led to its wider spread. ”

_ The Hitler government has come to the helm largely on the waves of
an unbridled nationalism, of the nationalist hatred ~ of Versailles.
The military spirit of Frederick the Great and of  Prussian barracks
presided over the opening of the Reichstagl in _ the Potsdam Garrison
Church. Hitler’s program speech did not, indeed, go much further
than the demands of Briining, Von Papen and Schleicher in the
questions of Germany’s right to equalityiin the sphere of armaments;
on the other hand, however, these demands were to a considerable
extent realized without an intérz2a'tibn'g_l 4 reementt, All the questions
that were “ settled ” by the dictates of Versailles, are raised by the mass
agitation of the fascists, questions that are ' directed against France,
against Poland, against Denmark and against Belgium; they have raised
the question of union with Austria and—Fthough not in such open form
—of union with German areas’ in Czechoslovakia.

Before the war, the German army consisted of eight hundred
thousand soldiers; it has now attained a strength of ﬁve hundred
thousand men, and by the end of the year, the army will have been
increased to one million one hundred thousand strong. The armament
industry in Hitlerland is already working full steam ahead, and, even if
it is not in a position to diminish unemployment, still it is already
making preparations for the quickest, though bloody solution of the
problem of what is to be done ,with the human material Izhathas

lost colonies. ~

Hitler’s first steps in foreign politics rather recalled the proverbial
debut of the bull in a china shop; they led to a series of foreign
political defeats for the Hitler government, which was compelled to
climb down largely in connection with the Soviet Union, as well as,
under Italian pressure, in the question of union with Austria.

Nevertheless, since Hitler’s assumption of oﬂice the outlines of two
imperialist groups are much more sharply drawn on the map of Europe
than previously: the group of usufructuaries and guardians of the
Versailles Peace system under the leadership of France——the lands of
the Little Entente (lugoslavia, Czechoslovakia _and Rumania), ‘Poland
and Belgium—-on the one side; and, on the other, the group striving
for a revision of the Versailles Peace system——Germany, Hungary,
Austria and, in part, Bulgaria and Greece, in the last two of which the
struggle for power between French and Italian imperialism has not yet
been decided.

Which group England will join is still uncertain. The visit of
MacDonald to Rome, the plan of a Four Power Directory for Europe
and the detlironeirient of the League of Nations by such a Directory,
have, for the time being, brought a decision no nearer; the same holds
good for the discussions with Roosevelt in America. In England,
inﬂuential circles __in the Conservative Party, that party whose com-
mercial traveller MacDonald is, have taken the side of France and
snubbed Hitler. On the other hand, there are strong forces at work
in the same party which, through their connections with fascist Germany
and the revision—17_loc, would like not only to shake France’s position
of Continental hegernony~—following the traditional policy of Great
Britain—-but also to -bring about the formation of a new anti-Soviet bloc
under English leadership. They would like to win over Italy, also, to
this plan, and, of course, are relying upon Germany.

This much, however, is certain: the formation of a government by
Hitler has already accelerated the clearly marked regrouping of the
imperialist powers; it has widened the cleavage of Europe into two
mutually antagonistic groups of imperialist powers. Europe, indeed,
finds itself in a ,position of still more immediate preparation for im-
perialist war that} a feta months ago—in connection with which Stalin’:
words: “ The more acute the antagonisms of.the imperialist powers

become, the more they try to solve these antagonisms at the expense of

the Soviet Union”——»become more and more true in the existing condition
of Europe and the whole world. .
Sabre—rattling, clash of arms, open threats of war, journeyings to and

[71]

 

 

 

crooks and professional diplomats, espionage and acts of diversion on a

‘large scale, increased activity in the armament works and frontier

fortiﬁcations—such are the distinguishing features of the position in all
Europe. G§ring’s words: “ The obligation that has been inscribed in
blood must be discharged,” and the words of the Czechoslovakian
Foreign Minister, Benes: “He who wants revision, wills war,” collide
in an atmosphere heavy with war.

If one camp mobilizes. against the Peace dictates under the slogan of
revision of the Versailles frontiers, the other camp mobilizes against
Hitler, Mussolini and Horthy under the slogan of defence of democracy.

Wels in Potsdam champions the foreign political aims of German
fascism against Versailles; Blum in Paris champions Versailles and the
defence of democracy against fascism.

The Second International splits and falls to pieces on this question; it ‘

will fall to pieces at the same rate as war—preparations progress. The
speed of its disintegration will quicken in the measure as the imperi—
alist bourgeoisie ﬁnds it superﬂuous or injurious to employ any longer
the paciﬁst phrases and the “ internationalism ” of its Social—Democratic
Parties among the masses, as means of preparing for war. .

In this connection, it must not be forgotten that in the imperialist war
which is being prepared with the close co—operation of both groups in
the Second International, the issue will not be the abolition of the
Versailles system, any more than it will be the defence of democracy.
The aim is rather: the rediz/ision of the world amongst the imperialist
Powers, ‘the establishment of a new robber—peace system, a new V er-
sailles, a new Trianon, a new Saint-Germain, new annexations, creation
of states embracing many nations, with oppressed “ national minorities,”
and redistribution of the “elbow room” of the big imperial powers
in the colonial, semi—colonial and dependent countries.

Italian, German and Hungarian fascism preach a national war.
Mussolini thinks to conquer fresh Iugoslav territories (the annexed
German territory of the Southern Tyrol would, of course, be retained),
to transform the colonial peoples of Northern Africa, who are at
present plundered and shot down by French imperialism and its
colonial troops, into objects of robbery and pillage for the Bank of Italy
and his Fascist bands, and, ﬁnally, to annex to Italy, Abyssinia and the
entire coastal area of the Red Sea. Hitler—Germany would like to re-
conquer Polish te"rritory in the Corridor and in Poland, to push forward
its frontiers as far as Narva and the Soviet border, to regain Alsace, to
assimilate Austria and German Bohemia, and to receive in place of its
lost colonies some French colonial territory. Horthy-Hungary would
like to set up again the old Hungarian prison of the oppressed
Roumanians, Slovaks, Serbians and Croats. I

[72]

 
 

   

3.‘

A" war of the rewsion—bloc will be no more a national, progressive,
just war, than a war of the defenders of the Versailles frontiers will be
democratic, progressive and just. The fascist, Pilsudski, in Poland,
Alexander Karageorgicvich, the crowned chieftain of the military
fascist bands in Iugoslavia, and King Carol in.the stolen pogro-m land
of-Rumania, these confederates of Herriot in France and Masaryk in
Czechoslovakia and Vandervelde in Belgium, are not a minute behin

, Mussolini, Hitler and Horthy. ‘ '

The anti—fascisrn of France and her Social—Democracy, and of the
Social—Democratic parties of the countries allied to her, weighs no
heavier in the scale than the anti-Versailles standpoint of the fascist
revision-bloc and " its Social-Democratic parties."

The first group ‘stands up for democracy against fascism, in order
to be able to hold on to the war-loot gained out of the Vers_ailles
Peace; the second group struggles against the Versailles system, in order
to create anew Versailles.

And all this is being prepared by the two imperialist blocs, aided
and abetted by the Social—Democratic parties. This is the ground the
Second International has trodden ‘in the period and process’ of it!‘
dissolution anew. I

Whereas the parties of the Second International, in its pre-war period,
could still make a verbal protest against the war immediately prior to
August 4, 1914, before they drove the workers, like a herd of cattle,
to the shambles of imperialist mass massacre; whereas the Bureau of
the Second International could still assemble to almost its full strength
on‘August yr, 1914; thedisintegrationof the Second International in its
post—war period was bound to set in even before the outbreak of a fresh
imperialist tour in Europe. Nothing in this regard will be changed,
even if, perchance, in place of Wels some other German social—fascist
endeavours in some way to temporarily patch up or to conceal the
profound disunion in the Second International. The essence of the
development of social—democracy into social—fascism consists in a much
closer and more direct collaboration of the parties of the Second Inter-
national with ‘their own bourgeoisies than was the case during the war
and immediate po’st.—’war periods, when much more latitude was still
accorded to all kinds of social-chauvinists than is given to the social-
fascists today. Many who would not believe in the existence of a
soeiabfaseism, who could not conceive that sociaI—democracy would not
only betraysocialism, but at the command of the bourgeoisie, would
surrender even the positions of capitalist-democracy to fascism, may
now bestow a retrospective glance on the workings of the Second Inter-
national, at least since the beginning of the world economic crisis,

the new revolutionary upsurge and the intensiﬁed preparations for
imperiavlist war, to be convinced of their error.

These workings of the Second International-—'ex~pressed in a single
sentence—-‘consist in the intensiﬁed disarming of the working class in
view of the oﬁensive of capital, in "view of the beginning of
new. civil wars of fascism against the proletariat. But both-—

,the oﬁensive of capital and the employment of fascist methods

of civil war against the working class—vvere and are nothing
else but methods of preparing within the working class the new ime
perialist war. Without intensiﬁed oppression of the proletariat the
transition to war is impossible. Social—Democracy, which in its time,
by force and fraud prevented the proletariat from transforming the
imperialist war into a. civil war for the overthrow of capitalism and from
making it really the last imperialist war, has in fact, by bringing
fascist civil war upon the disarrned proletariat also prepared a fresh
imperialist war. The Second International has thereby fulﬁlled its
historical mission in the post—war period, As an intemational, there
now remains little more for it to do. Now it can dissolve in peace;
it can disintegrate into its component parts, whith will now take sides
with their own bourgeoisies and light each other even before the wares
they have already done during the previous imperialist  The
Second International has done all that it could for the bourgeoisie, for
capitalism; it has split the working class not once, but every day, to
make it incapable of fulﬁlling its historical mission. That it has not
succeeded in this, is precisely the historical merit of the Communist
International. .

The Second International deserves that the bourgeoisie erect a
monument of a magnitude and design equal to the talents of its
greatest artists to it. This monument should bear the inscription:
“Erected to the Second International in appreciation of its zealous
efforts to ‘save capitalism."

_ VIII '
UNITED FRONT FOR ALL THAT

In tragic accents, the leaders of the Second International implored
"German Social-Democracy to preserve, at least, the appearance of
adopting’ an oppositional attitude to Hitler and begged it not to
disavow “in-ternationalism so openly.” At the beginning of May
appeared in the international so"cial—demo‘crati‘c press an elaborate speech
of Otto Wels at the party conference of the S.D.G., in which the
backslider (we quote from the International Information of the Secre-
tariat of the Second International of May 6, 1933) adhered once more to
the policy of his party in the following words:

[74]

 

  

 

 

“ Social—Democracy has done great things since 1918; it has nothing
to disavow or to palliate.” '

Therefore, all that has happened was right, particularly the brutal
persecution of the Communists in view of the onward march of the
National-Socialists to power, under cover of the machine guns of the
social-democratic police, and, above all, the rejection of the Communist
Party’s oﬁers on July 20 and January 30 of a united front in common

. defence against fascism.

Wels leaves us in no doubt that social—democracy, as long as it lives,
will oppose a hostile front to the Communists, to proletarian dictator-
ship. In this even the fascist dictatorship can make no change. The
proletariat has itself to blame for Hitler’s accession to power: Wels,
indeed, has observed in his speech:

“It was the working class itself that had not yet grown up to the
tremendous problems of the times, and that split when unity was
more imperative than ever."

That the German working class was not yet far enough advanced in
its development to prevent the temporary victory of fascism, is a fact,
which permits of no concealment. That it let itself be “ split when unity
was more imperative than ever,” permits of denial just as little. But
it is no less ﬁrmly established that this backwardness in development of
the German working class was conditioned precisely by the fact that
the majority of the proletariat in Germany followed the slogans of
German social-democracy.

Herr Wels and the leaders of the Second International have no
occasion to reproach ‘the German working class. They may rather
take some pride in them. For was it not German social-democracy that
issued the slogans: “ No separate actions, Follow constitutional paths,
Do not follow the Communists into the revolutionary struggle.”

But how, then, has it defended this Constitution? How has it
exploited the constitutional path in Potsdam? How did it exploit
the constitutional path, the legal posibilities, under Hitler’s dictator-
ship? (The National Conference of the S.P.D. in the Reichstag Building
was, to be sure, an exploitation of legal possibilities, when Goring, after
the model of the delousing stations of the Imperial Prussian army,
instituted a de~semitizing station for Social—Democracy, in order to make
the Party’s Executive Committee Aryan. That Géring then had the
Party’s Executive Committee, even after it had become Aryan, arrested,
merely indicates that the fascists are not scrupulously loyal partners).

By no means do we put this question to those who have gone over
individually to the National Socialists. Nor do we put it to those who,
in relation to the workers, cynically acknowledge that fascism is to be
preferred to proletarian revolution, as the “lesser evil.” Rather, we

[75]

 

 

wish to put this question to those Don Quixotes of the “liberal legis-
lation,” to those adorers of the “ splendours of the constitutional
system,” to those eulogists of the “ blessings of its liberal institutions,”
to such people within the working class itself, people who let themselves
be persuaded that bourgeois democracy represented the way to socialism.

We wish to put this question to those believers in the unique power of
the ballot-paper, to those “ forceless ones,” who have spurned the force
of the proletarian revolution, of the proletarian dictatorship, when the
force of the bourgeoisie stormed and raged against the proletariat. We
wish to put this question to those who let themselves be convinced that
a weapon is——a weapon, whether it be turned against, the proletariat or
against the bourgeoisie. We wish ‘to put this question to those who let
themselves be humbugged by the clique of social-democratic leaders into
the belief that democracy is--simply democracy, that democracy is
bound up with no class, that there is no bourgeois and no proletarian
democracy, and that dictatorship in every form, whether dictatorship
of the bourgeoisie or dictatorship of the proletariat, is to be rejected.

Why unity?’ Perchance for the “struggle along constitutional paths,”
as social—democracy proposed and proposes? But has not the working
class in Germany been “ split ” precisely in the name of this “ struggle ”
along constitutional paths, when it attempted to throw into the scale
the power given to it by its position in the production process,- at least
in the form of a political mass strike, as the Communists several
times proposed. \Vhat is the meaning of “constitutional path ” in
Germany today, when Hitler-—in the opinion of Otto Wels and Léon
Blum (see Arbeiterzeitung, April 7, 1933)—has gained power by a
“ democratic ascent ”? What else does this ﬂower of speech signify save
enrolment of the Storm Troops in the state apparatus, subjection
of the trade unions to “ assimilation,” robbery of the workers’ funds
by fascist commissars, ejection of class—conscious workers from the
factories, depriving them of a living in favour of yellow strike—breakers,
annihilation of the workers’ press, prohibition of strikes, hunger and
starvation for the proletarians, and again and again hunger? To
remain in constitutional paths would mean that all the German workers
would range themselves behind Wels and Leipart, and, prostrated on
the ground, with self-manacled hands, would wait until Hitler suc-
ceeded in consolidating his power; that they would avoid the struggle,
which the revolutionary workers, under the leadership of the Com-
munist Party, are waging with self-sacriﬁcing heroism. The struggle
against fascism, for the liberty of the working class, for the “ rights of
democratic freedom,” when it is conducted on the ground of bour—
geois democracy, of the democratic Constitution, and remains conﬁned
to this, means renunciation of any struggle at all.

[76]

  

 

s The best defenders of capitalist power in moments of danger are not
the capitalists themselves, who regard the legal institutions of the
capitalist state with cynical dubiety, and, from their safe positions
behind ramparts bristling with bayonets, survey the juristic mantle of
the bourgeois~democratic state, just as that of the bourgeois—corporative
state, with supercilious smiles and disdain. The best defenders of the
bourgeoisie and the capitalist system are those who‘ have illusions, and
who.sow these illusions among the workers.

Let the German bourgeoisie, let the master classes in otherlands
of fascism treat the Social-Democratic leaders to kicks, let them feed
them caster-oil, sneer and spit at them; social—democracy, as the source
of the illusions. concerning the constitutional way, concerning the
parliamentary methods of “-class struggle round the table,” of ‘‘ force-
lessness,” social—democracy, as the chief agent in the demobilization
of the revolutionary forces of the working class, remains the principal
social support of the bourgeoisie under all methods and forms of
bourgeois power.

About what should the Second International still have to negotiate
with the Communist International, after it has forbidden its sections to
conduct negotiations concerning the offers of the Communist Parties to
organize the struggle again.s-t fascism jointly? Perchance about the
.“ constitutional way ” "to proceed «against fascism? Perhaps about
a “ unity ” upon that basis, from which German Social—Democracy
proceeded to ﬂing wide the door to Hitler? Maybe about a “ non-
aggression pact,” that shall serve the purpose of putting one party to the
agreeme-nt——-Social—Democracy—-in a position to secure against the revo-
lutionary workers its reactionary united front with its own capitalists

in the preparations of imperialist war?

 

What prospects would -the working class have today, if it ranged
itself unitedly behind Wels, if to—day ithad unitedly let itself be fed
with promises in the "‘ constitutional way,” and if considerable and in-
creasing sections of the working class, under the leadership of the
C.P.G., were not carrying on the struggle for the overthrow of fascist
dictatorship unﬂinching1yP ‘ _

There would now remain only the prospects which Wels has conceded
at the party conference, where he remarked:

" Never yet has a system of government lasted forever.”

The proletarians were fed by social-democracy with the christian
doctrine of forbearance; they have experienced what it means to apply
the evangelical counsel of social—democracy: “if he smite you on the
right cheek, turn unto him the left cheek ” to the Storm Troops and
Defence Formations.

the lack of clarity in the attitude of the Executive towards German
Social—Democracy. In this ultimatum it threatens:

, “The Czech Social-Democratic Party wishes that the Ziirich Execu—
tive would openly declare to Mr. Wels that the Social-Democratic
Party of Germany, as a result of its attitude towards Hitler and
towards Ziirich, has consciously dissociated itself from the principles
of international workers’ solidarity. The Czech Social-Democratic
Party will adjust its relation: toward: the International in accordance
with the attitude of the Ziirich Executive."

In still more energetic tones this organ expresses its dissatisfaction
with the Second International on the questionof the united front. In
doing so the paper fully adopts the arguments of the condemned Otto
Wels, who likewise justiﬁed his secession from the Bureau of the Second
International on -the argument that the Second International had started
a manteuvre impossible for Social—Democracy to carry through, when it
did not reject “ on principle ” the offers of a united front in the ﬁght
against fascism made by the Communist Parties to the Social-Democratic
Parties, but only prohibited negotiations on united front action within
the framework of individual countries on ‘the pretext of the necessity for
preliminary negotiations between the two Internationals.

The presentation of this ultimatum is further supported by the argu-
ment that these decisions of the Bureau of the Second International

“ are not very clear and leave room for two interpretations. They do
not emphasize the basic and fundamental differences between Com-
munist tactics and the unshaken and steadfast principles of Social—
Democracy which are rooted in democracy.”

Thus, according to the Social-Democratic newspaper, no manoeuvres
are admissable in connection with the united front, as there is a danger
for SociaI—Democracy that the workers will really wage a struggle
against Fascism unitedly and" shoulder to shoulder. The paper further-
more explains that it should be said clearly and openly:

~“ that it (i.e., the Second International) will not negotiate in any cir—

cumstances with ‘the Moscow International . . ' according to the

attitude of the Ziirich Executive towards the demands of the healthy
socialist movement of Czechoslovakia, we, too, should deﬁnitely
adjust our relations to the International.”

This Czech paper from which we have cited these long quotations is
not of merely local importance. Its point of view is a direct reflection
of the opinion of the war industry in questions of international politics.
Behind this paper stands the Czech member of Parliament, Pick, who
only a short time ago had a seat on the administrative board of the
biggest munitions plant, the Skoda Works, as a trustee of that most

[51

  

  

  

 

 

The lesson for theworking class, however, that is to be drawn from
this, reads: Do not let yourselves be divided.

Social—Democracy would fain have it: We were united; meaning, the
Communists have split the workers’ movement.

In what did the unity of the movement of the working class consist?

In its class character; in the fact that the workers’ parties regarded
themselves as parties of the working class, waged the class struggle
against the bourgeoisie, but were not willing to administer the affairs
of the bourgeoisie.

Who has split the unity of the workers’ movement?

Those “ leaders ” of the workers, who placed the working masses
in the service of the bourgeoisie, instead of conducting the struggle
for the everyday interests and for the emancipation of the working class;
those who have turned the Socialist Parties into capitalist Labour

_ Parties.

During the war, Lenin was wont to cite the words written by a
German Social—Democra-t in the reactionary periodical “ Preussische
Iahrbiicher,” words which give a conclusive answer to the question,
who has split the workers’ movement. There it is written:

“ Its (Social—Democracy’s) character of a workers’ party with social—
list ideals must be preserved by it; for, on the day it should lose
this character, there would arise a new party that would make the
renounced program its own in more radical formulation.”
(Preussische Iahrbiicher, 1915, No. 4, p. 51.)

Here the question as to who split the workers’ movement is not
only clearly answered, but the reason is also adduced as to why Social-
Democracy, or, at least, its Executive Committee, its parliamentary
fraction, was in Germany “ tolerated ” by Hitler for a time, and in a
number of lands, is directly encouraged by the bourgeoisie. Fear of the
Communists, of proletarian revolution, forced Social-Democracy “ to
continue with socialism,” in order to be able to secure to the capitalists
the leadership of the proletariat.

This was the purpose of all the Second International’: united front
manoeuvres, which were, however, disavowed by a number of its
parties. The opposition of German Social-Democracy, of the Czech,
the Polish and other Social-Democrats to negotiations with the Com-
munist International furnishes proof that, as the international organ-
ization of the Social—Democratic Parties in the countries preparing for
war, the Second International is already incapable of further negoti-
atzons.

Bu-t so much the more urgent becomes the question of restoring the
united front of the working class against fascism, the oﬁensive of capital
and imperialist war, this question is coming more and more to the

[78]

  

  

 

 

front. We recall that Lenin, after the negotiations of the three then
existing Internationals in 1922, wrote: I

“ The representatives of the Second and Two—and-a—Ha1f Inter—
nationals need the united front, since they hope to weaken us through
excessive concessions on our part; they hope to be able to push their
way into our Communist house without any obligation; they hope to
convince the workers through the united front tactic of the tightness
of the reformist and the falseness of the revolutionary tactic. We
need the united front, because we hope to convince the workers of
the contrary . . . .

“In order to help these masses, to help them against capital, to
help them to grasp the “ artful mechanics ” of the two fronts in the
whole of international economics as well as in the whole of inter-
national politics, on this account we have adopted the united front
tactic, and will carry it through to the end.”

The two fronts in “international economics and politics ” are to-day
more clearly deﬁned than ever before. Therefore, any united front has
become insupportable to the Second International. We, however, will
have to unmask the “ artful mechanics ” of the two fronts so much the
more completely, and will have to form the united front of the working

. class in the struggle so much the more resolutely. -

This united front will deal the death blow to the International of th
social—chauvinists, of the social-fascists, which now already poisons the
air with its corpse-like stench, and will continue to poison it long after
its death.

EPILOGUE

Since this pamphlet was written, certain events have occurred in the
Second International that are worth recording in an epilogue. These
further events show that the Second International remains, for the
term of its life, the International of preparation for imperialist war, the
path—ﬁnder for fascism, and that what still holds it together is solely the
common endeavour to save capitalism at the expense of the working
class, in the first place at the expense of the Soviet Union.

In the meantime, the Social-Democratic Party of Germany has con-
tinued further on its way of capitulation to Hitler, and since its
prohibition by the Hitler government, which ensued despite its capitula-
tion, it has devised a new manoeuvre for its salvation. The Reichstag
fraction ‘of the Social-Democratic Party voted for Hitler on May 17
with the song Deutschland iiber Alle: on their lips. But even that
could in no respect change its fate.

Hitler .has——for all his “ anti-Marxist” phrases directed against Social-
Democracy——estima-ted the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, in
accordance with the nature of its ‘politics and in accordance with its
class composition, as one among many parties that represent the
interests of the German bourgeoisie, but whose peculiarity it is to have
itssocial foundation and its mass basis first and foremost in the working
class. He has also meted out corresponding. treatment to Social-
Democracy. He did not let himself be diverted from the fascist idea of
the " totalen staates ”* by the wheedling of the Social—Democratic Party

and trade union leaders, any more than he did by the national protesta-
tions of the Centre Party or of his own allies, the German Nationals.
The special treatment of Social-Democracy by the fascist government
(the clearing of the Social-Democratic functionaries out of the state
apparatus, and also the subsequent dissolution of the Social-Democratic
Party of Germany prior to /all other parties, the mass arrests of its
"leading cadres, etc.) is proper to the party of the left wing of the
capitalist class, whose class composition is predominantly proletarian
and which therefore conceals within itself special dangers for the
fascist dictatorship and its clique of leaders.

The tactics of the Social-Democratic leadership, which aspired to a
compromise with Hitler just as fruitlessly as the leaders of the Centre
Party, the Bavarian People’s Party or other bourgeois parties, have,
however, conjured up the danger that Social«-Democracy, regarded
from the standpoint of the non—fascist sections of the bourgeoisie,
would become superﬂuous. With the organizational self-dissolution

*Integral state: what is termed the “corporate state” by Italian

Fascism.

[80]

 

   

 

and splitting of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, broad masses
of the Social—Democratic workers threaten to come to Communism.

At the national conference of the Social-Democratic Party of Ger-
many, which was held on April 26 in G6ring’s Reichstag, the aspiration
to the “new orientation ” found its expression for the ﬁrst time . Whole
district-organizations (as in Wurtemburg) declared their self-dissolution,
in conection with which they called upon their members to support
the. national revolution; the leadership of the General Federation of
German Trade Unions declared in unmistakeable terms its breach with
Social-Democracy and its readiness voluntarily to subject itself to
assimilation; “ Gleichschaltung ” : Co-ordination. i.c., The exclusion of
Communists from all elected institutions and appointment of National-
Socialist Commissars to direct Trade Unions, employers organizations,
separate State Governments, etc., ‘Government Departments. Social-
Democratic trade union and co-operative functionaries and health
insurance officials went over en masse to the National—Socialist Party;
they instituted a grovelling job—hunt after provisional commissions in
the same organizations, whose affairs they had previously administered
as “elected " functionaries. The meaning of all this was nothing other
than the carrying of the tactics of the Executive Committee of the Social-
Democratic Party in regard to fascism to their logical conclusion.

These tactics and their continuation to their logical conclusion by
important representatives and organizations of the Social-Democratic
Party of Germany conjured up the danger of Social-Democracy being
unable -to represent the left wing any longer even in the bourgeois
camp; on the other hand, they also led to parts of its lower organizations
making themselves independent and allying themselves with Com-
munist organizations, and to many worker members going over to the
Communists.

At the national conference in Berlin the Executive Committee of the

/Party, under the leadership of iWels, carried through a double man-

oeuvre. In order to placate Hitler and Goring, the national conference
removed from the Executive Committee of the Party all jewish members
as well as all former “Independents,” who had mostly emigrated; to
the general membership the national conference made the concession of

‘ ﬁlling these oﬂices with ‘such leaders from the younger generation of

party bosses, as gave the appearance of being on the Left. After ‘long

debates, the conference adopted a resolution on the report of Wels, in
which it is stated: ‘

“ Unprincipled coat—turning rightly meets with universal contempt.

By steadfast adherence to its principles and utilization of the given

 

legal possi‘bilit_i_es for its activity, the Social-Democratic Party of»

Germany serves the nation, and socialism.”

[81 

   

Hitler’: answer was the sequestration of the entire property of the
Social—Democratic Party of Germany on May 9; the answer of a great
part of the mass membership was ﬂight from the Party, from the trade
unions and, in many cases, the beginning of illegal organizational
activity.

Supported by the head of the Second International, the new orienta-
tion then went full steam ahead for the salvation of Social-Democracy.
Abroad, fugitive Social-Democratic leaders began to write on the
subject that

“ fascism itself_ has liberated it (i.e., Social-Democracy) from
legality . . . now the only possibility still left to it is to defy the
fascist rule of force, without concern for its legality to hold together
in revolutionary forms the nucleus of the most devoted and most

V valiant, and to educate it, the revolutionary rising generation.”
(Vienna Arbeiterzeitung, May 11, I933).

The new tactical orientation—-of at least a part of the Social-Demo— _

cratic leadership——was supposed to be expressed in the slogan that the
constitutional path has been abandoned. It is not long since they
wished to persuade the workers that legality would kill the Hitler
regime, that abandonment of the constitutional path was a Communist
provocation. Behind this new orientation, however, there was always
the tactical consideration that Hugenburg, “ Hindenburg’s man,”
would overthrow Hitler, or at least force him back within legal limits.

The differences of opinion between the Executive Committee of the
Party and the majority of the Reichstag fraction, which came to light on
the occasion of the latter’s assent to Hitler’s Reichstag speech of May 17,
are, in the very first place, to  traced to the fact that the Executive

. Committee of the Party and a minoriy of the Reichstag fraction con-

sidered it impossible to continue the policy of the constitutional path
further and wished to set up an opposition, from Hugenburg to Wels,
against Hitler. The majority of the parliamentary fraction, however,
with Lobe at its head, wished the Party to adhere further to the con-
stitutional path, a fact that came to expression, after a compromise with
the constitutional majority and its leader, in Hitler being approached
once more. It is stated that twenty-seven members of the Reichstag
fraction declared in the session that in the event‘ of the fraction, under
“ orders from emigrés,” not giving its assent to ‘ Hitler’s Reichsta
speech, they would leave the Social—Democratic Party of Germany ang
go over to the Nazis.

On the vote of the Reichstag fraction of May 17 followed the
oﬂicial declaration of Wels concerning the removal of the headquarters
of the Executive Committee of the Party to Prague (actually, the

[321

  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 

"removal %had already taken place earlier), a declaration that was also
intended‘ to proclaim officially the abandonment of the constitutional
path. At the same time an official communication was issued -to the
eﬂect that Vo'ru/art: would reappear as a weekly in Czechoslovakia and
a new daily of the Social-Democratic emigration, Deutsche Frei/wit,
'- would be founded in Saarbriicken. To crown the “ new orientation,”
the withdrawal of Wels’ resignation from the Bureau of the Second
International was announced.

The ship of the Executive Committee of the German Social—Demo-
cratic Party, with at least a part of her crew, has therefore come safely
to port in Prague. This,led, however, to a falling apart of the leader-
ship of German Social-Democracy into two camps. One section of the
Social-Democratic leaders did not wish to recognize the new landing
place of Prague; under L6be’s leadership, it wished and wishes to
adhere to Potsdam, where the Social-Democratic Party of Germany,
unbroken, under the leadership of the whole executive committee, with
Wels at its head, would range the ship of Social—Democracy with
‘Hitler’s ﬂeet, The fraction in the Prussian diet has declared that it

rejects most uncompromisingly the removal of the headquarters of the
executive committee of the Party and that the headquarters of the
leadership remain in Germany until further notice; the Reichstag
fraction, likewise has not recognized the executive committee of the
Party in Prague.
‘ -~ The disintegration, however, has not yet reached ﬁnality with this
public disputation between two sections of the Social—Democratic leader-
" ship, any more than with the official prohibition of the Social-
{Democratic Party of Germany by the Hitler government, the annulment
of the mandates of all Social—Democratic parliamentary and municipal
fractions and the subjects of the reformist trade unions to complete
it assirnilations. - V , .
The “ struggle for the new orientation,” that called forth the cleavage
in the leadership, is still in its initial stage. The membership in
4 Germany and among the cmigrés has not yet by any means had its
l word. The last word in these disputations will, in any case, be spoken
V by those worker-members‘ of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany
and the reformist trade unions to whose destinies it makes no differ-
ence whatever whether they are betrayed from Potsdam, or from
Prague, by a clique of leaders whose baseness is only surpassed by its
political stupidity. What this “ revolutionariness ” of German Social-
Democracy and the Second International in regard to Hitler has
 unleashed, is disclosed by the article, already cited above, of the
« dummy old “ Left” Social-Democrat:

[83]

 

   

 

r

“ Every thing hinges on ‘who takes over the leadership and what 

this leadership is like. One senses that the struggle has begun.”

To contest the Communist Party of Germany’: leadership of the anti- I I

fascist struggle that it is organizing, to‘ contest its leadership in order
“ to turn into democratic paths” , the "revolutionary struggle against
bourgeois dictatorship in all forms, i.e., to sabotage it in the interest of
capitalism's‘ salvation——such is the purpose of the “ new orientation ”
of Social—Democracy in Germany. In this sense, Wels and the leaders
of the Second International have come together.

0 O I 8

This return of Wels -to the leaders of the Second International does
not hold up the Second In-ternational's process of dissolution, in the
least degree. Likewise it in no way alters the fact that, on the occasion
of the prolongation of the Berlin Agreement between Germany and

_the Soviet Union, all the Social-Democratic Parties got together for the

common purpose of incitement against the fatherland of all‘ toilets,
in order to affirm with the same unanimity the anti-Soviet Four Power
Pact, in the conclusion of which, besides the ex-labour leader,
MacDonald, and the near-socialist, Daladier, Hitler and Mussolini also
participated. A

The international conference of the Second International called for
August 21 in Paris" will ﬁnd it hard to hush up the antagonisms of
the different national Social-Democratic Parties. Each fresh step to
imperialist war signiﬁes a fresh step to its further dissolution, signi-
ﬁes an open avowal of its own bourgeoisie’s war aims, of its own
imperialism. I '

The time has already come when the putrefaction in the Second
International has advanced so farthat it can only maintain its existence
by playing the role of pathﬁnder to the unity of the imperialist powers
in the struggle against the Soviet Union. It is not yet, indeed, at the
end of this role; but it is already at the beginning of the end.

important munitions concern, the French Company of Schneider-
Creuzot. ’

The chairman of the Second International, Emile Vandervelde,
although striking a softer note, has nevertheless found again the old
attitude that he used towards German Social—Democracy during the time
of the World War. He reproaches his German colleagues for making
the song Dcutschland, Deutsclxland ﬁber alles once again the leading
principle of their policy.

The sister organization of the Second International, -the International
Federation of Trade Unions——also called the Amsterdam International—
which has just moved from Berlin to Paris, is also in process of dis-
integration. The German free trade unions* which have been all too
easily swallowed by fascism, no longer belong to any international
organization. On the proposal of the well-known chief physician of sick
capitalism, Tarnow, the Wood Workers’ Union has ofﬁcially severed its
relations with the wood workers’ international organisations. Other
trade unions«- are following suit. The reformist syndicalists in France
headed by Monsieur Iouhaux, already leave no doubt that they are as
little inclined to collaborate with the German trade unions as during the
past imperialist World War.

The disintegration of the Second International has commenced; it
proceeds; its collapse, however, is still to come.

The beginning of the and of the Second International follows almost
immediately on the peak of its good fortune. Less than two years ago,
at the time of the Vienna Congress of the Second International, Emile
‘Vandervelde chanted hymns to the blossoming of the International, to
its “ power.” He declared:

“ Notwithstanding the Communist split, the International represents
in 1931 a power incomparably greater in numbers -than in 1914. There
is hardly any of its great parties which has not in one form or another
participated in the government . . . Without exaggeration, it may
be stated that the majority of the members of the Executive of the
Socialist Labour International are former or future ministers. This is
without doubt a proof of increased power. . . .”

The power of a “ Socialist,” of a “ Labour International ” is measured
by the weight of the ministerial portfolios held by Labour leaders in
bourgeois cabinets! And the power of “ proletarian Internationalism ”
is measured by the extent to which the Social-Democratic Parties have
fused with their national bourgeoisies.

“ Increased power ”——but of which class? Naturally, Vandervelde did
not put this question. For this question, once put, must also be
