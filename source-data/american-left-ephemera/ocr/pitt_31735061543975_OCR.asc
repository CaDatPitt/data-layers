THE WEB O 

 

IN KOREA 

NOW! 

 

 

  

WI-IO ever heard of a war being
fought over exchanging prisoners oi
war?

That's what's stopping a truce in Korea right now.

More than 116,000 American casualties—-more prison-
ers—more deaths and destruction in Korea every day.

And no end in sight.

Why?

The Gallup Poll says 70 per cent of the American peo-
ple want to end the war in Korea.

But do the Republicans and Democrats-—who talk
"peace"——_propose to end that war NOW?

Eisenhower says:

''I do not have any prescription for bringing
the Korean War to a decisive end. . . 

Stevenson says:

"There is, of course, no tidy solution to the
Korean problem. . . 

No wonder the United Mine Workers Iournal
says that neither party has answered the top
question in the minds of the people—how to
bring the war to an end.

Progressive Party says:

"Stop the fighting now—talk afterwards . . .
Cease fire in Korea today, Without any ifs, ands,
or buts . . . an immediate armistice at the agreed
upon demarcation line; all disputed questions,
including the exchange of war prisoners, to be

‘ settled by. civilian representatives of all nations
involved in the War after the fighting is
over. . .

Why Don't They Make Peace?

The war in Korea makes proﬁts for the big shots who
ﬁnance both old parties. Proﬁts iumped from $27 billion
in 1949 to $39 billion in 1950. when the war broke out-
and to $43 billion in 1951. The big corporations got new
plants and tools from government tax money—YOUR
MONEY. But here's what the people got since the war
started: ‘

0 Highest prices in all history-—.food up 30%..
0 Highest taxes in history—taxes up 74%}
0 Wages frozen and al 10°/o cut in living standards."

. O Cuts in low cost housing. in hospitals, in schools.
and flood control.

' O A new attack on civil liberties and the rights of
‘ Negro Americans and other minority groups.

0 Increased draft of sons and young fathers.

If you want peace—make your vote count-
don't waste it on parties that proﬁt from war!
Make your vote count—Vote against candidates
who agree to keep war going! Let them know
they can't just talk “peace"—they HAVE TO
MAKE PEACE in Korea.

Vote for HALLINAN and BASS—the candidates
who stand for peace in Korea NOW.
