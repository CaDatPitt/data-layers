 

AND THE     

JERSEY ELECTIONS

McCarthy labels everyone and everything even faintly tavoring or
resembling Roosevelt's New Deal as "Communistic". McCarthyism is
based on the smear technique, character assassination, guilt by association,
unsupported charges and big newspaper headlines.

.McCarthyism would bind and gag the people, destroy their constitu-
tional rights, and make it impossible to work for peace, tor more democracy,
to: a better life. McCarthy advocates reaction at home, and atomic war
abroad. McCarthyism, a product of reaction in both old parties, is
tascism—-American style. ‘

documents or micro-films are missing, and that any films now in Europe

l were ldgally released as part of lend lease during World» War II. But
sensational charges, completely unsupported by any evidence, continue,

to pour forth from the McCarthy committee.

It this helps New Jersey voters torget Troasfs letter pleading for

A clemency for extortionist and labor racketeer Joe Fay, McCarthy will have

performed a far greater service for Big Business Republican reaction than

’ 100 speeches could have done.

Troast and McCarthyism

McCarthy inﬂuenced the selection of
Troast as Republican candidate over
former Congr-essman Case. McCarthy
threatened to campaign against Case, a
liberal Republican, it he insisted on run-
ning in the primaries. Troast, however,
meets with McCarthy's full approval,
And why not? ~

Hundreds of decent people, and scores
of organizations in New Jersey have
denounced the witch hunting McCarthy.
But Troast has never uttered one word ot
criticism of this despot. And he won't.
As a mattervof fact, Troast, the Big Busi-

 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority, thinks
exactly like his friend McCarthy.

Troast the Witch Hunter

Troast is very vague and; indefinite about how to increase state aid
to schools to remedy the disgraceful situation of under paid teachers,
overcrowded school rooms, dilapidated school buildings, etc. But he is
very clear in his demand for a permanent witch hunting committee‘ in
New Jersey—to terrorize and intimidate school teachers, and to ban
school books offensive to the McCarthyite mentality. I

Troast "stands on the record" of the Republican administration. This
record includes the firing of. Rutgers professors (for using rights granted
to all Americans under the Constitution) despite support of the students
and faculty. This includes upholding the rank discrimination against
Dr. Létt, a Negro, who was by-passed as head of the Division Against
Discrimination, in order to win Atlantic City Boss I-‘arley's support for

Troast. Troast is a candidate whom McCarthy can gladly support.

The defeat of this reactionary Troast will
be a rebuke to the war-like Eisenhower
administration, and to McCarthy and his
inquisition‘ against the democratic liber-
""’ ties of the American people.

Such a defeat will also greatly enhance the prospects of electing a group
of New Jersey Congressmen (in the '54 elections) more responsive to th
needs of the people. i

The Key to Victory

So far few candidates have recognized and spoken out against the
menace of McCarthyism in our state. Meyner, the Democratic candidate,
has not done so. This emphasizes the fact that the Democratic Party cannot
be depended on to lead the ﬁght in the people's interest. Labor candidates

V have not been vocal even though large sections of the labor movement

recognize McCarthy as poison. Some AFL leaders are even supporting
McCarthy's man Troast against the interest of their own rank and file.

It is still not too late however. The workers and people of New Jersey
have been engaged in all kinds of struggles in the recent period: on
rent control, strikes for wage increases, for low cost housing and slum
clearance, for new schools, etc. The people, by getting into this fight,
by pressure on the candidates, and by their votes on election day can
make" sure that McCarthyism is defeated at the polls on November 3rd.

Candidate {or State Assembly
lth line on the Ballot

CHARLES NUSSER

Essex County Communist Party

Candidate for State Assembly
3C on the ballot

Voters i-n Essex and Mercer counties will be able to cast the most
militant kind ot vote against McCarthyism and everything it stands for.
They can do this, and at the same time vote in favor at world peace
through peaceful negotiations between the big powers by voting tor the
Communist Assembly candidates-—Charles Nusser in Essex and Bert
Salwen in Mercer county.

A vote for the Communist candidates is the best way of protesting
against crime and corruption, against witch hunts and repressive laws,
for schools instead of atom bombs. You need not be a Communist, or
agree with the whole Communist program, to vote for either of the two
Communist candidates. The most effective protest vote, the best way
to express your indignation about high prices, high taxes and Big Business
government is by voting for Charles Nusser in Essex and Bert Salwen in
Mercer county. Twelve Assemblymen are being elected in Essex County
and three in Mercer. So you don't have to worry about wasting your vote
by voting for the Communist candidate.

Elect Labor - Negro — Liberal Candidates

The election of labor, Negro and liberal candidates, regardless of party, i

will serve notice on both old parties that the people are stirring, and
cannot be taken for granted. It will express the people's desire for
greater democracy, and for government more responsive to the people's
needs. And it will help ‘set the stage for a people's coalition to elect
more progressive congressmen in the 1954 elections.

DEFEAT THE POLITICIANS-

VOTE “YE,S" IN NOVEMBER

Why do so many people and organizations -

support the movement for at new fonn of govern-
ment for Newark? They do so because of dis-
gust and discontent with the costly, inefficient,
undemocratic city commission form of govern-
ment.

The people are sick and tired of city hall
graft and corruption, oi police brutality, of
growing slums, delapidated schools and high
taxes. They want a more democratic form of
government. One responsive to the needs oi
the people.

In November we have an opportunity to get
rid of the discredited city commission set-up
-by voting "YES" on the charter ‘referendum.
But the politicians——led by Keenan, Bontempo

‘and Ellenstein———are fighting to prevent you

from getting more democratic government in
Newark, and to save their cushy jobs and
political power.

The plan proposed by the Charter Study
Commission is not a magic cure-all that will
solve all problems. It does not contain every-
thing that we would like to see. The people
will still have to tight for decent housing, dem-
ocratic rights, lower taxes, better schools, etc.

But the Mayor-Council form—with five

' councilmen elected from wards—is a big ad-

vance over the present set-up. It is more dem-
ocratic. It will enhance the possibilities of all
groups getting representation—including our
75,000. Negro citizens, who have never had
representation on the city's governing body.

The slimy red-baiting of a Keenan should
fool nobody. This is the same Keenan whose
cops rode down a strikers picket line. This is

    

CHARLES NUSSER

the same Keenan who imposed a curfew in the
third ward. The same Keenan whose police
invaded a Negro church during services. Re-
member, Keenan isn't fighting for what's good
for Newark. He's fighting for what's good for
Keenan. BUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR KEENAN
IS NO GOOD FOR NEWARK!

Politicians like Keenan have been feeding
at the public trough for many years. They act
like little dictators who think the people are
ignorant dupes. In spite of the Keenan's YES,
because of the Keenans, we must continue the
fight to make Newark a decent city to live in—'—-
a city that we all can be proud to call "our"
city-——-no matter where we are. We can begin

this job by piling up an overwhelming "YES"

vote in November—-a vote that will bury the

rotten commission government forever.

As a resident of Newark and as the Com-
munist Party’s candidate for State Assembly I
urge every citizen to get into this fight to stop
the greedy politicians from ruining the city
even more than they have already done.

The enemies of good government are now
out in the open. They and their political hang-
ers-on and machine hacks will be working
night and day. But if all the groups and in-
dividuals supporting better government get to
work we can snow them under. We should
take nothing for granted. Between now and
election day_ everything possible should be
done to get out the maximum "YES" vote. The
people can lick the reactionary politicians. The
people can win this fight. .

FOR A MORE DEMOCRATIC NEWARK

VOTE IN NOVEMBER!
