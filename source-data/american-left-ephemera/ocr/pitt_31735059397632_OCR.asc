ed the apartment of 20-year-old

Ruth and 23-year-old Sgt. David ‘A
Greenglass in Albuquerque, N.M. .

He produced a torn half of a Jello

box matching one that they had

intheir possession. Gold had first
visited Dr. Klaus (“Julius”) Fuchs
at Santa“ Fe. He introduced him-
self to the Greenglasses with the
passwords: “I come from Julius,”
and asked for certain written in-
formation pertaining to a secret
lens mold used in the manufacture
of the atom bomb. David Green-
glass produced the
material, handed it over to Gold
and received $500.

, In‘ February, 1950—three months
the papers announced
Gold’s arrest, and a few daysafter
Fuchs’ arrest in London—FBI
agents had come to the Green-
glass apartment in New York to
question David about his duties
and activities at Los Alamos. Ruth
was present. The FBI made no
move to arrest Greenglass at that

, time.

_ Four months later, on June 15,.

Green-glass was home preparing
formula for their new child. Their

_three-year-old child was there,

too. Ruth Greenglass had badly
burned herself a few‘days earlier
and- was in a hospital for treat-

ment-. There was a knock on the A

door. The young father answered
it. Four FBI agents. walked in.
They told him he was under arrest
on charges of committing espion-

7» age for the Soviets during the war.

ptrhe FBI agents stayed in

‘ ‘Greenglass’ apartment for
V 10 .

5%  hours,...nntil own. that

night They questioned   
and made .a thorough: search; 

of the apartment. In going:
through a trunk of old let-

 and papers, one of the“

agents picked out a sheaf of

’ mathematical notes, brought .

them over to Greenglass and
said: A
“What’s this, some of your
atom bomb secrets ?_” A
“No,” Greenglass replied.
"‘That’s just some of my

brother-in-law's math notes v

‘ from college.”

This —- according to the
government testimony at the
trial—is how Julius Rosen-
berg’-»s name ﬁrst came into‘
the case. I I

THE HIDDEN $4,000: David
Greenglass. was taken to FBI
headquarters and questioned un-
til the early hours of the next
morning. Finally he was allowed
to telephone another brother-in-
law, Louis Abel, to whom he had
previously given $4,000 to hold

for him. Greenglass asked Abel-

to retain 0. John Rogge, one-time
Asst.'U. S. Attorney General under

Tom Clark. - ‘

-Later that morning, Abel went
to they Rogge law firm. and turned

over the $4,000. Rogge appeared"

at the arraignment that after-
noon, protested his client’s inno-
cence and asked for lowered bail.

In‘ opposing Rogge’s demands, U.S..

Attorney ‘Irving Saypol demanded

that Greenglass be held in $100,000 1

bail and had him placed in «soli-
tary conﬁnement. _-
That same day the ‘FBI paid its
first visit _ to Julius Rosenberg,
whose college notes of 12 years
earlier had been found in the
Greenglass apartment. The FBI
men said they wanted to talk to
Julius about his brother-in-law,
D_avid Greenglass. Julius accom-
panied them to the Federal Bldg.
in Foley Square, and for about
three hours they asked him ques-
tions about David, pressing’ him
for speciﬁc dates about David’s
visits to New York on furlough

‘ during the War.

Through them, Julius learned

I that_David hadbeen arrested the

day before and had, they said,
confessed to stealing atomic se-
crets for the Soviet Union. Then,
after they had been asking him

’questions about David for three

hours, one of the FBI men said.
“Dave said you told him to sup-
ply information for Russia.”

Rosenberg asked to be allowed.»

to confront Greenglass to hear
these “foolish accusations” from
his own lips. The FBI agents
ignored his request. Rosenberg
then demanded and got permis-

sion to consult a» lawyer. He »tele- ‘

phoned his union’s law ﬁrm. They
asked whether he was under ar-
rest. When Rosenberg said no,
they told him to “put on your hat
and walk out,” which he did.

“SOMEBODY M 0 R E IMPOR-
'l‘ANT:” The same day, other FBI

- agents went to the hospital to

question Ruth Greenglass. No

11

testimony on this interview was
ever introduced. (The government
put no FBI agents on the witness
stand—an indication that they
might. have proven extremely vul-
nerable to defense questions deal-
ing with the interrogations and
f‘confessions” made by certain key
witnesses.) But when Ruth Green-
glass left the hospital two days

‘later she had an immediate con- ‘

sultation in her home with at-
torney Rogge. She said that her
husband had had dealings with
Gold, that -it was she who had
deposited the $500, and that she

had been present the previous

February throughout an F'BI'in-

‘terview with her husband. She

said: i
“I thought the FBI was leading to
somebody other than my husband,
that they wanted‘ somebody much
more im ortant than he”

Rogge then "outlined the differ.-
ent courses that could be taken.”

On July 6 in New Mexico, a
federal grand jury handed down a
four-count espionage indictment
against David Greenglass. The
charges against him, ' based on
sworn information given to the
grand jury by nine persons, in-
cluding four FBI agents, were that
“on about June 3, 1945, in’ Albu-
querque” 'David Greenglass had:

(1) Met and conferred with Harry

Gold; (2) Received $500 from Gold;

(3) Prepared a sketch of a “high ex-

plosive lens mold”; (4) Prepared a

"statement concerning the Los Alamos

project.

The grand jury charged that
Greenglass had delivered these
atomic secrets to Gold and to
Anatoli Yakovlev “for transmis-
sion to the .U.S.S.R.” For convic-
tion on any one of these overt
acts David Greenglass faced the
death penalty.

“THE GENERAL SITUATION”:

The day following the indictment
the federal commissioner in New
York‘ ordered Greenglass’ immedi-

ate removal to New Mexico; but

Rogge asked for a week’s delay.
A week later, on July 13, Rogge
secured another postponement.
U. S. ‘Attorney Saypol approved
the delay. He explained:

“I do not feel It appropriate to

' Julius

state publicly the substance of dis-

cussions which have been going on,

but I acquiesce in ‘this application

for adjournment!”

In its account of these proceed-
ings, the N.Y. Daily Mirror re-
ported: _

_1‘he court appearance followed the
‘latest of at series of ‘conferences be-
tween Rogge and Saypol. noggesaid

,.12

he“ haspbeen talking with both his
;'¢5lient ‘ma Saypol and would like to
have "several more talks with my
client here ‘before removal proceed-
ings are held.” His talks with the
accused spy, he said, have been about
"the general situation.”

SAYPOL conmms: In mid-
July,. Ruth Greenglass, after her
ﬁrst interrogation by the FBI ‘on

June 16 and her initial consulta-
tion with Rogge, met with Saypol,.

members of his staff, FBI agents
and her husband for three days‘
in a row. The conference had been
arranged by Rogge. These con-
ferences with Ruth Greenglass
culminated with her signing a
statement in which she implicated
the Rosenbergs.

On July 17 the FBI placed

with an announcement, issued
jointly from Washington by J.
Edgar Hoover and J . Howard Mc-
Grath, charging him with having
recruited his brother-in-law,
David Greenglass, into a Russian
spy ring “early in 1945.”

FREE ON A “HUNCH”':
one month, what started with an
FBI agent’s chance question about
Julius Rosenberg’s college _math
notes had been shaped up to pro-
vide a political sensation. In police
parlance the “atomic plot” in-
volved was a “closed case” before
Rosenberg was brought into it. All
the accused» participants had con-
fessed. The chief one, Dr. Klaus
Emil Julius Fuchs, British—em-
ployed «German scientist stationed
at Los Alamos project during the
war, was already serving time in
England“ (and still works for. th

British government).

Rosenberg _under arrest,

Thus, in’

His , Emotive‘, Fuchs said. was
misdirected idealism. Three of his
four alleged accomplices in Ameri-
ca had no political idealism, only

.a' cash motive; the fourth Harry

Gold, was an anti-left-wing ad-
venturer.  -

Thus the government was de-
prived of a political culprit in the
plot; and the case was on the
point of ‘being quietly and unsan-
sationally concluded when Julius
Rosenberg was suddenly brought
into it. For, in arresting Rosen-

, berg”. the government was able to

stress the fact that in,1945 he was
discharged from government em-

ploy» on ‘charges that he" was 0.
member of the Communist Party.

Ruth Greenglass’ hunch—that
the “government” was seeking
“somebody much more important"
than the Greeng1asses—proved
right.

Today, as the Rosenbergs sit in

. the Death House at Sing Sing pri-

son, parted from their two chil-
dren, their accuser, Ruth Green-
glass, a self-labeled spy, is free
with her two children. Her hus-
band, David, saved from trial for
his life in New Mexico, will be free
in eight years, with good behavior.

"EVIDENCE" AND HOW IT GREW

arrest, the government still" had

of the young progressive couple.

N spite 'of the red-scare head--

for FBI purposes. One, an_elec-

Elitcher,_ had failed to report
Communist Party membership in
applying for a government job,
had eventually quit the job for
fear this would be disclosed, and
could still be prosecuted for per-

jury—meaning a possible ﬁve—year-

sentence and ruin. The other, who

ber of the Young Communist
League. ‘ . r

The FBI ﬁrst interviewed E1-
itcher on July 20, three days after
Julius Rosenberg’s_ sensationally
publicized arrest. He was told. they
had information he was involved

‘in espionage. After several hours’

questioning he asked to go home

and consult his wife. The FBI

went with him. Mrs. Elitcher- was
at home with her two children,
a four—year-old and a new baby.
Within 12 hours Elitcher had
signed .a statement implicating
Julius Rosenberg. He then made
a beeline for the law office of 0.
John Rogge who was already rep-
resenting the Greenglasses.
. The statement Elitcher signed
for the FBI said that on. two

‘ visits to his home in Washington

during 1 the war Roserfberg had

, asked him’ to spy for the U.S.S.R.

but that he hadnever done so.

KIDNAPING PARTY: On Aug. 3
prosecutor Irving Saypol got a
sealed warrant for the arrest of

Sobell. ‘It charged him with ﬁve

“overt acts,” all of which were
identical: having “had conversa-

ten armed men broke into the
Sobell apartment in Mexico City,
blackjacked him, dumped him in-
to one car of 'a ﬁve-car caravan
and drove three days and nights
until they reached the U. S. bor-
der. There, waiting FBI agents
arrested Sobell and took him to
New York where he was arraigned
Aug, 25 and held in $100,000 bail.

There was still no case against
Sobell,.except that the Sobells and

the Rosenbergs had visited each '

other __ from time to time and
Sobell had “ﬂed”

was up to anything more incrimi-
nnating than a vacation. The
known facts: his home in Queens

rented, their Mexico City apart-
ment, in their own names in an
apparently normal way.)

FUEL FOR. THE BONFIRE: But
there, too, Sobell’s classmate and
neighbor Elitcher came in handy

for the FBI. Although in his ﬁrst ‘

two statements (July 20 and A21)
Elitcher did not mention Sobell,
he ﬁnally’ signed a third state-

‘ment in October, according to his

own testimony, which quoted
Rosenberg as saying: “Sobell is
alsoin this.” - ~

_ _(Sobe_1l was indicted on Oct. 10,

fense, in the; belief that’ thejury
would reject the unsupported tes-
timony of Elitcher in the face of
no government allegations of

the Rosenbergs,' has been ap-
pealed.) _ " *
Whether or not the government,
in kidnaping and arresting Sobell,
had any genuine expectation of
convicting him, hauling him in

bonﬁre being built up around,the_

Rosenbergs. , _ .

MRS. ROSENBERG ARRESTED:
“Prior to Sobe_ll’s“ kidnaping and
arrest, Ethel Rosenberg had been
‘twice called __befor;_e‘,_‘ the federal
grand jury. Questioned ‘mainly

"about her and her husband's,

political beliefs, * she refused ‘an-

swers on constitutional grounds.

and on Aug.‘11, as she left the
grand jury room, she too was
placed under arrest. ‘
On Aug. 17, the dayibefore So-
.be1l’s arrest on the Mexican bor-
der, the ﬁrst indictment in the
case was handed down. It charged
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg with
having conspired to transmit
atomic ‘secrets to the Soviet Union.

. sular official . accused as recipient

KNOW-HOW AT WORK: The
Times noted that the indictment
listed eleven “overt acts,!’ among
them‘ charges that on ' Nov. 15,
1944, the Rosenbergs conferred
with Ruth Greenglass and five
days after gave her $500 to go
to New Mexico to visit her hus-
band. Another charged Rosen-
berg with visiting Mrs. Green-

glass in _N. Y. on Dec. 10, 1944, and -

ijeceivinginformation from her.

turned, naming David Greenglass

The third and ﬁnal indictment
was returnedcon Jan. 31, 1951, a.
few days before the trial was
scheduled to get=under way. This
indictment (as noted again in the
Times) _

. . . extends the conspiracy to June

6, 1944. . . . One overt act has been

added. . . . It charges Rosenberg with

visiting 247 Delaware Av., Washing-
ton [Elltcher’s apartment], on June

4, 1944.

HOW IT GREW: This chronology,
when co-related with U. S. Atty.
Saypol’s statements and with the

testimony given in the courtroom,

makes it apparent that:
0 On July 17, Julius Rosen-

‘berg’s arrest wasywarranted on no

other basis than oral allegations
about‘ him made to the federal

Morton Sobell on Aug. 18 were
warranted by nothing except his
suspected political beliefs and his
being “over the border” when the
FBI sought him out—-as they did
every one of Rosenberg’s CCNY
classmates and acquaintances.

0 Sobell’s indictment on Oct.,10
was based on his involvement by
Max Elitcher, Sobell’s former col-
lege room—mate and next-door
neighbor, under threat of prose-.
cution for perjury.

o The ﬁnal indictment, on Jan.

_ 31, 1951, contains the first indica-

authorities by “his in-laws, Ruth‘

and David Greenglass.

0 The arrest of Ethel Rosenberg
on Aug. 11, and the indictment
of Ethel and Julius on Aug. 17,
were based entirely on the same
oral unsupported allegations.

A’ Julius Rosenberg took the wit-

ness stand. «During the eight

. months the American public had

been bombarded with a well-nigh

tion of any incriminating allega-
tions given to federal authorities
about Julius Rosenberg by Elit-
cher.

JUSTICE: Thus the case against
the Rosenbergs, which orought
death sentences for them, was
built entirely by the Greenglasses

.—-both self-1abele'd spies—and by
Elitcher, whose testimony saved

after .he was  arrested on c

' (‘ceaseless propaganda barrage de-.
n jgsigned‘ to convince them of the
certain guilt of‘ the 33-year-old

him from a 5-year perjury rap
and professional ruin.

f THE nosmnnsncs mus ma sumo

The Greenglasses’ portrayal had
Rosenberg being furnished by the
Russians with unlimited ﬁnancial
resources to recruit other spies; to
establish contacts with scientists
in government agencies and key

defense plants; to spend $50-'75 J
every_ night for entertaining; to ,

subsidize the college. education of

‘likely espionage prospects; and to

V his 35-year-old 

16

furnish his confederates
large sums of money to ﬂee this

with at 

country and ﬁnd eventual haven

_ “behind the Iron Curtain.”

As a token of their apprecia-
tion for his service, “the Rus-
sians,” according to the Green-
glasses, had given Rosenberg a
citation which entitled him to
special privileges; watches for
himself and his wife; and a con-
sole table containing a hidden
compartment for microﬁlming se-
cret documents. ,

Notwithstanding the intrigue,
mystery, excitement, drama and
real-life whodunit qualities of the
government’s portrayal of Rosen-

berg, there was just one factor .

missing: not a shred of ‘t could
be supported by even a scintilla
of evidence. Nor was any evidence
offered even to try to support it.

*If these headline-seeking alle-
gations about Julius Rosenberg
were indeed factual, it would
seem that the government surely
could have produced some evi-
dence or testimony that:

. 0 He was known to other mem-

" bers of the A—bomb spy ring.

'0 He had “important contacts"
in defense -plants and government
agencies.

0 He was a big spender in night
clubs and restaurants. '

0 He consorted with Russian
nationals.

0 He had subsidized students’
college education.

THE “RUSSIAN” TABLE:
government’s avoidance of any
attempt to prove its headline aile-
gations was almost too crude. The
console table, which ostensibly
contained a secret‘ compartment,

was not even produced; in court

‘one allegedly supplied

(although an apparently normal
table was impounded by the gov-
ernment when the Rosenbergs
were arrested); instead, a photo-
graph of a table was introduced
in evidence that was “like” the
“by ' the
Russians.” (The Rosenbergs said
they bought theirs at a Macy's
sale for $21.)

Significantly, none of these
headline allegations was included
in the indictment on which the

Rosenbergs were brought to trial,

The 12 “overt acts" charge that,
as part of a. conspiracy to trans-
mit A—bomb and other secret in-
formation to the U. S. S. R.:

(1) In June, 1944, Julius visited
the home of a classmate, Max Elit-
cher, in Washington, D. C.

(2) On Nov. 15, 1944, Julius and
Ethel “conferred with” Ruth Green-
glass. '

(3) On Nov. 20, 1944, Julius gave
Ruth Greenglass a sum of money (J.
Edgar Hoovers announcement said it
was $500; in court It became $150.)

(4) On Nov. 20, 1944, Ruth Green-
glass boarded a train for New Mexico.

(5) On Dec. 10, 1944, Julius visited
the Greenglass apartment at 266
Stanton St., N. Y. C.

(6) On Dec. 10, 1944, Julius. re-«V

ceived from Ruth Greenglass a piece
of paper containing written in-
formation. .

(7) on Jan. 5, 1945, Julius and

Ethel “conferred with” the Green- 7

glasses. 5 , _

(8) On Jan. 5, 1945, Julius gave
Ruth Greenglass a torn half of a
jello box. 5

(9) On Jan. 10, 1945,’ Julius intro-
duced David Greenglass to a man on
First Avenue, N. Y. C. - '
 (10) On Jan. 1_2, 1945, Julius "con-
ferred with” David Greenglass.

(11) on Jan. 12, 1945, Julius re-

ceived from David Greenglass a paper.

~ containing sketches, _of experiments
conducted at the Los Aumos project.

(12).O'nJan. 14, 1.94.5, David Green-

glass boarded a train ‘for New Mexico.

Of these 12 “overt acts,” Rosen-
berg, when he took the stand,
denied four as outright "false-
hoods; He said he never gave
Ruth Greenglass any sum :of
money, and never received any
written information from her or
any sketches from David Green-
glass. He denied giving Ruth a
torn half of a. jello box or in-
troducing David to “a man” on
First Ave. This man, according to
Greenglass’ testimony, was “a
Russian,” whose name, dress and

/description Greenglass was un-

able to recall when pressed to do
so by Rosenberg’s attorney,_ Em-
anuel Bloch. _ ” “ .

Rosenberg did not challenge the

other “overt acts” listed in the

indictment; he did, however,

challenge and deny on oath the

import_of these acts as alleged
by the uncorroborated testimony
of witnesses whose accusations

against the Rosenbergs saved
their own hides. .. V

meeting in Elitcher’s home in
Washington in June, 1944, the
only testimony purporting to cor-
roborate the Greenglass’ por-’

spy who toured the country re-

. cruiting espionage prospects, de-

ﬁes credulity as it was described

by Elitcher.

Rosenberg proceeded to “recruit"

would turn it over. (Elitcher said

into two former classmates, Mor-

swimming pool. (Elitcher hadn’t
recalled; a this encounter.) Four
years later, Rosenberg testiﬁed, he
was sent to Washington on a
Signal Corps assignment. After
being. in the city for three days,
he became lonely and attempted
to look up Sobell and Elitcher. He
said Sobell’s name was not listed
in the Washington telephone di-
rectory, » bu_t Elitcher’s was.

‘ Rosenberg testiﬁed that, after
he had been at the Elitchers’ home
for a short time,»Mrs. Elitcher did
leave the room. But, instead of
being sent out by him so that he,
could make spy overtures to her
husband (as Elitcher claimed),
she left the two men alone for a
mission as prosaic as washing the
supper dishes. He saw Elitcher a.

, year and a half later in Washing-

ton, and a third time in New York
in 1946. He denied categorically
any “spy.” talk with Elitcher on
any of these ‘occasions; their en-
counters were no more than get-

the “overt acts” as sinister im-
plementations of a spy plot did-
indeed take place, Rosenberg
testiﬁed. But, instead of the. in-
triguing conversations that the
Greenglasses ascribed to the meet-
ings, Rosenberg said that one of
them was at a family gathering
when David ﬁrst returned to New
York on an army furlough; an-
other occurred at his mother-in-
law’s, when he saw and talked
to Ruth Greenglass after her re-
turn from a five-day visit to her
husband in Nov: 1944; and the

third was at the Rosenbergs"

apartment, where the Green-
glasses had been invited to dinner
(similar invitations had been
extended to David and Ruth by
all the relatives who attended the
family dinner welcoming the army
sergeant home for_ furlough).

At these meetings, Rosenberg‘

testified, he discussed nothing
more sinister than their children,
work, the progress of the war, and
politics, in W h i c h Rosenberg

voiced the opinion that the Soviet -

Union was still bearing the
“heaviest load” of repelling the
German Army, and that a second
front should have been opened
sooner. _
What gives the clearest‘ hint
that the Rosenbergs are victims
of a political frame-up is that the
12 “overt acts” listed in the in-
dictment all occur during the six-
month period preceding Julius’
dismissal from his Signal Corps
job on charges that he was a Com-

munist Party member——a j_period - A

_FOREdWORD  

wH§EN the death sentence was passed on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg

on April 15, 1951, for alleged atomic -espionage for the Soviet
Union, the American people were shocked and disturbed. There was
widespread feeling that the ‘unprecedented death sentence was savage.
Never before in our history had a civil court imposed a death sentence
for espionage, either in peace or war time.

The Rosenbergs have;  lassertedptheir inno;c_ence;. 

‘_ stated» they are being victsiznized’_,,by;,i_the‘"_prosecution; for their ‘avowed
political and social views, and 'have~¥sai-d’, “Wepareyvictimsaofithe grossest.

Most of the press assurned ‘justice had been done in the case.
'I’he,1'e_were some exceptions, particularly the Jewish press, Vvhich ex-

pressed amazement. at the cruelty of the death sentence.

But a full report of the case was not made available to the public‘

until August, 1951, when the National Gurdian began to publish a series
of articles by William A. Reuben. His revelations have conﬁrmed the
fears of many who had doubted the guilt of the Rosenbergs and ‘con-
vinced many others who had not -followed the case originally. As a
result of. this series, the National_ Committee to Secure Justice in the

Rosenberg Case was formed. As one of its first acts, the -Committee is -

NATIONAL COMMITTEE ‘TO SECURE ,

JUSTICE , IN THE ROSENBERG CASE

Ethel Rosenberg, when she fol-
lowed her husband on the stand,
also denied categorically the
Greenglasses’ accusations purport-
ing to link her to the espionage
plot as Julius’ assistant and moral
supporter. The Greenglasses_ ac-

cused Ethel of typing up A-bomb

notes which allegedly were given
to Julius by David ;_ writing, letters
to the Greenglasses when they
were living in Albuquerque, N. M.
(and allegedly giving them in-
structions for meeting a courier);
and being present at several of

the meetings which the Rosen-

bergs insisted were family or

- social gatherings. No letters, notes

or any other corroboration ‘of

‘ nothing more

Ethel Rosenberg testiﬂed that
she did own a portable typewriter;
that she earned her living as 9.
typist before her marriage; that
she corresponded with ti. 2 Green-
glasses for her mother, “who

doesn't write English very well";

that she did some volunteer typ-
ing for the ladies auxiliary of her
husband’s union, Federation of
Architects, Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians, CIO, and, during
the war, for the Office of Civilian
Defense. Apart from thet typing
activities, she admitted to typing
“incriminating"
than her husband's denial of the
government's allegations in sever-
ing his employment on the charge

these accusations were produced. ,he was a Communist. ,

"A ma AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL"?

V HEN TESTIMONY had been

completed in the trial last
March, and just before the sum-
mation ‘and the judge’s_ charge,

. attorney Alexander Bloch address-

ed Judge Irving Kaufman with
the following motion:

“I move for a mistrial upon the
ground that the frequent questioning
by the Court . . . of witnesses, espe-
cially the defendants, had a ten-
dency of unduly inﬂuencing the jury
to the prejudice of the defendants
and depriving them of their con-
stitutional right to a fair and impar-
tial trial.”

Judge Kaufman indignantly

“ brushed the motion aside and

challenged the defense’s sincerity

W.‘
V

A se1ection~of‘eicamples of what '
, 2a

the defense motion referred to
follow. The reader should judge
them while remembering that the
case against the Rosenbergs as
presented in the “overt acts” was
clearly not sufficient to win a
conviction unless the couple could
be indelibly smeared before the
jury as Communists and “Russia
Firsters.”

THE FACT THAT "‘WASN’T:
When the Government called its
ﬁrst witness, Max Elitcher, Judge
Kaufman interrupted the prose-
cutor’s direct examination of the
witness to address the jury as
follows: . l
“I; »want you to understand right
atathe outset that THE FACT 'ruA;r
THEY [the defendants] WERE MEM-

only

mans or THE COMMUNIST PARTY.

{emphasis ours] does not establish
the elements necessary to prove them
guilty of the crime charged in this
indictment, which is conspiracy to
commit espionage. However I am
admitting this testlmonyk on the
theory of motive, but the Govern-
ment will have to establish that
there is some connection between
Communism and committing the of-
fense charged in the indictment.”

There hadlbeen no evidence up

 to this point that .the Rosenbergs

were Communists, yet the judge
referred to this as a “fact.” The
“fact” then in existence
-bearing on-this point was Julius
Rosenberg’s denial of Communist
affiliations in seeking to regain
his Signal Corps ‘job in 1945.

H Thus,'Judge Kaufman, in the

apparent act of counseling the
jury on how to judge the evidence,
committed the ﬁrst act of im-
planting the defendants’ “Com-
munism” in the jury’s minds.

ON THE HONOR OF BENTLEY:
Later, when the Government
brought Elizabeth Bentley to the
stand to offer her now-familiar
testimony that all Communists are
spies for Moscow, the judge point-
ed out to the jury that this hasti-
mony was what he had referred
to in his foregoingx statement
about the connection between
Communism and espionage.

THE COURT: “I assume that this
is the causal connection that we
have ‘ been talking about between
membership in the party and in-
tending to give an advantage to a
‘foreign government, to wit, the
U. S. S. R. as charged in the indict-
merit.”

The judge then explained the
import of Bentley.’s testimony to
the jury, in a way which amount-

\

.21

ed to little more than his earlier
comment spelled ‘backwards:
THE ‘COURT: "The purpose for
‘which this testimony was taken . . .
is to show a link, as the Government
contends, exists between aiding Rus-
sia . . . and being members oflthe

Communist’ Party. . ~. .”

When it became the defense’s
turn, Judge Kaufman was openly
antagonistic. At the beginning of
his cross examination of the gov-
ernment’s ﬁrst witness,_ Atty. E. H.
Bloch sought to question Elitcher
about the circumstances that he,
a government witness, was repre-
sented by the same lawyer, 0.
John Rogge, as vtwo defendants in
the indictment, David ‘and Ruth
Greenglass. Prosecutor Irving Say-
pol objected. s

SAYPOL: “Will your-lhonor let me
state on ‘the record my objections?
I think the cross-examination is
taking a turn which is wholly un-
fair to the prosecution. First there
is an implication that the U. S.
Government recommends lawyers and
witnesses to defendants.-’.’ V
THE COURT (sustaining the ob-

1

jection): “Well, you had better be.

prepared, Mr. Saypol, for many, many
more implications by the defense in
this trial. . ”

Auhasic defense contention'was
that the Greenglasses,‘ to save
their own necks, had implicated
the Rosenbergs under FBI urging
because of animosities which had
grown up between the couples in
1949-50 over business differences.

Greenglass admitted the iiffer- ,

ences but insisted he and Rosen-
berg had remained “good friends.”

Q. (by E. H. Bloch): “Did you ever.

come to blows with Julius?”

A. (by David Greengiass): "No. I

didn’t.”

Q: “Do you remember an incident \

when you were sitting in the corner
candy store at Houston St. and AV. 1)

 

when your brother Bernie had to
separate the both of you?” '
y: “it slipped my‘ mind.”
THE COURT: “Subsequent to that,
A-had you patched things up?”
A: “Certainly. We were very friend-
ly after that.”

The Greenglasses’ testimony, in
an effort to connect family gath-
erings with the Rosenbergs to the
alleged spy plot, freely tossed off
names of guests etc. as persons
connected with Julius in espionage
activity. (None of these persons
was called as a witness or named
in any indictment.) One such per-
son, a neighbor of the Rosen-
bergs, was allegedlyﬁrst pointed
out to -Greenglass by Rosenberg
as a person who would contact
him in New Mexico for informa-
tion. Later’ they met socially but
Greenglass could testify to no
discussion of espionage matters.

{Rosenberg testiﬁed that the W0-
man and her husband had been
merely dinner guests at a home-
coming for David Greenglass.

Attorney Bloch questioned Rosen-

bergabout the dinner party: V

Q: “Did you ever have any dis-
cussion with Ann Sidorovich or her
husband at any time with respect to
getting any information relating to
the national defense of this coun-
try?” .

A_: “I did not.” *

THE COURT: “Did youever dis-
cuss with Ann Sidorovich the respec-
tive preferences of economic systems
between Russia and the U. S.?”

Rosenberg replied that “in my
normal social intercourse with my

friends we discussed matters like

that.” Atty. Bloch, to offset the
implications of the judge’s inter-
ruption, elicited from Rosenberg
the statement that he would fight
for this country in a war with
any other country. Again Kauf-
man interrupted: '
THE COURT: “Do you approve the
communistic system-of Russia over

the capitalistic system of this
country?”

lowing prejudicial court tactics

played no favorites:

Q: “Did you ever hear or any such
thing as a Jello box being cut in two

tion of any emissary or agent to be
sent by your husband out West in
order to get information from the
Los Alamos Project?”

A: 4‘Outside of this courtroom, I
never heard of any such thing.” 4

THE COURT: “Incidentally, did you
have any Jello boxes in your apart-
ment?”

‘Saypol’s badgering was hardly
less tendentious than Hi-s Honor’s.

Thus, in cross-examining Julius‘

Rosenberg: .

Q:._ “Did you ever make anyxcon_- 

tribution ‘to the Joint Anti-Fascist
Refugee Committee?”
 . A: “Yes, I believe I did.”

SAYPOL (turning to the jurors)-.

“That is known to ‘be an organiza-
tion deemed subversive by the ﬁt-

torney General.” 7 ~

*To the host of questions tossed
at him by the prosecutor in cross-
examination about his political
aﬁiliations, Rosenberg refused to
answer, claiming privilege under
the 5th Amendment. This is what
happened when attorney Bloch
objected to this entire line of
questioning:

BLOCH: . . . This type of ques-
tion goes to collateral matter. The
charge here is espionage.”

THE COURT: “. . . I_ wouldn't en-
tertain this if I believed it was col-

lateral. . . . I believe that in view

(I

ernment has laid that it is rele-

vant.” i V
For Ethel Rosenberg, whose
cross’-examination by the prosecu-

tor consisted almost entirely in‘

attacking her exercise of privilege

in refusing to answer questions

before the grand jury before she
was indicted, here is one of the
questions which enabled Saypol
and Judge Kaufman to send this
mother of two small children -to
the singsing death house:
Q: “A little while ago you said you
did everything to help Davey, do you
remember that?"
A: "Yes‘.” ' _
Q: “Did you help him join the

ly, when the prosecution produced

Judge Kaufman playfully ad-
monished the U. S. Attorney not
to try to be a Milton Berle and the
jury chuckled respectfully. There-

after, their sport exhausted, both
judge and prosecutor sought spir-
itual guidance ’ as they took pains

“Your crime is worse than murder.

V  _ff. ',.gln the_.light of the circum-

‘ stances, I ‘feel that I must pass such

diabolical conspiracy . to destroy a

.'*"

- God-fearing nation, which will dem-
onstrate with ﬁnality that this na-
tion's security,’ must remain invl_o-
late. ; . ."

. This was the rationalization for

mpositiorr by a civil court—for
the first" time in this . country’s
history, either in peace or war-—
of the death sentence on a charge
of espionage;

REFLECTING HYSTERIA: Cali-

ing the sentence “unjust,” The .

Sentinel, American-Jewish na-
tional magazine in Chicago, said
Kaufman “was carried away to
an extent by the hysteria which
has overtaken our country.” The
Jewish Daily F..rwar-;, which ac-

cepted without challenge the
judge’s statements as to the
Rosenbergs’ guilt, nevertheless

found the sentence “too horrible”
and “too cruel.” It probably spoke
for the whole Jewish community

of America when it added that

“every Jew feels the same way”:

i but ‘it is now apparent that a far

?.4

vaster segment of. America ﬁndsf

the sentence too cruel and hor-

wrible, J _ -

s But even assuming that the
Rosenbergs did participate in such
a plot, the judge’s statement justi-

.fying the death sentence falls

apart factually when viewed
against the historical facts; and
the sentence itself becomes not

only cruel and horrible but ridicu-

lous and illegal to boot.

A STUDY IN CONTRASTS: or
the 12 “overt acts” charged
against the Rosenbergs, the first
occurred in June, 1944; the last
in Jan. 1945. The savagery of the

. sentence, if it. may in any con-

ceivable way be justiﬁed, can be
understood only in terms of the

‘political climate six years after

the commission of the “crime.”
Death for the crime the Rosen-

- bergs «allegedly committed is ‘un-

thinkable had they been brought
to trial at the time it allegedly
was committed, when the U.S.S.R.
was a war ally. But even for aid-
ing an enemy in World War II,

no individual was ‘sentenced to
V death.

In the wartime spy case known
as U. S. vs. Molzahn, four men
who gave vital aircraft secrets to
Germany in the fall of 1941 were

. let off with 5- to 15-year senten-

ces. “Axis Sally” and “Tokyo Rose”
-.—against each of whom was pre-

sented a mountain of evidence

showing they had actively worked
for an enemy in wartime, and
against each of whom was abso-

lutely proven treason, the greatest
crime chargeable against a citizen_

in relation _to his own ‘govern-
ment-—were each -sentenced to ten
years’ imprisonment. (With time

off for good behavior, both will

be free before the Rosenberg!
appeals can be exhausted.) *

Even in those cases where oth-
ers had been convicted as “al-
leged spies for the Soviet Union,
the maximum penalty _(only one
case) meted out _by, U.S., British
and Canadian courts has been 3]!
years, the minimum sentence six
months.

JUDGE vs. COMMISSION: Fur-
ther grounds for questioning the
imposition of the death sentences

were forthcoming from govern-'

ment itse_lf—the Joint House-Sen_-

. ate_ Committee on Atomic Energy.

Its 222-page report published last
April, after the Rosenbergs had

been sentenced to death, "demol-

ishes every, point made‘ by "the

gard to the death" penalty. _

The "comm_iss_io‘nfs report, ‘eh-h

1n.1945 of scientists most closely
associated with atomic ’develop-
ment, such as «Harold C. Urey,
.»,_ Oppenheimer, Huxley in England
and others who pleaded with the
public and the Allied governments
to understand that there existed
no basic atomic secrets. They
Warned then that atom bombs
could be built by any nation, that
the only protection against atom-
ic war was international outlaw-
ing of atomic ‘weapons and
destruction of stockpiles.

Authoritative scientiﬁc publica-
tions also have repeated thisgsame

point of view. An editorial in the

September, 1949 issueof Atomics,
.a_ monthly periodical dedicated
to the\ presentation of scientiﬁc
facts about all phases of atomic
energy, offers one typical state-
ment of the many hundreds that
could be quoted. The editorial,
prompted by President Truman's
announcement, in 1949 that f the
Soviets had exploded an atom
bomb, declared:

T‘. . . It should not be start-
ling since it is only what every
— reputable scientist, knowing the
principles of nuclear physics, has
been predicting ever since we dropped

it was not until July 16, 1945, when

VERDICT BY PASSION: Before
the Rosenberg trial‘ the govern-
ment told the’ public it would
produce as witnesses such top
nuclear physicists as Oppenheimer
and Urey, and wartime A—bomb
project chief Lieut. Gen. Leslie

Groves. None of them came to‘

testify. Was it because they might
have admitted that no “atomic
secret” ever existed at all?
Information possessed by the
Atomic Energy Commissionwould

seemingly bear this out. Last De-—

cember,-in the opening paragraph
of as news story datelined Wash-
ington, D.C., the "International

Victims of a cold war Sacco-Vanzettiicaset?

MUST THEY DIE?

. By William A. Reuben

ON March 6, 1951, in a federal
courtroom at Foley Square in

A New York City, this nation’s ﬁrst
V ‘atom-bomb spy trial began, when
in- -

the clerk-of—court solemnly
toned: V
~“The United States of America
versus Julius Rosenberg, Ethel
Rosenberg and Morton Sobell.”

U. S. Atty. Irving Saypol an-
nounced that the government was
ready. ,

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were
defended by Emanuel H. Bloch
‘and his father, Alexander Bloch;
Sobell was represented by Edward

M. Kuntz and Harold M. Phillips.

Nearly 300 talesmen were ques-
tioned before a jury of 12 plus
four alternates could be seated. It
is singular that in a city more
than 30% Jewish in population,

not a single talesman of Jewish‘

extraction survived the day and
a half of questioning before a jury
was seated.

TRIAL BY PRESS: The govern-
ment announced it would call 118
witnesses. Among them were to ‘be
top nuclear physicists Dr. J. Rob-
ert Oppenheimer and Dr. Harold
C. Urey and Lieut. Gen. Leslie
Groves, head of the War-time
atomic bomb project. 45 ~ _

to me that the federal courts have

now attempting, as in our case, to

passed on us is part of the atomic
hysteria designed to brutalize the

minds of the people _in order to make.

‘it easier for them to acqept as a

commonplace thing long prison terms ‘

and even death sentences for political
prisoners. . ‘. .

In mid-May, Julius was also‘

‘sent to. the" Death House and
wrote this letter to Ethel after

their first visit there.

* FAIR-MINDED people can suffer their government to take the lives
of citizens’ "only on the most direct and incontrovertible evidence.
The whole world now knows that Nicola Sacco and"Bart0.1omeo Vanzettl
were innocent "of the crime for which the Commonwealth of Massa-
chusetts put them to death in 19.27, that they were framed on a holdup
and murder charge because of their radical ‘activities in the postwar
hysteria of World War I. « -. ' 4- ‘

The facts of the arrest, trial, conviction and sentencing of Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg indicate that, at the very least, there is grave
doubt of their complicity in any alleged atom—spy conspiracy what-
soever; and at the very worst, thatthey too, have been convicted on
trumped—up e1ridence———Ifbt so much, to, silence their own,'two small
voices of political’ protest but rather to implant in the public mind
with‘ savage emphasis the ‘belief that all holders of radical views are
a menace to the nation, and to silence through mortal fear, all who

may dare to_ hold views at variance with those of the administration

of our country. ‘ ‘ A i «

It was precisely for such a purpose as this that Herman Goering
caused the Reichstag,.to be set aﬁre in Nazi Germany in 1933, blaming
it on the Communists. Of this now well—exposed plot, the noted British
lawyer D. N. Pritt wrote:

Far more important for the «German government than that the guilty
< incendiary should explate his crime was the securing or a legal pronouncement
in favor of the alleged complicity of their most feared and hated political
opponents, the Communist Party of Germany. . . . ,
The terror, the persecution and attempted political and economic annihila-
tion of the Jews, the working class movement, and the progressive thinkers of
Germany, thus received some shadow of apparent legal justification.

The Hearst press, gleeful over the death sentences meted out to
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, did not miss the implications of the case
for progressive thinkers of America. “The importance of the trial can-

not be minimized,” said the N. Y. Journal-American. “Its ﬁndings .

disclosed in shuddering detail the Red ‘cancer in the American body

“Undeﬁnable _tenseness pervad-
ed the courtroom,”. wrote Meyer
Berger in the ,N.Y. Times. “The
silence was extraordinary” as the
trial got under way. To press and
public, the question seemed to be
not the guilt or innocence of the
defendants; but whether or not
they would be given the death
penalty.

(Judge Kaufman himself, dur-
ing questioning of one talesman,
said it was for him alone to de-
cide whether to impose death or a
lesser penalty. The judge caught
himself only after defense at-
torney Emanuel. Bloch pointed out
the jury's verdict might be for
acquittal, making it unnecessary
for the judge to impose any sen-
tence at all.)

When the jury had been seated,
U. S. Atty. Saypol opened in
hushed tones, reading from a pre-
pared statement. He described the
defendants as “traitorous Ameri-
cans” whose ‘‘love of communism
and the Soviet Union” led them
to deliver to "the Russians

“. . . the one weapon that might well
hold the key to the survival oi! this
nation and the peace of the_«;»world—-
the atom bomb.”

». Saypol promised to show/that
the loyalty and allegiance of the
Rosenbergs and their co-defend-
ant Morton Sobell was not to
America but to _
“. . . communism in this country
and communism throughout the
world, under the [dictatorship of the
Soviet Union. . . . I do not consider
it necessary in this opening state-
ment to deal extensively on the plot
that will be unfolded before you. . . .

nesses who» were ‘there, who saw and

and did over a period of years to
commit this crime."

CASE DEFLATES: Eight and a
halt court days later, the govern-
ment rested its case (which it
had announced beforehand would
take three months to present). Of
the 118 government ' witnesses
originally announced, only 20 were
produced. Oppenheimer, Urey and
Groves were never called. Of the
20: '

0 Eight (including six imported
from Mexico) testiﬁed as to de-
tails of the Sobell family’s trip to
Mexico, without , in any way im-
plicating either Sobell or the
Rosenbergs in the crime charged
against them. ,

,0 Two army colonels testiﬁed
to security measures at the Los
Alamos project during the war.
' 0 A physicist employed as a
liaison-man by the Atomic Energy
Commission explained a sketch
David Greenglass drew in court
concerning some of the compo-
nents of, the atom bomb. r

0 Rosenberg’s family ‘doctor
testiﬁed that Rosenberg had asked
in behalf of a friend about in-
oculations necessary to enter
Mexico.

0 Ruth Greenglass’ brother-in-
law, Louis Abel, testiﬁed to hiding
$4,000 for David Greenglass and
turning it over to his attorney,
0. John Rogge, after Greenglass'

arrest.

0 Ruth’s sister (Mrs. Abel)
testified that Julius Rosenberg
had once asked her to leave the

' room during a visit to her sister.

_ of One witness identiﬁed, a pho-

1

tograph of Soviet consular aide
Anatoli Yakovlev, named in the
indictment as a defendant four

..\years "after he returned to the

U. S. S. R. in Dec., 1946.

ENTER MISS" BENTLEY: Of the
remaining five witnesses, two were
self—styled one time spy couriers—-
Elizabeth Bentley and Harry Gold.
Neither had ever known or seen’
or been involved in any way with
any of the defendants.

Gold gave lurid and sureﬁre
headline-creating testimony about
how the spy ring operated. Miss
Bentley, who now earns her live-
lihood as ‘a paid government wit-
ness, said that membership in the
Communist Party made it “im-
plicit” to carry out orders from
Moscow and that it . -

‘.‘. . . only served the interests of

Moscow, whether it be propaganda,

or espionage or sabotage. ’f

These two introduced a myste-

V rious “Julius,” unknown to either

of them, whose name recurred in
telephone? conversations and in a
password used in the spy plot.

NECK—SAVERS FILL THE BILL:
The remaining three witnesses
were Max Elitcher and the Green-
- glasses. Despite the prosecution’s
promises . of 118 witnesses and
overwhelming evidence‘ to corrob-
orate the case against the Rosen-
bergs, only these three offered any
A testimony purporting to incrimi-_‘

nate them. The Greenglass’ charg-‘

es against Julius and Ethel Rosen-
berg, in-laws with whom they
were on the outs, won David
Greenglass a merciful 15-year
sentence (eight years with good

behavior) instead of a possible

I

death sentence in New Mexico,

where he had been indicted but ,_

never brought to trial; and won‘
Ruth Greenglass complete free-
dom. Max Elitcher’s “cooperation"
with the FBI provided the gov-
ernment’s entire ‘case against
Morton Sobell ‘as well as “corrob-
orating evidence” against Julius
Rosenberg; and allowed Elitcher,
an electrical engineer and former
classmate of both So-bell and

Rosenberg at the City College of .

New York, to escape a. perjury
charge hanging» over his head that
cou‘ld have sent him to jail for

_ﬁve'years and ruined him‘ profes-

sionally and economically -for life.

To backstop the self-saving
testimony of these three, the gov-
ernment produced two exhibits
purporting to incriminate the
Rosenbergs: (1). ‘a Spanish Refu-
gee Appeal collection can found
in the Rosenberg apartment; and
(2) a nominating petition signed
in 1941 by Ethel Rosenberg for
Peter Cacchione, successful Com-

, munist candidate for New York

City Council (50,000 New Yorkers
signed this petition). These" were
the only government exhibits
which were directly linked to the
Rosenbergs. Yet, this is the “evi-
dence” which U. S. Attorney Say-
pol had assured the jury

“. v. . will prove to you, not only be-
yond a reasonable doubt, but beyond

any doubt, that . . . these defendant?‘

have committed . the most serious
crime which can be
against the people of this country.”
Because of the flimsiness of the
government’s case, the absence of

any convincing proofs, documen- ‘

tary or. circumstantial, the im-
peachabilityof the three witnesses

committed ‘

on whom its case was based, the

_ host of peculiarities surrounding

the arrest and the build-up of
charges against Ethel and Julius

. Rosenberg, it must be asked: Does

“the most serious crime” which
has landed them in the Death
House at Sing Sing prison have to
do with committing espionage——or
with harboring radical ideas?

Tl-IE JURY NEVER «New ‘mas .. .
‘ .HE most damning feature of the testimony of both Gold

A and Elizabeth Bentley——and, indeed, perhaps. the most

incriminating aspect of the governments entire case-—was
the introduction by them of a mysterious “Julius.” A
Gold testified that, in establishing contact with Green-
glass in New Mexico, when he paid him $500 after receiving
information pertaining to atom bomb experiments going on

at the secret Los Alamos -Project, where Greenglass Was‘

-i stationed during the War, the code words he used were:
“I come» from Julius.” Gold had in fact come from visiting
Dr. Klaus Emil Julius Fuchs in'Santa Fe. , ‘

Miss. Bentley said that during 1942 and 1943 she re-
ceived several telephone calls from a man whose voice she
could not describe and whose identity she did not know, ex-
cept that he was “someone who called himself Julius.”

The government presented this evidence in the obvious
expectation, which proved correct, that the jury would de-
cide that this mysterious “Julius” was Julius Rosenberg.

But a startling fact, not introduced by the defense at
the trial because it was not known to them, was contained

‘ in the New York Times of February 4, 1950. In reporting

the arrest of the arch-conspirator of the “spy plot,” Dr. A
__r_ Klaus Emil Julius Fuchs, the Times made this statement a

full year before the .“Julius” evidence was presented by the
government in asking death for Julius Rosenberg:

, - “Dr. Fuchsywho is charged in London with unlaw-
_ fully disclosing atomic secrets, was known to his friends

1

 hereias -‘Julius.’ ”

 “DAv£v's’iN mounts" 

UNTIL they found themselves
under arrest. in the summer
of 1950,. charged with atomic spy-

ing, the story of the life of Ethel

and, Julius Rosenberg was prob-
ably very» like that of thousands
of’young New York couples.

A few months after his gradu-
ation from C.C.N.Y. in 1939, Julius
married Ethel Greenglass, a gov_-
‘ernmentsecretary who had stud-
ied piano and’ voice. Ethel had’ a

0

job as a clerk—typist with the,

Census Bureau in Washington
and the couple went there to live

for a short. time. But Julius soon

got a job as junior engineer with
the U.S. Signal Corps in New York,
and Ethel quit her Washington
job to join him. They were very
deeply in love.

After living with in-laws and
in furnished rooms for /a time,
they found an apartment in
Knickerbocker Village housing
project in, 1942. As soon as they
were settled they had their first
baby——a boy, now aged 8. '9

J ulius. lost track of his CCNY
friends for the most part. He ran
into two of them, Morton Sobell

and Max Elitcher, at a swimming

pool in Washington,‘ D.C., when he
was assigned to the Bureau of
Standards in 1940. In 1944, on 3.
Signal Corps assignment, he visit-
ed Elitcher again but couldn't
locate Sobell this time. In 1945 he

losthis Signal Corps job on charg- '

es of Communist Party affiliation
(which he denied, but to no

effect); He then went to Washing-0 ‘

ton again to see his Congressman
to try’ and get a clearance; he
again visited the Elitchers, rode
around Washington with them
trying to locate the Congressman
and some union people, then went
home.

When Julius lost his Signal
Corps. job he landed one with
Emerson Radio at $77 ‘a week, but

overtime provided a hike _in pay—

over the government job. He was
laid oﬂ toward the end ‘of 1945.
Thereupon he and one of Ethe1’s
brothers went into ‘the -surplus
business with another fellow.
When Ethel’s other btother, David
Greenglass, got out of the Army
in 1946, they took him into the
partnership and changed the
name to the G. 8; R. Engineering
Co. In. '47 they reorganized the
ﬁrm, took a $15,000 investor, David
Schein, and became. ‘the Pitt
Machine Products Co. Inc.

David Greenglass, the “baby”
of the family, was a special favor-
ite of his sister, Ethel. David’s
wife, Ruth, was friendly with the

Rosenbergs too. When. the couples _
got together, they talked about A
the, war among other things, .
Julius being a staunch. advocate .
of a second front. When David V

went off to an army camp, Ethel

wrote the family letters to him"
couldn’t ,

for their mother, who
write English well.

DAVID IN,'1‘ROUBI’.E:‘. one day-

in 1945, while David was stationed
in New Mexico, Ruth called Julius
and asked him to visit her where
’ she was living with her sister. She
whispered to Julius’ to get her
sister to leave the room, then told
him she was worried about David.
He ‘had some idea of stealing
something from the Army and
selling it, she said. Julius told her
to advise David to steer clear or

.- that sort of thing and to stay out

of trouble. Julius thought at the
time it was some sort or black-
market. business, and told A Ethel
about it when hegot home. "

When David came back from

service the two men_ never dis‘-

cussed this aﬂair;’ Julius didn’t

know’ whether Ruth had told
David about telling him of it. By

 

 

I V DAVD GREENéLs
‘ Sawing his own -skin?

 

then, of course, Julius knew that
David had been assigned to the
atomic project in Los Alamos as a.
machinist, but did not connect the
two circumstances. As. partners in
the business,‘ the personal rela-
tions of David and Julius wors-
ened with its declining fortunes.
The upshot was that in 1949 David
pulled out as a partner and Julius
agreed to pay him $1,000 after

some other obligations of the ’

ﬁrm had been met.

From then on they were scarce-
ly on speaking terms; .the $1,000
went unpaid; David _ and Ruth
kept trying to collect. it, bl‘111;.-T..111_iI_,1,.8
didn’t have it.,;(Finally the Green-
glasses instructed their lawyer to
bring suit for the money.) Once
David even aimed ‘a punch at
Julius. After that the couples

avoided one another except at

family gatherings.

But then, in the middle of May,
1950, David came to the Pitt Ma-
chine Shop and told Julius he had
to talk to him privately. The two
men went across the street to
Hamilton Fish Park. There in a.
very excited and agitated condi-
-tion, David asked Julius for $2,000.
Julius told David he didn’t have
that kind of money and had no
way of getting it. He pointed out
further that he owed David only
$1,000. David then asked Julius to
try to get him a certiﬁcate for a
small-pox vaccination and to ﬁnd
out the type of injections needed
to enter Mexico. Julius wondered
it David was in some kind of
trouble, but David refused to’ dis-
cuss his ‘reasons for needing th

money or the certiﬁcate. ‘

vi .

“HELP DAVEY”:‘ During the tank

David had become very_ agitated

and that night Julius told, Ethel
about the incident. Both or them
recalled the conversation in 1945

with Ruth Greenglass about David
having ideas of. stealing some
things from the Army. They both
remembered also David having
mentioned casually that in Feb-
ruary, shortly after Dr. Klaus
Fuchs was arrested on spying
charges, he (David) had been
questioned by FBI agents. The

‘J Rosenbergs suspected that David
was in trouble of some sort,‘ but
‘they thought it probably had to

, “do with stealing gasoline or per-
haps uranium from Los ”Alamos.

Mainly because oi.’ Ethel’s say-
ing‘, “Julie, we ought to try to help

’ jDavey,” Juliuson his regular trip

to the doctor’s for hay-fevershots
a few nights later asked his doctor
if» it was possible to give a certiﬁ-
cate ot having had shots to some-
one who never had them. The
doctor saidthat would'be impos-

sible, and a few days later Julius
went to the Greeng1asses' apart-
ment and told David what the
doctor said. David told Julius to

forget it, that he would take care '
