YOU may not believe it, but it’s true, and it happened in a Federal
courtroom in Los Angeles. ’

JUDGE WILLIAM C. MATHES: . . . if she is to be a martyr, she
should be a martyr in the best sense of the word, not one of these pres-
ent-day martyrs who want all the glory and is unwilling to stand the
pain, but a martyr of old who is willing to take the glory and the pain
with it.

DEFENSE ATTY. BEN MARGOLIS: I f your Honor please, I had
hoped that we were living in an era where martyrdom was not required
of people. I was hoping that was the situation.

JUDGE MATHES: Some people choose to be martyrs.
MR. MARGOLIS: And I had hoped particularly, your Honor, in an

American court that would not be required of any defendant.

That dialogueoccurred on- Friday, June 27, 1952. Since then, Judge
Mathes assumed the role of inquisitor, dedicated to inﬂicting the pain
and punishment upon Oleta O’Connor Yates that would make her meas-
ure up to his standards of good old-fashioned martyrdom.

Following his sadistic purpose, he made a mockery of judicial
process. Every time a higher court ordered her release from jail, he dug
up a new gimmick to throw her back in- Each time, in his frustrated
anger at the higher court, he heaped new prison terms upon Mrs. Yates.

Sounds incredible? Yet, it is true. Here is the record.

Mrs. Yates,_prominent public ﬁgure in San Francisco, was one of 14
California Communists arrested, tried and convicted under the Smith
Act for their political beliefs and advocacy.

Jailed for her beliefs in 1951, she had been honored for some of
them in 1944 by appointment to the Mayor’s Committee on Civic Unity
and membership on the executive board of the San Francisco Council-
for Civic Unity in 1945. At least 40,000 San Franciscans thought enough
of her advocacy to vote for her when she campaigned for election to the
Board of "Supervisors in 1943 and 1947.

When Mrs. Yates and her colleagues were arrested a year and a half
ago Judge Mathes insisted that no less than $50,000 bail would guarantee
their appearance for trial. He kept them in’ jail four and a half months,
until he was forced to pry these people loose by one U.S. Supreme Court
decision and two U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rulings.

Bail was ﬁnally set by higher courts at $10,000 and $5,000, and all
defendants appeared for trial and stuck with it for six months.

0 Judge Mathes was proven wrong by life, and thrice overruled by
higher courts, but after it was all over he boasted that he still is “un-
reconstructed.”

During the trial, Mrs. Yates was the one defendant who took the
witness stand in herown behalf. For 14 days on the stand she testiﬁed
fully and frankly about her life, her activities, her political beliefs—the
supposed issues in this strange trial of what people think and say.

On cross-examination, the prosecution quickly gave up trying to
shake her testimony. The prosecution abandoned the issues, and sought
names. She was asked to put the ﬁnger on alleged Communists. This she
refused to do.

With great calm and dignity. she said in open court: “I am will-
ing to state anything you want to know about me and what I have
done and what I think and what my intent is. but I am not willing to
do anything that is going to open up the door to persecution and
harassment of other people. I think that would be becoming a gov-
ernment, informer and I cannot do that.”

Even Judge Mathes did not dare challenge her motives or her in-
te rity in open court. He said: “The witness does not want to be an
in ormer. The iury -undoubtedly understands what it is to be put
under the obligation to inform on others. They may feel that they

would do the same thing. They may admire a witness who does not

inform.”

For the first four loaded questions she refused to answer, Judge
Mathes cited her on four counts of civil ‘contempt and ordered her
jailed immediately.

The ﬁnal six long weeks of trial, she spent in the Los Angeles county
jail, serving time for this alleged civil contempt.

glam».-.'...s,.... .. a

She was asked 11 more informer questions, and Judge Mathes cited
her for criminal contempt each time, reserving sentence until conclusion
of the trial.

The trial ended August 7. In an atmosphere of hysteria and intimi-
dation, the jury found the defendants guilty, after 6 days of deliberation.
Mrs. Yates and her colleagues were each sentenced to the very maximu
alloyed by the law——ﬁve years in prison, and $10,000 ﬁne. ‘

On top of the ﬁve years, Judge Mathes sentenced Mrs. Yates to a'

total of FOUR MORE YEARS for refusing to become an informer,‘ a
total NINE-YEAR SENTENCE. And he ordered all defendants im-

prisoned immediately, denying their petition for bail pending appeal.
Then began the tragedy of the revolving jail door for Mrs. Yates.

Once again the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Mathes,
and directed the defendants to be released on $20,000 bail. No sooner
had Mrs. Yates left the " jail than Judge Mathes cut short his vacation,
and rushed back all- the way from Texas to throw her back in.

THREE TIMES Mrs. Yates was released by the Circuit Court of
Appeals, and THREE TIMES Judge Mathes found a new “gimmick”
to throw’ her back in, ina shocking example of vindictiveness. Finally,
the Circuit Court of Appeals ordered her released on her own recogni-
zance, without setting any additional bail.

This is punishment. cruel and unusual. In similar instances of
alleged contempt at Smith Act trials in New York and Baltimore.
defendants were sentenced to 30 days in iail. Judge Mathes decrees
four years in prison for the same offense!

Is Judge Mathes wreaking vengeance upon Mrs. Yates because

a higher courts frustrated his design to put her in jail and keep her there?

Is Judge Mathes punishing her because she dared to appeal, and
petition for bail? '

Has Mrs. Yates incurred the wrath of Judge Mathes because she de- '

fended her beliefs and upheld her honor with courage, dignity and in-

‘ telligence from the witness stand.

This is judicial tyranny, ignoring the higher courts, defying the
Constitution, guided only by spleen, spite and vindictive malice.

This is not a miscarriage of justice. It is a violent abortion. And if
a district court can do this to Mrs. Yates, are other citizens, are

YOU, safe ?

This is not an issue of “communism.” It has even gone beyond the

A Smith Act, original source of the prosecution. When courts begin to try

books and ideas, as prescribed by the Smith Act, they wind up by
crucifying people. And that is what has happened to Mrs. Yates.

The issue is judicial tyranny, the right of a court to impose cruel
and unusualpunishment out of personal vindictiveness, or as penalty for
daring to appeal the court’s decision to the higher tribunals.

Such things don’t just happen. They have their roots and causes.
No doubt, Judge Mathes could ﬁnd both inspiration and precedent in
the notorious injustice meted out to the Negro people and Mexican-
Americans in his home state of Texas, and elsewhere.

No "doubt the hysteria generated by “loyalty” oaths, Un-American
Committee witchhunts, the Taft-Hartley Law, the Smith Act and other
repressive legislation may give a judge the feeling that anything goes.

No doubt the innoculation of propaganda intended to infect the
American people with war fever helps create a situation where the last
shreds of civil rights can be stripped from an American citizen.

But can you afford to let thisil‘sort.of thing go on?

The appeal against these savage and unprecedented sentences is
now going to the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and will be heard
early in 1953.

The Justice Department, tainted by corruption and shaken by
scandals, has been a party to this shameful persecution. During the 1952
presidential elections, in order to draw attention away from its own
corruption, it drew a “red herring” across its trail by starting new Smith
Act prosecutions all over the country, prosecuting people solely for their
political beliefs, while gangsters and graftersv and lynchers go free.

It should be called to account. It should be told that it cannot
trample upon the liberties of the people.

THOUGHT-CONTROL LEADS TO FASCISM! YOU CAN STOP IT!

Tell the Justice Department:
Stop this persecution of Oleta O’Connor Yates!
Drop these monstrous contempt charges against her!
Halt these Smith Act prosecutions!

While the appeal is before the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, you
can’ help this ﬁght to defend the Bill of Rights by writing your protest
to the Attorney-General, Justice Department, Washington, D. C., and
to the U. S. Attorney, Federal Building, Los Angeles, Calif.!

Take this up in your union, fraternal organization, civic club, etc.,
and urge them to adopt a protest resolution against this un-American
persecution !
