all Street cannot today
operate in the old way, solely with
Big Stick and jingoism, or entirely
with Hitlerian racism. While inten-
sifying its use of these methods, it
must cultivate illusions of “demo-
cratic” America as liberator, as big
brother to the other capitalist na-
tions, even while undermining their
sovereignty, and as protector of the
colonial peoples, even while attempt-
ing to rivet their chains.

Among the most vocal counsellors
of this policy of colossal deception are
labor reformists, Social-Democrats,
and Titoites. At the cited New York
Herald Tribune Forum, Walter
Reuther, President of the United
Auto Workers, addressed himself to

Wall Street and its apologists show
a growing awareness of the diﬁiculties
encountered by this process of decep-
tion. At that New York Herald Tri-
bune Forum, the president of Cow-
les Magazines, Inc. warned the
American imperialists against com-
placency as regards Asia, with this
account of his own wartime experi-
ence with a group of university stu-
dents in China:

I referred to the United States, Eng-
land, France, Holland, etc., as “de-
mocracies” in whom they should put
their faith. A hostile stir went through
the group. Finally, a young Chinese
professor asked me how I could possibly
refer to England and France and H01-
land as “democracies” when in fact, so
far as Asia is concerned, they were im-
perial empires treating most of the
Orient as a colonial possession.

And the publisher solemnly added:

THE PERVERSION OF SCIENCE
TO MILITARIZATION

Wall Street’s cultural anti-human-
ism is nowhere so monstrously dis-
played as in the ﬁeld of science.

What is happening in science
within the United States today can
be comprehended only in the light
of the calculated drive to mobilize
every aspect of science for war, for
destruction, not for life.

Military expenditures for scientiﬁc
research and development jumped
from $22,000,000 in 1940 to more
than $:t,roo,ooo,ooo following Wall
Street’s military aggression in Korea.
These ﬁgures do not include the
stupendous military expenditures on
the atom bomb. At least two-thirds of
the scientists and engineers are now

‘ United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and
Cultural Organization.

was frankly proclaimed by Dr. Eric
A. Walker, Executive Secretary of the
Research and Development Board
of the Department of Defense, in a

 speech to the American Association

for the Advancement of Science,
December 30, 1950:

The size of the military research and
development effort is not only startling
but sobering. We are confronted by
the fact that the greatest portion of the
creative thinking and effort of the na-

tion’s scientists and engineers, is, of
' necessity, being concentrated on weap-
ons, devices, and techniques of warfare
and countermeasures.

This appalling state of aﬁairs
compels recognition of the fact that
capitalism, having made war its way
of life, can foster—indeed, tolerate—
only that sort of science which is
chained to the war machine. The
destructive implications for science
are not exhausted in the fact of its
bondage to militarization. Militariza-
tion means an essential debasement
and perversion of science. It means
also a progressive demoralization and
degeneration of scientists. This point
is effectively made by Dr. Theodore
Rosebury of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, Columbia University,
who made the most exhaustive re-
search survey of weapons of bacte-
riological warfare during World
War II:

If you want to understand BW
[Bacteriological Warfare] you must ﬁg-
uratively stand on your head. . . . BW
is an upside-down science, an inver-
sion of nature. Normally we study
disease in order to prevent it or cure it.
This is bacteriology right-side up. But
BW sets out to produce disease. It is
not normal or natural, but abnormal
and artiﬁcial. ‘

And John Kennedy and Charles
MacLeod write in their important
article, “The Militarization of Sci-
ence,” in the Autumn, 1950, issue of
the London M odcrn Quarterly:

Militarization does not mean the
mere passive neglect of other lines of
scientiﬁc development. It means the
active extension of the military grip,
not only within» the Government’s own
research establishments, but even into
the sacred precincts of “pure” science.
. . . The nature of the work itself tends
to reduce its scientiﬁc value. It has
been freely admitted that work on the
Hydrogen bomb is devoid of any peace-
time implications.

Such is the reality of the bourgeois
ﬁction of “free science.” In the words
of T. D. Lysenko, President of the
U.S.S.R. Lenin Academy of Agricul-
tural Sciences:

The barbarians of the Middle Ages
burned progressive men of science at
the stake. The barbarians of today are
anxious, with the help of some scien-
tists, to ravage the whole of civilization
with the atom bomb. Yes, in the land
of the dollar there are unfortunately
reactionary scientists who have sold
themselves, and science itself, to the
atomic cannibals. . . . What have they

in store for mankind? What are they

10

preparing for the tiller of the soil, for
the youth engaged in study, for the
mother, and for her infant asleep in
the cradle? Death."‘

As against the death-dealing role
assigned to science by capitalism,
there has arisen the life-giving sci-
ence of Socialism. Soviet science, in—
spired by the Party of Lenin and
Stalin, is exclusively the servant and
instrument of mankind in its inex-
orable march to a world of peace,
abundance, and truly humanist cul-
ture. While the atomaniacs pervert
science into an instrument for colos-
sal destruction, the Soviet system
ennobles science by directing it to-
ward the transformation of nature
into an unlimited source of light and
life for Man, the destined collective
master of the world. It is this
wondrous perspective o-f Man’s true
destiny which is at the base of the
construction of an epochal network
of hydroelectric stations and of the
massive soil reclamation projects in
the steppes and deserts of the
U.S.S.R.

GENOCIDE: THE
MALTHUSIAN FORMULA

If the bourgeois scientist seeks
“justification” for this utter disre-
gard of human life, the bourgeois
philosopher jumps to his aidwith
the latest version of the Malthus
“theory” of “over-population.”

Marx long ago exposed the falsity
and the reactionary essence of

* New Tinm. Moscow,  29. mo.

 

 

Malthusianism, which holds that
there is a “natural law” according to
which 0 ulation rowth outstri s

P P 8 P

the growth of the means of sub»

sistence. He demonstrated that an
absolute law of population does not’
exist, that “in fact, every special,
historic mode of production has its
own special law of population, ‘his-
torically valid within its limits alone.”

But this bourgeois staple is brought
out periodically to meet imperialism’s
current needs and to shift the blame
for existing social evils from the capi-
talist system to “natural” causes. To-
day, the Malthusian ghost is taken
out of the closet to serve the propa-
ganda of Anglo-Saxon supremacy
and, specifically, Wall Street’s blue-
print for world conquest.

Most notorious in the recent re—
turn of Malthus is William Vogt’s
widely—publicized tract of fascist mis-
anthropy, Road to Survival, replete
with such racist epithets as “these
spawning millions,” and “the hordes
of India and China.” Vogt expresses
the full extent of the brutality of a
doomed ruling class when he says:

There is little hope that the world
will escape the horror of extensive
famines in China within the next few
years. But from the world point of
view, these may be not only desirable,
but indispensable.

By “the world point of view,”
Vogt means only the capitalist world
point of view, the point of view of
the imperialist marauders and op-
pressors who have literally destroyed

the lives of millions of colonial peo-

11

ple by their exported civilization of
mass poverty, disease, and starvation.
And the empire builders of the
“American Century,” devise new
lethal weapons and new Malthusian
ideologies to turn into bloody Koreas
land after land, in continent after
continent.

The “up-tovdate” war-geared use
of the Malthusian formula comes
from Iulian Huxley, ﬁrst Director-
General of U.N.E.S.C.O. Writing in
Harper's, for September, 1950, he sup-
plies the ultra-“Western Civilization”
emphasis: -

Eastern rates of increase [which
he claims are outstripping Western
rates], prevail among the majority of
human beings now existing——in the
populations of Asia as a whole, of most
of the Balkans, of the U.S.S.R., of
Latin America, of North Africa—and
will very soon be prevailing in the rest
of Africa too.

From which gerrymandered geog— P

raphy and racist biology we get the
bourgeois “humanism”:

. . . We need a new view of human
destiny. Why, in heaven’s name, _ should
anyone suppose that mere quantity of
human organisms is a good thing, ir-
respective either of their own inherent
quality or the quality of their life and
their experiences?

And who will determine their
quality? Naturally, the Anglo—Saxon
self-appointed de-populators.

_, This is not science, but racist
geopolitics masked as science to

perpetuate colonialism, to “justify”

atomic annihilation of whole “in-
ferior” peoples.

This is racism, to justify wars of
conquest. The “colored” peoples are,

first, set down as “different,” “in-

J9 SK

ferior, over-populous,” living “nat-
urally” on low standards, and “used
to dying.” Therefore, we need not
feel guilty about killing them.

The bourgeois press reports pro-
minently Maj. Gen. Oliver Smith’s
statement in Korea that Chinese in-
telligence “must be of a low order-
and I don’t mean their military in-
telligence.” Indeed, to what “high”
order can the intelligence of the
Chinese belong when they treat cap-
tive American G.I.’s like human
beings and conduct them to safety?
These are not the ways of the “civili-
zation” that produced a Smith and a
MacArthur.

A Tokyo dispatch, under date of
September 17, 1950, informed the
world:

General MacArthur drove toward
Seoul today, looked down at four dead
Communist soldiers and declared,
“That’s a good sight for my old
eyes.” . . .

Here is civilization!

The shameful plight of Puerto
Rico is likewise attributed to the
island’s “surplus population,” to its
“Eastern rate of increase.” By this
perverted logic, the fascist propa-
gandist Vogt deplores the applica-
tion of the malaria cure in Puerto
Rico, “where the miracles of Ameri-
can medicine had been worked, with
the chief result that more people

12

 

were kept alive to live more miser-
ably.”

That the income per person in
Puerto Rico is, by Vogt’s own fig-
ures, 1/7 of the per capita income in
the United States, that living costs
are 27 percent higher, that there are
half a million unemployed in a popu-
lation of 2,500,000, that there is one
doctor for every 2,550 persons, and
that the mortality rate is alarming-—
all this is chargeable to “over—popu-
lation”!

The only “over—population” af-
ﬂicting Puerto Rico is that of the
U.S. sugar trusts and shipping com-
p-anies, which have stunted the na-
tive economy with a crippling mono-
culture for their super—proﬁts; the
“over-population” of U.S. ﬁnance
capital, which is holding down the
people in colonial bondage. Neo-
Malthusianism today aids Wall
Street’s cosmopolitanist propaganda
to undermine the struggle for Puerto
Rican national sovereignty.

These population “theories” serve
American imperialist designs for
world conquest, for war, for atomic
“equalization” of the “Eastern rate of
increase” to the “Western.” From
Lebensraum d la Hitler to Genocide
:2 la Western Civilization!

SOUNDS OF DOOM

While serving the arrogant chau-
vinism of Anglo-Saxon supremacy,
the ruling-class “culture” simul-
taneously reflects the crisis of its
grandiose “Marshall Plan in the ﬁeld
of ideas.” More and more, that cul-

 

 

‘W

ture expresses a frenzied recognition
of the handwriting on the wall.

The emancipation of China’s four
hundred and seventy-five million
people from the orbit of imperialism,
and the colonial-revolutionary up-
surge in many areas of Asia, express
not only a political rupture but a
revulsion on a sweeping scale to the
“culture” of “Western civilization.”
Not only have the European coun-
tries of People’s Democracy rejected
the shoddy cultural wares of Wall
Street, but the popular masses in
France, Italy, and other countries
have shown little enthusiasm for the
racist, -brutalizing, and pornographic
output that is ballyhooed as “art” and
“cultural” amusement.

The historic shift in the relation
of world forces in favor of the camp
of peace, democracy and Socialism,
led by the Soviet Union, is effecting
a qualitative cultural leap among
hundreds of millions. Not only in
the lands of People’s Democracy, but
in capitalist and colonial countries
where Communist parties exert wide
leadership, the masses are ever more
consciously influenced and inspired
by the culture of Socialist humanism
of the great Soviet people.

In the face of this situation, a
growing mood of dejection and dark-
ness is to be noted among strata of
bourgeois intellectuals in the United
States, who see in the ascending and
the new a “collapsing world,” an
“apocalyptic age.”

If you pick up current “learned”
magazines, you will ﬁnd a pervading

13

sense of doom, of a cultural impasse;
a mood of helplessness and despair.

Thus, William G. Carleton, Pro-
fessor of Political Science at the Uni-
versity of Florida, states in the
Antioch Review, summer, 1950, issue:

Contemporary man looks out upon
his modern world and is afraid. Not
since the declining days of the Roman
Empire . . . have such universal dread
and despair gripped the mind of the
West. . . . Men look upon this awful
spectacle of a collapsing world and
their mood is dominantly one of es-
cape . . escape from science and the
machine. But escape into what? Into
nihilism. Into authority. Into romanti-
cism, and mysticism. Into the self.

In the Arizona Quarterly for Au-
tumn, 195o, we read in an article
entitled, “Modern Literature and the
Sense of Doom”:

The literature of our time has . . .
reached a dead end. The professional
writer is still active, but the artist as
hero and prophet seems to have lost
both his voice and his function.

Such lamentations are, of course,
not new. In a general sense, they
began to be heard with the advent
of the epoch of capitalism’s decline,
sounding the basic pessimism of the
dying bourgeois class. They had their
classic expressions in Spengler’s De-
cline of the West and in Freud’s
postulate of the “death instinct.”
Now this despair is aggravated by
the sharpened general crisis of capi-
talism. Before the advancing colonial-
liberation movements and the mas-
sive successes of the World Socialist

forces, the “success story” of Wall
Street-Americanism “on the up-and-
up” is now disturbed by a dirge of
doom. »
These ideologues of capitalism
equate the inevitable doom of capi-
talist society with an alleged doom
of human society: therefore, if capi—
talism goes under, the world goes

_under. They shift the blame for all

things onto science, the machine, in
order to ab-solve bourgeois science
and monopoly-owned technology,
which pervert science and use the
machine for human exploitation.
They strive to block the vision of the
new and radiant life in the Socialist
Soviet Union, in People’s China, and
in the European countries of People’s
Democracy. These narrators of
“doom on both your houses” are de-
termined to disorient those who
might turn away from the pro-war
inﬂuence of imperialism and who
might regard with sympathy the

peace efforts of that great state whose _

system is Socialism. They seek to
confuse the people and hold back
their mass awakening to the hideous
realities of capitalism in the advanced
stage of decline.

The same Professor Carleton, who
so sharply described the “doom,” de-
scribes also the “escape”:

There is now an enormous pull to
return to the simple faith of Chris-
tianity. To an acute sense of distress is
added a terrible sense of guilt as man
is reminded that his own wandering
from Christianity has produced the
tragedies of our time. Iaoques Maritain

tells us that mankind has no, choice
except between two roads: the road to
Calvary and the road to the slaughter-
house. In America, there has been a
widening stream of converts to Catholi-
cism. . . _. Some Americans are urging
a return to Thomas Aquinas and Medi-
eval Scholasticism as the core of a col-
lege education. . . . There has been a
revitalizing of Protestant fundamen-
talism, too. . . .

The meaning of this “God—seek-
ing” is apparent from such statements
as that by Robert M. Hutchins,
Chancellor of the University of Chi-
cago, in an address to graduates a
few years back:

.. . . Civilization is doomed, unless
the hearts and minds of men can be
changed, unless we can bring about a
moral, intellectual, and spiritual refor-
mation, so deep and drastic as to be
called a revolution, throughout the
world.‘

The present manufactured rage of
religionism among bourgeois intel-
lectuals has its direct services to capi-
talism. It is designed to paralyze the
will to struggle against the imperialist
enemies of mankind, by implanting
a “guilt feeling” in the common man,
disposing him to self-abnegation and
self-humiliation, and leading him to
fatalistic acceptance of suffering and
destruction. . V

The vogue of religionism is re-
flected in the wide promotion of re-
actionary clerical books. Thus, Henry

Morgan Robinson’s novel, The Car-
dinal, designed to glorify the Roman _

Catholic hierarchy and to conceal its
reactionary role, is the top best—seller
of 1950. Long a best-seller, too, was
Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman’s Peace
of Mind, which seeks to provide an
escape from the social realities of
capitalism through a wedding of re-
ligion and Freud. Msgr. Sheen’s latest
rigged best-seller, Lift U [2 Your
Heart, carries on the obscurantist
crusade. Henry Luce’s Life maga-
zine dresses up medieval theology
with expensive pictures. Ludwig
Lewisohn, in his latest book, The
American Iew, condemns biological
evolution and advocates an orthodox
religious structure for the totality of
Jewish life in the United States. Vin-
cent Sheean “builds up” the cult of
Gandhism. And the Trotskyite Par-
tisan Review contrives a “sympo-
sium,” “Religion and the Intellec-
tuals,” which the bourgeois press is
quick to praise.

The “‘God—seekers” moreover, give
a mystical, God—ordained purpose to
American imperialism’s expansionist
designs for the kingdom of earth.

Thus Arnold Toynbee, exponent-
in-chief of the “God-seeking” cult,
stated on Korea:

Religion is the center of our present
ideological conﬂict between East and
West. . . . Today America has been
called upon to assume a position of
world leadership.

Notwithstanding the wrapping of
the Messiah’s robe about the devils
of Wall Street, the current cult of
religionism cannot even so much as

Its

lay claim to promoting “the brother-

hood of man.” For, it stems so ar-
rantly from contempt for man, from
hatred of man. Robert M. Hutchins
formulated this credo:

Unless we believe that every man is
the child of God, we cannot love our
neighbors. Most cats and most dogs are
more attractive than most men.*

But the prize “humanist” among
these “God-seekers” is Bertrand Rus-
sell, who declared in a recent New
York interview that he “would favor
the use of the hydrogen bomb if the
latter oﬁered the only hope of saving
the Western world from defeat.”**

In a lecture that same evening,
this defender of the “Western world”
with hydrogen bombs opened up his
heart and declared:

The root of the matter is .
Christian love, or compassion.

. . love,

Bertrand Russell, pride of bour-
geois science, freshly crowned with
the laurels of the Nobel prize, has
thus achieved the perfect synthesis of
Genocide and Godly love.

Yet what is the “Western world”?
What is the nature of the danger
that threatens it with defeat, to avert
which the august philosopher is
ready to use the hydrogen bomb?
In the semantics of Bertrand Russell
et al, “Western world” is the synonym
of Anglo-American imperialism and
its way of life; mass impoverishment,
colonial slavery, racism, the threat of
fascism, brutal exploitation, and re-

curring crises and wars. The great
danger to this “Western world,”
which the Russells well realize, but
seek to hide, comes from the aspira-
tions of the masses for economic
security, for democratic rights, for
national self-determination, for world
peace, and from the inexorable march
of the working class, leading the
common people in each country of
capitalism, toward the direct strug-
gle for Socialism.

II. MANIFESTATIONS
OF RESISTANCE

When we consider the positive
counterforces for peace and the de-
fense of culture, Peekskill stands 0-ut
as a landmark of struggle. Peekskill
brought masses into struggle, work-
ing-class and Negro masses, artists
and intellectuals, people of the profes-
sions. There the working class, there
the militant Negro people defended
progressive culture and its creators
against the Nazi-like attack inspired
by the warmakers. There the valiant
peop-le’s artist, Paul Robeson, de-
fended with his art and with his life
the cultural rights. of his people and
of the American working class.
There, too, Howard Fast by his cou-
rageous stand demonstrated the vital
role that democratic and peace-striv-
ing intellectuals can play in united-
front struggle against the forces of
fascism and war. Let us remember
that masses of people can be reached
and brought into motion around
such vital cultural issues.

And the Hollywood Ten—-the best

16

tribute we can accord these .courage-
ous ﬁghters against reaction in cul-
ture is to recognize that the anger of
the ruling class against them is a
measure of their value to the people.
The struggle for freedom of the eight
still behind bars is an issue around
which masses. of workers and profes-
sionals, here and abroad, have been
rallied and many more can be
reached.

Against the fascist blacklist and
censorship campaign spearheaded by
Red Channel: and Counter-attack,
there is gathering resentment which
can be organized into- a storm of pro-
test. The statements issued by the
Author’s League of America, em-
bracing the Dramatists’, Screen-Writ-
ers’, Radio Writers’, and. Authors’
Guilds, branded the censorship of
content and the b-lacklisting of artists
for their political opinions as prac-
tices smaeking of Hitlerism. A sharp
statement against blacklisting was
issued by Actors’ Equity Association.
The National Council of the Arts,
Sciences, and Professions (A.S.P.)
has not only condemned these at-
tacks, but has shown their close tie-
up with the attempt to silence the
voices of peace. These protests can be
consolidated into a broad united-
front movement for cultural free-
dom. This movement will grow
stronger as it comes to realize that
its fight is part of the general ﬁght
for peace. .

We should note, too, the mani-
festations of resistance in the ranks
of scientists, though they are as yet

 

 

sporadic and weakly organized. For
example, Linus C. Pauling, head of
the chemistry division of the Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology,
sharply criticized Professor Urey for
‘supporting the anti—Soviet atomic-
bomb policy, declaring that Urey did
not speak for the general body of
American scientists in advocating
force as the solution of present world
problems. Leading men of science
like Professor Harlow Shapley, Kitt-
ley Mather, Anton J. Carlson, Philip
Morrison, and Dirk Struik have been
prominent in the cause of peace.

At the same time, it must be
pointed out that the scientists as a
group have not taken a clear and
consistent stand against the attempt
to pervert their knowledge in the
service of imperialist destruction. All
too many have allowed themselves
to be silenced by the witch—hunt
mania, and others have been bribed
and corrupted.

A key point of the struggle against
Nazi—like controlof the mind is the
gallant ﬁght of the New York
Teachers’ Union against dictatorial
ﬁrings, anti—Semitism, and discrimi-
nation. An outstanding example of
resistance to fascization of the college
campus hasbeen the struggle against
the “loyalty” oath in California.
There is mounting indignation and
protest on the part of parent—teacher
associations against militarizing the
public schools and terrorizing the
minds of children with atom-bomb

“defense” drills.
In many instances the ﬁght against

17

the blacklist, censorship, “loyalty”
tests, and other forms of persecution
has been seriously weakened by con-
cessions to Red-baiting on the part
of the victims of Red-baiting. This
imposes on Communists and all pro-
gressives the duty to warn against
this trap and to point out the in-
separable connection between the at-
tacks on the citizenship of Commu-
nists and on the rights of all Ameri-
cans. It imposes, moreover, the neces-
sity to arouse the labor movement in
defense of the artists and profession-
als victimized by the thought-control-
lers and warmongers——a class duty to-
ward allies which it has to date left
shamefully unfulﬁlled.

Today there is a signiﬁcant de-
velopment of independent expres-
sions of working—class and people’s

culture, such as People’s Drama and s

New Playrights in New York, such
as the highly talented group under
the auspices of the Committee for the
Negro in the Arts now producing
Simple Speak: His Mind in Harlem,
the People’s Artists Singers, the Yid-
dish Theatre Ensemble, and other
theatres and choruses of the national
groups. An encouraging development
is the formation of the ﬁlm-produc-
tion unit of the United Labor Action
Committee. A welcome beginning,
too, is the A.S.P.—sponsored series of
cultural forums and programs. This
movement for independent progres-
sive expression in the arts. is not
limited to New York. It extends to
Chicago, Los Angeles, San.Francisco,
Philadelphia, Newark, and other

cities.. Its importance in this period
cannot be overstated. These ﬁne be-
ginnings should spur similar cultural
formations in every section of the
country. We must recognize with
greater seriousness than ever before
the need for stressing the respons-
ibility of labor and progressive
audiences to support such groups and
help their growth.

We must emphasize here the vital
necessity for building the Negro peo-
ple’s theatre, both in the South and
in the principal Negro communities
in the North. It is a crime that the
great creative talents of the Negro
people-—symbolized by such artists
as Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes,
Theodore Ward, Alice Childress,
and Frank Silvera—shou1d continue
to be denied such a theatre through-
out the land. It is the responsibility
of the entire Left and progressive
movement, not only to help bring
into existence the Negro people’s
theatre, but to help establish the Ne-
gro people’s House of Culture for
all forms of cultural creation.

This great task demands of our
Party the vanguard guidance deriv-
ing from the Marxist-Leninist under-
standing of the national question as
it applies to the liberation movement
of the Negro people. Concretely,
here, this means that the historical
roots of that attribute of nationhood
deﬁned by Stalin as a common psy-
chological makeup manifested in a
common culture are to be found in
the Black Belt of the South, where
the Negro people constitute a subject

18

 

nation. It follows from this that the
cultural strivings and affirmations of
the Negro people as a whole, those
realized and those still latent, draw
their basic sustenance and strength
from the cultural. mainspring, the
fountainhead, the subject nation.
Consciousness of this principle will
give us deeper understanding of the
signiﬁcant need for the development
of a broad Negro people’s cultural
movement as an integral part of the
unfolding national-liberation strug-
le.

g In this period, the publishing prob-
lems of progressive, and certainly of
Marxist, writers have, of course,
vastly increased. The commercial
book publishers and the editors of
bourgeois periodicals have shut the
door ‘to realistic depictions of the
world we live in. Only that which is
distorted, cynical, debasing, or at
best trivial and evasive, has a pass-
port to print.

We must offer our help to every
manifestation of resistance on the
part of writers to this thought-repres-
sion and censorship. In addition, we
must all the more cherish the cultural
publications of the Left, as well as
help the expansion of publication
facilities for honest and courageous
writing. Unquestionably, more and
more writers of integrity will be
looking to us for guidance and help,
as well as encouragement, in reach-
ing people with their message.

We should here greet the valuable
role that Masses <“y« Mainstream is
playing on the cultural front. Con-

 

stantly strengthening itself in the
struggle it is carrying on for peace
and a people’s culture, this magazine
has made a distinct contribution in
its three-year existence under the
editorship of Samuel Sillen and the
associate editors Lloyd L. Brown and
Herbert Aptheker. The magazine
should be warmly supported as the
main publication medium for the
progressive cultural forces today. It is
gratifying to know that Masses 6*
Mainstream, which has made avail-
able to American readers, in the spirit
of proletarian internationalism, the
writings of eminent world artists like
Pablo Neruda, Nazim Hikmet, Ilya
Ehrenburg, and Martin Andersen
Nexo, is appreciated in many coun-
tries.

The Daily Worker in its cultural ,

page has carried on a consistent
struggle against bourgeois culture, in
its various reactionary manifestations
in literature and the arts, with parti-
cular emphasis on the mass media.
It has made a solid contribution in
showing the tie-up between such reac-
tionary cultural manifestations and
the imperialist drive toward war. It
has tirelessly fought racist content in
the arts and all white chauvinist
practices, and it has championed the
appreciation and proper utilization
of the talents of Negro artists. De-
serving of special mention is its mili-
tant ﬁlm department conducted by
David Platt, which has on a day-to-
day basis exposed the dangerous con-
tent of the Hollywood product. The
Party membership and the progres-

sive forces, much more than in the
past, should regard the Daily Work-
er as the central mass Marxist ex-
pression, not only in the economic
and political spheres, but also in the
sphere of culture. Its ﬁght for Marx-
ist clarity in culture should enlist the
participation and support of all ad-
vanced cultural workers. But beyond
that, ways must be found to bring its
inﬂuence upon ever-wider sections of
the working class, in the struggle
against the fascization of culture as
an organic part of the entire struggle
against war and fascism.

AS ARTIST AND
AS CITIZEN

In the actions for peace during the
postwar years, sections of the intel-
lectuals and various strata of profes-

sionals have played an outstanding‘

role. The recent period, however, has
seen a marked decline in the or-
ganized participation of cultural
forces in the ﬁght for peace from the
high point of the I949 Cultural and
Scientific Conference for World
Peace. This decline was noticeable in
the campaign for signatures to the
Stockholm Peace Petition. It was fur-
ther apparent in the negligible in-
volvement of artists and writers in
the United States delegation to the
Second World Peace Congress at
Warsaw in November, 1950.

It would, however, be the gravest
mistake to conclude from this fact
that the bulk of the cultural forces
have been Won over to the War camp
or that they are unconcerned with the

19

issue of war or peace. The error of
such an assumption is evident, for
example, from the dismal failure of
General Clay’s so-called Freedom
Crusade to win any mass support
among cultural forces on a national
scale.

What needs to be stated with re-
spect to the peace-desiring intellec-
tuals is that, in the absence of lead-
ership by the working class, their
traits of hesitancy and vacillation,
characteristic of the petty bourgeoisie,
tend to become intensiﬁed. For, only
working class leadership will weld
these forces into an important seg-
ment of the entire peace front, ren-
dering them more steadfast and more
consciously purposive.

The Party’s emphasis on the ur-
gent need for a policy of concentra-
tion on the workers in basic industry
has as a key objective the advance-
ment of working-class leadership in
the struggle for peace. In applying
this correct policy, we have to guard
against neglect of the peace forces
among the intellectuals and profes-
sionals. The building of a peace front
broad enough and effective enough
to influence events and to force a
change in the foreign policy of our
country must have the active and
signiﬁcant participation of the cul-
tural forces.

Peekskill shows that the attack on
culture is not a thing apart from
reaction’s general drive, or marginal
to it, but that it is one of the domi-
nant expressions of the warmakers’
offensive. It was Robeson’: use of his

20

great artistic talents and high cultural
contributions as weapons for peace
and the people’s rights that brought
the wrath of fascism upon him. It
was the progressive ideological con-
tent in the work of the Hollywood
Ten that marked them for victimiza-
tion by the un-American Committee.
It was the anti-racist ideological es-
sence of the play They S/uzll N at Die
that brought the attacks of the Chris-
tian Front hoodlums upon the cast
of People’s Drama.

We have noted how monopoly
capital, bent on war and fascism, is
subjecting every art form and every
cultural medium on all audience
levels to direct and overt political use
for the propagation of its lying anti-
Communist, anti-working class, anti-
peace, and anti—humanist ideas. Drop-
ped are the masks of “art for art’s
sake” and of “pure science.”

The intellectuals’s work in the
peace movement, however, has
tended to be limited to the direct
political plane, to participation only
as “citizens.” Such activity, in the
form of rallies, petitions, statements
to the press, etc., is most valuable
and needs to be greatly expanded
through united-front efforts in many
directions. Yet the full value of the
contributions of men and women of
the arts and sciences in such progres-
sive coalition actions demands for its
realization that they participate cons-
ciously as artists and as scientists in
the great social struggles of our times.
Such integrated. cultural endeavor is
vital to the development of the peace

 

 

movement and of an independent
people’s culture. A novelist who
ﬁghts with his voice but not with his
pen, an artist who gives his name to
the ﬁght but not his brush, a scientist
who ﬁghts against the destruction of
his civil rights but not of his science,
ﬁghts with one hand, and with the
other objectively aids the enemy.

Reactionary content in culture can-
not be fought in the economic and
political sphere solely; it must be
challenged and fought with the
counter-ideology of progressive and
working—class culture, which the
Communists must lead in develop-
ing. The “p~racticalism,” rationalized
by the pressures of the work for
peace, that cannot pause for concern
with the content of the artist’s or
scientist’s work, is opportunism,
analagous to “economism” in the
trade unions.

Nor can we effectively wage the
broad battle of ideas, unless we battle
for the advanced, Marxist-Leninist
ideas in culture. For example, to
combat the general run of anti—So-
viet propaganda, but not to ﬁght for
the Marxist-Leninist principles in the
Soviet discussions of the sciences,
literature, and the arts, is to leave
these vital cultural ﬁelds to the
enemy and to weaken the struggle
against anti—Sovietism as a whole.

However, it would manifestly be
wrong to demand of everyone who
participates on a political—cultural
basis in a united-front peace activity
or organization that he necessarily
give full expression to the proletarian

class ideology. What should be ex—
pected of him is that he express him-
self as citizen and as artist on the
level of his own understanding. Of
course, it is the task of Communists
to help the non-Communists in the
united front to understand that the
cultural forces with their pursuits
and talents can, in alliance with the
working class, labor and struggle to
hasten the end of a system which,
historically doomed, enslaves and
humiliates them.

THE PARTY AS A
CULTURAL FORCE

A decisive turn is needed in the
Party’s cultural Work. We must
abandon the old concept that cultural
work is activity only among cultural
workers. Cultural work has to be
viewed as organically related to the
Party’s mass tasks——not directed
limitedly toward a single social
stratum, but carried on among
masses of the people, the working
class, the rural poor, the Negro peo-
ple, the national groups, the youth,
and the cultural workers. Cultural
activity is an essential phase of the
Party’s general ideological work, and
as such is interconnected with the
Party’s struggles in the economic and
political spheres. For Marxists—Lenin-
ists it should, therefore, be axiomatic
that cultural Work is for the Party
inalienable from general mass work.

Not only must we end any nega-
tive approaches to cultural tasks, all
vestiges of cultural nihilism, but we
must learn to use the weapon of cul-

21

ture in respect to the main tasks be-
fore our Party: the struggle for peace
and for civil rights; the struggle to
advance the working class to the
position of leader in the coalition
movements of the people; the strug-
gle to weld the alliance of the work-
ing class and the liberation move-
ment of the Negro people, to bring
forward the Negro workers as the
leading force in that movement; and
the Party’s task of concentration in
the shops of basic industry.

This task becomes all the more im-
portant because of the increased prob-
lems faced by the cultural workers
in ﬁnding channels for their talents
and professions. Actors’ Equity As-
sociation ﬁgures for the theatrical
year ending June 1950, showed the
average player to have worked on the
stage ten weeks and earned $840.
With intensiﬁed chronic unemploy-

, ment in the theatre, music, and other

areas of the monopoly-owned “amuse-
ment ﬁeld,” more and more artists
are being driven into industry. This
condition hits most heavily the Ne-
gro artists. The worsening of the eco-
nomic status of artists in all ﬁelds is
accompanied by growing political re-
pression, thought-control, regimenta—
tion, and blacklisting, which under-

. mine the very basis for the cultural

worker to function even in a mini-
mum way with self-respect. Con-
sequently, ever—increasing numbers
of professionals and artists will be
impelled to turn to the working class
as’ the base and preserving force of
their talents.

22

 

More than ever, therefore, it must
become the conscious duty of the
working class, particularly the pro-
gressive trade unions, and of the peo-
ple’s organizations to provide at least
a minimum economic base at this
stage for those artists and profes-
sionals who will build independent
cultural organizations serving the
working class. Such collaboration
will enrich simultaneously the talents
of the professionals and the culture
of the working class.

The main responsibility for help-
ing to realize this task devolves on
the Party. It is an important task,
one that affects the growthvof the
Party itself and the development of
a mass class-consciousness. The
Party’s. recognition and acceptance of
this responsibility, its consistent ef-
fort to carry through this task, will

help to end the long era of labor’s "

non—resistance to capital’s attacks
with the weapon of bourgeois cul-
ture.

The National Cultural Commis-
sion urges upon the Party adequate
attention to developing cadres for
work on the cultural front, to select-
ing and training such cadres, and to
promoting leadership from among
them, with special attention to Ne-
gro cadres, women cadres, and cadres
from the youth. Our Party must
strive to bring forward cadres in the
cultural ﬁeld who can be forces of
the people,‘with unbounded faith in
the working class.

This_ new orientation requires,
further, a re-examination of the or-

...,,,.j,...:.,... , ..

 

ganizational forms within the Party,
for the fulﬁllment of these tasks. It
requires most particularly the recog-
nition that cultural work is not the
work of a department or of a few
individuals, that it is the work of the
Party. The Party must become as a
whole, through its ranks and through
the various levels of its leadership,
conscious of the need to deal with
this question adequately, and cons-
cious‘ of the opportunities that work
in this ﬁeld offers our Party and the
working class.

Therefore, the question arises of
establishing leading bodies in this
ﬁeld, commissions, committees, etc.,
and assignments of leading comrades
on national, state, county, and section
levels, particularly in industrial con-
centration areas.

The Commission takes the posi-

tion that our cultural workers must
no longer be isolated in separate
P.arty organizations. Instead of sepa-
rating them from the healthy influ-
ences of the proletarian membership
of the Party and at the same time
depriving the Party ranks in the basic
organizations of their broad cultural
experience, we should integrate our
cultural forces with all Party organi-
zations.

Our cultural work is more than a
technique for rallying people. The
American bourgeoisie, driving down
the road of total national betrayal,
strives to obliterate every revolution-
ary, democratic and militant tradi-
tion of the people, to destroy every
expression of people’s culture. In this

23

fateful hour, the Party is called upon
to lead in the defense of the people’s
cultural heritage and in the struggle
to aﬂirm the vital creativeness of the
people. The progressive stream in the
cultural heritage of the American
people courses through the great
struggles of the masses in the Ameri-
can Revolution, the Abolitionist
movement, the unceasing freedom
struggle of the Negro people, the
great militant traditions of the work-
ing class in the ﬁght against capitalist
exploitation and imperialist war. This
heritage is symbolized by such names
as Tom Paine, Phillis -Wheatley and
Philip Freneau; Wendell Phillips
and Frederick Douglass; Walt Whit-
man and Mark Twain; Joe Hill,
Theodore Dreiser, and John Reed.

Our Party will carry this task to
success, if it exercises its own inde-
pendent, Marxist rolein culture, as
in the political and economic spheres.
Cultural work for the Party should
thus become an integral aspect of its
whole activity. Only as it learns to
grasp the weapon of culture and
ﬁghts with it, only as our Party itself
comes forward as a creative cultural
force, will it be able to contribute
effectively to the development of the
cultural expressions of the working
class and the people, and to mobilize

them to ﬁght with that weapon in a

defense of peace and culture itself.
A true understanding of our inde-
pendent role should require that
Communist cultural workers create
in the interests of the Working class
and from the standpoint of its lib-

crating world outlook. The situation
demands from our creative forces
novels and plays, poems, paintings,
musical compositions, popular songs,
and criticism, vibrant with the Party
spirit, the very essence of Socialist
realism.

In carrying through these tasks,
our Party must further unfold be-
fore the people the nature, purpose,
scope, and world signiﬁcance of the
inspiring Socialist culture of the So-
viet Union, as well as the rising cul-
ture of the free peoples in the New
China and the European countries of
People’s Democracy. We must make
known to the people the true essence
of the science and art of the eman-
cipated society of the Socialist Soviet
Union. We must show that Socialist
culture rises on a foundation involv-
ing no human exploitation and

anarchic production, no economic

crises, no‘ class antagonisms, no drives

S to fascism and war. The culture of

the mighty Socialist state which is

24

the bulwark of world peace and the
freedom of nations, this truly civilized
culture is based on the great scientiﬁc
teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Stalin, which guide today the Soviet
people’s course to Communism, and
which give perspective, conﬁdence,
and inspiration to the foi'ward—striv-
ing forces of mankind the world
over. .

‘ As Marxists-Leninists, we voice the
deepest needs and aspirations of the
people, Negro and white, native and
foreign-born. The warmongers and
their decadent cultural apologists of-
fer the people physical and spiritual
impoverishment, the slow death of
subservience and the swift death of
the atom born'b. Our Party offers the
people the science and culture of true
human relations based on the guar-
anteed rights to material satisfaction
and cultural fulﬁllment. We must go
forward to the people with the mes-
sage of peace, of freedom, of Socialist
humanism. i

Never in all their shameful career

if of subverting science and the arts

to the life-destroying policies of im-
perialism, have the war lords of
Wall Street so debauched the cul-
tural media, as now in their ﬁend-
ish drive to enslave the world. What
matters decency, what matter truth,
integrity, art, so long as the kept
press, the less—than-objective critics,
and the rigged prize donors can keep

mass propaganda media—radio, tele-

newspapers, and publishing houses. It
is now spreading to all workers in
these areas, to the point that at C.B.S

loyalty o are re uired of all em-
 mainten-
ance men and office workers. This
pattern is reaching out, as our Party
warned, beyond the “Left” to all who
will not be completely regimented
behind the war drive. Even a reac-
tionary radio commentator like
Drew Pearson loses his contract for
not going along with Senator Mc-
Carthy all the way. This signiﬁes
the process of fascization of culture.
It is an attempt to follow Hitler’s
pattern, to establish a U.S. version
of the Nazi National Chamber of
Culture.

As Wall Street rings the globe
with its armies and military bases,
as it invades and seizes and violates
territories, as it perpetrates Nazi-
like atrocities upon soldiers and
civilians, its statesmen -and apolo-
gists thicken the camouﬂage with

assurances like W. Averell Harri-
man’s declaration at the 1950 New
York Herald Tribune Forum:

For the first time in history, the
most powerful nation in the world is
dedicated to peace and in partnership
with other nations is mobilizing its
moral force and its resources for world
security.

Even so did Hitler’s expansionist
drives take on the name of “New
Order.”

Thus Wall Street seeks to mask
its 'c'ﬁauvinism with bour 
 anisrn. it ‘ s“
a out t e o soleteness of nations,”
and the need for a “world nation,”
it attempts to break the resistance

  

of the nations to being sucked into (

and national culture of other peo- ’

ples. Anglo—Saxon chauvinism would
force Wall Street’s ideas and debased

- cultural products upon peoples the

world over, commandeering to that
end its newspapers, magazines,
books, and broadcasts; its Holly-
wood, Tin Pan Alley, and coca cola.

Saxon supremacy myth pervades all

cultural areas, down to the standard- Nélaﬁgm

With every propaganda‘ medium

tune for December, 1950, is pleased
to inform the world, “American
businessmen, by and large, do not
work for money alone.” In an ar-
ticle headed, “The Moral History
/of U.S. Business,” Fortune intro-
duces “the ‘businessman as saint,”
dedicated to “proﬁt and piety” and
“the Gospel of Service.” He is shown
to the world as the “trustee of wealth
for the poor and for civilization.” We
are told of the “considered benefac-
tions of Carnegie, Rockefeller, Mor-
gan,” and of Henry Ford, the
“apostle of the more—for—less creed.”
The exceptionalism of American Big
Business, the two—hundred—year “sur-
vey” concludes, lies in “its tireless
quest” for “moral motives and pur-
poses”, which “has bred a high order
of that ‘divine discontent’ which is a
sign of man’s spirituality.”

Verily, can anyone challenge the
heaven-ordained claim of such a
capitalism to take the world under
its divine wings!

Equally trimmed for show-window
display at home and abroad is the
