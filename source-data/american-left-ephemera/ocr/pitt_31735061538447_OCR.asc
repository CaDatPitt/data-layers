him. He repeated his boast later in the courtroom. The autopsy
revealed Esquibel had been shot in the back. ’
The crowd—Ro~berts later on called it “bloodthirsty”——stood
mourning its dead, while Roberts telephoned for an ambulance.
Part of the preparations Gamerco had been making ever since
the 1933 strike, to smash the militant ﬁghting spirit of the miners,
was the organization of a fascist gang—made up of small business
men, some members of the American Legion, and some of the
cowboys from the surrounding cattle-country, who, isolated on the

_ ranges, had not developed to an understanding of their community

of interest with -the miners and the unemployed. A signal for action.
by this gang had been set. A pre-arranged series of blasts on the
town’s ﬁre-siren by Roberts, now, brought the members running.
He deputized two hundred of them and sent them out to round
up "every known Communist, and every leader of the I.L.D., the
Unemployment Councils, and other workers’ organizations.”

Two hundred were arrested that day. A few days later, follow-
ing a speech of incitement by General John  Pershing, who
stopped by in Gallup to praise the terror, 600 were arrested.

Secretary of Labor’s Deportation Department set to work. More
than 100 were held without warrant (this is still illegal) for depor-
tation to Fascist Yugoslavia, to Spain, to Mexico.

Out of the 800 arrested (about 15 per cent of the population
of Gallup), 48, ten of them women, were held on murder charges.
No investigati-ton was made of the deputies who had committed
the murders. The frame-up machinery went to work.

Chapter IV. The Defense

Attorney A. L. Wirin of the American Civil Liberties Union,
arriving by plane from Los Angeles, ‘was the first legal defender
on the scene. With Clarence Lynch, I.L.D. attorney of Santa Fe,

.-to which city the 48 had been taken for safe-keeping, he proceeded

10

 

 

 

\

to organize the legal part of the defense. The entire local leader-

ship of the I.L.D. was under arrest. From Denver, district center
of the I.L.D., a mass movement for defense of the Gallup miners
was set on foot, linked with the ﬁght against the deportation of
thousands of foreign-born unemployed in Colorado.

In New York, the National Executive Committee of the I.L.D.
organized a Gallup Defense Committee, with Robert Minor as
chairman. It sent David Levinson, attorney in the Reichstag ﬁre-
trial and many other labor cases of national and international
prominence, to Gallup and Santa Fe to work on the defense. Minor
himself, having set the defense machinery in motion on a national
scale, proceeded to Santa Fe. A Defense Committee was organized

there, cooperating with the national committee and with the com-

mittee in Denver.

The preliminary hearing before Judge M. A. Otero, _Ir., took
four days. The presecution put on its best and best-coached wit-
nesses. They contradicted each other so much that the story began
to crumple. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins stepped in to help.
Her agents, acting under orders from Washington, arrested 13
of the most important defense witnesses, for immediate deportation.
Three were arrested in the courtroom itself during the preliminary
hearing. ,

Finally, under the pressure of mounting protest, and the spirited
attack of the defense attorneys, Judge Otero was forced to release
all but ten. These are held for the grand jury, charged with
murder under a law passed before New Mexico became a state, and
never used since that time, which holds all those present at the
scene of the killing of an officer of the law (‘guilty of murder.” The
fact that none of the technicalities called for under that law——t.he
reading of the riot act, etc.—had been complied with, makes no
difference to the court.

These are the ten:

Leandro Valerde, married, one son six years old, Spanish-Amer-
ican citizen of the U.S., member of the I.L.D. and the Unemploy-
ment Council. '

Willie Gonzales, married, two children, member U.M.W.A.

Rafael Gomez, single, member I.L.D., U.C.
Serapio Sosa, married, four children, member I.L.D., U.C.

These are held on 37,500 bond each. All ten are also charged
with aiding a prisoner no escape. $1,000 bond is set for them on
this charge. Besides these, three women and one man are held on
the second charge, under $500 bond. They are:

Mrs. Teresa Avita, one child, -member I.L.D., U.C.
Mrs. Altagracia Gomez, ﬁve children, member I.L.D., U.C.

Mrs. Dominica Hernandez, member of the same organizations.

Jose G. Lopez, married, member of the I.L.D., U.M.W.A.

Chapter V. The Real Issues

The Gamerco and the State of New Mexico demand the legal
lynching of ten men. Yet it does not dare to charge that a single
one of them ﬁred a single shot. Sheriii D. Roberts’ testimony was
that Valerde and Esquibel fired the shots that killed Carmichael,
whereupon he himself, Roberts, shot them. No gun taken from
the dead hands of Valerde, or from the wounded Esquibel, has
been produced. The testimony regarding weapons in the hands of
the crowd was so clumsily faked that Judge Otero was forced to
throw it out. . »

to exploitation, oppression, and terror——these are the real purposes
of the prosecution. "This is essentially a trade-union question,”
as Bob Minor has said.

The issue is the right to organize for economic demands, and
against fascist terror.

The open terror is continuing. Two days after the kidnapping
of Minor and Levinson, a band of vigilantes drove through town,
pouring a rain of bullets into the homes of two miners.

The vigilante violence, the frame-up charges, the deportation
proceedings, are part of a campaign of terror sweeping the country
from coast to coast. The campaign has thousands of links. The
criminal syndicalism convictions in Sacramento, California, and in
Oregon; the federal "sedition” convictons in Oklahoma; the Bur-
lington, N. C., “dynamite” frame-up aimed at the United Textile
Workers of America; the savage prosecution of the innocent Scotts-
‘boro boys and Angelo Herndon; the reign of thuggery and murder
against strikers throughout the country; the vigilante terror of
Imperial yalley; the hundreds of repressive laws introduced in
Congress and in state legislatures; the Ku Klux Klan terror and
lynchings throughout the South; the police terror in Harlem and
the frame-up of Clyde Allen in Brooklyn—a.ll these are links
in the terror chain of the New Deal.

The kidnapping of Minor and Levinson is not isolated. Only
two days before, on May Day, Robert Wood, district secretary of
the I.L.D., was kidnapped, beaten, and thrown into a creek in
the woods near Birmingham, Alabama. On April 28, an organizer
of the American Workers Union and an organizer of the Com-
munist Party were kidnapped in Kansas City. This is the record of
kidnappings for a few days only.

The violence of the ruling class must be met with the strongest
organized defense.

The defense of the Gallup miners is an issue for every trade-
unionist, every lover of justice and hater of fascist violence.

Thousands of dollars will be needed to ﬁght these murder
charges, and deportation proceedings which in many cases are the

" HIS is essentially a trade union question, and we already see i

in New Mexico tbe beginning of a solid trade union front.
The International Labor Defense’: splendid work must be broad-
ened to include all trade unions in its defense movement” —
Robert Minor, internationally famous labor leader, and chairman
of the National Gallup Defense Committee of the International
Labor Defense, to reporters who asked him for a statement after
his kidnapping, together with David Levinson, well-known I.L.D.
lawyer, at Gallup, New Mexico, May 2, 1935.

Minor and Levinson were preparing the defense of ten militant
Gallup miners framed on murder charges, when they were kid-
napped and beaten. The terror that spreads its fascist wings over
New Mexico, the defense of the ten- Gallup coal-miners, and the
background of the frame-up, are the subject of this pamphlet.

Chapter I . The Kidnapping
HE Plaza at Gallup, New Mexico, the very center of a coal-
mining and Indian trading center, is a busy, bustling, place.
But every night, around eleven or eleven-thirty, it quickly becomes
deserted. Passers-by rapidly diminish,‘ and the infrequent sounds
of footsteps and voices echo loudly. At ten o’clock at night, how-
ever, in decent weather, it is by no means deserted.

At ten o’clock on the night of May 2, three people sat in a
car parked in the center of this Plaza, in front of the low stuccoed
building of the El Navajo hotel. They were Robert Minor, one
of the most famous and best beloved of American labor leaders,
and the chairman of the National Gallup Defense Committee;
David Levinson, internationally known labor lawyer, retained by
the Defense Committee and the International Labor Defense, and
Mrs. Julia Bartol. They had been sitting there since 9:15.

Mrs. Bartol is the wife of Joe Bartol, president of the Gallup
local of the United Mine Workers of America, ﬁnancial secretary
of the Gallup branch of the I.L.D., and one of ten men charged
with murder in one of the rawest frame-ups in American history.
Minor and Levinson were in Gallup to confer with her and with
other important witnesses on the organization of the defense of
the Gallup ten. They and other members of the defense committee
had come from _Santa Fe that day, and had ‘set up headquarters in

p L the El Navajo. Caution against the use of dictaphones, however,

dictated. that they should hold their present conference in the
middle of the Plaza, in Mrs. Bartol’s car.

i Just about ten o’clock, two cars approached, circled slowly,
around the parked automobile, and went off down a side street. In
a few moments they returned, with a third car, drew up beside
Mrs. Bartol’s, and stopped. _ A group of three men stepped out of

. 3 .

them. Black masks like hoods, with slits for the eyes, covered
their faces.

They closed in around the parked car, opened its doors, and
held revolvers on the three inside.

"Don’t make a sound!” one of them, a leader, ordered.

Minor, Levinson, and Mrs. Bartol, shouted deﬁance.

A rain of blows answered them. A gun was poked roughly into
Mrs. Bartol’s ribs. A pistol-butt knocked Minor unconscious as he

resisted. He and Levinson were dragged out and thrown on the‘

floor of two different machines, which drove off rapidly toward the
north. Mrs. Bartol started up her car, but one of the men stepped
out of the third machine and levelled a pistol at her. .

“Shut up and stay put, or we’ll take you for a ride too,”
he said.

By this time the first two cars were long out of sight. The third
soon followed them. _

From the hotel Navajo, Mrs. Bartol called the police station.
There was no answer. The sheriff. There was no answer. She

called Governor Clyde Tingley at El Paso. He answered: How did

"he know there had really been a kidnapping? She was the only

witness? He’d have to have “proof? before he did anything.

For ten hours nothing more was heard of Minor and Levinson.

In the morning, Sheriff D. Roberts said it was “a funny case”
and sent out a searching party——in the direction opposite to that
which the kidnappers’ cars had taken.

But in the meanwhile, the friends of the Gallup miners, all
over the country, roused by the news of the kidnapping, were not
idle. Never before in America was such a protest movement organ-
ized in such a short time as on May 3, 1935. Workers’ organiza-
tions, informed by the I.L.D. and through the press of the
kidnapping, kept the telegraph wires to Santa Fe and to Washing-
ton burning. Lawyers, liberals, intellectuals, outraged by the Gallup
violence, joined in. So great was the protest that a demand was
made on the ﬂoor of the house of representatives for a federal
investigation of the terror in New Mexico. Senators, deluged with

4

2

demands for federal action, stirred the Department of Justice into
gestures of action. Governor Tingley, astonished and impressed
by the nation-wide solidarity, ordered airplanes to search the desert.

tNo longer in a position to continue their denial, state police officially

admitted the kidnapping was “genuine.”
Let Attorney Levinson tell in his own words what happened in
the meanwhile to himself and Minor:

“I lost consciousness and when I came to was again beaten (in
the car) and remained unconscious until shortly before the conclu-
sion of the ride. I was then beaten on the head, dragged out and
thrown on the ground, bleeding profusely, kicked on the knees and
left again.

“I heard Minor asking for his fountain pen. ‘You won’t need it
in hell,’ they told him. I could not see him. A hood was placed over
my head. I was sure they were going to hang us. I was dragged into
an upright position and asked if I had anything to say.

“I told them I was always the workingman’s lawyer and came
out here atthe request of the International Labor Defense to accept
conductiof the case as chief counsel for forty-eight working men and
women, faced with ﬁrst-degree murder charges, whom I believed in-
nocent, and that my purpose in Gallup was to ﬁght for their con-
stitutional rights.

“Some one yelled ‘We don’t want speeches.’ I continued and was
knocked to the ground. My pockets were riﬂed of all contents, but
my money was returned. Then the apparent leader shouted, ‘Get
out of here and stay out of here, and if you come back, we will

kill you.”

Levinson and Minor helped each other untie the sacks that
had been put over their heads. The sacks were soaked with blood.
They saw the lights of several cars disappear over the desert.
Bruised and beaten, they began to walk.

A heavy rainstorm—the kind of cloudburst that only the desert
knows——descended upon them, turning the ground under their feet
to slushy mud. With two short rests in uninhabited huts, they
walked over the desert until almost noon—for twelve hours—before

they found the hut of a Navajo Indian, who gave them blankets
5

   

to wraparound them, and helped them get to Indian Hospital, at
Tohatchi, New Mexico.

In the hospital, they rested.

Over the wires ﬂashed the message that Minor and Levinson
were safe.
‘‘We’re going back to Gallup to ﬁnish our work of organizing

. the defense of the Gallup miners,” they announced.

Governor Tingley, pressed by the Hood of protest, furnished
them with a police escort. They were back at their labors the
same day.

Assistant District Attorney C. R. McIntosh, of Gallup, opened
what he called an "inquiry.” His idea of an inquiry was to sit and
insult the victims of the kidnapping. Anything to protect the law-
lessness of the “law”, which was obviously directly involved in the
abduction of a defense lawyer and the head of a defense com-
mittee, across a state boundary. When Minor protested against
his tactics, he declared the "incident closed.”

That much for Gallup "law.”

As Minor told McIntosh, “The kidnappers are safe in your
hands.”

It was in this way that the forces of violence of Gallup brought
before the people of America what the whole capitalist press had
tried for nearly a month to hide. In their conﬁdence, bred of this

silence of the press of the country as a whole together with the

lynch-incitement of the local papers, they eagerly sought to "cinch”
their legal lynching against the ten Gallup miners by "frightening
away” the forces of defense. The forces of the working-class de-
fense, however, have a habit of not being frightened away.‘

Chapter II. The Story Behind

The story behind the Gallup kidnapping—a true epic of work-
ing-class struggle, goes back deep into the history of corruption

 

 

»

and inhuman exploitation by American capitalism. The latest

0 episode opened on April 4 of this year, but to understand it prop-

erly we must go back to August, 1933, when the miners of Gallup
went out on strike for living-wages and recognition of their union.

The Gallup-American Coal Company, a Morgan-controlled
corporation, and Governor Arthur Seligman (now dead) lost no
time in calling out the troops and declaring martial law.’ Their
first move ended unhappily. The National Guardsmen they
brought in were local boys. They refused to ﬁre on the miners, and
had to be sent home. The next batch of troops was recruited among
the more strong-backed and weak-minded of the athletes gracing
the state-endowed schools, and proved more trustworthy and con-
veniently nervous. The terror was on. Wholesale arrests were
made, of men and women, by the soldiers. Scores were shut up in
the local stockade. The miners stubbornly refused to go to work.
They refused to stop picketing. Their women-folk relieved them
onthe picket-line. The troops’ charged on men and women alike
,with bayonets. Scores were wounded. Hundreds were gassed. A
scab agent in the form of a U.M.W.A. oﬂicial, under the eyes and
protection of the soldiers, drove slowly past the picket-line, squirt-
ing acid into the eyes of the women pickets.

When Martha Roberts, one of the women strike leaders—the
local press called her an "outside agitator”—was arrested, 2,000
school-children went on strike, and picketed the jail in mass for-
mation, demanding her release.

Drumhead court-martials were organized—under no authority
of law and in direct violation of the constitution——and strike lead-
ers were sentenced by them to long terms in jail. The strike con-
tinued, more militant than ever, with added demands——the freedom
of those imprisoned, and withdrawal of the sentences against them.

The Gallup miners won one of the most heroic battles of
American labor history. Not a striker or strike leader was in jail
when they went back to work.

Chapter III. Gamerco Plots Murder

Gradually, through shiftings and maneuverings, over the last
14 months, the Gamerco (Gallup-American Coal Company), laid
off and never re-hired, many of the most militant leaders of that
strike. They were blacklisted. The company was not satisﬁed.
They wanted to persecute and drive these men out of town. The
spread-the-hunger stagger system with which they tried to mask
their exploitattion would only work so far and no farther. In
February, for example, according to government ﬁgures, employ-
ment of bituminous coal miners in New Mexico rose 1.5 per cent
over employment for January, but at the same time, the total
amount of wages dropped by 6.2 per cent. They knew they couldn’t
get away with it forever, and were determined to rid themselves of
the leaders of the miners, whether employed or unemployed.

Years ago, the miners of Gallup, out of their meager savings,
and usually with their own labor, erected homes on a tract of land,
title to which is still in doubt, which grew to be a suburb of Gallup,
known as Chihuahuita. Among these were many of the leaders of
the 1933 strike. Horace Moses, local head of Gamerco, claimed
title to the land on behalf of his co-mpany and the Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York. The miners had been
paying rent. He evolved a scheme to get rid of them.

These corporations transferred whatever interest they may have

had in the land to a dummy, State Senator Clarence Vogel, local
junk dealer and politician, who served notice on thevminers that
they must either buy the land their houses stood on at fantastic
prices, or get out. The miners refused, and he brought eviction
suits against them.
The inhabitants of Chihuahuita organized to resist the evictions.
The first to be evicted was Victor Campos. His neighbors tore

8

M3

down the boards that had been nailed over his door, and put his
furniture in again.

Next day, Campos, his wife, and a neighbor, Exiquio Navarro,
a U.M.W.A. inember and a militant ﬁghter during and since the
1933 strike, were arrested, charged with breaking and entering into
the house.

On April 4, they came up for trial.

Schooled by the experiences of the terror during the 1933
strike, the workers of Gallup formed a strong I.L.D. branch, and
they organized a «militant working-class defense. A hundred or
more miners appeared to pack the court at the hearing. They found
the door locked" in their faces.

Inside, Campos, seeing the room empty of all but thugs and
politicians, demanded an adjournment until the I.L.D. could get
him a lawyer. The militant demonstration impressed Justice of
the Peace William Bickell, and he granted the adjournment. What
happened next has not yet been fully clariﬁed. Most of the de-
fense testimony is being withheld to prevent the authorities from
perfecting their frame-up. But the following facts are known.

S_heriff M. R. Carmichael started to take his prisoners out the
back way, and the crowd ran around the building to greet the
prisoners, and to ﬁnd out what had happened in that unconstitu-
tionally closed courtroom. Carmichael was boiling mad at the
display of solidarity. He gave a crisp order, and his deputies laid
down a barrage of tear-gas. The crowd backed away. The sheriff
and his deputies ran down, helter-skelter. They opened fire on the
tear-gas-blinded workers.

When the gas blew away, Ignacio Velarde lay dead in a pool
of blood, and three miners and a woman wounded. Sheriff Car-
michael, caught in the cross-fire from his own deputies, was dead.
Two deputies were wounded.

. Salomon Esquibel, one of the wounded miners, died in the
hospital eight days later, on April 12.

Chief Deputy D. Roberts, who stepped into Cartnichael’s shoes,

boasted that he had shot point-blank at Esquibel as he stood facing
