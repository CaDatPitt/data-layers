right and has embarked on a campaign of anti-Semitism. It began with
the New York Times.

The Times started early in the year to run occasional articles by
one Harry Schwartz, a rofessor at S racuse University who purports
to be an expert on Sovietpaffairs. Schwalitz wrote pieces for the Times on
the Soviet press campaign against “cosmopolitanism,”- emphasizing that
many Jews were under attack but not speciﬁcally alleging an_ti-Semitism,
and on recent Soviet criticisms of the government of Israel for sub-
servience to “U. S. imperialism,” hinting that these attacks were anti-
Semitic but not saying so outright.

There was a plausible ring to Schwartz’s stories, which were appar-
ently based on ﬁrst-hand research in source material. And to many who
saw no_essential anti-Semitism in political polemics against “cosmopoli-
tanism,” or in criticism of Zionism or the government of Israel, there was
nevertheless what appeared to be indisputable proof of Soviet Jew-baiting
in this paragraph of Schwartz’s story in the Times of April 20 :-

“. . . Observers of the Soviet press have noted that the_cartoon cam-
paign against ‘cosmopolitanism’ in Krokodil, the lavishly illustrated
Soviet humor publication. has been marked by the use of hooked noses on
the ﬁgures used to represent ‘cosmopolitanism.’ One cartoon on the
grant page of Krokodil juxtaposes the name Lippmann-—which is usually

ewish in the Soviet Union—with the word ‘Zhid,’ a derisive Russian
term for Jews used by Russian-speaking anti-Semites.”

The merit of this extraordinary piece of scholarly research can be
judged from the Krokodil cartoons reprinted on page 12. One of the
cartoons—drawn by a Jew, Boris Efeimov——caricatures “cosmopolitan-
ists” as birds of prey with long predatory beaks, not as Jews with
hooked noses. i

The cover cartoon depicts an unpleasant ﬁgure (who has no simi-
larity to Jewish stereotypes), carrying a suitcase on which appears the
word “Zhid.” But right before the “Zhid” is the word “Andre.” Other
names on the suitcase, besides that of Andre Gide, are Andre Malraux,
Jean Paul Sartre, Somerset Maugham, D. Grillith and Lip mann. .Grifﬁth
is presumably D. W. Griffith, anathematized in the U.S.S.l){. for his anti-
Negro ﬁlm “The Birth of a Nation.” Lippmann is presumably Walter
Lippmann. . -

There is obviously no juxtaposition of “Zhid” and "Lippmann” ex-
cept that Andre Gide’s and Walter Lippmann’s names were near each
other on the suitcase. '

The cartoon, is, if anything, intrinsic evidence that the campaign
against “cosmopolitans” is not directed againsttJeWs as such. The cap-
tion reads “Pitiful and unpleasant are the quiet skeptics, the abstract
persons, the passportless vagabonds of the human race.” An effort has
been made in the Times, Post Home News, World-Telegram and News-
week to show that the Russians use “passportless Vagabond” and “home-
less cosmopolitan” to sneer, at-Jews; but here the wordssdescribe an
assortment of writers from various countries, all but one of whom’ are
non-Jewish. i ’ J ~ % ‘

Six days later the Times carried a three-paragraph story at the bot-
tom of its book page, admitting no error and indicating ‘no’ regret, but
merely stating: “It has been pointed out that the ‘Zhid’ as used in the

"cartoon is the Russian transliteration for the last name of Andre Gide,
French author. whose first name also appears in the cartoon.”

Newsweek reprinted the Krokodil cartoon in its May 2 issue, under
the headline: “Poison in Pen and Ink: The Soviet Anti-Semitic Cam-
paign.” It did not, however, make a point of the “Zhid.”

‘Frederick iWoltman, in his}World-Telegram series, apparently felt
the “Zhid” point was too neat to abandon. So he developed?-a new angle,
in his May 18 article: ’ G *

“In a blast at the ‘cosmopolitan literary critics’ the ‘March 20 issue
(of Krokodil) ran a full-page ‘caricature of one, wearing ‘a dagger in his
belt and carrying an enormouslpoison pen. A name tag pasted on his
suitcase read, ‘Andre Zhid,’ This presumably referred to Andre-Cide, the
French writer who is 'unpiubl_ishe‘d and virtually unknown’ in Russia. _

“However, the ‘Andre’ was‘ shaded and the ‘Zhid’l'ca'ugl'1t the eye.
‘Zhid,’ a favorite expression in pogrom literature of Czarist Russia, is
familiar to all Russians. The translation is the viciously slanderouspword
‘kike.’ A.  - ' ‘

The reproduction of the cartoon on page 12. photographed from the
‘original by THE DAILY: COMPASS, shows no shading of the “Andre.” It
is as clear as the “Gide.” ' ' .

However, as reproduced in Newsweek May 2, the “Andre” was shaded
almost to the point of obliteration, and the “Zhid” seemed to stand alone.
p Whether this was Newsweek’s accident or Newsweek’s design cannot
be established. Nor is it known whether Woltman, in presenting this
particular absurdity, was just a knave, or also ‘a fool. "

Unimportant in itself, but signiﬁcant -for the light it throws on
Woltman’s reliability, is his statement that Andre Gide is “unpublished
and virtually unknown -inithe Soviet Union.” As a matter of fact Gide has
been one of the best-known French authors in the U.Sv.S.R. In the early
305 he was considered a great friend; he toured the Soviet Union with
much fanfare in the Soviet press; and since he began to attack the
Soviet Union he has been the object of reams of criticism. Not only have
numerous Soviet periodicals published his material, but three volumes of
his collected works and his “Travels in the Congo” were published in
book form in Russian translation.

It is the technique of the newspapers and magazines perpetrating the
hoax of “Sov‘iiet'an_ti-Semi»tism” toequate anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.
The headlines charge. that the Russians are persecuting Jews as a people;
the stories under the headlines prove that the Russians are opposing Zion»
ism as a political theory. - ‘

Whether the Russian attitude toward Zionism is right or wrong,
good or evil, smart or stupid, is a matter of opinion. But tosuggest that
the attitude is motivated by bias agains Jews as a people. is sheer fraud.

Much has been made, in Frederick Woltman’s series in the‘ World-
Telegram -and in Harry Schwartz’s articles in the New York Times, of an
alleged change in the Soviet line on Zi‘onism signalized by an article in
Pravda by Ilya Ehrenburg last Sept. 21. Sentences and phrases have
been quoted from that article which, out of context, seem to imply racial-
ism in the'Soviet position on the political question of Zionism.

Let us accept the thesis that this article is one of vast importance,
and, like the famed Duclos letter, lays down an ollicial line for the Soviet
Union, for her satellite nations, and forlall Communists everywhere. Let
us agree that this is the precise present statement of the Communist posi-
tion on the Jewish question, and that everyone in the Soviet Union must
conform to it.

The first thing to note in connection with the article is that its author,
Ehrenburg, is a Jew. He is not in exile, or being persecuted, but on the
contrary, is in high. favor and writing important articles for the oliicial
Soviet press. This would seem to negate the claim that Jews are being
eliminated from Soviet intellectual life just because they are Jews.

The second thing to note is that the article not only is not anti-
Semitic, but is on the contrary a passionate and eloquent attack on anti-
Semitism.

‘ The article begins with a long quotation of a letter from a young

‘German Jew, troubled by the resurgence of Nazism and anti-Semitism in

the American zone of Germany. He writes to ask if perhaps Israel is not
“the solution to the so-called Jewish question.”

Ehrenburg’s Reply

Ehrenburg, in reply, ﬁrst states the Soviet position on Israel:

“The Soviet government. was the first to recognize the new state, it
protested energetically against the aggressors, and when the armies of
Israel fought to defend their land from the Arab Legionnaires command-
ed by British oﬂicers, the sympathies of our people were all for the
wronged, not for the wrong-doers. . . . I

“The representatives of the Soviet Union in the United Nations have
said that our people understand the feelings of the Jews who have exper-
ienced the greatest tragedy and have at last obtained the right to exist in
their own land. Wishing the toilers of Israel success, Soviet people do
not close their eyes to the trials in store for all honest people in the young
state.” « ‘ I

Ehrenburg goes on to declare that Israel is threatened “not only by
King Abdullah’s cutthroats” but by Anglo-American imperialism. He
says that the government of Israel represents the bourgeoisie rather than
the working class, and that the Israel bourgeoisie is no different from any
other. He further declares that “although I believe in the future of Israel”

[13]

he does not believe that it holds the ultimate answer to “the Jewish
question.” * ,

“I know,” he says, “that the solution of the ‘Jewish question’ does
not depend on military successes in Palestine but on thevictory of social-
ism over capitalism, -on the triumph of the lofty international principles
inherent in the working class over nationalism, fascism and racism.”

Then he discusses what “the Jewish question” 'is. Because an effort
has been made to twist this into proof of official Soviet anti-Semitism, it
is desirable to quote Ehrenburg’s words at some length.

». “Obscurantists,” he writes, “have since long ago invented fables de-
signed to represent the Jews as some peculiar creatures different from the
people around them. ,

“Obscurantists have maintained that the Jews live a separate life of
their own, that they doinot share the joys and sorrows of the people
among whom they live; obscurantists have asserted that the Jews have no
sense of country, that they are eternal wanderers; obscurantists have af-
firmed that the Jews of various countries are a unit, held together by some
mysterious ties. A I

“All these inventions found their extreme expression in Hit1er’s foul
book, Mein Kampf, and were repeated by the SS-men who buried old Jews
alive and flung Jewish infants down steep banks and into furnaces.

“Yes, the Jews. kept to themselves and lived their own separate lives
when they were compelled to do so. The ghetto was not invented by
Jewish mystics. but by Catholic fanatics. In those times, when the eyes of
people were blinded by the mist of religion, there were, fanatics among
the Jews just as there were fanatics among Catholics, Protestants, Ortho-
dox Christians and Moslems. But as soon as the gates of the ghetto
opened, as soon as the mist of the night of the Middle Ages began to lift,
the Jews of. various countries joined thegeneral life of the nations . . .

“Jews live in different countries. Many of them live in lands in which
their ancestors lived since time immemorial . . . Obscurantists say there
exists some mystical bond between a Tunisian Jew and a Jew living in
Chicago, who speaks American and thinks American. If there is any bond
between them. it is anything but mystical; it is a bond created by anti-
Semitism. ' ,

“If tomorrow a maniac appeared who‘ proclaimed that all red-headed
or snub-nosed people must be hounded and wiped out, we should see a
natural solidarity of all red-headedor snub-nosed people.

Insults and Furnaces

“The appalling atrocities of the" German fascists. their proclaimed
policy of wholesale extermination of Jews, a policy which they put into
effect in many countries, racial propaganda, insults followed by the fur-
naces of Maidanek—all that gave rise to a sense of a deep bond among
the Jews of various countries. It was the solidarity of offended and indig-
nant people. . . .

“Of course, there are nationalists and mystics among Jews. They pro-
duce the program of Zionism. But it is not they who have settled Pales-
tine with Jews. Jews went to Palestine because of the ideologists of mis-
anthropy, the votaries of racism, the anti-Semites who drove people from

their homes and made them migrate to_distant lands in search—notof
happiness so much as of the right to their human dignity.”

Ehrenburg goes on to describe the change in the position of Jews
in Poland, Bulgaria and other Eastern European countries since the war,
their full citizenship and participation in the life of the country under the
new governments of Poland, Bulgaria, etc. He describes the anti-Semitism
of Czarist Russia, and the integration of Jews into Soviet life after the
revolution. He quotes Gorki, Lenin, Stalin in castigations of anti-Semitism.

h “‘I‘The1I'p is only o’n’e,~way to solve ‘the Jewish question.’ It is to abolish‘
t e ewis question. '

Socialism, he says, is the only system which does that.

“We sympathize with the struggle of the toilers of Israel. They have
the sympathies not Only of the Soviet Jews, but of all Soviet people—-
there are no admirers of Clubb-Pasha in our country. s ~

“But every Soviet citizen is aware that a state is judged not only by
its national character, but by its social system as well. A citizen of a so-
cialist coun-try regards the people of any bourgeois country, and that
means also the people of the State of Israel, as Wanderers in a dark forest
who have not yet found their way out.” A

One need not agree with Ehrenburg that socialism is the answer to
the Jewish question, nor that Israel would be better off with a socialist
government, nor that Jews in Eastern European countries are better ad-
vised to stayithere than to emigrate to Israel. Those are political ques-
tions. ‘ p ' A '

But to read into this eloquent condemnation of all racism proof that
the Soviet government has embarked on a new official campaign of anti-
Semitism as the World-Telegram and other publications have done, borders
on lunacy. ' ’ '

One of themain props of the theory that the Soviet Union has adopt-
ed apolicy of anti-Semitism is the argument that Jewish religious and
cultural life have “disintegrated” in the U.S.S.R. A I

This argument was stressed by the American Jewish Committee in its
release to the press of a summary of a study of “Jews Behind the Iron
Curtain.” I It has been treated at length in the pamphlet “Soviet Russia

and the Jews,” published by the American JewishLeague Against Com-
- munism. It has been a major thesis of the articlesby Frederick Woltman

in the World-Telegram, which declare ﬂatly that the Soviet government’
is pursuing a policy of “Nazi-like anti-Semitism.” I V

The exact extent to which Jewish religious. cultural and communal‘
life have “disintegrated” in the Soviet Union and are disintegrating in
Eastern European countries of the Soviet orbit” is a matter of great con-
t-‘r’-oversv. The I-charges made by the American Jewish Committee'an=d the
World-Telegram would lead the ‘casual reader to the conclusion thatiin
'the“U.S.S.-R; the synagogues have been closed and the YidAdish“1‘angua'ge
forbidden. But the Israeli representative in Moscow recently spoke"of-‘t«h‘e
large crowds of . Jews attending synaggue worship there;1 and Pravda of
May 19 devotes considerable space to listing the current repertory -of the
Yiddish Art Theater. * i i A -  ‘ " '

Historic Position

. It is no secret that the Communist Party is historically irreligious and
anti-religious. Marx’s dictum that “religion is the opium of the people”
has not been ‘discarded. The Communist philosophy is materialist and
atheist. Thesoviet state has always opposed Judaism, Mohammedanism,
Lutheranism, Buddhism. The American Jewish Committee is no doubt
justiﬂediin saying the Jewish religion “has come under the same Soviet
anathema as all other religions.” i

This may be a very bad thing; but is it anti-Semiitsm?

Woltman declares that it is. After quoting the American Jewish Com-
mittee as saying “USSR Jews are now in an advanced stage of religious
and cultural disintegration,” heeconcludes from that: A

' “Thus, the motherland of Communism-——held up to the world as the
very model of racial equality, respecting the’ diverse nationalities within
its borders—-—has put Russia’s Jews beyond the pale.”

Elsewherehe notes that “today, in true totalitarian kinship, ‘the plow- ‘

ers in the Kremlin. plagiarize the Nazis,” and that “The USSR’s success
in wiping out Zionism is matched only by the extermination of all things
Jewish by Hitler’s Germany.” .

A Jewish Report

In support of his assertion that “the motherland of -Communism has
put Russia’s Jews beyond the pale,” Woltman quotes B. Z. Goldberg, a
columnist for The Day, a New York Yiddish-language newspaper. He says
that “Probably no better authority could be found” than Goldberg, be-
cause the columnist is “himself a Soviet sympathizer.”

Quite out of context, he selects these sentences from two newspaper
columns written by Goldberg in 1946 during and after a six-months’ trip
to the U.S.S.R.: A

“There are no Jewish districts in the cities and towns. There are no
speciﬁcally Jewish occupations. There are no Jewish hospitals, no Jewish
old folks’ homes, no Jewish parties, no Jewish philanthropies, no Jewish
educational insitutions.”

“There are a quarter of a million Jews in Moscow, and perhaps more,
but it is diﬂicult to reach them. The Jews have no special social sphere,
special charitable organizations, clubs or those hundreds of other Jewish
community societies which Jews of other countries have. Jewish education
has virtually disappeared.”

In a Nutshell

To paraphrase the argument:

1. -Russia is anti-Semitic because she. does not ‘force Jews to live in
ghettaes, and the Jews choose not to live in ghettoes, but on the contrary
mix equally with all the population, without distinction as to race or
religion.

2. Russia is anti-Semitic because she does not force Jews into certain
occupations by eliminating them from others. On the contrary, all ﬁelds
of endeavor are open to Jews, as much as to anyone else.

3. Russia is anti-Semitic because she does not bar Jews from partici-
pation with others in social activities, clubs, etc., and so the Jews have
become integrated into the social, fraternal, political, educational and
charitable institutions of the country as a whole. '

A The converse of this argument is that the freedom of the U. S. from
any taint of anti-Semitism is proved by the fact that Jews are generally

-barred from the principal college fraternities, and so have organized Jew-

ish fraternities of their own; that they are barred by restrictive covenants
and other devices from living in many areas, and so have developed all-
Jewish neighborhoods; that they cannot in many cases join country clubs
or athletic clubs because they _are Jews,,so have organized their own
country and athletic clubs.

Q. E. D.

Woltman’s argument boils down to this simple proposition: it is anti-
Semitic not to discriminate against Jews, but to treat them like all other
citizens.

And, if one asserts that the greatest good for all Jewseverywhere is
to think of themselves as Jews, and that the greatest help in producing
this feeling of universal kinship is discrimination and persecution, per-
haps the argument can be tortured into the appearance of some validity.

But it is diflicult to see how the Soviet approach and the Hitler ap-
proachwere identical, as Woltman claims. He cannot have it both ways.
Hitler forced the assimilated German Jew to wear a yellow star and live
in a ghetto. and think of himself as an outcast because he was a Jew. Now
it is complained that Stalin is just like Hitler, because the Jew in the
Soviet Unioncis encouraged to think of himself as just another Soviet citi-

J - zen, fully and equally integrated into the social, cultural, political and

economic life of the country. C

One wonders if the wealthy, highly-assimilated Americans of the
American Jewish Committee are really willing to carry the campaign they
have started—-—to prove Soviet Russia anti~Semitic———to its conclusion in
logic, as Woltmanhas done.

To understand how it happened all of a sudden this spring that news-
papers and magazines burst out with a spate of stories purporting to prove
the existence of o'fﬁcia‘l anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, one must go
back to a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the American
Jewish Committee on May 10 and 11, 1947.

At that meeting a resolution was passed instructing the staﬂ" to “direct
its efforts to combat the attempts of reactionary and Communistic-minded
groups alike falsely and viciously to identify Jews and Communistsf’

The implementation of this directive became a major concern of the A

Committee. At a time when the State of Israel was struggling to be born,
when the de-Naziﬁcation of Germany was clearly failing and anti-Semi-
tism was resurgent, the Committee focused its attention and energies on
combattingvthe public identification of Jews and Communists.

The identification is not a signiﬁcant source of anti-Semitism, as
studies conducted by the American Jewish Committee itself, as Well as
other organizations, show. For example, the Spring, .1949, issue of Public

Opinion Quarterly reports a study made in Denver by the,iUniversity of
Denver Opinion Research Center in cooperation with the_VAnti-Defamation

ferent” from iotherpeople in some way other than .their're,l,igion.g {But of
all the unfavorable stereotypes, the identiﬁcation of Jews as radicals was
least important. Whereas 12'per cent saidJews w’ere',‘clanniish,” 11 per

Secret Memorandum

However, the special‘ anxiety of“ the American Jewish Committee to

dissociate Jews from Communism in the public mind, despite theinfre-'

quency, of ‘that association and its unimportance inrelation to anti-Semitic

' prejudice, is understandable.

The Committee is composed (of and speaks for the wealthiest and
‘most -conservative segment of American Jewry. Its president, Jacob Blau-
stein, is head of American Oil‘ Co.‘ (Amocoproducts). Its honorary presi-
dent, i_Joseph Proskauer, who recently appeared‘ as attorney" for the
Arabian-American Oil Co., was one of the founders of the Liberty League.

At the same time its staff has in recent years become a haven for dissident-

radicals and ex-radicals, many of them closely associated with the Trot-
skyist wing of thelanti-Communist left- _ J p i
' J A secret memorandum, titled “Background Memorandum No. 2—The

“Communist Problem 'as._It,Aii‘ects"American Jews,” was distributed last
April to members of the ‘National Executive Committee of the AJC byiDr.

John Slawson, executive vice-president. A copy of it is in the possession
of the COMPASS” It notes that following the d-irectiive of May, 1947,’ there
was “most careful ‘delib'eration” on how to implement 'it._ C it A
“Numerous procedures were suggested and rejected before a consen-
sus was reached that the most constructive project we could undertake in
this context would be an educational program designed to acquaint Amer-
ican Jews with the facts concerning Jews and Communism, and especially
the realities of Jewish life in Communist countries. ~ , * A ‘-
“Underlying this recommendation was the conviction that the. most
effective method of dissociating -Jews from Communism is for Jews to as-

sert. their opposition. to »Communisrn.—”

Emotional Conflict

. The memorandum went on to note that although m‘ost;\American Jews
were anti-Communist, “many have been influenced by the propaganda
disseminated by American Communists to the effect that the Soviet regime
haseradi-cated anti-Semitism and beneﬁted Jews living under Commun-
ism’. ‘This has produced‘ an emotional conflict, ‘which’ makes many Jews,

J although“ antagonistic to- Communism, diﬂident about speaking out against

Communism.
“If the facts about the realities of Jewish life in Iron Curtain coun-
tries were morewidely known to American Jews, it was believed that this

“conflict would disappear.

v-——?~——-—-:9

f‘No authoritative body of material on this subject being‘ available, it
became apparent that a comprehensive research project would ‘be needed,
and the Library of Jewishlnformation (an American Jewish Committee
department) was asked to consider such a project.”

Careful reading of the above makes it plain:

1. That the research project was not conceived as an’ impartial study,‘

but as a means “of collecting whatever material might be useful to propa-
gandize against_Soviet Russia and Communism among American Jews.

,2. That it was recognized that there was “no authoritative body of
material” proving the point desired to be proved. But the conclusions of
the study to be made were assumed in advance. 1 1

3. That while the 1947 directive of the Executive Committee instruct-..
ed the staff to combat the identiﬁcation of Jews and Communists in the
public mind, the staff had already remolded the directive into an order
to_ combat pro-Russian or pro-Communist sympathies among American
Jews. - .

» Approved by Committee 1

The research project was approved by the lay advisory committee ‘of:
the Library in February, 1948, and placed in charge of a subcommittee
0 three. V ' '

, The members of; that committee were Dr. Nathan Reich, head of the
economics department at Hunter College; Dr. Salo Baron, chairman of
the Library Cominitttee of A] C, and Herbert Solow, an editor _of Fortune.

Solow, like Whittaker Chambers a -disillu_sioned ex-radical who found
a spiritual and ﬁnancial haven with the Luce publications, was akey
ﬁgurein the selectionof the staff to conduct the research project. Prior‘
to the 1934» ‘_‘.purge” of Trotskyites by the Communist Party, he had. been
active in various “Communist front” organizations, Afterward he worked.
with Trotsky in Mexico, and was a frequent contributor of articles to

publications representing the Troskyist view among the various splinters

and sects of the left. .

His wide acquaintance among fanatically anti-Soviet. writers and
pamphleteers proved helpful in selecting a special staff to do the job the
American Jewish Committee wanted done. ~ 1 1 . as »

The principal “expe-rt”.= hired was Dr‘. Solomon ‘M; Schwartz, a form-

er‘ member of the Kerenskybabinet in Russia, who was expelled from that-

country in 1921, lived in Germany until 1933 and France until 1941, when
he came to the U. S. He has ‘devoted himself while here»larg'el1y‘to writ-
ing for a Russian-language monthly, Socialistichesky Viestnik,swhicl1 is
published in the ollices of the New Leader and constantly beats the drums
for 3 Preventive war with the Soviet Union. 1 ' * «' '  t ‘ , * “ 1

Schwartz is one of the so-called “Forward Group,” cen_tered,around
the Jewish Daily Forward, the Jewish Labor Committee, the New Leader,
and the Central Committee for Jewish Culture. Some of them are emigres

who hope for a return to power in Russia if Stalin is over-thrown in a.

war; some of them are old-line Social Democratic union lead'ers,'like
David Dubinsky, whose leadership has from time to, time been threatened
by the Communists; others aremerely bitter and Afrustrapted ex-Commung

ists. All of them share a single obsession: to oppose, denounce and dis-
credit the Soviet Union at every turn and in every breath.

Two others associated with this group got on the AJC payroll for
this study: Dr. Bernard D. Weinryb, professor of social studies at Yeshiva
University, and Will Herberg, educational director of the Dressmakers
Local of Dubi,nsky’s International Ladies Garment Workers Union. The
other three of _the six persons selected by Solow and his committee for
employment on the project are less well-known. All three of them are
anti-Communist emigres from Eastern Europe———Dr. A. R. L. Gurland ‘from
Russia, Joseph Gordon from Czechoslovakia, and Joseph Ofman from

Poland.
Other Studies

Two other members of the “Forward Group” were not put on the AJ C
payroll but collaborated with Schwartz et al and simultaneously produced,
under other titular sponsorship, similar “studies.”

Emmanuel Pat, a former member of the Bund, the Jewish Socialist
Labor party in pre-revolutionary Russia, produced the report on “Jews
Behind the Iron Curtain” which was presented at the convention of the
Jewish Labor Committee last Feb. 24 in Atlantic City, and subsequently
published. 

Gregor Aronson, another emigre of the “Forward Group” and collab-
orator with Schwartz, produced for the American Jewish League Against
Communism a lengthy pamphlet, entitled “Soviet Russia and the Jews,”
which was distributed to newspapers in galley proof on May 18. The
League is run by Rabbi Benjamin Schultz, who was ousted by his congre-
gation in Yonkersin 1946‘ for indiscriminate red-baiting and has since
become the darling of the Journal-American and the World-Telegram. On
Schultz’s sponsoring board are such names as George Sokolsky, Isaac
Don Levine, Eugene Lyons, Morrie Ryskind and Rep. Abraham Multer
(D.-Bklyn.). Aronson, a member of the Moscow Soviet in 1920, was ar-

‘rested in 1921 and expelled from the U.S.S.R. in.1922. He came to the

U. S. in 1940.

(It is interesting to note that'Aronson, upon whom Frederick Wolt-
man relied for much of the material upon which he based his World-
Telegram series, accuses the Russians not of anti-Semitism but of “asemi-
tism,” which he deﬁnes as “characterized by indifference to the Jews and
any matter in which they, as Jews, are involved.” His pamphlet proves
laboriously and conclusively that (a) the Nazis killed a lot of Jews in
occupied Russia, (b) the Communists oppose Zionism, and (c) Stalin is
an ‘‘assimilationist.’’) \

Project Gets Under Way

With the motives, direction and staff as outlined above, the AJC’s
research project got under way in February, 1948. A’ year later, as it
neared completion, the question arose as to what to do with it. The mat-
ter was taken up at the February, 194-9, meeting of the Administrative
Committee, top policy body, but put over until March.

On March 8 the Administrative Committee met at the Harmonie Club,
with Victor 5. Riesenfeld presiding. Jacob Blaustein, president, and Irving

£201

 

 

M. Engel, chairman of the Executive Committee, were among the 25 mem-
bers of the Administrative Committee present. The DAILY COMPASS has
a copy of the minutes of that meeting. _

Slawson, the executive director, reviewed the history of the project
and the reasoning behind it, declaring that “segments of American Jewry
have been misled into the belief that the U.S.S.R. and other Communist
countries are free of anti-Semitism,” that “this false impression” produces
“a diflidence in denouncing this menace.”

Professor Reich then outlined the subject matter of the studies, em-
phasizing that the monographs were in various stages of work and that
this was an interim report. .

“The members of the administrative committee,” the minutes read,
“followed Dr. Reich’s report with keen interest, and it was evident that
in their opinion the project was soundly conceived and, properly exploit-
ed, could have a most constructive effect. Several members agreed that
publication be expedited.”

Discussion ensued as to whether to put material out piecmeal or wait
for completion. . ‘ _ ' ‘

“Mr. Curfein (Murray I. Curfein) emphasized that the impor.tant
question was when and how to disseminate the facts collected by us. In
order to give them widest coverage he suggested that we work with the
Jewish Telegraphic Agency and through their news service in European

 capitals, which would make it possible for this material to be sent to the

American public as spot news, sponsored by the press rather than the
American Jewish Committee.”

Plan of Strategy.

This proposal that the material be “planted” with correspondents
in Europe, to be dsent out ﬁts tlheir owirn i}:1degpndent'repo}1l‘ting of Epot
news, was critic'ze on no et ica groun s; ut awson was esitant a out
endorsing it bedause the original objective was “not so much to bring the
facts to the attention of the general public, as to educate the Jewish
community.” He thought “our own strategy should be so advised as to
aim at American Jews rather than at Americans generally.”

The matter of when, how and where to plant or publish the story was

left in abeyance, for further recommendations to the steering committee.
Subsequently a memorandum was sent out to all chapters notifying them
that the subject of how to use this material would come up at the May
meeting of the national executive committee. and that delegates to that
committee should be instructed on chapter views.
' But the staff ran away with the ball. The unofficial planting of the
story had begun even before Mar. 8. Both the “experts” working on the
study and some members of the AJC library staff were eagerly dissemin-
ating the information collected, and by the end of March it was ﬁnding
its way into the New York Times and Newsweek, although in the guise of
independent reporting of spot news and not as an AJ C handout.

This process continued through April. On May 2 the AJC first Came
into the picture openly, sending out to all newspapers a six-page mimeo-
graphed release on the conclusions of its “intensive study of Jewish life
in the Soviet Union and its satellite countries.”

[21]

 

This release did not int-so many words accuse the U.S._SJR. "of an

_ official policy of anti-Semitism. That was already being charged in the

newspapers; with the spurious stories about anti-Semitic cartoons, etc;,
which have been discussed earlier in this study; ‘The American Jewish
‘Com'm—ittee~release devoted itself to proving the thesis that the “independ-
ent;religio‘us,‘cultural and"communal activities” of all churches, including
Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant and Jewishgwere being “suppressed”
(although churches and synagogues were admittedly not being closed nor
worship in them forbidden.) ‘ .. C - J ' '

The function of the AJ C release was to lend an aura of respectability

-4 and authority to the then burgeoning hoax about Soviet anti-Semitism,

without committing itself speciﬁcally to any of the more obvious. un-
‘truths. i J ’ h ’

the whole matter was to be vdiscussed and a decision on how to use the '
material reached,’ members were presented with a‘ fait accompli; -Some‘.

THE COMPASS is an independent newspaper. That is to
say, the editor is responsible to the community and his con-
science for the content of the newspaper, including the
editorials. I wear no collar but my own.

THE Compass is no successor to, no child nor stepchild
of any previous newspaper, although it shares the heritage
of the many brave attempts to establish free and inde-
pendent newspapers since this country was begun by men
who believed in freedom, debate, and decision by citizens
responsible to none but their fellows for their opinions
and their conduct.

Since the word liberal has fallen into such disrepute
through ill use and misappropriation it is probably fair to
term THE COMPASS a radical newspaper: radical in the
fashion of the crusading New York morning V\’orld, which
sought the trut h and printed what it could find of it without
fear or favor.

This will not be a baiting newspaper. We will not indulge
in baiting any person or any group, minority or majority.

The staff has been selected with care. Integrity and
craftsmanship were our only guides. My associates are free
to express their opinions and present the facts as they see
them. I will express my opinions in the editorials and in
signed articles. Contributors and staff members are under
no compulsion and no pressure to agree, or to disagree.

I shall continue to take an active and vigorous interest
in what seems to me the important issues of the day, from
the standpoint of all of us who have so much at stake in
the way the world is run, at home and away from home.

There are two stockholders, Mrs. Anita Blaine of Chicago
and I.

I own control of the voting shares partly because I
would not edit and publish THE COMPASS on other terms‘,
and partly because Mrs. Blaine would not provide major
ﬁnancial backing on any terms except the complete inde-
pendence of the newspaper and its editor from pressures.
even from her.

We shall accept advertising, without expecting too much
too soon, and provided the advertiser understands what he
is buying: space in which to tell his story to our readers . . .
and nothing more.

My policies have not changed since I left the editorship
of the New York Post Home News by request of the owner
and the directors, because I would not support the Atlantic
Pact, nor permit it to be supported by that newspapers
editorials as long as I remained its editor.

I am opposed to this country’s bipartisan foreign policy.

I am opposed to the overwhelming concentration of our
national energies in building up our military forces at the
expense of our civilian needs.

I am opposed to these things because I believe they mean
less, rather than more, democracy for the world, and a great
deal less of it here at home.

I believe they are steps toward war and away from One
World in its best and most human, as well as humane, sense.

 

     
 

 

w  1. ‘is

 T|ieEdit0r’s Creed . . ..hy Ted0.1‘hackrey

As Published in THE DAILI’ COMPASS, Volume 1, Number I on May 16, 1949

I am opposed to alliances with dictatorships such as
Franco’s in Spain, Salazar’s in Portugal, Chiang Kai-shek’s

, in China, the monarchy in Greece, the military dictatorship

in Turkey, the feudal kings of Arabia; all anti-democratic
by their very nature.

I am distressed deeply over the resurgence of uational~
istic feeling throughout the world, and particularly here
at home.

I believe it is being deliberately encouraged and fostered
by those who fear democracy, or would bend it to serve
:heir special interests.

\Vc now propose to remilitarizc all Western Europe,
meanwhile fastening the pattern of military control upon
our own people as well, to solve the housing shortage by
building barracks, the clothing problem by providing uni-
forms, the need for production of civilian goods by concen-
trating on the manufacture of arms under government con-
tract. This means death, not the expansion of democracy.

I believe the United Nations has been immeasurably
weakened, perhaps rendered useless, by a series of actions
and failures which the present Administration and its politi-
cal allies throughout the world would have you believe was
exclusively the result of Russian ‘H:l0 abuse.

I, too, believe the veto has been used unwiscly on
occasion.

But the United Nations was wrecked when the United
States stood supinely‘ by and permitted Great Britain, hcx
puppet feudal stale Transjordan, and the feudal kingdoms
of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen to make aggres-
sive war on the state of Israel, which had been crc-ated'b_v
resolution of the General Assembly. and which had to fight
alone and unaided for freedom which should haue been-
and was in fact~—guaranteed by the United States and the
very nations which made war upon her.

I am fearful even now for the fate of Israel because of a
continuation of that unholy alliance, which is imperialistic
and feudal rather than democratic in spirit and in deed.

I deplore the decision to parcel out colonial dependencies
of both the victor and the vanquished in the recent war
against fascism, among nations who will seek to build a
new imperialism from them.

The only way to have one world is to establish it.

The only way to peace is to build for it, and not against it.

]ust as the only way to safeguard democracy is to

practice it.
I We are becoming a nation which fears debate; which
would suppress opposing views rather than refute them.
which would deny democracy‘ to minority groups rather
than eradicate the bigotry and prejudice which causes
them; which speaks of civil rights and civil liberties, writes
platfomis into political parties espousing them, and per-
mits those who neither practice nor believe in democracv
to destroy them.

We shall raise our voices in controversy.

We shall support principle.

We shall make no effort to suppress the voices of our op-
ponents, but we shall insist upon being heard in turn.

me mum ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM
IN-THE SOVIET UNION  

An extraordinary anti-Semitic hoax, certainly as absurd and perhaps
as damaging as any fabrication since the Protocols of the Learned Elders
of Zion, is now running wild through the columns of the American press.
, In a series of newspaper stories which began ‘to creep into various
newspapers and magazines early in 1949, and reached their culmination
in a series of articles by Frederick Woltman in the World-Telegram,,it has
been “revealed” that anti-Semitism has become an olficial policy of the
government of the Soviet Union.

The evidence in support of this “revelation,” which will be examined
in detail here. is self-refuting. The trickery and distortion with which the
alleged proofs were presented write a new chapter in the history of irre-
sponsible journalism. V

The hoax was inspired and planted by the American Jewish‘ Com-
mittee, a small, immensely wealthy and immensely powerful organization
of the top economic segment of American Jewry.

Manyresponsible Jewish leaders——including some members of the
executive committee of the American Jewish Committee——are aghast at
the results of what was at first conceived to be a clever trick to alienate
Americans from any sympathy with the U.S.S.R.

Feeds Jewbaiters

They are aghast simply because.the hoax gives new material to the
professional Jewbaiters and reinforces old anti-Semitic concepts latent
in the minds of many Americans. '

These reactions to the story among non-Jews have bqomeranged to
the American Jewish Committee: J

1. “See, this proves the Jews are impossible to get along with any-
where. Even the Russians, who tried to give the Jews a break, ﬁnally
found out that Hitler was right about them.” .

2. “The Jews are always whining about being persecuted. When-
ever a Jew is criticized for anything at all, even in Russia, heclaims it’s

anti-Semitism.”

3. “You’d think the Jews would be grateful because the Russian
Communists stopped pogroms and made an~ti—Semitism a crime. They
just haven’t any gratitude. They aren’t satisfied unless you turn your
whole country over to them.”

These reactions, it must be emphasized, are not the reactions of in-
telligent non-Jews to the facts, but of unthinking persons, already preju-

[5]

 
   

diced tola greater or lesser degree, to the material which has been pre-
sented. in the press. _
The American Jewish Committee not only supplied a great deal of

that material, directly or indirectly, but continues to endorse the manner
in which it has been used.

“It doesnot single out Jews, or a section of Jews, as its special tar-

about Communistic anti-Semitism are not only confusing theissue, but
are doing the cause of the Jews and of Israel an incalculable harm.

' “The morbid, masochistic desire on‘ the part of-some Jews to see
anti-Semitism everywhere may lead to real anti-Semitism whereuthere is
noneiat present.” . s . s i ;

The charges of Soviet and Eastern European ofﬁcial anti-Semitisin
have been made chiefly in the New York Times, the New York Post Home
Newsand Newsweek, besides the World-Telegram. . J y

_ l._The great postwar hoax_—the claimthat anti-Semitism has become
the state policy of Russia and her satellites—was introduced to thegU.‘S.
general public on March 31. ' s ' A ‘ “

On that day Newsweek magazine hit the stands‘ with a featured article

by Edward Weintal, its “diplomatic correspondent,” or State Dept.‘ man.
Newsweekgave itaspecial introduction: E J J W
“A~widespread oﬁicial anti-Semitic campaign clearly emerged ‘for
the ﬁ'rst'“tirne last week as oneiof the chief reasons for the current Soviet
‘cultural’ offensive against.Western ‘decadence’. and ‘cosmopolitanism.’-.”.=
~ ‘.‘The Moscow censorship has hitherto kept news of this development
fraomreaching the outside world. Edward Weintal, Newsweek diplomatic
correspondent, has obtained the following documented report.”_ , - i
Weintal’s “documented report,” however, did ,not declare that there
was any ‘widespread ofﬁcial anti-,Semitic compaign’: in the U.S.S.R._ His
thesis was quite different. All he set out to prove was declaredin his
opening, sentence: 4 S e  J . s _ ,
“A campaign to eliminate Jewish intellectuals from cultural life is
now underway in the Soviet Union.” A ' ’ ‘

‘Ciosmopolitanism’

 Weintal adduced the following evidence, or claims,uto prove the

1. Of 50 intellectuals attacked in the Soviet press ‘inﬂtwo months
f0r,“cosmopolitanism,” 49 are Jewish. _  ' is ' ' S l
 "2. Jewish family names of writers with ‘Russian, pseudonymsl were
pri‘nted”in parentheses when the writers were underiattack. “This is ‘un-
precedented in a country where anti-Semitism is ‘a criminal offense.” '

6. A writer named Alexander Isbakh (lsakIBachrack) was}casti-

gated in a Moscow publication for exalting the Hebrew religion and
jprlopagating Zionism. J - '

or J 7.— ‘Anti-Semitism was gferocio-us in 19th ' century Czarist Russia.
“Dislike of the Jews remained ingrained in the Russian character.” ~

[.7}

  

8. “Stalin himself appears to be sporadically anti-Semitic.”
9. Many of the Communist leaders who opposed Stalin were Jews.

Still Criminal Offense

Nowhere in his article did Weintal say that oliicial Soviet policy is
anti-Semitic. In fact, he mentioned twice that anit-Semitism always has
been and still is a criminal offense in the U.S.S.R. He even noted that
“Western observers in Moscow hesitate to assume that the present cam-
paign is deliberately designed to arouse . . . latent anti-Semitism.” _

The editors of Newsweek, however, showed no hesitation in assuming
that all this added up to “a widespread official anti-Semitic campaign.”

Some of W eintal’s statements are indisputably true. It is established
fact that many of the Communist leaders who opposed Stalin were Jews.

It is also an established fact that many of the Communist leaders
who supported Stalin were Jews. Trotsky was a Jew. So is Lazar.Kaga-
novich, one of Stalin’s right-hand men, a Jew. What does it prove?

No support is oiiered for the statement that “Stalin himself appears
to be sporadically anti-Semitic.” There is, of course, considerable evi-
dence to the contrary. One could scarcely ﬁnd a stronger statement on
the subject than this from a Stalin speech:

“National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of misanthropic cus-
toms, peculiar to the period of cannibalism. Anti-Semitism, as an extreme
form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism.”

It is also indisputable that anti-Semitism wasﬁfostered by the Czarist
government. To what extent “dislike of the Jews remained ingrained in
the Russian character” is debatable, but it is not debatable that the Bol-
sheviks have tried to educate and legislate it out of the Russian character.
Article 123 of the Soviet Constitution states unequivocally:

“Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their
nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and
political life, is an indefeasible law.

“Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any
establishment of direct or indirect privileges for, citizens on account of
their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national
exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law.”

It is further indisputable that a number of Jewish writers, artists
and intellectuals have been criticized most violently in the Soviet pres
for “cosmopolitanism” and “bourgeois nationalism.” -

The key question here, of course, is not whether the criticisms were
justiﬁed, not whether “cosmopolitanism” and “bourgeois nationalism” are
good things or bad, but whether the criticisms were aimed at Jews as
such, and whether the evil acts_ or evil ideas ‘attributed to some Jewish
individuals were said to be characteristic of all Jews.

There are a number of Jews among the ll. leading Communists being
tried in this country. No one would suggest that their prosecution was an
example -cf an oﬂicial government policy of anti-Semitism. Clearly, it is
not necessarily anti-Semitism when some Jews are criticized or punished
here for being anti-capitalist, and it is not necessarily anti-Semitism when

some Jews are criticized or punished in Soviet Russia for being anti-
Communist. '

Jews?
The answer is incontrovertible. It is untrue that all Jewish intel-

lectuals and artists are under attack in the~Sovict Union. On the contrary .

it is the fact that“m‘any Jews are being highly praised and rewarded. .
Newsweek printed its story of a “widespread oﬂicial anti-Semitic
campaign” in the issue of April 4. Pravda, in its issues of April 9 and

0 10, printed the names of several hundred winners of 1948 Stalin prizes

for achievements in ‘the arts and in technology. THE DAILY COMPASS has
had those names transliterated by a ‘competent Russian translator. Exactly
99 of them—-77 in technology and 22 in arts—-—were unmistakably Jewish.

For example, Solomon ..Abramovich Kantor, a professor at the
Kalinin Polytechnic Institute in Leningrad, won 100,000 rubles for work
on “Theory and Construction of Steam Turbines.” Lev Veniamovich
Marmorshtein, chief engineer of the Hammer and Sickle Plant in Mos-
cow, won 50,000 rubles for introducing theuse of oxygen to intensify a

‘ metallurgical process. Samuel Yakovlevich Marshak won 50,000 rubles

for a translation of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Vulf Abramovich Rapoport
won 100,000 rubles for ﬁlming “The Young Guard.” Grigory Romano-
vich Cinzburg won 50,000 for excellence in piano concerts. Semen
Shlemovich Kaplan won 50,000 rubles for his performance in the ballet.
And so on. . . . ‘

Almost 20 per cent of the Stalin prize winners had Jewish names.
Less than 2 per cent of the population of the U.S.S.R. is Jewish.

There is left of Weintal’s argument one thing: the “unprecedented”
parenthetical use of the Jewish family name alongside the pen name of
writers under attack. -

Except that it is not unprecedented at all.- It is regular Soviet prac-
tice to print both the pen name and family name of authors when they
are mentioned in connection with any oﬂicial or state matter. This is true
when they are being publicly bawled out. It is also true when they are
being publicly praised. »

In that same list of Stalin prize winners, printed in Pravda April 10,
there were numerous examples. A 50,000 ruble prize went to “Boris
Nikolaevich Polevoi (’Kampov)” for abook of short stories. A like sum
went to “Elizarii Yurevich Maltsev (Pupko)” for-a novel. “Yakub Kolas
(Konstantin Mikhailovich Mitskevich)” was awarded 50,000 rubles for a
poem. And so on.

A month later. Newsweek was out with another set of “proofs” of
Soviet anti-Semitism.

“Zhid” is a derogatory term for Jew in the Russian language,
roughly equivalent to “kike.” “Zhid” is also the transliteration into
Russian of the last name of the French author Andre Gide, who was once
highly approved in the Soviet Union but is now considered a leader of
the anti-Soviet bloc.

This coincidence provided one of the weirdest episodes in the build-

up of the thesis that the U.S.S.R. has suddenly decided that Hitler was

The test is a simple one: are all Jews being attacked, or just some .
