Montana AG Iocls 

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—The
Montana Joint MMSW Negotiat-
ing Committee, representing bar-
gaining spokesmen from every
ACM local in Montana, met here
Friday and Saturday, March 16
and 17, to hammer out a fighting
and coordinated contract pro-
gram for 1951.

Delegates to the two-day con-
ference adopted a series of 1951
demands headed by a pension
plan, a substantial wage increase and
paid sick leave. At the same time, they
agreed that all contract strings now
tied to vacations and paid holidays
must be removed, and that one more
paid holiday and an added week’s vaca-
tion after 10 years will be sought.

There was also agreement on the
need for an improved health and wel-
fare plan. These proposals will all be
advanced by delegates from Montana
ACM locals at the forthcoming Mining,
Smelting & Refining Conference in
Denver March 28 and 29. If they are
adopted at this national Mine-Mill wage
and contract policy meeting, they will
then be submitted to the members of
all four ACM locals in Montana and
then to the company.

PRESENT for the sessions here were
Joe Mason, Stanley Babcock, John
Murdock and Sam James of Butte Min-
ers Union, Local 1; Henry Young of
Butte Stationary Engineers, Local 83;
Clyde Farlin, James McLean, Walter
Dooley and John Emmons of Anaconda
Mill & Smeltermen’s Union, Local 117;
and Dan Burns, Ray‘ Graham, Bryan
Jensen and Larry Mower of Great Falls
Mill & Smeltermen’s Union, Local 16.

Representatives of the International
union at the meeting included Interna-
tional president Jolm Clark, board
member William Mason, and Int’! reps.
John McLeod and Harlow Wildman.

The ACM delegates elected Joe
Mason, president of the Butte Miners
Union, as chairman of the joint nego-
tiating committee; Henry Young, finan-
cial secretary of the Butte Engineers
Union, and Ray Graham, president of
the Great Falls Smeltermen, as vice
chairmen; and Charles McLean, record-
ing secretaryiof the Anaconda local,
was re-elected secretary.

The committee voted to have one
spokesman from each of the four locals
present at the negotiations with ACM.
It was agreed that a large delegation
from the four Montana locals should

attend the national Mining, Smelting’,

and Refining Conference in Denver.

The entire meeting was marked by
a high degree of unity, and showed
that Montana members of Mine-Mill
are ‘confident and determined to win
in 1951. ’

Editorial

iWhal' do YOU think?

THE biggest question facing the American and Canadian people
today is: peace . . . or war?

Everybody—even the munitions maker and the profiteering
corporation president-—claims he is for peace.

But, as the Mine-Mill International Executive Board declared
in its policy statement last month, you do not guarantee peace
by preparing for war. “The surest way to bring on a global war
isgto engage in a gigantic arms program."

At the same time. the Board pointed to the fact that “the
newspapers tell us there is a mounting ground-swell of popular
opinion for withdrawal of all American troops from Korea and
against sending U. S. troops to Europe . . . the people of America
are trying to say they want peace. not war." '

- How can peace be Won?

We want YOUR answer to this burning question. Everybody
has an opinion about Whether U. S. troops should—-or should not
—be pulled out of Korea, whether the Yanks should be going
to Europe, Whether China should be recognized by the United
Nations. What's yours?

This is -YOUR paper. -Here's your chance to tell your fellow-
members in Mine-Mill how you feel about the “defense mobiliza-
tion program." the wage freeze. the price freeze-and-then-thaw.
proposals for higher taxes. and all the rest of it.

If you don't want to write a long letter, put what you have

to say down on a post card. Send it to THE UNION, 412 Tabor ,

Building, Denver 2, Colorado. We'll print it.

Bryson, Quebec

New Galumet miners
win 10-cent hike

BRYSON, Quebec—Members of Mine-
Mill Local 880, voting by secret ballot,
have decided to accept a new agree-
ment with the New Calumet Mines
here. The pact was negotiated before
a conciliation officer of the Quebec La-
bor Department.

The contract calls for a 10-cent hour-
ly wage increase for all workers, as
well as five statutory holidays with
pay. It also provides for several im-
provements in the grievance and senior-
ity clause, and calls for one week vaca-
tion after one year, and two weeks
after four years. Time and one-half
shall be paid for all Sunday work.

During negotiations, the company
had offered a zinc bonus as the basis
for signing an agreement, but the mem-
bership turned this down and went on
to win the straight l0-cent hourly in-

" crease. However, the company agreed,

before the conciliation officer, to con-
tinue the zinc bonus, and this was in-
cluded in the agreement. The bonus
can rise to a top of 26 cents an hour.

The gains won by Mine-Mill here are
far ahead of the pattern being set in
other industries in this district.

The Local 880 negotiating committee
included president Emmet Johnson,
Cesare Migneault, Leon Brazeau, Bob
Hortie, Ray McGuire and Eddie Ranger,
assisted by Int’l rep. William Kennedy.

lneo locals get set
for contract talks

SUDBURY, Ont.-—With the April 1
date for contract negotiations drawing
near, members of Sudbury Local 598
and Port Colborne Local 637 were en-
gaging in lively discussion of contract
demands to be presented to the Inter-
national Nickel Co. in 1951 bargaining.

Special meetings of the stewards and
membership of the 12,000-member lo-
cal here have already been held. Simi-
lar meetings were scheduled in Port
Colborne, with the idea of preparing
for joint bargaining of the two locals
with the_company.

Local 598 president Nels Thibault
and Local 637 president Mike Kopinak
have issued a statement urging their
members to “close ranks and prepare
for what may turn out to be the tough-
est negotiations in history.”

Members of both locals were called
on to “raise the tempo of their union
activity so that there is no doubt in
anyone’s mind that we are determined
this year to win all our demands when
we meet the company in bargaining
next month.”

Win certification
at Port Haney Brick
HANEY, B. C. —— Mine-Mill Local
289 has won certification as the collec-

tive bargaining agency for workers at
the Port Haney Brick & Tile’ Co. here.

I.

The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

I‘ hasnow enlisted in the campaign to

cut down the living standards of Amer-
ican workers. "

That’s the only meaning of changes
just made in the“‘Bi1reau’s Consumers
Price Index, commonly regarded. as a
oost-of-living index. The changes will
mean a loss of millions of dollars in
wages to American workers.

All wage negotiations for years to
come will be affected in one way or
another by the Bureau’s index. Some
three million workers are directly cov-
ered by contracts which tie wages to
the index. B "

More important, in periods of wage
control such as we have already en-
tered, the index tends to be used as
an official yardstick of theneed for
wage increases. In World War_.II, for
example, wage increases were limited
to 15 per cent above the January, 1941,
level to compensate for increased liv-
ing costs between that date and May,

i 1942, as measured” by the ‘Bureau’s

index.’ 4 _ .

The new changes ‘result in a
lower index and minimize the amount
of recent increases ﬁn living costs.
The-new index was set at 181.5 points
for January 15, as compared with 181.6
under the old method of computing.
The increase in the cost of living, on

fthenew basis, is 13.3 points or 7.9 per

~ cent. On the old system the increase

/

1 ‘is 14.7 points‘ or 8.8 per cent.

IF ALL THIS SEEMS like a lot of
‘quibbling over technicalities, we need
onlylook at the New‘ York Times’ com-
ment of March'11: “Millions of dol-
lars ride on -every tenth of a percen-
tage point.” — _.

The main change made by the Bu-
reau’s indexers was- to lower the im-
portance of food in the family’s cost
of living. In the old index,_ food"

counted.for,»42 per cent of all money -i

spent byethe average worker’s family.
Now that food prices are at astronom-
ical levels and going still higher, BIS
Commissioner’Clague‘ has decided that
workers don’t spend that much of ‘their
income on food.A \ .

The “weight” given to food in the
index has been cut -to 33 points, a dras-

tic cut in the effect of high food_ prices

on the overall index._ V , V --

At the same time, Clagueincreased
the importance ofithe “miscellaneous”
group of items which cover such things
ascars, recreation,; medical care and
many other services. . ‘ _

,_ Now of course, very few workers
can afford _toVj>uy anything but food,
rent and clothing these’days_. Still, ac-

cording to his own Iweird logic, Clague

B      index changes
to bring “wage losses

By Bernard  Stern"

4-’ Mine-Mill Research Director

‘been

) .

has decided that workers’ families now
spend 32 per cent of what they make on
these “miscellaneous” items, as com-
pared‘ with 22 per cent in the old index.

CLAGUE '  L A I M S that ‘ these
changes are": justified by studies of
spending habits of middle income fam-
ilies made in 1948 and 1949... The Bu-
reau claims that these studie showed
families were spending a smaller share
of their income for food than before
and a larger share for recreation and
medical care.

The full results of these studies are
yet to be made public.‘ What we already
know about them shows they are en-
tirely inadequate as a basis for such
major and far-reaching. changes as
have been introduced into the index.

The so-called studies were limited to
only a few hundred families in six or
seven cities in 1948 and 1949. The old
index, on the other hand, was based on
a study of family spending habits that
covered 14,500 families in 1934-36.

Even ‘if we assume that the new
studies accurately measured the way in
which families spent their money then,
it’s obvious that workers___today—-and‘
for years to come—-will not be spend-
ing in the same way they did in 1948
and 1949. Radios, television set and
furniture were easy to get in 1948 and
1949. Today, they’re getting scarcer
and prices are so high that only higher
income groups can afford them.

Moreover, as any worker’s wife could
testify, high food prices today force
families to‘ cut out all but» the most
essential purchases. . _ ‘ /

The very least the Bureau might.
have done in theinterests of accuracy,
would _have been to postpone any
changes until further and more thor-
ough studies had been completed——in

- particular of ‘1951 spending habits.

THE BITTER IRONY of the whole
situation lies in~the fact that labor’s
legitimate grievances against the in-
adequacies of the index have now been
perverted into an instrument for new

attacks upon rapidly deteriorating liv-.

ing standards. Labor pressure finally
forced. the Bureau to admit that it had
consistently understating the
amount of rent increases through its
failure to price new houses and apart-
ments built since the war.

After several years, this bias in the
index has been corrected, but the effect
of this correction has been more than
cancelled -out by the new distortions
put into the index. , .

When labor urged in World War II
that the Bureau’s index take into ac-
count “forced alteration in “the manner
of living,” the Bureau answered with
the argument that this was contrary
to the’ purpose «of the index. Taking

.wartime buying habits into account’

then wouldlhave meant a ‘much higher
index-——and that would have resulted in
more wage» increases. V

It remained for a so-called “pro-

Mine-Mill officers pledge 1
support for packing workers —

DENVER——The “whole-hearted sup-

" port” of the International Union of

Mine, Mill‘ & Smelter Workers to the
nation’s packinghouse workers if they

. are forced to strike was pledged March

14 by Mine—Mill’s four International
officers. 9 '

The statement was issued shortly be-
fore Eric Johnston, Director of Eco-
nomic Stabilization, announced that he
had rejected the 11—cent wage increase
negotiated by the United Packinghouse

Workers and the AFL Amalgamated

Meat Cutters with the big packing
companies.

The four officers, president John
Clark, vice presidents Orville Larson
and Charles Wilson, ‘and secretary-
treasurer Maurice Travis, declared that
“Enforcement of the government wage
freeze against -workers in the packing
industry would be particularly vicious
in view of the generally--low wages in
that industry, and the extremely high
profits enjoyed by packing magnates
in recent years.”

They called on all‘ local Mine-Mill
unions “to seek ways in which they can
support the workers of the packing-
house industry in securing their just
demands.” '

Meantime, president Ralph Helstein
of the United Packinghouse Workers
charged that‘ Economic Stabilizer John-
ston “is using "the industry and its
workers as a pawn to force the United
Labor Policy Committee to accept the
conditions which industry is seeking to
dictate in the current mobilization pro-
gram.” The United Labor Policy Com-
mittee includes spokesmen from the

that the wage level in packinghouses *_~

Support pledged by
two big lnoo locals

MARMORA, Ont.—More than 150

,. _members of the Deloro Mine, Mill and

Smelter Workers Union attended a.
union contract rally here recently, with

. president.Nels Thibault of Local 598,
H and president Mike Kopinak of Local

637 as featured speakers.

‘ Thibault, who is wage‘ policy coordi-
nator for eastern Canada, pledged the
‘support of 13,000 Sudbury miners be-
hind the 1951 contract demands of De-
loro workers.

Kopinak _pledged the unity of Port
-Colborne workers behind the Deloro de-
mands, and_.told how the defeat of the
Steelworkers Union raiders in Port Col-
borne had resulted in an ‘interim wage
increase of 8 cents an hour. He warned
the Deloro workers to guard against
any ‘attempts by the Steel officials to
bring disunity to their union.

The Local 637 president, who is also
a member of the Canadian wage policy
committee, said that because of the
Steel raid the Port»Colborne workers
suffered a loss of 15 cents an hour, as
well as weakening of union security and
grievance procedure. But he pointed
out that today Port Colborne workers
are 100 per cent united behind their de-
mands for the coming negotiations with
Inco.

Int’l rep. George Herman told the
workers that steps must be taken im-
mediately to improve the serious con-
dition of arsenic dust in the Deloro

1

° plant, which is endangering the health
- of the workers. Coston Paraniuk, pres-

ident of the Deloro Local, and Pat Ber-
trand, vice president, led a rank-and-
file discussion of the contract demands,
which was concluded with a unanimous
expression of support for the negotiat-
ing committee. ‘

It was announced that Brother“ Bill
Cross had signed up more than 100 new
members into the union, and that the
local-’s membership mark had now
topped 280.

diecasting, secondariy smelting

CHICAGO, Ill.——Delegates from Mine-
Mill locals in the zinc, diecasting and
secondary smelting industries met here
March 17 and 18 to confer on 1951 wage
and contract policy. in their industries.

The two-day parley drafted proposals
to be submitted to the mining, Smelt-
ing & Refining and the National Wage
Policy conferences of the International
union scheduled for March 27 in Den-
ver. -

District three board member Ray-
mond Dennis, acting as chairman of
the joint meeting, reviewed the con-
tract gains made last year and condi-
tions that now exist in t e industry.
Dennis also‘ reported on the .policy
statements adopted by the Internation-
al executive board, ,which .were unani-.
mously approved by the delegates.

THE FIRST AFTERNOON of the
conference was spent in, separate ses-
sions of the three groups, and the
delegates reconvened Sunday. morning
to hear reports from thegroups‘ on
specific recommendations for bargain-
ing programs in diecasting, zinc and
secondary smelting.

Highlight of the conference was an
address by International secretary-
treasurer Maurice Travis, who pointed
to the large gains made by the militant
and progressive locals that remained
in Mine-Mill, in contrast to the tiny
gains—and even losses—sustained by
those locals that left- our ranks.

Travis declared that the Mine-Mill

fproven completely correct. He gave
examples to show how people from all
walks of life are now taking an out-
right position against the war in Korea
and the Marshall Plan, and in favor
of United Nations recognition of Re-
publican China. “A great transition is
taking place in America,” he said.

Travis went on to give details of
Mine-Mill’s position on the wage-price-
tax squeeze. “,Workers and the rest of
the__ people are not willing to._.accept
poor working conditions, low wages,
high prices and higher taxes because
of a phony emergency,” he said. “Our
1940 dollar is worth only 45 _cents'-to-
day.” '

The future of ‘our union is bright, he
added. Confidence in the leadership and
lmembership of our union gives a feel-
ing of optimism to the coming Na-
tional Wage Policy conference.

The conference agreed to recommend
a demand for a general wage increase,
the exact amount to be determined at
the National Wage Policy meeting. And

. it urged all local unions to fight for

equalization of rates among various
plants in the industries.

March 11-13; onefor the’West was
scheduled in Salt Lake City, Utah,
March 22-24. ’

Canadian staff members were unable

discussion by the International ‘officers

problems. 

Floor discussion, with all staff mem-
bers invited to take part, was a part -of
each point on . the agenda- Much at-
tention was given to participation of .
the staff and the union in the struggles
for peace and civil rights.

Staff. members were ‘unanimous in
the opinion that they had‘gained much,

.both in information and morale, from‘

the conferences. .

Holding of the eastern meeting in the
Deep South was an unprecedented
move. Thiswas done to emphasize the

‘ importanceof Mine-Mill participation ‘

in the Negro liberation struggle,.and
the contributions. of our Negro mem-
bers to the strength-of the Interna-

Staff members who\had not previous-

there. Especially they were impressed
by the confidence they found that the
evil Jimcrow system can be defeated;

.W|1y big business fears
any 7rumo‘r of peace’ -

_. NEW YORK (FP)—The war boom
will bring American industry govern-
ment contracts totalling about $87 bil-

" lion between now and November 1952,
with the lion’s,share going to big‘ busi-

ness.

According to the business press,
_which is‘ filled with reports showing
1950»was an unprecedented profit joy-
 ride for most corporations, 3militai'y
‘ spending is the key to the continuing
boom. ,
Both U.S. News and Business Week,
industry magalzines, agree that con-
tinued U.S. prosperity is dependent on
massive government spending. “Arma-
ment will be the inflationary force for
the next five years at least,” U.S.

‘News says. “The armament industry
is to become. _a new big industry for
the U.S., permanently active. It will
rival autos or steel or housing indus-
try.” ~ ‘

U.S. News warns that an improved

ﬂ world peace outlook would hurt busi-
ness. “Any sudden easing of world
tension," it said, “any sharp cancella-
tion of war orders would catch ‘many
firms -‘between high-priced inventories

age of civilian goods. As matters stand
now, this looks like a safe bet, at least
for the near future.” .
’ __Government placing of war orders is
gaining in tempo. New orders. received
by manufacturers in January jumped
8 per cent above December, while un-
filled orders rose to a record total of
$41.7 billion.

tary spending was applauded by the
Wall Street Journal, which said: “Mo-
bilizer Charles. E. Wilsgn, up to his
neck in troubles and squabbles, has
one bright feather in his cap‘--he's
pushed the Pentagon into tripling its
buying.”

As in World War II, when 75 per

cent of the prime contracts went to
100 of the largest companies, current
government contracts are again going
to the giant corporations. An execu-
tive order from President» Truman
authorized the, letting of contracts
without competitive ..bidding,, giving
“‘the administration's consent to a prac-
tice that has been in effect for several

mented.

Business Week predicted cynically
that “some gestures of aid to small
business” will be made “even though
in ‘practice, ‘the industrial giants go
ahead" gobbling up most of the gov-
ernment contracts—just as in World

\ I “Such developments, however, api.
pear highly improbable. Defense pro-
grams give every. sign of going for-
ward throughout the Western world. "
Merchants are -betting on continued

defense demand with a growing short-‘ ' War II.” ‘.

O/oein jorum a   

Shortly before the ‘Peace Crusade
opened in Washington, the Salt Lake 4. 3
City Tribune printed a letter from’ .  5
Sen. Wallace Bennett, in which Ben-
nett advises-a. Utah delegate “to stay
home and save her money instead of, 1
coming to Washington.” I -

The Utah Senator warned the wom- , 
an that any interview he had with her,
if she persisted in coming to Washing- » -
ton would be “made available to the, * 
press and Federal Bureau of.Investi-
gation.” ’ "  _

Verne Curtis, Mine-Mill Interna- ‘ ”‘
tional representative at Magnd, Utah, ,,
promptly sent a. ‘reply to Bennett, for- "
wording a copy of his’letter to TH
UNION. Curtis’ comments are so 
timely that we print excerpts from his
letter below; . ‘

.“It is" alarming to me, Senator, to

 only way‘,
, llutchinscalls for
 direct peace. talks

-NEW YORK (FP)———Direct peace ne-
gotiations)between the U.S. and Soviet
_Union_ are the only way to preserve
freedom and achieve security, accord-
ingto noted educator Dr. Robert M.
_Hutchins.

Hutchins, currently on leave as
, chancellor of the University of Chi-
. cago, delivered the fifth address in the
13 Sidney" Hillman Foundation Lecture
A . Series, sponsored ‘by the Amalgamated
' 1 Clothing Workers union in honor of its

late ‘ president. _
Warning that “the next war will
mean the end of civilization,” Hutchins
said: “We must be willing to negotiate
with anybody, at any time or place,
on any"'subject. Since nobody can win
the next war and nobody can profit
by it,_it is in everybody’s interest to
avoid it. This interest‘ can be made the

* basis of agreements that will last.”

.He said "U.S. ‘policymakers were
wrong in "sefarchingTlf"or securityfon
- the military ront. ,e raising o a
,- 3'/2. million‘-man army and drafting of
‘ 18-year-olds, he said, will prove. “a
' terrible burden and one that.will re-

sult in restrictions of and dangers to
_our liberty.”

Analyzing U.S. policy in the far east,

. . .Hutchins said that even if Russia did

" . not ‘exist there would still be a revolu-

tionary situation among the oppressed
inhabitants of colonial nations.

THE END OF COLONIALISM is
. long overdue, Hutchins said, adding:
’ ‘.‘It is not the obligation or the inter-
est of the U. S. to stop these revolu-
tions or to oppose them; and in par-
ticular, it is not the interest or the
obligation of the U. S. to oppose them
by force of arms . . . Already the
U. S. is drifting into the position of
’~-residuary. legatee of qll the hatred
formerly directed by the colored races
- ‘toward the English, the Frenchhthe
._.Portuguese‘ and the Dutch.”

 ‘Turning to Europe, Hutchins pointed
outthat two American divisions have
._been stationed there for .the last five
. years and that “the Russians have not
_ engaged_their ‘own forces at any point”
in that time. Hutchins said that “un-
' . less we force them or terrify them into
it,” the Soviet Union will not start a
'world war without having a stockpile
of atomic bombs.
_“Since, presumably, We are not go-
ing to start a preventive War,” Hutch-
* ins said, “and since, presumably, the
-Russians are not going to start a war
until they have the bombs they want,
i the socalled strength that we are now
fbuilding up will not be used when it
could be effective . . . After the Rus-
sians have a stockpile of atomic bombs,
what good will an enormous army do
us?” ’
 -. tThe educator said people tend to for-
4 ' ‘getthe elementary fact that there is
 ' no defense against the atom bomb._He
 »- recalled that the “old—fashioned” bomb
 used at Hiroshima killed or injured
‘ 250,000 people in one minute.

“They Deserve »What They Got” might very well have been
the title of this editorial, reprinted from the Yorlg “Gazette
and Dailg‘/°,” one of the oldest independent newspapers in Penn-
sylvania. The editorial is especially signiﬁcant because it rep-
resents a viewpoint entirely outside the labor movement. .

High labor‘ union officials are letting it be known thqt they
are very much disappointed in the treatment they are getting at
the hands of the government.

They don't like the way the wage-price problem is -being
ﬁgured. '

They don't likeihe fact that they have just about been frozen
out of the government mobilizc:1tion.czpparcttus.

They are reported to be alarmed’
at the methods the government used to
persuade the railroad switchmen to re-
turn to work.

Some of themhave gone so far as
to say that big business has all but
' taken over in Washington.

Well, the officials who are going
around in circles now trying‘ somehow
to sct_1vc1ge.ct bit’ of prestige have no
right to ‘be disappointed. They are get- _
ting just what they deserve.’

THEY ARE GETTING COMPI.n\/IENTSS from the‘ high ana-
mighty of the land for their job in l<nocking‘Communists and .so-
cczlled Communists out of the mctin—strec1m of the labor movement.

 

What they are really being praised forjs creating a weak.
divided labor movement which does not even have the’ strength
to win Ct place in CI mobilization program for its leaders.

The officials who are worried now about big business in
Washington and so forth have failed miserably in. their job since
the closeof the second World War. '

They have failed to keep wages abreast even»of the cost of
living. They have failed to protect working conditions. They have
failed in political action. They have failed in organization.

BUT THEIR GREAT FAILURE has been’ their utter lCICl{ of.re-
sponsibility in the cause of world peace. - - ~ .

I

No group in the United Stories is better situated in the social
scheme of things to lead Ct constructive struggle for peace than
the working people. No group stands to lose more-by war. No
group has more to win through peace.

Rieve-Baldanzi row

breaks out again

NEW YORK (FP)—Dis1nissal by
president Emil Rieve of the Textile
Workers Union of Samuel Baron, the
union’s Canadian director, has brought

out into the open again the intra-union ‘

dispute between Rieve and TWUA ex-
ecutive vice president George Baldanzi.

Baron was a leading supporter of
Baldanzi, whose reelection was unsuc-
cessfully opposed by Rieve at the un-
ion’sVconvention last May. After Bald-
anzi’s victory, both sides agreed to try
to heal the breach; Accgrding to Bald-
anzi,,who announced March 10 he would
carry his fight against -Rieve to the
‘membership, the Baron"dismissal.was

“the final act in a campaign of re-

prisal, intimidation and coercion" car-

ried on by the union president since V

the May convention.

“This,” he said, “is a sickening de-
monstration of what can happen to a
man intent on usinghis power to cap-
ture an organization completely. Rieve

is_.engaged in a ruthless‘ campaign to‘

wipe out any independent thinking.”
Baron remains as a TWUA vice presi-
dent. .

A letter sent out by Rieve accused
Baldanzi of releasing “highly partisan
statements” to the press.

' Observers -here noted that there are

I no basic policy disagreements between

.. Baldanzi and Rieve, but that the fight
is purely one over power-——and spoils.

Mexican miners end
long protest marcli

MEXICO CITY—Some, 4,000 Mex- »

'ican miners have arrived here at the
end of a history-making “long march,”
in which they trekked. some 850 miles
to this capital in order to protest to
the government against their treatment
at the'<hands of a . S. mining cor-
poration.

The miners, who have been on
strike against the American Smelting
& Refining Co., came all the Way from
Nuova Rosita -._ and Cloete in the
province of Chihuahua, and there were

some 40 women /who marched shoulder ‘
to shoulder with their husbands.

The march began January 20, and
nearly two months elapsed before the
long stream ‘of miners marched into

. this city. The march was in protest

against the government’s actions short-
ly after the strike began, freezing the
union’s funds, closing down the union’s
consumer cooperatives, closing union
halls and'offices and engaging in ‘other
strike-breaking activities.

* The marchers demanded to see Presi-
dent Miguel~Aleman. But the Mexican
president, who takes \his orders’ from
.U. S. corporation interests, refused to
meet with their leaders. Instead, they
were sent to Manuel Vasquez, minister
of labor, who has repeatedly refused to
recognize the striking union.

  CM&Sloca|s draft   

'51 contract demands

KIMBERLEY, B.C.——Delegates from
three Consolidated Mining & Smelting
Co. locals met here early this month
and prepared a draft program ‘of de-
mands for the 1951 contract campaign.

The delegates, representing Local
480 in Trail, Local 651 in Kimberley
and Local 690 in Calgary, agreed on
strategy for unified joint bargaining
with CM&S this year. Heading the list:
of contract demands is a 25-cent hourly
wage increase.

They also agreed to press for a union
shop of the type already in effect at
Sudbury and Port Colborne, and for
elimination of all strings tied to paid
Il0llCl‘.1_VS.- "

THE BARGAINING program sug-,
gested for CM&S negotiations also calls
for extension of vacation benefits, in-
creases in shift differentials, nvertime
pay _,for all Saturday and Sunday work,
cumulative sick, leave of one day a
month, and total hospitalization to be
paid for by the company.

The two-day policy meeting was at-
tended by Local 480 president Al King,
financial secretary Les Walker, Martin
Walsh, Percy Berry, Dan--Dosen and J.
LePage; Local 651 president Clem
Thompson, financial secretary Douglas
Gold, recording secretary J. Rollheiser,
R. W. Shannon, Don Cook, Jack Smith
and W. J. Hockley; Local 690 president
L. B. Dowell, and recording secretary
J. Dunbar.

‘Also present were Ken Smith, pres-
ident of the B. C. district union; Har-
vey Murphy, B. C. regional ‘director;
and Int’1 reps. John Gordon and Wil-
liam Longridge.

The sessions were keynoted by a
spirit of unity, expressed by King when
he said :_ “This is another step forward
in tlie Mine-Mill program of uniting all
of the workers in the industry, in order
that they can muster the greatest pos-
sible strength in bargaining with the

giant companies in the industry. Only’

Mine-Mill can achieve this unity of all
locals in CM&S ‘operations?

Thompson pointed to the gains al-
ready won by the,Trail and Kimberley
locals as the result of joint bargaining
and said “the addition of Local 690 to
our bargaining will benefit every
worker in the industry.” Similarly,
Lloyd Dowell of ‘Calgary expressed
pleasure over inclusion of Local 690 in

‘program for gold’

KIRKLAND LAKE, Ont. —— Mine-
Mill’s “program for gold” has been
launched here by Local 598 president
Nels Thibault in a radio address. Thi-
_ demand
that the government come to the aid
of the gold mine workers, the gold
mining communities and the industry
itself. ‘ ‘

Some 30,000 Canadian workers and
their families depend on the gold min-
/ing industry, he -said, and if the gov-
ernment fails to assume its responsi-
bility to these workers, they will be
forced to leave the industry and the
communities will collapse.

Thibault called on the government
either 1)-to free gold by permitting it
to find its own price on the world mar-
ket, 2) substantially increase the direct
subsidy now provided to the industry,
or 3) arrange acombination of both
proposals. ' c M

The "Local 598 president said Mine-
.Mill is mobilizing support for this

program across. Canada because of its

determination to save the gold mining
workers and their communities..-

mented, by President Edward Coleman‘
of Local 552 and John Gattison, Jr., of
Local 445. The action to set up local
committees to be coordinated on a
state-wide basis by Brother Graves
marks a great step forward in the fight
for civil rights. ‘

The attack on living standards and
the complete disregard for workers’
rights in the war mobilization program,
as expressed both , in the wage-tax-

price squeeze and the curtailment -of ,

copper goods production, brought sharp
protests from the delegates. Brother
C6leman voiced deep concern over the
atmosphere in Washington, where he
said big-business minded officials
showed no understanding or concern
for» the needs of the people.

John Marshall of Torrington ques-
tioned the drafting of 18-year olds who,
as he pointed out, “are not even con-
sidered old enough to vote.” Ray Dowd,
President of Local 423, emphasized the
confusion and ignorance displayed by
Washington officials during their" re-
cent meeting with brass union repre-
sentatives on the curtailment picture.

Monye Meyers of Stamford stressed
the need for political action and educa-
tion, and Dominic Yoia of Local 445,
calling for labor candidates for public
office, summed up the common senti-.»

Here is the partial text of a report
by Brother Graves on civil rights at
the Brass "Conference in Ansonia,
Conn. on March 3. Following the re-
port is Brothers Graves’ account of
conference action on his proposals.) v

“Today more than ever before there
is a great need for the American peo-
ple,especially '
working men and
women, to alert
themselves to the ‘
dangers facing our
most elenientary
civil liberties. One
need only read the"
daily newspapers,
or listen to the ra-
dio to conclude that
the reactionary

decent standard of living,mand in the-
process to completely Jim Crow Amer-.
ica, are making tremendous headway.
“Honest Americans who dare ‘stand

leaders, the foreign-born, and the
Negro.-‘people are meeting allgkinds of
intimidation and repression. The recent,
legal lynching of the seven innocent
Negroes in Martinsville, Virginia, is an
indicationof what is reserved for the
Negro in America. Yes, the word of
an insane whitewoman, a woman who
had been committed to a mental" insti-
tution more than once, is enough to put
seven Negroes to their death.

“We cannot forget that Mrs. Rose

still serving‘ a life sentence, after a
mass protest saved «her. life-,from-’ a

politicians and officials now in control,
“What do you have to be-——a hypocrite,

the answer from the floor.

open, organized gppression? I say, we

can, we must, and we will. To do this,
however, we must bring greater unity
between the Negro and white workers.

To free Willie McGee and to‘ put a .4

stopsonce and for all -to legal and
illegal lynching, we must _have organ-
ization. , .

“I PROPOSE that»every Mine-Mill
local union set up Civil Rights Commit-
tees so that the wholeweight of the
union, in cooperation with other organ-
izations, can , be S thrown behind this
fight. FEPC committees in the local
unions could do a wonderful job in
bringing the facts to the rank'andJile.

' Reporting their activities to the execu-

tive boards and the membership, they
could thereby cement the broadest unity
possible with_in the union. - -

“It should "be cl e a r l y understood

a that these committees must be set up‘

with the thought that they are not a
‘Negro Committee’ . but that white
workers must bepencouraged to- accept

responsibility along with Negro work-‘

ers in their formation and activity. The
defense of Civil Rights can only be
made by white and Negro workers to-
gether, when we realize that both white
and Negro workers are the victims in
the long run.” ..

In tliepdiscussion on the report, Pres-
ident Edward Coleman of Local 552,
Stamford, made a wonderful report to
the delegates on the mass pilgrimage
to Ribhmond, Virginia, in the vain at-
tempt to save the Martinsville Seven.
He said half of the 500 delegates in
‘Richmond were from labor unions and

"he was happy, that Mine-Mill was in

that fight upxto the last minute. In the

- light of o_ur failure at Richmond, Presi-

dent Coleman pointed out the impor-

delegates, a big hand was accorded to

Who, although their plant is now repre-
sented by the Steelworkers, have con-

tinued to maintain an active Mine-Mill _

tance of increasing our efforts to save
Willie McGee.

John Gatison, Jr., of Local 445, An-

sonia, reported to the conference of his
activities in collecting signatures and
contributions for the Martinsville Seven
campaign. “It made me feel good” said
Gatison “t_o get such’a wonderful re-
spouse from whitegand Negro people
alike.” He also, emphasized that the
fight must be stepped up so the four
Mcﬁee children will not be left father-
less. ’ i 

The conference unanimously sup-
ported a motion that telegrams be im-
medlately sent to President Truman de-
manding that he intervene at once to
stop the- execution of Wiilie McGee.

. It was also "unanimously voted that
FEPC committees be set up in every
local, and coordinated to carry out a
state-wide program. V . .
The Buffalo, New York brass Local
593 reported‘ that..a few years ago the

American Brass Company refused to

BAYARD, N. M.—0ne of the. "most

outstanding events in this area in re- .

cent years was the “Jamaica” spon-

sored by Bayard Amalgamated Union,

  Local 700% parley hits freeze,

.  plans 1951 Wage campaign i ‘K

LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Western
Mechanics Local 700 held its annual

- convention Sunday, February 25. Rank

and file members of " the big local
mapped plans to seek further wage in-
creases and fight the wage freeze.
Featured-speakers were International
union ‘vice president Orville Larson,
Mine-Millresearch director Bernard W.
Stern, and Paul Pinsky, director of
California Research. _ ‘
Larson’s address, the highlight of
the parley, was characterized by, a
sharp attack on witch hunts, frame-ups
and arrests at midnight. “Sooner or
later,” he said, “there’ll be a change.
Why? Because in the end the Ameri-

‘ can people will say ‘No’ to these out-

rages against civil rights. They will
find the right answers.”

THE INTERNATIONAL vice pre/si-
dent added that “No. one needs to be
ashamed of speaking out for peace.
It’§' not ‘subversive’ to use the word
‘peace.’ More and .more Americans

' have started to speak ou-t for peace.”

Stern, in a detailed chart talk,
showed how American copper workers
today must work 11/; times longer than
they did in June, 1946, in order to earn
enough money to buy the same amount
of food. And he disclosed that our In-
ternational executive board has called
for a rollback of prices to levels that
existed before the Korean war.

The convention was chaired by Local .

700 president Edward F. Parker, elec-
trician from the Phelps Dodge unit,
who delivered a keynote speech.‘ The
credentials committee included Rito
Valencia, John Promersberger, Adam
Squeglia, Harvey Bowen and Laura
Ward:

The rules and order committee in-
cluded Arthur Romero, Jack Millikan,
Emmitt Vowell, L. F. Casey and Bob
Enes. A detailed summary of Local
700’s finances was presented by finan-
cial secretary Bob Enes. ‘

’ Jack Marcotti, local union executive
secretary, gave a report on the “state
of the union,” while Roger Boyd, busi-
ness agent, reported on contract'nego-
tiations, strike coordination and organ-
ization. ‘

The convention adopted resolutions
