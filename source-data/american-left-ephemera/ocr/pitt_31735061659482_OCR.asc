When the late arch anti-.Semite Merwin K. Hart
organized his National Economic Council, he got
$34,513 from one of the DuPont family, $7,000 from
Gulf Oil, $13,350 from Lone Star Cement, $9,532
from the Texas Co. and $9,585 from W. H. Regnery
a right wing publisher. Dr. Fred Schwartz’s Chris-
tian Anti-acommunist Crusade, received heavy
donations from Richﬁeld Oil, Schick Safety Razor,
the Teclmicolor Corp. an-d the A1len—Bradley Co.
of Milwaukee. Allan Westin, Columbia University
professor who studied the right wing network,
estimated th-at in 1961 business donations to the
rightists came to about $10 million. Since that year
the ﬂow of such money increased considerably.

One of the big sources of income for these
rightist organizations is through provision of
literature and ﬁlms to corporations ﬁtted for their
anti-union needs. For that reason apparently, all
sorts of “education-a1” outﬁts and “forums” are set
up to provide innocent labels for the anti-union
poison, with only letterheads to show, but their
lists of sponsors is drawn mainly from Birch
Society business en~dorsers.

The above mentioned UAW study of the 15
major outﬁts in the rightist network, showed that
while each of them had connection with one or
more of the four big employers outﬁts, everyone
of them had representatives on the National Right
to Work Committee, initiator of state “right-to-
work” referendums. The unions are clearly marked
as the No. 1 target of the rightist network. Barry
Goldwater endeared himself to big business from
the very start of his political career as an advocate
of right-to-work laws, aprpli-ca-tion of anti-trust
laws to unions, barring political action to unions
and numerous other restrictions on labor rights.
The rightist network rallied to him with good
reason. For practical political considerations the
Goldwater forces have tried to picture Goldwater
as a man, conservative, n-ot “extreme” but above
the numerous groups that have rallied to him. The
claim is made that he is not of these groups an-d
just can't help it if they love him so much. But
their votes of course would be as welcome as those
of others. Is Barry Goldwater the innocent soul in
the midst of this snakepit of most virulent reac-
tion?

 

  

AS LATE AS MARCH, 1961, Sen. Barry Gold-
water said, “I don’t know much about it” when
questioned on his attitude to the fascist-line John
Birch Society. For practical vote—catdhing purposes
he still claims he is not in any of t-he ultra-Rightist
outﬁts, but just welcomes their support. As a
matter of fact the record shows Goldwater has
been an active ﬁgure, sponsor and featured speaker
of several Birchite fronts since 1959 when they
pushed him for the Presidency.

Goldwater said in April, 1961, that he had re-
jected an oﬁer of membership on the Council of
t-he John Birch Society. But he has served on the
leading bodies of several organizations that are
major JBS offshoots made up mostly of the same
persons who head the Birchites.

-Goldwater was a sponsor of the “Committee
Against Summit Entanglements” that ran a page
ad August 30, 1959 in the New York Times, opposing
President Eisenhower’s conference with Premier
Khrushchev. Robert Welch, head of JBS, was
chairman of that committee and William J. Grede,
former NAM president and leading Birchite council
member w-as vice-chairman. About every listed
top leader of the Birchites was on that committee,
including the late Merwin K. Hart, the notorious
anti—.Semite who led -a New York Birch chapter.
And Gold-water was just a poor innocent soul in
this circle.

Another outﬁt that fronted for JBS with its
sponsors virtually a duplication of the Birchite
top councils, was the “American Committee for
Aid to K-atanga Freedom Fighters.” They saw in
Moise Tshombe a reactionary in their own image
ﬁt for the role of gauleiter in Africa. They even
arranged a mass meeting in Madison Square
Garden and tried to get him to come. Apparently,
Goldwater also drifted innocently into this circle
of Birchites as one of the sponsors.

Barry's College Boys

A “College B.oys for Goldwater" movement
shaped into an ultra-Right “youth” organization
named Young Americans for Freedom. About any-
body who was anybody in Birch-ite leadership from
Welch down was on the sponsoring list of YAF.

11

 

  

And on that national advisory board too, in 1962,
was the name of innocent Barry Goldwater. YAF
is best known among Americans for its hoodlum-
like bands that have often broken up pro-peace,
defense of civil liberties an-d other meetings or
pioket lines for constitutional rights. It is the
“youth” front on”. the ultra-Right.» YAF’s awards
have gone to the most notorious reactionaries
among them Sen. Strom 'I‘hurmond of South Caro-
lina and Moise Tshomlbe of Katanga.

“Human Events,” an ultra-Right Washington
newsletter is another entenprise that has top prior-
ity in JBS to judge by the number of Birchite
leading lights who endorsed it. Again Goldwater
is among the endorsers and he appeared as the
featured speaker -at the “Human Events” Political
Action Conference.

“For America,” a rightist outﬁt headed by retired
Brig. Gen. Bonner Fellers, i-s also heavily favored
in the Birchite top circles to judge by their number
on the sponsorship list. In 1960 when a Goldwater
for President move started, “For America” was
the principal initiator. Fellers has been “foreign
policy advisor” to Goldwater.

‘llhe Manion Forum is one of the major institu-
tions serving the ultra-Right cause with its radio
outlet in 245 cities. Clarence E. Manion, its spokes-
man, is a member of the Birchite council. Gold-
water has been one of the most frequent and
favored speakers of the forum.

Welch Had a Vision

In face of the evidence, (and there is more)
Goldwater can hardly claim innocence. He is, in
fact, the INSIDE KEY MIAN within the ultra-
Right labor-hating net-work. He is no newcomer in
that circle. After Goldwater’s ﬁrst term in the
Senate, Welch wrote in his 1958 “Blue Book”:

“I know Barry fairly well. He is a. great Ameri-
can. I raised around $2,000 in my state and sent
it to him in 1958. Pd love to see him president
of the United States and maybe some day we
shall.” In that same 1958 senate race, H. L. Hunt,
the billionaire oil man of Dallas, biggest of sugar
daddies for the right, gave -Goldwater $3,000.

Goldwater has long had his eye on the Birohites

12

 

 

  

 

as a rea=dy-made political campaign machine for
him. Time Magazine quoted him in 1961 as saying:

“A lot of people in my home town have been
attracted to the society, and I am impresed by the
type of people in it. They are the kind we need
in politics.”

Joe Mocarthy was Goldwater’s model and hero.
In November, 1954, when the resolution to censure
McCarthy came before the Senate, Goldwater was
Joe"s most ardent defender on the Senate ﬂoor,
mainly on the ground that censure would be a
victory for advocates of peace with the Soviet
Union and co-existence. On June 8, 1957, in a
eulogy of McCarthy before the Wisconsin Republi-
can State Convention, Goldwater said, “Joe and I
became friends long before either of us entered
the Senate. He was a faithful, tireless and con-
scientious American.”

Goldrwtater is equally appreciative of the support
announced for him by Robert D. de Pugh of the
riﬂe—bearing “Minutemen.” This secret outﬁt is at
the lower depths of the rightists network, with its
claimed 25,000 members operating underground,
practicing riﬂe shooting and the techniques of
guerilla warfare for the day when “Communism
takes over.” De Pugh in an interview with the
N. Y. Times August 1, 1964, claimed the federal
government is “aready inﬁltrated by Communists.”
If to Robert Welch, Eisenhower is a “card-carrying
Communists” De Pugh can certainly ﬁnd many
“full-ﬂedged reds” in the Kennedy-Johnson ad-
minstration. He told the Times his outﬁt will use
underground sabotage tactics through inﬁltration
of the campaign machinery of the Democrats, to
boost Go1dwater’s drive. Johnson he said “would
sell the United States out to Communists.”

Upon the withdrawal of Governor Wallace of
Alabama from the presidential race ——- a signal
for all racists to rally to Goldwater —— heads of
Klan organizations of state after state announced
endorsement of the Arizonian as did the White
Citizens Councils and other racist outﬁts in the
South. Moreover, Wallace’s campaign in several
northern states paved the way for launching a
drive to establish White -Citizens Councils in
northern areas to incite racist strife and exploit
it for Goldwater.

Why They Love Him

Like Noah’s ark, Goldwater’s tent has attracted
every variety of animal in the reactionary net-
work because he has a record that pleases all
of them. One measure of Goldwater’s mind and
deeds is his political score compiled» by the AFL-
CIO’s Committee for Political Education (COPE).
In 53 roll call during his two terms in the Sen-
ate, Goldwater voted 100 percent “wrong” against
every measure favored by the AFL-CIO. That
means he voted against every proposal that to any
degree meant improvement of an economic and
social welfare nature, civil rights, women's rights,
beneﬁts for youth or reduction of world tensions.

As is known, the leaders of the AFL-CIO on
occasions favor coldwar bills not supported by many
progressives and activists in the peace movement.
They count votes in favor of such negative meas-
ures as “Right.” But even on such bills Goldwater
cast a “Nay” vote because he favored something
still farther to the right. On the other hand the vot-
ing records compiled by Americans for Constitu-
tional Action and Civic Affairs Associates, both
ultra-Right political research outﬁts, give Gold-
water a 100 percent “right” rating.

Goldwater voted against the test—ban treaty,
civil rights, all bills to combat poverty or rehabili-
tate Appalachia and similar depressed areas.
medicare, minimum wage, unemployment insur-
ance or social security improvements or a cut in
taxes. He opposed abolition of the poll tax, a bill to
end literacy tests to qualify voters and against
-cloture or change in Rule 22 to limit ﬁlibusters.
He opposed several time the extension of unem-
ployment insurance duration for long-term unem-
ployed in periods of recession. He voted against
provisions in the trade bill that provide certain re-
lief for workers thrown out of work by imports.
He opposed bills for assuring to Mexican migratory
workers 9-0 percent of the going wage rate in
Southwest ﬁelds.

Goldwater voted for every reactionary measure
that came before the Senate since 19-53 his ﬁrst
year in Congress. He voted against a measure to
send government contracts to areas of heavy un-
employment. Every bill to res-trict labor rights and
toughen the Taft-Hartley Law, the Brownell-But-

14

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

ler Bill to require government licensing of unions
(based on anti-Communist clearance) and bills to
facilitate suits against unions. All had Goldwater’s
vote. When the Landrum-Grfﬁn Bill was up, Gold-
water voted for the most extreme ‘provision-s, many
of which were not enacted. Every effort to under-
mine the Supreme C'ourt’s decision or emasculate
its rulings on civil rights, civil liberties, election
reform reapportionment, had Barry Goldwater’s
unfailing vote.

The employers always had his vote for give-
aways. He twice voted for giveaway of U.S. off-
shore oil to the oil interests. He voted for cancel-
lation of a German $2 billion debt. A bill to unload
U.S.-owned plants at ridiculously low prices had
his vote. He voted for each tax favor to corpora-
tions and the rich, including the seven percent tax
allowance for corporations that automate and ex-
pand.

As a member of the Senate’s Mleclellan Commit-
tee that was holding hearings on corruption in
unions, Golclwater’s sole concern was to get Walter
Reuther and other leaders of the United Automo-
bile Workers before the committee to question
them about the worst “crime” and “corruption” in
his book —— the union's hard-fought militant
strikes, notably the six-year strike at the Kohler
Co. The UAW stood up to him and Goldwater
regretted this tactic.

Goldwater's Distinction

It is unlikely that anyone in the .Senate could
have as perfect a record against the people as that

built -up by Goldwaten. Even some of the most _

rabid Dixiecrats occasionally cast a positive vote,
to appease their constituents. But Barry Gold-
water ignores even the population of his own state
that has been increasing of late. He is responsible
only to -the small clique who have grown rich and
to that vast expanse of desert and sagebrush.
The box score we have summarized above is
only what might be called the “liberal” side of
Barry Goldwater. It was only his record on just
these measures that came up for a vote in the
Senate. Much of Goldwater’s program, and of his
Birchite and KKK followers is so ultra-reactio-n-
ary that it will take a Goldwater in the White

15

   

    

House and a sweeping Congressional change to
give it a chance for serious consideration. These
forces would liquidate the UN or eject it from the
United States. They want an atomic war N‘-OW.
Goldwater has already called for the use of atomic
weapons in Vietnam. They would abolish social
security, public welfare, and set a limit to taxation
on higher incomes. The -anti-union bills introduced
or co-sponsored by Goldwater now in the Congres-
sional hopper would render unions so ineffective
as to virtually liquidate them. And that is only a
part of the anti-union program long ago envi-
sioned by ultra-Rightist Fred Hartley. It goes with-
out saying that emasculation of the Civil Rights
Law or liquidation would be one of the first steps
if these forces took power. The Supreme Court
rulings ordering reapportionment of voting dis-
tricts to truly equalize the ballot for all Ameri-
cans would be quickly sidetracked.

The hundreds of groups rooting for Goldwater
are ﬂooding the country radio and TV with millions
of leaﬂets and with their sort of poison. But far

too many Americans dismiss i't as nonsense so
fantastic that few can be so gullible as to swallow
the stuff. Forgotten by many was the experience
with the fascist rise in Europe when Hitler’s and
Mussolini’s bands were dismissed as crackpots.
Fascists rise to power on the wave of confusion, ig-
norance, racism, frustration and hysteria brought
on by provocative incidents. Above all, fascism
counts on the disunity of the people and the ab-
sence of progressive leadership for positive ob-
jectives.

AFTER. EXALMINIING what Goldwater repre-
sents, and the people around him, there is
only one possible alternative for the working class,
the Negro people and other sectors of the popu-
lation alled with them — to defeat and throw back
the fascist-like menace at all cost. We in America
should not have to learn the lesson at so high a
cost as that paid by European peoples who experi-
enced fascism.

In this campaign, the choice is not which party
promises or may win MOIRlE for the people. Gold-
waterism doesn't even promise anything. Stripped
of its demagogy, even the GOP platform points
backward, toward elimination of past social-eco-
nomic gains and other progress. G-oldwaterism
would ultimately destroy unions and set America
on the road to fascism. Goldwaterism frankly calls
for war and the use of atomic wealpons even in
the “small” wars now taking place. Goldwaterism
offers no program to combat poverty, denying the
need for such a program. So any speculation or
debate as to whether the common people have al-
ternative weapons in the present situation, is just
idle chatter. And suggestions that the people have
“no alternative” and should boycott the election is
worse than meaningless chatter. It is objective
support to the Goldwater forces who want to see
the opposition immobilized, paralyzed by inaction
and frustration.

What counts with the workers, Negro people,
family farmers and their allied, middle class and
professional peoples in the cities, is the weapon
that can stop Goldwaterism. And the overwhelm-
ing majority of these «politically -most aroused and
conscious people, will take the realistic view of

17

  

 

voting for the Johnson forces whether they agree
or not with everything represented by his adminis-
tration. T-his WILL be the course, no matter how
intense the polemics in some left circles in search
of “alternatives.”

Many Differ With Johnson

Millions of those who will vote for the Johnson
ticket disagree with some of his program, his ap-
proach or the deeds of his administration. As yet
we don’t have in the U.S. anything even approach-
ing a political system that makes a vote for a
party meaningful in a principled sense. Some
day we'll have «such a possibility. But today an
American who takes part in politics, can at best
vote for a candidate who comes closest to his views.
That, admittedly, is very often not very close. Many
do not -agree with President Johnson’s coldwar
position and his readiness to appease Goldwater-
ites as he did by ordering North Vietnam bombed.
Especially «among the Negro people, there are many
who don’t think President Johnson is vigorous
enough against racists and moves slowly -against
Klan murderers. The trade unions, his strongest
support, often criticizes him for the inadequacy of
his economic measures against poverty and his
“wage guides” limiting wage raises in face of the
fantastic record proﬁts. Unions are also critical of
the administration’s trade policy that disregards
the havoc some foreign imports brought in certain
industries here. Certain unions are very bitter over
the settlement in the railroad situation for which
the President was mainly responsible. It was a
serious blow to unionism and cost many thousands
of jobs. The administr-ation’s evasion of the prob-
lem of automation is widely criticized.

Ironic as it may seem, however, it is the very
unions that have the most to criticize, and many
do so openly, which are likely to be the most active
campaigners for the President. They are more con-
cerned with the menace of Goldwaterism than their
differences with the Johnson “administration. To
ot-hers the President is an “aggressive” liberal, con-
tinuer of the Roosevelt tradition. To some he is
just a “moderate” liberal. -Still other-s see him, as
they saw Kennedy and Truman and even Roose-
velt in his earlier stages -as swaying right or left

18

 

 

to pressures (as he did on Vietnam) but more
often to mass popular pressure, depending how
much of it shows.

Among the Negro people generally, there may
be difference with Johnson over his tactical ap-
proach on civil rights, but there is hardly a ques-
tion among them that Johnson .-and the bill he
signed into law represent signiﬁcant progress.
There is already clear indication that the Negro
people will be virtually unanimous in the voting
booth for Johnson. Goldwater to them represents
the road back towards slavery.

In face of the reality and the certainty of what
the mass of people opposing Goldwater WILL do,
it is worse than inaction to talk of voting for “mi-
nority” parties, as some in or around the left sug-
gest. What minority parties, the Conservative
Party, the «States Rights Party, the Prohibiion
Party? Obviously not these. It comes down to the
Trotskyite Socialist Workers Party and the long
dead, ‘but not buried, Socialist Labor Pary. But
those groups on ballots in certain states are best
known for their rabid opposition to peaceful co-
existence and their anti—Soviet propaganda. The
SWP’s position on civil rights follows the line of
Malcolm X, the Black Muslim nationalist leader.
Their role in the unions is disruption and division.
The SLP has no active role. How can support for
either of those groups help defeat Goldwaterism?
Their position can only prove helpful to Goldwater
and his Birchite camxpaigners.

Making The Choice Count

There is however a certain alternative. It is on
the WAY the election campaign of the labor
Negro and general peoples’ movement is conducted.
Active efforts in that direction can have real and
positive inﬂuence on the election. For a long time
there has been talk in inﬂuential union circles
and among liberals and in civil rights organizations
of a political “realignment.” The fact that political
parties are only vehicles in the political ﬁeld, with
the Democratic Party an -umbrella for both the
most extreme reactionaries and racists as well the
most liberal forces, has long frustrated serious
movements for people's political action. Although
much of the past liberalism has been drawn off the

“Party of Lincoln” in recent years, the contradic-
tion of -Gold-waterism vs. a more moderate right
and even some liberals, has split Republicans.

This election may mark the turning point for
the long-developing realignment. Elections of re-
cent years gave steadily increasing evidence that
people are less attached to either of the two parties
and make their choice on the basis of personalities
and issues. This weakening of party loyalty is evi-
dent both among the ultra-Right and among the
liberal democratic people.

Witness how the ultra-Right of both Democratic
and Republican registry rallied to the support of
Goldwater. On the other hand large sections of
nominal Repu-blicans, unable to take Goldwater,
are shifting to Johnson. But those who shift to
either side are not attracted to the political parties.
They are attracted by the issues and records of
the chief personalities.

Both sides in the political struggle -are ﬁnding
out that the old partisanship narrows their appeal.
More than ever they must take into account inde-
pendent movements that may give endorsement to
a candidate but won’t become a part of the candi-
date’s party. For some years the trade unions have
either supported COPE or their own political edu-
cational arms, and they usually make it a point
to stress their independence of political parties.
Very often this claim was only formal with some
union campaigns just tailing the political kites of
the Democratic machines. But more and more
unions are ﬁnding that they can get most effective
political action if the machinery is independent. The
Negro people who percentage-wise turn out more
of their votes for the Democrats than any group,
are even more independent of that party. It need
hardly !be said that the youth and ﬁrst voters have
little attachment to existing poliical parties.

For a United People's Coalition

The current rapid pace of political realignment
demands more than ever an organized and well
coordinated coalition of the people’s forces of which
the Negro-Labor alliance is the major base, that
is strictly independent of political parties. There has
been a loose coalition of sorts for some time that
brought «most uni'ons, the Negro peoples organiza-
tions, family farm groups, mainly those associated

with the National Farmers Union, student groups,
senior citizens organizations and organizations of
various liberals in the professional ﬁelds, peace
movements and such into common political and
legislative action. The civil rights, peace and anti-
poverty movements have tended to jell much of
this coalition in action. The Freedom Mlarch on
Washington in 1963 has certainly contributed
very much in that respect. But the menace of
Goldwaterism and the rightist coalition he heads,
has made an independent people’s coalition more
urgent than ever. Moreover, the situation widens
the potential base for this coalition.

This is why the conﬂicts over job discrimination
that broke out ‘between certain unions and the Ne-
gro communities on occasion have been very harm-
ful to the historic Negro-Labor alliance. Such an
alliance is an imperative =pillar for a firm peoples’
coalition. Conversely, the Goldwater camp is most
happy to see rifts between the unions and the Ne-
gro people and raci'al tensions.

Fortunately, with enactment of the Civil
Rights Law the trade unions entered a new and
higher stage in the struggle against discrimination.
The new initiative opens with the national con-
ference of AFL-CIO organizatons from all over
the country in Washington Sept. 2. This is Just one
of the developments that promises to revitalize the
Negro-Labor Alliance.

Most encouraging in that respect has been the
experience in Oklahoma last Spring, when a rela-
tively weak labor movement was able to defeat
the “ri~ght—to-work” anti union amendment initi-
ated by the rightists mainly because it entered into
a coalition with the Negro, small farmers and
senior citizens organizations. '

In trade -union ranks, for ex=ample, it appears
that for the ﬁrst time in their history all unions
will officially -be runanimous on poliical endorse-
ment. Those in top or lower leadership who have
been nominal Republicans have hastened to repu-
diate Goldwater. But none of them are shiftinx
loyalty to the Democratic Party. The same is true
of about a third of the trade unionists who, polls
showed, traditionally vote Republican, but are
shifting now. It would be a mistake and ineffective
to appeal to them in the name of the Democratic
Party. The same is true of the Negro, farm and
other groups.

Partisanship can only weaken the campaign of
the peoples’ forces. It is only on the ballot that the
choice is put as Republican vs. Democrat. But in
actual life the issue has become ultra-Right reac-
tion vs. the program of the peoples coalition.
There is a comprehensive peoples program. Much
of it is in the resolutions «of the AFL-C130 or of
its Industrial Union Department‘ conventions; in
the recent conventions of the NAACP, CORE,
the Negro American Labor -Council; and in the
recent convention of the National Farmers Union.
The -convention of the United Automobile Workers
last March contributed very much, especially the
anti-po-verty program that was approved. Also an
important part has come from the many organ-
izations active for peace. There is unity on most of
the essentials of this program that goes also for the
Communists, the Socialist Party headed by Norman
Thomas and the Marxist youth movement.

What The People Want

In summary that program calls for:

. Further steps to secure peace and towards
disarmament. Abolition of atomic weapons. Con-
tinuation of the concept that war is inconceivable,
and different social sys-terns can live and compete
in peace on this planet.

. Implementation of the civil rights law with
speed on all fronts.

0 A steady reduction of arms exrpeditures; shift
of billions of funds for a far more expanded anti-
poverty drive with emphasis on the Negro com-
munities.

o A sweeping expansion of education, full
integration of schools; major attention to the
neglected Negro populated areas.

0 A $2.00 minimum wage and expansion of
coverage to uncovered workers.

. More adequate social security beneﬁts and
enactment of medical care for the aged.

0 The 35-hour Week; a federal program to meet
-automation problems to protect workers from loss
of jobs.

0 Drastic upward revision of unemployment
insurance and uniform standards.

0 A far more expanded program to provide
employment opportunities for youth.

. Repeal of the Taft-Hartley, Landr-um-Griffin

and state “right-to-work” laws.

0 Enactment of laws outlawing professional
strikebreakers.

. Congressional reform to modernize and demo-
cratize both houses.

. Speedy implementation of the Supreme Court’s
ruling on reapportionment of election districts.

. Human conditions for migratory workers.

0 A federal farm program mainly directed for
the protection of the farmer.

0 Consumer protection through more vigorous
prosecution of price ﬁxers, enactment of stringent
laws on medicines, truth-in-packaging and truth-
in-lending. ‘

. Enforcement of laws for -protection of women
and an expanded program for child-care centers
and other ways to help children and working
mothers. '

. More vigorous defense of constitutional liber-
ties and elimination of the remnants of McCarthy-
ism.

-Consideralbly more can be added to this program.
Much of it is in the form of bills, but pigeon-holed.
Much awaits a Congress «and climate in which
passage is possible. Oif one afact we can be positive:
Sen. Goldwater would not vote for any one of them.
There isn't a chance for any of them, if Goldwater
get into the White House. A victory over Gold-
waterism would open wide the road, and lend
impetus for a fresh an-d long needed, advance
in social-economic legislation. And much will
depend on whether the menace is beaten by a
narrow or overwhelming margin. This is why so
much will depend on how effectively labor and
other peoples turn out the vote on election day.

LABOR
AND THE MENACE
OF GOLDWATERISM

By George Morris

BARRY M. GOLDWATER. would throw us back
to the Harding-Coo1idge—I-Ioover era, runs a wide-
spread opinion. Others see him as just a conserva-
tive businessman who looks nostalgically farther
back to the last century of robber barons, intense
exploitation of workers and nothing like social
security, minimum wage or any social weliare. His
rabid anti-‘Communism and war incitement reveals
him to many as an atom-maniac. His position on
civil rights has made -him the darling of those who'd
return America to the worst days of lynch 1-aw.
His notorious anti-unionism is «another widely
accepted image of him. To many he . is the front
man of an incipient fascist movement that has
gained ground in recent years.

Each of those characterizations of Goldwater is
true. But there is something more to him that tops
them all in importance. Barry M. Goldwater is -all
those evils rolled into one. He has become the
uniﬁer and overall voice of a reactionary octopus

more dangerous than any in world history. The
forces rallying around him are playing for far
bigger stakes than had -been up in any past power
struggle in the world. They bid -for control in this
nuclear weapons missiles age of the most powerful
capitalist country on earth — and for no less than
the authority to pull the switch that could wipe
out all life on this planet.

Throughout our history there were many election
campaigns in which reactionary forces tended to
gravitate towards a certain candidate. The cam-
paigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt when he faced
the forces of reactionaries combined in monopoly-
ﬁnanced outﬁts like the “Liberty League” and
“America First” are still remembered by many.
But never before have such a wide variety of
reactionary movements been brought together as
are now gathered in the Goldwater tent. It includes
all the anti-‘union forces on the map, the racists
both of the south and north, the military—industrial
complex that lives on the cold war and drives
for a hot war, all of the many hundreds of fascist
and neo-‘fascist outﬁts th-at mushroomed in recent
years and the assortment of “lunatic-fringe” ele-
ments that reﬂect the widespread mental instability
of our time.

Most signiﬁcant now, as the campaign rolls on,
is that this assortment of ultra-Rightists are not
just riding on the eoattails of the dominant his-
torical conservative support of the Republican
Party. They captured it. They set its policy. They
run it.

In his efforts to gain a “better” public appeal
and to placate some Republican leaders who
couldn’t swallow his open association with the
ultr-a—Rightists, Goldwater found it necessary to
issue public disclaimers of his quest of support
from those groups. Those statements came as some
Republican leaders, including Gen. Eisenhower,
Governors Rockefeller and Scranton and others
who opposed Goldwater's nomination gathered
for a “-unity” session. Goldwater simply appeased
them with a “face saver” to make i “easier” for
these leaders to declare support for him after they
denounced his lavish praise of the ultra-Rightists
at the Republican convention.

Goldwater apparently also believed that a state-
ment from him would induce millions of voters
to forget his years of association with the extreme
reactionary groups.

The racist, anti-Semitic, anti-labor groups
understand Goldwater's tactic. Only a. few days
after Goldwater said he wasn't seeking the support
of the Ku Klux Klan, Robert M. Shelton, Imperial
Wizard of the United Klans of America, the
national head of KKK, publicly restated his
endorsement of the Republican candidate (N. Y.
Times, Aug. 13) and directed his followers every-
where to work for him. Goldwater's disclaimers
of other ultra-Rightist connections are Just as
meaningless.

Most signiﬁcant, however, Goldwater stoutly
defended the John Birch Society. Far from repudi-
ating association with it, he welcomed its support.
Many of Goldwater's most active backers are
Birchites. The GOP convention’s refusal to even
condemn “extremism” without mention of JBS by
name, was plain evidence of that for all to see. 
Birch Society is the key Rightist organization linked
to big business and to most other major ultra-Right
organizations.

The Mulﬁ-Front Approach

Unfortunately, many Americans tended to under-
estimate the power and danger of the ultra-Rightist
outﬁts. They were swayed by publicity, dismissing
most of them as too crazy to get mass support.
Many found it hard to believe that the racism and
anti-Semitism of those outﬁts and their blatant
anti‘-unionism, could draw many backers. Experi-
ence has brought many of us to a sad awakening.

Just as the old “party of Lincoln” provides the
shelter an-d “respectable” mass cover for the
“extremists” of every stripe, so have the organiza-
tions of the major industrial monopolies in the
country taken them und-er their ﬁn-ancial and
“respectable” wings. Those outﬁts are skillfully
adapted for their special ﬁelds of anti"-union, anti-
Negro, race-inciting, anti-Semitic, warmongering
and other activities on the reactionary assembly
line. Many in our labor mov-ement have tended to
pay attention to only those reactionary outﬁts that
seemed speciﬁcally concerned with -anti-unionism.
The multi-front approach of the employers has in
the recent period led unions to study the tactic.
More and more it is becoming apparent that labor
and its allies cannot effectively meet the enemy
on Just one front.

 

The A.~FL-CI»O’s political arm, the Committee for
Political Education has in fact begun a campaign
of education in the trade unions for a gen-
eral counter-movement to meet the ultra-
Right. A COPE pamphlet issued in 1963 titled
“Don’t Be Fooled, The Target Is You” noted that
“more than 1,000 right wing organizations blanket
the nation.” Subsequently, COPEE (Sept. 9, 1-963)
printed in its bulletin a chart showing how the
John Birch Society, the topmost rightist outﬁt, is
the hub that links together 93 major rightist outﬁts
by a network of hundreds of interlocking sponsors,
council members and executives and that the
persons directing JBS link it with scores of leading
corporations in which they are top executives.
And this is just ONE .SECTOR of the camp that
backs Goldwater. True, it i's the most powerful
sector in terms of ﬁnances and “status” in our
monopoly-run capitalist society. But there is also
the network, like that of the Minutemen armed
bands, that operates further underground and the
network of Klan and White Citizens Clotuncils
concentrated in the states of the old Confederacy.

Tools of Big Business

Earlier last year, the United Automobile Workers
published an exposure of the ultra-Right. In th:at
study it was shown how the major 15 rightist
outﬁts are linked through interlocking executives
to the four major employer outﬁts in the country
— the National Association otf Manufacturers, the
U. S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Right to
Work Committee and t-he Farm Bureau Federation
(the latter is the chief anti-union arm in the farm
and rural areas). Certain of these outﬁts like the
John Birch .Society and Manion Forum are linked
with all four employers outﬁts.

The directing bodies and sponsors of each of
those outﬁts reads more like a who's-who in busi-
ness and some names come up on the list of many
organizations. Corporations, it appears, want to «be
sure they have men on the many rightist executive
bodies to see that their money is well spent.

Most prominent on those lists are heads of
notorious union-busting ﬁrms. William J. Grede
of J. I. Case, the company that tried to get rid of
the UAW in a long strike, was former NAM
president and is on the Birch Council as on a
dozen other outﬁts. Ernest G. Swigert and Cola G.
Parker, also former NAM presidents are in leading

positions in JBS and numerous associated outﬁts.
Roger Milliken, who shut down his big textile
plant at Deering, N. C. and liquidated it after the
Textile Union won a b-arg'ai‘ning election, is another
prominent name. Also among the favored are
officials of the Kohler Co. of Wisconsin, where the
UAW had to wage a six-year strike to get a union
contract.

Within this right-wing complex are also the
many military men who are connected with com-
panies proﬁting‘ from government orders. Listed
in Birch leadership and other groups, are Lt. Gen.
Charles B. Sone, Gen. A. C. Wedemeyer, Lt. Gen.
James R. Riseley, Cbl. W. Bruce Pirnie, Maj. Gen.
C. A. Willoughby, Vice Admiral T. G. W. Settle,
Lt. Gen. Edward M. Almond, Vice Admiral C. S.
Freeman, former Ad-miral Ben Moreel and many
others. And there are many medical men promin-
ent in the American Medical Association, linking
th-at outﬁt with the Birchites and other rightist

7

 

  

groups on whose program opposition to medicare
is very high.

Most of these 93 outﬁts linked to the Birch
Society have branches or oﬂices throughout the
country. A similar chart could illustrate the rightist
complex on a local or regional scale in every part
of America. It is noteworthy that the lists of right-
its have almost no Negroes or labor people. Jews
of even conservative hue are repelled by the
stench of anti-Semitlsm that is. strong in those
circles.

The only Negroes in evidence within the rightist
orbit -are the old discredited lackeys, Max Yergen
and George W. Schuyler. They are listed on the
Committee for Aid to Katanga Freedom Fighters
(Tshom-be the murderer of Patrice Dumumba).
And, believe it or not, on the same committee was
one Arthur G. McDowell, a professional anti-
Communist who is also a staff member of the
Upholsterers International Union. But that's about
the size of the “labor” representation.

Birchite Subsidiaries

Let’s take a closer look at some of the major
outﬁts that make up the ultra-Rightist network.
There is, of course, the John Birch Society, the
largest and most widespread. The extent of its
work can be judged from the disclos-ure by Robert
Welch, its fuehrer, that $2 milli-on was spent in
1963, mostly for print-ed material. The Birchite
budget for 1964 is reported to be $4 million. The
JBS forces are the most ardent campaigners for
Goldwater. Almost everywhere, scratch a local
Goldwater campaign leader and you’re likely to
ﬁnd a Birc-h member.

But there are other groups whose sponsorship
is heavily loaded with names from the Birch list.
The Manion Forum or “The Committee for Equal
Anti-Trust Law Protection” (to prosecute unions
as trusts) has also all the leading lights of JBS
including Welch. That Forum ha-s a radio program
with outlets to 245 communities. The Christian
Crusade of Billy James Hargis with radio outlets
in 200 cities, is also loaded heavily with Birc-hites,
including Welch. The American Committee to Aid
Con-go Freedom Fighters, wa-s another heavy col-
lection of names on the Birch list. Another Birchite

8

 

  

front was the “Committee Against Summit En-
t-anglements,” that not only is packed with many
Birchite sponsors but has Welch for its" chairman
and William J. Grede as vice-ncfhairman. This com-
mittee agitated against Eisenhower’s meeting with
Khrushchev.

The outfit that has the heaviest representation of
Birclhites on its list of sponsocrs is YA1F, Young
Americans for Freedom, the main rightist organ-
ization on the campuses. In effect YAF is the
“youth” division of the Birch Society and enjoys
the greatest number of Birchite military men and
business executives on its controlling bodies.

Companies represented on the Birch list and
interlocked with the directorships of the 93 organ-
izations we mentioned, are not small potatoes. In-
cluded are executives from American Brakeshoe;
Avco Manufacturing, Boeing Aeroplane, Carrier
C'onp., J 1. Case, Chrysler, Deering Milliken, Inc.,
First National Bank of Boston, First National City
of New York, General Motors Truck, W. R. Grace
8; Co., Great Northern Oil, Grede Foundries, Inc.,
International Paper, International Telephone and
Telegraph, Jones & Daughlin, Louisville & Nash-
ville R.R., National Bank of Detroit, Raytheon Co.,
Sears, Roebuck & Co., Sun Oil Co., Sun Shi=pbuild-
ing, Southern Oalifomia Edison, Texas Steel, U.S.
Gypsum, U.S. Steel, Wagner Electric and many,
many more.

The Real Investors

Those companies are apparently ﬁnding out that
they can get much more anti-union mileage out of
the kind of poison, division and strife the ultra-
Rightists spread in the communties than by the
traditional straight anti-union techniques. They are

investing heavily in the rightist network, just as

they invested millions in industrial spy agencies.
For example,. the major center for the ﬁlms, books
and other propaganda material for the rightist
network is the National Education Program, Hard-
ing College, Ark., run by Dr. George Benson.
COPE notes that a $300,000 donation from Alfred
Sloan, former president of General Motors, gave
Benson the start for that enterprise. The rightist
money raisers stress that the contributions are tax-
deductible.
