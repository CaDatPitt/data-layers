The RILU pointed out how the capitalists use the

betray the Workers by their attitude to the colonial
_ Workers and the unorganized workers, how the re-

' ' ' against the capitalists. The RILU had already estab-
‘ lished contact with the colonial workers through the
‘H Pan-Pacific Secretariat and the Latin American
Secretariat and had made direct contact with the
Negro workers of South Africa. The RILU did‘ not
look down upon Negro and colored workers as des-
picable pebple as the Amsterdam International does.
This was h-ow the RILU was creating the real Inter-
national and establishing International solidarity.

 _ «Preparations for Conference of Negro Workers
And now comrades this brings me directly to the'

Negro question as taken up at the fourth Congress
ofthe RILU. While discussing the activities of sec-
tions in the USA, France, Britain and South Africa
and their tasks amongst the Negro workers, special
attention was paid to the Negro workers.’ It was
‘found however, that there had been many Weaknesses
in these sections in their work amongst Negroes. But
long before the Fourth Congress, the Negro question
had received serious attention in the Executive Bu-
reau of the RILU. ‘" N
In 1929 I was a delegate at the Second World Con-
gress of the League Against Imperialism, held at
Frankfort, Germany, and while there took the oppor-

' tunity to call a few meetings in the name of our com-
mittee, of all the Negro delegates Who had come for
the Congress of the League Against Imperialism (from

_, USA, West Indies and Africa). Asidefrom the special

_._15__

 

 

 

questions taken up at the Congress of the League, We
discussed the problems. and the question of trade
union organization amongst the Negro workers. We
decided that an International Conference of Negro
workers for this purpose should be called. A Provi-
sional Committee was elected for this purpose.‘ This
Conference today is the result of our work. I will not
go into the details of how we carried on our Work, of
the difficulties encountered, these are already Well
known to many of you here and other facts will come
out later. I want to go comrades, to the second part
of my report, and that is how the Negro people fare
under capitalism.

Capitalist Oppression of the Negro Masses

Now comrades we Negroes cannot forget the result
of the effects of the past upon us—the fact that for
over 300 years over 100,000,000 Negroes were torn

from the shores of Africa to be brought into the n pl

slave markets of the new world, America and the West
Indies by the capitalists and their agents, and that
on the basis of Negro slavery and slave labor they
built up their capitalist power and wealth-—and we

must ask, during these 300 years or during these last ,. '
.100 years or during this day and time, what has it

brought us? Not only during this period of slave
traffic did it bring untold misery, this is a question
we are familiar,with, but it left us everywhere in
ignorance and degradation, and despite the boast of
a small upper strata of Negroes in the USA and
other places, the facts are that the great masses of
Negroes the World over were brought up in ignorance,

were leftin ignorance and degradation by deliberate__ ,_

ternity and Liberty,” “make the World safe for small
minorities” “God Save the Kings’ Land” and so on,
since that war, We see, our exploitation and oppres-
sion goes on in a more intensified manner and form
under every imperialist power.

But during the war we learned some things. Many
of us first of all learned the class nature -of the
imperialist war, that thewar was fought for ,the

imperialist powers, ‘that they fought among other’

things to subjugate colonial lands, to further exploit
colonial peoples. That the white Workers too were
murdered (by each’ other) for the imperialists, We
saw during the course of this War that the revolu-
tionary workers.overthrovv capitalism in one country

'—in sRu_s'sia—and that a Workers’ and Peasant’s state

was. set up and rules today. We have learned com-
rades, that in order for us to gain our freedom We
must also organize our forces for a struggle against
imperialism and capitalism. i

We are at this moment in a position to do this and “

have the forces in which we can base our Work. The
war created a big army of Negro workers, in South
Africa, in West Africa, in the West Indies, in the
USA—millions of Negro proletarians. It is the Negro
workers, brought up in capitalist industry (just as
the white workers have been brought up), who find
from bitter experience the need for struggle against

capitalism, who have the stability‘; the courage, the L
discipline and that are class conscious, on Which ’
to effectively organize their forces for the liberation’

of the Negro people as a whole.

FOREWORD ' 

  The FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF

NEGRO WORKERS was held at Hamburg, Germany, \
in 1930. ’ The deliberations of that Conference should 
have been studied by wide masses of Workers, ‘not 
only by Negro workers and intellectuals, but by
white Workers and sympathizers of the Negro libera- _,,
tionstruggle. The Conference made a thorough ana- 
lysis of the economic and political situation of the )
Negro people, and gave a clear picture of capitalist- 
imperialist oppression. It was a workers’ Confer-G C
ence, and therefore, laid down a program of trade
union organization. Nevertheless, it took up 0'
 problems of the Negro people as a Whole aw):-“V

,;  nected up the struggles of the Negro Wor=‘¢i£le.. ,

 the national liberation struggle. The Conference Was

jg» notenot like the petty—bourgeois led conferences, many-
 of Which have been held, and which confine their
program and activities to the interest of, and lament
and Whine about, the upper class Negroes; No, this
Conference was of a different character, it was of

a Working class character. ,

There Was representation of eleven trade unions,
two-national trade union centers, one political party
(Nigeria) and two non—trade union international or- 
ganizations, There were seventeen regular and three
fa ' fraternal delegates from seven countries (principally.
Africa, West Indies and the United States), reprf 
senting 20,000 organized Workers. Great difficulties M”
were placed in the way of the delegates by local V
 colonial governments, by prohibiting‘ them passports 1
i  and by intimidation; delegates were also harassed w
on their arrival in Europe by detectives of the Brit- .. 7“

A place the burden of the crisis on the backs of the

workers, _ see unemployment increasing throughout
the World, We find that alone in the USA, of the six
or more millions of unemployed workers at least
500,000 are Negro Workers who are faced with starv-
ation, the same in South Africa, in the West Indies
and so on. The imperialists are trying to place the

" burden of this crisis especially on the backs of the

colonial people and on the backs of the natives of
Africa———in all the parliaments the Socialist leaders
are helping the capitalists by voting specialmeasures
and bills for the more intense exploitation of the
Workers in these lands. . I

In every capitalist country the Workers are fight-

ing against this capitalist crisis by street fighting 7

and by mass demonstrations. There is a militant
struggle of workers everywhere. The Indian Revo-
lution is rising, the Chinese workers are building
a Red Army and have established a Soviet of Work-
ers and peasants in a large section of China. To

this, notice must be taken of the struggles of the .

Negro workers. Big and serious struggles of the

.N=egro working masses have taken place against cap-

italist exploitation in different parts of Africa, the

West Indies and the USA, during the last period, of ,

which you will report on here.

is quite easily to be understood Why ‘the colony is

- entirely in the hands of an international margarine

concern, which is the undisputed boss of the whole

territory. The Workers of this colony are organized-
inrtrade unions and when the ‘manager of the com-
pany demanded their leaving them, a general strike ,
was declared. The strikers, in spite of the terror’

,’practiced by very strong military detachments that
Thad been concentrated in Bathrust, the capital of
1 the colony and center of the strike, did not surrender

and the administration was obliged to recognize the
Workers’ right for organization.

Haiti

A very strong anti-imperialist movement exists in

Haiti, the formally independent Negro republic which i

is practically a colony of the USA. Owing to the
acute agrarian‘ crisis and directed against the Amer-
can puppet-President Borno, a revolt broke out in the
country 11 1929. The U. S. sent large detachments of

_marine forces, airplanes, and cruisers to aid in sup-
7 pressing the revolt.
1 dent Hoover thought -it necessary to make some con-

Though they succeeded, Presi-

cessions. A special commission Was created to in-
vestigate the causes of the revolt and at the same
time the resignation of the President was promised.
It is quite obvious that these concession will not
satisfy the Workers of Haiti who will have to fight

A ”‘ . again and again until they at last throw off the yoke
of imperialism.

In South‘Africa serious struggles of the workers
have been conducted.

In the U. S. the Negro Work- ‘
hers are fast joining the Trade Union Unity League.

Negro Trade Union Reformist Leaders 

‘In all these places the Negro trade union reform-
ist fakers have shown their true colors of betrayal.
In South Africa, Kadalie has betrayed the native
workers by joining them up with the Amsterdam
International——th,e chauvinist organization and tool
of international capitalism. In the United States A.
P. Randolph brought the Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters into the Jim-Crow American Federation
of Labor.  ,

Comrades, capitalism is in a severe crisis. The next .
steps are to organize the battles of the workers," we r.
must here give consideration to all these questions.  
We must raise the signal of REVOLT. We must '
 point out. how to organize to fight against class ex-‘(W
ploitation and race oppression, we must make it clear
and declare that our struggles. are a part of the
international struggle against capitalism, we must
organize our forces to this end, drawing from the
experiences and lessons of our class brothers in
China and India, in the capitalist countries and from». g ;
the workers and peasants in the Soviet Union. V We 
must give special attention to the question of the I
new imperialist war especially being designed against
the USSR, and the use that the capitaists intend to
' make of Negro soldiers in this war. Our conference
must give active leadership and support to the strug-
gles of the Negro workers throughout the world and
to do this we must indicate practical organizational
steps and tasks. Comrades, if we do this, we will 
have gone a long way towards justifying our efforts 
and towards winning the Negro workers for the inter- 
national class struggle against capitalism. Our battle
cry must be “DOWN WITH IMPERIALISM!”
