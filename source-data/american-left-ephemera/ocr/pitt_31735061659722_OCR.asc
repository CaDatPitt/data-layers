six months the Red Army and the Soviet nation withstood
from the German Army the mightiest blow ever delivered

» against any people in all history. They suﬂ°ered huge losses

in manpower, in material and in territory. They faced an
organized system of barbarous atrocities against their
civilian population such as the modern world has never
known.

Nevertheless, the Red Army was able, despite all its

losses and in the midst of terrible winter weather, to go
over onto a great offensive all along the two-thousand-
mile Eastern Front. For the first time in the ten years
since Japan invaded Manchuria, a fascist aggressor power
was forced to ﬁght on the defensive. To‘ the amazement
and admiration of the world, the Red Army is now, slash-
ing into Hitler’s army, striking when and where it (not
he) decides, in a ﬁerce eﬁort to destroy the Nazis’ man-

power and material and thereby weaken or make impos— ,

sible Hitler’s planned spring offensive. The development

of the great Soviet oﬁensive, after the terriﬁc assault of

the German Army, is unquestionably one of the greatest
(if it is not the very greatest) military achievement in all
the long annals of war. A
The offensive of the Red Army is probably the central
turning point in the World War. It should be made. the

our air, naval and military strength is not yet at its maxi-
mum. The success of the American Navy’s sudden attack
upon the Gilbert and Marshall Islands is a striking
example of this effectiveness of offensive tactics. But,
above all, it is necessary for us and our allies to go over to
the offensive in the European zone of war. Hitler’s pro-
jected spring oifensive must be broken up at all costs
before it can get well under way. This is the supreme need
today of the democratic powers in this War.

To develop a general offensive against Hitler, the
creation of a new European front by Great Britain and the
United States is imperative. The A.E.F. recently landed
in Ireland should be the forerunner of a great army of
millions of American soldiers. The United States should
pour men and munitions into the European zone in. un-
precedented quantities. The situation demandsthat such a
force, together with Great Britain’s big, highly—trained
and thoroughly-equipped army, should build a Western
front and take Hitler in the rear. Hitler must becrushed
in the deadly pincers of a two—front war. The Anglo-
American forces, supported by the rebellious peoples of
the occupied countries, should and could march eastward,
while the conquering Red Army storms on Westward, until
the two armies meet and shake hands, somewhere in Ger-
many, over the dead body of the Nazi regime.

Comp|acency—Our Number One Infernal Enemy '

In order ‘that the United States develop the determina—
tion to take the oifensive it is absolutely necessary that we
free ourselves from our present gross habits of over—con—
ﬁdence. This complacency is our number one «internal

1 1

 

 
 

enemy. We simply must get rid of the widely prevalent
notion that we cannot lose the war; that we will
win as a matter of course. We must stop drugging our-
selves with easy assurances that We are the richest and
most eﬂicient people, that our industrial system is the
strongest on earth, and that therefore the Axis powers can-
not possibly stand against us. We must stop boasting of
our own greatness and quit underestimating the enemy.

Where such illusions can lead to we saw all too clearly at

Pearl Harbor, where our Army and Navy oﬁicials com-
pletely underestimated the audacity and Villainy of Japan,
with resultant disaster. Similar criminal negligence, based
also on stupid complacency, led to the destruction of the
great steamer, the Normandie.

True, the United States has great potential military
strength, but wars are won with actual weapons, not with
future potentialities , and in real war forces we are still
relatively weak. We must realize clearly that we are in a
life—and—death struggle with powerful and resolute foes;
that our national independence is at stake, and that only if
we develop an all—out and relentless struggle can we and
our allies emerge Victoriously from the present momen-
tous World, War. Such an indomitable ﬁghting spirit is
indispensable if our country is to secure the great advan~

tage of ﬁghting on the offensive.

Nowhere do we need more urgently to ﬁght against
complacency and overconﬁdence and to develop the spirit
of the oﬁensive, than in the ﬁeld of production. Here
especially are we doping ourselves with glittering statistics
about our industrial prowess. The threatening menace of
Nazi Germany in Europe and of Japan in the Far East

12

 

l

 

should be warning signals to us that we must plunge into
war production as never before. President Roosevelt’s
60,000 airplanes, 4-5,000 tanks and 8,000,000 tons of
shipping can be produced, but only after intelligent and
strenuous effort on our part. The United States can meet
all the munitions demands being made upon it by our
allies, but only with resolute production action. The gov-
ernment must take a more decisive part in production and
organized labor must, along the lines of the Murray Plan,
be given a real voice in industry. The job of war produc-
tion cannot be left simply to the employers, with their
widespread proﬁteering, resistance to plant expansion, and
opposition to converting their industries onto a War. basis.

More Democracy Will Strengthen
Our Nation's War Effort

Also we must be on guard to preserve our basic liberties.
Here, too, there can be no room for complacency. Hitler
can be defeated only by democratic countries, and there
are many sinister forces in the United . States-——the
Hoovers, Lindberghs, Dieses, Hearsts, Coughlins, Nor-
man Thomases, etc., who are eagerly seeking to exploit the
war situation in order to push our country along the road
toward fascism. To prosecute the war successfully the
government has to adopt various centralizing measures, as
we have already seen. But the reactionaries try to distort
these necessary government controls and disciplines into
dangerous attacks upon the people’s rights. The United
States can and must emerge from this War more demo-
cratic than when it went in; but it will do this only if the

13

  

 

people, especially the trade unions, are on the alert to de~
fend and expand our democratic institutions.
A great and vital task‘ in strengthening American de-

'mocracy and in winning the War is to secure the freedom

of Earl Browder. America should not tolerate the un-
speakable outrage of this great anti-fascist ﬁghter being
kept in jail. Browder’s brilliant abilities are urgently
needed by the American people in this war ‘crisis. In
unmistakable terms the people should demand his release.
BroWder’s imprisonment is a threat against all American
democracy, to our whole ﬁght against Hitlerism.

Labor's Tasks and Duﬁes in ’rhe War

In these crucial days, with the basic need of the United
States and its allies to go over to the offensive in order to
smash the Axis.powers, organized labor bears a heavy
share of responsibility. Labor’s fullest possible participa-
tion in, the War effort is needed———to consolidate national
unity, to help strengthen the government’s anti-Hitler
policy, to change our present complacency into ﬁghting
militancy, to speed up production, to develop civilian de-
fense, to buttress our democracy, to ﬁght the insidious ﬁfth
column, to protect the health and eﬂiciency of the Workers.
To help accomplish these ends, the C.I.O., A. F. of L.
and Railroad Brotherhoods should demand full represen-
tation in the President’s Cabinet, in all government War
boards, in the management of industry, in the civilian
defense set-up, etc.

And for this organized labor must unite its own ranks.
joint action between the great national labor groups is no

longer just a trade union question..N ow it is a fundamen-
tal national issue of the whole people; a basic measure
necessary for winning the War. Labor everywhere should
hail the recent formation of the A. F. of L.—C.I.O. Victory

r Labor Board, with President Roosevelt as chairman, give

it their heartiest support, and utilize it to develop an all-
labor war program and to mobilize the trade unions to

both federations should be Working in close collaboration
for the winning of the War.

Nor is ‘the Communist Party, despite’ its far lesser
numerical strength, without its heavy duties in these
critical times. These duties and responsibilities We fully
recognize and accept. Our -party has pledged its all to
winning the War against Hitler, and it Will‘ fulﬁll this
pledge to the uttermost. The place for all militant Workers
is in the ranks of the party of which Earl Browder is the
head, the ﬁghting party of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Stalin.

Smash HitIer'sSpring
Offensive—Now!  

BY WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

NEWS dispatches are pouring in from all quarters to

the effect that Nazi Germany is now cooking up a
great offensive for the spring. Obviously Hitler will ex-
haust every means to make this oﬁensive decisive. He is
bleeding all -Europe to get materials to throw against
his enemies. Gambler that he is, he will seek to score a
knockout blow, to win the war before the United States
can develop and throw its full strength into the struggle.
The projected Nazi oﬁensive will be directed against the
U.S.S.R.; it may also take the form of an invasion of
England; maybe a drive through the Near and Middle
East; or it may go down through Spain into the North
African area. A decisiveisuccess by the Nazis in any one of
these directions might be fatal to the United Nations in
the war. Should Hitler be able to weaken seriously the
U.S.S.R. or to overrun England it would be a most serious
disaster to the democratic cause, and it would also be
a catastrophe should he succeed in capturing the Mediter-
ranean zone and pushing through the Middle East,
thereby establishing contact with E the Japanese in: -the
Far East.

The Danger of Hitler's Spring Offensive

From all this it should be perfectly clear that the great
present—day task of the United States, as well as of the
United Nations as a whole, is to take every step to defeat
Hitler’s planned spring oﬁensive. All means must be
exerted to prevent this oﬁensive from taking shape, and
to smash it when it comes. This means that We have to
increase vastly our munitions aid to the U.S.S.R. and
Great Britain, and also to adopt energetic measures to get
a big American armediforce into the European war zone
as quickly as possible. The outcome of the War, the fate of
world democracy, may well depend upon whether or not
the United Nations Wake up fully and quickly to the
danger that now confronts them and crush Hitler’s offen-
sive in the egg.

Meanwhile, what about Japan? Obviously serious
attention must also be paid to this brutal aggressor, who
is now having such spectacular success in the Far East.
This is one war, so Japan’s victories are also Hitler’s.
Hong Kong is lost and so‘ is Manila; the Philippines and
Malaya have been overrun; Singapore has fallen; the
Dutch East Indies and Burma are in peril; even Aus-
tralia and India are threatened, and the struggle of the
Chinese people has been made much more diﬂicult.
_Iapan’s conquests in the Far East constitute a world
menace. It is true that despite her big Victories there are
basic Weaknesses in Japan’s position. She has over a mil-
lion soldiers tied up in her hopeless War in China, as well
as several hundred thousand more immobilized along the
Soviet frontiers; besides this, Japan’s far-ﬂung bases and

4-

 

 

long lines of communications are highly vulnerable, her
industrial system is relatively weak, and her whole
economy has been undermined by the long Chinese war.

The Backbone of fhe Axis-—Nazi Germany

Nevertheless, Japan is a tough customer, and the United

States plus the British, Chinese, Dutch, Australians,

Filipinos and other peoples ﬁghting her, have a great
task on hand to subdue her. But there is no room for panic
over the Japanese advance, such as Hearst and other ﬁfth
columnists are now trying to create. If Japan has been able
to make such spectacular headway this is due not so much
to her own great strength, as to the incredible military
stupidities committed by leading American and British
oﬂicers at Pearl Harbor and Singapore. By a combination
of gross complacency and general ignorance of the meth-
ods of modern warfare they handed Japan big victories
on a silver platter. It would be Wild folly to try to correct
these costly mistakes by rushing into a bigger one; that is,
by relaxing our present pressure against Hitler, by halting
our aid to the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain in the European
war zone, as Hitler and Hearst want us to do. That would
be to invite an overwhelming disaster and might Well
cause the loss of the War.

Senator Pepper of Florida (New York Times, Feb. 14)
also puts this vital question squarely:

“The fulcrum of this war liesin Russia, no matter how
ominous are the signs in other parts of the world. . . . Let
the Russian front break, let the Russian army deteriorate,
let the stream of Russian supplies be cut off, and the ﬂood
of Hitlerism will inundate every area of the earth... . .

5

 

    

    

The Russian front,” he said, “must be strengthened at al~
most any sacriﬁce.”

The Senator drew another basic lesson from the funda-
mental nature of the Soviet-German front when he stated:

“When such an area [Russia] is sovital, therefore, it
would seem essential that those who defend it, those who
guide its gallant and heroic courses would be an intimate
part of every council and conference dealing with the
grand strategy of this struggle which embraces the globe.
May we not ask, therefore, that more room be made for
the Russians at the war table?”

In this question of where we should strike our main
blows in the war, there are two basic propositions which
we must constantly bear in mind. The ﬁrst is that t_his‘is
one indivisible war, not several separate wars. The Axis
powers constitute one gang of imperialists who are out to
dominate the world 5 they are united and have a common
world strategy. They can be defeated only as a group.
The second thing we have to remember is that Nazi
Germany is the strongest element in the Axis combination.
Controllingall of Central and Western Europe, Germany
is the heart and backbone of the Axis. While ﬁghting the
Axis at all World points, therefore, the main blows neces-
sarily have to be directed against its core, Nazi Germany.
The Axis cannot be defeated until Germany is smashed,
and no Axis power, could long hold out after Germany
had been defeated. However menacing Japan may be it
cannot Win the world war in the Paciﬁc, certainly not

immediately; but Germany might well win it quickly in .

the European zone by a devastating, blow that would
knock out one or more of the democraticipowers. ‘
Both President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
Churchill, in recent statements and ‘speeches, have recog-
nized that Germany is the most decisive enemy of the
United Nations. Secretary of the Navy Knox put the
question very well recently: '

“The war in the Paciﬁc, in Malaya, in Russia, in Libya
—they are all one war, one bid for world mastery. Hitler
hatched this conspiracy, but the enemy is one indivisible
total enemy. Hitler Wants us to throw all our growing
strength into the Paciﬁc, to stop supplying the British and
the Russians. But this is what we propose not to do.”

The Time to Strike Hitler Is Now

There are lots of people who, impressed by the winter
successes of the Red Army, unwisely believe that the
U.S.S.R. now has Nazi Germany by the throat and that,
therefore, no further real danger can come from that
quarter. But this is the most fatal illusion we could fall
victims to. It is true that the Red Army has dealt devas-
tating blows to the Nazis. It has seriously weakened their
armed forces, it has destroyed their myth of invincibility.
At the recent Rio de Janeiro Conference of all American
republics, Sumner Welles declared that the Red Army
had destroyed over one—third of Hitler’s air force and

_ more than one—half of his tanks._ The Red Army has re-

lieved theterriﬁc pressure upon England and saved that
country from being conquered. Only its valiant ﬁght has
prevented the World from being overrun by the fascist
barbarians._ But, while recognizing all these brilliant Soviet

7

successes, we dare not underestimate the remaining vast
strength of Nazi Germany. Hitler has behind him not
only the industries of Germany, but of all Europe. We
must pay close attention to Stalin’s recent statement. that
Germany still has a big superiority in airplanes and tanks.

Therefore, we cannot help but be alarmed tolearn that
the United States is fulﬁlling only 50 per cent of the
promised munitions to the U.S.S.R. Prime -Minister
Churchill also recently stated that England had likewise
fallen short of its pledged supplies to the U.S.S.R. At
best, the United States and Great Britain are getting only
a small quantity of munitions to the Soviet Union, and to
allow this to diminish is to make a desperate gamble
with fate.

One of Hitler’s major considerations in inciting Japan
to make war against the United States was to divert the
American attack away from himself. He wants to keep
American munitions from going to Great Britain and the
U.S.S.R., and to switch away the American ﬂeet from the
Atlantic Ocean. We must not fall into this deadly trap,
whether through oVer—conﬁdence. in Red Army successes,
or by becoming victims of Hearst’s pro-Hitler campaign
to get us to quit helping our allies in the crucial strugv
gle in Europe an devote all attention to ﬁghting “our
own war in the Paciﬁc.” The winning of the war, the sav-
ing of our country and the rest of the world from fascist
slavery, may well depend upon our not making this deadly
mistake, upon our tremendously increasing our blows at

A this critical juncture of the war against the main enemy,

Nazi Germany.
If the United States, jointly with the other democratic
8

powers, is to win this war one of the greatest lessons We
must learn is that we will have to ﬁght on the offensive.
\Ve must not stand around on the defensive, waiting for
the rattlesnake, Nazi Germany, to strike. It is not enough
to try to build ships faster than Hitler can sink them, nor

‘ to heap up Vast defensive armaments in Various parts of

the world. Our country, and the United Nations as a
whole, absolutely must militantly take the oﬁensive. A
defensive strategy means to prolong the war indeﬁnitely,
to needlessly shed seas of blood. One of the very greatest
assets of the Axis powers is that they have so long held
the offensive. This has enabled them to strike at the Weak-
est spots in their enemies’ line, when and where they
pleased. By the ‘same token, one of the most basic weak-
nesses of the democratic countries is that they have been
on the defensive. This has contributed to great disasters
for them. Look at France 5 she sat placidly behind her
Maginot Line, lost in foolish oVer—conﬁdence, until she
was overwhelmed by the Nazi attackers, who chose the
strategic moment to strike. And now Great -Britain is
making a similar mistake, by keeping her huge, highly-
equipped army idle in her home island, waiting for Hitler
to attack. it when and how he sees ﬁt. O

Open a New European From‘ Against Hifler

Obviously the United Nations must break completely
with the defensive policy that has been so disastrous to the
democratic cause. In this war a militant policy of the
offensive is in itself worth millions of soldiers." On this
Vital question _We should learn from the U.S.S.R. The Red
Army leaders thoroughly appreciate the importance of
