RELIGION
COMMUNISM

By
EARL BROWDER

  

15. What objections would you have to a groupof ministers
going out and working with the people in their congregations, pro-
claiming that God is a revolutionary God, that Go-d is deﬁnitely
working for the establishment here on earth of a Communist co-
operative society?

We would consider such a move a distinct social advance over
the ordinary type of preaching. It would represent one step in the
emancipation from religion.

l6. How do you ﬁt religion into dialectics—-what is the role of
religion in dialectical materialism?

Religion does not ﬁt into a dialectical materialist system of
thought. It is the enemy of it. One cannot be a thorough mate-
rialist, that is, a dialectical materialist, and have any remnants of
religious beliefs. Both the older materialism that preceded the dialec-
tical materialism and the non-materialist dialectics were in the ﬁnal
analysis of a religious character; but not so dialectical mate-
rialism. Dialectical materialism is completely materialist and ex-
cludes religion, but, of course, it includes the explanation of religion.

17. Could you not be convinced of dialectical materialism and
consider religion of value?

No. This Was already answered in the previous question.

18. Because when you begin to work out the unity of opposites
and contradictions, you would have to have religion in the picture——

Yes, religion must be in the picture in order to be eliminated.

19. Would your dialectics move towards some sort of synthesis,
perhaps?

Well, the dialectical conception of synthesis does not include
carrying over obsolete and outlived forms of thought. Some of the
functions that are performed by religion will certainly be performed
by certain other institutions. There is no question about that. A
large part of the functions of organized religion are purely social.
All such functions will certainly be taken over by new forms of
organization and thinking.

20. What will be the regenerative center of the Communist
10 i

 



 

movement, in about another century when it has gotten a pretty
good foothold and achieved its end? What will keep it from de-
generating? Enthusiasm, you know, cannot last. Will they go
back to Lenin and M arx, do you suppose?

No, the guarantees against degeneration are in the living forces
of the people. They will, of course, make use of the teachings
of the best thinkers of the past, but they will have their own lives.
The teachings are the instruments representing merely the past
growth, which are further developed by the living force of the people
themselves.

21. Does this development come through contradiction? It is
a little hard to see how these contradictions could rise in a Com-
munist world; yet according to dialectical materialism we get de-
velopment through contradictions.

The contradictions of the future society will not arise from the
economic base. Contradictions in the present society arise from the
economic base of society, which fundamentally divides society into
warring classes. With the rise of Socialist society and its passing
over into full Communism, this, of course, will be absolutely gone.
That means that the class struggle will disappear as the motive
force of history. In classless society, the dialectic contradictions will
not assume the form of class antagonisms.

22. I just wonder how your philosophical concepts would be
able to keep these contradictions in a materialist sense in a materialist
realm?

There will be no fundamental contradictions in the material
base of society under Communism.

23. Do you mean by that that man can completely conquer
nature, that such things as drought and earthquakes and floods can
be completely regulated?

Man can progressively move in that direction. For example,
even in this past year the Soviet Union already demonstrated the
power to control droughts. The Soviet Union was hit by droughts,
as bad as those which hit the other countries, but the results were

vastly different from those in the other countries. In the Soviet
1‘1

Union, Where farming had already been brought into the Socialist
economic structure, they were able to ﬁght against the drought and
reduce its effects so much that the total production of grain dropped
only two per cent and the total collections of grain actually increased
over the previous year. i s ‘

Similarly, ﬂoods are generally looked upon as a natural phenom-
enon, but to a great extent they are social phenomena, economic
phenomena. The country that suffers the most from ﬂoods is
China; but anyone who has been in China must recognize that the
ﬂoods of China are distinctly the product of the militaristic rule of
that country and not of anything else, that they are not the product
of Water, that they are the product of the breaking down of the
social control of that water. '

24-. dre not the attitudes of devotion and sacriﬁce which charac-
terize many ardent Communists religious?

We consider them social. We consider them as rising out of the
sense of social solidarity and the understanding that the individual
completes himself in the social whole of which he is a product, and
that isolated from it he is nothing. We believe that devotion and
sacriﬁce do not come from the outside to mankind, but arise from
the natural development of man.

25. But you do have, that is the Communists have, a transcen-
dent value, which, the attitude of devotion arnd—-one might be
tempted to use the word worshij>—indicates that these attitudes are
religious?

We have values which transcend everyday life, but which do not,
however, transcend human life as a whole. Our values arise right
out of life. They are not given to us from on high or from God.
Our values which transcend daily life are drawn from the whole
experience of the human race.

26. Do you recognize loyalty to this ideal of great importance?

Yes, but We should say, not loyalty to an ideal, but loyalty to our-
selves. Loyalty to our best values.

27. Would you say Communism contains the combination
12

 

of the dialectic process as far as economic forces are concerned, that
is economic forces as the motivating force in the change o history?

Yes, the economic organization of society, that is, the way in
which mankind makes its living, is the basic fact; that is what we
mean by economics. That does not eliminate the. human factor,
for economics is what man does in order to providefood, clothing
and shelter. Economic forces are not something which differ from
and exclude the actions of man, but on the contrary exert themselves‘
only through human beings.

28. Do you explain according to the C ommunistic theory that
the whole process of history is due to this economic force? Then,
if we attain this C ommunistic society then does that thing end
the dialectic process-—or would you say there would still be dialectic
forces going into higher development?

According to our understanding, dialectical thought is the grow-
ing awareness of the human mind of the natural. processes that go
on outside of it, and human action upon nature guided by this
understanding. It is not an invention of the human mind which is
imposed upon the world, as Sidney Hook maintains it is. It is not
merely an instrument of the mind which happens to be useful for
the moment by an accident. Dialectics is this growing understand-
ing in the human mind of the process of change and devel.o_pm'ent
that goes on throughout the universe. We do not limit it merelyto
the social sphere or to the class strugg" going on now. Dialectics
is universal. There is a dialectics of nature, there will always=‘be
a dialectics for every phase of life. Since life changes its forms,
dialectics will never be eliminated. The dialectical process will not
be eliminated in the future society. It will take new forms; it will
no longer assume the form of the basic antagonisms of class society.

29. Doiyou not consider that dialectical process a hypothesis at
all? You consider it as an established fact?

We consider it as the most generalized truth.

30. Many of us are interested in seeing a new society brought

about and we feel that in the ideals of Jesus we have presented a

goal towards which we are moving and we feel that this gives us

something of a motive power. In what way would you say a group
of people feeling that way can best work towards a new society, or
are they entirely up the wrong tree?

I think that they could best serve the movement, not by con-
centrating too much upon the question of religion and its relation
to the revolutionary movement, but by concentrating upon the prac-
tical questions of the day, as, for instance, to what extent there can
be brought about a practical cooperation of all forces, religious and
non-religious, for certain practical aims. In this ﬁeld there is great
room for work. I think, for example, that people who are essen-
tially religious today and who see that their religious freedom is
threatened by the growing reaction in America, could verylwell ﬁnd
those points in the social set-up in which they could cooperate with
the non-religious forces in the ﬁght against reaction. So that even
from the essentially religious interests of such people there could be
points of Contact with the anti-religious revolutionary movement,
such as the ﬁght against fascism, the ﬁght against War. Certainly
war, which has become an immediate menace, is something that vio-
lates the religious beliefs of the masses; and to mobilize these
religious feelings for an effective struggle against war, could be
very helpful.

31. Is it because o f this basic argument that the Communist
Party is willing to enter into the /1 merican League Against War and
Fascism and enter into c. "niteil front with religious groups to ﬁght
a given enemy?

Yes, in the American League the Communists are only one
small section and a minority; but perhaps a large majority of the
people in the American League are religious people, even though they
did not come into the League from the religious organizations. A
growing number of religious organizations have affiliated, and of
all those who have become aﬂiliated through other organizations,
undoubtedly the majority are religious. Communists have no hesita-
tion whatever in such contacts with religious people. We do not
shy away from religious people at all.

32. To what extent does the Communist Party cooperate with
'14-

 



 

.a‘...~...,..-t

such church federations which are for th-e destruction of capitalist
society?

We have no direct contact with these organizations as such. Some
of the leading individuals in these organizations are active in united
front organizations where we are active. In the American League
Against War and Fascism, Dr. Hfarry F. Ward, who is connected
with the Methodist Social Service Institution—I forget the exact
name—is chairman of the League. Also connected with the League
is Dr. Wm. Spoﬁord, who I believe is one of the leaders of the
Church League for Industrial Democracy. Only in this indirect
way have we contact with these church organizations. Indirectly
all of these forces which have an anti-capitalist tendency come into
a certain broad cooperation through the American League Against
War and Fascism. '

33. You said that religion opposes revolutionary activity on two
grounds—on the ground of belief and on the  of its institu-
tional form at the present time. Do you ﬁnd that in its educational
and organizational set-up there are tendencies towards a reactionary
or passive attitude in the present belief and the desire to keep the
belief reactionary?

I would say that the outstanding feature of the development of
thought in religious organizations today is the growth of revolution-
ary trends, and not a growth of reactionary trends. A prominent
churchman said to me some months ago that the Communists are
going to “capture” the church before we do the A. F. of L. Of
course, we do not believe that; but it is more than a joke, because
it tends =to emphasize that there is a surging growth of social
thought even within church organizations, which is essentially revo-
lutionary thought. It is a struggle against the reactionary character
of present capitalist rule; it is a revolt against all of the reactionary
features of capitalism which become more and more pronounced
from day to day.

34. 11s regards the content of teachings that you discuss. I f
one were an instructor, one would assume there are forms of teach-
ings which" would tend to produce an uncritical attitude to things,
an acceptance of the status quo in the way the thing was taught,

15

 

 

   

apart from the content of what was taught. Do the Communists,
in the way in which they teach their own doctrine,‘ promote a critical
attitude that can be seen in the method of teaching?

The Communist teaching is essentially critical and is not
directed towards developing uncritical acceptance. Sometimes
those who champion the cause of criticism do not understand this,
however, because the critical approach of the Communists does not
involve the splitting up of the movement into its separate parts, but
on the contrary serves to weld it closer together, creating greater
unity of thought, so that the very thought process and the very
criticism itself become a social and not an individual act, a social act
in which the individual participates, but of which the individual him-
self is not the expression. In the Communist Party this expresses
itself in our inner—Party life. We develop our thought through
discussions and a very intensive development of literature. We
probably circulate more literature per member of our organization
by ten times than any other organization in existence. It is a very
intensive collective thought life in which is involved the whole critical
approach to everything. The revolutionist is ﬁrst of all a critic of
the universe and everything that is in it, including himself. But we
avoid at all costs the type of criticism which comes from the in-
dividualist society where criticism is purely an individual function.
For the Communist, criticism is a social function, an organized
function. In bourgeois society criticism is essentially a divisive
process. With us it is the opposite; it is the process of consolidation
of the masses.

35. You do that by keeping this constant circulation of criticism
so that whatever anyone thinks is immediately registered?

Every view established as the view of our movement has been
established as the result of the most thorough criticism. No point
is ever established as the view of the Communists until it has met
and answered every possible criticism that can be made. After the
question has been faced and answered, we do not consider it necessary
that it shall forever continue to be‘an open question. There are
many questions which are closed for us. Therefore, those people
for whom this is still an open question consider that our approach

16

 

 

is uncritical because for us the question has already been answered.
That is only because we have met and answered these questions
before.

36. Do you claim that this increase in revolutionary temper
which shows itself in the church is a social product and not a prod-
uct of religious idealism as we do?

We consider that essentially this comes not out of the religion,
but out of the conditions of life of the people who make up these
bodies and who, having no better channels to express it through,
express it through their religious channels.

37. If such religious organizations enter into a united front
with the Communist Party, then, in the coming years when the
social revolution is successful, will the Communist Party, if it is in
power, enter into a campaign against these organizations that have
helped in achieving this new society?

Communists will never carry on any kind of activity which the
masses will feel is against their interests. The Communists will
never carry on any kind of coercion against religious institutions.
Let that be clear. In the Communist ﬁght against religion, the
Communists will limit themselves purely to ideological weapons, the
weapons,of argument and thought, the expression of thought.

38. If the expression of social thinking that you ﬁnd in churches
is a result 0 f the social situation of the people that are doing the think-
ing, why do you not  the same amount expressed in other pro-
fessions? We are not patting ourselves on the back, but I think you
will agree that there probably is more social thinking done in the
ministry over the country than in any o-ther profession.

We would not say more. There perhaps is still, for the time
being, a little more freedom of expression in the church than in the
schools. In the schools we have laws directed against the expres-
sion of social thinking. Outside of the Catholic church, it is not
yet true of the church institutions. However, I wouldn’t if I were
a member of these church organizations, congratulate myself too
much on this. You do not know how long it will last. You may
have your Dickstein Committee in the Methodist church soon and

in the Protestant churches generally.
17

  
  

39. When you mention the fact that the Communist group
would not carry on any ofensi-ve against church institutions, are you
assuming there, that church institutions would be taken over by the
masses who do not control these institutions at present?

We are assuming that there would be no capitalist class organ-.
ized and controlling these churches. These religious institutions
would be controlled by the people who are in them. They would
not be enemies of the new society, because the masses who would be
in them would be actively cooperating in the new society.

40. If a church group were deﬁnitely counter-revolutionary and
acting against the Communist regime, there would be no hesitation
in wiping that group out?

It would be dealt with on political, not religious, grounds.

41. Would you agree that there is a gambling chance that the
people in the religious organizations might make such a powerful
force working for social justice in case we have a revolution, that the
Communist Party might reopen the question?

I think the more the masses now in the churches become active
in the social struggle, the less need will they find for religion, so
that the more they participate in the revolution, the less likelihood
is there of the church becoming any essential feature of the new
social set-up.

42. Would you say that the participation in building a new social
order would be a substitute for religion?

Religion itself, even where it does not disappear, will tend
to become de-institutionalized.

43. If we are going forward into a period of fascism, is there
not the possibility of religion keeping alive this spirit of revolt, be-
cause of certain factors that have always been more or less connected
 religion and for that reason it may become a very powerful
ally

I think the church as an organized institution is much more
likely to fall under the control of the fascist forces.

44. Where do you ﬁnd the evil-—in the capimlist or in capi-
talism?

18

 

 

Both, the capitalist system is so essentially evil that it cannot
produce good men at the top.

45. Which is first-—man or capitalism?
Mankind is first, but not man as an individual.

46. If in the social struggle the church does not line up with
the fascist organizations, but proves to be helpful to the social revo-
lution, will there be any recognition of that fact?

Certainly, I think the Communists would be more happy about
that than anybody else. Perhaps we will be surprised.

47. I do not think religion today, as we understand it, will post-
pone happiness for the future life. We are working definitely for
an abundant life here, rather than in the future. Some of us do
not believe in the hereafter, and are striving to establish a good
society here. I think we are worb°ng towards the same objective.

It is incorrect to draw an analogy between the vague socio-
religious aspirations and Communism. There is, of course, a positive
social content accompanying some religious teachings, though not
all; but this is not the feature which gives them the character
of religion.

48. I. think we are arguing about terms. What we call religion
you call something else. It is a matter of deﬁnition.

I think the things that we Communists call religion are, you
might put it, the “established truths” about religion. They may
take very subtle forms, but they will always reveal that super-
natural character that we are speaking about here.

49. Every idea has its political and social eﬂect. You cannot
have an idea without having it have some political connection. There-
fore, in the Communist set-up we are open to your deﬁnite pattern
of thought, ideology. Any variation from that would be counter-

revolutionary, even if perhaps some people think it a higher step. In .

other words, the Communist pattern may become crystallized just as
the capitalist system is now, so that there will be no progress, no
change.

The Communists have no fixed system in the sense of a hard

Communism in the
United States

By EARL BROWDER
O

The theory and practice of the revolutionary move-
ment is here expounded by its foremost American

leader.

Embracing the widest application of Communist
policy on tactical, cultural, and theoretical questions,
this book is composed of a collection of reports to
the ‘Central Committee of the Communist /Party of the
U.S.A. of which the author is General Secretary,
together with articles and speeches written in the
past two years.

Earl Browder is gaining an enviable reputation for
the clarity and convincing style of his arguments.
Besides being an analysis of the present situation and
the revolutionary way out, Communism in the United
States will prove an indispensable handbook for every
active participant in the labor movement.

and fast strait-jacket. The very essence of Communist thinking
is the progressive development and realization of all the creative
forces of the human mind. That is the essence of the whole
Communist position of life as seen in the Communist program of
practical action. Certainly, no one can say that where the Com-
munists are the directing power, as in the Soviet Union, the mind
has been put into a strait-jacket. There has never been in human
history such a release of all the initiative of the individual and the
development of capacities as in the Soviet Union. You can go into
the Soviet Union and ﬁnd men occupying the highest positions in
every ﬁeld of life, from the arts and sciences to government, who
but ﬁve or six years ago were backward people on the land, the most
backward illiterate peasants. What society in the world ever showed
such an enormous development of the capacity of the individual
human mind? Never in history has anything like it been seen. So,
if you judge by experience, you cannot draw the conclusion that
Communism tends to strait—jacket human development.

50. /1 little while ago, you said the individual, as such, is not
worth any consieleratiion at all.
I said the individual ﬁnds his development and completion only

as a part of the group, as a part of society. Isolated, the individual
is nothing.

51. Do the Communists consider it psychologically possible to
build up a classless society, a society in which no classes exist?

Yes, the Communists accept that view.

52. But in practice there is always a class.

In the Soviet Union classes still exist, that is true. And the class
struggle Within the Soviet Union is still sharp. But enormous prog-
ress is being madetowards the classless society precisely through that
struggle. Precisely through the class struggle, do we come to the

.classless society. Some believe that the way to get a classless society

is to stop ﬁghting, to stop the class struggle; on this we disagree. We

say that precisely the only way to come to a society without classes

is through the development of the class struggle to the point where

one particular class——the working class—obtains power. By making
20

this one class predominant, that particular class whose historic revolu-
tionary role is to remove the basis for class division, we can reach the
classless society-—but only in this way. The interests of this class
he in doing away with that material.foundation of society which
produces classes. Only when you abolish that which produces
classes, can you abolish the classes themselves. What produces classes
is the division of society into those who own and those who work.
When that is abolished and those who work are also those who own,
then it is only a matter of time that all classes in society will disapear.

53. Has the Communist line on religion changed in the last
three or four years, particularly in regard to the Negro in /Imerica?
Now people who still maintain religious beliefs can join the Party.
I s this a change in the line of the Party, or has it been a development?

It may be said to be a change in the growing understanding of
Party members on the meaning of Party line, but in the authorita-
tive expressions of this line there is no change. Our standard text-
book is the writings of Lenin on these questions—writings that ex-
tend over many years, mostly before the revolution in Russia. There
certainly is no essential change. There are, of course, certain
changes in our application of this line because of the changing situa-
tion. There were, for example, a few years ago very few prac-
tical questions concerning our relations to social movements within
the church because such social movements were largely non—existent.
Today their existence takes on an immediate practical political impor-
tance that brings out features of the Communist attitude towards
religion which were not outstanding before. But it is a change of
development of events of the day rather than any change of the
development of the Party line.

54. On that same question, t.he oﬂicial tactic perhaps for the
immediate situation has been changed in regard to some of these
groups, but is it not true that many of the rank and ﬁle have failed to
catch up with the change? ,1 refer to your discussion before of the
inner—Party life, the discussion that goes on within the Party, it
seemed that that indicated that many of the Party members, whom
we consider to be Party members, do not seem to follow the oﬂicial
line on many of "these questions. I am thinking in particular of

21

 

instaénces in the /1 mericon League where trouble seems to have come
out of the failure of Party members to adopt a united front policy.
I have an idea that probably most of such diﬂiculties that you
speak- of come not from Party members, but from non—Party people
who may call themselves Communists. It is true that many of our
best friends are sometimes our worst enemies because they do not
familiarize themselves with the correct Position on fundamental
questions. Of course, it is also true that not all Party members are
fully grounded in all of these questions, for our Party reﬂects all
the shortcomings of the working class. We have 31,000 members
where a year and a half ago We had from 17,000 to 18,000 mem-
bers. That means we have had 14,000 members coming into the
Party in a year and a half; some have been in for only a couple of
months and are certainly not experts on the policy of the Party.

55. Is there also Communisﬂic propogzmdd among the N egroes?
Is there a good ﬁeld there?

Considerable. It was reported in the newspapers that a Negro
religious leader had stated that the churches were in danger
of losing their hold over the Negroes because of the tremendous
inroads made by the Communists and had therefore called upon the
churches to ﬁght the Communists more energetically; this is some
evidence of how strong is the political inﬂuence of the Communists
among the Negro population generally. We have not any great
organization among the Negro masses. Our organizational strength
among them is growing; but the inﬂuence of our ideas, especially
those ideas expressed in the practical day-to—day struggle for Negro
rights, creates a tremendous effect among the majority of Negroes

in America. In this sense many say that the majority of the Negroes‘

are inﬂuenced by the Communists.

56. Do you regard the Hebrew prophets and Jesus as historical
ﬁgures, and if so, have they social signiﬁcance?

They are historical ﬁgures at least in the sense that they have
played quite a role in the historical development of the human mind.
Whether they were the product of the human mind or Whether
they had some more direct material basis is not important to us. We
do not enter the ﬁeld of higher criticism.

22

57. How seriously is the Communist Party taking the joresent
drive to outlaw it? Today’: papers give the report of the Dickstein
Committee which, if it is embodied in bills and these bills are passed,
will eventually put the Communist Party out of business?

We take them very seriously ; not that we think that that will
put the Communist Party out of business, because the Communist
Party will never be put out of business. We take these proposals
very seriously because we see that they are part of a system of de-
velopment which is represented by Roosevelt’s actions in the auto-
mobile situation, by the whole company union drive, by the drive to
smash the trade unions and to outlaw the Communist Party as an

inevitable feature of "such a drive against the Working class as a ’

whole. .Under the legislation proposed by the Dickstein Committee,
it wouldbecome illegal to quote the Declaration of Indetpendence.

Religion and Communism

By EARL BROWDER

(Discussion with a Group of Students of the Union Theological
Seminary on the Question of Religion and Communism,
Led by Comrade Browder, on February 15, 1935)

1. What is the oyficial position of the Communist Party of the
United States on the question of religion?

The Communist Party takes the position that the social function
of religion and religious institutions is to act as an opiate to keep the
lower classes passive, to make them accept the bad conditions under
which they have to live in the hope of a reward after death. From
this estimate of the social role of religion it is quite clear that the
Communist Party is the enemy of religion. We Communists try to
do the opposite of what we hold religion does. We try to awaken
the masses to a realization of the miserable conditions under which
they live, to arouse them to revolt against these conditions, and to
change these conditions of life now; not to wait for any supposed
reward in heaven, but to create a heaven on earth; that is, to get
those things which they dream about as good things, to realize them
in life. It is clear that any serious movement to rouse and organize
the masses to the realization of a better life now, must struggle
against anything that tends to create passivity, to create the idea that
it is better to submit passively to the powers that be.

On the other hand, the Communist Party is absolutely opposed
to any ‘form of coercion on religious matters. Communists are
for religious freedom unconditionally. The Communists do not
consider religion a private matter when it concerns revolutionists.
But they consider that in relation to State power, to governmental
policies, religion is a private matter. The State should not interfere
with, or in any way dictate to, the religious institutions and beliefs.

This explains the seeming paradox that fascism, which p-uts itself
forward as essentially a religious movement, discloses itself in prac-

tice as a supreme denial of religious liberty, Whereas Communism,

which has a negative attitude towards religion, is the only social
movement today that releases religion from all artiﬁcial constraints
and regulations, from the denial of freedom.

In Germany We have had a very thorough and convincing demon-
stration of what fascism means for religion and for religious insti-
tutions. I do not think that I need to elaborate. I think everybody
is familiar with what is going on in Germany. We have an equally
thorough example of what Communism means in governmental
policy towards religion in the development of more than 17 years of
workers’ and farmers’ government in the Soviet Union. In the
Soviet Union there is complete religious freedom. At the same time,
the Communist Party, which is the government Party, carries on an
active anti-religious campaign. This anti-religious Campaign is purely
educational. The Communists consider it would be the greatest mis-
take to use coercion in the ﬁght against religion. We consider that
this would defeat our own purpose. We consider that the most
effective ﬁght against religion, to remove it completely as that social
factor which stands in the way of reorganizing society, is precisely
the granting and guaranteeing of complete religious freedom. Com-
plete religious freedom, of course, means the complete withdrawal
of governmental support of religion and of all special privileges for
religious institutions. It also means that the religious education for
the young stands on its own feet without any artiﬁcial support.

As for the religious workers, the Communist Party does not
make the abandonment of their religion a condition of joining the
Party, even though it carries on educational Work which is anti-
religious. You may be interested in knowing that We have preachers,
preachers active in churches, who are members of the Communist
Party. There are churches in the United States where the preachers
preach Communism from thekzpulpits, in;;a very primitive form, ‘of
course. In one particular church service described to me, the sub-
stance of the sermon (I do not remember the exact title) was that
the Communists were the angels of God that had been sent like
Moses to lead the people from the Wilderness, while the representa-

4-

 

 

tives of the devil were the capitalists and their agents. This, of course,
is not an expression of the oﬂicial Communist attitude on these ques-
tions, as you will understand; but we do not expel such .people from
the Party. The test for us is whether such people represent the
social aspirations of the masses, which may take on a religious form,
but which are essentially social rebellion. When such is the case,
we welcome them into our Party. Even within the Party, where
we do not consider religion a private matter, we have no sort of
coercion towards such religious remnants, even towards their active
religious expressions. '

2. Would you say, Mr. Browder, that religion might serve a
revolutionary function? ’

I would say that revolutionary social movements may sometimes
take on a religious form; this form, however, would not be an ac-
celerating factor, but a retarding one. That does not mean that
there could not be—and in fact there are to an increasing extent—
common objectives between the Communists and religious organiza-
tions, for which joint efforts and struggle would be put forward.
We have seen this in the political ﬁeld recently in the Saar, where
some sections and prominent leaders of the Catholic church, realizing
the loss of religious freedom which would be involved by incorpora-
tion in the Hitler regime, formed a united front with the Socialists

and Communists to ﬁght for the status quo in the Saar. Such con—. '

crete joint struggles will develop more and more, in which instances
it could be said, from a certain point of view, that the religious
movement was serving a revolutionary purpose. There it is not
religion as such which serves the revolutionary purpose, but the
struggle against oppression, the struggle for the right of the masses
to express themselves even in their confused fashion. The struggle
for this right is revolutionary, and in that sense religious organiza-
tions and movements can play a revolutionary role.

3. What do you mean by saying religion is not a primzte matter
where resvolu-tioniaries are concerned? I took it to mean that you
would not consider wnyone holding a religion to be a revolutionary ,-
yet you said that you accepted religious workers into the Party.

When workers co-me into the Party still actively religious, we
5

 

  
  

accept them, not because we accept their religion, but because we
know that the process of discarding religious beliefs, which are in the
last analysis reactionary ones, is a more or less protracted one. We
expect religion to be eliminated only in the course of a few gen-
erations of the new society, the Socialist society.

We do not consider this religious belief a private matter among
revolutionaries; for those who join the revolutionary movement will
have to submit all their beliefs to criticism. As members of the
revolutionary movement, everything they think and everything they
say affects the development of this movement which they have joined
and of which they have become a part. While we do not exact
of them that they give up their religion, we will subjecttheir re-
ligious beliefs to a careful and systematic criticism, and we expect
that the religious beliefs will not be able to stand up under such
criticism. We would not, for example, place in the most responsible
leading positions of the movement people who had strong religious
beliefs. We consider that they would be dangerous because they
would be left open to social inﬂuences which would endanger the
direction of the masses they would have in their charge.

4-. On the other hand, since a large proportion of the American
population is either connected with the church‘ in one form or an-
other, or even very sympathetic to the church, won’t your tactics,
in order to win these people over, have to take that into account
pretty thoroughly? That is, are you able to- present a front against
religion in ﬂmerica comparable to that used in Russia when you
are working with the /fmerican masses?

Certainly we will have to take the religious beliefs of the masses
into account and respect them——and we do. Certainly, the revolu-
tion, which will be an act of the majority of the people, will involve
those holding religious beliefs. If religion stands as an absolute barrier
to the revolution, that would postpone the revolution for a con-
siderable period. We do not think that it does. We think,religious-
minded people will participate in the revolution, will help to carry
through the change. This is in no way a concession in principle to
religious ideas. Concessions to the desires and prejudices of masses
who hold religious views——yes. The utmost respect for their right
to hold these views, by all means. Complete absence of any system

6

 

 

of coercion on these questions, by all means. In this form, taking
these religious beliefs into account and respecting them, do We meet
the question, but not with any concessions in principle.

5. Suppose that the members of this group go out into the va-
rious churches that they will serve and that they, together with the
people in their congregations, would become revolutionized and would
feel that they were being animated by religious motives, would the
Communist Party examine that evidence and give it scientiﬁc weight,
and possibly modify its conviction that religion cannot be a revolu-
tionary force? -

I would not want to hold out any hopes that the Communists will
be converted to religion. For us as Communists the question is
answered and, while We always examine all evidence that is brought
forward scientiﬁcally, We have no reason in our experience to
believe that any future evidence will modify our conclusions. We
would not Want to give the slightest indication that there is any
prospect of a rapprochement between Communism and religion as
such.

6. zfre you sure there will never be any evidence?

While we always examine every bit of evidence that comes for-
ward, we consider the question as settled for us. We do not expect
to have to reopen it.

7. Do you distinguish between the religious spirit and religion
as it is institutionalized?

Yes, We do.

8. Do you think there are any values in the religious spirit not
found in the church or the institution of religion?

Values, no. But the institutionalized religion is the particular
enemy. Institutionalized religion is still used by the present rulers
99-44 /100 per cent for strengthening the present regime, whereas
the unorganized sentiments act only as a brake upon the development
of the individual.

9. It would appear to me from your deﬁnition of policy that the
very policy which you deﬁne for the Communist Party is coercion
7

  

in a very subtle form in case the Communist Party should come into
power. The Communist Party separates all education: from the
church and makes it all secular, and at the same time carries on an
active anti-religious campaign through the secular means of educa-
tion, at one time disarming all forms of religious education and at
the same time arming yourself with all the power of secular educa~
tion to destroy any religion that remains. Now, if propaganda is
coercion, which I think most Communists say it is, is it not in that
case?

No, not coercion. The whole concept of freedom of religion
becomes real only when it includes freedom not to be religious. That
is something that most religious institutions do not accept. I think. it is
one of the accepted maxims of religious institutions that the mind
of the child should be molded so that he will not be capable of re-
jecting religion. How can such a child have religious freedom if
in his formative period he is very carefully isolated from any
ideas which challenge these religious beliefs? So long as the child
in his formative years is controlled by religious institutions, religious
liberty is denied him.

10. Is that not true when Communists separate him from all
religious influences and subject him to C ommunism?

He is free to develop his full powers, and if religion has any
basic value and responds to any basic need in the human being, it
certainly does not need to be imposed upon the mind of the child,
but will come, as the product of a full social life.

ll. But religion is not any m-ore spontaneous than C om-munism
is, and both are products of education, pretty much.

If one takes that view of religion, then he is rejecting its basic
claim. That is a Communist view of religion.

12. Is it true that they stopped Paul Robeson from singing in
Moscow as soon as he sang religious songs over the radio station?

That never happened. About a week after that. lie was circulated,
Paul Robeson was greeted in Moscow as an honored guest of the
Soviet Union. He sang in the biggest State theaters of Moscow

8

 

 

and declared to the newspapers his great pleasure at the comradely
reception accorded him in the Soviet Union, the like of which he
had received nowhere else in the World. Robeson sang every song
he wanted to sing.

13. Does not the Communist Party forbid parents to give re-
ligious instruction to their children? 1 re they allowed to carry on
family worship and instruction of the children?

The Socialist State, under the leadership of the Communist
Party, permits and guarantees full liberty of religious education and
practice in the family.

14-. M 0st of the things you have said about religion are -critical
from the standpoint of function, but I wonder what you say from
the philosophical point of view. Communism has a certain world
view, and particularly a conception of man’: relationship to nature
and to the world. You believe that man can cooperate with, and
fundamentally subdue, the plain forces of nature. It seems to me
that you have an irrational belief, certainly not a thoroughly scientiﬁc
belief, concerning something that is distinctly in the psychological
realm of thought.

It is true that Communism differs basically in its philosophy from
all religions. That is, essentially all religions presuppose a power
outside of the human realm directing human beings. There are
some religious schools that take on philosophical form, veiling their
religious character; but essentially religion is the belief in a higher, a
supernatural, directing power to which man must submit himself.
Often, a certain analogy has been drawn between this feature of
religion and that feature of the Communist process where the individ-
ual merges himself in the great mass movement and ﬁnds his com-
pletion in a larger whole. This analogy, however, fails to bring out
the essence of the difference. For, whereas in religion, the individual
merging With God and finding his completion in his religious unity
with God becomes separated from the tasks of mankind, in the Com-
munist larger unity he realizes thereby the tasks of taking charge of
these problems himself together with his fellows, establishing social
control of his own life.
