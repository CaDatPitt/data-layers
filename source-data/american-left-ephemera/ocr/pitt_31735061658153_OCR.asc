to lead. It can only be useful in the further development of
society as an instrument either of the big bourgeoisie or of the
proletariat. With its eyes ﬁxed on the past the petty bour-
geoisie cannot but be reactionary. The latent rebellious en—
ergies of that group, however, can be freed and utilized for
the struggle for social progress. The revolutionary proleta-
riat can and must exploit the fear and hatred of the petty
bourgeois against big capital. This task can be accomplish-ed
with least difficulties in periods of economic depression when
big capital reaps its harvest in baisse and drives large portions
of the petty bourgeoisie into bankruptcy. But even in such
periods this aim can be accomplished only if the revolutionary
proletariat establishes its leadership over the petty bour-
geoisie.

Wherever and whenever the proletariat tolerates the polit-
ical leadership of the petty bourgeoisie over its class, then and
there the petty bourgeoisie inevitably and invariably proves
to be the instrument of big capital. As such it operates either
thru a political party of its own, preaching “justice” While it
persecutes the workers, uttering phrases of “peace” while it
wars for big capital——or it operates directly as a leader of the
proletariat, forcing even upon the revolutionary organizations
of the Workers the practice of an opportunist antithesis to
every one of the revolutionary principles of such organiza-
tions.

To counteract these poisonous petty bourgeois inﬂuences
the revolutionary party of the proletariat, the Communist
Party, must carry on unrelenting struggle against opportun-
ism Within its ranks. The antidote to opportunism is Lenin-

lll. Activity Against Passivity.

“Do not minimize the tasks. of the advance guard of the revolu-
tion. Do no-t foret your duty to support this vanguard by your own
organized ac-tivity. Less commonplaces about the development of
the self-activities of ‘the workers—these workers engage in eminently
more revolutionary self-activities than you ever can comprehend-
but see to it that the workers are not corrupted by your own ‘chwost-
ism.’ ” * Lenin: “Two Tactics,” February, 1905.

A Communist Party is either a party of action or it is

means trotting after the movement as i'ts tail instead of marching
ahead of it as its head.

 

 

 

neither communist nor a party. Certain fundamentals must
always be kept in mind:

1. The proletarian revolution and its victory is not an
event that the prolletariat merely has to wait for with the
conﬁdence of a fatalist. It must -be brought about. It must
be consciously organized. Marxism teaches an understand-
ing of the immanent laws of social development in general
and of capitalist development in particular and thus shows
the conditions under which the proletarian revolution must
and will take place. Leninism teaches the mechanics of the
revolution thru a proletarian dictatorship and thus becomes
an indispensable guide to the workers in the period of impe-
rialist capitalism, in the period of the proletarian revolution.

2. The proletarian revolution is not one separate and
distinct act which is initiated by the workers on the day when
they reach full revolutionary «consciousness. It is rather an
uninterrupted -series of struggles and actions, created and
intensiﬁed by a. growing class-conscio-usness, and in turn
creating and intensifying the class-consciousness of the pro-
letarian masses. The-se struggles thus gradually reach a
climax which turns, in the period of a revolutionary crisis,
into a struggle for power. i

3. Revolutionary consciousness, initiative and self-con-
ﬁdence of the proletariat, are therefore not the creators, but
the result of the struggles of the workers. The important
teacher of the working masses for the revolutionary strug-
gles is their own experience gained in action. The army of
the revolutionary proletariat is recruited not only FOR but
also BY its battle-s. While this army sets itself greater and
greater tasks its ranks grow and its consciousness increases.
While its ranks grows and its consciousness increases‘ it sets
itself greater and greater tasks.

4. The revolutionary party, the Communists, represent
the highest potentiality of revolutionary consciousness, initiap
tive, self-conﬁdence and understanding of the Working class.
It is therefore the indispensable factor in all struggles, the
initiator, the organizer, the leader and the teacher who bases
his lessons not merely on gray theory but on the le-ssons
derived from the struggles. Within the ranks of this group
of most advanced workers all the activities of the workers
must reach their grealtest intensity. If the Communist Party
is and does neither of these things it is not a revolutionary
pa.rty. If it is and does all of these things it must be a party
of action. 9

 

The opportunists deny all these functions of a revolution-
ary organization. Lore declares: “According to the situa-
tion and in View of the disorganized state of the labor move-
ment in our country it is much more correct to build a.n orga.n-
-ization which conﬁnes itself purely to the propaganda of the
ideas of revollutionary socialism.” Not organization of the
revolution, not active participation in the class struggle, but
propaganda of ideas, is the aim thus expressed.

Here we ﬁnd opportunism excelling itself. There is chaos
and disorganization in the labor movement. What is there
to do? The revolutionary worker answers: The only thing
to do is to go to work and bring order into the chaos. To
accomplish this, action is required and the initiatory action
must be furnished by the vanguard of the proletariat, by the
Communists; action to overcome the lethargy of the masses;
action to set an example fo-r these masses; action to set the
masses into motion; action to gain the conﬁdence of the
masses.

The opportunist proposes to solve the situation with
propaganda. Propaganda of what? Propaganda in itself
means nothing. Propaganda» must have an object. “Our
propaganda will teach by interpreting present day history for
the workers,” answers the opportunist. But the Communist
answers in the words of Marx: “Our task is not to make
new interpretations but to make new history.” As far back
as 1882 Engels wrote to J. P. Becker: “The New Interna-
tional, of course, can no longer be a. propaganda society, but
it must be an organization of and for action.”

We have h-ere not merely an unimportant difference of
opinion. Here we ﬁnd resurrected within the ranks of the
Communists the very poison which paralyzed the energies of
the Second International, which was responsible for the utter
lack of preparation of the proletariat in thememoralble days
of August, 1914, and which led to the inevitable debacle of
that movement. After years of experience of the utter failure
and falseness of this maxim, Loreism is trying to teach it as
the expression of highest revolutionary wisdom.

The idea of socialism will not overthrow capitalism. Pro-
letarian action will do it if this action is based on the prin-
ciples of revolutionary socialism, on Communism.

“All we need,” saysa Loreite in the “New York Volks-
zeituing” of September 17, “is to teach a small number of
workers, about a million, how to ‘be clear in their aim, and

10

 

then we will, perhaps, be able to lead the 130 millions of
Americans to the revolution.” And the methods with which
h-e proposes to teach. this small little million the principles of
the class struggle is—Loreism. More nonsense has never
been put into so few words. Mo-re igrnorance has never been
displayed in so few words. More lack of revolutionary knowl-

,edge and conﬁdence have never «been disclosed in so few
words. And these are the people that sit in judgment upon.

the Workers (Communist) Party in this discussion. And
these are the people whom Lore organizes into his preparatory
school for the revolution. Poor revolution!

What says Lore to this ?- He very gravely declares that
this article is presenting “objective arguments which elevate
this discussion to the level of a political debate.”

All we need is a million Loreites, “a small number in-
deed,” remarks the writer, and we will be able to lead the
millions of unorgalnized in their struggles. This is merely
the way o-f an idiot who says: “I do not want a revolution.”

The Loreites speak of lack of realism and of revolutio-n-
ary romanticism of the Communists. Here we have ut-opian-
ism pure and simple. For this Loreite whom we have quoted
above, the proletarian revolution does not develop out of the
class antagonisms within capitalism, but it is the creation
of one million leaders who are well train-ed in Loreism.
Before the task of educating this million is complete-d, all
thoughts of revolution are mere illusions.

This counter-revolutionary argument is not -only answer-
ed by the theory of Marxism, but it is decisively answered
by history itself. “Before the 22nd o-f January, 1905, the rev-
olutionary party of Russia was made up of a mere handful
of people———the reformists sneeringly referred to it as a sect.

“In a few months things changed completely. The hun-
dreds of revolutionary socialists increased to thousands.
Thousands turned into leaders o-f the two to three million
proletarians. The proletarian struggle produced deep fer-
ment and caused, partially, the revo-lurtionary movement of
the mass of ﬁfty to one hundred million peasants; the peas-
ant movement, in turn, produced sympathies in the army and
resulted in military rebellions, in armed struggles of sections
of the army against other sections. Thus the vast country
with its 130 millions of inhabitants found itself in the throes
of revolution. Thus the sleeping Russia -turned into the
Russia, of the revolutionary proletariat and of the revolution-

11

 

 

 

 

ary people.” These are the W—ords in which Lenin describes
the transformation in 1905 of peaceful into revolutionary
Russia. Thus do the elementary forces of the class struggle
exert themselves. Thus does history disregard all the plans
and the desires of the opportunist and accuse him, by the
experiences of the revolutionary proletariat, of ‘being an ene-
my of the working class. Whether this enmity be born of
idiocy or design, its danger is none the less indisputable and
serious.

“All we can do at present,” says another Loreite in the
“Vo.lksz-eitung” of September 9th, “is to seriously study and
teach socialism.” After all we must ﬁrs-t become social-

democrats before we can become Communists. “Lenin was

a social-democrat, Marx was one, and so was Engels.”

Here, in the heat of the controversy, Loreism discloses
its heartfelt Wishes. “What distinguishes us from the social-
democrat of today is not the -socialist theory,” says the Lor-
eite, “but merely the practice.” But Lenin “the former so-
cial—democrat” has spent the best part of his life and his
energies in ﬁghting,‘ ﬁrst of all, the theories of the social-demo-
crats. And Engels, the other “social-democrat” cited by the
opportunists, fought vigorously more than ﬁfty years ago
against the very name “social-democrat.” He pointed o-ut
that there is an insoluble contradiction in this name. A so-
cialist could not at the same time be a. democrat.

But such little contradi-ctions mean nothing in the life of
a‘ Loreite. Th-is crew is in itself an insoluble contradiction
of the revolutionary movement. But the movement cannot
stan-d such contradictions. They must be eliminated from
it by a mjaor operation.

The Communist is active; the opportunist talks. The
Communist organizes action; the opportunist fears action.
The Communist organizes revolution; the opportunist talks
about it. The Communist uses his party to set the masses
in motion; the opportunist dreads motion (except of his
tongue) and excuses his own motionlessness by that of the
proletariat. The Communist attempts to develop a revolu-
tionary movement of the masses; the opportunist explains
his own lack of revolutionary spirit by the absence of such a
spirit in the masses. The Communist will lead in the revo-
lution; the opportunist will try to prevent, and finally be-
tray it.

IV. “lnde»pendent” Communists.

“The Bolsheviks have always emphatically declared that they
do not desire to- form a new and special tendency of socialism, but
that they merely desire to apply the fundamental principles of the
whole, ‘international, orthodox Marxian Socialism t-o the new condi-
tions . . . and ‘that they will prove that they know how -to do
their duty even in the most difficult, slow and tedious everyday
work.” Lenin: “Liquidation of the Liquidators,” 1919.

The Communists do not represent a special school of
revolutionists. They do not express merely a tendency of
socialism. The Communists are the revolutionary socialists.
Their fundamental principle is Marxism. Their loyalty is to
the working class. Their enmity is to capitalism. Their
function is to organize ands lea.d the revolutionary class
struggle.

There is -no organized group of proletarian revolutionists

outside of the Communists. There can be none. Whoever,

wants to take issue with this assertion cannot «take issue with
the Communist Party but must take it with Communism.

Lore has not yet learned that. i And when history proves
it to him then he turns from the lesso.n and hides behind an
analogy. “ *

Hoeglund in Sweden has fought the Communist Interna-
tional. He was thrown. out. He established himself as an
“independent” Communist. But in spite of his protestations
of independence and loyalty to Communism he gravitated
quickly and irre-sistibly toward» the. Socival—Democratic Party
of Sweden. Finally the inevitable happened. Hoeglund
united with :-the Social-Democrats. Lore was an understudy of
Hoeglund. Hoeglund’s fate foreshadowed his own. So he
bec.ame busy exploiting. He did not take issue with Hoeg-
lund’s principles nor with his grievances with the Communist
International. He took the “justice” of Hoeglund’s cause
for granted. But he “explained.” On September 25th, 1925,
Lore declares in the “Volkszeirtung”:

“The independent Communists (? M. B.) in Sweden
have now unit-ed with the Swedish Socia1—Democra-cy. Al-
though it is deplorable that these Swedish Communists (my
emphasis, M. B.) have gone back to the Social-Democrats,
yet we -can understand it. In Sweden there exists a strong
Social—Democra:tic movement, -a. mass movement. The Com-
munist movement, too, although fa/r we-a.ker than the social-
ists, is a sort of a mass movement. An independent Commu-

13

 

  

 

nist movement seemingly could not maintain itself there.
And such will be the case everywhere where the working
class is well organized and where it has at its disposal mass
organizations and mass movements. In this respect the Un-
i-ted States differs from the European countries. Because
here the-re exists neither a Socialist nor a Communist mass
movement. Here it is therefore possible to» be truly a.nd honest-
Iy independent (? M. B.) without being crushed by either the
one or the other -of the mi1lstones—because there are no mill-
stones.”

Here we have Loreism in “Reinkultur.” ”“ Loreism, truly
and honestly independent—indepe:ndent of what? i

We understand Lore’s independence perfectly when we
see that he ﬁnds it in order, and can understand why the “in-
dependent” Communists‘in Sweden go back——not to the Com-
munists, bu't—to the socialists. While Lore sees no signiﬁ-
cance in that, we are obliged to ﬁnd signiﬁcance in Lore’s
attitu~de. “H-oeglund had to give up his ‘independence’ on-
account of the size of the Socialist and Communist move—
ments in Sweden,” says” Lore. If you grant that argument,
then Lore easily ducks from under the necessity of explaining
why H=oeglund went back to the s-ocialists. He simply could
not resist the size. If the Communist Party were larger there
is no question that Hoeglund w-ould have gone back to that
party. It issimply and purely a matter of gravitation.‘ And
we all know that the larger body has the greater attraction.
If Hoeg1und’s i-ndepe-ndents were the larger of the three groups
then it would have had the greater attracti-on-—but not for
the Commu-nists.

But let us be serious. Any of our Pioneers could inform
Lore th-atindependence in politics is expressed in a program.
Where such an independence -of program is missing there is
something radically wrong with the independence. If the
program of our Loreite “Independents” has any deﬁnite affin-
ity for the program of any of the larger political bodies mov-
ing around it like millstones, then the millstone in question
is bound to haunt and ﬁnally to get the “Independents.” If
Lore does not believe our Pioneers we advise him to ask his
opportunist friends and -brothers, Longuet in France, Kautsky
and Levi in Germany, Adler and Bauer in Austria, Grimm in
Switlzerland, Turati in Italy, etc. The “in-dependence” of

these opportunists from the social patriots of their and all
other countries proved so badly founded that today the ma-n
whose shot made an end to the life of Count Stiirghk, Fritz
Adler, and the man wh-o is responsible for the murder of tens
of thousands of German workers, Gustav Noske, are arm-in-
arm, together in the same, the socialist, International.

Let us investigate the basis of Hoeglund—Lore’s “inde—
pendence.” In the relation between the working class and
the capitalist class there are possible two fundamental ap-
proaches. One is that of relentless struggle for a ﬁnal and
decisive victory of the proletariat. The other is that of com-
promise, class collaboration, and class peace. There is no
room in between. To be independent of any of these posi-
tions is tantamount to being dependent upon the other. Not
to be for war means to be for peace. Not to be for peace
means to be for war. Any position in between is merely a
temporary one for people who are o.n the way over from one
position to the other. Such people make themselves inde-
pendent of the position they held heretofore to be free for
the acceptance of and dependency on the other position.

The road that the Loreite opportunists are traveling this
day leads to the oﬂicial recognition of their betrayal of Com-
munist principles, lead-s to membership in the same Interna-
tional with Noske. Levi has traveled this road; so have Fros-
sard and Hoeglund. Even the Loreites themselves see where
the road leads to. They attempt to furnish in advance a
gloriﬁcation of their knavery. On September 22nd, 1925, we
read in the “Volkszeitung”: “The ablest comrades and best
heads in the dlifferent countries have either been expelled
from their organizations or have left it on acc-ount of the
reign of terror of incompetent leaders.” Thus we ﬁnd Levi,
Frossard, Hoeglund, raised from the position of traitors of
Communism and elevated to that of martyrs -of the terrorist
and incompetent Communist leadership. The Loreites are
thus excused in advance ﬁor joining these “martyrs” in the
catacombs of the resurrect-ed Second Internaztional. To make
it clear as to where they place the blame, the Loreites con-
tinue: “The present leaders of the Communist International
have pro-ven -to this day capable only of holding on to the
rule over and the control of the Comintern, a p-osition which
they have usurped. In the government of Russia they have
proven themselves incompetent since the death of Lenin.”
After one reads that, one will be convinced that these “inde-

15 '

 

pendents” will land in the camp of the social reformists. And
they have to travel -only a short, a very short distance indeed,
——thes-e “independents.” Therefore, When the “independ-
ence” of the Loreite Iopportunists from Communism will be
ﬁnally crowned by their unity with Berger an-d Hillquit, the
Communists will be neither -surprised nor chiagrined. It will
be merely the consummation of the inevitable.

“But,” say:s Lore, “my grievance is not with Commu— ,

nism; it is with the Communist Party.” Let us see. Is Lore’s
grievance with individuals in the Party‘? If so, he lacks the
ﬁrst fundamen-tal quality of a Communist. H-e has not yet
learned to sub-ordinate his own feelings to the dictates of the
Party.

Or is his grievance with the form of organization of the
Party? The form of organization of a Communist Party is
part of the principles of Communism. The form of organiza-
tion must be adapted to the tasks of the Party. We are out
of the stage of discussing the question of Whether to make
this adaption; and We are almost thru with the discuss-ion of
the question of how to do it. If Lore Wants to resurrect all
the arguments made on this point by the Mensheviks against

Lenin, then his place is with the Mensheviks. And again—his

independence vanishes. Or is Lore’s grievance" with the prin-
-ciples of the Party? The principles of the Party are the prin-
ciples of Communism. Lore’s grieva.nce in this case is merely
a grievance with Communism, is a manifestation of his non-
Communist concepts.

The Loreite -opportunists make much -of their duty to
defend the interests of the “Volkszeitung’s Family” against
the dark designs of the Party. This “Vo1kszeitung’s Family”
is not Communist, We are informed. It is merely educated
to the principles of the class struggle.

Accepting this explanation of the Loreites we ask the
question: “What are the principles of the class struggle?”
They are Marxism, Leninism, Communism. There a'.r'e’no
principles of a class struggle outside of the principles -of Marx-
ism, of Communism. To be for the class struggle and to ﬁght
consciously in it, is to be a Communist. To oppose Commu-
nism is to deny the principles of the class struggle. The deep
regard the Loreite opportunists show toward the “Volks-
zeitung’s Family” is a manifestation of.a Worse “Khvostism”
than Lenin ever fought against. Here We have a “revolution—
ary” paper where the readers shape the principles of the

16

 

editor, instead of the revolutionary editor exerting all his
inﬂuence and ability to shape the principles of his readers.
Instead of marching ahead of his “Volk'szeitung Family” and
leading it, he hangs on to its tail, allows himself to be led
by it. That is a sample of the Lorrei-st concept of leadership.

The result is easy to foresee. On the day when the bat-
talions of revolutionary lalbor challenge the power _of capital-
ism to ﬁnal combat, then the edu-cation of the editor of the
“Volkszeitung” will be completed to that point, that he will
betray the proletariat and earn the applause of the “Volks-
zeitung’s Family.”

V. Freedom of Criticism.

“‘Dogmatism,’ ‘doctrinarism,’ ‘growing rigidness of the party as
an inevitable punishment for the arbitrary elimination of all think-
ing’—those are the enemies against whom the crusaders for ‘freedom
of criticism’ are arming. We are glad that this question is put on
the order of the clay and desire to add only one more question:

“Who are the judges? V

“The much praised freedom of criticism does not mean the
replacing of one theory by another; it means freedom from any uni-
form ancl well-thought-out theory; it means eclecticism and lack of
principle.” Lenin: “What to. do?”, 1902.

Opportunism is the very antithesis of Le-ninism. Lenin-
ism grew in a relentless struggle against opportunism. Op-V
portunism has led to the de-feat, Leninism to the victory of
the working class. The principles of Leninism mu-st prevail
against the lack of principle of opportunism.

Today we know not only the tendencies of opportunism
but we also know its methods. We kn-ow that wherever some
abstract and meaningless principle -is raised there is an op-
portunist not far away.

All -of the Lo-reites sign an indictment again-st the Work-
ers (lC~ommunis~t) Party of America accusing it of dogmatism
and complaining against its refusal to allow freedom of criti-
cism within its ranks.» ,

What does this mean concretely? The desire to criticise
must spring from some dissatisfaction with the principles,
aims and tactics of the Party. If these are to be subjected
to a critical examination it is the Party itself and only the
Party that can sit in judgement. And in passing judgement
against its critics the Party merely exercises its indisputable
duty -to determine for itself its aims, its principles, and its
tactics. If the question is to be decided as to what constitutes

. good Communist theory or tactics, it is the Communist Inter-

    

  

national and the Communist Party that must make the de-
cision. And if the individual opportunist and Loreite wishes
to match hi-s judgement again'st that of the Party or the Inter-
national he may do so~——but not as a Communist, not as a
member and adherent of these organizations, not as a de-
fender of Communism, but as one who differs with and there-
fore stands outside of them.

Some -of the opportunists declared in the dis-cussi-on under
consideration that as socialists “we” have fought against
catholicism for decades and “we” cannot permit now that a
dogmatism not unlike that of the catholic church be intro-
duced in the Communist Party.

What is the question? Nowhere in their article do they
take issue with the principles of Communism. They d-o not
‘say what particular dogma they are ﬁghting against. They
are merely opposed to dogmatism in general and on principle.

The catholic church is and has been one of the strongest
and most- consistent counter-revolutio-nary forces in society.
It is an object of combat for the revolutionist. We revolu-
tionists ﬁght its theories and its activities. In these struggles
we ﬁnd this organization a, formidable opponent. The reason
for this is its ‘ideological unity and its organizational centrali-
zation. If we revolutionists had not already learned these
lessons in our experience we could learn the value of ideo-
logical unity and organizational centralization from the cath-
olic church. T V

The Communist Party can maintain its ideological unity
only by insisting. that all its members be rev-oluti-onists. The

ﬁrst prerequisite of membership in a Communist Party is that ‘

the candidate ‘be a ‘Communist. His Communist qualities in
turn are attested to by his principles and activities. An-d if
these principles and activities are not in conformity with the
principles and activities of the Party, if they show a serious
deviation from the principles of Communism then the Party
says: “You are not a Communist and therefore: Get out”
If that be heresy hunting, ma'ke the ‘best of it! We say.it is
merely the exercise of the revolutionary sense of the workers.

The demand of “freedom of criticism” merely indicates
a desire to be freed from the duty of accepting the Commu-
nl-ist principles and of participating in the Communist activi-
ties of the Party. Such “freedom” would be suicidalfor the
Party. And since the Party considers it its duty to be instru-

18

, mental in the destruction of capitalism instead of practicing '

.economic basis from under the feet of all classes. While

self-destruction it preserves its Communist integrity and
ﬁghts its opportunist “critics.”

Under the leadership of Lenin the Communists have
steered clear of the swamp of opportunism. But the oppor-
tunists do not give up hope. They persist in propagating a
return into the quagmire of opportunism. And when they are
told that they cannot carry on this propaganda within our
Party they complain of intolerance. We Communists answer
their complaints in the words of Lenin: “O yes, gentlemen,
you are ‘free’ to beckon to us, you are ‘free’ to go wherever
you want to go, even into the swamp. We even believe that
your ﬁt place is in the swamp. We are ready to help you get
into it. But keep your hands off us; do not hold on to us;
do not soil the great word ‘freedom’; for we, too, are ‘free’,
free to go where we please, free n-ot only to ﬁght against the
swamp but also against those that want to return to it.”

Vl. Communists and Petty Bourgeoisie.

“The question of what to do to convey poli'tical knowledge to
the workers cannot always be answered as simply as the practitioners
do. Mostly the answer is: ‘Go among the workers.’ To convey
political knowledge to the workers, the socialists (Communists)
must 0 among ALL.C-LASSES of the population, must send troops
of their army into all directions.” Lenin: “What to do?”, 1902.

“Finally there are in every capitalist country always wide bour-
geois strata that forever vacillate between capital and labor. To
insure victory the proletariat must first of all choose the right
moment for its decisive attack on the bourgeoisie, considering amon
other things disunity between the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie,
or the impossibility of maintaining their alliancea, etc.” Lenin:
“Elections to the Constituent Assembly and the Dictatorship of the
Proletariat,” 1919.

“Communism is the science and knowledge of the condi-
tions under which the proletariat can emancipate itself,” de-
clares Engels. We know that this emancipation can be accom-
plished only by the proletariat itself. The proletariat cannot
free itself without at the same time freeing all other ex-
ploited and oppressed class-es. This result will be achieved
because the proletarian power will be used to remove the

other revolutionary classes replaced in their revolution merely
the rule of one class by another, the proletarian revolution
will make an end ‘to all class rule by making an end to all
classes.   e T T   - -.
While thus the revolutionary workers serve in their strug-

19

 

- gle the interests of all the exploited and oppressed classes,

nevertheless the groups and classes between the proletariat
and the capitalists do not recognize this. As a whole they
will never recognize it until the proletariat, in the period of its
dictatorship, will demo-nstrate t-his in its attitude toward these
classes. Meanwhile these groups and classes try to serve their
own group and class interests. But while the revolutionary
proletariiat solves in the struggle for its emancipation the
problems of these intermediary classes, also these latter class-
es in turn cannot solve the problem of the proletariat in
trying to solve their own. It is clear, theref-ore, that these
classes and groups between the proletariat and the capitalist
class cannot be the driving force of the social revolution.
This task is reserved for the proletariat. The latter must
establish and maintain its undisputed hegemony in the revolu-
tionary movement.

' The very existence of groups and classes between the pro-
letariat and capitalist class proves that the forces of capitalism
are by no means homogeneous. Varying ‘interests divide them.
These divisions, at times, become so sharp that they cause
bitter struggles in the camp of capitalism.

The attitude of a revolutionist toward these different
groups of the capitalist class and toward their divisions and
struggles determines his quality as a leader of the proletariat.
In this attitude there arerev-ealed:

First, his theoretical understanding of the problems of
the proletarian revolution.

Secondly, the degree of determination he displays in or-
ganizing the struggle against capitalism and the capitalist
class.

The opportunist fails. in both. His theory is conﬁned to
the vulgarizati-on of some Marxian phrases. His practice
exhausts itself in the constant repetition of these phrases.
He calls that “educating the workers” or “preparing the -pro-
letariat for the revolution.” Because the opportunist phrase
‘sounds more radical than the proposed immediate action of
the revolutionist some well meaning workers are misled. But
the unpretentious action of the revolutionist digs the ground
from under capitalism, while the ra-di-cal phrase of the oppor-
tunist conﬁnes itself to making noise. The opportunist covers
his objection to revolutionary action with the radical phrase.

‘Aill opportunists acclaimed enthusiastically the radical lan-

guage of the anti-war resolutions of the Second International

20

 

 

 

at the congress in Stuttgart (1907), and at the special con-
gress in Basel (1912). But all of them, with the same ulna-

nimity, opposed at Stuttgart and at Basel even the slightest

actual step to organize and prepare action against the com-
ing war; '

The problem of the revolutio-nist is that of the organiza-
tion of the revolution. To solve this problem the revolutionist
must:

1. Organize himself with all other revolutionists into a
revolutionary party, comprising all those who understand
and know the conditions under which the proletariat can
emancipate itself.

2. So construct his party and act thru it that he can
establish his party’s inﬂuence and leadership over the prole-
tari-an masses and can thus help to convey to the latter the
experiences of their struggles in the form -of the highest pos-
sible degree of class consciousness and revolutionary self-
conﬁdence.

3. Be active in and draw the working class int-o all
political struggles of capitalisin and against capitalism, ex-
ploiting differences among the enemy, winning allies for the
workers. '

4. When the workers are ready, when their conscious-
ness is prepared, when groups and classes between proletariat
and capitalist class have either been won as allies for the
workers or have been at least neutralized so that they will
not ﬁght against the workers, in other words, when the objec-
tive and subjective factors make this possible, then lead the
forces of the revolution into decisive battle with capitalism.

It is the historic achievement of Leninism that it provides

‘a guide for the revolutionary working class on this road .to

the establishment of dictatorship of the proletariat. The op-
portunist does not wa.nt to travel that road. He dreads revo-
lution. And for ‘his justiﬁ-cation he digs up out of the dead
past the Lassall-ean phrase of the one reactionary block out-
side of the proletariat. He accepts the bourgeois revolutionist
Lassalle against Marx. He defends Lassalle against Lenin.
That he can do that unblushingly even years after the work-
ers of the world have witnessed the experiences of the Rus-
sian revoluti-on shows in what little regard the opportunist
holds the intelligence of the revolutionary proletariat.

VII. Communists -and Farmers.

“Only if we succeeed in moving the peasant masses to a coalition
with the proletariat, will the proletarian revolution obtain a chorus
without which its revolutionary solo is doomed ‘to become its swan-
song in all aricultural countries.” Karl Marx. '

‘‘If the partiescf the Second International ‘had only indifference
or even aversion for the peasant (farmer) question the reason is not
solely to be found in "the special’ conditions of the West, but above
all in the fact that these parties did not believe in the dictatorship
of the proletariat, feared the revolution and never dreamt of leading
the proletariat to the conquest of power. Now if one does not want
to lead the lproletarians into battle, it is obviously futile to look for
allies for the proletariat. The Second lnterna'tiona| considered its
ironical attitude toward the peasant (farmer) as a sign of true
Marxism. In reality this attitude-—for indifference to such an im-
portant question on the eve of the proletarian revolution is an
indirect betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat—is a definite
betrayal of .Marxism..” Stalin: “Theory and Practice of Leninism.’’ '

Our American opportunistls run true to the color of their
friends of brothers of the Second International. In the name
-of Marx they betray Marxism. In the name of a ps-eudo-
radical phrase they betray the revolution.

The Communist is a Marxian. For him changes in the
economic base of social groups are not merely Welcome sub-
jects for philosophical speculation, but they are ﬁrst and fore-
most indications of the weakness or the strength of the ene-
my. They point the Way in which a direct advance of the
forces of the revolutionary proletariat is possible; they show
Where, thru careful expsloitation of the defections in the ranks
of the enemy, portions of that enemy can be neutralized.
They indicate Where classes and groups hitherto in the ranks
of the enemy can be Won over as allies of the proletariat.

The opportunist does not react to such changes. First
because of a lack of theory. He does not understand and
cannot evaluate such changes. And secondly because he is
not a revolutionist. He believes only in talking about the
revolution. But he condemns every measure to organize it.

In the la.st decade the United States witnessed repeatedly
deep-going crises in the ﬁeld of American agriculture. The
pauperizing of the American farmer proceeds with unerring
precision. The assimilation of American agricultural capital
by ﬁnance capital is an uninterrupted process. '

I Only a few years ago this phenomenon led to the forma-
tion of the non-partisan league movement. The leaders of
this movement were political charlatans and turned traitor

22

 

_.W?___ ,,V:, ﬁx ,.

 

 

to the farmers. But the masses supporting the league were
farmers revolting against the capitalist system.

The critical agricultural prosperity of the war interrupted
this revolt. But in 1922-23 it was renewed with greater inten-
sity. The recurrence of these crises is an integral part of
capitalism in the period of imperialism. Imperialism shifts
the economic base of capitalism from competition to. monop-
oly. The farmer loses his e-conomic independence which he
had retained by virtue of his control over his means of pro-
duction. He becomes a victim of monopoly. A veritable eco-
nomic revolution takes place. This revolution turns millions
of farmers into proletarians. Other farm owners are turned
into renters, tenant farmers; and again others become the
virtual slaves of mortgage holders. '

This economic revolution also produces a political one.
The agricultural problem becomes an ever recurring issue in
the political life of the country. But the capitalist ‘parties
are the parties of imperialist monopoly. The best they can
do for the farmer is to give expressions of sympathy. The
farmer is thus driven to self—protection. He wakes up polit-
ically. He revolts against thveprule. of the capitalist parties,
against the rule of capitalism. t ' v

Here We are confronted with a revolution. A deep-going
change takes place which vitally affects the proletariat and
especially its movement for emancipation. Here is an occa-
sion where the army of the revolutionary proletariat must
execute a maneuver. Instead of confronting the political
forces of the farmers face to face as is inevitable in the period
in which the farmers are an integral part of the political army
of capitalism, the revolutionary proletariat now sides with
the farmers against capital. Temporary the this condition
may be, but as long as it exists the tactics of the proletarian
revolutionist are predetermined. Protecting and even strength-
ening the hegemony of the proletariat in the revolutionary
movement, the working class must establish an alliance with
the farmers in the struggle against capitalism.

The counter-revolutionary opportunist opposes this ma-
neuver. He does not want to strengthen the forces of reV.olu—
tion. That would be a danger to capitalism. He sneers at
those who point to the revolutionary signiﬁcance and the
revolutionary character of the farmer-s’ movement. And after
one wave of a serious agricultural crisis has passed and capi-
talisfm has succeeded temporarily in quieting the agricultural

23

masses, then these gentlemen “Ma-rxians,” the opportunists,
self-complacently parade their idiotic, “I told you so.” These
gentry try to cover up their own revolutionary impotence
by whining about the inherent reactionary qualities of the
farmers. .

“It is just as easy for a Communist to travel to Mars as
it is for him to approach a farmer,” say the Loreites. The
farmers are a “proud and ignorant” lot. They forced even
the Communist Party of Russia into a “total deviation from
Communism” thru the N. E. P. To tackle the farmer ques-
tion is but an attempt to “go with the head thru the wall.”
All these quotations are from one single article in the “Volks-
zeitung” of September 8th, 1925.

There is no dispute about the role of the agricultural
proletariat as an integral part of the proletariat as a whole.

The question‘ at issue is the attitude of the Communists .

toward the non-proletarian w-orking farmer. The attitude of
this economic gro-up toward the revolutionary movement of
the proletariat is a question of victory or defeat of the work-
ers. Irrespective of the prevailing ideology among the poor
farmers their economic status is bound to make them sooner
or later the enemy of capitalism.

Left to itself this enmity will crystallize int-o an inherently
reactionary movement because the farmer belongs to a class
of the past and not to -one of the future. His aim is to bring
back the “good old days” and not to achieve new and better
days. He sees in the onward development of capitalism still
more oppression of himself; the revolutionary worker on the
other hand sees in the onward development of capitalism the
ripening of the conditions of his freedom.

The Communist is not blind to these differences. But
he is not merely a theoretician; he is an active director of
hi-story. He -sees -that capitalism becomes more and more of
a problem to the‘ farmer. If he, the Communist, can induce
-the farmer to combine his attempt to solve this problem with
that of the proletariat under the leadership of the latter, then
the anti-capitalist forces will be strengthened -tremendously
and victory will be made easier and more certain.

“But the farmer is ‘realctionary’; he is ‘proud’ and ‘igno-
rant,’ ” say the opportunists. What d-o-es that mean? Do
the opportunists claim that the laws of society are not oper-
ative on the farmer? Do they mean to say that the farmers’
attitude in the class war is ﬁnally determined by his “pride”?

24

 

fl
1’

,. ,

That is sheer nonsense. His “pride” is a result of his seeming

' economic independence. With the gradual disappearance of

this independence his “pride-” also disappears. The farmers’
economic, political, or social position are n-ot, in the last ana-
lysis, determined by their ideals. On the contrary; their ideals
are determined by their economic, political, and social
position. '

The total value of all capital invested in agriculture in
the United States decreased by 25.3% since 1920. This is
not due to extensive withdrawal of capital from agriculture
but represents an actual loss in value.

In 1920 the total value of capital invested in agriculture
in the United States amounted to $79,607,000,000. Of this
$13,400,000,000 or 16.9 per cent -of the total was invested by
mortgage holders. In 1924 the total value of the investment
had decreased to $59,409,000,000 while mortgage holders in-
creased their share of this value to $14,000,000,000 or 23.5
per cent of the total. Thus, while the total value of invest-
ments decreased by 25.3 per cent, the total amount of in-
de'btedness increased by 4.4 per cent. And, on top of that,
the average rate of interest on the indebtedness of the farmers
changed from 6.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent, an increase of
1.5 per cent. ,

Within four years the net income of the farmer available
for the upkeep of his family decreased from $932.00 to
$520.00, a loss of 44 per cent. This average is arrived at
without separating big and small farms. It is clear, there-
fore, that the actual net income of the poor farmer is far
below $520.00 per year.

Official census ﬁgures show that in the year 1922 alone,
1,120,000 people shifted from the farm to the city. The De-
partment of Agriculture reported for January, 1924, that 23
per cent of all the farmers of ﬁfteen wheat and corn growing
states went bankrupt. “The American farmers Whose debts
before the War amounted to twenty billions, have paid the
largest portion of these debts and are now living in luxury
and plenty”; this is the expert information that is given to
the Loreites in the issue of the “V=olks.zeitung” of September
16th, 1925. And Lore himself gives weight to such statements
by claiming that the writer is “considering things from higher
aspects.” Let us investigate these “higher aspects.” Let us
consider the “realism” upon which Loreism builds itstactics.

According to the Department of Agriculture in Washing-

25

 

ton, a witness surely not biased in favor of revolution, the
average debts per farm in the United States amounted to
$1,715.00 in 1910, and to $3,356.00 in 1920. This is equal
to an increase of 93.2 per cent. That is the way the farmers
have paid their debts. The indebtedness of the farmers in-
creased from an average of $9.00 per acre in 1910 to $17.50
per acre in 1920, an increase of 75.2 per cent. This proves
beyond any doubt that the value of the increased acreage of
the farms is by far not meeting the increasing indebtedness.

Bankruptcy among the farmers is constantly increasing.

"A Even during the banner years of farm prosperity in 1918,

1919 and 1920 the bankruptcies of the farmers amounted to
7 per cent, 6.3 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively of the
total amount of bankruptcies registered. These percentages
increased to 9 per cent in 1921, to 14.4 per cent in 1922, and
to 17.4 per cent in 1923. Luxury and plenty, indeed!

The percentage of tenant farming and share cropping is
constantly increasing. In 1880 this class of farmers amounted
to 25.6 per cent of the total. Since then the percentage has
increased uninterruptedly to 38.1 per cent in 1920.

Within two years, from 1920 to 1922, the percentage of
totally abandoned farm-s increased from 4.7 per cent ‘to 7.3
per cent. Such is the “plenty” the farmers enjoy. And as to
their “pride”—that “pride” goes the Way of the farmers’ eco-
nomic indep-endence—-it goes to the dogs. Having seen the
“luxury and plenty” which the Loreite permits the farmers
to enjoy let us hear how capitalist experts View these con-
ditions.

“The drastic economies which have become necessary
on the farms have greatly reduced farm standards of living.
They have compelled over—work by the farmers, unaccus-
tomed farm work by the farm mothers; increased work by
the children, kept out of school——in too many cases the older
children taken out for goo-d. The farmer has no
challenge to heroism, the farmer’s wife has no glory in her
sacriﬁce and disappointment and long days of toil. The result
has been a so-cial and political unre-st which has not contrib-
uted to national welfare. The undeserved fate and the power-
lessness to pull himself out of his difficulties has lessened hope
and developed unrest .” Thus speaks the United States
Department of Agriculture in its yearbook of 1923, the la-st
one available. . _

Capitalism itself realizes the seriousness of the problem.

26

 

 

_ ...,,«:,.._....,_... M.....~..._...>a.»........—...-... . ... .. .... 

It cannot even suggest a remedy. It sees the unrest, caused
by the misery which imperialist monopoly creates for a whole
class of formerly economically independent people. But the
Loreite opportunist -stands by, and with the intelligence and
stubbornness of the man who for the ﬁrst time saw a camel,
he exclaim-s: “There ain’t no sich animal.” »

The opportunist claims that it is foreordained that the
farmer is a reactionary, and if you claim otherwise, the Lore-
ite stamps you either a-s an idiot or as a traitor. But the

treacherous idiocy must be looked for according the petty .

bourgeois formula of the opportunist.

The poor farmer is not a capitalist. He differs from the.

proletarian merely in that he owns the means of production.
But he does not differ in his relation to -capital. Both, the
proletarian and the poor farmer, are exploited by capital. The
one is the victim of industrial capital, while the other is under
the heel of agricultural or banking capital. And in the period
of industrial monopoly we ﬁnd that it is the quickly accumu-
lating gains from industrial capital that celebrate their resur-
rection in the form of agricultural and banking capital.

The Communist, knowing the dynamic forces of social
development, makes himself a conscious part of these forces
and aids and directs this development toward a revolutionary
solution. The opportunist, not understanding these forces,
makes himself a part of the counter—acting powers, thus aid-
ing capitalism and counter-revolution.

VIII. Shop Nuclei.

,“Every shop must be our fortress! The shop nucleus
must consist of revolutionists who take their powers and
their orders for their revolutionary work from their Ieadin com-
mittee. All members of the shop nucleus must consider themselves
as agents of the Ieadin committee. It is the duty of these agents
to subordinate themselves to: all decisions of this committee and to
live up to all laws and regulations of the- ‘army’ they have joined;
and they have no right to leave this army except by permission of
the higher units.” Lenin: “Letter to a Comrade,” 1902.

The task of the Communists, the revolurtionists, is not
merely that of propagating, but that of organizing the revolu-
tion. The Loreite disputes this.

The idea that the revolution must be consciou-sly organ-
ized is proclaimed a romantic illusion by the opportunist. His
claim to realism we see is thus purchased at the price of
Marxism. . .

FOREWORD.

The building and perfecting of a. revolutionary party of
the proletariat is a process. The most important of this
process is that of the Bolshevization of the party. The Work-
ers (Communist) Party of America is now in the ﬁrst stages
of this process.

Bolshevization is the process of adaption of the party, its
form of organization, its activities and the ideological a.nd
theoretical understanding of its membership to its task, that
of organizing and leading the workers for and in the prole-
tarian revolution. W A

This aim can be achieved only if the party frees its ranks
from all elements that are not responsive to the duties of a.
revolutionist. Elements opposed to the revolutionary class
struggle must be eliminated.

This task is more complicated than it appears. It seems
that in a voluntary association of revolutionists no -one should

be found who does not subscribe to revolutionary principles. 

But this is not so. Conscious or unconscious anti- and coun-
ter-revolutionary elements ﬁnd their way into a revolutionary
party and try to sway it from its duty. They attempt to ac-
complish this task by means of false theories, by spreading
of enervating pessimism, ‘by trying to turn the party from an
organization of revolutionary action into one of revolutionary
phrase. They are busily engaged in replacing the guiding
principle of the revolutionary party——Marxism, Leninism,—by
opportunism.

A vicious American variety of opportunism presents itself
to our party in the form of Lorei-sm.

What is Loreism?

“It is an invention of the enemies of Ludwig Lore within
the Workers Party,” answer the Loreites.

A two months discussion in the “New York Vo1kszeitung”
has revealed Loreism in its fullest glory. No longer restrained
by a desire to hide their true identity because detected and
unmasked by the party, the Loreit-es have given voice to their
true desires, ideas and principles. In their own discussion

they answered the question “What is Loreism‘?” And the
1

 

       

 

  

In spite of all the lamentations’ of the opportunist the
class struggle is a reality. The revolution is merely a phase

 

of the class struggle, the last phase, the climax. This last '

phase cannot be reached without a conscious participation
and maneuvering in the every-day class struggle. This con-
scious participation is organized and led by the Communists
and the science that determines the moves of the Communists
and their party is Leninism. In these maneuvers and in the
conscious participation in the class struggle a number of
things must be accomplished:

1. The leadership of the Communists over the working

L class in the class struggle must be established.

2. Larger and ever larger masses of workers must be
drawn into the struggle. %

3. In connecting and unifying the many disconnected
struggles of the Workers the army of the working class must
be strengthened and its consciousness developed.

4. Thru careful maneuvering the enemy must be divided
a.I"'1d allies must be Won for the Workers.

5. The divisions and Weaknesses of the enemy must be
exploited inthe movement of the forces of the proletariat.

6. Clear rev“-olutionary direction must be given to all
movements of the Workers so that the intensity of the strug-
gle reaches the climax of a revolutionary struggle for power.

Let us ‘be absolutely clear. The organization of the rev-
olution and the education of the proletariat for it are not
t-a.sks separate and apart from the. revolution itself. The
present day manifestations of the class struggle are an inte-
gral part of the revolution. The success of the Communists
in the organization of the revolution depends upon their abili-
ty to gain inﬂuence in and to shape the events of the present
day class struggle. The extension of the inﬂuence of the
Communists among the workers gradually eliminates from
leadership the opportunist and reformist apostles of class
harmony; it -supplies the Working class With proletarian con-
sciousness, and the class struggle with revolutionary purpose.
Whether the Communists will succeed in achieving their task
depends upon their ability to make themselves a part of the
Working class itself, the most conscious, the most active part
-—not only in name but in fact. The Communists are the van-
guard of the proletariat. They supply it with class conscious-
ness, with revolutionary understanding, with revolutionary
energy and initiative. The opportunist conceives of the rev-

28

 

 

olutionist not as a source of revolutionary ferment among the
Workers but as the pedantic schoolmaster of the Workers.
Fear of action is the opportunist’s dominant characteristic.
The reorganization of the Workers (Communist) Party on
the basis of shop nuclei he opposes because it will make the
Party and its members active. This horriﬁes the Loreite. In
the “Volkszeitung” of September 8th, 1925, a Loreite laments:
“The ﬁrst shop nucleus man who is not deadly silent in his
union and who attempts to carry on real revolutionary pro-
paganda Will be expelled, will no longer ﬁnd a job, or wﬂl be
imprisoned.” “Therefore,” he says, “shop nuclei———a beauti-
ful idea—good for Russia, perhaps for Germany, altho even
there only a hot-house plant, but absolutely impossible in
America.”

Mark the argument: Any worker who would sh-ow his
revol'ution«a.ry principles, wh-o would open his mouth in the
union, who W-ould carry -on revolutionary propaganda among
his fellow Workers in the shop, Would be expelled, black-
listed or incarcerated. Therefore no shop nuclei! But the
conclusion does not end there because it is no-t the nucleus
that brings calamity upon theiirevolutionary worker, but his
mouth. Theref'ore———the Loreite leaves only one conclusion as
to his advice—keep your mouth shut in the union so you may
not be expelled; refrain carefully from propaganda among
your felloW—workers in the shop so you may keep your job;
be an all around good citizen, so you may avoid imprison-
ment. That is the Loreite “revolutionist.” He hangs his
revolu-tionary “principles” on a hook in his closet to take
them out temporarily -once or so a month for display in some
back room at a meeting of the “Federation of International
Workers.” And this miserable phrase monger of a Loreite
dares to desecrate the name of revolutionist by claiming it for
himself.

What are these shop nuclei that Lore did not dare oppose
while in the party and that he now tries to ridicule since
he is out? p s

The Communists are not the army that ﬁghts the battles
for the working class. This is impossible. The emancipation
of the working class can only be achieved by that class itself.
The Communists are merely the vanguard of the proletariat.
The army is the proletariat itself. But the vanguard, the lead-
ing section of the Working class, the Communist Party, must
have its “agents,” its roots, in all parts of the Working class.

29

 

If it has not and is detached from it, it is a mere sect.

The army of the Working class, tho it is numerically strong,
lacks consciousness of its strength. To sweep capitalism
from the earth the working class must move with revolution-
ary speed. ‘ At present it is hardly moving at all. And What-
ever movements this army executes lack a unity of plan and
purpose. In other words: the colossus of the working class
is practically motionless. It is lacking a head and brains to
think for it. Without its directing -center no matter how high
the intelligence of the individual workers may be, the collec-
tive intelligence of the Working class—or any other——amounts
to exactly nothing. With one unifying purpose absent one
intellect negates the other in the mass. It is the revolution-
ary political party of the proletariat, the Communist Party,
that must supply that unity of purpose, that must supply the
collective intelligence of the class, an intelligence that is
based on the rock foundation of Marxism, Leninism, Com-
munism.

But this head, the Communist Party, has no value What-
ever for the body of the colossus of the working class, unless
it is connected with it thru a system of nerves. These nerves
must be supplied by the party units which must penetrate
the Whole body of the Working class. ‘

The Working class presents itself to the Communists
organized in many different groups. There are, ﬁrst of all,
those groups «of Workers organized by capi-talism itself into
productive units in the shops and factories. These organiza-
tions comprise practically the whole Working class. They
include both sexes, all ages, all races. These productive units
of the Working class in the shops, mills, mines and factories
are the basic units of the Working class. Into these basic
units of the working class the ‘Communists must build the
basic unit of their party, the shop nucleus. It is in the shop
where the worker is exploited and Where his resistance to
exploitation takes its ﬁrst form. It is in -the shop Where the
problem of the Worker ﬁrst arises and Where consciousness
ﬁrst develops in the Worker, that his problems andthose of
his fellow-"workers alongside of him in the shop are identical.
And here, at the source of the proletarian struggle, the Com-
munist Party must have its organized agency. If the Commu-
nists are the vanguard of the Workers «they must be that right
there in the shop and for the Workers in the shop. The inﬂu-
ence which a Communist Party can Wield -over the‘ Working

30

   

 

 

class as a whole depends to a large degree upon the inﬂuence
the Communist Workers can yield over their fellow—Workers
in the shop. - _

The centralization an-d discipline -of the Communist Party
supplies the unity of action and of purpose to all of ‘these
nuclei. The will of the Party, the Party’s policies and cam-
paigns revibrate thru the nerve system of its units, the shop
nuclei, and thus must ﬁnd an echo in the working class itself.
And back from the workers in the shop revibnate their feel-
ings, their problems, their troubles, back thru the nuclei and
thus must ﬁnd an echo in the Party and its activities.

The system of nerves built into the body of the working
class by the Communists is not complete in the nuclei. Be-
sides the basic and involuntary units of Workers in the shops
and factories the Workers form many voluntary units which
comprise only parts of the working class. In these organiza-
tions, economic, social, cultural, educiationtal, benevolent, etc.,
the Communists also build their nuclei. But here the organ-
ization of the Communists appears not as a sub-organization
of the Party, but as a fraction of ‘all the Communists. These
fractions enable the Communists to act as »a unit in all of
such organizations in the presentation of Communist prin-
ciples and policies. _

The ‘building up of nuclei and fractions is a necessary
prerequisite for the success of the Communist Party in the
organization of the proletarian revolution. Being means to
this end these party formations cannot escape the hatred of
the inherently counter-revolutionary Loreite opportunists.

lX. Revolutionary Illusions and Realities.

“Marxism distinguishes itself from all other socialist theories
by its-wonderful combination of absolute scientific soberness in the
analysis of the objective situation and the objective trend of develop-
ment, and a decisive recognition of the importance of the revolu-
tionary energy, the revolutionary creative power, the revolutionary
initiative of the masses and naturally also of different individuals,
groups, organizations and parties which succeed in uncovering and
exploiting coinnectin interests with other classes.” Lenin: “Notes
of asocialist Writer,” 1907.

The opportunist fails to see the inner connections and

dialectic relations of all manifestations of the life of society.‘

He flounders helplessly between capital and labor. Vacil1a-
tion isihis, outstanding -characteristic. But whenhe is re-

31

   

proached for his hesitation and fear he conjures up an anal-
ysis that makes an angel out of him——-but that belies the
situation.

Like the murderer to the place of his crime so does the
opportunist return inevitably to. the starting point of his ex-
cursion into the realm of the proletarian revolutionary move-
ment, namely, opposition to, fear and hatred of the proletarian
revoluti-on. This constant backward move of the opportunist
is not executed openly along straight road to reaction. Oh,
no! As beﬁts opportunism its apostles choose different and
devious ways. To uncover these ways, to tear the cloak of

 

revolutionary phrases from the shoulder of- the opportunist‘

and to show him to the proletarian masses in his counter-
revolutionary nakedness, is the duty of the revolu-tionist.

Revolutionary traditions are the most cherished treasury‘

of the proletariat. These traditions inspire and teach the
workers. The bourgeoisie, therefore, does everything to kill
these traditions. That is only natural. But what shall we
say of persons who pose as revolutionists and are busily en-
gaged in killing’ such traditions? ,

The recent Lore discussion in the New York “Volks—
zeitung” has produced a whole ﬂower garden full of oppor-
tunist weeds of this character.

In March, 1924, on the occassion of the anniversary of
the formation of the Communist International, Lore wrote
his leading article «about the adaptability of the Communist
International to changed conditions. Had he stopped there
Lore would "merely have paid a compliment to the revolution-
ary quality of the Comintern. But he went on to say that
“the Communist International utterly disregards its own
orientation, it murders today the theses it adopted only yes-
terday. . . .” Here Lore’»s compliment takes on a more
than dubious character. Is the Communist International so
bare of analytical abilities that it had to feel its way forward

- like a blind man? Was it so stupid that in its analyses it

came to one conclusion while the situation forced upon it
another?

A benevolent interpretation might explain that Lore did
not infer mistakes but merely wanted to show that a con-
stantly changing situation must be met with a constantly

' changing tactic, and that the Communist International adapts

itself to this necessity.
But Lore did not enumerate in this article only tactical

32

 

changes, but also reversals of fundamental policies-—su'ch as
in the question of parliamentarism or in trade union work.
The late Lore discussion in the “Volkszeitung” uncovered
some more of this Loreite carcass, -real and unadulterated
opportunism. The Communist International started out with
an entirely wrong orientation according to the Loreites. It
suffered under the illusion that there existed a revolutionary
situation.

“Drunken with the victory of the newly established S-0-
viet Government they considered it certain that the Russian
revolution would be followed by the revolution for the free-
dom of all Europe. . . .” But nothing became of these
hopes! It was all a mistake. It was a day dream produced
by an overdose of revolutionary spirit. Our opportunists, the
Loreites, would never render them-selves guilty of such an
overindulgence in revolutionary spirit. They are sober, care-
ful, realistic. So sober are they indeed, so careful and real-
istic, that they feel perfectly justified in indignantly raising
their brows at the “mistake” of Lenin. With the spirit of the
narrow-minded, ignorant and reactionary schoolmaster they
pass judgment on the revolutionary spirit of Lenin.

But all this judgment is mere pose. This pose is born
of a deep satisfaction with the ability of capitalism to have
maintained itself up to now against the attacks of the prole-
tarian revolution. In this suppressed enthusiasm for the tem-
porary defeat of the proletarian revolution the Loreites forget
for a moment their claim to realism. -Of the most realistic
leader of the proletariat, Lenin, they make an enthusiast,
swayed by sentiment and blind to realities. “Drunken with
victory” Lenin rushed into the formation of the Communist
Internationa1,—that is the Loreites’, picture of Lenin. We
answer: “Drunken with a suppressed hatred against the
revolution the Loreites distort history and try to besmir-ch the
memory of the proletariat’s greatest leader, Lenin.” On
March 23rd, 1919, only a few days after the formation of the
Communist International, Lenin spoke before Congress of the
Russian Communist Party, saying: “The bourgeoisie, taking
it as a world institution, is still stronger than we are.” And
a little further on in his speech he repeated: “If we regarded
the material ‘means on a world-wide scale we must a.dmit

that the bourgeoisie is materially still stronger than we are.”

33

The dead Lenin stands up against the calumnies of the Lore-
ites, just as the living principles of Leninism stand up against
the anti-revolutionary poison of opportunism.

Lenin was all wrong, they say. But, unbelievable as it
may seem, although all the opportunists, coun~ter-revolution-
ists, and capitalists of the world urged him to, he never ad-
mitted this mistake. Just think of it. “Although the German
revolution was defeated yet Moscow still clung_to the convic-
tion that only a little push was needed in Italy to get a revo-
lution, made to order, ready and victorious.” This is not a
quotation from one of the numerous phantastic reports of
the agents of the American Defense Society and directed
against the Communist International and against Soviet Rus-
sia. No; this is clipped from the “New York Vo1kszeitung”
of September 17th, 1925.

Moscow’s revolutionary optimism was. incurable. That
is the judgment of the Loreites. After Noske, Scheideman
and Ebert had proven wi-th the blood of tens of thousands of
murdered German proletarians that there was no revolution-
ary situation, Moscow still insisted that there was one, and
that, therefore, Italy had tol“make” a revolution. Before
we consult the Loreites further on this matter let us see What
happened in Italy. The Socialist Party of Italy had a strong
left wing which demanded aﬂiliation with the Communist In-
ternational. The right wing held a separate c-onference and
decided not to submit to such a decision and to split. Under
these conditions the Communist International instructed the
left wing to carry on a relentless struggle against the right
wing and to take the party away from them. Serati, one of
the leaders of the left wing, refused to do so, but instead com-
promised with the right wing. The Communists then split.
Servati later saw his error and corrected it.

 

But another thing had happened. The metal-workers"

of Italy, in order to enforce a wage demand made on the
bosses, took possession of the factories. That any conscious
attempt to turn this action into a political struggle would
have very probably resulted in a victory for the Italian work-
ers is now clear. Gioliti, the Italian prime minister of those
days, admitted later in the chamber of deputies, that he did
not immediately proceed against these workers in the fac-
tories because he did not have reliable military forces and
because his move in that direction would have forced the
workers into the political battleﬁeld where they were strongest

34

 

at this moment. Instead of that Gioliti relied upon Italian’
variety of opportunists, upon D’Aragona and Turati, to hold
the workers bac'k from a political battle and thus starve and
negotiate them out of the factories. This is history. What
say our American D’Aragonas about this history? “Out of
the Italian revolution developed the Fascist revolution.
Mussolini copies Lenin . . . blood ﬂowe-d in streams
. the Communist movement in Italy is now illegal.”
Turati may ‘be a traitor, D’Aragona a scoundrel and Modigli-
ani a betrayer of the Workers; but why balk a.bout such little
things? “The decisive point in Italy is not the treachery of
the opportunist scoundrels of the Socialist Party of Italy,”
say the Loreites. Oh, no! The decisive point, according to
them, is the fact that the Communist International insisted
on a clear division in the revolutionary movement of the
Italian proletariat between the opportunist traitors and the
Communists. The American Turatis in the Lore camp will
never forgive this act of the Communist In-ternational. They
see in it the forerunner of the separation of the American
Communist movement from them. . And this separation they
do’ not welcome, "because it will be harder for them to betray
and handicap the revolutionlary movement outside than it
would be as were they ‘part of it.

Let us read further in the Loreist history. “In Germany
the Communists attempted to ‘make’ a revolution. . .
The prisons are yet chock full of sentenced comrades” as a
result. Here speaks Loreism! Here speaks opportunism!
Here speaks hatred of the proletarian revolution! Here speaks
counter-revolution!

Hail Noske! The Loreites have decreed that you are not
a traitor, that you are not the murderer of revolutionary
workers, that you are not the treacherous agent of German
capital. You are merely the instrument thru which history
proved to the world in general and to the Loreites in partic-
ular, thiat Germany was not yet ripe for the proletarian rev-
olu-tion.

Thus speak Social Democrats and opportunists. Thus
speak Loreites. ‘

‘The imperialist war had broken the chain of international
capitalism at its Weakest 1ink——Russia. Absolutism died there
of its own inner rottenness. The capitalist class of Russia took
over political rule from absolutism as its natural inheritance.
But the right to this inheritance was disputed. The capitalist

35

 

revolution had been born too late in Russia. The working
class was already strong and class conscious. What it lacked
in numerical strength was made up by a perfect ideological
ripeness for revolution. This ripeness had been carefully de-
veloped and cultivated by the Bolsheviks in ﬁfteen years of
unrelenting struggle against opportunism. The proletariat
challenged the usurped prerogative of the capitalist class to
rule. The capitalist class was defeated. The ﬁrst great battle
of the revolution was Won. The prozletlarian revolution was
ushered in.

This event shook the capitalist World to its foundations.
It brought back to the workers of the world their revolution-
ary conﬁdence which was shaken by the betrayal of the Sec-
ond International. It was this event in Russia that ended the
World War. It Was this revolution that set the forces into
motion which ma-de emigrants out of the Hohenzollern and
the I-Bapsburg. It was this upheaval that set the masses of
Germany, of Austria, of Hungary, of Italy into motion against
their rulers and exploiters.

For Weeks workers’ councils were the undisputed rulers
in Germany. The bankruptcy of capitalism was attested to
by Soviet Republics in Hungary and Bavaria. For many days
the Italian proletariat could remain unchallenged in posses-
sion of the factories. In this atmosphere the Communist In-
ternational was born. The Weak connections which the loyal
revolutionary workers had saved out of the shameful debacle
o-f the Second International, and which were strengthened

during the war by the left of Zimmerwald and Kienthal, were I

crystallized in Moscow in 1919 into the'Communist Interna-
tional. The Communist International was the child of revo-
lutionary determination as well as of a revolutionary situa-
tion. . '

“But Where is the victory?”, ask the Loreites. “History,”
-answers Marx, “could be made easily indeed if a battle need
only be accepted under conditions of a predetermined victory.”

For sevenal years the World was 'aﬂa'me With revolution.
International capitalism made frantic efforts to save itself.
It was saved, for a time. But it was saved not by its own in-
herent strength. It was saved by the inherent weakness of
the working class. And this weakness, in turn, was caused
by the bacillus of opportunism.

What does it mean when Loreism, the American variety

36

 

of opportunism, now claims and declares that the Communist
International, in its beginning, had a wrong, an unreal orien-
tation? What is the object of lying away some glorious chap-
ters of proletarian struggle? Why kill in the world proletariat
the memory of the traditions of these struggles? Wlrat pur-
pose do these Loreist gentry serve when they declare unblush-
ingly that there was no revolutionary situation?

The defeat of the German, the Austrian, the Hungarian,

the Italian proletariats in the struggles of 1918-1921 was the

fruit of the treachery of international Menshevism, of oppor-
tunism. When ‘the scepter of political rule sank from the
enervated hands o-f capitalism to be taken up by the prole-
tariat, then the opportunist leaders of the workers, the Men-
sheviks and Social-Democrats, took it up—in the name of the
workers——and used it in the interests of the capitalists.

“There was no revolutionary situation,” say our oppor-
tunists, say our Loreites. So says Berger. They all have
good reasons to agree on that point. They aim to stamp our
martyrs, our Liebknechts, our Luxemburg-s,_our Levienes, our
Szamuelis, as fools. They try to’ picture them dying in chase
of a phantom, so that the crimes of their brother opportunists
may be hidden. They must soil the memory of our martyrs
so that the deeds of their murderers may be forgotten.

Thus Loreism decrees that the Communist International
was wrong in believing that there was a revolutionary situa-
tion. Otto Bauer comes into his own with this latest edition
of American opportunism. “The relation of forces favors the
capitalists; therefore the proletarian revolution is premature,”
says Bauer. The Loreites -subscribe to Bauer’s analysis; they
reject the analysis of the Communist International. They
are brothers of Bauer and not followers. o-f the Communist
International. -

Liebknecht staked his life» on his “belief” in the timeliness
of the proletarian revolution. Noske staked the life of his
mercenaries in his “belief” in its untimeliness. Noske Won.
“Therefore,” so say the Loreites, “Noske was right in his be-
lief; Liebknecht was Wrong. The Social-Democrats were
right; the Communist International was wrong; the murderers
were right; their victims were wrong.”

Workers! Do you see the road these opportunists travel?
Do you realize whither it leads?

37,

  

answer was: “Loreism is opposition to the theories of Com-
munism; Loreism is antagonism to the tactics of the Commu-
nist International and its American section, the Workers
(Communist) Party of America.”

Hatred against the Communist International was the out-
standing feature of most contributor-s to this discussion. The
spirit of counter—r-evolution prevailed in them.

And the inspirer, the guardian angel of the paradise of
American opportunists in the “Federation of Internatio-nal
Workers” is Ludwig Lore, the editor of the “New York Volks-
zeitung.”

“Only Communists can participate in this discussion,”
declared Lore. Communists indeed! Communists of his
caliber—Communists to Lore’s liking! By permitting the
articles of his friends to "appear, by failing to take issue even
with the most treacherous expression in them, by being a
member and the leader of the organization of these traitors
to Communism, by expressing the same views as these Lore-
ites, Lore identiﬁes him-self with every word written in this
discussion, and is responsible for every word.

This pamphlet aims tor take issue with Loreism, with
opportunism. We must combat it. We must cleanse our
party and the Whole proletarian movement in America of this

 

menace of potential counter-revolution. We must steel our- '

selves and our party against the anti-proletarian inﬂuences of
this opportunism and these op-portunists, and in that way
improve our revolutionary understanding and the revolution-
ary value of our party for the proletariat.

X. American Illusions and Realities.

“These pcdants and sceptics should learn from the theoretician
and leader of the proletariat how to believe in revolution; they
should learn how to. induce the workers to s-olve their revolutionary
tasks to the last; they should learn ‘how to preserve will-power and
confidence enough to withstand faint-hearted despair even in the
face of temporary failure of the revolution.

“These pcdants of Marxism are of the opinion that all this is
ethical chatter, romanticism and absence of realism. No, gentle-
men! This is the combination of revolutionary theory with revol¢u-
tionary practice. It is the combination without which Marxism
turns into Brentanoism, Struveism and Sombartism.* The Marxian
doctrine has combined the theory and the practice of the class stru-
gle into one indivisible whole. And they are not Marxians, who,
instead of soberly stating the objective situation, -misuse the theory
to justify existin conditions, and who even go so far as to adapt
themselvles quickly to every ebb of the revolutionary wave, who, in
the quickest way possible throw away their ‘revolutionary illusions’
and bein to ather up ‘realistic fragmen‘ts.”’ Lenin: “Introduction
to Marx’ letters to Kugelm-an.”

The Communists have conﬁdence in the revolutionary
powers of the proletariat. The opportunists have conﬁdence
in -the counter—revolutionary powers of the bourgeoisie. They
call confidence in the revolutionary powers of the proletariat,
illusions and revolutionary romanticism, while their own co-n-
ﬁdence in the c-ounter—revolution»ary powers of the bourgeois
they label realism. ~

The conﬁdence of the Communist in the revolutionary
powers and qualities of the proletariat is based on his knowl-
edge of -the laws of capitalist development. He sees not only
what appears to be but he can analyze whatiis. Outward
strength does not hide from him inner weakness.

The opportunist sees the growing powers of monopoly,
the ever more brutal use of the state power by these monopo-
lies and he concludes: “Capitalism was never further from
revolution than it is toidzay.” -

 

The Communist sees the increasing socialization of labor‘

thru the ‘growth of centralize-d production; he sees the an-
tagonisms growing within the society a:s a result of the grow-
ing monopolies; he sees in the ever more brutal use of the
state power by monopolistic capital the outward manifesta-

the reactionary Russian bourezoisie. Ludwing Brentano and Wer-
ner Sombart: German bourgeois §ocialist professors.

38

‘ tion of the growing resistance to it; he sees in this application

of ever growing ‘powers the manifestation of an ever growing
weakness of the system, he sees that capitalism tries to
strengthen its hold on society with bayonets because it wants
to counteract its constantly weakening economic domination;
he sees how capitalism arms the proletariat, its enemy, for
the defense of its last tre-nch; he sees the imperialist antago-

‘ nisms grow, with the result that war gains a state of perma-

nency in present day capitalistic society; he sees these things
and comes to the conclusion that the age of imperialism,
though the stageof highest powers of capitalism, is the age
of dying capitalism, and that capitalism was never nearer
revolution than it is today.

Our Loreite opportunist laughs at the idea that a revolu-
tionary party should have hope of success even in the United
States. He is opposed to revolution. His promise is: No
revolution. An-d from this premise he reasons backwards to
causes. Capitalism is. too strong for a revolution. That is
his excuse here. Capitalism is too weak; that was his excuse
in Germany; that was the Mensheviks’ excuse in Russia.
There they said that the prerequisite of revol-utio-n_is the de-

' velopment of the productive forces of society. If, as in Russia,

these forces are not yet developed, or if, as in Germany after
the war, the productive machinery is disorganized, “we” can-
not make a revolution. A revolution, so they reasoned, would
kill the very machine, capitalism, which we need to accom-
plish an absolutely necessary task, that of constructing or re-
constructing the productive forces.

The American reformist, on the other hand, declares:
“Capitalism is too strong there. The -productive forces in the
United States are developed to the highest pitch. That puts
too great power in the capitalist class; too great for the
workers to tackle.”

There is no contradiction in these seemingly different .

conclusions. The different conclusions are merely accidental
to different countries. The decisive thing is the premise.
And that premise is, here as there:—No revolution.

It is true; American capitalism was the victor in the war.
But its victory has not negated the forces that are Working
within it for its downfall. On the contrary. These forces
have been augmented. The growing strength of American
capitalism intensiﬁes its contradiction to the needs of society.
The speed with which capitalism races upward ' “eases in

39

 

the same ratio the distance which separates the capitalist class
from all the other classes in society.

The growing strength of capitalism goes hand in hand
with, and is impossible without, a constant shift in the social
groupings in society. This change is invisible to the eye of
the opportunist. He repeats phrases. He speaks of the work-
ing class and does not mean the working class but merely
means a portion of the workers, the aristocracy of labor, the
skilled workers. The millions of unskilled workers in the
basic industries, poorly paid and exploited to the utmost, are
a negligible quantity for the opportunist. He cannot perceive
the never-slackening levelling process which gradually elimi-
nates not only the differences between the well paid, skilled
and the poorly paid unskilled worker, but also decisively af-
fects the difference between the working class on the one
hand and the lower strata of the petty bourgeoisie on the
other. This process is increasing in speed.

During the last twenty years the tendency of an unparal-
lele=d enrichment of the capitalist class and the gradual and
comparative impoverization of all other classes in society has
been progressing and gaining momentum.

In 1904 there were a t-otal number of 216,180 manufac-
turing esta-bli-shments in the United States. They employed
a total of 5,468,383 wage earners. The total value of their
products amounted to $14,793,902,563,000. Of all these manu-
facturing establishments there we-re 1900 that produced each
one million or more dollars worth of products p-er year. That
is 0.9 per cent of the total number of manufacturing plants.
These 0.9 per cent employed 25.6 per cent of all the workers
an'd manufactured 38.9 per cent of -all the products.

Since then the process o-f centralization has proceeded
without interruption. The following ﬁgures speak volumes:

Since the many subsidiary organizations owned and co-n-
trolled by the big trusts, the steel trust, the oil trust, the
packing trust, etc., ﬁgure -as independent -establishments in
the government statistics, it is clear that the real numbers and
real percentages are considerably below the ones given. But
even the ﬁgures given sufﬁce to prove the point. An insigni-
ﬁc-ant number, barely one-tw-entieth of all manufacturing

establishments, employ three-ﬁfths of all the workers and

manufacture exactly two--thirds of all the products. The tre-
mendous stimulation of the process of centralization by the
needs of the war was followed by a temporary downward
movement, which in turn was succeeded by a decided a.nd
persistent turn upward again. 1

Every shift in these ﬁgures means new recruits for the
working class from the petty bourgeoisie and the farmers;
it means a decisive attack against the illusion of the petty

’ bourgeois that his class is merely an anti-cham-ber to the

heaven -of the big bourgeoisie; it means a consolidation of the
-proletariat as a class; it means the growth of all the forces
that make for the downfall of capitalism.

And in the face of this, the opportunist claims: “Nothing
has changed: no revolution is in sight; people who see a
-change are revolutionary r-omuanticists; we are the only genu-
ine rea}lists.” Twenty-three years ago Lenin characteriz-ed
these realists; “Weak and vacillating in theoretical questions,
with a narrow view, justifying his political ﬂabbiness with the
spontaneity of the masses, «a man who looks more like a trade
union secretary than like a leader of masses, incapable of
working out a comprehensive and bold plan which can com-
mand respect even from the enemy, inexperienced, clumsy,-—
I beg of you——that is not a revolutionist, but a wretched
b1underer.”

XI. Colonial Illusions and Realities.

“We must not only build independent revolutionary groups. and
‘ parties in all. countries; we must not only propagate the formation
of peasants’ councils and try to adapt the Sov‘iet organizations to the
pre-capitalist conditions; but the Communist International must also
declare and establish theoretically that it is possible for backward
countries with the help of the proletariat of the advanced countries
to establish a soviet oranization and for the soviets, by stages, to
reach Communism, avoiding the capitalist system.” Lenin: Speech
on Colonial Question, Second World Congress of Communist Inter-
national, 1920.

“The revolution in the colonies will not be a Communist revolu
tion in the beginning; if, however, the Communist advance guard
immediately puts itself at the head, then the revolutionary masses
will be brought on the riht road on which they will gradually gather
revolutionary experiences to reach the established goal.” Supple-
mentary Theses to Colonial Question, adopted by Second World
Congress of Co-mmunist International, 1920.

Imperialism is the stage -of -decaying capitalism. This is
a well established Leninist principle. The opportunist denies
this—-if not in theory then surely in practice. The imperialist
power of American capitalism is m-ore convincing to him than
Leninism. And when Leninism, in a. last effort to convince,
points out that the very strength of capitalism in the epoch
of imperialism turns into its weakness, the opportunist an-
swers with a deiprecating remark about the “revolutionary
illusions” of the Leninist.

sions are a result of the growing insufﬁciency of the homeland
as a market, as a soruce of raw material, as an opportunity
for the investment of constantly accumulating new capital.
This need of expansion creates an acute and permanent con-
ﬂ-ict with all other imperialist and expanding governments.
War becomes an ever present reality. It forces capitalism to
arm its workers at home to suppress and keep in check the
proletarian -and peasant masses of the colonies. It necessitates
the arming of these colonial proletari.ans and peasants for the
imperialist wars of the home government. It creates the in-
soluble contradiction of an ever increasing socialization of .
production on the one hand, and an ever decreasing circle of
individual capitalists exercising control over it, on the other.

i The opportunist refuses to see that the imperialist expan-
. p ‘.
l

The epoch of imperialism makes every section of the
world an inseparable part of every other section. As a result,

42

any event in -one part of the world has its seroius repercus-
sions in the other. Thus the vulnerability of capitalism is
increased tremendously.

The opportunist ﬁails to see thi-s side of imperialism. He
retains the attitude of the Second International on the ques-
tion of the struggles of'colonial and semi-colonial peoples.
He does not see that these struggles form part of the general
struggle for emancipation of the proletariat. The basis for
the stand of the opportunist is his fear of and opposition to
all revolutionary struggles. -

But, like in all of his reformism, the opportunist attempts
to hide his non-revolutio-nary and anti-revolutionary stand on
this question with a radical phrase. To demonstrate a shin-

“ing example of this tactic, let Lore s-peak.

On June 8, 1925, he Wrote invthe “Volkslzeitung”; speak-
ing about the Chinese situation:

“Here we have to deal with a struggle not yet against capitalism
nor yet a battle for a Communist Society, but with a nation»al.move-
ment which hopes to re-conquer China for the Chinese by driving’
out the foreign big capitalist imperialism.

“Naturally, this is a Utopla—-especially so since China is un-
armed and there is little possibility for it to exert itself against the
militaristically well armed imperialism of Europe, the United states
and Japan. '

“But even if the possibility to drive out forein imperialism did
exist, what would be the ain? The place of the American, British
and Japanese capitalists would be taken by the Chinese capitalists,
whose suppression of their own countrymen would be no less brutal,
whose robbery of their wae slaves at the tenderest years of child-
hood, of their health and happiness would be no less merciless than
that of their Japanese, American, British, French or German class
colleagues heretofore.

“For the Chinese proletariat. also. there is no other road t.o
freedom than that of the proletarian revolution. BUT, OF'CO-URSE,
CHINA IS NOT THAT FAR YET BY A LONG WAY." (Emphasis
mine—M. B.).

There are two typical Loreisms contained in this. One
is a tactical and the other a theoretical monstrosity.

The tactical Loreism is obvious: opposition to struggle.
“You cannot Win,” says Lore to the Chinese revolutionists,
“because your opponent has better weapons. But even if you

- Win, it will be all the same to you because in place of the

foreign capitalist you will ‘be exploitevd by your native capi-
talist. So why ﬁght?” Why ﬁ'ght?——tha:t is the conclusion

43

 

 

of all considerations of the Loreite opportunist. His theory
is merely incidental. The theory serves the purpose of prov-
ing in all cases tha-t the answer to the question “Why ﬁght?”
must be: No.

Now to the theory of this gem of Loreism.

“To support the struggle for the overthrow of foreign
rule in the colonies does not mea.n to subscribe to the national
aspirations of the native bourgeoisie but it rather means to
point the way to the proletariat of the colonies to its eman-
cipation,” so say the theses of the Communist International
on this question. Is the Communist International correct-
or Lore?

The expansion of -capital to colonies as ;a. result of having
outgrown the boundary lines of the homeland shows the im-
portance -of the colonies to the national economy of the home-
land. A rebellion in the colony seriously disturbs, and a vic-

tory of the rebels completely upsets, capitalist economy in

the homeland. Capitalist economy needs the colonies. Their
loss initiates the collapse of this economy and the end of the
system. A «serious nsationalist revolutionary struggle of a
colonial or semi-colonial country is the beginning of the pro-
-letarian revolutionary struggle in the home country.

But aside from this international aspect of a colonial
rebellion Loreism is also comnpletely wrong in its considera-
tion of the internal aspects.
case of Menshevism. The Bolshevik revolution in Russia was
condemned by the Mensheviks because of its “untimeliness.”
The Mensheviks, too, said: “For the Russian proletariat there
is no -other roa-d t-o freedom than that of t-he proletarian revo-
lution. But, of course, Russia is not that far yet by a long
way.” They declared that Russia must go thru_ a period of
capitalist rule», and that, therefore, the task of the proletariat

R is not to defeat but to defend the capitalists.

Lore’s M-enshevism comes to this conclusion: China
cannot escape cavpitalist rule. Therefore what is the use of
fighting against it? From this Loreite position there is only
a very short step to the position of the Social-chauvinists.
The latter start from the same premise: “The colonies can
not escape capitalism.” From this premise they proceed:
“Since the imperialist homeland forces capitalism into the
colonies they carry -on ‘socialist work,’ preparing the colo-ni-es
for revolution. Colonial uprisings, therefore, are essentially

44

We meet here with a typical

reactionary. The colonization policy of the imperialist gov-

ernment must be supported. All that we ‘Socialists’ can ﬁght

against are ‘bad methods’ of colonization.” _ That is the colo-
nial policy of the Social—chauvinists. It differs little from that
of the opportunists. Its theory is exactly the same. Its prac-
tice differs only so long as it remains theory.

. The Communist, in clear contradiction to the Loreite
opportunist, knows that the productive forces of any back-
ward -country can be developed also under proletarian rule.
He knows that the existence of proletarian rule in Russia is
a most important factor in the prospects for a success of a
colonial rebellion. H-e knows that the duty of the Commu-
nists ‘is not to speculate a'bout the success of a colonial or
semi-colonial revolt, but to support it by mobilizing the work-
ers at home against the same forces against whom the colo-
nial or semi—co1onia1 rebels are ﬁghting.

Loreist oepportunisrm always looks for the best reasons
why not to fight. Communism always looks for the best
methods how to fight.

CONCLUSION.

“Reformist tendencies have nothing“ in common with Commu-
nism. . . . The difference between Socialists and Communists is
just this—that the former refuse to do what we (the Communists)
do under all conditions, namely, to carry on revolutionizin activi-
ties.” Lenin: Speech, Second World Congress of Communist Inter-
national on Twenty-one Points, 1920.

The Loreit-e opportunist has no theory. In place of the
unifying science of Marxism he sets up e-clecticism. He does
not base his position on his theory, but he theorizes about
his position.

The Loreite opportunists pride themselves on their origi-
nality as thinkers and revolutionists. In their two months of
discussion of Communism, of the Workers (Communist)
Party and of the Communist Internuational, they pointed again
and again to their new and different ideas. They ridicule the
dependency of the Communists on “oracles from Moscow.”

The ‘Communist, on the other hand, is not concerned
with the originality but with the correctness of his stand. He
cheri-shes in the Communist International the collective ex-
perience and wisdom o-f the revolutionary movement of the
world. And in the originality of the ideas of the Loreite

45

 

opportunist the Communist sees the absence of Marxian-
Leninist theory. The variety of ‘bright ideas’ of the opportu-
nist Loreite is the -outgrowth of the absence -of one idea, a
unifying theory.

The duty of the Communist to carry on revolutionizing.
activities determines his stand toward opportunism. Within a

the ranks of a Communist Party the theory of inactivity, as
personiﬁ-ed by the opportunist, becomes a serious menace. It
paralyzes the party. It poisons the theoretical understand-
ing of the party members. It acts as at counter-revolutionary
inﬂuence Within the advance guard of the army of the prole-
tarian revolution.

To combat this menace is one of the revolutionizing ac-
tivities the Communists are always ready to carry on and one
that must be carried on with double energy on counter-revo-
lutionary week—days. ' ‘

In true Bolshevik fashion the Communists set out to
cleanse the ranks of their Party and t-he science, of their
theory of all opportunist poison, and thus execute the com-
mand of their greatest leader, Lenin, who said:

“To make clear to the masses the inevitability and necessity of
a separation from opportunism, to educate these masses to revolu-

tion by a pitiless struggle against opportunism . . . that is the
correct Marxian aim of the International proletarian movement.”

l. The Background of the Problem.

‘‘It is our task to continually remodel those elements who (in
the days -of revolutionary turmoil, M. B.), co-me to us . . . but
who do not possess persistency enough to ﬁght not only on revolu-
tionary holidays but also on counter-revolutionary weekdays.”
Lenin: “Liquidation of the Liquidators,” 1909.

The news of the victory of the Russian workers over
their bourgeoisie in November, 1917, enthused the proletariat
of the world. It regained its revolutionary sellf-conﬁdence.
The pessimism of the masses with regard to their own future,
which often took the unnatural form of optimism for the
future welfare of their immediate enemy, the bourgeoisie,
gradually gave way to new independent proletarian class life.
Even the politically most backward workers began to raise
their heads higher. And this new life, this new hope, this
new enthusiasm, manifested itself in a general way in a revo-
lutionary advance of the proletarian masses.

This change of the state‘of mind of the proletarian mas-
ses also changed the attitude of many of the leaders -of the
workers. In Germany, for instance, the Scheidemanns,
Eberts, and Noskes turned over night from ilackeys of the
Kaiser into “leaders” of the revolution against the Kaiser. One
day they bowed t=o “his Majesty, the Emperor”; but the next
day they bowed without hesitation to “His Majesty, the Revo-
lutionary Proletariat.” One day they bowed to the Kaiser,
using their inﬂuence over the masses to prevent the revolu-
tion, the next day they bowed to the revolution in order to
maintain their inﬂuence over the masses so that they might
betray it. '

In those days the menace of opportunism -showed its real
face, that of the most formidable enemy 0-f the proletariat,
causing its temporary defeat. A working class whose leading
strata or party was educated in the revolutionary theory and
practice of Marxism would not have fallen victim to this
treachery. With such a party at the head of the workers, the
ﬁrst ‘betrayal of leaders, as that of Scheidemann in 1914,
would have been difﬁcult; the second betrayal in 1918 would
have been impossil~‘.e.

The growth of revolutionary conﬁdence of the proletarian

masses as a result of the Russian revolution not only changed
the tactics of the social chauvinists but also those of the social
paciﬁsts. In a self-deceptive enthusiasm the latter passed
off their pa-ciﬁsm for internationalism, and their sickly senti-
mentalism of “brotherly love” as international cllass solidarity.
The revolutionary holiday transformed these peaceful lambs
into imitations of roaring lions. A successful continuance
of the universal revolution would either have transformed
these elements into genuine and faithful servants of the revo-
lution or it would have thrown them to the surface as counter-
revolutionary refuse.

The course of the proletarian revolution, however, is not
a -straight line upward to success. While it marches onward
and ‘upward to victory with irresistible accuracy it meets many
obstacles and temporary setbacks. Temporarily the revolu-
tionary holiday makes room for the counter-revolutionary
weekday, Revolution takes on the face of counter—revolu-
tion, not as an indication of defeat for the proletariat, but as
a demonstration of the difficulties which the revolution en-
counters in its road. On these counter-revolutionary week-
days the work of the revolutionist is not inspired by the en-
thusiasm which is generated by success within reach. In
these days the enthusiasm must be supplied by theoretical
understanding and conviction. The work on the barricades
which, in spite of its dangers, appeals to the romantic soul,
makes room in these days for the tedious detail work of the
everyday struggle. The success of this work ha-s no spectac-
ular features and can be understood and judged only by its
relation to the general position and advance -of the working
class in the class struggle.

Those are the trying hours of the convert of revolutionary
days. He sees victory slipping away from the revolution.
He takes the attitude of waiting for better opportunities in-
stead of exploiting existing opportunities for the struggle and
for its organization. He introduces his old and worm-eaten
phrases of brotherly love and universal peace to replace the
principles of unrelenting class struggle. His belief in the
revolutionary power of the working class vanishes and all
energies left to him he spends in trying to foist his own pes-
simism upon the party and upon the working class as a whole.
To avoid any responsibility he denies the role of leadership of
a revolutionary party and transfers the revolutionary initia-

5

 

 

tive from the party to the masses; instead of marching ahead
he proposed to limp behind the masses. And all these changes

he ascribes to his realism, which “recognizes the absence of a

revolutionary situa.tion.”

A Communist Party can overcome this tendency in its
ranks only by increased activities and by an energetic cam-
paign of cleansing i-ts rank-s from any leading elements who

represent and propagate these tendencies.

 

 

The Workers (Communist) Party of America is face to
face with such a tendency in the form of Loreism. Loreism
is revolutionary pessimism. To meet the situation, this pes-
simism advances its own tactic, opportunism, the tactic of
inaction. The Communists must meet this tendency; they
must ﬁght it. They must eradicate it from their Party ‘and
kill its inﬂuence in -the working class.

Loreism attempts to make itself and the world believe
that it alone withstood the wave of revolutionary romanticism
which originated with the November revolution in Russia.
In reality it was its only victim and now when the wave has
receded it becomes the torch bearer of revolutionary disap-
pointment. It is revising its “revolutionary” orientation of
the period of illusions and returns to its old and unadulterated
opportunism. Terriﬁed by its o-wn dream of yesterday of a
revolutionary success, it now attempts with all its power to
prevent revolutionary success for the morrow.

It i-s the period of counter—revolutionary weekdays in
which this opportunism raises its head most consistently and
in which it is most dangerous. It is in these days when the
Bolshevik qualities of the Communists are tested. And it is
in these days when all those who fail in this test must be
removed not only from the position of leadership but also
from the ranks of the Party.

II. The Essence of the Problem.

“One of the most indispensable conditions for the preparation
of the proletariat for its victory is a difficult, persevering, inexorable
struggle against opportunism, reformism, social-chauvinism and such
other bourgeois influences and tendencies which a proletariat in
capitalist surroundings can not escape. Without such a strugle,
without a complete victory over opportunism (and anarchism.) within
the labor movement, there can be no hope for a proletarian dictator-
ship. Bolshevism could not have defeated the bourgeoisie in 1917-
1919 if it had not learned before, 1903-1917, to defeat and pitilessly

drive out of the party of the proletarian vanuard, the Mensheviks,
that is -the o-pportunists, reformists and social-chauvinists.” Lenin:
“Elections to the Constituent Assembly and the Dictatorship of the
Proletariat,” 1919.

Opportunism is a serious menace; it is a slow but deadly
poison—deadly to revolutionary understanding, to revolution-
ary self-conﬁ-dence and energy. With disastrous effects this
poison had penetrated the Second International of the revolu-
tionary w-orkers, causing its utter collapse at the ﬁrst serious
crisis. Under the ruins of this structure were buried the
hopes and the live-s of millions of toilers. ' ‘

Few revolutionists were unaffected by this poison; still
fewer understood and uncovered its deadly character and
attempted to eliminate it from the ‘body of the organizations
of the revolutionary proletariat.

These few, the greatest of whom was Lenin, became the
leaders of a new, a truly revolutionary International, which
keeps the weapon of the revolutionary class struggle free
from the devastating breed of the bacillus of opportunism.
In this new International the hope expressed by Frederick
Engels at the death of the First International ﬁnds it-s fulﬁll-
ment; it is “a Communist International, built on the solid
foundations of the revolutionary principles of Karl Marx,”———
fortiﬁed by the invulnerable principles of Leninism.

Opportunism is the fundamental tendency of a social
group that ha-s nothing to hope for in the future. This group
is the petty bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeois fears and hates
big capital ‘because the pressure of its monopolies pushes him
out of his position in society. But he loves capitalism. He
fears and hates the workers, because he sees in their struggle
for a better existence a fundamental struggle against capital-
ism itself. With his longing eyes fixed on the position of a
big ‘bourgeois, on a heaven of richness and independence, he
is in reality quickly moving toward the hell of a proletarian
existence. Seeing in his sober moments this real future
before him, he_ searches for his ideals in the past. But the
past has no future. Thus the petty bourgeois ﬁnds himself
hanging on to some substanceless abstractions like “justice,”
“liberty,” “peace” and “brotherhood.” -

Chasing these phantoms the petty bourgeois alternately
tries to recruit the proletariat against big capitaﬂ—or big cap-
ital against the proletariat. But because it is without a con-
structive program of its own, the petty bourgeoisie is unable
