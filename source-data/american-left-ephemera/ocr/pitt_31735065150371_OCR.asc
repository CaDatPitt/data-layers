PORT COLBORNE—-—A bargaining program for 1954 contract

renewals with the many industries and corporations in Canada with A» 1
' Whom Mine-Mill holds bargaining rights, approved unanimously by ~

the Sixth Annual Convention of the Canadian section of the Interna-

tional Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, held here the first

week of March, promises higher living standards, greater job secur-

ity, higher standards of welfare and ‘improved security and living

standards in retirement.

Heading the list of proposed contract demands for Mine-Mill 

Canada this year is a minimum increase of 15 cents an hour covering
wages, welfare, shift premiums, premium pay for Saturday and Sun-
day work, and other aspects of contract demands presented by the

, different locals. ‘

In addition, the convention called for a determined battle to be

. PORT COLBORNE—-The importance of independent political ac-
tion to defend the democratic rights of organized labor, and to secure
improved "social legislation was one of the main features of the Mine-

Mill program discussed by more than 100 delegates at the annual,

Canadian Convention. \

It was decided to establish political action committees in each
Canadian Mine-Mill local where they are not yet in existence.

Denouncing the “importation of McCarthyism in Canada," many
delegates pointed to amendments to the Criminal Code known as

. Bill 7, and to Bills 19'and 20 in the province of Quebec, as immediate

threats to the very existence of the whole labor movement in Canada.

A resolution pointed out that “if Bill 7 is to be defeated, a full
scale campaign must be undertaken immediately by the Convention.”
Sudbury Local 598 is on record as having sent 10,000 post cards to

waged this year for improved pension
plans permitting workers to retire
voluntarily at the age of 60 on pensions
they would have received at 65, with
the pensions determined by the best 10
years’ earnings rather than the last 10
years.

A new demand put forward by Mine-
Mill will be for severance pay for work-
ers who leave their employers. This
will be based. on five per centgof the
employee’s earnings during his term

‘of service with his employer.‘

The convention's wage and contract
committee gave hearty endorsation to
the officers’ report on this subject,

' which stated: “This convention is now

serving notice to Hon. C. D. Howe and
the employers, that this Union has no
intention of following their advice,
which is that workers should not seek
wage increases today. Our programme
to meet the developing crisis calls for
‘Substantial wage increases and shorter
hours,’ as important measures which
would increase purchasing power in
Canada and provide jobs for our mem-
bers. '

“We say here that in bargaining in
1954 we will seek wage increases. We
will continue to fight for the estab-
lishment in all our agreements of the
40.hour, 5 day week, Monday through

Friday, with punitive pay for S_atur- K

day and Sunday work.
“We will also take up asﬁa major

L bargaining issue the question of ade-

quate pensions. This is an issue which
has been brought to the fore by a
Conciliation Board award arising out
of the negotiations with ‘the Consoli-
dated Mining and Smelting Company.
This award, which was accepted by the
company and the Union, ruled, that
pensions are a matter for collective
bargaining, ‘establishing this ‘for the
first time. ’ « _

“These companies have never recog-

nized vested rights in the pension
' plan. We shall in this year’s bargain-
; ing enlist the support of our Union’ in

the fight to establish the principle. of

I vested rights. "We shall also demand

that pensions be based on the best 10
years’ earnings rather than the last

‘ 10 years.

“We shall in addition aim to estab-

, lish the right of our members to retire
-* voluntarily at the age of 60, with a

pension equal to what they would re-
ceive at 65. This is important in our
fight for jobs. We cannot agree that

_ older workers should be compelled to

work until 65 in order to protect their
pension rights, while young men are
out of work.

“As another measure to help relieve

President John Clark following his unanimous election by Canadian Mine-Mill Conven-

 
 

IPORT COLBORNE--Unanimity on
the part of the more than 100 dele-
gates to the Sixth Annual Convention
of the Canadian section of Mine-Mill
onstheir choice of leaders for the Cana-
dian membership resulted in acclama-
tions for the office of Canadian vice-
president of the International Union,
and for the eleven positions on the

0 Canadian Mine-Mill Council. A ’

Since nominations for any of these
offices could have been made by letter
from any member of the union i in
Canada, the unanimity of the delegates
to the convention represented the una-
nimity of the entire Canadian member-
ship in their choice of Canadian leaders.

NELSA THIBAULT, formerly pres-
ident of Sudbury Local 598, and Exec-
utive Board Member for District 8,‘ was
the unanimous choice for; Canadian
vice-president of the International
Union. » K 

Canadian Mine-Mill Councilmembers
elected by acclamation were: L. Mess-

A’ iion to be the Union’: first Canadian Vice-President. Seestory below.

A referendum. vote’ was required to
elect two candidates for an exchange

France. Those nominated from the
‘west were Al King of Trail, B. C.;

George Anderson of Copper Mountain,

 and Rod Black of Bralorne, B..C. Nom-
-« inated from the ‘east were: —M.' Kopinak
" and E; Houde of Port Colborne, and M.

Solski of Sudbury. The referendum
vote by Mine-Mill members in Canada
has been held in the Wet; Al King
appeared to be -elected on the basis of
nearly complete returns. Voting in the

members of Parliament to protest
against that anti-labor piece of legisla-

 tion. The Convention decided that simi-

lar action would be undertaken by other
locals throughout Canada.

Bills 19 and 20, already passed by
the provincial Legislature of Quebec
was described as being “worse than the
Butler Bill.” One delegate warned that
“if we don’t fight back, we will end up
in the same situation as the people’un-
der Hitler or as the Negro people in the
South of the _U. S.”

The Convention fully endorsed the
portion of the report dealing with those
bills and which read in part: "‘We salute
the Unions in Quebec who took up the
fight against these infamous bills and
pledge to them our full support in con-
tinuing their fight.”

THE NEED for a Bill of Rights that

would guarantee the basic freedoms to
the Canadian people was strongly
emphasized by the Convention.

The political and legislative program
of the Canadian Mine-Mill Council also
includes such demands as a national
health ‘plan; a housing program; great-

-ersubsidies to the depressed gold in-

dustry; increased old age pensions and

other social benefits; public works on

a large scale; better compensation laws
and the right for trade union officials
and members to freely cross the border.

Much attention was devoted to unem-

- ployment insurance, in view of the fact

that the number of unemployed work-
ers is increasing daily. The~Cpuncil is
asking increased benefits up to 65%
of earnings and for the complete elimi-
nation of the present waiting periods.

THE CONVENTION also reaffirmed

' the long standing policy of Mine-Mill
on the question of lowering the income '

tax for working people. The Union is

' asking a $2,000 basic exemption, plus

$2,000 for married men. The exemption
should be of $400 for a child eligible
to family allowances and of $800 for 9.
child who is not eligible.

The political action committees will 0

have the job to fight for that program,
and will support those who will agree
to implement it. The delegates felt that
it was a very important part of the
general policies of Mine-Mill’, aiming at

. full employment and a higher standard
_ of living for the workers.

In In a_ conference with the labor

 board, the parties agreed to the ar-

rangements for the NLRB election to
determine, in a single unitsfor Butte
miners and Anaconda.smeltermen, the
bargaining representative. A Voting will
"take »’five days. Polls will be openin

_ ballots will be counted. until all are cast.

2. The federal court’ here granted the
NLRB a temporary injunction barring
the holding of an election for Butte
miners by District Judge John'B. Mc-
Clernan whom the Steel raiders had
attacked by innuendo as a “Communist
agent.” Previously, Joe Mason had re-
signed from the court-appointed board
that was to hold the election, a vote
that was authorized when Judge Me-
Clernan -upheld Mine-Mill’s possession
of Miners Union‘Hall. ‘The Steel raid-
ers had tried every possible way to

‘ block the Court vote since itlwould ex-

pose their complete lack of organiza-
tion in Butte.

117 ‘of Mine-Mill have become two of

the most active local unions. in the

‘country. Their mission is a new deal

for Butte miners and Anaconda “smel-

termen, _and thenew deal unfolds in
many ways. V

Both locals have brought Mine-Mill
democracy to the grievance setup, end-
ing the one-man system thatlexisted
for years under the Masons and the
McLeans. Stewards now accompany
the business agent in Anaconda‘ to
meetings with company‘ officials. A
large grievance contact committee ac,-.
companies the local president in.Butte.

Some major grievances are ‘being
tackled——and progress made. Perhaps
the most dramatic and far—reaching is
the problem of dust at the Kelley mine,
ahuge black caving operation for the
most part. Thexunion has moved in on
this _evil in a big way and has won some

initial concessions from the Anaconda

company. . i
Safety is’ another big. issue here. The
long-neglected fight against dangerous
working conditions has opened with a
bang under Mine-Mill’s leadership.
Martin Johnson, mining in the Lex-
ington shaft, was killed recently. Im-

' mediately, Glen Zorn, Local 1 president,

went down the shaft to investigate the ,
"fatal accident, something unheard of

under the Masons.

Appearing at the inqhest, into John- .

son’s death, Zorn testified that had the
place been timbered, the accident would
not have occurred. Board Member
Ernest Salvas testified on the unsafe
conditions of the ground. The ooroner’s
jury blamed the dead man for his own

‘death, a pattern that has existed for

many years. I p
The important thing, however, is the

. fact that the union is fighting——and, the

workers are responding. Similar long-
neglected grievances are being pro-

-cessed by Mine-Mill at the Anaconda
. smelter.

_Other‘phasesA of the new deal are the

increased democratic management of '

the local unions. In both places, Butte
and Anaconda, the local exeoutive

.boards are being expanded into large,

democratic bodies that will make im-
possible the kind of clique control that
existed under the Masons. and Bubs
McLean. A

The Steward system at Anaconda_

and the Mine Grievance Committees at
Butte are revitalized and‘ functioning
at top efficiency and speed. Commit.

‘tee meetings have larger attendances

now than local union meetings used to
have when the old Mason ‘and McLean
gangs were in office.

‘A -5i Its red smear campaign failing and

finding little= response, the steel union

;

' has settled down into -a day,-by-day,»

slapped together a so-called “bargain-
ing” program and rushed it‘ into print
during the deliberations
Union Hall of the Mine-Mill Anaconda
Council. One enterprising minér “ fig-
ured out that the Steel program, in

cash_terms, wouldlmean an increase of‘ .

$2.25 per hour, or $90 per week.
In contrast, -Mine-Mill’s program has

‘electrified the miners and smeltermen
and the “two hills,” Butte and Ana-

conda, are eagerly awaiting the open-
ing of collective bargaining without the
Mason-McLean sellouts to hamstring
contract talks. .

21 Jim Hartzell, in Mine-Mills’ ranks '

when the. campaign opened, Steel
brought him out into the open last
week. Hartzell had been offering Steel

bribes to "Mine-Mill supporters and-
finding no takers. Thus exposed, he ..
. begged for an opportunity to apologize

to the miners “for his mistake.’’ .

Given the floor!’ at. a Butte meeting,
Hartzell d e c e i t f u ll y red-baited the
union, claiming that the ACM Council
program amounted only to “Communist
demands for trade with Red China.” He

had brought eight stooges with him to‘ V
the meeting." He closed’ his tirade with V’ .. e

an appeal for a walkout from the meet-
ing. The‘ eight stooges went with him,
including his brother, _a ranch hand, a

filling station operator, and two bar-

tenders. /The 300 miners in the hall
booed them out.‘ None went with Hart-
zell. Since then, Steel has had two
sparsely attended ‘meetings, one in
Anaconda and the other in Butte. V ‘

came into being with a brave announce-
ment that “200 miners”, had met at an
address on Arizona street and launched
a new union. Mine-Mill took a picture
of the building at the address given,
checked the neighborhood and found
out that the address was a private

. home. The “independent” tried to get

on the ballot, but was ruled off by the

way a speaker put it at a committee

Company for more than 20 times from
’_ August to November, 1952, but the

on any of our proposals. .
Finally, on November 12, 1952, the‘

‘No wage increase. Elimination of the

IF WE ARE. TO BUILD the kind of home
market we need, .We’ll have to give more

~ thought to people. ‘When we talk about people,

we’re talking chiefly about workers and farm-

. ers. Together with their families they make

up more than 70 per cent of our population.

, We want to build a home market that will
last. We want it to have a-good solid founda-
tion. That means getting more money-~—more

buying poWer——into the hands of workers and

‘down. Encourage business, they say—give .

farmers. They spend their money on useful
goods and services. Their increased purchases

will supply the kind of market now needed to ‘

absorb increased output and to stimulate in-
vestment. ' , - ' . ‘
Mine-Mill’s approach —- aimed at boosting
the economy from the bottom up—-isjust the
opposite of the -“trickle-down theory” of the
Eisenhower administration. The “trickle-
downers” approach the problem from the top

them more profits, cut. their taxes, give them
a freer hand with labor, and eventually the
increased benefits _to business will '*"‘trickle
down” to the masses of people. ’ -

The “trickle-downers” had their day in the

1920’s. They brought on the Great Depression.

of the ’30’s. Only when their policies were
junked.did we pull out of the depths of that
economic crisis. a. .

PORT COLBORNE—Fresh from the
Butte “battleground” where the Butte
and Anaconda miners and smeltermen
are battling‘ off a Steel raid, Interna-

tional President John Clark brought,

welcome news of Mine-Mill’s increas-

ing‘ strength in that area when he ad-
dressed the Sixth Annual Canadian

Cgnvention. .

Condemning Mason’s betrayal of the
Montana "miners and smeltermen as
the “most despicable thing that hap-
pened in, the labor movement,” Presi-
dent Clark declared that the secession-
ists and the raiders “will never break
_our International Union.” A '

,Unlike theyears under the Mason
machine domination when the miners
were discouraged from attending meet-
ings ‘and participating in the union

affairs, now, President Clark reported, .

Mine-Mill meetings are overcrowded

with hundreds attending and partici- -

pating 1 actively.
VPresident Clark dealt also with the

Mine-Mill program to stabilize the.

economy of the country and to advance
the welfare of the people. He pointed
out that while employers were accus-
ing the workers of creating the crisis
through higher wages the employers
themselves were exporting money to
other countries where by the use of
cheap labor they were producing com-

modities to compete with those pro- ,

duced by higher paid labor.

The first point in the Union's pro- V

gram was to assure jobs in our own

’ industry. Hestressed that progress in,

the Mine-Mill program could have been
much further advanced were it not for
the raids and attacks on the union.

Referring to the increasing attacks V

by reaction against the entire labor
movement, President Clark stressed
the urgency of building united action
with all labor as the only safeguard
against reaction.

PORT COLBORNE-“Let there be 1

no doubt about Montana—we are go-

ing to win because we have the wol;k- _

ers of ‘Montana with us. The slogan
there is we are bringing the union
\back to the miners and smeltermen

whereit belongs.” 1
With these words Vic_e-President Or-

ville Larson opened his talk to the Ca-
nadian Convention.

: Outlining the political developments
in the United States, the Vice-Presi-
dent admitted that many people were
concerned but, he stressed, “there is an
inborn love of freedom in the. hearts
of_theA‘people of America and fascism
will never come to America.” The

democratic feelings of the people is .

sound, he said, and the people are be-

- ginning to speak out. Sooner or later‘

the common sense of the people will
be heard and the advance of reaction
will be halted. The basic common
sense of the U. "S. will prevail, Larson
assured his Canadian audience.

Outlining the developments in the
Clinton Jencks case, Larson said there

_was. much confidence that the higher‘
courts will reverse the decision of the .

lower court which convicted J encks and

sentenced him to five years imprison-A ,

ment.‘ The International Vice-President
praised _the Canadian members of
Mine-Mill for the generous support

' the distress of unemployment, we are. _

proposing that provisions for sever- A -

ance pay’ be. written in agreements,
thus guaranteeing workers that in case

of layoffs, dismissal or whether they.

leave a job, they will receive severance
pay which will be cumulative, based
on length ofservice. “

“In addition to the points stressed
above, we wish to emphasize that the

 bargaining programme adopted at the
' Calgary Convention (1953),-particulah

ly the plan for the division and rota-

tion of work to provide job security,‘

still stands as our objective. -

“We. are approaching bargaining ‘

fully‘ aware of the difficulties ahead,
but at the ‘same time confident that
through unity‘ we shall win gains. The

aims of the employer to intimidate our  L

members and to weaken their resolve
to fight for better _ living standards

‘ while industry seeks to protect ‘and’

expand their maximum profits, will be ‘

defeated.” -

PORT, COLBORNE4Une centaine de

. ‘délégués de l’Union Mine-Mill se sont

a"

préunis le premier mars, .a Port-Col-
‘borne, pour assister a la convention
ainnuelle-‘ ,du Conseil Canadien. Cette
convention avait une importance ‘A his-
torique, car depuisl le dernier référen-

. dum de l’Union Internationale, le Con-
seil Canadien de Mine-Mill a le_ pou-

_ voir de prendre toutes les décisions

, concernant le bien-etre des membres
au Canada.

Autrement dit,’.c’est le Conseil Ca‘-I

nadien de Mine-Mill qui prend toutes
les décisions touchant l’organisation et

'='«*-*2- lladministration de l’Union au Canada.

Cette indépendance fut offerte par
l’Union Internationale, et approuvée
par la majorité des membres Cana-
diens et Americains. Deplus, l’Union
Internationale a reconnu l’importance
de la section canadienne en approuvant
la nomination d’un vice-président ca-
nadien. \

Les délégués a la convention ont ac-

cepté a l’unanimité le choix de Nels
Thibault‘ comme vice-président inter-
national pour représenter la section
canadienne.

Le choix des onze membres du Con-
seil Canadien fut également unanime.
Voici 1eurs- noms: pour le district no. 7
représentant l’ouest du’ pays: Harvey
Murphy, Al. King, Jack -Tees et Ken
Smith; pour_le district no 1, repré-
sentant le centre du pays: Larry Mess-
mer, Robert Michel et William Long-
ridge; pour le district no 8, représen-
tant 1’est du pays: Mike Kopinak, Mike

Solski, Ray Stevenson et Einer John- .

son. Le seul nouveau membre du Con-
seil est Einer Johnson, représentant le
local 902 de Sudbury. ’

PENDANT les quatre jours de la
convention, les délégués ont discuté et
adopté le rapport du Conseil présenté
par le secrétaire M. Solski de Sudbury.
Ce rapport touchait aux questions sui-
vantes: le_l fonctionnement du Conseil
Canadien de Mine-Mill; le programme
de négociations; le travail d’organisa-

de Timmins; le programme de l’Union

ltion; les raids contre l’Union; la greve,

pour lutter contre le chomage; la ques-'

tion ude l’un'ité _,ouvriere; le commerce
et la paix; les droits démocratiques du
mouvement ouvrier, Ie, programme d’-
éducation et le vice-président canadien.

s’il le désire, au lieu de 65 ans. Le

Une autre partie du rapport analy-
_sait la situation éconolnique et le role
de l’Union dans la lutte contre la dé-
pregsion. ' 

Les délégués,

partagés en com-

___'_ités, ont étudié les ‘llifféreﬁtes parties

du rapport_et les résolutions soumises
par les locaux de Mine-Mill in Canada.
Il va sans dire que la principale ques-
tion était celle des négociations.

Les délégués ont‘ insisté sur I" la

UNE, AUTRE QUESTION qui a’

, intérets de ses membres.

  

L celle de la paye a la fin de 1’embauch-

a le droit de- recevoir un certain'nom-
bre de semaines de paye quand il
quitte 1’industrie. Le montant devrait
etre ‘égal a cinq pour cent du revenu
de l‘employé,

en tenant compte de la_

Enfin, le Conseil estime. que l’Union .

devrait demander une augmentation de'

15, cents V l’heur'e au cours, des pro.
chaines négociations. Cela fait partie
‘du programme pour maintenir le pou-

~ voir d’achat, et pour lutter contre le

chomage. L’Union affirme, en effet,
que le chomage va augmenter si les

t_ravailleurs' n’ont pas suffisament d’.-’

argent pour acheter une bonne partie

d—e:=la- production des industries cana-

diennes. Une autre mesure pour lutter

' contrela crise qui se développe serait

d’exporter le surplus de nos produits
aux autres pays" quit‘ désirent faire
commerce avec nous sur une base
d’ég-alité. S ‘ .

La question du plan médical a égale-

‘ ment soulevé beaugoup de commen-

taires ‘de la part des’délégués. La lutte
pour_l’amélioration des plans médicaux
fera partie du programme des pro-
chaines négociations de‘ Mine-Mill’ a
travers tout le Canada.

 *:ajn.d ;go1d.minins «industries» and:
the resultant unemployment;

The "delegates who ‘had been

7”‘ attending the Sixth Annual" Can-
' adian Mine-Mill Convention at

‘Port Colborne left for Ottawa
immediately following the con-
clusion of their Convention.

.0 The eleven-member Canadian Mine-

‘ Mill Council, headed by Council Presi-
dent K. A. Smith of -Vancouver and

Council Secretary M. Solski of Sudbury,
met with a committee of the Cabinet,
where the union’s proposals adopted at
the Convention for- remedial action to
allay the metals crisis and provide jobs
for the membership were listened to
attentively by the Cabinet ministers.
Accompanying the Canadian Council
were the newly elected Canadian Vice-
President, Nels Thibault, and Canadian
Research Director Lukin Robinson.

IN ADDITION, the Mine-Mill’ dele-
gation lobbied 27 members of Parlia-

‘ment throughout the day. The delegates J

reported that with oneexception, they
were received cordially and that the

. Union’s‘proposals were well received by _

the legislators, who in many cases ex-
pressed support for all or part of the
Mine-Mill program.

The Canadian Council in their meet-
ing with the Cabinet members pointed
out that while they had warned the
Government a year ago of the crisis de-
veloping in the base .metals industry

and had proposed at that time specific .

measures to meet this crisis, the crisis
had become much worse and a general
economic depression threatened.

The Union's presentation estimated
that there would be 700,000 unemployed
by‘ the middle of March. It was further

- pointed out that in the base metals in-

dustry there were 22 mines closed down

with 3,000 members of the Mine-Mill S

Union unemployed.

- 9.

”- This was one of the points taken up

~ with the B. C. Cabinet when the Dis-
. , trict officers ,met them on February

_ tickets, and come and go freely. Con- .

12, and at that time the Attorney—Gen-

eral advised the delegation that no law ‘
~ permitted the CPR to refuse a ticket

'_'sale, and that. a legal process should
be opened. ' .
ORGANIZERS and- officials, of the
AFL, brass of which signed contracts
in the States before there was a man
on the job, have no difficulty buying

ditions at Kitimat are a true reflection
of the usual condition under such meth-
ods of “organizing,” and men are en-

tering andlquitting the town ‘about as

. fast as the AFL organizers.

Mine-Mill’s ‘endeavor is to see that
Kitimat does not become a company

town in spite of its incorporation, an, ,

f A objective that Alco has very definitely

 

 

in mind.

VANCOUVER,‘ B. C.—Briti'sh oe-
lumbia District Union, IUMMSW, has
forced the Canadian Pacific Steamships

 into recanting its refusal to sell tickets

to Kitirnat, seat of the new Aluminum
Company of Canada plant, unless de-
mand was accompanied by a written
authorization from the company.

Action was taken by the union

. through its lawyers when Ken Smith

and others of the District executive
had been refused transportation to

‘ Kitimat, which is not a company town

THE DELEGATION emphasized the 1

' need for immediate action. by the Gov-

 is

ernment on whose_ shoulders the re-

' sponsibility for _the crisis rested.

The Union’s presentation urged that.
immediate steps be taken to give re-e
-lief to those workers who‘ are unem-

ployed or threatened with unemploy-
ment, by the increase of unemployment
insurance to 65% of earnings, the re-
moval of time limits on unemployment
insurance and the reduction of the tax
burden of incomes below $5,000.

- The delegation called for the broad-

ening of export markets and the open-

ing up of unhampered trade with ‘all

countries of -the world willing and able’

to buy Canadian base metals. _
THEY FURTHER stated opposition
to ' any increased tariffs which might

- be imposed against our exports of base

metals and recommended that should
any country impose such increases, the
Canadian Government should retaliate
by placing a tax or an embargo on the
export of nickel, asbestos and other
vital raw materials.

Union breaks raluminumr
curfam, around Kirimat 

but an -incorporated municipality, be-

cause Alco had not authorized the

visits; . ‘ ~
Counsel'“‘for the CPR, replying to

‘the "Union demand that such bans

should cease, stated that tickets would
be available whenever wanted iwithout
reference to thecompany. ,
UNION STEAMSHIPS, also a party
to the complaint, has not yet replied
to the demand sent by Stanton, Munro,
andoDean, District Union lawyers. The
are a subsidiary of the CPR.

,- »

«ment assistance plan for the base

metals mining industry based on the
cost of production of each operation
which would guarantee full production

and employment at adequate wages and.

fair workingnconditions.

The Union also proposed the building
by the Government of a lead-zinc cus-
tom smelter in western Canada to al-
low the small mines to produce without
dependence on the smelter at Trail. _

The Union also proposed that Cana-
dian consumption of base metals should
be increased by the commencement im-
mediately of such large scale national

. (projects as the St. Lawrence Seaway
’ and Power Development, the All-Cana-

dian Gas Pipeline, the South Saskatch-

i : ewan Power and Irrigation Project, the

building of 150,000 low cost homes an-
nually‘ and other major public works.
THE UNION’S‘ presentation was
highlighted by new proposals to revive
and restore Canada's gold mining in-
dustry. The Union delegation called
upon the Government -«to triple- the
amount now paid in assistance to, the
gold mining industry in order that the
production of gold be greatly increased
and that this increased production of

 ;-’g__o,ld be used to pay off the large and
' , “growing trade deficit we have with the

United States. — --

, It was pointed out that this deficit 
“has been made up largely by United

‘States capital buying up our natural

cut in cofiriracr rare

BRALORNE, B. C.—-This gold camp
is plenty sore, and Recording Secretary '
~ Jack Morton of Local 271 states that
at a recent special meeting it “was a
pleasure to see so many mad muckers
and miners spoiling for a fight, and
banding together to ask the union to
lead their attack.” ‘Reason? Bralorne
has slashed contract rates, cut off the _
powder subsidy, and eliminated con-
tracts for trammers. ‘ '

A The camp has never hadea contract ,
committee, but one is now being
formed, and the_ company will be called
on to recognize it and to set contracts
on the old basis.

Failing this, Brother Morton, speak-
ing for the ‘committee, .\ recommends
“that all contractors should refrain.
from busting their fannies for a few
extr_a‘bucks,, and work for day wages

only.” , ~
