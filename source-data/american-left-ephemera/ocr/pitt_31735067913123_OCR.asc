OK's Federal

Mine Safety Bill Following May Hearings

Action by Full Committee
Expected Early in June

WASHINGTON, D.C. —- A nine-man House Select‘
Subcommittee on Labor last month favorably reported
the Johnson administration’s federal ' mine safety ‘bill,
following a week of testimony from govermental agencies,
-labor muons, industry representatives, and state mine
inspectors. Seven Congressmen from important mining
states offered testimony in support of such legislation,
while Governors Sam, Goddard of Arizona and Calvin
Rampton of Utah sent wires urging favorable action by
the subcommittee.

The full Education and Labor Committee, headed by
Rep. Adam C. Powell (D-N.Y.)',' is expected to act on the
measure shortly, perhaps on June 10. It is this 31-member
group that will debate amendments to the bill, which

Skinner Callsfor 14(b) Repeal
, May26atWashngton  earing

WASHINGTON, D.C.——Mine-Mill International President A. C. Skinner testified
on May 26 before a Special House Labor Subcommittee, urging repeal of Section 14(b)
of the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows states to outlaw the union shop. '

Although President Johnson h
_ for repeal, as pledged in the Democ

not expected to be an easy one.
The repeal proposal, said Skinner in his testimony, “

emotional and controversial piece of domestic legislation

people, including many re-

porters, packed the - room. for_
the hearings on the repeal" issue‘

—-the number one goal of or-
ganized labor in 1965.

In his message, President John-
son also called for the extension
of minimum wage coverage to an

‘ additional 4.5 million workers,

but did not recommend an in-
crease in the present federal
minimum of,$1.25 an hour, an-

 other goal of labor leaders. Rep.

Roman Pucinski (VD-Ill. ), a_ mem-

ad earlier, in a May 18 message to Congress, asked

promises tobecome the most

before this session of Con-

on May 24, declaring that unions
and ’ 'm_an,agement, rather. than

V the states, should decide the

union shop issue, which, he
maintained, “has cluttered up
the political processes in almost
every state in the union, and
will continue to do so as long
as federal law invites it.”
Religious Groups Testify
Also appearing on behalf of

repeal during the hearings were
spokesmen for the National
Council of Churches, the Nation-
al Catholic Welfare Conference,
and the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations. A state-
ment submitted on behalf of
Clarence Mitchell, director of
the Washington bureau of the
NAACP, said,‘ “We know after

would cover mines and mills in
the metals and minerals mining
industry.

In its present form, the bill
would authorize the Interior
Department to make inspections
of safety conditions at such

- properties and give the depart-

ment enforcement power to cor-
rect specific types of violations
to a uniform safety code that

would be established. The labor

testimony before the committee
and that "of Cong. David S.
King (D-Utah) had recommend-
ed several amendments to
strengthen the measure, pri-
marily by extending its cover-
age to smelters and refineries

President Kennedy in Au-
gust of 1963 expressed to me
his personal concern over
lost-time injuries, not only in
coal mines but in all mines.
It was his belief that a coun-
try which had our wealth
and scientific resources could
develop whatever safety de-
vices and procedures were
required to enable us to ex-
tract the mineral resources
.we need without excessive
loss of human’ life. President
Johnson has expressed a
similar concern for the health
and welfare of employees.
Federal legislation is the
only feasible, effective an-
swer to the need to lower
this avoidable loss of life and
injury. . .
Where, there are conflicts
between production and hu-
man life, there can be no
doubt that human life comes
first.

Mt. Vernon Workers OK  

New Two -Year C onfracf

BEDFORD, N.Y.—A two—year contract settlement, reached on
May 4 between Mine-Mill Local 701 and the Mt. Vernon Die-Cast-
ing Company in Stamford, Conn., provides- 10 cents an hour in
general wage increases over that period plus a two percent raise

in piece work earnings.

Covering the some 260 members of the New York Amalgamated
Local, the new contract adds an additional yearly holiday, making
a total of 11, and substantially improves the vacation plan. A

About 200 members of Local 701 unanimously ratified the agree-
ment at a special meeting on May 5. The contract is retroactive to

May 1.

The increase in piece work earnings amounts to more than

five cents per hour. Five cents an hour more is provided with the

across-the-board wage hike in
the first year, with another five
cents per hour coming in the
second year of the contract.

The positions of die-maker
and tool-maker were reclassi-
fied and upgraded by an addi-
tional 10 cents per hour.‘

Employees will, in the future,
receive a full day off before
Christmas and New Years,
rather than the half day they
had been getting. All restrictions
were removed for qualifying for
holiday pay.

Vacation Improvements

The improved Vacation sched- ’

ule provides one week of vaca-
tion after one year of service;
two weeks after four years;
three weeks after 15 years; and

four weeks after 25 years. After‘

two years, a worker will receive
one week and 13 hours of vaca-
tion; after three years, one week

and 26 hours. An additional day.

of vacation (above two weeks)
will be given for each year of

service between 11 and 15, while
an additional day (above three
weeks) will be received every

other year between 17 and 25'

years of service.

In addition, the company ac-
cepted a union plan which will
guarantee every employee not
less than three days off as a
bereavement period. S a f e t y
glasses, to be purchased by any
new employees, will be reim-
bursed by the company after a
90-day probationary period in
the shop. f

Mike DiAntonio, president of
Local ‘701, and Tony Battiste,
the chief steward, served on
the negotiating committee, along
with Charles Crawford, Sam
Longo, Mike Fiorto, Paul Web-
ster, and Arthur Odell. Board
Member Alfred Petit-Clair’ and

CLIFTON, Ariz.—A Neighbor-

will provide jobs for some 45
young people from low-income
families in this c ounty, re-
ceived a $33,000 grant from the
federal government late in May.

Part of the War on Poverty,

' _it is the first proposal of the

Greenlee County Community

is under consideration—one ask-
ing for a $13,000 grant to con-
duct a study of the mental
health facilities, day care cen-
ters, study‘ halls, remedial read-
ing, and adult education facili-
ties, recreational and other pro-

IWITH 7,519 SIGNED APPLICATION CA

TORONTO, Ontario——A formal hearing before the Ontario Labor Relations Board on Mine-Mill’s application
for certification at International Nickel Company’s mines and plants at Sudbury will be held on June 15. At that

time, an election date will be set, probably to take place within the next two months.

Mine-Mill's application for bargaining rights at the giant Inco works was filed by Local 598 on Tuesday, May
11—the first day it was possible to file. Under Ontario law, 22 months of a two or more_year contract must expire

before an application can be
submitted. The present agree-
ment between Inco and the
Steelworkers runs for three
years, expiring in July, 1966.

Accompanying the Local 598
petition were 7,519 signed appli-
cation cards and affidavits of
membership in the local. This
figure is 51% of the 14,700 Inco
workers.

Additional cards, bringing the
total to 7,831, were signed prior
to the final filing deadline on
May 25. At the same time, the

RAYMOND =C’U‘ADB-AS. a

for Local 937 in San Manuel,
Ariz., makes his monthly re-

ing.

X-ray Provided for
Local 482 Members

NEWARK, N. J .-On April
28, almost 100 percent of the
members of Mine-Mill Local 482
and their f a milie s received

chest X-rays at a mobile unit

at the Barth Smelting and Re-
fining Company, which paid for
the routine test. The X-rays
will be viewed only by the em-
ployees and their personal doc-
tors. -

The company also will pro-
vide free flu shots in the fall
of thisjyear, and probably will
continue the chest film service
in the future.

This program was worked out
with the company by the local
union, represented by President
Richard Weeks and Ruben
Bloksberg, chairman of the
health and welfare committee.

company has been hiring addi-
tional workers, boosting that to-
tal to 15,004. Thus, Local 598 had
signed 52% of the total work
force by the deadline.

$1 For Each Card
Ontario law requires at least
45% of the eligible voters in the
bargaining unit to have signed
cards and to have paid a one
dollar initiation fee before it will
order an election.
. “This application,” said Local

"598 President Nels Thibault, who

headed an eight-man delegation
which filed the petition with the
Labor Board, “climaxes almost
a full year of voluntary organi-
zation by hundreds of our mem-
bers.” “They wish,” he said, “to
remove the cloud of suspicion
still hanging over the 1962 vote
at lnco,” a vote won by Steel
with a margin of 15. At that
time, there was considerable
court battling over the validity
of the votes and the procedures
used in the election.

Hundreds of workers from
Inco and Falconbridge accom-
panied the Mine-Mill delegation
to thetrain station on May 11,

marching from the union hall
through the center of the city.

‘I965 Bargaining

Pointing to the huge gains
made by Cominco workers in
last year's bargaining, Mine-Mill
is campaigning for unity in bar-
gaining in 1965, at a time of un-
paralleled company profits. Steel
cannot bargain with Inco again
until next year. According to
Thibault, the Steel raid has
robbed nickel workers of at least
$12 per week since 1962.

With a majority of Inco work-
ers having already signed Mine-
Mill cards, The Sudbury Star of
May 21 reported that “An upset
in the presidency of Local 6500,
United Steelworkers of America,
is an imminent possibility.” The
newspaper said that, although
evidence of dissatisfaction and
charges of “dishonesty” and
“misappropriation of fund s”
against Local 6500 President Don
M c N a b b w e r e “successfully
turned aside” at a membership
meeting on May 19, another un-
ion meeting on the following day
voted “non-confidence” in Mc-
Nabb.

National Mine - Mill President
Ken Smith struck at the center

of the leadership crisis in Steel
when he said that the Mine-Mill
application “is a giant stride for-
ward in the battle to once and
for all bring to an end the can-
cer of raiding in the Canadian
trade union movement.” “We
know,” he said,‘ “it will be
greeted with enthusiasm by ev-
ery honest trade unionist in the
country.”

Win at Nigadoo

On May 12, meanwhile, Mine-A

Mill Local 1043 won a 5 to 1 vic-
tory at the Nigadoo mine near
Bathurst, New Brunswick, a
property that is expected to em-
ploy some 250 men when ready
for production. Although Mine-
Mill was the only union on the
ballot, the Steelworkers cam-
paigned vigorously for a “no”
vote. -

“The men at Nigadoo,” said
Mine-Mill Board Member Wil-
liam Kennedy, “have joined
hands with the workers at
Wedge mine, where we estab-
lished the highest rates of pay
plus other benefits in the metal
mining industry in the Maritime
provinces. They have decisively

Arbitrator Thomas H. Tongue, in a decision dated May 12,
ruled that the company had violated the contract in refusing to pay
the new rate to those men who had not worked on the holiday.

Only the few maintenance employees who had worked on Jan.

paid at the increased wage
0 rates. AS&R rested its refusal to

.pay those rates to the em-

ployees who had the day off on
a contract provision which
stated, “An employee eligible
(for holiday pay) . .
ceive one shift’s pay at his job
classification, straight time

worked ;by him immediately
prior to such holiday.”

iLew Cochran, who represented
the‘ union at a March 12 hear-

ring, pointed out that in the”

_past"workers who were sick or

“company; contended that these

payments were made by the
payroll clerk by mistake and
without consulting management.

Tongue, in his opinion, said

-that the wage increase was in-

tended to become effective for
all employees on Jan. 1, and
that workers entitled to holiday
pay for that day were entitled
to be paid at the higher rate.

‘ Although the award gave only
56 cents to each of the workers

lished an important principle

The Hotel Union Trades Council runs

finally won the approval of the New York

program is to help union members with
problems before they require court action,
and to refe-r them to city agencies or
other sources for assistance. The four neighborhood councils deal
only with housing, garnishment, consumer fraud, and income tax
matters. All other questions are referred to the Legal Aid Society
or other sources of legal help. .

Each clinic has a paid director——a member of the union who

 

' Stcngel

has developed a knowledge of the rules and regulations that most‘
- often affect the poor of the predominantly Negro and Puerto Rican

communities where the councils are set up. The cases typically
dealt with are evictions, rent overcharges, landlord failure to
make needed repairs, assistance in income tax problems.

The New York Times reports that some 3,000 persons come to
the neighborhood councils for help each year.

negotiations with the company.

on vacation improvements, has f_

rejected attempts to split its
unity. Meeting on May 16, the
council decided that it could not
accept any deal which excluded
Local 501 in El Paso, Texas.

The council is attempting to

bring the vacation program into 5‘ A

line with those of the unions
which accepted a slightly better
vacation setup instead of Mine-

Mill’s security-severance plan;

It is.asking that four weeks of

vacation for 20 years of service , =

begin this year and that three
weeks of vacation after 10 years
take effect in 1966. ‘

PD has offered the vacation
improvements at its ‘Arizona

‘operations in exchange for the

clarification of certain points

arising. out of "last year’s negoti- \ A
ations, but at El Paso has con- ~

ditioned the offer on union
agreement that SUB will not be
payable if work is unavailable
because of a strike anywhere in
the properties supplying copper

to the refinery. These opera-’

tions now include, the Copper
Queen, Miorenci, and Ajo
branches of PD, plus the ‘San

Manuel and Superior properties ,  

of Magma Copper.

The council decided that it
could not agree to make El
Paso workers responsible for
activities at other properties.

On May 18, PD officials were

informed that the union would
_ not trade away the unity of its 1

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Job Bias Ban to Take Effect on July 2 55 to 82 Cents

On J uly.2, the equal employment opportunities section of last year’s Civil Rights Act goes into effect—-the part

2 of the law which forbids employers, employment agencies

color, religion, sex, or national origin.

The act makes unlawful not only discrimination in hiring, but discrimination in u
layoff, discharge, selection for special training, pay rates, and conditions of work.
Mine-Mill over the years has been a leader in the fi

bers of all minority groups.
Most of the union’s contracts
c o n t a in anti - discrimination
clauses. Now, for the first time,
there is a federal law to aid in
this struggle.

Reaffirming the union’s tradi-
tional policy of non-discrimina-
tion, the international executive
board, at a meeting late in April,
also discussed means of encour-
aging and helping companies to
voluntarily comply with the new
law when it takes effect next
month. A survey is now being
completed as to what companies
are in compliance, and as to
what the major problems are at
the other properties. The Mine-
Mill national staff, which met
in Denver at the end of last
month, was reminded that the
area of equal opportunity on the
job is an essential part of their
work. .

Pledging the union’s continued
cooperation with civil rights or-

ganizations in community ac-,

tion, the board also said that the
help of such groups should be
sought in providing qualified
minority group applicants for
' jobs in the mining, smelting, and
refining industry. In pl aces
where minority group members
are employed, the board de-
a clared, special attention must be
paid to their conditions of em-
ployment to*guard against dis-
crimination.
Provisions of the Civil Rights
. Act of 1964, passed after 83 days
, of filibuster in the U.S. Senate,
had been proposed the previous
year by the late John F. Ken-
nedy. On June 11, 1963, Presi-

dent Kennedy delivered in a.

television speech a strong ap-

J’! peal to the nation’s citizens to

recognize the problem of racial
injustice “which faces us all——
m every city of the North as
well as the South.”

What is the Equal Employ-

, ment Opportunity Act which will
takeeffect next month? How is
it to be applied?

Following are some of the
common questions asked about
the law, and their answers: A

Q—What employers and un-
ions are affected?

A—In the first year, the law
applies only to companies and
unions with 100 or more workers
and members. Next year, the
minimum will be reduced to 75;
in 1967 to 50; and in 1968 to 25.
Mine-Mill hopes, however, to se-

t cure voluntary compliance even
from the employers that may be
‘exempt in this or future years.

Q—Who administers the new
law?

A——The five-member Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission recently appointed by
President Johnson. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Jr. heads the com-
mission, which also includes a
; gj-.Texas minister, a Wisconsin en-
‘ - gineer, a Kansas attorney, and
' j the assistant chief of the Califor-

  

 

7 4 served on the Ladies’ Garment
Workers’ staff there. Two of the
.. commissioners are minority
. . group members. .
, Q——How does an individual
j file a complaint of discrimina-
tion under the new law?
A—If he lives in one of 25
-. states with its own FEPC law
- (mostly in the Northeast, the
industrial Midwest, and the Far
 West), he‘ must first institute
 proceedings under the state
'-;_’  ‘statute. State authorities have
   160 days in which to handle com-
 plaints before the matter is
turned over to the U.S. Commis-
 sion. The charge of discrimina-
; -tion, which must -be in writing
 -— and -under oath, must be filed
 within 90 days after the discrim-
' "_in_atory practice ‘occurred.

 

 

outf such: F‘-EPC‘ laws?  ..

:A-.—;.'1‘he. complaint iisjfiled -di- ; :
,_ct1y;with  Commission ,.: .

, and labor unions from discriminating on the basis of race,
pgrading, demotion, transfers,

ght to provide equality of opportunity on the job for mem-

in Washington, which will at-
tempt. to settle the case volun-
tarily. If it is unable to do so,
the individual has 30 days in
which to bring a civil action in
Federal Court.

Q—Can the commission take
a case to court?

A——It can prefer charges of
general discrimination to the at-
torney general, who can go to
court. The main jobs of the com-
mission, however, are to investi-
gate, conciliate, and seek volun-
tary compliance.

Q—-What penalties do employ-
ers face if found guilty?

A—Courts can enjoin defend-

ants from engaging in such dis-,

criminatory practices. The com-
pensation due a successful com-
plainant is still somewhat un-
clear, but would probably in-
clude back pay from the time
he sought employment or union
membership, if a union were
the defendant. ’

Q——Are other groups besides
Negroes protected by the law?

A—Yes. In certain areas of
the country, the law will apply
primarily -to such groups as
M e x i c a n - Americans, Puerto
Ricans, or Indians. The law also
prohibits discrimination because
of national origin and religion.
Thus Jews, Roman Catholics,
Italians, or Slavs, who still
sometimes are discriminated
against, are protected.

Q—Does an employer, union,
or employment agency have to
give preferential treatment to
members of minority groups?

A—-No. The law does not ask
that discrimination in the past
be corrected by giving preferen-
tial treatment to minority
groups in the future. It asks
only what its title implies-
equal opportunity for all at the
present time. Should an employ-
er lean over backwards to hire
minority group members over
whites, a white worker could
bring a complaint of discrimina-
tion under the law.

Q—Does the law apply to
trainees as well as fulltime
workers?

A—Yes. Discrimination is pro-
hibited in apprenticeship and
other training programs, wheth-

er run by management or un— \

ions.

Q—-May aptitude test still be
given to job applicants? .

A——Yes, but they must be
equally administered in all
cases.

Q.—How can I get further in-
formation about this new law?

A——Your local union and your
employer both should be well
informed on the subject. Pam-
phlets can be obtained, too, from
the Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission, Washington,
D.C. 20210.

Incidentally, employers in
compliance with the new law
are required to post notices stat-
ing a fair hiring policy. Help
make sure that such posters are
displayed at your plant.

BIGGEST WAGE INCREASES EVER WON IN THE MARITIME PROVINCES by any

union are included in the recent settlement at the Wedge mine near Botthurst, New
Brunswick. Mine‘-Mill negotiating committee included, L. to R: Wcilier Duclos and
Wilfred Mullin of Locotl 1029; Hotrvey Murphy, noitionctl vice-president; Al Richardson,
Local 1029 president, who hectded the committee; William Kennedy, ncttionctl executive
board member; and Cleo Morrison, financial secretotry of the locotl union.

In New Contract
At Wedge Mine

BATHURST, New Brunswick

—A contract agreement that will
heavily influence the fortunes of
labor throughout the maritime
provinces has been settled at
the Wedge mine, represented by
Mine-Mill Local 1029. Top wage
increases for the 31 - month
agreement are 82 cents per
hour, while the lowest wage
hike is 55 cents per hour.
The settlement, in what has
been traditionally a low wage
area, brings wage rates to al-

most parity levels with those-

of other sections of the country.
It surpasses in every respect
the agreement reached a few
weeks before between the Steel-
workers Union and Brunswick
Mining Company‘ which had
supposedly set a pattern for the
area.

The lowest differential in
wages (for underground labor)
finds the Steel contract drag-.
ging 26 cents per hour behind
the Wedge agreement; the min-
ers’ rate 37 cents an hour he-
hind; and journeyman trades’
rates 52 cents an hour behind.
The Brunswick Mining proper-
ty is only a few miles from the
Wedge mine.

Gains won are the highest
ever in this province. The con-
tract also provides for a total of
eight holidays. Hours of works
with . maintenance of take-home
pay will be reduced to 40 per
week on April 1, 1966.

The Wedge property is a
small but profitable Cominco
holding, and a powerful role
was played by the Mine-Mill
lead-zinc workers of Kimberley,
Trail, and other Cominco prop-
erties in Western Canada, which
combined with the militant stand
of the Wedge employees to force
a settlement.

Local 1029 President Al Rich-
ardson headed the bargaining
committee, which included Wal-
ter Duclos, Wilfred Mullin, Na-
tional Vice-President H a r v e y
Murphy, and Board Member
William Kennedy.

Local I 8 Aids in Idaho
Fight Against Safes Tax

KELLOGG, Idaho—As the re-
sult of a petition campaign in
which members of Mine-Mill
Local 18 here took an active
part, this .state’s voters will
have an opportunity in Novem-
ber, 1966 to approve or reject
a three percent state sales tax
enacted by the legislature in
this year’s session.

The tax is to become effective
on July 1, 1965.

Although some legislators this
year pushed to place the issue
before the voters, their attempts
were defeated. Instead, the sales
tax bill was jammed through
the legislature with the backing
of the state’s big businesses and
most of its leading newspapers.

Successful Drive

With some 25,800 signatures
required to force a referendum
vote on the sales tax, close to
triple that number had been
obtained by the May 18 deadline
for submitting petitions to the
Secretary of State’s office.

Not only did almost all of the
Local 18 members sign. peti-
tions; many circulated them
throughout ‘the community as
well. Many small businessmen
in the area, who placed petitions
in their stores to gather signa-
tures, were enlisted in the
campaign.

The Mine-Mill local alone was
responsible for getting well over
1,000 signatures, with Interna-
tional Representative Lew Coch-

-ran personally turning in over

hits hardest low income workers
and families. The anti-sales tax
literature used in the petition
campaign points out that needed
revenues can be obtained by
other, more progressive means,
including closing present tax
loopholes, revising present tax
levy rates, and adding other tax
bases.

One of the major arguments
in newspaper editorials during
the legislative session was that
a sales tax would provide an
incentive for mining companies
to continue to operate and to ex-
pand. The possible reduction in
property tax rates was also
used as an argument. Hank Day
of the Day Mines, it might be
pointed out, also has substantial
financial interest in The North
Idaho‘ Press, which carried

almost daily front page editor.-,_

ials in support of the sales tax
bill.

Although the petition cam-
paign to give Idaho voters the
opportunity to speak on the
issue was highly successful, the
real fight will come in the many
months ahead, prior to the Nov.
8, 1966 general election.

THE MINE-MILL UNION *’

 

(Continued From Page 1)
ards, while encouraging the
states to take over the enforce-
ment, it is reported. States
would have to submit satisfac-
tory enforcement plans, how-
ever, and the fedaral govern-
ment could take over the en-
forcement in any state failing
to, live up to the federal code.

The compromise approach was
worked out primarily by Rep.
James G. O’Hara (D-Mich.),
who chaired the hearings in
the absence of Rep. Elmer J.
Holland (D-Pa.), and Rep. Al-
bert H. Quie (R-Minn.), the
ranking Republican on the sub-
‘committee.

The American Mining Con-
gress, major voice for mine
management, is said to not like
the compromise version much
‘better than the original.

Such a bipartisan approach on
the matter of who enforces, of
course, still leaves undecided
the matter of broadness of
coverage. The full committee,
in other words, may still add

Other members of the sub-
committee were Reps. Roman

(D-F1a.), William D. Hathaway
(D-Maine), John M. Ashbrook

‘(R-Ohio), and Ogden R. Reid

(R-N.Y.).
Tentative Timetable

Any bill approved by the
House Education and Labor
Committee will then go to the
Rules Committee, headed by
Howard Smith (D-Va.). It could
be tied up there for 21 days be-
fore being brought out for a
vote on the floor. .

A House vote, therefore,
could come late this monthor
sometime in July. '

Meanwhile, in the Senate, al-
though Senators Metcalf, Mon-
toya, and Moss introduced their
mine‘ safety bill early in the
session, the administration’s bill
has not yet been proposed. _It
now appears probable that any
action there, including hearings,
will be postponed until after the
lower chamber has acted.

Labor Testimony
In addition to Mine-Mill, six
other international unions plus
the national AFL-CIO presented
testimony at .the mine safety

hearings. Sidney Zagri, legisla- *

tive counsel for the Internation-
al Brotherhood of Teamsters;
Frank Hoffman, legislative
director of the United Steel-
workers of America; and Law-
rence J. Ahern, director of Re-
search, Education, Health and
Safety, for the International

Chemical Workers Union ap-_

peared before the subcommittee
on May 5. Statements were filed
on behalf of Harry , Bridges,

tional secretary of the Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers.

Andrew J. Biemiller, director
of the AFL-CIO’s Dept. of Legis-
lation, filed a statement urg-
ing that coverage be extended
to smelters, and refineries.

' Theunified approach of the‘-
‘labor testimony was that the ad-.

ministration bill needs beefing
up, particularly in the areas of
increased coverage and enforce-
ment powers to correct all haz-
ards. ‘

Congressional Witnesses

Rep. King called for_ five
specific amendments to the
bill. He said it should provide
broader enforcement powers,
cover smelters and refineries
in addition to mines and mills,

In one copper mine in Butte, Montana, we have up to
300' of our drivers working alongside the copper miners as
full-time production workers.

A young man entering these mines is exposed to- a
greater risk than his brother who joins any arm of the de-
fense establishment. It is 16 times safer to become a Marine
than to work a mine, p-it or quarry.

In talking with Secretary-Treasurer Joe Rossman of
Local No. 2 in Butte, he emphasized to me how easy it is to
get agreement on safety in the front office and how hard it is
to get enforcement at the mine face.

We wish that the general public were aware of the risks
and of the courage shown by the front-line production worker
in mines, pits and quarries. But this is not the case.» Were
it the case, something would have long ago been done to
make his chances of survival equal to or better than the
chances of survival enjoyed by production workers in other
industrialized countries. The time has come for action.

We call for the passage-of a bill which is inclusive in its
scope and leaves no loopholes through which the small
corner-cutting operator can evade the intent of-the law.

  ILWU Statement Tells
Benefits ofSafety Law

Editor’s Note: Following are excerpts from a statement
submitted to the House Select Labor Subcommittee hearings
on May 5 by the ILWU: '

The International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s
Union supports H.R. 6961, a bill designed to promote the
health and safety of workers in metal and nonmetallic min-
eral industries. The bill, if adopted, would authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to promulgate safety standards applica-
ble to the industry, to provide safety inspectors,- and to estab-
lish machinery for enforcement.

Essentially similar legislation was passed by the Congress
on August 23, 1958 as an amendment to the Longshoremen’s
and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. (Public Law 85-742).
This legislation applies to the longshore and shipbuilding in-
dustries, both of them extremely hazardous industries, as is
metal mining. Both, like metal mining, were suffering from
extremely high accident rates.

Since the passage of the 1958 amendment, the injury fre-
quency rate (the average number of disabling work injuries ,
for each million employee-hours worked) in our industry—_—the
longshore industry—has fallen very substantially. The ‘nation-
al frequency rate dropped from 125.3 in 1961, the first year_
for which reliable and comparable figures became available,
to 96.8 in 1964. In terms of numbers ofinjuries, the decline-.
was from 9,710 in 1961 to 7,794 in 1964., , f 1, A s _

The sharp reduction in longshore injuries can properly be
attributed in a very large measure to theoperation of the
1958 amendment setting up federal safety machinery. In- June,
1960, the Bureau of Labor Standards _(U.S. Dept. of Labor),
the administering agency, issued “Safety and Health Regula-
tions for Longshoring,” a-comprehensive-safety code for the
industry. This code, it is import to emphasize, was prepared
after full consultation with representatives of both the em-
ployers and the interested unions. We are glad to see that
Section 5(a) of H.R. 6961 has a similar provision for consul-
tation with advisory committees

These Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring are
enforceable under the terms of the law. Any employer who
willfully violates its provisions is subject to a fine of not less
than $100 and not more than $3000 for each violation. We are
glad to note, however, that the emphasis of the Bureau» of
Labor Standards is upon securing voluntary compliance. Very
little resort to sanctions has been necessary. -

» In this matter of enforcement, we haveone criticism of — i '
HR. 6961. Section 5(b) provides that “mandatory standards”-
may be promulgated, but only with respect to “major haz- _
ards.” On the basis of our experience, we think this section
should be amended to eliminate this restriction; mandatory‘
staindards should be authorized to deal with all types of haz-)
ar s.

We urge the committee to
seriously’ consider the plight
of the worker who does not
receive any benefit of cover-
age in health and safety mat-
ters from his sovereign state.

While it is true that overall
frequency and severity rates
for all industries in . 1963
were among the lowest in his-
tory, in every case those in-’
dustries and‘ sub-industries
covered by this proposed leg-
islation had higher rates of
frequency and severity of ac-
cidents than the average for
all industries. Underground
mining (excepting coal) had
.a frequency rateover five .
times greater’ (33.71) than‘
the average (6.12); quarry
operations over twice as
great (14.69); surface min-
ing about one and one-half
as great (8.47); clay products
(8.04); and non-ferrous
metals (6.41).

Similarly, underground
mining (except coal) had a
severity rate of 5,630 vs. the
average for all industries of
682. T

The International Chemical
Workers Union believes there
is no way possible to cope
with health and safety prob-
lems in the mining and
smelting industries other than
by a federal law.

Four co-sponsors of a bill
Rep. King had introduced earlier
in the session (the Metcalf-
Montoya proposal) presented
testimony —- Rep. Morris K.
Udall (D-Ariz.), brother of the
Interior Secretary, Rep. Arnold
Olsen (D-Mont.), Rep. Edward
J. Patten (D-N.J.), and Rep.

George F. Senner, Jr. (D-Ariz.).

Olsen argued that federal legis-
lation is needed because of the
varying degrees of effectiveness
of state agencies. Mining opera-
tors in states with strict safety
laws, he said, are at a competi-
tive disadvantage to those in
areas where state laws are in-
adequate or enforcement is lax.

Rep. John P. Saylor (R-Pa.)
urged the subcommittee to re-
port out a strong bill, particu-

.. larly emphasizing that small

from coverage as in the case of

Act. Rep. Frank M. Clark (D-

The need fo-r H. R. 6961 is
great. The various states
have failed to protect ade-
quately the safety and health
of mine workers. Their codes,
their standards and regula-

enforcement efforts vary
from state to state and suf-
fer from inadequate funds,
inadequate manpower, and
local politics. Worker safety
is too important to remain a
prisoner of this vicious cycle.

Subcommittee members ques-
tioned Doyle intensely for close
to ‘an hour on problems concern-
ing silicosis and the risks of
lung cancer in uranium mines.
The final two days of hear-
ings were reserved for the op-
position— the mining company

representatives and the state,

mine inspectors.

On Thursday, Dr. James Boyd,
president of the Copper Range
Company, spoke for the Ameri-

enforcement “disgraceful” in his testimony before a House Select

Asking that the proposed federal mine safety legislation provide for inspections on at least an annual basis, he
noted that the mines covered by an Interior Department survey a few years ago were inspected twice during the
two-year period. “The second inspections revealed that more than 2,000 hazardous conditions had developed in the
intervals since the original inspections were made,” Skinner stated.
' Under consideration by the nine-man subcommittee, chaired by Rep. James G. O’Hara (D-Mich.) in the ab-
sence of Rep. Elmer J. Holland (D-Pa.), were three bills proposing federal action to promote safety in the metals

and minerals mining industry.
The administration bill on the
subpect, introduced in the House
by Reps.» O’Hara and Raymond
F. Clevenger (D-Mich.) on
March 31, later received ap-
proval from the subcommittee.
.The measure is now before the
full House Education and Labor
Committee, which will debate

' -‘several proposed amendments.

Amendments Proposed

 1 ‘ Skinner ’ maintained that the
legislation should cover smelters ~

‘and _ refineries in addition to
mines, and mills and~that en-
-"for'ceme'nt"power‘s' should be ex-
tended “so that compliance with
-all safety code provisions may
be assured.” The administra-
tion bill presently would pro-
vide only limited powers ‘to
correct specific types of viola-
tions.

niembers, Maclovio R. Barraza
of Tucson and VernedCurtis of

-at the hearings, as did Research

by federal authorities in 1962
and 1963 was found to be in

code. A total of 183 violations
were tabulated—an average of

than in any other state.

O’Hara ' Gommenls
ﬁn M-M Testimony

“I would like to advise you
- that I have read the state-
ments that you submitted
and I am going to encourage
any members of the subcom-
‘ mittee who have not to do so.
I think they are excellent
and‘ I appreciate in partic-
-ular thefact that they are
specific with examples of

“I was particularly inter-

efforts of your organization
to strengthen the mine safety
operations of the states, and
s the‘ nearly total failure of
those efforts. —. . . Thank you
Very much, gentlemen. We

.appreciate your help.”

California, the four. states com-
prising his district, “all suffer
from grossly inadequate state
mine safety programs,” Curtis
told the subcommittee members.
The Interior Department study
found more violations of state
law in Utah than in any other
state—a total of 875 violations.
Sixty-eight of 69 mines studied
were in violation, reported Cur-
tis, who also noted that the
state did not respond to a re-
quest from the Interior Depart-
ment “as to the number of
orders issued or citations for

, these and other violations of the

Utah safety law.” _

His testimony also points to a
rising tide of fatal accidents in-
volving the operators of heavy
equipment in open pit mines
caused by bank slides or cave-
ll’lS.

Poor Law in Nevada

The number of Nevada viola-
tions reported is relatively low,
he said, “because there isn’t
much of a mine safety law to
violate ‘in that state.” Of 38
articles in the Nevada law, he
stated, one dates back to 1909,
27 were written or last revised
in 1911, five in-1919. The most
recent article,- drafted in 1957,
provides that no man shall be

‘allowed to work underground
1 alone at such a distance from
1 another person that his cries, in
.case of need, cannot begheard,
xunless impracticable. '

- Barraza’s statement pointed to

the poor record of enforcement
of state safety codes in Arizona
and New Mexico. He also quoted
a recent letter from State Mine
Inspector Roy V. Hersey to State
Senator Earl W. Cook, chair-
man of the Arizona Senate Min-
ing Committee, in which Hersey
says, “I wholeheartedly agree
with revising the Mining Code,
as it is sadly outdated. Some
rules and regulations in the
code, which was adopted way
back in 1912, no longer apply
to mining as it is done today.”

lniuries Under-reported

The testimony of the Mine-
Mill research director warned
that work injuries are being
seriously under-reported by the
mining companies. Stuart called
fo-r mandatory accident report-
ing provisions, already afeature
of the other two bills before the
subcommittee. “The picture as
presented in Secretary Uda1l’s
report to Congress,” he said,
“is bad enough. The actual sit-
uation is much worse than the
available injury data indicate.”

To emphasize the point, Mine-
Mill made several pictures
available for subcommittee study
showing workers with broken
bones, wearing casts, who had
been told to return the day. after
the accident to perform “light
duties.” Stuart also stated that
there is. evidence that disabling

can Mining Congress, admit-
ting that much improvement
was needed in the administra-
tion of state mine safety laws,
but pleading for more time for
the industry to achieve that ob-
jective. Miles Romney of the
Utah Mining Association also
testified, as did spokesmen for
the National Crushed Stone As-
sociation. The form er was
sharply questioned as to the
numerous violations of the
state safety code in Utah and
the excessive concentrations of
radon gas in uranium mines in
that state.

Opposing federal legislation in-

this area at the Friday session
were G. A. Franz, Jr., deputy
commissioner of the Colorado
Bureau of Mines; Mervin J .
Gallagher,‘ Nevada mine inspec-
tor; Francis Zupet, South Da-
kota inspector of mines; and
Joseph P. Alsippi, chief of the
Pennsylvania Division of Mines,
Quarries, and Explosives.

Zupet, the questioning re-
vealed, is the only inspector in
his state. He receives a- salary
of $3,600 a year, has no secre-
tary or other assistants, and
must operate his department on
a total budget of little more than
$6,000 a year.

When the federal govern-
ment, through such an agen-
cy as the Bureau of Mines,
comes into a state, the net
result has been an overall
improvement in the inspec-
tion and enforcement of state
and federal regulations.

The responsibility for fed-
eral action in health and
safety activities has been
established in many fields.
Some of the more objective
examples of this are such
federal activities in the coal
mines, atomic energy, in-
spection services of the De-
partment of Agriculture,
Food and Drug Act, and the
Ship Inspection Service.

Annual inspection is the
key factor‘ that will curtail
accidents and fatalities. In-
spection of the mines on a
regular basis, in conjunction
with the safety educational
training courses of the De-
partment and the activities
of the Division of Health,
would go a long way in elim-
inatingdisasters and the
number of accidents that
have, and are, taking place
in metallic and nonmetallic
mining.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

June, ‘I955  

Executive Board Conﬁdent of Victory Pension changes Coming Rapidly; 

In ‘Conspiracy’ Case; Rehearing Asked

DENVER, Colo.—The Mine-M_ill international executive board, meeting here at the end of April,
expressed absolute confidence in the eventual reversal of the conviction of six past and present
Mine-Mill officers on the charge of conspiracy to defraud the U. S. government by filing false non-

Communist affadavits.

In a statement on the case, the board maintained that “The only evidence of apparent conse-
quence relates to nothing more than a few alleged conversations three of the defendants had with
their associates in the union in 1949, 16 years ago." Pointing out that five of the original 11 defend-
ants have now been acquitted, the executive board said it has “unqualified confidence not only in the
justice of the case of our six brothers, but in their qualities as American citizens and as trade un-

ion leaders. We look forward
to their exoneration and, in our
efforts to that end, we know we
will continue to have the support

not only of every single member -

of this union, but of the large
number of unions and their lead-
ers who have supported this
struggle from the beginning.”
The Federal Court of Appeals
in Denver had upheld the convic-
tion of the six defendants on
April 26. On May 6, attorneys
Telford Taylor, Nathan Witt,
and George Francis filed a peti-
tion for rehearing and, in early
June, ,a' supplemental petition

based on a May 24 decision of

the U.S. Supreme Court. These
petitions probably will be acted
upon , shortly by the appellate
court. ’

If denied, the U. S. Supreme
Court will be asked to review
the case and, if it agrees, argu-
ments will -probably be heard
sometime this fall or winter,
with a decision likely to be
handed down prior to the court’s
adjournment in June, 1966.

Defendants in the case are
A. -C. Skinner, international
president; Irving Dichter, sec-
retary—treasurer; Harold Sand-
erson, administrative assistant;
Raymond Dennis, District 4
board member; Charles H. Wil-
son, international representa-
tive; and Maurice Travis, for-
mer secretary-treasurer, who is
no longer with the union.

Issue of Vouchers.

In their petition for a rehear-
ing, the defense attorneys again
stated that union expense
vouchers which would have
cleared Dichter of a part in the

. alleged conspiracy should have_
been allowed as evidence in the

Federal District Court trial. The
vouchers, they contend, in help-
ing Dichter, would also have
aided the other defendants,
aside from discrediting the testi-
mony of a government witness,
Ralph W. Locke of Torrance,
Calif., who testified against sev-
eral of the men.

The defense also maintains
that the appellate court judges
failed to recognize the defects of
allowing the testimony of a
dead man, William Mason of
Butte, Mont., to be read to the
jury.

Also challenged were U. S.
Dist. Judge Alfred A. Arraj’s
final instructions to the jury, in
which he-failed to point out that

a defendant had to concur in or
adopt policies mentioned at a
meeting in order for the state-

ments at the meeting to be used ‘

against him‘.

Should it be necessary to ap-
peal to the Supreme Court, the
defense attorneys are expected
to deal with the fundamental is-
sue involving the nature of the
indictment itself, saying it was
legally defective to ‘begin with.
The sufficiency of the evidence
will again be challenged, and
many other issues will be
pointed up.

Taylor, who was chief prose-
cutor at the Nuremberg war
crime trials in 1945, has said
that 90 to 95 percent of the gov-
ernment’s case is based upon
vicarious admissions —- admis-
sions made by someone other
than the defendants.

The April 26 opinion of the
appellate court was written by
Chief Justice Alfred P. Murrah
of Oklahoma City. Others sit-
ting on-the case were Justices

John C. Pickett and Delmas C.
Hill.

Board Statement

“With the passage of time,”
said the Mine-Mill executive
board -statement, “it has be-
come more and more obvious.
that this case serves no useful
purpose- and is devoid of justice
or logic. The indictment was
handed down in‘ 1956, but the
law on which it is based--the
non-Communist affidavit section
of Taft-Hartley——was-repealed in
1959, even before the first trial
took place.”

Five defendents have been ac-
quitted—two on the first trial,
two on the first appeal, and one
one the second trial. “Yet,"

points out the board, “the basic 6

charge against them was the
same as it was against the six
who have been convicted. In
other words, five men have been
found innocent while six others
have been convicted not only of
the same charge but in the same
case.”

Benefits lip, Retirement Age Down  

By Irving Dichter
International Secretary-Treasurer

ENSION PLANS in industry are changing so rapidly, it is dif-
ficult to keep up with the latest developments. The changes

are all for the good. Pensions are going up. Retirement age is
coming down. . .

These changes are long overdue. The "pensions negotiated by
most unions, our included, four or five years ago are today totally
inadequate. They provide such a meager income that they lead not
to “golden years” but to pauperization. A man with 30 years -of
service gets the magnificent sum of $75 per month from his com-
pany pension plan upon retirement. Even ‘
with Social Security he still remains at a
poverty level.

In addition, all of these pension plans
provide for normal retirement at age
65. Any form of early retirement with
actuarial deductions reduces the pension
so drastically—Social Security, too, being
reduced by early retirement—-that it is
impossible to live on the retirement in-
come. The workers in our industry-
young and old —- would welcome livable
early retirement pensions. The older
worker, because after 30 to 40 years in
a mine or smelter, he wantsvto enjoy in
his -few more years some of the fruits
of his life. The younger worker, with au- —
tomation squeezing out jobs, would have some greater sense of
security about his own job. -

‘k,**

HE UNITED AUTOMOBILE WORKERS met a standard in
pension negotiations with the automobile companies which gives‘
us something to shoot at. Normal retirement age is 62. Upon re-
tirement at that age, a worker receives $9.45 per month for every

 

Dichter

year of service with the company. At‘ age 65, when he is eligible ’

for Social Security, his payment drops to $4.25 a month. But a
worker can retire at age 55 at a somewhat reduced level-reduced
from the $9.45 per month—-if his age plus his service total 85.

The key feature for our industry is the 85 total. Everyone L

‘knows the metal mining and smelting industry is among the

roughest and most hazardous of occupations. Our international has
long advocated early retirement for the workers in our industry.

We sponsored a series of bills in Congress to provide for early re- —

tirement without any reduction of Social Security benefits. Pres-
ent retirement age for the workers in our industry is far above
those in major mining and smelting countries throughout the
world. I recall a recent visit of Japanese mine operators to our

Z i 5 union and, when I asked them what the normal retirement age of

Japanese miners was, they replied 55.
* * ‘k

UR MAJOR PENSION agreements will be up for negotiations
in 1966 and 1967. We look forward to these negotiations with

a great deal of anticipation. We look forward to major changes-—r if

a sharp drop in the normal retirement age and equally sharp in-
crease in pension payments. Retirement has to become what it
was meant to be—years.without aboss over your head, a time ’
clock to punch, a production or tonnage quota to meet, but with
a sufficient income to enjoy this freedom.

Electric Lawn Mowers: Watch Your Step

If you’re tired of the quirks of a gasoline-powered lawn
mower, and even more tired of the man-powered variety, you may
be considering an electric mower.

Go slow, Consumers Union advises. Of 26 electric mowers’
rated in the June issue of CONSUMER REPORTS, 24 were judged

Not Acceptable because of safety hazards.

The blade tips of a rotary lawn mower can reach speeds of
about 150 miles an hour. They can easily slice through a shoe and
can propel a stone or piece of wire lying on the grass with enough
force to cause serious injury.

Therefore adequate shielding is essential: The housing should-
extend down below the blades at sides and rear, and in front it :

should be, at worst, only a little above the blade. Five models
failed this basic requirement.

There should, in Consumers Union’s opinion, be only one ‘dis-
charge opening (8 models failed), and it should be so located that
it won’t catch the operator in the line of fire when he- is making
a sharp turn ((11 models failed). The angle at which clippings are
discharged should be no higher than 30 degrees (7 models failed).

Flip-over handles, without positive stops to prevent accidental
flipping, create further hazards. If the mower snags on an ob-
struction, such a handle is not likely to prevent‘ the operator from
walking into the mower, allowing his foot to slip under the housing
with possibly serious consequences. Only one of the flip-over handle
models tested had such stops, and it was Not Acceptable because of
another safety hazard. ' ' ’

‘The two relatively safe models Consumers Union found are
Lamburt Whizz-Purr M-19, a battery-operated rotary mower
($124.95), and .Sunbeam Power Drive Electric Automatic E800, a
cord-powered :reel mower ($164.90 ‘including 100-foot special cord).
The two are quite different from each other in handling char-
acteristics, cutting performance, and maintenance problems.
Neither offers much advantage over a safe gasoline-powered lawn
mower-—but many of the gasoline models reported on in CON-
SUMER REPORTS for July, 1963, were unsafe too.

Air Con-ditioners. Junior Size

Last summer, appliance stores ‘began advertising small, low-
priced air conditioners. The ads were often used as bait to get
customers into the store and sell them larger models. Many deal-
ers considered them a joke. _ _

But the customers must have learned otherwise, since the
small models moved out of the stores as fast as the factories
could turn them out. Actually, a small air conditioner with rated
capacity of 4,000-6,-.000 British thermal units (Btu) is likely -to be
quite adequate for a small-to-‘medium bedroom._

Furthermore, the price is agreeably low. Prices quoted to
Consumers Union’ shoppers this spring often averaged $150 or less
and occasionally dipped as low as $120, for some of the 16 models
rated in the June issue of CONSUMER REPORTS. Most of the
units can be installed by the customer, and they usually don’t re-
quire a change in house wiring since they will work on any 115-

volt, 15-ampere household circuit that is not already serving-

heavy-current appliances (if local codes permit such use).

One of these small units may be useful as a second air condi-
tioner, in a child’s room_ or den. It may work adequately in a
larger bedroom, if the purpose is only to havegthe room cool at
night. And there are cases where, in order to avoid rewiring, one
might use two of these units in a large room instead of a single
large air conditioner. Make sure, in this case, to plug each into
a separate circuit (not just a separate wall outlet).

Several of this year's models are so designed that the coin-
pressor (the noisy part) is located outside the Window, and the
window can be closed. This cuts down noise insidetlie room.

Which College for Your Child?

A ‘high-school student who considers only .a few colleges is
in effect rejecting more than a thousand others, most of which he
knows nothing about. Yet the decision is momentous for his future.

A guidance counselor can be of tremendous help in making
this decision, but the time he can spend with each student is often
quite limited. To pinpoint the schools of special interest, many
students and their parents turn to college guides. ‘

In its June issue CONSUMER REPORTS discusses six college
guides, ranging in cost from 75c to ‘$15. ‘Generally these books pro-
vide such basic information as degrees offered by each college.

its admission requirements, costs, number of men and/or women

students, and the percentage of students going on to graduate
schools.

The books were submitted to a panel of counselors, admissions

officers, and other educators. They -found some special merits and

failings in each. Despite some inadequacies, the guide considered’

most ‘likely to be useful for parents and ‘students was “Compara-
tive Guide to American Colleges,” by James Cass and Max Bim-
baum (Harper & Row, 1964; paper, $3.95; cloth, $8.95). - 1

This book stood out because it tries to make-—~or help the stu-
dent make—-value judgments of what the ‘college offers. The ‘fuller
profiles -discuss under separate -headings such factors as admissions
policy, academic environment, student body, faculty, and campus
life. ‘ ’

But panelists had some serious reservations. ;They were dis-—

appointed by the marked disparities in coverage: Though the

spirit and su—,bstance of ‘someschools were caught Well, others Were. .

so sketchily covered that the reader could get little idea of them.

_ There was concern also about whether or not some of the informa- 

tion o-n which judgments were based was up to date.

Further, the panelists weren’t too sure of the validity of _the
critical evaluations. For example,.the guide sizes up the qualifica-
tions of college faculties on an over-all basis, making no allowance
for the fact that in some schools the more experiencedjteachers
may be teaching only advanced classes. - -

The book does give more useful information, than others about
—-among other things—the academic emphases of-the schools, and

‘this is "supplemented by a. -career index showing which colleges _,
.c‘onfe"r ‘the largest number of degrees in the various..professio'n_al_

Local 847 Ratiﬁes New   ;  
Contract With Bird Corp.

A PERTH AMBOY, N. J .—Members of Mine-Mill Local 847 unani-
mouslyratified a new two-year (contract with the Bird and Son
Corp. at a ‘special membership meeting on May 9, after the
threat of strike action had forced the company to move from its

previously stubborn bargaining position.

Retroactive to May 1 were a substantially improved vacation
schedule, increased shift differentials, an additional half-day
holiday pay (for the day before Christmas), some improvements
in Blue Cross-Blue Shield benefits and life insurance, an across-
the-board wage hike of two
cents per hour, and several re-
classifications w i t h substantial
wage adjustments.

A general wage increase of
eight cents per hour is provided
in the second year of the new
agreement.

In addition, several important
contract language changes
were made. One such clause

the company, which would have
rendered the contract almost
meaningless, were withdrawn
on the last day of the negotiat-
ing sessions, when the company
realized that the workers were
ready to walk out if necessary.

The new vacation plan will
provide one week after one year
of service, two weeks after two
years, an additional day after
three, five, seven, and nine
years of service, building up to
three weeks of vacation after 10
years of service. Then, addi-
tional days are granted at years

‘many years of experience that
so-called right-to-work laws do
not. give Negro workers the
right to work.” Saying that such
laws are of no value in ending
discrimination, he said that sup-
’ po~rters of these laws “have no
interest in the welfare of work-
ing men and women. They have
.,_'only onepurpose. By weakening
‘the organized labor movement,
«they hope to systematically
lower wages, lengthen hours of

[conditions for American work-
ers, Negro and white.”

Pointing out that close to half
of the Mine-Mill membership in
the United States lives in 10 of
the 19 states now having “right-
to-/work” laws, Skinner said that

i» “we are . . . not testifying here
“today without some very con-
siderable grass roots experience
on this subject.” He said that
the union, now 72 years old, or-

are.”

Big New Silver Sfrke

  

Three significant new silver strikes have been reported in

recent weeks.

Two were in the Coeur d’Alene district in Idaho.

Sunshine Mining Company reports discovery of a 40-foot wide vein
with values considerably in excess of the 35 ounces per ton now

being realized at the Sunshine mine.

No estimate has yet been

placed on the value of the new vein.
Bunker Hill has announced a new discovery at about the 3,300-

foot level of its Crescent mine.

One face of the new‘vein is

over six feet wide, thus far is 500 feet long, and yields 75 to 100

ounces per ton. The new discovery is still being explored.
Sunshine Mining Company has also discovered an ore body

now estimated at’ over 300,000 tons at its Silver Peak, Nevada

mines. Values run 16 ounces of silver and one-half ounce of gold‘

‘k*k‘k

per ton.

Sept. Start for lrish Copper Mine
The new Tynagh copper mine in County Galway, Ireland will
start production in September, it was announced in the Dail (par-
liament). Full production of about 150,000 tons per year, it is

expected, will be reached in 1966.

Bolivian Miners Strike
A showdown between the Bolivian government and the Boliv-
ian Tin Miners’ Union was looming at Mine-Mill Union press time.
Deportation by the government of the mine workers’ leader, Juan
Lechin, had been met by a call for a general strike by the tin

miners.

People Not Told

. “Th_e people are never told,”
he said, “that a’ trade union
must represent all workers in
their certified bargaining unit
whether or not they are mem-
bers of the union.” “The people
are never told,” he said, “that
. . . if Section 14(b) should be
repealed, it would only provide

the right of a union to attempt

to negotiate a union shop with
the employer”—-an effort, he
stated, that is seldom easy.
Saying that “right-to-work”
laws inthe South‘ have been
used “to drive a wedge between
Negro and white workers,”
Skinner said he agreed with
President 'Johnson’s description
of such laws as “divisive.” He
also quotedsubcommittee Chair-
man Frank Thompson, Jr. (D-
N.J.), who has said that Sec-

.tion .14(b) “flies in the face” of

federal law and public. policy in
the U.S. which encourages acol-
lective bargaining. .

the U.S. Chamber of Com-m_erc'e
and the National_ Association of

said that the opposition to re-.

peal is “principally the con-
glomerate, interlocking director-
ate of the right wing,” main-
tains that “the outcome of the

mine the continued growth of
organized labor.”

Already repealed in Indiana
in January of this year by ac-
tion of the legislature, “right-
to-work” suffered another re-
versal late last month, when the
Kentucky Court of Appeals
struck down municipal -“right-
t-o-work” ordinances as invalid
and unenforceable. The Shelby-
ville City Council had passed
such an ordinance on Feb. 20,

The government-owned corporation which has run the mines
for the past two years has made a series of proposals to the
miners to end the heavy operating deficits at the mines. The
alternative proposals were: (1) let the mines be leased to miners’
cooperatives; (2) lease the mines to private enterprise; or (3)
continue operations on a new wage scale under new contracts.

Workers were reportedly favorably disposed to leasing of the
mines to workers’ cooperatives, but fearful that recontracting new
wage scales could lead to lowered wages and widespread layoffs.
The proposal‘ to lease the mines to private enterprise was rejected
as a move to “denationalize” the country's tin mines.

As the Union went to press, a truce between the miners and
the government junta had been worked out and most of the miners
had gone back to work. However, observers are still fearful that
a solid agreement between the miners and the government will be
difficult to achieve. * * * -

Anaconda in Georgia?  
The Anaconda Company announced at its annual meeting last
month that it was considering putting up a large plant in Georgia
to produce alumina from clay. Alumina is the intermediate prod-
uct from which refined aluminum is produced. The Georgia
alumina would be used to supply Anaconda Aluminum Company’s
aluminum plant at Columbia Falls, Montana, the capacity of which
is being increased. * * * ' '

-Developments in Chile ,

President Frei early in May withdrew legislation to implement
his program for “Chileanization” of the country’s copper industry.
Opposition from‘ right and left wing. parties to various phases of
the legislation had developed in the Mining Committee of «the
Chamber of Deputies.

The entire legislative program will be resubmitted to the new
Congress which convened May 21. President Frei’s party, the
Christian Democrats, controls the lower house and has substan-
tially increased its strength in the upper house. Observers in Chile
report the legislation is expected to pass in the new Congress.

A joint copper prospecting company, 51 percent controlled by
Anaconda and 49 percent by the Chilean government, is to‘be
organized shortly. Exploration will be carried out in the northern
part of Chile. . .

Anaconda’s _El Salvador mine and Potrerillos smelter went
right down to the wire with the Chilean Copper Workers Confed-

eration, representing 3,600 workers at the two properties. The old '
contract expired on April 30 and a strike had been set for the .

following day. The Chilean union accepted the company’s last
minute offer of a 50 percent wage increase. .

-El Soldado copper mine at E1 Cobre has restored’ production
to about 75 percent of capacity. It was at this mine that an earth-
quake on March 28 destroyed the dam at the tailings pond, causing
a flood of mud and water which took the lives of more than 300
copper miners and their families. I

On May 28, a powerful explosion at a coal mine near Dhanbad, India took,-the lives of more
than 200 miners. Another 200 may have been trapped or killed in the fire which broke out follow-
ing the explosion. Shifts were changing at the Bhori colliery, 225 miles northwest of Calcutta,
when the explosion took place. The blast rocked a f0ur~square-mile

J. Howard Bird Retires;

Well Known to Mine-Mill 

J. Howard Bird, district manager for District E, Health -and-1
Safety Branch of the U. S. Bureau of Mines in Denver, retired on 
May 21, after 35% years as a mine health and safety specialist. -
His district included North and South Dakota, Nebraska,‘ the-;..

Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states, Alaska and Hawaii. * 

Bird had general supervisory responsibility for the Bureau’s!
health and safety offices-in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Oakland, 
Calif., and Seattle, as well as the Denver office. He served on thew ,'
American Standards Association subcommittee which drafted, in;

wh e n the explosion occurred.
The miners who died were work-

and a half miles from the collar.

Another gas explosion —— this
one at the Yamano coal mine
on Kyushu Island in J apan—
killed 136 miners on Tuesday,
June 1. The mine, 500 miles
southwest of Tokyo, was sched-
uled for inspection that day,
just before the disaster.. In-
dustry Minister Yoshio Saku-
rauchi, who heads up Japan’s
mine safety program, accepted
full responsibility for the dis-
aster—the thirdin 5 months-—
and submitted his resignation.
Some 522 miners and other
workers were employed at the
pit. Besides the 136 known dead-,
100 additional »workers were
feared trapped.

Federal Inspections

, The U. S. Bureau of Mines re-
inspected the Maiden Rock,
Canyon Creek, and East La
Marche phosphate mines of the
Victor Chemical Division, Stanf-
fer Chemical Company in Silver
Bow County, Montana in mid-
April. 4 The inspections were
made pursuant to the Bureau’s

authority to inspect mines on
Indian lands and government
leases in the public domain.

The Bureau repeated recom-
mendations made in previous
reports that only U.S. Bureau
of Mines-approved, mobile, die-
sel-powered equipment be used
underground; t h a t corrective
measures should be taken at
Canyon Creek to prevent recir-
culation of air by the booster
fan in the 5503 lateral drift
south; and that the Maiden Rock
mine should be equipped with a
main fan installed in fireproof
housing, preferably on the sur-
face.

Excerpts from the reports are
quoted below:

San Manuel Employee

Dies in May 19 Accident

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.—Joe Ro-
mero, a mechanic helper, was
killed on May 19 while working
on a major repair project at the
underground pocket and skip-
loading area at the 2,000-foot
level of Magma Copper Com-
pany’s 3A shaft. He was crushed

by an 1800-pound overhead

“surge gate,” which had not
been used in the past two years,
yet was not locked.

A member of the Machinists
Union, who formerly was repre-
sented by Mine-Mill, Romero
was 28 years old. He leaves his
wife and five children.

Raymond Cuadras, a safety
committeeman for Mine-Mill Lo-
cal 937, investigated the fatal
accident, along ‘with Business
Agent Rodolfo Garcia and In-
ternational Representative
Frank Vettorel. They talked to
the coroner, contacted the state
mine inspector’s office, and dis-

~ cussedcthe accident with Keith
— Sta1ey,mine superintendent, and

Frank Buchella, general manag-
er, but were refused in their

request that the company call

to investigate. .
Repair of the loading area is

completed, and work at the 3A
shaft had been started on
May 16.

The “surge gate” was held up
by air pressure to an air cylin-
der. The air, however, also con-
trols other gates and mecha-
nisms in other areas of the pock-
et. Because of work in progress
at a different area, the air flow
was turned off, thus allowing the
gate to fall.

The union, according to a re-
port on the accident sent to Ari-
zona’s Congressional delegation,
maintains that the fatality
“could have been prevented,‘ if
management had secured the
heavy gate prior to sendingany
workmen into thepocket loading
area.” ‘
