How to fight the freeze

Several events receiitlyrhave proven how fruitless it is for any I
union to permit the Wage Stabilization Board to “take over” its _

negotiations, with the boss. , .‘ .  - _
Weeks ago,—the CIO Oil Workers set a strike date and cleared
the decks for action. Their case was “certified? to the Wage Stabili-

- zation Board for hearings, and the Oil Workers union, in concert with
"other unions in theindustry, called off "the strikerpand agreed to ,
 accept AWSB action on their dispute. A  '

The Board called hearings in several cities, and the',Oil’Workers 
spent thousands of dollars in ,preparing briefs for these hearings. :
. Came the date of -the hearings—.and the ‘oil industry bosses didn’t -even.
 show up.’ 5 ' ’ v '

Instead 'i of rebuking the oil magnates, the Wage ‘Stabilization
Board turned the case back to the parties," with the recommendation

— that they “resume negotiations!” Now the Oil ,Workers "are clearing

the decks for strike action once again—-after being -stalled for-"weeks.

The oil case has become ‘typical ofall those where the union
permits the WSB to “move in.’_' - A »

THE SAME THING happened in steel, where_ the CIO; ‘Steel-
workers Union called off its strike weeks ago in order to permit the

‘WSB to hold hearings. Management refused to accept the WSB‘ rec-‘

ommendations. President Truman seized the industry. The Steelwork-

' ers’ called off their strike, but they didn’t get their wage increase

-under government operation, so once again they are talking of re-
turning to the picket lines. ‘ '

THEN THERE’S the case’ of the CIO United Auto Workers in
the brass industry. They, too, called off a strike—’-way last fall———

. when their dispute was referred to the Board. But the Board is still

stalling on recommendations made by its own panel Weeks ago, and
the brass bosses are saying they won’t accept the recommendations

if they come through. So the brass Workers in UAW are back in the

same spot they were in last fall——getting ready for strike.
EQUALLY SHOCKING is the long-standing dispute between the

 CIO Steel union and both New Park Mining and U. S. Smelting &

Refining in Utah. This case has been kicking around in WSB offices
for months—-ever since last summer. N ow comes word that the union
and the‘ companies have finally agreed to let the WSB" make a “final
and binding”. decision on what their settlement should be. I 4

The lesson is clear. Mine-Mill-showed the way last year by refus-

ing to permit certification of Its “dispute” with thecopper companies

-to the WSB. By rejecting the WSB as a third party at the bargaining
table, we put the heat where it belon’ged—-at the door of the copper
bosses. .

The WSB didn’t get a chance to ,_ touch the Mine-Mill case until
AFTER we had finished bargaining with the boss and gotten his
signature on a~-contract. Then, and then only, did" the WSB enter the
picture. That meant quick approval of every penny in the Mine-Mill
“package.” ' " -

Monolth workers
score big gams

«E TEI-I'A‘CHAPI, Ca1if.—A new con-
tract covering 450 workers at the
’Monolith Portland Cement plant here
vl7as'i signed by the negotiating com-
niittee of Local 550 late in March.
"‘.The pact culminated six months of
Intensive negotiations‘ during which
 members of ‘Local 550. staged one
_,work stoppage, and following a layoff
.by_,,the company, refused to work any
0 overtime until the company came to
-an agreement. H
The company obtained a temporary
Léfirestraining order. against the local and
5 its Inembers because of their refusal
 tofwork overtime. It also filed suit for
"more than .-a million dollars in damages
against the local, its officers and mem-
 bers, and the International union.
[ WHLEN THE HEARING on the com-
mApa'ny’s petition for an injunction took.
place in Bakersfield, some 45 miles
 away from the plant, every member of
ifthe. union appeared in the courtroom
 in response to the company lawyer’s
.,sum:;1ons. Thus as a result of“ its own
suit; the company was again forced to‘
shutdown operations. ‘ y - _
 ‘Main features of the new agreement

 '~ l.dcaI 7.00 convention sets 

program, honors John Clark ,   _   T

LOS/ANAGELES, Calif. —— A special
‘tribute’ to ’Int’l .president John Clark
was paid by’the'1delegates to the fourth
‘annual convention of Western Mechan-
ics Union,lLocal 700, here April 6?

Thou delegates, elected by workers-

ln all the shops covered by the large
amalgamated local, adopted: resolu-

..tion declaring _ that “this = convention

[takes great pride inexpreseinz its ap-
preciation and commendation, of’ John
Clark, our International President.”

Speakers in addition to Clark 1511- ‘

eluded Wyndham Mortimer, one of the
original organizers of the CIO United
Auto ;Workers and Mine-Mill Int’l rep.
/Frank Allen who reported on, the

struggle for the rights of Negro work- » -

era, in the South.

THE HARD-WORKING convention
also heard reports from Local. 700 ad-
ministrator. Howard Goddard, business
agent Roger Boyd, ,Int’_l rep. James
Daugherty, and District 7 board mem-
ber‘ Chase; ‘Powers. ‘

The convention demanded “the im-

mediate ending of the wage freeze,’
and a return to the free processesof
collective’ bargaining," 1 and. adopted
the full 9-point -bargaining program
approved last month by the National
Wage Policy Committee in Denver.
‘ Placing particular emphasis on the
fight for fair employment practices,
the delegates approved a resolution
calling for a “stepped-up struggle for
job rights, for political, social and
economic: equality for our Negro and
Mexican - American ,, members.” .“We
must reactivize and strengthen the
Local’s FEPC committee and fight
discrimination in the plants wherever
and Whenever it happens,” the reso-
lution said. ,

The delegates resolved to campaign
in the 1952 elections for “independent,
pro-labor candidates," and protested
the application of the Smith and Mc-
Carran acts “which change the most
basic aspects of the Bill of Rights.”

High point’ of the convention dis-
cussion came around a, program of
consolidation for Local 700, calling for
an organizing drive, regular monthly

‘-

l

, nothing to do. by

local steward’: council and unit meet-
ings, twice monthly executive board
Vmeetings, and close coordination be- '
tween all units of. the local. ’ 

The delegates also agreed that “we
must continue to put into action the
Convention mandate of our. Inter-
national Union to work for an end to
the war in Korea, and for a big five
power conference to arrive at agree-
ments to end world -ten_sio‘ns.”

As the day-long convention session
drew to a close, the newly-elected "of-
ficers of the local were installed by

‘ .Int’l' president John -Clark, and Sidney

Boswell, the new 700 president, closed
with a few remarks.

A ‘Armour workers ’
are still out i  
COLUMBIA, Tenn. ;- The Armour

‘Fertilizer, plant here is still idle, be- '

cause the members of Local 546 refuse
to let ‘the company divide them.

Following a walkout which began‘
late in February, the men hadlvoted to
go back to work two weeks ago onthe
basis; of certain company proposals, as
was reported in the latissue of THE
UNION. However, the company re-
fused to let the men return "on the basis
of seniority. ‘ . I

The 1 company further refused to join‘
with the union in filing a Wage ‘Stabili-
zation Board petition for approval of
money settlements’ which had been
reached in negotiations.

The upshot of the matter was that
the workers decided they could not per-
mit the company to split them up, so
they stayed out. They are determined
to win improvements in their new
agreement, particularly on the senior-
ity issue.‘ M ' V

There is no picket line, but no pro-
duction worker enters the plant. The
only ones you can see around the plant
these days are two or three 1 ng-faced
foremen and the office crew, who have

 

evidence of a suprisingly strong shoW- .,
ing chalked up by labor and progres-
sive candidates in the Democratic pri-0'
maries in’ this state.

 McGUIRE EXP

Special to THE UNION
VANCOUVER, B. C. -— The last

1* two weeks have seen Canadian trade

union developments springing from the
Canadian Congress of Labor conven-

.tion in this city last fall, which are
bound to have a drastic effect on the
CCL. Also, they possibly presage a
new orientation in the CIO, where the
Workers are also “getting wise.”

’ Certainly Mine-Mill must take a
keen interest in the recent charges of
James E. McGuire against A A. R.
Mosher.

In August, 1948, the Canadian Con-
gress of Labor (Canadian CIO) sus-
pended the Canadian section of Mine-
Mill from affiliation. The excuse given

' ‘Twas that THE UNION, in a news story

of July 29, had not done right by our
Aaron, the grey, paunchy\A. R. Mosher
who has been head of the CCL since
its emergence from the All-Canadian
Congress of Labor, a byblow of the
fink Canadian Federatiaon of Labor,

‘ both of which organizations he had
also handled. -

THE STORY repeated charges that
Mosher, as president of the Canadian
Brotherhood of Railway Employees,
had tried to sell out his membership

1 during negotiations with the railroads,
in an agreement which left them with
Wage rates far,behind those in any
comparable industry. ,

Now James‘ E. McGuire, secretary-
treasurer for many years of the CB

of “The Old Man,” as his members
used to call Mosher, has made the
same charge and many others, fully
--substantiating the
UNION.

McGuire has been feuding with
Mosher for the past three or four
years, but emotional pressure had been
rsecurely valved until this February,
when the seething secretary blew his
I‘ top ‘in the editorial columns of the C3
of RE organ.. ‘ —

‘An article which Mosher immediately ’

disavowed and repudiated blamed

., “power politics”. within the CCL for

the walkout and subsequent resigna-
tion . of Pat Conroy, Congress secre-
tary-treasurer,’ from the CCL conven-

tion in Vancouver last fall, and without '
‘ pmentioning‘ any- names McGuire ' made

 4 _’ it’ {pretty plain that ‘Charlie Millard

_ \

and his Steelworkers machine were the

 _hoi-rible apolitical climbers. .
l . ,. The commercial press, always on
   side of, Millard’s' disruption of
. T .: «  trade unions, had never mentioned this

angle on iConroy’s action, preferring
to ‘explain "i.t..on personal ‘grounds. A
section of the labor. press had been
"realistic about it, but Steel organs and

papers supporting Mosher -had, reported '
.. only the physical’ facts of P_a.t’s dra-

.matic exit without comment, until the
C3 of RE paper broke the tacit con-

‘ gspiracy of suppression. A
AS A SUPPORTER of Millard and
his Political Action program, it was
. .more than Mosher could take. He re-
. pudiated the article, fired McGuire
from his elected position, and expelled

A5‘ "A "'3 him from his union after 34 years of

membership, which latter sentence also

,carried with it expulsion from the» '

CCL Executive Board. The permanence
i of McGu‘ire’s exile” will of course, be

Charles Millard, CIO Steelwork-
ers Union’s Top man in Canada,
and CCL’: political leader. .

decidedat the next CB of RE conven-
tion, buteat these gatherings, as in
the CCL; Mosher has always had a

-carefully selected majority of yes-

men to enforce his whims and pre-
judices. '

McGuire struck back. Illlo-f a heart‘

complaint, he was unable‘ to appear
before the executive of his union to
defend himself, but on March 28 he
listed nine charges against Mosher and
his activities in the CB of RE.

Charge three confirmed, from the in-
side, the story for. which Mosher had
expelled Mine—Mill in 1948.

Mosher, said McGuire, had, attempted
“to sell the workers down the river”
in the Montreal tramway strikes cur-‘
rent around 1948, and also in the
1948 rail-wage negotiations.

‘McGuire charged also that. Mosher i
had tried to smear the Railway ,Broth- .

erhoods while’ -acting with them dur-
ing negotiations prior to‘ the 1950

strike,‘ and that he had approached
V_D_onald Gordon,’ president of the Cana-

dian National‘ Railway, proposing a
settlement for the 44-hour week with-
out any wage increases. A '
Thiswas known to all connected with
the struggle at that time, but it took
.McGuii'-e’s. break’ to make it news-
worthy to the Canadian press. . \
Also significant, in view of the CCF
political extinction ‘I in‘. Ontario’ last

’ autumn and of approaching elections
in this province, is McGuire’s~ charge”

that Mosher had continued to .. force

official support of his union‘, for the

CCF party, “whenia questionnaire on

political action ' revealed in unmistake-

able terms that less than five per
cent of the members of the Brother-
hood wanted or‘ were even remotely

‘ in favor of using the union to suppyort

political parties." .- .
McGU_IRE ALSO panned a Mosher
deal which aroused general disgust at

’ ‘the’, time,’ hi behind-the-scenes attempt

to attach the fink“ National Maritime
Federation of Labor to the CB of RE,

which was promptly repu-diateld by the

unionwhen it became known. A _ . ,

The new contract calls for a gen-

eral increase of 10 cents an hour. Sec- -

ond class tradesmen and lampmen get
an "additional 5 cents hourly, while first
class tradesmen get an additional 15
5 cents. Firemen on large boilers where

   

Charles Crate, 

operating papers are required were re-

classified 'as’ tradesmen second class
and won a total increase of 25 cents

‘ an h_our.,A number of other favorable

reclassifications, most of them in the
cookhouse which now is operated "by
the company, ‘were made. .

The board rate remains at $2.90 a
day, Married workers
homes in Yellowknife will receive a
cost-of-living bonus‘ of 80 cents a day,
while the annual allowance of’ free
fuel oil is increaed from 5 to 12 bar-
rels a year. Fuel oil, now selling at
§13.2§ a barrel, is expected to increase
In price.

The contract also provides for re-
negotiations of wage rates if the gold
price goes above $45 an ounce. Two
more statutory holidays were also won,
bringing the total to six. And the com-
pany agreed to pay taxi-fares to and
from the airport onvthe same basis as

SE5 MOSHER

Mosher. His early union history is
one of maaking such deals with the
employers for his CB of RE, to “save"
their employees from the rabid “for-
eign” reds of the AFL. In this past
18 found the reason _for the CB of
RE’s disgraceful wage scales and con-
ditions. ‘ _

Mosher, said McGuire, used spies
and informers to “get something” on
his associates, is now using his union
and CCL presidencies to snare a seat
in the Canadian Senate, and has ac.
cepted salaries,
pension concurrently from the union.

_Finally, said McGuire, Mosher has
liquidated eight other union leaders
who refused to be dominated by him.
“I,” said the liquidated secretary-
treasurer, “will never submit to Hit-
lerzan methods of purging at which
Mosher is so eff2'ci'ent.’f

Mosher 'hit...back in typical fashion.

‘He sued ‘McGuire for libel, and ob-.

tained an interim injunction against

his repeating the charges before trial. 2*

He is also attempting to suppress the
charges _completely _by obtaining an-
other injunction against their publica-

tion anywhere, but with no success -

announced as yet. 
‘At present, the row is a family peeve

withinthe CB of RE. But the spark ‘

that ignited. the McGuire explosion
flashed within the CCL, and Mosher
is the CCL president, holding control

, by the same methods of purging Mc-

Guire ascribes to him within hisown
union. flow far_ Congress will be af-
fected it would be rash to guess, con-
sidering the Mosher-Millard elements
which presently dominate it. ,

BUT ONE THING is certain, that
all Mine-Mill charges of Mosher-Mill-
ard corruption» and disruption of the
principles of trade unionism I have re-

. ceived corroboration from one "who, as

secretary-treasurer of Mosher’s own
union and ,.,an executive member of
Congress, should be in a position to

_.FIi-mg of \McGuire caused an uproar
in the Mosher-Millard dominated Van-

,couver_and »Di_stri,ct .Labor Council. A.
‘resolution for investigation of the cir-

cumstances .was passed by the rank-
and-file against strong opposition from
the chair and executives. “The Old
Man" is beginning to smell like some-
thing else.

Another attack on Mosher came at
the same meeting from the delegate
of the Canadian Communications~Asso-_
ciation, who charged him with raid-,
ing ‘I118 organization, and then walked
out, stating that the CCA had voted to_
leave the CCL. . '

From the fink Canadian Federation‘ A

Of Labor, through A the semi-fink All-
Canadian Congress of Labor, _ to the
pseudo-respectable Canadian Congress
of .Labor—such has been .Mosher"s'
progress. It the CCL dumps him and
Millard now, and with them the shame

of the past, it could be a veryfortunatoéi

turn for Canadian labor.‘ _ L‘

_C_INCINNATI, Ohio -— ‘_,‘Collective
bargaining” among‘ nations is what’s
needed to prevent a third world war.

That's the "-belief of I-Iugo'lErnst,

” president of the AFL Hotel & Restau-
" ‘rant Int’l Union, who says in a long
,~:~"l editorial in'the current issue of his
, l‘uni.on’s magazine that war or peace is”

' ll  .- ‘To- attain world ,peace, he says, cer-
tain basic. understa-ndings must, be -
preached. First. “nobody,~but-NOBODY‘, 
can ‘win’ an atomic war.» Th_e’second -
  is that the socialist part of the world,
“  and? the "free enterprise part of "the
‘_worlgl,- can get along « on the same '

of’ bed on March 20 and read his pa-
pers, he 'must have had a; surprise.
For there staring him in" the face was
a huge ad, saying: I ’ -

nently? _ _ _ _ '

, . ‘‘It’s’ a great day for us, Mr. Presi-/up

were won for us by , our’ union—the-..

and struggle.” M _ , -

, BUT-_¥they addedi—“e\ven if 'it’s ’a

great day ,for us,  Truman-—we’re

not so happy about it. For the union

' from an annual wage of $540 in 1934

to an annual average‘ of $5200‘ is

smeared andrlibeled every day. " And

do you lmow—we think itis because

they have fought for us that they are

smeared, libeled, attacked and prose-
cuted . . . and for that reason only!

And they‘ reminded, Harry S. Tru-
