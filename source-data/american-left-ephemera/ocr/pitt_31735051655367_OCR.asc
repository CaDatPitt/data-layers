“HoW We Are Gouged”

Is a 32-page pamphlet containing Arthur
Brooks Baker’s lecture, delivered to seventy
towns on the Central Circuit of the National
Lyceum Course last winter.

Comrade Baker, in this pamphlet, treats a

serious subject in a humorous way. He makes‘

capitalism look ridiculous.

The scope of this pamphlet is shown by the
following outline:

The Basis of Life.

The Struggle for Existence.

Nature of Labor.

Labor Creates All “Go-ods.”

Varying Forms of “Goods.”

Tools and Invention.

Modern Machinofacture.

“Necessities” a Term of Variable Meaning.
The Workers Lack Necessities.

Ancient Forms of the “Gouge.”
Independence in Machine Society.

How We Are Gouged.

The Socialist Remedy for Gouging.
Wastes of Competitive Distribution.

The Waste of Men. - I
Socialism and the Eternal “Goods” Problem.
Socialism, the Universal Liberator.
Socialism, and the Making of Men!

Try it on the fellow with the long face and
the short purse. Get him to laugh and he will
listen to you. '

The Usurped Power
of the Courts

By Allan L. Benson.
You’ve heard a lot about “The Usurped Power

of The Courts,” but you never knew Just what_

that power is and when it was ﬁrst usurped.

This 64-page pamphlet tells y-ou. It also
gives an authentic account of the time when
Congress “Clipped the Supreme Court’s
Wings.” Here are the titles of the chapters:

The Supreme Court’s Limited Power Under
the Constitution.

The Man Who Made the Constitution.

Usurped Power Four Times Refused.

One Effort to Give Courts the Power.

John Marshall, the Father of American Judi-
cial Despotism.

When Congress Forbade the Supreme Court '

to Pass Upon a Law’s Constitutionality.

The Court’s Actual Jurisdiction.

The Court Admits Lack of Authority.

Is “Our Government an Aristocracy?”

Hrow Judicial Mangling Has Been for the In-
terest of Exploiters.

What Shall We Do to Make Our Judges Rec-
ognize the Right of the People to Make and
Enforce the Laws They WANT?

This was originally written for, and pub-
lished in Peason’s Magazine in 1911, and is
branded as the most damaging and daring evi-
dence ever produced against the courts.

Every believer in democratic government
must have a copy.

The Growing
Grocery Bill

By Allan L. Benson.

The ﬁrst paragraph reads:

“This earth is like a big bombshell. The
high cost of living is the fuse. The fuse has
burned nearly" to the shell. Something is
about to happen. Either the ﬁre will be put
out and all will be well, or the ﬁre will not be
put out and all will be hell. The French revo-
lution was caused by the high cost of living.
And a woeful woman, walking the streets of
Paris, beating a drum and crying ‘Bread,’ was
the spark that set off the shell.” '

It also says:

“It will not always be safe to keep millions
hungry.”

Mr. Bens-on hints that the masses will not
always hunger and starve quietly and politely.

This’pamphlet startles the wage-earner, the
housewife, and the politician. It presents the
evidence. It shows the fallacy of co-operative
buying and petty reforms. It gives the only
remedy—Socialism. '
