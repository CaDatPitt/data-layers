Vol. XII. No. 26  - March 29. 1954

- BUTTE, Montana—A Labor Board election “victory that can change the course of labor history in the entire Rocky '
Mountain West was scored here on March 26 when Mine-Mill tr_o_unce.d the raiding CIO Steelworkers and ended the era of
company unionism that had flourished in Montana under the direction of_W1111am and Joe Mason, Charles McLean, and

John Emmons. . V

The score in the historic National Labor Relations Board election, which took five days of balloting by Anaconda
Smeltermen and Butte miners, was 4,099 for Mine-Mill to 2,185 for'ClO Steel. There were 66 “neither” votes, 17 challenged

- Mason machine ushered

ballots, and 28 void.

The election_victory means that Butte Miners Union No. 1 and Anaconda Mill and Smeltermen’s Union N o. 117 of Mine-

Mill will be certified as a single unit to representthe miners and smeltermen in collective bar
conda Copper Mining Co. It immeasurably strengthens the entire union for this year’s‘ba

gaining with the powerful Ana-
rgaining.

The Mine-Mill triumph revives the Butte-Anaconda tradition of militant, rank-and-file unionism that made Mine-Mill

famous in Montana before the
in a
decade of soft bargaining "poli-
cies, company collaboration,
machine control, and a dissipa-
tion of union strength.

THE DEFEAT of the raiders
and the Mason crowd gives a new
look to the entire trade union and
political picture in Montana. The
AFL craft unions,’ for example,
proclaimed _.their support for
Mine-Mill against the CIO in a.
pre—election statement by the
Montana State Federation of
Labor. With the Mason sellout
policies a thing of the past, the
"Butte miners and Anaconda
smeltermen, together with Mine-
Mill locals in the rest of the state,
become a major political force
capable of successfully pushing
for badly needed legislation on
»workmen’s compensation, silico-
sis, and other issues. Labor unity
has been brought to a new high
level in Montana with the defeat
of the CIO by.Mine-Mill.

THE MOST important aspect of the
victory over the Steel raiders is the
blow it gives to raiding of our union’s
jurisdiction. The scandalous Mason be-
trayal has alerted Mine-Mill's entire
membership to the “boring from with-
in" tactics of the raiders. It is unlikely

  
   

that any local unions will look kindly
on any further attempts to raid Mine-
Mill’s membership.

“We permitted Mason to continually
attack our international union without
question,” one local leader in Butte said
the other day. “He led us right up a
blind ‘alley. We should have expelled
our troublemakers a long time ago. I

hope any local union that has trouble A

with these bought-and-paid-for traitors
in the future acts decisively and quick-
ly. They are anti-labor agents and must
be treated as such. I feel sorry for any
character who tries to pull a Mason in
the future.”

Perhaps the greatest single con-
tributing factor to Mine-Mills victory
over the raiders was the merging of the
interests of the Butte and Anaconda
rank-and-file with that of the union as
a whole. The Montana campaign will be
remembered’ for the high degree of co-

operation between Locals 1 and 117‘

and the International Union. M .

There was a day here, under the Ma-
sons and McLean, when the name
“Mine-Mill” was practically unknown.
A phony slogan of “independence” and
“we can go it alone” had been sold
here which weakened the two locals and
was a constant threat tounity of ACM
wforkers. The campaign did much to
e lminate that old company-union feel-
ing. -

THE STEELWORKERS’ p h o n e y
claim that they had come to Montana
to “liberate” the workers from “Com-
munist domination” was blown sky high
in the heat of the campaign. There

weren’t a dozen workers who didn’t
know by voting time that the raiders’
red-baiting was merely a smokescreen

to cover their own, shabby record of

trade unionism. ~
Wage cuts in their Utah mines and
Smelters and in Pennsylvania plants
proved to be blows to the Steel raiders
from which they couldn’t recover in the
course of the campaign finale. The hated
sliding scale which the CIO Steelwork-
ers’ negotiated in Utah and elsewhere
has proved disastrous to the workers
since the prices of lead, zinc and other
metals have tumbled. ’ 4
Another blow to the raiders was the
factional fight inside CIO between
Steel President David McDonald and
CIO President Walter Reuther. Dope
stories in news magazines about the
disintegration of the CIO made hollow
sounds of the raiders’ boasts about “the
powerful CIO” support the miners and
smeltermen would get if they would
only vote for the Steelworkers’ union.

IT WAS Mine-Mill’s record in the
non-ferrous metals industry that the
workers finally chose. The contrast be-
tween what Mine-Mill had won in’ the
big chains like Kennecott, AS&R and
Phelps-Dodg'e——and in other sections of
the Anaconda chain—with the miser-
able bargaining record of the Steel
union was so clear that the final re-
sult was’ seldom in doubt. All of the
stalling of the raiders and the Mason
gang were to no avail. The Mason stew-
ardship was-judged and found wanting.

There were many highlights of the
campaign: Thelhigh school meeting in

Butte attended by 1,700 miners, the

march on the Miners Hall, the steady
gains’ of the A"naconda smeltermen
against the smear campaign of McLean
and Emmons, the always-crowded mem-
bership meetings in Butte and Ana-
conda, the mobilizations in front of the
mines and the smelter, the rebuilding
of the two local unions, the fight on
grievances in both places, and the as-
tounding revival of Mine-Mill’s pres-
tige in the space of three months.

The change will be easily seen when
the delegates to the forthcoming min-
ing, smelting and refining conference
will greet a new type of delegation
from Montana—men who have fought
hard for theirunion, men who have
fought the company, men who will -not
soon forget the bitter battle they have
won.

MAGNA, Utah——Min\e-Mill is going
to bat for painters working for Kenne-
cott at Arthur, Magna and Bingham
Canyon. Although the painters have.
seniority dating back to 1922-24, the

company is trying to force them to take * it 
— jobs on the track gang and do painting - i

for contractors after hours, Saturdays
and ‘Sundays. 
A Mine-Mill leaﬂet on the subjec
reports: _ . , '
“In a meeting with Mr. Pett, 3-9-54,
the Company’s cry was, ‘We are tired

of being in the RED in the Point I

A “Members of the Committee told the

‘Company it was nothing but poor

management on the Company’s part1
if they were in the RED. It was stated
if the various bosses would not have

On March 15, there were reviews‘ of A.
“Salt of the Earth” in every New York. -

reviews agreed on one point: this pic-._

rection, acting, photography and music.
Several expressed surprise that it had.
been so widely attacked as a f‘commu_-

€\There have been heavy layoffs in the farm equipment industry recently for lac|(_

of foreign markets.

Why we need trade  

THE "U. S. could sell far ‘more metals and-
metal-using goodsabroad than it is selling‘

now. The nation's foreign trade today is
down to a tiny fraction of what it might be.
Here's the picture: 9'

0 Our total output of goods—in dollars-
has -gone up 74 per cent since the end of

World ‘War II. '
‘ D’ But our total non-military exports last .

year were only 14 per cent higher than‘ in
1946. They were 15 per cent BELOW 1947,

I C and 9 per cent BELOW 1952.

» This picture gets steadily worse, not
better.

Foreign trade is particularly important
to noneferrous metal workers. Their jobs
depend on a high Volume of exports more
than the jobs of most of other U. S. workers.

This ‘is true even though we don't ship
much of our non-ferrous metals to other

countries-—‘-as metals. We don't directly ex-

port copper, lead or zinc. In fact, since 1939
we've regularly imported imore ores and
metals than. we've exported.

But we do ship manufactured goods that
use a lot of non-ferrous metals. That's why
export trade is so important to our non-fer-
rous metal workers.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has made .

several studies __to show how many jobs rely
on exports. ‘ A

In 1939, the Bureau found that 8.1 per
cent of workers in all industries depended on
exports for their jobs. In non-ferrous. met-
als, 14.4 per cent of all— workers depended on
exports for their jobs. \ V

In 1947,. 5.6 per cent. of workers in all
industries kept their jobs becauseof exports.
But this was still far below the share of non-,
ferrous jobs which would have been lost if
not for exports. In non-ferrous metals, 14.5
per cent of allpworkers were still depending

”In this fourth and last 4-page supple-
ment on’ "The Fight for Job Security.-"__
we try to answer these crucial questions.

on exports for their ability‘ to earn a. live-
lihood.

I Put another way, if the. U. S. suddenly.
cut off all exports, from 14 to 15 per cent of
all non-ferrous metal Workers would be out
of jobs.

THE U. S. has rarely exported more than
10 per cent of its total output. But the for-
eign sales of certain .products normally comes

;. to much more than that. This is especially

true for machinery and equipment of all kinds
——electrical and farm machinery, ‘special in-
dustrial machinery, transportation equipment,

. etc. These industries are among the heaviest

users of copper-,. lead and zinc. When they
can't sell in foreign markets, they stop buy-
ing metals here, and that means fewer jobs
for non-ferrous metalsworkers. "

 

 

. Why, ’then,'aren’t we selling more goods
abroad? 5 .

We can’t answer this question -unless we
admit we’re faced with a world-wide problem.

It has to». be tackled on a world-wide basis."

Two facts stand out from all the others:

.1. World‘ trade, especially among the older I

“trading countries” of Western Europe, is in
a pretty bad mess. 3‘ , _

2. About two—thirds of the world-—Vthe ‘fun-
derdeveloped” or economically backward coun-
tries——is too poor to buy the products of the
more industrialized nations. ‘

A look at Europe

Let’s look at Western Europe first. .

The trade crisis of Western Europe can be
seen in the so-called “dol1ar'gap.”. All during
World War II and since, we have sold more

 than we bought from other -_countries. The
' result has been’ that countries with_. which we

deal couldn’t earn enough dollars togbuy from
us what they needed. They have been “short”
of dollars to the extent of about _$5 billion a
year. ‘ . " ‘ ~

‘ How have they bridgedthe “dollar gap” to ,

pay for "the goods they bought from the..U. S. ?
A Up till now, the,U. S. has been giving them

1'  the money. Since 1946, we’ve given them, in

loans and gifts, $33 billion for economic re-

; covery._ We_’ve“handed them another $8.7‘ bil-
lion for military purchase, and promised an-

In ‘all, by June of this year, we will have given
‘these countries of» Western Europe a total of
$50.5 "billion, some of which will be repaid.

to" buy from-the U. S. -

Yet" all,’ of this hasn’t boosted our exports 1
\ enough to,/Inatter, Nor has it halted a steady 1

decline in_ world trade. - .

ern Europe will have to bring exports and"im-

L ports into: balance-. The longer this necessary‘

adjustment is put off, the harder it will be to

 , Europe aid stops

U. S. economic aid to Europe ‘has already‘

been almost entirely stopped.’ Military aid is
st_ill heavy, but has been tapering off. It is
no longer enough to ‘make up what they need
in dollars. ‘ ‘   . '
. .Last year, Western Europe did improve its
position in trade with the U. S. Their exports
to the U. S._.were greater than_their imports
from U. S.——if we don’t count, military exports
from U. S. Some officials have pointed to this
improvement as a sign that the tradejcrisis
is ending. ~ ,

mission on— foreign trade — the‘ Randall
tCommission—points out, however-—-“. . .
There is an element of illusion in the
present‘ apparent balanced position of our
trade (apart from military exports) in

._ that large ‘extraordinary’ dollar expendi-
tures are still being made by.the United
-States in other countries. . . .” I
The Commission said that when we total
military expenditures and economic aid there
is still “a concealed dollar gap of some $2 bil-
lion to $3 billion annually, which would be in-
creased if there were a change in the economic
situation, such. as a recession here or a de-

terioration in Western ,Europe’s terms of

trade.”

The Commission might have added that
last year’s seeming balance in trade was
achieved by other. countries’ reducing their
dollar imports. Th'at’s why U. S. exports last
year were $1 billion less than in 1952.

Western Europe has tried to balance its

trade through both cutting imports and in- .

creasing. exports. Neither effort has been too
successful.:  V - ’ V T 
. Reduction-. of imports has‘ brought low liv-
ing standards. to their people. ‘It has also
meant smaller markets for U. S. products.
Western Europe’s drive for increased ex-
ports has come up against strong obstacles.

They ‘did achieve a“ slight increase ‘in exports‘ A

to the U. S. in the last two years.’ - After that
increase, total exports were still below what

‘they were in the years 1925-1929. a Most of

this increase was due to, U. S. military ex-
penditures ip_ Europe. . Q 1 ' _
These expenditures by the U. S. actually
aggravate the problem. As‘ the Randall Com-
mission points out— - i _ A ' ,
“. . . it should be recognized that major
V parts of _our,,‘extraordinary" expenditures
abroad are connected with our: defense

effort, and that the Western European"

countries?’ own defense .9 programs affect
adversely -- their » trade position, by increas-

ing "resources that would‘.'other-wise be

. available for expanding their exports.”

‘one of the chief causes. of the present ‘non-

a major market for non-ferrous metals, has

now reduced. its imports. It is also selling metl ~

alson the U. S. market. This, as we know,
has brought shutdowns and”’unemp1oyment in

Europe’s failure to balance its trade in
postwar years is largely due to the restricted
nature of that trade. Before World War II,

  1 Demand for trade
i- This proposed “modification of the East-
’ .W_est embargo is in line with the growing
j trend of opinion _in the U. S. and elsewhere.
An ever larger number of leaders in govern-
ment, and business have comelout openly for
more trade with the Soviet bloc. A partial

sampling‘ of this opinion is /quoted elsewhere
 in this supplement. "

. _ This proposed modification of ‘U. S. policy
 _~ also recognizes the realities of the situation.

2.. . .._,Many "countries, out of economic ne<;essity,q
have already undertaken more trade with the '

Soviet bloc.

L: Newspapers have been reporting a Whole
3 flurry of recent trade negotiations between

 

. -the Soviet Union and Britain, France, Western -

I‘  Germany, India and many others." Churchill’s,
' gr-ecent dramatic" call for more trade with the
Soviet bloc came shortly after a public offer
 byfthe..Soviet Union to buy $1.12 billion worth
 p 1 of, goods from Great Britain in the next three
 . __year‘s.- .

Chairman of the Board of '

T Non-rennouis
 fit7_from ~.th'e renewal of East—West trade in .-

1. More jobs would be created through
direct exports from the United States
to the Soviet bloc. A whole line of
goods, filling the ordinaryuses of life
(appliances, household goods, agricul-
tural machinery, machinery for the
consumer goods industry)‘-—-all using
non-ferrous metals——could be sold in
these markets. '

Indirectly, greater use of non-ferrous
metals in goods sold by Western Euro-
pean countries would relieve the pres-

-sure on U.S. markets and would help
to work off some of the present world
surpluses.

.Earnings of Western Europe in trade
with the East would better enable them
"to buy from the U. S. The U. S. would
' still be the main source for much of
Western Europe’s goods.

There is no way to figure exactly how much
trade we could. develop with the Soviet bloc
now how much this would mean to n.on-ferrous

_ workers.  .
We do know that opening“of_'these mar- .

kets would give world trade a réalishot in the

arm. It wouldvalso step up employment in the «

non-ferrous metals industry-  

Rough estimates worked 'up;__by: . Mine-Mi1l’s
Research-Department in 1951“ show that—

“If the United States were to resume, trad-

ing with ‘the Soviet Bloc _, -at exactly the-

same dollars per capita rate as. our trade
with these countries‘ in .1946, the result-
ing increase in exports would provide jobs
for ’roughly 7,000 copper, brass, lead and
zinc workers in mines, smelters, refiner-
ies and fabricating plants. , ' ‘

‘V‘Ifl exports to the Soviet Bloc were stepped

; up to the rate of our per capita trade with

the rest of the world in 1946, the number
of new . jobs created for Workers in Mine-
Mill’s jurisdiction would come to about
25,000.” (“A World At Peace,” p. 52.)

The increase in exports andin jobs could,
of,“ course, go. beyond these figures. '

  The large metal companies attempt to just-

they are bringing’the benefits‘ of A civilization\

to the backward; areas of the ‘world.’ They tell

have adequate defenses in‘ case of a war. The  €92
U. S. government has adopted this position as
It backs ._up these companies ~

with loans, subsidies and active support in
their dealings with other countries.

Behind all this sweet talk is the fact of
fabulous profits. Newmont Mining, for ex-
ample, after three years operation of its
Tsumeb mine in South Africa, recovered its

original investment ‘ of $6 million and. made ’
additional net profits. of $20 million (after —.

taxes). Their “patriotism and humanitarian-
ism” carry a high price tag. '

The overall poverty of these underdevel-
oped countries "makes them poor markets for
our products. ‘

What these countries. produce is siphoned . 

off in the form of extra large profits by 
and other foreign companies. These profits
are based on the extra-low wages paid.

The trade imposed on underdeveloped coun- '_  

tries by. these conditions has always been ex.-
tremely lopsided. They export their natural

tries. , A - '

Control of foreign operations also enables f. .3
U.» S. companies "to play off foreign mines _ ,-

against U. S. mines. When. stocks pile up and

_markets are declining, they shut down, high‘ 1 

, cost U. S.,. mines, but continue to make profitsg ﬂ7“f:‘~;

low wages of the African and South American 7.

miners cause U. S:

ideas of their own:

,1. They want to own more of their own  ;i._l—A.'5fi:5

resources.

(2. They want_ more outside ‘capital,

  local resolution ur9°s
Q support of Jencks defense

LOS ANGELES-—Th2's resolutz'on was adopted by Western‘ Me-

chanics Local 700 in convention:

Brother Jencks is one of many trade
union leaders who has been persecuted
because he dared give fearless and
,honest leadership ta w'orkers locked in
struggle with the bosses.

, Every person who testified against
Jencks wereproven liars by the official
records of our Union and their own
 testimony. Yet, in the face of all this, a

 H , jury found him guilty in just-23'1nin-
 '   lites, which can only mean that the ver-
Adict was cut and dried even before the

’ "trial started. ‘ '  ' »

 ‘Now starts the slow Ptocess of at-
‘  . tempting a new trial and if thatfails,
C i’ the case must be taken to the" U. S.
Court of Appeals at New Orleans‘ and
‘maybe finally- to~the U. S. Supreme
Court in order to free Brother Jencks

from this frame—up sentence of 5 years

in jail. : ‘ “ ..

_ DENVER, Colo.—A special report on
the trial of ‘Brother Clint J encks, mailed
to_ 4,000‘ Mine-Mill leaderslarid other
leaders in the United States" and
Canada asks: “Was there any basis for
the indictment, arrest and conviction of

it i this man beyond .a McCarthyite attack ‘

on the International” Union of Mine,
 Mill and Smelter Workers?”

The report, “sent to‘ all affiliated lo-
cals, went out in time to lay a basis
for discussion of the Jencksicase at
“the bargaining conferences thisiweek.

To the Editor:

Anti-comm.unism has become an‘in- ‘

dustry in itself. Fortunes and political
names are made out of it by such. poli-
ticians as Senators McCa-rthy and.Mc-
carran. A comparatively unknown, but

ambitious politician can ‘become a lead- _,

ing national figure overnight, if he is
elected to an _“un—American activities

committee.” For he will then be able ‘

to make ‘his-name solely by" exposing
communist suspects under the glare of
the commercial television cameras.

»I cannot understand, "nor. can I con-A
done,~the way in which these commit-
tees go about combating the supposed

influence ofcommunism in‘ our internal.

/

affairs. '

It is not simply a matter of convict- «
ingT communists who are guilty of 
crimes punishable by law’-——but’ a ques- j’
tion of exposing, disgracingland per-‘

haps even banishingall those against
whom any accusation, however untrue,
can be made with conviction. '

SUSPICION is thrown on persons for A
V ‘ the slightest "reasons: .having__ a friend
or acquaintance who had "been a ,com--.

munist; being seen talking to a"—com-
,munist,_.even if you? were just discuss-

or praising Russia forifthevaliant parti

be‘ reaped from exposing communists
and afellow-travelers, you cannot afford
to’ run out of people to expose.” So we

see thatthe fear of corriniunism has.
been exploited to get gain -and even 4

political scores. r _

Comme mesures

Conseil Canadien de Mine-Mill propose
que les bénéficesi"'d’assurance-chomage

pose a la hausse des tarifs qui empe-

VANCOUVER, B. C. Mine-Mill
has made a further breach in the
aluminum curtain surrounding the
Alcan plant at Kitimat by estab-

lishment of an office there with
Int’l Rep. , Allan McNabb in
charge. I ' i A
. Asireported in the last issue of
THE UNION, the Canadian Pa-
~ 5’cific Steamship had lifted re-
‘striations on the sale of tickets to
Kitimat with Alc/an’s authority to

breaking Steel strike

VANCOUVER, B. C.—In a half-page
advertisement published presumably in
papers right across Canada since Van'-
couver, where the mine has no inter-
ests, was also included-, Noranda Mines
Ltd. enthuses and gloats over the de-

feat of Steel in the seven months strike
at Noranda, Quebec: '

The company stresses that the strike
was entirely over the checkoff, as far
as the brass of Steel was concerned,
and that after months of struggle and
»privation on the part of the rank and

- file, it was settled on the same terms.

presented before the strike, and of-
fered again on December 22, last year,
but rejected by the Steel executive.
The resentment of any honest trade
unionist is aroused less by the exultant

I ' boasting of Noranda Mines over break-

  - ,,M§pr§h‘ 2f9{19s4 

. ing a strike, since it's hard to keep a
dog from barking, than by the stupidity
and -greed of a trade union ‘leadership
which, in order to keep the cash regis-
ter jingling for overpaid officials, reck-
lessly embarks.on. a course without re-
gard for the desires of the rank-and-‘
file which makes it possible for a boss
to emit such chortlesiof joy over an be-
trayed union membership.

New local union at Cdssiar]  iAFL raidfailsg

  wins two mojori-grievances  

CASSIAR, B. C.—Loca1 927, Cassiar
Mine, Mill and Allied Workers,
IUMMSW, was certified March 16 as
the bargaining agency at Cassiar As-
bestos Corporation Ltd. - ‘ -

The camp is situated just below the
B. C.-‘Yukon border, 180 miles from
the Yukon town of Watson Lake, and
produces a high-grade asbestos. Presi-
dent of the new local is Pete Ward, and
the financial secretary Pete Thomson.

The camp grievance committee under.

the chairmanship of Brother Ward has
been active. Amongst the achievements
of the committee has been the chang-
ing of company policy on transporta-
tion of workers between Cassiar and

EC. locals vote   for '
c higher district percnp

VANCOUVER, ‘B. C.——District per
capita has been raised ten cents per
member per month, it‘ has beenlpretty
definitely established as referendum
returns from the locals near completion.

‘Proposed before the last four district
conventions:by Alice Arm Local 906,

the resolution on more per capita was .

consistently turned down by the dele-
gates, with the support of the District,

until this year, when itwas -passed and 1'

sent out in a referendum.

Not less _than three sub-locals voted
100 per cent of their membership on
the issue, with ballots unanimous for
the increase. This keen interest in union
business was evinced at the Nichols
Chemical at Barnett, the Falkland
Quarry Unit at Falkland, and the Port
Haney ‘Brick Unit of Local 289 at Port

transported) in open ‘truck; now a bus. is

beingused which makes regular trips "

threetimes a week. 
Shortly before the workers gained-
recognition of their Union, the company

had posted a notice to the effect that _

any “undesirable” would be escorted to
the edge of the Company property and
there left on his own toimake his way
to the nearest point, Watson Lake. This
practice was invoked in temperatures
lower than 40 below zero (note~photo-
stat of letter below). After a deter-
mined stand by the grievance commit-,«'
tee along with the backing of -the mem-
bership, this policy was stopped and
the sign taken down. ,
