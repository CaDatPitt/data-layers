COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

Negro question adopted at the meeting of the National Committee
of the Communist Party of the U.S.A., December 3-5, 1946, which
was based on the report made on this question by Comrade
Benjamin J. Davis, and a number of the speeches which were made
in the course of this discussion. The resolution, which should be
carefully studied, reaﬂirms the basic Marxist characterization of
the Negro question in the United States as a national question. At
the same time it drastically corrects the sectarian and schematic
use during the 30’s of the Marxist concept of self-determination and
strikes a body blow to any revisionist and bourgeois liberal approach
to the Negro question that may still persist in Communist ranks.

Every Communist must master the theoretical principles that
underly this resolution and translate its supremely important
national and international signiﬁcance to the American people in
the struggle against Wall Street’s drive for imperialist world domina-
tion. For as Marx says, “theory becomes a material force as soon as
it has gripped the masses.”

Once the. Communists understand the far-reaching importance
of this resolution and its fundamental slogan of self-determination
it will become a real impetus to develop the united front among the
Negro people, and to the present day struggles for the defense of the
Negro people, for their immediate demands, for full economic,
political and social equality for the Negro people. The resolution
can become an invaluable guide in the bold and uncompromising
ﬁght against white chauvinism—no matter in what subtle or other
form it may appear or hide itself.

The resolution can become a great lever for stimulating the
immediate day to day struggles and the whole Negro liberation
movement in the deep South. The Communists will win the masses
of Southern white workers in the common struggle if they cease-
lessly hammer away at the fundamental truth—-that there is no other
road to progress for the impoverished whites, for the labor move-
ment and the South as a whole, except as the white workers in their
own interests, step forward and join the struggle against Jim Crow
and national oppression and for the right of the Negro majority in
the Black Belt freely to determine its own ultimate destiny.

The resolution will serve as an important weapon for all Com-
munists in the United States, Negro and white, to advance the libera-
tion movement of the Negro people—that powerful and indispensable
ally of the working class—in the historic struggles that lie ahead, for
democracy and socialism in the United States.

On the Question o f   N egro
Rig/its mm’ Se/f-Deiermimztion

ADOPTED AT THE PLENARY MEETING
OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE,
C.P.U.S.A., DECEMBER 3-5, 1946.

T HE present drive of reaction against the Negro people is an
attack upon the living standards and democratic rights of all the
American people. It is an effort to halt the vital upsurge now taking
place among the Negro people, to stop the growth of Negro and
white labor and progressive unity, and to split asunder all progressive
alliances and groupings.

Defense of Negro rights has become an imperative and inescap-
able task of the American labor-progressive coalition in the struggle
against reaction and the threat of fascism. Such a coalition must be
based solidly upon alliance with the Negro people.

North and South, the Negro people are attaining a new high level
of ﬁghting unity in defense of their rights and of gains won during
the recent period. Their organizations, which are being strength-
ened and extended, are ﬁghting for those democratic rights here at
home which were proclaimed as our nation’s war objectives abroad.

In sharp contrast with the situation following the First V/Vorld
War, masses of Negro workers are now actively participating in the
trade unions. In the major wage struggles and strike movements
since the end of the war, the employers have not been able to divide
the workers on the “race issue.” A growing conﬁdence in the labor
movement exists among the Negro workers, while the white workers
realize better than previously the role of race and national prejudices
in dividing their ranks.

‘II % =I=

A new wave of the struggle for democracy is arising in the South.
In their courageous resistance to lynch terror, the Negro people are
playing a leading role in the ﬁght for democracy. For the ﬁrst time
since Reconstruction (1865-1877) and since the Populist movement
of the 1890's, important sections of the white masses of the South
are beginning to ally themselves on a signiﬁcant scale with the Negro

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

"people in their common struggle against the trusts, and against the

Bilbos, Rankins and Talmadges.

Irrespective of its immediate objectives, this struggle is directed
at the semifeudal sharecropping-plantation system of the South,
the source of the most brutal forms of Negro oppression. The share-
cropping system, descended from slavery, perpetuates conditions
which are essentially semifeudal. This system is a cesspool of reaction
which poisons American political and economic life. The Nazi—like
doctrines and practices of lily—white superiority, the main stock-in-
trade of the Southern Bourbons, constantly inspire fascist groups
and tendencies all over the country. The relation of Southern semi-
feudalism with the northern big trusts promotes the drive of the
monopolies towards full-scale reaction, towards fascism.

=)(= =K= =X=

Just as the Truman Administration receded from and ﬁnally
betrayed the Roosevelt program in practically every ﬁeld, it failed
to resist the reactionary drive upon the Negro people. Federal
F.E.P.C., anti—lynching and anti—poll tax legislation, action against
anti-Negro terrorism, uprooting of the K.K.K. and similar fascist
organizations and other pressing tasks went by the board entirely.
In the recent elections the Republicans capitalized on these failures,
and are now seeking the Negro vote for 1948.

Dependence upon the NAM and pro~fascist Republicans, no
less than upon the reactionary leadership of the Democratic Party,
can only prove disastrous to the Negro people. Only the most deter-
mined resistance by a coalition of labor, the poor farmers, the Negro
people and all other progressives can prevent the 80th Congress
from passing further oppressive legislation.

Only such a democratic coalition can wrest concessions from a
Congress composed almost entirely of reactionary Republicans and
Bourbon Democrats. It can do this by rallying labor and the people
to a program of equal rights legislation, abolition of Jim Crow in
the Army, adherence to the Supreme Court decision outlawing the
white primary, establishing housing on a non—discriminatory basis,
and securing Federal action against the inciters of race hatred.

Such a democratic coalition can rally all the progressive and
independent political forces in the country to defeat reaction in 1948.

=X= ilk =l=

A principal task of all labor and progressive forces throughout
the country is the struggle against reaction in the South. This is a

10

 

 

   

RESOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE

key to breaking the power of the Bourbon Democrats, now allied
with the reactionary Republicans. ,

The main obstacle to the progressive modernization of the South
is the sharecropping-plantation system which keeps millions of
Negroes in semi-serfdom and which also affects millions of poor
white farmers. Basic land reform in the South is thus essential to
the defeat of reaction in the country as a whole, to overcoming the
backward and distressed conditions of the South, and to the nation-
wide struggle for Negro rights. Hand in hand with the struggle for
the vote and the right of Negroes to hold office, the struggle against
Southern landlordism will rally the Negro and white sharecroppers
and poor farmers to a broad labor-progressive coalition of all anti-
fascist Americans.

just as the coming economic crisis threatens to depopulate the
factories, especially of Negro workers, it will also render hundreds
of thousands of Negro farm families homeless and jobless. To anti-
cipate this catastrophe and prepare against it, Negro and white
sharecroppers and agricultural workers should be organized into
unions alongside the industrial unions now spreading in the South.

IX! =)(= =)(=

As always, the Communist Party stands ﬁrmly in the forefront of
the struggle for full economic, social and political equality for the
Negro people.

In ﬁghting for their equal rights, the Negro people are becom-
ing more uniﬁed as a people. Their ﬁght for liberation from oppres-
sion in the Black Belt—the area of Negro majority population—is a
struggle for full nationhood, for their rightful position of full
equality as a nation. In recognizing the struggle for equal rights in
the South as a movement towards full nationhood, the Communist
Party supplies new power to the Negro liberation movement and
also advances the perspective of full freedom for the Negro people.
This understanding, growing out of a constant ﬁght for Negro
rights, strengthens white and Negro solidarity, based ﬁrmly on work-
ing class unity, and provides the program of permanent alliance
between the Negro and white masses.

_Today, the struggle for Negro liberation is concerned with gain-
ing equal rights throughout the country, which includes in the
South the struggle for attaining representative government and
land reform. As our own history shows (Reconstruction) the devel-
opment towards full and equal Negro participation in State and
Federal government also moves in the direction of various forms

11

 

K . V _ ix ~,,,..,_.,..a........._.. -..,--. ..  -. .

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

of self-government by the Negro people, together with their white
allies, in the Black Belt areas where they are in the majority.

This movement provides the basis for the full realization of
Negro nationhood, whether it be achieved under capitalism or
socialism. The Communist Party supports the right of self—deter-
mination for the Negro people, that is, their right to realize self-
government in the Negro majority area in the South. Only on this
basis will the relation of the Negro people to the State and Federal
governments be determined on the basis of freedom.

The Communist Party does not attempt to impose any speciﬁc
solution in advance of the form in which the right of self-determina-
tion will be exercised; nor does it prematurely raise self-determina-
tion as an immediate slogan of action. The future solution of this
question must arise from the living movement itself, out of the
current and future struggles for democracy and equal rights. Its
form will be determined by the relationship of social forces in the
country as a whole and by the relation of the Negro people to the
progressive coalition.

=l= II‘ it

A ﬁrm alliance of labor and the progressive forces generally with
the Negro people is required by the present struggle against reaction.
This alliance demands, in the ﬁrst place, a constant ﬁght to eradicate
the doctrines and practices of white chauvinism in all their forms,
among all sections of the population, and especially whenever they
manifest themselves in the labor and progressive movement.

In the trade unions, even in some of the most progressive, dis-
crimination against Negro workers still persists. As in the past, the
Communists insist upon the fullest participation of Negro workers
in the unions on an equal footing, including in positions of top
leadership. The unions cannot successfully combat the divisive
tactics of the employers without fully recognizing and ﬁghting
against the present unequal position of the Negro workers in in-
dustry. This requires that the militant trade unionists raise the
special demands of the Negro workers, such as seniority readjust-
ments as well as other provisions, to permit equal opportunity for
advancement and to protect the Negro from being the last to be
hired and the ﬁrst to be ﬁred.

Especially as it inﬂuences the labor and progressive movement,
white chauvinism feeds separatist tendencies and distrust of white
workers among the Negro people. Therefore, the encouragement
of every movement among the Negro people toward greater integra-

12

 

RESOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE

tion with their white allies, requires a simultaneous struggle against
white chauvinism, especially whenever it shows itself within the
labor and progressive movement.

By its own actions, the Communist Party must set an example
before the whole labor movement. Every inﬂuence of white chauvin-
ism within its ranks, whether it manifests itself openly or in con-
cealed form, must be systematically combatted and expunged. It
is the over-riding responsibility of white Communists to ﬁght white
chauvinism relentlessly.

Negro Communists should systematically combat separatist tend-
encies and distrust of white workers among the Negro people, while
building working class unity and alliance with other nationality
groups also suffering from discrimination, such as the foreign born,
the Jewish people and Catholics.

Towards this end, the Communist Party will develop constant
educational ‘work within its own ranks, as well as on a broader
scale. As part of its constant ﬁght for Negro rights, it will strive to
uproot false theories and ban race prejudice from the labor and pro-
gressive movement. This is imperative for welding ﬁrmly the alliance
of the labor and progressive movement with the Negro people in the
common struggle against reaction and the threat of fascism.

remarks of

/727/zkzm Z. Foster

NATIONAL CHAIRMAN, COMMUNIST PARTY, USA.

I DID not expect to speak in this discussion but inasmuch as an
announcement was made that I was to speak I will say a few
words extemporaneously.

One thing that must strike all of us here is the high level of this
discussion on the question of self-determination. I have participated
in many discussions in our Party, but I do not recall any that was
on a higher theoretical plane than this. Such a discussion, it is hardly
necessary for me to add, could not have taken place under the
Browder regime. Then we would have had a ukase from above and
God help him who challenged it. Now, however, we have had a
free, open and comradely discussion. It has been such that it will
cause us all to leave this meeting with a better understanding and
a greater unity in the Party on this question than we have ever had.

Some of the comrades who have spoken against the resolution
would probably not make the same speech now if they were to speak
again. The discussion goes to show that Comrade Davis’ report and
the resolution before us have stood up.

What have we been saying in this discussion? We have been re-
examining the whole theoretical basis of our approach to the Negro
question, not simply the application of the self-determination slogan.
During the course of this discussion, we have clearly established
three or four fundamental propositions regarding the mooted ques-
tion of self-determination in the Black Belt of the South.

First, that the Negro people in the Black Belt are a nation, that
they possess the essential qualities of nationhood, as elaborated in
the works of that great expert on the national question, Stalin. This
lays a ﬁrm basis for the self-determination slogan. So I will not deal
further with this basic matter of whether or not the Negroes in the
Black Belt are a nation.

Secondly, we have made an important contribution in answering
a question that has puzzled our comrades for the past twenty years,
namely,.why, if the Negro people are a nation, don’t they put forth

14

 

 

WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

the slogan of self-determination. Fundamentally, the reason is that
they are essentially a young nation, a developing nation. A nation
has to be at a certain stage of political growth before it advances the
demand for self-determination. As a number of comrades have
pointed out, all over the world there are to be found peoples who
do not advance the slogan of self-determination. We have had one
illustration from India. I might add further that there are some 18
distinct peoples in India, with very few of them advancing the
slogan of self-determination. Nevertheless, the Communist Party
of India does advance this slogan in their name.

Nations are a matter of growth, of course. Our own nation took
some 150 years at least before it had developed a real national con-
sciousness, until it advanced the slogan of self-determination, back-
ing it up to the point of separation from Great Britain. Of course,
the Negro people in the United States are developing under far more
complicated and ‘diﬂicult circumstances than did the 13 American
colonies.

It has been pointed out in this general connection (and I think
this throws much light on the question) that some of the nations of
India are advancing their self-determination slogan under the guise
of religion. It is also true that in certain circumstances national
slogans are put out by other peoples in primitive or in distorted

forms, for example, as racial slogans. One of the characteristics of the

American Negro people has been that they, too, have put out what
are basically national slogans very largely in a racial sense. Hence we
have to look more closely than we have in the past at these racial
slogans and at the conceptions the Negro people have with regard to
race and racial oppression. Behind these prevalent concepts of race
are actually developing national concepts. I think the discussion has
proved that it is no decisive sign that a people does not constitute a
nation if it does not advance clear-cut slogans for self-determination.

Thirdly, our discussion has shed considerable light on another
very elementary matter, bearing directly upon the central question
of whether or not the Negro people in the Black Belt are a nation,
and on the slogan of self—determination. Some comrades in the
discussion have said that the Negro people are not only not now a
nation but also that they are not moving in the direction of becoming
a nation. To help clear up this matter we have pretty clearly shown
in our discussion what the orientation, or general course of develop-
ment of the Negro people, really is. This orientation is developing
along two general lines:

First, the Negro people most distinctly feel themselves to be

-.15

 

 

 

-L

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

Americans in the fullest sense of the word and they are ﬁghting
resolutely for full participation in all phases of American life on the
basis of complete economic, political and social equality. The second
main trend in the orientation of the Negro people is to unify their
own ranks on a national basis and to develop more and more sys-
tematically a deﬁnite national consciousness. One of the most im-
portant developments in this respect has to do with the change that
has already been noted by some comrades, namely, that the Negro
people no longer speak of themselves so much as a race, but rather
as a people. When the Negro people begin to designate themselves
as a people rather than as a race, they are already taking a long stride
in the direction of national consciousness.

There are many other signs, of course, of the developing national
consciousness of the American Negro people. They are building up
many movements that are deﬁnitely of a national liberation char-
acter. They are also closely identifying themselves with the national
liberation struggles of colonial peoples all over the world. They feel
a kinship with these movements. Very signiﬁcant in this general
respect was the demand made by the National Negro Congress to
the United Nations to take up the grievances of the Negro people
in this country. This demand, I understand, was very favorably
received by the Negro masses and intellectuals. Such an act was
essentially that of a nation appealing over the head of the American
government to the peoples of the world for justice, much as almost
any other colonial or oppressed nation might do.

Let me sum up on this general point: that is, the orientation of
the Negro people is ﬁrst, toward full participation and full equality
in American life, and second, toward the development of their
national consciousness. Comrade Ed Strong made a good contribu-
tion when he stressed the basic harmony between these two streams
of courses of development. One of the major diﬂiculties we have had
to contend with has been a tendency of our opponents to pose one
of these currents to the other, thus making it appear that the
demand for self-determination slogans is in contradiction to the
proposition that Negroes ﬁght for the fullest rights as Americans.
Comrade Strong knocked this nonsense on the head when he pointed
out so forcefully that it is impossible for the Negro people to achieve
their full economic, political, and social equality as Americans

unless they organize as a nation, unless they forward the slogan of
self-determination for the Black Belt of the South.
The foregoing three major points in our discussion, relating to
the reaﬂirrnation of the basis of Negro nationhood, the clariﬁcation

16

 

WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

of the question of the Negro people not putting forward the self-
determination slogan, and the analysis of the orientation of the
Negro people, lay a solid basis for our theoretical development and
use of the slogan of self-determination. From which we may con-
clude that the soundness of our Negro resolution has been proved
and its adoption by our National Committee justiﬁed.

Even with these things said, we have, however, by no means
exhausted the matter. There are numerous aspects of this general
problem to which we have to pay more attention in the immediate
future than we have done in this discussion. First, there is the ques-
tion of the whole concept and role of race, which I have already
alluded to. In past years the tendency in the Party was to brush this
entire matter of race aside, on the assumption that it was some sort
of distortion that had no signiﬁcance except as an obstacle to the
Negro people's acquiring a national consciousness. But the question
cannot be evaded so easily. I am sure that if you ask the Negro
people on what grounds they are oppressed, 99 out of 100 will give
you a “racial” answer, in spite of the fact, as I have indicated, that
they are beginning to develop, more and more, a national conscious-
ness.

We know, of course, that science has shattered the “race theory.”
Nevertheless the term “race,” loosely used, has served as a powerful
instrument in the hands of the bourgeoisie for the oppression of the
Negro people, and we have got to trace much more carefully than
we have in the past this relation of the concept of race to the whole
question of the brutal oppression of the Negro people.

Secondly, there was another point that was not very well devel-
oped in our discussion, and it is one to which we also have to pay
much more attention if we are to grasp the essence of this complex
question and to make headway. I refer to the relation of the national
minority of Negroes in the North to the main body of the Negro
nation in the South. The connection between these two sections of
the Negro people is a very close and a very vital one. We must pay
very close attention to the material inter-relationships of one with
the other, not the least because the leadership of the Negro people
as a whole is developing chieﬂy among the national minority in the
North. This is not to ignore the very striking new development that
the Negro people in the South are courageously beginning to develop
real leadership right in the heart of the Black Belt itself.

Another important question we shall have to study much more
than we have done in this session is the concrete relations of the
Negro nation to the American nation as a whole. In the past, when

17

 

 

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

we ﬁrst developed the self—determination slogan, we also brushed
this question aside very cavalierly. There was a tendency to plump
for a Negro Republic. But the situation is much more complicated
than that. Talk of an American Negro Republic has no foundation
in present—day reality. The relation of two or more peoples to each
other within broader states is an extremely complicated one and
assumes many forms in different nations. We have to become very
familiar with these forms, especially as we begin to popularize the
slogan of self-determination among the Negro people. I, for one,
have no doubt that before very long, when we ﬁnd the way of
advancing the slogan more skillfully, the Negro people will begin
to accept it. Especially I felt this when I listened to our brilliant
young Negro Marxists discuss this question at this National Com-
mittee meeting.

The last point I want to touch upon is the practical use of the
self—determination slogan in the national liberation struggle of the
Negro people. We did not deal with this practical question suﬂi-
ciently in our discussion. What we have done mostly has been to
establish the validity of the slogan. The practical use we are going
to make of the slogan in the struggle is going to take much more
study than we have given it here. There are two things I am sure of:
ﬁrst, that this slogan is not going to be put on the shelf as one com-
rade indicated; and second, that we are not going to go to the
sectarian extreme of using it to propagandize for the setting up of
a Negro Republic. We have got to ﬁnd the proper methods of using
this slogan. In my opinion, our use of it will be pretty much in an
educational sense in the beginning. But experience will teach us in
this matter. Slogans are often two-edged swords. They can do great
harm if wrongly applied, and this slogan can only be of value to us
if we use it properly.

Now, comrades, this is all I have to say on the question of self-
determination. In this meeting, although we have not discussed all
phases of the question, we have certainly discussed the fundamental
ones. This is very important. In my opinion we have established a
correct and basic attitude toward the general question during the
course of the discussion. We should, therefore, on the basis of our
discussion, endorse Comrade Ben Davis’ report and our draft
resolution.

 

 

summary remarks of

Beizjdmzkz  Dams, fr.

MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL BOARD, C.P.U.S.A.
COUNCILMAN OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK

THINK it would be somewhat anti-climactic to review all the

points developed in the course of the discussion. The remarks
of Comrade Foster practically eliminate the need for a summary.
I would like, however, to make a few brief observations.

I think that this is the most important political discussion in our
Party since the July, 1945, convention. It is the highlight of our
Plenum, and, I am certain, contributed to the political understand-
ing of all of us. Its importance rests in the fact that the Negro ques-
tion, the question of the Negro people as an oppressed nation, of
their national liberation, is in the center of all the problems today
facing the American working class and its allies. It is also in the center
of all questions in respect to the ﬁnal, socialist emancipation of the
American working class.

The report which I made was the basis of perhaps the richest
political discussion I have ever experienced; it was deepened con-
siderably by the contributions of all of the comrades. All of us have,
I am sure, a certain inner glow of pride in being a Communist, and
especially because of the tremendous contributions made in the dis-
cussion by younger Negro comrades—Comrades Jackson, Strong,_
Berry, and others. The fact that these three comrades are veterans
should impress something else on our minds, namely, that the almost
one million Negro Veterans who have come back are going to go a
long way in developing further the sense of internationalism of the
whole Negro people. I also think that the contributions of other com-
rades—Comrades Bittelman, Weiss, and A1len—certainly were out-
standing in the discussion. I believe that some of the comrades who
spoke would probably make a somewhat different report or remarks
if they spoke now. But they also contributed to the discussion be-
cause they have shown that in many respects we have not said every-
thing that there is to be said on some of the questions raised. As
Comrade Foster pointed out, there are still questions to be studied
and worked out and related more intimately to the actual trends and

19

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

developments which are taking place among the Negro people gen-
erally.

It is my opinion that the adoption of this resolution, the position
which it maintains, and the report which is based upon it, is going
to mark the formal and ﬁnal defeat of the remnants of Browder’s
revisionism and bourgeois liberalism on the Negro question—a ques-
tion in which revisionism did so much damage to our Party’s work
among the Negro people, and also to our Party’s work generally.

As has been pointed out, it is interesting to note how democratic
has been the discussion which has taken place on the right to self-
determination. No such full and open discussion on this question,
or on any other question, took place during the period when Brow-
der was the General Secretary of our Party.

But we have had a year of discussion, with all of its imperfections,
and the opportunity during this discussion to draw upon the rich
creativeness of our Party comrades, a very important feature of the
action that I am conﬁdent we will take on the resolution.

It is my belief that the National Committee here tonight is in a
position to settle this question in so far as the basic approach of our
Party is concerned. The discussion we have had for the last year, the
reports and documents circulated at least to our Party leadership in
the states and districts, the document sent out by the Negro Commis-
sion, the series of articles in Political A ﬁairs, and the discussion on
the report and the resolution at this Plenum, fully equip us to make
a decision on this question now. We must so act now, in my opinion,
because in the present period, which is going to become more critical
as sharp class battles develop, we cannot continue to work without a
Marxist-Leninist perspective on this question, for this affects the
form and content of our work. It is the basis for the formulation of
our program for the Negro people on the day-to-day issues. In order
to formulate this program we must know where we are going, what
slogans and demands correspond to the level of the work at any given
moment. All our Negro work has suffered in the past period, not-
withstanding certain progress which we have made, because we did
not have a ﬁrm grasp of the Marxist-Leninist compass provided by
the resolution which is presented here tonight for your action.

I think that the position taken in the resolution is a sound posi-
tion, which, when it is properly mastered and fought for within the
ranks of our Party and carried to the masses of the Negro people and
the white workers, will be accepted by them.

As I see it, the main arguments made here in opposition to it
have not been sound. The discussion has demonstrated that, and I do

 

 

 

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, JR.

not propose to go into them because I think they have been well
answered by many of the comrades who have spoken on the question.

The position on self-determination as put forward in the reso-
lution avoids two main dangers. First, it does not state, in a sectarian
manner, as we did in the past, what the form and the exact manner
would be in which this self-determination would be realized or exer-
cised. This sectarian position or attitude or approach to self-deter-
mination is adequately and correctly avoided in the resolution before
you.

Secondly, I think that the resolution avoids tailing after events,
after history, as some comrades place it, and does not leave every-
thing to take care of itself in the future, which in my opinion was
the main Right danger developed in the discussion by those com-
rades who were opposed to the adoption of the slogan.

It should also be added that this resolution shows the basic rela-
tionship of self—determination, that is, the concept of the Negro ques-
tion as a national question, to all of the current struggles for Negro
rights as we face them today.

I think there is something new in the resolution, in the approach
which has been argued for by those comrades who support it. That
something new is the formulation of this position on the basis of
what is taking place in the struggles of the Negro people, and the
trends among them, the objective conditions, the actual status of the
Negro people, the facts of life existing outside us. That approach is
deﬁnitely reﬂected in the resolution, and that was the approach of
the report. It offers a basis, not only for a correct theoretical position
with regard to the Negro question but also, in my opinion, a correct
approach and theoretical stand with regard to all questions on which
we have formulated basic policy and fundamental positions.

It is interesting to note that in the opposing arguments that have
been raised, the question of the land, the guarantees that the Negro
people will acquire the land rightfully theirs, and the highest form
of those guarantees, of self-government, were questions which were
not answered, with no adequate substitute offered, with no alterna-
tive presented which was realizable, which could offer to the Negro
people a real guarantee that they will be able to determine their
destiny and own the land which constitutes the heart and seat of
their nationhood.

I also believe that some of the positions argued for certainly tend
in the direction of the Social-Democratic position, that is, the view
of the Negro question in this country as a narrow class question. The
resolution correctly rejects any such position, and I think the discus-

21

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

.' If sion shows that there must be a ﬁght for correct thinking on the

Negro question as a national question and not just as a narrow class
question.

I think, further, that the resolution will be one of the heaviest
blows against white chauvinism delivered by our Party since our
July, 1945, convention, prior to which time, because of Browder-
ism, white chauvinism developed and was not sufficiently combatted,
and our Party lost much of its sensitivity on this question.

As to many questions and doubts which have been expressed that
the slogan of self-determination will be harmful to Negro and white
unity, I think these are doubtings due to the fear of really tackling
the white workers, showing them their common interests with the
Negro workers, and of supporting this slogan in the South. I feel that
it will help us to cleanse our own ranks mercilessly of white chauvi-
nism which manifests itself in so many different ways—the question

V;  of mobilizing our Party as a whole and the white workers as a whole-

in struggles for Negro rights; the question of promoting Negro lead-

 ership, in line with the example set by our National Committee at
i its last session with the election of Comrade Winston as Administra-

tive Secretary of the Party; and the question of fraternal and social
relations among our Negro and white comrades, of actually making
our Negro comrades feel much more at home in our Party.

The resolution will also help us in revitalizing the Marxist posi-
tion of our Party that the white comrades take the initiative on all
questions relating to white chauvinism, to education on questions of
struggles, in public discussions, writings, and in actual leadership
1 of day-to~day work. This will immeasurably strengthen the ﬁght of
 our Negro comrades against Negro nationalism.
‘ As we apply in practice this resolution on self-determination, one
of the results will be certain immediate applications with respect to

_  the ﬁght for Negro rights. I think, for example, that we have not

grasped sufﬁciently the epochal symbol of the struggle of the Negro
people in the South, in Mississippi in particular, in the “Oust Bilbo”
movement. We should realize that this “Oust Bilbo” movement rep-
resents a tremendous lever for further developing the national con-
sciousness of the Negro people, for characterizing it and accelerating
it as a real national liberation struggle of the Negro people.

The heroism being shown by the Negroes in the rendering of

i" A  testimony against Bilbo has not been fully seen by our Party and

therefore we have not transmitted its full signiﬁcance to the Ameri-
can working class, the labor movement, and the allies of the labor
movement. What the Negroes are demonstrating is in keeping with

  22

 

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, JR.

the highest traditions of the American working class, of the struggle
for democracy in our country. , ~
I would propose that our Plenum ﬁnd the way to express publicly

I its solidarity with the Negro people in Mississippi in this anti-Bilbo

movement and really to estimate it in line with the new spirit and the
new concept which our Party, I am conﬁdent, will put forward as
a result of the action to be taken here tonight. This movement to
oust Bilbo, it seems to me, is a movement which we already see chal-
lenging the “white supremacy” advocates who dominate the govem-
ments in the deep South, developing further the self-uniﬁcation of
the Negro people and their unity with their white allies, and also
showing very distinctly their desire for self-government and for rep-
resentative government in the deep South.

I think that we can regain the moral strength on this question
which was sapped to such a large extent by Browder’s revisionism.
This resolution gives us an instrument which we can immediately
use in all of our work, within the Party as well as without. I there-
fore move, comrades, that the National Committee adopt this reso-

lution.

excerpts from concluding remarks of

Engene Dennzls‘

GENERAL SECRETARY, COMMUNIST PARTY, U.S.A.

VEN though we have acted officially and terminated the discus-

sion at this meeting of our National Committee on Comrade
Ben Davis’ report, I wish you would bear with me for just a few
minutes for a couple of observations.

There is no question that the report of Comrade Davis and the
very rich discussion of it mark the high point of this Plenum and a
high point in the work and thinking, in the Marxist maturity of most
of our leadership. And surely the conclusions we have arrived at con-
stitute a major contribution to the theoretical clariﬁcation of the
Party on the Negro question as a national question.

Notwithstanding the viewpoint of some comrades, our conclu-
sions here and the position we have adopted will serve to mobilize
the Party to ﬁght more effectively for all the immediate and partial
demands and rights of the Negro people. There were, of course,
many signiﬁcant individual contributions in addition to those which
were made tonight. I ‘particularly want to single out from last night’s
discussion, in addition to the report, the remarks of Comrade Bittel-
man and especially of Comrades Jackson and Strong. I think that
our Party, just as it will feel proud of the Marxist conclusions we
have arrived at, will also and equally be proud of the role of these
comrades in this connection.

We also have to take note of the fact that this discussion must
alert us to the immense job we still have to educate our Party to a
clearer, Marxist-Leninist understanding of the national question in
general and of the Negro question in the United [States in particular.
This discussion has emphasized further that the major work has to
be done among our white comrades, just as it has to be done particu-
larly among the white masses outside of the Communist movement.

All the comrades who originally opposed the report of Comrade
Davis and the_ resolution accept, and agree with, the main slogan of
action which our Party champions nationally in behalf of the Negro
people, namely, the right of full political, economic and social
equality for the Negro people. But these comrades have not yet

 

 

EUGENE DENNIS

grasped the cardinal fact that if this basic democratic slogan and
Marxist principle is to mean what it says, then its application in the
Black Belt—where the Negro people constitute not only a majority
of the population, but have the fundamental characteristics of an
oppressed nation—requires the exercise of the right to self-deter-
mination.

To talk of full equality for the Negro people of the South with-
out advancing and ﬁghting for their right to land and to the free
determination of their own destiny, would be a denial of the struggle
for equal rights for the Negro people, not only in the South, but
also in the North. It would be a negation and abandonment of the
great national liberation movement of the Negro people. At the
same time it would also deprive the American working class and
people of this powerful anti-imperialist movement which aids and
promotes their immediate as well as ultimate aims.

In our resolution and in Comrade Davis’ report we have not
merely reaﬂirmed our Marxist-Leninist principle of the right of
the Negro people in the Black Belt to self-determination. We have,
as comrades have noted, avoided the errors we committed in the
past. For one thing, we did not enter into an academic debate or
fruitless speculation on when or how this right will be realized, or
precisely in what form. It is incumbent upon us scientiﬁcally, as
Marxists, to state this fact.

I would just like to remark in passing that because we do not
draw a blueprint and give all the answers here, we should not
approach the question—that is, one aspect of the question—as put
by one comrade. I don’t want to get into the realm of speculation on
this matter, but I think we would make a serious and harmful
mistake if we were to associate the realization of the right of self-
determination solely with the realization of socialism in the United
States. If the American people, the labor movement in alliance with
the great Negro people and all progressive and democratic forces,
can check and defeat the onslaught of pro-fascist monopoly reaction,
and bring into power, as an important phase of that struggle, a
progressive presidential ticket and Congress in 1948, with all that
this would entail, many things will be possible, including, at least,
tremendous strides toward the full realization of equal rights of the
Negro people in the Black Belt.

Further, in contradistinction to the past, we do not present the
slogan of self-determination as an immediate slogan of action, but as
the aﬂirmation of a historic right which guides and establishes the
direction of all our work in the South. We must and can convince
far larger sections of both Negro and white masses in the South that

25

 

 

   

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

the struggle for the national liberation of the Negro people, includ-
ing the ﬁght for land, as well as for all other immediate economic
and democratic demands, is the key to breaking the grip of
monopoly capital in the South. It is the key to overcoming the
industrial backwardness of the South, the one-crop system and all
semifeudal relations, the curse of pro-fascist Bourbon reaction which
enslaves the Negro people and also impoverishes, holds down, and
degrades the masses of the white population.

Finally, it seems to me that our entire Party, and all advanced
workers and progressives, must realize that today, in the struggle
against the growth of pro-fascist reaction, the ﬁght for equal rights
for the Negro people in every aspect of their economic, political,
and social life, including the struggle for the equal rights of the
Negro people in the Black Belt, is a central task as well as a most
powerful weapon in the struggle against reaction. It is a central
part of the united people’s movement to halt the rise of fascism. As
such, it must be resolutely and skillfully supported and fought for
in every part of the nation, and by every labor, anti-fascist and pro-
gressive element and organization.

excerpts from discussion

1. [W265 E. fczafsoiz

STATE CHAIRMAN, COMMUNIST PARTY OF LOUISIANA

T SEEMS to me that the function of the resolution is to arm the
Party with a basic theoretical weapon with which we can have a
correct perspective and orientation for formulating, in the develop-
ment of events, temporary and tactical programs to guide the day
to day struggle of the Negro people for liberation, and to insure the
preparation and coordination of this struggle with the historical mis-
sion of the working class.

In preparation for a discussion of this kind, we cannot excuse
ourselves by discrediting or closing out from our own inspection
and examination, world experience and the compiled crystallized
experiences of our revolutionary movement through many scores
of years of progress. Marx says, in the Manifesto, “The Communists
ﬁght for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforce-
ment of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the
movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the
future of that movement.”

Reflected in tonight’s discussion there has been considerable
confusion between a tactical, temporary program and the question
of a fundamental, theoretical position of our Party. Without such
a fundamental policy in regard to Negro liberation it will be impos-
sible to develop proper and “ripe” immediate programs of action.

Some comrades express great concern that there is so much
prejudice attached to the term “self-determination,” that we must
develop an alternative. Nowhere in the writings of Lenin that I have
seen does he insist on the use of a term. As a matter of fact, in a
discussion—I believe it was in l9l6—on the national question, Lenin
said that certain points in the program of the Polish Social-Demo-
crats were acceptable, though they omitted and did not use the term
“self-determination.” But Lenin insisted that the omission of any

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

particular term of scientiﬁc Marxist usage must not at the same time
represent a vulgarization of the principle.

It is possible, in my opinion, if the comrades are convinced that
the term “self-determination” is an obstacle, that we could state
negatively the same objective. I am just thinking out loud on the
point. For example, self—determination as applied to the Black Belt
might also be expressed, “against forcible suppression of the growth
and realization of the national aspirations of the Negro people and
of the Negro majority in the Black Belt of the South.” We are
against forcible suppression of their national aspirations, which
means precisely that we are for self-determination. '

I want to speak for a moment in defense of the concept of self-
determination. The meaning given to the treatment of the Negro
question outside of the South is this—we view the problem as that
of national minorities, that is, the cornerstone of the concept is the
individual. On the other hand, the concept of the Negro in his
heartland territory in the Black Belt of the South as that of an
oppressed nation has as its cornerstone the mass.

Marxism teaches us that the emancipation of the mass is the
main prerequisite for the emancipation of the individual. There-
fore, according to Marxism, the emancipation of the individual is
impossible without the emancipation of the mass. And hence, the

validity of our emphasis upon the mass expression and reality of

Negro oppression as it exists in the Black Belt.

Lenin elsewhere gives a deﬁnition of the right of nations to
self-determination, which, I think, bears repetition. He says, in Vol.
XIX, p. 50: “The right of nations to self-determination . . . is
merely the logical expression of the struggle against national oppres-
sion in every form.” I don’t see how the comrades can argue with
such a deﬁnition or fail to see its application to the problem of
Negro liberation in the South. “The recognition of self-determina-
tion,” Lenin said, “is not the same as making federation a principle.
One may be a determined opponent of this principle . . . and yet
prefer federation to national inequality as the only path towards
complete democratic centralism.” And, as Communists, we have
the responsibility, in drafting a program for a long or short-term
perspective, of distinguishing between the rights of nations and the
duties of Communists.

The Communists in the Black Belt would of course work for
the cementing of national working class unity. With a progressive
government in power, certainly the Communists in the Black Belt
would propagandize strongly against any separatist tendencies.

28

 

 

A JAMES E. JACKSON

Nonetheless, we must not confuse the duties of Communists with
what we Communists hold out as the rights of nations; and one of
the rights of nations is certainly self-determination. In a nutshell,
all the old polemics against self-determination are based on the
argument that it is “infeasible” under capitalism and “unnecessary"
under socialism.

Self-determination is one of many democratic demands. And we
know that nowhere in any country, under capitalism, and certainly
not in the present stage of American imperialism, is any single demo-
cratic demand able to be realized except in a very warped form. And
so it is with this democratic demand of self-determination. But
certainly, we would be a poor vanguard if we begin dropping from
our program the struggle for other democratic demands which are
not fully realizable under capitalism.

As Lenin said: “It is a fundamental theoretical mistake to speak
of one of the forms and of one of the demands of democracy as
‘infeasible’.” (Vol. XIX, p. 273.)

I would like to make one further observation. “Progressively
increasing self-conscious community of Negro Americans” is claimed
by its inventor, to be a new “Marxist” invention to characterize
the status of the Negro people in the United States. This is nothing
new. This is not Marxism. It is Proudhonism; it is “Bundism”; it
is a rehashing of the theory of Otto Bauer, of national-cultural
autonomy. It is an absurdity to say that people no matter where they
dwell, constitute a nation because they are bound merely with
national and religious afﬁnities.

We are a nation, existing in a common territory, and there is
a Negro nation that exists as a fact in the South, in the heartland
of the Negro majority in the Black Belt. It is not required that this
Negro nation shall be conscious of its full national character, nor
is it required by our theory or by the reality of the situation that
the Negro people in their majority concentrations in the Black Belt
shall have a fu1l—grown development in every one of its national
characteristics.

There is already a Negro bourgeoisie in the Black Belt. If anyone
knows anything about Durham, N.C., and other industrial and
business centers, they know this fact. Durham is a banking and
insurance center of the South for Negroes, where there are Negro
business men and petty capitalists. If we want further documenta-
tion—take the fact, for example, that a professor at Howard
University has written a book on Negroes as capitalists. And I think
it is clear that all of the characteristics of nationhood are seen

29

 

     

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION }

reﬂected in the Negro territory of the Black Belt, though the one of
common economic life is not full blown but still one characterized
by commodity exchange in the main. Contrary to what one comrade
said, nowhere is it required that a nation shall be in its economic life
lifted to the stage of industrial development to qualify as having a
common economic life. If that were so, there would be very few r
nations abroad.

As Comrade Lenin said, in reference to certain Polish Social
Democrats: “Subjectively the Polish Comrades want to make Marx- s
ism ‘more profound’, but they do it very‘ awkwardly. Objectively,
their phrases about infeasibility are an expression of opportunism. ’
. . . All of the demands of democracy in general are infeasible under
imperialism.” (Vol. XIX, p. 273.)

As to the present and ultimate worth—whileness of the concept
of the Negro in the South as a nation, Lenin said: “Just as mankind
can achieve the abolition of classes only by passing through the
transition period of the dictatorship of the oppressed class, so man-
kind can achieve the inevitable merging of nations only by passing
through the transition period of complete liberation of all the op-
pressed nations, i.e., their freedom to secede.”

Some of the comrades object that the present use of the concept
_  V of self—determination is undialectical, but if dialectics are needed
 '» they are needed in application to the solution of the national ques-
 tion, and they are certainly expressed in this quotation just read
 from Lenin. He says further: “The aim of socialism is not only to
abolish the present division of mankind into small states and all .’
national isolation, but also to merge them.” I think we can take that
as authority enough to dispel any doubts and fears of some comrades
that our Party, or those who support this draft resolution as a basis
for a full-blown theoretical position, have any illusions about what
we are ﬁghting for.

We know we are ﬁghting for socialism. And in our country, the
oppressed Negro nation in the Black Belt constitutes a major ally.

AUTHOR OF “THE NEGRO QUESTION IN THE UNITED STATES”
AND "RECONSTRUCTION: THE BATTLE FOR DEMOCRACY”

T THE heart of our debate on the question of self-determina-
tion is, of course, our analysis of the status of the Negro people,
whether they are a nation or not. And naturally, those who deny that
the Negro people are a nation, also deny the validity of the slogan
and program of self-determination. These have been the two
principle points of debate. What I have had to say about this I have
said in two articles recently published and I don’t mean to go over
the material given there. (Political A ﬁairs, Nov. and Dec. 1946.)

I want to devote my time to taking up some of the arguments in
opposition to our interpretation of the Negro people as a nation
and our program for self-determination as the ultimate solution.

Two principle counter-propositions have been advanced. First
that a national program must at all times be subordinated to the
interests of socialism, and to the interests of the working class, and
that being the case—with which we have no argument—-the specific
situation in this country is such that advancing the slogan of self-
determination is in opposition to the interests of socialism and to
the interests of the working class. Let me ask the comrades to
think back over the history of the debates on the question of self-
determination not only in our Party, but internationally, and see
if that is not the argument which was put forth by the Austrian
Social Democrats, by the Polish Social Democrats, by the Bund in
Russia, in order to deny the validity of self-determination with
respect to the numerous nations which made up the Austro-
Hungarian empire and in all of Central Europe at that time, and
also of the old Russian empire. And has not history shown that they
were completely erroneous, that when the Austro~Hungarian empire
was broken up it was not on some vague cultural autonomous com-
munities, or some other similar vague groupings, but on the basis of
national groupings formed solidly on a territorial basis. The same
thing took place in the old Russian empire, and in Russia it was

31

 

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

a socialist development, while in the Austro-Hungarian empire it
was a capitalist development.

Now some of the speciﬁc points raised in opposition to the draft
resolution in respect to the Negro nation. The ﬁrst point is that the
Negro people as well as Southerners as a who-le are ﬂeeing from the
South. Yes they have been ﬂeeing from the South ever since the
days of slavery and after the overthrow of slavery, and particularly
since World War I. But has that changed the situation in the South
fundamentally in any sense? Has it wiped out the share-cropping
plantation in the South? Has it done away with the actual base of
reactionary political power in the South which contributes to
reaction on a national scale in the form of the Bourbon Democrats?
It has brought about some important changes creating an important
Negro proletariat situated in the North in close association with
white workers, but it has not wiped out these persistent semifeudal
remnants of the South. We would be guilty of very harmul illusions
if we thought that these remnants of feudalism can be so easily
wiped out and if in conjunction with that we also thought that the
upshoots of this system, and particularly white chauvinism among
all layers of the population, can be so easily destroyed by such auto-
matic tendencies without the active intervention of the class forces
and of the Negro people which alone can bring about such changes.

Furthermore, we cannot assume that social development in the
South, nor elsewhere, is a static proposition. Changes naturally go
on and among these are changes in the relation of the people
brought about by nation-wide factors such as industrial booms or
crises. When there is an industrial boom in the country as a whole
the tendency is for the labor supply in the present agrarian area of
the South to be tapped and when there is a crisis the tendency is the
opposite—for these workers to return to their towns‘ and villages and
share-cropper shacks. That we have seen from the history of our
own country for many years. _

Another matter raised by one or two comrades is that the Negro
people have not developed a national consciousness. I wish to point
out the difference between national consciousness and a national
slogan. First of all, a national consciousness may not always be
expressed in a national form. We see that happening everywhere.
With respect to the Negro people, the form of the expression of their
identity as a people, which is simply another way of saying their
national consciousness is expressed in ways which are not at all
clearly national, such as race consciousness. Certainly in many parts
of the world, particularly as the upsurge against imperialism has

32

 

 

JAMES S. ALLEN

developed, many people were swept into national movements as a
development of their resentment against imperialist domination.
This was manifested in terms of the present upsurge and struggle
for democracy, the struggle against imperialism, and these do not
always start as national struggles. They develop in that direction
and very quickly reach that stage in this period.

For instance, the Moslems in India have developed national
slogans only in the past 5 years, since 1940 when the slogan of
Pakistan was put forth. Until then it was considered as a communal
and semi—religious question and British imperialism took advantage
of it to split the peoples of India. That is quite a historic develop-
ment. And why should we assume that in this country a national
movement among the Negro people should not develop in forms
different from elsewhere, when actually it is.

Another idea advanced is that Stalin stated in his book, Marxism
and the National and Colonial Question, that a nation during a
period of capitalist development has its national slogans expressed
by the bourgeosise. And one comrade argued that since there is not
a well-developed Negro bourgeoisie, and there is not, therefore a
national consciousness cannot be developed among the Negro people.
But is it true that in all periods of history it is always the bourgeoisie
which carried forward national slogans? That is not true. Who is
ﬁghting for Chinese independence? Is it the Chinese landlords and
capitalists? Or the Chinese peasants? Or to mention the Soviet
Union where it is obvious that it is the proletariat which is advanc-
ing the development of nations.

A rather unusual, unscientiﬁc conception was introduced into
the discussion-—that of national racial minority. I am sure that many
of us remember the whole period of previous discussions on this
question. I always found that where someone who opposes our
position of the Negro people as a nation, tried to present an alterna-
tive position to be in accordance with realities, to be scientiﬁc in its
basis, tied up with current issues and struggles of the people, he has
not been able to do so in scientiﬁcally correct terms. He has had to
fall back in his discussion of the Negro question on really outmoded
concepts such as race or pure class or labor or castes. And what else
is the meaning of national racial minority? Because as Marxists we
certainly cannot accept a racial category as a point of departure.

We have also talked a great deal about equality. Sometimes I
think that where this term is advanced as a very generalized term
in the course of a discussion of this kind, it lacks concreteness and
lacks validity. One must stop to think what we mean by equality

33

 

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

for the Negro people. Is that equality to be attained as a result of
a general educational program, as a result of a general propaganda
program? Is it to be attained through the winning of certain equal
rights here and there?

In order to obtain this equality for the Negro people it is neces-
sary to overthrow a whole system of oppression, to root out the very
real and concrete base of that oppression which’ in the South is the
semifeudal land system that exists there in combination with the
trusts and monopolies. And also a question of utmost importance
to us is that we cannot think of attaining real equality for the Negro
people without at the same time carrying on a consistent struggle
against white chauvinism.

Here, also, I wish to refer to the relation of self-determination to
socialism. We have a responsibility to think not only in terms" of our
immediate situation, but also in terms of our ultimate solutions. Is
there anyone here that thinks that with the winning of socialism in
the U.S. we will be able automatically, without special attention to
the question, to uproot all the prejudices which have been left over
from capitalism, among them, white chauvinismP Therefore, the
program of self-determination is necessary not only from the point of
view of the giving of direction to our present movement and our
present struggle, but from the point of View of the ultimate solution
of the question.

I just want to close on one point. One comrade remarked that
he thought the resolution before us was merely for the record, that
nothing serious was going to be done on the basis of this resolution.
I certainly don’t think that is our intention. I think that it will be

I necessary on the basis of this draft resolution, as it is improved and

revised, to launch a really systematic and well-organized discussion
within the Party on the whole problem of our concrete present tasks
and also our general theoretical approach.

STATE EDUCATION DIRECTOR, C. P. OF MICHIGAN

HE struggle for equal rights for the Negroes must be under-
stood as the struggle against American imperialism. If the
working class is to defeat American imperialism, if it is to achieve
socialism, it cannot do it by itself, but only in alliance with the
Negro people. It can do it only by advancing proper slogans at the
proper time, and having a correct theoretical understanding of the
relationship of the Negroes to the American nation. I think our
resolution gives our Party a real weapon for combatting a lot of
erroneous ideas—many of which are current in the labor movement.
The question of the imperialist character of Negro oppression
is the central core of our Party’s position and the question of the
Negroes as a nation is based, not on any speculation, but on factual
data, on history. I want to present my comments to this discussion
on that basis. —
Let’s brieﬂy trace one or two aspects of the development histori-
cally of the Negro people in the United States. We know very well
that the State of South Carolina, for example, stretched at one time
to the Mississippi River and we know that all of that territory from
the Mississippi River on back, including Tennessee, large parts of
Mississippi and Alabama, were cut up only when slavery spread to
the Mississippi River after the invention of the cotton gin and the
spinning wheel. We know that the slaveholders did not comprise a
majority of the population in those areas and that these states were
broken up to form a slave empire. One of the comrades asked, what
was the relationship of the Negroes to the American nation at the
time of the signing of the Constitution? The answer is that the
Negroes bore the relationship of slaves and didn’t participate in the
formation of those states. They had nothingto do with the state
boundaries and only had something to do with them when the
federal government, during Reconstruction, established a federal
region of the territory and administered it under a military
dictatorship.

35

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

When that military dictatorship was dissolved, these old state
lines were reconstituted and the Negroes assumed on a different level,
practically the same relationships that had been enforced before as
slaves, only now, as sharecroppers and croppers. It is in that sense
that we have got to view our ﬁght now for democratic rights, because
that situation which existed in 1867, or more precisely, 1877, is for
the most part in existence today in that same region. In that same
region of the Black Belt the Negro people comprise a majority.

During this period other developments have come about wherein
the Negro people have developed capitalist relations, and the very
fact of owning a piece of land, of growing cotton and owning cotton
to sell constitutes the development of capitalist relations. The com-
rades who confuse feudalism with what exists in the South are con-
fusing a term which we use quite loosely with what actually is the
economic situation in the Black Belt today. The relationships that
exist in the Black Belt, while they are in part semifeudal, are
basically capitalist relationships. The relationship that the cropper
bears to the landlord is a capitalist relationship, and the relationship
of banker to the plantation is a capitalist relationship. This set of
relationships exist in the Black Belt for the Negro sharecropper,
Negro day laborer and Negro tenant and farmer. While they are
not developed in a full and well rounded sense, nevertheless, the
struggle which is to be carried on in the Black Belt, is to be carried
on within the limits of those relationships and for the purpose of
changing those relationships which are in the main capitalist, but
also intertwined with a feudal character.

We have got to see exactly in what way this struggle is developing
in the deep South. We are not going to just sit by and wait until
the struggle develops and then take a position. The Negro people
are beginning to ﬁght now for the right to hold oﬂice. That was what
that struggle was about with Victor Ash in Norfolk, Rev. Simpson
in Houston, and Scott in Atlanta running for public ofﬁce. That was
what the struggle is about now in Mississippi, in the trial of Bilbo.
In that trial, I think we have an example of just exactly how the
Negro people feel toward the question of their relationship to the
United States. Let us bear in mind that in the United States the
sovereignty of the citizen is expressed not through the government
at Washington, except when you are abroad, but through your
state government. You vote in a state. If you move from Illinois and
come to New York, you have got to establish citizenship in New

,; .;._ .;.:_.u_». , _<_-3.: :.'-.-: 

 

York State.
In that sense, the Negro who is in Mississippi is denied the right

36

 

 

A. W. BERRY

to express his sovereignty through the state, the sovereign state of
Mississippi. The result is that he appeals on the basis of his national
citizenship. The Negro feels that he is an American and I think
that every Negro feels that he is an American. But does that con-
tradict what our resolution says? Not at all. He feels he is an
American, he appeals to the Federal government, the government
of the several states, to intervene in his behalf to give him the right
to express his sovereignty. In that sense, I think we see the relation-
ship of the Negro people at the present time to the American nation,
and we get some idea of what the Negro people feel, how they feel
toward the American nation.

We also understand why the Negroes don’t want any separation.
They can’t understand it, nor do they want to indulge in separatist
movements. Now, if we see the Negro people as a nation, then we
can see the development towards the ultimate expression of nation-
hood from all of these small developments that are taking place in
the country today.

If that is so, then we have got to begin developing our concrete
position. When we put out the slogan of the right of self-determina-
tion, we accept that slogan as the apex of a whole program for the
liberation of the Negro people. In my opinion, that program
includes, for example, the change of the land tenure in the South,
the ﬁght on the credit system, to undo this system of usury that is
in existence, the abolition of crop liens, for the right to vote, the
struggle against the poll tax, and a whole set of other demands.

We who have lived in the South—I happen to come from Texas——
know that the enforcement of the laws is not in the hands, let us say,
of Mississippi as a state as much as it is in the hands of the county.
The county is in a certain sense supreme, or at least it is the ﬁrst unit
of local government. Therefore, if we see the development of the
Negroes towards nationhood, then our whole position toward the
development of self-government in counties has to be given some
immediate attention. And as a part of our work, the question of
Negroes seeking oﬂice in counties and localities must be fought for
by our Party in the South and further advanced.

If we don’t have a program which leads towards the attaining
of forms of self-government for the Negro majority in the Black Belt,
then we are just simply kidding the Negroes and kidding ourselves.
We are not mobilizing anybody to ﬁght American imperialism, and
we are never going to attain the full equality of the Negro people.
That is the thing that we have got to get across to the working class

STATE CHAIRMAN, C. P. OF GEORGIA

I WILL very brieﬂy go into a few points concerning the South
which I think are of the utmost importance. The South has the
lowest standard of living of any section of our country. The per

capita income is something like $750 a year, $150 less than any other _

section of the country. From one end of the South to another there
are closed down and empty war factories. Out of a population of
about 36 million in the 13 southern states, almost 10 million are
Negroes with a lower standard of living. The South is dominated by
Wall Street ﬁnance capital. For example, 85 per cent of Georgia's
wealth is owned by capitalist forces outside of the state. Florida is
largely controlled by the du Pon.ts. The South is witnessing its youth
leaving for the North and other sections of the country. As they grad-
uate college, if fortunate enough to go to college, they go to the
North to work for the big corporations.

The South is a land of the crop lien system, which also affects
the landlords and makes them dependent on the Wall Street corpora-
tions. We should understand just how dependent these landlords
are on the Wall Street corporations. For planting, harvesting and
selling the cotton crops the landlords have to rely on the banks from
year to year. Without going into this any further, the South has
many features of a semi-colonial nature.

Let’s examine some of the methods used to keep the South in
bondage. There is freight discrimination and the tariff policy. There
are few prospects for home consumption factories in the South. The
standard of living of the South must be much lower than the rest
of the country. It is stymied by higher interest rates and monopolistic
credit practices. There is white chauvinism and the ﬁnancing of
such fascist organizations as the Columbians by the monopolists. The
big corporations also buy up such professional Southerners as Bilbo
and Talmadge. Tens of thousands of dollars were poured in by Wall
Street railroad and power interests and other reactionary forces, to

39

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

assure the election of Eugene Talmadge in the 1946 primary in
Georgia.

The South is a source of great wealth to the big corporations and
monopolies and a source of strength to them. But it is also evident
that the South is a potential Achilles Heel to American imperialism.
It is possible to win the Negro and whites together on an anti-
monopoly program, concretized on certain demands, for jobs and
concrete proposals for industrialization of the South, for the opening
of the war plants, for peace-time production, for federal loans, etc.

We have to consider the point made by Comrade Dennis, about
concretizing the ﬁght against the monopolies. We must engender a
hatred against the monopolies, du Ponts, Morgans, etc. We must
learn from the Party in France which succeeded in instilling in the
people a tremendous hatred of the 200 families. We can do some-
thing of that type in the South. Certainly one of the great needs of
the South today is the organization of the share-croppers, and it
seems to me this must be done by the C.I.O. We must have speciﬁc
ideas on organization and a program—on the commisary stores,
the right to plant gardens, and such demands. Then, loans to share-
croppers, so that they can buy machinery. But they must be

' organized in order to fulﬁll any such schemes.

In connection with the Negro question our greatest need is to
tie up our theory with practice. This means ﬁrst of all to differentiate
sharply between the problems of the Negro in the South and the
Negro in the North——they are not identica1—and to avoid at all costs
discussing any question by ourselves apart from the struggles of the
Negro people and apart from their mass organizations. My conten-
tion is that the basic question of the South is a program of agricul-
tural and industrial reforms throughout the South and that these
bourgeois-democratic reforms are the ﬁrst step in the solving of the
problems of the Negro.

NATIONAL COMMITTEE, C.P.U.S.A.

I SHOULD like to make a few observations on the arguments
against the draft resolution. The argumentation that the Black
Belt is not a stable community has not been proven. The reference
to Lenin’s analysis of the agrarian conditions in the U.S. and Russia
in which he analyzes a tendency of the peasantry to leave the villages
and go to the cities proves precisely nothing as far as this argument
is concerned. Because the same Lenin who analyzed this tendency
of peasants leaving their villages for the cities did not leave the
solution of the peasant problem to this tendency. He formulated a
program of agrarian revolution as part of the democratic revolution
and led the ﬁght to victory. On the other hand those who argue
against the draft resolution apparently intend to leave the solution
of the Negro problem in the Black Belt to this tendency. This is not
Leninism nor is it Marxism.

It is true that the Negro nation in the Black Belt has not
developed all its national attributes to the classical form. The
Negro nation is in process of development. But it has all the
attributes of nationhood and. not one opponent of the resolution
tonight or in the discussion in Political Aﬁairs has managed to
successfully deny this fact.

Lastly, the statement that the Black Belt economy is feudal,
therefore it cannot have national attributes, since national attributes
can only be built on capitalist economy, is confusion, not clariﬁca-
tion. The economy in the Black Belt is not feudalism, and Comrade
Berry has argued this point well. It is a distinct national economy
though not in full form, not classical, which has some feudal charac-
teristics, remnants of feudalism and slavery, but as part of the
capitalist economy of the entire world. Therefore, the argument that
the economy in the Black Belt is feudal and therefore can give no
rise to national movements is entirely invalid.

In tonight's discussion, I personally was impressed most with the
arguments of Comrade Chase and I should like to discuss the matter

41

 

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

as he raised it. It was very fruitful to do what he did, namely, to
approach the question from the standpoint of liberating the South
and the needs of the South. True, that isn’t the only standpoint
from which the problem can be approached, but it is an important
standpoint. But I think he is making a number of theoretical and
political mistakes.

What is it that is at the basis of the undeveloped condition of
the South, its underdeveloped condition, its backwardness? Is it only
oppression by northern monopolies as Comrade Chase said? It is
that, to be sure. But is it only that? (Interpolation by Comrade Chase:
“Basically that.”) No, it isn’t. The next factor is the survival of
feudal and semi-slave relationships. That is point No. 2—of equal
importance. But what is perhaps of even greater importance is that
these two factors—Northern monopolies and their oppression and
exploitation of the South, and the exploitation of the South by the
Southern landowners and feudalists or semifeudalists, do not run
parallel. What you have there is a combination of the two—a steady
integration of the two, while at the same time there is friction within
this combination. In other words, what the South has been suifer~

" ing from for decades is this peculiar combination: an integration

of Northern monopoly capital with the remnants of feudal and semi-
slave relationships of the South itself, and you cannot separate one
from the other, and you cannot counterpose one against the other.
That is the basic cause for the backwardness, the degeneracy, for
everything that is reactionary and evil in the South.

And what is the most dramatic expression of the South’s troubles?
It is the national oppression of the Negroes. In it everything is
epitomized. Every bad feature, every reactionary feature, every evil
feature of Southern life is epitomized in the national oppression of
the Negroes.

And the American working class may as well make up its mind
to it—there will be no free South as long as there is a nation
oppressed in the South, and of course there will be no free America
as long as there is a South in slavery. »

Nor is it true that there is a contradiction between organizing
a united Southern people’s front against Northern monopoly
capital on all these issues which I have enumerated, on the one hand,
and the struggle of the white workers and white people of the South
in support of the Negro liberation movement. I say no contradiction
exists whatsoever. More than that, I maintain that only to the degree
that the anti-imperialist, anti-monopoly forces move against this
and begin to gain conscious support of the Negro liberation move-

42

 

 

 

ALEXANDER BITTELMAN

ment in the South, to that extent will that movement really become
powerful and succeed—which the South must achieve to become free.

One more point. Is there a contradiction between carrying on
a struggle for the most elementary equal rights of the Negroes in the
South and elsewhere, and the ﬁght for national liberation or
national self-determination? No contradiction whatsoever. If we
know anything from our experience and from our studies, we know
this much, that only to the degree that the Negro liberation move-
ment acquires full national consciousness, only to that degree will
they become powerful enough, in alliance with the white workers,
to achieve their objectives.

Now a few words on some other points raised in the discussion.
One comrade said that it doesn’t follow that a community which
possesses the four necessary attributes of nationhood must necessarily
become a nation. I think it is true. We know examples where com-
munities having all four attributes, even though in elementary form,
did not develop them fully into a nation. But those nations remained
backward in other respects. Allow me to say, for example, that in
Russia—the classical example of the old empire of the Czar—there
were literally dozens of nations of whose existence nobody even
suspected. What was their condition as we know it now? They were
stable communities, having all attributes of nationhood, but were
prevented from developing them by the Czarist empire. And the
result was a reactionary development under Czarism. _

The point I wish to make is that the development of the
American Negroes in the Black Belt into a full—ﬂedged nation in
the classical sense is a basic requirement for the progressive develop-
ment of the United States. I say that as long as the growth of this
nation into full nationhood is retarded, the entire progressive
temper in the United States is thereby weakened. The reasons why
I think so are the following. The Negro national liberation move-
ment, as we all agree, is one of the most powerful allies of the anti-
imperialist struggle of the American working class, which means
eventually of the socialist struggle. The development of the Negroes
in the Black Belt into full nationhood means a strengthening of
their struggle against American imperialism, for the overthrow
of the rule of the American trusts and the Southern feudalists. It
means as a result of this struggle the unfolding of the most funda-
mental and the most profound struggles for democracy in the United
States, anti-imperialist struggles leading to socialism.

That is why I believe that the policy of our party, as expressed
in the resolution and in the report of Comrade Ben Davis to stimu-

43

 

 

 

  

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

late the struggle of the Negroes for national liberation, to deepen
their national consciousness, means to deepen and strengthen one
of the most important detachments of the whole anti-imperialist
struggle. And to deepen this struggle is to fulﬁll in this situation
the most basic requirement for our historical development toward
socialism. And in this sense the draft resolution, "far from being an
obstacle to socialism, is one of the most powerful instruments to
promote that struggle, historically speaking. '

 

 

 

6. [Pay H zmséoroug/2

SECRETARY, NATIONAL NEGRO COMMISSION, C.P.U.S.A.

HE further extension of democracy in the United States is

restricted almost exclusively to the degree in which democracy is
extended to the Negro people. This is especially true of the South.
The development of democracy in the South’ lags far behind that
of other sections of the country. The unﬁnished task of the bourgeois
democratic revolution, restricts the development of the democratic
processes in the South, and, at the same time, endangers the demo-
cratic gains in the North and other sections of the country.

The former slave economy left strong remnants of feudalism
in the South. This is expressed in the backward plantation agricul-
ture, which helps to retard the industrial expansion of the South.
The state power of the several Southern states rests in the hands of
ﬁnance capital and the landlord class. The several states of the
South stand out almost as autonomous states, based on the one party
system, which was so ably explained by Comrade Smith yesterday.
The principle of “states’ rights” negates, almost entirely, the juris-
diction of the federal government over the states of the South. At
the same time these states, while disfranchising millions of Negroes
and poor whites, send a large bloc of Congressmen and senators to
the Congress of the United States. At will they block or defeat all
progressive, social and labor legislation.

The backward, semifeudal system of the South is not only detri-
mental to the oppressed Negro masses. It is detrimental to the poor
whites, the middle classes, yes, it is even detrimental to sections
of the local Southern capitalists, and certainly to the nation as a
whole. While there is a sharp differential between the political,
economic and social status of the Negro and poor and middle class
whites of the South, there is also a sharp differential between the
poor and middle class whites of the South and those of the North.
It is general knowledge that wages and social security, educational
and health standards of the South are lower than that of the North
and other sections of the country. Housing and sanitary conditions

 

....__ I _ _.....____.. _.._,_*....,__g

 

 

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

are the Worst in the nation. The rate of unemployment, illiteracy,
sickness and death is the highest in the entire country.

In the name of “White supremacy,” the white ruling class of the
South impoverishes a whole section of the nation’s population. This
is possible, only because of the deep rooted white chauvinism in the
South. For generations the white masses have been indoctrinated
with hate against the Negro masses. This factor ’must be kept in
mind, if we are correctly to approach a solution to the Negro prob-
lem and the problems of the South generally.

The slogans for Negro rights and for self-determination in the
Black Belt must not be raised in a separate and abstract manner.
These slogans must be associated with issues that effect all sections
of the toiling masses of the South, around which the broadest section
of the population can be united against the common enemy, the
Bilbos, Rankins, Talmadges and Crumps. Therefore, we must seek
to raise issues and slogans around which can be built the broadest
possible people’s anti-fascist, anti-imperialist front, for the further
extension of democracy in the South.

Only by the further extension of democracy in the South, for all
the people, will it be possible to realize the demands of equal
rights for the Negro people and for self-determination in the Black
Belt. I emphasize this point, precisely because the strength of the
white ruling class of the South lies in their ability to deceive the
masses of poor and middle class whites, to make them believe that
the demands of the Negro masses can only be realized at their
expense. This concept must be shattered, and it can be done only
by the correct application of the tactics of the united front.

The struggle for the further extension of democracy in the South,
must be led by the working class, in alliance with the oppressed
Negro people, the poor and middle class whites, and the liberal
bourgeoisie. The main driving force must come from the working
class in which the Negro workers constitute a sizable sector. The
chief duty of the white and Negro Communist is to struggle for the
unity of the Negro and white workers and for the unity of the
labor movement in the South.

The Negro liberation movement, in my opinion will not be
conﬁned to the scope of any one Negro organization, but will take
the form of a united Negro people’s front, embracing all organized
sections of the Negro people, around a common program of libera-
tion. While the leadership of such a movement must represent all
sections of the Negro population, the Negro workers must constitute
the main driving force. The Negro workers must strive to build and

46

 

RAY HANSBOROUGH

strengthen the alliance between the organized labor movement and
the Negro people.

The strength of the Negro peo‘ple’s movement will be only so
strong as the strength of the Communists within the ranks of the
Negro people. Therefore, the present situation demands that we
take steps seriously to_build our Party and circulation of our press-
the Worker and the Daily Worker—among the broadest sections of
the Negro people.

SECRETARY, NATIONAL EDUCATION COMMISSION, C.P.U.S.A.

I WOULD like to speak about the objections raised against the
position advanced in the resolution.

One comrade advances an argument from the standpoint of
formal logic. I will answer it on the grounds of formal logic. He says
that it is true that a community of people, to be a nation, must have
those characteristics which Stalin indicates in his deﬁnition. How-
ever, this comrade says, the existence of these conditions among a
people does not mean it is a nation. I think if we develop the
essence of this argument, it can be made to have substance only if
we are prepared to question the scientiﬁc validity of Stalin’s deﬁni-
tion of a nation. This argument means the following: “A nation is
a historically evolved, stable community of language, territory,
economic life and psychological make-up manifested in community
of culture.” At the same time it is possible for a historically devel-
oped and stable community -of people with a common territory,
language, economy and psychology to exist and yet not be a nation.

Therefore, this comrade propounded a riddle to the National
Committee: What is it that is a historically developed community
of people with a common territory, language, economy and psy-
chology, which is not a nation? And, as always when such riddles
are proposed, I say: I’ll bite, what is it? When a community of
people has all the characteristics of a nation it is a nation and
nothing else. Otherwise, we must declare that the deﬁnition above
is not an adequate deﬁnition of a nation because it does not fully
describe the phenomena which it sets out to describe. For example,
if I give an inadequate deﬁnition of a man as an animal that walks
on two feet, then it would be possible to ﬁnd an animal that walks
on two feet which is not a man, but the reason for that is that my
deﬁnition of a man was inadequate. Similarly if our deﬁnition of
a nation is inadequate, then it would be possible to ﬁnd a community
of people which ﬁts the deﬁnition but which is not a nation.

Now, I want to pass on to some of the other objections raised,

48

MAX WEISS

One comrade says that the Negro people in the Black Belt are not
a nation because they lack two of the characteristics of a nation. He
asserts that the Black Belt is not a stable community, but does not
prove it. When we deal with stable phenomena we are not dealing
with static phenomena. A stable community may grow or decline,
may expand or contract, but it is a stable community because it per-
sists, regardless of whether it grows or declines, increases or decreases,
during certain periods.

Statistics are quoted. No attempt is made to show the counter-
forces to the movements away from the Black Belt, etc. What is the
history of the Black Belt? This stable community has existed for
more than 200 years. Up to the end of Reconstruction it was a com-
munity which was growing, expanding. After Reconstruction and up
to the present day there has been a continual but small and steady
shrinkage. It is the shrinking of the Black Belt in this later period
and the statistics proving it which is advanced to demonstrate the
fact that this is not a stable community.

But what accounts for the fact that in this period the Black Belt
has shrunk? And what is there in the future which gives assurance
that this shrinkage is only a temporary and transient phenomenon?

By the way, this same_ argument about the disappearance of the
Black Belt is put forward to get us coming and going. We hear
the argument in the ﬁrst place that it is the mechanization of
agriculture in the Black Belt which is destroying the Black Belt. And
now we hear, on the contrary, that it is the backward, pre—capitalist
conditions from which the Negro masses are ﬂeeing, which results in
the disappearance of the Black Belt. Well, you can’t have it both
ways.

What is there, despite the tendency toward shrinkage of the
Black Belt under present conditions, which fully justiﬁes our state-
ment that historically this is a stable community, that it will persist?
Not only the historical fact that it has persisted, but also the fact
that we have the perspective in the Black Belt of the break-up of
the plantation system. And the destruction of the plantation system
will be accompanied by division of the land among the sharecrop-
-pers. When that is done we will see not a continuation of the ﬂight
from the Black Belt but on the contrary a slowing down or an end
to this out-migration. We may even see the beginning of an immi-
gration into a free Black Belt by the Negro farmers taking advantage
of the division of this land, a migration which on a smaller scale,
under diiferent historic conditions, will be similar to the migration
to the public domain in the west when the homesteads were opened

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

I

up. When the future is co-nsidered, when the agrarian revolution is
kept in mind, a free Black Belt is a guarantee of the persistance and
the expansion of the Black Belt and not the disappearance of the
Black Belt.

Some comrades deny that there is a common economy in the
Black Belt. On this there is an incredible confusion. It is made to
appear that a common economy has the following meaning: that
the national bourgeoisie of a certain nation exploits that national
proletariat. In other words, there would be a common economy in
the Black Belt if there were a Negro bourgeoisie exploiting a Negro
proletariat. And the argument is advanced that such a situation
does not exist because what Negro bourgeoisie there is, is outside the
Black Belt. Hence, the comrades conclude that there is no common
economy in the Black Belt.

But this relationship of exploitation of the working class by a
capitalist class of a given nation is not an economic tie which unites
a nation. It is, on the contrary, an economic relationship which
divides a nation; it leads to the sharpest internal class struggle.

What does a common economic life mean? It means simply
the abolition of pre-capitalist forms of economy. Why do we say
that for a community of people to be a nation it is necessary to have
a.com.mon economic life? Because prior to capitalism we also had
historically developed, stable communities of people inhabiting a
common territory, speaking a common language, having even a com-
mon psychology, but economically disunited. The reason for this was
because feudalism was a system in which the feudal manors, duchies,
principalities, were economically self—suﬂicient and had no economic
relation one to the other. I/Vhen capitalism developed, it destroyed
the economic self-suﬂiciency of these individual duchies and princi-
palities through the development of a distinct division of labor be-
tween town and country, between one region and another because it
developed exchange and therefore means of transportation and com-
{IlUI11Cat10I1, making all parts of the given territory economically
interdependent and united. From this point of view, it is clear that
the Black Belt has a common economy. From this, in my opinion the
only correct point of view, the Black Belt has a common economic
life. It can be maintained that it has no common economy only if the
meaning of what an economy is, is completely misunderstood

Another comrade says that never before in history did any party
ever raise the slogan of self-determination unless it came from the
masses, unless it was raised by the masses. But this is not so For in-

50

 

MAX WEISS

stance, in 1903, when the Russian Bolsheviks formulated their pro-
gram for self-determination, there was no national movement in many
of the oppressed nations of the Czarist empire. Furthermore, in
1925 it was precisely this point which Stalin established in the po-
lemic against Semich. In the discussions in the Yugoslavian party,
Semich fought against the inclusion in the program of the Yugo-
slav party of the right of self-determination, because he claimed
there was no demand for self-determination among the masses, that

3 it was not an immediate issue. Stalin gave the example of the ex-

perience of the Russian people and showed how even when there
was no national movement they had included the slogan, and indi-
cated that in the future as a result of some war, it might become an
immediate question. This is actually what did happen. Even
though the movement at the present time in the Black Belt does
not take the form of a demand for self-determination, we must in-
clude this point in our party program. Otherwise we do not have a
Communist approach to the question.

51

 

 

8. Edward S/rmg

COMRADES, it is my ﬁrm conviction that the Negro people in

the Black Belt constitute a nation, and that the struggle for
Negro liberation and freedom arises from this fact. And that if the
Negro people are to win their freedom in this country, the struggle
must be waged as a struggle against national oppression. And the
fact of the matter is that the reason we in America are failing at this
time to win decisive victories on this front is because we are follow-
ing a policy of liberalism in approaching the question.

We have heard a good deal tonight about equality, that the
Negroes want equality, freedom, the right to vote, they don't want
to be discriminated against, etc. So do all the other peoples in this
country, the Jewish people and every minority that is discriminated
against in America——they want this discrimination removed. If our
ﬁght is limited merely to this struggle of equality and freedom in
this narrow sense, we will never have a program that will result in
the liberation of the Negro people from oppression. Because, in ad-
dition to the discriminations which exist both against Jews and
against Negroes and other minorities in America, the Negroes are
faced with the problem of national oppression, and it is from this
that arises the whole series of questions facing Negroes that are
peculiar alone to the Negro people in America.

So the question we must answer is, what is the explanation for
the fact that merely the struggle for -equality and the right to vote,
etc., are too limited to lead to the freedom of the Negro people? And
it seems to me, that we cannot work on the theory on which a given
slogan is popular at this time. Neither can we arrive at a position
based upon a Gallup Poll of the program and demands of various
organizations. Because if our position and approach to the question

' will be based on a Gallup Poll, then clearly at this time we would

not be discussing socialism, because if we examined the various
platforms, very few if any contain the demand for socialism. Yet we

52

 

 EDWARD STRONG

believe and know that it is the only ultimate hope for the working
class in this country. »

That leads me to the point of examining the program of the
Negro liberation movement in America, which at present is limited :9
fundamentally to the speciﬁc immediate demands, whereas what is
required is for us to raise the level of Negro liberation to qualita-
tively higher levels than what we see today. Otherwise we can go
on endlessly winning gains, and for generations, ever since Recon-
struction, we have talked about the gains we have made, gains
which we promptly lost. We won gains here and lost them there.
But the fact is that these gains constitute no threat basically to the
capitalist system, and in my opinion it is essential for the liberation
movement and the whole people’s coalition movement in America
to conceive of the struggles for Negroes’ rights which fundamentally
will lead the Negro people and liberation movement ultimately
into head-on collision with our oppression.

This means that the program should be of such a character as
to point the ﬁnger at monopoly capital and the big plantation
owners of the South, as the fundamental enemies of the Negro
people. It is not only not suﬂicient for a liberation movement to have
merely a program for Negroes’ rights, but the program must bring 9.
the Negro masses and their allies into struggle with the capitalist
system, and consequently from this point of View the Negro libera- ‘
tion movement needs to be reorientated. 5.

If we examine the situation in India, we will ﬁnd it effective,
because even the British and the capitalist press are telling us that F.
there is a great colonial struggle going on in India. We are told that 
it is a struggle of religions and that these people just can’t get to- 
gether, that the British have handed them freedom in fact, if only E
they were to get together.

Now, British imperialism is not the only one which argues this

way; certain dominant sections of the Indian bourgeoisie 

deny the fact that there are a whole series of nations in India. And
it is because of the many different nations there that the whole
question of Pakistan has arisen. Granted that at this moment a great
deal of that struggle is reﬂected in religious terminology, but if we
look beneath the surface, we will ﬁnd in a number of the Indian
states, nations, many of whom follow the Moslem faith. So basically
it is not a struggle of religion, but groups that have come forward,
national groups, demanding freedom in the only way they know
how. They are not asking for equality, they are not asking for the
right to vote, because they cannot put their faith solely in these

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

rights. They are asking for the right to self-determination and they
see their only hope of real freedom in a free India, and only on the
basis of that development will there be a uniﬁed India.

Comrade Jackson has made a profound contribution in his ob-
servation that it is only as the Negro people have complete freedom
to decide their own future and fate, will it be possible to unify
America and realize the cherished dreams of the Negro people of
being Americans. It has been asked: how can the Negro people
want self-determination or nationhood if they don’t raise this slo-
ganP The fact is that this has been the most profound wish of the
Negro people, and if we examine their aspirations, their literature
and the demands of the Negro people, their demand has been to be
Americans. The question before us, therefore, is how can this
cherished hope, this aspiration, of the Negro people, be realized.
This is the dialectics which Comrade Jackson spoke about. The
cherished demand of the Negro people to be Americans can never
be realized if we conceive of it as a question of integrating them
into the American scheme. We have skipped the most basic Marxist
concept of nationality and the problem of how to achieve full unity,
which is required from the ﬁght around the Negro people realizing
the aspiration of being a nation. If we examine our position in the
past we will ﬁnd we have been following a policy of liberalism, and
especially the most classical example of this is in the war plants. We
hailed the fact that the Negroes made a number of gains here and
there, and immediately after the war they began to lose their jobs.
Thousands of Negroes who made these gains no longer have jobs.
There was a struggle in the Party and in the unions as to what
should be our position, and a big section of the union leadership
took the position that the white workers cannot understand the
special approach to seniority—that they are in favor of “equality.”
This position of “pure equality” for the Negro at the close of this
war, which was the greatest and most progressive in history, led to
the disemployment of large numbers of Negroes and their removal
from industrial life. This was the result of this approach of liberal-
ism and “equality.”

Therefore, under no circumstances can that be a guide, because
theoretically it is not a guide. The result will be the same as after
this war; thousands of Negroes are out of jobs, because the trade
unions were not mobilized to understand the fact of the special
struggles for the Negro people.

This draft resolution contains the basic policy that we want to
adopt even though, in many respects it could be improved. But

that is a detail, fundamentally it gives us the orientation ‘that we
want. Finally, I believe this is one of the most important discus-
sions which the Party in America has ever engaged in. And unless
we arm ourselves with the lessons of this discussion, it will be im-
possible for the American Party to defeat the imperialist system.
The whole Working class movement is weak because we come from
the strongest imperialist country, and because we have absorbed
the ideology of the imperialists themselves, we have not come to see
the relationship of the struggle for the freedom and liberation of
the workers, to the struggle of the oppressed nations in the World,
of the colonial people all over, and speciﬁcally of the Negro people
in America. '

NATIONAL COMMITTEE, C.P.U.S.A.

T this historic moment the democratic struggle for Negro lib-
A eration becomes one of the most important phases of the pro-
letarian revolutionary movement. In the development of the Negro
liberation battle there are unlimited potentialities and it is not im-
possible that this struggle can spearhead the whole proletarian
revolutionary struggle. What is today happening in Washington,
D. C. in the hearing on Bilbo indicates that the Negro movement is
ripe for the most far-reaching leaps forward and that the tempo of ‘
its development can be rapidly accelerated. F
Such a situation as this demands that we increase our work in the
South manifold. We must formulate a clear program and per-
spective. We must not forget that at earlier moments of high politi-
cal tension the Negro movement was diverted into a “Back to Africa”
utopian gesture and a “49th state” monstrosity. Such abortions can
take place again if the initiative is seized by Negro nationalist dem- ‘
agogues or if separatist movements are incited by American imperi- ‘
alist machinations. Monopoly capital is more deeply concerned
by the unrest of the Negro people than some of us seem to realize. I
A deeper study of the South is very urgent for our Party. Out of 1
a thorough study of the “Report on Economic Conditions of the
South,” made to Roosevelt by the National Emergency Council,
would come material for a whole series of realistic demands which
would speed up the movement of the poor whites. It is action alone
of the most realistic character which involves both poor white and
poorer Negro that will cement the unity of all anti-imperialist forces
in the South. During the Reconstruction era this unity was achieved
around the struggle for the land. That battle was lost. But the land
hunger remains as the revolutionary core of the Negro liberation
movement. It is fundamental to a solution of the evils from which
poor whites suffer. It can and must be made today the major point
in our program in the South. Land is the road to freedom.
The plantation system must be broken up. Many white forces in

the South now dormant will respond to such a drive as is now de-
stroying Junkerism in Eastern Europe. Victory here means a destruc-
tive blow would be struck at one of the main forces of American
fascism. The program of action demanded by this perspective has
to be worked out at once.

The struggle of the Negro people for the land is inseparably
related to the struggle for representative government. But repre-
sentative government for Negroes in the South means in its real sig-
niﬁcance self-government. Representative government in the Black
Belt is self-government because of the existence of a Negro majority
and because of the demogogic control landlordism has on the think-
ing of the white population. Self-government is logical. It will come
as a natural step under the present objective conditions. It will be
acceptable to poor whites.

One comrade says the demand for the right of self-determina-
tion will create animosity between the poor whites and Negroes.
The opposite is true. The demand for the right of self-determina-
tion will answer the 1andlords' lies that poor whites are threatened by
the menace of Negro domination. By bringing forward the slogan of
the right of self-deterrnination the poor white is assured that the Ne-
gro desires only the land which of right belongs to him. There is no
threat of domination here. By developing the struggle of the poor
white for land, the poor white can see that he too can, in an alliance
with the Negro, secure the land which of right belongs to him, and
from which he was driven into the hills by the slave landlords. The
poor white can be made to see that the right of self-determination
brings the Negro directly against the landlord who is the poor
white’s historic enemy. The poor white can be shown that his rights
in the Black Belt will be scrupulously respected.

Our slogans for the South must deal with the smashing of the
remnants of a slave economy. Our program must deal with the break-
up of the plantation system and the granting of representative gov-
ernment to the Negro people. Our draft resolution correctly holds
that the white masses of the South are beginning to ally themselves
on a signiﬁcant scale with the Negro people in their common ﬁght
against the trusts and against the Bilbos, Rankins and Talmadges.
That alliance will be quickened in tempo when the lies of the Bilbos,
Rankins and Talmadges are smashed and the fears these lies have
engendered in the white masses removed.

In the South the slogan for equal rights, used alone, obscures the
revolutionary character of the Negro liberation movement. It be-
comes a tool of liberalism, guarantees no permanent gains, ultimately

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

worsens the relations of poor whites and the Negro people, seri-

ously weakens the Negro movement as an aid to the proletarian class '

struggle, and in fact emasculates the movement of the Negro people.
It would be impermissible under the present conditions of anti-
Negro hysteria to launch this slogan in the South unaccompanied by
the slogan of the right of self—determination.\ Those who dismiss this
slogan express distrust of the white masses of the North as well as
South. It is a denial of the lessons of Reconstruction. It is therefore
un—Marxian and can lead only to greater terror against the Negro
people in the Black Belt and elsewhere.

To some of our comrades it has to be said that a nation can be
a nation in itself and not be a nation for itself. The question of a
nation becoming conscious of its nationhood is determined and
conditioned by the character of its growth and maturity into nation-
hood. The Negro people became a separate nation in the" process of
an abortive struggle to be included as an integral part of the oppress-
ing nation. That is a fact we must fully understand. Therein lies the
dialectics of the question. The Negro people became a nation in the
heart of a state for whose independence they as slaves had desperately
fought. The freedom of the Negro was a task of the glorious revolu-
tionary struggle against British toryism. Negro slaves fought for the
realization of American independence. Out of that struggle a new
state emerged and in that struggle a nation was developed. That
nation was white. In the American state we saw the continued en-
slavement of the Negro as one of the means of creating a primitive
accumulation. The Negro was not freed and did not nor could he
at that historic moment and under those objective conditions become
a member of this ﬁrst American nation. This is in answer to the
question concerning the development of the white nation and the
American bourgeois state.

The Negro as a slave expressed the aspirations of all peoples for
freedom. In fact in this early period the Negro gave to America some
of its richest traditions of struggle. The Negro aspired not only for
freedom but for full integration into the then only American nation.
Even under slavery the Negro in America became more and more
an amalgam of Europe and Africa in America. A new people were
being born in this bourgeois state.

Slave economy was, by its division of labor, creating the embryo
of classes among the slaves. Struggles for freedom were creating a
common psychological outlook. The development of cotton culture
in the Black Belt was creating a homeland for these new people. A
common language was being learned. All of the historic factors-

58

 

 

WILLIAM L. PATTERSON

economic, political and social—which brought into being the white
nation were imposing themselves upon the Negro. The maturing of
the second bourgeois democratic revolution was creating the pre-
condition for the absorption of the Negro into the American nation.

The second revolution also failed. It was betrayed. Whereas
after the ﬁrst bourgeois democratic revolution the forces of capi-
talism were not strong enough to eliminate slavery, to end the plan-
tation system and thereby bring the Negro into the ﬁrst nation, now
the demands of the American bourgeoisie after the Civil War for
raw materials, particularly cotton, brought an alliance of capital
and the landlords. The Negro was again left out in the cold.

But a class structure had been prepared in the Negro ranks. From
these classes emerged leaders who called for varied programs and the
Negro went on to realize a common economic life, the last remaining
attribute of nationhood needed to make of this new people a second
nation in this American state. The betrayal by capitalism, led by the
Republican Party, of some aspects of the second bourgeois revolution
could prevent the Negro people being absorbed into the ﬁrst nation
developed here in America, but nothing could stop the process that
was molding the Negro people into nationhood.

The aspirations of the Negro for integration into the existing
nation obscured this fact. The Negro people had no consciousness
of a realized nationhood because their eyes were ﬁxed and remained
ﬁxed on integration. It is wrong, as one comrade does, to subordinate
program to consciousness, negate a historical process because con-
sciousness is absent. What kind of an argument is this? Applied to the
class struggle it would lead to disaster. But we must recognize that
applied to the Negro question it also leads to disaster, for a nation
that oppresses another nation cannot itself be free. In America this
means that the oppressed classes of the oppressing nation have no
future unless they consolidate an alliance with the Negronation in
its struggle for liberation. At this historical hour the road to the in-
ternationalism, to the integration of white and Negro nation on the
American scene lies through the realization of full nationhood by
the Negro American nation.

It has been said here that there has been no expression of nation-
alism from the Negro people. I answer: analyze the Garvey Move-
ment, analyze the movement for a 49th State, analyze more thor-
oughly the Negro liberation organizations, and in all of these you
will ﬁnd expressions of a nation seeking freedom. The movements
were separatist movements against which we as Communists then

59

and now turn our faces. This is not revolutionary nationalism. The
demand for land is. '

The development of the liberation struggles generally will
sharpen all of the contradictions of American imperialism nationally
and also internationally. Unfortunately the draft resolution ignores
this feature of the Negro liberation movement. Yet here is one of
the most vital features of the Negro movement today. As Comrade
Ed Strong so eloquently pointed out here last night the Negro lib-
eration movement can buttress the movement of the Indian people
in South Africa, the ﬁght for the freedom of the Chinese people, for
it can expose the hypocrisy and absurdity of American imperialism
to pose as a champion of world freedom and world democracy. We
should approach the World Federation of Trade Unions to raise the
question of the oppression of the Negro people in America as one of
the most vital issues before world labor today. '

' The national ideology of American imperialism — its white
supremacy ideology — the source of its hate campaigns which split
white and black and develop religious hatreds will lose much of its
force for evil if we expose the character of the Negro as an oppressed
nation. We will thus weaken the ideology of Negro inferiority so
prevalent in school and church, press and radio, theater and movies.

In the North the slogan for equal rights will be the basic slogan.
A major feature of the program in the North must be the struggle to
destroy the ghetto. One of the strongest expressions of white
chauvinism lies in the failure of labor to make a real ﬁght on the
political front for Negro rights. For example, the continuation of
Negro ghetto life which labor has accepted is a burden upon pro-
gressive America. The ghetto in the North is comparable in some
degree to the land question in the South. The ghetto represents, not
the remnants of slavery in the North, but the penetration of the slave
ideology to the North and its acceptance there. This must be re-
ﬂected in the resolution. The vitality of this lies in the fact that in
exposing it, accompanied by a complete analysis of ghetto life and
what it means, we will help the Negro people to see monopoly capital
and its role more clearly. Here then comes the signiﬁcance of the
ﬁght against’ restrictive covenants. We must smash the ghetto. The
ghetto is tied to the South and to the issue of the right of self-deter-
mination.

Now for a few points on the resolution. We must help the Negro
people to attain the full status of nationhood. The retardation of
this march affects every phase of American economy, politics and
culture. It weakens everywhere the struggles of the independent

60

 

WILLIAM L. PATTERSON

progressive forces in their‘ struggle against imperialist elements. It
prevents. the full weight of this great liberation struggle to be thrown
on the scales in the interests of world democracy. With this resolu-
tion we are opening up new vistas of struggle. We are releasing great
reserves of progress, reserves not only available to the American
movement but reserves as well for the international struggle for
freedom and against world reaction.

Joseph Stalin, whose theoretical and practical con-
tribution towards the free development of nationalities
is a basic feature ofhis successful application. of Leni-nist
theory, here sets forth the ABC's of. the national
question.

His rich understanding of the historical situation of
the oppressed peoples, coupled with his mastery of the
general theory of Marx and Lenin, ‘enables him. to de-
velop a socialist nationality policy which harmonizes the
internationalism of the working class with the realities
of national peculiarities and historical development.

/ "The Bolshevilc. approach, from the beginning, of the
century, through the February and October Revolutions ‘
of 1917 and the establishment of Soviet power, to the
present day is expressed i.n numerous reports, articles
and speeches. How Stalin insists on a firm but’ tactful
application of Bolshevik policy toward. peoples who
suffered oppression under the Tsar, yet simultaneously
guards against nationalist excesses which violate the
tenets of proletarian intemationalism, is demonstrated
in numerous reports and speeches presented at a wide
variety of conferences. A

A T THE end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, while reaction
was intensifying its ﬁerce attack against the oppressed Negro
people and the working class, another event captured the heart of
progressive America and aroused the sympathetic interest of demo-
cratic—minded people the world over. That event was the epoch-mak-
ing campaign to oust the self-avowed klansman, Theodore Bilbo,
from the U.S. Senate. Numerous factors had helped to bring about
the temporary non—seating of Bilbo on the opening day of the 80th
Congress, on January 3, 1947. But no single factor was as important
as the political role and militancy of the Negro people themselves.

During the past ﬁfteen years the country has witnessed the steady
advance of the Negro liberation movement. At the beginning of
this period the Negro people broke with the Republican party after
65 years of support and turned to the Roosevelt New Deal. To a
considerable extent the movement of the Negro people developed
along independent political lines, often in alliance with organized
labor. During the 30’s Negro America was aroused by the world-wide
Scottsboro campaign which was initiated by the Communists after
their entry in the South, armed with the Marxist understanding of
the national character of Negro oppression. In this period hundreds
of thousands of Negro workers joined the C.I.O. and other trade
unions and together with white workers participated in numerous
struggles and strikes.

During World War II, one million Negro servicemen and mil-
lions in war factories and on the home front gave unstintingly to win
the war against the fascist axis despite the continuing national

A oppression, Jim Crowism and insults placed-in their way. Since V-]

Day with tremendous mass layoffs of Negroes from war plants and
the renewed lynch terror, have found the Negro people ﬁghting back
to retain their hard—won gains and seeking closer association with
the labor movement and white progressives. However, hesitation by
labor to act boldly and the prevalence of the imperialist poison of

5

COMMUNIST POSITION ON THE NEGRO QUESTION

white chauvinism in labor’s ranks has helped to create the danger
of the growth of petty bourgeois nationalism and other reactionary
and social democratic tendencies among the Negro people.

During this period various types of mass organizations have
been built up among the Negro people, with the most powerful,
the NAACP, having passed the 500,000 mark in membership. The
militant National Negro Congress added another chapter to its strug-
gle for Negro liberation in its petition to the United Nations on
behalf of the 13 million oppressed Negro citizens of the United
States, which won a wide and sympathetic response among the Negro
people. All of these developments testify to the burning desire of
the Negro people to achieve full citizenship and full participation
in American life. It is an expression toward national consciousness
as well as of the warmest sympathy and solidarity with the colonial
peoples and oppressed nations throughout the world.

This militant upsurge of the Negro people is best dramatized by
their actions in the Black Belt area and throughout the South. The
presence of Negroes testifying against Senator Bilbo in the Black
Belt city of Jackson, Miss., in December 1946, epitomized the un-
quenchable century—old strivings of the Negro people to land, demo-
cratic rights and freedom. The testimony of the Mississippi Negroes
in Jackson reflected the ﬁghting spirit of the hundreds of thousands
of Negroes who despite obstacles voted in the 1946 Democratic
primaries in many of the Southern States for the ﬁrst time in over
half a century. It reﬂected the growing desire of virtually all sections
of the Negro people in the South for a united Negro people’s front—
a spirit reminiscent of Reconstruction days.

Alongside of and stimulated by this great upsurge among the
Negro people is another development in the South of supreme im-
portance, namely the growing solidarity among Negro and white
workers. This is best seen in the labor movement, in the organizing
drive and strike struggles, although there is still room for consider-
able improvement. Not only white workers, but sections of the white
middle class have recently spoken out against the Ku Klux Klan and
the lynch terror and have joined in other solidarity actions. Examples
of this‘ are the actions of the Baptists and other religious denomina-
tions among white Southerners, the magniﬁcent work of the South-
ern Conference for Human Welfare, and the pact of Southern white
and Negro youth for a better South, signed at the Southern Youth
Legislature at Columbia, S.C., held under the auspices of the South-
ern Negro Youth Congress.

It would be criminal foolishness to underestimate the prevalence

6

 

 

NAT ROSS

of chauvinism among white Southerners, or to underestimate the
desperate activities of the K.K.K. .and other fascist organizations
supported by the absentee owned Wall Street corporations in the
South and the Bourbon plantation owners. Nevertheless, what is new
and dynamic in the South is the growing recognition among various
groups and sections of white Southerners that the South as a whole
will remain depressed as long as the Negroes are oppressed. This
thought was editorially expressed in the Macon, Georgia News, a
newspaper which, by and large, expresses the viewpoint of the
liberal bourgeoisie in the South and their political spokesmen
such as Senator Pepper, Governors Folsom and Arnall and Justice
Black. The lengthy editorial condemns the plans of the Talmadgeites
to exclude Negroes from voting in the democratic primaries and
states: “Furthermore, denial to the Negro of the rights of citizenship
is foolish. It hurts us. We cannot hold the Negro down without in-
jury to ourselves. His well-being and prosperity increase our own.
Our welfare is inseparable from his. We cannot keep a third of our
population in bondage without being ourselves dragged down to
the same low level.”

The coming period in the South will call for much greater unity
and solidarity. The Republican majority in Congress (despite cer-
tain demagogic maneuvers with regard to the Negroes) are preparing
to put over a reactionary program on labor and social legislation, on
taxes, tariffs, etc., which will deepen the existing unequal status of
the South with the rest of the nation. Despite friction between
them the Bourbon Democrats will basically cooperate with the Wall
Street Republicans in this reactionary offensive in Congress. This
unholy combination will also strive to widen the industrial wage
differential between South and North and bring back the dollar a
day wages on the Black Belt cotton plantation. This program will
hasten the coming of the cyclical economic crisis in the United
States and its special more disastrous effects on the already doubly
oppressed Negro nation in the Black Belt, as well as the impover-
ished white workers of the South.

This basic common bond between the Wall Street Republicans
and the Bourbon oppressors of the Negro people in the Black Belt
must be broken and defeated. It can be done if the labor movement
and the progressive forces throughout the country will recognize
the essential fact that the struggle for national liberation of the
Negro people is a prerequisite to any fundamental progress in the
nation as a whole.

The material in this pamphlet consists of the resolution on the
