open until November 1st so as to enable all Party organizations to
participate fully during the month of October in the national elec-
tion campaign.

This Resolution proposes far-reaching changes in our program,
practices and outlook. We believe these changes are necessary if we
are to meet the new situation that confronts us. We feel it will
provide a focus for the discussion through which the membership
will be able to make their views effective. We hope that this Re-
solution, shaped and amended as it will be by the membership, by
the clubs, counties and state and National organizations in‘ the
course of the discussion, will provide a basis for our Party to con-
solidate its ranks, strengthen its mass work and open a new chapter
in its record of service to the American working class and people.

Our pre-convention discussion will be unfolding against the
background of important struggles of the American -people. It will
be truly fruitful only if it strengthens our participation in‘ these
current struggles and draws renewed inspiration from them. The
National Committee calls for an intensiﬁcation of all mass activities
of the Party as the discussion proceeds.

Comradely yours,

National Committee

FOREWORD

‘ We open our pre-convention discussion against the background
of profound change on the world scene and many favorable de-
velopments at home.

The pulse of our people is quickened with high hope that the
world is entering an era that can bring lasting peace, freedom and
equality and an end to poverty and oppression.

This hope is rooted in reality. Out of World War II and the
peoples” strivings of the postwar period have come great transfor-
mations, and more are in the making.

The defeat of fascism, to which our own country contributed,
opened the way to the liberation of hundreds of millions. The peo-
ple of China, whose land had for so long been the prey of foreign
exploiters, and the countries of Eastern Europe took the path of
socialism, along which the Soviet Union had blazed the trail.
Socialism emerged as a world system embracing a third of mankind
—a system which based its relations with the capitalist states on the
perspective of peaceful economic competition and coexistence.

Nearly another third of mankind, in former colonial lands
such as India and Indonesia, won their freedom from imperialism.
Increasingly they pursued a course of neutrality and non-alignment
in the cold war. They joined with other Asian and African nations
at the historic Bandung Conference and endorsed the principles
of peaceful coexistence and national independence for all peoples
and states.

A new world situation and a new relationship of forces have
come into being. America is part of this vast process of change. A
gigantic united labor movement has been ‘born, a tower of growing
strength in the whole democratic struggle. The Negro people are
on the march as they have not been since Reconstruction days.
Together with many white citizens they are writing new imperish-

9

 
  

able pages in the history of the ﬁght for American freedom. Atomic
energy and new technological developments are revealing unpre-
cedented possibilities of -peaceful progress and a life of abundance
for all. '

The American people stand on the threshold of great demo-
cratic advance. In crossing this thresho1d—and it can be crossed
only by the most determined and united struggle—there is lost
ground to be recovered as well as ground to be won. There are
new vistas of peace; of a successful struggle against poverty and
economic insecurity; of progress in housing, health and education;
of securing full citizenship for the Negro people, undoing the evils
of McCarthyism and Eastlandism, and achieving new gains for
democracy.

As we look back to December 1950, when the last convention
of the Communist Party was held, we can see how far our country
and the world have moved.

At that time the war in Korea was at its height. The McCarran
Act had just taken its place alongside the anti-labor Taft-Hartley
Act. A divided labor movement had suffered a new political defeat
in the November Congressional elections. The Supreme Court was
soon to uphold the Smith Act convictions of Comrades Dennis,
Winston and the other National Board members. Reaction was
pressing its assault upon the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Throughout the world, the men of Wall Street were prosecuting
the cold war with mounting vigor.

Our Party at its 15th Convention nevertheless saw that there
were forces at work in our country and abroad that could save
America and the world from disaster. Asserting its conﬁdence in
those forces, it proclaimed: “Peace Can Be Won.”

Today international tension has eased and the war danger,
though still present, has been reduced. The Geneva summit con-
ference registered the possibility of ending the cold war, shar-ply
cutting armaments and achieving peaceful coexistence.

Rampant McCarthyism has been checked and the deep demo-
cratic sentiments of the American people are reasserting them-
selves. Though Smith Act prosecutions continue and the McCarran
Act still threatens American liberties, the wave of repressions, fed
by war hysteria, is becoming increasingly unpopular.

{Any great new ‘advance today, ‘however, inevitably encounters
the real enemy‘ of peace, progress and -democracy—the giant mono-
polies which have -become ever more powerful during these‘same
years; ~

_These are the same corporations that in the thirties plunged
ouricountry into the worst economic disaster in our history. They
aided and abetted theiise of ‘Hitler and the axis and engaged in
a proﬁt orgy during World War II. ‘They are the same corporations
that during the past decade were responsible for the reactionary
foreign policy whose symbol was the cold war. They are the corpo-
rations that today breed poverty and insecurity for millions of
Americans, gouge the farmers and drive small and medium size
business to the wall. They are the economic beneﬁciaries from the
many-sided discrimination against and economic robbery of the
Negro tenth of our population.

These monopolies are the real enemy of America. Only through
united ‘action against them can our people move forward toward
realizing their aspirations.

We Communists in the future as in the past will seek to con-
tribute our utmost to the realization of these aspirations. As ad-
vocates of socialism, we shall—in the course of the struggle against
the trusts—help the American working-class and people in their
great majority come to see that these aspirations can be completely
and permanently fulﬁlled only by a basic change in the economic
system. This will require the replacement of the system of proﬁts
for the few with a system of production owned by the people and
operated for the use of all.

For a number of months we Communists have been re-examin-
ing our policies and our methods of work and organization. This
reappraisal is necessary -because we, like other orward-looking
political forces in America, have begun to see that there is a new
situation in our country and in the world today. We need to study
this new situation, summoning the full measure of our collective
understanding as Marxists. We need to determine what it means as
regards certain theoretical propositions and past policies and forms
of organization.

There is, however, a further compelling reason that adds urgency

to this reappraisal. It lies in the fact that although we have made .

ll

many important contributions to the struggles of the American
working class and people and have stood up honorably under
intense -political persecution, we have made a number of errors
over the years. These errors need to be rectiﬁed and the necessary
conclusions drawn therefrom if we are to measure up to the great
responsibilities which confront our Party and the working class
in the period ahead, a period that will be marked by big political
and economic struggles on the home front.

I
THE SITUATION TODAY

For a Prosperous America; for an End to Poverty;
for a New Program of Social Advance

Production, total employment and proﬁts in 1956 are at boom
levels. For the past decade, this country has enjoyed a postwar
period of relative prosperity. Since 1947, despite temporary declines,
industrial production has risen by 42%.

Corporate proﬁts before taxes jumped from $423.5 billion in
1946 to an annual rate of $43.6 billion in the ﬁrst half of 1956.

And by mid-19546, employment reached a record level of 661/2 mil-

lion.

Underlying this high level of the economy is a high rate of
investment in ﬁxed capital throughout the postwar period, moti-
vated by the need to replace obsolete and worn equipment, by the
requirements. of large-scale arms production, and by technological
advances. Added to this is, in recent years, a large investment in
inventory accumulation.

No small part has been played by arms expenditures, which
during the Korean war hit a p_eak rate of $55 billion a year, and
are today running at an annual rate of some $41 billion.

Another factor is the boom in housing construction. Since 1949,
non-farm housing starts have averaged well over a million a year.
Still another is the steady growth in consumer credit, which now
stands at a peak of over $36 billion.

For much of the "postwar period, production was sparked chieﬂy
by expanding arms budgets. Since 1954, however, a new upsurge
has taken place, this time with no increase in military spending,
but stimulated instead by tax rebates and giveaways, and by a huge
credit inﬂation. The American economy today has taken on much
of the aspect of a speculative peacetime ‘boom, reminiscent in some
respects of that of "the twenties.

A But the boom has by no means brought prosperity for all. The
past several years have seenpfarm incomes falling by one-third-be
tween 1947 and the middle of 1956. The Department of Agricul-

I3

 

 

  
  

ture reports that in terms of pufchasing power the net income of
farmers in 1955 was lower than “in any year since 1940.

The number of small and family-size farms has declined while
the “biggest operators and corporation farms have grown. This
agricultural depression is persistent and represents a heavy eco-
nomic burden on the shoulders of the small marginal and family-
size operators. _The outbreak of a general economic crisis would
have a catastrophic effect on the small farmers, for never in the
nation's history was the agricultural economy so closely bound up
with the industrial and ﬁnancial life, and never was it under suc_
sharp pressure from monopoly. T’

One-ﬁfth of a nation suffers poverty in the midst of plenty;
one family in ﬁve earns less than $2,000 a year-that is, less than
$40 a week. Among Negro families, the proportion is more than
two in ﬁve. Ten million American children live in slums." The
country has a number of depressed areas suffering high unemploy-
ment. 4 A 5 _

During 1956 the cost of living, which appeared to have reached
a plateau, resumed’ its upward movement and is now at its highest
point in history. ' T’ ‘

Despite record levels of employment, the rise production
since 1954‘ has brought no corresponding rise in factory‘ employ-
ment. And the past months have witnessed a‘ growth of unemploy-
ment in the auto and farm equipment industries. With the further
extension of automation, unemployment is ‘likely’ to increase.

Nor has small business ﬂourished in the recent period, In, fact,
bankrupt-cies of small business ventures have been on the rise.

The chief beneﬁciaries of the boom have been the giant trusts
and monopolies. The year 1955, says Fortune, was "very deﬁnitely
the best year ever for big business.”

The monopolies have continued -to grow and to become ever
more powerful. Today, the 500 largest industrial corporations
account for about half of all production and employment. These
giants rake in the lion's share of the proﬁts. In the ﬁrst quarter of
1956, proﬁts per dollar of sales for the biggest companies (those
with assets of $100,000,000 or more) were nearly ﬁve times those
of the smaller companies (with assets under $250,000). And under
the Cadillac Cabinet, with its giveaways and its policies favoring
big business, mergers are taking placeat a higher rate than ever
before. ' ‘ ' '°

14

 

 

 The enormous proﬁts of the trusts are obtained at the expense
of the workers, the small farmers and small business. Their growing

‘stranglehold on the economy increases further the imbalance be-

tween «production and the market.

Such is the present-day prosperity.

How long will it last? The Eisenhower Administration and big
business spokesmen maintain that prosperity has become a perma-
nent feature of the American scene. “Adjustments” may occur, but
crises, they say, are a thing of the past. They assert that the govern-
ment, through its capacity to intervene and to “manage” the econ-
omy, can prevent any major disaster.

But this theory rests on a most shaky foundation. Thus, for the
past six months, although industrial production has failed to rise,
inventories have mounted. Nevertheless, in the face of this situa-
tion, capital investment continues to expand.

This does not mean that a crisis is around the corner. In fact,
there may well 'be an upturn in production prior to the onset of
the next recession. But it does indicate that the expansion of
capital investment—-the very. factor on which the high level of the
economy -principally rests, is aggravating the imbalance between
productive capacity and the market. The underlying instability
of the economy is in-creased, and the factors making for a cyclical
economic crisis continue to operate. The boom, with its growing
credit inﬂation, only’ conceals the sharpening contradiction between
the forces of production and the capitalist relations of production
-a contradiction which can only be ﬁnally resolved in the people’-s
inte-rest through the establishment of a socialist society.

The economy may be givennew shots in the arm. There may
be new rises in production, especially if foreign trade is expanded
by such measures as the removal of trade barriers between our
country and the Socialist world. ' A '

There are also many new features in the economy which have an
important -bearing on the frequency and depth‘ of the cyclical
crisis which we need to examine.

. The National‘ Committee proposes that a special commission
make a study of the total economic outlook in light of such new
features. ‘  -. ..

But there is no foundation for Wall Street-inspired i-llusions
of permanent prosperity.‘ -

In this day of ' automation and-.2 rapid technological change,

labor faces new and more acute problems. Though production
today is at a higher point than a few years ago, factory employment
has fallen off. Among industrial workers, there is a growing sense
of job insecurity and mounting pressure for the thirty-hour week
without reduction in take home pay. There are intensiﬁed prob-
lems of speedup and deterioration of working conditions. In many
industries the runaway shop evil is reaching more and more serious
proportions.

To meet these problems there is a new, strengthened labor
movement, growing out of the merger of the AFL and CIO. This
historic merger, proceeding in the first place from the growing
unity demands among the members, was the outstanding positive
labor development of the past decade. In ending twenty years of
division, the AFL-CIO entered a new and higher stage in the pro-
cess of unifying the American workers. The merger has strength-
ened la-bor’s ability to defend its economic and political interests
and thereby has increased its contribution to the life of the nation.

Within the labor movement the ﬁrst fruits of unity are already
becoming apparent in the lessening of jurisdictional disputes, the
decline in raiding, a greater degree of solidarity and -mutual aid in
economic struggles, and the first tentative plans for undertaking
the organization of the unorganized in the South.

There are, however, a number of important unresolved issues
within the leadership of the AFL-CIO. These include such ques-
tions as new demands of the craft union leadership that would
weaken the industrial unions; differences on political action, in-
volving attitude toward the two major parties, as -well as the degree
of participation of the union membership in political and legis-
lative struggles. The issues still to be fought out also encompass
the question of a democratic foreign policy and peaceful coex-
istence as well as the whole ﬁeld of the rights of Negro workers.

In the struggle around these issues alignments are still in pro-
cess of developing and will undoubtedly continue to do so for a
considerable time.

However, the merger ‘-has already strengthened the hand and
multiplied the voice of the labor movement in the halls of Con-
gress, within the political parties and among the people generally.

Organized labor has developed a“ comprehensive program to
combat poverty, to improve social welfare, to aid the farmers and
small business. In formulating _this program it is recognizing its

16

 

responsibility to the nation in this age of atomic energy and auto-
matlon.

We Communists endorse and support the forward looking
domestic and legislative proposals of the labor movement and other
democratic organizations for economic betterment and social wel-
fare. It is through struggle for such a program and the forging of
unity around it that the workers and the people generally can ad-
vance their own interests against the opposition of the monopolies
and the administration which they dominate.

The age of automation and the atom stands in glaring contra-
diction to widespread poverty, to inadequate educational and
health facilities, and to growing job insecurity and fear of the
future. But to fulﬁll the promise of plenty which automation and
atomic energy hold forth will require concerted struggle by labor
and its allies against the trusts. In the course of such struggles, if
Communists and other socialist-minded Americans work effectively,
the working people of this country can achieve a fuller understand-
ing of the need of a socialist economy as the only basic answer to
their problems. -

For Peaceful Co-Existence and an End A
to the Cold War

Having lived for a decade under the threat of atomic war, the
American people, like peoples everywhere, deeply desire to enjoy
in peace the great beneﬁts which they rightfully demand of the
COmlng atomic age.

Today, they are becoming ever more conﬁdent that this desire
can be realized. The prospect has opened up of bringing the cold
war to an end and ushering in a new era of peaceful coexistence
and competition of different social systems.

Soon after World War II, the giant corporations which domi-
nate American political and economic life set about trying to
extend their domination to the rest of the world. They caused our
government to scrap FDR’s policy of American-Soviet friendship
and Big Three unity for peace. They also brought about the
scuttling of FDR’s “good neighbor" policy in Latin America, which
despite serious limitations, had curbed aggressive intervention and
developed better relations with the peoples of that area. Acting

*7

 

 

through the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations, the economic
royalists replaced these policies with one of atom-bomb diplomacy,
military alliances, war bases, and active intervention in the internal
affairs of other countries. Under the pretext of “defense” against
a mythical “Soviet menace” they built up a very proﬁtable arms
economy at home.

This policy had its domestic counterpart in the smog of intimi-
dation and conformity that polluted American life, in the perse-
cutions, repressions and witch-hunts that steadily eroded the Bill
of Rights. The pall of McCarthyism grew until it threatened to
blot out American «liberties.

Over the years Wall Street’s war-like, anti-American policy
suffered one setback after another. Our country became isolated,
its good name dishonored. Aggressive acts and threats of “massive
retaliation” precipitated differences with our “allies.” The newly
independent nations of Asia refused to toe the State Department
and Pentagon line. A great people's peace movement embracing
hundreds of millions all over the world, insisted on an end to the
cold war and the settlement of differences through negotiations.
The Soviet Union refused to behave in accordance with the myth
of “Soviet aggression,” and instead the socialist countries. directed
all their efforts toward preventing war and achieving peaceful
coexistence.

The growing crisis in American foreign policy ﬁnally reached
the point where in July 1955 the Eisenhower Administration was
compelled to drop its opposition to great power negotiations, meet
with the Soviet Union at Geneva, and formally renounce the use
of force _to resolve differences.

The changed world situation, symbolized by Geneva, came
about because the American people, no less ﬁrmly than other peo-
ples, refused to accept the prospect of atomic annihilation. In 1952
they elected Eisenhower on the strength of his pledge to stop the
war in Korea; in 1954 they vetoed Nixon's plan to use American
troops in_ Indochina; in 1955 they quashed the Dulles-Rad-ford
provocations around Quemoy and Matsu.

And Geneva was also made possible because the American 'peo~
ple refused to bow to McCarthyism, but instead, through their
struggles in 1953 and 1954, administered serious defeats to the
McCarthyites and ‘began the still incomplete process of restoring

the Bill of Rights.

Now there has come into being a vast “zone of peace," embrac-

‘ ing socialist and non-socialist peace-seeking states populated by

well over half the human race. And this “zone of peace” may also
be said to include the peoples of all other countries irrespective
of the policies of their governments.

The pressures that brought Eisenhower to the Summit meeting
are today stronger than ever. They are producing an “agonizing
reappraisal” on the part of big business and of various political
circles. '

It is widely recognized that the bankrupt and dangerous Dulles
diplomacy of “massive retaliation” and “brink of war” has brought
American prestige to a new low. Inﬂuentialvspokesmen are casting
about for the means of restoring this prestige and counteracting
the recurring Soviet and Chinese proposals for disarmament, trade,
and cultural relations. The foreign policy debate continues amidst
much confusion, shifting and partisan maneuvering. Among the
trends reﬂected are in 'broad outline the following:

A. Certain of the most reactionary ﬁnancial and political circles
openly oppose Geneva and ﬂatly reject peaceful negotiations, trade,
and coexistence, especially with. China. They want to heat up the
cold war and compel the “allies,” the neutrals and the UN to toe
the line. Their ultimate aim is a fascist Fortress America, equipped
with overwhelming superiority in air-atomic arms. In its crudest
form this is the‘ view of the McCarthy-Jenner-Eastland forces and
in a more reﬁned form, of Knowland and of Nixon. It inﬂuences
some of the Dulles bluff-and-bluster policies. Its virulent anti-So-
vietism ﬁnds an echo in the utterances of a number of leading
Democrats. .

B. The predominant Wall Street forces, whose policies are
reﬂected in the Eisenhower wing of the GOP and most of the
Democratic leadership, still favor a continuation in somewhat
altered form of the main features of the cold war—especially the
arms budgets, NATO and the like. But with varying emphasis they
call for greater ﬂexibility in relations with the “allies" and neutrals
as the international struggle shifts more and more to the economic
and ideological plane. Nor do they close the door altogether to
negotiating some partial steps to disarmament.

C. Some spokesmen for Big Business (Lippmann, Eaton, Fland-
ers, Bowles) appear to go farther. They put their main stress on
the shift to economic competition and Point 4, while advocating

‘*9

  
 
 

the retention of the arms budget. They favor increased trade and
exchange, and continued efforts to achieve some progress towards
disarmament.

Meanwhile, the American people at the grass-roots are making
their own reappraisal. The result is a rising peace demand which
insistently calls upon the United States to take further steps to
reduce tensions, promote East-West trade and exchange, halt the
arms race, suspend A- and H-bomb tests, and support the colonial
peoples in their demand for liberation.

War is not inevitable, though the danger still exists. Imperialism
breeds this danger, as shown again in the Suez crisis. Nor have the
big trusts and corporations given up their aim of world domina-
tion. But the danger of war has considerably subsided. This is the
main feature of the present situation.

This feature can be a powerful stimulant to the people's strug-
gle to unfold the new era of peaceful co-existence and end the cold
war altogether. This struggle will also be accelerated, and the myth
of the “Soviet menace" further dissipated, as our people come to
understand the profound changes and corrections of serious errors
now taking place in the socialist countries. It will also be helped
by the new initiative displayed in Soviet foreign policy, correcting
past weaknesses and improving relations with other countries. This
is already beginning to exert a favorable inﬂuence on the attitude
toward «peaceful negotiations and coexistence in labor and liberal
ranks. '

The immediate outlook is for the further growth of broad
popular movements on speciﬁc peace issues. Inﬂuential groups in
women's, church, Negro, farm, youth and other organizations are
calling for concrete steps toward universal disarmament, especially
for an immediate ban on A— and H-bomb tests. These and other
United Nations supporters are asking that that body be strength-
ened by the admission of China.

The unprecedented rise of the Negro people's movement is
closely linked with rising sympathy and support for the liberation
struggles of the colonial peoples in Africa and elsewhere.

In the labor movement there. has been growing differentiation
on foreign policy and peace within the past few years. On the one
hand certain national leaders have adopted an aggressive and rigid
anti-coexistence, anti-Geneva position. On the other hand, the
sentiment of the majority of the rank and ﬁle has found expression

in varying degree in the position of other leaders of important
international unions, and in a number of trade union publications.
These leaders and publications criticize the more aggressive aspects
of Washington’s foreign policy and urge negotiations, curbing the
A- and HJbombs, support of anti-colonial struggles, expanded for-
eign economic aid and various forms of peaceful competition with
the lands of socialism.

There is growing concern in the labor movement on the ques-
tion of economic aid to underdeveloped countries. In contrast to
Meany’s anti-coexistence position, Reuther’s 1o-point program for
aid envisages joint action through the UN by the USA and the
USSR. Such proposals, along with a program for expansion of
East-West trade and exchange of delegations, can win broad sup-
port in labor and liberal political circles.

Such -movements as these will bring to bear the inﬂuence of
la-bor and the other main sectors of the American people upon the
foreign and domestic policies of the new Administration and Con-

gress. They will help realize the new perspectives of peaceful
coexistence. -

For Full Economic, Political and Social Equality
for the Negro People

The new level achieved by the Negro people's freedom move-
ment during the past few years has made civil rights one of the
most dynamic issues in American political life today. This freedom
movement has stimulated a new political awakening among a
majority of the American people, who are recognizing the ines-
capable, urgent, democratic and moral responsibility to remove
from American national life the last remaining -barriers to first-
class citizenship for the 16,ooo,ooo American Negroes.

The Negro freedom movement is today -marked by such features
of historic signiﬁcance as: a) the increasingly active leadership role
being exercised by the Negro urban population in general and the
organized workers in particular; b) the focal point of the freedom
struggle is shifting to the urban centers of the Deep South, the re-
gion whose agrarian relations and institutions have historically
been the incubator of the whole odious system of oppression suf-

21

   

 

fered -by the Negro people, and c) the mounting anti—imperialist
struggles of the colored colonial peoples all over the world have
had a profound ideologi-cal impact on the Negro freedom move-
ment, its program and tactics, which in turn more and more iden-
tiﬁes itself with and contributes to the colonial liberation move-
ments.

Note must be taken, not only of the shift of the center of Negro
freedom struggle to the South, but of the important changes that
have taken place in the South during the past twenty years.

Under the stimulus of industrialization and urbanization, the

size of‘ the working class in the South has more than doubled;
and the number of white and Negro southern trade unionists now
approaches two million. Southern workers have learned impor-
tant lessons in Negro-white unity in the course of struggle for com-
mon economic advancement. The relations between the Negro
people and the white intellectuals and professionals in the South
have been strengthened, as well as between the South and the rest
of the United States. The impact of the moral weight of the Negro
question on the largely church-going population among white
southerners has been positive. The struggle for the democratic
right to vote spearheaded by the Negro people has stimulated an
advance in political activity among all the working people in the
South. ..
The situation in every southern state is today marked, politically,
by a growing cleavage between the Dixiecrat rulers, on the one
hand, and the Southern democratic majority who are compelled
to struggle against Dixiecratism, on the other. The forms vary from
state to state, but the content is everywhere the same.

The democratic gains won by the Negro people during the past
t-wo decades (including gains in literacy, union organization,
limited exercise of political rights, and certain material improve-
ments in living standards) provide the organizational, material and
cultural 'basis for the enhanced political role being played in the
life of our country by the Negro freedom movement and its
principal organization, the NAACP.

Negro-white solidarity movements are achieving great breadth
in various parts of the country. A number of big unions and lead-
ing church bodies are helping to organize concrete economic and
moral support for the Montgomery boycotters. The AFL-CIO has
announced a special committee to aid the South. Labor in general,

 

 

and the Textile Workers of America in particular, are taking
a ﬁrmer stand against the activities of the White Citizens Councils.

Nevertheless, there has not been any radical change in the
fundamental status of the Negro people as an oppressed people..
At this late date the average American Negro family is forced to
live on 44 percent less income than the average white family; the
rate of unemployment among Negroes is double that of whites.
This economic robbery produces the social consequences of higher
death-rate, generally poorer health, less opportunity for securing
wholesome food, decent housing, higher education and cultural
fulﬁllment. .

The absence or sharp restriction of political rights for Negroes
in the South, including the elementary democratic right to vote and
the right to representation on all levels of government; the over-
whelming inequality in educational opportunity which continues
more than two years after the Supreme Court decision; the dis-
proportionate landlessness of the Negro rural population; and
the humiliation and indignities which are the daily experiences

of the Negro people, limiting participation in the normal streams-

of human activity (admission in restaurants, hotels, etc.)—these
are the bitter facts of life that cannot be ignored.

Outside the South, although the oppression of the Negro does
not constitute a system of punitively enforced Jim Crow law, there
are no legislative safeguards to secure their rights as equal citizens‘.-
These conditions are marked by discrimination in employment,
wages and working conditions, Jim Crow housing in slums, in-
equalities in educational and social facilities and opportunities,
denial of ‘political representation, police ‘brutality and other indig-

nities which all emphasize that the struggle for Negro freedom

is nationwide.

The economic robbery, political subjugation, social ostracism
and frustrated cultural development of the Negro people consti-
tutes a special system of oppression maintained by monopoly capi-
talism. This system continues to be a more lucrative source of
proﬁt for Big Business than the latter’s multi-billion investments
in Latin America. The limited but important democratic gains
scored in the struggle for Negro freedom open up new possibilities
for further developing a fruitful alliance between the Negro people
and the democratic majority of the American people, led by or-
ganized labor. It opens up the possibilities for realizing the full

23

 

 

 

citizenship of the Negro people, for the preservation of the Bill
of Rights, for curbing the abuses and power of the monopolies and
for improvements in the material well-being of the entire popu-
lation.

The growing alliance between the Negro people and the labor
movement is one of the positive features of American life, with
great potentialities for the future. Labor needs to increase its par-
ticipation in the struggle for Negro rights as -part of the defense
of its own interests. More attention is also required to the up-
grading of Negroes in industry and the election and appointment
of Negroes to leading positions in trade unions. We believe too
that labor has the main responsibility for taking the initiative in
overcoming the strains and further strengthening the bonds in the
alliance with the Negro people.

A political crisis in Dixiecrat rule of historic signiﬁcance is
shaping up in the South. The Eastland-led Dixiecrat rebellion
against the Constitution and the Supreme Court desegregation
decision aims to maintain the poisonous political and ideological
inﬂuence of racism and white supremacy in the national life of
our country. The national positions of inﬂuence held by the
Dixiecrats—who are the servitors of the most reactionary sector of
monopoly capital-can only be maintained on the traditional basis
of violating the Constitutional and human rights of the Negro
people in particular and of the majority of the Southern popula-
tion in general.

From this historically developed set of circumstances flows the
Number One unﬁnished democratic task confronting the whole
American people, namely to win the battle for equal rights for the
Negro people and thereby open the way for a broad, new advance
for American democracy.

The healthy, democratic response which millions are giving
to the Negro people's demand for full freedom has generated a
mood of desperation among the Dixiecrats. They are actively at
work stirring up the most backward prejudices, inspiring _acts of
terrorism and murder, promoting racist ideas through the White
Citizens Councils, attempting to split the labor movement in the
South along racist lines, etc. The Dixiecrats aim to push back
the frontiers of progress and wipe out the democratic gains won
by the people in order to perpetuate their monopoly of political
power in the South. In this un-American effort they have found

24

 

 

common cause with the pro-fascist McCarthyites outside the South.

Our Party must play its indispensable role in implementing
a program of struggle for equal rights and democracy which in-
cludes:

a) Mobilizing national material, moral and ﬁnancial support to
the embattled Negro freedom forces in the South;

b) Helping to win universal suffrage for all in the South, with-
out restrictions;

c) Advancing the struggle for Negro re-presentation on all levels
of government;

(1) Helping to facilitate organized labor’s drive to organize
the unorganized in the South and to end the North-South wage
differential;

e) Organizing the rural poor;

f) Winning governmental measures to secure land and land
tenure for Negro sharecroppers, tenants and small owners.

On this basis, an effective national action program for Negro
equality could be worked out in the spirit of the slogan “Free by
'63.” It would seek Federal and state executive and legislative
action to guarantee the right to vote, equal job opportunities, se-
curity of person and property, an end to segregated schools,
housing and all other forms of discrimination and oppression of
the Negro people. It would prepare now to curb the Dixiecrat
filibusterers through a successful ﬁght to amend Senate Rule 22 on
the opening day of the new 85th Congress. It would organize to
guarantee a general break-through in Negro representation in local,
state and national elections in 1957 and 1958. Our Party pledges
its dedicated support to such a program. '

For the Defense of the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights

Looking back over the past ten years, the American people can
well take pride in the fact that their profound attachment to
democratic traditions remained basically intact throughout the
storm and stress of the post-war period. However, this needs to
be tempered with the realization that the vast damage done by
reaction to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is still to be re-

25.

 

 

paired and that powerful enemies of freedom—the Brownells and
Nixons, the Eastlands and McCarthys—are still at their subversive
work.

The year 1954 marked a certain turning-point. McCarthyism,
the most virulent expression of pro-fascist reaction, was checked.
A new political climate began to be reﬂected in the election de-
feats of the McCarthyites and their Administration «friends and in
the Senate censure of McCarthy. This in turn facilitated the
easing of world tensions at the Geneva Conference. It helped
make possible a number of signiﬁcant Supreme Court decisions
favorable to democratic liberties. It led to curbing some of the
worst excesses of Congressional, Administration and local witch-
hunting. It created a favorable atmosphere for the American people
to take the counter-offensive for civil liberties that the CIO called
for late in 1954.

The basic responsibility for the rise of McCarthyism and other
reactionary movements lay with the big trusts and their cold war
policies. To the myth of a “Soviet menace” abroad they joined
the myth of a “Communist conspiracy” at home. It was the
Truman Administration, as Dean Acheson recently acknowledged
in a frank admission of error, that ﬁrst opened the ﬂood-gates
with its “loyalty” program. Eisenhower and the Cadillac Cabi-
net took up where Truman left off, continuing the Smith Act
and McCarran Act prosecutions initiated by their predecessors.
Chieﬂy through Nixon and Brownell, they exploited for political
purposes McCarthy's main weapon, the “Communist conspiracy"
hoax, directing it at Truman himself.

That the menace of pro-fascist reaction has receded is due pri-
marily—in addition to the pressure of world democratic opinion-
to the great resurgence of democratic expressions by the American
people. A many-sided anti-McCarthy sentiment took shape in
1953 and 1954. A high point was the Joe-Must-Go movement
in Wisconsin. McCarthy soon became a political liability to the
Eisenhower Administration.

Since 1954, this resurgence has taken on a multitude of forms.
Outstanding have been the energetic campaign of the AFL-CIO
unions against the state “right-to-work” laws and the Taft-Hartley
Act; the broad movements for the repeal or revision of the Mc-
Carran-Walter Immigration Act; the rising opposition to “loyalty”
and “security” programs in industry and government; the Ameri-

26

 

 

can Association of University Professors’ defense of the right of
Communists to teach; the resolutions of many inﬂuential labor,
liberal and progressive organizations condemning the Smith Act
and the McCarran Act; the petition to cease Smith Act prose-
cutions and grant amnesty to Smith Act prisoners, sponsored by
Mrs. Roosevelt, Norman Thomas and A. J. Muste. But within this,
a considerable gap still exists between the extent and level of the
movement for defense of civil liberties in the broad sense, and the
much more limited scope of the ﬁght against the attacks on the
Communist Party itself—attacks which are far from ended.

i Moreover, the democratic resurgence confronts new challenges
today, has the drive of reaction continues. The Dixiecrats have or-
ganized. the White Citizens Councils to advocate and practice
force and violence against the Negro people and the Constitution.
They then proceeded to outlaw the NAACP in a number of
Southern states. Dixiecratism allies itself with McCarthyism in the
Eastland-McCarthy-Jenner conspiracy. Their immediate aim is to
intimidate the Supreme Court (now preparing to review the Smith
Act), block enforcement of the desegregation decision and demand
of the next Congress legislation to nullify that historic ﬁnding as
well as the vital verdict against state sedition laws. “Meanwhile,
the ‘big anti-labor corporations are seeking to spread the “right-to-
work” laws from the South to such labor centers as the state of
Washington.

Thus the defense of the Communists, whose Smith Act con-
victions are now on appeal in the Supreme Court or in lower
courts, is an integral part of the defense of trade union rights. It
is an integral part of the struggle to enforce the desegregation de-
wcision and break down the other barriers to full Negro equality.
The defense of the constitutional liberties of Communists is in-
separable from the whole movement to rout McCarthyism and
Dixiecratism and restore the Bill of Rights for all Americans. All
the more necessary is it for the trade unions to put an end to the
red-baiting, witch-hunts and political discrimination that still con-
tinues in some sections of the labor movement.

In this connection it should be noted that the extension of
Smith Act prosecutions to Puerto Rico has introduced new anti-
democratic evils: crass violation of the national rights of an op-
pressed people that mocks the so-called commonwealth status
granted to Puerto Rico.

Thus events point up the need and possibility for a new exten-
sion of the. struggle to defend the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights against their reactionary enemies of all types. A closer
relationship is emerging among the movements for equal rights
for the Negro people, for labor’s political and economic rights,
and for freedom of politi-cal expression and association.

A major feature of a civil liberties program would be a series
of legislative proposals for the next session of Congress. In addi-
tion to repeal of the Taft-Hartley and McCarran-Walter Acts and
the enactment of effective civil rights legislation, these proposals
would include a number of vital points advanced by labor and
liberal spokesmen in recent months; curbing or abolishing the
Congressional witch-hunt committees, revision or repeal of such
“anti-subversive” laws as the Smith and McCarran Acts, and the
like. Such a civil liberties program would likewise undertake to
defend the Supreme Court against Dixiecrat-McCarthyite attacks,
to combat state and local infringements of the Bill of Rights, and
to press for an end to Smith Act prosecutions, for a new trial or
freedom for Morton‘ Sobell, -freedom for all political prisoners,
and amnesty for all political prisoners who are‘ now in jail.

II
THE PATH AHEAD '

The principal obstacle to all advance of the American people
today, as in the past, is their traditional enemy: the Monopolies.
Blocking the path to the »'new great advances possi-bl_e today stands
Big Business. The giant trusts which through their control of the
overwhelming majority of American production, dominate the eco-
nomic and political life of our country.

While Big Business has been increasing its domination of the
economic system in the post-war years, it is by no means inevit-
able that it should continue having its way in the political life
and direction of the country. The workers, farmers, Negro people,
small businessmen and professionals, who suffer directly from the
exploitation and depredations of Big Business compose the over-
whelming majority of the American people. They have the po-
tential political strength, if united in a great coalition, to curb
the power of Big Business far more even than in the heyday of the
New Deal.

The formation of an anti-monopoly coalition, led by labor,
and the election of an anti-monopoly coalition government which
would effectively curb the power of Big Business is our main
strategic aim in the period ahead. The accomplishment of this aim
will signify a new stage in the relation of class forces. It will open
the path to realization of the American ideal of government of the
people, by the people, for the people. .

Labor, the farmers, the Negro people, and small business are
already in actual struggle against the monopolies. Increasingly-—
though still inadequately—they have been seeking and giving one
another mutual support. The idea long cultivated by monopoly
propaganda that the interests of these natural allies» are contra.
dictory has been proved false.

Political cooperation ‘based upon mutual economic interests
and interdependence -between labor and the farmers has registered

98 .

 

 

big gains in the past period. In a number of states, such as North
Dakota, Iowa, Oregon, South Dakota and Montana, labor-farmer
cooperation has been maturing rapidly. The main joint effort has
been to defeat the right-to-work laws menacing labor and to sup-
port the farmers’ demands for full parity. In such industries as
farm equipment and meat-packing, labor and farmers have made
common cause against the squeeze of the trusts.

The labor-Negro alliance, despite certain strains, remains a
foundation stone of the people's strength. A million and a half
Negro workers belong to the trade unions and the Negro people
refuse to be moved from their support of trade unionism. On the
other hand, labor gives a growing measure of support to the strug-
gles of the Negro people and tens of thousands of trade unionists
are members of the NAACP.

So far, however, the struggles of these great popular forces
are not united. They remain only at the stage of limited mutual
support. Yet labor, the farmers and the Negro people, together with
the small business people and professionals, constitute the actual
majority of the American people. The central task facing the
American people in their struggle against the giant force of mo-
nopoly is to bring about greatunity of action in the struggle for
their common objectives. '

In the course of the struggle for these objectives the forces of
the people could develop their common action and move towards,
the formation of an anti-monopoly coalition strong enough to curb
the power of the monopolies by effectively resisting their offensive
and enacting measures:

a) To establish the sovereignty of the Nation over its most vital
facilities; ,

b) To limit the economic concentration and power of the
trusts; ’

c) To reduce their incredibly swollen share of the national
wealth. ' ‘

Common action could realize such demands already current in
the labor and people's movements as:

a) Return the scandalous “give-aways” (Tidelands oil, etc.) to
the government; ‘ .

b) Plug up the notorious loopholes in the income and corporate
tax structure through‘ which the monopolies and their magnates
evade the major portion of their taxes; raise the capital gains tax

39.

 

i
i

 

and the income tax in the higher brackets;

c) Enforce the anti-trust laws so that instead of being merely ‘a
nuisance to the trusts and a bonanza for the legal firms, they func-
tion as actual deterrents to monopoly proﬁteering and concentra-
tion;

cl) Expose and prohibit the functioning of Big Business lobby-
ists in buying and dictating legislation in Congress;

e) Nationalize the atomic energy industry, and all public u-tili-
ties with full safeguards for the wages and conditions of the ‘work-
ers as well as the right to organize and strike.

The historic struggle of the American people for public power
takes on wholly new dimensions today in the light of atomic
energy. This vast new source of power was developed out of the
public resources of the American people in wartime.‘ It cannot be
allowed to remain a private domain of the trusts, subject to their
notorious greed and obstruction. The immense scope of this de-
velopment, the inherent dangers, and the widespread economic
effects all require that it be subjected to public control through
the nationalization of the industry. In recent months the AFL-
CIO has been demanding the partial restoration of public control
over the peacetime use of atomic power.

Inevitably Labor, as the basic antagonist of Big Business in
modern America, will prove to be the giant force around which all
other anti-monopoly elements will gravitate and to which they will
look for leadership. While such a perspective is not consciously
recognized in most sectionsof labor’s leadership, nevertheless, there
is growing appreciation of this outlook within its ranks, as well as
among other sections of the people. Over the past years labor
has been playing an increasing role in the life of the nation. With
the recent AFL-CIO merger it has placed itself in a position to
play a still greater role.

The struggle to curb the monopolies cannot be properly de-
veloped unless the growing coalition also ﬁnds its way towards ef-
fective political expression. In the course of the campaign to or-
ganize the mass production industries, Labor became increasingly
aware of the fact that the defense of the interests of the workers
and of their unions requires the extension of the struggle to "legis-
lative and political action. This has become a permanent feature
of the labor movement.

Independent political action of labor has been developing in

31

 

 

 

various forms. Such activity under the leadership of PAC, LLPE
and more recently the united body, COPE (Committee on Politi-
cal Education), as well as by unions directly, takes the form of na-
tional and state legislative conferences, delegations to Washing-
ton and state capitals, participation at important levels of the
major political parties—in most cases the Democratic Party—and
large scale electoral activity. The recent regional conferences of
COPE have initiated a new campaign “broader than ever before to
secure registration by union members and their families and to
distribute millions of copies of the voting records of Congressmen
and Senators.

Most important, labor is taking steps in a number of places
(notably in Detroit) to organize its own congressional district
structure. If developed more broadly, this ‘vould represent a quali-
tatively new forward step on the road of independent political
action.

Labor, the Negro people, the farmers and small business, as
they confront the bi-partisan maneuvering with their most essential
demands, are giving more and more thought to the problem of
political realignment. This is taking the form at present of a new
re-grouping of their forces to combat the most reactionary ele-
ments, in certain cases within the GOP, but especially within
the Democratic Party. .

In Michigan, labor joined with liberal Democrats to oust the
reactionary old guard from control of the Democratic state ma-
chine. In Texas labor joined with other popular forces, as well as
conservatives, to break the grip of the Shivers Dixiecrats on the
state Democratic Party. In Louisiana, labor, in parallel action
with the Negro people and otherdemocratic forces, helped secure
the defeat of the extreme Dixiecrats and the partial repeal of the
state “right-to-work” law.

It is out of such experiences, developing in the states, that the
heightened consciousness of the need for political realignment will
grow. The situation varies greatly from state to state. The possi-
bility of the labor and popular forces gaining decisive influence
in a number of key Democratic Party state organizations in the
future, coupled with a growing collaboration of independent and
liberal Republican political movements, may determine the form
in which a new anti-monopoly party emerges. For in the long run
the working class and its allies will have to have their own anti-

32

 

€53

«Q3

monopoly coalition party capable of "bringing about the eventual
election of a people’s anti-monopoly government.

Among those who are seeking a political realignment, some see
the possibility of transforming the Democratic Party into such an
anti-monopoly coalition party. They believe it possible to oust
the Dixiecrats, break down the inﬂuence of Big Business, win over

liberal Republicans and establish a coalition leadership of labor,

farmers, Negro people and small business.
Some, on the contrary, see the Democratic Party nationally in-

evitably continuing under the control of Big Business, surrender-

ing to or compromising with the Dixiecrats, vacillating or retreat-
ing on labor and other democratic issues. They believe this will
make it necessary for labor and its allies to break away in order
to form a new mass labor-farmer party.

It is wrong to assume that the only possible form of political
realignment is a labor-farmer party. This rigid assumption can
only serve to hamper the actual development of labor’s independent
political action. At the present moment the task of the progres-
sives is not to prejudge the form of the eventual political realign-
ment. The expansion of labor’s independent political role and
all serious efforts to transform the Democratic Party by ousting the
Dixiecrats and undermining the inﬂuence of Big Business, help
create the pre-conditions for a new political alignment under labor’s
leadership, whatever its form. At the same time, the widest and
most extensive education for the formation of a new party led by
labor facilitates labor’s current struggle to inﬂuence the situation
within the Democratic Party. For it demonstrates that labor is
not forever committed to the Democratic Party and will eventually,
in one way or another, build a new political home for itself and
its allies. .

But irrespective of these viewpoints, the struggle to build the
people’s anti-monopoly coalition and to achieve its effective inde-
pendent political expression must =be carried forward. It must be
carried forward regardless of which major party controls the
Administration and Congress.

If it is to advance, this struggle will also have to overcome a
number of road blocks and bring about certain long overdue
democratic reforms. These are necessary to correct abuses which
have developed in our system of government and operate to thwart

3'3

even that degree‘ of majority rule which is possible under the present
political parties. ' v .

Outstanding among these reforms are: -

a)‘ Federal guarantee of the righ-t~‘to vote in all elections ;with-
out discrimination; ’ s

b) Abolition of the seniority system in Congressional com-
mittees; l e — - ~

c) Amendment of Senate Rule 22 so as to make possible the
ending of a ﬁlibuster;

d) Abolition of gerrymandering by state legislatures in laying
out the size and boundaries of Congressional districts, as well as in
representation to state legislatures, in order to correct inequities
in representation as between urban and rural areas and to assure
the right of the Negro people to full representation;

e) Abolition of the electoral college and election of the Presi-
dent by direct popular vote;

f) Elimination of legal obstacles to placing minority parties
and independent candidates on the ballot; adoption of propor-
tional representation;

g) Introduction in all states of initiative, referendum and re-
call. '

The struggle to bring‘ about a political realignment, based on
the formation and election to power of an anti-monopoly coali-
tion led by labor, is the great strategic task of the next stage in
the democratic and social advance of the American people. It is
the giant corporations which block the path to economic progress,
civil rights, fuller democracy and durable peace. It is their chal-
lenge that must be met by the American people as they carry for-
ward their struggle under the -new conditions of today.

III
THE AMERICAN ROAD TO SOCIA*LISM

The people’s anti-monopoly coalition would have as its central

‘aim the improvement of the conditions of the American people

and the defense and extension of their democratic rights. Its
success in electing a people’s anti-monopoly government would
open the way to a vast and unprecedented expansion of democracy.
Such a government could curb the repressive economic and politi-
cal powers of the .monopolies and deprive them of the ability to
promote violence to frustrate the will of the people. Under such
conditions, whenever the majority of the American people become
convinced of the necessity of a socialist reorganization of society,
they would be able to advance to their goal along peaceful and
constitutional lines.

Ever since the rise of the struggle against fascism and the fascist
danger in the ’3o’s, our Party has been elaborating such a program
for a peaceful and constitutional transition to socialism. In 1938
the 10th Party convention adopted the ﬁrst written constitution
of the Communist Party. It expressly stated that any advocate
of force and violence would be excluded from the Party.

In the succeeding years many additional steps were taken. The

‘leading spokesmen of the Party, Chairman Foster and General

Secretary Dennis, expressed this position of the Party in 1947-48
in articles, statements and interviews with such leading newspapers
as the New "York Times and Herald Tribune. A high, point in
the presentation of this question was Comrade Foster’s deposition
“In Defense of the -Communist Party and Its Indicted Leaders,”
at the ﬁrst Smith Act trial in 1949. This statement of policy was
endorsed by the National Committee of the Party. It was ex-
pressed in the Party Program, “The American Way," adopted in
1954. Comrades Dennis and Gates at the ﬁrst meeting the_y"ad-
dressed after their release from jail, at Carnegie Hall, January 20,
1956, reiterated our Party’s advocacy of a peaceful and constitu-
tional road to socialism in our country.

3.5,

Some have challenged this view on the ground that the capital-
ist class of the U.S. is strong and the forces of repression at its dis-
posal are powerful. They point to the character and sharpness
of the class and people’s struggle in the past and today. These
points are unquestioned. The trusts will continue to try to pro-
mote demagogy, division and force and violence to halt social
progress and democratic advance.

Titanic economic and political struggles will intervene in our
country before the majority of the people take the -path to socialism.
In the course of and as a consequence of such struggles of the
working class, the Negro people and others, the power of the mo-
nopolies could be drastically curbed through the election of an
anti-monopoly government. There would be a new strength, a new
class consciousness and political maturity within the labor and
people’s movements which would also be reﬂected in the strength
of the party or parties of socialism.

That is why we state that the possibility exists for the peaceful
and constitutional transition to socialism. This transition will
become possible when the majority of the American people so de-
cide in the course of their struggles against the monopolies. Only
the American people will make that decision.

The history of our country, the struggles of our people to ful-
ﬁll the Bill of Rights, their attachment to the Constitution all point
to the conclusion that socialism in the U.S. will provide full civil
liberties to all, including the right to dissent, and, as long as the
people so desire, a multi-party system. This is not an academic
question for our Party. This stand by our party on civil liberties
under socialism is of value in clarifying our perspective of socialism
and also assists in strengthening the unity of the democratic forces
of our land for common action today.

Socialism in America will be the realization of the dream of eco-
nomic independence and political freedom, of “life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness” under the conditions of today, in the age of
atomic energy and automation. It will carry forward the best tra-
ditions of Jefferson, Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, and of the
great American pioneer labor and socialist leaders, William Sylvis
and Gene Debs.

Socialism is no more un-American than is capitalism particu-
larly American. Capitalism and socialism are social systems grow-
ing out of the evolution of society and its struggle towards greater

36

 

I IV V!

progress. Capitalism in the U.S., because of the peculiar features
and historical conditions of its development, has brought a rela-
tively high standard of living to a large number of people. But it
also has brought economic crisis, wars, colonial exploitation and
oppression, unemployment, insecurity, crime, social degradation
and discrimination. The people had to ﬁght for their standard of
living and for their democratic liberties against the forces of privi-
lege and reaction at every stage in the history of our country.
They fought for independence, for the Bill of Rights, for the right
to vote, for the right to education, for the abolition of slavery, for
the rights of women, for the abolition of child labor, for the right to
build unions, for social insurance‘. And to this day the Negro
people are denied equal rights, are discriminated against, and are
doubly exploited.

Today socialism, embracing a third of the world's people, has
grown to a world system. In the coming period the superiority of
socialism over capitalism wil become ever more apparent to all
peoples. .

Socialism in the U.S. from the beginning will be able to pro-
vide all our people with the highest standard of living, the fullest
economic security. For ours is the most technically advanced
country in the world. Our resources, our skills, our technology,
our organizing capacity and experience, our workers, scientists,
will assure a rapidly increasing standard of living for all. Socialism
in our country will bring not only the fullest satisfaction of our
material needs but also the fullest democratic liberty and cultural
satisfaction.

The Communist Party from its inception has been the party of
socialism. Because of this it has brought strength and understand-
ing mu-ch greater than its numbers to the struggles in which it
fought as part of the American working people. But our Party
never fully mastered the task of successfully combining the im-
mediate struggle and socialist education. In the early period
policies and slogans were put forward as if socialism were around
the corner. Later on, when the Party, making a more sober and
realistic analysis of the situation, came to the conclusion that so-
cialism was not on the immediate order of the day in the U.S., edu-
cational work for socialism was neglected.

This resulted from our narrow and sectarian conception of
socialism, of what it would be like in the U.S. and of how it would

be achieved. We failed to see in the many struggles for greater
economic security, in the strong anti-monopoly tendencies, the
basis for reaching the people with fundamental discussions of issues
and for promoting socialist education among them.

But the enemies of socialism have never ceased their attacks and
are today -carrying on widespread propaganda not only against
the socialist lands and against the Communist Party of the United
States, but also against the ideas of socialism. .

This should make clear that the Communist Party cannot limit
itself to a mere declaration that socialism is not on the immediate
order of the day in our- land. This is undoubtedly true. But so-
cialism is nonetheless an issue: socialism in the Soviet Union
and other socialist countries, and most of all, what socialism would
be like in the U.S., and how the Communist Party hopes the
American people will achieve socialism.

The historic conditions deriving from the First World War,
the Russian Revolution, and the split in the socialist movement
have now given way to new conditions. The emergence of socialism
from the limits of one country to a world system embracing sev-
eral states and one-third of -mankind was described by the twentieth
congress of the Gommunist Party of the Soviet Union as “the chief
feature of the present era.” .

These conditions make possible a great new trend towards unity
among socialist-minded people which has already begun to be felt
not only abroad but in our own country. Thesnew features of in-
dependence and mutual criticism in -the relationships among Com-
munist Parties also tend to remove barriers between Communists
and other supporters of socialism.

For some‘ months our Party has had under consideration the
question presented in Eugene Dennis’ report to the National Com-
mittee meeting last April, of our attitude towards the perspec-
tive of a united party of socialism in this country.

The new developments point to a cer-tain revitalization and
growth of socialist-oriented and pro-Marxist currents and group-
ings. In the past we tended to assume that all that was worth

while in other socialist currents and groupings would inevitably ‘ '

flow into our own organization. This assumption was always in-
correct and should be replaced ‘by serious and painstaking efforts
to assist in the eventual development of the broadest possible unity
of all socialist-minded elements.

38

 

 

Such a development can by no means -be expected as a quick
and easy solution to the common problems of all socialist group-
ings, or to the speciﬁc problems of our own Party. Least of all
could this objective be advanced by any tendency to weaken or
dissolve the Communist Party. On the contrary, it is essential that
the Communist Party strengthen in every way its organization,
mass work and general inﬂuence.

The prospect we hold forth for our Party requires a reinvigora-

tionof the Marxist press. A prerequisite for an effective hearing
for Marxist ideas and for making their influence felt in respect-

to the -course of our country's development is that we spare no
effort in helping to ﬁnance and solve the distribution problems of
The Worker and the Daily Worker. Stabilizing the ﬁnancial base
of the Marxist press and building its circulation will establish the
practicalfoundation for a steady improvement in its political and
journalistic quality.

The attainment of unity among socialist-minded forces lies
along the path of common struggle on the broadest issues facing
the American people, in the course of which ideological and tactical
questions will become clariﬁed and common bonds be fored.

It would be wrong to identify the extent of socialist traditions
and thinking with the low level of socialist organization today.
Among the trade unions, in the building of which Socialists and
Communists played a major role, among the Negro people, the
working farmers, the professionals and the youth who are ponder-
ing the signiﬁcance of the growth of the socialist world system,
as well as among the many thousands who at one time were mem-
bers of our Party or who participated in mass struggles under our
leadership, are to be found many who would welcome the perspec-
tive of a united party of socialism. The National Committee should
be charged with fostering this perspective.

The historic objective of achieving unity of all honest social-
ist-minded forces to develop the American people’s anti-monopoly
coalition, as well as for the ultimate achievement of socialism,
throws an added light on our re-appraisal of our Party’s past and
present functioning, its mass activity and its vast role in the
period ahead.

OUR PARTY

The Communist Party made a vital contribution to the welfare
of our country since the end of World War II by its unﬂinching
ﬁght for peace, against the danger of fascism, for the civil rights
of the Negro people, and for the economic needs of the working
people. It continues to do so.

Communists fought consistently through the years of the cold
war to help bring about the present improved political situation.
In so doing, they served the best national interests of our coun-
try with patriotic selflessness.

At its Emergency Convention in 1945 the Communist Party
warned the American people about the dangers inherent in the
developing plans of Wall Street to dominate the world. As this
aggressive drive for world domination unfolded, the Communist
Party alerted the American people to the emergence of a serious
danger of a new world war. It exposed and combatted every policy
and action which jeopardized or broke the peace; the notorious
“get tough with Russia" policy; the war-inciting Fulton, Missouri,
speech of Winston Churchill; the Truman doctrine of “contain-
ment,” atom-bomb diplomacy and military intervention in China
and Greece; the Marshall Plan; the “positions of strength” policy
embodied in the Atlantic Pact, NATO, SEATO and other military
alliances, as well as the building of military -bases all over the
world. The Communist party fought consistently under difﬁcult
conditions for a negotiated peace to end the Korean War. It vig-
orously combatted the Big Lie of an alleged threat of Soviet ag-
gression. It called for the negotiation of differences between the
Big Powers, the ending of the cold war and its replacement -by a
policy of peaceful coexistence between our country and the Soviet
Union.

Our Party’s Achievements

During this period the Communist Party took the lead in com-
batting a host of repressive measures and policies designed to silence
those ﬁghting for peace and to intimidate the American people into

40

 

acceptance of unpopular military adventures. It exposed and
fought against the Schwellenbach proposal for outlawing the Com-
munist Party, the Mundt-Nixon Bill,‘ the McCarran Act, the Taft-
Hartley Act, the Attorney General’s .“subversive list,” the thought-
control “loyalty”' order and civil service witch-hunts, the persecu-
tion ‘by -Congressional committees, the Smith Act prosecutions, the
McCarthyite inquisition and the “atom-spy” hoax which resulted in
the frame-up and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well
as the imprisonment of Morton Sobell. The Party exposed and
fought against repressive measures and policies adopted in many
states.

Throughout this period the Communist Party actively sup-
ported labor's struggles for improved economic and working
conditions, particularly during the big strikes of the miners, the
railway, packinghouse, steel, auto, electrical and farm equipment
workers. Communists championed labor’s united action in defense
of its hard won gains. They contributed to labor's growing ap-
preciation of its unique and decisive role in the life of the na-
tion. They helped labor gain a better understanding of its rela-
tion to the struggle for Negro rights. They urged closer working
relationships between labor and the farm population. They fought
for democratic, militant trade unionism and against expulsions,
raiding, secessions and the fragmentation of the labor movement.
They popularized independent political action as the key to the
future not only of the labor movement but of the entire nation.

The Communist Party energetically championed the struggles
of the Negro people for full economic, social and political equality.
It made notable contributions in defending Willie McGee, the
Martinsvi‘l1e'Seven, the Trenton Six, Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and
Wesley Wells; in combatting segregated housing in Stuyvesant
Town, Levittown, and Parkchester in New York, in Park Manor,
Peoria Street and Trumbull Park in Illinois, and in many other
communities throughout the nation; in popularizing the battle for
Negro representation in all elective and appointive government
bodies; in promoting the struggle for inclusion of model FEPC
clauses in union contracts; in ﬁghting for election and appointment
of Negro leaders to top positions in the lily-white leadership of
many unions. These and similar activities of the Communist Party
contributed substantially to the emergence of the current broad
movement for civil rights.

The struggles waged by the Communist Party in the past de-
cade constitute a notable chapter in the history of the American
working class. As the tide continues to turn against McCarthyism
and the cold war, sweeping away the frenzied insanity of ‘a decade
of red-baiting, lies and distortions, the justice and courage of the
Communist Party’s struggle will be increasingly vindicated in the
eyes of all Americans who have the real welfare of our country at
heart. Every member and friend of the Communist Party has reason
to be proud of the contributions made to the great task of helping
save America from the ‘catastrophe of war and fascism.

The Communist Party and its supporters have reason to be
proud of the staunchness with which they met the wave of perse-
cution against them. Nonetheless, this persecution was not without
effect. It took the-form’ of an expanding pattern of repression in-
cluding: Taft-Hartley Act affidavits and perjury prosecutions;
Smith Act arrests,- trials, convictions and jail sentences; Congres-
sional committee inquisitions and contempt citations; the screen-
ing of whole industries and the entire civil service; ﬁrings from
jobs, hounding from professions, establishment of industry-wide
blacklists; McCarran Act persecutions; widespread deportations of
foreign-bom; deprivation of legal rights to halls, radio time, ad-
vertising space, etc. All this put the Communist Party in a position
of de facto illegality. A .

This attack was designed to destroy the Communist Party. In
this it did not succeed. It did succeed in weakening and isolating
it. It is necessary for all members of the Communist Party to face
up soberly to the fact that in this period the Party suffered heavy
organizational losses, declined in political inﬂuence in many areas
of work and ﬁelds of activity, became dangerously isolated from
important sectors of the labor and people’s movements; that the
Marxist press is in -jeopardy, and that generally the Party is con-
fronted with a critical situation.

Was it inevitable, in view of these attacks and adverse objec-
tive conditions, that the Party should suffer such heavy organ-
izational losses and become so severely isolated as it did? The
answer must be NO.

The attacks on the Party occurred at a time when the overall
economic situation, with the exception of the chronic postwar
agricultural crisis was characterized by high levels of general em-
ployment and increased total earnings by workers’ families. This

42

 

  

situation gave rise to two trends in the ranks of the working class.
On the one hand, the absence of an army of unemployed who
might be used as a club against them encouraged workers to ﬁght
militantly throughout this period for wage in-creases and important
fringe beneﬁts. On the other hand, the growth of class conscious-
ness among the workers was inhibited by continued high levels of
employment and rising earnings for almost 15 years, combined

with the propaganda of views in the labor movement reﬂecting the '

inﬂuence of Keynesian theories about the ability of capitalism to
solve permanently the problem of “boom and bust" through a
“managed economy” of built-in stabilizers. A

What is more, this factor has helped erode the class conscious-
nessof many labor leaders who in past years considered themselves
adherents of Socialism but who today have abandoned their socialist
convictions, or even oppose socialist ideas in favor of an illusory
“permanently expanding capitalism” as the ultimate solution for
the problems of American workers.

Errors and Weaknesses of the Party

Against the background of this economic situation and its
consequences, the errors and long standing weaknesses of our party
had a particularly damaging effect. _

The most important of these errors include:

A. In the Fight for Peace: _

The Party's estimate that Wall Street’s drive for world domi-
nation created a serious danger of a new world war was correct.
With this analysis our Party made a signiﬁcant contribution to the
mobilization of American and world peace forces. At the same time
some serious sectarian mistakes were made in analyzing important
phases of the struggle between the forces of peace and war. While
we repeatedly asserted that World War III was not inevitable, we
tended to weaken this correct estimate by declaring that each new
defeat for American imperialism increased its desperation and,
hence, increased the danger of war. This was coupled with an
analysis that the only major difference in the ranks of monopoly
capital was between those who want war now and those who want
war later. _

This overlooked the fact that Wall Street’s ability to achieve
its predatory aims was diminishing and that the setbacks to the

43

  

imperialist drive sharpened all differences within the ranks of
monopoly capital as well as between the imperialists of various
countries. It overlooked the fact that the overall situation of
American imperialism still gave it room to maneuver short of
world war rather than reducing it to desperate alternatives.

In effect, such estimates excluded the possibility of the peaceful
settlement of differences except through a major change in the
relation of class forces in the United States. They made it diﬂicult
to convince the Party membership and the masses of the possibility
of achieving under existing conditions a protracted period of peace-
ful coexistence.

Certainly, when Dulles three times took our country “to the
brink of war,” this represented on each occasion an acute sharpen-
ing of the danger of wars which might have had global repercus-
sions. But Dulles’ inability to take our country over the brink
revealed the strength of the obstacles to war. It was precisely this
strength that our Party underestimated.

That is why, despite our statements regarding the profound
signiﬁcance of the armistice in Korea and the negotiated peace in
Indo-China, our Party did not draw full conclusions from the
favorable changes in international relations which these events
signalized. Because of a narrow concept of the division of the world
into two camps we did not properly assess the growth of a
neutralist bloc in the world, especially the newly liberated colonial
countries, as well as like forces in our country. In fact, up to the
very eve of the Geneva Summit meeting there were strong ten-
dencies to underestimate the ability of the peace forces, within our
country and internationally, to compel the Eisenhower Administra-
tion to enter into peaceful negotiations with the socialist world.

B. In the Fight Against the Fascist Danger.

The Party correctly assessed the connection between American
imperialism's aggressive foreign policy and the host of reactionary
and pro-fascist measures which began to be promulgated, adopted
or enforced in the late 1940s. These measures were designed to
intimidate and suppress all opposition to the aggressive foreign
policies of Big Business. Contrary to opinions prevalent in some
circles that this development was a temporary post-war aberration
which would automatically subside in time, the Party emphasized
the potential fascist danger if it was not checked 'by the active
struggle of the American people.

44

 

 

However, the errors made by the Party in estimating various
phases of the struggle against the war danger also inﬂuenced its
judgment of the fascist menace, particularly in relation to attempts
to outlaw the Party. This took the form of overestimating the scope,
level and tempo of the process of fascization under way generally.
Our evaluation also tended to equate the attempted outlawing of
the Party with fascism. .

This led to wrong organizational decisions in 1950, including
conscious efforts to reduce the size of the Party membership. While
this particular error was quickly recognized by the Districts and
the National Committee and corrective steps were taken, it never-
theless resulted in serious damage to the Party organization.

Subsequently, in 1951, the National Committee statement on
the Vinson decision upholding the ﬁrst Smith Act conviction of
Communist leaders estimated that we had entered a wholly “new
situation”; in other words, that a qualitative change had taken
place in the process of the fascization of our country. This led to
the introduction of a system of leadership which virtually gave up
the ﬁght for legality, tended to accept a status of illegality and
abandoned many possibilities for the public functioning of the
Party. '

While it was essential to safeguard the Party and enable it to
function under the difficult conditions it faced, and while numerous
Communists displayed great steadfastness in this task, nevertheless,
as a result of a sectarian approach to this effort, the Party need-
lessly lost thousands of members. This facilitated the efforts of
reaction to isolate us from the masses who, naturally, could not
understand the Party's course in the given situation.

Contributing to these left-sectarian errors were:

a) the failure to recognize that the ruling class was not so hard
pressed as to be unable to continue its established method of
governmental rule even as it sharply curtailed the Bill of Rights
by launching unprecedented attacks against the labor and peo-
ple’s movements, and in the ﬁrst place, against the Communist
Party;

b) underestimation of the strength of American democratic
traditions among the people, their readiness to defend the Con-

stitution and the Bill of Rights. the latent power of the trade

unions as a bulwark against fascism, the peculiarities of American
governmental structure, as well as the struggles between and with-

45

 

  
   
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
   
    
    

in the two major parties which act as impediments to the repres-
sive drive of the most reactionary circles.

C. 0n Imminence of Economic Crisis.

Repeatedly since 1945, the Party has erred in assessing economic
developments in the United States. In 1945, in 1949 and in 1954,
it predicted that the current declines would develop into crises of
major proportions.

At certain moments the Party’s analysis wrongly appraised
effects of the continuing arms program. Even more important, it
overlooked the extent of continuing investments in ﬁxed capital
to replace, expand and modernize equipment which had worn
out or become obsolete since the last major cycle of ﬁxed capital
renewal in the thirties. Together with this it failed to size up
adequately the level of commercial and residential construction
as well as the scope of unsatisﬁed consumer demand and the pos-
sibilities of credit expansion. Also, it overlooked the temporary
stimulating effect of the government’s tax program which provided
for rebates, attractive amortization terms, lower excess proﬁts taxes.

The Party’s judgment in ea-ch case was faulty because it never
made an adequate analysis of the speciﬁc features of American
capitalism. Instead, it based itself on a one-sided and incomplete
study of economic data, applying the Marxian theory of economic
crisis in a routine, formal and doctrinaire manner.

These repeated estimates of impending economic crisis had
many harmful effects: projection of unrealistic economic programs,
overestimation of the tempo of radicalization of the masses, with
resultant mistakes in tactical approaches to united front relations,
especially in the trade unions; and ﬁnally, encouragement of all
tendencies to overestimate the imminence of war and fascism.

Relations with the Labor Movement

The foregoing mistaken estimates contributed to a series of
sectarian errors in the Party’s policies in the main areas of work.

Our policies and tactics in regard to the most important aspect
of our work, our relations with the labor movement, did not escape
the inﬂuence of sectarianism. This took the form of a sectarian
attitude to the labor movement itself and to the relations that
should existjbetween the Communist Party and the trade unions.

46

 

We did not view the labor movement realistically in the light of
its actual level of development. Rather, _our point of departure
was our own concept of what the labor movement should be. We
therefore projected standards of achievement for Communists and
progressives in the labor movement, as well as for the labor move-
ment as a whole, based on our estimate of what was urgently
needed rather than on what was possible under existing conditions.

This led to cumulative strains in the relations between the Party
and the most -friendly sections of the labor movement. It was in
great part responsible for isolating us from the membership and
the leadership of the unions, towards whom we often adopted not
only a sectarian but even a factional attitude. This was demon-
strated not only in the failure to wage a skillful and consistent
ﬁght to prevent an irreconcilable rupture with the progressive
and center forces in several C.I.O. unions, but also in the develop-
ment of a policy of waging the sharpest struggle against those we
characterized as the “center forces” in the C.I.O., and as “Social
Democrats.”

Within the conservative-led unions this sectarian approach also
proved to be very costly. Communists and progressives were often
faced with the alternative of either pursuing policies which led to
their isolation, loss of positions of leadership and often loss of job
in the shop as well; or taking a more ﬂexible position and being
branded as opportunists by the Party. The history of the past
period is replete with examples of both consequences. In the vast
majority of cases it led to the isolation of the most militant trade
unionists from the masses of the workers. In many_cases it caused
militant and progressive workers and union leaders to break rela-
tions of long standing with our Party. These mistakes are in large
part responsible for our failure to build the strength of the Left
in the AFL and the conservative-led unions of the C.I.O.

A ﬂagrant example of this leftism is to be found in the series
of events that led up to the expulsion of the progressive-led unions
from the CIO. These expulsions and the all-out effort to destroy
the unions led by progressives were part of a well organized cam-
paign to split the labor‘ movement in every major country. This
plan was not only the brainchild of certain labor leaders, but was
supported, if not initiated, by the State Department and the other
anti-labor forces. Nevertheless, we must recognize that their efforts
were facilitated by our own errors in policy and tactics.

PUBLISHER’S NOTE

3
THIS PAMPHLET contains the authorized text of the Draft Res-
olution adopted by the National Committee of the Communist
Party on September 13, 1956, and presented for discussion by the
membership approaching the Party's 16th National Convention,
February 9-12, 1957.

In releasing the Draft Resolution, Mr. Eugene Dennis, General
Secretary of the Communist Party, made public a “Letter to all

Communist Party Members," which is also included in this
pamphlet.

All suggestions, comment and criticism of the Draft Resolution
should -be addressed to Discussion Committee, P. 0. Box 87, Cooper
‘Station, New York 3, N. Y.

Our Party urged all progressives to ﬁght for the unity of the
CIO. We were sharply critical of tendencies to withdraw from the
CIO at the 1949 Cleveland convention. In the main the progressive
unions made great efforts to maintain a united CIO and were pre-
pared to accept any formula for the settlement of the issues in-
volved as long as their autonomous rights were respected. The
expulsions were completely unjustiﬁed and those who pressed for
them did irreparable harm to the CIO and to the whole labor
movement. V

But the numerous head-on collisions which took place at the
Boston, Portland and Cleveland conventions and in between those
conventions on questions of policy relating to political action,
foreign affairs, economic outlook and trade union democracy, were
not seen ‘by our Party from the beginning as laying the groundwork
for expulsion. Our sectarian policy and tactics prevented us from
throwing our weight behind a policy calculated to ease these col-
lisions, to avoid them where possible and generally to keep the two
trends in the labor movement from becoming so sharply polarized
as to lead to an organizational split. Our errors also contributed
to making it more difﬁcult for the Communists in the unions to
advocate the adoption of steps after the expulsion, for re-entry of
the progressive-led unions into the mainstream of the American
labor movement, either through a ﬁght for re-afliliation or through
merger with other unions. .

Sectarianism also led our Party at times into a position opposite
to our traditional and true policy of ﬁghting for the over—all unity
of the labor movement. We have played a leading and positive
role in advocating the reuniﬁcation of the labor movement ever
since the organization of A the CIO. We have always been cham-
pions of the organic unity of the labor movement. But the growing
sentiment for the merger of the CIO and AFL after the Republican
victory of 1952 did not evoke from us the enthusiastic support that
it deserved. Instead there was the tendency to a negative approach‘,
counterposing united labor action to organic unity, and at times
even a tendency to be inﬂuenced by opinions which some expressed
that the merger was being consummated on the initiative of the
State Department for ulterior purposes.

In ﬁghting to rid the Party of sectarianism in policy and tactics,
we must also clearly deﬁne what we consider to be the correct rela-
tions between the Party and the trade union movement, as well as

48

 

between Communists and their fellow-unionists, as follows:

The Communist Party recognizes and respects the complete
political and organizational independence of the trade unions and
other organizations of the working class and people. It rejects any
policy of interference in their internal affairs. It repudiates any
allegation that it seeks to capture or control these organizations or
to “bore from within.” Its attitude to them is the same as to the
working class and the people generally whom it tries to inﬂuence
publicly by political discussion, persuasion and example. Commu-
nists belonging to these organizations adhere to and abide by the
discipline and democratic decisions of the organizations. They are
guided only by their devotion to the best interests of the working

I class and people.

Communists will be found among those who work for demo-
cratic procedures in the unions, for the «full involvement of the
membership in the policy-making as well as the activities of the
unions. They will endeavor to be among the foremost in carrying
out the main task of the unions, the defense and improvement of
the wages and working conditions of the membership, and in
promoting the united action of all labor to achieve these objectives.
As workers imbued with class consciousness, Communists have
much to contribute in helping their fellow workers attain a greater
understanding on such questions as:

The need for a firm alliance and brotherly relationship between
Negro and white; the role that labor’s independent political action
can play in the workers’ daily life and in advancing the cause of
labor’s «future, as well as the importance of gaining allies among
other sections of the population; the perspective of a great people’s
anti-monopoly coalition, headed by labor, leading the nation to-
wards greater democracy, economic betterment and peace. In the
tradition of Sylvis, Debs and Foster, Communists will bring the
great ideas of socialism to the labor movement, seeking to help the
trade unions achieve their full stature as representative organiza~
tions of the American working class.

The Party and the Struggles of the Negro People

The Party’s work in relation to the Negro people’s struggle for
equality and freedom was also hobbled -by sectarianism in policies
and organizational measures. For many years our program and

practices in the struggle -for Negrorights was conditioned by a

"narrow ‘and sectarian conception of the character and class base

of the Negro people’s movement. In minimizing the fact that all
the class strata of "the Negro people suffered discrimination to one
degree or another and therefore had a stake in the struggle for
equality and freedom, we clung to negative attitudes toward non-
Left-led organizations of the Negro people and their leaders.
Oft-times, we supported organizational initiatives which had the
effect of drawing off the militants from the major Negro organ-
izations and isolating them into left-wing bodies.

In their turn, these Left-led Negro organizations were often
(under the weight of our insistence) heavily burdened with “special
pleadings” in behalf of the general program of the‘ Left; as a re-
sult they departed from the speciﬁc program and method of strug-
gle which masses of Negro people were prepared to support. Con-
sequently, these organizations soon placed themselves outside the
mainstream of the organized mass movement of the Negro people
for democratic advancement and equal rights. Incorrectly identify-
ing the militancy of the Negro masses in their battle for equal
rights with anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist consciousness, we
frequently put forward programs and slogans which corresponded
poorly to the prevailing level and temper of the Negro people’s
movement. .

Likewise the failure tofimake timely’ revisions in our theoretical
position on the Negro question handicapped our comrades in de-
veloping their relationships with the living struggles‘ of the Negro
freedom movement.

In this connection, the validity of the slogan of “se1f-determi-
nation for the Negro nation of the Southern Black Belt” as a
theoretical premise for our -political estimate A of‘ the direction in
which the Negro people’s struggle in the South is developing,
needs to be reappraised. This question will be the subject of a
special pre-convention discussion resolution.

Also, in unfolding the struggle against racist ideologies, prac-
tices, and acts of white supremacy and chauvinism—a vitally neces-

sazy permanent and principled obligation of all Qommunists, pro-

gressives and humanists—-there were widespread tendencies by some
bodies on all levels to make unwarranted charges of. white chau-
vinism. Likewise, in upholding the correct - principle that white
chauvinism is incompatible with membership in the Party, arbitrary

50

 

administrative excesses occurred which distorted and hampered
the effectiveness of this struggle. This period is now behind us; all
guarantees should be established against its recurrence.

One of the achievements of which our Party is justly proud
has been its pioneering, militant struggle for the fullequality, of
the Negro people. A feature which distinguished the Communist
Party from all hitherto existing American political organizations
has been its grasp of the cardinal importance of the Negro question
in the ﬁght to defend and extend American democracy. Based
upon this understanding, the Communist Party blazed a new trail
of struggle for Negro rights.

Our Party stimulated and helped forge Negro-white unity among
the general population. It developed a bond of fraternal, comradely
ties among Negro and white members which served as an indi-
spensable factor in making the Party a potent force in American
life. Our Party brought into being a quality of relationships among
its Negro and white members which has been a treasured humanist
achievement and a powerful exemplary inﬂuence among the work-
ing class and the masses of our country. This is among our richest
traditions. The C.P. is proud and happy that these ideas have
taken root among increasing sections of workers and progressive
Americans. And even though some of these do not yet fully accept
the high standards we seek, their advance is expressed in the ever
widening support of the labor movement and other organizations

of the people to the struggle for civil rights. .

At the same time we must be fully aware that the ﬁght on this

ideological "T front is ‘far from won. The Dixiecrats and their sup-

porters in the North are endeavoring to poison the relationship
between the Negro people and the white masses. The dissemina-
tion of white supremacy ideas continues not spontaneously or as a
remnant of the past, but by_ conscious direction and persistent
efforts of the enemies of democracy.

In this situation, the battle against left sectarianism can be
meaningful only if it results in working out the broadest approaches
to an effective struggle against white chauvinism in the la-borand
progressive movement. To weaken the ﬁght against white su-
premacy ideas or practices within the mass movement or against
any remnants of white chauvinist inﬂuence that may exist in the
Party, on the plea of ﬁghting left sectarian mistakes‘ of the past,
would constitute abandonment of principle, destruction of the

51

 

foundation for Negro-white unity and the lowering of the Party’s
proud banner of equality and comradeship.

Over the past few years, there have accumulated innumerable
problems of personnel in the ﬁeld of Negro work; an unsatisfactory
deployment of Negro personnel in leading positions on a national
and district scale; strong manifestations of bureaucratic methods
in dealing with problems of Negro work and inner Party relation-
ships between Negro and white; in some cases a pronounced tend-
ency to give insufficient attention to the repea.ted1y—expressed views
of Negro personnel.

The improvement of the level of the Party's ﬁght for Negro
rights and the enhancing of the quality of Negro-‘white unity within
the Party require the maximum participation of and consultation
with Negro comrades at all levels of Party work in the formulation
of policy and the disposition of personnel. Special measures must
be takenand guarantees provided to ensure such participation.

It should be borne in mind that the improvement of the Party's
work in the struggle for Negro rights will have vitality and will
succeed to the degree that it meets the needs of the Negro people
and wins the support of the Negro membership in the ﬁrst place,
and of the membership as a whole.

i? it I

The Party’s previous electoral tactics contributed heavily to its
isolation from the trade union movement and the broad masses
of peace.-loving and democratic-minded Americans. The support
which the Party gave to the formation of the Progressive Party, for
which no serious base existed in the trade union movement, was
one of the most harmful sectarian mistakes of the past period. It
flowed from and was conditioned by the sectarian estimates and
policies which characterized the work of the Party in all other
ﬁelds. The tenacious hold of sectarianism in our electoral policy
was further demonstrated in the Party's continued support to the
Progressive Party even after the 1948 elections had clearly shown
that its formation had been a mistake and that it had no substan-
tial mass following.

The first decisive step against sectarianism in the electoral ﬁeld
was the Draft Resolution of December 1952. Rejecting rigid third
party attitudes, this resolution opened the way for a broad reexami-
nation of our electoral policies. As a result, although serious sec-

tarian features persisted, our approach to the 1954 elections marked
an advance toward re-entering the mainstream of independent
political action by labor and the people. This has been further
extended in our generally sound approach to the 1956 elections.
However, the struggle against sectarianism and rigidity in the elec-
toral ﬁeld is far from won. We are still guilty too frequently of
abstractness and inﬂexibility. This is true not only of speciﬁc elec-
toral struggles but also of our approach to the question of perspec-
tives on political realignment.

Our isolation from the labor and people's movements was in-
creased during this period by a policy of indiscriminately support-
ing the establishment of Left-led organizations. This overlooked
changes which had taken place from a previous situation in which
the absence of initiatives in many ﬁelds by organized groups neces-
sitated the formation of a wide array of Left-led organizations.
With the new role played by important organizations of labor and
the people during the past period on many important questions,
Left-led organizations in many instances isolated their members
a-nd supporters from the main currents of political life in the coun-
try. In other cases, where initiatives by Left committees were justi-
ﬁed, mistaken efforts were made to expand such committees into
membership groups. Only in a few ca-ses were such Left-led organ-
izations justiﬁed in terms of political and organizational need.

Inevitably all these errors in estimate and policies were a basic
obstacle to the development of our united front relations. Their
impact was all the greater because of our rigid attitude that we
alone had all the answers, an attitude which repelled actual and
potential allies. ’

Nature of the Errors

The most important mistakes made in the period under review
were left-sectarian in character. These left-sectarian mistakes are
the main reason for the unprecedented degree to which it was pos-
sible for Big Business and its political representatives to isolate the
Party.

To end its isolation and expand its mass work, the main task
of the Party today is to overcome completely the influence of left-
sectarian estimates, policies and tactics in all ﬁelds of work.

53

 

  
  

In the process of carrying out the main task, ‘the Party must
continue to maintain its vigilance against right opportunist ten-5
dencies, combating them at all times. This is especially necessary in
view of the extremely sharp turn which the Party is now making
in "many of its basic policies; The necessary struggle against right"
opportunist errors must be carried on in such a way as not to
weaken the main task.

This effort has -been under way in the Party particularly since
the end of 1952. Following the results of the 1952 elections, the Na-
tional Committee began a serious struggle against left-sectarianism
as the main danger in our mass work. This found expression: in
the resolution on the results of the 1952 elections, which sharply
criticized the sectarian direction of the Party's electoral tactics;
in leading articles in 1953, which outlined the path for a sharp
break withsectarianism in our mass work and for redirecting the
Party toward the mainstream of the labor movement; in over-
coming hesitation on the projection of our position on peaceful
transition and an American path to socialism as initiated by Com-
rade Foster; in the opening of a concerted political struggle against
sectarianism in many phases of our Negro work, including the
issuance of “The Common Program for the South,” as well as
publication of various articles; in the initiation of new approaches
to the Smith Act trials; in serious efforts to inﬂuence the Left-led
unions to re—enter the mainstream of the labor movement; in the
Party Program adopted in 1954 which, despite certain errors in
estimate gave new and ‘broad perspectives to the Party both in its
immediate work and long range outlook; in the gradual abandon-
ment and ﬁnally complete liquidation of unnecessary and extreme
security measures.

However, this struggle was carried on in a piece-meal manner
with considerable inconsistency and vacillation because it met with

strong resistance in the Party. This resulted at ti-mes in conciliation -

with or continuation of sectarian .policies and practices.
Nevertheless, as a result of these beginnings of the battle against
sectarianism during 1953, 1954 and 1955 (taken together with
favorable changes in the political situation), some advances have
already been made in unfreezing relations with important center
forces in the trade unions, the Negro people's organizations and
the communities, as well as in beginning to overcome the Party's
formerly extreme isolation in many ﬁelds. Basically we could not

54

 

correct our past mistakes as long as we had not yet recognized the
sources of left-sectarianism.
as as as p

The April 1956 meeting of the National Committee inaugurated
a new phase in the struggle against sectarianism. The report of
Comrade Dennis advanced the struggle against left-sectarianism
by examining the basic estimates in which the sectarian tactical
line of the Party has been rooted. The report established that the
main task of the Party in the present period was to eliminate every
vestige of left-sectarianism in policies and activities.

The roots of these errors are not to be found in the events of
the past ten years alone. ' , ~

The Marxist movement in our country has suffered historically
from dogmatic application of Marxist theory to the American scene.
The Communist Party inherited these weaknesses. Insuﬂicient de-
velopment of the independent theoretical work of our Party over
the past decades has contributed towards our doctrinaire acceptance
and mechanical application of many theoretical propositions.

Our Party has also suffered from an oversimpliﬁed approach to
and an uncritical acceptance of many views of Marxists and Marxist
parties in other countries.

Doctrinaire » forms of party organization, bureaucratic methods
of leadership, failure to develop inner -party democracy and a
frequent intolerant attitude to the people we worked with have
been in large measure responsible for our inability to correct mis-
takes in time as well as for much of our sectarianism. All these
factors are interrelated; each helped to reinforce the other.

To advance the struggle in t-he United States for peace, democ-
racy, civil rights and socialism, the Communist Party must further
develop its independent theoretical work. It must free itself from
deeply ingrained habits of dogmatism and doctrinairism which
breed sectarianism, and which in turn lend encouragement to right
opportunism.

In order to succeed in this, the Party must study thoroughly
the realities of American life today, the history and traditions of
our working class and people, the special features of capitalist
economy and bourgeois democracy in our country, the distinctive
features of the American road to socialism.

The principles of scientiﬁc socialism were ﬁrst put forward by
Marx and Engels. They were further developed in the imperialist

55

  

era by Lenin. They were later enriched by contemporary Marxists
in many countries. Basing ourselves on these Marxist-Leninist prin-
ciples as interpreted by the Communist Party of our country, we
must learn much better how to extract from the rich body of this
theory that which is universally valid, combining it with the speciﬁc
experiences of the American working class in the struggle for
socialism in the United States. The Party must distinguish better
between the additions to Marxist theory made by Lenin which are
valid for all countries and those speciﬁc aspects of Lenin’s writings
which reflect exclusively certain unique features of the Russian
revolution or of Soviet society.

Likewise, the Communist Party will have to be bolder in re-
examining certain Marxist-Leninist theories which, while valid
in a -past period, may have become outdated and rendered obsolete
by new historical developments. For entirely new and unprece-
dented problems are emerging today which were never treated by
Marx, Engels or Lenin. They arise from the new world situation
and its impact on all countries.

Already in response to these new developments, profoundly im-
portant and qualitatively new elements have been introduced into
the body of Marxist theory by Marxists of many countries. For
example, we as well as other Marxist -parties have already discarded
as obsolete Lenin’s thesis that war is inevitable under imperialism.
We have long since rejected as 'incorrect Stalin’s thesis of the
alleged law of inevitable violent proletarian revolution. Likewise,
we are making important modiﬁcations in the theory of the state,
as evidenced in our advocacy of the peaceful, constitutional path
to socialism. _

We must undertake to make our own independent contribu-
tions to the further development and enrichment of the theory of
scientiﬁc socialism. ‘Creative Marxism is impossible without the
ceaseless reexamination and reappraisal of theory in the light of
ever-changing reality.

The National Committee feels that it is incorrect to continue
to function without a comprehensive and basic written program.
The Program adopted in 1954 is inadequate for that purpose. Such
a program is necessary in order to deﬁne clearly and unequivocally
the viewpoint of American Communists on all fundamental prob-
lems of the struggle for socialism in the United States. The Na-
tional Committee recommends that the coming Party convention

56

 

 

elect a program committee to begin drafting such a document,
which will ‘be submitted to the membership for general discussion.

The Communist Party — Independent Party
of American Workers

The -Communist Party is an independent party of American
workers dedicated to socialism. Its primary concern is for the present
and future welfare of the American people. Its only allegiance is
to the working class and people of our country. Its consistent objec-
tive is to promote the national welfare and advance our country's
true national interests.

The Communist Party formulates its policies independently.
It is not subject to any external allegiance or discipline either of
an organizational or political character.

The Communist Party works for friendship between all peoples
so that our country may prosper in a world at peace. In this spirit
it advocates friendship and cooperation between our country and
the socialist countries. This has been one of its major contributions
to the national welfare.

The Soviet Union, People’s China and the People’s Democracies
of Eastern Europe are socialist countries. The system of capitalist
exploitation has been abolished in these countries and, together
with it, the cause of poverty, fascism, war, national oppression and
race discrimination. From the beginning the Communist Party has
greeted and supported the efforts of the working people of these
countries to build a new life for themselves on socialist foundations.

Big Business tries to vilify these countries, to slander and defame
them, to incite hostility against them. In the interest of the Amer-
ican people the Communist Party is concerned with nailing these
lies and exposing these slanders.

The attitude of the Communist Party to these countries reﬁects
its devotion to the great principle of working class internationalism
which has deep roots in our country’s history. This tradition of
international solidarity is a proud one. The Communist Party
continues it and considers it a badge of honor.

At the same time the Communist Party recognizes that over
the years it held certain wrong and oversimpliﬁed concepts of what
its relations should ‘be to other Marxist «parties. The Party tended

57

.. C..,w..In» 5 .-

   

to accept uncritically many views of Marxists»--of other countries.
Not all these views were correct; some did not correspond to Amer-
ican conditions.

.The Party also viewed uncritical-Ly: developments in the Soviet
Union and other socialist countries. It mistakenly thought that any
public criticism of the views or policies of the Marxist parties of
these countries would weaken the bonds of international working
class solidarity or bring comfort to the enemies of peace and so-
cialism. ,

The incorrectness of this view was highlighted by the revela-
tions in Khrushchev’s special report to the 20th Congress of the
CPSU. Because it held this view, the Communist Party of our coun-
try was entirely unprepared for and deeply shocked by the admis-
sions of crimes, violations of socialist justice, mistreatment of cer-
tain national minorities, and the basis for the rupture of relations
with Yugoslavia-—all at variance with the truly liberating charac-
ter of socialism. The courage shown in making these disclosures
and the profound process of self-correction, begun some years ago
and sharply accelerated since the 20th Congress, are irrefutable
evidence of the historic role and vitality of the socialist system.

Socialism is strengthened, not weakened, by the fraternal and
constructive criticism of Marxists of many lands. Such criticism
has nothing in common with those. who deprecate the epic achieve-
ments of the USSR, People’s China and the other socialist coun-
tries or those who seek to engender hostility to socialism at home
and abroad.

Our attitude was used to refurbish the slanderous calumny
which has ‘been used historically against all radical movements in
our country—the lie that the Communist Party is “the agent of a
foreign power.”

This despicable charge is a lie cut from the whole cloth. We
are American Communists, patriots. Our allegiance is to our own
country, the United States. In representing and advancing the
fundamental welfare of the working class we aim always to serve
our country's true national interests.

The Communist Party must continue to correct the oversim-
pliﬁed relations which have existed between itself and other Marx-
ist parties. These relations must be based on the -principles of
scientiﬁc socialism, on proletarian internationalism, they must be
based on each Communist Party serving the best national interests

58

 

 

of its people and thereby the common interests of all progressive
humanity; This requires the equality and independence of Marxist
parties in the mutual discussion and resolution of common prob-
lems; the right and duty of the Communists of all countries to
engage in comradely criticism of the policies and practices of the
Communists of any country whenever they feel this necessary. This
will strengthen, not weaken, international solidarity. It will ad-
vance the cause of socialism in all countries.

Bureaucratic Concepts of Party Organization

Bureaucratic concepts of Party organization, systems of leader-
ship and relations between the Party and the masses have been a
prime factor in contributing to our errors. They hindered the early
and timely correction of these errors. Wrong concepts of leadership
discouraged full and free participation of the membership in the
discussion of policy and tactics. They ‘ stood as insurmountable
obstacles to the efforts of comrades in mass organizations to chal-
lenge sectarian policies and tactics. They contributed to the weak-
ening of inner party democracy. In many cases they resulted in
departure from the very procedures established by our own con-
stitution. They' resulted in disciplinary actions which further
inhibited expressions of disagreement. They made the life of the
party largely routine, devoted, at least between pre-convention
discussion periods, to the organization of a multitude of campaigns
characterized by inadequate examination and testing of our pol-
icies and tactics in actual life by our members in the shops and
mass organizations.

These bureaucratic methods of work, system of leadership and
organization have been accentuated in part by the mechanical ap-
plication of certain principles of organization adopted by other
Communist parties which functioned under different historical con-
ditions.

The history of factional struggle which almost destroyed our
Party in its early years gave rise to a correct desire to defend party
unity against the danger of factional splits. But this was distorted
by efforts to achieve formal unity instead of uniting the party on
the basis of principle, a full democratic inner life and free, open
discussion of differences.

This convention must completely abolish these bureaucratic

59

 

  

methods of work, organization and leadership. It must clearly
define the character of our Party and its proper method of organ-
ization and functioning.

A The Communist Party is an American working class political
party. It is a Party of white and Negro unity. It is devoted to the
struggle for the constant advancement of the welfare of the work-
ing class, the Negro people, the farming population, small busi-
nessmen and professional people. Its ultimate aim is the socialist
reorganization of society in a peaceful, constitutional manner by
the majority choice of the American people.

The Communist Party is a democratic organization based on
majority rule. It is a cohesive organization for the purpose of acting
unitedly to carry out the policies and program decided by its mem-
bers. The inner life of the Party shall be regulated by the provi-
sions and rules of its constitution which will emerge from this
convention, following prior discussion by the whole membership.
The unfolding of a correct mass policy by the Party, as well as its
ability to attract and hold masses of socialist-minded Americans,
requires extensive changes in its structure and methods of work.
Among these are the following: I

Guarantees of real inner-party democracy through provision of
channels for freedom of discussion, dissent and criticism within the
framework of carrying out the majority will.

The National Committee should issue a special publication on
a regular monthly basis devoted exclusively to articles or letters
discussing, debating or differing with party policies, whether cur-
rent or long-range. Such a publication is necessary to encourage
the greatest possible participation by the membership in the formu-
lation, correction or abandonment of policies or tactics.

The decisions of all Party bodies shall continue to be made by
majority rule. Minorities or individuals opposed to such decisions
shall be required to abide by them. But the right of such indivi-
duals or minorities to express their views shall be guaranteed in all
cases. However, this does not mean that fa-ctions—groupings with
their own platform, discipline, organization and publications set
up in opposition to the regular program, discipline, organization
and publications of the Party—can be tolerated. The whole history
of the Communist Party shows that factionalism actually destroys
inner-Party democracy and shatters Party unity. -
Between pre-convention discussion periods the National Com-

60

 

  

mittee must take special steps to involve -the membership in making
basic changes in policy. Such methods may involve setting aside
limited periods for Party-wide discussion on draft policy resolu-
tions; or convening special delegated conferences with power to act
on speciﬁc questions presented beforehand to the membership; or
the organization of referendum votes on questions.

Establishment of closest ties between membership and leader-
ship and creation of political and organizational guarantees against
bureaucratic separation of leadership from membership by the fol-
lowing:

a) Proceedings of the National Committee shall be publicized,
including digests of speeches or reports as well as votes of National
Committee members on important questions. Where possible State
Committees shall do likewise.

b) Minutes of National Board meetings shall be circulated
among all members of the National Committee. Periodic summaries
should be sent to State Committees.

c) The National Committee should be considerably enlarged.

d) The National Committee shall meet a minimum of three
times per year, with agendas and draft documents to be discussed
sent in advance to all members.

The National Committee feels that the important and deep-
going changes on questions of program, policy and organization
that it proposes for discussion will expand the opportunities of

. our members to work with ever larger sections of progressive Amer-

icans and their organizations. It will provide the basis for building
our Party into an effective Marxist organization capable of coping
with the challenging problems -before the American working class
and people. There are no valid grounds for any destructive attitude
towards the Party’s -past contributions and the vital role the Party
has to play in the future. Neither is there any justiﬁcation for pro-
posals to liquidate our Party so as to “clear the way” for a broader
party of socialism at some future time.

Another view with which the National Committee disagrees is
that the Communist Party should change its character by transform-
ing itself into an educational league which would simply ‘conduct
propaganda for socialism and for the eventual formation of .a
united socialist party. This would be a harmful retrograde step.
It flows from an abstract understanding of socialist education and
separating it from political struggles and class organization.

61

 

 

  

The foregoing two proposals are liquidationist in character.
However, others of an entirely different character have also been
offered. One such proposal is that the Communist Party become
a political action association. In the opinion of the National Com-
mittee, circumstances today do not justify such a change.

The People’s Struggles Today

In the immediate period ahead, struggles will largely focus
around the November elections and their consequences. It should
be our concern to help the labor and people’s movements bring
the decisive issues to the forefront and win significant gains.

High among these issues is the -people's standard of living: job
security, farm income, the high cost of living, the crisis in schools,
housing and health, the chronic poverty of one-ﬁfth of the nation,
segregation and discrimination.

The new outburst of struggles in the South at the opening of
the school term again highlights the central importance of the
civil rights struggle of the Negro people and their allies. Therefore
we dema-nd-full equality in"-jobs, housing, education and political
representation, and the abolition of all formsof segregation.

Vital questions affecting the civil liberties of all Americans will
be at issue ‘before the Supreme Court and the new Congress and
Administration: the Taft-Hartley Act, the ‘‘loyalty’’ program, the
Smith Act, the McCarran Act, the McCarran-Walter Act and the
demand for ‘amnesty for Smith Act prisoners. These require the
rallying of the American people to regain their lost liberties and
defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

Above all, the people's profound desire for peace and an end
to the cold war calls for concrete steps toward disarmament and a
policy of peaceful coexistence: for an end to H-bomb tests, for
drastic cuts in the arms budget and the like.

In thestruggles around these issues in the shops and commu-
nities our concern at all times must be to help ‘strengthen and unite
the organizations of labor and the people. It must be to help build
under labor’s leadership an ever more effective people's coalition
directed against the great monopolies and striving to elect a peo-
ple’s anti-monopoly government. I '

Our Party stretches out its hand to all workers and the whole
American people in the fellowship of common struggle for the goal
of peace, democracy and social progress.

Letter to Communist Party Members

To ALL MEMBERS or THE COMMUNIST PARTY
Dear Comrades:

On Lincoln’s Birthday 1957 our Party will hold its National
Convention. The National Committee in accordance with its res-
ponsibilities to the Party presents this Draft Resolution to serve as
a basis for the pre—co.nvention discussion. _

In presenting this resolution, we feel that it indicates a sound
approach for our Party towards overcoming its present isolation
and strengthening its ties with the American working class and
people; towards advancing the struggle for civil rights and security,
and the cause of democracy and peace.

It should be borne in mind that this resolution is a draft. Every-
thing in it is subject to discussion by the Party membership. Un-
doubtedly numerous amendments will result from the discussion.
Final action on the Resolution can be taken only -by the convention.

The Resolution is the result of several weeks of work by the
Resolution Committee. The Committee had before it the numerous
rich contributions made by comrades in the preceding discussion
in the Central and District Discussion Bulletins, in the letters to
the Daily Worker, in resolutions from Party clubs and sections and
in Party meetings from club to district levels.

The successive drafts were discussed in general and in detail at
two lengthy meetings of the National Committee, and the Draft
Resolution represents the collective thinking of the National Com-
mittee.

All members of the N.C. present voted for the resolution. Com-
rades Foster and Ben Davis voted “Yes” with qualiﬁcations. Each
comrade will make known the nature of his qualiﬁcations shortly
in the form of articles.

This does not mean that there were no other differences in the
Resolution Committee and in the National Committee. Minor dif-
ferences were resolved in the give and take of discussion. Major
differences on the resolution as a whole, or on important sections
of the resolution will be brought before the Party as follows:

1. The National Committee has requested members of the

6

 

 

N .C.' to give their views in forthcoming issues of Political Aﬂairs
or in the Party Discussion Bulletin which will be published every.
two weeks beginning November 1st. '

2. The N .C. will request certain of its members to write articles
explaining how the position in the Resolution on various key
questions was arrived at. l

3. The National Committee is making its members available

to speak at membership meetings and meetings of Party committees
at all levels throughout the country.
, The National «Committee acknowledges the widespread criticism
in the ranks of the Party, of our failure to participate adequately
in the discussion in the -past few months. There have been three
meetings of the National Committee since the April session. The
last two meetings revolved around the preliminary drafts of this
resolution. The N.C. decided that the most fruitful way to bring
the thinking of its members to the Party was through the publica-
tion of the Draft Resolution and subsequent individual articles
and discussions at Party meetings. In doing this, the N.C. now
recognizes that it had made inadequate preparations for participa-
tion in the general discussion in the interim.

We are conscious of the fact that the Resolution has certain
weaknesses. It is over-long. It does not deal with the speciﬁc prob-
lems in the ﬁeld of work among the youth, the farmers, in the
women's movements or in the ﬁeld of cultural work, with the ques-
tion of Social-Democracy, nor in suﬂicient detail with the situation
and developments in the labor movement. Additional material on
these questions and particularly on the Negro question and the right
of self-determination will be issued in the course of the discussion.
It does not deal adequately with the new questions in the ﬁeld
of economics arising from the new situation that we confront today.
These questions require extended study of the facts and the Na-
tional Committee is appointing a special commission to develop
such studies.

The discussion of the Resolution in the districts and lower
organizations of the Party should be combined with a discussion
of the concrete developments and trends among the masses in the
states and counties, as well as an examination of the work of the
respective Party organizations.

While the Resolution is reaching the Party as promised in the
middle of September, the formal pre-convention discussion will not
