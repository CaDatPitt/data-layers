Retrial of seven past and present Mine-Mill leaders on charges of conspiracy to file
false non-communist affidavits has been scheduled for August 27' in Denver. _
The seven are President Al Skinner, Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter, Board

 Member,Raymond Dennis, International Reps. Charles Wilson and Jesse Van Camp,

Administrative Assistant Harold Sanderson, and former Secretary-Treasurer Maurice

Travis.

Handling the defense again
will be Brig. Gen. Telford Tay-
lor, chief prosecutor of Nazi
war criminals in Nuremburg;
Mine-Mill General Counsel Na-
than Witt; and George Francis

of Denver.

According to Witt, the de-

‘fense will call witnesses to.

testify as to the character of
the defendants and as to the
union's motivation in finally
the .. now-re-
pealed affidavit provision of the
Taft-Hartley act.

Many important sections of
the labor movement and the
liberal community have ap-
pealed to the government to
stop its persecution of Mine-
Mill. Over the years the gov-
ernment has spent millions of
taxpayers’ dollars in its unsuc-
cessful attempts to pin the Red

 label on Mine-Mill.

Among the unions supporting"

, Mine-Mill defense both morally

and financially are the Auto
Workers, Packinghouse, Meat

‘ Cutters, Transport, 0il-Chem-

Assn, Tsumeb ma...
Sign Continuation pact

, The American Smelting & Refining Company has
announced that agreement has been reached with the
Tsumeb mine in South Africa to continue shipments. of

’ lead concentrate to the United States.

Tsumeb, which is building its own smelter, had

originally planned ‘to cut off
shipments to the U. S. Such a
stoppage would have forced a
virtual shutdown of AS&R’s cus-
tom smelter in El Paso, Tex.

AS&R Vice President Douglas
Soutar stated that Tsumeb ton-
nage will be slightly reduced
from present shipments. This
reduction, however, should have
little or no impact on employ-

, ment at the company’s lead

smelters.

Mine-Mill Secretary-Treasurer
Irving Dichter, who is also co-
ordinator of the -AS&R Council,

 said that ‘,‘The' ‘vigorous cam- -

paign carried ?on by our union
exerted considerable pressure

 

on both the Tsumeb Mining
Company and the Government
to assure the continued ship-
ments of these lead concen-
trates. Those. AS&R local un-
ions who participated in the
delegation to Washington can
take pride in the feeling that
this delegation in all probability
forced the issue to a head,”
Dichter also sent a letter to

the Senators and Representa-4},

tives who assisted in the cam-
paign, expressing “the sincerest
appreciation of our International
Union and our American Smelt-
ing and Refining membership

_for- your assistance in securing

STATEMENT OF W. A. "TONY" BOYLE
International President
. United Mine Workers of America

“I am fully familiar with the hazards of metal mining and
the need for safety legislation such as that recently introduced
in Congress. My father, two brothers, and I worked in the Butte
mines. In addition, three of my- uncles died while working in the
Butte mines. Two uncles’ lives were claimed by that dreadful
disease of silicosis, contracted due to lack of ventilation and wet
drilling. Another uncle was burned to death in the horrible
Speculator disaster of 1917 which claimed 162 lives.

“Although there have been enormous improvements in min-
ing techniques since those days, safety and health -standards
in the metal mines still are antiquated and must be improved.

“Federal legislation to protect the metal miners and smelter-
men is long overdue. The United Mine Workers of America
pioneered many years ago similar legislation for the men em-

years to secure the passage of the first Federal Coal Mine Safety
Act. We know the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union faces
a similar battle but our organization will support your fight for
improved health and safety standards for your members.”

New executive board meets

The new Mine-Mill Executive Board, meeting in Denver July 15-24, undertook a
thorough review of the entire operation of the International Union. Among the topics
under consideration were bargaining, organization, budget, civil rights, legislative and
political action, and legal defense. , ,

Several days were consumed in a ‘detailed examination of a budgetary system pro-

_ posed by Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter and eventually adopted by the Board.

The new budget goes into effect immediately and requires a strict monthly accounting
of all funds handled by the national office and each District office.

With respect to next year’s
bargaining with the major non-
ferrous producers, the board
considered Research Director
Arthur Stuart's report on bar-

gaining trends in other indus- .-
tries and bargaining resolutions-

adopted -by the Convention in
January. ‘

It was agreed that job secur-
ity issues would be the heart
of the bargaining program.
Items considered under this
heading included supplemental
unemployment benefits, im-
proved s ev e r a n c e provisions,
early retirement with full re-

tirement pay, extended vaca-
tions, double-time for overtime,

protection of seniority and job_

preference for transferred work-
ers in event of shutdown, and
several other items. . »
Detailed reports of the Board’s
actions are presented on Pg. 3.

CHICAGO AMALGAMATED LOCAL 758 has reached agree-

Company on a package worth 15c in wages and 5c in fringe bene-

CONTRIBUTIONS from Local 758 to Chicago civil rights or-

between the Chicago chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) and the Chicago Area Friends of the Student Nonviolent

YOU CAN’T WIN ’EM ALL, but Perth Amboy Local 365 has
won two of its last three arbitration cases. One case had to do with
accrued unused vacation time. Some workers had been laid off
before taking all their vacation time for the year. When they were
recalled after the new year, the company refused to allow them
their unused vacation time, since they have a policy of “no two
vacations in one year.” The arbitrator ruled that the men were
entitled to their vacation for that year and their unused vacation
time from the preceding year.

Another outstanding victory was in the case of a Brother who
acquired a skin disease while working for the Company. The man
filed for compensation, and received it, whereupon the Company
fired him. The union protested, the case went to arbitration, and
the arbitrator ruled in favor of the union.

The union lost a case in which the question was whether a
member was entitled to overtime. The arbitrator ruled that the
company acted properly in holding the man for overtime.

Arguing for the union in these cases were David Mandel, at-
torney; District 5 Board Member Alfred Petit-Clair; and Local 365
President John Infusino. '

SEVERANCE PAY totalling some $30,000 has been paid to 33
Kennecott employees in Bayard, N.M., reports S. Q. Merino, Presi-

1962, and 23 laid off in January of this year.

JOHN H. STEVENS, one of the organizers of Local 51 in Selby,
Cal., died in May at the age of 79. .

In 1934, he took the lead in breaking the company union and
organizing the Independent Union of Smelter Workers, which in
October of that year became Mine-Mill Local 51. In 1935 he led
the strike which forced the AS&R management to recognize the
union.

Stevens. did not -confine his activities to the Selby plant alone
but worked wherever locals were forming, notably with the gold
miners in the Mother Lode Country around Jackson, Cal., where
organizers were facing vigilantes and threats of jail.

In 1940, Stevens organized a credit union in the plant. He con-
tinued to serve the union even after retirement in 1954. Stevens

Banner strike  

In third month

TUCSON-Local 929’s strike
against the Banner Mining Com-
pany is entering its third month
with no settlement in sight.

As reported in the last issue
of The Union, Mine-Mill repre-
sentatives‘ were served on June
25 with a temporary restrain-
ing order obtained by the Ban-
ner management from Superior
Court Judge Krucker of Pima
County. The company had al-
leged, under oath, that there
had been violence, name call-
ing, illegal mass picketing, etc.

When a hearing was held on
the injunction, with the Com-
pany trying to have the injunc-
tion made permanent, it de-
veloped that the allegations
made by management were
simply. not true. All that had
happened was that one car,
with four occupants, had volun-

tarily‘ turned back, apparently‘

because the riders didn’t want
to cross the picket line.

Nevertheless, the Judge an-
nounced that he would be will-
ing to make the order perma-
nent, and asked the Company

‘ to provide the union with a list

of necessary maintenance per-
sonnel who would be entering
the property. Attorneys for Ban-
ner said the company would not
be willing to do that.

At this time the order is still
temporary. The union strike
committee has announced that
if and when a permanent in-
junction is issued they will ap-
peal to higher courts. A

“In this case,” said the strike
committee, “issuance of an in-
junction is equivalent to saying
that an injunction is issuable
merely because the presence of
pickets caused some people to

refrain from entering the prop-'

erty. In other words, if a picket
line is effective, it is automati-
cally branded as violent." ;

The Strike Committee con-V
sists of Nicolas V. Morelos,.

Theodore Martinez, C e n o b i o
Robles, and Frank Gandara.

A second contribution of $1500
has been ordered from the In-
ternational Strike Fund to aid
the Banner miners. Further
contributions have been made
recently by Locals 551, 890, 392,
586, 509, and 616.

Local 758 began an organizational campaign at the

fired; the union maintained that they had been dismissed
for union activity and filed an unfair labor practice charge
against the company. During the hearings the company
agreed to give the women back pay but refused to rein-
state them. The complaint was not pressed because the
women did not want the jobs. This has stymied the organi-

Exec vows battle
To defend union  

Following is a statement issued by the International

 Executive board regarding the forthcoming retrial of
 union leaders on Taft-Hartley “conspiracy” charges:

This meeting of the a newly constituted Executive

"Board of our Union has outlined a far-reaching program .

of activity on bargaining, mine safety, the problems of

members in that industry. We

‘ recognize‘ that the successful

carrying out of our program
depends on the strength and

«unity we can bring to bear in

hese_ ‘fields.

.';‘Basic to” that strength is the
successful defense of our broth-

ers, who are involved in fighting
the false charge of conspiracy,

. . under .a section of the Taft-Hart-
, ley act which was repealed four

years ago, in a case which has

7 f been in the courts for seven
I years. We repeat what we have

declared t h r 0 u g h o u t those
years; the charges are false,

I there has never been any con-
 spiracy, and we know that ulti-
‘ mately we will be vindicated.

We extend our thanks to those

— . in labor who have backed us-

from Auto, Packing, Meat Cut-

I A ters, ‘the Farmers Union, Trans-
port"; from- Oil-Chemical,’ Team-

the non-ferrous industry, and the well-being of our

sters Pulp-S u 1 p h i t e, Retail- ,

Wholesale; and from the NMU,
Amalgamated Clothing, Sleep-
ing Car Porters, Lithographers,
UE and Longshore. We thank,
too, Norman Thomas, the
American Civil Liberties Union,
and the thousands of individuals
who have supported us’.

The backbone of our defense,
and the assurance of our suc-
cess lies as it always has, in
the sustained support and unity
of the rank and file members
and the locals of our union. We
call upon them to implement.
our convention resolution for all-
out support-—moral and finan-
cial—to the union’s defense of
our brothers.

We dedicate the full resources

of our union and the unswerving _

loyalty of our members, to the
vindication‘ of our ‘brothers and
our union.

  Mine-Mill Civl Rights Action Program

,— Following is the text of the
resolution on civil rights adopt-

ed by the International Execu-

tive Board at its meeting July
25:._ i ‘ '

‘ I The great struggle for equal-

ity of’ rights being carried on
today by the Negro people and

’ other minority groups is of the

utmost importance to all Amer-

O icans of whatever color hr na-

tional origin. Upon the success
of this movement depends the

_ progress of all our citizens.»-

. The labor movement as a

ize that the Negro’s fight is la-

grolrights and the enemies of
theﬁlabor movement are the.

tionary section ofvthe‘ Republi-
can *party, I and big business.
These. enemies have united and
are united in opposition ,to, com-
mon objectives of the Negro

Act, Medicare, the minimum

wage law, aid-to-education-—'-to / '
name a few. '

/‘

. Mine-Mill has long been asso-
eiated with other proud sections
of,‘ the American. labor move-
ment which have played a lead-
ing role in the fight for ‘civil

I ‘rights and civil liberties of our

tizens. In the past, year other

iaiinions long indifferent to the
._ problem of civil rights have

joined the struggle.

 For more than half a century

our international constitution
has upheld the right of every-
one, regardless of race, color,

. or. creed to membership in our
‘ union and to employment in our

jurisdiction. Non-discrimination
clauses are standard in our la-

.bor-management contracts.

‘These provisions have been
backed by action, and we can
point to a record of solid

' achievement over the years. One

of the most important reasons
for the organization of workers
in our industry in the early
years of this century arose from
the need to unite different na-
tional groups, recently arrived
in this country and separated
from each other by lack of a
common language; Callous em-
ployers sought to exploit the dif-
ferences inherent, in, this situa-_

- tion_ by playing one group off
A against another. Our union has

\

been in the forefront of the
struggle for equal job opportuni-
ties in the South, and has led
the way in the elimination of
job and -pay discrimination
against Mexican-American work-
ers in the Southwest..In the Mid-
west and on the east and west
Coasts, Negro and "white. work-
ers have worked side by side for
many years at plants under con-
tract with Mine-Mill.

We have fought for equal pay
and equality of job opportunities
for two .reasons—it. is morally
right where any deviation from
this standard is morally wrong;
and because an injury to one

1.3

group of workers, be it discrim-
ination or any other injustice, is
an injury to all. One has only
to look at the depressed levels
of wages in the South for white
and Negro workers alike to ap-
preciate the all embracing. ef-
fect of discriminatory and sub-

standard wages and working
conditions imposed upon a mi-
nority group. The long-standing
regional differentials in non-fer-
rous mining wage rates, sub-
stantial vestiges of which still
remain, furnish another example

llluirtlihlinlllus ingtnn ﬂugust 253*“

of the pervasive influence of this
egl practice.

[At this present moment in the
historic struggle for the removal
of civil disabilities, the Presi-
dent has laid before Congress
broad and significant legislative
proposals to secure to all the en-
joyment of all facilities open to
the general public, to speed the
process of school desegregation,
to insure fair and full employ-
ment by anti-discrimination leg-
islation-applicable both to em-
ployers and to unions, to provide
greater protection for the right

funds when it finds the money

  
   

us: Megan};

is used in a discriminatory way,
and to establish a Community
Relations Service to help solve
racial disputes and ease social
tension at the community level.
This legislative program must
and will be enacted.

In the momentous weeks
ahead of us as the President’s
broad program is debated in
Congress, we propose a pro-
gram of renewed activity in the
field of civil rights to involve
every Mine-Mill local in all sec-
tions of the country. Our paper,

/

the Mine-Mill Union, will give
increasing emphasis in forth-
coming issues to the important
role we call upon every section
of our union to play. We present
the following program of action
to our membership:

1. National Civil Rights Fund
Raising Campaign: We propose
that every Mine-Mill local es-
tablish a fund raising commit-
tee to raise the funds to assist
the national civil rights organi-
zations in. pushing their efforts
to asuccessful conclusion. Many
local unions are already con-
tributing funds directly to these
organizations; We ask all locals
in the future to channel such
contributions through the mine-
mill Human Rights Committee,
composed of your International
Eecutive Board, headed up by
the three National Officers. Lo-
cals can earmark contributions
for designated‘ organizations.
Contributions not so earmarked
will be distributed to Negro or-
ganizations or campaigns ap-
pearing to be most in need of
aid, or to those pursuing im-
portant national or local objec-
tives. _ ,

2. Employment at Companies
with Mine-Mill Contracts‘:
call upon all local unions to ex-
amine the problem of civil
rights on the job within their
jurisdictions. We still have, un-
fortunately, several locals at
plants where the work force is
not integrated. At some other
plants where employment is
open to members of all races,

— promotion is slow or non-exist-

ent for members of minority
races, or employment in certain
departments is denied to them.
We call upon all locals where
these conditions are found, to
correct them. Where such ef-
forts are not successful, local
unions. should enlist the support
of the International Union, and
involve local civil rights organi-
zations and state civil rights
commissions where they exist
in obtaining the cooperation of
employers in correcting abuses.

3. Local Community Action:
Local unions in all areas should
extend full support to local ac-
tivities of civil rights organiza-
tions—such as rallies, demon-
strations, delegations and lob-
bies. Especially in August, lo-
cals in a position to do so should
give all support to the ‘united
march on Washington on the
28th of that month, and should,
where possible, participate di-
rectly. They should participate
actively on the broadest possible

basis in jointaction on programs
of religious and civic organiza-
tions, the non-discrimination pro-
gram of the United States Em-
ployment Service, ' the Federal
Fair Employment P r a c ti c e s
Commission and comparable
state and local governmental
bodies.

, Human rights belong to no
man either to bestow or to with-
hold; they belong to every man
by virtue of his humanity, and
it is only the recognition of his
humanity which the Negro now
demands. He will not be ‘denied.

 FREEDOMIIOAD nnsuo msrunu

By Asbury Howard
International Vice-President

O0 OFTEN, in my opinion, our politicians and statesmen talk

about the fight for democracy, abroad as a defense of the
“American Way of Life.” I say, let’s assure democracy for every-
body right here at home before we make such a fuss about selling
it abroad.

Democracy must be made to work in these United States not
so much for how we look to the rest of the
people of the world but for how we look to
ourselves. - = .« 1

It is a long, hard, and uphill journey to the

for us there is no return. As the Lord liveth
we will make the journey. One hundred years
now we havebeen marching up the road to
freedom and democracy: a way station near

The right to vote is our guarantee of equal,

law, of equal participation in the privileges
and advantages of American life. We _,seek .’
theballot not to misuse anyone, but rather
to keep others from misusing us. '

HERE is power in the ballot. The southern politician fears

nothing so much as the ballot. Let’s take a few examples from
the State of Mississippi, A. D. 1955. In Belzoni, Miss., there were
92 Negroes whose names were on the voters’ rolls. The White

Citizen Council began a drive to remove them from the lists, and
threats were sufficient to convince 90 of the 92 that they had no
business being registered to vote. The remaining two were Rev.
G. W. Lee and Gus Courts. ‘

On May 7, 1955, Rev. Lee was shot dead on the main street
of Belzoni, No arrest. One more to go.

' _ Gus Courts was threatened and told that the same thing that
happened to Rev. Lee would happen to him if he refused to co-
operate. Courts stood his ground, however, and the Citizens Council
went into operation. The store Courts was renting was no longer
for rent. Mr. Courts moved.

He found another store and moved in. One night while waiting
on a customer, a pick-up truck appeared in front of the store,
someone in the truck fired, and Gus Courts fell Wounded. This
was two blocks from where Rev. Lee had been killed. No arrest.
But Gus Courts survived and his name was still on the books.

at ‘k ‘Ar

N AUGUST 13, Lamar Smith, a Negro leader, was told not

to urge Negroes to vote in the Mississippi primary. Smith
voted and convinced some others to do likewise. The next day
Smith was called to the courthouse. As. he approached the court-
house he was shot dead in the presence of some 20 witnesses. An
arrest was made but the grand jury refused tohand down an
indictment for “lack of evidence.” -

That was eight years ago, in the State of Mississippi. In June,
1963, Medgar Evers was shot dead in Jackson, Miss. His crime
was the same as that of Lee, Courts, and Smith. .

But Negroes continue to register to vote in Mississippi. In

' Leﬂore County, home of Baldwin Pianos, the drive was so success-

ful that white county officials, in reprisal, cut off distribution -of
government surplus commodities. Between cotton picking and
cotton planting the county’s 20,000 Negroes‘ are almost entirely
dependent on this government food for subsistence. A national
campaign, spearheaded by Negro comedian Dick Gregory, sent
hundreds of tons of food to Mississippi in trucks contributed by
the Teamsters. Finally, the intervention of the Agriculture and
Justice Departments took the, heat off. I

. ‘k ‘k. * I .
HE BATTLE for the ballot will continue until it is won by

mass action, or the federal government assumes its constitu-
tional responsibility of guaranteeing “to every state a republican
form of governmen .” ' - _

In the words ofsongs popular in the freedom movement, We
will never turn back. We shall overcome.

"are some things you’ll need to

know. The Administration om-

.before the House as HR 7152;
‘and is being considered by the
_J_udiciary Committee -at current
hearings. In‘ the Senate, the
"complete bill is_ numbered S.

. 1731 and was co-sponsored by

.46 Senators (37 Democrats, 9
Republicans); this bill was re-
.ferred to the Judiciary Commit-
tee where it will be pigeonholed
by Chairman Eastland. Another
bill, S. 1732, incorporates only
the public accommodations pro-
posal. and is presently being
considered by the Senate Com-
merce Committee. The final im-
portant bill, S. 1750, includes all
the Administration program ex-
cept the public accommodations
section; this is the so-calle

Dirksen bill. -

A Deal in the Making

Already it’s being said that s

the key public accommodations
section has been “doomed” by
s t r o n g Republican opposition.
Without substantial GOP sup-
port, the Administration can’t
muster enough votes to over-

, come a Dixiecrat filibuster. The

most likely’ outcome, runs the
talk, is a deal to trade away the
substance of the public accom-
modations section‘ for support
behind the less meaningful pro-
visions. Republican liberals, led
by Senators Kuch el, J avits,
Fong and trthers are fighting

against such a sellout. ’ ,

PERMANENT llllEMl’I.0YMEllT 1

By Al Skinner ’
International President

IVE MILLION unemployed Americans today have less hope of
going back to work or finding another steady job than the »
jobless have had in any other period of American history. Why? —

The unemployed worker today is out of a job not because of “bad

times”-—or a “recession”——or a “depression.” He’s out of "work

at a time when all the production, profit, and other business \

barometers are going up to higher and higher levels.

- Auto and Steel._Produetion Up-—-Employment Down ~
The Auto industry in July. broke all production records for a‘
the best automobile
sales year in history. But did employment '-
in the .industry reach record levels?‘ The

than it took to turn out five million cars

7 "‘_Morey:than 200,000 workers "in ‘basic "steel 7 '
have lost their jobs in -the past’_five'years“

should be one of the‘ best years on record. ‘ "
This is not only a trend; it’s a revolu-
tion in production methods in every basic '
industry in America. And the problem won’t, ‘ y .
go away—-this revolution is just beginning. - Skinner
Employment in Mining and Smelting

OR the past ten years, productionper man hour in themining» i

and smelting industry has been increasing steadily every year
while the number of miners, millmen,- smeltermen, and refinery
workers employed in almost every major operation has’ declined..

Every member of our union has seen the effectsof this industrial ‘ 7}: .

revolution in our industry. It’s being done with improved machinery,

. faster and heavier transportation equipment, reduced maintenance,

elimination-of processes and jobs, adding work andduties to ex-
isting jobs——and just plain speedup. Getting more production with
fewer men has become an exact science practiced by men trained -
in the use of the stop watch, the slide rule, the study of human :
behavior, and methods of production. Some mining.com‘panie's have
installed closed-circuit television systems. and "control booths to
watch and study both employees and production. , . '
Montana, and Utah Examples ,

The Anaconda Company is now completingconstruction work

on a new modern mill or concentrator at ‘Butte. With approxi-

mately 50 employees this new “autogenous” mill will replace al- 0 . s
most 300 men doing the same work at the old concentrator and  .

foundry in Anaconda, Mont. , v

The Kennecott Copper Corporation recently. announced a four-
year, $100 million “expansion program” in the Utah. Division-
Kennecott was going to increase production by 50 per cent in four

. years. Everyone in Utah was happy. The newspapers carried head- , , __
lines and “prosperity” stories. A more sober examination of the7“’.i ..
program showed that this tremendous increase in production’ _ ._ _
would probably not add one single employee to the payroll! Such T ‘ ’ 7
are the “benefits” of this industrial revolution.‘ Remember when *

thepress used to feed us,storie_s about company profits and com-.-,' 

pany prosperity making more jobs for more people?

A What Can We Do About It? _ I
ULTIPLY our own experiences a thousand times by what is .
happening in every plant, foundry, factory, and industrial

operation in North America. Add this ‘rapidly increasing loss of‘

jobs, in a period of so-called prosperity, to the five million already 
permanently unemployed. What do you get? You get what. is » -

shaping up to be the greatest economic crisis in the history of our
country, because this is not temporary—this is permanent elimina-
tion of jobs. _ _

The present railroad dispute involving the elimination of almost

100,000 jobs is just the beginning. Our government, the major fl
corporations, and the labor movement must recognize that this

is a problem that won’t go away and can’t be swept under the rug.
It’s a lot more important to millions of Americans than the prob- '
lem of putting a man on the moon. It certainly ‘deserves as much
attention by our government. -

The Shorter Work Week and Early Retirement

Our local unions should fight and resist every attempt by the‘
companies to double up workloads and job duties, and pure plain ~

speedup. This is a form of wagecutting which should not be tole-

rated by any local union. No union has and no union can, however,
successfully fight
the wind.‘ '

HE GOAL of every union in‘America should be to eliminate ~ ‘ ‘
the personal hardship and disaster resulting from the loss of ~ .

jobs due to automation. The fight of every trade union must be a
fight to maintain maximum employment, despite automation, by

bringing to the men we represent the benefits of a shorter work "
- week (at 40’hours’ pay) and earlier retirement (at full retirement
' pay). The men who work. must not become. the. tragic victims of
. automation. The -whole country will pay. the consequences if this ‘
, is allowed to happen. - ‘ ll ” - ‘

If we as a nation can ‘produce only so much, then let’s spread

‘the available work ‘among the ' greatest" number of people by _ 

reducing the work week. And let’s lower the retirement age--with

‘full compensation—-so that millions of older workers can enjoy \ ,1

their retirement andmillions of young people can find jobs. This

’ problem, cannot be solved with “gimmicks” and patch-work form-
. ulas. It-will be solved only when the trade union movement and

our ‘government become concerned enough to face the issue
squarely and seek a sensible solution. _ -_

Mexican Seaman Stranded 47 Days in L.  Harbort

"WILMINGTON, Cal.-~Twenty-
one Mexican sailors were
stranded on a rusty tanker in
Los Angeles harbor for 47 days
without fresh food or water, and
virtually imprisoned by armed
guards who kept them from
leaving the ship. They were
stranded within sight of the
largest city on the West Coast.

They were without officers,
close to starvation, unable to
communicate with anyone on
shore, and told in no uncertain
terms by immigration officers
that they couldn’t get off the
ship, even to buy food.

But they finally found a friend
-—John Antonio Maduro, a stew-
ard in Local 13 of the In-

Lternational Longshorernen’s_ and

Warehousemen’s Union. Ma-
duro, a 64-year-old winch driv-
er, has been a seaman and
waterfront worker for over 40
years.

The ship, Articulo 32 Con-
stitucional, was out of Vera
Cruz, Mexico. She had been in.
port in a ship repair yard for
some time when Maduro heard
of the sailors’ plight. He was
denied admittance to the ship
without the written permission
of the captain or owner. But
the ship had no_ captain or own-
er, he discovered. . '

Determined to talk to the
crew, he waited until dark and
swam to the vessel. The story
he heard was fantastic.

When the ship arrived March
5 the captain found that the

company, Flota Mercantile Na-

cional, had gone broke. The ship
had a spare propeller worth
thousands of dollars, but it dis-
appeared along with the cap-
tain, his officers and engineers.

Deserted by their officers, the
crew appealed to the Mexican

help. They were told that free-
dom, of the port expired on
April 28. The crew remained
on board although they were al-
most totally out of food.

When Maduro boarded the
poor sailors had only half a
sack of beans left. There were
no cigarettes, matches, and no
one had been allowed to go to
church or mail a letter to his
faily.

Maduro immediately contacted
newspapers, his congressman
George Brown, and ILWU
President Harry Bridges, who
pledged full support of the un-
ion.

Shortly thereafter food was
brought aboard by Maduro and
friends, and the incident was
nationally publicized in the
press and on television. A U. S:

ers to $2.21.

Most of the drilling firms not

 

struck had previously agreed to ,

union. ’
The union’s victory was won ‘

in the face of a conciliation
board majority which recom-_
mended no wage increase and
no change in the agreement in
effect with individual compa-
nies.

District President Harvey
Murphy congratulated the strik-
ers on their victory, which es-
tablishes the first general agree-
ment in their history and wage
scales which are far above those
of diamond drillers any place in
Canada.

According to Murphy, the set-
tlement will have the effect of
bringing into the diamond drill-
ers section of Mine-Mill dia-
mond drillers in other parts of
Canada, and will particularly
influence the negotiations for
the diamond drillers in the
Northwest Territories at Yellow-
knife and Pine Point.

American Sr-neltingvand Refining Co._, _in making a 29 percent,
gain over 1961, recorded its highest net profit since 1956. St. Joe’s
profits were down, of course, because of the long strike at its Mis-'

souri mines. All companies producing lead and zinc should show‘
very substantial increases in profits this year due to higher‘

prices. Note that American Zinc and Bunker Hill did well last
year despite depressed prices. Copper companies will continue
to do well, although a few will attempt to show lower profits by an
old bookkeeping device. The trick is to charge long run outlays
for expansion of capacity to current expenses, to the maximum
extent that the Internal‘.Revenue Service will allow. This results

5 in lower income taxes, and conceals the build-up in the true value

of the company’s plant investment.

ANACONDA will soon resume drilling north and west of Ken-

controlled by Anaconda. Reports in the press indicate that discus-
sions between the two companies regarding development and oper-
ation of the Anaconda claims have been resumed recently, after
having been suspended a few years ago. Anconda’s drilling, so the
story goes, will furnish the geologic and engineering information
on which a deal for sale of the Anaconda claims could be worked

SOUTH AFRICA is the scene of the latest big copper mining
and smelting development. Paloraba Mining Company has ob-
tained $104 million to finance, a large 1,200 foot deep open pit and
smelter with a capacity of 80,000 tons of copper-per year. New-
mont Mining Company, New York mining stock holding company,
and American Metal Climax will together have about 35 percent
interest in the new company.

, LEAD AND ZINC made the headlines last month. Lead went
up 1A cent in price July 2 and again on-July 23, ending up at 11%
cents.’ This is the fifth rise since November last year, when lead
was ‘at a 15-year-low of 9% cents. Zinc, did even better, going up
1/2 -cent on-July 1 and again on July 29 to 121/2 cents per pound.
Zinc last sold at this figure in December, 1960. . 6

This encouraging showing has been supported by an upsurge‘

in utilization of both metals by U. S. industry. -Zinc -has been
helped by the auto industry, which has increased average «pound-

age of galvanized sheet per car from less than 20 pounds ten years

ago, to more than 130 pounds this year. Zinc die castings are also
doing well, despite competition from plastics. ‘Weight of zinc ‘die
castings in leading ‘cars has increased as follows: '

_ Pounds, 1959 Pounds, 1962
Buick ’ 81.3 ‘ 127.8
Chevrolet 55.8 . — 84.8
Cadillac 90.3 — 131.8
Plymouth J 27.6 54.9 A
Ford -__-- 57.0 64.8
Lincoln 84 2 149.7

Lead, long in the doldrums, is also showing signs of life.‘ Use
of lead in the first four months of 1963 was 8 percent above the
same period last year, and best since 1957. This gain is due mainly
to increased use of lead in gasoline and in batteries. Excessive

‘producers’ stocks have been reduced ‘by the jump in sales and

by the long strike at St. Joe.

Theneed to compete with Japanese and European smelters
for shrinking world supplies of concentrates has also had its ef-
fect on price movements in the U. S. Japan, already a large

scale buyer of Canadian concentrates, is reported as seeking con- '

tracts for up to 50,000 additional tons per year. Recent completion
of a zinc smelter in ‘Bulgaria has put that country in the market
for Peruvian and Mexican concentrates, where previously it ex-
ported concentrates to other countries. The market will get tight-
er next year with completion of a new 30,000 ton per year zinc
smelter at Saltillo, Mexicol The Wall Street Journal attributes the
latest hike in the U. S. price of zinc to the competition of foreign
smelters for concentrates.

»In lead, Mine-Mill has just won its fight to keep the El Paso
smelter in operation, in the face of foreign competition (see story,
page 2). Another development is the recent Treasury Department
report that Canada shipped less than one-third of its lead concen-
trate quota to the U. S. in the April-June quarter this year. Specu-
lation is that Japan _has outbid U. S. smelters for lead concentrates
from some Canadian mines.

At the recent Young GOP convention here a battle

platform which, in part, called -
for U. S. withdrawal from the

A five-week strike of 500 Afri-

Refineries was settled in mid-
July. The strike started in pro--
test over hiring of a white brick-
layer who had shoved an_Afri-
can assistant. The local union
president was fired‘ after calling
the men off the job, allegedly
for assaulting a white foreman.
The strikers refused _to return

special correspondent of the
American Metal’ Market, daily
U. S. metal trade paper, reports
and comments from the scene
as follows: - «

"The publication recently of
the annual report for 1962 of the
Northern Rhodesian Department
of Labor revealed 552,053 work-
ing days were lost in the min-
ing industry in 24 strikes involv-
ing 449 Europeans and 45,033
Africans. — ~

“This series of strikes, the
report says, rudely disturbed
the comparative peace of the
three previous years, leading to
a ‘loss without parallel since the
year 1958."

“The report goes on to com-
ment that many of the strikes
were unconstitutional and might
have been avoided had the ag-
grieved party made further use

ofthe negotiating and conciliay’ . H

tion machinery available before ’
resorting to a‘ withdrawal of
labor. Searching for reasons for
the rise in the number of
disputes, the report suggests
that ‘employes in lower paid
jobs" were not prepared to
put up with unreasonable treat-
ment and insisted on more per-
sonal consideration as indi-
viduals.’ In other words the
African labor force was on the
march.

“Certainly, after the territo-
rial elections in October, 1962,
there were many unconstitution-
al strikes usually directed at in-
dividual European supervisors.
But the excesses brought about
by electoral victory have now
subsided and the employers

“This last extract gives some
idea of the complete change in
emphasis which has taken place V
in labor relations in the Copper-
belt; what is important now is
not what the European thinks of
the African, but what the Afri-
can thinks of the European.”

Anaconda con mine safety improves

In a follow-up inspection of
the Anaconda Company's Moun-
tain Con mine at Butte, Mon-
tana, earlier this year, the
U. S. Bureau of Mines noted 44
separate safety improvements
resulting from recommendations
after the first inspection of the
mine in 1962. However, the fol-
low-up report noted,. the com-
pany had failed to follow

through on nine recommenda-
tions made in 1962. Among these
were:

0 The sheave platform and
structural steel members of the
headframe should be cleaned
and excess dirt and grease re-
moved.

0 Rock, dirt and excess ma-
terial should be removed from
behind the rungs of ladders and

rungs should be replaced.

0 Periodic‘ random checks
should be made with a torque-
wrench to determine that rock
bolts are torqued properly.

0 Power cables should be sup-
ported high enough to prevent

individuals from contacting the -

cable and to prevent mechanical
damage by equipment and tools.

0 Sections of rock bolts that
extend into haulageways or pas-
sageways should be removed.

. The follow-up report listed 28 _

additional recommendations de-
signed to bring conditions in this
mine up to federal safety stand-
ards. Included in the additional
recommendations were the fol-

_ OThe ladder -in the motor

house should be replaced.

0 Each 1,000 detonators is
considered equal to 1% pounds

Table of Distances approved by
the Institute of Makers of Ex-
plosives that an unbarricaded
building containing the amount
of explosives in the fuse make-
up house should be 250 feet from
the shaft or inhabited buildings.

0 Underground explosives and
detonator storage should be at
least 25 feet from any haulage-
way or travelway.

I UMW Sponsors
Amendments

‘ United Mine Workers of Amer-
ica are pushing hard to close
a big loophole in the Federal
Coal Mine Safety Act. Eighteen
bills, all similar, have been in-
troduced to amend the mine
safety law to bring small mines

u n d e r the enforcement pro-_

visions of the Act. Mines em-
ploying 14 or fewer men under-
ground are exempt from close-
down orders by Federal coal
mine inspectors. There are thou-
sands of these mines in opera-

proximately one-third of the an-
nual fatalities in the coal in-
dustry despite the fact that they
produce only about 12 per cent
of‘ the underground coal. The
UMWA has been trying for 13
years to tighten up the law.

Another bill seeks to eliminate
the “grandfather clauses” in
the coal mine safety act. These
clauses permit the use in-
definitely into the future of

equipment declared unsafe by e
the U. S. Bureau of Mines, pro- '

vided the equipment was in use
prior to passage of the coal
mine safety law. ‘

Mine-Mill’s proposed safety
law for metal and other non-
coal mines (the Metca1f-Mon-
toya bill, see story on page 1)
does not contain either of these
‘,‘s1eepers” which have pulled
some of the teeth out of the law
for coal mines. Mine operators
can be counted on to try to in-
sert such clauses at some stage
in the forthcoming fight over
the Metcalf-Montoya hill.

3 or M Rules ..
Explosion Cause

“A prolonged interruption of
face ventilation” led to the April
25 explosion that claimed the
lives of 22 miners at the Clinch-
field,Coal Company mine near
Clarksburg, West Virginia. This
is the conclusion of the final re-

port on the disaster released on
July 8‘ by the U. s. Bureau of
Mines. »

In a section of the report en-
titled “Cause of Explosion” the
Bureau stated: '

“This disaster was caused by
the ignition of the body of
methane by a spark or electric
arc. The methane was liberated
in No. 5 Entry and probably No.
4 Entry of 3 Panel and accumu-
lated because of a prolonged in-
terruption of the face ventila-

‘ tion-. The ventilation was inter-

rupted by one or more of the
following: A ventilation door at
the entrance to 3 Panel left
open, a man door open in a
stopping between the supply
road and belt out by 3 Panel,
one or more temporary stop-
pings removed for haulage pur-
poses, and backup curtains,
check curtains, and/or line cur-

tains tied up for movement of 0

mobile equipmen .”

The experts also pointed out
that “the greater part of the
permissible-type electrical face
equipment in the mine was not
maintained in permissible con-
dition.” This was true of the
loading machine which was the‘
ignition source. The Bureau’s re-
port said it is believed that arc-
ing at the exposed commutator
brushes of the main motor of
this machine was the source of
the spark that killed the 22 men.

The key words in the last para-
graph above are that ‘‘equip-

ment in the mine ..-was not main-..

tlined in permissible condition.”_
This means that Bureau of

Mines maintainance, ‘standards ~
‘ for this equipment had not been

observed.

- Metal and other non-coal min-
ers are lucky not to face the
ever-present danger of methane
gas as in the underground coal
mines. But sloppy maintenance,
use of unsafe equipment and
cutting corners on safety in
other ‘ways are just as ‘prevalent
in your industry as _in coal—and
they take their.toll in lives and
disabling injuries in both indus-

, tries. Every hard rock miner

knows this and doesn’t need to.
be told. Anyone who does need
to know. only has to read. the

‘summaries of Bureau of Mines

health and safety reports on
mines _ under contract with this
union. Every issue of the Mine-
Mill Union for the past year, has

covered these reports. It adds,

up to quite a record.
