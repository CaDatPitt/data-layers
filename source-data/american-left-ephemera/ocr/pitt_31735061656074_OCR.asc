 

IHE KILLING (IF WILLIAM MILIIIN .

— ' by ART SHIELDS

  

The sergeant seemed to be about to say something good
about the Miltons as he repeated this statement again. He
checked himself however.

The sergeant said he was sorry the thing happened. It was
too bad the Miltons ran, he told me, as he tried to ﬁnd some
excuse for Kilcommons. »

But the sergeant couldn't ﬁsh up a single fact to justify the
murder, although he tried to build up the killer as a “nice
man.” ” -

“You may not agree with, me,”

‘he was a nice man, a quiet man, a calm man.”

The Nazi sergeants thought their killers were nice, too.

Cops Knew Milfon

As I said, the cops knew William Milton well. And I
suspect that Peter Kilcommons knew at whom he was shooting
as he planted his steel-jacketed bullet in Milton's back.

Why did he do it? The Negro people on S. First Street say
that race hatred was pressing the trigger. They say that Kil-
commons was raving in the hallway after the murder that he
would “cleanup” the street, where the Negro people lived," if
anyone tried to make trouble for him for what happened that
night. '

He said this after the women in the building had told
O’Neil, the other cop, and himself that they were going to try
to get them thrown off the force and punished for the killing.

Some cops not only dislike Negroes. They have a beastly
hatred for Negroes, who defend the rights of their people,
and William Milton was one of that kind.

William Milton was a Communist, who came into the Com-
munist movement during the struggle to punish another police
killer. And his door’ was always open to help every one of his

V people. _
His wife, Irene, told me about him as we sat with her son ‘

 

in their little apartment on the top ﬂoor of the house where
he was murdered that night.
10

 

the sergeant told us, “but V

  

William would be proud of Irene, as she ﬁghts for her
people today.

“I can't bring William back . . . I know that,” she.said, as
she sat, with her son on the arm of her chair.

“I can’t bring William back, but I can ﬁght, as he wanted
me to. I can ﬁght to keep Georgia from coming up to New
York.” _

The young widow is repeating that pledge at every meeting
of the Committee for Justice in the Milton Case.

“William was always talking about keeping Georgia from
coming to New York,” she went on. “He knew how our'people

. are treated down there. He lived in Georgia until he was 19.

I ‘met him in Miami. He had come there to get away from life
on the Georgia plantation. William worked in a Cat and Dog
Hospital in Miami for awhile. But he was a natural mechanic.
He worked on automobiles whenever he had a chance and
became. one of the best mechanics in town. Everyone said that.
He came to New York to get a better chance.”

William was happy at ﬁrst. He got a job in a garage near
his home in Williamsburg. Then: he saw Georgia come up to
New York.

A cop named Romeika had killed two Negro brothers in
Freeport, L. I., in Ku Klux killer fashion. That was in Feb-
ruary, 1946. Romeika lined two brothers named Ferguson
up against a wall and shot them when they protested against
being put out of a Jim’ Crow restaurant. One of the men was
a war veteran. '

“William got into the ﬁght to get the killer punished,” Mrs.
Milton told me. “He was very angry about the murder and
gave a lot of time to help the Committee for Justice in the
Freeport Case.”

Milton joined -the Communist Party in the course of the
Freeport struggle, forthe Communist Party was leading the
ﬁght. He was an active Communist ever since.

The young Georgia Negro distributed scores of leaﬂets ask-
ing Gov. Dewey to prosecute the killer. Dewey didn’t respond.

11

 

 

 

  

Romeika, like Kilcommons, still totes a big gun. But Milton
was successful in alerting his people.

Milton was also "bringing The Worker’s stories of the battle
against police brutality in Harlem and Brooklyn, to his neigh-
bors at the same time.

Then came the rent strike at No. 262 S. First, Street, two
doors down the block, which lasted three months.

“This house is old. It's older than anyone who‘ lives in it
now,” said one of the residents to this writer. “And the land-
lord wouldn’t ﬁx a single thing until the Tenants and Con-
sumers Council of Williamsburg got us together.”

William Milton had a lot to do in getting the tenants
together. A '

Rent payments to the landlord stopped ‘after a meeting.
The money was paid into a special Tenants’ council fund,
and withheld from the landlord until he surrendered.

“We’d never have won that rent strike if it hadn't been
for men like William Milton,” said the former secretary of the
Tenants’ council, Leon Mandel, who is se-cretary of the Ameri-
can Labor Party in Milton’s old district today.

“Milton never failed us,” said Mandel. “He could always be
counted on to bring the tenants to the meetings in ALP
headquarters at 402 Keap Street.

“He had the respect of everyone on the block. We’ll go the
limit to get the killer punished.”

William Milton had the respect also of David Fitzgerald,
the well—to-do elderly Irishman who owns the big Fitzgerald
Service Station at 5714 Northern Boulevard, Queens, where
the young Negro worked.

Fitzgerald told me that Milton was a sort of independent
contractor, who rented space on the lot to repair the cars of
the station's patrons.

“He was a good, sober man, who never missed a day. . . .
He was an excellent mechanic, whose work I could trust,” said
Fitzgerald._ “I’m very, very sorry this thing happened.”

I investigated the killing at the request of the Daily Work-
12 ’

 

  

er’s city editor, Joe Clark. No other paper was interested in
the facts. The Brooklyn Eagle had run a fake story about the
shooting of a “bandit.” Even the police don't call Milton that.
The Daily News and the Journal-American had other inven-
tions. Other papers kept mum.

I was picked up in New York by Milton's branch organizer,
Phil Schleimer, who had been talking to witnesses already.
His wife, Marian, meanwhile, had started a drive for relief
for the victim’s widow. She was bringing a wad of 100 separate
dollar bills, with some silverbesides, into Mrs. Milton's apart-
ment, when we got there. She had raised the money, bill by
bill, from the Negro and Spanish American people on th
block. ‘

Mrs. Milton has been left destitute when the family’s bread-
winner was killed. “I took the last $121 out of his bank, and
got six dollars more in his bloody wallet from the city property
clerk,” she told me.

She borrowed more for funeral expenses.

The Committee for Justice in the Milton Case was formed
by- representatives of the Civil Rights Congress, the ALP,‘ the
Wallace-for-President movement, trade unions, churches and
the Communist Party.

It has the active backing of City Councilman Ben Davis,

‘ who has been leading the ﬁght against police brutality in this

city since Commissioner Wallander’s order to “muss them up”
—which has been used primarily against the Negro people.“

Its chairman is Dr. Joseph Kessler, who is also chairman of
the local Wallace-for-President Committee, and is an ALP
candidate for the State Assembly as well. i

The Committee's main drives are four-fold:

1. For the dismissal and indictment and trial of Patrolmen
Peter Kilcommons and John O’Neil, who ﬁred the shots that
fatal night; ~

2. Dismissal of Police Commissioner Wallander, whose pol-
icy of mussing-up Negroes, led to the murder;

13

 

i
I
s

 

   

3. Financial indemnities for the widow and orphaned son
from the Board of Estimate of-the City of New York.

Suoh indemnities have been paid towvictims of city employes
in the past, says Simon W. Gerson, one of the leaders in the

case. Gerson, the ALP and Communist Party designee for the

seat in the Council, left vacant by the death of Peter V.
Cacchione, was formerly assistant to the Borough President of
Manhattan. He was the spokesman for a Justice-for-Milton
delegation to Mayor O’Dwyer’s offices recently.

The fourth drive is for the defense of Joseph Milton and
William Hughes, the other witness, who was arrested nine days
after the murder.

‘The police are pressing the frame-up. Hughes has already
been held for the Grand Jury, although the bartender ad-
mitted at the hearing that no blows were struck until he
grabbed his bludgeon. Joseph Mi1ton’s case haslbeen con-
tinued until October 7.

The men are being ably defended by Reuben Turetsky,
Emanuel Bloch and Ralph Powe, who has charge of the in-
vestigation. All are attorneys for the Civil Rights Congress
of 205 East 42nd Street.

But the people, who are now holding demonstrations in the
case in Brooklyn and New York will p-lay the biggest part in
winning the ﬁght.

The ﬁght isn’t easy. Cops arrested Mrs. Schleimer and two
seamen on charges of “felonious assault” when they broke up
a meeting of the Committee for Justice in the Milton Case
in front of the National Maritime Union hall on West 17th
St., New York. The seamen, William MoCarthy, who had
addressed the meeting, and Albie Salz, hadn’t struck any cops.
They were framed like William Hughes and Joseph Milton.

Councilman Ben Davis led a demonstration of 2,000 men
on the same spot several days later. The ﬁght for justice goes
on. The Negro people and progressive white workers unitedly
will win this ﬁght. . '

soon after the killing, knows the ways of police. He covered
police news for many papers before coming to the Daily
Worker. Shields, a veteran of World War I, served with the
Daily Worléer in Chicago, the year it was founded in 1924,
‘and came back -to the paper in New_York in 1936. He went
to Spain for the “Daily” in February, 1939, and was the only
American correspondent in Madrid when the fifth column of
Trotskyites, right wing Socialists and anarchists betrayed the
city to Franco. One of his murder investigations for the
“Daily” was conducted in Monroe County, Ga., in 1946, when
he traced the connection between the late Gov. Talmadge and
the lynching of two Negro sharecroppers and their wives.
In November, that year, Shields penetrated a secret meeting of
the du Ponts and other big capitalists with Merwin K. Hart,
Joseph Kamp, the professional anti—Semite, and other fascists
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He recently startled Daily
Worker readers with the news that the foreman of the silk

INTRODUCTION

This is the story of the life and death of a man, mostly about
his death. This man—who might just as well have been you
or I—was a useful, hard-working, law-abiding citizen named
William Milton. -

William Milton, age 31, was a devoted husband and loving
father. He was friendly. He was sympathetic to his neighbors’
problems. He was what people call a good man.

Yes, he was all that. But he was something else, too. He was
a Negro and so marked out for that special torture that Ameri-
can society visits upon men and women who are colored.

He was among the 14,000,000 American Negroes who are the
last to be hired and the ﬁrst to be ﬁred, who are forced to
live in Jim-Crow ghettoes at robber rents; who are barred from
restaurants, hotels, barber ‘shops and scores of other places
which whites visit as amatter of course. Yes, William Milton
was one of those Americans who drank the bitter dregs of
Jim Crowism every day.

Yes, William Milton lived under Jim Crow right here in
New York. In fact, he died from Jim Crow‘. He was lynched,
my friends, lynched. What matter is it if a man is lynched
by a hempen rope from a Georgia -cottonwood tree or lynched
by a police revolver in the trigger-happy hands of a Brooklyn
cop? It's lynching by any name and all progressive people,
Negro and white, know it for that. That is why we stand up
and ﬁght not only for justice for William Milton and his
family but to wipe out the Jim Crowism, the discrimination,
the segregation of the Negro people which is at the bottom
of the Miltonokilling.

3

 

 

  

In his life William Milton fought that ﬁght, too. He fought
Jim Crow, high prices and robber rents together with Negroes
and progressive white workers. He joined the party pledged
to wipe out poverty, war and race discrimination—the Com-
munist Party. g i

We who want to give William Milton's life and death true
meaning and true dignity must dedicate ourselves to the ﬁght
for justice in the Milton case. We must join with Councilman
Benjamin J. Davis in the ﬁght against police brutality, of
which the Milton case is the most recent shocking instance.
We must ﬁght to destroy the Jim Crow system.

In doing’ so we defend not only the ‘memory of William
Milton but the very rights of all of us, Negro and white.

SIMON W. GERSON.

 

 

THE KILLING OF WILLIAM MILTON

By ART SHIELDS

. .
On a Ho’r Summer Nighf

It was 10:20 on a hot, mid-summer night in the Williams-
burg section of Brooklyn. William Milton, his brother Joseph
and their wives were together. All were about to turn in.

.William had to be up soon after daylight to get to the service
station at 5714 Northern Boulevard, Queens, where he worked
as an auto mechanic. But ]oseph’s wife was out of cigarettes.
“Will you get some, Joe?” she inquired. William went out
with his brother. .

William was ﬁlled full of lead several minutes later.

As William left the narrow hallway of the tenement house
at 258 S. First Street he waved to his 13-year-old son Eugene.
The lad, a student at Junior High School No. 50, with a
passion for music, was standing across the street. The pave-
ment was full of Negro and Spanish-American people. The
air was stiﬂing indoors. William and Joe got their cigarettes.
Then some one suggested a goodnight glass of beer. They
stopped for it—unfortunately——at a ‘bar where the Negro peo-
ple aren’t welcome. But the law says that customers must be
served, regardless of color or race. And the Valen’s bar on
Grand Street near Havemeyer was hardly a hundred yards
from the house. So they took a chance—a chance that cost
William his life.

In the bar they met a neighbor, William Hughes, and a
fourth Negro acquaintance. They ordered a round together.

The men were- sober. The cops and the ambulance surgeon,
who examined William later, don't dispute that. But bar-
tender Charles Kenneﬁck didn't want Negroes around. And he
looked on impatiently as the four men sipped at their beer.

5

  

“We each had a beer,” said one of the men to me later.
“Then the bartender growled: ‘Drink up and get the hell out,’
when two of us got another drink.”

The men resented the snarling tone. One word led to an-
other. The bartender came out with his ice churner, a heavy
bludgeon, as he has since admitted in Brooklyn Felony Court.
And a scuffle began.

Two radio cops came. The men took to ﬂight. They knew
that their skulls might be clubbed if they didn’t.

The ‘men raced ’round the corner of Havemeyer Street,
with the cops ﬁring in mad pursuit.

“I saw the whole thing,” said bright—eyed little Leroy Good-'

win, who lives in the same house with the two Milton families.

“It was a very hot night,” the 11-year-old Negro boy con-
tinued: “I couldn’t sleep. My mother had let me go to the
corner of Grand and Havemeyer Streets for a popsicle before
the shooting began; I saw the tall policeman—that’s Peter Kil-
commons—chasing Mr..Milton and his brother. He was shoot-
ing as he ran. John O’Neil, the other cop, was running and
shooting too. But the bullets didn’t hit Mr. Willie at first.
They didn’t get him until he turned into S. First Street and
‘reached his front stoop. The ﬁrst bullet hit him in the back,
just under his right arm pit, as he was turning the knob of
his door. Mr. Milton fell to his right knee. Then he got up
and fell into the house. The cops kept on shooting through
the door.”

''I Saw Daddy Drop"

. As Leroy was showing me the smashed glass door, which the
death bullets had wrecked, other witnesses took up the story.
“I saw Daddy drop as the ﬁrst bullet hit him,” said William
Milton’s son Eugene, who had been standing with some friends
less than ten yards away.
“I saw Daddy drop,” he went on, “and then stagger inside.
Kilcommons and O’Neil were shooting at him as he went in.”
Robert Lee Foust, a young neighbor, spoke up:
6

 

“I saw the murder too. And I tell you that we have to ﬁght
to stop these killings of our people.

“I was sitting on the stoop of my house at 262 S. First Street
—that’s the house where a rent strike was won last year with
William Milton's help——when William came running down
the street. The cops were shooting behind him.

“I saw Mr. Milton fall again at the door as the ﬁrst shot hit

him in the ba-ck. And I saw the cops shooting through the

door as he was trying to save his life inside.”

There are other eye witnesses. But these are enough to put
Kilcommons and O(Neil on trial for their lives.

The cops afterwards pleaded that they were only shooting
in the air as they ran down Havemeyer Street.

But whydid they shoot to kill when Milton reached his own
home? Why did they pick that place of all others?

The shot that struck Milton under the right arm pit as he
turned his door knob didn’t kill him, however. The murder
was completed in the victim’s own hallway, as he turned at
right angles up the stairway, 25 feet from the front door.

Willie Milton was crawling up the stairway when two fatal
shots drilled into his chest.

Those bullets caused his death, said the King’s County
Medical Examiner's official report.

Willie wasn't “resisting arrest,” as the cops’ report has it,
when he was crawling up the stairway of his home.

He was just desperately trying to save his life from the .

bullets tearing through the door.

Kilcommons, who is listed on the blotter of the Bedford
Avenue station as the killer, was shooting like mad. Witnesses
say O'Neil was shooting too. I noted one bullet dent in the
marble paneling under the mail boxes. Another dent in the
marble across the hallway was called to my attention by a
keen little Spanish American boy. Leroy showed me a deep
bullet gouge in the plaster wall ten feet inside. A fourth
bullet had buried itself at a man’s height off the ﬂoor in the
jamb of the door of Mrs. Pahulik, the superintendent, far in

7

   

i:

t

the rear. And a ﬁfth slug had ‘bitten into the side of the stair-
way as William Milton was crawling several steps up.

The others struck home in the murdered man’s chest.

It was as brutal a homicide as if the cops had been working
for Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi Gestapo leader, instead of for
Police Commissioner Arthur Wallander of New York.
William Milton never had a chance.

The cops even refused to let their victim clasp the hand of

his wife before he died.

“The police pushed me away when I ran to him on the
lowest stair landing,” his widow told me.,

“Willie was calling my name—‘Irene! Irene!’ He was all
covered with blood. I fought to getto him, but the police kept
pushing me away. Willie kept calling ‘Irene!’ when the ambu-
lance took him away. They threw him on the stretcher like a
dog, with his arm hanging down at his side.”

William Milton died in Greenpoint Hospital at 5:45 a.m.
the next morning, more than seven hours later, without seeing
his wife or son again. . 4 J

He was buried near his mother’s home in the vicinity of
Bainbridge, Ga., where he worked with his father, a share-
cropper, on a cotton plantation as a child.

Third Degree

While the surgeons were probing for the bullets in William’s
back and chest in Greenpoint Hospital a different kind of
operation was being performed on his brother, Joseph.

Joseph had been arrested by the killer, Kilcommons, after I

he denounced the cops for murdering his brother. He was
charged with “felonious assault.” A similar charge was lodged
against William as he lay dying. The scuﬂle with the Jim Crow
bartender furnished the excuse. A "
“The detectives beat me with rubber hoses,” Joe said. “They
beat me across the face with _two—foot lengths of rubber hose.”
The cops were trying to"make him confess that William
and -himself had started the ﬁght. The cops thought that
8

 

  

such a “confession? would give them an “out” for the killing.

“They beat me and questioned me all night,” Joe continued.
“I thought my jaw was broken. They beat me and said:
‘You’re lying.’ I said: ‘I’m telling the truth.’ They said: ‘What
you say will be the truth when we’re through with you.’_’

But Joseph Milton kept telling the truth. And the cops had
to let him get bail a couple days later. He got out in time to
attend his brother's funeral in the South. He reported the
third degree orgy to Mrs. Marian Schleimer, the secretary of
the Committee for Justice in the Milton Case, when he got
back. ' ‘ '

And he told it to his people «again several nights later, when

he saw one of the rubber-hose wielders storm into the South
Third Street Methodist Church in Williamsburg, where Joseph
was attending a conference of the Committee for Justice in
the Milton Case.

The detective, a bald-headed, middle-aged man named Ban-
dorf, tried to take over the meeting and question everyone

inside. The cop was put out.

Meanwhile Mrs. Schleimer and I had been checking up on
the police records of the murder.

The police admitted that William Milton was entirely un-
armed, when he was shot in the back. He hadn't even a
penknife on him when the cops went through his blood-soaked
shirt and pants.

Not one of the men, who ﬂed from’ the Valen’s place, had
a weapon of any kind on him. The police records show that.

William Milton wasn't a stranger to the cops. Many police-
men in the precinct knew the polite young Negro, who used
to work in a garage in the neighborhood, before, he got the job
in Queens. William had never had any trouble with the cops
since he came to Williamsburg from the deep South three
years ago. _

The desk sergeant at the Bedford Avenue station told me
he knew William too. “I knew him and his brother,” he said,
when Mrs. Schleimer and I met him. '
