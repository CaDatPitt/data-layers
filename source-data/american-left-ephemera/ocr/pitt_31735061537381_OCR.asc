which benefits from most of these decisions.

Several years ago one of Hague’s Vice-Chancellors,
John Egan, had a fit of conscience after issuing a drastic
injunction against the United Shoe and Leather Workers’
Unionf“ “I shall never issue an injunction in a labor dis-
pute without due notice to the other side (meaning labor———
Ed.) and hearingboth sides.”EitherEgan has a short memory
or Hague put on the heat, for recently he issued an injunc-
tion p_rohibiting any union activity whatever by the striking
employees of the Silver Rod Drug chain in Jersey. City.
Egan is carrying on the tradition of Vice-Chancellor Fallon,
who was forced to resign after a prolonged investigation of
his grafting habits. Fallon was closely associated ‘with
John Milton, Hague’s ﬁnancial advisor in shady transac-
tions, and who has been promoted to the U. S. Senate,

 

Labor is taking no chances with the New Jerseyicourts.‘

VVhen Maja L. Berry, Republican Vice Chancellor in'Essex
County, granted an injunction which declared the closed shop
illegal, many AFL and CIO unions got together and formed
Labor’s Anti-Injunction League under the leadership of
Harry Wendrich, A. F. L. Printing Pressman. The League’s
activity has resulted in the passage by the Jersey Assembly
of the Pierson Anti-Injunction Bill. Hague opposed the
bill and his loyal defender, Louis P. Marciante, President
of the New jersey Federation of Labor was placed between
two ﬁres: his love for Hague and the pressure of the rank
and ﬁle. That he didn’t yell too loudly for the bill can be
taken for granted when we consider that this misleader of
labor tried hard, but unsuccessfully, to break the Anti-In-
junction League.

Marciante calls Hague “the friend of labor.” And this _

great “friend of labor” breaks unions through injunctions
and the receivership racket. He orders Bernard Johnson,
Jersey City Bus Supervisor,’ to break the strike of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainrnen by threatening to revoke
the licenses of bus drivers. He terrorizes hall owners to
prevent the CIO from holding meetings. His police beat

and jail seamen striking for better conditions in the port

of Hoboken. He sees that Sam Rosoff and others respon-
sible for the murder of labororganizer Norman Redwood

IO

 

are not brought before the bar of justice. And whe Mar-
ciante and the CLU of Hudson County shout that ague is
“the friend of labor” it is really the voice of the The
Chamber of Commerce, of gangland, of the fascist forces
that would bring bloodshed and violence to New Jersey and

America rather than obey the will of the people for decent‘

living conditions, democratic rights and peace.

“THE COURTS OF NEW JERSEY WERE NEVER
IN GREATER DISREPUTE THAN NO ‘.”— Admission

’ of Luther H. Campbell, Chancellor of the Chancery Courts,

before the Essex County Bar Association.

He looked through the bars of the jail. He ached in
every muscle from the beating he had received. He needed
medical attention but got only bad smelling food that made
him sick in the stomach. He wondered Why he was here.
He was a good American, a patriot who Wanted to help get
better conditions for the people. The trial was a farce.
They sentence you fast in Jersey City, so fast that you
hardly know what hit you———and just because he picketed to
get a decent wage. He thought of his wife and clutched
ﬁercely at the bars. What would she do now. Would she
cry that her husband wasa good citizen and couldn’t be
treated like that? He shrugged his shoulders and sank de-
jectedly to the floor.

Hague’s courts are not only directed against the worker
but they smash the democratic rights of all the people. They
faithfully protect the “sacred rights” of the Chamber of
Commerce and Liberty League. They do everything pos-
sible to cover up the crimes of their master, as exempliﬁed
when Thomas H. Brogan, a former Hague attorney and
new Chief justice of the Court of Errors and Appeals, cyn-
ically denied the Clee Republican forces the chance to order
a court investigation of Hudson County election frauds.

But a determined public opinion can force the courts
to yield. ‘Not so long ago The Communist Party tried to
hold meetinos. in Jersey City only to be swooped down upon

by Chief of Police Walsh and his cohorts. But at the re-

quest of liberty—loving groups throughout the city, Vice-~
Chancellor Fielder, one of the few independents in the
Chancery Courts, gmnted an injunction which restrained

the police from interfering with meetings of the Communist
Party. rCivil rights wereupheld and a precedent was set
for such progressive groups as the Hudson C0unty.Comn_1.it.-
tee for Labor Defense and Civil Rights, the American Civil

Liberties Union, and the International Labor Defense. ~Bui~

the fight is only in its initial stages. Progressives must con-
duct an organized struggle for a fundamental revision of
the antiquated court system of New Jersey. The power oi’
the Chancellor to appoint the ten Vice-Chancellors. must be
abolished. These‘ reforms will be carried through by a broad
state Labor Party which will be formed through the efforts
of Labor’s Non-Partisan League.

Hague and Hit|er——Go|d Dust Twins

, The small tailor shop was his only source of income.
He was very bitter. Ever since the sit-down strike of big
business things were bad. Not that they were good before.
But now! He shuddered. He was the typical Jersey City

shopkeeper. All his life he had invested the small savings v_

of his shop in his joy and pride, the home that stretched
over his shop. But now, with business worse than ever, he

had“ to meet an enormous tax bill. He couldn’t understand“

it. In 1918, the ﬁrst year that Hague was in oﬂice, the bill

was only $126.29. In 1937 he haclto pay $726.67!
Thousands of small business men throughout Hudson

County are in the same predicament. During the twenty

years that Hague has been in office, the tax ratehas tripled.‘
The burden is terriﬁc. But more than that, the assessed’

valuation of properties has beenidoubled to make the tax
rate appear smaller. All sorts of leagues, to reduce taxes,
were organized by an enraged public but to no avail.
Hague had to have more money to run his expensive ma-
chine. , ’ ' '

In numerous cases real estate taxes run to more than
50¢ of the gross income, whereas ‘real estate experts declare
that such taxes should not eXceed"2o to 25 percent of in-
come. In Jersey City assessments often run-_ from 125 to
200 percent of present values. ' ' ' ' ‘ '

The result was inevitable. In one year alonemorc
than i2,ooo Jersey City property owners lost their homes.
And this will be the situation evervwliere if Hague" is not

resisted in his march on Trenton_. and Washi_ngt0n._ That

is’ why home owners, small business men and professionals
must unite forces with other anti—.Hague _gro_ups, the grow-
-ing Labor Party movement, progressive -Democrats and Re
' ublicans, and the Communist Party, to demand that taxes
be levied against those ‘best able to pay.

Moreover, it is possible to reduce taxes by ending the
career of the Hague machine which keeps a gang of ward
heelers in ofﬁce at the expense of the "people, especially the
rank and ﬁle of public employees who are forced to con-

tribute 3 percent of their salaries’ to Hague’s slush fund.

How much graft goes to Hague’s relatives and machine
workers the public’ can never know because the budget is
very vague. But conservatives, like James A. Murray, es-
timate that Hague controlls 8,000 jobs with an annual pay
roll of nearly $2 5,000,000!

To professional people and small business men Hague
claims that he is their saviour from “the scourge of com-
munism.” Hitler, too, pretended to save these elements
from the “red menace.” And from Germany we hear that
taxes are likewise rising, that 37,000 businessmen failed in
one month alone, and the thousands who oppose AHitler’s
ruthless oppression are driven to’ despair and suicide, or

-"are condemned to years of torture inthe concentration

camps. Hague, like Hitler, is looking for broader ﬁelds to
conquer and threatens to extend his reign throughout the
nation." Like Hitler, too, he spends less. and less money
for needed social services. Hague grows rich while taxes
mount, homes are foreclosed and slums become'cr'0wd_ed.
Salaries of school teachers are cut, and children are herded
into small, stuffy rooms because no. money canbe found
for education. A recent survey showed that 11,000 child-
ren in Jersey City, approximatelyl27°/0 of the school popu-
lation, were receiving only part-time schooling! Only three
new schools have been built in the last ﬁfteen years.

"My Husband is a Good ~Mon"———Mrs. Joseph Scutellaro.

The recent stabbing of Harry Barck, Hoboken Over-
seer of the Poor, by Joseph Scutellaro driven to desperation
by the ‘cries of hungry children at home, throws a grim light
on the relief situation under Hague. Mayor McFeely of

Hoboken is a Hague man and was merely carrying out the
“starve and like it” policy of Hague. The tremendous out-
cry of an enraged citizenry coming to the defense of Scutell--
are is a recognition of the stark misery that prevails among
Hudson County’s unemployed. And in Trenton Governor
Harry (Charlie McCarthy) Moore carries out the same
polic . He advocates that cities spend their own funds on
relie , knowing that, in practice, this means starvation for
the unemployed. Of course, he advocates a bond issue to
reimburse the cities—at some future date. And in the mean-
time, hundreds of Barcks continue to deny the unemployed
the means to keep body and soul together. Opposed to this
starvation policy, the Communist Party urges adequate re-
lief, provided and administered by the state, and expansion
of the WPA so as to include work for every able bodied
unemployed man and Woman. It helps the Workers Alli-
ance, the trade unions and other progressive groups to wage
a united struggle for these demands. Moreover, we advo-
rcate adequate social security legislation which would make
possible immediate protection of all workers, neglecting no
single group in need of aid.

The Fire Engine: Come———But It Was Too Late

The crowd was horrified. The young girl swayed on
the window ledge and then fell back into the flames!
ﬁre-engines took twenty minutes to travel the short distance
to the Plaza Hotel. Fires are frequent in Jersey City and
the many tragic deaths which occur can not be attributed
only to slow and ineﬂicient ﬁre apparatus. The cause goes
deeper. The ﬁres usually occur in the slum sections. Homes
are rickety, wooden and unsafe. If disease doesn’t get the
occupants, a ﬁre may. But Hague is too busy vacationing
in Florida to worry about that. Not a single genuine effort
has been made to clear the slums and provide decent hous-
ring for the people of Jersey City. This is equally true of
Newark, Trenton, Elizabeth, Paterson and other cities. And
why? Because a few private contractors monopolize the
building industry and will not allow the government to com»
pete with them. Moore talks of asking the Federal Gov-
‘ernment for a housing grant, but he is whistling in the dark,
hoping that the people won’t catch on. But the Communist

.14

The ‘

  

 

Party and other progressive forces demand slum clearance‘
and decent housing. We advocate that the State Housing‘
Authority begin at once to build homes for families with
small incomes. We demand that small home-owners
be given loans as a defense against foreclosures. Against
ﬁre-traps, against disease breeding slums, for decent homes——
that’s the program of the Communists. - '

The Press, The Press, The Freedom of the Press!

Years ago The fersey fourﬁl pretended to be for" the _

eople and attempted to carry on an anti-Hague campaign.
gut not for long. Hague’s clergymen began denouncing
the Journal from the pulpit. He had city employees dis-
tribute leaflets throughout the city calling it a “vicious news-
paper-.” City, employees were discharged if they were caught
reading it. An attempt was made to “frame” the owner
for defraudingthe city.. Policemen and ﬁremen were sent
canvassing from door to door to getsubscriptions for a rival
newspaper. He sought to have members of the business
men’s association withdraw their advertizing in a body. One»
theatre which continued to advertize was suddenly discovered
to be violating the building and ﬁre regulations. He even
ordered the city council to change the name of Journal
Square to Veterans Square! Needless to say, The fersey
fournal soon became a staunch Hague supporter and has
remained so to this day. Incidentally, the owner, Walter
Dear, was reappointed as lay judge in the Court of Errors
and Appeals, at a handsome salary. And so the kept press
of Hudson County covers up the real story—the alliance

of Hague, big business and the underworld against the '

people—and attempts are made to keep from the people
The Daily W orker and other newspapers that tell the truth
about Mayor Hague.

Jersey City——Where Crime is Legal
“jersey City is the most cleanest city, my friends, not
a gangster, my friends, not "a holdup, my friends, in ]ersey*
City since I have been mayor... Never.’ My friends, fersey
City, ‘my friends, is the most moralest city in this ‘country,
my frzends.”’—Mayor Hague, (Daily Worker, April 18,1937).
Of course as far as the records go! At least the G-men.
couldn’t swallow the fake reports and had to drop Jersey

I:

  

City from the “Uniform Crime Reports” issued by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation of the Dept. of Justice. Could
Hague tell the citizens of Jersey City how federal agents

rilled'Hudson County officials after their private conference
with Frenchie Dillon, Waxey Gordon’s lieutenant? He
certainly had to keep the muzzle on that angle. And he
certainly had to hush up the 300 attacks on minors in one
year, and the fact that Jersey City and Hoboken have be-
come the headquarters of the horse-racing racket in the East.
Nor could he explain to ﬁcent citizens how it happens that
the numbers racket is op ‘rated with the full connivance of
City Hall. ‘

i There is a fascist-like law in Jersey City which permits
the iolice to arrest any person suspected of being a “dis-
orderly” character. But so far this law has been used only
against labor organizers and people interested in civil liber-
ties, while known criminals roam the“streets at will.

The CIO Drive——A Turning Point .

Before daylight on Nov. 29, 1937, a group of organizers

and determined workers began the CIO organizing campaign
in Jersey City. They walked orderly to the Harborsidc
Warehouse. The place swarmed with bluecoats. No sooner
had the first leaflet been handed out than the cops went into
action. Clubs were wielded threateningly. Some of the
organizers were rushed to jail. - Others were kidnaped and
driven across city lines. Still others were pressed back into
the Hudson Tubes and warned to disappear from the city.

Hague’s judge sentenced the arrested organizers to jail
and immediately the kept press yelled,Hague Beat: the CIO.
But it was only the first skirmish. Jersey City workers
wanted the CIO and they joined by the hundreds. An
lmportant strike was won in Crucible Steel. The entire
country was aroused by the denial of democratic rights in
Jersey City. The Hudson County Committee for Labor
Defense and Civil Rights held an enthusiastic overﬂow
meeting at which Congressmen John Bernard and Jerry
O’Connell denounced Hagueism. . -

Hague grew desperate. Once again he raised the time-
worn red scare, forgetting that it hasn’t worked in recent

months when tried against President Roosevelt, Mayor"

LaGuardia and others. He tried to pit Catholic against
Protestant and Jew, even saying that the CIO was the

‘ enemy of religion and the home. But Catholicsrefused to

be stampeded by cries of “Red.” They remembered the
brave words of Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago:

“Don’t let others use the danger of Communism as a
cloak to cover corrupt practices. When they cry _against
Communism, they themselves practice socialinjustice.”

How well this’ applied to Hagueism, which is the name

"for reaction in New Jersey. Hague’s henchmen, in alliance

with reactionary Republicans have temporarily defeated
all progressive legislation for the state. They killed the
a'nti—injunction bills and legislation prohibiting child labor
and curbing sweatshops. They hope to make New Jersey
a paradise for big business. But the C10 is here to stay,
to help organize the unorganized, to help bring democracy
back to Jersey; As President Roosevelt said———The ﬁg/2::
has just begun. ‘ ,

Build Labor’: Non—Partison League-

All this repression, the denial of democracy, the polit-
ical corruption, and the cynical disregard of the minimum
needs of the people gave rise to Labor’s Non-Partisan
League. This political expression of the united front of
AFL and CIO unions in aware of the growing reaction
in our state and the threat of Hagueism to the nation. That’s
why it led the opposition to the appointment of John Milton,
Hague’s financial advisor in shady transaction-s. The league,
moreover, drew the proper conclusions from the alliance of
Hagueism and reactionary Republicans. It had seen how
the Republican clerk of the Hudson County‘ Board or Elec-
tions, Charles F. Stoebling, placed every possible obstacle in
the path of the Young Committee trying to expose the
election steal in Hudson County. It had seen how Hoffman
Republicans as well as Hague Democrats took orders from
the machine. And so the call went out for a conference

on December 5, 1937 to rally all progressive forces in our

state for independent political action.

Delegates came from all parts of the state; 34 AFL
unions, IIO CIO unions and 14 branches of the Worker’s
Alliance were represented. A provisional committee for the

17

  

formation of a Labor party was elected. And, as a result of
persistent work on the part of the Executive Committee of
Labor’s Non—Partisan League, a number of county, ward and
city organizations of the League have beensent up through-
out the state. Moreover, its work on the legislative ﬁeld has
made Labor’s Non Partisan League the rallying point for
numerous independent Democrats, Republicans, and all pro-
gressives in the state of New Jersey.

This is being followed by a broad convention on May
21 and 22 which will record these gains and prepare the
way for "the mobilization of all progressive forces to defeat
Hagueism in the 1938 elections. Every trade unionist,
every farmer, every professional, every liberty-loving indi-
vidual must endeavor to make this the broadest People’s
Front movement’ on the political field this state has ever
.seen.

HELP DEFEAT HAGUEISM.’

BUILD LABOR’S NON-PARTISAN LEAGUE.’

RESTORE DEMOCRACY IN NEW,]ERSEY.’

The Communist Part-y—De.fender of Peace
and Freedom

“Communism is Twentieth Century Americanism. The
Communist Party continues the _tradition of 1776, of the
birth of our country, of the revolutionary Lincoln, who, led
"the historic struggle to preserve our nation. In the greater
crisis of today only the Communist Party shows a way to a
better life now, and to the future of peace, freedom and
:security for all.”—Earl Browder in What is Communism‘?

The soviet worker couldn’t understand it; all this talk
of unemployment, repression, the denial of freedom and
democracy. The American worker even told him frightful
:stories of the treatment of strikers, discrimination against
Negroes, and of a fellow called Hague who strutted about
like a fascist dictator and denied the people their most
-elementary rights. Of course he had read about these things.
But it was hard to picture it.

Socialism in Practice in the Soviet Union

It is like a different world, an island surrounded by
lands Where these horrors still exist.

The American worker was amazed.’ So this was So-
cialism in practice. He determined to join the Communist
Party back home. For this party is the party of Socialism,
the party that is going to lead the people to a complete

. reorganization of society which will place the Wealth of

America in the hands of the people. But right now there
is another job. Right now the 10b is to stop Fascism, to
preserve and extend democracy. That is the issue in
America today. The job is to defeat Hagueism and all it
stands for. The job is to build a People’s Movement around
the following program for the 1938 Congressional elections:

1." Unity of labor on the political and trade union
.fronts -and continued organization of the unorganized.
Against the Foran Bill, for the passage of the Anti-Injunc-
tion Bill. .

2. Complete freedom of assemblage, press and radio;
curbing of the chancery courts and passage of a suitable

- state Labor Relations Act.

3. Reduction of real estate and personal‘ property
taxes; increased taxation of large incomes, corporate proﬁts
and surpluses.

4. Adequate relief standards and extension of the
WPA. More effective social security legislation (oldage
pensions, unemployment insurance etc.)

5. No discrimination against the Negro people.

6. Slum clearance, better housing, and prevention of
foreclosures of small home owners.

7. For a free State University.

8. A higher standard of living for farmers by guar-
anteeing the cost of production for important crops.

9. The preservation of World peace by demanding a
national policy of concerted action with_ other peace-loving
nations for the quarantine of fascist aggressors.

What Is the Matter With Him?

E looked at his hands. Surely they were like thousands
of others, a little grimy, perhaps, from work in the
shoe factory. His clothes were not meant for a social tea,
and l11S shoes ﬂopped wearily against the sidewalk. Five
dollars a week was all between him and starvation. And
1118 wife . . . He hardly dared think what she would say.
“We can’t go on living this way. I’m sick of it. Why don’t
you do something about it.” She was desperate but how
could he explain. This is Hague’s town, understand, and
.he’s got it all sewed up, just like a regular dictator. Try
to organizevand his cops beat you up, his judges sentence
_you, and his kept press calls you a “red.” _It’s easy to say,
“Go out and organize, get the workers together, and demand
».decent pay”—but try and do it. Especially when you work
in -Jersey City’s Ha_rborsi_de Warehouse, the haven of run-
.away sweatshops.

The CIO came to Jersey City none too soon. For
‘the citizens of Hudson County were saying, “It has hap-
gpened here!” Ruthless dictatorship was imposed, not only
«on workers in the factories but on all liberty-loving citizens
"who felt that the Constitution of the United States was
more than a scrap of paper. Horror and terror descends
on people in all walks of life—lawyers, teachers, ministers,
‘taxpayers and small shop-keepers. And gradually this
'..te_rror spreads throughout Hudson County and the entire
.'State of New Jersey. ‘

Mail is opened, telephone wires. tapped, union meetings
«disrupted, halls closed and freedom of speech and press sup-
;pressed. Know Frank Hague and you know the typical
:fascist menace in America. A friend of the underworld, a
‘master of lies and political chicanery, Hague’s whole career
‘was a good training for his present role. Coming from the
“Horseshoe” section of Jersey City he began his criminal
«career early. At the very time ‘he was supposed to uphold
the law, as Deputy Sheriff in 1904, he swore to the fake
alibi of Red Dugan in answer to a forgery charge. Dugan

 

was out on parole after serving four years of a sentence

for the murder of a clergyman’s wife. Dugan later con-
fessed to the forgery and Hague was caught in his first
big lie. .

He then broke Judge Blair who had ﬁned him $100.
And over the political bodies of Otto VVittpen, James
Nugent, Governor George Silzer and U. S. Senator Edward
I. Edwards, he made his way to his present position by
bribery, terror, intimidation and a special desire to protect
the proﬁts of big business. With Moore, Milton and others
who played his game he began extending his control through-
out the state and nation. He gave Harry Moore a start
in 1913 when he carried Moore on his ticket as a fellow
city commissioner, and only recently he stole enough votes
for this “Charlie McCarthy” to guarantee his rule in
Trenton.

How Hague steals elections is no secret. It is some-
thing the Communist Party of New Jersey has been telling
the people ever since the Hague dictatorship made its
alliance with big business and the underworld. Even John

Ferguson, Superintendent of Elections in Jersey City and

Hudson County, has to explain:

“The only way to have an honest election ‘in Hudson
County is to call out the state militia. The way things
are under Mayor Hague, it is futile and ridiculous for us
to attempt to hold further elections in Jersey City and
Hudson County.”

Murder in Jersey City! ’

“Get Whelan!” The order went out from Hague

headquarters tothe thugs who make up the Hague gang.
James Whelan, Republican Deputy Superintendent of Elec-
tions in Jersey City, was a serious menace to the machine.
He insisted on stopping repeaters from voting, which was
his duty. He had full police powers in the polling place
at Fourth and Erie Streets, one of the toughest parts of
Jersey City.
' . James McGee, a Hague supporter with a job as county
bridge tender was working hard to roll up a large vote for
his chief. On the street his daughter Catherine was try-
ing out her new roller skates. A car containing four thugs
came to a screeching stop in front of the polling place.
The thugs armed with baseball bats rushed at Whelan.
Little Catherine was caught in between and a blow meant
for Whelan crushed her skull! .

How »Hague refused to prosecute the criminals is an

3

  

old story. How McGhee demanded justice and how he
was finally broken makes an interesting sidelight in the
annals of criminology. '

Incidents too numerous to mention testify to Hague’-s
ruthless dictatorship which deprives the people of their con-
stitutional rights. Another case is that of John Grossi,
sworn in as an election deputy in the Second District of
the First Ward, who was beaten into unconsciousness be-
cause he insisted on an honest election. ' And when the Com-
munist Party and other progressive groups protested this
terror, Hague tried to becloud the issue by calling everyone
a “Red.” ‘ He is trying the same tactic against those who
demand that the Young Investigating Committee, chosen
by the State Legislature, be given the right to come to H ud-

 

son County and" expose Hague’s Steal of the Election for ’

Governor Moore. No wonder Moore refused to aid this
committee, although he is supposed to uphold the laws of
the state. He would rather break the law than expose his
master, Frank Hague. He is afraid to let the public know:
. How rolls are padded from cradles and cemeteries.
How repeaters vote more than 50 times for Hague
candidates.
How ]ersey City has more registered voters than adults
eligible to vote. ' ‘
How an army of thugs terrify voters at the polling
places and beat up citizens who protest.

Hague’: Weak Spot
Now that the CIO has come to town in aneffort to

aid workers in Jersey City and throughout the state, Hague’s
weak spots are beginning to show. That’s why he yells

“Red” louder than ever in an effort to confuse, the issue.‘

The real reason for his opposition to the CIO is clear: he
realizes that a strong and militant labor movement, com-
bined with the progressive forces in Hudson County, will
sweep him and his corrupt gang from ofﬁce.

Hague has formed and consolidated his dictatorship
by two methods: violence and ‘bribery. He has fattened
those -willing to sell theirhonor for a mess of pottage.
There i_s the case of the mysterious H. S. Kerbaugh who in
one deal alone received from the city $326,215 for land
gcosting $60,000. Of course the people pay in‘ higher taxes

4-

 

 

and less social services. But Hague isn’t concerned with
that. He has been known to boast of his “Hamill Method”
of bribing enemies by giving them jobs on the city payroll.
-When James A. Hamill, once Hague’s bitterest critic,’ was
appointed Corporation Counsel, he somehow forgot all the
bad things he had accused the Mayor of doing. After
John  Fallon, another erstwhile enemy, had swung his
election district the right way, he was made a judge. Certain
rabbis, priests and clergymen receive jobs as city chaplains
so that they should continue to denounce the CIO and
everything progressive. And when, occasionally, a heroic
leading Catholic like Monsignor Ryan denounces Mayor
Hague, these chaplains deplore the fact that the Monsignor

_ is unacquainted with the true situation in *Hague’s town.

This extensive bribery, on a scale which makes the
Tweed Ring and Tammany seem puny, costs loads of
money. Especially after Hague takes his own cut and be-
comes a millionaire on a salary which has never exceeded
$8000 a year. So Hague triples the tax rate and places
an intolerable burden on the small business man, the doctor,
the lawyer and other citizens. People on the city payroll
are forced to kick in 3% of their salaries and he gets his
stooges among the teachers to force through a wage cut.
But all to no avail. The graft of the Hague machine has
no bottom.- The fersey City budget is four times that of

Kansas City, with equal population, even though the latter

is in the clutches of the corrupt Pendergast machine. The
figures for 1937:
I Kansas City. . . . . . . . . . . .. $ 6,450,000
Jersey City .;' . . . . . . . . . .. 27,262,870
The tax burden imposed by Hague’s corruption is'be-
coming unbearable. This is Hague’s weak spot. ‘
The people of jersey City are readyto revolt against
higher taxes.

Mayor Hague, January 12, 1938.

“Stop the reds! Safeguard the home! Save the worker
from the CIO!” Underneath these fake _crys can be heard
the real story. Hague needs big business to bolster. his
tottering machine, to oil the springs with plenty of revenue.
And big business needs Frank Hague to keep Jersey City
a haven for sweatshops. Without support from big busi-
ness, the Hague machine would collapse. Without the Hague
machine, the runaway shops could not continue to make
huge proﬁts by paying starvation wages. It is the recog-
nition of this fundamental fact that gives the Communists
insight into the real signiﬁcance of the CIO drive. To-

gether with all progressives, we welcome the CIO, not only

because it will bring better conditions to the workers of
Hudson County, but also because it will inspire other sec-
tions of the population to demand their elementary rights.
For the CIO cannot succeed in organizing the unorganized
without at the same time winning constitutional rights for
all the -people, and this means breaking up the corrupt
Hague machine. Moreover, the CIO drive in Hudson
County safeguards the wages- of Workers throughout the
state and nation. As long as big business can run to ]ersey
City and point to the low wages prevailing there as an
example, the workers in other parts of the country will
have a difficult time winning decent standards. '

When the workers of Paterson, Trenton or Camden
areconfronted by an obstinate boss who refuses to give
them decent wages, they should know that these industrial
barons are strengthened in their determination by the ruth-
less maintenance of sweatshops in Jersey City. Thousands
of workers, according to a report by Edward J. Flynn, head
of the New Jersey ‘Minimum Wage Division of the Depart-
ment of _Labor, are working for less than $5.00 a week in
Jersey City. Ask a worker who enters the armed fortress
called the Harborside Warehouse and he will tell you he
slaves from early morning to late at night for a mere
pittance. He will tell you of '-women collapsing under the
strain. He will tell you of private police who browbeat
any attempt at organization. He will tell you of stool-
pigeons by the score who spy on the workers.

Still, with the aid of the CIO and progressives within

the AFL, unionism is beginning to get a toehold in this
haven of the sweatshop. Metal and slipper shops have
been organized and workers are beginning to raise their
heads again.

Hague’: Tentacles reach Out

Of course, the whole state of New Jersey is a mecca
for the open shop. For years the Republican Governor
Harold Hoffman worked hand in hand with Hague, the
Democratic boss to preserve the .state’s reputation for being
“mild” to big business. Who does not remember how the
sales tax was shoved through the State legislature by a
combination of reactionary Republicans and Democrats?
Who does not know that the Public Service Corporation ex-
acts millions in tribute for more than 4.00 municipalities in
the state and shares its domination with the Duponts in
South Jersey, these corporations controlling both the Repub-
lican and Democratic Parties? It is not only in Jersey City
where rich corporations, such as The Commercial Trust. Com-
pany, go tax-free while the small business man, professional
man and worker is taxed to the straining point.

With Hague’s puppet, Governor Harry Moore, in
Trenton and his “fence”, John Milton, sitting in the United
States Senate, the shadow darkens over the entire state
and threatens the Whole nation.

Hague and Hitler—"Friends of Labor"

Hague, by slandering and persecuting progressive labor
and by rallying to his side certain reactionary labor leaders.
makes bid to the fascist forces of America to use him as
the spearhead in their drive against democracy. With tongue
in cheek he points to the Central Labor Union of Hudson
County. Didn’t'this body endorse his stand against the
CIO? But only a year ago this same organization, then
not a branch of the Hague machine but composed of honest
and sincere workers, passed a resolution condemning the
Mayor: “The attitude of the Police Board toward picket-
ing in Jersey City in recent weeks is not consistent with
the attitude you expressed as Mayor to a committee rep-
resenting the Central Labor Union of Hudson County”.

What had happened in the intervening year? Mayor
Hague had simply used his old trick. Just as he had packed

other organizations (Bar Association, etc.) with his stooges,
so he sent “delegates” to the Central Labor Union._ He
applied heat and the CLU ceased representing its members

and spoke for big business instead. . .

Working with labor_fakers is an oldtrick with Frank
Hague. The people of Jersey City. remember h_is deals
with Teddy Brandle, Czar of the building trades. _Brandle
grew rich from graft. The rank and ﬁle fought this mis-
leader bitterly. They couldn’t understand why Brandle

-should accept $10,000 a year from The Iron League, an

association of iron and steel manufacturers, notorious for
anti-union activities. They began to get out of hand, threat-
ening to run the union in their own interests. But Frankie
came. to Teddy’s rescue: His police swooped down on
union meetings and took care of all those who stood «for
honest trade unionism. A

Teddy never forgot. He reaped a fortune as president
of the Iron Workers’ Union and the Building Trades Coun-
cil, and when the . Federal Government caught up with
Frank Hague and ordered him to pay delinquent income
taxes, Brandle came to the rescue with $60,000 cash. Things

were just like that.

But even the best of thieves fall out! When the great
Pulaski Skyway was to be built, Hague awarded the con-
tract to two notorious open-shop construction ﬁrms which
paid less than the union scale. Brandle saw -his authority
undermined and called a strike. Hague, realizing by this

time that big business racketeers-could offer him more than .
labor racketeers, usedhis police to protect the strikebreakers-

That wasthe end of Brand-le. The strike wasplost and

he was deposed from his various positions. After that, I

Hague" took no more chances. He determined to control

unions, directly.

the receivership racket. When the International Brother-
hood of Electrical Workers refused to elect Hague stooges,
the leaders were hailed into Hague’s court.- There Charles
Hendrickson, a- Hague lawyer retained by a fewunion mem-
bers, alleged that the union’s ﬁnancial record was not in
order. Hague’s'judge, Vice Chancellor John Fallon, ap-
pointed another Hague stooge, Police Judge John]. Lenehan,
as receiver.‘ The court was horriﬁed to ﬁnd the union
treasury unbalanced to the extent of 17 cents. In the mean-
time, $5000 went to the receiver, $1500 to the lawyer draw-

ing up the petition,_and $1000 to the auditors. Everyone V
gained except the union membership which was suddenly’

left broke and without protection..

So it was with the Teamsters’ Union, the United Asso-
ciation ‘of Journeyrnen Plumber and Steamfitters’, Local
274, The Iron Workers’ Union and many others. And now

the reactionaries are trying to extend Hague’s union busting‘

formula throughout the state by means of the vicious Foran

Bill which would force all unions to be responsible to reac-A

tionary courts for the disposition of their funds. Of _course
big business is to be accountable only to itself, but labor—--
that’s different. ~ '

The Communist Party is pleased to note the united
opposition of the AFL and CIO unions to the Foran Bill. VVc

urge that the ﬁght be extended to every front, that every

progressive individual and organization interested in civil
liberties join the trade unions in the ﬁght against this fascist
measure. A '
