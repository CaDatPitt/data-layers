,At Page, Galena  

* ; COEUR AD’ALENE, Idaho-——A big push by the

,:l‘.‘U1iited Steelworkers of America to raid Mine-Mill at the
I {AS & R Galena and Page mines in the Coeur d’Alene

mining district was soundly defeated in an NLRB elec-

 tion ' held October 24.

. ‘Steel attempted last year tosplit the Galena workers
 away from the Page workers by petitioning for an elec-

 tion at the Galena only. ‘

The Board then found the unit inappropriate, and

‘This-year, Steel threw every-

;T 7‘  they had into their raid
. ' but were unable to muster
 . frank-and-file support and were
,fI=‘i:i__for_<:_ed to rely on the guile of
 their paid staff people.

, ,The..image Steel has created
among workers here by their
floundering negotiations a n d
weak settlements at the proper-

 ‘ties they now represent in this

area just could not be ex-

plained away by their profes-

sional raiding experts. _
Mine-Mill’s c a mp aign was

” carried on almost exclusively
, , by a, rank-and-file organizing

committee. In the final days

.. .;-they were assisted greatly by

 delegates to the AS & R Coun-,

 cil, which was meeting in the

area, as well as by representa-

 tives of other locals and inter-
“ ‘national officers.

- Mine-Mill won the election by

‘ 4 a vote of 230 for Mine-Mill to

114 for Steel. Not a single “no
union” vote was cast. There

3 were 381 eligible voters.

The rejection of Steel by the
workers at Galena and Page
has raised the position of Mine-
Mill immeasurably in its drive

‘to reorganize the workers at
Bunker Hill. An election is ex-

pected to be ordered atBunker=

“Hill in the near future.
Barney Rask, District 1 Board
‘Member, said that=*“The mem-
bers at the Page and Galena
mines still have a lot of faith in
Mine-Mill and their feeling is
-that we can do the job for the
-miners and smeltermen in the
nonferrous mineral industry,”
Rask also noted the beneﬁcial
‘inﬂuence of this election on the

, ’ forthcoming Bunker Hill election.

Secretary -Tr e a s ur er Irving

_ ‘ -Dichter, who was in the Coeur

 as-. Steel was unable to sign enough men to petition for
fan "overall unit of both properties, no ‘election was held.

d’Alenes for the final two-week
windup of the campaign, had
the highest praise for the staff
and rank-and-file leaders who
conducted it.

Staff members participating
in the campaign were Interna-
tional Representatives J. L.
Cochran, Joe Dunn, and Jesse
R. Van Camp.

“The Page and Galena vic-
tory,” said Dichter, “not only
strengthens our union in the
Northwest but also strengthens
the bargaining position of all
AS&R Workers throughout the
country.”

The AS&R Council, which met
in/Kellogg just prior to the elec-
tion, distributed a leaﬂet in its
own name which_called on Page
and Galena workers to maintain
a strong national union with re-
spect to the company. “We urge

_all AS&R workers in the Coeur

d’Alenes to support the only
union that can bargain with the"
company from a position of
strength. What counts in collec-
tive bargaining is what portion
of any company’s workers a
union represents. Mine-Mill
represents every important
plant of the _ AS&R, the over-

whelming majority of AS&R

workers.”

Full-page advertisements in
the local press on behalf of the
Steelworkers boasted of the size
of the Steelworkers union and
its ﬁnancial solidity. That bub-
ble was pricked by the distribu-
tion of a simple leaﬂet reprint-
mg a newspaper account of how
the Steelworkers were forced to
end a strike and accept a 241/2-
cent per hour wage cut at the
Erie Forge and Steel Co., in
their own jurisdiction.

A hard-hitting, tough, final report on the disaster at Texas Gulf Sulphur com_- ;;
pany’s potash mine near Moab, Utah August 27 was released last month by the U.S.'«  
Bureau of Mines. The disaster, claiming the lives of 18 miners, all but one of whom‘? -
were married and who left a total of 37 children under 18 years old, was caused by an ‘

J

explosion of methane and other combustible gasses.

The mine was under development by Harrison International, Inc., a Canadian.i‘::.‘{‘A:.,“
contractor. About 80 men were employed by Harrison, many of whom were Canadi-  

 

 

 

E

ans. The operation was on a three-shift, seven-day a week‘ basis. The operation was

non-union, with no contract, no
safety clauses, no l1IllOIl safety
committee.

The Bureau of Mines names no .

names, but in the cold, factual
style of a government report,
lays out the sorry record of
carelessness, callous indiffer-
ence to human safety, profit-
hungry corner cutting, a n d
negligence of elemental safety
precautions for all to read. .

The mine has had a bad
safety record since development
work started over two years
ago, as is too often the case
with work performed by con-
tractors, whose major concern
is to get the job done as quickly
as possible with as much profit
as can be made. Prior to the ex-
plosion last August, four men
were killed in accidents, three
of which the Director of the
U.S. Bureau of Mines said were
preventable._ Reports of other
non‘-fatal work injuries may or
may not be on file with the
U.S. Bureau of Mines, but in

’ any event are not publicly avail-

able.

This was a gassy mine,-where
gas was encountered during
mining operations, occasionally
with enough pressure to blow
water ‘ out of’ drill holes and on
one occasion strong enough to

eject the drill steel during drill-
ing, throwing the drilling ma-
chine and driller 20 feet up the
drift. Notwithstanding this evi-
dence of gas, blasting machines
not approved by the U.S. Bu-
reau of Mines were used, ‘blast
holes were’ fired on shift with
men underground, temporary
ventilation only was provided
and damage to temporary tubes
conducive to recirculation of air
occurred, inadequate testing for
gas was the rule, and smoking
was permitted underground. G

The mine was ripe for a dis-
aster, and a near disaster hap-
pened last July 31. A worker
underground set off an explo-
sion of gas coming from a rock
bolt hole when he tried to light
a cigarette’. He and three others
were burned—two severe1y——in

. the blast. These injuries were

not reported to the Bureau of
Mines. The blast was reported
to the state mine inspector, and
according to the federal report,
he then ordered the posting of
“no-smoking” . signs under-
ground. a

Following this accident, test-
ing for gas was stepped up by
Texas Gulf Sulphur, and addi-
tional ﬂame safety lamps were
issued although some employees

were not properly instructed as:  
to use of the lamps. The Bu-g" 
reau of Mines reports it was ' 
evident that smoking- under- s 2
ground continued after the July

31 blast. »

On August 27 the swing-"shift ' A V

(3:30 p.m. to.11:30 p.m.) en-
tered the mine and charged the

bore holes left by the day ‘shift  
in one of the drifts. The roundjp

was shot at 4:20 p.m. The blast-
ing liberated methane gas from

the face which was carried. by 

return air to a shop area near

the shaft, where it exploded 20 ‘D

minutes later.

The gas would have by-passed , G

the shop area, the report,indi-
cates, except for a fan placed so

as to draw it intothe area and  2
recirculate it. Otherwise ‘ pre-" '

sumably the gas would have
passed up the mine shaft. The

l_ explosion was caused by elec-A ,
tric sparks, open flame, ‘or; ,:—
heated metal surfaces. The "18 ‘

victims died from blast effect,

ﬂame, or’ asphyxiation. 12 were ‘

killed instantly. The force of the

explosion extended to most of

the underground workings and

up the shaft, injuring one man-‘ 5

on the surface. »

Waikout Protests

"Unsafe Conditions

MAGNA, Utah—Members of
Local 392 walked off their jobs
for about three hours Oct. 23
protesting unsafe conditions on
the roll ﬂoors of the Arthur and
Magna mills.

Large metal boxes are sus-

pended above the roll ﬂoor by

iron rods and men must work
under these boxes. Members of
the union discovered that the
boxes and rods from which they
are suspended were eroded and
rusted and in danger of falling.

The men walked off the job
at about 10 a.m. and remained
off until about 1 p.m., when the
company agreed to investigate
the situation, according to Dis-
trict 3 Board Member Verne
Curtis.

The company has agreed to

Page Miner
Wins Arbitration

"WALLACE, Idaho—Coeur d’-
Alene District Miners’ and
Smeltermen’s Union Local 18
has won an arbitration on be-
half of Brother Fritz Reinhofer
against the American Smelting
and Refining Co.

In January, Reinhofer had
successfully bid for the classi-
fication of Mucking Machine
Operator, Grade 6. When the
ore that Reinhofer had been
working ran out in April, he
was reassigned to a Grade 3
position.

Arbitrator Carl B. Luckerath
ruled that the company was in
error first in cutting Reinho-
fer’s pay after this reassign-
ment (on the grounds that it
was a temporary reassignment)
and secondly in not allowing
Reinhofer to “bump” one of the
two other Mucking Machine
Operators over whom he had
seniority.

Reinhofer was awarded back
pay from April 1 and the op-
portunity to displace a junior
employee.

International Representative
J. L. Cochran argued the case
for the union.

‘Superior Considers

incorporation

SUPERIOR, Ariz.—-Local 938
Business Manager Roy Santa
Cruz and Brother Larry Nelson
have been appointed by the
Superior Civic Council to pre-
pare a report on the possibility
of incorporating the town.

Nelson and Santa Cruz were
to present their findings at a
meeting of the Civic Council
Oct. 30, to which all citizens
were invited.

The two met Oct. 25 in Phoe-
nix with John DeB:olske, execu-
tive director of the League of
Arizona Cities and Towns, to
discuss the various facets of
incorporation.

The chief benefit to be derived
from making Superior a city,
according to Nelson and Santa
Cruz, would be a return of some
$131,000 annually from the com-
munity’s share of Arizona state
taxes, which could be used on
road construction and repair
and other civic projects. Another
possibility would be the con-
struction of municipally-owned
water facilities.

Santa Cruz stated that a great
many townspeople had called
him about the matter and that
“a great percentage are in
favor of incorporation.”

 Banner Miners’ Benefits

TUCSON, Ariz.—A ‘State Employment Security Commission ruling denying un-

employment benefits to striking members of Local 929 at Banner Mining Company

5 here will be reviewed by the Pima ‘County Superior Court.

" In a court order obtained by International Representative Sylvain Schnait-
Ltacher and a Local 929 Committee consisting of President Nicolas V. Morelos, Finan-
cial Secretary Ted Martinez, Cenobio Robles and Tony de la Ossa, Judge Richard L.

‘Roylston "set December ‘6 for a Superior Court hearing, and directed the Arizona

>Ei‘nployment Security Commis-
;_sion ‘ to hold hearings _to take
‘additional evidence which Wlll

'\

beoffered by the Union at a
fgdate not later than ten days
prior to the court hearing. The
Commission was also directed
to subpoena Allan B. Bowman,
Vice President and General
Manager of the Banner Mining
Company, who will be examined
by the Union as a part of the

« additional evidence.

The petition for judicial re-
view was filed by the strikers
without use of an attorney,
under special provisions of the
Arizona law which permit un-
employment insurance claim-
ants to present their case
through a representative of their
.choice—in this case, their Union.

' I The Union is claiming that the

strikers are entitled to unem-

‘ployment insurance payments

_because the real reason for lack_

7-of work at the Banner property

is the unwillingness of the Com-
‘pany to operate, strike or no

strike, until it can be sure that

‘ the Palo Verde Mine will not be

taken over by the Anaconda
Copper Company, which has op-

"tion arrangements with Banner

running until April of 1964.
The additional evidence to be

presented to the Employment

Security Commission concerns
admissions by Banner manage-
ment in negotiations on Septem-
ber 20 as to the real reasons for
the present situation at the
mine.

The lack of any present need
for the services of its employees
allows the Company to avoid
any real negotiations on the
Union's proposals.

Meanwhile picketing continues
at the property and the strikers
are being maintained by the
strike donations of other south-
west locals, Local 392 at Magna
Utah, and a weekly check from
the International Union Strike
Fund. Banner strikers are ‘de-
termined to hold the line until
a settlement is reached or the
property is finally taken over
by Anaconda.

= HE A.S.&R. COUNCIL, meeting in Kellogg, Idaho, the weekend
of October 20th, mapped out a 1964 national bargaining pro-
gram .and'7‘ass'ist‘ed Local 18 in smashing a Steel raid at the Page
and Galena mines of the A.S.&R. Company. The delegates, working.

morning, noon, and night, divided their time between the normal .

Council business and meeting A.S.&R. workers, attending organiz-
ing committee meetings, and two leaﬂet distributions at the mines.
The Council wrote and distributed its own leaﬂet to the Page and
Galena workers and assisted the Local in the windup distribution.
The delegates were also introduced to the community at a huge
dance sponsored by Local 18 the Saturday night prior to the
election.

After being welcomed by Pat Williams, president of Local 18,
the Council spent its first morning hearing reports from delegates
on conditions in their own smelters, refineries, and mines. Most

' of the delegates reported a slight increase of employment within

recent months. They also noted the continuous introduction of
new automated equipment. Considerable time was spent on safety
with Local 50 delegates reporting on the extensive work being
done in Selby by the Union on detection and prevention of lead
poisoning.

The afternoon session was devoted to a report on the raid
given by Luther Church, business agent of Local 18. Duringthe
discussion the delegates worked out their participation in the
campaign and voted to remain for the duration of the campaign.

N ENTIRE day was devoted by the Council to a discussion
of 1964 bargaining. The discussion was led by President Al
Skinner, and Board Member Barney Rask. A series of proposals,
ranging from the elimination of overtime during layoffs, additional
holidays, increased vacations, a variety of
job protection proposals, improved health
and welfare benefits and pension proposals
were adopted by the Council for national
bargaining. These demands supplement the
series of proposals adopted by the Inter-
national Executive Board at its last meet-
ing. The ‘Council also voted to conclude all
local negotiations before any national agree-

ment is concluded. '

All delegates stressed the importance of
local negotiations in 1964. The Council also
voted to make every effort to include Page
and Galena in national negotiations. That
evening the delegates had the opportunity
of meeting the members" and wives of the Page, Galena, and
Bunker organizing committees at a dinner tendered by the Ladies’

Dichter

Auxiliary of Local 18. ~

N MONDAY morning all the Council delegates distributed the
A.S.&R. leaﬂet at the Page mine. Each delegates wore a card

identifying his "Local Union. The distribution was enormously

impressive with delegates ranging from as far as Los Angeles,
California, to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and from El Paso, Texas,
to East Helena, Montana. The following morning all the delegates

THE MINE-‘MILL union

 

  Locals, Foreign Unions
 Support Defense Eﬁorts

The six present and past Mine-Mill officials convicted in the most recent stage of the conspiracy

case will be sentenced in the U.S. District Court in Denver Nov. 7.

Attorney George Francis of Denver has filed post-trial motions, and an appeal will be entered

after sentencing.

Meanwhile, local unions in the U. S. and Canada have been making increased contributions to
the Defense Fund and unions abroad have been continuing their pressure on the government to have

the case abandoned.

In Bingham Canyon, Utah,
Local 485 held a raffle which
netted $154 for the Defense

,5 Fund. This was contributed in

addition to the local’s monthly
contribution of $50. .

Chicago Amalgamated Local
758 has contributed another $100.
Local 711 in Erie, Pa. has in-
creased its monthly contribution
from $25 to $50. Canadian _Local

j 241 has sent in $200, and a $25
contribution has been received

from the Ladies Auxiliary of

' Canadian Local 312.

Local 124, Ruth, Nevada,
has commenced a monthly do-
nation of $10.

Brazil
From Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
comes word that the Union of

Metallurgical, Mechanical and
Electric Workers has been con-

, ducting a full-fledged campaign
_,on behalf of Mine-Mill.

\

The union has written to the
U. S. Ambassador in Brasilia
protesting his government’s
harassment of Mine-Mill, has
"published in its newspaper an
account of the conspiracy case,

and has sponsored a radio pro-.

gram on Radio Rio dealing with
the case.

Furthermore, Brothers Bene-
dito Cerqueira and Joao Mas-
sena, who are deputies, respec-
tively, in the federal House of
Deputies in ‘Brasilia and the

5’/state Legislative Assembly of

Guanabara, have read to their
colleagues in these chambers
copies of a pamphlet on th
conspiracy case. ‘

‘ England
The National Executive Coun-

* cil of the Association of Super-

visory Staffs, Executives, and

.‘Technicians has written Am-

_bassdor David E.  Bruce in

London that the council “is very
concerned at this latest attempt
to victimize the leaders of this
union and as a result . . . we

request that our views on this
matter should be brought to-the
attention of the appropriate
authorities in the United States.”

Douglas Local Active
ln Grievance Handling

DOUGLAS, Ariz.——The 50 members of Local 470

at the Paul Lime Plant here have at their. service an-

active, fighting union. Three recently processed griev-

ances prove the point:

On August 19, Brother Juan D. Ramirez, was fired

for allegedly being drunk at work.

The union decided, after reviewing the case, that
the discharge was unwarranted and immediately set the
grievance machinery‘ operating.‘

On Sept. 10, in a prearranged"

meeting with the company, the
union made a full presentation
of the case, discussing and prov-
ing wrong the company’s accu-
sation against Brother Ramirez.
The following day Ramirez was
reinstated with full seniority
rights.

On March 17 Brother Pedro
Ruiz was fired for being found
asleep on the job. By March 21
the union succeeded in having
Ruiz reinstated with no loss of
seniority or other provisions set
forth in the present contract.

Another ca_-se settled was that
of Brother Adolfo Valenzuela,
who was laid oﬁ Dec. 29, 1962.
The company failed to recall
him on January 25, upon their
restoration of forces.

When the union presented the
case, the company maintained
that Brother Valenzuela had
really been ﬁred for unsatisfac-
tory work and for disobeying su-
pervisors’ orders. _

The union representatives
present argued that not only
was proof lacking in the com-

pany’s statement, but that ac-
cording to the union’s knowl-
edge Valenzuela had not been
fired but laid off, together with
two other Paul Lime Plant em-
ployees, “due to general busi-
ness conditions." This was -the
language used by the company
in a letter to the local union at
the time of the lay-offs.

The union has achieved many
improvements in Working condi-
tions in this plant, including a
proper one-week advance notice
fo-r any change in employees’
days off, and a better medical
and hospitalization procedure,
which includes the worker’s
right to use hospital and doc-
tor’s services across the border
in Agua Prieta, Mexico. 1 ‘

The grievances were proc-
essed by Local 470 President
Juan Luis Mouilinet, Financial
Secretary Jesus, V. Parra, and

i?Approves Rights Bill

WASHINGTON——The House Judiciary Committee has now approved a civil rights

 bill that represents a compromise between what was originally proposed by the Pres-
.,ident and the much stronger bill written by House liberals. Added to the administra-
[ tion bill are provisions allowing the Attorney General to appear in suitsalleging viola-

tions of civil rights, and establishing a federal Fair Employment Practices Commis-

 sion. The Administration supports the ‘bill.

The bill now goes to the Rules Committee, which will attempt to keep it bottled up

  "as long’ as possible.

Maybe Next Year

  "Final action on tax legislation
“  this year is just about out of the
 _ question. The House-passed bill

 (HR 8363) .has no chance of

getting "anywhere fast in the

‘ Senate F in a n c e Committee,
.’“*ruled ‘by Virginia’s arch-con-

servative Sen. Harry Byrd. Bit-

: terly opposed to» any relief for
*'“working people, Byrd served
notice he planned a lengthy,
 careful examination of the bill.

' Administration leaders quick-

4- ly conceded the bill might have

to go over until next year, and

, labelled civil rights the Number
- 1* priority for the balance of this
- session—which, by the way, will

extend right up until the start

‘ of the second session on Janu-

ary 3.

' I « The House bill, proposing an
7 $11 billion tax cut over a two-

i , ‘year period, represents no great
“ -shakes for the man on the
-street; for example, a married

couple with taxable income of
$6,000 would net $3 weekly as

_ against $104 weekly for a couple
_ paying taxes on $100,000.

‘Right to Income’

CHICAGO (CNS)—-A breath-taking—or hair-raising—picture of  ‘ 

what lies ahead was presented here September 21 to a Chicago-area
conference of the American Association for the United Nations and
60 co-sponsoring organizations includiiig the Cooperative League.
The speaker was Robert Theobald, a UN consulting economist.’

The United States must regain full employment rapidly, he

said, “because the present demand of the civil rights movement  
for good education, housing, and recreation facilities as well as’

adequate incomes cannot be satisfied until full employment is

restored.” ‘

But full employment is only for the short-run. In the longer  

run, he said, there cannot be full employment, cannot be any jobs

at all in the wage system for a great many people, because of 
automation. “A large proportion of the children born in the fifties» '‘ - ;;
and sixties will never hold jobs involving the kind of work with-‘ 

which we are familiar today.’.’

Job-holding thus no longer
can be the basis for a person’s
claim upon needed resources

~ suchas food and clothing. And

the only alternative basis possi-

.ble, the economist said, is “to

provide every individual with an
absolute constitutional right to
an income adequate to allow
him to live with dignity.”

This great change will give

A people opportunity to develop

their individual interests and
talents as never before, Theo-
bald said. “The nineteenth cen-
tury concept of a man’s life as
a mere division between toil and
respite from toil should be al-
lowed to disappear . . .”

But the human development

made possible by an automated"

society requires certain other
freedoms, the speaker said, and

—Every person’s right f"to re-

c e iv e information undistorted I K‘:

by desires to mislead for pur-
poses of public or private gain.”

—Every person should be‘ .
“provided with guarantees about i -

' the quality of all goods he pur- I

chases.” In so complex "a so-»

ciety, in other words, the re- '

sponsibility for quality should be

upon the seller, not the buyer.’ 6 - I

Tax Bil Needs Amendments
ToClose Loophoes, Help Poor

The .income tax bill approved last month in the House. of Representatives, and
now scheduled for Senate action late this year, would grant an average 18% per cent
cut in individual federal income" taxes on 1 965 earnings. ' .

About two-thirds of the cut would be effective on income taxes payable in 1965

possible after enactment of the bill.

About 1.5 million taxpayers .,

with low, incomes would go off
federal income tax rolls alto-

gether. Individuals with incomes

of $3,000 or less would -receive
cuts averaging about $8 per
cent, and taxpayers _with m-

'comes over $50,000‘ would get

cuts _averaging nearly 13 per
cent. ‘ , v » 

The average union. member
could look forward to a cut of

‘over’ $100 in his yearly federal
' income tax bill.

‘Wealthy taxpayers "would re-
tain many of the tax loopholes
available to them under the
present tax law. Tax rates on

certain types of capital gains,
for example, are actually, re-
duced, and state, municipal and

county ~ bond issues, the “tax

_'haven”« of the rich, ofcourse,
_remain tax exempt. . ‘

But even for those whose in-
come‘ consists entirely. of tax-
able wage and salary income,
the new rates provide enormous

' and ' disproportionate tax reduc-
-tions ‘as compared with the re-

ductions gained by those in the

.lower income brackets. Take-

portionately much ‘greater, as

income increases.

, The tax reduction proposed by
the Conference_ _on- Economic
~Progress, headed by Leon Key-
-serling, President Truman’s
chief economic adviser, would
limit tax rate cuts to the _first

couple‘ and substantially in-
crease standard deductions for
other taxes, interest,- medical
expenses, etc. The conference
would eliminate tax cuts for
corporations’ and hold oﬂ on
tax cuts for those in the upper
-income brackets until all loop-
holes had been plugged. The ad-
ministration tax bill falls far
short ofﬂthis ideal. ' ' 6'

The Conference analysis says,

“The proposed (Administration) 1

F alconbridge  Mine Lay-or   s

0 — ' ' ,
I op 500 in Sudbury, Ont.
SUDBURY, Ont.—Local 598 is desperately trying to save the jobs of some 500 employees of

Falconbridge Nickel Mine, Ltd. Layoffs started Oct. 21. .
The company pleads a crisis in its operations as excuse; President Fraser described the layoffs

as surgery to save the patient.

Mine-Mill has proposed a solution, which all observers are confident would work, and which would

cost the company about $200,000.
The company's profits for the
first six months of 1963 were
$6.7 million. But Falconbridge
remains adamant and is pro-
ceeding with the layoffs. _
Fraser has already agreed, in
substance, to two of Mine-Mill’s
three proposals. The third pro-

- posal, which he has not agreed

to, is the heart of the matter.
The Union has suggested that
an arrangement be made where-

by no workers would be laid off,
but all would instead periodi-
cally “lay off” for one week,
during which time they would
collect unemployment compen-
sation. This plan has the ap-
proval of the Minister of Labor,
the Unemployment Insurance
Commissioner, and almost every

one else concerned -except the
company.

The two proposals the com-
pany has agreed to are early
retirement and elimination of

contracting-out.

Convention Re-elects
Smith and Long rdge

SUDBURY-——With a standing ovation, the delegates to the National Convention returned Ken
Smith by acclamation to the post of National President of‘ the International Union of Mine, Mill &

Smelter Workers in Canada.

, The nomination was made by Arnie Bennett, Business Agent of Local 663 at Britannia Beach in

B.C. where Smith first joined
the Union more than twenty
years ago. In his nomination
speech, Bennett pointed out that
Smith successively held posts in
the Union ranging from Shop
Steward to Vice-President of his
local union, to Western District
President and finally to the post"
now held, and paid tribute to the
energy and courage that Smith
had brought to every post he
had held in the Union. The
particular contribution that
Smith had made during the
course of the three-year raid
against the nickel workers of
Sudbury, Port Colborne and
Thompson, Manitoba, was noted
by delegates from the east who
seconded the nomination.

In his acceptance speech,
Smith said that he felt that the
experience and knowledge he
had gained from his long years
in the leadership of the Union
had been given to him by the
membership and that he held

(Continued from Page 1)
down some recommendations to
prevent repetition of this dis-
aster. If carried out they will
require ‘substantial investment
by the company to make the
mine safe, and will require
greater responsibility by all
men working underground. The
major recommendations, quoted
from the report, are as follows:

0 Positive ventilation of all
underground workings should be
provided before raises or drifts
are advanced. Until such posi-
tive ventilation is established,
work underground should be re-
stricted to that necessary to re-
store the mine to normal and
provide positive ventilation.

O A suitable dividing parti-
tion should be installed in the
shaft, and the main fan pro-
posed for use in ventilating the
mine should be installed on the
surface and put into operation.

0 A second opening to the un-
derground workings should be
provided as soon as possible, so
that sufficient airways and a
second escapeway are avail-
able. . l
0 If it is necessary to drive
crosscuts or drifts to provide
.adequate positive ventilation-, at
least 40,000 cubic feet of air a

» minute should be provided at

each working face to properly
dilute sudden gas releases and
provide adequate ventilation for
Diesel shuttle cars.

6 Underground shops should _

be ventilated with a separate
split of air, and air returning
from the shop should be di-
rected into the main return.

0 Preshift examinations of
the entire mine should be made
by certified persons before each
shift enters the mine. Suitable
records of such examinations

should be -kept “in a book on -‘-the.

surface; provided for -that pur-

se.
0 Tests for -gas should be A

made immediately before and
after blasting, and gas’ tests
should be made in face areas
before electrical »equipment is
taken into or operated at work-
ing faces. Gas tests should-also
be made at frequent intervals
while electric equipment is
operated at working faces.

0 Shots should not be ‘;tired\ ’

and electrical equipment - and
Diesel shuttle cars should not

be taken into or operatedin “a '

working place when 1.0 per cent
or more combustible gas is de-
tected in the place. * r
O The rule prohibiting, smok-
ing in "the mine should be strict-
ly enforced. ' 7 V
0 All ‘officials and employees
should be searched at sufficient-

ly frequent intervals so as to ‘

prevent matches, cigarettes and
other smoker’s ‘articles from be-

ing taken into the mine.

0 Diesel equipment used 

face regions should be a type.

approved as permissible for
gassy honcoal mines. ,

O Deteriorated e x p 1 o s iv e s
should not be left underground;
these should be returned to the

surface and proper disposal a

made; » _
O Boreholes should not be
charged at the same time drill-

ing or undercutting operations 4

are in progress. Charging‘ of
blast holes should be done -only
when other work in the face

area such as undercutting and _ ‘A 9

drilling is completed.

TUCSON, Ariz.—Preparation for 1964 bargaining was stressed at the District 2 Conference which met here
Oct. 11-13. Other subjects covered in the busy three-day Weekend were mine safety, legislative and political -action,
defense of the union, and civil rights.

In particular, the elimination of overtime was considered of

following contract changes:

1. Ban doubling, with neces-
sary fill-ins being made from
an extra board of laid-off em-
ployees, who could also be used
for vacation and other replace-
ments.

2. Forbid work schedules in
excess of 40 ‘hours when there
are employees on the laid-off
list.

3.’ Rule out compulsory over-
time in excess of standard work
week.

4. Increase overtime premium
pay, in order to discourage the
use of overtime scheduling by
the companies.

Other specifics recommended
by the conference included pen-
alties for work by supervisors,
inclusion of “automated switch-
board” and “remote control”
operating jobs within the bar-
gaining units, change in job slot-
ting and job evaluation provi-
sions so as to secure wages
above the . previous rates for
combined jobs and the opera-
tion of larger or more produc-
tive machines, and the institu-
tion of manning scales and
agreements on crew and job
consist so as to prevent speed-
up.

Legislative and Political
Action

The conference recommended
that Mine-Mill legislative efforts
be concentrated, at the federal
level, on five major objectives.

Income tax revision—a more
progressive. schedule than ap-
pears in the current tax bill,
and tax reform.

Civil rights-—support of the
President’s program.

Mine Safety:—lobbying work
of local unions to be directed
and coordinated by Internation-
al Office.

Medicare -- Mobilization

Bargaining
The conference generally endorsed the “Goals for 1964 Bargaining’? presented by the officers, and made specific
recommendations designed to implement national objectives relating to_ job ‘security.

of community support for King-
Anderson bill, which should
come to a vote before adjourn-
ment of Congress next summer.

Anti-labor legislation—Be alert
for committee hearings on a
number of anti-labor bills which
have been introduced in Con-
gress.

Delegates also proposed that
each local union should estab-
lish a political action commit-
tee, and that the union should
raise funds to support major
legislative objectives and candi-
dates for office.

Defense of the Union

Major emphasis on defense
work was placed on a proposed
educational campaign, to be car-
ried on by v the International
Union through Defense Commit-
tees to be established in each
local.

Local unions were urged to
find ways and means to con-
tinue and expand their financial
support of the Mine-Mill Defense
Fund to insure complete _and
necessary legal aid and counsel.

Local D e f e n s e Committees
were encouraged to explain the
facts of the conspiracy -case and
the SACB case to other com-
munity groups through appear-
ances at their meetings -or by
community activities programs
of the local union.

Civil Rights

The conference adopted sev-
eral proposals dealing with civil
rights. Locals were urged to set
up civil rights committees to
work on discrimination in em-
ployment, state and municipal
public‘ accommodations laws,
and support of a constitutional
amendment’ to abolish ‘the poll

'-tax. -The amendment needs rat-
iﬁcation by onlyone more..stat=e

in order to:-become..1aw.

AS<S}R GLOBE REFINERY in Denver, under contract with Globe Refinery Workers Union, Local 557, is largest producer of
refined cadmium in the world. Output of about 4,000,000 pounds per year accounts for about 40 percent of total U. S.
production of cadmium. Always a money maker for AS-(ER, the plant will have a banner year in 1963 -and again in 1964-.
Sharply higher prices for cadmium, now $2.50-$2.70 per pound compared with $1.60—$l.70 per pound at start. of 1962, are
more than doubling the plant's contribution to AS&R's booming profit totals. Raw material, mainly lead and zinc flue’
dust, is shipped to Globe from AS&R smelters in U. S. and Mexico.

BUNKER HILL COMPANY profits are looking up. Charles E.
Schwab, president of the big lead-zinc producer in the Coeur
d’Alene district in Idaho says the company’s profits for the six
months, July-December 1963, will be 15 to 20 per cent ahead of
those for January-June this year. Profits have been as follows in
recent years:

1961 $ 939,610
1962 1,604,531
1963 (1st 6 months) .......................................... ._ 1,591,144
1963 (2nd 6 months) ....................................... .. 1,830,000-1,910,000

as estimated by Schwab

It thus looks as if Bunker Hill profits for the full year, 1963,
will be close to $3,500,000. Higher prices for lead and zinc have
been responsible for some of this increase in profits, but a substan-
tial proportion of this gravy for the company has come out of the
hides of Bunker Hill’s workers. Authority for this is no less a per-

son than Charles E‘. Schwab himself. He is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal for October 16 as saying mechanization has enabled

the company to “consolidate dozens and dozens of jobs. _As a re-
sult, we’ve been able to cut our payroll, mostly through attrition,
by $1 million a year to $12 million.” What was the leadership of
Bunker Hill’s, union doing while all this was going on?

ANACONDA COMPANY has a 40-man crew prospecting, map-
ping, and doing geophysical work on a block of about 350 claims in
the Marathon area of Ontario on the northern shore of Lake Superi-
or. The claims were staked recently after the Canadian govern-
ment released new aerial magnetic maps of the district. Anaconda
has been working quietly in the area for years, but moved quickly
to stake- its claims as prospectors started to move in following re-
lease of the aerial maps. Tight-lipped Anaconda officials. gave no

- clue to findings to date in the area which may be rich in copper-

nickel ores.

Anaconda has also taken working options covering about 12
square miles south of the Bethlehem Copper mine in the Highland
Valley area, British Columbia. If production commences, lessors
would have a 25 per cent interest in the operation, while Anaconda

LEAD PRICE rose again last month to 12 cents per pound.
This confirms predictions reported in this column last. month that
lead was going up. Simon D. Strauss, vice-president of American
Smelting and Refining Co., says that if lead (and zinc) go to 13 or
14 cents, U.S. mine production would increase significantly.

STOCKPILES by now are an old subject, but many readers
may have forgotten the huge quantities of metals now held by
Uncle Sam. Senator Symington (D., Mo.) recently released current
figures on U.S. stocks of over 20 metals. With the exception of cad-
mium, which is in short supply, these metals are being held off the
market, even though many exceed U.S. emergency requirements.
Uncle Sam is using some of his copper stocks, however, for mint-
ing new pemiies. Here are some of the principal metals held in
stockpile, along with 1962_ U.S. mine production:

CANADIAN ELECTROLYTIC ZINC opened eastern Canada’s
first zinc refinery near Montreal last month. Cost of the plant was
about -$17 million, which was put up by Mattagami Lake Mines,
Orchan Mines, Geco Mines, Quemont Mining Corp., and Normetal
Mining‘Corp. These five mining companies account for about ,8
per cent of world, mine production of ‘zinc. Concentrates in excess
of what the newplant can handle will be exported. The new plant
may handleores previously exported to the US. for refining.

NEW BRUNSWICK is getting a new lead-zinc smelter at Bat-
hurst, estimated to cost between $20 and $30 million. Construction
is expected to begin this year. The plant will be controlled by
Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corp., which holds a lead-zinc-
copper-silver property with ore reserves estimated at 58 million
tons. Total deposits in the area are estimated preliminarily by
Canadian government geologists at 150 million tons containing 5.6
per cent zinc, 2.3 per cent lead, 0.5 per cent copper and 1.9 ounces
of silver per ton. If these estimates are proven, the area will be-
come one of Canada’s major metal mining areas.

Boyajian Talks
At Dist. 2 Meet

Paul Boyajian, Chairman of the U. S. Interior Department
Mine Safety Study Board, addressed the District 2 Mine-Mill Con-
ference at Tucson, Arizona, on October 11.

Boyajian is an Arizonan, from Phoenix, and before his address
be greeted several of the conference delegates from District 2
mines with whom he ‘had visited since his appointment to the Board
by Interior Secretary Udall. The Board was established in May,
1962 to assist in guiding the two-year survey of health" and safety
conditions in metal and non-metallic mines, under the Mine Safety
Study Act passed’ in 1961.

In his talk to conference dele-
gates, Boyajian said that Sec-
retary Udall’s report to -Con-

unions and made available to
the Interior Department had

years. He added that reports of ,
mine injuries prepared by local '

gress based on the two-year
survey was virtually completed
and would be released in the
near future. Due date for the re-
port was last September 26.

Boyajian said a wealth of val-
uable data onhealth and safety
conditions had been collected in
the course of the two-year sur-
vey. He parried numerous ques-
tions from conference delegates
as to what the report would rec-
ommend. “It’s a report to Con-
gress,” he said, “and after it
is made available I hope every-
one here will have a chance to
read it.” -On behalf of the In-
terior Department, Boyajian ex-
pressed appreciation for the
“very helpful” cooperation of
Mine-Mill local unions in. mine
-safety surveys over the last two

been especially valuable. He
stressed the theme that safety
is a joint concern of labor and
management, -with the ultimate
objective of “reducing accidents
as close to zero as possible.”
Folowing Boyajian’s talk,
President A. C. Skinner, Sec-
retary-Treasurer Irvin Dichter
and Research Director Arthur
Stuart spoke to the delegates.
Skinner said the fight for a fed-
eral mine safety bill is far from
won and that all Mine-Mill
locals would have to get in the
fight when Congress considers
mine safety legislation next
year. Dichter praised the Met-
calf-Montoya mine safety bill
which was introduced in Con-
gress last July. “It’s an excel-
lent bill,” said Dichter, “with

Buﬂe Miners lniurecl

Thirty Butte miners were
doused with liquid chemicals
from a ruptured cooler line to
the underground‘ air condition-
ing system at the Anaconda
Company's Mountain ‘Con mine
September 30. The "men were
being lowered in "cages and

.were'hit by the liquid just be-

low the 1200 foot level where
the pipe was broken. Among
the chemicals in the solution
was sodium‘ dichromate, a toxic
skin irritant. The cages were
promptly raised to the surface,
where the men were rushed to
St. James Community Hospital.

"The hospital went on a modi-

, fied disaster status, with three

eye specialists and 12 other
hospital staff members to treat
the miners. A Eyes were irri-
gated, examined and treated.
All men were treated with-
in an hour and .a halffof
arrival at the hospital. Causes
of the break in the line were
investigated by Anaconda Com-
pany officials. The law author-
izing the U.S-. Bureau-of Mines

to investigate mine accidents of
this nature had expired four .-

Phosphate Miner Killed

Brother Stanislaus Krzan, 40,
was killed instantly October 5

a widow and three dependent
children. Krzan was standing 18
inches to two feet beyond the
last timber set, operating a
blowpipe on a blockhole when
about six tons of shaley phos-
phate rock fell, covering him to
a depth of two feet.

The U.S.-‘Bureau of Mines in-
vestigated the accident, under
an order authorizing it to in-
vestigate accidents that occur
at mines on Indian or public

lands.’ The following is quoted

from its report of. the investi-
gation.

“The fall of phosphate rock
came from an area near the
hangingwall structure. The sec-
tion that fell was about 8 feet
long, 4 feet wide and 2 feet
thick. A slickenside surface
was in evidence along the west
side of the caved area. This
weak structure had been en-
countered and had paralleled
the drift along the hanging wall
side of the bed for about 10 feet.
It had been supported where it
was first encountered. '

“This accident was caused by
a failure to detect and either
support or take down loose back
material. ,

“Compliance with the follow: _

ing recommendations may pre-

f vent accidents of a similar

nature in the future:

0 Thorough and complete ex-
aminations of the‘ back and
walls -should be made’ before

starting any phase of the op-1

eration and ’ frequently‘ there-
after.

*0 Doubtful walls and -back
should be taken down or sup-
ported adequately. I

'0 Closer and stricter super-
vision ,_should be maintained in
regard to roof ’conditio'n‘s_.:

MEXIGII

Mexico’s new profit-sharing law goes into effect next year. I» 

Starting next January, companies must give their workers a share

of the profits earned in 1963. The exact share that will go to work-.1  
ers has yet to be determined by a commission established unde_1_‘~->_.g,‘

" the law. The commission is said to be considering a formula where-I ” '

by workers will receive as a bonus from 8 to 60 days’ pay, depeﬁd:.,1 
ing on wage levels and the number of days worked. The sizejof thei-1 T 

bonus could be varied from year to year. '

 

Mine operators are reported by trade journals to be  in ‘arms. 7.

quiring foreign mining companies to retain not more than a 49 “

percent interest in their Mexican properties, will also be ‘affected’

by the profit-sharing law. Barron's Magazine, pub1ished[by.‘the"_-l_'"

owners .of Wall Street Journal, says, “Despite all their headaches,

however, Mexican operations have been in the black and currently 
contribute perhaps 40 cents per share to ASARCO’s earnings.” This

figures out to a profit of over $2 million a year for the company '-

from its Mexican operations.

GIIILE

Chi1e’s largest newspaper recently estimated that strikes at _.  ”
Anaconda and Kennecott controlled Chilean mines over the years‘ 
1957-1962 inclusive have caused a production loss of ‘over 200,000_' ‘
tons of copper. Interestingly enough, the paper says more thgn 1,.

one-third of the total population lost was due to wildcat strikes.

A sign of the growing importance of native labor andithe. die-"ii f l ‘

clining role of English and other European workers in the Rhode-

sian copper mines is the notice served on the European Mine Work-“

ers Union by Anglo-American Corp. and Rhodesian Selection Trust,

in which American Metal Climax has an interest. The notice was to _. - v
the effect that labor agreements presently in force would be-ter-‘ - 

/\ minated in six months. The union agreed to the contract termina-

tion. «

Meanwhile, in Southern Rhodesia, a court of arbitration has 
handed down an award in a wage dispute between the native mine  1

workers union and the metal mining companies. The union had

proposed wage increases that would have cost the companies ‘$8,-_

400,000 per year—they got increases costing only $280,000 per" year,» i-_‘_.7

Wﬂllll WEEK "

President Kennedy, who has consistently opposed labor’s drive S

for a federal 35-hour work week law said the following in a speech
at Whiskeytown, California, in September, “We had a 58-hour week,
a 48-hour week, a 40-hour week. As machines take more of the‘
jobs of man, we are going to find the work week reduced, and we
are going to find people wondering what they should do.

To labor, this statement gave rise to hopes the President would ~ 17‘

back a 35-hour law now. But when he returned to Washington the

President was asked about his statement and said he didn't mean 

now—he was thinking about the year 2000. _ -

BRAGERDS

Congressman Henry Gonzalez, D., _San Antonio, Texas, has_'an-

nounced he will ﬁght the bill to extend for one year the federal‘

program forimporting farm laborers from Mexico. Last May the
House of Representatives defeated such a bill. The Senate passed-

T a one-year extension bill last August and this is the bill the House

now has to consider. Gonzalez said he is for better. wages and ' it

are, like himself, of Mexican heritage. “The existing labor i3npo;;t_*_

bill is vicious," he’ said. “It’s an abomination to the American tra- " ‘ If
