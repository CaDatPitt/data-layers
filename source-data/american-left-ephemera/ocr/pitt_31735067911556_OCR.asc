gPRiMlUM PLRICE BII.-l.: Introduced by Sen. James Murruy',(Dem.,Mont.), this bill includes
basic ideas supported by Mine-Mill for emergency so_lulion- of the lead-zinc crisis. Our
union is urging two very important amendments to thebill (see story at left):-

ginal lead and zinc. mining operations.

It seeks to put the small operator back‘

in business. ,,

ONE PROPOSED Mine-lvlilll amend-
ment would not limit the payment of

subsidies entirely to the neetls of the.

national security stockpile, but would
create a separate stockpile for the ex-

4 press purpose of promoting conseiya-_.
‘ton of resources and stabilization of

metal prices. v /
Another proposed Mine-Mill amend-

ment would delete atprovision prohilJit- ~’

mg subsidy payments to any operator
who pays wages higher than those‘ pre-
vailing in. the district. It would substi-
tute a provision to require employers
to observe minimum standards of health
and safety and to payat least the pre-
vailing wages in the area.

The section of. Mine-Mill_’s program

tovexpand metals consumption calls for“

a public. works program’ including such

‘Copper market cllppears.

.; headed for oversupply

 COPPER MARKET now seems to be  toward the same
kind of crisis that has already hit lead and Zl1'1C. ~ Copper demand

 ‘is still good but recent developments point to trouble ahead.

Here are some of these recent developments —

1. Imports from abroad will be much
higher this year than the substantial
600,000 tons that came in last year.
A flood of foreign copper is expected
in the second halfof this year when
copper from Rhodesia, the Belgian
Congo, and Union of South Africa,
over and above imports from Chile
and other regular suppliers, start
coming into the country. ~While these
are generally called “ﬁoreiamm im-

parts” they are, in most cases. im- ‘

parts from foreign holdings of U. S.
contro_lled c o m p a n i e s. Newmont
Mining and American Metal. for ex-
ample, have substantial holﬁngs in

both .Nortl\er,n Rhodesia and Union _

of South Africa. And‘ “Chilean cop-
per”. is just another name for Ana-
conda and Kennecott.

1. Some ‘copper prices weakened last
ilreelr, mainly as the result of ‘new
competition from Belgian -Conga cop.-
per which was offered at 32 cents,
or four and a half cents lower than

the price on Chilean copper. Custom
smelters also cut their price‘ to 32
from 34 cents. Previously allntajor
domestic producers adopted a uni-
form 30‘cents price. This meant that
Kennecott and Phelps Dodge came
up a few cents while Anaconda cut
its price by two cents.

3. Scrap supply moved on to the mar-
ket in. .vast quantitieyas  result
of current. high. prices. The March

intake of copper scrap by custom L

smelters is estimated at 20,000 tons

as compared with an average intake

of slightly over 5,000. tons. in-19.51’.
, One unidentified source is quoted by
the Wall. Street Journal of April 13 as.
-summing up the situation in these’
words: ;

“There! wmzit be room. here for the
consumption of all domestic copper
mine output, cc larger supply of’ scrap,
’Ii11/9't(lsl’,f’l‘(M% Chile, emd“now copper frovm

lead-zincﬁproblent one of trade

- .. Depression of the lead and zinc mar»-

kets’ is also p_p1-‘imarily due to interna-
tional trade difficulties. rather than
any lack of demand, at--least’. so. far, in
.the U. s. - ‘_

 fact, which forms the‘basis~of

Kine?-l£iEl”s proposals» for» expanding,

It’s strange ‘that’ the prospect of -

peace should cause an “awful dilemma"
for the Eisenhower administration. Yet
that’s what most of theiwashington
wise men are saying.‘ ’

After all, the election campaign
didu’t take" place; so. long ago: People
restember how. Eisenhower announced‘
he was going to Korea. And all through
the country faces lit up with at great
hopefor "peace.

The administration 'can’t brush off

0 the Cl1.inese— proposals to settle the K0-

rean prisoner‘-of-war issue ,and' so end
the ﬁighrtings 'l2o,.do» so might. lead mil-_

lfions of pee‘pl"e¥.~_ttr think that 'Eis'en-

. want peace. Yet‘ millions vote:.l..for'

Eisenhower‘ in 'No.vember because they
tlsmught, he was the_ man --who ‘could

_ -THVE USUAL* cold water hasn't come '
from ire-presentatives and senators on_
‘Capitol Hill. In " their official “reac-

tions” they tried to inject caution; but
esen so, the feeling broke through that
ma.ybe; this time there really was a
hope for. peace. In all parts of the
country people. have waited) for soldiers

.to ‘come home-—and as long as the

 goes on,’ tbere’s always the

 danger they might not return. After-

the Chinese. proposal youcould feel the

And yet with all this--the best" of

N ew steel head threatens

to start raids over again
There was bad news for working people. of the United
States and Canada last month in the inaugural address of
David J. McDonald, new president of the United Steelworkers’.
McDonald wants to start the raids on Mine-Mill all over
Speaking‘ to the International Executive Board and

workers Union that sometimes I almost
explode.

“. . . But with all of this I am not
satisfied. The United Steelworkers of
America must not for many months
longer be known as the second largest

‘ union in America. It must be known

as the largest union in America, and it
is up to you to do it.”

To satisfy McDonald’s ego, to help
him feel that he is a “complete presi-
dent” of the largest union, the_Steel
staff are to raid Mine-Mill locals, dis-
rupt bargaining, create divisions where
there should be unity. ‘ “ .

IN 1937, during the bitterly fought
‘Little Steel” strike in which many
workers lost their lives, McDonald was
in Hollywood taking a screentest. Fail-
ing to find the opportunity. for glamor
there, he now see s it as “complete
president” of the. biggest union". ’

It is to be hoped that pressure from
the rank and file in Steel, and perhaps
the counsel of more responsible men’ in
leadership, will alter the plans of this
eg.:oinaniac—even at the risk of cans-
ing him to feel less than complete.

Phillip Murray, the former Steel
president, had to lear_n,the hard way
that he could not pirate away our
union. It will be tragic if McDonald
mustlaern it the same way ’ ‘

I Ansonia Local 445   pl

buys its own building

Brass Company plant here took the first step toward realization of.
adream. The dream was wrapped up in a long-range plan to purchase

a building to house their union . . . Mine-Mill’s Ansonia Brass Workers ,

Local 445.

On Friday, April 10, 1953, the dream came true.
On that day the Board of Directors of the Ansonia Brass Workers
Building Fund, lnc., signed papers of ownership for the union’s new

headquarters, at building at 54-66 Main
Street in Ansonia. ‘

Purchase price of the building is
$50,000. Ownership was established
with an initial payment of $25,000. A
mortgage of $25,000 is held by the
Ansonia Savings Bank.

The building. a 3—story structure in
the heart of Ansonia’s business dis-
trict, houses four business establish-
ments ‘on the street floor, professional
and business offices on the second
floor, and a meeting hall on the third
floor that runs the entire length of the
building, with an estimated seating‘
capacity of a thousand.

TWO LARGE ()l<‘l*‘lCES on the sec-
ond floor will be occupied by Local 445,

.\-ith the top floor hall reserved for

meetings and other local union activi-
ties. Occupation of the new headquar-
ters is expected to be completed by
June 1. V

The Building Fund’s Board of Direc-
tors who signed the papers of owner-
ship are: 5

Anthony Milardo, chairman; Thomas
Broderick, treasurer; D. James Supp,

recording secrcita1'y'; Michael Gazy,
John J. Rapuano and Joseph Francolini,
trustees.

Arrangements have. been made for
the ‘Home Trust Company of Derby,

" Conn., to manage the building. I

i\’.'one-y for final purchase of the
building on April 10 was raised entire-
.I;/ through monthly Social affairs and
contributions of subscribers t(, the
Fund. But‘ there’s a lot more than
money involved. «

PURCHASE of the new Mine—Mill
Local 445 headquarters just five years
after the Building Fund was estab-
lished represents not only a long-

.. cherished dream come true. It sym-

bolizes achievement of the highest de-
gree of the Union’s stability here as
well as the united support and loyalty
of the rank and file membership.

(joining as it does smack in the
teeth of a'UAW—ClO raid on the local,
purchase of the $50,()()() building an-.
nounces to all and sundry in no un-
certain terms that Mine—Mill Local 445
intends to be here for many years
longer, doing a job for the Ansonia
brass workers.

Oil steal posses House, i

hear

WASHINGTON—(FP)—The prom-
ise of Republicans to the big oil inter-
ests that they would get at least $40
billion worth of so—called offshore oil
was one step closer to fulfillment after
the House approved the gigantic hand-
out.

 

‘ Final passage in the House was by I

a vote of 285 to 108. This followed
failure of a motion by Rep. Emanuel
Celler (D, NT) to kill the measure by
recommitting it to the committee. Cel-
ler’s move failed by a vote of 283 to
106. Ninety Democrats, 15 Republi-
cans and one independent voted to re-
commit. '

The House measure would give Cali-
fornia title to all mineral resources
under the water for three miles out.
Louisiana and Texas would get con-
trol 10‘,é miles out.

THE HOUSE BILL also authorized
the federal gov_ei-nment to develop min-

,eral resources on the continental shelf
.beyond the limits controlled by the
states. This is regarded as a sore spot
in international relations, since navi-
gable waters beyond the usual limits
are regarded as international.

The Senate bill, upon which debate
is in progress, gives the states the
same rights as in the House measure
but merely confirms federal title to
the continental shelf mineral deposits
without authorizing development of
them. Debate in the Senate is expected
to continue through the week after
Easter. ‘

ray (Mont.), Clinton Anderson (N.M.)
and Henry M. Jackson (VVash.),, issued

a minority report calling the bills “gi-

gantic giveaways.” They held the oil

belongs to all'the people of the U. S.‘

and expressed belief the bills, if parsed,
will be held unconstitutional. The U. S.
Supreme Court has twice held that ti-
tle to the oil belongs to the federal
government.

CIO Pres. VV-alter P. Reuther, who
also heads the United Auto Workers,
sent every member of Congress a cov-
ering letter and copy of the resolution
passed unaniniously by the recent
UAW convention.

IT CALLED FOR retention of the
oil rights by the U. S. and use of rev-
enue from sale of the oil for aid to
education.

“If this deal goes through,” the reso-
lution said, “and is approved by the
President, the big oil companies will
reap vast profits. They can make a bet-
ter_ deal for themselves with these
states than they can get if the leasing
of these offshore lands for exploration
and development is retained within the
control of the U. S.

“The offshore oil giveaway, if ap-;-

proved by the President as indicated,
will be only the opening gun in a gi-
gantic grab of vast natural resources
which belong to the people of the U. S.
—forests, oil, gas, vater rights, water
power, grazing lands, coal and other

minerals with an estimated total value

of $1,000 billion.” -

,  §iSen.Golclwai‘er
   answers union
with red smear

PIIOENIX, Ariz.———A delegation
representing all Mine—l\li1l local
"unions in Arizona, led by Board
Member C. D. Smothermon, met
with Senator Goldwater here this
month. Goldwater is sponsor of
the worst anti-labor bill yet to go
before Congress.

The meeting had been requested by
Mine‘-Mill. The Senator had accepted
only on this. condition: “Until I am

«‘ furnished with information that your

union is not Communist dominated I

;’iwill-discuss only this matter with your
irepresent at ives.”

While the union representatives were
waiting for their appointment with
Goldwater in a hotel, they happened
to overhear a telephone convcr" tion
between the Senator and a representa-
tive of Phelps Dodge Corporation by the
name of Riley. Senator Goldwater was
heard to say: '

“We got. boxed into this meeting. I
sent them .a wire saying that I would
not talk with them unless they would
deny that they were Communist. They
may not show up, b . I think you bet.-
ter get. on over here anyhow. I hope
they don't Show up.” A

RILEY ARRIVED shortly after-
wards, and attended the conference.

The llrline-Mill delegation of 18 was
larger than the Senator’ had antici-
pated, and a larger room had to be
found. He objected to use of a tape re-
corder by the union. Upon Goldwater's
agreement to have his court reporter
make a transcript of themeeting for

the union, the Mine-Mill ‘people
drbpped theirinsistence upon a tape
recording. .

To meet. 'Goldwater’s pre-condition-
9"‘for the session, Henry Marquez of
Morenci Local 616 explained that Mine-
- Mill is “dominated” only by its mem-
bers. Marquez and others told ‘how
policy is formulated and carrieC_l-bout.
A copy of the Mine-Mill Constitution
was given. Goldwater frequently inter-
rupted with references to the McCar-
ran sub-committee hearing’ in Salt‘
Lake City.

Finally_ he said, “Well, what else do
you have to talk about?” The union
_ spokesmen then went into the, matter, ‘
. of the lead-zinc crisis and the union's’
recommendations to solve it. This was
led by_Int’l Rep. Maclovio Barraza.
T1-IE SENA'l-‘OR-then was asked if
he had any questions on'the subject.
He said he knew nothing about the
mining business, but that when he
wanted information on it‘-he went to.
- sources other than unions. As an‘after-
‘ . f thought he added .“in Wash’ igton.”i
The union spokesmen, it”the Sena-

. tor’s suggestion, then opened up on the

z_ * Goldwater-Rhodes bills. Marquez spot :

‘ ' on this: also David Velasquez, presi- ,
U,_4(l_ent of Local 616, and Int’l Rep. Syl-'
 vain Schnaittacher. ,

Rightgin he middle of a sentence by
a unionreprcsentative, Goldwater stood
up, said the union had not met his con-

? dition for holding the meeting, and
that he was adjourning it. He walked
out.

GOLDW.-\'l‘ER then issued to the
press a blast against Mine-Mill say-

’ ’ ing he had adjourned the meeting be-
cause the union spokesmen -had _“re-
fused to assure him that their union
‘is not Commnnist-dominated.”

Answering‘ this attack, Marquez
said: i . '

“Obviously, the Senator was not pre-
pared to defend his pro,;osed bill to a
group of miners, millmen and smelter-
men who know the/score on union op-
eration."

Fight for rent control,
ugoinsl thought control

(‘lll(‘.A(}(), lll.-Locul 758, with other.

labor and community oi'g‘anizal;i()ns, is
niziking; a hard light "on two critical

lc-gisl:ilivc issues in lllinois——to main-
tain rent: control and to glefcut the
“l*}1-oylcs Bills” which are “little” Mc--

Carrnn and Smith acts.

Il'un(lrc(ls of members signed peti-
tions l’u\'ol'ing cmitimintion of’ rent con-
trol, and eiglil: local-mombt'l's partici-
pated in a dcleg':ll.ion to Illinois Gov-
ernor Slratl;on. So far, the (lovernor
and a ma_iorit_\"of the legislature are
going along with the real estate inter-
ests and torpcdoing rent. control.

Local Secretary Mae Wretling, who
led the loca|'s delegation to the Gov-
ernor, reporled back that labor and
the common people can count on no
consideration at the state capitol un-
less they build up more pressure and
activity.

Denouncing the “Broyles Bills” as
undemocratic measures aimed to beat
down labor under the worn-out cover-
up of attacking‘ “subversives," Local
758 is opposing these bills together
with the Illinois C10, the State PTA,
state university, religious and other
groups. Members have been urged by
the local’s executive board to discuss
issues at all meetings and to send hun-
dredsiof postcards to the legislature
asking defeat of the bills.

.«.

THREE UNIONS were represented in this delegation from Chicago to stale capital at Springfield, lll., to lobby for ‘rent-control. Union:
were Mine-Mill’s Amalgamated local 758, and local unions of United Electrical, Radio 8. Mochineworkers cInd_lnl’l longshoremen's

  GE admits Goldwater

WASHINGTON -- (Fl?) —— The Gen-
eral Electric Cq. admitted its author-

ship of the ideas behind" the Goldwater-

Rhodes unionbusting bill April 9 and

strongly urged its adoption. Wt-sting-.
house Electric Corp. also, approved the.

bill. ;
At the same time the Eisenhower ad-

.mi_nistration came up with a new “anti-

Communist” formula which its spokes-
men said would be more speedy in
“cleaning out” the labor movement.

These developments came _in testi-
mony before the Senate labor commit-
tee in a day devoted entirely to pro-
posals for eliminating from organized
labor everyone considered by the gov-
ernment to be "pro-Communist. William
.1 Barron, labor relations counsel for
GE. told the committee his company
presented its ideas in detail to the Sen-
ate labor-management subcommittee
under Hubert H. Humphrey (D., Minn.)
last year. ’

“We find,” he said, “that the outline
of the program we there recommended
to Sen. Humphrey’s subcommittee has
been largely filled out and incorporated
in Sen. Goldwater’s bill, and we conse-
quently indorse S 1254 heartily.”

THE BILL introduced by Sen Barry
M. Goldwater, freshman Republican
from Arizona, gives the Subversive Ac-
tivities Control Board under the Mc-
Carran act life-and-death pbwer over
unions. It -authorizes outlawing of
unions and union leaders on such a
broad scale that any opposition to au-
thority “could be a basis -for action Rep.
John-J. Rhodes, also a freshman Re-I
public:-tn from Arizona, introduced an

‘identical bill in the House. ' «

Westinghouse Vice Pres’. Robert D.

Blazier told _the committee_: “We be-'

lieve the step taken in S 1254 embodies
our beliefs.”‘ . e

   proposal is its baby

water outrage. It came from big ‘busi-

ngss. What about its objectives?
BARRON preceded his eulogy of the

, Goldwater bill with a blazing broadside

against all organized labor and all la-
bor leaders. They were/ denounced in
to,to because they have not accepted the
Taft-Hartley act willingly and» helped
the hangman tie a noose around their

_ necks.

Barron complained that all, or prac-
tically all, organized labor objected to
his formula——now the Goldwater for-
mula—when he presented it to Hum-
phrey. He forecast organized labor will
oppose the Goldwater bill.

But his presentation to the ever-
sympathetic Goldwater, who was alone
on the labor committee dais for much

of the time, was even more revealing

than that.

THOUGH he declared several times
the proposed legislation is aimed only
at Communists, he unwittingly revealed
the truth that it is aimed.at all unions
For one thing, he aimed deadly darts
at the lntl. Union of Electrical, Radio
& Machine Workers (CIO), of which
anti-Communist James B. Carey is
president.

2 ‘He denounced many anti-Communist
unions for defending members dis-
missed from their jobs "on charges of
Communist sympathy. “One thing about
which we are naturally concerned,” he
said, “is the question of how genuine
has been the conversion of some of the
union leaders who are active as organ-

izers or local officers of the anti-«Com-«

munist IUE.” _.,

He cited the United Auto Workeifs.

(CV20). as a union which still has big
“Communist-dominated” locals. vHe
cited the ability of the United Mine

national minorit_v group, won re-elec- ,

tion by about 5,0()().votes. Despite the
known existence of scandalous voting
irregularities in big Eastern cities,
Senate investigators and FBI agents
have been concentrating on New Mex-
ico. ,

A series of articles in the Denver
Post, quoted here, 'referred to Mine-
l\'lill's support of Chavez as something
_sinister. and mistakenly said weihad
claimed credit for re-electing the
Senator.

l\lIl\’E-MILL spokesmen pointed out

that we had made no such claim, but
had expressed our pride at having
played a part in his re-election.

Chavez last week charged that “tho
pvople of New Mexico bitterlyresent
that a disappointed candidate has
smeared the entire state for his defeat.

“I know and Hurley knows and the
people know that I beat him fairly and
squarely unde‘r the most terrific handi-
cap——t:he strong-Eisenhower swing in
New Mexico.

“Il"the election were held today, I
would win by 3(l,000‘votes. That’s how
disgusted the people have become.” '
