political oppression
and its victims

The exact number of prisoners persecuted and jailed in
Southern Africa for their political’ and ideological convic-
tions is unknown. In South Africa, South West Africa,
Rhodesia and the Portuguese-controlled regions of
Angola and Mozambique all opposition is efficiently and
often brutally persecuted. The Police State penetrates the
fabric of life in all of these countries, but the best docu-
mented evidence on the nature of this system can be
derived from actual cases found in South Africa, the
keystone of the entire southern African region.

In South Africa there are reliably estimated to be about
8,000 political prisoners. The South African police state
tries to conceal the extent and nature of its persecution of
political opponents, seeking to create an atmosphere of
terror and helplessness within the country, and it often
succeeds in hiding the existing widespread opposition to
its vicious racism from the outside world.

the police stale acts
where it can in secret....

I detaining men and women under the “180 day”
clause, in solitary conﬁnement for endless months, with-
out charge or trial, without the right to a lawyer, without
even public announcement of the detention.

I banning and placing under “House Arrest” political
opponents against whom it has not even the ﬂimsy evi-
dence needed to prosecute in Court. There are now over
600 people thus punished without trial, who risk a jail
sentence for any slight infringement of their restriction
orders, for talking to a friend similarly banned, going to
a movie or a wedding, or forgetting, just once, to make the
reporting trip to the police station.

I torturing prisoners to extract confessions or evidence
against others, with complete immunity for the torturers.

I trying people “in camera”— for only a few of the
almost daily political trials in South Africa are ever
reported. They are usually held behind closed doors, in
remote corners of the country where access to counsel is
diﬂicult and expensive. There men and women are tried
in batches, sentenced and jailed for 3, 6, 10 or 15 years-—
often under a total blanket of silence.

    

  

but the veil of silence can be torn

Political prisoners can be reached and defended both in
South Africa and Rhodesia. For some years the South
African Defense and Aid Fund helped organize the legal
defense of men tried for political resistance. Now the
Fund has been banned—out1awed—because it did its job
too well. A similar organization now exists in Rhodesia,
although its lifespan is precarious. But there are still
courageous lawyers prepared to ﬁght for the politically
accused in the courts. And they need ﬁnancial help to
carry on with their work.

the importance of legal defense

The Courts in South Africa are often biased; many judges
support the “Herrenvolk” Government. And it is com-
mon for witnesses to perjure themselves, giving false evi-
dence against others, perhaps because they have been
broken by torture and beatings, perhaps to save their
own skins. But adequate defense can still sometimes
secure an acquittal or at least a reduced sentence, as in
the case of Dr. Pather, who was sentenced in 1964 for
21/2 years for allowing his premises to be used for a
meeting of an unlawful organization— the African
National Congress. On appeal, by a Defense and Aid
lawyer, his sentence was reduced to 18 months, with 9
months suspended. It is certain that, without defense,
many of the hundreds acquitted in recent years of politi-
cal “crimes” would have been convicted, and that even
more savage sentences would have been imposed on
those found guilty.

A NEW POLITICAL PERSECUTION has now been
devised: the re-sentencing of people for substantially
the same offense. Again the case of Dr. Pather illustrates:
on the day when he was due to be released, he appeared
instead in court, again in the dock. Three charges were
read, all relating to the original offense, for which he
had already been punished—allowing his house to be used
for a meeting, contributing money to the African
National Congress, and allowing his house to be used
in collection of funds. He was re-sentenced on these
charges to 18 months, 12 months and 6 months, respec-
tivelyl

There are hundreds, perhaps thousands now in prison
who face just such a travesty of “justice”, for the Govern-
ment fears to release them. These prosecutions can be
challenged, but the cases must be contested at every point,
and many will have to go to appeal.

FUNDS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIGHT
THIS NEW ATTACK.

Evidence of torture and police brutality must be publicly
exposed. This will not end all torture, but it may act as
a curb on the Secret Police drunk with its own power . . .
and expose the nature of the South African regime to the
all too complacent world.

The Case of Violet Weinberg: an elderly woman who
was ﬁrst held in solitary conﬁnement for six months, then
sentenced to three months imprisonment for refusing to
give evidence against others politically accused. In Court
Mrs. Weinberg told of her nightmare: 70 hours of third
degree interrogation by a team of six Security police,
working on her in relays. She was made to stand for 70
hours, was refused food, and was threatened with the
arrest of her young, deaf son. She cracked eventually,
and made a statement to the police, but subsequently
refused to give evidence in Court, saying that she had
been blackmailed and coerced into giving that statement,
and if she had consented to give evidence she would have
been regarded as a martyr by the whole world. The Judge,
when sentencing Mrs. Weinberg, said that he assumed
that her evidence of torture and solitary conﬁnement was
true—but that the method used by the Police to extract
information from her had no relevance to the issue
before him!

There have been countless allegations by African and
other political prisoners of beatings, electric shock treat-
ments and other brutalities. Currently Z. Methopeng, a
leading member of the Pan Africanist Congress now in
jail, is suing the Minister of Justice for injuries sustained
under interrogation. Such cases are important because
they will reveal the true nature of the South African
regime.

families suffer

Political repression brings not only injustice and personal
agony to prisoners but reverberates throughout the entire
southern African society where farnilies—wives, parents,
grandparents, children—former1y dependent on the earn-
ings of the family breadwinner—are left stranded with-
out even this meagre income.

There is 21 year old Josie Nonyaniso of South Africa
who was left to look after ﬁve small brothers and sisters
when her parents were jailed—her father for 8 years, her
mother for 41/2 years. Her husband died last year, and
she has a baby of her own. Who will help?

From Rhodesia there is W. H. Mabena, who was ﬁrst
imprisoned in 1962 under a 5 year restriction at Gona-
kudzingwa for supposedly contravening the Law and
Order Maintenance Act. His family of 5 children, an old
mother, and aunt managed to live on his small savings
and the earnings of his wife who was a schoolteacher-
until she was ﬁred. Not only did Mrs. Mabena lose her
$25 a week job, but her husband was reconvicted for
5 year term. Where does this leave the Mabena
ather comments, “. . .I am completely a
y land of birth ” .

aid is possible

Welfare Committees, for instance, are usually able to
pay some rents and give little food, mainly fortiﬁed milk
and soup powder—and to make cash payments (about
$9 a month) to some families. In Rhodesia and other
areas, similar organizations try to help the victims of
racism as best they can, but even this aid will cease if
money does not come soon.

education . ..o necessity
for prisoners and their children

One of the keys to the future of southern Africa is the
education of her people, and although under existing
conditions of political, social and economic repression,
the form of African education is purposefully retarded
and made inferior, it is still vitally important to provide
at least some learning for political prisoners and their
children.

A Rhodesian prisoner has commented, “we ﬁnd ourselves
with more time than we need with the result that every-
one of us is studying, not only to while away the time but
in order to turn this prison evil into a blessing.” The cost
of correspondence courses and books average over $150
per year, per prisoner. Through direct payment to the
University where the courses are given, we have enabled
a number of prisoners (where allowed by the authorities)
to save their sanity through education.

In addition prisoners with families are constantly asking
for help in providing their children’s school fees, uniforms
and supplies. An African child, in contrast to a white
one, does not receive free education, and an imprisoned
father cannot provide for these necessities. Only you can
do what the state refuses to do.

refugee relief programs

There are countless refugees not only within the coun-
tries of southern Africa but gathered in camps and towns
of independent Africa to the north, particularly in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Zam-
bia. Educational centers and refugee camps have been
established, primarily for refugees from Angola and
Mozambique, and there is a constant need for food,
clothing, medical supplies and educational aids. This is
particularly true with the increased activity of freedom
movements within these countries and the resulting dis-
placement of families, the need for new and independent
schools within liberated areas, and medical centers. The
concern must be for all of southern Africa. The hand of
racism has blighted the lives of the oppressed; the vic-
tims of this system must not become forgotten people.
They need your help—and they need it now!
