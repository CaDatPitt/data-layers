 

NO RESUMTION OF U.S. NUCLEAR TESTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE

The recent series a approximately 50 Soviet nuclear tests has yielded
some new military information to the Soviets“ Neverhteless, we oppose the
resumption of U,S. testing on moral, political, and psychological grounds
which we believe outweigh any possible advances in weapons technology.

The resumption of tests would:

1. Create another spiral in the arms race and provide the USSR.and
other nations with the incentive to undertake other tests to "catch up".

2. Add to international tension at a moment when general disarmament . s
negotiations are about to resume thus raising the question of U.S. tincerity.

3. Spread a feeling of despair of people at home and abroad because of
our seeming inability to bring a halt to the arms race,

h. Damge the image of the U.S. around the world especially in Japan,
India, and Africa. In these areas there was a significant though tardy reaction
to Soviet testing. -In these countries the U.S. is looked upon as a nation with
a higher standard of international conduct than the Soviet Union.

5. Add to the existing level of radioactive fallout consequently endan-
gering the health of present and future generations. Although there is no
way toxneasure the exact amountuof damage, it is particularly unfair to the
unborn and uncmmitted to subject them to this danger through a decision in
which they have no choice.

The White House announced Oct. 30, 1961, "The existing nuclear weapons
arsenal is superior in quantity and quality to that of any other nation. The
U.S. today has aple military power to destroy any nation which would unleash
nuclear war."

The Atmic Energy Comission states that as of January 11, 1962, the
U. S. has held 162 announced nuclear weapons tests; the USSR has held approxi-
mately 105 such tests; Great Britain has held Zl; and France h.

IFonmer Ambassador James J. Wadsworth said Nov. 18, 1961, "If the U.S.
resumes atmospheric testing, within our own country and throughout all nations,
men will be forced to conclude that in reality primitive military and political
considerations are our true guide regardless of our protest that a more lofty
ideal inspires us to champion the cause of reason and peace.”

To the editor: The Comittee would very much appreciate receiving all editorials
and/or articles, pro or con, which appear in your publication on the issue of
atmospheric testing. Any questions you might have or requests for more informa~
tion on general peace activity in this country(or internationally) should be

sent directly to the Committee and will be promptly answered.
