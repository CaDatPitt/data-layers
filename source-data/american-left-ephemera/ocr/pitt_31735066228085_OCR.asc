WEALTH AND POVERTY T

. The United States is the richest country in the world. §
“Uncle Shylock” is the creditor of all countries. The world
owes the United States today not less than 23% billion dollars.
The yearly income of the United States _from foreign invest-
ments amounts today to the huge sum of one billion dollars.
The number of millionaires is growing fast. In 1919 there were
only 65 incomes over a million; in 1926 there were 228. In
1919 there were only 189 incomes between $500,000 and
$1,000,000; in 1926 the number was 465.

In his 1926 address to Congress President Coolidge said:
“The wealth of our country is not public wealth but private
wealth. It does not belong to the Government; it belongs to
the people.” The prodigious wealth of the country is private
wealth, but the “people” who own it are not the work-
ers and exploited farmers. They V are the few million- 
aires. The country is growing richer, but the share of
the millions of working people in the wealth of the
country is decreasing and the share of the few powerful mil- 
lionaires is increasing with amazing speed. One per cent of all ’
recipients of any income in this country receive not less than
20 per cent of the whole national income and get not less than
86.2 per cent of all corporate dividends. One per cent of the
population possesses today not less than 33 per cent of all wealth;

10 per cent own 64 per cent; and the poorest 25 per cent pos-

sess only 31/2 per cent. The overwhelming majority of the

“people” to whom President Coolidge refers are born poor and

die poor. The Federal Trade Commission states that “about :

one per cent of the estimated number of decedents owned 1

about 59 per cent of the estimated wealth, and more than 90 {

per cent was owned by about 13 per cent of the decedents.” 
i

The accumulated wealth is not distributed equally. Hana’
in hand with the growing fortunes of the few millionaires goes
the growing exploitation and poverty of the unskilled workers,
Negroes, and exploited farmers. Even President Coolidge was
forced to admit in his Hammond dedication speech that there 9
is a "considerable class of unshilled workers who have not come 
into full participation in the wealth of the nation.” The share
of the wage-earners in the national income has decreased. The

manufacturing wage—earners received only 40.1 per cent of the
“value product” in 1925 as against 44.8 per cent in 1921. The
wages of the shamelessly exploited four million agricultural
workers amounted in 1920 to 2.3 per cent of the national in-
come and in 1926 to only 1.4 per cent. The "democratization”
of wealth is only a capitalist myth. Bankers and industrial
magnates own the big corporations. The workers do not pos-
sess more than one per cent of all stocks and bonds. “High
American wages” is today the most popular publicity stunt
of American and international capitalism, but high wages
embrace only a thin aristocratic stratum of the working
class. The overwhelming majority of wage-earners is not able
to earn even suﬁicient to fulfill the most elementary needs of
a decent life. In the middle of the most advertised prosperity,
in the summer of 1926, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimated that the average wages for “common labor” were
42.6 cents an hour. The United States Department of Labor
was forced to admit that huge sections of the working class are
receiving wages of only $10.34 a week.

President Coolidge made the bold declaration that "the
people are prosperous,” but reality shows that the overwhelm-
ing majority of the people work on starvation wages, that
nearly 60 per cent of the workers still work more than 48
hours a week, that women and children, Negro and foreign-
born unskilled workers are exploited at least as mercilessly as
the most exploited strata of the European working class. The
prosperity of the "people” is best illustrated by the miserable
shacbs of the Southern cotton fields and the poverty-strichen
slums of the Eastern cities. In his 1926 address to Congress
President Coolidge said: “The power of the purse is the power
over liberty.” A handful of millionaires exercise power over
the purse, and they exercise power over the liberty of the over-
whelming majority of the people of the United States. A hand-
ful of powerful millionaires own all the means of production—
the factories, machinery, mines, railroads, water power——of this
country, and are thus in a position to force the overwhelming
majority of the people into wage slavery. The wealth of the
few is the poverty of the many; the liberty of the few is the
bondage of the masses.

INDICTMENT OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM

Overproduction and starvation, overtime and unemploy-
ment, accumulation of wealth and accumulation of poverty—
these are the features of capitalist prosperity for the Workers
and working farmers. The very fact that there can be such
a thing as overproduction as long as the needs of every mem-
ber of society are still unsatisfied is the most terrible indictment
against capitalist society. Cyclones of periodic crises sweep over
the whole capitalist economy. Capitalist society is unable to
control its own forces of production. As the President of the
United States Chamber of Commerce put it in his speech of
May 10, 1928, there has been an "economic thunderbolt of in-
creasing zbroduction unloosed by industry.”

Unemployment is a permanent phenomenon in capitalist
society. There is at any time 1V2 million unemployed. The
constant industrial reserve army is one of the props of capital-
ist society. The present depression with its 4 to 5 million un-
employed workers brings untold misery. The labor of hun-
dreds of thousands of children is one of the basic institutions
of capitalism. Peonage, no better than chattel slavery, Jim
Crowism and lynching are regular accompaniments of present-
day capitalist prosperity. The shameless exploitation of the un-
skilled foreign-born workers and the oppression of whole races
are parts of the capitalist system. The modern industrial serf-
dom of company towns is in existence to the glory of the
“freest” constitution in the world. Capitalist industry conducts
in the form of industrial accidents a bloody war of extermina-
tion against the working class. The infamous speed-up system
causes the workers to age prematurely. Old workers are
thrown away like slack, like useless byproducts. Not less than
1,800,000 old people are forced to live the life of “dependents.”
Sickness and early death are the punishment for poverty. The
United States Public Health Service states: “Both sickness and
death are much more frequent among those with low incomes
than among those with incomes adequate to comfortable living.”

Capitalist decency and morality is symbolized by alms-
houses, brothels, slums, and bootleg saloons. Prostitution of
science, literature, and art is on the same level as prostitution
of Women. Capitalist “justice” is equivalent to frame-ups,

third degree, filling the penitentiaries with political prisoners,
execution of working-class fighters like Sacco and Vanzetti.
There is a crusade against the “crime wave,” against petty
larceny by the poor, conducted by those who are guilty of large-
scale corruption and lobbying. With the exception of back-
ward and impoverished China and India the powerful and
rich and civilized United States is the only country which does
not have any social legislation. The latest “achievement” of
American imperialist civilization is the appearance of a rentier
class completely divorced from the process of production and
foisting its parasitic existence upon the toiling masses. Jingo-
ism, militarism, robber wars against Nicaragua and China-—
these are the results of American capitalism.

President Coolidge summed up in the following Way his’
picture of American capitalism: "Those are some of the economic
results which have accrued from the dmerican principles of
reliance upon the initiative and the freedom of the individual.
I t is the very antithesis of C ommunism.”_. And President Cool-
idge is right. American capitalism as it is-—With all its econ-
omic, political, and moral results-is the very antithesis of
Communism. There is no other alternative. The issue is
capitalism or Communism. The Workers (Communist) Party
of America declares itself the deadly enemy of capitalism. It
has as its aim the overthrow of capitalism, the establishment
of a Workers’ and farmers’ government, the establishment of a
Communist society in which the means of production Will not
be the private property of the few, a society which Will not be
based on profit but on labor, which will not be founded on class
divisions, which will eradicate both imperialist Wars and class
Wars, which will be able to eliminate poverty.

THE PARTIES OF BIG AND SMALL BUSINESS

With the exception of the Workers (Communist )Party
all political parties and groups are defenders of the present
capitalist society.

The two old capitalist parties, the Republican and Demo-
cratic, are twin brothers in the expression of the interests of
the bosses.

The Republican Party, which in the interests of the then

 

12 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

revolutionary capitalism conducted a war against chattel slavery,
is today working in the interests of the now counter-revolu-
tionary capitalism for the perpetuation of wage slavery. ‘The
Republican Party of today‘ is nothing but the party of trusts,
of ﬁnance capital, of the biggest business interests of the country.

The Democratic Party Was in the early stages of its history
the party of slavery, against Northern capitalism and in the
interests of the Southern plantation owners. Today, though
many times masked with phrases of liberalism, it stands for the
perpetuation of the peonage of Negroes in the South and for
the maintenance of wage slavery throughout the country.

There are no real political diﬁerences between the two big
political parties. Both are parties of capitalism; both are the
enemies of the working class. The very existence of the two-

[party system is the most reactionary factor in American poli-

tics, is one of the factors which are responsible_for the lack of
an independent mass political party of the working class. Both
capitalist parties try to put up the semblance of being defenders
of the farmers, vying with each other in putting forward fake
“farm relief” measures. The "struggle” between the Re-
publican and Democratic Parties is a staged fight, a mock
struggle. There are no political issues between these two par-
ties. On the question of tariff, prohibition, taxation, imperial-
ist war, farm relief, League of Nations, and all other discussed
political issues there is much more division within each party
than between the two parties.

The main slogan of the Republican Party today is “Pros-
perity.” But reality shows depression and unemployment. The
main slogan of the Democratic Party is: “Honesty in Govern-
ment.” But reality shows at least as much corruption on the
part of the Democrats as on that of the Republicans. Tammany
Hall can successfully compete in corruption with Teapot Dome.

There are several classes combined in each of these parties.
Both still mirror in many respects the old sectional and re-
gional groupings of the country, but in both there is an out-
spoken, decisive dominance of finance capital. Both are one on
the basic issues: the oppression of the working class, themain-
tenance of the exploitation of the workers and working farm-

ers, and the robber policies against the colonies and semi-col-
onies of dmerican imperialism.

The group of so-called Progressives is by no means better
than the Republican “Old Guard” or the Democratic heroes
of Tammany Hall and the “solid” South. In 1924 the bulk
of the so-called progressive group supported the LaFollette
movement, which betrayed the interests of the working class
and the working farmers, dissipating the discontent of the
masses and leading them back to the capitalist parties.

In 1928 the attitude of the so-called Progressives is still
more cowardly. They have even deserted the idea of a third
party, and have gone back meekly into the old capitalist parties.
Senator Wheeler came out openly in support of Al Smith, who
is the embodiment of the new Tammany Hall and the hero
of the labor-smashing policies in the needle trades. Senators
Borah and Norris and their Republican colleagues are equally
untrustworthy. Borah’s empty gesture of “outlawing” war
serves only as a cover for Kellogg’s imperialist wars and war
preparations. Senator Shipstead, who still usurps the name of
a Farmer-Laborite, is betraying the interests of the workers
and exploited farmers in the most shameless way. He upholds
the Nicaraguan war, and gives his support to the anti-labor
injunction policies of the courts by introducing a fake anti-
injunction bill. These “progressive” Senators and Congress-
men are in many respects more dangerous enemies of the work-
ers and working farmers than the oﬂicial spokesmen: of big
business, because they hide their capitalist face and create illu-
sions in the minds of the masses. All these Progressives and
semi-Progressives serve as a prop of the present capitalist society
and must be combatted by all honest workers and farmers.

The ofﬁcial leadership of the American Federation of La-
bor is today part and parcel of American imperialism. Under
the leadership of the most corrupt trade-union bureaucracy in
the world the A. F. of L. has become mainly an organization
of the labor aristocracy, an instrument of class collaboration
with the bosses instead of a means of struggle against big busi-
ness. The capitalists are conducting the most murderous of-
fensive of the open shop and wage cuts against the workers.
The answer of the leaders of the A. F. of L. is a joint pro-

 

14 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

posal with the American Bar Association for a Federal anti-
strike law. The traa'e—union bureaucrats are today the partners
of the bosses, They are trying to wrench the weapon of the
strike from the hands of the workers. The Whole infamous
system of labor banks and trade-union insurance—trade-union
capitalism—is nothing but the most elaborate system of class
betrayal. The leadership of the A. F. of L. does not conduct
any struggle against wage cuts or for higher Wages and shorter
hours. The trade-union bureaucracy sabotages the great task
of organizing the unorganized. The worthy heirs of Gompers
—Green, Well and Co.—are the advocates of the "Monroe
Doctrine of Labor,” are the spohesmen of a "labor imperialism.”
They have come out openly for a policy of common exploitation
of all Latin-American peoples by the capitalists and workers
of the United States. The B. and 0. plan, the Mitten plan,
compulsory arbitration, the transformation of the trade unions
into semi—Fascist and semi-company uni0ns——is today the policy
of the A. F. of L. These corrupt misleaders of labor are
helping to keep the workers in the camp of the old capitalist
parties by maintaining the sterile and treacherous policy of
“reward your friends and punish your enemies” Within the
capitalist parties. There cannot be successful struggles of the
working class against its exploiters without a systematic strug-
gle against the whole ediﬁce of the labor aristocracy and its
corrupt bureaucratic leadership.

The Socialist Party of -America, which still claims to be
a working-class party, is in fact a party of the lower middle
class. Its leadership has become part of the bureaucracy of the
A. F. of L. Its whole ambition is to inherit the traditions of
the LaF0llette third-party movement. The militant spirit of
Eugene Debs has been completely wiped out from the Socialist
Party. In Wisconsin the Socialist Party is an official party of
the capitalist administration. In New York the Socialist Party
has substituted the red-white-and—blue flag of patriotism for
the red ﬂag of revolution. In Reading the city ofﬁcials of the
Socialist Party have pledged themselves to "understand that
their responsibilities will be those of capitalist officials rather
than of Socialist Party members.” James H. Maurer, one of
the councilmen elected by the Socialists in Reading and vice-

Presidential candidate of the Socialist Party, declared: “We are
going to give the Workers a typical Working-class government,
but if there is a strike in Reading while we are in power, the
capitalist employer will have his property and life protected as
he never had it before.”

The presidential candidate of the Socialist Party, Norman
Thomas, is the worst kind of pacifist, a typical preacher, who
performs the greatest service for American imperialism by
creating illusions about the League of Nations, about the pos-

sibility of preventing wars by peaceful means. The Socialist _

Party today is an advocate of the League of Nations, and is a
supporter of the hypocritical “peace offensive” of Secretary of
State Kellogg. The Socialist Party is uttering some critical

' phrases about the War in Nicaragua not because it is an im-

perialist War in the interests of Wall Street but only because it
is “unauthorized and unsanctioned by the people or Congress.”

The Socialist Party of today is for the protection of cap-
italist law and order, is against revolution, is against the Work-
ing—class government of Soviet Russia, and supports every
measure of the A. F. of L. bureaucracy for class collaboration.
The Socialist Party has transformed its party organization from
a membership organization into a ward organization of voters.
It has shifted its class basis from the Working class entirely
and deﬁnitely to the lower middle class. The last national.
convention of the Socialist Party in April, 1928, Went so far
as to drop the class struggle pledge that applicants for mem-
bership had to sign in the past. .

The small sects, the Socialist Labor Party and the Prole-
tarian Party, have become completely fossilized, and do not play
any role in the political life of the country or in any of the
struggles of the working class.

The Workers (Communist) Party is today the only genu-
ine working-class party. It is the sole party which has a pro-
gram for the Workers and working farmers. It is the only party
which conducts a relentless struggle against capitalism, against
the old parties of the bosses and against the corrupt labor bu-
reaucracy and the treacherous Socialist Party.

The Workers (Communist) Party is the party of the class
struggle. It is the deadly enemy of class collaboration because

 

16 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

it is the deadly enemy of capitalism. It is the revolutionary par-
ty of the Working class. The Workers (Communist) Party
is the champion of the interests of the Working class and the
working farmers. It is the advocate of the most exploited stra-
tum of the Working class, of the unskilled workers. It is the
champion of the oppressed Negro race. It is the organizer of
the struggle against imperialism, against imperialist Wars.

The Workers (Communist) Party is the only party which
ﬁghts for the interests of the working class, working farmers,
and the oppressed Negro race; and that is the very reason why
all the forces of the old capitalist parties, the bureaucrats of the
A. F. of L. and the leaders of the Socialist Party are united
against the Communists. The Republicans, Democrats, Social-
ists, and labor bureaucrats have a common platform. That
platform is Red—baiting, anti-Communism.

In its 1928 election campaign the Workers (Communist)
Party offers the following program against trustified capital
and in the interests of the working class, working farmers, and
oppressed Negro race:

II. THE CURSE OF UNEMPLOYMENT

There is a heavy economic depression over the country
with a very heavy unemployment in its wake. Bread—lines are
long. Hypocritical “charity” is in its flower. Even conserva-
tive Senators estimate the number of unemployed at four million.

The curse of unemployment is the most terrible plight of
the working class. The cyclical crises of capitalist industry
bring with them time and again the untold sufferings of mass
unemployment. But there is unemployment not only at times
of crises; it is here at all times. Unemployment on a mass
scale is a "normal” phenomenon of this glorious capitalist society.

The very technical progress—-the development of new ma-
chinery, the increased productivity of labor—-becomes under
capitalist conditions a source of growing unemployment. The
introduction of new machines has decreased the number of
workers. The opening up of new markets cannot keep pace
with the speedy development of technique. The introduction

 

  

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 17

of machinery makes the skill of the workers superfluous. Large
masses of unskilled workers can take the place of the skilled.
The time of apprenticeship is being greatly shortened. Young
workers and even children can take the place of adults. A
growing number of women are entering into industry.

The introduction of machinery creates the basis for mass
production. Mass production with its murderous competition
ruins the lower middle class and drives its members as workers
into the industries. Monopoly capitalism ruins the farmers and
forces them to sell their labor power as industrial workers in
the cities. Mass production opens up hitherto backward agra-
rian regions industrially. A large-scale industrialization of the
South is taking place, and has driven hundreds of thousands of

"Negroes into the industries. Despite all prohibition of immi-
gration there is an annual influx of hundreds of thousands of '

workers from other countries.

Under present capitalist conditions it is inevitable that
there should be a constant industrial reserve army of jobless.
Even in the best periods of prosperity the number of jobless is
estimated at one and a half million. In 1927, the factories
produced 26 per cent more than in 1919. During this same
period the number of wage-earners employed in manufacturing
decreased by not less than 980,000. Eleven per cent fewer
Wage-earners than in 1919 produced in manufacturing in 1927.
26 per cent more products. In other words, each worker pro-
duced 42 per cent more. The same tendency manifests itself
everywhere. The railways had in 1927 almost 200,000 less
workers than in 1919. The number of "superfluous” miners
is near to a quarter of a million. In manufacturing, mining
and railroading, there were almost one and a half million fewer
workers employed by the end of 1927 than in 1919. During
the last few years there has been a continuous movement of
population from the farms to the cities: in 1925, 834,000, in
1926, 1,020,000, in 1927, 604,000 more persons left the farms
for the cities than the cities for the farms. A large proportion
of these bankrupt and ruined farmers became industrial workers
or rather tried to become industrial workers. Even Secretary
of Labor Davis has been forced to raise the question:

"Is automatic machinery driven by relentless power going

to leave on our hands a state of chronic and increasing unem-
ployment? Is the machinery that turns out our wealth also to
create poverty? Is it giving us a permanent jobless class?"

A capitalist Writer characterizes the present unemployment
as a “technological unemployment, not cyclical——-an unem-
ployment developing gradually, almost unawares, like creep-
ing paralysis, in the midst of unprecedented prosperity, the by-
product of improved technological efficiency.”

Unemployment is indeed the "creeping paralysis” of capital-
ist society. It represents the most vicious contradiction of the
present economic order. The more machinery, the higher the
productivity of labor, the more unemployed. Labor itself pro-
duces unemployment. Unemployment of one part produces
overtime for the other part of the working class. The pressure
of unemployment forces Wage-earners to accept jobs at lower
wages and longer hours. The fear of unemployment is the
most powerful dhain which binds the workers to wage slavery.
The fear of unemployment increases competition among the
Workers. Unemployment lowers the power of resistance of the
workers on the job. The working wage-earners are forced to
accept overtime. Overtime again makes new masses of Wage-
earners superfluous. Unemployment creates overtime, and over-
time creates unemployment. The bigger the factories, the more
expensive the machinery, the greater is the tendency of the
capitalists to lengthen the working time instead of increasing
the number of workers. Hand in hand with the increasing ac-
cumulation of capital goes a relative and today even an absolute
decrease in the number of Workers.

The hypocritical advocates of capitalism lament about the
existence of unemployment and call it the “greatest blot on our
capitalist system” (Owen D. Young), but in fact the existence
of a constant industrial reserve army is not a hindrance to
capitalism. Quite the oontrary. It is one of the basic condi-
tions for the existence and maintenance of capitalism. Tech-
nical development, new inventions, the introduction of new la-
bor-saving machinery will not cease. The opening up of new
markets will not go on at the same speed as heretofore. The
industrialization of the colonies, the increasing competition with
Europe, the existence of non-capitalistic Soviet Russia, and the

revolt of the colonial peoples are the narrowing limitations.

The present depression is not an ‘'accident.’’ It has been
brought about by prosperity itself. Disproportion between pro-
duction and consumption, which is a part of the general anarchy
of capitalist production, is responsible for cyclical crises. Sat-
uration of the automobile and building construction markets,
over-production of oil, the World coal crisis, the migration of
the textile industry to the South, the limits of installment buy-
ing, the restriction of the farmers’ market, the effects of Amer-
ican export of capital and of the stabilization of Europe, the in-
creased competition with Europe—these are the basic features
of the present economic depression. Neither the existence of
huge monopolies and trusts nor the “interventions” of the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank are able to prevent the occurrence of eco-
nomic crises.

There is no cure for unemployment under capitalism.

Shortening of the working day alone would not do away
with unemployment. A general shortening of the Working day
Would result in general part—time work, in perpetual overpro-
duction, would bring about a crisis in permanence.

High wages alone cannot cure unemployment. It is futile
to try to “convince” the capitalists to increase Wages for the
purpose of increasing the purchasing power of the workers.
The capitalists will never sacrifice a portion of their profits,
by transforming it into Wages, for the purpose of broadening
the home market. Just the opposite is the policy of imperialist
capitalism. It is cutting wages everywhere, and trying to in-
crease its exports for the foreign markets.

Neither can public works alone cure unemployment. Public
works would tend to increase the forces of production, and

I would in the long run tend to reproduce unemployment on a

larger scale. Higher Wages, shorter hours, and public work:
would not cure unemployment, but might bring about a certain
limited and temporary relief.

An especially dangerous illusion is created in the minds
of the workers by a Whole string of efficiency experts and coon-
omists of capitalism who predict a so-called capitalist efficiency
“socialism.” These capitalist engineers and experts try to make
the workers believe that it is possible not only to cure unemploy-

    

 

20 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

ment but to liquidate capitalism itself by social insurance, profit-
sharing and employee stock-buying plans, by technical improve-
ments, by elimination of waste, increased mass production, or
various forms of State capitalism. This capitalist efficiency
“socialism” is the more harmful because its real aim is not the
liquidation of capitalism but the liquidation of the every-day
struggles of the workers to improve their living and working
conditions and the wiping out of all revolutionary movements
of the working class.

Unemployment is a world phenomenon today. The constant
industrial reserve army has always been in existence, but the
present chronic unemployment has assumed such proportions
that it is no longer a prop of capitalism but an organic defect,
one of the basic sicknesses of post—war capitalism. Unemploy-
menlt ;is a horrible curse upon the working class. It is the most
powerful weapon in the hands of the bosses. It chains the
Worker to wage slavery. It brings tormenting uncertainty into
the life of every wage-earner. It breaks up the family of the
worker by driving the women and children into the factories.
It brings about moral degradation; creates a slum proletariat.
There follows in its wake a growing criminality. It is the
foundation of prostitution. In other words, it embodies and
sums up capitalism as a whole.

DEMANDS

1. Unemployment insurance. A federal system of un-
employment insurance should be established. A federal law
must be enacted immediately by Congress providing for unem-
ployment insurance for all wage-earners Without any exceptions
or disqualifications. The amount of compensation should be full
wages for the entire period of unemployment, up to $30 per
week. An unemployment insurance fund should be created, fifty
per cent to be contributed by the employers and fifty per cent
by the State. The amount contributed by the State should be
raised by special taxes levied against inheritance, high incomes
and corporation profits. The administration of unemployment

III. THE OFFENSIVE OF THE BOSSES

The Working class of this country is facing a great crisis.
A general offensive of the bosses is being conducted against the
workers, an offensive to smash the whole trade-union move-
ment, to lower the standard of living of all workers.

The trustification of capital, the erection of huge mono-
polies, the all embracing rationalization have increased the power
of the bosses tremendously. _

Tlze capitalists are using all methods of rationalization
mercilessly. Wage-cuts everywhere——in the shoe, textile, auto-
mobile and rubber industries and in mining. A whole system
of speed-up has been put in operation. The stop-watch, group
piece work, bonus system, efficiency engineering, the conveyor

or travelling—belt system increase mass production and intensify
the exploitation of the -workers. Concentration of industries,
Fordization, technical innovations, and the wholesale introduc-
tion of new machinery is the order of the day. The lengthen-
ing of working hours is attempted everywhere, with especially
disastrous results for the unskilled workers. An injunction
mania raves against every movement of the workers to resist
the effects of rationalization. All the forces of the Government
—-the police, the state constabulary, the coal and iron police,
the most infamous spy system.--are mobilized against the Work-
ers. The open-shop drive, the “American Plan,” is today the
official policy of the capitalist class on the whole front. Com-
pany unions are being set up by the bosses, and strenuous at-
tempts are being made to company-unionize all existing trade
unions. All the combined forces of the bosses and their gov-
ernment are concentrated to prevent the organization of the
unorganized masses in the basic industries.

The trade union bureaucracy of the A. F. of L. has met
the general offensive of the bosses»-—by a general surrender.
There has never been in the history of labor such a shameful
capitulation as the treachery of the A. F. of L. leadership and
of the Socialist Party in the present grave situation of the
American labor movement. Instead of fighting the harmful
effects of capitalist rationalization, these misleaders try to co-
operate in introducing speed-up systems and capitalist efficiency.
They put forward the “union-management cooperation” policy.
They babble about “industrial democracy.” They have elaborat-
ed the “higher strategy of labor,” the notorious theory of Mat-

.thew Woll about the three stages of the American labor move-

 

ment: the stage of conflict, of collective bargaining, and of
worker-employer cooperation. They proclaim the passing of
war and truce and the coming of the age of permanent peace
between the bosses and the workers. The trade union bureau-
cracy has dropped the last semblance of any resistance to com-
pany-unionizing the trade unions. They have come out openly
for the Watson-Parker Bill and for a federal anti-strike law.
They have dropped their previous petty-bourgeois trust-busting
program and have become the high apostles of “efficient” trusts.

The result of the offensive of the bosses and the treachery

of the trade union bureaucrats is the growing crisis in the labor
movement. Trustified industry is out for a general open shop.
The trade unions have been driven out from all basic industries.
For the first time in the history of the A. F. of L. the number
of organized workers has decreased even during a period of
prosperity. The climax of the struggle was reached in the
present fight of the United Mine Workers of America. This
most powerful and most militant unit of the American labor
movement has now been broken to pieces and delivered to the
mercy of the operators.

The present depression has ruthlessly exposed the notorious
formula of the trade union bureaucracy about "mass production,
high wages and low prices” as the foundation of permanent
prosperity. Millions of workers are jobless, desperately walk-
ing the streets. The crisis in the labor movement and the de-
pression have exposed the true meaning of all class-collaboration
plans. They show up the so—called profit—sha.ring, employee
stock-buying, group insurance, B. and 0. plan, Mitten scheme,
and other systems of “union-management cooperation,” eThe
smash-up of the labor bank of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers is beginning to open the eyes of the workers to the
disastrous effects of trade—union capitalism.

Despite all the treachery of the labor bureaucrats, the
worhers are beginning to resist. The long struggle of the textile
workers in Passaic, the Haverhill shoe strike, the battle of the
Colorado miners, the firm and solid front of the needle trades
workers in New York, the strike struggle of the textile workers
in New Bedford and Fall River, and heroic struggle of the
Pennsylvania and Ohio miners, who have already maintained
their fight against the whole world for fourteen months, are the
first powerful signs of the defensive struggle of the working
class. Despite all the sabotage of the misleaders of labor, the
vast masses of unorganized workers are beginning to organize
themselves. The first attempts to organize the automobile

workers have been made. The needle trades workers and the
textile workers are being organized into new unions. The mill
committee movement of the textile workers, the shop chairman
movement of the needle trades, the Save-the-Union movement
of the miners, etc., constitute the basis and means for a con-

 

 

 

24 THE PLATFOMR OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

solidation of fighting unions in these industries and are the most
promising signs of a- militant future.

The Workers (Communist) Party of America considers -
it its duty to mobilize the masses for a.relentles_s struggle ,
against all harmful effects of capitalist rationalization. The _

Workers must understand that rationalization in a capitalist
society, with the means of production in private hands, can only

intensify the exploitation of the workers. Rationalization in i
the interests of the whole of society can be carried out only in j

a Communist society in which the means of production are the
property of the whole nation.

DEMANDS

1. Shorter hours of labor. A 5-day, 40-hour week. A -

minimum of 48 consecutive hours rest in seven days.

2. Fight for high wages. Strike against wage cuts.

3. Fight for the protection of the workers from the bad
effects of capitalist rationalization, of the technical advances of
mass production. Struggle against the speed-up system.

4. Organize the unorganized. Organize new unions‘ in i

the unorganized industries. The American working class can-

not successfully resist the power of the trusts rwithout building -

up a powerful organization of the workers in the basic industries.
_ 5. Destroy company unions. Abolish the B. and O. and
Mitten plans. Eradicate trade-union capitalism.

6. Save the unions from the onslaught of the bosses and ~

the treachery of the bureaucrats. Amalgamation of craft unions

into industrial unions. Democratization of the trade unions.

The present corrupt leadership must be driven out.

_ 7. Trade-union methods alone cannot wage a successful
fight. Trade-union struggle must be supplemented by political
struggle. _

IV. THE HEROIC STRUGGLE OF THE MINERS

There has never been a more heroic struggle than the
-present strike of the hundreds of thousands of miners. They
are fighting against the whole capitalist world.- They are not
only up against the coal operators, who are in close alliance with

 

 

(‘D

 

rn'.3:3'~<:

D"F+‘< ?b

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 2')‘

_the big railroad companies and banks and are backed by the

government, but are also betrayed by their own leaders.

There is a deep-going crisis in the mining industry. The
industry is unorganized. Production is in a chaotic state. Each
of the 7,000 coal companies produces as much as it can. There
is a murderous competition for markets. The mines are able
to produce twice as much coal today as industry and consumers
can absorb. The operators are closing down mine after mine,
creating heavy unemployment. At the same time, new labor-
saving machinery is being introduced, aggravating the unem-
ployment situation everywhere. The miners are being forced
to increase their daily output by speed-up and longer working
hours, thus making themselves in growing numbers superfluous.
The operators say that the industry is faced with the problem:
either it must get rid of its superfluous coal or its superfluous
miners. They are driving out 250,000 miners from the industry.

The government has exposed itself frankly as the instru-
ment of the operators in the present struggle. It has mobilized
everything against the miners. Courts, injunctions, the national
guard, state constabulary, judges and sheriffs are at the service
of the operators. Every miner must now clearly see that the
government is but the organization of the bosses. The operators
themselves sit in the government. The Secretary of the Treas-
ury, Mellon, a member of President Coolidge’s cabinet, is one
of the biggest shareholders of the most unscrupulous Pittsburgh
Coal Company. The governor of Pennsylvania, Fisher, was
a member of the Board of Directors of the Clearfield Coal
Company. The officials of the government are either the
bosses themselves or their paid agents. In the company towns
the coal operators exercise directly State power in the form of
coal and iron police and company gunmen. The coal operators
there own everything————land, streets, buildings, stores. The local
judges and sheriffs are paid by the operators, as has been proved
by the Senate Investigating Committee. The Senate Investigat-
ing Committee itself is nothing but a smoke screen to deceive
the workers, to create illusions in the minds of the miners.
The miners have no constitutional rights in the "freest" country
in the world. And there cannot be any real democracy and

    

 

26 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

freedom in a society in which the few own everything and the
masses do not own anything.

The scores of thousands of Pennsylvania and Ohio miners
are engaged in a bitter, desperate strike struggle for higher
wages, better conditions, and the right to organize. But to win
their struggle—which will require a whole series of battles
against the employers, the Government, and the Lewis bureau-
cracy, and which will be directed against the deadly effects of
the rationalization drive of the capitalists and for higher wages
and union conditions--they must completely defeat the Lewis
bureaucracy and build up a new militant union in the mining
industry. The Lewis machine is nothing but the agent of the
bosses in the union. It sold out the struggle of the miners to the
operators and to the government. The Lewis machine does not
Want to Win the strike. Its Whole history is but an uninterrupt-
ed betrayal of all the fights of the miners. It betrayed the
miners in 1919, in 1922, in 1925, and it has betrayed them in
the most shameless way in the present struggle.

District after district was lost for the United Mine Work-
ers under the leadership of the Lewis machine. In 1919 the
miners’ strike tied up 70 per cent of production; the present
strike only 20 per cent. Lewis and the operators have brok-
en up the U. M. W. A. The Lewis machine criminally neg-
lected the necessary preparations for the strike. It sabotaged
the organization of the unorganized. It has signed up in-
dividual agreements. It has betrayed the cause of a national
agreement. It has split the movement by ousting everybody
from the union who Wants a militant struggle. It is cutting
off relief from every striking miner who dares to criticize it.
It is trying to enforce a yellow dog pledge of starvation. The
last vestiges of democracy have been eradicated from the
union. Lewis stole the elections. The Lewis machine is not
a leadership set up by the rank and file, but a leadership set up
with the aid of the bosses over the rmzh and file. From June
to December, 1927, while the striking miners were starving on
a dollar or two a week relief, Lewis drew $11,093.66 in salary
and personal expenses.

The mining industry is in a crisis. The issue is: Who
shall pay the expenses of the crisis? Shall it be solved at the

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 2'7

cost of the operators or of the miners? The miners, and with
them the whole labor movement, must multiply their efforts
to combat the onslaught of the operators. The defeat of the
miners would be a defeat for the whole labor movement.

DEMANDS

1. Lewis and the whole reactionary machine must go.
The rank and file must take over the organization to build a
new militant union in the industry, to organize the unorganized,
to re-establish union conditions, to fight ‘for a national agreement.

2. The unorganized miners must be organized. The big
organization drive must be intensified and speeded up.

3. Support the Pennsylvania and! Ohio strike. Fight
against wage cuts and for the Jacksonville scale. Mass picket-
ing and mass violation of injunctions against the workers. Mass
resistance to evictions.

4. It is the duty of the whole labor movement to organize
relief for the starving and struggling miners.

5. Railroad workers, don’t haul scab coal!

V. COLONIES AND IMPERIALIST WAR

Increasing rivalry with the other imperialist powers and
brutal exploitation of the economically weaker, more backward
peoples—these two features characterize the foreign policy of
United States imperialism at present.

Wall Street’s dollars and marines are extending their dom-
ination over ever greater sections of the world. VVherever there
is a revolutionary upheaval United States imperialism is on hand
and ready to crush it. United States imperialism is in a con-
spiracy with Great Britain against the Russian revolution. It
cooperates with Japan and England in the interventions against
China. United States imperialism supported Great Britain in
her infamous Nanhing policies, and it now supports Japan in
her ruthless intervention in Shantung. All talk about the United
States as the “friend of China” is mere babble in view of the
fact that America supports Japan’s domination over Manchuria
in order to protect her own vast financial investments there.

Japanese intervention in China today promotes the striving of
the United States for financial hegemony in the Far ‘East.
American-British-Japanese cooperation in the dismemberrnent
of China includes at the same time growing possibilities of a
clash between the rival interests of these three leading im-
perialist powers on the Pacific. United States warships and
thousands of marines are “pacifying” China, and Washington
admits that Admiral Bristol is empowered to call out the whole
Pacific fleet against China if United States imperialist policy
requires it. The conquest of the tremendous Chinese market
is in a growing degree one of the foremost aims of United States
imperialism. United States imperialism goes hand in hand
with Japanese imperialism in Shantung against the armies of
Chiang Kai-Shek, but at the same time its representative, Ad-
miral Bristol, cooperates with Chiang Kai-Shek in crushing
Soviet Canton, suppressing all revolutionary movements of the
Chinese workers and peasants.

The military dictatorship of United States imperialism is
exercised more ruthlessly than ever before over the Philippines,
Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone and the Virgin
Islands. Cuba, Haiti, Panama and Liberia are today reduced
to Vassal states of United States imperialism. The independence
of all the Caribbean and Central American republics has become
nothing more than a tragic farce in view of their increased
bondage to Wall Street. The Havana Conference, which was
called in the name of Pan-Americanism, was only the instru-
ment of United States imperialism. The Monroe Doctrine,
which once served as a defense against European powers, is
today the most aggressive means to conquer all America for
the United States. The pressure of Wall Street forced Mexico
to surrender her oil and land resources to dollar imperialism.
The appointment of Morrow, the employee of Morgan, as
United States Ambassador to Mexico exposes the whole Latin-
American policy of the United States as the policy of finance
capital and big business. The fake “good will” flights of Col-
onel Lindbergh tried to exploit the sentimental illusions of the
North American masses for the conquest of Latin America.
Large parts of Central and South America have already been
reduced to a state of semi-colonies of United States imperialism,

and Wall Street and its White House agency are trying to
transform them into true colonies.

The most disgraceful action of United States imperialism
is its robber war against Nicaragua. President Coolidge dis-
closed in his speech of the 10th of January, 1927, the true mean-
ing of the Nicaraguan War: "I f the revolution in Nicaragua con-
tinues, American investments and business interests will be in
danger.” The infamous, bloody crusade against Nicaragua is
as naked an imperialist profit-war as any ever conducted.

United States imperialism cooperates with British imperial-
ism against China, against Soviet Russia, against Nicaragua;
but at the same time there is a murderous competition and in-
creasing imperialist rivalry between the two robber powers.
There is hardly any part of the world in which there is no open
or covert struggle between British and American imperialism.
United States imperialism is breaking up the British Empire by
catering to Canada and Australia. United States imperialism
has successfully challenged Great Britain’s financial hegemony.
There is a permanent rubber struggle and oil war going on be-
tween America and Great Britain. The fiasco of the Three-
Power Naval Limitation Conference in Geneva and the Amer-
ican slogan for a “second to none” navy show the irreconcilable
nature of this imperialist antagonism. The present cooperation
of the United States Government with Japan in China has in
it the germs of future conflicts on the Pacific.

The recent “peace offensive” of Secretary of State Kellogg
under the slogan to “outlaw war” is nothing but an imperialist
maneuver to counteract the genuine struggles for peace of the
Soviet Union. United States imperialism aims through the
Kellogg treaty to diminish the power of the League of Nations,
Which is the organization of the European big powers, and tries
to render futile any attempt of the European powers to build
a bloc against United States imperialism. At the same time the
Kellogg treaty tries to unite all the capitalist powers, not under
the leadership of the League of Nations, but under the leader-
ship of United States imperialism against the Soviet Union.
Despite all empty talk about “outlawing” war, imperialist an-
tagonisms are steadily growing, and there is increasing resistance
against the aggressive imperialist policies of the United States.

    

 

30 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS .STRUGGLE

The growing competition with Europe, the organization of
European trusts and cartels, the tariff issues with Germany
Great Britain‘ and France, the questions of the War debts an
the Dawes Plan, the domination over the Pacific, the growing
revolt of the Latin-American countries——all these conflicts are
pregnant with future imperialistic wars.

The whole policy of United States imperialism is today a

policy of preparedness for imperialist wars. The entire country
is bristling with bayonets. The United States has never before
had such a big army and navy. No other country in the world
has spent as much for its navy as this country. In 1926-27
Japan spent $119,000,000, the British Empire $299,000,000 and
the United States $334,000,000 for navy purposes. In 1928 the
appropriation for the United States navy has already reached
$363,000,000 and for the army $394,000,000, totalling $757,
000,000. In his last message to Congress President Coolidge
came out openly for the big navy program. On December 14-,
1927, the big navy program was introduced in the House of
Representatives, appropriating not less than $725,000,000. Fed-
eral government expenses for past and future wars amounted
to 82 cents out of every dollar spent in 1927. It is estimated
that in 1928 Congress will directly or indirectly vote about two
billion dollars for military purposes on land and sea and in the
air.

United States imperialism is making the most elaborate
preparations for war. The workers and working farmers must
know that wars under capitalism are inevitable. “Small” Wars
are going on all the time, even today, and the next big imperial-
ist world war is already looming up. The next world war Will
be even more devastating than the first one. The whole life
of the entire country will be subordinated -to war purposes. The
whole population will be mobilized. The whole country will
be turned into a huge munition factory. The phrase about
“outlawing war,” the promise about preventing war by arbi-
tration, and the babbling of the Socialist Party about demo-

cratizing the League of Nations of the European robber pow-
ers are only designed for one purpose——to distract the at-
tention of the masses from the war danger, from the real re-
volutionary struggle against imperialistic wars. Disarmament

VI. DEFENSE OF THE SOVIET UNION

The whole world is under capitalist domination. The
Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union is the sole country in
which there is a Workers’ and Farmers’ Government.

The very existence of the Soviet Union is the best proof
that it is possible to overthrow capitalism and emancipate the
working class. The example of Soviet Russia shows that so-
cialism is not a dream. It is a fact——and a fact that looms big
in the history of mankind-——that under the leadership of the
Russian workers, a nation of 150 million, not less than one-sixth
of the earth, has been able to free itself from the yoke of cap-
italism and establish a workers’ republic which has maintained
power for over ten years in spite of all the capitalists of the
world.

The capitalist countries are carrying out a ruthless ration-
alization at the expense of the workers. Only the Soviet Union
is carrying out a socialist rationalization for the beneﬁt of the
nation as a whole. The proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet
Union expropriated the capitalists and big landowners. The
workers control the industries. The working farmers received
the ‘land of the big landowners. Soviet Russia is building so-
cialism now, and is taking the first steps toward a higher, a col-
lective type of agriculture. There is the most complete system
of labor protection and social insurance in Soviet Russia. One
of the first steps of the proletarian revolution was the introduc-
tion of the 8-hour day, and at the tenth anniversary of the ex-
istence of the Soviet Republic the Soviet Government established
the 7-hour day. While the courts and the government of this
country are smashing the unions in the name of the Constitution,
the Code of Labor Laws, Paragraph 155, of the Soviet Union
runs:

“In accordance with Statute 16 of the Constitution of the
Soviet Union, all organs of the State must render to the indus-
trial unions and their organizations every assistance, place at
their disposal fully equipped premises to be used as Palaces of
Labor and trade-union halls; charge reduced rates for public
services, such as posts, telegraphs, telephones, railroad and
shipping rates, etc.”

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 33

There is a sinister conspiracy of all capitalist powers against
the Socialist Soviet Union. Great Britain is the leader of the
imperialist coalition, but the United States Government is ac-
tively participating in it. The United States Government re-
fuses to recognize the Soviet Government, to recognize the very
existence of one of the most powerful countries in the world,
for the sole reason that the workers and not the capitalists run
that country. The United States Government and its officials
seize upon every opportunity to fight the Soviet Union. Am-
bassador Herrick’s shameful statements in Paris, the American
loans to finance the anti-Soviet policies of Poland and Finland,
and the rejection of the gold bullion sent to the United States

are convincing proofs of the hostile policy of United States im-

perialism toward Soviet Russia.

The Soviet Union is the only power which has reduced its
military forces. It made the historic offer at the last interna-
tional conference at Geneva for an immediate and complete
disarmament of all countries. The capitalist governments re-
fused to accept the proposal of the Soviet Union, because the
very nature of capitalism is aggression, oppression, and War.
All capitalist armies are deadly enemies of the working class,
but the Red Army of workers and peasants of the Soviet Union
is the defender of the working class of the whole world. The
solidarity of the working class of all countries must be with the
only Workers’ Republic in the world.

DEMANDS

1. Defend the Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, the
champion of the cause of the working class of all countries,
against the conspiracies of the capitalist powers.

2. Immediate recognition of the Soviet Government by
the United States Government.

3. Promotion of trade with the Union of Socialist Soviet
Republics by the granting of sufficient credits by the Federal
Government, as a means of stimulating American industry and
absorbing the unemployed.

4-. Establishment of direct connections between the Amer-
ican and Russian working class.

VII. CAPITALIST DEMOCRACY AND THE
GOVERNMENT -STRIKEBREAKER

Many workers foster illusions as to the possibility of achiev-
ing their emancipation from the oppression and exploitation of
capitalism through the election of a majority of the members
of the legislative bodies and executive officials of the capitalist
government. The American Federation of Labor and the
Socialist Party help to maintain these dangerous and futile il-
lusions. The national platform of the Socialist Party states:
"By intelligent use of the ballot, aided if need be by industrial
action, all class -divisions and class rule can be abolished.” It is
one of the foremost duties of the Communists to destroy such
illusions and to expose all those yellow Socialist rnisleaders of the
workers who help to create these illusions.

The present government is a government of the capitalists.
It cannot be transformed into a government of the working
class, and its sole purpose is to defend the interests of private
property and oppress the workers, working farmers, the Negro
masses, and the colonial peoples.

The Constitution of the United States was drawn up by
the bankers, big landowners, and rich merchants of 1787, ad-
mittedly against the working masses. As Madison, the “Father
of the Constitution,” put it, the Government ought "to protect
the minority of the opulent against the majority.” It is an illu-
sion to think that the majority of the people of the United
States can changethe Constitution. The vote of two-thirds of
the members of the legislative bodies of three-fourths of the
forty-eight States is required to initiate any movement for an
amendment. On this basis one—fourth of the States, which may
be the smallest ones and in which there may live only one-four-
teenth of the population, can prevent any change of the so-
called “democratic” Constitution.

The Constitution contains a whole series of notorious
"checks and balances” for the sole purpose of mahing it impos-
sible for a "majority antagonistic to the ruling class to make its
will effective. The members of the House of Representatives
are elected every two years, the President every four years, and
the members of the Senate every six years, so that a complete
change of Government can be made only through elections

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 3'5

spread over six years. The elections are not at the same time,
because the Fathers of the Constitution wanted to give a chance
for the “cooling off” of any mass discontent which might ex-
press itself in the elections. The Senate has a Veto over the
decisions of the House. A special joker of the Constitution is
that a newly elected Congress cannot oorne into session until
thirteen months after its election, thus giving a chance to the
repudiated Congress to intrench its will by new legislation.
The President can veto the actions of both houses of Congress,
and over and above the House, the Senate, and the President
stands the Supreme Court, which can nullify laws which all
three have passed, declaring these laws unconstitutional.

Only a minority of the people entitled to vote participate
in the elections, and large sections of the population of voting
age are disfranchised. In the South the 5.7 million Negroes
of voting age are today as much disfranchised as in the darkest
days of chattel slavery. The 6.3 million foreign-born unnatural-
ized workers of voting age are disfranchised because they are
“aliens.” The disfranchised Negroes and foreign-born workers
together constitute almost 20 per cent of the population of voting
age. The youth between the ages of 18 and 21 is entirely dis-
franchised. The hundreds of thousands of migratory Workers,
who cannot comply with the residential qualifications, are like-
wise robbed of their elementary political rights.

The two-party system, which in the South is in reality only
a one—party system, is also one of the props of American democ-
racy, preventing the splitting—off of the bulk of the working
class and working farmers from the parties of big business.

S Elections are very expensive in this country. Campaign
funds are huge; they run into millions, and big business is able
to buy as many and as high offices as it likes. On the other
hand, working-class parties, which rely only on the support of
the exploited workers and farmers, are poor and are not able
to compete with the rich capitalist parties.

Big business controls thousands of newspapers. Thirty mil-
lion copies of poisonous capitalist propaganda every day fill the
minds of the masses. Big business has a monopoly of the schools,
churches, moving picture theatres, radio, and the whole ma-

chinery of propaganda and agitation.

 

    

 

36 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

And when, despite all obstacles and barriers, some repre-
sentatives elected by the votes of the working class get into the
legislative bodies,’ big business prevents their functioning by
simply kicking them out. This was done in the case of the
Socialist members of the Cleveland City Council because they
protested against the imperialist war. The same procedure was
repeated in the case of the Socialist Assemblymen of New York
State.

Under such circumstances to prate about “democracy” is
hypocrisy and conscious betrayal of the working class. The
present big business democracy of the United States is in reality
nothing but a dictatorship of the capitalists. The 1928 election
platform of the Socialist Party, which accepts the present Con-
stitution as a basis and demands only a “modernized Constitu-
tion,” is thereby accepting the present capitalist State and the
perpetuation of the oppression of the working class.

And if there is anything big business is unable to push
through by “constitutional” means, it does it unscrupulously by
unconstitutional means. Corruption is inseparable from capital-
ist government. There are very few countries in the World
which show such a clear picture of governmental corruption.
The Teapot Dome scandal, the Sinclair-Burns affair, the open
purchases of elections by Vare and Smith, the Fall-Doheny
affair, the dirty deals_of Daugherty and the other members of
the Harding-Coolidge cabinet, and the campaign funds of the
Republican Hoover and the Democrat Al Smith are but a few
examples of the venality of leading politicians. And if any of
them are caught, there are still judges and fixed juries to save
them. Few rich men are convicted in this country.

Democracy, corruption, and naked force and -violence are
the chief methods of capitalist dictatorship. Government by in-
junction, raids and deportations, penitentiaries for political
prisoners, troops crushing strikes, frame-ups and lynchings—
these are the realities of the unwritten Constitution. Today
what George Washington, the first President of the United
States, said is more true. than ever before: “Government is not
reason; it is not e1oquence—it is force.”

With imperialism the Government has grown into a mam-

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 3'7

moth monster of centralization. The country has never had
such a huge governmental apparatus. In 1884 the number of
Federal civil service employees was only 13,780; by 1912 it had
mounted to 278,000; while today the figure (exclusive of army
and navy forces) is not less than 559,138. The number of Gov-
ernment employees—Federal, State and local—in the Whole
country today mounts up to a total of three million. This gigan-
tic apparatus of bureaucracy is entirely in the hands of the capi-
talists. There is a complete merger of trustified capital and gov-
ernment. The leaders of big business—Hoover, the efficiency
expert; Mellon, one of the richest men in the country; Dawes,
the banker; Morrow, the errand boy of Morgan; Hughes, of
Standard Oil; Coolidge, the strikebreaker; Fall and Daugherty,
the kept men of the oil magnates—have or had seats in the
Government. Governmental power is being concentrated more
and more in the hands of the executive and judicial departments
at the expense of the elected legislative bodies. The President,
above all, has assumed almost unlimited power. He has control
over appropriations of funds, over tariff, runs the foreign policy
of the country, and decides questions of war and peace. The
actual constitutional form of the "freest” democracy in the
world is today that of an unconstitutional monarchy.

The Working class in its struggle for emancipation cannot
reform or “take over” the present apparatus of government.
The proletarian revolution will destroy this apparatus, and will
build its own based on the factories as units of production and
not on territorial congressional districts. The State form of the
rule of the Working class will be the councils of the workers,
which will serve not as “talking shops” but as Working bodies
uniting legislative and executive power. This Soviet form of
government constitutes the only real democracy for the over-
whelming majority of the people, for the toiling masses.

DEMANDS

1. Abrogation of government by injunction.

2. Prohibition of the use of guards, gunmen, deputy
sheriffs, militia or Federal troops in labor struggles.

3. Unrestricted right to organize, to strike, and to picket.
Unrestricted right of ‘free speech, free press, and free assem-
blage for the Working class.

VIII. A LABOR PARTY

There are many strikes and labor struggles in this country,
but there is no political mass party of the working class in the
, ; United States which can today rally millions of wage-earners.
 y I. America is the only highly developed industrial country in the
World in which the bulk of the working class is not yet politically
independent.

It is a most vital necessity that the masses of Workers should
understand that the economic struggle must be supplemented
by political struggle. Without economic fights, without build-
ing unions and conducting strikes, the Workers would be unable
to improve their living conditions, hours, and Wages. But no
permanent gain can be achieved by the weapon of a mere econ-
omic struggle. The most powerful trade union can be paralyzed
by the almighty Government of the ‘bosses, by its troops and
injunctions. The workers may even be robbed of the results
of a successful strike, because the increasing cost of living can
nullify higher Wages.

Mere economic struggle cannot free the workers from ex-
ploitation and oppression. Political struggle is also necessary.
But it must be political struggle in the interests of the working
class and carried on by political organizations of the working

 

 

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 39

class. Many workers participate in political struggles but on
the side of the bosses. Today the bulk of the Workers—even
those who economically, in their trade unions, by their strikes,
fight the bosses—support the political parties of the same bosses,
the Republican and Democratic parties. This is a fatal mistake,
because it means that the workers themselves help the capital-
ists to hold their grip on the State power. Those workers who
still remain in the camps of the Republican and Democratic
parties are helping the capitalists to be the bosses of the courts,
to use injunctions and armed forces to crush the trade unions
and to paralyze the strike movements of the workers.

The workers have made several attempts to link up their
trade unions and other labor organizations into a Labor Party.
In certain places Farmer Labor parties are now in existence.
The Workers (Communist) Party supports the formation of
those labor parties which are based on trade unions and other
organizations of the working class. It is willing to participate
in the formation of such labor parties, because it considers this
the first decisive step toward independent political action by
the working class, the first step of the workers to break away
from the parties of the bosses. At the same time the Communist
Party considers it its duty to tell the workers frankly that a
Labor Party has its limitations and that it will not be able to
lead the workers in their final struggle for their emancipation.
Only a Communist Party can do that. Only under the leader-
ship of the Communist Party can the American working class
emancipate itself from the double yoke of capitalist exploitation
and oppression.

It is to the interest of the workers to participate in all
election struggles. It is necessary to fight for the election of
worhers to the various legislative bodies. It is necessary to run
workers’ candidates for offices. But it is a dangerous illusion
to thinh that the workers can assume power by electing more
and more members of Congress or executive officials. The
workers can never seize power by the mere means of the ballot.
Only by revolution can the working class swing into power.
The most important aim of participation in election campaigns
is the mobilization of the working masses for the struggle
against the bosses and for the political organization of the work-

 

40 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

ing class in preparation for the struggle for power. The chief
usefulness of representatives in legislative bodies consists in se-
curing a public tribune for the cause of the working class,
from whence it is possible to expose the actions of the bosses
and arouse the militancy of the masses. The Workers must
know that political struggle is much broader than mere election
struggle. They must know that political struggle is in the in-
terests of the working class only if it is conducted in the form
of a politically independent working-class party. The notorious
"non-partisan” policy of the A. F. of L., which calls upon the
workers “to reward their friends and punish their enemies”
within the capitalist parties, amounts in fact to unqualified
support of the capitalist parties and capitalism itself. The policy
of the Socialist Party, which promises the workers that they
can assume power, abolish classes, and control the industries by
the “intelligent use of the ballot” is an equally base betrayal
of the working class. The I. W. W ., which restricts itself to
mere “industrial action” because it is afraid that through pol-
itical activities it will lose its revolutionary integrity, has actual-
ly become a sectarian and reactionary organization.

DEMANDS

1. Independent political action of the working class. Form-
ation of a Labor Party on a national, state and local scale
and an alliance between the Labor Party and the exploited
farmers for a common political struggle against capitalism.

2. A genuine Labor Party must be based on trade unions
and other labor organizations, and on factory, mill, and mine
committees of the unorganized workers. A genuine Labor
Party must exclude all politicians of big and small business,
and must include as a true federated body all sections of the
working class, without any discrimination, which accept the
general principle of the class struggle and are willing to fight
for the interests of the workers and exploited farmers.

3. We call upon every worker: Affiliate your trade union
to the Labor Party and you yourself join the Workers (Com-
munist) Party. ,

IX. SOCIAL LEGISLATION

There is hardly any labor protection and even less social
insurance in this country. The aim of labor protection is the
safeguarding of the workers from the harmful conditions of
production. The aim of the United States government today
is the safeguarding of the capitalists from the “harmful” ef-
fects of trade-union organization. There is no law setting a
maximum to the working day or against overtime. No law
guarantees a Weekly rest for the workers. No legal yearly
holiday is assured the wage-earners; Very few compulsory
rules exist or are enforced for safety and sanitation. Labor
inspection is ineffective. - T

America is the leading country of the world in the field of
industrial accidents. In industry there occur annually 25,000
fatal accidents and 2V2 million accidents causing temporary
disability. In 1927 there were no less than 2,224 fatalities on
the mining field‘ of battle. New York State alone had in
1926-27 in structural iron work not less than 21,606 accident
cases which required compensation. In the metal mines there
were 2,865 accidents per 10,000 workers. In other words, one
Worker out of every four Was the victim of an accident.

There is no social insurance deserving the name in the
United States. N 0 care is taken of the unemployed, of the sick,
of the old, of invalids and cripples. N 0 help is given to families
of deceased workers. The A. F. of L., with its narrow craft
attitude against any social legislation, and the Socialist Party,
with its parliamentary idiocy, share with the capitalists the re-
sponsibility for this complete lack of social legislation. The
workers must understand that social legislation can be brought
about only as a by-product of revolutionaryvstruggle.

As substitutes for social legislation there are only the
voluntary organizations of fraternal societies. Some of the trade
unions try to build up some insurance schemes. All these small-
scale organizations are very limited in their effect and mean
an additional burden for the workers. The group insurance
of the employers means the enslavement of the workers to a
certain corporation. The private insurance companies are
fleecing the working masses. There is a general lack of security
in the life of the working class of America. No worker grows

 

42 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

old as fast as the American worker. Speed-up and lack of
labor protection drive him to premature old age. Scores of
poisons, extreme heat and dampness and dust, and lack of
sanitary measures ruin the health of the toilers.

The lack of labor protection and social insurance in the
United States, in the richest capitalist country in the world,
is brought out in bold relief by comparison with the W or/Ems’
Republic of the, Soviet Union. The Socialist Republic of Soviet
Russia has the most complete system of labor protection and
social insurance. Her social insurance provides the following
benefits: temporary disability benefits; benefits for child-birth,
infant nursing, burial of insured persons and members of their
families; pensions for widows; permanent disability benefits;
pensions to family in event of bread-winner’s death; unem-
ployed benefits; maintenance of rest homes, sanatoria, and
health resorts for workers; free medical aid.

In Soviet Russia all forms of social insurance are under the
management of the Workers and are maintained at the expense
of the State. Factory inspection and all State protection of
labor organs are under the direct control of the trade unions.
Compulsory yearly vacations on pay are assured. The 7-hour
day is guaranteed by law. The law forbids systematic overtime.
There is a legal Weekly rest of 42 hours. Special protection of
Women and children in industry has been enacted. A large
range of sanitation and safety measures in all factories has been
instituted.

There is a World of difference between the lack of labor
protection and social insurance in the United States of America
and the complete system of labor protection and social insur-
ance in the United States of Socialist Russia—the difference
between a capitalist and a socialist country.

DEMANDS

1. Federal law for social insurance in the case of sickness,
accident, old age, and unemployment for all Wage-earners. The
administration of all social insurance measures should be in the
hands of the workers. The expenses should be covered by the
State and the employers.

2. Federal law for the enactment of the 40-hour, 5-day

iate enactment of a federal law providing for 48 consecutive
hours of Weekly rest for all Wage-earners.

3. Federal law for compulsory rules and technical meas-
ures for safety and sanitation.

4-. Establishment of effective labor inspection; inspectors

5. Free medical treatment, medicine, and hospital care

X. TARIFF AND TAXATION

The propaganda agencies of the bosses are spreading the
fallacy that the workers do not pay taxes. In reality the work-
ers and working farmers are the classes of society which hear
the burden of the bulk of all taxation.

Direct and indirect taxation and tariff revenues Weigh
down upon the shoulders of the Working masses. Taxes are
the basis of public expenditures. Public expenditures, how-
ever, are nothing but the cost of maintenance of the state ap-
paratus of big business. The collection of taxes from the masses
is a method by which the exploited are forced to pay the ex-
penses for the upkeep of the system of exploitation and op-
pression.

Both parties of big business have been vying with each
other for years to lighten as much as possible the burden of
taxation for the big capitalists, transferring the burden of tax-
ation to the backs of the Workers and exploited farmers. The
various tax-reduction plans of the government have had only
one single aim: to cut the taxes of the rich and to cut even
more the taxes of the richest. Secretary of the Treasury Mel-
lon, who himself is one of the richest men in the country, is
brazenly following the policy of cutting down the super-tax on
high incomes, and declares that he is against tax exemption of
low incomes, on the ground that the payment of taxes creates
for people With low incomes “a sense of part ownership in the
government.” The most outrageous privileges are enjoyed by
the parasitic owners of federal, state and municipal securities.

 

44 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

This rentier class, which is completely divorced from the pro-
cess of production and whose only connection with industry is
coupon-clipping, owns today no less than 16 billion dollars of
such securities, which are wholly exempt from all taxation.

The most vicious form of indirect taxation is the tariff.
The tariff raises the cost of living for the working class, and
increases the price of industrial goods bought by the farmers.
The United Stateshas the highest tariffs in the world, despite
the fact that the industries of this country are the most highly
developed and enjoy the strongest position.

Trust monopoly and tariff go together in the United
States. The chief function of tariff is to secure unlimited mon-
opoly to the trusts. The tariff helps to exclude foreign com-
petition. It makes it possible for the trusts to raise the prices
of their products to the buyers of this country by an amount
nearly equal to that of the tariff. At the same time it makes it
possible for the trusts to sell their goods below cost price in
foreign countries, thanks to the surplus profits they make in
this country.

Trust monop-oly and high tariff are the most dangerous
factors working for new imperialist wars. The larger the ter-
ritory “protected” by tariff, the greater the amount of super-
profit. The trust monopolies, therefore, have a tendency to
expand the territory of the United States, to occupy new re-
gions. That can be done only by conquest, through threat of
War, and war.

The high tariff Wall around this country forces the other
countries likewise to “protect" themselves by tariff walls. This
hinders or even prevents the export of American products to
other countries. But accumulation of capital is going on with
increasing speed, and American big business, instead of export-
ing goods, is exporting capital on an ever greater scale. The
next step is the “defense” of. the investments of American
bankers in foreign countries. A strong army and a “second to
none” navy are necessary. War threats, war danger, and wars
are the order of the day. The "protective," "defensi-ve” tariff
is in reality the most offensive weapon in the hands of big busi-
ness.

The tariff policy of both parties of big business exposes the

 

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 45‘

emptiness of their so-called struggle against each other.
The Republican Party was originally the party of
tariff, because it represented the growing manufacturing in-
terests of the North. The Democratic Party was originally
the party against tariff, because it expressed the interests of
the large plantation owners of the South. But with the change
in economic conditions both parties are altering their positions
on tariff. The industrialization of the South has created a
powerful capitalist section in that part of the country, too, and
caused a portion of the Democrats to come out as advocates of
high tariff. On the other hand, the international bankers of

the N orth—Who have invested billions in Europe and are afraid-

:that Europe Will not be able to pay her debts, if she cannot ex-
port industrial products to this country¥—are now in favor of
the lowering or abolition of the tariff and are making their
influence felt more and more in the high councils of the Re-
publican Party which they dominate.

The interests of the working class are against high tariff.
At the same time it would be an illusion to think that “free
trade” would be a permanent relief for the toiling masses. Free
trade under capitalist conditions is as much a capitalist institu-
tion as high tariff. .

DEMANDS

1. Abolition of all indirect taxes.

2. Exemption from all kinds of taxation for all wage-
earners.

3. Tax-exemption for all working and exploited farmers.

4. Graduated income tax, starting with incomes above
$5,000 and increasing gradually, so that all incomes over
$25,000 per year are confiscated.

5. All tax exemptions on bonds, stocks and securities
must be abolished. .

6. Graduated inheritance and gift taxes on great fortunes
must be introduced. T

7. Tariff on all necessities of the working class and on all
goods used by the farmers must be abolished.

XI. THE PLIGHT OF THE FARMERS

For two decades the conditions of the farmers have been
growing steadily worse. The working farmer is becoming
poorer and poorer. Millions have been driven away from their
farms. Other millions are bankrupt and are only nominally own-
ers of their farms. Tenancy is growing. The standard of living
for the farmer and his family is becoming lower and lower.
Hardships, suﬂering and poverty are features of the life of the
working farmer.

The worhing farmer is today in an increasing measure only
nominally the owner of the land. The mortgages and other
debts are an unbearable burden on the exploited farmer. The
product of his labor no longer belongs to him but to his cred-
itors. The total amount of debts of the farmers (mortgage,
personal and commercial) is the stupendous sum of 15 billion
dollars, which at 6 per cent means an annual tribute of 900
million dollars to the bankers, merchants and other leeches of
capitalism. The number of exploiting absentee owners is stead-
ily increasing. In 1880 tenant farmers were 25.6 per cent of
all farmers; in 1925 they were 38.6 per cent. Farmers
are forced into bankruptcy by hundreds of thousands. In the
Middle West between 1920 and 1923 no less than 22.5 per
cent of all farm owners and 35 per cent of all tenants lost their
farms by bankruptcy, by foreclosure, or retained them only—-
as the Government expresses it—by the “leniency” of their
creditors.

At least 40 per cent of the whole agricultural population,
4.2 million people, are neither owners nor tenant farmers but
simply agricultural workers, who own nothing but their labor
power. The agricultural workers have the lowest standard of
living, are forced to work the longest working day and under
the worst conditions in theiwhole country. Their wages are
actually decreasing. The introduction of new machinery is re-
placing them by tens of thousands. They are unorganized,
isolated, and completely at the mercy of their employers and
the State‘ power. The agricultural workers are part of the
American working class and must be embraced by its economic
and political organizations in the struggle against capitalism.

The working farmers are in the most disastrous condition,

 

 

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 47

because they are up against trust monopoly. The farmers are
forced to pay the highest percentage of taxation. The taxes
of the farmers have been increased in a most alarming fashion.
They amounted in 1913 to $624,000,000; today to $1,436,-
000,000. The general property tax is directed chiefly against
the farmer rather than against other property owners. The
local taxes increase the burden of the working farmer to an
intolerable degree. Even Secretary of Agriculture Jardine was
forced to admit that the farmers spend not less than 30 per cent
of their net income for taxes.

Mechanization of agriculture is another reason for the ruin

of the farmers. The number of tractors, which in 1920 was ,

229,000, by 1925 had grown to 506,000, and in 1927 amounted
to 700,000. The use of combines is spreading, each of them
displacing three harvest hands. The poor farmer is too poor
to buy expensive machinery. His farm is too small to utilize
machinery to its full extent.

Industry is trustified and by virtue of its monopoly is able
to control the prices of machinery and all the other goods the
farmer must buy. At the same time big business is able to
dictate the prices of all products the farmer must sell. There is
a whole series of special forms of exploitation to which the
farmer is subjected. He is at the mercy of the powerful capital-
ist agencies of distribution of farm products, the railroads, meat
packers, milk trusts, huge elevator combines, gamblers and cot-
ton brokers, banks, and the government farm credit system.

The basic reason for the banéruptcy of the working farmers
is trust monopoly, is capitalism.

All agricultural credit is in the hands of the banks. The
cooperative organizations of the farmers are chained to capital-
ism by means of credit. Tariff, which is supposed to “protect”
not only industrial products but agricultural products as well,
operates only in the interests of the big trusts. All the promises
of the Republican and Democratic parties have amounted only
to betrayal of the farmers, and have only been in the interests
of the bigger landowners and farm banks.

The big lesson the worhing and exploited farmers must
learn from their own desperate situation is that they must breah
off their alliance with the bcmhers and other factors of big

business and must form an alliance with the working class. The
fate of the McNary-Haugen “farm relief” bill and the Mc-
Fadden branch banking bill is the best proof of the futility of
any alliance of the farmers with the bankers. The farm bloc
in Congress—which speaks in the name of the working farmers,
but is in fact the expression of the interests of the big land-
owners, farmer—capitalists, and farm bankers—made a bargain
with the representatives of Wall Street to the end that both
bills should pass jointly in Congress. Indeed, both bills passed.
But President Coolidge, as the highest exponent of big business
in the Government, signed only the McFadden banking bill
and vetoed the McNary-Haugen “farm relief” bill. All the
so-called friends of the farmers—banker Dawes, millionaire
Lowde.n, the farm bloc, the “Progressives,” such as LaFollette,
Norris, Shipstead and their ilk—are only enemies of the ex-
ploited farmers in the disguise of friends.

The working and exploited farmers and the industrial
and agricultural workers must fight shoulder to shoulder
against their common enemies: against big business, against the
trusts and against the government of capitalism.

DEMANDS

1. A five-year moratorium on farm mortgage debts, in-
cluding debts on chattels.

2. Protection of the working farmer against monopoly
prices. Essential lowering of the prices of all trust products
which the farmer uses.

XII. OPPRESSION OF THE NEGROES . 
American White imperialism oppresses in the most terrific‘ i. T 
Way the ten million Negroes Who constitute not less than one-- 
tenth of the total population. White capitalist prejudice con- 1
siders the Negroes a “lower race,” the born servants of l
the lofty White masters. The racial caste system is a funda- 4’
mental feature of the social, industrial and political organiza- i
tion of this country. The Communist Party declares that it
considers itself not only the party of the Working class generally
but also the champion of the Negroes as an oppressed race, and
especially the organizer of the Negro Working-class elements.
The Communist Party is the party of the liberation of the Negro
race from all white oppression.

There is a “new Negro” in process of development. The
social composition of the Negro race is changing. Formerly  .-_f§
the Negro was the cotton farmer in the South and domestic .  , ji
help in the North. The industrialization of the South, the
concentration of a new Negro Working-class population in the
big cities of the East and North, and the entrance of the Ne-
groes into the basic industries on a mass scale have changed
5 the whole social composition of the Negro race. The appearance
= of a genuine Negro industrial proletariat creates an organizing
force for the whole Negro race, furnishes a new Working-
class leadership to all Negro race movements, and strengthens
immensely the fighting possibilities for the emancipation of the
race.

The Negro tenant farmers and share-croppers of the South
are still, despite all the pompous phrases about freeing the
slaves, in the status of virtual slavery. They have not the
slightest prospect of ever acquiring possession of the land on
which they work. By means of an usurious credit system they
‘are chained to the plantation owners as securely as chattel slaves.

5'0 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

Peonage and contract labor are the fate of the Negro cotton
farmer. The landowners, Who are at the same time the mer-
chants and the government of the South, rule over the Negroes
with a merciless dictatorship.

There is the most dishonest and disgraceful “gentleman's
agreement" between the two capitalist parties against the poli-
tical rights of the Negroes. The famous Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments of the Constitution amount but to a scrap
of paper. They were never carried out for a moment. The
Supreme Court has upheld State laws which disfranchised the
Negroes. Sheer force prevents the Negro from exercising his
so-called political rights. The Federal Government has never
made any attempt to reduce the representation of those Southern
States which violate the Constitution, as Section Two of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides. The
Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, has sun]: so low that
it has provided for measures to segregate the Negro delegates
in its 1928 Kansas City nominating convention. Lynch law
is the law over the Negroes. The terror of the Ku Klux Klan
is the constitution for the Negroes. They are burned alive
whipped to death, hunted to death with dogs in the name of
White civilization.

There is a general segregation policy against the Negro
race. Separate residential sections; Jim Crow cars; separate
schools for Negro children; exclusion from “white” hotels,
restaurants, theatres and railway waiting rooms; exclusion of
Negroes from iuries which try Negroes. Negro teachers cannot
teach in most white schools. The white masters try to reduce
the Negroes to illiteracy. According to the 1920 census, there
were 4 per cent illiterates among the Whites and 22.9 per cent
among the Negroes. The Southern States spend hardly any
money for the education of Negro children.

In the cotton States the Negro farmers are compelled to
live in miserable shacks under conditions destructive of life
and health. In the cities the Negroes do the unskilled, the
most disagreeable, most hazardous work, and are crowded into
the worst sections of the city. The death rate of the Negroes
is much higher than that of the whites. In 1925 it was 11.8

 

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 5'1

per thousand for the Whites and 18.2 for the Negroes.

The Southern plantation owners and their Government
have tried to keep the Negro farmers and agricultural Workers
in the Southern cotton fields by force. But even their brutal
terror has not been able to check the mighty migration from
these cotton plantations to the indusrial centers of the Northern
and Eastern States. This migration is an “unarmed, Spartacan
uprising” against slavery and oppression by a capitalist and
feudal oligarchy.

The Negro fled from the South, but what has he found in
the N orthi? He has found in the company town: and industrial
cities of the North and East a wage slavery virtually no better
than the contract labor in the South. He has found Crowded,
unsanitary slums. He has exchanged the old segregation for a
new segregation. He is doing the most dangerous, worst paid
Work in the steel, coal and packing industries. He has found
the racial prejudices of a narrow, white labor aristocracy, which
refuses to recognize the unskilled Negro worker as its equal.
He has found the treachery of the bureaucracy of the A. F. of
L. which refuse: to organize the Negroes into trade unions.
The lynchings of the South are replaced by the race riots of

the East. The employing class deliberately arouses the racial
hatred and prejudice of the White workers against the Negro
workers with the sinister aim to split and divide the ranks of

the Working class, thereby maintaining the oppression and ex-

ploitation of white and Negro workers. What Marx said about
the United States is still true: “Labor in a white skin cannot
emancipate itself as long as labor in a dark skin is branded.”

e Negro Worker must learn to utilize to the fullest extent
the possibilities created by modern capitalism for organization
and struggle against wage slavery in alliance with the Workers
of other races.

The Communist Party considers it as its historic duty to
unite all workers regardless of their color against the common
enemy, against the master class. The Negro race must under-
stand that capitalism means racial oppression and Communism
means social and racial equality.

XIII. THE FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS

Next to the Negroes the foreign-bom workers in the basic
industries are the most exploited, most persecuted stratum of
the toiling masses of this country. There are almost 14 million
foreign-born in the United States. The overwhelming majority
belong to the working class. Nearly half of all the foreign-born
are toiling in the manufacturing and mechanical industries. The
majority of all industrial workers of America, not less than
58 per cent of the total employed in American industries, are

 

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 5'3

foreign—horn. Steel, coal, textile, automobile——all these in-
dustries are based on the sweat of the foreign-born workers.
Cut off by differences in language and customs, the foreign-
born workers are an easy prey of the employing class. Their
fate is the longest hours, the lowest wages, the worst housing,
the poorest schooling. Scores of state and federal laws discrim-
inate against the foreign-born worhers. There is hardly a State
in the United States which has no special laws discriminating
against the foreign—born workers. According to the law of some
States, the foreign—born person has no right to read newspapers
or books not printed in English. He has no right to keep dogs
or a gun or a rifle. He cannot teach in public schools. Accord-
ing to the laws of nine States, a foreign—born Worker cannot
be employed on public Works. Some States do not allow public
meetings to be conducted except in the English language.

But all this discrimination is not enough for 100 per cent
Americanism. The Coolidge administration is carrying out an
offensive against the foreign-horn workers as part of the open-
shop drive of the bosses, is planning a whole series of vicious
measures against them. The foreign-born workers- are to be
registered. They are to be finger-printed and photographed like
criminals. If naturalized, they are to have their citizenship pa-
pers taken from them if their conduct does not suit the bosses.
They are to be deported if they participate in strikes or make
speeches in strike meetings. The Chairman of the House Im-
migration Committee, Albert Johnson, during the powerful de-
monstrations demanding freedom for Sacco and Vanzetti, ut-
tered the threat: “Aliens domiciled in America should remem-
ber that if they partake in anti—government demonstrations here
they are liable to deportation under the 1919 Act.”

There is a whole series of bills before Congress which are
aimed against the foreign-born workers. The Brand Bill, the
Hawes Bill, the Ashwell Bill, and other products of American
Fascism try to reduce the foreign—born workers to modern in-
dustrial serfs. The Brand Bill would compel all foreign—born
not only to register but “to report at such times and such places”
when “in the judgment of the President the interests of the
national defense so require.” The same Act would decree that
“whenever any alien is temporarily absent from the district in

which he is registered, he shall report at such times and places
and give such information in regard to his movements as may
be required.” '

The immigration laws which restrict the freedom of move-
ment of the foreign-born workers and discriminate against the
peoples of Asia are part and parcel of the system of American
imperialism. The newest demand of the bosses, as expressed
in the notorious Brand Bill, is to give full authority to the
President to regulate, restrict or enlarge the immigration quotas
according to the actual needs of the different industries. The
apostles of 100-percentism are not the enemies of the foreign-
born workers, if they can use them as strikebreakers, as helpers
“in industrial needs.” ‘

The labor aristocracy, under the leadership of the A. F. of
L. bureaucracy, shares with big business the profits derived
from high tariffs and restriction of immigration. High tariff
is the material basis for the prohibition of immigration. The
platform of the Socialist Party for 1928 shows the true colors
of this renegade party in not demanding unrestricted freedom
of immigration and the repeal of the infamous immigration laws,
but calling only for the "mo.d‘z'fication of the immigration laws
to permit the reuniting of families.”

The Workers (Communist) Party of America is equally
the party of the native-born, the foreign-born, and the Negro
workers. It is the party of the whole working class. It fights
the offensive of the bosses against the foreign-born workers. It
fights against nationalist prejudices which divide the ranks of
the workers. Its slogan is: W orkers of all languages and races
in America unite!

DEMANDS

1. All workers must unite against the common enemy, the
capitalist class, to prevent the enactment of new laws (to regist-
er, fingerprint, and photograph) against foreign-born workers
and to abolish all existing laws of discrimination.

2. All workers must wage an active campaign to uproot
the prejudices fostered by the employing class against the foreign-
born workers and to draw the millions of foreign-born workers

more and more into the political life of the country and the
class struggle.

3. Immediate repeal of the immigration laws. Abolition
of all restrictions on immigration.

4. Equal pay for equal work for native and foreign-born
workers.

XIV. WORKING WOMEN

The number of working women is steadily growing. There
are today in this country 8V2 million working women over the
age of ten. A

The capitalists are the apostles of the family, but they do
not hesitate to break up the family life of the worfing class,
if the needs of industry make it necessary. They cannot resist
the call of profits. The number of adult and married
women" in industry is growing fast. It had reached in 1920
almost two million. Manufacturers prefer Women, because they
offer less resistance than male workers to capitalist oppression.
Male workers are often replaced by women, because the intro-
duction of new machinery makes the skill of male workers su-
perfluous. As a general rule, women worh in less well-paid
occupations and receive lower wages for identical worh. The
logic of capitalism is that working women need more protection,
they are weaker than the male workers ; therefore, they get less
protection and are subjected to greater exploitation than male
workers.

The Communist Party is by no means against women work-
ing in industry. It is of the.opinion that in entering industry
working women can become more effective participants in the

struggle of the working class against capitalist exploitation. But
it calls on the workers to fight the harmful effects of industrial
work on women and to struggle for the adequate protection
of working women. Only a Communist society can lift the
double burden of housekeeping and factory work from the
women of the working class.

DEMANDS

1. Prohibition by law of night Work, overtime and job
work for working women.

4. The organization of working women into trade unions
and elimination of all restrictions and discriminations against
Women in trade unions.

5. Equal pay for equal work for male and female workers.

XV. YOUTH, CHILD LABOR AND EDUCATION

Exploitation of children and young workers is one of the
pillars of American capitalist society. Children's blood and
young boys’ and girls’ sweat are a growing source of profit for
big business. According to the 1920 census, which greatly un-
derestimates the number of child laborers, there were over one
million working children between the ages of 10 and 15. To
increase the shame there were 378,000 toiling children between
the ages of 10 and 13. There are no statistics on the Work of
children under the age of 10—that is the sole reason why there
is no report about the scores of thousands of the smallest chil-
dren of the working class slaving to the glory of our dollar
civilization.

There are almost fo-ur million young workers and at least
one million boys and girls in industry alone. Steel and iron,
coal and textile factories are the chief “playgrounds” of our
working-class youth. Technical progress means progress of
youth and child labor. It is one of the biggest achievements of
American “democracy” that the Supreme Court of the United
States, that notorious guardian of American “liberties,” de-
clared any laws forbidding child labor unconstitutional.

The propaganda agencies of capitalism boast about the
Wonderful progress in education. They forget only that the
sole aim of the education of the children of the working class
is to implant in their minds as early as possible a feeling of awe
towards capitalist society. Education is class education in this

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 5'7

country. Higher education is too expensive for the children of
the working class. Primary education is conducted in the

I spirit of jingoism and religious prejudice. According to offi-
cial statistics, in 1920 only 73 per cent of the pupils reached the
sixth and only 58 per cent the eighth grade. In other words,
almost half of the children did not even graduate from the
elementary school. The schools are overcrowded. Anti-evolu-
tion laws prevent the teaching of natural science in many States.
In the South, Jim Crow education prevails. The famous
“academic” freedom is only a legend.

Under capitalism education is or monopoly of the master
class. Only a Communist society, which will combine the
participation in production with vocational training and general
education, will break this monopoly and will abolish the class

character of education, transforming it into social education,

making it compulsory, universal and equal.

DEMANDS

1. Comphlsory abolition by law of child labor under the
age of 16, and State maintenance of all children at present em-
ployed. Abolition of underground Work, night work, overtime,
and work in dangerous occupations for all young workers.
Six-hour working day and the five-day week for all young
workers between the ages of 16 and 18.

2. A $20 minimum wage for young workers.

3. Establishment of work-schools in factories for the train-
ing of young workers in industry. These worI<—schools should
be modeled on the work-schools in the Soviet Union, should be
under the control of the young workers belonging to trade
unions and workers’ factory committees. Young workers to
receive full Wages while attending w.ork—schools, and the hours
attending school should be included in the general hours of work.

4. Immediate utilization of schools as feeding centers for
children of unemployed workers, whether of school age or
below it. These stations should be under labor-parent control.
Free clothing and free medical treatment by the schools for the
children of the unemployed.

5. Every young person 18 years of age or over must be

FOREWORD

“The Platform of the Class Struggle” was adopted at the
National Nominating Convention of the Workers (Communist)
Party of America held on May 25-27, 1928 in New York City.
296 regular delegates and 150 fraternal delegates, coming from
39 States and the District of Columbia, attended this important
Working-class gathering. The convention was a true cross-
section of the exploited and oppressed masses of this country.
N ative-born and foreign-born white workers, representatives of
the Negro race, exploited farmers, and working Women, veter-
ans of the class struggle, delegates .of the youth, and represen-
tatives of the colonies and semi-colonies of American imperial-
ism joined in a powerful demonstration against their common
enemy-—capitalism.

The National Convention nominated Comrade William
Z. Foster for President and Comrade Benjamin Gitlow for
Vice-President. Our nominees are fighters in the struggle for
the liberation of the working class and are not servants of Wall
Street as are the nominees of the Republican and Democratic
parties. The advocates of capitalism——and foremost among
them are the corrupt bureaucracy of the American Federation
of Labor and the renegade leadership of the Socialist Party-are
spokesmen of class collaboration between the working class and
the master class.

“The Platform of the Class Struggle” exposes the whole
fraudulence of all the schemes of class collaboration, which serve
only one purpose: to perpetuate the rule of capitalism, the wage
slavery of the workers, the oppression of the Negro race, the
exploitation of the working farmers, and the subjugation of the
colonial peoples. The keynote of our platform is struggle——
relentless, uncompromising, determined class struggle against
the capitalist world. The Workers (Communist) Party pre-
sents its platform as a rallying base for all the exploited and
oppressed, as the organizing and mobilizing instrument for all
struggles of the toiling masses.

We call upon all workers, exploited farmers, and Negroes
to endorse “The Platform of the Class Struggle”! Vote for
and join the Communist Party!

mediate relief from over-crowding by building new schools;
(c) abolition of religious and jingoist instruction; abolition of

(e) no discrimination against teachers on account of “subver-

sive” political opinions; right of teachers and students to

XVI. HOUSING

Nothing brings out into bolder relief “equality” under
capitalist conditions than the matter of housing. The members
of the master class dwell in the finest apartments, in the
most luxurious palaces. ‘.They monopolize the clean, broad
streets of the “respectable” residential sections. The workers

are segregated in the most disagreeable unsanitary sections of
the crowded cities.

Congested tenements, miserable slums are the main quarters
for proletarian homes. Death has a bigger toll in the working-
class sections, especially among the children. Rent is unbearably
high for Workers. On the average the worker is compelled to
spend more than 25 per cent of his wages on rent. According
to the law of social justice in capitalist society, the higher the
income the lower relatively the rent.

The Government——-federal, state and municipal govern-
ments alike—are doing nothing to relieve the housing shortage
and to reduce the high rents. Building speculators do not con-
struct homes for the workers, because the poorly—paid Wage-
earner is not able to pay the high rent demanded. Scores of
thousands of workers are forced to live in lightless rooms with-

out adequate plumbing and heating, with insuﬂicient ventilation
and Water supply.

In striking contrast to the criminal attitude of the American

capitalist Government toward the housing situation are the
measures of the Workers’ Government of the Soviet Union.

 

 

PLATFORM OF THE WORKERS PARTY 5'9

The Workers’ Government of the Soviet Union nationalized all
dwellings of the employing class. It turned over all the palaces
and villas of the capitalists to the workers. It lowered the rent
for wage-earners so much that unskilled workers pay only a
nominal rent. The building of homes for workers, is an essen-
tial part of the whole constructive program of the Soviet Gov-
ernment, which spends millions yearly to erect houses for wage-
earners.

DEMANDS

1. Municipal fixing of low rents for Workers. Rent for
wage—earners should not amount to more than 10 per cent of
their Wages.

2. Municipally built houses should be rented to the work-
ers Without profit.

3. Immediate enactment of state laws providing for abo-
lition of the right of eviction by landlords against Wage-earner
tenants.

4. Compulsory repair by the landlords of all Working-
class homes in bad condition.

5. Immediate establishment by municipalities of homes to
shelter the unemployed.

6. Municipal aid to Workers’ building co-operatives.

XVII. PROHIBITION

Prohibition, as it is “enforced” and violated in this country,
is one of the most outstanding examples of capitalist corruption
and hypocrisy.

The Workers (Communist) Party takes the following stand
on the prohibition issue:

Prohibition was introduced in the interests of the manufact-
urers. As the Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Journal put it:
"We believe there is no question of greater importance to Amer-
ican manufacturers, the great employers of labor, than prohi-
bition.” The prohibition of the consumption of liquor decreases
the needs of the Worker, and thus tends to decrease the price of
his labor power. The introduction of prohibition was part and

60 THE PLATFORM OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE

parcel of the big rationalization campaign of the employing class.
It makes the worker more efficient, more adaptable to the ma-
chinery. It is a link in the chain of the general speed-up. The
enforcement of prohibition is a typical class measure. Rich
people are exempt from its enforcement. Its whole burden falls
upon the proletarian elements.

Prohibition embodies in the most- classic manner the basic
views of the employers toward the workers. The Worker gives
his life not only during the working hours but all day and all
the time to the capitalist. Eating, drinking and sleeping, the
worker serves only one purpose: the maintenance of his
labor power for the capitalists. The very fact that the worker
consumes the food which he buys for his wages forces him to
sell his labor power again. It does concern the capitalist how
the worker eats and drinks. If the worker spends his wages
for liquor, if he gets drunk Sunday night, if he is not fit for
work Monday morning——that concerns the capitalist not be-
cause it is a violation of the interests of the worker, not because
it helps to destroy him physically and mentally, but because it
constitutes high crime against capital, since it “defrauds” the
capitalist of the labor power which belongs to him.

These are the views of the capitalists concerning the “private”
life of the workers. Prohibition is nothing but the realization
of these views.

On the other hand, the driving force behind the movement
against the enforcement of prohibition, for the repeal of the
Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, is the powerful
alcohol capital which still has tremendous vested interests in
the liquor industry.

The “enforcement” of prohibition has created a huge gov-
ernmental machine of prosecutors, spies, provocateurs and courts.
This machine tends to increase the power of the capitalist gov-
ernment and is a virtual part of its strikebreaking apparatus.

The lack of enforcement of capitalist prohibition has cre-
ated a powerful Izootlegging industry with a capital of hundreds
of millions of dollars. The hazards of this industry are compen-
sated by extremely high profits. An elaborate system of an un-
derground capitalist world is hiding itself under the surface of
respectable capitalist society. It has its own spies, provocateurs

and gunmen, who are often utilized against the labor move-
ment, against striking Workers. The combination of the twin
brothers, capitalist prohibition enforcement and capitalist boot-
legging, has created an unheard-of amount of corruption, crime
and hypocrisy.

The stand of the Republican and.Democratic parties on the
prohibition issue is a model example of capitalist demagogy. It
is not an issue between the two parties but rather one within
both. Very often from wet throats issue dry voices. The play-
ing up of prohibition as a major political issue serves only one
purpose. It covers up the lack of any real difference between
the capitalist parties, and distracts the attention of the Workers
from the real major class issues of the toiling masses.

Especially shameful is the position of the Socialist Party of
America on the prohibition issue. Its platform is against the
present prohibition enforcement, because “further persistence in
this tragic farce threatens a complete breakdown of law and
order.” This exposes the Socialist Party in its true role as
the upholder of capitalist law and order. Many members of
the employing class also, who favor prohibition from the point
of View of capitalist efficiency, are against strict enforcement,
because they realize its impossibility under present conditions
and likewise are concerned lest the faith of the masses in “law
and order” be shaken.

Alcoholism is one of the most terrible social diseases of
capitalist society. Alcoholism is caused by capitalism itself. ln~
security of life, the monotony of standardized factory work, the
low cultural level -of the masses and desperate poverty are the
reasons for this social disease. Only a Communist society can
cure alcoholism by elevating the cultural level of the masses,
by diversifying labor, by putting an end to insecurity of life,
and by eradicating poverty. The struggle against alcoholism,
which must be conducted by the Communists in the most ener-
getic fashion, is a part of the general struggle against capitalism.
Only the overthrow of capitalism will sweep away the despicable
bootlegging industry an.d the equally despicable, corrupt, hypo-
critical capitalist prohibition enforcement.

DEMANDS

1. The Workers (Communist) Party favors the repeal
of the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment.

2. Dissolution of the federal and state prohibition enforce-
ment apparatus.

3. Energetic propaganda against alcoholism as one of the
most malignant social diseases under capitalism.

XVIII. FORWARD TO A WORKERS AND FARMERS‘

GOVERNMENT

This is the platform of the class struggle. These are the de-
mands the Workers (Communist) Party puts forward in the
present Presidential election campaign. But none of these de-
mands, and not even the total of these demands, exhausts the
program of the Communist Party. We call upon the workers
to rally around the Communist Party in a relentless struggle
for these demands which, realized, would protect the toiling
masses against the most harmful effects of trustified capitalism.
But even the realization of all these demands would not liberate
the Working class from the double yoke of capitalist exploita-
tion and oppression. Only the full realization of the entire
program of the Communist Party can bring about the emancipa-
tion of the working class. The Communist Party has the fol-
lowing aims:

The formation of the proletariat into a class; its separation
from other classes; the development of its consciousnm, organ-
ization, and fighting capacity;

The organization of a mass Communist Party to lead the
struggles of the working class against all capitalist parties;

The representation of the most general international inter-
ests of the working class as a Whole as expressed in the principles
and practice of the Communist International;

The overthrow of capitalist rule;

The conquest of political power by the working class and
the establishment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.

American imperialism is very powerful. Capitalism in

this country is still on its upward grade, but it is becoming
more and more part and parcel of world capitalian, which on

the whole has entered into the last declining stage of its de-
velopment.

It is not

he very existence of the Socialist Republic of the Soviet
Union, which freed one-sixth of the earth from capitalist in-
fluence and expansion, is a limitation to the growth of
United States imperialism. The forces of the proletarian revo-
lution are gathering in other countries, too. The more than

the legions of the Working-class revolution.

The struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples of dsia
and the growing resistance of the suffering peoples of Latin
America constitute another limitation to the upward develop-

to class Wars. The sharpening contradictions Within American
capitalism will arouse gigantic forces which will be strong
enough to overthrow it. The alliance of the 17 million in-
dustrial workers, the 4 million agricultural Workers, the 10
million Negroes, and the millions of exploited tenant farmers
will constitute a powerful bloc which will be able to crush the
present dictatorship of the bosses.

These exploited and oppressed masses will rise up and
establish a workers’ and farmers’ government, will organize their
own State apparatus in the form of workers’ councils;, and Will

break the monopoly of the capitalists over the means of pro-
duction.

A genuine'Workers’ and Farmers’ Government of the
United States Will expropriate all large-scale industries, rail-
roads, super-power plants, meat-packing plants, grain elevator
combines. It will nationalize all large land _estates; it will
establish huge collective State farms, and will satisfy the land

all banks and commercial institutions. A Workers’ and Farmers’
Government of the United States will free all American col-
onies immediately, will grant the right of full self—determina-
tion to all Latin—American peoples, will realizefull social equal-
ity for Negroes. It will disarm the master class and Will arm
the Working masses.

Forward to a Workers’ and Farmers’ Government! For-
Ward by means of relentless class struggle! The Workers
-(Communist) Party is the party of the class struggle. It is  
the deadly enemy of capitalist society. It fights for the com- 
plete unity of the Working class, for the united struggle of "3
native-born, foreign-born, and Negro Workers against the com-
mon enemy: trustified capital. . ..

The Workers (Communist) Party calls upon all Workers  .
and exploited farmers to leave the old capitalist parties.

NATIONAL PLATFORM of the WORKERS
(COMMUNIST) PARTY, 1928

I. AMERICA TODAY

President Coolidge said to the big bankers and manu-
facturers in Philadelphia: “We hold a great treasure which
must be protected.” In the name of the Working class and the

exploited farmers of this country the Workers (Communist).

Party raises the question: Who owns the "great treas-
ure,” in whose interest: must it be protected, and who hears the
burden of its protection? And our answer is: The “great
treasure” is owned by a handful of powerful bankers, manu-
facturers, and railroad magnates. ;The only share of it the
workers and working farmers receive is exploitation and poverty,
and all the burden of defense of the “great treasure” of Ameri-
can imperialism rests on the shoulders of the industrial and agri-
cultural workers.

America is today the most powerful country in the world.
America’s Wealth, the “great treasure,” mounts up to 400 bil-
lion dollars. Half of the gold of the world is now in the pos-
session of the United States. With but seven per cent of the
World’s total population America controls the bulk of the
World’s resources: 44 per cent of the World’s coal, 70 per cent
of the oil produced, 52 out of every 100 tons of steel, 60 per
cent of the cotton and corn, and half of the World’s railways,
copper and pig iron.

A gigantic accumulation and concentration of capital is
going on. The total amount of bank deposits is now over 56
billion dollars. There are over 1,000 factories in America em-
ploying more than 1,000 workers each, with a total of about
2V2 million workers. Of all wage-earners in manufacturing
over 56 per cent work in those 10,000 factories each of which

turns out annually products to the amount of a million dollars
or over.

Trustification is asserting itself with irresistible power.
Consolidations of railways, big combines and mergers in all in-
dustries areithe order of the day. The United States Steel F
Corporation has a capital of 1.4 billion dollars. A food trust
is attempting to combine 2 billion dollars into one powerful
corporation. The recent consolidation of the Brooklyn Edison ;
Company and the Consolidated Gas Company of New York 
resulted in a merger of over one billion dollars. Five powerful 
companies control almost half of the whole national output of
water power, and eleven groups control 80 per cent. Eight
companies control three-fourths of the anthracite coal. Two
companies exercise control over half of the copper resources. E
of the country. ,

A process of centralization similar to that in production ',
is going on in the field of distribution. There are today 3,893
chain store organizations controlling 101,536 retail outlets in
thirty merchandise fields. These chains realized in 1927 a vol— ~
ume of business estimated at almost six billion dollars or 16 
per cent of the total retail business of the country. The anti— 3
trust laws function today not as instruments of “trust—bust- 
ing” but as a means of trustification. >

The United States is the leading country in respect to cape? ,
talist rationalization. The productive power of American in- E
dustries has increased tremendously. In a decade productivity 
per employee in American manufacturing has increased 33 per .
cent, cost of management has decreased 12 per cent, but wages l
per unit of production have increased only 2 per cent. Over— E
development of industrial productive capacity is one of the basic 1
features of American imperialism.

l

Finance capital is almighty today. Banks and industries 
are merged. The climax of this development Was marked by 
the fact that J. P. Morgan, head of American finance capital, 
became the head of the United States Steel Corporation, the »
country’s biggest industrial company. Hand in hand with the ,
trustification of industry goes the trustiﬁcation of State power. 
The Government of the United States is today an adminisz‘ra- ‘
tion of finance capital. The identity of the dominating person-

nel in finance capital and government administration is com-

plete. Finance capital sends its direct representatives to the.

Cabinet as well as ambassadors to foreign countries.

Trustification, high tariff, monopoly, merger of trusts
and State power, growing export of capital—this is the picture
of American imperialism today.

The stabilization of European industries and the decline
of British imperialism have increased competition on a world
scale. United States imperialism is in a growing measure de-
pendent on the world market, and it struggles for world hege-
mony in every comer of the world—from Latin America to
China. It is engaged in murderous competition for the Russian
market as well as for the markets of the British Empire.

Increased competition, increased struggle for the resources S

of raw material and for the export of capital, high tariff Walls,
and ever-larger armies and navies create a growing menace of
war. .4 second world war is inevitable. Wars on a smaller scale
are going on today in a period which the spokesmen of im-
perialism call the era of “world peace.” American imperialism
is conducting a war of extermination against Nicaragua, is
participating in interventions in China, and is an active ac-
complice of the capitalist conspiracy against Soviet Russia.

Two main antagonisms lead today towards a World con-
flagration. One is the chief capitalist antagonism between Bri-
tish and American imperialism, which has taken" the place of
the pre-war British-German rivalry. The other one is the
general capitalist conspiracy against the Union of Socialist Sov-
iet Republics.

Although British imperialism is today the most reactionary
force in world politics, American imperialism is the leading
power and represents the most dangerous, most aggressive force
of world" capitalism. There is an ever—clearer crystallization
of the two poles: on the one hand, the counter-r-evolutionary
pole under the leadership of the United States to defend capi-
talism against the growing revolt of the colonial peoples and
the working masses of the capitalist countries; on the other
hand, the revolutionary pole under the leadership of Soviet Rus-
sia, around which all the oppressed peoples of the colonies and
all the exploited workers of the world rally.
