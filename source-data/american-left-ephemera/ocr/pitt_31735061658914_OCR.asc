- One or ‘the Other -

There’s your choice of postwar programs: One as the President
and the people want it; the other as Dewey and Hoover want it.

There’s no guesswork about either one of them. You will get
one or the other.

This all bappeneol the summer of 1944 in Congress. The hatchet-
men were overwhelmingly Republican. Consider . . . if the GOP
can do that NOW when we have still to march into Berlin and
Tokyo, when we have some 11 million soldiers overseas . . . what
would they do if Dewey were elected?

The President and his supporters in Congress are determined
that an America which amazed the world with its productive ener-
gies in wartime; that built up the mightiest labor force in history;
that achieved mass employment—must continue to do just that
in peacetime. We must not allow a partisan, ruthlessly selﬁsh group
to deceive America into surrendering its great destiny—a destiny all
of us—labor, management, government, the people-—have made
possible.

Roosevelt’s program has already resulted in one post—war guaran-
tee——the GI Bill of Rights. This is a long, long cry from the

miserable and reactionary $60 pittance that servicemen received as-

their demobilization “security” and ticket home after the last war.
The Bonus March on the Capitol in 1932 which ended in the
disgracefulbattle of the Anacostia Flats where starving World War
veterans were mowed down and slugged at the behest of Dewey’s

_ sponsor Herbert Hoover, must not happen again!

Today the veteran of the second World War can look forward
to a whole series of guarantees that the government will not forget
its reponsibilities to him. He can depend on the Selective Service
Reemployment Division to aid him in getting back his job or
ﬁnding a new one; he will have in the Veterans’ Administration

an institution pledged to help him rehabilitate; he knows that under‘

the Roosevelt Administration there are: the Vocational Rehabilita-

tion and Training Division of the Federal Security Agency; a policy

of free education at government expense; a system of hospitalization

to readjust him mentally and physically for the future, quickly and
a 8

 

 

scientiﬁcally. He knows that the Administration is with him, heart
and soul.

0 There Is No Guesswork 0

He will receive not 3560 as his demobilization pay but $300; and
in every step of his life into the peacetime economy of the nation,
he will ﬁnd the Administration already geared and willing to help.

With regard-to these beneﬁts, established through passage of the
GI Bill of Rights, there is no guesswork. With regard to the security
GI Joe (your father, your son, your brother) and the whole nation
would enjoy through the Roosevelt policies, there is no guesswork
either. A goodly section of this pamphlet will array a mass of facts
to prove what FDR /94: done and to establish that he will assuredly
do more when given the opportunity.

With regard to the fate of the _nation under a Dewey-Republican
regime, there’s not a shadow of doubt. The defeat of the Kilgore-
Murray-Truman Bill foreshadows the whole direction of Dewey’s

- Republican policy: am attack on every front upon the rtcmdttrdr of

living and the security of the people. This attack is veiled under
phrases about “Beaurocracy . . .. States’ Rights . . . public debt . . .
dictatorship . . 

There’s no fact however solid that the GOP reactionaries and
Dewey will not try to twist to their liking in order to: blame some-
thing on FDR. g

Their frame of mind is illustrated by the draftee from a remote

mountain district in the South. He was taking his intelligence

test in camp.

“What does R.F.D. stand for?”

“Ranklin Felano Doosevelt,” he answered promptly.

The above humorous transposition of unrelated facts is not half
so amazingly silly as Dewey's recent statement about the “Roose-
velt depression.”

The GOP strategists must be pretty well out of ammunition to

try to hoax the American people into the idea that the Coolidge-,

Hoover depression of 1929-1932 began with Roosevelt who took
oﬂice in 1933. - -

 

This sort of "strategy" has been known before.
"What’s your idea of strategy?” asked the C.O.

"When you're out of ammunition keep right on ﬁring," answered
the trainee.

- "Such Small Porl-ions" o

The Republican reactionaries are out of ammunition but their
strategy is to keep right on ﬁring against FDR.

Sometimes their contradictory gripes and beefs against FDR’s
program becomes positively "funny.” Like the GI private who wrote
to his mother: "The food in this camp is absolute poison" and
then he complained, "and such small portions!”

“FDR’s program is poison,” cry the GOP crowd, and then the
add, "and such small portions!”

It would be naive for us to expect the anti-Roosevelt forces to

tell the public their real reasons for foaming at the mouth when a.

they hear about FDR’s program of social security for the American
people. i

If they would tell the truth it would be that they're afraid it
will bring too much democracy and too little proﬁts.

Their excuses are more elaborate, like the GI private who speared
his ﬁfth pork chop and seventh potato.

“Brother, you sure like your chow,” sneered a man next to him.

“You’re wrong,” replied the private, “I’m simply devoted to
bicarbonate of soda.”

If you tell Dewey's big backers that they "sure love their proﬁts,”

they answer with equal loftiness, “We’re simply devoted to Free
Enterprise.”

And then they try to tell us that "THAT MAN” who champions I

our Four Fredoms is opposed to Free Enterprise.

- The Roosevell Way ’ o

The plain fact is that FDR wants free enterprise for the whole
nation. His program is a long range program of security for all.

 

 

 

 

The Administrations welfare program goes further even than
postwar transition security.

One of the most fundamental legislative measures ever to be
advanced for the social security of the nation is the Wagner-Murmy-
Dingell Bill (S. 1161), a measure in line with the 8-point Bill of
Rights—a bill that will bring the victory GI Joe won abroad into
his own home. '

The Wagner-Murray-Dingeﬂ Bill guarantees to you, your wife
and to your children, complete medical care——general practitioner's
services, specialists, consultant and laboratory services (including X-
Rays, appliances and eyeglasses) and also necessary hospitalization
care, leaving the choice of doctor and hospital entirely to you.

This Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill also proposes to guarantee to
you, your wife and to your children a weekly income while you are
ill and unable to work; and should you become totally and per-
manently disabled you will receive a regular monthly income for life.

Before and after childbirth women workers get 12 Weeks income,
plus medical, surgical and hospital costs, under the terms of S.1l61.

Old age and survivors’ insurance benefits are provided in S.1 161,
which represent substantial advances over the provisions of the pres-

ent social security law.

 

”'§"f  ‘ ‘ 

,

The \WagnerMurray-Dingell Social Security Bill
(S. 1161) is the most important of the measures
based on FDR’s program, now in Congress.

11

 

The Bill also makes all beneﬁts available to an additional twenty-
ﬁve million workers who are now excluded—agricultural workers
and independent farmers; domestic workers; professional and small
-business men; employees of non-profit organizations; maritime work-
ers, and others. For the ﬁrst time, men and women in the armed
forces will become eligible for all social security benefits, and they
will receive credit for the time spent in service.

The Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill sets up a uniform national sys-
tem of unemployment insurance, with increased benefits and broader
coverage than is now provided inadequately, by the forty-eight
different state laws.

The new social security bill proposes to create a nationwide sys-

  

tem of employment offices to help soldiers and civilians ﬁnd jobs in-

private industry. The provisions of the measure include safeguards
against any form of economic coercion or forced labor in choosing
jobs.

democratic, the\ human way for reconversion and demobilization
programs. The Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill would open a new era
for America in economic stability, in free and enlightened medical,
cultural and spiritual values.

The Dewey-Republican idea of solving the postwar security prob-
lem is to disband security measures. Dewey's program is much like
the famous Civil War day’s Bungtown (Ohio) Riﬂemen whose
company by-laws declared: "In case of war, this company shall im-
mediately disband.”

o Hoover Is Satisﬁed! o

Some Americans may be inclined to be skeptical toward the idea
that Dewey, if elected to the presidency, would—or even could———
disband the social security program established under the Roosevelt

This is the Roosevelt way for a postwar security. This is the

Administration. We Americans naively tend to the attitude that '

once a thing is written into law, it is eternal.

But the fact remains that in this election campaign our social
security gains are at stake. All ‘we have to do to lose them is to
elect the wrong man: Dewey. We would be certain to suffer an
economic set-back under Dewey, because he is Herbert Hoover's

political protege. Hoover dominates the Republican Party which
nominated Dewey. Both Drew Pearson and the Hearst INS have
reported that Hoover expressed satisfaction with Dewey’s nomina-
tion. We should recall, in this connection, that in 1941 Dewey sug-
gested that Herbert Hoover should become a life member in the
United States Senate!

Dewey follows Herbert Hoover’s policies with respect to the na-
tion’s economy and its security program. It is important therefore
that we fully understand what were the consequences of Hoover’s
policies to the nation when Hoover was President. Let us remind
ourselves of the economic disasters into which Hoover led uspand
from which Franklin Delano Roosevelt rescuedus.

o The Record: FDR vs. GOP Ruin -

The people during those Republican days heard about the car
in every garage but they walked on thin soles—and thousands did
not even have soles. The Republicans talked of a chicken in every
pot, while men———willing, eager and /talented men——s0ld apples.
Hoover said prosperity was "around the corner.” But the only thing

13

around the corner was the relentless landlord, the unpaid mortgage,
the foreclosed farm, the idle factory.
President Roosevelt was swept into office by a hungry, desperate

people on a pledge for action. Within a few weeks after his election

he acted. A conference of organized labor and industry and public
oﬂicials urged that the government:

Provide unemployment relief; that it cut drastically the number
of hours a man had to work; that it insure minimum wages at a
decent level; that it abolish, at once, child labor; that it set up ma-
chinery to adjust disputes between industry and labor; that it pro-
vide cultural and recreational centers for the people.

These were not stock demands. They had to be acted on quickly.
And the President acted. Within a year many of these proposals
were legislated into the life of the land. Most of these recommenda-
tions later became part of the national policy, the way of life for
America.

How well we recall the screams of the Republicans, the howls of
rage from the reactionary press and the wail of tears over the great
"waste” of Federal Funds when the President said if industry could
not provide jobs, the government must. On April 23, 1955 he out-
lined a program for four billion dollars in public work relief. On
May 6 of the same year the government set up the Works Progress
Administration. -

o The H-umian Values 0

The WPA is gone now, absorbed in a great era of production,
in a vast wartime crusade to destroy the fascist Axis. We hope there
never will come a time when this tremendous productive machine
—a machine that employs more than 46 million men and women
and is creating a national income never known by our people-
will fall apart as it did in 1950. And our government already is

determined that this nation must insure the same level of employ-

ment, the same, even higher level of living in peacetime as_ in war-
time. But now we are concerned with the years when America was
at war with itself and hungry men demanded work. And industry
could supply only signs from one end of the country to the other
reading: “No Jobs.”
14

L.  n I»

  

 

Americans went to work for the government instead. There is
no way to measure the human values that the WPA restored to
this country, of people who were able to eat again and pay rent.
True, it was not the kind of security that men dreamed about, it
was not the best America was capable of, but it was the first smash
at mass unemployment and at mass hunger that any administration
had ever attempted. ‘It restored hope. It raised morale. It made
men walk with courage again.

In 10 years the government invested $13,000,000,000 to safe-
guard the future of America. It INVESTED the money. It did not
“waste” it as the rugged Republican individualists lament. Was It
waste that 8,500,000 men with 30,000,000 dependents worked
again? Was it waste that 644,000 miles of highways and 77,000
bridges were built? Was it waste that 800 airports were built or
repaired; that 1,500 nursery schools and 400 recreational centers
sprang up in every city and town? Was it "waste” that public
buildings were repaired, painted and erected? Was it “waste” that
writers, artists, actors, lawyers, doctors continued their skills, made
use of their talents, wrote a new history of cultural achievement?

0 Our Greai-esf Task -

No! This was investment for America. It was more. It was the
principle of federal responsibility for the welfare of its citizens
becoming a part of the nation's ﬁbre. Men knew that here was a
government interested in them, a government who felt their needs
and admitted its obligation to their wants.

» "Our greatest task,” the President said then, "was to put people
to work.” 

Millionshad literally been starving. The WPA put them to work

a The Wagner Ac'|' o

No discussion of the President’s achievement in Social Security
can either be genuine or complete without that great Magna Charter ,
of labor, the Wagner Act. When men attempted to better their con-
ditions by organizing, as was their constitutional right, under the
Republican administration they were met with an industrial policy

15

 

 

~.a.._- A ....,:,~«~< :~

 

of open hostility———a policy aided and encouraged by the Republican
Administration. But worse than that, they were often met with
guns and labor spies and open warfare. Americans fought Amer-
icans, and workers were beaten and terrorized. What more coura-
geous and far-reaching act than a policy by the government which
would unfetter the worker, free him from his fears, permit him the
right to organize?

"Such an act was the Wagner Act—or the National Labor Rela-
tions Act—which told the rampant, proﬁt-swollen and hard-headed
employer: The American worker has the right to better his con-
ditions. If he wants to organize into a labor union of his own free
choice, this right is guaranteed by law. You dare not use threat or

 

violence. You must end forever your labor spies, your system of -

intimidation, your strikebreaking goons, your company unions.

It was a historic day for labor. It was a historic day for all
America. ThisoWagner Act was not legislation for a special class;
it was a principle of a free and democratic nation. Let industry~look
at its ledgers. Does it see any red ink, any loss of proﬁts? No, be-
cause a free labor is the best guarantee for a healthy industry. The
records prove that. Only the most stubborn and blinded reactionary
will deny it. But for the working people of America, secure in ‘the
knowledge that their government was protecting their labor rights,
not by words but by federal law, it meant another Declaration of
Independence.

- Hope for ﬂme Farmer o

The Roosevelt administration held out new hopes for the farmer
too. We recall the Coolidge-Hoover era of our farmers before 1933

——an era of rotting wheat and unplantedi corn, an era of millions ‘

of acres wasted, of forests becoming deserts, of farmers ground
under by mortgages, of foreclosures and ruin. Even under the “boom”

days of Coolidge in that year 1929—with its paper inﬂation and

 

its coupon clippings and its great big’ crash—the American farmer
earned less than $7,000,000,000. Hoover cut it down to a mere
$2,000,000,000. The farmer was going the way of his crop, he was
literally being destroyed. '

But between 1932 and 1939——before the war—-the American‘

ployment, or death of wage earner.

farmer had DOUBLED his net income under a policy of govern-
ment aid; the national farm income by 1943 was $14,000,000,000.

How was it done? It was done by a sound plan, by a workable
program. The government established the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration (AAA) to rescue the farmers from the depression.

.I.ater under the New Deal, the low income farmers found their
greatest source of help in the Farm Security Administration.

A government under Hoover——who posed as a humanitarian be-
cause in 1918 he said: “feed the starving people of Be1gium,”—told
the hungry farmers of America to feed their starving mules instead.
The list of achievements for the farmer since the AAA is long and
good to read, but a few highlights will tell the story:

Between 1932 and 1942 the government through its special

agencies loaned the farmer $2,500,000,000”to get on his feet again (

(and incidentally, to feed his starving mule). It cut the farm mort-
gage debt by $2,000,000,000. Reclaimed millions of acres of fertile
land. It reforested the nation. It built 540,000 miles of hard-
surfaced roads to help them out of the mud. It put electricity into
2,000,000 farms, three times as many as the combined Harding-
Coolidge-Hoover administration managed. Through the Rural Elec-

triﬁcation Administration, it lined 600,000 miles of farm area with
electricity.

Dams and reservoirs and irrigation Fertilizers and seed and new
soil. A Soil Conservation Service, an AAA, an FSA, a TVA——
initials, the cynics, the reactionary Republicans sneer. But to the

farmer, to the city worker, to the small businessman, to the whole g

country, these initials spelled out more food and more prosperity
and more happiness.

0 Small Business Saved! 0

And what about the small business man? What happened to him
when Roosevelt took the reins of government? He began to sell
again and buy again and stay in business. In 1932, Hoover dared
to call for support from small businessmen, 32,000 of whom had
failed, that very year! The "To Let” and "Going out of Business”
and “Bankrupt Sale” signs blanketed store windows and small enter-
prises all over America under the Republican administration. But
the small businessman, the retailer, the “little fellow” found that

Roosevelt was his best friend; that here was an administration which .

listened to him, which fought off the gougers and the insatiable big
boys with their unlimited check books and their fear of competition.
With men going back to work, with increased buying power, with
funds made available for them to borrow, with the wheels of com-
merce turning once again, the small businessman REMAINED and
PROSPERED. * .
It may be interesting to note here that Big Business, many of
whom hid under their beds in fear of their citadels falling down;
who banged their lists on glass-topped mahogany desks and swiveled

around in anger at this “revolutionary,”—discovered——hmmm,—

things weren't so bad after all.
It will be enough to give as an example just one industry——-—the

great General Motors Corporation. In the year of the Hoover de-I

pression, GM earned $443,000,000. Under Roosevelt, in 1937, the
corporation found it had earned $1,600,000,000, more than under its

"best” Republican year. In 1941, GM swallowed hard, grit its teeth

and made a mere $2,400,000,000.
Yes, industry, too, has reason to appreciate FDR.
19

I

 

The truth of Roosevelt is that he made a nation alive again-
worker, farmer, small business and big business. He united the
nation spiritually. He «forged it together economically.

- Saving Our Homes -

Not only did the. Administration build thousands of new homes,
go a long way in eliminating slums, create fresh and clean and
scientiﬁcally-designed housing projects from coast to coast, but it
SAVED those homes from being mortgaged into evictions. Roose-
velt set up the Home Owners Loan Corporation—the HOLC——only
three months after his ﬁrst inauguration, a move which saved the
homes of millions of Americans—saved them from being lost for-
ever. Go back to those years of Hoover. Recall the evictions, the
1,000 homes being taken over by the banks EVERY DAY, the
desperate, fruitless search for credit, for loans, for something to keep

the roof overhead, to maintain the house.

 

The Roosevelt administration told the homeowner: "These mort-
gages of yours are much too heavy for-you to shoulder. We’ll give
you a new type mortgage that’s easier to manage.” Offering a single
mortgage at only 5 percent to be repaid in monthly installments
over a period of 15 years, the government with a single act smoothed
out the heaviest lines in the worried brow of the average American
homeowner.

And to the banks which held heavy-interest mortgages that were
not being paid (it was enough to ﬁnd money to eat those days,
much less pay a mortgage) the government said: “Let us have
those heavy mortgages that are worrying you so much. We'll give
you government bonds in exchange.”

The banks sighed—a very, very heavy sigh———of relief. This simple
homeowners’ aid saved more than a million homes between 1933-
36; loaned more than $2,000,000,000 to banks and lending institu-
tions, which in turn saved many small banks laden with unpayable
mortgages and saved hundreds of millions of dollars for homeown-
ers; set up an insurance corporation to protect depositors in savings
and loan associations against loss—and not a single depositor has yet
to lose a cent in savings.

Under the impact of war, the government’s housing program has

20

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed into a mighty avalanche of stone, steel, wood and brick.
Though peacetime housing programs had to be laid aside tempor-
arily, the governrnent’s war plan to build housing for 4,000,000 new
migratory war workers underlined its basic program for a per-
manent, peacetime America without slums.

Congress in 1943 at the request of another Roosevelt administra-
tion agency, the National Housing Agency, ordered that all tem-
porary, public-ﬁnanced housing be torn down within two years after
victory except where government and community agreed -on the
need for this temporary housing.

Here was another step toward the realization of decent homes
and decent environment. '

s ’E'*-'-ER and the Youth 0

And the march goes forward. It goes forward on the strong
shoulders of a youth that was saved from disaster by a vast recon-
struction program under the New Deal. Today, many of these youth
are now leaders in the battle for existence against fascist slavery.
They lead millions of young men who but for the national policy

21

of preserving our youth might have become fertile soil for defeat-
ism, for weakness, for the dregs of cynicism.

Once these leaders of liberation on the global battle front Were
called forgotten men.’ "Bums,” the Party under Hoover called them.
America remembers these “bums,” the army of disillusioned youth,
the restless and the roaming, hitching their way from city to city
in search of work, in search of a hope. They lived in hobo jungles,
they hung around street corners,—they left their schools and their

2 homes and dropped their dreams of love and a future.

There was no work for this army of forgotten youth—but their
government called them “bums." President Roosevelt mobilized,
these young men into the Civilian Conservation Corps.

Young men, who, under a Republican administration rode the
freight rails, now turned out 25,413 miles of new truck trails. These
"bums” who lived without hope now laid out 15,241 miles of tele-
phone lines; they cleared 18,531 miles of ﬁre-breaks and spent
686,709 man-days ﬁghting forest fires; cleared 15,617 miles of
roadside and built 620 lookout houses and ﬁre towers. They planted
almost a hundred thousand acres of trees and they erected 420,633
erosion dams.

- Reservoir of Manpower -

The Adjutant General of the U. S. Army on Sept., 1942 called the
Civilian Conservation Camps “a splendid group of young men and
a great reservoir of manpower for the armed forces." In the all-
out test of democracy versus Hitlerism, these "bums” gave their
answer to Hooverism too—they are crusaders for victory, whose
faith Was restored On March 9, 1953-——ﬁve days after the President
had taken office.

Two years later the President followed up his ﬁrst act in re-
habilitating the nation's youth. Now the government meant to train
them, to educate them for their place in indusry. "They must have
their chance in school, their turn as apprentices and their opportun-
ity for jobs, a chance to work and earn for themselves," Roosevelt
said on Jan. 26, 1935.

In eight years of National Youth Administration activities—the
NYA——-the boys and girls from America’s hardest-hit depression

22

 

 

 

 
 

 

..

homes found a new place in the nation. Some 2,667,000 of them
were given work and trained for better jobs; another 2,134,000 of
them were enabled to remain in school. They were paid while in
training; they were subsidized for their education in high schools
and colleges. The record of the NYA’s achievement in providing
America with furniture and household goods, with tools, shoes,
with canned foods and medical articles, and human skills is a price-
less contribution to the well-being of our nation. Today America is

stronger in wartime because of these youth, stronger in physical “

forces to destroy fascism, stronger in the spiritual and moral unity
of the young men and women of America who under the NYA
found their stake in our country.

c Social Security Act o

This is what a far-sighted, progressive, humanitarian Roosevelt
Administration did for the “bums,” the forgotten men, the dis-
inherited youth of Herbert Hoover’s regime. Unless weremember
——the heroic new GI generation will become under Thomas E.
Dewey, the "tramps of 1945.”

But if what the President accomplished for the young was con-
structive and rewarding, his achievements in the ﬁeld of social secur-
ity for the old, for the unemployed, for the widow, is indeed an
epic of advancement. Here was the time-worn demand of a dem-
ocratic people come true——-security! .

The Social Security Act, passed by Congress in 1935 and amended
in August, 1959, is a national law. It is aimed at preventing and
relieving the misfortunes and tragedies that result from unemploy-
ment, from old age, blindness, and death. Children left without sup-
port or proper care are provided for; the health of a community
has become the nation’s responsibility.

The Republicans have never 1earned——they still cry: "let the
states handle the problem.” Before the Social Security Act became
national lgislation, the problem was handled by the states, by the
local communities—and it was handled badly.

What is the principle involved in this struggle to have the gov-
ernment responsible for the social welfare of its citizens? It is

Tell your Congressmen that the people of this
country support the W-M-D Bill (S. 1161), and
that you want to see it passed, too.

simply this: that in a democracy conscious of its strength and ob-
ligations, every citizen is part of its structure; that if one has no

, means of support, the government is responsible for his upkeep, his

 

health, his daily needs. This is not charity; this is a duty of democ-
racy. The indigent and the weak, the unemployed and the orphaned
chi-ldren—these are the people of today and tomorrow. The unem-
ployed and the unemployable had contributed their "energies to
building the nation and producing its goods; they were the back-
bone of the civilian army, they were the source of the producers of
tomorrow—and no state, no city, no township could properly pro-
vide them with the adequate, even the minimum security they
needed.

Only the federal government with its vast resources and national
functions could measure up to the task. President Roosevelt under-

stood that. He saw the need to expand the beneﬁts, improve the I

machinery of social security, mobilize the states to share its obliga-
tions. T

The program HAS been expanded. Beneﬁts HAVE been raised.
Restrictions which limited the people to such federal aid HAVE
been removed.

o Ten Securiiy Programs -

The Social Security Act, made up of 10 distinct but coordinated
programs, may be listed under these three headings:
Social Inmrance
a) Employment security which included public employment
service and unemployment insurance.
b) Old-age and Survivors Insurance.
Pablic Arrirtance to tlae Needy
a) Old-age assistance
b) Aid to the needy blind
c) Aid to dependent children _
Health and Welfare Services i
a) Child welfare services
b) Services for crippled children
c) Maternal and child-health services
d) Retraining for disabled workers
e) Public health services
True, only the old-age and survivors insurance are administered
entirely by federal government; the other nine are operated’ by the
states with federal cooperation and ﬁnancial arsirtance. It remains
in scope and aims a national program, nonetheless, a program of
assuring social liberty to the unfortunate victims of economic break-
down, illness or old age. This is a program of democracy at work
as President Roosevelt first created it and later expanded it. It re-
mains the foundation for our nation’s entire system of social wel-
fare; it is a system that the Republicans called “utopian" and
"unworkable”; it is a program embedded in the framework of the
country which. the GOP would undermine and destroy.

o Beneﬁis Derived o
‘Now let us examine the beneﬁts (still too low and which a
measure such as the Wagner-Murray-Dingeﬂ Bill would improve)
which stem from our present social security laws.

Employment security means ﬁrst of all a job—but it goes further
than that. It means the right of a worker to get something to live
on when he has lost his job or been laid off. This unemployment
insurance has saved thousands of families when wage-earners

found their incomes gone. It provides regular weekly payments and
every registered worker who meets the state requirements (which
in turn must conform to the Federal Social Security‘Act) will re-
ceive from $5 to $15 a week for 16 weeks—though in some states
it is less.

After a man reaches 65 he is entitled to old age monthly beneﬁts;
his wife too will receive those beneﬁts when she is 65; his children
are entitled to monthly insurance aid if they are less than 18 and
still in school. Should the wage-earner die, widow and children re-
ceive aid, and if he has no wife his dependent parents will receive
the insurance when they are 65.

We offer this summary of our major social security history be-
cause Americans must refresh themselves now and then with the
vast over-all change in the nation's social structure since the Roose-
velt administration steered it out of chaos and despair. We must
not grow complacent on these gains-—they are far from enough.
We must not accept them as milleniums—our people need and
deserve far higher benefits.‘

It is in this light that we compare the America of today with
FDR and the social security act, and the America of Hoover with
no law but that of the jungle—the strong stamping out the weak,
the rich eating, the poor starving. This is’ the stark picture Ameri-
cans must recall and repledge themselves to a future" that will never
know such open disregard for its people. We must not empower
a Dewey to lead us back to forgotten Hoovervilles!

o Mrs. Thompson of Cleveland o

A recent story that appeared in the nation's press tells ‘the social
gains of our people in warm, human terms. It was about Mrs. Mary
Rex Thompson, 32, widowed wife of a Cleveland war worker. Mrs.
Thompson has two children, one aged four, the other a one-year-
old. She became the recipient of the one-millionth monthly insur-
ance beneﬁt in force under the old-age and survivors insurance pro-
gram. Her ﬁrst monthly check was $58.49 and the checks will
continue every month until Jerald Robert, age 1, will be 18 years
old. Consider the story, think of it in terms of hundreds of thou-
sands of Mrs. Thompsons and "Jerald Bobs.”

26

Altogether the payments on the social security account of her’.
husband may total $15,000. Mr. Thompson paid $145 in taxes
over a period of 7‘/2 years prior to his death, and his employer paid
an equal amount on his account. The deep human comfort this form
of social security means to Mrs. Thompson is evident in her state-
ment to Mrs. Ellen S. Woodward, one of the three members of the
Social Security Board, who came from Washington to deliver her
the check.

Mrs. Thompson was unaware that she had this protection until
notiﬁed of it after her husband's death. "I thought that social secur-
ity was just for old age," she said. "Those monthly family pay-
ments make all the difference. They will enable me to keep my
children with me and give them my personal care.”

0 “Without them (social insurance beneﬁts) I would have to get

‘a job," Mrs. Thompson continued.

whether or not they have children. This is what Mrs. Woodward
called a Federal family insurance program, which is now paying
out monthly benefits in excess of $220,000,000 a year.
Mrs. Woodward provided a graphic picture of the million bene-
ﬁts in force: ,
' /
418,500 retired workers receiving $9,846,000 a month;
122,000 wives above 65, of retired workers, receiving $1,518,000
a month;
109,000 widows of insured workers with children under 18, re-
ceiving $2,155,000 a month;
288,000 children under 18 of deceased or retired workers, receiv-
ing $5,550,000 a month;

58,000 widows, 65 or over, of insured workers, getting $1,172,-
000 a month; ‘ ‘i 5

4,500 aged dependent parents, of insured workers, who died leav-

ing no widow or child under 18, receiving $59,000 a month.

Glance at those ﬁgures again. They do not include the $65,350,-
000 paid out to 450,000 workers who died without leaving a sur-
vivor who was immediately entitled to monthly beneﬁts. The ﬁgures
represent progress for America; they are symbols of an era which
began under Roosevelt and which has still to reach its peak.

"In many families,” Mrs. Woodward pointed out, “checks like
these, small as they are, make the difference between normal family
life for America's future citizens and the tragedy of broken homes
and separation of children from their mothers and brothers and
sisters.”

No honest and sensible person would say that our social security
system is perfect. But it is the beginning, it is the ﬁrst long step
toward greater beneﬁts for more Americans. The Social Security
Board has recognized the inadequacies of the legislation and has

recommended to Congress that its beneﬁts be extended to 20 million ,

people now excluded from the social security law—people in agri-

culture, domestic service, small businessmen and professionals and

in other noncovered employment. —
The setting up of a Fair Employment Practice Committee

(FEPC) to abolish racial and minority discrimination in jobs, is
28

  

still another social security plank in the President’s program, as is

his political ﬁght against the undemocratic polltax system which __

disfranchises millions of Negroes and poor white citizens in the
South.

This nation has proved its skill, its courage, its adaptability in
the face of Hitler and Hirohito’s challenge. It showed that it had
the machines, the energies, the people to produce miracles in planes,
tanks, ships and guns. It showed that the people, faced with a life
and death test, could unite behind a single purpose in a common
cause——victory over fascism.

o Swiiching Their Vofes! 0

We are now, militarily, in relation to Germany, in the ﬁnal
stages of that struggle. The defeat of the Nazis is so imminent at
this writing that it may already have been accomplished by the time
you are reading these lines. '

At this crucial moment in history, America must decide whether
it is to move forward and win the peace through lasting security
or lose it through a political blunder by putting into the presidency
Mr. Dewey, who will undo all the great works of our great Com-
mander-in-Chief, President Roosevelt.

We do not approach this question from the viewpoint that
Dewey is a Republican and Roosevelt is a Democrat. This contest
is no usual partisan struggle of Democrats verim Republicans, in:
against ozm, men against political machines. The considerations be-
fore us are the momentous ones of ﬁnishing the war militarily by
crushing the armies of Germany and Japan, exterminating fascism,
and solving the all-embracing problem of establishing a lasting
peace. These considerations rise above narrow Party aims of winning

oﬂlcer.

There are tens of thousands of Republican voters (and eventually
perhaps millions) who, recognizing this fact, are switching their
votes to Roosevelt in the course of the campaign. These practical-
minded citizens realize that the basic issue is that of saving the
nation, not just one of restoring a Republican to the White House.

o If Will Come 0

The battle of November 7 must be fought for as earnestly, as
totally, as vigorously, as any campagn waged in Europe and the
Paciﬁc. The election of President Roosevelt will not come by press-
ing a buzzer. It will not come by sitting at home or looking hope-
fully out of your oﬂice window. It will not come by merely wanting
FDR re-elected. It will come by doing your duty as believers in his
policy of full employment, full security, lasting peace. It will come
only if you work for his victory, participate in the battle.

Indolence and indifference or neglect may write the induction
papers of every male child ﬁve years of age today. You must preserve
his future-—his very life—by registering and voting, rallying your
friends, your neighbors, your community behind Roosevelt who
guaranteed that child’s future at Teheran, and plans and works for
his security at home. .

Wherever you live, whatever work you do, in whatever organiza-
tion you are active, join the battle to hold the line for America and
extend its promise.

Every home is a fortress for tomorrow! Every union, every plant,

  SECURITY WISTH FDR

 

F O R E w O R D The ‘National Fraternal Committee

 

for the Re-election of President -

Roosevelt, sponsored by members of the International Workers Order, has
issued this pamphlet for the purpose of making available to citizen-voters
during this crucial election campaign, the record of FDR’s contributions to
the nation’s social security.

We, as members of the IWO, long supported and fought for greater
social security in America. We endorsed, supported and helped achieve the
various security measures which have become a part of the laws of our
land: the Wagner Act, the Social Security Act. Now we support the Wagner-
Murray-Di'ngell- Social Security Bill (S. 1161). In‘ 1940 we‘ supported
Vito Marcantonio’s federal aid and security bill. Today, we support
reconversion and postwar legislation such as the recently defeated Kilgore-
Truman B,ill. We continue the ﬁght for that type of legislation despite
the temporary success of the anti-Roosevelt forces in Congress, for adequate
reconversion laws are a deep, immediate and postwar need. .

All of the social security measures which we have advocated as essential
to America’s progress we have found expressed in President, Roosevelt's

win-the-war and postwar security program and proposals. That is one of

 

the fundamental reasons why we consider FDR’s re-election necessary to the
nation’s advancement. That is why we believe every American citizen
should take part in the campaign to assure FDR’s re-election. We, as indi-
vidual members of the IWO, call upon our brothers and sisters, our friends,
neighbors, shopmates everywhere, to rally to support of the President. We
urge you to read this pamphlet and then to distribute it widely. REGISTER
NOW to vote for FDR on November 7. ‘

Military and political destruction of German-
Japanese fascism is the basis of World security.
After victory, there must be jobs for all.

"WImtcIm tltinlring about Joe?"

"Oh, my gal, my job, the kind of a place I’m gonna
live i1t»—«when this is all over.”

This bit of conversation took place during a lull in one of the
battles for France.

The sober fact is that the question of jobs sticks in the minds of
our boys in service as they move forward to Berlin and Tokyo in
ships, planes, jeeps, tanks, ’chutes and afoot. While ﬁghting, be-
tween shell-bursts, they talk about their past jobs and their future
jobs—what they like or expect and whether those jobs will last
two months or a lifetime.

As the great struggle against Fascism reaches its climax, the

GI, Joes and Jims are thinking: “What kind of an America, what
kind of a job, what kind of a chance will I ﬁnd when I get home?”

Wherever the men in Europe, engaged in battle to the death
against Hitlerism, have emerged from their underground cellars and
their silence, they have drawn together and clasped hands on a
pledge for political and economic SECURITY!
And in the United States? I

op An lnnoceni word a

While our boys are blasting huge holesin the Nazi lines . . . at
home there are some men who would blast huge holes in the
security of these heroes.

Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, war workers are pouring forth a
hurricane of ﬁre and steel to free a world . . . in America there
are some men who would pour forth a‘ torrent of misery in our
own people’s ranks.

It is time to name names and make decisions! It is time to rec-
ognize those who would lead us on to a better America, an employed
America, an America of peace and security and opportunity—and
those who would return us to 1950 "normalcy.” Normalcy—an
innocent word—hiding hungry bellies, empty and rotting factories,
breadlines, evictions, shoes without soles and babies without milk
—and a "normal” party for a “normal” unemployment of some
17 million “normal” Americans. (Normalcy, thy name is Repub-
lican -Party! Thy prophet is Dewey!)

Against the (1930) “normalcy” program for a postwar America
wehave the program of our Commander-in-Chief, President Roose-
velt, who, as the leader of the nation, said in his message to Con-
gress on the State of the Union last January:

“The one supreme objective for the future can be summed up in
one word: Security.” '

The President's message contained America’s second "bill of
rights.” Our forefathers—-faced with the threat of slavery—swore
out a bill of democratic rights, of free speech and free worship and
free press; Today, having known economic hardships, another bill

5

 

 

of rights has been given to the people; a document to insure them
their stake in America.

0 FDR's New Economic Bill of Rights a

"The right to earn enough to provide adequate" food and clothing
and recreation. . . . The right of every farmer to raise and sell his
products at a return which will give him and his family a decent
living. . . .The right of every family to a decent home. . . . The
right to adequate medical care and to opportunity to achieve and
enjoy good health.”

There are eight rigbt: in this magniﬁcent charter for free men.

To the old and the sick and the ill, the President has insisted on
the "right to adequate protection from economic fears.” To the
youth he has pledged "the right to a good education."

This is the America of the future, desired by GI Joe and every
citizen, the America of humming machines and rich, good earth;
the America of happy men and women, of carefree homes, of chil-
dren assured of their future and the aged assured of the nation's
respect and a decent subsistence.

This is the kind of an America the people want. There's no
guesswork about this postwar world. There's no magic, no myste-
rious formula about social security—the answers have been written
plajnly. A few facts will illustrate that.

Take the Kilgore-Murray-Truman Bill. It said: Let us have a-

centralized agency to plan demobilization and full employment after
the war. What happened? The anti-Roosevelt forces eliminated that!

The Kilgore-Murray-Truman Bill said: Let the government pay
unemployment compensation with a $25 maximum a week to re-
turning war veterans until they ﬁnd jobs. But the anti-Roosevelt

forces were alarmed. This was making America a land of "lazy ‘

bums,” fat cigars for every worker and a Du Pont paunch to boot.
No, let the States take care of that—-—from a half buck to $14 for
a couple of weeks. So the Republicans doomed federal unemploy-
ment insurance for two years to our boys who will come home

through death.

FDR’s New Economic Bill of Rights pledges full
security for the common man, without which
there will be chaos in the postwar world.

Forward-looking Congressmen, following the President's lead,
said: why not give federal insurance for displaced war workers who
are now unprotected by unemployment insurance? This would in-
clude government workers, members of the Merchant Marine, self-
employed workers and those working in plants of less than eight
employees. The GOP answered with one phrase: "States’ Rights."
Try to eat States’ Rights and any good dietitian will tell you it’s a
sure combination of ulcers, pellagra, malnutrition and just plain
starvation. ,

The Kilgore-Murray-Truman Bill asked for a policy of retraining

war workers to peacetime jobs; it called for federal transportation.

funds to essential workers going home or to new jobs. The party of
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and Mr. Herbert Hoover said: Nothing
doing—-that’s socialism! and threw it out.

The Roosevelt supporters in Congress urged: At least, let's in-
crease the allotment for discharged soldiers and boost their unem-
ployment insurance. And the GOP, with oodles of Du Pont dough
to fondle in their campaign fund, smirked: "Now, aren't you really
asking too much?” And they killed that, too.
