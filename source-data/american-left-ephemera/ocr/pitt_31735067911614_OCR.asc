DAHO RAIDLSMASHED  

_WALLACE. Idaho — The worl(- <"

ers of the Coeur d'Alene mining
district smashed the CIO raid
here on January 19. 20. 21 and 22.

It was a great avalanche of.

ballots that repudiated the at-'
tack on Mine-Mill by Senator Pat
Mccarran of Nevada. For it was
the Mccarran "report" that the
raiders used over and over and
over. a song of division. hate and
falsehoodithat spewed from ra-
dios. smear sheets and whisper-
ing campaigns in’ the holes and

. various departments.

The total vote in the Coeur
d‘Alene election was:
Mine-Mill 2.088
CIO 735
AFL 71
No union ‘I53
The most smashing victory of
all was in the gigantic Bunker
Hill and Sullivan properties.
where Mine-Mill won with 937
votes as against 412 votes for
CIO. There were 19 “neither”

" ‘ ‘vetQhere.

Next in importance was the .

Sunshine election, which Mine-

iMill won with 214 votes to 141

for C10. There were 2 “neither”
ballots.
One election was held for the

employees of 24. miscellaneous

properties. The results were _

counted in this election as- though
there was only one- employer.
HERE MINE’-MILL [swamped

‘the election with 747 “yes”uvotes
‘as opposed to only 120 “no?

“votes, N 0 other union‘ was on the .

;volved in the elections, and at ‘these.

ballot, but tlie NLRB ordered-*an
election held. The properties all

bargain together.
Two Mullan properties. were in-

Mine-Mill_ was defeated. The proper-
ties were the Morning mine and the

-Lucky Friday mine, neither of which

has ever been affiliated with Local
18, which carried Mine-Mill's banner
in the elections.

Results. at the Morning Mine were:
131 for CIO, 105 for Mine-Mill, 3 for

“neither.” Two ballots‘ were chal- A

longed and two void. The CIO got 9

' votes more than the majority needed

 

for certification.

-The Lucky Friday vote was 17 for
CIO and 5 for Mine-Mill.

The Morning and Lucky Friday
elections were the result of several
years ofedisruption by the Company
unionforces of ~Don Adams, president
of Mine-Mill Local 9, which has been
all but seceded from Mine-Mill for
several years. Local 9 was not on the
ballot’ because of a maneuver by
Adams to throw support to C10.
Adams failed to qualify by failing to
sign the non—Communist Taft-Hartley
affidavit. _

As one Local 18 steward described
the Mullan elections:

“They seceded three years ago,-
cmd we almost won it back." .

There were five craft elections at

eliminate the 2-week waiting period, 

to drastically change and improve the

EL PASO, Texas—-The Mcoan-an’

- immigration law, which went into ef-

fect the day before Christmas, is
sounding the death knell of the Ari-
zona-Texas Baseball League.

Chuck Whitlock, sports editor of the
El Paso _Times,_told about thelthreat

to the six-team league in his columnva

week ago. He explained:

The new law requires that each
Mexican citizen seeking to enter the

U. S. for new einp1oyment_or for -ath- , ' it _
letic competition must have a sponsor 
visa for each entry. . . ,1‘ '

A petition" must be file'd _by the em- .
ployer or some responsible person con-
nected With the athletic event for each
Mexican national. The petition, with .a
$10 fee, is filed with the immigration
offices. The petition then goes to Wash-
ington, D. C., for approval, ‘after which

American consular offices are notified V

that a visa may be issued.

The visa will cost each person $41.50,
and will be good for only one entry into
this country. ‘Thus the law erects a
high financial barrier for both Mexi-
cali and Juarez, Mexico, each ‘of
whic» operates /a team in the Arizona-
Texas League. ’ ,

~“Neither club can afford the outléy ‘
of nearly $800 each time they cross
the border to play--a series. or go on a ,

_ road trip, nor can the league shoulder

the burden,” said Whitlock.

dThe Senator has dirty hands
The followiiig eclitov-ial appeared first in theyMilwaukée A

Sun-Times. It shows that the American press at la.§t is begin-
ning to catch up with. the Senator from N evada.

,men and ordinary people?"

HERE are too many congressmen who pretend to all right-

eousness and set themselves-‘up as stern judges of every-
one, else’s acts, morals and thoughts. Senator McCarran of
Nevada is one of them. He considers himself as ace inquisitor,
and woe betide the poor witness before him. A failure of
memory, a hesitation, a contradiction, islikely to bring threats
of a contempt citation. Constitutional rights mean ‘little to the

 bullying McCarran.

Recently M£Carran got caught outside his “foxhole of

immunity.” He was questioned in connection with a lawsuit in

which he is‘ charged with conspiring with gambling casino
owners to withhold advertising from a Las Vegas newspaper
after it criticized the senator. On the stand a lot of the McCar-
ran super-righteousness just melted ‘away. ‘ * '

Did the senator take, free food and lodging from hotels’
space for his senatorial headquarters in 1944 and 1950? He

‘ taxpayers not to “expect (my 0'0-day

made last October: “Security of mili-

taxry spending can effect vsulism-iz.t-ictl’

savings in our lmge defense pro_qram.”

motion to table the anti-filibuster reso-

‘lution. Taft’s motion, supported by

both Republicans and southern Demo-
for legislation
against. lynching‘. the poll "tax, and
other-‘_1'orms of discrimination.
Another indicationof GOP contempt
for its campaign promises was the

statement of Illinois Senator Z Dirksen_

as he introduced an watered-down bill
for an rare. The bill haslno enforce-
ment. “teeth” in it. and adds up to litle
more than a faint hope.‘But Dirksen
told reporters that his bill “satisfies”
tlfe CO7’ civil rights campaign nlcdtre.

Meantime, Senator Neely (l)., W.

Remember the tpledge to cut taxes,
made . by Eisenhower at Hartford,
Conn., on Oct. 23‘! _“Of c«)u,rsc,Vwe can”
cut taxes, he said. ' _

Now it turns out that the tax cuts
he had in mind were on excess profits,
not on workers’uwag'es. Key Repub-
licans on the House. Ways and Means
Committee are saying they intend to
let _the excess profits tax expire on
June 30, but will let. the present high
tax on ordinary incomes stand as is for
a while longer. , '

Most important Eisenhower cam-

'l.‘he .failure of “voluntary” health in-

pointedup in a recent study_issued by
the Social Security Administration.

per cent of sickness costs (including in-
come loss and medicalcosts) were met
by insurance benefits. The remaining
,87,V,pcr.cent was paid for by the sick.
Total sickness costs for 1951 were
estimated at 14.2 billion. All private in-
surance plans together paid out $1.8
billion, or 12.7 per cent ofthe total.
llndividuals and their families paid
, out over $2.4 billion inpremiums in

comings of the adjusted” index were
pointed out in a recent article in THE
_UNlON. '

In one of the strongestiblasts ever
issued against the Bureau by any CIO
union, Walter Reuther, president of
both CTO and the United "Automobile
“Workers condemned a recent memo-
randum of the Bureau “setting forth
-methods to convert escalator clauses
to the ‘revised’ index..”fReuther sent an

-“administrative letter” to all, UAW

unions in which he said:

“You are advised to pay no atten-

tion whatsoever to this BLS memo-

~ ._I‘JtlldIlm. It was issued "over the ob-
jections of our Union and the_1..Com-
mittee of CIO Research Directors‘
which consults with the Bureau on
price indexes. It represents unwar-
ranted interference by BLS in col-
lective bargaining matters which
are none of its business. It takes a
purely mathematical approach to a
problem that can be resolved fairly
and satisfactorily only by collective
bargaining. It is misleading in that

it attempts to create the impression

that the ‘revised’ index will be a

continuation of the ‘adjusted’ index

when',"in fact. the'two indexes are
distinctly different in major re-
spects.” '

The, UAW is now trying to reopen
Tall auto contracts be:fore their reopen-
ing dates in order to have 20 cents out
of the 25 cents gained in four and a
half years of the escalator clause made
part of the permanent base pay.

Previously,’ the AFL warned all of

- its affiliates to use the “utmost cau-

. tion”

in negotiating new contracts
pegged to the BLS index. Among
-other criticisms, the AFL pointed to"

—the fact that income taxes,-which are

1 large items in workers budgets, are not

taken in_to account in the index.‘ It

 cnlledlon ‘BLS to issue a separate index

‘whidh “would- show the effect of in-

-creased taxes on the purchasing power
of workers.” ' '

Kennecott Copper last ii:§r:ea'i1"i.' pro-
duced well over 411,000 ounces of gold
as a _by-product from its Bingham

~Canyon copper r erations. This high

yield made the Utah operation the
second largest gold producer in the
U.S.‘ItsA production, of gold was ex-
ceeded only by the fabulous Hoiuestake

mine in South Dakota which "has: con»
sistently ranked highest.

The high gold yield of .K_e.nuecott’s
ore helps to explain. the exceptionally
high profits of the company; Some
experts claim the returns 'on"”'gold

yalone practically pay the production

costs ‘on copper and other metals.

Should the U.S. increase the price

Zinc goals cut

Washington planners now admit. they
made a mistake in estimating future
zinc demand. Previous estimates made
by the Defense Production _Adminis-
tration were the basisfor last year’:
frenzied appeals by zinc mining com-
paliies to boost production. Thesexsameg
estimates were used to justify loans
and other forms of" aid to some of the
very big companies fo'r new mines.

While D.P.A. kept on predicting se-
vere shortages, ~th\. price of zinc
slumped from 19%: cents to 12% cents
a‘ pound. ‘

The D.P.A. «now explains, ‘according
to a wall Street Journal story, that
they failed to allow for use of sub_-
stitute metals to replace'zinc by auto
and die casting industries. Also, they
now say, they erred in counting as
“zinc, used,” in 1950, metal which was

.,merely piled up in users’ inventories.

The D.P.A. has now slashed 85,000

 
  
  
 
   
  
 
 
  

 

tons from its oal for expansion’ of
zinc capaci_t.;ya- resent plans call for
a goal of,1,235,000 tons in 1955.

Industry expands
Canada, by 1956, should be producing
about 20 million tons of iron ore per
year, or four times as much as in 1952,
according, to a recent survey -reported
in a. Reuters dispatch from Ottawa. By
1965, production should reach 40 mil-
lion tons. Z L -
Increased production is expected to,‘
come from the several new projects now
being developed by U. S. capital. ‘ _‘
The largest" of these new projects is
the Iron Ore Company of Canada’s huge
' new mine in Labrador. This is the com-
pany that was organized by George M.
Hw phrey, Eisenhower’s new Secretary
of the Treasury. Five other companies,
al_ heavily backed by Wa.ll,Street, are
also working or grabbing up conces-  
sionspin the Labrador trough. 5,  '
Another important new iron orv. de- 
velopment is the Steep Rock Mincfin
Ontario which is currently prodiicing  
about 2.5 million tons of ore. This , ~f
company predicts a yearly output of V’ i
from 10 to 15 million tons in the near Y‘
future.

Other large mines are being de-'
veloped at Algoma and other parts of
‘Ontario, in Newfoundland, andin Brit-
ish Columbia.

ten percent less than the amount
called forby Truman.

Just two days before Taft spoke,
Eisenho\_ver’s l'l\.\V Budget Director, « 
former Detroit banker Joseph ‘llvf. '  :1
Dodgemwa_r_n._ed the public not to expect
any “60.day____mii'acles”_ in balancing the
budget, asihad been promised during
the campaign. Dod-ge’s statement was-
generally interpreted to mean that he
now doubte__d whether the campaign, ,- ., —,
pi-oniises?t,‘o"':cut_ expenses could be ful-‘.}.i..'l if T
filled iiexﬁyear or even afterthen. H

‘One pos_silile_?i solution being suggest-_ V
ed by sonic-1Repu.bl_icans is to “stretch 7"’
out” arms. expenditures over‘ a longer
period. Thisrwoiuld not be too difficult,
it is pointed‘-.ou»t,' since there. is now
about $81 billion left to be spent from _
previous appropriations. Thus, even
though the amountpfwhich Congress au-
thorizes to b,eCs'pent_ for next year

’ might be less, the ‘actual amount spent 
(including mponeypleft over from past ’
appropriations) could _be more._ .

The real «test; of economy, l1‘o\vever,'_ 
is not whatiscongress tells the execu— 
tive departments that they may spend 
but what is actuallyspent. _And-i_}so’~.~-1».

FREEDOM-—lT WORKS!

PHOENIX (.FP)———After a year of
freely mingling white, Negro and Mex-
ican-Ainerican pupils, the Dysart School
has rated its interracial policy a rous-
ing success.’ .« .. -

A story on the sch,ooI,__,whicli- serves‘
a large agricultural ‘community “eight
miles south of Peoria, was written by
Bob "Lord, Phoenix Gazette reporter.

Phoenix‘ schools still operate on aiJ‘im- I
"‘crow.'basis, but the local School De-_

partment recently appointed" a "commit-

Negro children into all-white schools‘.
“Parents, teachers and‘ pupils agree‘.
de-segregation ‘has worked out beauti-
fully” at the Dysartgschool, Lord said.
Forty-two of "the 827 students are
Negro and two of the 21 teachers are,
Negro. , A _
. PR-INCIPAL A. D. Northen told Lord

4 the sch'ool'd'ecid'ed* to abandon its all-

white policy when its administrators
realized they couldpsave money by ad-

mittipg Negro children. .Previous1y, '

Negro children in, the area -had been
taught at a separate school three miles
away, necessitating transportation and
feeding expenses.

"‘The board decided de-segregation
was the: answer,” Northen said“. “And

. so right after Christmas we closed the

Agua Fria. school, gave the. Negro
te_achers assignments in the mainschool
‘and assigned Negro pupils to regular

that Mine-Mill's A1'aska locals are only
40, miles -from ‘Soviet Russia and -are
used as an liaison‘, apparatus between
Moscow‘ ‘and the Demxer «headquarters

tained in the testimony of Mine-Mi-ll

‘J The  S. Senate last week was
3 « §t1l-uggliiig with the embarrassing prob-
. ”leni"’of wh_at'—to do about Mr. Charles
9E. Wilson. .

Wilson had been designated by Presi‘
dent Eisenliower as his choice for See-
 oretary of Defense, sometimes called an
even more powerful post than that of
"president. Wilson is top man in thé
most powerful corporation in the world
" -- —General Motors——-which now has more
than $5 billion in government defense
contracts. 1
_MThere is a federal law which forbids
diiiy government official from holding
' stock in any company having govern-
ment contracts. ’

When Wilson was called before the
Senate Armed Services Coiiimittee, he
was asked if he planner‘ to keep his
$23,‘. millionin General Motors stock.
Of course, he said. Taxes are too high
to sell the stock now.

Then the committee. asked another
question. If he became S§ci‘etary of
Defense, would he negotiate. g0V91‘n'

he said. And he added:

“What is good for Ge-neml Ailfotors
"is good for the cozmtry, and wAh.a.t. '1-3
good for the country is good for
AA Generail Motors."

That's what Wilson said. Let’s take

A GM—'-and see if “what's good for GM
is good for the country."

MEYERS, Soutli Carolina——The
workers at the Virginia-Carolina
Chemical‘Company plant made /up

They wanted Mine-Mill for their

‘They Won for Mine-Mill in their
first election back in‘ 1946, when

both District.50 of the United

also on the ballot.~

Then came 1950, when they went
through a bitter strike. The company
tried to take advantage of that situ-
ation to get rid oftlie union altogether,
and there was ai_iother.election in Feb-

der. H. W. Anderson, GD/I's labor rela-

tions director, wrote to E. S. Cowdrick,- , A

secretary of the Special Conference
Committee on June 11, 1936: '

“With reference to your letter of
June 1 regard-ing the Seinthzels of the
Republic, I have never heard of the
orgaizizatioiz. Maybe you could use on
little Black Legion down in your corm-
try. It might help}?

This little note from Anderson to
Cowdrick can be found in a report on
hearings of the U. S-. Senate commit-
tee on Education and Labor, 76th Con-

‘ gress, first session, part 45, p. 16945.

Cowdrick’s “Special Conference Com-
mittee” was a group of between 10 and
12' representatives from_ the biggest
corporations in the country who met
secretly from 1919 through the late
19305. General Motors was a kingpin
of the committee, which planned and

' directed Big Business’ campaign against
labor and the New Deal. '

.Is the record of GM-—-and Wilson-
of hatred for labor and greed for pro-
fits at any cost, is this “good for the
country ? "

9 ‘alone’ lrloil out

A new mining machine which speeds
up drilling and loading of rock has
been in operation for several months at
the Grandview (W-ash.) mine of the~
American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co.

The machine bears the full title of
“Multi-Use M echa-4n2'ca.l Production
Unit," but_ has become known as the
Gismo. It looks like a small earth ,
mover and runs on wheels or treads.

In November 1952, according. to a‘
story in the January 7 issue of Busi-
ness Week, the new machine averaged
639 ‘tons perday with six" men (three
on a shift), or more than 100 tons per
man delivered to the regular transpor-
tation system. Under thg old method},
production averaged about 15 tons per e,
man." ’ . .
_The Gismo bears two mounted. rock A
drills on a removable special assembly‘ A
and a scoop at one end which picks up
therock and feeds it into the belly of
the machine. The machine used at‘ the
Grandview mine has a trans"port,ca-

.pacity of about 4'/; tons. The ore-is
