military assistance towards the re—establishment of the status quo ante
bellum. We have directly contributed to the outbreak and the pro-
longation of civil war in many parts of the earth, most notoriously in
Greece and China.

This leads me to another matter that is unpopular, if not dan-
gerous, to discuss. I have in mind the growth of Marxist thinking
and the emergence in many countries of active Communist political
movements, either Communist Parties or left coalitions in which
Communists play an important leadership role. In our hesitation to
discuss this subject publically, we blind ourselves to the fact that
Marxist thinking long antedates the Soviet Union, and that, although
the success of the Soviet development naturally lends to such thinking
a certain conﬁrmation, it would still exist in the world, even if the
Soviet Union by some wave of the wand were to disappear altogether.

In America today we tend to read into these political develop-
ments nothing more than Soviet opportunistic intervention, aggres-
sion and expansionism. This is a superﬁcial and dangerously mis-
leading analysis, if it may be digniﬁed by such a word. It is because
we tend to do just this that we have come to build a foreign policy on
the premise that every manifestation of change and every appearance
of left-wing parties is ipso facto a sign of Soviet inspiration, and the
justiﬁcation of our moving in to suppress its existence. This is the
real essence of the ‘Truman Doctrine,’ and it puts us in the unen-
viable position, whether seen from the viewpoint of the Christian
ethical consciousness or the American democratic spirit, of being
against the legitimate aspirations of the people, and of being lined
up generally with the conservative and reactionary forces the world
around. Not only are we now antagonizing multitudes of people
everywhere by accusing them of being Soviet-inspired, when they are
not—a polite form of challenging their own patriotism—but by our
methods we are causing them to gravitate more and more into the
Soviet orbit of sympathetic attraction.

, As far as I can understand it, this is precisely what happened in
Czechoslovakia. There is little mystery about the Prague develop-
ments. As long ago as last summer, church leaders there warned us
that if the division between East and West deepened, and America
began to re-arm western Germany, the vast majority of Czechs were
agreed that their economic and military alliance with the Soviet Union
would be given priority over all other political commitments. When
you take into account the known facts that American diplomatic
representatives were actively encouraging conservative elements in
Slovakia to frustrate the nationalization plans of the coalition gov-

10

 

 

ernment, and that some American soldiers in uniform were actually
used to distribute anti-nationalization literature, ‘the background of
the Czech shift to the East becomes more apparent.

The Righf of Self Deferminaﬁon

I happen to be one of those Americans, and one of those Chris-
tians, who believe that other peoples have a right to determine their
own affairs. I hold that the primary function of diplomatic repre-
sentation is to create good relations between governments. I do not
think it is a wise policy to send to a country as our ambassador a man
who has personal interests, and who represents definite business in-
terests, in speciﬁc industries or utilities which that particular country
to which he is being sent, has marked out for nationalization. If a
people want to nationalize an industry, that seems to me to be their
right» Our representatives may properly raise matters of compensa-
tion and the like, but not challenge or ﬁght governmental decisions
rooted in the popular will. That is why many of us found ourselves
deeply troubled over the implications of a statement made by Mr.
I/Varren Austin in the course of his vehement attack upon Czecho-
slovakia before the U.N. Freedom to own unlimited private property,
in the way in which he seemed to define it in that speech, is not a
freedom with any fundamental standing in Christian Ethics, nor is
it a basic freedom that informed Christians are willing to go to war
to impose on another country. Freedom to own individual property
is one thing. Freedom to won unlimited private property quite
another.

Nor are we all fully satisfied with the accusations that the Soviet
Union engineered these Czech political developments, when Mr. Austin
has no further substantiation of the charge than that, since Czech
Communists were involved, ergo, the Soviet Union was involved.
There is at least a possibility that the working classes in Czecho-
slovakia had some attitude of their own with the respect to that
country's basic industries and public utilities. And it is important to
note that it was the huge trade unions which immediately voted their
confidence in the new government.

This brings me to the Italian situation and the election. I should
like to call attention to the ugly rumblings in the press, when, for
example, the New York Times editorially suggested that if Italy were
to go ‘Red’, the time was come for a show-down with Russia! Now I
contend that such talk was dishonest, and the Times knew it. If
Italy should have gone left in the election, the government would at
most have been a coalition of Left Socialists and Communists. These

11

   

-are all Italians, not Russians. What their‘ basic program would have
been, if elected, is well known. They were calling for the nationali-
zation of the basic industries and the public utilities, and the un-
shackling of the Italian economy from external financial controls,
and its return to the hands of the Italian people. A considerable
percentage of the total European holdings of the United States is in
Italy, and includes such desirable plums as the steel, automotive and
electrical industries, and the great public utilities like the Telephone
and Telegraph network, which we own outright. Was the Times pro-
posing that we go to war against the Italian people under the cloak of
fighting Russia to save certain American financial investments and
investment opportunities in Italy from being returned to the Italian
people?

I wonder how many of you know of the terrible scandal that
rocked Italy from top to bottom a month before the election, and con-
sumed every page for a week in all the Italian newspapers? It was
discovered that the Under-Secretary of State for the Vatican had em-
bezzled sums of money entrusted to him for safe—keeping during the‘
Fascist occupation. The accusation was also made publically that since
last July, the Vatican, in direct defiance of the laws of the De Gasperi
government with respect to exporting currency, had been acting as a
private internationalbank for individuals, and had been accepting
large sums in lira and had transmitted these capital assets to the safety

‘of the United States, Brazil and Argentina. That double disclosure

which was given confirmation by the unfrocking of the Under-Secre-
tary of State, who is now awaiting trial in a Rome prison, and by the
restitution of money by the Pope to the aggrieved individuals; and
further confirmed by the removal from office of the Secretary of
State of the Vatican, in the opinion of friends of mine who were in
Italy at the time the scandals broke, made a million Communists
overnight. Our pre-election blandishments in the form of E.R.P.,
bombers over Rome, threats of war if the Left won, and letter writ-
ing campaigns were undoubtedly intensified by the knowledge that
many outraged men and women were planning to. vote for the Left.

Chrisﬁanify Versus Power Poliﬁcs

This brings me to the most explosive subject of all, which I shall
simply put in the form of a question. To what extent is the present
crusade against Communism, in addition to its obvious business
roots, the inspiration of the Vatican? I can only raise the question.
I cannot answer it. But two things I do know which we rarely ‘hear

discussed. '- ' I

12

 

 

The emergence of the Soviet Union as aimajor state, and the or-
ientation of eastern Europe towards Moscow, has seen for the first time
in centuries the emergence of Orthodoxy as a religious rival to Roman
Catholicism. This fact has profound implications for the Vatican, and
for the Protestant World. ,

Second, there is a matter of political theory that few Americans
understand. For centuries the heart of the Roman Catholic political
position in western Europe has been defined by the Jesuit political
theorists as a line from Madrid through Rome to Berlin. That was
the axis of the Holy Roman Empire. It did not die with the Re-
formation. It cropped up again under Bismark. It found its most
recent major expression in the Concordat between the Vatican and
Hitlerite Germany, which was negotiated by the then-Cardinal Pacelli,
the present Pope, and Adolph Hitler. Together they gave their bles-

sing to FrancoSpain. Today, Berlin is out of that orbit but Catholic_

Bavaria is not. It might be very interesting to look into the relation
between the industrial mind and the military mind and the religious
advisors now at work in the State Department and in the European
Occupation Authorities to assess the extent of Vatican influence be-
hind the whole breakdown of the Roosevelt program, the develop-
ment of the western European bloc, and the undercutting of the
United Nations. When one adds to these considerations the inter-
locking nature, industrially, militarily and religiously, of the hemi-
spheric character of our Latin American policy, the religious con-

. sciousness is brought up very sharply. Is this religion, or is this religious

power politics?

Now I humbly submit that to American-Christians, religion and
the Christian religion in particular—is something different from
religious power politics. When we are asked, as we are being asked
today, to conduct a crusade against Communism in the name of re-
ligion, we are not a little troubled by the incidental, but not unim-
portant fact, that so many of our fellow-Christians are on the other
side of the line that reaches south from the Oder to Trieste. There
are more Christians, it is quite possible, were the actual figures known.
in the Soviet Union and the states of eastern Europe—that is, east
of the line—than there are west of it. And some of us believe we have
as much Christian obligation to weigh the meaning of that fact, as
to listen to the siren blandishments of Rome calling us to rush to

lher defense as the bulwark of Christendom. We, who are Protestants,

want to move slowly and do what is right. As we survey the creation
of a western European bloc, and place it in conjunction with our
hemispheric policy, we want to know the extent to which the tradi-

tionally Protestant United States is being subtly jockeyed into the
position of acting as the cornerstone buttressing 'a Roman Catholic
political structure.

Mr.‘ Dulles Confuse: ‘the Issue

Those of us who speak to public audiences know that one ques-
tion, more than any other, agitates the average citizen. He asks, “What
of the police state?” Mr. john Foster Dulles was a shrewd lawyer when
he persuaded the Federal Council of Churches, in its second State-
ment on American-Soviet Relations, to emphasize that the basic issue
in the world today is the threat of the police state. Mr. Dulles is an in-
ternational corporation lawyer, and his son, curiously enough, has
entered the Jesuit Order.

Now let me state unequivocally that I am opposed to the police
state wherever and whenever its manifestations appear. But two as-
pects of the Dulles’ thesis trouble me. First, if we are against the police
state, why does the United States throw its strength behind the gov-
ernments of Iran and Turkey, two of the worst police states on earth?
I/Vhy do we create a police state in Greece? And why is the State
Department now plugging so hard for the inclusion of Franco-Spain
in the western bloc as a recipient of E.R.P.? Second, why doesn’t Mr.
Dulles and his Federal Council get more concerned about the very
serious manifestations of an embroynic police state that are appearing
everywhere.in American life, and will surely be intensified if we
pass Universal Military Training and embark on the military pro-
gram of war preparation being advocated by the current molders
of American policy.

I can only conclude that the police state is a false issue, in the
way it is being used. Do you recall the celebrated slip of the tongue
that Mr. Truman made in that famous White House Press Con-
ference when he was discussing his unwillingness to re-introduce price
controls, when he said that we do not want the police state here?
I repeat that I am against the police state, but I should like to point
out that what business means by the police state, and what ordinary
rank-and-file citizens mean by the police state, are horses of two very
different colors, and it is a tragedy that the Federal Council State-
ment should be so undiscriminating between them.

Back The Unifed Naﬁons

You will be surprised that I have made so few references to the
United Nations. I have done this deliberately, partly because there

has been no time to rehearse adequately the sad story of the gradual
undercutting of that most important and basic institution which still
remains our one real hope for humanity, but, besides, what I have
told you indicates some of the eddies under the surface and gives us
many clues to the real work that has been going on behind the outer
facade of appearances.

Most Americans, who believed in the United Nations, have been
unwilling to accept the growing evidence that the United States
was slowly turning this international organization into an instrument
of western political leadership. They preferred to believe what the
press told them, that Mr. Vishinsky was a vituperative old man, and
that Mr Gromyko’s English vocabulary was confined to the one word,
‘No!’ It’s not my business to be an. apologist for Mr. Vishinsky or Mr.
Gromyko. History will render the final judgement, and that is all
that matters. But whatever doubt remained in our minds has now been
blasted away by the United States proposal of a trusteeship plan for
Palestine, and the frank Washington and New York comment on its

a real meaning.

The Alsop Brothers, writing in the New York Tribune, comment:

The basic reason for the reversal of American policy on Palestine
was, of course, precisely to prevent Russian troops from being
sent to Palestine, or Russian inﬂuence spreading to the Middle
East. Partition was abandoned largely because the conviction
gradually spread upward through the State and Service depart-
ments to President Truman that partition gave the Soviets an
opportunity to establish a foothold in the Middle East. The
trusteeship proposal advanced last week by the American U.N.
delegate \A7arren Austin was designed primarily to end that op-

portunity.

The destruction of UNRRA by United States initiative showed the
hand. The unilateral proposal of the European Recovery Plan out-
side the machinery of the United Nations confirmed its character. And
now this Palestine reversal writes the final period to the paragraph.
It threatens the death-knell of the United Nations as well.

From the multitude of details in this ugly story which I have
been outlining, you will begin to understand why some of us have
lost conﬁdence in the leadership now in thesaddle in Washington,
composed of the triumvirate of Big Business, the Mi-litary and the
Church. They have not only bungled the peace. They have thrown it
into jeopardy.

The Road To Peace
The real issue before the United States—but an issue which will

15

not be decided in the election unless the people themselves force
it to the front——is the choice between continuing a bi-partisan leader-
ship which is determined upon maintaining the present economic
structure of the United States at the possible price of war abroad and
the restriction of civil liberties at home, or the active seeking of some
alternative new leadership which will respect the character and the
traditions of the American way-of-life but will accept the need for
those modifications of our corporate structure which will recognize
the growing areas of nationalized economy in other parts of the
world and will be generous towards the aspirations of thelrising col-
onial peoples of the earth.

My fellow-pastor in Brooklyn, Dr. John Paul Jones, a Presby-
terian, has written wise words in a sermon entitled: “These Things
V/Ve Can Do.” He proposes four things for the United States:

First: Renounce the temptation to play God. The control and
direction of the world is not our responsibility—not yet. We can’t
be God. We can only play at it, and that, disastrously. The world
calls us to lead, not to drive and command. ”.

Second: Restore the government to civilian control. . . . There"

can be no question of the military inﬂuence in the political life
of our country today, especially in foreign affairs. Secretary
Marshall asks the country to adopt a ‘military posture.’ We have
foreign policy by threat and force exalted over the time honored
American tradition of persuasion, conference, reason, the appeals
of justice and humanity. This has to be changed

Third: Re—estabIish conference procedure through the United
Nations and directly with Russia . . . At whatever cost, we must
not abandon the conference table. When conferences cease, in-
ternational relations deteriorate.

Fourth: Strengthen the United Nations. Renounce the cynicism
and neglect of this, the only machinery available for internationax
cooperation.

Here is the formidable task that confronts the men and women
of the Churches. It brings us face to face with the Master's sternest
dictum:

“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

A CHURCHMAN EXAMINES
AMERICAN-SOVIET RELATIONS

My interest in good relations between the United States and the
Soviet Union is very elemental. I am not primarily concerned about
Russia as Russia— that is the Russian’s business— but one thing has
become crystal clear to me: that the war with the Russians that some
of our people want, and too many of our people have been persuaded
to accept as inevitable, will be the end of whatever hopes humanity
may have of a better society, and will instantly destroy the democratic
character of the America I know and love. My conscience as an
American and as a Christian is troubled.

War Is Nof Ineviiable

If I were a military man, I would have to discuss the over-all
strategic and logistic situation as it confronts our two countries, and
analyze as well‘ our respective war potentials. That is precisely the
kind of discussion that is going on right now in the War College in
I/Vashington, and I dare say in Moscow as well, where uniformed
men and civilian specialists are confronted with situations of extreme
tension in a dozen spots around the world where some miscalculation
could transform the present war of nerves and pressures and bluffs
from a‘ ‘cold’ war to a ‘shooting’ war. It would be a most disturbing
discussion, because it would have to contain within it the inevitable
question whether, in these days of atomic bombs and long range
bombers, any great industrial power can safely or successfully attack
another major industrial power; and whether, as so many sober
analysts believe, such a conflict would not be utterly unpredictable as
to its development and its outcome, save for the probability that the
world which would ﬁnally emerge from the rubble would bear little
resemblance to any world that either a Soviet citizen or an American
citizen would care to call civilization.

This military side of the total picture serves very well to em-
phasize and underscore the viewpont that I represent. I call to mind
a phrase in the Old Testament: “God saw the work of his hands,
and, behold, it was very good.” I recall an even more startling afﬁrma-
tion in the New Testament: “I have come that you may have life, and
have it more abundantly.”

These two statements form the basis of my approach to our prob-
lem, not as a military man, but as a churchman. Stated negatively, it

3

  

seems to me to be the he.ight——or depth—of irrationality to suppose
that God gave man this world, and now this marvelous technical
mastery of it, with the sole purpose and intention that he should
use it to commit hara-kiri. Stated positively, it seems to me logical
to suppose that two societies, however different their forms may
be, which have in common’ the instinct to achieve a fuller life for
all their people, must be able in some fashion to ﬁnd common ground;
and that this quest, no matter what concessions or compromises or
drawn-out tensions or even mistakes in the attempt there may in-
evitably be, must of necessity be more pleasing to God and to Christ
than any melancholy yielding to the inevitability of war, or to some
rash, opportunistic, irretrievable short-cut to a one-sided imposed
American solution, which ‘will ‘prove no solution at all but only an
alternate road to the same final disaster. My basic plea as a church-
man is that you and I, for our faith in God and for our love towards
Christ, give ourselves to this quest, and refuse to be disheartened and
rebuffed until we have completed it.

How shall we begin? As my military man would say, the hour
is late, and the occasions for dangerous incidents ai*"e many. There
has been in Washington a school of thought which advocated a
‘preventive war’ with Russia now, on the theory that Russia is weak
and without atomic weapons, whereas a decade from now she will
be strong and have them in her possession. Not a few observers of
the Washington scene believed that some incident might be exploited
to this evil purpose. Something not unlike this was done at least once
before in American history on the eve of a presidential election, when
Mark Hanna and William Randolph Hearst rode McKinley into the
White House on the chariot of the Spanish—American War. War today
is a somewhat different matter from what it was in 1898, and the
realization that its consequences are unknown is giving pause to these
advocates notwithstanding continuing preparations for it. It behooves
us of the Churches to ‘declare in no uncertain fashion that, while
we will defend to the death our country if attacked, we will not bless
an act of aggression under whatever rationalization of a ‘preventive
war’ it may be launched.

 

There is every reason to believe that a Russia, still reeling from

the savage losses in plant and manpower from the war against Ger—
many, and rather better versed in first-hand experience of what war
actually involves for a people than are most of us, will not start such
a conﬂict for many years. At this point, the responsibility for any
such disaster will lie very largely on our “own doorstep. As Edward
Crankshaw reminds us, it always takes two to make a quarrel. Let us,

4

 

therefore, see to it that our leaders do not take the initial, fatal step.
That will give us time to renew constructive efforts to achieve happier
relations within the still-existent framework of the United Nations.

' Grave as many aspects of the current situation are, I would quote the

sober advice of Dean Inge to go slow before yielding to any pessimism.

In an article entitled “An Old Man Looks At The I/Vorld,” he writes:

Many men, wiser than I, have predicted evils which have not come

to pass. The body politic generates antitoxins as well as toxins.

Pendulums swing, and civilization is fairly tough. If we escape

another war, our grandchildren may after all see better times.
And Prof. Frederick Schuman reminds us that History is a series of
compromises between seemingly irreconcilable absolutes.

Keep Communications Open

It is a cardinal Christian principle that force must always be the
last resort, and then only when all other means have been fairly and
fully explored. No one with any knowledge of the present situation
would afﬁrm that we have as yet, either fully or fairly, explored all
the possibilities in the field of American-Soviet relations. Our brief
experience of good manners and outward cordiality during the war-
time alliance was indicative of little more than the critical need we
had of one another’s help. It was a beginning, and as such it ought

‘not to be ridiculed or maligned, but the truth is: it never really got
«down to a thorough appraisal of the facts. I do not know how

informed or how ignorant Soviet citizens are about us. I do know
something of our ignorance about them. It is stupendous, abysmal;
and there is a very good possibility that some genuine beginnings in
the direction of intellectual understanding of the Soviet Union will
be matched by some equally intelligent and disciplined overtures from
the opposite camp. Certainly ‘no churchman, in the spirit of his
Master, can assent to conﬂict until such avenues have been _further
explored.

. I feel very strongly about this. In the last year of the war I
had the privilege of escorting the great Jewish wartime journalist
and writer, Ilya Ehrenburg, to Princeton where he had a two hour
chat with Dr. Albert Einstein. Later, Mr. Ehrenburg was taken
through a number of states and shown such signiﬁcant American
achievements as the Tennessee Valley Authority. It seemed to me
then, and it seems to me now, a matter of supreme importance that‘ a
man of his stature in Soviet public life should see something of
America. = ' " ‘

  

It had been my hope that many others like Ehrenburg might
come to the United States, both under governmental auspices and
private auspices as well; and that the courtesies which we were pre-
pared, so many of us, to show them, might be reciprocated, as indeed
at that point they were actually being reciprocated, as a list of Amer-
ican visitors to~Russia would indicate. I know of nothing in my
experience that shocked me more deeply, or gave me an uglier sense
of forthcoming evil days, than the invoking by our State Department
in the autumn of 1946 of a pre-war Alien Registration Act in the case
of ﬁve visiting Ukrainian cultural personalities here on strictly cultural
business.

In the Soviet Union it is a customary thing to honor leading
men and women in various ﬁelds of endeavor with election to the
Supreme Soviet or the Republic Soviets. Because the basso profundo
of the Kiev State Opera was a deputy of the Ukrainian Rada, and be-
cause the editor of the leading Ukrainian newspaper undoubtedly was
a member of the Communist Party, our State Department could
not make up its mind whether they were cultural or political per-
sonalities. Finally they invoked the law against them. The result of
this was that Ivan Patorzhinsky and Madame Zoya Haidai could not
sing operatic numbers in American concert halls, or the journalist
lunch with newspaper editors and publishers, or the Professor of Juris-
prudence from Lvov University talk with lawyers, or the poet meet
with fellow poets. I am a little surprised that the musical, journalistic,
legal and literary worlds of America did not see more clearly the
insult to their own essential Americanism in this State Department
directive, and that there was not far greater protest and resentment.
But from that moment on, the tiny, precious trickle of cultural ex-
change between our two countries tended to dry up. Perhaps the
Soviets made too much of the invoking of that particular law. They
are proud people, and they deeply resented its application to their
leading representatives. That law, and others like it, is today still
active and operative on the statute books.

You may not remember that the Soviets’ authorities had an-

A nounced that they were planning to reopen Intourist in the summer

of 1948, and that visitors wishing to see the Soviet Union might make
their application after April 1 of this year. The Soviet government
does not make announcements of this kind -without serious decisions
having ﬁrst been made. It was clear that they remembered the early
1930's when some 10,000 American tourists visited the Soviet Union
each year, and the result was good for every one concerned. From
our side we remembered that too, and some of us knew further the

6

 

 

intense respect the Russians have for American music and literature,
and the almost unlimited admiration that they share for our technical
skills and scientiﬁc achievements. The resumption of such tourist
travel would have had many positive interests to feed upon. It really
looked as if that mythical Goebbels-Churchillian ‘Iron Curtain’ was
going to be eradicated from men’s minds once and for all. That hope
has now been killed. A mixture of Russian fear and Russian pride
has done it, but it is our actions that have awakened and stimulated
both that fear and pride.

Not many weeks ago I said to Mr. Gromyko that in the long
run, if there is to be an unravelment of our tensions and the building
of normal relationships, there must be the resumption of this two-
way traffic on something other than the diplomatic level.

Need for Understanding Russia

In the meantime there is a more immediate and simpler task
where the Churches have a deﬁnite work to do. It is a part of the
method of Christian relationships to learn to discipline the emotions,
to examine one’s prejudices and biases, and to see with the best use
of the mind and the imagination if one cannot, before making ﬁnal
judgments, get to look at things through the other fel1ow’s eyes. At
the moment we are in an appalling wave of hysteria about Russia in
which all discussion of an intellectual, not to mention a generous,
character, has become virtually impossible. Can we serve to dissipate

- this hysteria and to get the consideration of American-Soviet relation-

ships and problems back to a basis of honest fact and reasonable
analysis?

We Americans, by-and-large, do not know nearly enough about
the Soviet Union. At present, most media for the circulation of infor-
mation are either biased by their ownership or inﬂuenced by the
current hysteria. Publishers are loath to release books that seem over-
friendly or sympathetic toward Russia or the new states of eastern
Europe or the peoples’ movements in Asia, even though such books
may be written by men of long-established journalistic and academic
reputations. The alterations required by the publishers before accept-
ance and publication in the case of John Steinbeck’s recent report
on the Soviet Union, or Robert St. John’s report on Yugoslavia, if
analysed, would prove very illuminating. Men and women who have
been to Russia and eastern Europe,»and are able to discuss intelligently
the Soviet or the Communist ways—of-life and manners-of-thought are
ﬁnding it increasingly difficult to get bookings on forums and lec-

ture-platforms, whereas there is an increasingly proﬁtable market
for any man or woman who is willing to make a profession out of
the lurid description of the birth—pangs of the Soviet system or the
grim residual carry-overs of the Russian historic inheritance, or to
make some wholesale indictment of Communism generally.

The results of this ignorance can very well prove disastrous. Let
me give a crucial example. Too many Americans speak today of
the Russian people as if they could distinguish them from the system
under which they live, and isolate them from the leadership which
now represents them to the world. This, in my opinion, is a dangerous
fallacy and is being much too widely cultivated by the press. Not only
has it come to affect public thinking but there is evidence that it
seriously inﬂuences the minds in our State Department responsible
for official policy, who can’t rid themselves of the delusion that they
can somehow discredit this system and this leadership in the eyes of
the Russian people by some legerdemain or clever dissemination
of propaganda.

We have got to realize that the Soviet Union is now in its 31st
year. It has come into being through a vast historic convulsion that
occurred not all at once but in a series of revolutionary phases or
stages, and was then climaxed by the terrible ordeal of the war with
Germany. These years of agony—and, save for a very brief period of
respite, they have been years of agony—have had their effect on the
Russian temperament and outlook, and have given a peculiar promi-
nence to youth. Many of the older generation of Russians are gone.
‘Nith the exception of a few key men in high posts, and a somewhat
larger number of women, the majority of active Soviet citizens today
are young men and women whose ﬁrst—hand knowledge of society has
been derived from their socialist context, save for their reading about
other societies. Socialism today, and Communism tomorrow, is the back-
ground of their experience. It is what they know. It is what they

-have fought for. It is the kind of life which has grown out of many

historic features of the total Russian situation, as Edward Crankshaw
attempts to indicate in his sharp and provocative book, Russia and
the Russians. V i

For us to base an American foreign policy, as Mr. ‘X’ did in his
article last summer in Foreign Aﬁa2'rs—'universally attributed to Mr.
George Kennan in the State Department—upon the assumption that
we can wean the Russians away from their own government, that
we can split off component elements such as the Baltic Republics—an
objective which Mr. Truman has just reiterated—and thatiwe can
induce the Russian people to embrace a free enterprise system by

short-wave radio propaganda directed into the Soviet Union from this
side of the water, is, if I may say so, fatuous. The only results of such
naive attempts will be what we are already witnessing: the intensiﬁca-
tion of Soviet watchfulness internally, the uniﬁcation of her own
people in their own defense, and the issuing of appropriate counter-
propaganda, at which the Soviet Government has few equals. It is my
contention that the United States would do well to re-examine this
fruitless and irritating line of approach. We must recognize the simple
truth that Edward Crankshaw asserts, that the Russians now have a
mind of their own, and a viewpoint of their own, developed out of
their experience and conditioned by their own Russian situation,
which has a right to be heard. -

That is why I believe that the attitude adopted by Mr. Roosevelt
was not only sound and wise, but even had a touch of Christian
honesty and imagination to it. He made up his mind at Teheran
and Yalta (and the same attitude managed to carry over after his
death as far as Potsdam), that the United States should recognize
the fact of Russia, accept her as a sovereign state, respect her territorial

. integrity as a signatory member of the forthcoming United Nations,

grant her the right to have normal economic and diplomatic relations
with her neighbors, and cease and desist from any attempts to ﬁsh
within her domestic waters, all in return for reciprocal guarantees of
the same character. The repudiation of that approach to Russia and
the substitution for it of the “Truman Doctrine” has been a tragedy.
It has led the Russians to feel that the United States has gone ‘back
on her promises; it has stirred up anger, antagonism and recrimination;
it has endangered the United Nations; and today something akin to
an actual state of tacit war is dangerously near being in effect.

New Socieﬁes Are Rising

There is a social and political ferment going on all around the
world. It is the kind of thing we Christians have always been sym-
pathetic towards in the past, and it is not right that we should yield
to another nation like the Soviet Union the privilege of becoming
increasingly the chief spokesman and champion of these peoples. When
Russia does usurp the place that might have been ours, we ought to
salute her, not damn her. Where we might have found areas for
genuine cooperation with the Soviet Union in assisting backward
peoples to a fuller life, we have tended to rebuff the Soviet Union
for her interest in such areas, and then, ignoring the ferment of the
peoples in them, we have all too often gone on to give financial and
