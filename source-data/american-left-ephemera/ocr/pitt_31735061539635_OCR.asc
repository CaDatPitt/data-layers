infuriated Meany. He often makes speeches, issues statements and
writes articles, repeating the slanderous attacks upon the Soviet
trade unions. =

During my stay in the USSR I received a copy of one such
article by Meany in the February, 1959 issue of the AFL—CIO
Fedemtionist. The article is purportedly an answer to Trud, daily
oﬂicial paper of the Soviet trade unions. Though mainly directed
at the seven-year plan, it is actually a summary of the line of
anti-Soviet propaganda the trade union leaders have peddled for
many years. While the object o-f this pamphlet is to give a report
on what we have seen in the USSR, we present much of it as an
answer to Meany’s article on what he sees in the USSR—from an
ofﬁce in Washington. Let the record speak!

Finally, we want to warn against a mechanical comparison of
unions in the capitalist U.S.A. with unions of Socialist USSR. We
will point to many achievements of the USSR’s unions. Thereby,
however, we do not suggest that all of those achievements can be
duplicated in a -capitalist country. Some of them are clearly the
product of only a socialist system.

Unfortunately, there are people in the labor movement whose
anti-Soviet prejudice also twists -their reasoning. They ‘compare
conditions in the United States and in ‘the USSR without taking
account of the trend and pace of development in the two coun-
tries. .At the time the 1917 revolution occurred, Russia was the
most backward of the world’s major countries while the United
States was economically the most advanced. Since 1917, the Soviet
Union’s progress was interrupted and thrown back by long periods
of civil war, -followed by invasion of troops of allied Western pow-
ers. Later came the prolonged Nazi invasion and o-ccupation. In
contrast to the tremendous destruction of lives and property in
the USSR, United States economy did not suffer. It was stimu-
lated by the wars.

Another unfair line of comparison comes from those who ignore
the difference in the systems of the two countries. In the Soviet
Union there are no capitalists or landlords, or other typesof private
owners of the industries. The industrial and farm producers, the
professional, science and service people of the country, are them-
selves the masters of their economy and society. There is no con-

ﬂict between «classes such as exists in the United States. There
is just a division of responsibility and function within a society
united by a common outlook and objective.

But strangely some of the trade union leaders of America, while
denying there is a class struggle in the United States and discourag-
ing the use of such weapons as strikes or demonstrations, are loudly
calling for strikes and “militancy” in the lands of socialism. In the
article of Meany under review, he appeals to the Soviet workers
to “struggle militantly” for higher wages. But how does Meany
speak to American workers? A

On December, 1955, when the AFL and CIO merged, he pro-
posed through an article in the New York Times Magazine, amidst
much fanfare, a “mutual non-aggression agreement” between or-
ganizations, of labor and capital. The National Association of
Manufacturers lost no time in honoring him with a luncheon where
he was introduced to tell more of his no—strike plan. In the course
of his speech Meany said:

“It may interest you to know I never went on strike in
my life. I never ran a strike in my life. I never ordered
anyone to order a strike in my life. I never had anything
to do with a picket line.” ~

If Meany’s scheme for a “non-aggression” pact didn’t go
through, the reason was mainly the “militant” insistence of the

employers on anti-union terms the AFLCIO head couldn’t deliver. A

Recently, during the 1959 spring session of the AFL-CIO Ex-
ecutive Council, Meany’s attention was called to suggestions that
the labor movement meet new repressive anti-labor legislation with
nationwide strike action. Meany angrily replied:

J The AFL-CIO is dedicated to the American way of life,
and that inclu-des our American system o-f representative
government. When legislation is enacted that we don't like
then it’s our policy to seek changes through the system, not
by revolution.”_

Thus even a rotest strike is “revolution.” Clearl , these same

labor leaders who are so enthusiastic for “mi1itancy’ and strikes
in the lands where the working class rules and sees no sense in
striking against itself, frown on strikes and militancy in capitalist
lands where those weapons are truly the only recourse for the
workers.

One example to show how ridiculous it is to judge relations in
the Soviet Union in terms of employer-worker relations under capi-
talism, is the fact that in all of the USSR there isn’-t one person
in a managerial top government or professional post, or in the arts,
whose salary comes anywhere near Meany’s $35,000 a year. Nor
do any of them reach even the salaries of hundreds of U.S. labor
leaders getting substantially less than Meany, let alone those in
the $50,000 class, or George M. Harrison of the railway clerks who
for eight years topped them all with $76,000 a year.

I have met with many plant directors, some of the plants with
as many as 40,000 workers. Their salaries in most cases, including
production bonuses, don’t run much above the earnings of many
coal miners. And the salaries of full-time trade union ofﬁcials are
generally equal to what their earnings would be at their occupa-
tions on the production line.

It is shameful that labor leaders with the salaries of big cor-
poration officials, should point a ﬁnger at these leaders of Soviet

10¢,

 

 

industries and unions and slander them as a “privileged class” and
as “rulers.” It is high time the “curtain of ignorance” were opened
and American trade unionists received the right to see for them-
selves how things are in the socialist countries.

The Collective Agreement in the USSR

The real test as towhether unions are genuinely independent
and democratic, is their accomplishments in the interest of their
members, the content of their collective agreements and the au-
thority they have for enforcing it, the extent of voluntary accept-
ance of those unions by the workers, and the extent of member-
ship participation in the work of those unions.

Unions in America, as is well ‘known, bargain primarily for
wages, hoursand working conditions. Only since the late thirties
has bargaining expanded to include also some supplementary bene-
ﬁts and to spell out terms for vacations, sick leave, promotion pro-
cedure and holidays. More recently came the welfare funds and
supplementary unemployment insurance to supplement to some ex-
tent the government-provided social insurance. And only about
a third of the workers of the country are under contracts because
two-thirds of the labor force is not in unions.

Now let us look at the 52,000 collective annual agreements the
Soviet trade unions negotiated in 1957 (for the year 1958). The
agreement of each larger enterprise is available to every worker in
a printed pamphlet. It is hung up on the bulletin board in the
smaller plants. I collected a fair sampling of the printed agree-
ments while in the USSR. They cover a far wider scope than
American contracts, and the unions negotiating them have a far
greater authority, especially because of the new powers vested in
them in the past two years.

Suppose we take as a typical case the 80-page agreement for
1958, covering the 15,000 workers of the Stalingrad Tractor Plant,
which I visited. This agreement has eight sections. The ﬁrst
summarizes the common objectives of both the union and manage-
ment of the plant to carry out the country's economic plan, and
spells out in detail what that means in terms of production in the
tractor plant, the output goal in each department, productivity,

:11:

  

elimination of spoilage, quality of work. It covers also provision
by management of the technical means and plant organization to
make possible realization of those goals and, of course, higher earn-
ings for the workers that come with more production.

The second section deals with wage classiﬁcations, and other
wage matters as they apply to each occupationxin the factory. Sec-
tion 3 deals with the training of workers for higher skills and
techniques, including a second trade, even specifying the number
to be trained in the various schools, institutes and apprentice shops
attached to the factory (in this case a total of 4,200 for 1958).
Clauses even specify the amount of money to be appropriated from
the factory fund to improve and expand these schools. This is an
important item in the contract for a number of reasons, among
them -the fact that in the USSR there has always been an unin-
terrupted process of promoting workers to higher skills and classiﬁ-
cations, "hence higher wage scales, as the work force has swelled
from year to year.

Section 4 spells out discipline in the factory and the mutual
responsibility for maintaining it. Section 5, on safety and hygiene,
speciﬁes a long list of corrections that must be made or the needed
new installations for ventilation, sanitary provisions, etc., and
even the speciﬁc sums of money that should be appropriated to
assure them. Also, this section has a long list of -clauses speciﬁcally

obligating the administration -to improve or expand hospital and ‘

other medical care for the workers and the factory community as
a whole. One clause, for example, calls for expansion of accom-
modation for the plant’s night sanatorium to 500. Those sanator-
iums, attached to almost every large plant, are for workers who
may be in a partly rundown condition but not to the point of re-
quiring stoppage of work. They are taken, usually by bus after
work, directly to the night sanatorium where they rest, eat and
sleep under a doctor’s observation for a period of 30 days or longer.

Section 6 covers housing and community welfare services. This
plant's agreement obligated the administration to build more hous-
ing, with the locations in the factory community speciﬁed, to the
total of 12,000 square meters of living space in 1958 (bedrooms and
living rooms) . Then follows a long list of obligations on the part
of the administration to construct more hospital facilities, locate

12c

 

 

more nurseries and kindergartens in certain areas of the factory
-community, repair or improve the maintenance of houses already
1n use, etc., etc.

Section 7 covers shopping facilities and adequate provisioning
of the stores serving the thousands of families of the tractor work-
ers, as Well as problems affecting the plant restaurants. This sec-

tion also has provisions for parceling out of a tract of land among"

the workers as garden p1ots—a practice very widespread in the USSR
-—from which workers get much of their vegetables. The ﬁnal
section, called “Cultural Service,” obligates the administration
to some substantial improvements in the big Cultural Palace of
the workers which is serviced by a staff of 25 and has an annual
budget of 1,200,000 rubles. It calls for improvements in the work-
ers’ sport stadium, the sport house and the children’s playgrounds.

The tractor plant contract, quite typical, shows the guiding
principle is that all matters affecting working, living and cultural
conditions of the worker and his family are matters for the col-
lective agreement. In a capitalist country, no union can even
dream of dealing with most questions covered in a Soviet agree-
ment. Most of the active people in the Soviet factory union organi-
zation are occupied with one or another of the subjects covered in
the contract. On housing, for example, there is a sub—committee
on a plant-wide scale, and sub—committees in each . department.
That corps of active members is concerned with both proper ser-
vicing of the occupied houses and the distribution of the new hous-
ing -on the basis of urgency, or in accordance with the size of fam-
ily, the recommendations originating at department-wide meetings.
S0 run the chains of “actives” in the union, based upon each o-f the
other provisions of the contract——child care, protection of women
and youth, safety, production, innovation activities (suggestions-
invention), wage rates, -culture, shopping provisions, factory res-
taurants and canteens, etc., etc.

The factory collective agreement in effect applies and concre-
tizes the general national and regional terms and plans. At each
of those levels the trade unions, strongly represented in all top
organs, have a big part in the formulation of‘ the economic plans
and most certainly on matters affectingwages and working condi-
tions. Such planned economy also makes possible more uni-

13‘

 

 

  

 

formity and justice in wage rates and more order in occupational
classiﬁcations, elimination of differentials, chaos and inequities.
Those matters are subject to annual routine review. But currently
there is a more basic and drastic overhauling of rates and classiﬁca-
tions with the objective of pulling up the lowest paid workers and
lifting average earnings generally while shifting to -the seven-hour
day. This revision is being carried out by a joint union-ministry
machinery in each ﬁeld.

What union under capitalism, even under the best of leader-
ship, can even dream of such inﬂuence in determining the condi-
tions for its members? And the labor movement of the United
States has less inﬂuence in government than the unions of any
major capitalist country. At best, they depend on some “friendly”

 

politicians in either of the two parties of capitalism. They have

no direct representation in any of the branches of government. In
most states and cities the politicians do not even consult the trade
union leaders on the choice of -candidate the union members are
expected to endorse. What bothers some of our top union leaders
is not the nonsensical claim the unions of the USSR are “govern-
ment controlled,” but the exact 0pp0site———that the unions of the
USSR with their 53 million members, are the major mass organiza-
tion through which the workers exercise control of the government.

Here are some ﬁgures to show who governs the USSR:

The Supreme Soviet, the topmost two-chamber parliament of

the USSR, as elected in 1958, has 738 deputies in the Council of

the Union. Of these, 465 (63%) are workers and collective farm-
ers, 327 of them continuing to work at their occupations.

The Council of Nationalities, is composed of 640 deputies, of
whom 366 are workers and collective farmers, with 287 continuing
at their jobs.

The rest consist of working professionals, technicians, scientists,
etc., but there are no exploiters of labor in any form in the coun-
try. '
In the 1957 elections for local, regional and republic soviets
(councils) a total of 1,549,777 were elected throughout the coun-
try. Of them 950,000 are workers and collective farmers, 342,000
are representatives of youth and 573,000 are women.

The workers of the USSR don't have to organize delegations

14

 

to Moscow or any regional or state capital to lobby for what they
need.

How the Union Works

Since 1957 the unions of the USSR have received new authority
and rights in line with the general increase in worker participa-
tion in the affairs of the country and the trend towards entrance
of the Soviet Union into the ﬁrst phase of Communism by the end
of the seven-year plan. Communism is a stage higher than so-
cialism, a social order in which the organizations of the people
will more and more -take over the functions now carried out by
government. ‘On the other hand, police, military and like functions
will gradually decline as world peace is secured and the economic
or socal basis for law violations become eliminated. Eventually,
in its later stages, Communism will also replace the socialist rule
“to each according to his product” by the motto “from each ac-
cording to his ability; to each according to his need.”

Steps were already taken to relieve police and the courts of
minor law violations and misdemeanors among yo-uth and place
such violators in the custody of their unions or other organiza-
tions for trials before fellow workers. With this step, Deputy
Chief Justice Prusakov of the Russian Federative Soviet Republic
told me in an interview, a drastic cut in the country's police force
and courts was eﬂfected.

In line with this trend of greater responsibility upon the mass
organizations, the trade unions were given a*far greater part in con-
trol of production through the Permanent Production Conferences
in each enterprise, consisting of delegates from each department.
The unions were also given what amounts to a decisive authority
in the distribution of new housing. The plant committee of the
union has the ﬁnal authority to decide disputes that may arise with
management. The only recourse for the dissatisﬁed party after-the
plant commi-ttee’s decision is the courts. No worker can be ﬁred
without the consent of the plant committee.

Those rights came on top of the authority the unions already
had as the dispensers of the vast social insurance fund which in
1958 came to 215 billion rubles, and in addition to their control

15

 

  

over the vast network of resorts, tourist bases and rest homes and
a sport movement of some 50,000 societies with more than eight
million participants. At the 12th Congress of the Trade Unions
of the USSR, which I also covered for the Worker, the proposal was
even made to shift the vast network of sanatoriums from the health

eministry to the unions on the ground that their utilization would

thereby be bettered.

GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ,
ON EDUCATION, HEALTH,
PENSIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL

AND CU LTU RAL SERVICES

 

The primary and key unit in this gigantic organization of 53
million members is the plant or local .committee—a body elected
annually by secret ballot. There are 440,000 such units. They
have a great deal of autonomy and carry out the work at the enter-
prise and community level. In recent years, as reﬂected at the 12th
Congress, the trend was to give greater responsibility to the plant
committee and the regional trade union bodies. The latest change
in -the constitution of the All-Union Central Council of Trade
Unions provides for 75 per cent of the dues ruble to stay with the
primary unit, the bulk of that income to ‘be expended for cultural,
sport, welfare and children’s activities.

Much of the discussion at the trade union congress also laid

16

 

 

stress on still greater involvement of the membership in activity and
even less -dependence on full-timers. Of the 440,000 primary units,
only four percent have one or more full-time oﬂicers.

The basic outline for the work of the factory committee is the
agreement for the enterprise or ﬁeld of work, negotiated annually
and simultaneously in the entire country. The plant committee
follows through on every item in the agreement and arranges
quarterly reviews with both the plant director and union chair-
man reporting on the extent to which the pact is being carried out.
They may be in -for sharp criticism if the contract schedule falls be-
hind and measures may be taken to insure realization of the pact.

The list of subjects covered in the annual agreement sets the
pattern for responsibilities of the plant committee and its sub-
committees. The committee leads in the work of the Permanent
Production Conferences. It deals with safety and with emulation
among the workers. It checks on the work of innovators and in—
ventors and sees -that they are properly rewarded. It keeps check
on the plant restaurants. Much of the committee's routine is the
allotment from the social insurance fund of vouchers for rest
homes, sanatoriums, children's summer camps or nurseries, for
gifts for mothers of every newborn child, for sickness, mother-care
and such beneﬁts.

Another measure of the union movement’s strength in the Soviet
Union is the vast resources at its disposal for carrying out its cul-
tural, sport and recreation programs. The AUCCTU, at the last
count, had 11,00-0 Palaces of Culture or clubs, 115,000 smaller
“red corners,” 18,000 libraries, more than 11,000 ﬁlm projectors,
1,156 sport stadiums, 1,193 sport halls or palaces, 3,408 sport pa-
vilions, 653 waterfront sport bases, 1,186 ski jumps, and many
more such facilities.

Take, for example, the 11,000 Palaces of Culture and clubs.
They are not small affairs. I went through a number of them.
They are usually big centers serving thousands of men, women
and children daily. It costs millions of rubles to construct‘ and
then operate each of those centers. There are many palaces staffed
by a score or more persons plus an equal number of art, dance and
music instructors. In such immense palaces like that of the Licha-
chov auto plant in Moscow, the Stalingrad tractor plant or the tex-

17

  
 
 

tile plant of Tashkent, there is ‘a choice of scores upon scores of
after-work or after-school amateur activities the worker can take
up. At Lichachov there are many studios for painting, sculpture,
sketching, music (with several adult and children's orchestras and
choruses), ballets, drama, photo circles, sewing, chess, star-gazing
(they have an observatory), model making of all kinds in fully-
equipped workshops, numerous educational circles, literature dis-
cussions, stamp clubs, ﬁlm and stage shows, and dances every
Saturday night. The union pays for the entire upkeep, including
the supplies, charging only admission for dances and ﬁlm shows.
A large percentage of the USSR’s stage and art personalities showed
their talents ﬁrst in such clubs and were recommended to conserva-
tories or drama schools by the unions. A measure of the size of
this movement can be obtained from the following in the report of
Victor Grishin, the president, to the 12th Congress of the AUCCTU:

“At the present time we have 216,000 amateur art groups, in
which 4,000,000 people are taking part. Amateur theatres, sym-
phony orchestras, choirs, opera and ballet groups have grown in
numbers. Last year these collectives gave 770,000 concerts and
shows which were attended by nearly 160,000,000 working people.”

The AUGCTU is converting the best of these groups into
permanent amateur workers’ theatres.

At Kostov, I saw them completing construction of a Palace
of the Agricultural Machinery workers that bids to be the grand-
est of them all, at a cost of 14 million rubles.

It comes with ill grace for American unionists to sneer at the
Soviet trade unions. Our trade union movement doesn’t have
one such culture hall—nor even one that could compare with
a moderate-sized Soviet club. That’s what I had to tell the di-
rector of the immense, beautiful newly-built culture palace of one
of the mines in the city of Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, after he toured
me through it and asked, “how does this compare with your
trade union culture palaces?” In the East Ukraine mining town
of Shakhty I saw a sport palace that cost 8.5 million rubles to
build.

How are the Soviet trade unions received by the workers?
To what extent are the masses of workers participating in their
life? First it should be noted that the 440,000 primary (local and

13

Q-7-T OBI-sin-cu

plant) units hold elections every year for oﬂicers and their sub-
committees. The emphasis is on a maximum of initiative for
those local units and on the widest possible democracy. An even
greater extension of such democracy was the central theme of the
10-day congress of the AUCCTU held in March, 1959. I have
attended many trade union conventions in the United States. But
I have yet to hear such sharp "criticism and public exposure of
cases of violation of democratic procedures, as I heard from
Victor Grishin, the president, in his report, and from others ‘in
the discussion. They spotlighted some prize examples and they
were merciless.

The 22 general unions, with their central committees, have an
authority in their respective ﬁelds on a national scale. Each of
the autonomous republics or districts have a union center. Then
come the regional sub-divisions. Those centers exercise a leader-
ship within their scope, but it is the primary unit at the plant,
local or government farm that carries out the tasks.

The top authority in the enterprise is the membership meet-
ing. A delegates’ conference is highest in the large plant. The
top elected authority is the plant shop committee whose mem-
bership is usually related to the size of the plant. Most of those
I studied had more than 20 members. In the larger depart-
mentalized plants, a department or factory unit committee is
elected in each department.

The plant committee elects sub—committees. Each of these
covers one or more items in the annual agreement it is charged
to handle. In some large plants, there are as many as a score
of such sub-committees, and there are usually from 10 to 15
persons on each. The department committees also have sub-
committees.

The lowest subdivision in the plant is the trade union group
organization. It is based on the workteam whose number may go
as high as 25 or 30, or maybe considerably lower, depending on
the work system. The team names an organizer (somewhat like
our steward) and three assistants, usually for social insurance,
safety and production problems. The group organizer collects the
dues directly from each worker. They have no checkoff system
and no requirement for obligatory payment of dues or membership.

19

   

Nevertheless, 51,780,000 workers—96% of the 54.6 million workers
in 1958—b-elonged to the unions. Most of the plants I visited
had a unionization level of 98 per cent or higher. .

.Multiply the above machinery 440,000 times and you have an
idea of the colossal network that makes up the Soviet trade union
movement. Ninety-six per cent of these primary units have no
full-time officers. The other four per cent have from one to
six. The limits are set by the AUCCTU, depending on the
number of workers in an enterprise. A garment factory of 900
workers I visited in Moscow had only one full-timer—the chair-
man. A

-Grishin reported to the 12th Congress that -the number of
plant and shop committee members now totals 3.5 million. There
are 1,380,000 -group organizers. Then there is a total of 7,000,000
members in the permanent -commissions, as well as functionaries
in various ‘ﬁelds, like insurance and safety. The bulk of the
7,000,000 delegates to the permanent production conferences
are production workers. A Soviet handbook on statistics says that
at the start of 1958 there were 16,457,000 “actives” in the trade
union movement of the USSR, about as many as there are members
in the trade unions of the U.S.

Another statistical indicator of the active spirit in the USSR’s
unions is the 1.5 million workers who took the ﬂoor at discussions
on proposals for the 1958 collective agreement. They made more
than 2,000,000 proposals.

Those general statistics seemed bunbe1ievable—espe-cially to an
American—because in our unions, it is considered “good” if an
average of ten per cent of the membership as much as come to
membership meetings. But when I later visited the plants and
questioned the plant -committee members on the degree of partici-
pation, the overall statistics were fully conﬁrmed. They gave me
detailed breakdowns on the plant “active” showing usually from
20 to 25 per cent of the plant workers involved in some responsi-
bility.

Some may question whether all of the large number given a
responsibility are truly active. The Soviet trade union leaders
are the ﬁrst to draw a distinction between those who carry out their
responsibilities well and those who don't. But it should be noted

20

 

 

that it is not so easy to shirk a responsibility in the Soviet trade.
union setup. There is a very active spirit generally and there is, in
fact, competition for posts. Furthermore, almost every function, no
matter how small, is closely related to life in the factory and com-
munity, and subject to the pressures from all sides involving hun-
dreds of matters. T.-hen,‘they have the custom of turning the guns
of criticism on shirkers-—and that custom goes down to the team
unit.

It need hardly be said here that this high level of participation
and activi<ty—a living democracy—has provided the base for a
remarkable type of leader—a type you meet everywhere at the
enterprise level. To qualify for the post of plant committee
chairman or other ofﬁce, or leadership in the factory Communist
Party unit, a person must ‘be very alert and energetic. He must
be resourceful, well versed in the many problems facing the
workers, in the techniques of production, and in the numerous
social problems affecting the workers’ families in the entire com-
munity—cultural, sport, housing, school and others. They seem
to have hammered out thousands upon thousands of such expert
live wires in work clothes, because you meet them everywhere.

Such a high level of worker activity cannot be expected un-
der capitalist conditions. But it seems to me that a study of the
Soviet ways to attract workers to activity could help Americans
achieve at least an improvement in that respect. I recall that on
one occasion at a press conference with Meany in 1957, he com-
plained to newsmen of the very low attendance at U.S. union
membership meetings. He conceded that such indifference to
union affairs gives the corrupt racketeer elements a free hand
to take over unions.

Meany blamed television, night ball games and such attractions.
But he steered clear of the well-known fact that our predominantly
conseravtive union leaders dislike the pressures of an active mem-
bership and are happy if they stay away from meetings. In any
case, American unionists should be the last in the world to shout
that Soviet unions are “not real.” ‘

Another measure of the -democracy in the USSR was the report
by Nikita Khrushchev to the 21st Congress that the draft for the
seven-year plan was discussed prior to that congress at 968,000

meetings, attended by 7o,ooo,ooo persons of whom 4,672,000 took
the ﬂoor for criticism or suggestions. At the factories and farms I
visited, I learned that such degree of participation in the discus-
sion did, indeed, take place. And those discussions were not of a
general nature, because each region and each factory had already
prepared a plan concretized for their respective area. ‘

Economy at New High

In his article, George Meany charges that the Soviet economy
is i.n a critical condition such as “had more serious implica-
tions . . . than the recent recession in our country had for American
economic development.” For that reason the Soviet Union “was
forced to abandon the sixth ﬁve-year plan.” Then, to “hide this
abandonment and retreat, the Krem1in’s new so-called seven-year
plan now speaks only of ‘control ﬁgures for the development of the
national economy for 1959-65.’ ” What is more, says Meany, t.l1e
Soviet economy has been “slowing down” in its growth. Meany
further challenges the fact, well known and conceded in the
Western World, that the pace of Soviet economic growth has been
the most rapid in history. He says czarist Russia in the eighties
and nineties had a pace of growth equal to the USSR’s. ‘

Meany it is apparent is in quite a difficulty. He is an ardent
upholder of the capitalist system and its chief labor spokesman.
For many years he and his associates in the leadership of the AFL
and CIO have damned socialism and called the Soviet Union a
“slave" society. But it is diﬂicult to make such attacks in face of
the truth on Soviet progress breaking out to the world. Much of
this truth has been brought to the American public by prominent
persons not friendly to the USSR, like Mrs. Roosevelt, Adlai
Stevenson and others with high reputations in trade union ranks.
On the other hand, the capitalism these labor leaders praise so
highly has experienced three economic crises within a decade. The
latest crisis left ﬁve million unemployed, the majority of whom
remained workless even when recovery was supposed to be in
bloom.

What are the facts? The average growth of the USSR economy
in each of the years 1956, 1957 and 1958—the ﬁrst three of the

22

 

 

 

sixth ﬁve-year plan—was 1o yrercent. In agriculture the annual
growth was seven to eight percent. No capitalist country experi-
enced such a high rite of growth. The United States, experiencing
also a drof. during that period, had ‘an average yearly growth of
only about two percent. A ﬁve-fold higher rate of growth than the
U.S. is no “crisis.”

But suppose we refer to the AFL-CIO’s own analyses, prepared
for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and submitted to it
by Walter Reuther, chairman of the AFL-CIO Economic Policy
Committee on Feb. 9, 195g——the very month when Meany’s article
was published. That report is highly recommended in a foreword
by George Meany himself. It is AFL-CIO Publication No. 37, titled
Policies for Economic Growth.

The report paints a dismal picture of the economic slump and
its serious effect on the living standards of working people and,
in effect, proves how capitalism retards economic growth. The
report then says:

“In recent weeks and months, we have been forced to recognize
that in certain areas of scientiﬁc achievement and the military
potential flowing from it, the United States no lo; ger enjoys the

   

I='__:.

 

23

 

 
 

commanding lead we once enjoyed over the Soviet Union. Even in
terms of general economic strength, although we are still ahead,
the Communists are rapidly closing the gap between us.”

And further: a

“But economic growth in the Soviet Union is advancingifour
or ﬁve times as fast as our lagging economy has grown in recent
years. If both economies continue simply to grow at the same pace
as they have grown respectively since 1950, it will be a mere 17
or 18 yearsuntil Soviet production can match and surpuss ours in.
volume, and from that point forward it is they who will threaten
to take a commanding lead.”

The AFLJCIO estimate is not too far olf from that of Khrush-
chev, who says it may take 12 years. But what is the AFL-CIO
holding out as a perspective for advance for the U.S.? The report
says:

“Given favorable economic conditions, our productivity at the
present time should be increasing at a rate in the neighborhood of
four percent per year. Add to this the eﬁects of population growth,
and our economy should be expanding at the very least, at a rate
of ﬁve percent per year. A rate close to that was achieved during
the period from 1947 to 1953, but from 1953 through 1958 the
annual rate of growth has averaged closer to one and one half
percent.” -

The report goes into many pages to document the above asser-
tions. How then can Meany in the very same month write of a
Soviet f‘slowdown,” “crisis” and “retreat” and publish the AFL-
CIO’s own analyses proving the exact opposite?

Something did, however, happen in the Soviet Union to cause
the combination of the two remaining years of the sixth ﬁve-year
plan and the new plan into one. The Soviet Union discovered new
sources of economic strength an-d possibilities for far greater
advances than had already been achieved. The opening of the vast
areas of virgin and unused lands for exploitation have proven
successful beyond the most optimistic expectations.

The organization of the economy so as to give regions and
republics greater opportunities for initiative was very much justi-
ﬁed by the results.

The reorganization of agriculture and the sale of the equip-

24

 

 

ment of machine and tractor stations to collective farms to operate
themselves, proved equally successful and an added stimulus to
people’s initiative.

Natural gas in vast quantities was discovered in Uzbekistan
and other areas, causing a big change in fuel resources and laying
the base for a swift rise in the chemical and plastics industries.

The richest deposits of iron ore in the world were found in
the very heart of European Russia.

Trade with capitalist countries, although still far short of pos-
sibilities, swung upward substantially in recent years. The balance
in the world moved signiﬁcantly in favor of maintenance of peace.

V Most important of all, the fresh surge of popular initiative
and enthusiasm sweeping the USSR today—something most strik-
ing to a visitor-——provides a reserve that even the planners could
not fully estimate. V

The level of the sixth ﬁve-year plan was, therefore, short of the
full possibilities. Moreover, the Soviet Union was already looking
towards its longer-range plan and perspective for the next, higher
stage of devel0pment—the ﬁrst phase of communism.

This preparatory phase for entry into communism envisages
the -following, as Khrushchev put it at the 21st Congress:

“ . . . the Soviet Union will after fulﬁlling the (seVen—year)
plan, surpass the United States for physical output in some key
items and draw near to America’s present level of «output in others.
By that time the output of major agricultural products, both
physical and per head of population, will exceed the present U.S.
1evel.” ’

Khrushhcev noted however, that the population of the USSR
will continue to be higher than America’s by 15 to 20 percent.

“Hence if we reckon per head of population, it will probably

25

 

 

  

 
 

 

take us another ﬁve years after completing the seven-year plan to
catch up and surpass the United States in industrial production.”

How can anyone call such a situation a “crisis” for the Soviet
Union? But Meany does not stop with this. He observes that the

 

annual growth projected in the seven-year plan is 8.6 percent. .

Meany compares that to a growth of 26 percent in 1948, 23% in
1950, 16% in 1951, 11% in 1956 and 10% in 1957, and sees a
steady decline, hence the “crisis” in USSR economy.

The distortion comes from comparison to the years when the
USSR was mainly restoring war-shattered plants. In some cases
plants were down for want of just certain machines or because of
only‘ partial destruction. Revival in such situations was fast and

the percentage-wise rise in that period was abnormally high. But

essentially the economy was being restored to the pre-war level
or just passing that level. The more realistic rate of growth was
during the period since 1955 when it averaged 10% annually. It
is therefore plain nonsense to say, as Meany does, that “the rate of
growth in 1957 was 60 percent less than in the early postwar years.”

But why does Meany limit himself to percentage calculations
in this case? I/Vhy doesn’t he give the physical ﬁgures? These would
refute ‘his “declining growth” theory. V/Vhat does one percent of
the economy of the USSR mean today in comparison, say, with
1932, the last year of the ﬁrst ﬁve-year plan? Khrushchev answered
that one at the 21st Congress. He said in 1932 “a one percent in-
crease in industrial output amounted, in present day prices, to
about 800 million rubles, while in 1965, according to the plan, one
percent will amount to upward of 19 billion rubles.”

Other calculations of Soviet statisticians show that in 1965 one
percent will be equal to the volume of the entire economy of
Czarist Russia in 1913 or the economy of the Soviet Union in the
late twenties just prior to the start of the ﬁrst ﬁve-year plan. In
1958 the economy was 36 times the level of 1913. In 1965, accord-
ing to plan, it will rise to 65 times 1913.

But Meany is doomed to even greater disappointment. The
ﬁrst half of 1959, now on the seven-year plan, showed a rise of
12 per cent over the same half in 1958. With that kind of
“crisis,” the Soviet Union may overtake the U.S. sooner than is
called for in the indicated time table.

26

 

Meany also uses some ﬁgures that are false on their face. In
one of the major ﬁelds where the Soviet Union has already sur-
passed the United States—-in coal—Meany gives U.S. production as
476,842,000 tons against 303,000,000 tons for the Soviet Union.
Even from capitalist sources, like the New York Times, Meany
could have learned that the USSR’s production in 1958 was 496
million t0ns——20 mlillion above the U.S.

This is not an accidental error. In the US-SR there are no
chronically depressed areas with hundreds of thousands of persons
depending on surplus government food, such as are scattered
throughout the coal ﬁelds of the United States. In the USSR there
isn't one unemployed coal miner although mechanization is at a
fast pace. The coal miners of the Soviet Union, working the year
round, are among the highest paid people in the country. More-
over, as I observed, in the city of Shakhty, the Soviet miners have
all the facilities of life and culture, and all the comforts of workers
in the metropolitan centers. Soviet miners were shocked when, as
I was looking over a fully-equipped hospital several blocks from
a mine entrance, I noted that in the U.S. many wives of miners
give birth with the aid of midwives because ho-spitals are many
miles away from many of the mining towns. I also told them I
heard miners speak at mine union conventions of the loss of life
and limbs because of the scandalous absence of hospitals in vast
stretches of the mine country. The Soviet miners were equally
appalled on hearing of our high accident and fatality rate in the
mines. In the USSR, with more coal came a better life for the
diggers; in the U.S., as is well known, with more coal came chronic
depression in the coal ﬁelds.

On USSR electric energy production, Meany gives 192 billion
kilowat hours. Production for 1958 was actually 233 billion KWH,
(which he could have also learned from the New York Times.)
In addition, Meany sees a “retreat” in the USSR’s shift of em-
phasis to steam turbines for quicker results to meet the seven-year
time table. He does not say that the USSR is also producing the
world’s most powerful steam turbines. They are working on
400,000 kilowat steam turbines and plan to go as high as 600,000
kilowatts. But from Meany’s article, an uninformed reader may get
the idea that the USSR is a failure in hydroelectric power station

construction and won't build them any more. He speciﬁcally men-
tions the Krasnoyarsk roject as “abandoned.” i

In his report, Khrushchev said “to win time” stronger emphasis
is put on turbines operated by cheap coal or -gas, but:

“Parallel with t.he commissioning of thermal power stations
(which take less time to build—G.M.) provision is made for the con-
struction of hydropower stations: Bratsk with a capacity of
3,600,000 kilowatts; Stalingrad with a capacity of 2,530,000 kilo-
watts; Krasnoyarsk with 4,200,000 kilowatts; Kremenchug with
625,000 kilowatts; Votkinsk, 1,000,000 kilowatts and several others.”

At Stalingrad’s project they told me two turbines are already
working. And when I visited the Leningrad Metal Works they
were working on 20 more turbines for Stalingrad. Near Kuybishev
I visited the great Volga station, the ‘biggest in the world, now in
full operation.

The plain fact that cannot be explained away is the tremen-
dous objectives of the seven-year plan which, as they told me
almost everywhere I went, most parts of the USSR count on achiev-
ing in six years or even less. They include:

Capital investment for the seven years to total two trillion in
industry and nearly another trillion from collective farmers and
other sources. This will equal the capital investments of all the
41 years of the USSR preceding the latest plan. Total industrial
output is to rise 80% in seven years.

Heavy industry is to go up 85-88 percent, consumer goods
production 62-65 percent.

space built in the previous seven ‘years. It is to provide 15,000,000
urban apartments and 7,000,000 rural homes;-I

To T1'ud’s assertion that the U.S. economy is “gravely sick and
its disease is chronic” and that a “most serious crisis"’ is again in
the making, Meany conﬁdently replied that “the recession is almost
over.” He cited statistics which indeed showed the economy “re-
covered.” And he further =boasted labor productivity “is now in-
creasing at a rapid rate—per‘haps as much as six percent a year.”
He made this boast at the very moment when unions afﬁliated
with the AFL-CIO were clamoring for government action on un-
employment, which official statistics then put at nearly 5,000,000.
As for high labor productivity, every Worker now knows that much
of the increase in labor productivity is a product of the automa-
tion spree in the past several years which only speeded the country
to the crisis. Recovery statistics are no comfort to millions who
remain jobless.

The real question U.S. labor leaders should answer is why in
the short period of a decade America experienced three crises
with unemployment ranging from four to 5.5 million. In the
S-oviet Union I didn’t see a sign of unemployment. I met grand-
parents who hadn't known unemployment all their lives. And,
incidentally, the seven-year plan calls for the addition of 12 mil-
lion workers to the industrial labor force.

During my visit to the Moscow Ballbearing Plant, widely
acknowledged even in the West as one of the most automated
plants in the world, I asked the manager. whether, as a result of
still further automation plans, the factory may throw some work-
ers out of their jobs. He laughed and noted that the plant’s em-
ployment increased parallel with automation because there is no
limit on the demand for ball and roller bearings. “We’d sell
tomorrow twice as much as we produce today,” he said.

Living S-tandards—-Capitalist and Socialist

On the question of living standards, Meany gives the standard
statistics on the millions of (mortgaged) home owners and many
millions of refrigerators, ‘I'V sets, washing machines and automo-

29

 

biles in use in the U.S.A. He also boasts of the high wages,
although many CIO-AFL aﬂiﬂiates were then pressing for wage
increases to meet the rise in prices. ‘

The discovery that living standards in the U.S., on the whole,
are higher than in the Soviet Union isn’t new. We might add they
are also very much higher than in England, France and other
lands where industrial development once topped the U.S. As
Khrushchev noted, the USSR doesn't expect to come up to U.S.
living standards for possibly seven to 12 years. The Soviet worker
knows it, too. But it is false to make a mathematical comparison
of pay envelopes without regard for all factors that enter into a
living standard, including the historical background and the trend
and pace of development.

Most striking to a visitor to the Soviet Union is the big per-
centage of the average family budget that is not reflected in the
pay envelope, and that portion keeps rising steadily. It is esti-
mated those government-subsidized beneﬁts and allowances amount
to some 40 percent on top of what each worker averages in money.
Khrushchev noted that the seven-year plan calls for an increase
of the social insurance -funds and construction of new housing,
nurseries, hospitals, schools and other such welfare needs to the
amount of 4,600 more rubles annually per worker. That's just one
of the forms in which the worker gets an increase in his living
standard. The others are the uninterrupted annual increases in
money wages and the decline in certain prices.

In America when we judge a pay envelope we have in mind
that out of it must be covered everything one expects to get—and
prices are subject to what production and sale for proﬁt can
squeeze out of the consumer. But in the USSR there is much the
family gets without pay or for a mere token payment. Let’s ex-
amine some of those items:

Rent, as Khrushchev noted in his report, runs about 4-5% of
a family’s income, including utilities and services. My inquiries
at the factories conﬁrmed this estimate. Occupants of several homes
‘showed me their monthly statements, itemizing their cost for gas,
light, hot water, fuel, services and rent. Often the last item was
less than the total of the others. By comparison with our standards
.of 25 to 30 percent of wages for just housing, it appears to me the

30

 

Soviet people don't really pay rent—but just for maintenance
repair and utilities. The initial cost of constructing the homes is
borne by the government. This presumption is further supported
by the fact that when, as happens to more than 23,000 Soviet
citizens on an average daily, a worker transfers to a new apart~
ment, he pays the same rent per square meter he paid in the old
place. He may pay a little more—and is most happy to do it-
because he gets more square meters. A Soviet family, therefore,
may have quite a long wait until the keys are obtained for a new
apartment—an apartment that would rent in New York for from
$90 to $120 monthly—-but the rent would continue to be as low
as it was, usually 1.32 rubles per square meter. r

Medical care, hospitalization, surgery, etc., is absolutely with-
out charge in the Soviet Union. Only the cost of medicine is borne
by the “patient, and at times that, too, is given at the clinic.

Sick beneﬁt runs 100 percent of wages if the illness is due to the
occupation. If it is due to other causes, the range is 90 percent of
salary ‘for workers 12 years or more on the job, graduating down-
ward to a minimum of ﬁfty percent of salary for those three years
or less on the job.

The birth of a baby costs absolutely nothing, nor is there va
charge for care of the mother before and after birth. And as
American health authorities have often observed, Soviet maternity
service and medical service in general, especially their emphasis
on prevention of illness, is on a high level. The number of doc-
tors per ten thousand persons was 17 in 1957. It was 12.1 per ten
thousand in the U.S. in 1955.

Nor does a working woman lose pay while giving birth. ;The
law provides 112 calendar days 017 before and after birth, with
full pay; longer if twins are born or if the birth was difficult. She
retains her credits on the j-ob even if she chooses to stay out a
whole year. Also, the social insurance fund provides for a gift to
every mother at birth—a layette presented by the union.

On returning to work, the mother can place her baby in the

 

ﬁactory nursery and get a total of an hour oﬂ‘ daily with pay, to‘

breast-feed the child. She can continue the child in the nursery to
age three, with the small charge only for the cost‘ of food. After
three, she can transfer the child to the factory or neighborhood

3.1

 

  

   

kindergarten, also at a very trivial cost, until age seven—the start- ll
ing age in school. When at school, t‘he~~child can go to one of the , 5'
many Pioneer Houses or Culture Palaces to engage in after-school
activities, recreation or sports, under professional supervision.

I have been to some of the nurseries, kindergartens and Pioneer
Homes, and I understand why Mrs. Roosevelt was so impressed
with them. The expertly managed nursery of 286 children at
Tashkent’s Agricultural Machinery Works was staffed by 32 per-
sons. A nursery like that, if by rare chance there should be one
within reach, would cost a mother at least a third of her earnings
in this country. If a mother desires, the child stays in the child
care center all week, taken home only weekends. That choice‘ is
given everywhere. The cost? From about one to two days’ pay for
the month.’ .

After the first two children, parents receive government allow-
ances for each subsequentchild; a sum of 200 rubles for the third;
650 plus 40 rubles monthly to age ﬁve for the fourth; then
amounts for each child ranging upward to a maximum of 2,500
ru‘bles and 150 monthly for the tenth and those after. There are
millions (3-4 million in 1957) in the USSR for whom such allowance
are a substantial part of the family budget.

A minimum of two weeks vacation with pay is provided by
law, with millions of workers in occupations that rate from three
to as many as six weeks because they are in underground, chemical
or other hot or hard occupations.

Millions of vacation, sanatorium, rest home and tourist camp
vouchers are issued annually to Soviet workers for a price of only
30 percent of cost——go rubles for two weeks usually—the rest paid
out of social insurance. In the past ﬁve years, the 12th AUCCTU
Congress was told, 26 million factory and office workers received
such vouchers. A portion of the vouchers, usually a 10% allowance,
is given out free to workers with large families, in lower pay
brackets, or as awards to the best workers and unionists. Thus the
cost per va-cation accommodation is on an average about ten per
cent of monthly pay for two weeks compared to a week's earnings
per week of stay at a U.S. resort.

The same applies on accommodations for Pioneer summer
camps for children aged 10 to 14 or for summer kindergartens and

nurseries. The Lichachev auto plant in Moscow, for example,

\ sent in 1958- 4,000 children to Pioneer camps and another 2,000
in the below-seven group to other camps at the cost of 90 rubles a

‘month for 50 percent; free for ten percent; 186 rubles (for the
higher-paid) for 40 percent. In the past ﬁve years, the 12th Con-
gress was told, 14 million children were sent to such summer or
winter" camps from factories. 1 P

All education including higher education is free in the Soviet
Union. Moreover, the student in college is paid a stipend out of
social insurance funds, starting with 300 rubles monthly and run-
ning to as high as 800 ruble-s, depending on the course and uni-
versity and academic record. —

Pensions in the Soviet Union come much closer to a worker's
average earnings, around 70%, than beneﬁts in the United States.
Pensions start at 100% of earnings for those with lowest wages
(350 rubles) and graduate downward in percentage but upward in
money, to 50 percent of average earnings of 1,000 rubles monthly
or more. Thus no one gets below 50% of earnings. In addition
there is another ten percent for the workers who have had a
continuous 15-year record of work, plus another ten percent for
one dependent, 15 percent for two dependents. A man can go on
pension at 60, a woman at 55. Workers in underground work can
go on pension at 50; women in those ﬁelds, (of whom there were
some during the war) at 45. Women who gave birth to ﬁve or
more children and brought them up to age ﬁve, are entitled to go
on pension at 50. Pensions of 100 percent are paid for disability
due to occupational reasons. And the Soviet‘ worker doesn’t pay a
kopek for social security, while in the U.S. the weekly tax deducted
for that purpose is 2.5 percent of wages.

Taxes on income run considerably lower in the Soviet Union
than in the United States. Nothing is paid up to 370 rubles of
monthly pay; from about 5% for 500 rubles, taxes graduate up-
ward to around eight percent of 1,000 rubles monthly. Not until
earnings come to 1,600 rubles do they reach ten percent. This
below 10% range covers the overwhelming majority of the people.
But in several years taxes are to be abolished altogether, the 21st7_
Congress was told.

Transportation costs are a very small factor in a family's

3.3

 

budget. Most workers live within blocks of their place of work in
the plant’s housing community. Also, bus, subway and streetcar
fare in the Soviet Union is much lower than here. .

Recreation, amusement and cultural costs run much lower for
the Soviet people than for those of capitalist lands. As’ we have
already noted, the cultural life and amusement of millions of
Soviet workers’ families is at their Palace of Culture or factory
club. This includes both a high level of amateur entertainment,
dances, ﬁlm shows, etc., and -frequently performances by top pro-
fessional people. The Soviet worker also has easier and much
cheaper access to the regular legitimate theatres, of which there
are many more in the USSR than in the U.S. Books and period-
icals cost the Soviet worker only a fraction of what the compara-
tive price would be in the U.S.

The claims of American newspaper correspondents that they
ﬁnd Soviet life “drab” is amusing "to Soviet people. Visitors who
look for Broadway lights, all-night taverns, “girlie shows” or caba-
rets of the New York or Paris type, are certainly disappointed.
The visitors don’t go to the culture palaces. But most Soviet people
have a different idea of what constitutes culture and entertainment
—and they have far more than Americans get of any entertainment
and culture.

There are other factors. Millions of Soviet workers eat their
main meals at the factory restaurants at a very low cost. The res-
taurants are designed to relieve people of much if not all home
cooking. They are on the highest standard in the country, serving
full course dinners or suppers. At the Rostov agricultural machin-
ery plant there -are 16 such full-scale restaurants and an even larger
number of canteens. The plant operates a giant farm just to pro-
vide meat, vegetables and dairy products for the plant restaurants.

Soviet plans call for a still further extension and improvement of

such public feeding. Another aspect of this plan is expansion of
prepared and part-cooked meals to relieve the housewife of work.

Still another form, both to meet needs and the traditional
love of gardens among the Soviet people, is the widespread trend
of garden plots. Factories acquire land and distribute it free
among their workers to cultivate and put to fruits or vegetables.
The workers are aided with seeds and saplings. You see these
plots on the outskirts of towns everywhere, each with a cottage to
store equipment or supplies. I even saw hot-houses operated on
factory grounds as at a piano factory in Rostov, to provide vege-
tables for the plant restaurant tables in winter.

But most important of all the factors that enter into the budget
is the security and economic peace of mind enjoyed by the Soviet
worker. To one coming from a land that experienced three crises
in a decade and many seasonal layoffs in between for millions of
workers, this is impressive. In the Soviet Union every family has a
plan -because it can plan. The minimum income for the year to
come is fully known and secure. There is no economic fear as far
as sickness or disability is concerned. There is no need to worry or
save to provide a higher education for children. Then there is that
feeling of conﬁdence in the future—something you don’t see among
people in capitalist lands——that -comes from long experience; the
knowledge that every year brings progress in the form of higher
wages, lower prices, opportunities to buy things that weren't avail-
able the year before. The Soviet citizens are saving, however, at a
phenomenal rate. In 1958 savings accounts totaled 87 billion, each
account averaging 2,000 rubles—about two months pay.

At each plant I visited they told me of their average earnings.
The average of those plants is about 900 rubles monthly— a little

35

2:“. _;.t...,. .4...J..«,g’..§...«.,_‘_. ._.. ~‘_‘ .5; ~ — — _ “W A g _ __ _A_

  

less in the textile, garment or shoe plants, a little more at the
metal plants; substantially above that in the mines. Almost all
families have two or more working. From what the workers tell
you it appears that about a third of a family’s income goes for
food. ' '

The budget items we listed above, including housing, medical
care, income taxes, sick leave, vacation, child and mother care,
higher education and cultural needs, are covered by probably less
than 20 percent of the Soviet w0rker’s goo rubles. But those items
may take as much as 60 percent of the American worker’s budget.
This also explains why Soviet workers have so_much to spend and
why, to the amazement of tourists, shopping crowds are so immense
in the Soviet cities. This real comparison also shows how utterly.
false it is to mechanically compare a socialist country’s pay envelope
against that of a capitalist country, or to take at sampling of prices
on some store items in the Soviet Union as a basis for \comparison,
as the U.S. Labor Department and the AFL-CIO leaders have been
doing. .

It should be also noted that in the USSR there are no “moon-
lighters” or holders of a second or even third job, of which the
Labor Department says there were 4,000,000 in the U.S. before the
last crisis hit. There is very little overtime work. And there is no
“summer wor ” tradition for students nor after-school jobs. Nor
have I seen kids selling newspapers on the streets, or anything of
the sort.

Average real wages, in money, according to Soviet data, more
than doubled in 1958 over 1940. Figures on national income and
retail sales fully conﬁrm that estimate.

The seven-year plan envisages a rise in living standards by an
average of 40 percent; Of this, 26% will be in wage raises, the rest
through bigger allowances for social insurance purposes. This is to
be accomplished along with a cut in hours, with transfer to the
seven-hour day to be completed in 1959 in all heavy industries; by
1960 in all light industries. By 1962 the transfer to the 40-hour
week is to be completed. Starting in 1964, the workers in under-
ground work, now on 36 hours, will shift to the 20-hour week and
other workers to the 35-hour week. At most of the plants I visited,

they had already gone over partly or fully to seven hours, six hours
Saturday, 41 hours weekly. Khrushchev, after detailing the per-
spective on living standards, said:

“Let the critics of our plan name a single capitalist country that
intends to expand popular consumption on so large a scale as our
country! Let them name a bourgeois state contemplating a reduc-
tion of the working day, with the same or even higher wages!”

This is, indeed, a timely challenge because nowhere is the
need of a shorter workday as keenly felt as in the U.S. Those who
boast so much of high American wage rates evade the fact that
our “average" living standard is based only on those who work
steadily. Not taken into account are the unemployed millions and
the steadily rising heap of human beings scrapped by the capitalist
system and made “unemployable.” Those boasters who see only
dollars vs. rubles, leave entirely out of account the fact that some
four millions unemployed is now “normal” even in the midst of
recovery. And they omit the fact that on an average of every
four years there is a “squeezeout”—-still more unemployment—dur-
ing which many who felt secure suffer severe privations, eat up
their savings, perhaps lose their homes or cars and possibly wind
up on home relief. Is this an exaggeration? Let's look at the facts.

The Cannihalizing Process

The Congressional Record of March 13 contains the text of a
speech by Rep. Henry S. Reuss of Wisconsin, along with the text
of a report on a survey by the research center of the University of
Michigan on the “impact of the 1957-58 recession.” The report
found that four in ten families in the United States felt the im-
pact of the 1957-58 economic crisis in one or another form—1oss of
employment during the 12 months.” The report further said “the
report noted, “thirteen million different persons experienced un-
employment during the 12 months.” The report further said “the
average duration of unemployment was 18 weeks for individuals
who experienced unemployment.” More than 2,000,000 were out
so long they exhausted their unemployment insurance checks.

Then there are those who line up each month for government

PUBLISHE'R’S ‘ NOTE

GEORJGE MORRIS, the author of this pamphlet, has been an ace
labor journalist for over twenty-ﬁve years and is presently Labor
Editor of the weekly WORKER. These ﬁrst-hand observations are
based on his recent extensive trip throughout the USSR, where he
personally visited many of the largest industrial plants, interview-
ing rank and ﬁle workers and top Soviet trade union leaders, in-
vestigating working and living conditions of Soviet labor, and study-
ing health, educational and recreational facilities, and other facets
( of the USSR today.

He is the author of many pamphlet including LABOR UNITY, \
THE RED-BAITING RACKET, LABOR AND ANTI-S'EMIT-
ISM, and others.

surplus food—5,23o,oo0 in March, 1959. Those eligible for the
food must prove an income of less than $95 monthly. The March,
1959, Congressional Record carries a speech of Rep. John M. Slack,
]r., of West Virginia, in which he gives a vivid description of
poverty and hunger among the people who line up for $6.05 worth
of food per person monthly, among them 278,2 33 persons in his
own state.

West Virginia once had employment for 150,000 coal miners.
Now fewer than 50,000 work full or part time. Rep. Slack observed
that the coal areas are “only the ﬁrst to feel the effects of tech-
nological advances.” The blight, he said, is spreading to other
ﬁelds in the wake of automation. He cited the big productivity
increases in steel, automobile and oil production that brought
heavy job losses. i

His state, said Slack, analyzed the surplus food for its nutri-
tional value and found that those depending on that diet get only
a fourth of the normal nutritional need. “A proctracted diet of
this sort will create a group of persons who will soon not be able
to work and will rear -children condemned to be a permanent charge
of the community,” he said. Then Slack summarized his indict-
ment as follows:

“0nly one conclusion is supportable on the face of the evidence
—our mode of industrial advance is cannibalizing our own people.
Technical progress, without attention to its by-products and eﬂects
on human beings is building a massive complex of industrial skill
based on a pile of human bones and operating on the tune of
wailing hungry children.”

There you have capitalism most eloquetly described by a con-
gressman who is himself a strong upholder of the system. Slack
admits that piecemeal measures against the evil are ineffective-
that longer range methods are needed. But he proposes only some
limited measures of relief. And he warns:

“The alternatives are brutal and unthinkable: Condemn a
growing number of Americans to a starvation diet, without hope
for the future, or tell them to uproot themselves and be’ scattered
across the continent, seeking work as best they can, destroying
home ties and family loyalties. This would, indeed, mark a low in
the development of the American heritage, and constitute a dam-

age to national morale far more serious than could be created by an
enemy with a bomb.”

Or take the witnesses who on March, 1959, appeared before
the Senate sub-committee hearings on conditions in the many
chronically depressed areas. To cite just one example, there is the
testimony of Mrs. T. R. Fulton, social worker of Morgantown,
West Virginia, a coal area:

“I have been in these homes, and these are things I see: people
living in houses without heat, houses without roofs, homes without
utilities. I see children going to school without shoes, without
warm clothing. I see houses and homes where children have nothing
to eat except surplus commodities and the canned food which
their parents put up in the summer that they got from the ﬁelds
and bushes. . . . This is as bad as I saw in 1932-34 in Baltimore.
This is the ﬁrst time I have seen children actually without shoes
in the snow. It is worse.”

Illness among these surplus food families remains unattended

for want of money for doctors or hospitalization and needed
surgery. And she pictured the breakup of families as men go off to
other areas in search of work.
I “I see young people leaving school because they are em.barassed
at how they look and what happens to them? I see them wanting
to ﬁnd work and not being able to ﬁnd ’~‘.. I see them trying to get
into the Army. They can’t pass the physical test.”

Is the above condition limited to just the unfortunately hit
coal or textile areas? The latest survey on the distribution of in-
comes in the Unied States, conducted by the Federal Reserve
Board jointly with the Research Center of the University of
Michigan, shows that almost 12 million of America's spending
units (21% of the total) receive less than $2,000 income annually.
Two thousand dollars is considered the poverty line below which
a family cannot go long without damage to health. Nevertheless
4,550,000 families of the 12 million, live on less than $1,000 a
year. But even more shocking is the fact that this survey was taken
in 1957, before the latest economic crisis got under way.

The survey found the median income—at the 50% line of the
country's spending units—was $4,350 a year in 1957. The Heller
budget for 1958 compiled by the Heller Committee of the Uni-

039

   

 
 

versityof California, called for $6,087, or $117 weekly, for its
budget. The actual average 1958 earnings in manufacturing ac-
cording to the Labor Department was $83.71; =

Meany objected to Trud’s reference to the Heller budget as
not the proper measure because it provides a “rather good stand-
ard of living.” 1/Vhy shouldn't the measure be a “good standard
of living?” The Heller budget is not very extravagant, allowing
only $62.50 monthly for rent. Many of the AFL-CIO unions use
the Heller budget as a base for their arguments for wage in-
creases. 1 1

But suppose (we take the lowest family budget—the “minimum”
income necessary for a “modest” standard in ‘a city compiled by
the United States Department of Labor. That budget, brought up
to 1958, called for an average of $90 a week for a family of four
in a city, or $4,650 annually. In its “Facts for Bargaining” bulletin,
of June, 1958, the AFL-CIO referred to this budget as the absolute
minimum. That bulletin also carried a breakdown of that budget
as itemized by the Community Council of Greater New York at
the end of 1957, when prices were about three percent lower than

. at this writing. Since then new taxes were also added. The budget,

    

$87.40 weekly, at that time, was as follows:

This is clearly a very modest budget. But how many families in
the United States can co-me up to the $4,650 it calls for? We have
seen that 50 percent of America's spending units (families) get

Frllll-¥\It&\v\\r-iv uu-vvv‘.v—-

below $4,350. On that basis it is doubtful if even 45 percent of the
families can meet the Labor Department’s “minimum” budget
level. Many of the unions affiliated with the AFL~CIO stress this
fact when they negotiate -contracts. S .

The above data applied in a period before the crisis. Thus more
than half of America’s families are without any reserve to meet a
crisis. Hence they are easy victims t-0 that other social-economic.
process taking place acro-ss the country, especially in the cities,
that dumps masses of men, women and children like so much disa
carded scrap to augment the ever-rising slag pile of “unemplloy-,
ables” living in chronic misery. - '

Our “American-way—0f-life” statisticians simply don’t take ac-
count of this part of humanity. But they are part of the working
class. They cannot be “expelled” from our society just to obtain
a higher “average” standard of living.

The New York Times of May 3, 1959, describing the ever-
mounting, number of Americans who are al-most chronically on
public welfare began the story: T 0 S 5

“In the ‘aﬁluent society’ of 1959 America, 7,189,000 persons-—
4 percent of the population—are receiving public relief in one form
or another.” Y

Even in 1956, when we were supposed to be in the midst of a
record “prosperity,” there were in the United States 5,430,000 men,
Women and children on public assistance. Of that total, 423,000

were on New York State rolls. Those ﬁgures will be found in the

study prepared for the New York State Interdepartmental Com-
mittee on Low Incomes for the period January-February, 1957.
The study by the government concerned itself precisely with the
problem of this steadily growing “pile of human bones” even in

‘periods of “boom” that is taxing the budgets of municipalities very

heavily.

The study gives ﬁgures on aid to dependent children, the
largest group on relief——then 2,237,000 nationally, 205,000 in New
York State. This ﬁgure includes adults, too—wid0ws, deserted or
unmarried mot-hers, foster parents. But the great majority are
children. The 1957-58 crisis pushed the rolls up substantially
higher.

419

What does this situation mean for one city—New York, the
largest and richest of them all-the home of Wall Street?

New York City's public assistance rolls numbered 318,871 in
the “boom” month, December, 1956. They rose to 345,358 in
December, 1957 as the crisis was only beginning to take effect.

'Ilhe majority of those who feel the main weight of this misery,
are the Negro and Puerto Rican people. Of the 1,600,000 Negro
and Puerto Rican residents of New York, 14 percent were on relief,
Eighty-three percent of the nearly 200,000 on aid to dependent
children are Negro and Puerto Rican, reported Welfare Commis-
sioner Henry M-cCarthy. Seventy percent of all those on assistance
are Negro and Puerto Ricans. This gives a measure of the dis-
crimination even in so strong a union center like New York.

New York is far from the worst in mounting relief rolls. Mc-
Carthy noted that while in New York City, aid to dependent chil-
dren rolls showed in October, 1958, a rise of 14.5% over the year
before, in the country as a whole the rise was 14.8%; with in-
creases of 23.7% for California, 22% -for Connecticut, 24.8% for
Illinois, 17.9% for Michigan, and 22.2% for New Jersey. Similarly
he reported on -the home relief rolls section of the assistance case-
load. While in New York it rose 24 percent during the year, in
Erie County (Buffalo) it rose 95%, with 24% for Cleveland, 117%
for Detroit, 37% for Pittsburgh, 20% for Philadelphia and 50% for
Milwaukee.

It must be borne in mind that only those who qualify under -the
relief rules of each area and prove they are in poverty and have
exhausted all their personal means (including unemployment in-
surance) are eligi'ble for relief rolls. Large numbers, unable to
meet the requirements (residence status, etc.) or unwilling to go
on public rolls, go -to the numerous private or religious charity
organizations. Some simply don't know what to do and suffer quietly
without aid from any source.

Who Breaks Up the Home?

The most tragic consequence of the “cannibalizing” process so
well described by Rep. Stack of West Virginia, is the tremendous
toll it takes in broken homes and its effect on the millions of
children. New York City Wel-fare Commissioner McCarthy dis-

closed that early in 1959 there were in New York City 41,000
children in 14,000 families with -two or more children he classes
as “born out of wedlock." Every year, he reports, adds 13,000 more
such children to the rolls. These are really children deserted by
unemployed fathers and often by mothers as well. “Most of
these ‘out—0f-wedlock’ children are either Negro or Puerto Rican,"
reported McCarthy. “There are practically no adoptive or foster
homes for them. . . . At the present time, we have 1,500 children
waiting long-term placement for which we have no foster care
facilities.”

The scope of the situation is even more vividly described in the
1958 report of Family Location Service, Inc., with general oﬂices
in New York, by its president, Walter H. Leibman. Here is a
section of it:

“How does our service to 1,761 families begin to compare with
the 100,000 desertions which take place every year, with over
6,000,000 mothers and children in the United‘ States today who are
not being adequately supported by absent fathers? Why is it that
our agency remains the only legal-social work organization special-
izing in the problem of family desertion? Why do not the federal
and state government agencies do more to meet the challenge in-
herent in the expenditure of $400,000,000 per year in Aid to De-
pendent Children to families of estranged fathers? What shall be
done even here in New York City where there are 400,000 folks
involvd in deserted families, many of them not yet receiving public
assistance but dangerously close to it, all of them affected emotion-
ally if not economically?”

“Communism breaks up the home!” How often this assertion
has been heard for a century from capitalist propagandists and in
the sermons of pious people!

In the Soviet Union they really had serious problems of family
life dislocation as a result of the war’s death and devastation. But
their success in meeting that situation ranks with the USSR’s
greatest achievements. There is no such thing in the USSR as a

"’ Here it should be explained that 9. large percentage of the marriages _among Puerto Ricans
and others of the m’ rant groups on relief are common law. The National _Council of the
Episcopal Church in Its pamphlet on the problem observes that among low-mcomed Puerto
means "it is estimated that from one-fourth to one-third of the unions are common law mar-
riages,cka.nd thus easily dissolved.” But on relief records. the children are classed "out-0f-

mark of disgrace on “unwanted” children or that children should
lack a home because of their nationality or some other factor. In
the USSR a parent cannot possibly desert children or evade re-
sponsibility for them. ’ =

The law provides for a deduction of a fourth of the deserting
parent's wages for support of children up to age 18. A runaway
parent cannot long evade su-ch responsibility and deduction, be-
cause wherever he works, a government establishment employs
him and he must present his previous work record. Such guarantee
also applies to divorces. A mother without husband has several
alternatives. She can place her baby in the factory or neighborhood
nursery to age three, kindergarten to age 7, either at very low cost
or free of charge and can even have the child sleep in, to be taken
home weekends. 1

School-age, children can be placed in the very successful “Inter-
nat” (boarding) schools, free or virtually free to mothers without
husbands, where the children live and study until work or higher
education, under the best possible care. Those schools are cur-
rently being broadened to accommodate 2,500,000 children (not
limited to children without one or bothiparents).

The Soviet government, as is widely recognized, provides its
most liberal allowances for the care of children. There can be no
situation possible in the USSR today where deserted children are
without care or mothers, are left econo-mically helpless. This is
provided as a basic right, not as “relief” or “charity.” There are
no charity organizations in the USSR because the very idea that
one should ask for charity is repugnant to the socialist concept
and is rejected. .

The government's gigantic social insurance fund, mostly dis-
pensed through the unions at the factory and community level,
with 215 billion rubles spent in 1958, covers every conceivable
social welfare problem. That is why I have not seen a beggar on
any Soviet streets nor any stray street children. V/Vhen I was in the
USSR in 1930, beggars or children without homes or care were
in evidence everywhere.

Most important of all, of course, is that economic crises and
unemployment, the maincauses for the breakup of families and
desertions, has been eliminated in the USSR. The second big

44

 

  

 

factor is that in a socialist society the care of children is not just
a private matter and is not weighed against proﬁts. No capitalist
country can conceivably appropriate such vast funds for care of
children, for sending millions of them to summer camps, and for
after-school activities, as in a socialist country. Thirdly, the law
of the USSR is strongly and unequivocally, framed in favor of the
child and protection of its rights, no matter what the status of the
parents.

The tra-de union movement of America, unfortunately, has not
yet displayed much interest in the mounting hill of human wreck-
age in the country's cities. That, apparently, accounts for Meany’s
disregard for family breakups involving 6,000,000 persons in his
boast on the American living standard. Meany does, however,
touch on some related questions——child labor, the status of youth
and the new school reforms they are introducing in the USSR.

Education and Child Labor: the USSR and Here

Seeing the USSR as suffering from a “shortage” of industrial
manpower——a condition many American workers wouldn't mind-
Meany writes that “Khrushchev had the Kremlin adopt a sweep-
ing policy of ordering the youth into the factories and distant
farmlands.” This, he goes on, is 7‘in effect reversion to child labor
in the USSR.” To “prove” his charge Meany refers to the theses
of the Young Communist League (Komsomol) on its 40th an-
niversary in 1958 which he ﬁnds calls on the members to construct
“large industrial plants, power stations, coal pits and ore mines in
the East, in Siberia, in the North of the country and in the Donets
Basin. . . .” This, Meany writes, is a plan to “use juveni1es—boys
and girls—for work in the coal ﬁelds and similar occupations.” It is
“massive recourse to child labor” and “Khrushchev means !busi—
ness in this massive child labor drive.”

Meany, it appears, is about the only known person who has
discovered "‘child labor” in the Soviet school reforms. For example,
he apparently thinks the Komsomol (Young Communist League)
is a children’s organization. It is actually a youth organization of
18 million members, their ages, ranging from 15 to 26. The chil-
dren’s organization of the USSR (10 to 14) are the Young Pion-
eers.

45

 

The members of the Komsomol certainly do work in all ﬁelds,
including mines, steel mills, in agriculture. They are the most
dynamic builders of socialism. But by what stretch of imagination
is child labor found in the Komsomol's theses? How does i_t place
“girls” in coal mines? Or “children" in factories?

What are as the facts? I discussed the youth question at every
factory I visited. Everywhere they emphasized that laws affecting
the youth are most strictly respected. The factory youth committee
and the Komsomol in the plant check on that. As amended in
1956, the law says “work for persons below the age of 16 is for-
bidden.” Also there is a provision that in exceptional cases, and
only with the consent of the union factory committee, are youths
past 15 to be admitted to a factory as students of trades or in some
special ﬁeld. But, continues that law, such student youths as are
admitted between the age of 15 and 16, are limited to a four-hour
day. For yo-uth between 16 and 18, the working day is limited to
six hours.

Furthermore, persons below 18 are forbidden to work in under-
ground occupations, chemical industry operations that are harm-
ful to health, heavy work in foundries, and such. The law, in the
book Collection of Laws on Labor also lists several pages of more
than 100 jobs at which youths below 18 cannot work.

Another law, passed in 1956, makes a month's vacation with
pay, in the summer, mandatory for youths below 18. Then there
is a whole series of other provisions for time off for workers below
18 who go to school at night of from 20 days. to as long as two
months (for diplomas) to prepare for examinations. Still another
law forbids overtime or night work for youths below 18. Finally,
the law provides -for a full-day's pay for youths under 18.

There were women (not “gir1s”) working in large numbers at
hard-work occupations——during World War II. They took the places
of the men who went off to ﬁght the Nazis, many of them not to
come back. As the recent USSR census showed, the ratio is still 55
women to 45 men. It is -this heroic replacement of men by women
that was one of the decisive factors that m.ade victory over fascism
possible.. The whole world admires them for it. It is shameful to
ﬁnd some labor leaders who sneeringly ﬁnd fault with the Soviet
system because many women both lost their menfolk and replaced

46

 

 

   

them even in coal mines. The law now bars women from such work,
and -further steps in that direction are to be taken with improve-
ment in the manpower situation.

Every enterprise I visited had special schools and workshops
for training of youth. Most of the earlier stage of apprenticeshi-p
is devoted to instruction and some theory related to the work. The
learner is under the individual care of an experienced worker who
is even allowed extra pay for loss of time and Apiecework earnings
because of the attention he gives to the youth. Moreover, in the
USSR mechanics do not fear to train youths because they have
no fear of unemployment. Apprenticeship there is not deliberately
stretched for a period longer than is actually necessary.

Nor is there sweat shop homework in the USS-R which is so
widespread in capitalist countries and in which children are en-
gaged. Also, in the USSR vacations are real for school children.
There is no rush for summer or after-school work certiﬁcates.

Child labor is certainly a most serious :problem—-here, in the
U.S-.A. First let’s look at the law. The Labor Department’s Ameri-
can Workers Fact Book reports boastfully that much progress has
been made in combatting child labor because already 20 states
and Puerto Rico set the 16-year age minimum for employment.
Texas sets 15 years. But all remaining states still hold to the

’14-year minimum. Also offered as a sign of progress is that “most

states have a limitation of eight hours a day or 48 hours» a week
for minors under 16.” Another boast is the trend-toward adoption
of state laws prohibiting night work “at least for minors under 16,”
and a maximum of 40 hours a week for them.

The major weapon for enforcement of even the limited child
labor protection we have is the Federal laws barring employment
under 16 on government contracts. But it is precisely in ﬁelds
outside federal jurisdiction where sweated child labor, legalized

by state laws, is most in evidence. The Labor Department’s fact

book concedes this. It states: “For instance, most states exempt
domestic service from coverage under the child labor law, and
farm laborers have but little coverage.” Investigation in 1955
found 59 -per cent of the farms inspected and nine percent of
the industrial ﬁrms violating child labor laws.

What does the Labor Department’s latest survey made public

47

 

Thirty Years Ago and Now

My visit to the Soviet Union in the winter of 1959 was my
ﬁrst in almost 30 years. The gigantic economic changes in the
period, beyond comparison in all history, were paralleled by a
revolutionary transformation along socialist lines in every sector
of the country’s life. In 1929-3o,.the Soviet Union was industrially
among the hindmost countries. Today it is second only to the
United States in industrial might. For more than a quarter century
it stood as the only socialist country, with a sixth of the world’s
territory and substantially less of the world’s economy. Today
there is a powerful system of socialist countries, already embracing
more than a third of the world’s population and a third of its
economy. By coincidence, both my recent visit and my visit in
1929-30 came at historic turning points. In 1929-30 I witnessed
the start of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan, the ﬁrst general advance in
socialist construction. The objectives then were regarded as so
ambitious that, at ﬁrst, few outside Marxist ranks regarded them
as realizable. The plan evoked jeers from the experts and ideolo-
gists of capitalism. The idea that an industrially backward people,
with a low literacy level, could build up a basic and heavy industry
without the aid of the western lands and “capitalist brains,” and
then operate it, was considered a utopian dream. Even less con-
ceivable was the idea that the peasantry would take the road to
socialism.

But it was my fortune then to travel extensively in the USSR
and be convinced -from personal observation that the plan was be-
ing carried out, and I witnessed the vigor and enthusiasm that later
led to a step-up of the plan and its completion in four years. To-
day, with the Soviet economy running at a level more than 36
times what it was on the eve of the ﬁrst ﬁve-year plan, the whole
world knows who were right—the experts of capitalism or the
socialist planners. A

My recent visit came as the Soviet Union marked the start of

in May, 1959, show? The 3,599 ‘non-farm establishments investi-
gated illegally employed 5,867 children, nine percent of them
under 14, 44 percent under 16. The 2,340 farms investigated
employed 5,477 children illegally. Of that number 3,946 chil-
dren below 14, who should -be in school, were working. Of the
latter, there were 118 aged six and more than 1,000 below ten. The
big majority of these are children of impoverished Negro families.

So we see that even the laws on child labor, far inferior though
they be to those of the socialist countries, are grossly violated.
The hundreds of thousands of children (many below 14) in-

volved in su-ch violations are, of course, not in statistics. But ‘

what do the statistics give on “legal” child labor? The Census
Bureau’s monthly bulletin on the labor force for January, 1959,
for example, gives the number then working between ages 14
to 17, as 2.5 millz'on—1.5 of them boys. Of that number, almost a
third, 746,000 (441,00o boys, 305,000 girls) are aged 14 to 15.
That was a midwinter month and does not reflect summer work.
It is also a period when agricultural work is at a minimum. The
Labor Department also says 22% of enrolled school children aged

14 to 17, work after school and on weekends.

The real point, of course, is not that the children are “law
violators” or have a desire to work after school or leave school.
It is the condition of poverty in their families and the fruits of
discrimination. Statistics tell us 9.5 million children of America

‘come from families with a cash income below $40 weekly; a

fourth of that number from families with only $10 weekly cash
income.

Meany, of course, must know the facts of this situation. Many V

AFL-CIO unions complain frequently to government agencies of
the illegal em-ployment of children. But instead of getting ex-
cited over child labor where itreally is, he trains his ﬁre upon
the Soviet Union where the laws and practices affecting the rights
of children and youth are the most advanced in the world and
are strictly observed.

The Truth on Soviet School Reform

Meany alleges that the school reforms to be put into effect in
the Soviet Union, starting with the 1959-60 term, is a scheme for

48

“child labor.” He quotes from a speech of Khrushchev calling
for instructions to the planning -commission “to draw up a long
term plan for employment of adolescents who will leave the eight
year school.” i

To check on some of his charges with those in the best posi-
tion to give the facts, I requested and obtained an interview with
Lydia G. Chuprakova, president of the Union of Workers in Schools
and Universities of the USSR, which includes the teachers. Here
I summarize, only brieﬂy, our long discussion. In the ﬁrst place,
it should be underscored that it is not because there is anything
bad about the current school system that the reforms were en-
acted. As in the case of the seven-year plan as a whole, the coun-
try is nearing the ﬁrst phase of communism. The schools, too,
must expand their role to prepare a generation that will live:
under communism and to provide a higher level of education-
The basic principle of the new plan is integration of schooling-
an-d work so‘ the student both learns to respect work and gains
some experience and a better appreciation of life when he sets
his objectives in higher education.

The reform does not cut school. It extends compulsory edu-
cation from seven to eight years. It extends pre-college schooling
from 10 years to 11 years-the last three connected with work
at an enterprise along with evening or part-time day education.

Upon -completion of the 11-year school, the student can either
take an examination for higher education, or, if he chooses, con-
tinue working at an occupation he has already learned.

How old is the stduent after graduation from eight-year
school? The child enters school in the USSR at seven. The rule
is that even if the child is a month or two short of seven, admis-
sion is denied until the next term opens, a year later. More-
over, in the Soviet Union, students must pass examinations every
year to progress to a higher class. If they fail they are left back.
Thus, in practice, following the summer vacation after gradua-
tion, the student leaving eight-year school is about 16, a little
above or a little below that age.

How can anyone here raise questions about 16 year-old Soviet
youth entering as students in an enterprise for four or six hours
a day, when even the most advanced states on child labor in
America permit youths 16 or less to work eight hours daily? And
.1 have not heard of any states with compulsory provision of a
month’s paid vacation for youths below 18, or three to eight weeks
off to study for exams.

Soviet higher education has outpaced America's. But the
graduation of 1,700,000 specialists from Soviet institutes in the
past seven years (three times our rate, they say) is not enough
for the USSR. The goal for the seven-year plan is graduation
of 2,300,000 specialists. The school reforms are designed to
achieve that increase. Also, it should be borne in mind that even
in the USSR where it is easiest economically for young persons
to go to universities, practice shows only 25% follow on from
1o-year school (like our high school) to higher education. Under
the practice currently followed, it is the student with the best
academic showing, but not necessarily with work experience and
a respect for work, who bids most successfully for college en-
tran-ce. Under the reforms both factors will count. The youth
who begins to work after eight years can simultaneously com-
plete 1 1 years school, get certiﬁcation as a graduate, and apply

for -college. He can make such a college bid at any time, years
afterward, if he changes his mind, and his chances for entrance
are in no way impaired. On the contrary, preference is to be
given those with work experience.

Directives to government planners to draw up plans for admis-
sion of youth to enterprises, is simply recognition of the fact that
if the edu-cation system is to be integrated with the places of work,
provision has to be made in the workshops for learners, involving
munch construction and teachers of a new type. That is why the
shift was scheduled to begin only in the autumn of 1959. And
all students now in 1o-year school will ﬁnish their terms on the
basis of the old system. Thus, not until 1963 will the reforms
be fully applied.

The reforms came as a result of considerable experimentation
and trial, ﬁrst with 500 schools, then with 3,000 schools—in all
cases with the consent of the parents. The reforms received the
unanimous endorsement of the «people after months of the most
intense discussion involving the parent school associations; com-
munities, unions and youth organizations. Experimentation will
continue on several forms of post-eight-year education. One form
expected to be most commonly accepted is continuation of the
youth at evening school with the factory giving him one day off
weekly with pay -for studies. The student continues in factory and
evening school as long as it takes to master an occupation, then
he can apply for college or stay at work. Or he can apply for
college at some later stage. .,

Another form is for the student to continue in day school
four days weekly and put in two days at the enterprise at full
pay. In three years he can complete school and is certiﬁed for a
try for college, if he chooses.

There are several other such variations in view. For extra-
talented students in the arts or music, provision is made for un-
interrupted completion of secondary school. But even in these
cases, including higher education where the reforms are also to
be substantial, every conceivable form for encouraging respect
for work is to be developed. In capitalist countries youth is
taught that the highest ideal is to get away from work. In the
United States, as even AFL-CIO leaders have often noted, edu-

cation is strongly inﬂuenced by those who bar even an elementary
study of trade unions. If students do get anything on the labor
movement in high school, it is often designed to breed anti-
union hostility, as an AFL-CIO convention resolution in 1957
noted.

.?Regardless, however, of one’s views on the education reforms
in the USSR, it takes extraordinary mental gymnastics to pro-duce
a “massive child labor drive” out of them. And such nonsense
comes with ill grace from a land in which most states allow
full-time work at age 14 on completion of elementary school,
and wherethe cost of higher education is far beyond the reach of
most youths of lower-income families.

Youth Problems—-Here and There

A serious youth problem is much closer to AFL—CIO head-
quarters than to Moscow. Hand-in—hand with the rise in broken
homes now involving 6,000,000 persons, runs a disastrous effect
on the children, leading to fmounting youth delinquency and
crime among young people. The 1958 report of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation shows another 8% rise in crime in gen-
eral, and among youths below 18 a rise of 6.5% over 1957. And
in 1957 the number of arrests of persons for all crimes in 2,500

urban centers reached the dizzy ﬁgure of 2,796,95o——a steady an-/

nual climb since 1945 when the ﬁgure was 1,565,541. Of the
1957 total, 12.2% or more than 350,000 were youths below 18,
including 98,927, or 39%, below the age of 15.

The Senate Kefauver Committee that has been studying the
youth delinquency question for several years, noted in its report
that the FBI’s ﬁgures cover only urban centers with more than
25,000 population. Projected for the country as a whole, the
actual number of crime arrests is more than -twice that given
by the FBI. The printed Kefauver Committee hearings present
a hair-raising picture of the degeneration and social chaos capi-
talism breeds among the youth. One series of hearings (Decem-
ber, 1956) compiled in a two-hundred page book, was on the

“treatment and rehabilitation of juvenile drug addicts.” It pre-
sents a most horrifying picture of thousands of children and
youth in many cities the victims of narcotic -peddlers, often at
school gates; of the resort to crime by youthful drug addicts to
obtain the price of narcotics.

The committee’s report summarizing its ﬁndings and recom-
mendations released in March, 1957, presents a shameful and dis-
graceful picture across the country as you go through its sections
covering about every known crime and of the large number of
youths below 18 enmeshed in them. Here is what the commit-
tee said: \

“Two years after the end of World War II, in 1948, there were
less than 300,000 juveniles appearing before the courts. By 1952,
this number had increased to 385,000 and in 1953 to 435,000. In
1954, 475,000 children 10 to 17 committed delinquent acts seri-
ous enough to bring them before a court, and in 1955 the num-
ber has risen to 500,000.”

The Committee projected the FBI ﬁgures for the country
as a whole and observed that in the rural areas the rise in crime
among youth is at an even higher rate than in cities. The
Committee warned: 8

“-If the nation’s «delinquency rate continues its upward trend
at the same rate it has during the years 1948 through 1955, over
1,000,000 children (10 to 17) will appear before the courts in
1965.”

The trend since 1955 fully conﬁrmed the Committee's predic-
tion. We cannot overlook this element in considering the work-
er’s living standard. Delinquency among children and youth
stems from the same source that brings the “pile of human bones,”
family breakups, desertions, child labor, capitalist-bred poverty
and insecurity. But so-me will hasten, I know, to point a ﬁnger
at the Soviet Union and the publicity there of a campaign against
drunkenness and hooliganism among some youths. True, this
even received mention in Khrushchev’s report before the 21st
Congress. On this matter, too, I sought and obtained an inter-
view with a high ofﬁcial—N. S. Prusakov, deputy minister of Jus-
tice of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic.

I sought more light on the recent government directives call-

53

   

ing on trade union, Komsomol and other organizations to create
voluntary people’s detachments (druzzhinas) at factories and in
housing areas to aid the militia (police) in combatting disorderly
conduct. ‘Cases of such disorder, instead of being taken to militia-
men for arrest and to the courts, are to go in most instances be-
fore the factory or farm collective “pe-op1e’s court of honor” with
the accused facing his fellow workers and neighbors. The theory
behind this procedure is that the community or collective shares
the responsibility for the disorderly acts of its members and
should help them correct their ways. Prusakov observed that
such a method was found far more effective than courts and
jail terms.

I asked Prusakov what speciﬁc law violations are mostly in
view in the current campaign. He said there are very few crimes
like robbery. Crimes that show up in large ﬁgures in U.S. sta-
tistics, like prostitution, narcotics peddling, gambling, are not
even known in the USSR. Drunkenness and rowdyism is what
they have mostly in mind and that too has been declining. I
observed that such disorders are a minor element in our troubles
and often go unnoticed. He said in earlier years drunkenness
and hooliganism was also treated lightly in the Soviet Union.
“But our cultural status has now advanced. We are now in a
position to eliminate this type of unsocial conduct, too.” This
policy of direct action by the people, primarily the trade unions,
is in sharp contrast to blaming the youths and the “remedy” of
more police and longer jail terms for which ]. Edgar Hoover calls
each time he releases one of his crime reports.

‘Since the war, Prusakov informed me, crime among Soviet youth
has declined 60 percent. Because of the general drop in crime,
many of the -courts have in recent months been closed or their
personnel was cut. And, he added, signiﬁcantly, in recent months
the militia of the Soviet Union (police) was cut by 40 percent.

Thus what exists in the USSR is a steady decline in crime,
disorder an-d youth delinquency and a higher stage of struggle
against what they call “remnants of capitalist habits." In the
capitalist countries generally, most of all in the United States,
the crime trend, most alarmingly among youth, runs steadily up-
ward.

Soviet Housing

'aMeany boasts of the wonders of America’s housing and sneer-
ingly cries of the “dreadful dearth of decent and adequate hous-
ing in the USSR.” He writes that in the Soviet housing situation
“the world can see one of the most shameful consequences of
Communist dictatorship.”

ard and steady work, and some even stepped into riches, while
Soviet people fought heroically and sacriﬁced as no people ever
did. They have forgotten that while housing was going up in the
United States, 14% of the total housing space of the So-viet[Union
was entirely destroyed. During the war, the Hitlerites fully or
partially smashed 70 million square meters of housing space and
left 25 million persons without shelter.

Thousands of destroyed factories had to be rebuilt and put
into operation before a ﬁrm base for an advance on housing was
assured. Meanwhile millions of people had to take shelter in caves
and hastily constructed shacks, or crowd a family into a room.
It was not until the 1949-50 period that the housing space of
the USSR equalled 1940’s. The Soviet leaders frankly acknowl-
edged their serious housing situation. But what Meany ignores
is the tremendous progress the Soivet Union "has already made
in its -program for liquidation of the housing diiﬁculty.

The United Nations. Quarterly Bulletin on Housing and
Building statistics for Europe made public in June, 1959, shows
the Soviet Union was far out in front of 24 countries, with a steady
annual rise from 1,245,000 units in 1953 to 2,664,000 housing units
built in 1958—to an average now of 12.9 apartments or houses per
1,000 inhabitants. This was moreithan twice the number of units
built in the U.S.A. in 1958. No European country came closer
than 19.3 housing units per thousand inhabitants.

Some idea of the pace of housing construction can be gained
from the following data: in the ﬁve-year plan, 1946-50, including
restoration, 102 million square meters of housing space was built.
In the 1951-55 plan, 151 million square meters were built; in 1956
it was 37 million square meters; in 1957 it was 48 million square

 

meters and in 1958 they built 68 million square meters. Those

ﬁgures are only of urban type houses. In 1958 more than 700,000
houses were built in the non-urban areas.

In the past ﬁve years alone, more housing space was built than
was in use in the entire country in 1913. Today the occupied
housing space is already four times that of 1913 and double 1940's.

Every day, on an average, more than 20,000 people move fromp

old houses to new apartments. In the villages 3,000 enter new
homes daily. But the past ﬁve years have only been the build-up

56

stage for housing construction to come in the next seven years-
for the 15 million new apartments to be built in urban areas and
the 7,000,000 new houses in the rural areas. This is as much hous-
ing space as was built since the Revolution. This calls for 5,870

. apartments daily for resettlement of 75,000,000 persons in seven

years. .To put it another way, by 1965 ﬁve in every 10 persons will
get keys to newly constructed apartments. That’s slum clearance!

You don't have to read statistics to know of the pace of Soviet
housing construction. The ﬁrst thing that hits you in any city
you enter are the many giant portable construction cranes. They
lean over construction work as high as seven stories. You see them
picking up pre-fabricated concrete wall panels and the workers just
guide those panels into place, as though they were playing blocks.
Five and seven-story apartment buildings rise within weeks. People
move into them before the outside work is ﬁnished.

There are 39,000 of these cranes working in the USSR, many of
them night and day, also 30,000 excavators and 28,000 bulldozers.
A drive from Moscow airport into town takes you through the vast
University area of newly constructed apartment houses with ceram-
ic brick facing. When I was there in 1930, the area was green,
known as Lenin Hills. Take twenty of the biggest housing develop-
ments, like Stuyvesant Town in New York, and line them up, and
you’ll still be short of covering the area of this newly-built Mos-
cow. Next to it is what looks like a still bigger stretch of newly-
built homes, called Cheryumushki. Block-long gardens and children's
playgrounds face all apartments. You go through block after block,
until you come to scores of cranes bent over more building work,
more apartments, while bulldozers clear away ancient village houses
whose occupants have already received new homes. Moscow has
for centuries spread out like a web. In any direction you take out-
ward, you see construction. I saw the same in Leningrad, Stalin-
grad, Tashkent, Rostov.

Most impressive was the scene in the heroic city of Stalingrad.
But for the southern end, the 40-odd miles of the city lining the
Volga is brand new. You go through scores upon scores of blocks.
In rare cases you come across a building that remained standing
and was worthy of repair. The city of 800,000 people is now well
past pre-war population. As you gaze upon its well-planned streets,

57

 
 

a still higher stage in its drive for progress-—the seven-year plan
that is to bring the country to the threshold of the ﬁrst stage of

Communism. The magnitude of the plan can be measured by the _

80 percent increase in production it calls for; a 40 percent rise
in real wages and a resettlement of ﬁve in every ten persons in the
urban areas to new -homes. The plan envisages catching up with
the American economic level and the U.S. living standard for
workers. By the seventh year, with the rise in the US‘SR’s economy

a plus the swift advances in China and the other socialist lands,

more than 50 percent of the world’s production is to be socialist.

Such were the goals set by the historic 21st Congress of the
Communist Party, which I covered for the Worker. With those
economic and welfare goals goes a far-reaching program of prepara-
tion of the people for another big social advance, for the higher
ethics and -concepts of human brotherhood called for under com-
munism. Again as in the 192930 period, I had the foptunate
opportunity to visit several parts of the USSR, especially many
factories in -the Leningrad, Moscow, Rostov, Kuybishev, ‘Tash-
kent, Stalingrad and other regions, and to see at ﬁrst hand t-he work

the most beautiful, you wonder how they did it all within so short
a time. The same question strikes you in every city.

I have seen some of the new houses. Some may be critical be-
cause some fringes are not up to our standard. Their kitchens and
bathrooms are not equipped up to standards of U.S. new homes.
But the important point is they provide spacious, light rooms,
private kitchens and baths—something millions of Soviet people
never had. I have seen apartments of two rooms and a kitchen
and bath, renting at the general rate of 1.36 rubles a meter (aver-
aging about 38 meters, not counting the kitchen), they rent for
about 100 rubles monthly, including services and utilities. In New
York, with refrigerator added, such an apartment would rent for
about $90, if you could ﬁnd it.

Another widespread phenomenon in the Soviet Union today is
individual house construction by the workers themselves. In 1958
more than 260,000 such houses were completed. And the tempo
in this ﬁeld is only getting under way. Land does not enter into
the cost. The factory gets a stretch of land and parcels it out into
lots free to its workers. At the Skorokhod shoe plant in Leningrad
they told me the workers are granted loans up to 7,000 rubles, with-
out interest, provided they put in at least 3,000 rubles of their own
(not a very big sum) and guarantee to put in at least 5,000 rubles
of their own labor. The factory helps the workers obtain mate-
rials, or even manufactures some materials, and extends water pipe-
lines, electricity and gas to the project area. Workers form coop-
eratives for such construction and exchange labor. Now you see big
stretches of do-it-yoursel-f settlements and they provide an interest-
ing study of individual initiatives, skills, talents and tastes.

The USSR’s success on the housing front proves that socialism
will ultimately prove the more effective way to meet the housing
issue than capitalism. On the other hand, in the U;S.A., the AFL-
CIO’s own periodic housing studies tell us we are not making much
of a dent into the slums. A recent Census Bureau survey of hous-
ing, made public in April, 1959, says that in 1956 there were 4,-
050,000 dwellings classed as “dilapidated,” with most lacking hot
water, «private lavatories or private baths. (New York Times, April
19, 1959). This was barely an improvement over the situation in

58

its many ﬁne works of architecture, with the trade union hall among '

1950. In metropolitan New York the number of such dwellings
rose from 164,000 to 188,000.

Soviet Progress Beneﬁts All

Meany alleges that American wage standards are “now being
threatened” by what -he calls “the very low wage economy and
dumping of low-priced goods” of the USSR. It is difﬁcult to see
how he can make such a change stick in view of the fact that trade
between the United ‘States and the USSR is insigniﬁcant.

What apparently disturbs Meany is not the alleged “dumping”
but the rising sentiment both in some business circles and unions
for expansion of trade with the USSR, China and the other socialist
lands, because such trade is seen as a stimulus for both business and
jobs here as well as to world peace.

A far more serious problem for Meany and AFL-CIO unions
is the spreading tactic of U.S. monopolies of investing their capital
in other lands -for production of goods largely for the American
market. Thus unemployed General Motors and Ford workers see
an increasing number of cars on the roads made in G.M. and Ford.
plants in Europe.

Meany’s cry against trade with the Soviet Union ﬁrst of all im-
plies that only one-way trade is desirable because imports from
almost all countries are bound to compete with American products.
Secondly, there are some countries that engage in very heavy trade
with the United States—-Japan, Italy, Great Britain, Western Ger-
many, Switzerland. The ﬁrst are especially known for starvation
wages. Even Britain’s wages run a third of the U.S. average in
manufacturing. In recent years we have -heard loud cries from
unions in garment, textile, auto, hats, leather goods, shoe, watch-
making and other ﬁelds because a Hood of goods from the above-
named countries is undercutting American products in American
stores. Some of the unions also observe that such returns are poor
payment for the billions of dollars in military and other subsidies
from the U.S. to those countries. Yet no one wouldlseriously sug-
gest an end of trade with them. It is quite apparent that the
“dumping” cry is really directed at the Soviet Union not for fear
of its products.

59

Meany carries his argument further. He objects in his article
to the assertion by Trud: “Our reality is insp-iring the working
folks of the bourgeois (capitalist) states to ﬁght exploitation for
a better future.” »

American trade unionists, of course, want to see the workers
throughout the world raise their living standards for a number of
reasons. First, their products would not be weapons for cut-throat
competition that would ultimately hurt the American workers. Sec-
ond, their higher purchasing power would widen the market for
American-made products, hence provide more jobs. And, third, as
workers, American unionists want all working -people to come up
to higher levels.

Let’s take that test: Does not the Soviet shift to the seven—hour
day now, and to the 35-hour week by 1965, inspire a struggle for a
higher level among precisely those» intensely exploited workers
whose products are a source of complaint in the U.S. trade union
movement? Is not the objective of a 40% rise in real wages in
seven years another source of such inspiration? Is not the new an-d
better housing to which the workers of the Soviet Union are shift-
ing, still another such stimulus? Are not all the numerous welfare
beneﬁts to the Soviet workers we have described something for even
the higher standard American workers to strive for?

From experience since the start of the cold war it is quite ap-
parent that the tens of billions of “aid” the U.S. poured into the
anti-Communist bloc lands have not served to lift the living stand-

ards of the workers of those countries. But the Soviet Union is
demonstrating its will for peace and a conﬁdence in the possibility
to secure peace, or it wouldn’t plan to invest three trillion rubles
for peaceful construction; second, it is inspiring, by its example,
struggles of workers throughout the world for higher-level objec-
tives. How can this “menace” the workers of the United States?

In this pamphlet, to refute many false charges we have sho-wn
that socialism is not only a promise of the future but brings great
beneﬁts to the workers now. In doing so, we did not aim to show
that living standards in the Soviet Union or other lands of so-
cialism, are already above those of the U.S. average. That is
clearly not yet the situation. But we can say, on the basis of the
facts and observations:

0 The gap between U.S. and Soviet living standards is not
nearly as wide as some propagandists for capitalism, or people
with only a surface view, have claimed. And this gap is narrowing
steadily.

o The difference is even less if all basic economic and social
factors that compose a living standard are put on the scales.

0 While the people of the USSR must still go a considerable
way to catch up with those steadily-employed in America, in some
very important respects the Soviet worker already has advantages
the American worker can hardly hope to get under capitalism-—
extremely low—cost housing, free medical care, free higher educa-
tion, a high level nursery and child care on a mass scale, youth

upbringing, better cultural and sport «facilities, and many more.
Many people will choose the latter advantages over a car or
ownership of a house with a 20-30 year mortgage.

0 While the goal of the -USSR is measured against America’s
per capita production, which Khrushchev estimates will be passed
in 12 years, it must be borne in mind that in terms of living
standards the U.S. can be passed sooner as some Western lands
are already being passed. There are millions in America—the
upper income sector—who appropriate and consume many times
the average per capita income, while many more millions each
consume just a fraction of the average. In the USSR there is only
a difference in standards that may range from incomes of un-
skilled workers to those of skilled and professional workers.

0 Above all, the Soviet workers enjoy full security economically,
something workers cannot have in even the richest capitalist coun-
try and they have established a socialist pattern for the living
standard on which they build continually and improve steadily.

For Contact Between U.S. and USSR W'orkers——F
for the Truth

I have called attention to some of the falsehoods that some peo-
ple in the American trade unions have been seeking to keep
alive for many years, and have placed them against the facts as I
found them in the Soviet Union. Some of those falsehoods, like
the ”forced labor” cry, have been discredited long ago.

Even former New York Governor W. Averell Harriman, long
notorious for his extreme cold war position, wrote in a dispatch
from the Soviet Union (New York Times, June 3) that there are
no forced labor camps in the USSR. He described a penal insti-
tution in glowing terms. In an earlier dispatch, he wrote peace is
“a national preoccupation in the Soviet Union.” But our trade
union leaders fear to let go of their stock of falsehoods lest the
pattern of their anti-Sovietism for many years, and the system of
terror against progressives within unions built upon this anti-
Sovietism, becomes suspect among their followers.

For that same reason these labor leaders, with George Meany
their main spokesman, stubbornly oppose any kind of contacts

is

with the Soviet trade unions, or even delegations of their own
choice who would observe life in the Soviet Union and not de-
pend entirely on the lies of professional anti-Sovieteers.

This policy of maintaining a “Curtain of Ignorance” is most
harmful to American workers because it is used to “justify” an
AFL-CIO foreign policy position that calls for perpetual tensions
and cold war. The rank and ﬁle of American trade union mem-
bers, like the people of the country generally, wants peace.

The policy of those who want the curtain drawn on the truth,
is clearly a policy of people who fear the truth. How else ex-
plain Meany’s ban on trade union visits to the USSR and warnings
to AFL-CIO unions not to even talk of such delegations? How
else explain the refusal to accept repeated invitations from a
union movement of 53 million workers? Some of our labor leaders
ﬁnd it more convenient to write articles and statements in Wash-
ington charging “slave labor” camps and “government-contro-lled
unionism” than to accept an invitation to come to the Soviet
Union and show the evidence.

Fortunately, of late there has been some contact between the
peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union. The ever-
growing stream of visitors to the Soviet Union includes an in-
creasing number of workers. Before long we will see delegations
of rank and ﬁle workers to the USSR, to see conditons there
for themselves.

In stressing that workers should, themselves or through dele-
gations, see the USSR, its life and trade unions, we are not sug
gesting that they’ll ﬁnd conditions in all respects superior to those
for employed workers of the U.S. They will ﬁnd the Soviet work-
ers have achieved a standard many times better than what they
previously had. They will also ﬁnd the rate of advance so swi-ft
and steady that their slogan of “catching up with and surpassing”
America is realistic. And they will also ﬁnd that Soviet workers
already have many advantages and beneﬁts not obtainable un-
der capitalism, and which are outweighing some advantages
American workers still hold. ,

Nor do we offer the conditons and forms in the Soviet Union
or other socialist countries as a blueprint for socialism elsewhere.
We stress mainly the evidence that socialism is a superior system

63

  
  

over capitalism -because it stimulates a far faster rate of industrial
growth, a faster rise in living standards and a higher social and
cultural advancement than has been ever known in history.
Every country will learn what it can from the Soviet ,Union’s
experience, as of that of the other socialist lands, and at the same
time every country will chart its own road to socialism. But observ-

ing conditions in the USSR today, looking back to what they were '

30 years earlier, and recalling the diﬂiculties it experienced since
then, I couldn't help thinking how much faster America could
build socialism with its powerful industrial base, given the will to
do so. The beneﬁts of socialism-could have materialized foro-ur
people much sooner. If the Soviet workers who practically had
to begin from scratch, did so well without capitalists, how much
better would Americans do without the men of Wall Street!

But however one may view socialism, he cannot be blind to
the fact that the gigantic economic advance taking place in the
Soviet Union is a plan for long-range peaceful objectives. Closely
bound with it is a program for lifting the welfare of the people
to’ hitherto unknown heights. A government and leaders who
have so fully mobilized the people for construction for peace,
cannot have an outlook of war. They seem to have an extra-
ordinary confidence the world can be kept out of war. Such con-
struction, such conﬁdence in peace, is a chal1enge—not a threat
—to the entire capitalist world. All who truly want peace should
welcome such a challenge and the prospects of peaceful compe-
tition between the socialist and capitalist systems.

for the seven-year plan already rolling, as well as the role of the
trade union movement in this gigantic plan.

Again I was struck by the enthusiasm and dynamic drive for
the next big advance and the already-evident amazing achieve-
ments through local and regional initiative, stepping up the pace
beyond the planned schedule. Everywhere I heard of -talk and
decisions to complete all or parts of the plan in six years or -less.

My mind shifted back to 1929-30 when similar early signs gave

a clear indication of the results to come. But the opportunities and
resources now are inﬁnitely better, with the goal by the seventh
year to be about 65 times the level of the Soviet economy of the
late twenties. This time in my tours through the plants, I rarely
saw a machine with a foreign label. Everywhere they proudly
noted all equipment is Soviet-made. At Leningrad’s Metal Works,
they showed me work in progress on the world's largest turbines.
At the Volga Power station near Kuybishev, largest in the world,
I saw 20 of those turbines in operation. At Rostov I saw the largest
agricultural machinery plant in the world. At Stalingrad, the
largest tractor plant. These and thousands of other large en-
terprises were built with Soviet hands, at the direction of Soviet
engineers, under socialist planning.

I didn't see a foreign technician, as I had in so many places
in the 1929-30 period. To the’ contrary, they often told me at the

plants I visited of their fellow-worke-rs and technicians in China.

India, Indonesia, Middle-East and African lands, helping to build
up these newly-liberated lands and showing how to operate steel,
machine and power enterprises. ’

In 1929-30 they told me everywhere of the very large percen-
tage of the workers just out of villages, just learning to work in
industry or to read and write. Today the majority of the workers
are sons and daughters of workers, with a far higher level of edu-
cation and occupational skill. Everywhere I found an insatiable
hunger for ever higher learning. Every factory has an educational
system—for completion of secondary school (like our high scool) ,
for technical courses, for second trades.

Those who rely only_on statistics to estimate the Soviet Union's
prospects are making a big mistake. They leave out of account
the human element, the most powerful reserve of all. This is not
a force of people hired to work for privately owned economy.
These are people throwing all they have into the effort because
they are working for themselves—for an economy and country they
truly control. You have to see this force—the most fully organ-
ized, politically most conscious, united and vigorous working class
in the world—to really appreciate its vitality and inﬂuence. You
have to see those people and their live-wire leaders inaction to
realize how they were able to rebuild a shattered industry to pro-
vide a base so powerful they can now realistically aim to “catch up
with and overtake” the United States within a few years.

It can already be said with conﬁdence that, given peace, the
seven-year plan will be very likely fulﬁlled ahead of schedule. The
ﬁrst 'half, 1959, results conﬁrm it. Today even the experts of
capitalism neither sneer at or belittle the plan. Instead they
have raised the cry it is a “threat” to -their “free” capitalist world.
They seek t-o frighten people with this “Communist threat.” They
picture the plan as a plan for “world conquest” and cry it must be
met by still greater outlays for military purposes.

The “threat” charge is refuted even by reports of many visitors
to the USSR known to be hostile to socialism. How can a country
that suffered so much destruction, in a war still fresh in the minds

u

of all, think of another war? How can a country be for war and
at the same time engage in so gigantic a drive for construction of
housing and other peacetime objectives?

The plain truth is that the new stage of economic and social
advance in the Soviet Union is a challenge to the capitalist world
—a challenge for higher goals of human progress. This challenge
comes to a capitalist world beset by unemployment greater than
at any time since the war, with economic insecurity a bigger threat
than ever. The challenge is a bid to capitalism to compete: who
can do more for the welfare of the people in the next seven years?
Clearly it is only those who have a vested interest in capitalism
and fear -this challenge of socialism, who can feel “threatened.”
The many people I talked to in the USSR were not in a “threaten-
ing” mood—they expressed a desire for peace and the hope that
workers of -capitalist lands would be spurred by the USSR’s exam-
ple also to press for the shorter workday and better conditions.

The “Curtain of Ignorance”

The main object of my trip was to see how the workers and
farmers live under socialism, and especially the role of the trade
unions in a socialist society. For many years the leaders of the
trade unions of the United States, with the help of the Depart-
ment of Labor, have harp-ed on a brazen collection of falsehoods
and slanders aimed at the USSR, especially its unions. They dis-
tort facts on living standards, allege the unions are not “real” or
are U"Government-controlled,” and still peddle the threadbare
“forced labor” lie. While keeping up this kind of slander, these
leaders have put a rigid ban on any contacts with the 53-million
member union movement o-f the USSR and reject repeated invita-
tions to come and see for themselves. And they apply this “curtain
of ignorance” policy at a time when even the State Department
has agreed to extended contacts with -the USSR in the ﬁelds of
culture, sports, the sciences, music, as well as in various economic
spheres.

‘The dhief spokesman for this “curtain of ignorance" line is
George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO. Even the presence of
a number of the AFL-CIO leaders, among them Walter Reuther,
at a breakfast with Anas-tas Miykoyan when the latter was here,
