working with the simple hand tools, still commonly used in that
country, produces about twenty—ﬁve cents’ worth of things a

day; his wages are about ten cents a day. The American work— ‘
ingman produces about ten dollars’ worth of things a day; his

wages are about two dollars a day. Out of every twenty—ﬁve
cents’ worth of things that the Chinese workingman produces he,
therefore, receives a DIME; out of every twenty—ﬁve cents’
worth of things that the American workingman produces he
receives a NICKEL! Viewed in relation to its product Amer-
ican labor is about the cheapest and most exploited labor on
earth.

II.  CLASS STRUGGLE OF TODAY.

ARE THERE CLASSES. IN AMERICA?

'In spite of w-hat has just been said, the average defender of
capitalism in America will deny that there are classes in .the
United States. He will contend that in this country there is
still plenty of opportunity for the industrious and ambitious
worker to become a capitalist. In proof of this he will “point
with pride” to men like Schwab, Archbold or.Carnegie, who have
risen from the ranks of the workers into the upper strata of
the capitalist class.

This misconception has its foundation in the swift and al-
mostimiraculous development of the United States from a back-
woods country into the ﬁrst industrial nation on earth. This
development has been so rapid that human thought has not been
able to keep up with it, and the average American seems in-
capable of realizing that conditions which existed a generation
or two ago have long ’since ceased to exist.

CHANGED CONDITIONS.
We do not have to go back very far in American history

before we come upon a time‘ when men of pluck and energy, ‘

who were not too scrupulous about the means employed, could
make an easy fortune. Even those who lacked the peculiar ability
necessary to make money, could withdraw from exploitation by
moving West and taking up fertile government land, or,/if
they were more venturesome, try their luck at prospecting in the
almost unexplored mountains.

How different are conditions today! The land still open
to the homesteader is of such character as to justify the remark

of the Irishman who, when asked what a homestead was, an— ’

swered ‘that it was a bet in which Uncle Sam bet the home-
steader one hundred and sixty acres of land against fourteen
dollars registration fee that he, the homesteader,_ could‘ not
live six months on it without starving to death. Nor is prospect-
ing more remunerative. The hills and mountains have been
crossed and recrossed; bored and sounded; explored and analyzed
by engineers employed by vast corporations or by the United
States government. Wherever such land has shown promise
of yielding up treasure it has usually been pre—empted by cor-
porations, or the mineral rights have been reserved by the gov-
ernment. '

The outlook for the “shrewd” man, who might perhaps have -

held his own against the original “captains of industry” had he
had the good luck to be born at the right time, is hardly more
favorable. The vast fortunes in the United States have been
made, as even a superﬁcial student might ‘easily ascertain for
himself, by robbing the public domain, or by obtaining control
of‘ some important public necessity. The valuable timber has
nearly all been stolen, andthe government will not allow any
further encroachmen,ts upon the timber reserves——except by those
who control the government. The same is true of water power,
and the rich coal, oil, gas and ore deposits. Millions of acres of
land, together with sufficient money to bu-ild the railroads, were
given-to railroad promoters to enable them to build the "railroads
for us, and they use the power thus acquired to keep others
from obtaining like privileges; Big trusts control every neces-

sity of life as well as the sources of credit, and it would be utterly.

impossible for 'anyone,no matter how shrewd, to compete suc-
cessfully against them. To sum up the situation: There is but
one world, and if some one else owns it you can't get another
one no matter how you hustle. The “shrewd” man of today must
content himself with becoming a common criminal instead of a
“captain of industry.” , -

The American workingman-. had better make up his mind
that being a member of the wage earning class, there is prac—'
tically no hope for him ever to rise out of that class individually,
either by fairmeans or foul. If "the workers rise, they will rise
together.

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

AN ILLUSION.
It is, of course, to the interest of the capitalist class to make

the Worker believe that the door of opportunity is\not closed to

him, and that he still has as good a chance as ever to become a
capitalist and employer.

Napoleon, in order to insure the faithfulness of his soldiers,
used to tell them that every soldier had a marsha1’s baton in his
knapsack, and occasionally promoted a soldier to some ‘high

«rank in order to keep the illusion alive. Although probably not

one in a hundred thousand soldiers ever reached the rank of
marshal, yet because of ‘that ‘illusion no army was ever more
faithful.

A similar illusion is responsible for the docility of the working

i class of America. The average workingman who talks, votes,

and even ﬁghts for the maintenance of the capitalist system, does
not in reality like that system any better than do we of the
Socialist party. He no more enjoys being ﬂeeced than does the
Socialist. But he reasons somewhat along these lines: “I am
being ﬁeeced, of course, but perhaps if the system lasts a while
longer, I may get a chance some day to ﬂeece other working
people, for in this glorious country of ours every man has ‘a
right to ﬂeece every other man "provided he sees a chance to
do so within the limits of the law—unless ~he’s big enough and
powerful enough to break the law.”

"To this we of the Socialist party reply: What is the use
of watching and hoping for a chance to ride on each others’
backs, while the capitalists ride on our backs in the meantime?
We propose to abolish the back riding system altogether, and
although in that case some of us will miss the luxury of riding
yet at the same time the rest of us will escape the misery of being
rid-den. .
' THE CLASSES.

Having established the fact that it is almost impossible for
a wage worker to become a capitalist, we -have at the same time
established the fact that there are classes in America. The work-
ingman and the capitalist do not belong to the same social class
There is no social intercourse between them except at Civic
Federation banquets. Capitalists and workingmen do not live in
the same kind of houses; they do not wear the same kind of
clothes; they do not eat the, same kind of food; the daughter of
the workingman does not as a rule marry the son of a capitalist,

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 11

or vice versa. When such a mesalliance does take place the
occurrence is so unusual as to furnish material for front page
articles in the newspapers for days. Workingmen and capital-
ists do not have equal opportunities, and while they are supposed
to have equal rights, they do not possess equal resources to
maintain these ‘rights.

THE DIVIDING LINE.

But, I am asked, where is the dividing line to be drawn
between the workers and the capitalists? In many instances the
capitalist is also a worker, while the worker may be the owner
of a small amount of capital, as, for example, ,a bank account,
I admit that the line cannot be deﬁnitely drawn; but this by no
means excludes the existence of classes, no more than the im-
possibility of stating the exact hour and -minute when day ends

‘and night begins does away with the fact that there is a day

and that there is a night.

The classes may be said to shade into each other. There
are workingmen who have a little capital, just as there are
capitalistswho do a little work, but there is a capitalist class and
a working class whose condition and mode of life are as different
as if they belonged to different planets. As a general rule it may
be said that a man belongs to the working class when he lives
largely or entirely on the income derived from the sale of his
labor power, while a man belongs to the capitalist class when he
lives largely or entirely} on the income derived from his capital.
The workingman with a few hundred dollars in the bank would
hardly beable to stop working and live off the income from his
capital; the capitalist, however, who is in the habit of spending
a few hours in his office, could in most cases quit work alto-
gether and yet live in luxury. It is, as a matter of fact, more and
more becoming the custom, especially among the younger gen-
eration of capitalists, to delegate all work to employes and spend
their own lives in the mad pursuit of pleasure.

MANUAL AND BRAIN WORKERS.

It is, of course, understood that by working class I do not
mean manual laborers only, but all those Who live by the sale of
their labor power, be it mental or manual. It would be extremely
hard to determine which labor is mental and which is manual.
I know that it requires considerably more ingenuity to lay bricks
or build a sewer than to add up ﬁgures on an adding machine,

 

 

 

 

 

 

       

12 ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

yet the latter kind of labor _is usually considered among the
mental employments.

Store clerks and office help, as well as the intellectual pro-
letariat, such as teachers, doctors, lawyers, artists, etc.,.often
resent being classed with such rude fellows as miners and fac-
tory workers. They seem to imagine that their clothes, or their
education, or both, entitle them to some higher classiﬁcation,
make them in fact “little brothers” of the capitalists. It is no
doubt because of this idle conceit that teachers, and store and
ofﬁce help, especially in the smaller towns and cities, have shown
little tendency towards organization, and as a resu-lt their wages
have dropped lower than those of the average skilled mechanic.

THE_ MIDDLE CLAss.

We must give some attention to the middle class. To this
class belong small merchants, manufacturers, farmers, store—l<eep=
ers, etc. Many of the individuals belonging to this class are
purely parasitical, and although they work, their work is often
unnecessary and may even be distinctly detrimental to society.
The Socialists contend that the greater part of this class is
bound to disappear even before the establishment of the Socialist
Commonwealth. \

That the small farmer is doomed has recently‘ been estab-
lished by an extensive survey made by Cornell University, which
survey conclusively proved that the small farmer cannot hold
his own in competition with the modern factory farm, and that
the larger the ‘farm the cheaper it is to operate. The plight of

- the -small manufacturer is too Well‘ known to need comment, and

of the store—keepers about 90 per cent fail in business. These
latter have already lost nearly all independent existence, and
havewbeen reduced to the position of piece workers for the trusts,
who set the prices of commodities _and allow the store—keeper_a

.. few cents on every sale. Of late years the trusts have them-

selves entered the retail ﬁeld——witness the chains of, stores be-
longing to the American Tobacco Company. the Woolworth
ﬁve and ten cent stores, the Childs’ stores and restaurants, and
numerous others, who, together with the big mail order houses,
make the life of the store-keeper miserable. The middle class
will be put out of existence, a-nd that not by the Socialists, whom

so many of that class ignorantly fear, but by the capitalists, upon

whose side this class, organized into Citizens’ Alliances, has so
often ranged Itself in the class war. _

/I

 

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 13

Is THERE A CLASS STRUGGLE?

 

The contention that there are classes in America needs, I .

think, no further argument. The question now arises whether
there is a struggle taking place between the two principal classes
—the working class and the capitalist class.

To prove that such a struggle exists, especially to a member
of the working class, is about as necessary as to prove to a prize
ﬁghter in the ring that he is participating in a ﬁght, or to a
soldier in the heat of battle that he is engaged in warfare. There

,is not a day that the newspapers do not chronicle some phase of

the class struggle——some terrible strike broken out in some part
of the world or nation; the calling out of militia to suppress strik-
ers; the jailing of labor leaders; the issuing of injunctions against
labor unions, and all the other evidences of industrial strife.

We of the Socialist party do not share the pessimistic view
of many would-b-e reformers in regard to this struggle. In fact
we consider it one of the most hopeful signs in capitalist society.
The most pitiful of all human beings is a slave satisﬁed to remain
a slave. May the day never dawn when the working class will
cease to struggle and will supinely submit to the exploitation of
the masters! We fully agree with the sentiment of Wendell

Phillips, “A slave I pity; a rebellious slave I respect !” The hope -

of Socialism is in the fact that the rebellious slaves are getting
more and more numerous, and that they are becoming more and

i more rebellious.

WHY Is THERE A CLASS STRUGGLE?

While it is easy enough to perceive that there is a class
struggle, yet-but a small part of the working people really under-

stand the cause of that struggle. A I shall endeavor to explain this.

cause with a homely illustration. G
Let us Suppose that Mrs. Smith is an excellent cook, but that

unfortunately she does not possess a cook stove. Mrs. Jones, I

who lives across the ‘street, knows nothing whatsoever about
cooking, but she is the proud owner of an excellent kitchen range.
Mrs. Smith goes to Mrs. Jones and says, “My dear Mrs. Jones,
may I use your kitchen range?” Whereupon Mrs. Jones, being
a nice and charitable person, answers, “Certainly, my dear Mrs.
Smith, provided you will give me four—ﬁfths of all you cook.’’

‘ I venture to predict that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones will ceas

to be on speaking terms, and that the neighborhood war will wax
fast and furious.

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

former, and wishing to have the best possible understanding
among the citizens, might say to Mrs. Jones, “My dear woman,
be satisﬁed with one—half of Mrs. Smith’s cooking.” Again he
might say to Mrs. Smith, “Give Mrs. Jones one—half of all you

cook for the use of her valuable kitchen range, and'be at, peace‘ - I

with each other.” I have my doubts, however, whether this
would permanently solve the problem. Mrs. Jones, being admit-
tedly prejudiced in favor of her husband and children, will want
to obtain all she can for them; Mrs. Smith, being but human, will
begrudge every morsel taken from her children’s mouths in order
to satisfy the demands of Mrs. Jones.

The War between the Working class and the capitalist class
is due to similar causes. The workers know how to work, but
they do not possessythe means wherewith to labor. The capital-
ists, being nice and charitable, allow the workers to use these
means on condition that the workers turn over to them by far
the greater part of their product. This is all the more galling
to the enlightened worker inasmuch as he knows that the means
of production have been produced by the workers, and have be-
come the property of the capitalists only by unjust and frequently
unlawful methods.

It is in vain that one tries to arbitrate the differences be-
tween labor and capital. Such arbitration can be at best but
a temorary makeshift. Just as the neighborhood war between
Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Smith will never cease until Mrs. Smith
oan cook her dinner on her own kitchen range, so the war be-
tween labor and capital will never cease until labor, through
society, employs itself in its own factories, mines and workshops.

IDENTITY or INTERESTS.

There are labor leaders like Messrs. Gompers and Mitchell
who continue to assure us that the interests of labor and capital
are identical. A very small amount of reasoning will convince
one of the absurdity of this position. ~

‘Supposing one were to ask a crowd of working people

Which- they would prefer—a ﬁve dollar daily wage, or a dollar ‘-

one; _,a sixteen-hour work day, or an eight—hour one. How
manywould be in favor of the low wages and the long hours?
Not one! On the other hand, if one were to put the same ques-
tion to a crowd of capitalists, how many would vote for ﬁve
dollars and an eight—hour work day? Only a philanthropically

/

 

 

Perhaps the mayor of the town, being somewhat of a re-

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 15

ipclined few, who think their proﬁts would be big enough, even
tien. . ,
A short time ago the directors of the United States Steel

. Corporation called "the attention of the stockholders to the low

wages and long hours of the steel trust employes, andrasked
if they- were willing to grant better conditions. Out of ﬁfteen
thousand stockholders circulhrized, less than ninety declared
thernselzes in favor of a change! I

Here then is the situation in a nut shell: The workers,
whether they call themselves Republicans, Democrats, Socialists,
Progressives, or Prohibitionists, all want the same’ thing-—as
high wages and as short hours as they can possibly obtain.
On the other hand the capitalists all, or nearly all, want as high
dividends as possible. Whatever the workmen gain in improved
conditions, the capitalists lose in divdends; whatever the cap-

' talists gain in divdends, the workers lose in wages.

\

THE BURGLAR AND THE VICTIM.

Yet Mr. Gompers is not altogether wrong. Let us see:

A burglar once broke into a house and confronted the owner.
He pointed a revolver at the man’s head and said,’ “My dear
sir, you ought to recognize the fact that there is an identity of
interests between us. I am looking for your money, you know
where it is, and it is just as much to your interest as it is to
mine to have me ﬁnd it.” The householder asked for an ex-
planation, which was immediately forthcoming. “You see,” said
the suave burglar, “our identity of interests consists in the fact
that if I do not ﬁnd money you will get your brains blown out.
You need brains; I need money—Why not co—operate ?”

The identity of interestsbetween labor and capital is of a
similar character. The capitalists say to the workers,‘ “Unless
you are tractable, and permitus to exploit you in a quiet and
orderly manner, we will close up shop altogether, and you will
have to starve. It is, therefore, to our mutual interest that you
allow yourselves to be exploited without oﬁering resistance.”

CLAss CoNs_cIoUsNEss.

There are many people who admit the existence of classes
and the struggle between the classes, but who assail the_So—
cialists for trying to make the working people class conscious,
and—as these critics claim—for advocating class hatred. In

 

 

16 i ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

. . . ‘ . . l
their opinion every well—w1sher of mankind should do l11S best

to obliterate class lines instead of emphasizing them.

Wepdo not deny that we are trying to make the workers
class conscious; we are proud of our activity in this direction.
We, too, desire to obliterate class lines, but only by abolishing
class distinctions and class privileges, no_t by trying to make the
workers forget that they are an exploited class. Our critics do
not wish to abolish class privilege, but merely to allay the dis-
content of the workers which class privilege engenders. I_nstead
of curing the disease they offer a narcotic-to the sufferer.

What then is class consciousness? To be class conscious.

means to be conscious of the fact that there are classes; that one
belongs to one of these classes; that in certain fundamental things
the interests of-all the individuals in each class are identical;
that, furthermore, these interests can be best advanced by the
concerted action of the members of each particular. class.

N at to beclass conscious means to be ignorant of the exist:

ence of class lines, or to betray the interests of one’s own class
for the sake of some individual gain. . I

The “scab” is not class conscious. This may be due to the
fact -that he is too ignorant to be aware of the existence of the
class_strugg1e and his own relation to that struggle, or so weak
and selﬁsh as to put his own immediate gain above the interest
of his class. .

The same is true of the worker who fails to support his
class in its struggle to obtain control of the powers of govern-
ment. This may be due—and invthis case is nearly always due-
to ignorance, but in some few cases it may be the deliberate

treason to one’s own class for the sake of some personal gain .

or aggrandizement.

WHY’ 1_*1’+IE CAPITALIST CLASS Opposes CLAss CONSCIOUSNESS.

. Of course, the capitalists and their friends do not wish the
workers to become class conscious, and that with good reason.
Eugene V. Debs once stated that there is only one power on
earth that can defeat the working class—that power is the work-

ing class itself. The capitalists know this. They know that as’

long as they can hire workingmen and women to take the place
of other workingmen and women who are struggling for better
conditions, as long as they can hire workingmen to shoot down
other workingmen, as long as they can persuade or bribe work-
ing people to put the candidates of the capitalist class into ofﬁce,

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 17'

their interests are entirely safe, but that the moment the workers
become class conscious and act unitedly on the political, and
economic ﬁeld, and neither threats, cajolery or bribery can per-
suade them to work against the interest of their class.—that
moment the capitalist system is doomed, and nothing can hold
back the Co-operative Commonwealth.

THE CLASS CoNsc1oUs CAPITALIST.

The capitalists themselves have developed a very high degree
of class consciousness. This is especially true of the big capital-

.ists who have graduated from the industrial anarchy called

competition. -

. When in 1905 the teamsters in Chicago struck in sympathy
with the employes of the big mail order houses and department
stores, the bankers’ association of that city appropriated ﬁfty
thousand dollars to aid the employers.’ The newspapers of Chi-

cago had a great deal to say at the time in condemnation of the

' class consciousness shown by the teamsters, but seemed to regard

the class consciousness exhibited by the bankers as an act of
patriotism. ‘ _

When former Senator Patterson of Colorado in 1904 had
the temerity to object in his paper, the Rocky Mountain News, to
some of the atrocities perpetrated against the striking miners in
that state, all the important business establishments in the city
of Denver boycotted him by taking out their advertising and very
nearly ruined his paper. -

What would be the fate of your own local banker if during .

an industrial disturbance in your community he were to take the
side of the workingmen?‘ A “scab” pursued by indignant strike
sympathizers would be a lucky individual indeed compared with
that man, who would be hounded ﬁnancially, socially, and other-
wise by his class conscious fellow capitalists. v '

V

INTERNATIONAL CLAss CoNsc1oUsNEss..

The class consciousness preached by the Socialists is inter-

national in character. We point out to the workers of all nations
that their interests are common interests. Organization of indus-
try on an international scale, and production for the world mar-
ket, make international co-operation of the workers necessary if
capital is to be successfully resisted. The international «spirit is
growing day by day, as is .witnessed by the moral and ﬁnancial

 

 

  

18 ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

aid given to striking workers by workers of nations other than
their own, the holding of international congresses, etc.

Thus we see that if class consciousness is, in a sense, schis-
matic in that itpoints out and emphasizes existing class differences
between the workers and the capitalists, it is in a far greater
sense unifying in that it points out and emphasizesthe existing
identity of interest between the workers of all nations.

It is interesting in this connection to compare class con-
sciousness with national consciousness, so often degenerating into
jingoism, and so warmly applauded by‘ the defenders of cap-
italism. - . '
Class consciousness emphasizes class differences, but at the
same time it minimizes national differences. If it creates greater
hostility between the classes, it certainly draws the nations to-
gether. National consciousness does the very opposite.» It aims
to obscure and blur over the real differences between class and
class, but raises barriers between nation and nation. Class con-
sciousness, therefore, divides the world into two great hostile
camps, that of the workers and that of the capitalists. National
consciousness divides the world into as many hostile camps as
there are nations on the glob-e. Yet the ﬁrst is condemned by our
moral teachers as “vile” and “evil,” the second is applauded as
worthy and noble! '

The reason for this is not far to seek. Class consciousness
which points out to the worker his real enemy, the capitalist, and
draws the workers together for the common struggle, 1S danger-
ous to capitalism and those who proﬁt by it; national conscious-

/ ness, which divides the workers and sets them to ﬁghting each
» other While the. capitalists reap the proﬁts of war, is extremely

advantageous to the capitalistclass.

CLASS HATRED.
Class consciousness and class hatred are by no means syn-

I onymous. -I can say without hesitation that a class conscious

Socialist is far less likely to -hate the capitalists as individuals
than is the workingman who does not understand Socialism, and
is consequently not class conscious. ,

The class conscious Socialist knowing, as he does, something
of the philosophy of Socialism, understands that the capitalist
system has developed out of Feudalism as a result of the constant
and inevitable evolution of machinery and industry. Inasmuch
as the‘ capitalist system is a necessary stage of that evolution, the

 

 

\ ARE ’1;HERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 19
individual capitalist cannot be held responsible for the evils of
that system.

The Socialist does not contend that theicapitalists are all
exceptionally bad and wicked men, while the workingmen are all
kind and generous. The capitalists, partly through accident,
partly because of the possession of certain characteristics which
enabled them to win out under certain given conditions, have
become the beneﬁciaries of the system instead of its victims. In
all other respects capitalists and workingmen are very much
alike. It is probably true that there are few workingmen who,
if given a chance, and the peculiar ability necessary, would not
make themselves masters over other men as the capitalists have
done. I have often been confronted with the shallow criticism,
“You would do the. same as Rockefeller if you only knew how 1”
The point, however, is that we of the Socialist Party propose to
change conditions so that no man will have a chance to become
the economic nzavster of other men.‘ No man is good enough,
noble enough, or great enough to be entrusted with the power
which the capitalists possess as a result of their ownership of the
means of production and distribution.

It has been frequently said that human nature would have to
be changed in order to make Socialism possible. We? on the
other hand, maintain that just because human nature is what it
is, mankind needs Socialism. If Rockefeller were an angel, Car-
negie an archangel, Hill a demigod, it might perhaps be reason-
ably safe to leave them in possession of their almost unheard of
power, but just because they are fallible men, perhaps no more,
but certainly no less selﬁsh. than the rest of us, their power must

‘be taken from them just as the absolute power of kings was taken

\

‘the act of labor itself.”

away for the same reason.

The class conscious Socialist furthermore realizes that labor
can free itself whenever it learns to act unitedly. We have no
reason to hate the capitalists for taking advantage of a system
which the workers themselves believe in and help to maintain.
We would not wish the capitaliststo give~us Socialism even if
they felt inclined todo so. “The emancipation of labor must be
We donot hate the capitalists for being

our masters; we blame ourselves for remaining their slaves.

III. WEAPONS or THE CLASS STRUGGLE.

There‘ is a remarkable unity among Socialists in regard to,
the Socialist philosophy. It is. concerning the weapons which it
is desirable to use in the class war, and the relative importance
of these weapons, that the opinions of Socialists differ. The
views presented here are those of the vast majority of the Social-
ists of America and, I may say, of the International Socialist
movement.

' CLASS STRUGGLE PRIMARILY POLITICAL.

Every class struggle is primarily a political struggle ;'it is a A
‘struggle for the control of the political government of the nation,

which is the fortress defending established institutions———in the
present case principally the capitalistic ownership of industry.
The'history of the world, according to Marx, is the history of a
long series of class struggles. All these class struggles aimed at
the conquest of political power, not as an end in itself, but as a
means to the acquisition of industrial power. So for many years
the rising capitalist class of Europe waged war against the land
owning feudal nobility, not so much because they wished to pos-
sess the'land, which, by the way, is still mostly owned by the
nobles, but because they wished to possess the law making and
law enforcing power of the nation, which would enable them to
exploit the workers to their hearts’ content, and make use of the
army and navy to secure foreign markets.

CLASS GOVERNMENT.

The policies of every civilized nation are today shaped in
accordance withthe interests of the capitalist class. To this the
United States is by no means an exception. It is rather hard for
the average American to believe that his governinent is a class
government, representing the capitalists, and on the whole inimi-‘
cal to the interests of. the workers. He has been taught to believe

‘that the American government represents the whole people—the

workingmen as well as the capitalists, the poor as wellas the
rich, without fear or favor. This is a sad illusion. If we once
recognize the fact that there are class interests, and that there is
a class struggle, it is absurd to believe that at least one of these
classes should not havehad the good sense to possess itlelf of so
formidable a weapon as political government, with its control
over the law making, law enforcing, and law interpreting power
of the nation. The capitalist class has not neglected this oppor-

 

. failed to do his duty.

ARE ’1‘HERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 21

tunity. It is using the political power which the workers have
allowed it to acquire, ‘as a club with which to hold labor in sub-
jection.

EXAMPLES or CLASS GOVERNMENT.

In San Diego, California, a group of workingmen desired to
hold street meetings. Free speech is guaranteed by the Consti-
tution of‘ the United States. The business men of the city did
not like to have these men air their grievances upon the street, so
they constituted themselves into an organization called the “Vigi-
lantes” and proceeded to beat the speakers and drive them out
of town. Many were severely injured. At least one died of his
wounds. One man who did not participate in the free speech
ﬁght at all, but merely was known to hold certain unpopular opin-
ions about government, was dragged from his hotel, put in an

automobile and taken twenty miles into the desert. Here his ‘
clothes were stripped and with the ends of lighted cigars the

initials I. W. W. were printed on his back. He was thenleft to
shift for himself. _ W '

For these brutal and unlawful acts not a single business man
was convicted or even prosecuted. The district attorney refused
to prosecute, and the governor of the state, who, by the way,
afterward became the Progressive candidate for vice-president,
aside from sending an “investigator” did not interfere.

Now let us suppose that instead of business men doing these
things to workinginen, workingmen had done them to business
men. Suppose that the union men of San Diego, dissatisﬁed

with some of the utterances of members of the Merchants’ Asso- ,
_ciation, had proceeded to inaugurate a reign of terror by beating

members of that organization, killing them, and driving them out
of town. Suppose they had seized the president of the First
National Bank of that city, taken him twenty miles into the desert,
stripped him of his clothes, branded the initials of -his organiza-
tion on his back, and left him to shift for himself. What would-
have happened? We all know what would have happened. ‘ From
one end of the country to the other the newspapers would have

appeared with headlines—“Anarchy in San Diego !”——“Reign of -

Terror in San Diego!” The Associated—Press would be sending
out column after column qf special correspondence. The Cali-
fornia militia would be on its way to San Diego, the governor
would be giving out interviews, while the president of the United
States would have the federal soldiers ready in case the governor

\

But it was merely workingmen abused and insulted by busi— '

ness men; therefore nothing happened. The Associated Press
was,not interested; the militia did not march. The‘ governor’s
investigator came, made his report, which was duly ﬁled, and the
business men proceeded with their brutal actions.

Another example. In 1904 when the great Cripple Creek

strike broke out in Colorado it so happened that the ofﬁcials of
the county were insympathy with the miners. This did not suit
the members‘ of the Citizens’ Alliance. They went to the county
building, surprised the sheriff and the other county Qfﬁcials, put
a noose around their necks and a revolver at their breasts and
told then1‘to sign their resignations. They did. Did the gov-
ernor of the state immediately send the militia to reinstate the

, countyofﬁcials and arrest the anarchistic members of the Citi-
~ zens’ Alliance? He did not. He sent the militia to work in har-

mony with the Citizens’ Alliance and wipe out the organization
of the men. The commander of the militia, General Bell, openly
boasted that he came for that and no other purpose.

There is at present a great strike being waged in the upper
peninsula of Michigan. Cruse, the sheriff of the county, is an
open and avowed tool of the mine owners. Suppose that the
miners were to march to the court house, put a noose around the
sheriff’s neck, force him to resign, and put one of their own men
in his place.» What wouldhappen? The offenders would be
denounced as anarchists in the public press. They would be
arrested and sentenced to long terms in prison, while the sheriﬁ‘
would be reinstated. If the governor of Michigan would fail to
act, the president of the United States would step in. ‘Is there
any doubt about that? None whatsoever. Yet, please remember
that the friend of labor, Theodore Roosevelt, was president of
the United States when the Citizens’ Alliance ruled with a high
hand in Cripple Creek.

Another example. In West Virginia the miners could no
longer endure the treatment they received from the mine owners.
They struck, and were -driven out of the company houses. The

United Mine Workers sent tents in order that the women and

children might be sheltered from the weather. In these tents the
miners determined to stick it out. The mine owners wanted
either of two things: they wanted the miners to get back to work
or to get out of the district. The miners would do neither. So
the mine owners hired thugs who would skulk around the camps

‘ at night and harrassthe miners by shooting through the tents, .

 

 

ARE THERE -CLASSES IN AMERICA? 23

not caring that women and children were within. The mine
owners even hired a special train, which they armed with a ma-
chine gun, and from this train, which was under the personal
command of one of the principal coal barons of West Virginia, a
hail of bullets was sent into the miners’ camp. Did the governor
of the state interfere? Not at all. The governor of the state,
one of. the seven governors who asked Roosevelt to run for presi~
dent, was of the opinion that law and order was being enforced.
Thereupon the miners proceeded to protect themselves. They
armed themselves and met the hired thugs of the mine owners
with riﬂes in their hands. They proved to be as good shots as the
thugs, and better. As long as the thugs were shooting the miners
there was, of course, no reason for the governor to interfere.
That was law and order. But when the miners started to shoot
back rather successfully it was law and order no longer. lt was
anarchy. So the militia was sent and martial law was declared.
When it was all over the Senate of the United Statesheld a post
mortem investigation. ’

. Another example. There was a strike in. Paterson, New
Jersey. A labor leader, Pat Quinlan, addressed the strikers, and
in the course of his remarks said something to the effect that the
men who were still at work must be gotten out at any cost. He
was arrested and ﬁve thousand dollars cash bond was demanded
before he could be released on bail. The reason for his arrest
was that talk such as that indulged in by Pat Quinlan MIGHT
produce a riot. Now as a matter of fact there was no riot, nor
even the suggestion of one. But the mere possibility of a riot
was deemed sufﬁcient for the arrest and the high bail demanded.
" A few weeks later Secretary Daniels of the Navy made a

speech in Seattle, during which he made the incendiary statement '

that “all believers in the red ﬂag should be driven out of the
country.” There was no question here at all that a riot MIGHT
be produced———the riot was immediately forthcoming. A lot of

‘half drunken. sailors, encouraged by the lawless talk of their.

superior omcer, started on a looting and burning expedition the
like of which has seldom been seen in times of peace. Secretary
Daniels was not arrested, nor was he even censured. He is still
Secretary of the Navy. '

I could multiply these examples ad inﬁnitum. Nor does it
make one particle of difference whether it is the Republican,
Democratic or Progressive Party which« happens to be in power

in a particular locality or in the nation. These parties represent

 

‘24 ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?

merely competing capitalist interests. They stand all united in
their antagonism to labor whenever the supremacy of the capi-
talist class is threatened. ' ' '

The sooner the illusion that this government represents the
whole people, or that either of the capitalist parties represents the

 

workers, is abandoned by labor, the sooner will labor solve the \

problems which confront it.

THE SOCIALIST PARTY—ITs ORGANIZATION AND METHODS.

It is, I believe, plain from the foregoing that in order to be
victorious in the class_ struggle, labor must possess itself of polit-
ical power. This can be done only by means of a political party
controlled, managed and ﬁnanced by labor. Such a party is the
Socialist party. Its aim is the abolition of the capitalist system;
its immediate purpose is to wrench from the capitalist class every
possible advantage for the workers; its organization is such as to
make it peculiarly adapted to achieve these ends. V

The organization of the Socialist party is similar to that of
the large labor unions. The control of the organization is vested
in the membership by means of the initiative, referendum and

‘recall, and every possible safeguard is taken to make the organ-

ization democratic. The organization proper is composed of
some sixty-ﬁve hundred locals with a total membership of about
one hundred and twenty—ﬁve thousand. These locals itre scat-
tered over every state in the Union. Each member of the organ-
ization pays twenty—ﬁve cents monthly dues, save in a few states
where dues are somewhat higher. This twenty—ﬁve cents is usu-
ally divided as follows: ten cents remains in the local treasury;
ﬁve cents goes to the county orgnization; ﬁve cents to the state
and ﬁve cents to the national organization. In the absence of a
county organization the state" ofﬁce receives ten cents. I

' Each state has a state secretary, elected by a referendum

—~ of the members of that state, and as a rule, a state committee and
a state executive committee, similarly elected. In proportion to ,

its membership every state elects a number of national commit-
teemen, who in their turn elect. an executive committee of ﬁve
members, and an executive secretary. The executive committee

transacts most of the current business of the national party, but -
its acts are reviewed, and may be ‘nulliﬁed, by the vote of the na-.

tional committee. If any dissatisfaction exists with the acts of
the national committee or the national executive committee, a
ﬁnal appeal may be taken to the party membership. A national

\

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 25

‘ .
party referendum may be proposed by the state committee or
state executive committee of any state and the membership of any
state may order its committee by a referendum to take such action.
Of course, this procedure changes somewhat from time to. time
when the membership decides to change or amend the party con-
stitution. I ‘ -«
The national office of the Socialist party publishes a weekly
bulletin, “The Party Builder,” in which an accurate account is-
given of all funds received and expended, and of all important '
developments in the party. Each state office is supposed to keep’ .- ,
its membership‘informed of developments in the state and from
time to time give a ﬁnancial account. Anyone over eighteen years
of age declaring himself a Socialist and subscribing to the plat-
form and constitution of the party may become a member of the
organization. Women are eligible to any party office.
The Socialist parties of the various nations‘ are united into
an international organization with headquarters in Brussels, Bel— \
gium. An international congress of the Socialist parties of the
' world is held every three years. This insures unity in all impor-
tant matters. ‘ ,
We see from the foregoing that the Socialist party does not
merely ask the workers to vote for the party, but rather to step
in and be the party. The Socialist party does not merely come 3
with the promise to do something for the working people; it tries {
to teach the working /people to make use of its organization to do
something for themselves. ' ' ‘

UNORGANIZED SOCIALISTSL

I There are many calling themselves Socialists who do not
, belong to the Socialist party organization. They commit a
r -' serious blunder. Their.attitude, though they may not know it, is
essentially.un-Socialistic. Socialism teaches self-government. No
true Socialist, therefore, should be satisﬁed to have others run his
organization for him. Socialism teaches co—operation, and what
is more important than that we should co—operate in order to gain
Socialism? It is unfair to allow others to bear all the burdens of
organization and propaganda and content one’s self with voting
the ticket on election day. The work of propaganda, which would
be-easy if carried on by the many, becomes burdensome and ex-

pensive whencarried on by a few.

The unorganized Socialist not only does an injustice to his.

organized comrades; he does an injustice to himself. One hun-

dred and twenty-ﬁvethousand organized Socialists by their tire-
less work rolled up a vote of over nine hundred thousand at the

last presidential election. What would be the voting strength of

Socialism at the next election if all these voters were to join ‘the
organization and work for the coming of the Co—operative Com-
monwealth!

One should not consider it merely a duty, but count it an
actual privilege to be a part of this world embracing movement

of the working class, which inspite of its faults——of which no

doubt it has many——is yet the noblest and most inspiring move-
ment which has animated the ‘human race for caaturies. As the
veteran Socialist Ben Hanford used to say, “If there is one thing
better than to live under the Co—operative Commonwealth, it is to

work for the Co—operative Commonwealth.”

CRITICISM or POLITICAL ACTION.

There are some supposedly ultra—radical, but in reality ultra»

reactionary labor leaders, who tell the working people not to
bother about political action, but to use “direct action” only. We
are told by these gentlemen that the source of the capitalists’
power is the ownership of the industries, and that, therefore, we
must strike at the root of the evil—take from the capitalists their
industrial power.

Let us see. Suppose a man holds in one hand a bag of‘

money, and in the other a revolver. Let us suppose that I have
a right to the money and propose to take it from him. There are
two things I might do. _ I might disregard the revolver and use
“direct action,” i. e., make a grab for the money, reasoning that
it is the money I am after, and not the revolver. In that case,
however, I stand a very good chance of not getting the money,
but of getting my brains blown out. Then again, I might use
indirect action, and although it is the money I am after, use my
best energy to secure the revolver. After I secure that I do not
think there would be much trouble about securing the money.
Some might reason that in the second case I might perhaps get

_my brains blown out anyway. While such a thing is not impossi-

ble, my chances for success are, I am sure, incomparably better
than they would be in the ﬁrst case. .

WILL CAPITAL SURRENDER?

It has been argued that if the majority of the people were
to declare for Socialism at the ballot box, the capitalist class

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 27

might violently resist the accession to power on the part‘of the
workers. To do this the capitalist class would have to rely on
the army and navy. J

In continental Europe, where military service is compulsory,
the ideas held by the people are certain to be reflected in the army
and navy. ':When the majority of the people are Socialists, the
majority of the soldiers and sailors will undoubtedly be Socialists
also, and the capitalist class will hardly be able to keep itself in
power by means of violence.

Whatever the advantages of our own military system when
compared with that of continental Europe may be to the workers,
it has one serious disadvantage: the soldiers being either.profes-
sionals or volunteers, are far less likely to be imbued with radical
ideas and could, therefore, be better relied upon to do the bidding
of the capitalists. On this account the Socialist party of America

should strain "every nerve to have our present military system »

abolished, substituting for it a citizens’ militia somewhat on the
plan of the Swiss National Guard. As long as capitalism lasts
it is better that all of us should be soldiers than that only -.a few
of us should be, and these few chosen by the capitalist class. The
demand for such a change is embodied in the Socialist program.
At the same time we should do our best to permeate the army
and the navy with ‘Socialist ideas. After all, these men ‘are re-
cruited from the working class, and if we teach them instead of
abusing them, weimay gain their sympathy.

Some four years ago when I was speaking at Vallejo, Cali-

 fornia, I had the. pleasure of meeting a marine who addressed me
as “comrade,” and who told me that there were no less than
seventy-eight Socialist papers coming to the battleship on which

he was serving. If this is at all indicative of the ‘progress of
Socialism in the army and navy I would advise the capitalist
class to be careful.

Itqshould also not be forgotten that in the event of an at-

A tempted violation by the capitalists of the will of thepeople, the

Socialist cause would gain thousands of supporters from those
who, while not Socialists, are not vitally interested in the main-
tenance of the capitalist system, and have unbounded respect for
some of the ideals for which the fathers of this republic are sup-
posed to have fought, and of which majority rule is one.

IMMEDIATE USES OF POLITICAL ACTION.

The class struggle,’ as the modern Socialist sees it, is the con-
stant struggle for every possible improvement in the condition
of the workers, until the ﬁnal goal, Socialism, is reached. Politi-
cal action plays an important part in this everyday struggle of
the workers. It would be impossible to describe within the con-
ﬁnes of this book all the practical achievements of the Socialist
parties of the wor1d—-the aid given to the workers in their eco—
nomic struggles, the favorable laws forced from the capitalist
governments by the mere menace of the irresistible growth of
the Socialist vote; the management of cities and towns which
have fallen into the hands of the workers ; the ceaseless activity
and fermentation carried on in behalf of the proletariat.

LABOR UNIONS.

The limited time I am able to give to the labor unions as a
class weapon should in no wise leave the impression that I con-
sider them of secondary or minor importance. ' Conditions may
arise where thelabor movement may, for a time, become of
greater importance than the political movement, or vice versa.
As a general rule, however, these movements are indispensable
to each other, and equally important to the working class.

The labor unions are necessary to insure to the working class
some‘independen'ce of action, and to uphold the standard of liv3
ing. As an organizer of the Socialist party, I have had plenty
of oppontunity to observe that it is almost impossible to reach the
unorganized workers with the teachings of Socialism; they are
in such fear of the boss that they are afraid to come near a
Socialist organizer or buy a Socialist paper. At the same time
the standard ofliving of the unorganized workers and their hours
of labor are such that often they do not have the opportunity and
the energy to study Socialism when they feel inclined to do so.

It is true that the labor unions have of late years been unable
to ‘keep the American standard of living from deteriorating.
This, however, should be no cause to abandon the labor move-
ment, but should be a reason for strengthening it. «If -the stand-
ard of living has deteriorated in spite of all the resistance that

~ the labor unions have been able to offer, it is well worth consid-

ering what the standard of living would be at the present time if
there were no labor unions to offer resistance. The labor union
man should not merely ask what has the labor union done for me,

 

 

 

' ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 29

but also what has the labor union kept the capitalists from doing _

to me.

The labor unions in the United States have been handicapped
because of the “pure and Simple” policy of the principal labor
leaders, which left the unions unprotected against the political
assaults of the capitalist class. More and more, labor union men
are beginning to understand that while the unions might leave
politics alone, politics will not leave the unions alone, ‘and that
independent political action on the part of the working class is
absolutely necessary to preserve the very life of unionism. On
the other hand circumstances may arise under which the labor
unions might have to be called upon to help maintain the polit-
ical rights of the workers. That" the labor unions are capable of
doing this has been demonstrated in recent Strikes in Austria and
in‘Belgium where extension of the franchise was secured by
means of the general strike. 4

The charge has been made, and that not unjustly, that the
labor union movement in the United States has not kept step with
the progress of industry, and that in these days of great capitalist
enterprises and combinations it is nothing less than suicidal for
workingmen laboring in one industry, and often in one shop‘ and
for one employer, to be divided into numerous craft unions. The

‘craft union is of the past; of the days of small capital and small

industry; to meet modern industrial conditions a much closer
unity of the workers is needed. A strong tendency towards “in-
dustrial” unionism can, however, be marked in nearly all of the
international‘ unions. A -

THE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT.

I can barely touch upon the co—operative phase of the work-
ing class struggle, and again must ask that this be not regarded

as an indication that I consider this phase of the struggle unim-'

portant. I believe that more and more the view is gaining ground
among Socialists that the political, the labor union, and the co—

. operative movements are of equal importance in the struggle ‘for

emancipation. Wherever one of these is neglected for a time—
as has been the case with _the co—operative movement in the United
States—~the neglect will have to be made up for later on, by a
correspondingly greater zeal.

The co—operative movement can be useful to the workers in
various ways, It can help to maintain or to advance the standard

of living by keeping down the price of commoclities, while the

unions strive foran increase in wages. It can help to carry the
workers'through’ strikes and unemployment. It can contribute
funds for the carrying on of Socialist and labor union propa-
ganda. It can furnish employment to blacklisted workers.» The
buildings erected by the co-operatives can serve as social and
educational centers. All these things are actually being done by
European co—operative societies. ,

What seems to me, however, the greatest value of the move-
§ ment is that it trains the workers in the democratic management
I of business and industry, thus preparing them for their functions
.  in the Co—operative Commonwealth. . -

 The co—operative movement had its birth in England in 1844. .

Starting out with a capital of $140, and a weekly turnover of
some ten dollars, it has now grown to immense proportions. The
English co-operatives do a yearly business of some $250,000,000.
v The co—operative factories manufacture goods to the value of
* $50,000,000. Some two million people are connected with the
‘N movement. ' '
In Belgium there are no less than two hundred and ﬁve co-
operative societies which ln: 1911 did a business of $9,500,000.
The members and their families form about ten per cent of the
'total population of the kingdom.

In Germany the co—operative societies do a yearly business
of about $15,000,000. The societies have a combined member-
. ship of over a million. ’ ‘~ ‘; ‘}
’ France, Italy, Holland, Austria and especially Denmark, 1
have well developed co—operative movements. In the United ?
States a few isolated attempts at c0~operation have been made
without, however, achieving much success. A genuine working

class co—operative movement must yet have its birth.

THE GENERAL STRIKE.

Among the weapons of the class struggle the general strike
merits special discussion. I think it is generally conceded that
the general strike’can be, and already has been, an extremely
useful weapon of the working class when used with forethought
and caution. The reason many Socialists discredit it is because
this weapon has been s_eized upon by the old. time enemies of
Socialism, the anarchists, who with their usual hysteria have
made injudicious use of it.

' There are some who look to the general strike as the weapon .
par excellence of the, proletariat, and tell us that only by_means

O

\

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 31

of thegeneral strike the capitalist system can be overthrown. The
capitalists, we are told, would be compelled to hand the industries
overto the working people or starve. .

I fail to see the logic of this. ,The losses of the capitalist
class during a general strike are very great, and the capitalists
may often concede a great deal to the workers rather than endure
such losses for any length of time, but let it be distinctly under-
stood. that no general strike, or any other strike, has ever been
won because the capitalists were starving, and that a general
strike which aims at the total expropriation of the capitalist class
would have to bring the capitalists to actual starvation in order to
compel their surrender. It requires but little thought, however,

' to understand that in the course of such a strike, the workers

would be much sooner brought to the verge of starvation than
would the capitalists and their -immediate hirelings.

We do not condemn the general strike, but we object to its
being made a fetish and a panacea.

SABOTAGE.

/A discussion of the weapons of the class struggle would
hardly be complete without some mention of sabotage, which has
been hai1'ed by some as a desirable weapon.

John Spargo, in his excellent book “Syndicalism, Industrial
Unionism and Socialism,” deﬁnes sabotage as "an essentially
fu-rtive and stealthy policy practiced by individual workers, hav-
ing for its aim the obstruction of industry and business to such an
€.’L'l€7’l'l that the employers will suﬁer a loss of profits so great as
to compel them to grant the workers’ demands. . . . . It
may involve violence, or it may’ be peaceful. It may involve de-
struction of property, or it may not. It may be based on illegal
acts, or it may not. It may consist of telling lies, or of ‘telling the
simple truth.” -

This is probably as inclusivepa deﬁnition as can be framed

of so elusive a doctrine. Because of this very elusiveness it is ’

impossible for anyone to say that he is opposed to all acts that go
under the name of sabotage; Surely no one can be opposed to
“telling the simple truth.” The advocates of sabotage are’as a

rule shrewd enoughto bring out in their discussions of the sub-'

ject only such inoffensive forms of sabotage as no one can object
to,,and which by right should not be branded with the name at all.

Mr. Arturo M. Giovannitti, translator of Pouget’s book.
“Sabotage,” deﬁnes it as "A——/lny conscious and wilful act onvthe

.-

 

   

l

ARE THERE CLASSES tN AMERICA?

part of one or more workers intended to slacken and reduce the
output of production in the industrial ﬁeld in order to secure

- from their employer better conditions or to enforce those prom-
ised, or to maintain those already prevailing, when no other way
of redress is open. B——/lny skillful operation on the machinery
of production intended not to destroy it or permanently render it
defective, but only to temporarily disable it and put it out of run-'
ning -condition, in order to make impossible the work of scabs,
and thus secure the complete and real stoppage of work during a
strike.”

While Mr. Giovannitti’s deﬁnition is sufﬁcient to damn sabot-
age as a working class weapon, yet it by no means deﬁnes the
doctrine, but merely gives the bounds to which Mr. Giovannitti,
seeing danger ahead, would like the believers in sabotage to con-
ﬁne themselves. In practice, sabotage means wha.t a member of
the Industrial Workers of the World, a ﬁrm believer in sabotage,
told me that it means’ to him and his fellow workers—“ANY—
THING OR EVERYTHING THAT WE THINK IS GOING
TO HELP US WIN.”

I have tested this simple deﬁnition repeatedly in my associa-
tion with believers in the doctrine, and I have found that this is
what sabotage means" to the men on the ﬁring line who become
imbued with the ‘doctrine. .

The Socialist party is opposed to sabotage and has repudi-
ated it in convention, by referendum vote, and by vote of its
national committee. One who practices or advocates sabotage
can no- longer be a member of the Socialist party. In this
the Socialist party of America has taken a stand in harmony
with the stand taken by the Socialist parties of other nations.

The Socialist party does not take this position because of
any pharisaical moral scruples. The reasons for our opposition
are many, but all of them have to do with the demoralizing effect
sabotage has upon the working class movement and upon the
‘workers themselves. I _

The effect of sabotage upon the working class movement is
disastrous because it tends to substitute individual action for class

action. It takes the emanc-ipation of the working class out of the ,

hands of that class _and entrusts it to the bravado of individuals.

Thedoctrine, therefore, is essentially individualistic and delights I

the heart of the anarchist. As’ in nearly every case the practice
of sabotage requires stealth and secrecy, the unions would be
honeycombed with spies and provocators, suspicion would be

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA? 33

sow‘n, and working class solidarity destroyed; the labor move-
ment would be outlawed and conspiracies" would take the place
of labor union meetings.

The average working man believes in the rule of the ma-
jority. He believes that laws, even those affecting capitalist
property, should be obeyed as long as they are on the statute
books, and a labor movement which dedicates its best efforts to
the systematic and secret breaking of the law would lose the ear
of the working class. Sabotage, therefore, while it may injure
the individual capitalist, would help to perpetuate the capitalist
system by estranging the workers from the Socialist and labor
union-movements.’ The capitalists know this, and for this reason
often are willing to pay to have acts of sabotage committed, in
order to be able to thrust the blame upon the Socialist and labor
union movements. There is, of course, the further danger of
having the working class movement become the pawn in the
struggle of rival capitalists who would offer bribes to labor union
men to put competitors out of business. In the same manner the
terrorist movement in Russia unwittingly became the weapon of
one court faction against another. , .

Still more disastrous is the influence of sabotage upon the
individual who practices it. THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT
AGAINST SABOTAGE IS THE SABOTER. The Jesuitical
doctrine that the end justiﬁes the means, with which the believer
in sabotage becomes impregnated,, renders him untrustworthy,

not merely as a workman, but as a comrade in the battle for free?

dom.
To believe that a working class which sneers at truth and

to believe the impossible. Honesty and dependability in the
workers, while beneﬁting the ‘capitalist class today, are indispen-
sable for the society of the future. We dare not corrupt om’-
selz/e.s'—-iiot even to spite the capitalists.’

THE OUTCOME OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE.

What then will be the outcome of the class striiggle? Who
will be the victors, and what will be the fate of the vanquished?
I do not think there can be any doubt that the working class will
carry off the victory. The working class is becoming more nu-
merous every day. Small land holders and small business men,
expropriated by the capitalist system, are joining its ranks. Not

only are the workers becoming more numerous, they are becom-
ing better educated, better organized and more class conscious.

‘ The capitalist class, on the other hand, is becoming con-
stantly smaller. The concentration of wealth goes on at a rapid .
pace; fewer and fewer are becoming the individuals- who have %
the controlling power over our industries. The capitalist class
has, furthermore, lost all reason for existence. As Chesterton
said, “the typical capitalist of today not only knows nothing 3
about the managing of industry, but he knows nothing about the
owning of industry.” Not only the management of industries,
- - as but the management of the capitalists’ fortunes and the invest— i
ment of their dividends is now also becoming more and more a l
delegated function, and the capitalist has nothing to do except i =
,5 amuse himself and by his excesses hasten the day of his downfall.

 In the struggle for the survival of the ﬁttest the working class is
surely the ﬁtter to survive. /

THE» NEW SOCIETY.

It A victory of the workers does not spell the subjugation of
, the capitalist class or of any other class. It will mean the aboli-
' tion of all classes and an equal opportunity for all to shape their
l des_tinies in the new commonwealth. We can give the capitalists
I the assurance that the workers in the day of their victory will be
far more merciful to them than they have been to the workers.
. There is no doubt that the progress of mankind under So-
 .cialism will be far greater than it has ever been before, for while. » _
under previous systems only a few were given the opportunity to . !'
escape the grind of everyday existence sufﬁciently to devote them— -
selves to the higher culture, all men will be given that opportunity
under the new commonwealth. A million minds will be working ’,
at problems which hitherto remained for but a few to solve. What
‘ is more, mechanical progress and the creations of art and. science . _
will not, as under previous systems, beneﬁt and delight the few,‘ 
T : . but will be the common heritage of all.

 

 

“ . . . The whole history of mankind (since the
dissolution of primitive tribal society, holding land in com-
mon ownership) has been a history of class struggles, con-
tests between exploiters and exploited, ruling and oppressed
classes. The history of these class struggles forms a series
of evolution in which, nowadays, a stage has been‘ reached
where the exploited and oppressed class—the proletariat-
cannot attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploit-
ing and ruling class—the -bourgeoisie——without,‘ at the same
time, and once and for all, emancipating society at large

from all exploitation, oppression, class distinctions and class

struggles."—Commum°st M anifestof

.g_——_—

“The struggle of the working class against capitalist ex-Z
ploitation must of necessity be ‘a political struggle. The
working class cannot ﬁght its economic battles nor develop
‘ its economic organization unless it possesses political rights.
It cannot bring about the transference of the instruments of
production into the hands of society unless it has obtained
political power.”—Erfurter Program.

I. . A REVIEW OF PAST CLASS STRUGGLES.
l S _

PRIMITIVE SOCIETY.

When in the childhood of the race people lived by hunting
and by ﬁshing, there were no classes, and consequently no class
struggles.‘ Therelexisted almost complete social and economic
equality. Prisoners taken in battle were never enslaved-they
were either adopted into the tribe, or killed. When food was

, scarce they were sometimes eaten.

The reason is obvious. As_ long as hunting and ﬁshing were
the only means of making a livelihood, slavery was economically

‘ impossible. The jungles were not policed, and a slave sent out,

hunting would more than likely not have returned.

SLAVERY. A ,
In the course of time man—or to be exact, ~woman—1earned

to cultivate the soil and to domesticate animals. Slavery now

became not only possible, but also proﬁtable. Instead of merely
making a meal out of a prisoner by putting him to death, the
captors proceeded to make a meal ticket out or him by putting
him to work. A slave, if he worked hard enough, could keep
himself, and still contribute to the support of his master and his
master’s family. Home possessed a sufficient number of slaves,
helcould give up work—or at least unpleasant and burdensome
work—altogether, and devote himself to the pursuits he liked,
or live a wholly parasitioal existence.

The keeping of slaves became, therefore, exceedingly popu-
lar in ancient society. In Greece at a certain period there is
said to have been thirteen slaves to every free man; in Rome,
in the days of Lucullus, slaves became so numerous that they
sold for about seventy—ﬁve " cents a head. '

SLAVERY AND PHILOSOPHY.

The Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, regarded
slavery as necessary to the progress of society. Plato in his “Re-
public,” a picture of an ideal society, made slavery a, part of
the scheme of that society. Both these philosophers took the

vie'w~point that without slavery progress would cease, inasmuch
as all men would'have to devote themselves to the production of

the necessities of life and no one would have leisure to practice

the arts and sciences. The overwork of the many made pos-
sible the expansion of the few. Aristotle, however, foresaw the
time when mechanical devices would take the place of bone and
muscle, making it possible forall to enjoy life and leisure. ,

CLASS DIVISIONS. ,
No argument is required to show that the introduction of

. slavery meant the introduction of caste and class. The slave

and the slave owner did not belong to the same class. They
were not social equals. They did not pass their time in each
others’ society; they did not live in the same kind of houses; they
did not eat the same kind of food; they did not wear the same
kind of clothing; the daughter of the slave owner did not marry
the son of the slave; nor did the daughter of the slave marry the
son of the slave owner. The slave and the slave owner did not
have equal rights; neither did they possess equal opportunities.
[The interests of the slave and the slave owner were not

identical, except‘in a very limited sense. A certain amount of ,'

prosperity enjoyed by the slave owner might perhaps have meant

a somewhat better existence for the slave—although even that "is

doubtful. Essentially, however, their interests were strictly
antagonistic. The prime interest of such slaves as had awakened
to the injustice and ignominy of their position was to break the
shackles of their slavery; the prime interest of the slave owning
class was to keep the slaves in subjection.

A. EARLY‘ CLASS STRUGGLES. .
The slaves——who were the real proletariat of the Roman

..empire—did not possess any peaceful and legal means of better-

ing their condition. The only way open to them was violent

rebellion. Several such rebellions are recorded in Roman his— —

tory. During one of. these, under the leadership of Eunus,

_ twenty thousand slaves are said to have been nailed upon crosses
planted along the highways of Rome, and subsequently set ﬁre to. ’

These blazing human torches, together with millions of
other torn and bleeding bodies of the workers, mark the progress
of mankind along the road to freedom, which is the road of the
class struggle.

F EUDALISM.

Out of the chaos following the fall of the Roman empire
emerged another system known as Feudalism. The chiefs

"selected by the peasantry, at ﬁrst vested‘ with very limited power,

gradually arrogated to thei selves greater and greater mas-
tery overltheir fellows, until at last they reduced the peas-
antry to serfs andvassals, who were compelled to pay them
tribute. These chiefs, together with conquering invaders, formed
a new exploiting class~.the feudal nobility.

The tribute paid to the chief had at ﬁrst been small and
voluntary. Its purpose was to enable the chief to make proper
preparation for the defense of the peasantry. When the tribute
became compulsory its amount increased, until at last it stripped
the peasantry of everything except a bare existence. The tribute
was usually in the form of labor; the free peasant as well as
the serf was compelled to work a certain number of days for

the lord. In the beginning this was sometimes as low as three’

days a year; later on three days a week was not uncommon.

If we compare feudalism with slavery we see that essentially
they are very similar, i. _e., they are similar in their effect upon
the workers and in the beneﬁts they bring to the masters. The
slave was compelled to work all the time for the master; the
master, however, was compelled to return to the slave part of
the slave’s product in the form of food, clothing’ and shelter.
If the master had neglected to do so he would have killed the
goose that laid the golden eggs-—-—the slave would have perished.
The serf or vassal wasallowed to work, part of the time for
himself, but that part barely suﬂiced to keep himself and his
family from starving. In both cases all that was produced over
ancl above a bare existence went to the masters. ‘

THE BOURGEOISIE.

When Europe became paciﬁed the feudal nobility, no longer
being needed ., for the constant defense of the peasants, lost its
usefulness. At this time, between the serfs and peasants on one
side, and the feudal nobility on the other side, there sprang up
a new class—the bourgeoisie,‘0r capitalist class. This class, at
ﬁrst largely composed of merchants and money—lenders, after-
wards of manufacturers and machine owners, began to contend

for mastery with the nobility. For centuries war was waged

between these two classes.

 

 

ARE THERE CLASSES IN AMERICA?
In its struggles against the nobility the botirgeoisie was
aided by the workers. In order to secure the help of the workers
the bourgeoisie made golden promises of a paradise on earth

that would be inaugurated under its reign. Words like liberty,.

equality, fraternity, were freely bandied about by the bourgeoisie

of all countries. How these promises have been carried out, the

workers oftoday can judge for themselves.

It is impossible to take up in detail the class war between
the bourgeoisie and the nobility. It would lead us to a review
of the entire history of that period. For our present purpose,

~which is principally to make plain the present day class struggle

between the workers and the capitalists, it will sufﬁce to say that
in nearly every case the bourgeoisie was victorious. In France
the nobility was completely routed and almost exterminated dur-
ing the so—called Great Revolution. In Germany the nobility was
ﬁnallyoverthrown during the middle of the nineteenth century.
In England the bourgeoisie assumed power more gradually by
a series of compromises. In the United States the Revolutionary
War freed the hands of the capitalists. In Russia the nobility,

although ‘deprived of many of its former prerogatives, is still in .

the saddle. '
THE WAGE SYSTEM.

The wage system, the system under which we are living
today,.has its roots in feudal society.* It ﬂourished side by side
with serfdom, and even slavery, but received its great impetus
in theisecond half of the eighteenth century when the invention
of machinery revolutionized industry.

The wage system as we ﬁnd it in the middle ages, except
during the time when the guilds were strongest, is free from
many of the objectionable features which characterize it today.
A master-craftsman would employ a few men to help him at
his work, of course expecting to make a proﬁt from their labor;
yet the master-craftsman and his apprentices can hardly be
said to have belonged to different social classes. The men who
worked for wages in those days were as a rule young men who
hired out mainly for the purpose of learning a trade. They
generally owned their own tools, which were simple and inex—
pensive, and often traveled from town to. town to learn the ﬁne
points of the trade as practiced in different localities. After a
certain number of years the apprentice would become a master-

workman and a member of the guild. He would then start in:-

business for himself and become in his turn an employer.

THE INDUSTRIAL REvoLUT1oN.

The-invention of machinery changed all this. Machinery ,

was costly and could‘ be bought only by a few. The owners of
machinery were soon able to crowd the hand workers out of the
market for the simple reason that they could produce more
cheaply. There remained nothing for the hand workers to do
except discard their tools and hire out to machine owners.

This transformation was not brought ab-out without a violent
protest and a great deal of suffering. Attempts were made to
prohibit legally the use of machinery. In some cases the
workers took the law into their own hands and started to burn
the factories. In the end, however, the machine won and the
modern proletariat was born.

THE PROLETARIAT.
The proletarian of today differs from the wage worker of

ii

the feudal system in that while the former in almost every case,

looked forward to the'time when he himself would become an
independent producer, the worker of today has little or no chance
ever to achieve independence. What little chance still ‘remains
is constantly diminishing as machinery becomes more costly and
industry is run upon an ever larger scale. '

The wage worker of today is also more exploited than was
his predecessor, and that in spite of the fact that his standard of
living is probably higher. This at ﬁrst glance may seem con-
tradictory, but it should be remembered that the wage worker
of the past, working with simple hand tools, produced but little
in comparison with the output of the modern wage worker using
up-to—date machinery. So while labor’s wage may be_ larger in
the absolute, it is a smaller part of labor’s product than the

‘ worker ever received. “The rate of exploitation” is, therefore,

greater, and the chasm between the working class and the ex-

» ploiting class deeper and wider. ‘As one writer puts it, “Wages

have increased on foot, proﬁts have increased by limited express.”

The wages of the American worker are somewhat higher
than those of his European brother, but are not commensurate
with the greater value of the American worker’s product. . In
fact, American labor receives a smaller part of the value of its
product than even Chinese labor receives. The Chinese laborer,
