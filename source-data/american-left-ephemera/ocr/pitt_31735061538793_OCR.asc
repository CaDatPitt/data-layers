Three Pressmen in Hearst Plant

Still Kept on Street by Armstrong

Pressmen’s Union Dictator, Although
Defeated by Membership, Still Ex-

ercises His Dictatorial Powers

Over a year ago, three pressmen, mem-
bers of New York Newspaper Printing
Pressmen’s Local No. 2, of the Interna-
tional Printing Pressmen and Assistants’
Union, were thrown off their jobs in the
New York American on orders from
President Armstrong, the dictator of that
local.

These men are still‘ on the street. Al-
though the men in the pressroom have sup-
ported them, the fact that they are still
on the street shows what kind of an or-
ganization the workers in the Hearst plant
have to contend with.

At the same time that these men were
thrown out, thirty other men were also dis-
charged in other pressrooms of this city.
All these men were thrown out for the same
reason. They had dared to question the
right of Armstrong to be a dictator over
them, and had wanted the local to elect its
own oflicers, and demanded an accounting
of the more than $2,000,000 paid in to
Armstrong during the ten years of his
dictatorship. For this “crime” they were
thrown off their jobs.

But due to the protest among the mem-
bership of No. 2, Armstrong was forced,
in one way or another, to put the men back
to work. It is true that these men are now
working on a lower status and at worse jobs

than they formerly held, still they are work-
mg.

Only in the rotten Hearst plant are the
men still out.

Mr. Hearst has carried on all kinds of
anti-racketeering campaigns in his newspa-
pers. But in his own plants he supports
the worst kinds of racketeers, people of the
kind of Berry and Armstrong, who could
not last one day if not for the support of
Mr. Hearst and publishers like him.

Recently at the November meeting of N o.
2, Armstrong was defeated by the member-
ship by a vote of about four to one. But
this racketeer promptly declared his pro-
position carried. He doesn’t want the
courts to investigate his books, in order to
see what became of the $2,000,000. How-
ever, Justice Callahan recently ruled that
Armstrong must produce his books.

Still Mr. Hearst supports such crooks and
racketeers, and his foremen are still keep-
ing three men on the streets, although all
other newspaper pressrooms have long ago
taken -the men -back.

With the new spirit of fearlessness now
exhibited by men in the pressrooms, the
pressmen in the New York American
should demand from the union and the
management that their three fellow press-
men be reinstated, and be given back their
original positions.

For these men were thrown off their jobs
for ﬁghting for what every pressman wants
—the right to elect his own oﬂicers, and to
get an accounting of what happened with
the more than $2,000,000.

 

SMASH FA—SCI8M!

HEARST and FASCISM

With the publishing of his "Instructions
to Editors” Hearst has come out in the
open as a fascist. He learned from his
"pal” Hitler that the first step in putting
over the fascist dictatorship is to crush the
militant organizations of the workers.
Therefore the “Instructions to the Editors”
—the campaign of lies and slander against
the leaders of the working class—the Com-
munist Party.

Every worker must be vitally interested in
the fight against fascism. It means not
only his bread and butter and the welfare
of his family. His very life is at stake. We
all know what fascism has meant to the
worker in Europe. In order to crush still
lower the living standard of the workers,
fascism smashes with terror and murder
the. fighting organizations of the workers—
their unions and political organizations.

Hearst’s efforts in the direction of fas-
cism are doubly dangerous because he con-
trols the most powerful chain of newspa-
pers in the country. It is impossible because
of lack of space to take up all the ques-
tions raised in the fascist program of Hearst.
We shall try in this and following issues of
the Hearst Worker to give the workers’
views on Fascism and Communism.

What is Fascism? Mr. Hearst tells us
that “Communism is government by a class
for a class. Fascism is government by an
opposing class.” Very good, Mr. Hearst,
but why not state which classes are in-
volved? Fascism is the open terrorist dic-
tatorship of the capitalist class—the boss
class of which Hearst is a leading member.

Mr. Hea.rst’s class—the capitalists and

Hearst Papers Lie!

V. I. LF.N1N said: (Vol. XXIV, pp.
335-6, Collected Works.) “The Dictator-
ship of the Proletariat is not merely the
use of Violence against the exploiters and
is not even mainly the use of violence.
The economic basis of this revolutionary
violence, the guarantee of its vitality and
success, is that the proletariat represents
and introduces a higher type of social or-
ganization of labor compared to Capital-
ism. This is the essential point.”

THE HEARST WORKER

Mr. Hearst and the Sales Tax

Most workers in the Hearst plant feel
that the recently imposed Sales Tax is
nothing but robbery. When a worker buys
a package of cigarettes for 13 cents and he
has to pay 1 cent tax, he feels he is being
gipped.

But Mr. Hearst doesn’t think so. For
years he has been writing editorials on the
question of Sales Tax. Because Mr. Hearst,
as one of the country’s richest men, had to
pay Income Tax, he proclaimed far and
wide that the policy of taxing the rich was
robbery and a most fair tax would be a
Sales Tax.

Here are a few examples:

In the editorial columns of the New York
American and other Hearst newspapers, on
March 13, 1932, Mr. Hearst said:

“The income tax system has become the
greatest racket in the United States and the
government the biggest racketeer. . . .”

He pretended to believe in the equality of
all men—rich and poor——exploiters and
workers. So, in the same newspaper, on
March 27, 1932, he writes:

“We are all fellow-citizens.

“We are all in the same big boat and it
is called the United States of America.

“If it rains, we all get wet.

“If it storms, we all get sick. . .”

The rich and poor are equal. We are
all suffering from the depression. Poor Mr.
Hearst must be down to his last million.
The sub who hasn’t had a day in a month
is equal to Mr. Hearst. Doesn’t he get wet
when it rains, except that Mr. Hearst
doesn’t have to go looking for work when
it rains and at most he travels in his luxuri-
ous automobile, so he doesn’t get wet. Mr.
Hearst proposed that the Income Tax (par-
ticularly on large incomes) should be abol-
ished and a Sales Tax be introduced.

On April 10, 1932, we find him writing
again in the following strain: —

“The United States Senate in perform-
ing its duty to the public in this economic
emergency should pass a ﬁve per cent sales
tax measure. . . .

“In Canada, the sales tax is called the
‘painless tax,’ because NOBODY FEELS
TAXATION APPLIED IN THIS
FORM. . . . I

“The United States could easily apply a
live per cent sales tax without injury to
anyone, and with the great benefit of an
enormous income to the government.

“But the advantage of the sales tax is
not merely that it is painless as paid, but
that it is HARMLESS IN ITS GENERAL
EFFECT UPON THE ECONOMIC
SITUATION.” '

The poor rich fellows must be protected.
Mr. Hearst, of course, understands that
once this type of tax which affects all is
introduced, that -it will be only a begin-

ning. On April 7, 1932, he calls on the
U. S. Senate to "enact a sales tax to col-
lect one billion dollars. . . .”

Now, when Mayor La Guardia, in order
to ﬁnd new income, enacted this Sales Tax,
Mr. Hearst was overjoyed. He sees in the
New York City Sales Tax a beginning of
the end of his hated Income Tax. Why
should he pay taxes when there are so many
workers around who could be taxed on
every necessity! What hypocrisy these
gentlemen exhibit.

Why doesn’t Mr. La Guardia stop the in-
terest payments of $180,000,000‘ per year,
if he needs additional income to take care
of the unemployed. The unemployed are
not being taken care of anyhow, only given
a little because the city administration is
afraid of the consequences. '

Mr. Hearst and his ilk want Sales Taxes
for the workers, in order to avoid paying
Income Taxes.

What is more logical than that the work-
ers should demand that the incomes of the
rich be taxed in order that no additional
burdens be borne by the workers. The un-
employed must be adequately taken care
of, and this can only be done by means of
a Federal Unemployment Insurance Bill,
like the Lundeen Bill  R. 2827). The
funds for this unemployment insurance must
come from the bloated incomes of the ex-
ploiters. They will still not have to stand
in a bread line, nor sleep in a flop house.

However, the exploiters, like Mr. Hearst,
cannot be taxed out of existence. The
whole capitalist economic system functions
in such a manner that the exploiters get
everything and the workers get very little.
Only a revolution which will take away
from the exploiters the control of the fac-
tories, mines and mills, will ﬁnally abolish
this condition.

But the least that can be done is that,
while this system lasts, the workers should
not have more burdens piled up on them.

If a mighty protest is raised against this
Sales Tax, it will be removed.

The workers in the Hearst plant can and
should cooperate in such a protest, so that
this damnable tax, which Mr. Hearst and
his fellow exploiters want, shall be abol-

ished.

their government in Washington can still
afford to make believe that there is Democ-
racy, for the workers. As soon as their
profits are threatened, as soon as the work-
ers go out on strike there is no longer any
make-believe about democracy. Brute force
is used to crush the workers, as was done
in San Francisco and elsewhere.

As the ﬁght of the workers against their
bosses gets sharper the boss class throws
overboard all pretense about democracy, and
brings in the open dictatorship of their class
—fascism.

Today, Hearst and his capitalist class
brothers are becoming frightened at the
growing struggles and organizations of the
workers throughout the country. They are
beginning to look around for the American
Hitler. The offer has already been made
to General Butler.

ROOSEVELT DEMAGOGY

Now that the President of the United States has concluded his speech at the opening
of the Congress, it would -be well if we workers take time out for a consideration of the
basic assumptions contained therein, and analyze the portent of the social forces which
prompt his line of reasoning.

He begins by speaking of the social trends: “Throughout the world change is the
order of the day.” We Communists ask, “When was it otherwise—when was there
a time when change was not the only permanent, the assured force?” He says the
“masters of old practice and theory were unprepared.” Is this not an admission that
capitalism cannot plan? Yes, it shows clearly the utter bankruptcy of capitalism——as far
as we workers are concerned. It is an added admission that the economic world has been
run by the executive committees of the capi-talists (the governing powers) of the world
in the interests of the capitalist class only. It has been merely incidental that we workers
did enjoy any crumbs from the masters’ tables.

Again the President speaks of security: “Among our objectives'I place the security
of the men, women and children of the nation first.” Here he enumerates three main
points:

“1. The security of a livelihood through the better use of the national resources of
the land in which we live.” (Nothing here for workers to write home about—these
resources are still to remain in the ownership of the ruling class.)

“2. The security against the major hazards and Vicissi-tudes of life.” (What does
that mean? Clearly, anything the boss class cares to write into law. It might mean
unemployment insurance and then again. . . 

“3. The security of decent hours.” (Figure that one out, if you can.) I

“No wise man has any intention of destroying what is known as the proﬁt motive;
because by the proﬁt motive we mean the right by work to earn a decent livelihood for
ourselves and our families.” Hearst and Rockefeller, et al, will have no objection to
that. They will be the “court of last resort” when it comes to what shall constitute a
livelihood for themselves and their families. To the workers it means you may get a few
pennies by wo-rking on relief projects, by the way, at work that you are not ﬁtted for by
skill or training, and which in this case will be a veritable hell, and then be told that
these few cents will be your PROFIT. A very inadequate standard—a coolie standard.

WHY CAPITALISM HATES THE NAME OF LENIN

Lenin, the leader of the working class throughout the world, is a name that the capi-
talists fear.

Lenin with the help of his party, the Communist Party of Russia first showed the
working class of the world that power and strength lie in the hands of the proletariat.

Lenin and his party, the Bolshevik Party, after gaining power in Russia, transformed
a land of starvation and misery into a land of economic security. Under the leadership of
Lenin the workers and farmers of Russia destroyed capitalism, which breeds war, suffering,
and the destruction of the toiling masses, and laid the foundation for a Socialist system
of society which guarantees the working class full economic security, and serves as a
mighty power to preserve the peace of the whole world.

Lenin also showed the proletariat of Russia how to organize and ﬁght for power.
He has clearly pointed out that in order for the proletariat to build a Soviet State, able
to destroy its enemies from within and without, it must ﬁrst completely destroy the old
State and build a new one in its place. Therefore the capitalist class that strives by
plundering the workers, fears and hates the very mention of Lenin and his teachings.

Not only does the ruling class hate the name of Lenin, but it also seeks to destroy
all his followers, by suppressing free speech and free assembly, by imprisoning the most
militant workers, and by organizing fascist dictatorships——whe'rever possible in the open,
and elsewhere half-concealed.

The increasing struggle of the working class to free themselves from wage slavery,
exploitation, unemployment, starvation and war, is a challenge to the capitalist system.
The ruling class, fearing the mighty power of the workers, are not sure of their strength,
and are beginning to introduce fascist methods of oppression, and in this way hope to
crush the militant spirit of the oppressed class—-the proletariat. - .

Mr. Hearst, who visited his friend Hitler last summer, openly advocates fascism.
He says quite frankly that workers cannot rule. Only those who have the means—he
means the means of production—-can rule. The fascist methods proposed by Mr. Hearst
aim to destroy the trade unions, for whom this arch enemy of the working class has no
use. Hearst’s brand of fascism would destroy all the gains the workers have made in
their bitter struggle against predatory wealth. Fascism also means persecution, forced
labor, concentration camps, and finally war.

_ Leninism teaches -the workers how to organize and ﬁght fascism—capitalism in its
desperate state. Is it any wonder that the capitalists hate the name of Lenin so? Long
after capitalism and Mr. Hearst will be forgotten, long after all the apologists of this
damnable system will have been dead, the name of Lenin will still live in the minds and
hearts of the proletariat all over the world.

THE COURSE  THE CRISIS OF
CAPITALISM IN THE U.S.

The “New Deal” policy of Roosevelt was
hailed by the bourgeoisieand its reformist
agents as the beginning of decisive recovery
from the economic crisis, the beginning of
the return of “prosperity”, and the ending
of the misery of the masses. It was accom-
panied by a campaign of social demagogy
through which the ruling class tried to con-
vince the masses that through the new deal
capitalism is overcoming the fundamental
capitalist contradictions, is developing to-
wards planned economy, etc. There is no
foundation for all these predictions. Even
in the face of the upturn in production
which occurred from time to time, the
misery of the masses has increased. On the
contrary, all the measures of the “new
deal”, far from solving the economic crisis,
have only intensiﬁed the general crisis of
capitalism.

The recent increase in production is in
the main explained by: (a) war prepara-
tions, the enormous increased production of
war materials, supplies and munitions; (b)
the pouring of billions of the State Treasury
into industry and agriculture; (c) the
slashing of the wages of the workers, in-
creased speed-up system; in the recent in-
crease of production of the internal eco-
nomic forces expressed itself to a great
degree in the ﬁeld of production of capi-
tal goods, the only basis for a “normal”
cyclical recovery of capitalism.

The improved situation for capitalist in-
dustry, as compared with the ﬁrst years of
the depression, came as a result of the sharp
reduction of the living standards of the
workers, the further ruination of the poor
and middle farmers, and impoverishment
of the middle class. Increasing proﬁts also
serve, even in small degree, to encourage
new capital investments in production and
building. Further, a large part of debts
were wiped out through bankruptcy, further
mergers; while conﬁscation of a huge por-
tion of middle-class savings through the
closing of banks, made a serious contribu-
tion to capitalist proﬁts.

This is the road traveled by American
capitalism in the crisis. It is not the road
to a new prosperity. It is, as Stalin ex-
plained at the Seventeenth Congress of the
C.P.S.U.,

“Apparently, what we are witnessing
is the transition from the lowest point of
decline of industry, from the lowest
depth of the industrial crisis to a depres-
sion, not an ordinary depression, but to
a. depression of a special kind which does
not lead to a new boom and ﬂourishing
industry, but which, on the other hand,
does not force it back to the lowest point
of decline.”

(In our next issue we will take up
H earn’: statement that “Communism as ac-
tually in operation is government by a
class for a clam”)

THE HEARST WORKER

The Fight for the Unemployed

On Monday, December 4, about one hun-
dred delegates from the various chapels as-
sembled at the headquarters of Big Six to
listen to reports of the New York Times
Chapel Relief "Committee. A permanent
organization was effected. An executive
committee of ﬁfteen members were nom-
inated and elected, seven of whom were
newspaper and eight job men.

A committee of ﬁve were likewise nom-
inated and elected to procure, if possible,
the formation of a like organization in each
of the allied printing trades. A most im-
portant motion was carried almost unani-
mously to take measures to have "Big 6”
send delegates to the National Unemploy-
ment Congress, which meets in Washington,
D. C., January 5, 6 and 7. This Congress
will be composed of delegates from A. F. of
L. unions, Unemployment Councils, and
rank and ﬁle organizations. The Congress
meets simultaneously with the Congress of
the United States and its purpose is to use
pressure for the passing of the Workers’
Unemployment Insurance Bill, which pro-
vides:

Beneﬁt to all unemployed without ex-
ception, without discrimination; payments to
become effective immediately; administra-
tion by workers, and full cost of this pro-
tection to be made a general charge upon
industry and government. None of its
funds to be raised by direct or indirect taxa-
tion on the masses.

Some of our delegates still have illusions
of assessing the situation holders to some-
how support our unemployed. Some of the
delegates thought that pools would afford
a sufficient income, and still others insisted
that our oﬂicers would be able to devise ways
and means of taking care of the unem-
ployed.

The chairman, Mr. Lipton, called on
Mr. Killeen to say a few words. Mr.
Killeen spoke brieﬂy and to the point. He
emphatically discarded the slightest hope
that some of the delegates had as to the
union oflicials having any plan. In short,
he said there was no way out. However,
he said that the union would pay the
monthly card dues of those earning less
than one day a week for the next four
months. A mere sop! He admitted that
the A. F. of L. oﬂicialdom was bankrupt
of ideas.

Fellow workers, this is now more than
ever our work. We must see to it that our
unions send delegates (the Pressmen’s
Union No. 51 has already elected del-
egates) to the Unemployment Insurance
Congress in Washington, D. C., January 5,
6 and 7. '

We must have unemployment insur-
ance, and nothing short of the “Work-
ers’ Unemployment and Social Insurance
Bill, H. R. 2827.” All others are a snare

and a delusion dictated by the boss class
for further worsening the conditions of the
workers.

Fellow workers, see that your chapel does
its part by electing a delegate and sending
him to Washington to vote and work for a
real unemployment insurance bill. This is
our ﬁght. There is no other way out!

The Letter Box

To the Editor of -the Hearst Worker:

December 2 has arrived! The “office”
now has control of the sixth day. The sub
who beneﬁtted by this day and who w-ill
not get a situation is now left out in the
cold.

What is to be done? How will he feed
his family? These two questions must be
answered now!

The situation holder cannot and must not
be a party -to the dumping of his unfor-
tunate brother.

There is but one solution in this matter.
The scales must be re-opened! You must
repudiate the scale that you voted for and
demand that the “forgotten man” be taken
care of.

The scale that you voted for was the
bosses’ scale. The Communist Party
Nucleus in the shop asked you in an open
letter to “Vote Down the Howard Scale.”

I foresaw what would happen and pro-
posed a scale that would help both the em-
ployed and the unemployed worker.

The regular and the sub have but one
problem. They are both exploited by
Hearst and his class who live like parasites.
We, fellow workers, are the ones who pro-
duce the wealth for Hearst’s yachts,
ranches, and estates! Our labor produces
every dollar that he squanders!

Therefore we must act unitedly! We
must denounce Howard and his bureau-
cratic actions! We must denounce his
scale!

Compositors of the Hearst Plant! De-
mand the re-opening of the newspaper scale!
Demand the 30-hour week with the same
pay that you now receive! Demand that
the “forgotten man” be fed and that his
wife and children do not suffer.

This can be done at a union meeting.
Demand that Mr. Howard call a special
meeting for this purpose and act! Save
your union from destruction by helping
yourself.

ABOLISH JOINT STANDING BOARD

Henceforth the chairman of the New
York American and Evening Journal shall
work on his job at least one day every two
weeks. It has been so decreed by the Joint
Standing Board. For the first time in the
history of Big Six, a shop chairman, recog-
nized as an ofﬁcer of the union, is taken
away from his official duties and required to
work more than the one day in every three
months, which is the most required of any
other situation-holder.

This decision sets a precedent which is
dangerous to our union. It first of all
violates the right of the union to decide who
are its officers. It deprives the chairman of
the right to decide when he will. work or
take off. It will tend to endanger the right
that every regular now has of maintaining
his job by working at least one day in every
three months. i

Why was so detrimental a ruling foisted
upon the union?

In 1932, when the infamous Saulter deci-
sion was rendered, a Joint Standing Board
was set up with two representatives from
the union and two from the publishers. Its

purpose is to settle disputes arising during -

the period of the contract.
After Mr. Zartarian was elected chairman

of the J-A-M Chapel, on a program of V

protecting the rights of the workers, the
management put every obstacle it could in
his way. He had defeated their candidate,
and so they were determined to ruin his
term of chairmanship if possible. In order
to undermine his prestige and reduce the
time at his disposal for chapel matters, Mr.
Hosmer, superintendent, demanded that he
work 30 days on his job during the year.

The matter was brought up before the Joint“

Standing Board for settlement, but they
could not come to a decision. Mr. Rouse
then decided that we might even get a worse
decision if it was left to a ﬁfth member, an
arbitrator, to decide. Instead of ﬁghting
against the bosses’ request to the very end,
and if the decision went against the union,
have it appealed, because it violates the law
of the union, he acquiesced to the bosses’
demand.

Demand Decision Be Rescinded.’

Fellow printers, this decision is a “warning
to us. If we don’t want to see shop con-
ditions, which mean so much to us, gradu-
ally wiped out, let’s act now! It must be our
turn to demand. We must demand the
rescinding of this decision.

The Joint Standing Board, innocent in
appearance, is actually an arbitration board.
And anytime the publishers stand to gain
by forcing the issue on some shop question,
they will use the  S. B. to get decisions in
their favor.

When we negotiate the new scale, we
must do away entirely with the Joint Stand-
ing Board.

No more arbitration, and away with
bosses’ faint Boards.
