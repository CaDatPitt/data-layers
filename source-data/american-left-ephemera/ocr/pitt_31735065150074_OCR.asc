DENVER-—-Mine-Mill’s 5%-month strike at the
Magma Copper company mine, mill and smelter in Super-
ior, Ariz. was brought to a victorious end Jan. 17 with
agreement on a new contract expiring June 30, 1961

OFFICIAL ORGAN INTERNATIONAL UNION of MINE. MILL and SMELTER WORKERS which provides for a “fat” 22.5 cents per hour package in

wage and fringe benefit increases.

  Judge Sets
ﬁ March Date
A  On Motions.

DENVER——Judge Alfred Ar; ’
raj last month set March 14
as the date for argument here

‘on three post-trial motions

filed by the defense following
the "conviction last Dec. 17 of
nine present and past Mine-
Mill leaders on charges of con-
spiring to defraud the govern-

.-ment by violating -the -Taft-

Hartley act.

The judge -at the same time
ordered all nine defendants, _
as well as the three others
who pleaded no contest before
the trial, to appear in court
on that date for sentencing
should the motions be denied.

Filed by defense counsel
Nathan Witt, Telford Taylor
and George Francis, the mo-
tions seek dismissal of the en-
tire case, a judgment of ac-
quittal or the granting of a
new trial. I

The new trial motion is

- based mainly on the defense

position that Judge Arraj
committed ten specified errors
during the course, of the trial.

I . ‘The motion in arrest of judg-
ment attacks the legal validity

of the indictment itself‘ under
which the defendants were
tried. Another motion asksfor
judgment of acquittal on the
grounds both that prosecution
is barred by the statute of
limitations and that the evi-
dence is insufficient to sustain
the conviction.‘ -

Should the motions be de-
nied, the case will be appealed
to the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the 10th Circuit in Denver
and thereafter, if necessary, to
the Supreme Court of the
United States.

By inonths end, the list of

behind Mine-Mill's fight in-

boards and hundreds of locals
affiliated with some 40 inter-

K C ' ‘I
(Special to Mine-Mill Union)
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Civil
rights is shaping up as the
kick-off battle as the second

session of the 86th Congress
settles down from opening
ceremonies on Jan. 6 to its
short, election-year term.

With the blessing of the
_ anx-
ious to resolve the divisive
civil rights issue as soon as
possible, House members are
taking advantage of. a dis-
charge petition to force early
debate on a -bill bottled up in
the Rules Committee since
last August. . -

The outcome of this strug-

“ gle, a major test of strength

between Northern liberals and
reactionary f o r c e s grouped
around Southern Democrats,
is expected to furnish a sig-
nificant tipoff on the overall
performance of this session.
Highlight of the opening
days of the new session was
President Eisenhower’s State-
of-the-Union message delivered
before a joint session Jan. 7.
Peace and prosperity were the
major themes of the Chief
Executive’s annual report.

 II‘ I)‘

‘OF THE SEARCH for peace,
he said: “With both sides of
this divided world in posses-
sion of unbelievably destruc-

Rights Test Faces

tive weapons, mankind ap-
proaches a state where mutual
annihilation becomes a possi-
bility. No other fact of to-
day's world equals this in im-
portance—-it colors everything
we say, plan and do.”

The President noted that
“recent Soviet _deportment and
pronouncements suggest the
possible, opening of a some-
what less strainai period” that
appears to open the way for
renewed» negotiations; Later
he» went on to say '“we ap-
proach, this apparently new
opportunity with the utmost
seriousness.”

On domestic policy, the
President singled out four
questions for special mention:
national strikes, the farm prob-
lem, inflation and civil rights.

=l= * I!‘

ON THE TOUCHY labor
issue, the President avoided
calling for any new legisla-
tion. I n s t e a d, he said he
“would encourage regular dis-
cussions between management
and labor” to consider the pub-
lic interest.

In his reference to the civil
rights controversy, Eisenhower
told Congress “Our first duty”
is to protect the right to vote
“against all encroachment.”
He asked the lawmakers to
consider his 1959 proposals
and the “additional construc-

tive recommendations” of the
Civil Rights Commission. The
latter statement was inter--
preted as a boost for a pro-
posal calling for federal reg-
istrars in Southern states.

As for the other two ques-
tions, and generally on the en-
tire subject of domestic policy,
the President repeated pre-
vious recommendations.

I With the "Chief Executive

more or less passing the buck
on domestic issues to Con-
gress, wide-open speculation
broke out on what is likelyfto

a week before the opening of
the Democratic convention
July 11.

Most legislators also claimed
that the fall elections will
strongly influence the course
of the session. Loud po1itick-
ing by Presidential aspirants,
by House members and Sena-
tors is likely, the seasoned
hands say,’ to occupy more
time and energy than legisla-
tion itself.

For the time being at least,
the need for additional union-

curbing legislation is be-ing
played down by Democrats and
Republican leaders. Typical of
today’s attitude is the pitch by
Senate Majority Leader Lyn-
don Johnson that the steel
strike is now “water over the

despite earlier settlements by
Mine-Mill and other unions
with the company, hold-outs
by locals of the IAM, BLF&E
and Railway System Federa-
tion were delaying a return to
normal Kennecott operations
in that state.

THE MAGMA strike was
the first in the company’s 47
years of operation in Superior.
The new contract was the sec-
ond ever signed by Magma
with any union, the first being
with the same Local 938 which
came into existence only a
year and a half ago after
Mine-Mill’s organization of the
Magma Superior operations.

Included in the two-year

agreement were a general T.

wage increase of 8% cents an
hour immediately and an 81/;

board wage increase effective
July 1, 1960, plus an addi-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Anaconda Pvids
Laughs for Tooele

Striking members of Tooele,
Utah, Local 55 feel they
scored a “first” in labor re-
lations with the Anaconda
company. Everybody got a
laugh when the company at-
tempted to negotiate around
the union committee by send-
ing out a “Dear John” letter
with a back-towork offer ——
everybody, that is, except the
postman who had to work un-
til 10:00 p.m. delivering the
letters from house to house
because they were sent SPE-
CIAL DELIVERY!

At a special meeting at-

tended by 95 per cent of the

membership, the “special de-
livery” offer was answered by
a unanimous standing vote to
advise the company it was not
going to tell the union how to
run its affairs and, further,
to inform -the company that
the men were in no mood to
negotiate in a bargain base-
ment after a 51/2-month strike.

A-Z Local Sparks
-Pension Plan Unity

Fairmont, Ill., Local 82’s
preparations for bargaining
with American Zinc on a new
pension plan was well under
way last month. The local in-
itiated and held meetings on
the plan with other union rep-
resentatives from AZ proper-
ties in Monsanto and Hills-
boro, Ill., and also planned to
expand the unity group to in-
clude AZ plants in Mascot,

Tenn. and Columbus, Ohio.

The joint meetings have
been sanctioned by the respec-
tive international unions with
which the locals are affiliated,
although no organizers have
been present. Realizing the
need for close cooperation, the
five locals have worked to-
gether to establish basically
identical proposals with a View
toward consolidating them be-
fore starting formal negotia-
tions with the company.

California Locals
Set Joint Meeting

the date
scheduled for a one-day con-
ference of Mine-Mill locals in
northern California, to be held
in the Local 51 union hall at
Rodeo. Under discussion will
be support for Mine-Mill
strikes still in progress, union
defense, the Landrum-Griffin
law and other issues. District

ers and Mine-Mill Vice-Presi-
dent Asbury Howard are ex-
pected to participate.

More Contributions
For Strike Relief I

Seven Min-e-Mill locals in
Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Idaho, California and
New Mexico contributed nearly
$2,500 in strike relief last
month, according to reports
to the Mine - Mill Union. Most
have made previous donations
as well. Bayard, N. M., Local
890 sent in $500 despite its
shrunken treasury from the
Kennecott strike. More checks
totaling $227 came in from
Nixon, N. J. Local 679. In Cali-
fornia, Selby Local 51 donated
$300, while Sonora Local 542
voted $100 for the strike and
$25 per month to the Mine-Mill
Defense Fund. Conda, Ida. Lo-
cal 622 sent in $150. Additional
contributions directly to the
strikers in Montana were sent
by Ansonia, Conn., Local 445,
bringing their total donations
as of Jan. 19 to $3,652.60, and
by Buffalo, N.’ Y., Local 593,
whose donations as of that
date to d $2,500.

 Canada last month,
the  national office
and locals in Ontario, British
Columbia, Q u e b e c, Alberta,
No,-_;_ West Territory and
Y“ on Territory sent in a
tg_.tal of more than $16,000,
gjfinging the total from
"Canada to date to more than
$50,000.

Anti-Strike Moves
' Dumped in Nevada

Tw o decertification cam-
paigns started against Mine-
Mill in Nevada during the
latter part of the Kennecott
strike were dumped before
they ever got to first base. A
petition filed with the NLRB
against Local 124 at Ruth was

withdrawn. Another circulated .

against Local 233 at McGill
never got enough signatures
to qualify forpfiling. ’

l. A. Galuz, l. Z. Terun, ‘Charlie Sandi and Dillard Woods.

Members in Utah
Appeal UC Denial

“Mine-Mill members at Ken-
necott properties in Utah last
month appealed a state Em-
ployment Security department
order ruling them ineligible
for unemployment benefits

despite the fact that they are
not working through any fault
of their own. Although .Mine-
Mill settled its strike against
Kennecott on Dec. 16 and
workers have since returned
to their jobs in Nevada, Ari-
zona and New Mexico, the
union’s members in Utah have
not gone back to work be-
cause the continued strike by
craft and "railway "workers
have kept those operations
shut down.

Should appeals to the state
Industrial commission fail, the
next step is expected to take
the case -to the Utah Supreme
court. Governor George D.
Clyde promised a Mine-Mill
delegation Jan. 13 that he
would do all he could to help
get the workers’ unemploy-
ment compensations claims be-
fore the state high court.

Locals Play Santa
To Children. Needy

Mine-Mill locals throughout
the country each year spread
a bit of cheer at Christmas
time with parties for the chil-
dren and charitable visits to
the sick and needy of the com-
munity. Here are just a few
examples reported to the
Mine-Mill Union:

In Douglas, Ariz., Local -470
gave a hugely successful
Christmas party for members’
children despite their strike at
the Phelps Dodge smelter.
Bobbie Segovia played Santa
Claus for about 1,600 kids, in-
cluding many in the commu-
nity not connected with the
union.. Every child received
gifts, Christmas bags, pop and
other party trappings. Mem-
bers of the local’s entertain-
ment committee prepared for
the party by soliciting dona-
tions from area merchants, of
whom about 98 per cent con-
tacted came through with
money, toys, candy or other
goods.

Strikers’ children were also
given a happy time by Local
700 in Los Angeles with the
help of contributions from
Mine-Mill Local 445 in An-
sonia, Conn., and locals of the
UE, Longshoremen’s u n i o n
and Furniture Workers in the
area. The union played .host
with a ' Christmas party for
some,300 children of strikers
at Local 700’s Phelps Dodge
and AS&R units. A good time

was had by all the kids loaded.

down with toys, candy, fruit,

nuts, popcorn and Christmas V,

stockings. ,
Christmas baskets, including

all the trimmings for a turkey
dinner, were distributed to ten
needy families by the organi-
zational and social activities
committee of Local 18 and its
Ladies Auxiliary N 0. 65 in
Kellogg and Wallace, Idaho.
The local and auxiliary, also
distributed oranges, cigars and
mints to patients at the Sho-
shone County hospital. About
450 children in Wallace and
1,200 children in Kellogg at-
tended Mine-Mill’s free Christ-
mas shows at both places.

Montana Strike
Needs Stressed

VFHIS COLUMN is "being written on the

way to Montana. Now is as good a
time as any to pay tribute to the‘ Butte
miners, and the Great Falls, Tooele, East
Helena and those Anaconda smeltermen
who have stood firm against

break their ranks and force
a cheap settlement down
their throats.

Negotiations in Montana
for over twenty-five years 
have been conducted by a 
Joint Bargaining Commit-
tee representing‘ all of the
company’s Montana prop-
erties. From the very be-
ginning of the strike the ;
company attempted to split
this group.

They found some willing takers in the
leadership of Local 117. Week after week this
group attempted to stampede the Local into
splitting from the rest of the Montana Ana-
conda workers. ,In the middle of December
they succeeded in -doing so. Within a week
they had a contract signed, sealed, and de-

livered.
‘k ‘k * V

HIS" contract in no way compared to those

negotiated in the rest of the industry. In-
stead of the 14 to 18-cent Wage increases ne-
gotiated elsewhere, final payment on this wage
increase to be effective July 1, 1960, the Local
117. workers were ‘handed a three-year agree-
ment with a total wage increase of 14% cents.
In return for a somewhat improved health and
Welfare program and an additional holiday, the
contract sets aside the pension opener from
July 1, 1960 tothe termination of the contract
in 1962. It also surrendered the workers’ vaca-
tion rights for 1960 so that most workers will
receive approximately a third of their normal
vacation pay this year.

This kind of a contract could never ‘receive
the approval of the International Union. To
get over this“hurdle the company and the Local
117 leadership illegally eliminated the Interna-
tional as a party to the agreement. ’

From the moment -the ‘company put its
signature on thisagreement it ‘was hell-bent to

Dichter

V force this same contract down the throats of.

the rest of the Anaconda workers.

*‘A'*

THE mails have been filled with “Dear John”
letters, the newspapers with company ads,"
the news columns with company statements-—
all of them repeating the same theme—~you’ll
take this contract or stay out until you’re
starved into submission. .

In spite of dire need the workers have stood
firm. Montana is a cold place in the winter-
time. Kids needs shoes, warm clothing.

The International has been sending in as
much as it has. Many a Local Union from the
rest of the labor, movement in Montana has
contributed. Our American Brass Locals have
sent in special contributions. But" the need
grows greater every day.

‘Ir *_ *
ANY International Unions are now be-

ginning to realize the importance of our
strike. Though our strike did not involve_V as

many workers- as did the steel strike, the issues 3

in our strike were equally important and de-
cisive as those in steel. We are hoping that
this realization. will mean increasing financial
support from these unions. 9’ '
Those who rallied to our, support from the
very beginning of -our’ strike will not be for-
gotten by the miners and smeltermen of this

A country. Theyyinclude the jT_eaI_nsters,~'VInterna--'
 tional. Longshoremen - a nd iwarehousemen,

ican Communications Association, Montana

- Farmers Union, San Francisco Building Trades,

Council and the officers -and members. of‘ hun-
dreds of Local" unions in all sections of-. the
labor movement throughout the: country.

The workers in Montana can force the
powerful Anaconda company to negotiate a

just agreement, but to do so they will -have to ’

have increasingly greater financial support.
They’ve got the guts and the will to beat the
company.—IRVING DICHTER.

If you earn $4,800 a year, the amount with-

‘ held from your pay will increase from $120 to

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

development has come in the
House with the open forma-
tion of the Democratic Study
Group, a loose caucus claim-
ing the allegiance of between

125 and 150 liberal Democrats. '

Rep. Lee Metcalf of Montana
is acting chairman of the Study
Group.

Its initial program of seven
planks largely parallels the
welfare legislation outlined by
the ‘leadership, V but with the
difference that members of
the caucus will fight for pro-
posals with substance, more

in keeping with labor_’s view-_

point, rather than watered-
down compromises.~
Moreover, it is reported‘ that
the Study Group has included
as an ‘eighth point a resolu-
tion demanding a continuation

of the suspension of nuclear
bomb tests. The intention
here, it is said, is to make a
first break with the Truman-
Acheson cold war position and
provide liberal Democrats. with
an opportunity to take an af-
firmative stand on the peace
issue.

IN THE SENATE, liberals
look to be on the way to dent-
ing — Lyndon Johnson’s “one-
man rule” over legislative
operations. They have forced
agreement on regular cau-
cuses and may succeed in
bringing about a more agres-
sive approach to the coming
legislative wars.

To what extent worried lib-
erals will carry their determi-
nation to reclaim the record of
the" 86th Congress should be
shown when Congress, as ex-
pected, ‘gets down to‘ brass
tacks within the coming weeks
on the explosive civil rights
legislation. ' 

Johnson is committed _to
Senate consideration of this
issue by mid-February. To de-
liver, he and Rayburn are help-

ing to grease the way for *

adoption of a bill in‘ the House
by the end of this month.

The bill headed for debate
in the lower‘ ‘chamber is far
from a meaningful measure.
Titled HR 8601, it is a weak
compromise, the product of an
“unholy alliance” in the ’Ju-
diciary Committee of Southern
Democrats and Republicans.
Its chief provision would make
obstruction of court orders for

_ school desegregation a fed-
eral, crime.

Liberals are advocating such
additional provisions as fed-
eral registrars to be stationed
in Dixieland states and.au_thor-
ity for the Attorney General
to institute court suits for, pro-
tection of all. civil rights.

Top Montana AFL-CIO, Farmer 

Leaders Urge Copper Strike Help

BUTTE,‘Mont.——Declarations of support from .the top lead-

ers ‘of the AFL-CIO and Farmers Union in Montana last month '

gave a shot in the arm to Mine-Mill members on strike against

the Anaconda company.

President James Umber of the Montana AFL-CIO, speak-

ing before the Great. Falls Farmer-Labor Institute on Jan. 9

!

told the meeting that the copper miners are in supreme need
of friends at this time when the Anaconda company was out
to destroy them. Stating that “a terrible wrong has been done

the copper worker and his children,” the AFL-CIO leader said

that the Mine-Mill strike is the problem of all labor in Montana.

Earlier, -President Leonard Kenfield of the Montana Farm-
ers Union directed an appeal-for-funds letter to all local and‘
county Farmers Union officers calling attention to the issue of
“parity, of income” in the Mine-Mill strike and urging “help for

the distressed families of the miners and mill and smelter work-

ers." —

Battle for the V

Ballot Persists

HIS MONTH Americans everywhere
will be participating in the 35th an-
nual celebration of Negro History week,
from Feb. 7-14. It’s during this week,
that the birthdays of two great Americans
are commemorated—Abra- ~ —
ham Lincoln on Feb. 12 and
Frederick Douglass on
Feb. 14 —‘ both men asso-
ciated incur country's his-
tory with. the struggle for
liberty and freedom for all.
It is during this week,
also, that we must pause
and consider that the strug-
gle which identifies Lincoln
and Douglas in the same
cause, still continues—and
that while a great War of

Howard
emancipation was once fought and Won, the
battle to establish its principle persists today.
I am speaking of the battle for the ballot.

In April, 1944, the’ Supreme. Court of the
United States removed the last vestige of con- .

stitutional sanction for the so-called “white
primary,” which had been used so effectively
to prevent Southern Negroes from voting in
any significant numbers during the period
from 1890 to 1944. '
r * ‘k * L V
N THE decision of Smith vs. Allwright, a
majority, of the Court, through Justice
Reed, said: “It now may be taken as a postu-

 

 

late that the right to vote in such a primary ,

for the fnomination of candidates without dis-
crimination by state, like the right to vo-te in a
general election, is a right secured by the Con-
stitution. By the terms, of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment, that right may not be§abri,dg'ed by any
State 3 on ‘account of race. ‘Under our con-
stitution the great privilegeV of the ballot may
not be denied a man by the .5Stia,te because of
his color.” ' ’ 4‘

Yet from that time to this _date Negroes
are still battling for the ballot, still being
denied the basic right to vote.

The President of the United States saidin ’

his State of the Union message thatin all his-
tory “the right to vote has been one of the
strongest pillars of a free society,” and that

V “our first duty is to protect this right against

all encroachmentsf’,
* ‘A’ it

ECAUSE of the denial of the right to vote
Congress, in .1957, established a Civil
Rights Commission to look into this denial. The
Commission’s Director of Complaints arranged
with the chairman of the Macon County Board

of Registrars (Tuskegee, Ala.) to examine the,

county’s voters’ registration records on Oct.
20, 1958, but when the commission’s agents
arrived at the court house on the appointed‘
date the chairman of the Board of Registrars
told them that “By orders of Attorney General

Patterson, the records would not be made’
available to the Commission on Civil Rights.” .

The Commission thus encountered the first
official resistance to its attempts to carry out
the task assigned to it by the Congress of the
United States.

Nevertheless, the Commission did manage

to bring out and publish some facts not gen-
In 1958, for ex- ‘

erally known to the public.
ample, the Commission found that in some
counties in Alabama no Negro was allowed to
vote. . -

mains the same, except now there ~is-~éno 41

LL of labor and the people of America

must work to make the sunlight of de- ,

mocracy shine over our country. Citizens of
other lands who look to us for guidance must
be asking: “How can the American Congress

be split over such a basic right as the right i

to vote? ‘How can a nation so deeply com-

'mitted to the democratic principle of equality.

of opportunity be embroiled in such an angry
controversy over fundamental rights?”

Let’s assure democracy for everybody right-

about selling it abroad.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

February.‘ 1969,’  1 

Counsel for Defense

Summations to the jury took place on December

14 and 16, with all three defense lawyers partici-
pating. '

’ General Counsel Witt opened for the defense.

Since the theory of the government was that the de-

. fendants were part of a small clique which ran Mine-

. Mill during the period of the alleged conspiracy

from 1947 to 1956, Witt showed from the evidence it-

self how democratic Mine-Mill is and how it is the»:
I membership which makes -and‘ decides policy. The

policy of non - compliance with Taft-Hartley was

bership in 1949. When Eckert, Mason, and Gardner,,~’
three government Witnesses, challenged Mine-Mill;
and its policies, it was the membership which de-;

feated them. -4 . _
’ tion in the fall of 1948 that Mr. Worthington was

Witt also compared the prosecution witnesses
with those for the defense. The prosecution wit-
nesses consisted of three paid ex-Communist inform-
ers and professional witnesses and a group of dis-
gruntled ex-Mine-Mill officials and staff members all

 of whom’ had been repudiated by the membership.

The defense witnesses‘ included a large group of
rank and filers, staff members like Verne Curtis and

" and two business men. Witt showed how Fred”:

_- : Gardner, the main prosecution witness, had been ex-E

posed as an army deserter and a perjurer.

Defense counsel George Francis, of the Denver
i bar, analyzed the testimony of several of the prose-
cution witnesses and showed how inconsistent and
improbable it was. He criticized the prosecution se-
verely for injecting the race issue by trying to show
that it was Communist Party policy that -Negroes
be promoted to leadership in Mine-Mill and that it
was the Party which dictated that Van Camp step
aside for Ray Dennis as District 3 Board Member in
1949 and that Charles Wilson step aside as Eastern
Vice-President in 1953 in favor of Asbury Howard.

Telford Taylor discussed many other aspects of
the case in addition to the evidence relating to the
alleged conspiracy as such. Lack of space prevents
us from reprinting his summation in full, so we are
reprinting here only excerpts from his analysis of
the proof of the alleged conspiracy. Following are the
excerpts:

I There Was No Conspiracy

. . . The prosecution has sought to establish that

Mine-Mill had a policy of non-compliance during the ’

‘two years from July, 1947, when the Act was passed,
to July, 1949, and the Communist Party also opposed
trade union compliance during that period. But came

V“ July, 1949, the Communist Party changed its policy,

and said that under certain circumstances trade union
leaders who were members of the Party could sign
affidavits. ' I

‘Mine-Mill changed its policy, therefore, says the

prosecution, one dominated the other and they invite -

you to infer from this testimony about what we might
call parallel policies—this is evidence based on par-
allelism between policies about the Taft-Hartley Act
—they invite you to make the jump that if it can be
shown that the policies about the Taft-Hartley Act
were similar during that pre-conspiracy period, then

we can assume that the defendants all "agreed to?"

gether when the Union voted to comply in J uly, 1949.

Well, when you say it out that way, it sounds
pretty remote and speculative, and it isn’t my idea
of solid evidence proving beyond a reasonable doubt.
I think its intrinsic weakness must be obvious to you.

Mr. Broome is asking you to make an awfully
long jump. He is asking you to come to conclusions
about matters of trade union policy that are ten to
twelve years old here. All this is a period that ended

 , r“--ten years ago or more, and began twelve years ago,

and he is inviting this jury sitting in Denver in 1959
to cast its mind back through the eyes of these wit-
nesses to come to a judgment about the factors that
determined the policies of this Union on compliance.
And then, having made that judgment, which
goodness knows is difficult enough with the passage
[ of time and the complexity of all this, to then infer
that because there was a correspondence in time

«during. this period that therefore there was an agree-
,  ment among the defendants to file false affidavits.
- . fAnd.I say that is just too “far-fetched andspeculative

._jasf,the basis for a conspiracy charge. _
‘  ‘And yet, I c'an-understand the Government's ne-

fnothing %els'e’= in the -record th

         

 C 331?? here. be¢aIJSe.- ladies: and. Vgentlemen..a ‘“’there..
, t- t .. 

any agreement among the defendants, except this
parallelism of policy during those two years. . . .

Now, these are the jumps and the guesses and
the assumptions that the prosecution is asking you
to make. I won’t stop at this point to remind you
again about reasonable doubt and presumptions of
innocence. Those things must be kept in your minds.

But it seems to me that there are such obvious
and fatal flaws in. this theory that Mr. Broome has
spun for us this morning that I don’t think we need
to get to matters of reasonable doubt and presump-
tion of innocence. I would just like to make some
of these flaws and gaps explicit this afternoon be-
fore I stop.

VVell, one of the major flaws and gaps in Mr.
Broome’s theory is that he has sought from the very
start of this proceeding right up till this morning to
try to have you View this matter as if Mine-Mill
were the only Union in the world, as if this were a
matter that concerned Mine-Mill alone, and he has
tried to give you the impression that Mine-Mill
policy on compliance was somehow different from
that of other unions, and that it was different be-
cause of domination by the Communist Party. In
his opening statement he spoke to you about other
unions that complied in 1948, that Mine-Mill kept on
holding out because of Communist domination. .

And then this morning in his summation he came
back to the same theme, his obvious purpose being
to convey to you that Mine-Mill was somehow out in
left field on this thing and was sticking to this policy
of non-compliance, whereas all the other unions were
good little boys and were falling in line with the
Board.

Well, now, despite .the prosecution’s effort to
convey this impression, I think it you will think back

adopted by the membership in 1947 reaffirmed by /: over therecord testimony there isn’t a single word of

the membership in 1948, and changed by’ the mem-,I

evidence to show that there was any situation of this
sort at all.

Murray Also Opposed T-H

For example, take this very Mine-Mill conven-

reading from those proceedings.”"Yoii rf1'ay“remem-

ﬁber that after he read some of them I read some
 more of them and the delegates or the delegate who
lwas opposing compliance there in 1948 was basing
this opposition on the example of Mr. Philip Murray. _ 1

He was reading from what Mr. Murray had had

 to say about the Taft-Hartley Act being a sin and

a legal monstrosity and giving all kinds of reasons

ing with it. And then near the end of the trial Mr.
Witt read to you from various other documents of
Mine-Mill which also showed the factor of the op-
position of Murray and of Steel, who is a very large
factor in the situation. There is a_ lot more of the
same sort of thing in the record, but time is passing.

I do not want to exhaust you any more than I
have to, and I think this is enough to show that this
whole notion of the prosecution that there is some-
thing strange or unique about Mine-Mill policy on
compliance is just absolutely without any founda-
tion. ' '

”""* There is nothing to show that this union was
t governed on this question by anything other than
ithe trade union factors that were affecting trade
 unions as a whole. Not one thing. And as soon as
 one hears that in mind it becomes apparent that this
 whole business of parallelism ‘of policy is begin-
‘ ning to vanish. .

We Now, there is another great flaw in this paral-

lelism argument that Mr. Broome is putting up, in
his effort to show conspiracy by inference from these‘
parallels, and that is that he is trying to give you
the impression that Mine-Mﬂl policy has been domi-
nated and fixed by these gentlemen sitting around
in a semi-circle behind me here, that they were a
sort of clique or a gang who between them could
manipulate the union and make them go this way
or that way at their will. . . .

Mr. Broome might have something to base his
argument on if it appeared that these defendants
had been first establishing the non-compliance pol-
icy and then the compliance policy over the objec-
tions of other people in the Union. If it appeared
that the other officers and leaders of the Union had

- a very different idea about all this and they were be-

ing rushed into these policies and forced into them
by the defendants, then one might say, “Well, this
is domination.” ' V "j

But the prosecution’s own evidence shows that

that,,wasn’t the situation at all.

Of’ course there were some dissenters. This
whole matter of compliance with Taft-Hartley was
a difficult and complicated matter and opinions
differed. Mr. Eckert had one view, other people had
another.

But all the evidence shows that these policies
that were adopted, first of non-compliance, then of
compliance, had general support among’ the officers
and among the members at large. This is no evil

ibrain child that is on trial here. Their _votes, first
‘for non-compliance, then for compliance, were joined

Appeal for Human Jusﬁce

Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have very little
more to say, and when I sit down Mr. Broome will
bemhere again with some more inferences.

Certainly none of them testified to

/A '1 recall, for example, that Mr. Broome in his
summation referred to this fact, that Philip Mur- -

ray had also opposed compliance with the Taft-Hart-

,ley Act and Mr. Broome described that as a pretty
gclever matter for Mr. Travis and the defense to
9? bring up. Pretty smart ‘matter. And he said that he
‘knew Mr. Murray’s motives must have been differ-
}ent. Well, has he brought any evidence in here
 about Mr. Murray’s motives? I don’t recall any.
 And is a fact smart? Isa fact stupid? Mr. Mur- ‘
='.§'ray’s attitude on compliance is a fact, and facts are
‘tfacts.

1

I don’t know what a smart fact or a stupid fact
is. It seems to me that you will have to decide this

case on the intelligence and common sense that God  '
-has given us to pass on factual problems and you
‘ have got to‘ decide on this in terms of human-»¢ —

THE MINE-MILL UNION

PENSION REFUND CHECKS averaging about $1,000 each were received recently by workers at U. S. Metals

in Carteret, NJ. as a result of Mine-Mill local 837 contract settlement last summer in which the

 2 union ‘negotiated a new non-contributory pension plan to replace the old contributory plan formerly in

 old plan was instituted in 1950. Handing worker his pension refund check is local 837 President Paul

Contract Settlement Averts

The; 7-month contract dispute between the United Steelworkers of America and

major producers in the steel industry came to a climax early in January with the
I signing of ‘a new agreement with" most, but not all, of the steel companies. A number
7 of steel companies ‘still faced strikes as this report was being written.

opened the plants after the
steel workers had struck in
mid-July and kept them shut

' down for four months.

«quarters differed by as much
as eight cents per hour on the
total value of the steel settle-

COPPER AND BRASS Research Association predicts‘ 1960‘
will be a big year for the red metal with U. S. mine production

reaching a new high of 1,160,000 tons, refined production of  I

about 1,500,000 tons, and brass mill shipments of nearly two bil-
lion pounds, up 100 million pounds over 1959 and 500 million

U. S. COPPER MINE PRODUCTION loss to end of January
due to strike amounted to nearly 400,000 tons of copper, plus
additonal amounts of zinc, and by-product lead, manganese,
gold, silver and lesser metals. Total value of production lost
during strike is between $275,000,000 and $300,000,000.

ZINC prices moved up, LEAD prices moved downward at
the turn of the year. Zinc went up one cent to 13 cents per
pound in January, and the premium for special high grade,
quoted by most smelters went up an additional one-half cent, ’
making a total jump of one and one-half cents in the price of ‘
premium grade zinc. Demand at the new, higher price con-
tinues strong, and market observers say further advances are in
prospect in 1960. American Metal Market says U. S. will use
15 per cent more slab zinc this year than last. Lead, priced at
13 cents early in December, moved down to 12 cents following
settlement of the strike at American Smelting and Refining
Company’s lead smelters and refineries. The company was able
to resume shipments from stocks as soon as the strike was
settled. Demand for lead has been strong, due to increased
use of lead in motor fuel and batteries, but prospects for better ,
prices depend on reduction of heavy stocks at smelters.

operating, due to continued strike by craft unions, five men
were injured by the blast, none critically. Cause of explosion
was not immediately determined, but was thought to have been
caused by a gas leak. *

SILVER use in U." S. last year was up 18 per cent over 1958.
Main reason for increased consumption was greater industrial ‘
use of silver in solders, brazing alloys, electrical conductor,
chemicals, aircraft, missiles and rockets. About one-half of
U. S. silver production comes from mines under contract with

our decision to lend assistance
to our brother trade union-
ists.”

Hoffa’s letter listed two
points which he said are at
issue:

“1) These convictions were
based upon application of a
law which had been repealed
at the time of conviction. If
this practice of ‘retroactive
persecutions’ were to .be up-
held, a tremendously powerful
weapon would be placed in the

rghands of those who hope to

destroy militant trade union-
ism in this country. If this
principle is permitted to stand,
the entire trade union move-
ment stands in jeopardy of
continued persecution and dis-
ruption. On this ground alone,
we believe it is urgent for us

- as trade unionists to assist fi-

nancially in efforts to reverse
these convictions ‘through ap-
peal. _

“2) The fact that these con-
victions were on a charge of
‘conspiracy,’ rather than a di-

rect charge of violation of the

law's provisions is of critical
importance to the trade union
movement. The use of the
‘conspiracy’ charge is well-

known for the threat it has,

posed to organized labor. It
was under the law of conspir-
acy that the trade union move-
ment was at one time held il-
legal in its entirety. "' Urfiler
many state laws today, legiti-
mate trade union activities are

. being restrained under the

theory of conspiracy.”
Respected jurists have spo-

I ‘ <*’.*"iken out against the govern-

ment’s use of the conspiracy
charge technique when it could
not prove a crime was com-
mitted, Hoffa added and, wish-
ing Mine-Mill success in the
appeal, concluded:

“We feel that it is of vital

1 ‘importance that ‘we lend our

aid to make sure that trade
unionists are fully protected
against the abuses that grow

out of the use of conspiracy
charges by the government.”
From other important sec-
tions of labor—
President-Secretary John C.
Burke of the AF-CIO Pulp &
Paper Mill Workers, on in-
structions of his International
Executive Board, sent a size-
able check “to aid in the strike
of your members against the
copper companies.” “We are
wishing your organization suc-
cess in these strikes,” he wrote.
Answering a letter from one
of his locals, Secretary-Treas-
urer Patrick Gorman of the
AFL-CIO Amalgamated Meat
Cutters international urged
“complete support” for Mine-
Mill’s copper strikers, adding:
“I trust you can find a way
to be helpful to these good
people despite what has been
said concerning their leader-
ship.” His union’s official . pub-
lication, The Butcher Work-

man, also carried an editorial 1

endorsing Mine-Mi1l’s appea
for strike funds. « . - -

The AFL-CIO Amalgamated
Clothing Workers, too, called
the attention of its member-
ship to Mine-Mill's "appeal for
aid with a detailed story on
the copper strike in its official
newspaper, The Advance. “The
fight Mine-Mill is facing,” it
quoted Mine -Mill President
John Clark as saying, “is the
fight of all organized labor
and every working man and
woman in America has a big
stake in the outcome of this
struggle.”

union affiliates of the San

struction Trades Council were

  Peace Keynotes 16th Western

District Convention in Canada

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

VANCOUVER, B. C.——The 16th annual Western Dis-

trict Union Convention opened January 16 in this city -

with the strongest emphasis being placed on the Canadian
government’s expenditure for arms and “defense,” ex-
pressed both by many speakers and the banners which

covered the walls.
The latter pointed out

~‘«“‘ that one-half of the arms bud-'

get would put ten cents per
hour into the pay envelope of
every Canadian worker, or
would provide 87,500 homes
for workers at $10,000 each;
would put an increase of fif-
teen dollars per month onall
"old-age pensions, or provide a
$200 tax‘ reduction for each
worker per year. ' ‘

Peace was also stressed in
the officers’ report, including

exposition of the admitted de- —

fenseless situation of this or
any other country against nu-
clear warfare. r
Said Harvey Murphy, Vice-
President of the National
Union, “Why no attack on this
waste of the people's income?

1“, There is a fear—and this is
"‘“"‘also true in labor-—that the ex-

penditure by Canada of one
and three-quarter billions can-

not be attacked by anyone, as

it is almost a sacred dogma,
and those who would attack

’ such wastage are, by-and-large,
subversive pro-Russian
agents.”

“They don't include install-

in both Arizona and El Paso,
and were scheduled to be re-

PD negotiations took a turn
early in the month toward dis-
cussion of a three-year con-
tract counter-proposal by the
union to an inadequate two-
year offer previously made by
the company. The Mine-Mill
proposal is aimed at a 34
cents per hour package repre-
senting an annual average im-
provement of a little over 11

‘ cents for each of ‘the three
‘years, which would“be in line
