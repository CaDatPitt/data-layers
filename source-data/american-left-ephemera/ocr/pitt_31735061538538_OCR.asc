, Jobs For All!
Fight the Bosses
and Their Government!        
   --——A Statement bythe
Revolutionary Socialist League    
  (3/23/31) 

we are marching in Harrisburg today, two years after the disaster of Three:

«Mile Island, to protest the use of nuclear power, to support the coal miners in

their struggle for a decent contract and to demand jobs for everyone. The gov-
ernment, the energy companies and all the big banks and corporations in this
country are trying to expand nuclear power at the expense of our health, safety a
and lives. These same forces are also trying to attack the coal miners, to ’
take away their gains won in past struggles, to speed up production and weaken
their union, the United Mineworkers of America. The corporations are also
closing plants and speeding up production lines around the country, throwing
millions of people-out of work. Meanwhile, the government is cutting unemploy-
ment compensation, jobs programs and other benefits.

Everyone‘s standard of living is under attack by inflation, unemployment,
high taxes, and cuts in public services. Our democratic rights are threatened
by new government "security investigations." Political rights and other gains

f;!’.won in the"sixties ~~ for Blacks, Latins, women, gay people and others —— are
. being withdrawn. Controls are being taken off business‘.“right“ to pollute the

air, water, food, and workplaces by chemicals and radioactivity. Klan and Nazi
igangs are organizing to murder Blacks, Jews, Latins and unionists and to set up
a fascist dictatorship. The government is gearing up for new wars. It is
expanding military spending, bringing back the draft and sending troops to
El Salva or. T » A‘

These attacks are just parts of an overall war by the corporations, the
banks and the government ~~ the entire capitalist class that runs the country
-— against all poor and working people. The capitalist economy is falling apart
and the capitalists are trying to rebuild it on our bent backs and broken bones.»

MOVEMENT ISL GROWING

Fortunately, these attacks are not going unanswered. Todayis demonstration
is just one part of a broader movement of resistance and struggle. _Tens of
thousands of Black and white people recently marched to make Martin Luther

 

  

King‘s birthday a nationai holiday and against the racist kiiiings of Biack<
chiidren in Atienta. An anti—draft movement is growing; by the government's
own figures, 400,000 have “failed” to register. workers in_the unions are be-
ginning to organize against the piant closings and speedup. we need to buiid,
broaden, deepen and unite this growing movement against the capitaiist attacks.

‘ we need mass marches and other actions to demand jobs, housing, better schoois

and sociai services, a hait to the budget cuts, on end to nuclear power and

“war preparations, on end to the attacks on the onions and our democratic rights,
on end to racist terror. ' - '

In organizing this movement we need to keep some key points cieariy in mind.

1. Our movement must be'a movement of working class and oppressed people.

The overwheiming majority of working and oppressed oeopie have the some
common interests. when factories shut down, when schoois get more crowded, when
money for job training, hosniteis, housing or mass transit is taken away, who
suffers? Not the rich ~~ not the cepitaiists end poiiticians; It is working
and oppressed people we Biacks; Latins, women, young people, gays, peopie who
work in factories, offices, mines and miiis, the nnempioyed, the peopie who
actyaiiy make this country run and get iittie in return ~— these are the peopie
who pay the price. we need to‘hniid a movement of eii working ciess and op~
pressed peopie.¢, i ’

2.‘ we need unity.

Our main siogen shooid be: "An injury to one is an injury to aTi ea Every».
one organize to defend everyone‘s struggie.“ we must defend Biacks and Latins r

.ageinst racist attacks; fight for eonai rights for women; defend the miners;

organize for jobs for aii workers; ‘we most defend the rights of aii peopie,
including undocumented workers, gays and prisoners. Miiiions of peopie are
under attack. Divided we are.weak.—— but united we are strong.

‘ 3. we must know who our enemies are.

Our enemies.are the big utilities, the coai, oii, energy and chemical com»
panies. i i . i

Our enemies are the defense contractors who wiii be tioating in profits as
a resuit of defense contracts to produce the pianos, missiies, artiiiery, tanks"
and ships for the miiitary. In fact, the entire ruiing ciass is our enemy.

The Moral Majority, the Nazis and the Kian are our enemies.i They are for
taking away the rights of women, gays, Blacks, Asians and Latins and want to
impose their narrow views of ”moreiity”_end iifestyie on aii of us.

. Our enemy is the government that is ieeding and coordinating the ruiing
ciess attacks. The government, federai, state and iocei; is not a government
"of the peopie.” It is a government of the rich and'powerfui —~ the rniing
ciass. we cannot iook to it to soive our probiems out of the goodness of its
heart. a r . r ‘ k   r t

4.. we cannot rely on either the Repuhlioan or'the Democratic Party.

These two parties are the parties of gig business. Reagan and the Repubii—
cans are up front about this. But the Democratic Party, which points itseif as
the friend of Biack peopie, of poor peopie, of young people, of working peopie
in generai, is no different. The Kien was on the march under Carter. Racist
attacks were on the rise under Carter. Tens of thousands of peopie were thrown
out of work under Carter. Food prices, heating biiis, rent, etc., were aii

cg-

 

 

becoming too expensive to afford under Carter. ‘Both political parties, the

i Democrats and Republicans alike, are committed to massive budget cuts, lowering

wages, unemployment ~- an all—out war on working and oppressed people. we must
build our own movement, independent of and opposed to the capitalist parties.

5. We must recognize that we are part of a world-wide struggle.

This struggle includes the revolutions in Central America, Iran, and south-
ern Africa. It includes the fifty thousand who demonstrated in London last
Spring against nuclear weapons, the eighty thousand who marched in Hamburg in
February against German nuclear power, and Canadians who recently demonstrated
against Reagan during his visit. It includes the workers fighting against
Polish state capitalism and the Afghan people resisting Russian state capitalist
imperialism, and the British miners fighting against the closing of the coal
pits. All the oppressed and working people of the world are our brothers and
s sters. '

All workers everywhere have a common enemy in the capitalist rulers of the
world -- but especially the U.S. rulers who are the richest and most powerful.
we should give no support to "U.S. first" talk, to the idea that U.S. people

. are better than other people, or that it is better for a U.S. worker to have as

job than for an Arab, Japanese, or Mexican worker. we must unite with all
working people to bring down all the ruling capitalists of the U.S., Russia,
Poland, El Salvador and everywhere else. i ~ , -

The REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALIST LEAGUE is an organization dedicated to fighte
ing for freedom and total liberation for the working class and all op- .
pressed people. we believe that under capitalism--a system of exploitation
and oppression of the masses of people for the benefit of.a small capitalist
class~~such freedom will always be impossible. Exploitation, poverty and
alienation, imperialism, racism and national chauvinism, male chauvinism,
lesbian/gay oppression and the prison system are all built into capitalism.
These things cannot be "reformed away"—~they are essential to the capital-
ist system itself. ’

To change the system, to win freedom and liberation, we believe that a . .
workers‘ revolution is needed to overthrow capitalism and establish soc1al- ’
ism. Socialism is a society where working and oppressed people contra

their own lives--by taking the factories, offices and all the institutions
‘of society-out of the hands of the capitalist class and putting them dl¥
lrectly in the hands of working and oppressed people—-the immense majority.

we do not believe that there are any socialist societies in the world

today. what is called "socialism" in the countries of Eastern Europe, the
Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Albania, North Korea and Vietnam is not socialism
at all, but state capitalism. working and oppressed people have no greater
control of the factories, the economy, the government or the society as,a
whole in these countries, than do workers in "traditional" capitalist so-

c eties. ‘ e

The struggle for international socialist revolution requires the building
of an international revolutionary party. Throughout the world, the most

L

-3-

 

 

.class~conscious and revolutionary workers-~along with their allies among

iother sections of the population~-need to come together in an organization
that can intervene in every struggle, expose every injustice, reach out
and win to its banner ever-wider sections of the population—-preparing for

the day when we can rise up and overthrow capitalism.

The RSL is a multi~national organization of women and men, gay and straight,
fighting to bL:1d such a revolutionary party. —Along wit; our sister or-
ganization, the Revolutionary Marxist League of Jamaica, west Indies, we

are active in a wide range of day-to-day struggles:

union struggles, com-

munity struggles, the fight against the Nazis and the Klan, struggles for
lesbian, gay and women's rights and liberation, the movement against unsafe
nuclear power, national liberation struggles, the fight of prisoners for

their rights and freedom, and many other struggles.

In all these battles _

for basic needs and rights, we fight to win the greatest gains possible.

At the same time, we always tell the truth:

Freedom and liberation, a

better world, will only come when worldwide capitalism is destroyed and re-

placed with real workers‘ rule: socialism.
