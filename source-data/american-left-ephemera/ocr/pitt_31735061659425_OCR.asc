This is our ‘pledge to our country. We are carrying it out
in every possible way, by participation in all war efforts; in
our press; in our trade union and political activities. Our
members a?in the armed forces and on the ships at sea,
giving their ives as American Communists did in the Lincoln
Battalion in Spain, to ﬁght fascism. We invite the miners to
join our party. We are proud of our party. A strong
Communi-st Party, withits literature, mass meetings and press,
will ‘help to dispel confusion, will help guarantee clarity among
the miners on the war and how it must be won. It is interest-
ing to note that practically all of the suggestions the trade
unions advance today have been proposed in the articles of
The Worker and Daily Worker months ago——prodiuc~tion com-
mittees, transportation study, adequate supply of cars, better
supply of materials and organization of production and the
urgency of cutting down the alarming rate of absenteeism.
We urge you t-o become regular readers of The Worker to
be really informed on all these subjects, to learn of the activi-
ties o-f the labor movement from coast to coast and to contribute

"more elfectively to the winning of the war.

COAL MINERS and the WAR
By ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN

OAL miners are fearless, liberty—loving men, who face

death daily, wrestingzycoal from t-he depths of the dark,
stubborn earth. Coal miners belong rightfully at the "head of
labor’s ﬁght against fascism in all countries. They were, when
Hitler came to power in Germany, and were marked for swift
reprisal. Here is the tragic story of the leader of the German
coal m:iners:

“Mr. Huesmann, who at one time was the guest of the United
Mine Workers of America in this country, was probably the
most outstanding lal)or leader in Europe. He was a man of
about 65 years of age. When the Hitler Government took over
the miners’ union and all other unions in Germany, Mr. Hues-
rnann was interned in a cam-p provided for that purpose. After
several weeks of internment his dead body was shipped to his
home in Bochen, Germany, with a notation from the ofﬁcials -of
the government to the eﬂ‘ect that while trying to escape from
this internment camp Heusmann was killed by soldiers on
guard. You can imagine a man 65 years of age trying to escape

“ from one of those internment camps in Germany. The record

so far as we could gather from the German delegates indicated
that Huesmmm was shot in the back several times and thus
killed.” /

German Miners Thomas Kennedy, Secretary of the
Asked for He] U .M.W.A., so reported to the

P 1938 convention, as a delegate to the
International Mining Congress in 1936, at Prague, Czechoslo—
vakia. German miners risked their lives slipping over the border
to appeal to their brother miners. They reported that their
union, the strongest in Europe, had been smashed by Hitler.
They warned that the coal output was pouring into the muni-

3

 

tions plants and that Hitler was heading for a well planned

. war on all other countries. They expressed the hope that with

the cooperation of miners elsewhere and of labor in general,
eventually the German people would emerge from this night-
mare and restore democracy to the people of that country. They
pleaded for outside help, Mr. Kennedy said.

The German miners returned to face imprisonment and ﬁring

_s uads. Six ears have assed. Their warnin has come to ass.
P

Germany attacked and overran one European country after
the other, until the Soviet Union, ‘bearing the brunt of battle
today, shattered the myth of Hitler’s “invincibility.” Japan
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. Our_country is at
war with the monster Hitler and his brutal fascist allies. Many
miners and their sons are in our armed forces, on sea, on land,
in the air. They are in this war to win. They depend on war
industries to supply tanks, guns, bombers, battleships, ammu-
nition, to “keep ’em ﬂying, keep ’em sailing, keep ’em ﬁring.”
They count up-on the American coal miners, their buddies on
the battle line of production, to dig and move coal—-the life-
blood of our war industry. No mining patch is today isolated
from this just war, this people’s war. It is a global war of lib-

eration to decide the future of all peoples. Our armed forces ’

are traveling across the seven seas to strike the ﬁnal blows at
the ﬁendish enemy‘ -of all mankind. We are answering the cries
for help from the German miners and of the one hundred
million tortured peoples in Poland, Holland, France, Jugoslavia,
Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Rumania.

The calculated cruelty of the monstrous Nazis is indescrib-
able. Last month in V\/arsaw, Poland, 400 starving children
(Jewish) were rounded up by the Nazis, taken to the dog
pound and there destroyed by poison gas. Labor leaders, pro-
fessionals, priests, ministers, Communist leaders have been
beaten to death in Nazi prisons. Hundreds were slaughtered
and the town of Lidice razed to the ground in revenge for the
death -of Hitler’s hangman, Heydrich. Pierre Semard, one ‘of
the secretaries of the French Railwaymen’s Federation and a
member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party,
was recently executed by a German ﬁring squad.

Hideous stories elude the censor and trickle through from the
silenced subject peoples, who await our avenging might. When
an armed Allied force lands on European soil these people
will spring to action in all their strength and burning hatred
against their oppressors. Open up a Western Front is the im-
perative order of the day.

From the strong free throats of our brave American coal
diggers, always in the vanguard of struggle, comes the cry:
“Smash Hitler now! Death to fascism and all its foul crimes!

Victory for the United Nations in defense of our dernocraticiii
way of life, for the liberation of our siiﬂering brothers and \

sisters in other lands! Peace and security for all peoples!”
The free peoples of the world are welded in the ﬁres of com-
mon struggle and a common purpose into an alliance of 28

.“United Nations.” The enemy is the Berlin-Rome—Tokyo Axis

of Germany, Italy and Japan. T-he Axis is supported by Franco
in Spain (who never could have defeated the ‘braved-’Loyalists if
an embargo had. st-opped supplies to him from France, England
and America), and by the Mannerheim government -of Finland,
which is sinking American ships today off Murmansk with
American—made planes, and whose minister Procope still sits in
Washington gathering information for his Axis masters, as do
the Vichy tools of Hitler. We cannot remedy our past mistakes,
like selling millions -of tons of scrap iron to Japan, and giving
planes to Finland, but we can arrest all Axis agents in our
midst and stop their defeatist propaganda. '

The Nazi-Fascist advocacy of racial
supremacy should be rejected by all
-Americans. Japan sends. her sly,
deceptive agents among the Negro people, agitating them
against a “white man’s war.” The Nazis in Europe advocate
“Aryan supremacy,”_ and insult the Negro people as sub—~human,

usual, in the home, at work, or in the ranks of labor. All of us
must sacriﬁce, work, ﬁght. Labor is a basic factor in winning
the war. The miners are traditionally leaders among labor.
The 600,000 coal diggers, organized in their ﬁfty-two-year—old
union, the United Mine VVorkers of America, fought gallantly'
to win organization. Steel, rubber, transport, auto—were
helped to organize by the miners, who view with pride the
strength of these husky young brother unions.

its recent convention by its vigorous war stand (I) on opening
up a Western Front; (2) on the need of Anglo-American-

‘On the Paciﬁc Coast the C.I.O. longshoremen are loading
scientiﬁcally. The “Harry Bridges" Plan” has increased output
10 per cent and more. The Paciﬁc Coast Maritime Board is a
joint union-em-ployer—government body for the entire coast

the loading of a ship. “Get on the job, victory depends on you.
Men and ships will win the war. Keep them moving. If we
win the war, we win our case,” Bridges tersely told his union
membership.

Every patriotic labor leader in America is aware of labor’s
great stakes in this liberation war. Labor is ﬁghting for the
whole nation——for civil rights, religious liberties, the protection
of American womanhood, for culture, for art, for science, for
democracy, for civilization. Some will ﬁght bravely, and sac-
riﬁce their lives. Some will remain at work. The major re-
sponsibility of those at home is to increase tremendously war

is indispensable for victory.

United Mine Workers of America. F-or _six months following
Pearl Harbor, apart fr-om letters from local unions telling of
their self started'war activities, the Miners’ Journal made no
call to support the United Natio-ns or for a Western Front.
President Roosevelt and his administrationiwere attacked, our
country’s war program ridiculed, and nasty cracksimade at
civilian defense and rati-oning. There was no plan suggested
for increasing production, until the pressure on Lewis became
so great that a current circular from the U.M.W.A. ofﬁce at
last proposes that the pit committees be turned into -cooperative
production committees; each district is to form a Victory Pro-
duction Committee and a national committee to c=oordinat\;
them is to be set up. This is big news for the miners. It is
a victory for the win—the-war forces who are the majority of
the miners.

quarters, Washington, D. C., on July 1st reports there are

 

 

1,000 labor—1nanagernent production cornrnittees in all the major _i

industries of this country. It is criminal that mines s-hould be

shut down and miners unemployed when coal is so greatly“

needed in our nation’s industries, that whole districts are still
in the depression. Production Committees are needed to tackle
this problem. -Care of tools, reducing -absenteeism, cutting down
accidents, ﬁre prevention, maintenance and repair, safety pro-
tection, cutting waste, -breakin-g production bottlenecks, using
every machine to the fullest extent, facilitating transportation
of workers and coal, are some of the tasks of such committees.

Other union-s have developed such plans to speed up production A

and protect the workers——the Bridges Plan, the Reuther Plan,
the Murray Plan, the Electrical W-orkers’ Plan, the hard ore
miners’ plan. But speed up is very dangerous in coal mines
unless it is organized by. the miners and agreed to by the
operators. There is every possibility for a splendid Program
for Victory by the coal miners. They -best know the prob-
lems and how to solve them.
