‘ as the doctors and others above-mentioned,
professing to be useful, but too often of no use
save as supporters of the system of folly, fraud
and tyranny of which they form a part. And
all these we must remember, have, as a rule,
«one aimin view: not the production of utilities,
but the gaining of a position either for them-
zselvesftor their children in which they will not
have to work at all. It is their ambition and
the end of their whole lives to gain, if not for
themselves yet at least for their children, the
proud distinction of being obvious burdens on
the community. For their work itself, in spite
of the sham dignity with which they surround
it, they care nothing, save a few enthusiasts,
men of science, art or letters, who, if they are
not the salt of the earth, are at least (and O,
the pity of it!) the salt of the miserable sys-
tem of which they are the slaves, which hin-
ders and thwarts them at every turn and even
sometimes corrupts them.

Here then, is another class, this time very
numerous and all-powerful, ~which produces
very little and consumes enormously, and is -
therefore supported, as paupers are, by the
real producers. The class that remains to be
considered produces all that is produced, and
supports both itself and the other classes,
though it is placed in a position of inferiority
to them; real inferiority, mind you, involving
.a degradation both in mind and body. But it
i -is a necessary consequence of this tyranny and
folly that again many of these workers are not
producers. A vast number of them once more
are merely parasites of property, some of them’
openly so, as the soldiers by land and sea
who are kept one foot for the perpetuating of
"national rivalries and enmities, and for the

urposes of the national struggle for the share
f the product of unpaid labor. But besides
this obvious burden on the producers and the

, scarcely less obvious one of domestic servants.

there is ﬁrst the army of clerks, shop assist-
ants and so forth who are engaged in the ser-
vice of the private war for wealth, which as
above said, is the real occupation of the wel1,~
to-do middle class. This is a larger body of
workers than might be supposed, for it in-
cludes amongst others all those engaged in
what I should call competitive salesmanship,
or, to use a less digniﬁed word, the puffery of
Wares, which has novvegot to such a pitch that
there are many things which cost far more to
sell than theyldo to make. Next there is the
mass of people employed in making all those
articles of folly and luxury, the demand for
which is the outcome of the‘ existenceof the
rich non-producing classes; things which peo-
ple leading a manly and uncorrupted -life would
not ask for or dream of. These things, who-
ever may gainsay me, I Will forever refuse to

call wealth, they are not wealth, but waste. .

Wealth is what nature gives us andvwhat a
reasonable man can make out of the gifts of
nature for his reasonable use. The sunlight, the
fresh air, the unspoiled face of the earth, food,

. raiment and housing, necessary’ and decent;

the storing up of knowledge of all kinds, and
the power of disseminating it; ,means of free
communication between man and man; works
of art, the beauty which man creates when he
is most a man, most aspiring and thoughtful
—-all things which serve the pleasure of peo-
ple, free, manly and uncorrupted. This is
wealth. Nor can I think of anything worth
having which does not come under one or other

of these heads. But think, I beseech you, of
the product of England, the workshop of the
world, and will you not be bewildered, as I am,
at thethought of the mass of things which no
sane man could desire, but which our useless
toil makes—and sells?

Now, further, there is even a sadder indus-
try yet forced on many, very many, of our
workers—-the making of wares which are
necessary to them and their brethren, because
they/are an inferior class. For if many men
live without producing, nay, must live lives so
empty and foolish that they forc<3 a great part
of the workers to produce wares which no one
needs, not even the rich, it follows that most
men must be poor; and, living as they do on
wages from those whom they support, cannot
get for their use the goods which men natur-
ally desire, but must put up with miserable
make-shifts for them, with coarse food that
does not nourish, with rotten raiinent that does
not shelter, with wretched houses which may

. well make a town-dweller in civilization look

back with regret to the tent of the nomad tribe,
or the cave of the pre_-historic savage. Nay,
the workers, must even lend a hand to the
great industrial invention of the age-—adulter-
ation, and by its help produce for their own
use shams and mockeries of the luxury of

the rich; for the wage earners must always

live as the wage payers bid them, and their
very habits of life are forced on them by their
masters.

But it is waste of time to try to express in
words due contempt of the productions of the
much-praised cheapness of our epoch. It must
be enough to say that this cheapness is neces-

sary to the system of exploiting on which mod-'

em manufacture rests. In other words, our
society includes a great mass of slaves, Who-
must ‘be fed, clothed, housed and amused as

slaves, and that their daily necessity compels‘

them to make the slave wares whose use is
the perpetuation of their slavery.

To sum up, then, concerning the manner of
work in civilized states, these states are com-
posed of three classes—-—a class which does
not even pretend to work, a class which pre-
tends .to work but which produces nothing, and
a class which works, but is compelled by the
other two classes to do Work which is often
unproductive.

Civilization thwefore wastes its own re-
sources, and will do so as long as the present

system lasts. These are cold words with which i
to_ describe the tyranny under which we suﬁer;

try then to consider what they mean.
There is‘ a certain amount of natural mate-
rial and of natural forces in the world, and a

‘certain amount of labor power inherent in the

persons of the men that inhabit it. Men urged

by their necessities and desires have labored l

for many thousands of years at the task of sub-
jugating the forces of nature and of making
the natural material useful to them. «To our
eyes, since we cannot see into the future, that
struggle with nature seems nearly over, and the
victory of the human race over her nearly

complete. And, looking, backwards to the‘time- ..

when history ﬁrst began, we note that the pro-
gress of that victory has been far swifter and
more startling within the last two hundred
years than ever before. Surely, therefore, we
moderns ought to be inall ways vastly better
off than any who have gone before us.. Surely
we ought, one and all of us, to be wealthy, to

 childishness troubling ourselves to discuss

others; longer lived, more beautiful, more hon-
ored, more reﬁned than those of the other
class." I do not say that it troubles itself
about its members being positively long lived,
beautiful or reﬁned, but merely insists that
they shall be so relatively to the inferior class.
As also it cannot use the labor power of the in-
ferior class fairly in producing real wealth, it"
wastes it wholesale in the production of rub-
bish. .

It is this robbery and waste on the part of
the minority which keeps the majority poor;

if it could be shown that it is necessary for the a

preservation of society that this should be sub-
mitted to, little more could be said on the mat-
ter, save that the despair of the oppressed ma-
jority would probably at some time or other
destroy society- But it has been shown, on the
contrary, even by such incomplete experiments,
for instance, as co-operation (so—cal1ed) that
the existence of a privileged class is by no
means necessary for the production. of wealth,

but rather for the -“government” of the pro-

ducers of wealth, or, in other words, for the
upholding of privilege.

The ﬁrst step to be taken then is to abolish
a class of men privileged to -shirk their duties
as men, thus forcing others to do the work
which they refuse to do. All must work accord-
ing to their ability, and so produce what they
consume—that is, each man should work as
well as he can for his own livelihood, and his
livelihood should be assured to him; that is to
say, all the advantages which society would
provide for each and all of its members.

Thus, at last, would true society be found- -V

ed. It would rest on equality of condition. No
man- would , be tormented for the beneﬁt of‘

for the beneﬁt of society. Nor, indeed, can
that order be called society which is not up-
held for the beneﬁt of every one of its mem-
bers. r l ’

But since men live now, badly as they live,
when so many people do not produce at all,

and when so much work is wasted, it is clear.

that, under conditions where all produced and
no Work was wasted, not only would everyone
Work_With the certain hope of gaining a due
share of wealth by his Work, but also he could
not miss his due share of rest. Here, then,
are two of the three kinds of hope mentioned
above as an essential part of Worthy Work as-
sured to the worker. When class robbery is

abolished, every -man will reap the fruits of
‘his labor, every man will have due rest——leis-

ure, that is. Some Socialists might say we
need not go any further than this; it is enough
that the Worker should get the full produce of
his work, and that his rest should’ be abun-
dant. But thoughthe compulsion of man’s
tyranny~is thus abolished, I yet demand com-
pensation for the compulsion of nature’s neces-
sity. As long as the work is repulsive, it will

not of long daily duration. What vve want to do is
to add to our Wealth Without diminishing our
pleasure. Nature will not be ﬁnally conquered
till our work becomes a part of the pleasure
of our lives. ,

That ﬁrst step of freeing people from the
compulsion to labor eedlessly will at least
put us on the way towards this happy end; for
we shall then have time and opportunities for
bringing it about. As things are now, between

the waste of labor power in mere idleness,
and its waste in unproductive work, it is clear
that the world of civilization is supported by a
‘small part of its people; when all were work-
ing usefully for its support, the share of work
which each would have to do ‘would be but
small, if our standard of life were about on
the footing of what well-to-do and reﬁned peo-
ple now think desirable. We shall have labor

power to spare and shall, in short, be as.

wealthy as we please. It will be easy to live.
If we were to wake up some morning now,‘
under our present system, and ﬁnd it “easy to
live,” that system would force us to set to work
at once and make it hard to live; We should
call ‘that “developing our resources,” or some
such ﬁne, name. The multiplication of labor
has become a necessity for us, and as long as
that goes ‘on no ingenuity in the invention of

machines will be of any real use to us. Each.

new machine will cause a «certain amount of
misery among the Workers whose special indus-
try it may disturb; so many of them will be
reduced from skilled to unskilled workmen,
and then gradually matters will slip into their
due grooves, and all. will work apparently
smoothly again; and if it were not that all this
is preparing revolution, things would be, for
the greater part of men, just as they were be-
fore the ‘new wonderful invention. \

But when" revolution has made it “easy to
live,” when all are working harmoniously to-
gether and there is no one to rob the worker
of his time, that is to say his life; in those
coming days there will be no compulsion on us
to go on producing‘ things we do not want, no
compulsion on us to labor for nothing, we shall

what we shall do with our, Wealth of labor
power. Npw, for my part, I think the ﬁrst
use we ﬁught to make of that wealth, of that
freedom, should be to make all our labor, even
the commonest and most necessary, pleasant to
everybody; for thinking over the matter care-
fully, I can see that the one course which will
certainly make life happy in the face of ‘all ac-

cidents and troubles is to take a pleasurabley

interest in all the deta-ils of life. And lest
perchance you think that an assertion too uni-
versally accepted to be Worth making, let me
remind you’ how entirely modern civilization
‘forbids it; with What sordid, andieven terrible,
details it surrounds the life of the poor, what
a mechanical’ and empty life she forces on the
rich; and "how rare a holiday it is for any of
us to feel ourselves a part of nature, and un-

hurriedly, thoughtfully, and happily to note

the course of our lives amidst all the little
links of events which connect them with the
lives of others, and build up the great whole of.
humanity. ' ‘

But such a holiday our whole lives might be,
if we were resolute to make all our labor rea-
sonable and pleasant. But We must be reso-
lute indeed; for no half measures will help us.
here. It _has been said already that our pres-
ent joyless labor, and our lives scared and anx-
ious as the life of a hunted beast,’ are forced
npon us by the present system of producing
for the proﬁt of the. privileged classes. It is
necessary to state what this means. Under the-
present system of wages and capital the “man-
ufacturer” (most absurdly so-called, since
a manufacturer means a person who makes
with his hands), having a monopoly of the
means whereby the power to labor inherentin

every man’s body can be used »for production, is
the master of those who are not so privileged,
he, and he alone, is able to make use of this
labor power, which, on the other hand, is the
"only commodity by means of which his “capi-
tal,” that is to say, the accumulated product
of past labor, can be made productive. He
therefore buys the labor power of those who
are bare of capital and can only live by sell-
ing it to him; his purpose in this transaction

is to increase his capital, to make it breed. It

is clear that if he paid those with whom he
makes his bargain the full value of their labor,
that is to say all that they produced, he.would
fail in his purpose. But since he is the monop-
olist of the means of productive labor, he can
compel them. to make a bargain better for him
and Worse for them than that; which bargain

is that after they~have earned their liveli-,_
hood, estimated according to a standard high

enough to ensure their peaceable submission
to his mastership, the rest (and by far the
larger part of as a matter of fact) of what
they produce shall belong to him, shall be his

property to do as he likeswith, to use or abuse.

 

at his pleasure; which property is, as we all
know, jealously guarded by army and navy,
police and prison‘, in short, by that huge mass
of physical force which superstition; habit, fear
of death -by starvation—IGNoRANoE, in one
word, among the propertyless masses enables

the propertied classes to use for the subjection ‘

of—their slaves. , l
Now, at other times, other ‘evils resulting

from this system may be put forward. What

I want to_ point out now is the impossibility

,of our attainingto attractive labor under this

 

system, and to repeat that it is’ this ‘robbery

    

 

18 USEFUL wonx vs. USELESS TOII.‘

(there is no other word for it) which wastes

the available labor power of the civilized '

world, forcing many men to do nothing, and
many, very many more to do nothing useful;
and forcing those who carry on really use-
ful labor to most burdensome overwork. For
understand once for all that the “manufact-
urer” aims primarily at producing, by means
of the labor he has stolen from others, not
goods but proﬁts, that is, the “wealth” that
is produced over and above the livelihood of

his workmen. Whether that “wealth”~ is real.

or sham matters nothing to .him. If it sells
and yields him a “proﬁt” it is all right. I have
said that, owing to there being rich people
who have more money than they can spend rea-
sonably, and who therefore buy sham wealth,
there is waste on that side; and also that, ow-
ing to there being poor people who cannot af-
ford to buy things which are worth making,
there is waste on that side. So that the “de-

mand” which the capitalist “supplies” is a-

false demand. The market in which he sells
is “rigged” by the miserable inequalities pro-
duced by the robbery of the system of Capital
and Wages. _

It is this system, therefore, which We must
be resolute in getting rid of, if we are to at-
tain to happy and useful work for all. The
ﬁrst step towards making labor attractive is
to get the means of making labor fruitful, the
capital, including the land, machinery, factor-
ies, etc., into the hands of the "community, to
be used for the good of all alike, so that we
might‘ all work at “supplying” the real “de-

. mands” of each and all—that is to say, work

for livelihood, instead of -working to supply
the demand of the proﬁt market—‘—instea.d of

 

:1“-',",j?'  ' ,~ ,

USEFUL WORK VS.‘ USELESS TOIL 19

working for proﬁt-2'. e., the power of compell-
ing other men to work againsttheir -will.

I say once more that, in my belief, the ﬁrst
thing which we shall think so necessary as to
be worth sacriﬁcing some idle time for, will
be the attractiveness of labor. No very heavy
sacriﬁce will be required for attaining this ob-
ject, but some will be required. For we may
hope that men who have just waded through a

period of strife and revolution will be the last

to put up long with a life of mere utilitarian-
ism, though Socialists are sometimes accused
by ignorant persons of aiming at such a life.
On the other hand, the ornamental part of mod-
ern life is already rotten to the core, and must
be utterly swept away before the new order of
things is realized. There is nothing of it—
there is nothing which could come of it that
could satisfy the aspirations of men set free
from the tyranny of commercialism.

We must begin to build up the ornamental
part of life—its pleasures, bodily and mental,
scientiﬁc and artistic, social and individual——
on the basis of work undertaken willingly and
cheerfully, with the consciousness of beneﬁt-
ing ourselves and our neighbors by it. Such
absolutely necessary work as we should have
to do would in the ﬁrst place take up but_a
small part of each day,.and so far would not
be burdensome; but it would be a task of daily
recurrence, and therefore would spoil ‘our day’s
pleasure unless it were made at least endur-
able while it lasted. In other Words, all labor,
even the commonest, must be made attractive.

How can this be done?——-is the question. the
answer to which will take up the rest of this
paper. In giving some hints on this question,

I know that, while all Socialists Will agree’ with "

many of the suggestions made, some of them
may seem strangeand venturesome.
must be considered as being given without any
intention of dogmatizing, and as merely ex-
pressing my own personal opinion. ‘

From all that has been said already ‘it fol-

" lows, that labor, to be attractive, must be di-

rected towards some obviously useful end, un-
less in cases where it is‘ undertaken voluntar-
ily by each individual as a pastime. «This ele-

ment of obvious usefulness is all the .more to T

be counted on in sweetening tasks otherwise

. irksome, since social morality, the responsibil-

ity of man towards the life of man, will, in the
new order o-f things, take the place of theologi-
cal morality, or the responsibilityof man to
some abstract idea. Next, the day’s work will
be short. This need not be insisted on. It
‘is clear that with work unwasted it. can be
short. It is clear also that much work which
is now a torment, would be easily endurable
if it were much shortened.

Variety of work is the next point, and a
most important one. To compel a man to do

day after day the same task, without any hope i

of escape or change, means nothingshort of,
turning his life into prison torment. Nothing
but the" tyranny of proﬁt grinding makes this
necessary. A man might easily learn and prac-

. tice at least three crafts, varying sedentary
occupation with outdoor—occupation calling for»

the exercise of strong bodily energy for work
in which the mind had more to do. There
are few men, ' for instance, who would not
Wish to spend part» of their lives in the most
necessary and pleasantest of all work——culti-
vating the earth. One thing which will make

1 this variety of employment possible will be

These A

  

 

USEFUL WORK vs. USE_LESS TOIL 21

the form that education will take in a socially-
ordered community. At present all education
isldirected towards the end of ﬁtting people
to take their places in the hierarchy of com-
merce—-these as masters, those as workmen.
The education of the masters is more ornamen-
tal than of the workmen, but it is commercial
still; and even at the ancient universities learn-
ing is but little regarded, unless it can in the
long run be made to pay. Due education is a
totally different thing from this, and concerns

itself in ﬁnding out what different people are '

ﬁt for, and helping them along the road which
they are inclined to take. In a duly—ordered so-
ciety, therefore, young people would be taught
such‘ handicrafts as they had a ;turn for as a
part of their education, the discipline of their
minds and bodies; and adults would also
haveopportunities of learning in the same
schools, for the development of individual ca-
pacities would be of all things chieﬂy aimed at
by education,-instead, as now, the subordina-
tion of all capacities to the great end ‘of
“money-making” for one’s self—-—or one’s mas-
ter. The amount of talent, and “even genius,
‘which the present system crushes, and which
would be drawn out by such a system, would
make our daily work easy and interesting.
Under this head of variety I will note one
product of industry which has suffered so much

 

from‘ commercialism that it can scarcely be said,

to exist, and is, ‘indeed, so foreign from our
epoch that I fear there are some who will ﬁnd
it diﬂicult to understand what.I have to say on
the subject, which I nevertheless must say,
since it is really a most important one. I mean

that side of art which is, or ought to be, done‘,
by the ordinary workman while he is about ‘

 

22 USEFUL WORK vs. USELESS TOIL

his ordinary work, and which has got to be

« " called, very properly, popular art." This art, I

repeat, no longer exists now, having been
killed by commercialism. But from the begin-
ning of man’s contest with nature till the rise
of the present capitalistic system, it was alive,
and generally ﬂourished. While it lasted,
-everything that was made by man was adorned
by: man. just as everything made by nature is
adorned by her. The craftsman, as he fash-
ionedthe thing he had under his hand, orna-
mented it so naturally and so entirely with-
out conscious effort, that it is often diﬂicult to
distinguish where the mere utilitarian part of
his work ended and the ornamental began. Now
the origin of this art was the necessity that the
workman felt for variety in his Work, and
though the beauty produced by this desire was
a great gift to the world, yet the obtaining
variety and pleasure inuthe work by the work-

man was a matter of more importance still,
for it stamped all labor with the impress of ,.

pleasure; All this has now quite disappeared
from the work of civilization. If you Wish to
have ornament, you must pay specially for it,
and the workman is compelled to produce or-

nament, as he is to produce other wares. He

is compelled to pretend happiness in his work,
so that the beauty produced by man’s hand,

.which was once a solace. to‘ his labor, has,,now,

become an extra burden to him, and ornament
is now but one of the follies of useless toil,
and perhaps not._the least irksome of its fetters.

Besides the short duration of 1abor,iits con-
scious usefulness, and the variety which should
go With it, there is another thing needed to
make‘ it attractive, and that is pleasant sur-

e roundings. The miseryand squalor which we

people of civilization bear with so‘ much com-
placency as a necessary part of -the manufact-
uring system, is just as necessary to the com-
munity at large as a proportionate amount of
ﬁlth would be in the house of a private rich
man. If such a man were to allow the cinders
to be raked all over his drawing room, and a
privy to be established in each corner of his
dining room, if he habitually made a dust and
refuse heap of his once beautiful garden,
never washed his sheets or changed his table
cloth, and made his family sleep ﬁve in a bed,
he would sure ﬁnd himself in the claws of a

- commission de lunatico. But such acts of miser-

ly folly are just what o11r present society is
doing daily under the compulsion of a sup-
posed necessity, which is nothing short of mad-
ness. I beg you to bring your commission of

son why they should not follow their occupa-
tions in quiet country homes, in industrial col-
leges, in small towns, or, in short, where they
ﬁnd it happiest for them tolive. .

As to that part of labor which must be as-
sociated on a large scale, this very factory sys-
tem,‘ under a reasonable order of things
(thoughto my mind there might still be draw-
backs to it), would at least offer opportuni-
ties for a full and eager social life surrounded
M by many pleasures. The factories might be cen-
tres of intellectual activity also, and work in
them might well be varied very much; the ten- ~

ding of the necessary machinery might to
each individual be but a short part of the day’s
work. The other work might vary from rais-
ing food from the surrounding country to the
study and practice of art and science. It is

veniences which at present attend the use of

by commercial greed, would be born again and
ﬂourish.

So, you see, I claim that work in a duly-
ordered community should be made attractive
by the consciousness of usefulness, by its be-
ing carried on with intelligent interest, by va-
riety, and by its being exercised amidst pleas-
ureable surroundings. But I have also claimed,
as we all do, that the day’s work should not be
wearisomely long. It may be said, “How can

__ you make this last claim square with the

others? If the work is toibe so reﬁned, will
not the goods made be very expensive?”

I do admit, as I have said before, that some
sacriﬁce will be necessary in order to make la-
bor attractive. I mean that, if we could be
contented in a free community to work in the
same hurried, dirty, disorderly, heartless way
as we do now, we might shorten our day”s
labor very much more than I suppose we shall
do, taking all kinds of labor into account. But
it we did, it would mean that our new-won
freedom of condition would leave us as anx-
ious, listless and wretched as We are now,
which I hold is simply impossible. We should

be contented to make the sacriﬁces necessary ‘-

for raising our condition to the standard called
out for as desirable by the whole community.

I Nor only so. We should, individually, be emu-

lous to sacriﬁce quite freely still more of our

time and our ease towards the raising of the‘

standard of life. Persons, either by themselves
or associated for such purposes, would freely,
and for the love of the work and for its/re-
sults—stimulated by the hope of the pleasure
of creation—produce those ornaments of life
for the service of all, which they are now
bribed to produce (or pretend to produce) for

 

26 USEFUL wonx vs. USELESS TOIL

  

the service of a few rich men. The experiment
of a" civilized community living wholly With-
out art or literature has not yet been tried.
The past degradation and corruption of civili-
zation may force this denial of pleasure upon

"the society which will arise from its ashes.

If that must be, We will accept the passing
phase of utilitarianism as a foundation for the
art which is to be. If the cripple and the
stavrveling disappear from our streets, if the

earth nourish us all alike, if the sunshine .for_

all of us’ alike, if to one and all of us the glor-
ious drama of the earth—day and night, sum-

miner and winter—can be presented as a thing

to understand and love, we can afford to wait
awhile till we are puriﬁed from the shame of
the past corruption, and till art arises again
amongst people freed from the terror of the
slave and the shame of the robber.

-Meantime, in any case, the reﬁnement,
thoughtfulness and deliberation of labor. must
indeed be paid for, but not by compulsion to
labor‘ long hours. Our epoch has invented ma-
chines which would have appeared Wild dreams
to the men of past ages, and of those machines
we. have as yetmade no use.

They are called “labor-saving” machines——-

that phrase commonly used implies what we

expect ‘of- them; but we donot get what we ex-
pect. What they really do is to» reduce the
skilled laborer tolthe ranks ofthe unskilled, to
increase the number of the “reserve army of
labor,”—that is to increase the precariousness

_ ‘of life among the workers, and to intensify the

    

labor of those who serve the machines (as
slaves their masters). All this they do by the
Way, While they pile up the proﬁts of the
employers of labor, or force them to expend

those proﬁts in bitter commercial war with
each other. In a true society these miracles
of ingenuity would be for the ﬁrst time used
for minimizing the amount of time spent in un-
attractive labor, which by their means might

‘ be so reduced as to be but a very light burden V

on each individual. All the more as these
machines would most certainly be very much
improved when it was no longer a question as_
to whether their improvement would “pay” the
individual, but rather Whether it would bene-
ﬁt the community. .

So much for the ordinary use of machinery,
which would probably, after a time, be some-
what restricted when men found out that there
was no need for anxiety as to mere subsistence,
and learned to take an interest and pleasure in
handiwork Which, done deliberately and
thoughtfully, could be made more attractive
than machine work. a “

Again, as people freed from the daily terror

"of StfiI‘\'zltiOl1 ﬁnd out what they really want-'

ed, being no longer compelled by anything but
their own needs, they would refuse to produce
the mere inanities which are now called lux-
uries, or the poison and trash now called cheap
wares. No one would make plush breeches
when there were no ﬂunkies to «wear them, nor
would anybody waste his time over making
oleomargarine when no one was compelled to
abstainlfrom real butter. Adulteration laws
are only needed in a society of thieves——and in
such a society they are a dead letter.

bility of constructing a scheme of a new so-

ciety out of the materials of the old, before we

know which of those materials would disap-
pear and which endure through the evolution
which is leading us to the great change. Yet
it is not difficult to conceive of some arrange-
ment Whereby those who did the roughest,work
should work for the shortest hours. And
again, what is said above of the variety of
work applies specially here. Once more I say,
that for a man .,_,\1:o be the whole of his life hope-
lessly engaged in performing one repulsive and
never-ending task is an arrangement fit enough
for the hell imagined by theologians, but
scarcely ﬁt for any other form of society.
Lastly, if this rougher Work were of any spe-
‘cial kind we may suppose that special volun-
teers would be called on to perform it, who
would surely be forthcoming, unless men in a
state of freedom should lose the sparks of man-
liness and which they posessed asvslaves;

And yet if there be any Work which‘ cannot
be made other than repulsive, either by the
shortness of its duration or the intermittency
of its recurrence, or by the sense of special TC.

the mind of the man who performs it freely;
if there be any work which cannot bevbut a
torment to the worker, what then? Well, then,

leave it undone, for -it were better if they
should. The produce of such worlrcannot be

Now, We have seen that the semi—theologica1

panies it. We have_weighed the work of civili-

zation in the balance and found it wanting,

since hope is mostly lacking to it, and there-
fore we see that civilization has bred a dire
curse for men. But we have seen also that the
work of the world might be carried on in hope

and with pleasure if it were not wasted by

folly and tyranny, by the perpetual strife of
opposing classes.

It is Peace, therefore, that we need in order
that we may live and work in hope and with
pleasure. Peace so much desired,lif we may
trust men’s words, but which has been so con-
tinually and steadily rejected by them in deeds.
But for us, let us set our hearts on it at what-
ever cost.

What the cost may be, who can tell? Will it
be possible to win peace peaceably? Alas, how
can it be? We are so hemmed in by wrong and
folly, that in one way or other we must" always
be ﬁghting against them; "our own lives may
see no end to the struggle, perhaps no ob-
vious hope of the end. It may be that the best
we can hope to see is the struggle getting

sharperand bitterer day -by day, until itbreaks

out openly at last into the slaughter of men by
actual warfare instead of by the slower and
crueler methods of “peaceful” commerce. If
we live to see that, we shall live to see much;
for it will mean the. rich classes grown con‘-
scious of their _own wrong and robbery, and
consciously defending them by open violence,
and then the end will be near. V
But in any case, and whatever the nature of
our strife for peace may be, if we only aim at
it steadily. and with singleness of heart, and
ever keep it in view, a reﬂection from that

USEFUL WORK VERSUS USELESS TOIL.

The above title may strike some of my
readers as strange. It is assumed by most
people now-a-days that all work is useful, and
by most well-to-do people that all work is de-
sirable. Most people, well-to-do or not, believe
that, even when a man* is doing work which
appears to be useless, he is earning his live-
lihood by it——he is “employed,” as the phrase
goes; and most of those who are well-to-do
cheer on the happy worker with congratulations
and praises, if he is only “industrious” enough
and deprives himself of all pleasure and holi-
days in the sacred cause of labor. In short,
it has become an article of the creed of mod-
ern morality that all labor is good in, itself——-
a convenient belief to those who live on the
labor of others. But as to those ‘on whom they
live, I recommend them not to take it on trust,
but to look into the matter a little deeper.

Let us grant, ﬁrst, that the race of man
must either labor or perish. Nature gives us
absolutely nothing gratis; we must win it by
toil of some sort or degree. Let us see, then,
if she does not give us some compensation for
this .compulsion to labor, since certainly in
other matters she takes care to make the acts
necessary to the continuance of life in the in-
dividual and the race not only endurable, but
even pleasurable. '

Yet, ﬁrst, we must say in the teeth of the
hypocritical praise ~ of all labor, whatsoever

*W—lien the Word “man" or “men” is used in the
following pages it is intended to include both sexes,
unless otherwise stated. _

it may be, of which I have made mention, that
there is some labor which is so far from being

r a blessing that it is a curse; that it would be

better for the community and for the Worker

if the latter were to fold his hands and refuse 

to work, and either die or let us pack him off to

the workhouse or prison——Which you will..
Here, you see, are two kinds of Work-one

good, the other bad; one not far removed from

/a blessing, a lightening of life, the other a

mere curse, a burden to life. _
What is the difference between them, then?
This: the one has hope in it, the other has not;

It is manly to do the one kind of work, and

manly also to refuse to do the other.

What is the nature of the hope Which, when
it is present in Work, makes it worth doing?

It is threefold, I think—hope of rest, hope
of product, hope of pleasure in the Work itself;
and hope of these also in some abundance and
of good quality; rest enough and good enough

to be worth having; product Worth having by ‘ A

one who is neither a fool nor an ascetic; pleas-
ure enough for all for us to be conscious of it
While we are at work; not a mere habit, the
loss of which we shall feel as ya ﬁdgety man

-feels the loss of the bit of string he ﬁdgets

With. 1, y K .

I have put the hope of rest ﬁrst because
it is the simplest and most naaural part of our
hope. Whatever pleasure there: is in some
Work, there is -certainly some pain in all Work,
the beast-like pain of stirring up our’ slum-
bering energies to action, the beast-like dread
of change when things are pretty well with

us; and the compensation for this animal pain’

is animal rest. We must feel while we are

working that the time will come when we shall“

not have to work. Also the rest, when it
comes, must be long enough to allow us to en-
joy it; it must be longer than is merely neces-

sary for us to recover the strength we have.

expended in working, and it must be animal
rest also in this, that it must not be disturbed
by anxiety, else we shall not be able to enjoy
it. If we have this amount and kind of rest
we”shall, so far, be no worse off than the
beasts.

As to the hope of product, I have saidthat
nature compels us to work for that. It re-

mains for us to look to it that we do really.

produce something, and not nothing, or at least
nothing that we want or are allowed to use.
If we look to this and use our wills we shall,
so far, be better than machiiies.

The hope of pleasure in the work itself:
how strange that hope must seem to some of

my readers——to most of them! Yet I thin that . -

to all living things there is a pleasure i the
exercise of their energies, and that even beasts
rejoice at being lithe and swift and strong.
But a man at work making something which
he feels will exist because he is working at it
and wills it, is exercising the energies of his
mind and soul as well as of his body. Memory
and imagination. help him as he works. Not
only his own thoughts, but the thoughts of the
men of past ages guide his hands; and, as a
part of the human race, he creates. If we
work thus we shall be-men, and our days will
be happy and eventful.

Thus worthy work carries with it the hope
of pleasure in rest, the hope of the pleasure in
our using what it makes, and the hope of
pleasure in our daily creative skill.

All other work but this is worthless; it is

slaves’ Work:-mere toiling to live, that we
’ may live to toil. ' '
Therefore, since we have, as it were, a pair_
M of scales ‘in which to weigh the work now

done in the world, let us use them. Let us
estimate the worthiness of the work we do,
after so many thousand years of toil, so many
promises of hope deferred, such boundless ex-
ultation over the progress of civilization and
the gain of liberty.

Now, the ﬁrst thingas to the work done
in civilization and the easiest to notice is that
it is proportioned out very unequally amongst
the different. classes of society.
are people—not a few—who do no work, and
make no pretence to doing any. Next, there
are people, and very many of them, who Work
fairly hard, though with abundant easements
and holidays, claimed and allowed; and lastly,-

- the are people who work so hard that they

ma be said to do nothing else than work,
and are accordingly‘ called the “working class-
es,” as distinguished from the middle classes
and the rich, or aristocracy, whom I have men-
tioned above.

It is clear that this inequality presses heavily
upon the “working” class, and must visibly
tend to destroy their hope of rest at least, and

so,’ in that particular, make them worse off *

than mere beasts of the ﬁeld; but that is not
the sum and end of our folly of turning use-
ful work into useles toil, but only the begin-
ning of it. 7

For ﬁrst, as to the class of rich people doing ‘

no work, we all know that they consume a

great deal while they produce nothing. There-

fore, clearly, they have to be kept at the ex-
pense of those who do work, just as paupers

have, and are a mere burden on the commu-
nity. In these days there are many who have
learned to see this, though they can see no
further into the evils of our present system,
and have formed no idea of any scheme for

' getting rid of this burden; thoughperhaps they

have a vague hope that changes in the sys-
tem of voting for members- of the House’ of
Commons may, as if by magic, tend in that
direction. With such hopes or superstitions we
trouble ourselves. Moreover, this
class, once "thought most necessary to the state,
is scant of numbers, and has no-w no power

of its own, but depends on the support of the

class next below it—-the middle class. In fact,

it is really composed either of the most suc-.‘ ‘’

cessful men of that class, or of their imme-
diate descendants. -

As to ‘the middle class, including the trad-
ing, manufacturing and professional people of
our society, they do, as a rule, seem to work
quite hard enough, and so at ﬁrst sight might
be thought to help the community, and not
burden it. But’ by far the greater part of them,
though they work, do not produce, and even
when they do_produce, as in the case of those
engaged (wastefully indeed) in the distribu-
tion of goods, or doctors, or (genuine) artists
and literary men, they consume out of all pro-

portion to their due share. The commercial and l

manufacturing part of them, the most powerful
part, spend their lives and energies in -ﬁghting
amongst themselves for their respective shares
of the wealth which they force the genuine
workers to provide for them; the others are
almost Wholly hangers-on of these: they are
the parasites of property, sometimes, as in the
case of lawyers, undisguisedly so; sometimes,
