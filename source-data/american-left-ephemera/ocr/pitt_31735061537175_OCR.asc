In order to avoid these dangers, certain measures were
taken, the most important of which was a decree of the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee (May 22, 1922)
according to which every factory must reserve a deﬁnite mini-
mum number of places for young workers. At that time,
this minimum number was about 7% of all the workers
employed. Later this was made somewhat smaller. From

. 1924-, however, until the present day, it haspremained more

or less the same, corresponding to the general rise of the
economic system. Our youth has obtained a ﬁrm foothold in
industry, but on an entirely different basis than before.

III

THE REORGANIZATION OF LABOR AND THE
TRAINING OF YOUTH

Basing itself on the principles of Socialist education and
labor, the Soviet Government looks upon the position of the
young workers in industry from an entirely diﬂerent basis
than that of the capitalist countries. Whereas the capitalist
employer hires young workers in order to squeeze out the
greatest possible amount of proﬁt, our policy has a very
different foundation. The following two tasks formulated

at the Seventh Congress of the Communist Youth League of

the Soviet Union, are decisive:

“For industry developing upon a new technical basis we must pro-
vide trained workers corresponding to its demands.”

“The work-schools, the centers of the trade and general education
and training of the half-grown youth, have the task of producing
not foremen, minor technial oﬂicials (straw bosses) but only above
all class-conscious, intelligent, technically trained «workers. . . . The
work-schools must supply the chief trades of the respective industries
with such trained workers as require in general a rather long time to
train.”

[10]

Thus, the training of the young workers has an entirely
new aspect. Besides his trade training, the young worker
receives in the work-school a general education, and gradu-
ates from the school a good, intelligent worker. In former
times the young Workers were not so much trained as ‘broken
in by force: work was piled on them, that had nothing to do
with their usual training, and their so-called “education” pre-
pared them for nothing in particular.

How are things now? * From the material obtained by
medical examination of the youth in the summer of 1923
we learn that in the main trades were employed 76.9% of
all apprentices and in the secondary trades 10.8%. As assist-
ants in oﬂices, in stores, etc., 12.3% of all apprentices were
employed.

These ﬁgures are clear enough; no comment is necessary.

Another question can, however, be raised: “Do these fac-
tory schools prove successful? Are the young Workers actu-
ally educated and trained there?” Let us see how the man-
agement of various factories answer these questions.

From Tver:

“The managers and the technicians express themselves in the sense
that the graduates of the factory schools make a thoroughly excellent
record in the factories.”

A similar report from Kariupol:

“The graduates of the factory schools satisfy quite well, as far as
their qualiﬁcations are concerned; the demands of the factory and
the workers themselves look upon them in a very favorable light.”

A few more ﬁgures about the development and signiﬁcance
of the factory schools. In the beginning of 1922 there were
only 4-3 of these schools with 2,000 students; in January,
1923, there were already 74-8 schools with 50,000 students.

[11]

Towards the end of 1924 the schools included 55% of the
youth employed in industry. At the present time the schools
are expanding rapidly and are becoming perfected; the train-
ing standards of the graduates is continually rising as Well as
their general cultural level. As a consequence it has become
possible to draw in larger and larger sections of the youth
into this splendid educational system.

WORKING HOURS AND THE PROTECTION OF T

LABOR FOR THE YOUTH .

The 8-hour day is the unshakable basis of our labor stand-
ards. On this basis special provisions are made to provide
the youth with possibilities for physical and mental develop-
ment. The chief points in the protection of youth are: young
workers under 16 years work for four hours; young Workers
from 16 to 18 Work 6 hours.

The following table gives us a general idea of the distri-
bution of time of a student of a factory school:

Factory work . . . on the average . . . . . . . . 2.9 hours daily
Theoretical study (classes, study, etc.) . . . . 3.8 “ “
Recreation and entertainment . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.3 “ “

Care of the body, etc . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 2.1 “ “

Eating . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0 “ “

Miscellaneous . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.3 “ “

Sleeping . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.6 “ “

Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.00 hours

It is obvious from this distribution of time that the life
of the young worker is thoroughly normal and is very favor-
able for his physical and mental development.

[12]

 

V

WAGES

The development of the wages of the young workers is

associated very closely with the development of the wages of
the adult Workers. After wages had reached their lowest
point in the years of the civil wars and general economic
decline, there began at ﬁrst sudden rises and then a more
regular but therefore surer development upward. Wages
have not reached and surpassed the pre-war level; but the
present position of the Working youth cannot be compared
in any Way to the position of the young Workers before the
war on that basis. Paragraph 61 of the code of Labor
Protection says: “The shortened work day of young Workers
isconsidered as a full day in so far as Wages are concerned.”

What the young Workers used to receive for 9 and 10
hours of grinding labor, yes, and more than they used to
receive, is now received for a 4-hour work day! And it is
to be remembered that labor today is organized on an entirely
different basis from What it used to be. It is also very impor-
tant to note that all young Workers get a yearly vacation for
one month on full pay, that they get continual medical care,
that they have the advantage of extensive social legislation.
On the basis of this We can say Without the least exaggeration
that the condition of the Working youth has improved tre-
mendously not only in the cultural but also in a purely eco-
nomic sense.

We do not overlook the greater and lesser shortcomings
and deﬁciencies. Yet the last decade has shown us that the
Soviet Power is gradually overcoming these deﬁciencies and
is succeeding in raising the standard of the entire Working
class and especially of the working youth.

In order not to overlook the sorest spot in the conditions

of the youth we must examine the problem of unemploy-

[13]

ment. Owing to the great inﬂux of young people from the
farms, an inﬂux that cannot by far be absorbed in our indus-
try, considerable numbers of young workers are registered at
our Labor Bureau. “The ranks of the unemployed youth
are recruited mainly from such elements as enter the labor
market for the first time,” declared the resolution of the
Seventh Congress of the Communist Youth League.

The government has already initiated a number of meas-
ures in order to lessen and remove unemployment among the
youth. It has placed a premium on native industry, the
development of which———the development of State industry—
is the foundation on which unemployment as a Whole and
particularly unemployment of the youth will be overcome.

VI
YOUNG WORKERS AND THE TRADE UNIONS

As We have shown above, the economic conditions of the
Working youth are in all respects superior to those existing in
capitalist countries: nevertheless, the young Workers, just as
the adult workers, are organized in the trade unions Which,
of course, have entirely different functions in the Workers’
Republic. The trade unions, besides seeing to the Welfare
of the working class, devote special attention to the education
of the Workers, especially the youth, in the class spirit prepar-
ing them for the great tasks which face the toilers in Soviet
Russia.

The young workers in the Soviet Union are admitted in
trade unions as soon as they are permitted to Work, for the
principle in the Workers’ Republic is that if a person is old
enough to work he is old enough to participate in the work
of his economic organizations—the trade unions. However,
the trade unions realize that the young workers have their

[14]

 

 

 

 

 

special problems and therefore have special youth representa-
tives on all the committees, starting with representatives of
the young workers in the shop committee up to youth repre-
sentatives in Central Committees of the Trade Unions. These
representatives are elected by the young workers in shops,
mills, mines and every existing enterprise where the young
Workrs are engaged. These representatives take up all the
matters pertaining to the conditions of the young Workers
and on all the work which is conducted by them they must
report to the young Workers. The trade unions create special
youth sections in every workers’ club, where the youth can
gather, spend an enjoyable evening, study, etc. These youth
sections in Workers’ clubs are managed exclusively by the
young workers through special management committees which
they elect. The trade unions cater also to the apprentices and
have special youth inspectors Whose duties are to investigate
the factory schools and see that the apprentices should enjoy
all the privileges oﬂered to them by the Soviet Labor Code.

In spite of the fact that the Workers’ State is still poor,
yet everything possible is being undertaken to assist the Work-
ers and especially the youth during the time of unemployment.
Since the bulk of the unemployed today in Soviet Russia are
either peasants who migrate and settle in the cities or the
peasants who come during the winter months, when they are
released from their toil on ﬁelds, the problem of unemploy-
ment is of a special nature in the Soviet Union. Therefore,
all measures are undertaken to give these young peasants who
come from the villages an opportunity of learning a trade
with which they could enter industry. This is being done
through special Workshop schools attached to the Labor Ex-
changes. Young handicraft Workers are being organized into
groups and given Work, with pay at trade union rates, by
the government. The young unemployed are being utilized
by the local governmental bodies for public Works, for in-
stance, road repair, clearing lots and other unskilled labor.

the unemployed.

VII
SUMMARY AND FUTURE
In this pamphlet we have attempted to sketch brieﬂy the condi-
tions of our working youth, the tremendous gains that the

great Soviet Revolution has Won far us. We believe that
every reader Will,.see clearly how great these achievements

are, especially when he considers under. what difficulties the

Soviet Power began and is continuing its gigantic Work. If
it was possible for us to accomplish so much for the exploited
and oppressed youth at the time when the first Workers’
Republic of the World was surrounded on all sides by enemies,
when the young Workers and the young Communists struggled
and fell on the many fronts of the civil War, then we can
look confidently into the future. Our heroic ﬁghters for
Socialism, examining the past decade,  declare with proper
pride that they have not struggled. in -vain. Our youth also

can declare that not for nothing  they hunger and suffer,

in the hard years of war and intervention. Those among
us whose fathers and older brothers fell in the struggle for
our future are now ready to ﬁght with the same enthusiasm

. for our Socialist fatherland, for our Socialist achievements.

In the war that is threatening us now, the Working youth will
follow the examgnle of the revolutionists of 1917 and will
know how to meet the imperialists and the counter-revolu-
tionists of r:?\‘~:‘rv kind and from Wherever they may come.

THE YOUTH—FIRST IN RUSSIA, LAST IN
AMERICA

The contrast between Russia—the Union of Socialist Soviet
Republics—and the United States is indeed great. The
United States is the most prosperous country in the world.
It has in its possession more than half the world’s gold. It
produces more than half of the most important of the world’s
goods. But—the United States is ruled by the bosses. All
the riches produced beneﬁts not the producers but the owners.
The greater the productive power, the richer does the master
class become, and the more severe becomes the exploitation
of the workers. .

Russia is very poor. Its resources are not developed. It is
still rebuilding what was destroyed inthe War, the blockade

and the counter-revolutionary attacks. It has only begun to

develop its industries. But——Russia is ruled by the Workers.
In Russia, whatever is produced is used for the beneﬁt of the
producers. All improvements, all discoveries, all inventions,
mean better life for the workers.

When this is allowed to sink in, we can really understand
the tremendous contrast between the conditions of the young
workers in America and the young Workers in the Soviet
Union. In Russia, in spite of every diﬂiculty, the youth

comes ﬁrs rica, in spite of all the p 

‘youth comes last. In Russia, it IS taken for granted that
 

young growing persons must receive the best that society can
oﬂier. In America, it is taken for granted that the youth
are to receive the lowest Wages, labor the longest hours and
under the Worst conditions———because they are not organized
and cannot yet ﬁght for better conditions. '
The /fmerican Trade Union Delegation found that in

[3]

 

the Soviet Union no person was permitted to work who was
under fourteen years of age.

In the United States, there are approximately two million
children under that age gainfully employed on farms, in
factories and oﬁices, as errand boys and girls, in street trades,
and in a thousand and one other occupations. They receive
the lowest possible pay, and sometimes work as long as four-
teen hours a day. So determined to the bosses seem to be
to keep on exploiting these children, that when it was proposed
to give Congress—-the “people’s voice”-—the power to regu-
late the employment of children under sixteen, there was a
mass uprising of the bosses. The Constitutional Amendment
on Child Labor was adopted by only six states out of the
forty—eight in the United States. The State of Montana
pays its children the honor of recognizing that they are at
least on an equal footing with animals. It has a “Commis-
sion for the protection of children and dumb animals,” which
is entrusted with the task of looking after the needs of both
equally. Many states do not even grant the children that
privilege. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

Animal functions everywhere but nobody cares about the
children.

The table printed in another part of this pamphlet shows
that the young workers in Russia do on an average of about
three hours’ work in a factory.

In the United States there is a fable about the eight-hour
day. But it is not every young worker who can boast of its
beneﬁts. In the Southern states, for instance, where the
young workers form the bulk of those employed in industry,
about ﬁve per cent. of the workers work 4-8 hours a week
or less, which forty per cent. work sixty hours or more a
week. In the radio factories of New York and Chicago
young workers are employed ﬁfty—four hours a Week. In
the biscuit factories, the department stores and other places

[4]

 

 

 

Where large numbers of young Workers are employed, the
eight-hour day is a rare exception.

In Russia, because the young worker is still more tender
and less hardened, he received special protection, does not
Work at night or in dangerous occupations.

In America, because the young Workers have not yet the
power to compel it, they receive the least protection. They
work at night. They Work in all occupations, beginning
With steel mills and the coal mines and ending With the most
poisonous chemical occupations. Every year several thousands
are the victims of their occupations, and they are not even
eligible to compensation under the law that excludes all those
illegally employed from compensation.

In American the youth are only considered as objects of
exploitation. In Workers_’ Russia they are considered as the
builders of the new society.

“When the American young workers follow the example
of the Russian young Workers, they too will learn to partici-
pate in government as the Russian workers are learning to
do,” said Frank Palmer, member of the American Trade
Union delegation to the Soviet Union, and editor of the
Colorado Labor Advocate. Russia’s youth, organized in the
largest youth organization in the World, the Communist
Youth League of the Soviet Union, with two and a half
million members, is setting the example for the rest of the
World. The American young Workers, altho on the Whole
still largely under the inﬂuence of the capitalists, have already
take the first steps along the road made by the Russian young
workers. It is not a mere incident that in the last miners’
strike, in the Passaic strike, the young Workers were the
leaders. It is not an accident that at the head of the picketing
Colorado miners who broke thru a cordon of thugs and
Company police, Was a nineteen-year-old girl. Nor is it an
accident that in New York the plumbers’ helpers went out
on strike to support the strike of their older brothers, and

[5]

 

that they organized themselves into a union, even tho they
were refused admission into the American Federation of
Labor. The above are all indications of the one important
fact——that a large section of American young Workers are
beginning to take the lead in the ﬁght against the bosses.

At the head of all these movements, in the front line
trenches, has stood the YOUNG WORKERS (COMMU-5
NIST) LEAGUE OF AMERICA. Compared to the two
and one half millions in the Russian League, it is indeed
small. But it is active. It is militant. Is is growing. And
it is young. The Young Workers League has established
itself as the only working class youth organization in Amer-
i'ca.. It is the only youth organization that gives the young
workers any possibility of doing something for themselves.
The Young Workers League invites all open-eyed young
workers, all those who have been inspired by the achievements
of the Russian youth, to join its ranks, and with the united
power of the youth to do in America what the Russian youth
is striving for in the Soviet Union.

WHAT HAS THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION DONE A

FOR THE WORKING YOUTH?

I

From an object of exploitaion, the labor of the young worker

‘becomes the basis for Socialist education; it becomes subordinated
to the purposes of education. In the capitalist factory, the youth
was simply an appendage to the machine. Thru reorganizing the
industrial work of youth under eighteen, the Soviet power brings
up the young worker into a completely developed proletarian.—-
Program of the COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE or THE SOVIET
UNION.

The Soviet Revolution of 1917, in which the proletarian

/ youth of Russia fought shoulder to shoulder With the adult

Workers to set up the rule of the Workers, marked the begin-
ning of a new era in the life of the Russian toiling“ youth.
The reorganization or labor, the new conditions of education
and of life provided the working youth with tremendous
possibilities for physical and mental advance. The November
Revolution paved the Way for a thoro transformation of
the miserable slave-like existence of the young Worker and at
the, same time created all the necessary conditions for his
emancipation, for his development into a free class-conscious
Worker and human being. T

Let the capitalists and their followers in the ranks of labor
try to prove that all We have are no more than pious Wishes,
that all our “Wonderful laws are only on paper,” that the
conditions of life and labor of the youth in Russia “arouse
rage and indignation.” We do not listen to them; We believe
facts only. The sober language of facts and ﬁgures will

[7]

show us how false are all the slanders of our enemies. We
never maintained that the young workers of our country have
already won the best‘ possible conditions; we do maintain,
and ‘We are ready to prove that the conditions of the young
Workers in the Soviet Union are improving from day to day,
that we are marching forward with giant steps, that all our
efforts are based on the correct foundations, that the rule of
the workers makes possible for us ever greater progress and
ever healthier growth.

II
YOUNG WORKERS IN INDUSTRY

In order to make clear to the reader the signiﬁcance of
the part the young workers play in industry, we present here
a little table showing the development of the young workers

in industry in comparison with the total number of workers
employed.

Year  1914- 1918 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924- 1925 1926-7

Number Y. W. .. .. .. .. .. 87,875 85,028 90,864 133,992
Perc’t’ge Y. W. 13.9’ 13.1 10.0 7.0 5.5 5.5 5.8 5.1 5.6

In spite of the fact that these ﬁgures are not complete, we
can learn a whole lot from them. The thing that strikes us
ﬁrst is the large decrease in the number of young Workers in
proportion to the total number of workers employed. Some
people may see in this a remarkable and perhaps even harmful
development. But when We think this matter over a little
more deeply, we see that not only is the development not

harmful but, on the contrary, it is even beneﬁcial. In em-

ploying large numbers of poorly paid young workers, the
capitalist boss was interested only in the hunt for proﬁts.
The proﬁts that could be squeezed out of the young worker

[8]

 

 

 

 

were in fact very high. One of the recognized experts on
labor statistics, Strumilin, deﬁnes this as follows:

“The wages of a young worker amounted to only 35% of that
of an adult. His production, however, was about 60% of an adult
worker’s. As a result he was exploited practically twice as much as
the adult.” 0

Wherever possible, we tried to replace the young workers
by adults, and to free them from labor that was beyond their
strength. When, besides this, we also remember that about
a third of all workers began work at the very early age of
twelve years, and that two thirds entered the factory when
they were not yet ﬁfteen years old, then it becomes perfectly
clear how important it was to decrease the number of young
Workers in the factory, how_harmful for the Working youth

'was their excessive participation in production. The Soviet

 

Power brought an end to the condition in which, literally,
children were dragged into the factories and exploited merci-
lessly. The labor of children under 14- years has been
prohibited by law. The fruits of the abolition of child labor
were quick in maturing. In 1923, there was no more than
.08% (eight out of 10,000) employed under 14- years of
age; the rest were in educational institutions, and whenever
and wherever possible, in health and pleasure resorts, chil-
dren’s camps, etc.

So now we see to whose advantage the decrease in the
number of employed young workers was; it was for the
beneﬁt of the children and of the half-grown youth, who
often had to do the work that taxed the strength of even
adult workers. ‘

But the withdrawl of the working youth from industry
was accompanied by serious dangers:

First, the estrangement of the coming generation from the
working class, and secondly, the intereference with the normal
training of skilled workers.
