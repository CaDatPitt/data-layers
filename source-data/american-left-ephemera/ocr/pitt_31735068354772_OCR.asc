The 1952 elect_ion‘~campaign is now "in progress. As our Union} 48th Conventiondeclared recently: “We in Mine-
Mill cannot sit on the sidelines.”

On the major political issues of l952, our Union has taken the position that nothingless thanthe end of the 

“cold war” and of the hot, Korean war will satisfy our members and the American people; that nothing less than a
genuine. 100 per cent FEPC, nathin/g._less than a better standard‘ of living for our members, nothing less than.repeal
of the.T,aft-Hartley Act, nothing less than a complete end to McCarthyism, McCarranism and Smithism, will satisfy us.

llanville Local soar
— in month-old strike

’ DANVILLE, -Il1.—-Strike imorale is
high among the more than 200 work-
ers who walked out of the Allith-

~ Prouty Tool & Hardware‘ plant here

August 26, ‘and have been out since.
‘ With a “Win the Contract” commit-

> tee meeting three times a week to di-

rect strategy, pickets are walking the
line in six‘ four-hour shifts daily. The
‘company has failed completely in its
persistent attempts to organize 9.
,“back to work” movement. /

At issue in he strike are demands
for improved vacation benefits, higher
pay». for work done on’ holidays, re-
classifications, a_.health and welfare
program, and settlement of the. com-‘
pany.’s refusal to pay employees their

as required by
contract. - ‘ “ . ”
V Since the strike began,’ two meetings

have been held with the company, at.
which a representative of the‘ U. S.‘

Conciliation Service was present. But
theicompany failed to budgeﬂfrom its

a stubborn stand.

Strike committees arelalllfunctioning
actively, and help is coming in from

 other Mine-Mill locals in" this area.‘

The negotiating committee for the

éstrikers ..includes Local 808 president
_Vincent Giacone, George Willett and

Juvinal Delanous, with Dave Juvinal
and Al Picklesymier as ._"alternates', as-

:  , sisted by Int’l rep. Jesse Van Camp.

“Whatever candidate, nationally‘ or locally, _
a get our support," our 48th Convention said.

i During -recent weeks, our local unions. throughout the United States hanvetbeen studying the records of thevariousl
candidates for political office. In many c’ases,"they’ have sent delegations of ‘Mine-Mill members to interview the can-
didatesand find out how they stand on the‘ important issues ofthis campaign. i

states,‘-and recommendations for" endorsement by our

\

offers a programalong these and similar lines will deserveiand will A

 We are therefore calling a Mine-Mill Political Action Conference, to be held at“Salt lake City Monday and.l'ues-
day, October 6 and 7, in the Franciscan Room, Newhouse ‘Hotel, 4th Street South &'Main. . .

Delegates —to" the Conference should come prepared ‘to make reports on‘. theppoliticalv. situation in their various _
Union of Congressional anctother candidates in those states”

_ , Out: of this Conference should‘ come on action program whichlvwill mobilize our entire
to do their part in the weeks, remaining before ‘Election ‘Day, as. well as on Election Day.

. Q. - , . ,  _ .

The Conference isgivenspecial timeliness by the fact that its second "day will coincidewith ‘the opening of the '
Salt lake City hearings at which Senator Pat McCarran of Nevada, intends to |aunch_an attack on our Union. We are -
i , demanding that the McCarran. “Concentration Camp” Committee hearingsin Salt lake City be open to the public, and ‘

that rank-and-filemembers of our Union be given an opportunity to testify. - ‘ ' - .

We know that the delegates to this Political Action Conference will wantto attend these McCarran Committee hear- if
_ings, ,so._that' they can report back'to their home -locals on what is involved in McCarran's attack on our Union. ‘

It is of great importance thatithe Conference be attended b
from our’ local unions throughout the United States.

ROCKWOOD-"LYLE, Tenn.——An out-
standing victory ‘has been won by Lo-
cals 314 and 579 in joint negotiations

,.with the Tennessee Products- & Chem-

 

ical Corporation. And one big reason
is that each local had more than $3,000
in its strike fund to back up the de-
mands. ’ . y '

The negotiations, which lasted 12

days, ended when the coinpany granted -

a general wage increase of 7 cents an
hour for the members of Local 314 in
Lyle and of Local 579 in Rockwood.
The new contract also provides for
rate adjustments on several jobs-~ worth
about 2 centsaa hour. At the Rock-

wood plant, the ' adjustments range 
_, from 3 to 30 cents an hour, ‘whileplat.

the Lyle-Wrigley plan-t they are from’
, 1 to 10 cents. ‘T 4 p ._ t 
' It also calls for three, vmorepaid - "

formed on the holiday. And it calls for
two days leave with pay for any em-
ployee who sustains a death in his im-
mediate family. The total “package”

is worth approximately 12 cents an 

hour. - ‘

The gains won in the newlclfontract.

are in addition. to a 3; cent hourly wage

increase negotiated last spring, which ‘

  NEW YORK—Delegates to the
48th Convention here put their
stamp of hearty approval on an

 J.  ,,e1aborate Mine-Mill program for
 g .>. “,,A7VVorld at .Peace.”~ '

"They called for presentation of
«the program to government agen-
_ cies in the U. S. and Canada, and
,..*for application of pressure “to
 guarantee full and, serious con-
" sideration of this program by the
. U. S. Congress and the Canadidn

  A. _ Parliament.” '

.. They proposed that “the atten-

‘ tion of the world be called to this
.,program as an alternative to war
. .-and depression by presenting it,
through an appropriate delega-
.tion, to the United Nations Gen-
+eral_ Assembly and the U. -N. Eco-

~ .  nomic and Social Council.”

W THEY. ASKED that,Mine—Mill dele-
gations bring the program to candi-
‘dates for political officeon every‘ level

- M"-twin both countries, in an attempt to ob-

ﬂtainv-~the broadest possible support for
'_ , ‘It politically. - ..

They ordered that the program be;
‘popularized among the membership of
our own union through ‘a special "edu-
cational campaign, including classes,
3discussion groups, leaflets, radio pro-

_  -grams and newspaper articles. ‘

./

They called for the program to be
._'reprinted for distribution not only
throughout the labor movement in the
, U. S. and Canada, .but also to commu-
-gdnity organizations such as church,
0 business and professional groups.

The 61-page

document, complete

"_ with facts and figures. taken from.

.government, United Nations, labor and
‘corporation sources, offers a many-

-sided program of peaceful production

as “practical alternatives to War and
» -depression.” -

The convention approved a resolu-
tion summing up the entire document,
a which declared:

“Our program‘ says: let the nations

-of the world trade freely with each
other and work together to develop‘
[resources and industry in the under-
-developed countries‘ where the people

_ Jlowfsuffer from poverty, disease and
.0 explc‘)itation.” -

, POINTING OUT that the program’ ‘i
,boils down to three main parts, the ‘_'

i 0‘ Convention listed: .

H 1) 'stabilize the non-ferrous metals.
, ‘industry;

 2) -build the home market;

f C31) extend world markets.

‘Under the first part, .Mine-‘Mill pro- ’s

poses ‘that “the iron gripjof U, S.
 jnonopolieis on the world’s non-ferrous
’ 0 ‘metal resources be broken; that non-

_'l'he great Earl” Robinson, composer and
."fo_Hc‘singer, was one of the hits of the
xoonvention. This was Robinson’: second

ferrous metal production be allocated
among the nations of the world thru

an International Materials Conference,

and that an International Development
Authority be established to promote

development of industry and resources

in underdeveloped countries.”

Stabilization; of the industry, the
delegates agreed, cannot be" achieved
without a conservation program for
scarce metals, "a drastic improvement
in the working conditions‘ of all miners

bya maximum work—week of 35. hours,
the organization "of all unorganized

' metal miners throughout the world,

and better safety legislation both in
the U. S. and other metal producing
countries. - ’ -

Under ‘the second part, the Union
_“proposes high wages, "lower taxes, (1.
work weelcroﬁ 35 hours now, and later
of 30, hours with no loss in pay, an
end to discrimination, and higher‘ in.-

comes for the nations’. farmers.” '

As AN IMPORTANT and -necessary‘
_method-"of building the home market,

the program proposes a “vast public
housing and public works-rprogram,»'so

- that every family willjhave a-‘decent
“' home to live in, every child willhave a.

decent school to go ,t’o,\every sick per-
son will -be taken care of in fully-
equipped and staffed hospitals, every

farmer will have electricity and a‘tele- ‘

phone; so that our highways” will be

made wide enough and‘ safe for all.

our cars; and so that our great river
valleys, instead-of‘ being eroded one
year and flooded the, next, with thou-

sands of farms and homes destroyed.‘

every year,’ will be controlled and de-
veloped for the benefit of the people.”

The third featureof the program de-
mands that trade between nations
“be -freed from, coldvwar restrictions
which mean the loss to,our members

of thousands‘ of jobs, and that greater .

markets for non-ferrous-metal products
and all the world’s goodscbe created
by buildingup the economies of under-

developed countries through an Inter-,,

national Development Authority which
will promote the development of b‘oth
resources and industries in these coun-
tries without economic or political
interference.” 0

Great interest in the program ‘was
shown by the reporters for various la-
borand big -business publications who

.Were “covering” the ‘convention.

NEW»YORK——Delega,tes to the

48th Mine-Mill convention here

gave a warm welcome to Albert
J. Fitzgerald, president, of the
United Electrical, Radio & Ma-
chine Workers. ‘ --
.:Fitzgerald. announced that his

union wants to cooperate with.
Mine-Mill more closely than ever

before. -

,’ ,“Your officers .rnet .Wltl1 three’ I

going to have much closer cooper-
ation» between our unions than
We’ve had in the past,” e said. V’
“While we’re not
along the lines of organic ‘unit-y,
we are determined to. work , to-
gether to put up’ a united fight
against those forces within and
outside the labor; movement that
are trying to destroy us,” he
added. . - '
The UE president spoke of the
recent salary raise of Philip Mur-
ray, president of the CIO Steel-

workers, from $25,000 to $40,000 ,

a year. “Put yourself in the class
of $40,000 a year, and you get out
of touch with the day to day
problems of ordinary workers,”
Fitzgerald d‘_ecl2,_red. “In our

. union we’re going to continue to.

make it impossible for any offi-
cer to ’ make a contribution pf

V ‘New approach’

a is .old ’ sellout‘,

Mine-Mill’s convention in, New Yorli

was covered with great thoroughness
. by “American , Metal Market,’5 the

employer’s daily mouthpiece in the
non-ferrous metals industry.

Several days after the convention jib
“closed, American Metal Market ‘pub-

lished an editorial praising “the new
approach in steel labor relations which
were outlinedthe other day in Chicago
by Benjamin Fairless, head of - U.S.

Steel corporation.” _ , ,

“He (Fairless) spoke about the co-“ 
operative plant tours that he and_
.Philip __Murray have agreed to‘ take to’

help stop a lotof friction at the source
and to talk things over with the United

Steelwoiclcer locals,” the boss paper
said. And then it wentgon to add:= ~

“It would be far fetched even _to

-imagine any leading executive in the . 

non—ferrous metals group taking a co.’-"”

operative tour of their properties with

Mine-Mill’s John Clark.” ' M -
Here, for once,.the American Meta

r ‘Market is completely right! 1

One of the big differences between

iMine-Mill and its president John Clark
and CIO Steel and its president Philip

Murray‘ is explained in a news story
in the New York Daily Times of ’Mon‘-'-_
day, September 15. The story reported

‘on the annual report of AFL president _

William Green to the ‘American. Feder-
ation of Labor convention. It said:
“The AFL (Executive) Council said
that Philip Murra/y’s » United Steel-
workers had allowed wages and warlo-
ing conditions in steel to fall -so far‘
behind those in other it ustriescthat

it was ‘retarding the progr\ess of
' ‘almost all other trade un_ions’.” . ' '

NEW YORK——Delegates at the "Mine-Mill Convention here served notice to Senator Pat McCarran_7 ‘.1
and his “Concentration Camp” Committee that our members are going to defeat the McCarran plot Z 
against this Union and the rest of the American labor movement. I  " 

By_ recommendation of the Convention’s committee on civil rights andminorities, the discussionlof the-3, 
McCarran attack on Mine-Mill was made a special order of business to which several hours were devoted.”

U Tying in the fight against McCarran with their Union's 1952 program of independent political action, ]; 
the delegates called for a National Mine-Mill Political Action Conference to be held in Salt_Lake City"

THEY ALSO launched a “Commit--.. — T
tee‘ of 1,000,” embracing members from i

‘across the U. S. and Canada to lead”

and direct the campaign against Mc- ‘ I
Carran, including the circulation, of‘“ae
petition demanding that the McCarran’ »
hearings be called off. ‘ - —

Deleg." from every cdrner of tho? —

for achanee to get to the microphone" 
and express ‘their fighting support for
the four Mine-Mill leaders’ who .have- -
been subpoenaed to the hearingsat Salt I I
Lake City, October’ 7 and 8. , _ ‘

The discussion was climaxed_byc Int’! 1 ,,
inﬁaf
powerful speech (see. next page) de-I

claring that “we are. proud of the fact

that Mine-Mill was born in f L jail cell,‘.;,
but we’re telling McCarran that we
are not going to rot and die in a Mc-_
Carran concentration camp.”

“LET'S, MAKE OURSELVES ‘clear 

‘here and now,” Larson said. “We are..."

not attacking the government of tho.“

» ‘United States, but we are going to at-

tack the people who ‘are subverting that ‘
government ‘to their own ends.”“ ”
Reviewing the_record ofthe McCar«? A
ran committee, Larson showed‘-howxit 
has violated “every ancient tenet, of)’ 

_American democracy,” and he laddedxf? I 3

‘‘Is there anyone in this confention‘ _
hall who any longer doubts that it is“ \ it '

.McCarran and his methods who are on U ' 

trial and not the Mine, Mill and Smel-e. ‘

EARLIER, the delegates heard’)
President‘ John Clark charge’ Senator
McCarran with spearheading a earn-1‘.
paign to reinstate thel“labor, blacklist" 7
in American industry and set upba’ I
“labor front” patterned after those?
that ‘existed in Nazi “Germany. and‘-j_g,'
‘Fascist Italy. "  « ‘ x ' 

“We do not have to loolcfar toffincl» _
out what McCarran and his ‘Concen- -
tration. Camp’_Committee are trying to;
do here,” Clark said. “The recommen- »
dations which have been comingout ,_
of this committee,-the same proposa,'ls*:.,,‘
which are in McCarran’s ‘behead_th¢_’ 
unions’ bill in Congress, would do -two 7
things-— in . ‘ _ ~ ._,._

“First, they would deny you," thC‘~_1"»'

Second, they propose to give th_e.,—em-,

‘ployers in our industry something they:

that he was forced to "go to Salt Lake?  _

’ The. answer

Well, Mr. McCarran gave the answer

to that last week in Reno, Nevada, to a
committee of the Mine, Mill and. Smelter
Worlsers'Union.' They’ asked Mr. McCar-
ran the sixty-four dollar question: Why
(is the Mine, Mill-and /Smelter Workers
being selected as the one major "union in
America to ‘appear before your com-
~ mittee? ‘ -

tokeep this strength is by being
even closer to the union, participat-
ing more broadly in its affairs. . .

I’ hopeevery local will do its best
to defeat McCarran."

that we are not going to rot and die in a y

McCarran concentration camp. .

What are some of the other difficulties
that are facing us? This hearing is

‘ going to be cloaked under the respect-

ability of a committee of the United
States Senate. And when we attack the
Committee, we're going to be told we’ree
attacking the government of the United
States. ’

Let’s make ourselves clear. here and
now. We are not attacking the govern-
ment of the United States, '_but—_we are
going to attack the people who are sub-
verting that government to their own

ends. 
“What it means

And they are going to say you are
going to have a fair and impartial hear-

I ing before thisiSenate,committee. Well,

letcus examine that a moment. Let us
examine McCarra-nism and What it means

_ in America.

;. You can look around this hall and you
will find in our membership the Catholic
and the Protestant and the Jew and the

Gentile; the black and the white--every»;
thing that makes America and'Canada.A
-‘And in our democracy there. are cer- '

tain things that have been held sacred
since time immemorial; among them, a
respect for the birthplace of any citizen,

regardless of where he may have been ‘
, born by accident; a respect for the right

of the religious beliefs of the people-‘of

the ‘United States and Canada; a respect,
for the right of the Catholic to visit his -
priest; a respect for the right of the‘Jew—r

to go to the synagogue; a respect for
the right of the Protestant to ‘go to his
church. ’

But are these rights respected by the '

McCarran Committee? Are‘ these an-
cient tenets of American democracy

what McCarran believes in? ‘Let us see.‘

I_HAV-E HERE before me the pro-

I . ceedings of the hearings of the McCar-

ran Committee entitled “Communist
Tactics in Controlling Youth Organiza-
tions." I took the time torreadwhat this
committee does towhat you and I con-
sider sacred, rights of. the American’
people. ‘ ’ -
Question of nationality, where your

C parents were born. What difference does

it make" where they were born? But to
McCarran it makes some difference
Listen to this: A ~
“What are your parents’ names?”
“His name was Louis.‘ My moth_er’s
name is Rebecca.”
“And where was your father born?”

(What does that have to do with sub-

versive activities?) '

V “I believe he was born in Russia, What A
was then Russia.” (But thesame ques-

tion could have been ‘asked the son whose
parents were born in Poland or Sweden
or England or France, of What—have-you.
That's Americanism ?) ‘

Eiccerpts from some of the resolutions adopted by Mine-Mill

48th Convention:
Labor unity

“We of the progressive independ-
ent unions have a special responsi-
bility to initiate steps for labor unity
whenever and wherever we can.

“Out of labor unity which springs
from the rank and file "can come the
final repeal of the Taft-Hartley act,‘
and the Garson amendments, a New
Deal in Washington and Ottawa, a
genuine program of peace, jobs and
rising living standards for all work-
ers in the United States and
Canada.”r" ' A

William Lanko

“.. . . theionly possible reason
Brother Lanko isenow facing depor-
tation is because of his activity in
bringing union organization to the
Torrington branch of the American
Brass Company, andbecause of his
unswerving loyalty to Mine-Mill . . .

-“. . . demand the immediate with-
drawal of all deportation proceed-
ings against William Lanko and fur-
thermore that William Lanko, an

V exemplary American, be granted his

citizenship.”

Freedom of th: border

“. ._ . renewed and vigorous de-

gmands upon the governments of our

two countries that union representa-

ferences by fair compromise. . . 
“. . C. on the basis of ,a peaceful
world the scores of billions of dollars
being ‘spent by our countries and
others for weapons of destruction be

turned instead to ' bringing about
'-abundance and security for the

American and Canadian people and
other peoples of the world . .5. I
“. . . as the first step in this pro-'
gram -we call :for_a halt to .the blood-
shed in Korea by a speedy truce.”

‘ , Six-hour day

sary to introduce legislation provid-

 ‘Whereas, the deepfelt desires of

our Canadian members and other

’ -‘workers of Canada have been ex-

pressed in the following passages

 from resolutions presented to this

] convention by sever-al.Canadian local
unions of Mine—Mi1l:

-,“The exploitation of ‘ Canada’s
-natural resources by United States
monopoly", interests has, with the
connivance of our own Canadian
industrialists, r'eached the stage. to-
Cday that the development of Cana-
f. ‘dian manufacturing is being ‘de-
_-"  liberately sacrificed in the interests
 offbuilding United States industry.
:l_—Today the Canadians are being
. “slated as the hewerslof wood and
drawers of water for the American
 industrial machine. ‘

‘The secondary industries, ’,such
as‘lours,,, are the first to feelethe
 economic pressure of such policies,
resulting in the lowering of our
living’ standards. / '

' ~“With tire’ control of Canadian
7 feconomy by the United States big
 business‘ comes- the attempted poli-
 ‘tical control by these same people

 ton who seek to destroy the parlia-
 mentary traditions of our people,
 substituting anti—democratic pro-
cedures, now common to the United
States.

see‘ at very close range the robbing
Wof/~' our natural resources’ by oil
.,;.: ‘barons of Wall Street.
 “With loss of control of our
"natural resources, we are also ‘de-
, pendent‘ on the same monopolists
' ,._as -to'the price we receive_ for our

 (‘In the Province of Alberta,’ we 1

products, and as to where we will
market not only our oil but all our
other resources of farm, woods,
mines and factories.

“We see with this economic con-
trol_ comes also political control and
interference in our governmental
policies. .

“We feel that the Canadian and
British forms of democracy and
parliament, which we have fought
for over generations, are superior

to the modern Americanism these

Wall Street gentry would foist on
us. i ‘

“We object to all that is rotten in
the so—called ‘American Way of
Life,’ such as deep freeze and mink
bribes, jurylfiacing, political courts,
witch-hunting, race hatred, crime
comics, sex movies, political circuses
called "conventions, and Hearst
journalism, and we want none of it.

“Because of U.S'. domination of
our economy we are faced. with.Wall
Street demands for-legislation in
Canada for laws similar to the
Smith Act, McCarran Act,_etc. and
the substitution of parliamentary

governinent for executive rule thru

‘Orders in Council,’ such orders of
course to be issued through Wash-

“Our industry as well as many‘
others in Canada are faced with

products manufactured at low

pense of Canadian workers and

Canadian or American workers.”

Therefore be it resolved that this
convention of the I. U. M. M. &
S. W. take a firm stand for -

1. The right of Canadian people
to independence from potlical and
economic control by the United
States big business and their stooges
in‘ Washington.

2. The development of Canada’s
resources to be made complimentary.
to the building of’ Canadian indus-
try, in order that -the Canadian peo.
ple mayreceive full use of their
great natural wealth.

3. The strengthening of Canada’s
parliamentary traditions and the de-
feat of those who would undermine

of McCarranism and other fascist
legislation. .
Be ‘t further resolved that this

“Former Attorney General McGrath,
who should certainly be one of the
chief: witnesses in any comprehensive

way in which McCarran pressured him.
McGrath told associates that McCarran
repeatedly demandedsto know why no

tials of the case are as follows:"'

“IN 1938',.R. Stanley Dollar turn<__=.d
over to the\Maritime Commission 92%
of the stock in his trans-Pacific line.
Dollar‘ at that timezowed the; commis-
sion $7,500,000. Thanks to the speedup
resulting from the threatening ' war

with Japan and to large subsidies from r

the ‘commission, the. line was able to

(Kat

~ ‘msmm.sep+T22.:952 

‘fDollar in 1945 sued to get the stock
back, contending that it was merely
pledged temporarily with the commis-
sion. The government insisted it was
turned over-outright to stave off bank-
ruptcy. This was argued back and
forth from the lower courts on up to
the Supreme Court, with three judges
of the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals
finding twice for Dollar.

“The then Solicitor General, Philip
Perlman, refused to accept that verdict.

“FINALLY, President Truman or-.

dered the settlement approved. By this

time James McGranery.\had been con-.
firmed by the Senate as Attorney Gen- 

eral. In a lengthy memorandum he
contended. that ' frome the legal view-
point, _quite apart. from the merits of
the case, there was no alternative to
settlement. Perlman». resigned‘ and,
“while he made no statement, the report
persists. that he ‘quit over the Dollar
controversy. ' A

“The’St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which I

has done much to expose the scandals
in Vtheo Bureau of Internal Revenue, in
an lediforial on Perlman’s.resignation,
demanded to know why McCarran had
been so active in the Dollar matter.

“-“ ‘Did McCarran talk to McGranery
about..the‘case_ before the latter was
confirmed? «Did McCarran put pres-
"sure on his friend, former Attorney
General McGrath, to settle it—bef_ore
McGrath was summarily booted out by
the ‘ President?’ the ‘ Post-Dispatch
asked.

“PERHAPS it’s‘ too much to ask,_
any-investigator, given the cozy rules
of the Senate club, to answer those
-questions; They are important never-
theless. They suggest a» larger ques-
,tion: How closely is the mess in the
administration linked to the controls
exercised by certain powerful Demo-
crats in Congress?”

  ‘Thuth telling does not (tonne naturallyjhg

 

These are the kinds of renegades,
secessionists, raiders and phonics
which Senator McCarran can be ex-=

. pected to bring before his “Concen-

‘  tration Camp” Committee when it

holds hearings in Salt Lake City.

They have devoted their entire‘ ener-
‘gies for several years-now to attempts
to weaken Mine—Mill. .No doubt they
will welcome any ‘invitation’ from
M cC'arran.

They are the kind of renegade
about whom Harvard Professor Zech-
ariah Chafee said: “Truth telling does
‘not come naturally.” ‘ '

“There is great temptation to exag-
'ge-rate or falsify the behavior of his
former associates,” Chaffee added.
