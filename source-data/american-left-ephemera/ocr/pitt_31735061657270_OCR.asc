Hate Groups

and
The Un-American

Activities Committee

By David Wesley

. . . “I think it will be well for every American to read this
document.

I believe it will come as a surprise to many who have
not done deep thinking on the dangers that may come if We
weaken the Bill of Rights and permit hate groups to grow.
It would be sad to have our country face anything like the
Nazi period . . .”

MRS. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT
in her syndicated newspaper column,
April 12, 1961

  

 

A Committee report issued January 2, 1947 said: “Real democracy . . .
has never worked as a national form of government.”

It was this Adamson, Chief Investigator Robert E. Stripling, and
Chairman J. Parnell Thomas who conducted the next big Committee show,
the assault on Hollywood that cast a political pall over the U. S. enter-
tainment industry which has not been entirely lifted to this day. Thomas
went to jail as a comon thief at the same time his victims, the Hollywood
Ten, went to jail for contempt of Congress. Stripling, a white-supremacy
Southerner, was a typical underworld man in the tradition of Sullivan and
Matthews, whose assistant he had been. A busy anti-Semitic propagandist
named Donald Shea once boasted that he had avoided the sedition trials
because his “friend” Stripling had given him a permanent Committee
subpoena making it impossible for anyone else to serve him. Stripling
used the_ same technique to save two Nazi agents, Dr. and Mrs. Karl
Kleczkowski, from being deported.

What was not known at the time of the 1947 movie industry hearings
was that the Committee’s Hollywood ﬁle had been originally stocked by
the Nazi publicist Sullivan when Stripling was his assistant on the Com-
mittee staff in 1939. Sullivan had planned a Hollywood extravaganza of
his own at that time, but the moment was not propitious. The intelligence
had come, of course, from his fellow merchants of hate. “The myth that
the American ﬁlm industry was controlled by Communists and Jews was
assiduously cultivated by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry,” we are told
by Albert E. Kahn, a wartime investigator of Nazi activities here. W elt-
Dienst carried lists of “Jew-Communists” laboring in the Hollywood
vineyard, and Kuhn, Coughlin, and Pelley in their respective publications
repeatedly echoed demands for an “investigation” of the movie industry.

But it was Gerald L. K. Smith who was chieﬂy responsible for bring-
ing it off. He bombarded Rankin and his friends on the Committee staff

 

with “petitions” after the war. It was Smith’s scoop on the plan to carry _

out the investigation in his Cross and Flag that Rep. Hook was referring
to when he called Smith a “conﬁdant of the Committee’s plans.” And in
February, 1948, several months after Hollywood’s ordeal was over and
the blacklist had settled like a blight on the industry, Smith wrote in
The Cross and the Flag, “We do take credit, we Christian Nationalists,
for the recent investigation into Hollywood. Martin Dies.had promised

. .. the Wood-Rankin Committee never quite got around to it . . .” but
his “petitions” had ﬁnally “turned the trick.”

It is interesting to note that the entire government loyalty program
that followed this and other Committee activities was also anticipated by
Dies and his underworld colleagues. In a treatise on the Committee pub-
lished in 1943 by the Catholic University Press, August Raymond Ogden
had written: “Dies seemed to be attempting to inaugurate a system
whereby a federal employee could be dismissed without the least oppor-
tunity to defend himself. . . . The least connection with front organiza-
tions, even years ago, was considered to have worked permanent corrup-
tion for such federal employees.” This, too, had been a popular theme
with the professional hatists. .

After Hollywood came Education, and here again the Committee’s
operations can be traced to its hate-group connections. In mid-1949 the
Committee launched a hunt for “subversives” in the school system and
for “subversive” textbooks. It began by asking more than one hundred
schools and colleges to submit the textbooks they were using for examina-
tion by the Committee staff, which had been steadily expanding over the
years. Out of this probe stemmed the attacks on the educational system,
including those of McCarthy and many state governments, that have
brought teacher oaths, textbook censorship, and the ferreting out of fac-
ulty radicals and liberals—onslaughts whose effects on classical academic
freedom are still very much with us. i

Less than a year earlier an organization called the National Council
for American Education had come quietly into being and begun working
with the Committee, while setting a groundswell of propaganda into mo-

tion through the mass-circulation hatist and partriot press. The Council

preached teacher oaths, textbook censorship, and the tracking down of
“subversive” administrators and teachers, and it inveighed against federal
aid to education. It claimed eventually to have put out a million pieces
of literature.

The Council’s_board of governors included the fascist priest, Edward
Lodge Curran, and a well-known pro-German, Dr. .Walter A. Maier. On
the advisory committee sat a member of the House Un-American Activ-
ities Committee, then Rep. Karl Mundt. But the Council was run by its
executive Vice-president, the rabid anti-Semite Allen A. Zoll. A former
Christian Front storm-trooper, Zoll had once been indicted for extortion
when he offered for $7,500 to remove a storm-troop picket-line from New
York radio station WMCA after it had cancelled the radio talks of Father
Coughlin. The station had paid him $200 in marked hills.

Founder of American Patriots, Inc., which even the Justice Depart-
ment labeled fascist, Zoll was chieﬂy responsible for promoting the Council
program. And it was this program that the Un-American Activities Com-
mittee slipped over on American education.

Turning from Education to Religion, it will be recalled that about a
year and a half ago the U. S. Air Force was caught with a slip in one
of its orientation manuals showing. The service had gone to the trouble,
for some unaccountable reason, to inform our aviators that the U. S.
clergy was shot through with “Communism.” When this got into the
papers, there was a natural wave of shock, and a good deal of curiosity as
to where the Air Force had picked up this bit of dirt. Anyone should have
known, and every student of hate literature knew at once. It camelout of
the gutter of the hate groups. This insight, incidentally, is something
that often goes unrecognized. When J . B. Matthews, for example, lists
among “top Red collaborators” such distinguished churchmen as Prince-
ton’s John Mackay, Yale’s Halford Luccok, and Chicago’s James. Luther
Adams, as well as the redoubtable Bishop Oxnam, it should be at once
apparent that the reader is in direct contact with the lunatic fringe. On
the contrary, the reaction more often seems to be that where there’s so
much smoke, there must be some ﬁre.

11

 

This Matthews contribution was offered back in 1952, and those

 

familiar with the hate groups knew that the Air Force intelligence was:
old stuff. It was in fact, a major new hate-group line developed after the‘

war, and it brings us to what has become one of the most widespread
peddlers of hate of all, the American Council of Christian Churches,
headed by Carl Mclntire. First we must note that Committee Chairman
Walter eagerly and rightly took credit for the Air Force material; it
came out of the Committee’s_ staff and ﬁles. And secondly, Rev. Mclntire
eagerly—and equally properly—took credit for it; he had supplied those
ﬁles. (Hatists are never shy about boasting of any of their merchandise
that makes a big splurge in the market-place.)

The Committee, it so happens, had been hip-deep for a dozen years
in what Ralph Lord Roy in his book “Apostles of Discord” terms the
Protestant underworld.

Mclntire started out as a fundamentalist vendor of hate against the
Federal, later National, Council of Churches and the World Council of
Churches. Seeking allies he drifted deeper and deeper into the underworld
of Rev. Winrod, Rev. Smith, Merwin K. Hart and the rest. His executive
assistant, Harvey Springer, was a hate merchant for many different
groups, including Gerald Winrod’s venomous ministry of hate where he
also held high office, and he made a particular specialty of “the. Jewish
question.” (When Springer was indicted in 1946, the Wood-Rankin Com-
mittee joined all the other hate groups in springing to his defense.)
Mclntire and Springer combine red-baiting the Protestant leadership
with a virulent mixture of anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism, while the
Council’s most numerous and strongest affiliates are in the South where
they hook up here and there with Klan and other apartheid elements.

Mclntire first got together with the Un-American Activities Com-
mittee in 1948, generously donating to its ﬁles a list of 100 clergymen to
be “investigated” for “Communism,” and the two hate groups have been
collaborating ever since. Chairman Velde and Rep. Vail, at various times,
launched so-called “investigations” of the clergy, not daring to carry
them on for long publicly but building up copious material for the pub-
lications of the underworld—and of the Air Force. All during these recent
years, too, Richard Arens, the Committee’s long-time staﬁ‘ director, has
been active on the lecture circuit of the Protestant underworld, talking
before such segments of it as the Circuit Riders (which also claimed a
share of the credit for the Air Force manual material) and The Christian
Anti-Communist Crusade. ‘

And so we come to Richard Arens, who is the reason I was led to
look into all of this. It was my paper, The Gazette and Daily of York, Pa.,

‘and the Madison, Wis., Capital-Times that ﬁnally lowered the boom on

 

Richard Arens, Merchant of Hate. This is how it happened.

About two years ago, Professor Anthony Bouscaren was forced to
resign from Marquette University in Milwaukee in a dispute with the
college over his use of funds from a grant by one Wycliffe Draper for
the writing of a book. This interested our and the Capital-Times’ Washing-

12

 

 

ton correspondent, Ronald W. May. A Wisconsin man and co-author of
an unofficial biography of the late Senator Joe McCarthy, May knew
Bouscaren as a veteran patriot, and one of dozens of denizens of the
underworld who have been hired on and off by the Un-American Activ-
ities Committee as “consultants.” (This, too, is very signiﬁcant to our
theme. The hate underworld is a peripatetic place. Its lower- and even
upper-echelon experts tend to wander in and out of employment with
group after group or pass from publication to publication, and one of
the chief watering-places on this circuit for a quarter-century has been
the House Un-American Activities Committee.)

May was especially intrigued to ﬁnd Bouscaren profusely thanking
Committee Staff Director Arens for assistance in the introduction to his
Draper-ﬁnanced book that ‘Marquette authorities had disapproved. May
found out that D-raper’s grants were set up speciﬁcally in the ﬁelds of
genetics, immigration, and anti-Communism. May wrote to a series of
top geneticists at leading universities inquiring about these grants. One
of the replies described Wycliffe Draper, a wealthy former New England
textile machinery manufacturer, as “a radical eugenicist who believed
inferior people should be sterilized”‘and “the country would be better off
without Negroes.” Others replied in similar vein, making it clear that
Draper was seeking scientiﬁc proof to uphold a belief that U. S. Negroes
should be “repatriated” to Africa. We later found out from another
Draper-ﬁnanced book that Jews were also among the inferior people
that required special attention.

By hard digging, May eventually discovered that Arens was serving
as a paid consultant to a committee that recommended recipients for
Draper grants. He also discovered something even more startling—that
Chairman Walter and Sen. James Eastland, chairman of the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee, sat on two such Draper committees.

‘Walter and Eastland ﬂatly denied any Draper connections to May, but

three weeks later the Washington Post conﬁrmed that these denials were
lies. In recognition of Walter’s services, Draper was the largest contributor
to Walter’s last campaign: $5,000. The Post reported that Arens was
paid $3,000 annually for his services as consultant.

Along with Walter and Eastland on the two committees dispensing
Draper grants were, among others, Bouscaren and a Virginia University
professor named Henry Garrett. In May, 1959, Garrett appeared with a
group that sought from a judge in Queens an incorporation charter for
their new organization. The judge acidly turned them down because, he
said, of its “malevolent purpose,” namely racism.

As a matter of fact, when I stop and think about it, it really wasn’t
The Gazette and Daily and the Cap-Times that ﬁnally got Arens kicked up-
stairs late last year to a $19,000 claims court job. It was the Washington
Post. When May took his ﬁndings to Speaker Sam Rayburn, suggesting
that Arens be ﬁred as Committee staff director, the House chieftain in-
sisted that May would have to nail down the fact that Arens was actually

\ employed by the Draper fund, because such employment might be in con-

ﬂict with a federal statute against outside employment for Congressional

13

 

 

committee personnel. When the Post brought forth the $3,000 ﬁgure,
Arens had had it as a Congressional employee-—not for being a profes-
sional merchant of hate, but for taking outside employment.

Before that happened, however, May had gotten the fascinating ad-
mission from Arens that he had also acted as adviser to other philan-
thropists seeking to invest money in “patriotic” groups and causes, and
he named the Texas oil tycoon, H. L. Hunt, and the North Carolina
pharmaceutical tycoon, Smith Richardson, both well-known super-patriots
and white supremacists. This, for the ﬁrst time in the Committee’s career,
raised the interesting question whether one of the most important of all
the Committee’s functions in the American underworld of hate has been
to play a key role in ﬁnancing it. p

There is a ﬁnal note to the Draper story. May wrote that Draper
had originally been introduced into political society by his friend, the
late Sen. Pat McCarran. It will be recalled that it was McCarran and
Walter who drafted the present Immigration Act and that its aim was,
and is, to maintain “the traditional racial balance” in immigration to
this country. Some of the sources of that immigration philosophy are
now clear. ' '

In his book “Witch Hunt” Carey McWilliams, editor of The Nation,
takes to task those who make an operative distinction between the civil
rights struggle of the Negroes and the civil liberties struggle. It is clear
from the Committee’s record that such adistinction is dangerous. But
let me stress that it is just this dual aspect of the Committee that iden-
tiﬁes it as a dyed-in-the-wool hate group. All bona ﬁde hate groups are,
or get to be, anti-everything except the corporate state. And the only
reason they are for the corporate state is that it is the one form of society
likely to make use of the “kike-killer” idea—-which, of course, is equally
effective against Reds, Blacks, Pinks, and Papists. It is this that distin-
guishes the Un-American Activities Committee, even from the most
iniquitous inquisitions of the past.

A predominant anti-Negro sentiment has been a long and consistent
thread in the Committee’s hate-group psychology. And if there is any
doubt about the attention paid to this shade of Nazi racism within the
hate underworld, one need only go back to January, 1948, when President
Truman presented his ten-point civil rights program. The program in-
cluded the outlawing of Jim Crowism, lynching, and the poll tax and
envisioned establishment of a federal Fair Employment Practices Com-
mission.

This event set off a concerted assault by the hate groups. Smith in
The Cross and the Flag called F EPC‘ a “Communist, Jew-inspired trick
to force industry . . . to ﬁll up . . . with Jews and Negroes.” Hart
warned of “bloodshed” if the New York State FEPC was set up. John
W. Hamilton, the pro-Nazi Boston representative of McIntire’s American
Council of Christian Churches, was a leader in the ﬁght against a Mas-
sachusetts FEPC. Meanwhile, back in the House, the extreme racist op-
position to the program (as distinct from the moderate racist opposition)
came from Committee leader Rankin. Rankin’s denunciations echoed the

14

 

 

hate-mongering attacks of the publications named in the war-time sedition

trials—“Communistic,” “out of Moscow,” “Jew-inspired” (Rankin made

much of “the New York Jew, Spingarn,” who was president of the
NAACP).

One of the most frequently cited charges against the Committee has
always been the fact that it has never haled the Klu Klux Klan before it.
But such a charge is nonsensical when it is considered that ﬁve of the
Committee’s leaders have been rabidly anti-Negro-and two of these, it
is important to note, were Northerners. A hate-group leader told John
Roy Carlson he understood that Dies had been a Klansman. Assistant
Attorney General" 0. John Rogge told a House Lobby committee he would
present “conclusive evidence” that J. Parnell Thomas (of New Jersey)
had been a Klan member if it would call Thomas before it (the Commit-
tee turned down the offer). Rankin held the Klan to be a “100% Amer-
ican institution,” and Committee Chairman John S. Wood (of Georgia)
scoffed at demands for an investigation of the Klan by declaring that its
“activities are 100% American.” Chairman Walter’s professional con-
nection with the odious Draper Fund brings the thread up to date.

‘While the Committee has apparently not had the courage to join
open battle against the integration movement to the same extent that it
has interfered in the labor movement by suddenly holding hearings in
localities where a labor dispute or NLRB election was in progress, it did
do so on one notable occasion. It opened up hearings in Atlanta directed
against integrationists, and the result was the Braden case, decided by
the Supreme Court only recently. In his widely published dissent in that
case (joined by three other Justices), Justice Hugo Black pinned down
the purpose of the Committee’s raid on Atlanta—or at least of Braden’s
subpoena——-as an attempt to cripple the integration movement there.

As noted previously, it is a salient fact of the Committee’s history
that its most ardent advocates have been the legions of organized bigotry
and that the Committee owes them a great debt for their vigorous cam-
paigns in its behalf whenever the wisdom of its franchise has been called
into question. Of late, in the face of a nationwide drive by civil liberties
groups for the Committee’s abolition, a spate of new ultra-rightist organi-
zations, experiencing an unprecedented leap into prominence, have stormed
to the Committee’s defense.

One of the new defenders is a gray ﬂannel-suited student movement
called Young Americans for Freedom (YAF), which within six months
of its founding in September, 1960 had spread to some 100 college cam-
puses. Though the YAFs have made quite a thing out of respectability, at
least‘ in their dress, their adult “Board of Advisers” includes Rev. Carl
T. Mclntire, who is still one of the nation’s most industrious merchants
of hate (Carl T., Jr., trained and educated in the schools supported by
his father’s American Council of Christian Churches, is on the YAF
Board of Directors). YAF has been a key transmi-ssion-belt for col-
lege showings of the House Committee’s widely discredited ﬁlm on the
San Francisco student demonstrations of May, 1960 called “Operation

15

 

  

Abolition.” For the showings, and for other occasions, it supplies pro-
Committee speakers on request. (The Committee, whose soundtrack
argues that the demonstrations against a Committee hearing were a
Communist plot, was ﬁnally forced to concede in a report to Congress
that the commentary and ﬁlm editing had resulted in “inaccuracies.”)

A second, more important group is the John Birch Society, an
admittedly authoritarian, semi-secret organization founded in December,
1958 by a former manufacturer named Robert H. W. Welch, Jr., who,
in his November, 1961 Bulletin to members, excoriated political democracy
as “a perennial fraud” and cast an implied insult at the Founding Fathers.
In some areas where the Society has strong chapters—Arizona, Kansas
and California have been especially reported on in the press-—it has
teamed up with Mclntire factions to attack local and national Protestant
leaders; the Austin, Tex. Observer, for example, writing that Amarillo,
Tex. had been “rent with strife” by such tactics.

“The only Latin-American governments Welch endorsed in ‘The
Blue Book,’ the Society’s basic manual,” reported A. J. Liebling in The
New Yorker, “were Paraguay, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and
Batista’s Cuba, all dictatorships.” The Founder, as he calls himself, also
promotes the cause of the Fascist Secret Army Organization (O.A.S.) of
Algeria and France. Prominent on Welch’s board of directors and a
Manhattan Chapter Leader is Merwin K. Hart, now the leading Franco
propagandist in the country and still a producer of anti-Semitic literature.
The Society is spiritedly anti-labor, and one of its prime targets is the
Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision and the man who wrote it,
Chief Justice Earl Warren, whom the Society is campaigning to “impeach.”

The “Blue Book” dismisses civil rights as a Communist “slogan.” To be '

associate editor of the Society’s organ, American Opinion, Welch resur-
rected the former House Commitee staff director, J. B. Matthews, whom
Welch has said he employs to help him “smell out Communists.”

The Un-American Activities Committee is represented on the John
Birch Society’s national “Committee of Endorsers” by Rep. Gordon
Scherer of Ohio, and the Society’s chapters in some 35 states are currently
the most effective champions of the Committee. They have been successful
in getting “Operation Abolition” shown before countless thousands of
Americans at schools, colleges, military bases, churches and clubs. On
“Meet The Press” May 20, 1961, Welch declared the Society had been
responsible for more screenings of the ‘Committee ﬁlm “than all other
organizations combined.” (The Committee itself claims more than 15
million Americans have seen the picture.)

The newest demagogue in the tradition of political revivalism exem-
pliﬁed by the Smiths, Winrods and Springers was, in effect, set up in
business by the Committee. He is Dr. Fred C. Schwarz, whose Christian
Anti-Communist Crusade is the third fast-growing beneﬁciary of the
present upsurge in American political fundamentalism, and who has
been particularly successful in organizing so-called anti-Communist schools
in cities and at military bases across the nation. Soon after Dr. Schwarz
arrived in this country from Australia in 1953 he was taken under the

16

 

 

Committee’s wing. He was hired as a “consultant” on un-Americanism,
and Staff Director Arens helped him develop the school project and
promoted the Crusade by speaking for it and participating as a “faculty”
member at the “schools.” The crack-pot nature of the teachings at these
“schools” has aroused protests suﬂicient to persuade the Pentagon to take
steps to ban them from Army and Naval bases. However, at large, revival-
type meetings—one of which, in the mammoth Hollywood Bowl, was
televised for three hours under the sponsorship of three big industrial
ﬁrms—Dr. Schwarz has had ample opportunity to repay the Committee
by pushing its cause and its chief current propaganda instrument, “Opera-
tion Abolition.”

A ﬁnal note about the man who has replaced Arens as Committee
staﬁ director, Frank S. Tavenner, Jr. When he was Committee counsel,
Tavenner wrote to one Myron C. “Fagin” (actually Fagan) of Hollywood,
Cal. taking “my hat oﬁ” to Fagan and his activities in ﬁghting “Red
treason in Hollywood.” As the Cinema Educational Guild, Inc. F agan
conducts a paranoid crusade against the entertainment industry (“Every
time you permit REDS to come into your living-room via your TV set
you will be helping Moscow and the Internationalists to destroy Amer-
ica! ! 1”) Among “some 300” of “the most rabid Reds and Fellow-Trav-
elers,” Fagan lists the late James Thurber, the late Moss Hart, Archibald
MacLeish, Arthur Miller, William L. Shirer, Aaron Copeland, Leonard

Bernstein, Sol Hurok, Bennett Cerf, Elia Kazan, Chet Huntley, and J

Lucille Ball, Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck, Rita Hayworth, Burt Lancaster,
Danny Kaye, Groucho Marx, Lloyd Bridges and Henry Fonda.

Fagan ﬂatly charges such people with “treason per se to this
country,” and the reason he himself claims he can get away with doing
it is that the charge is “authenticated” in the “oﬂicial” records of “un-
impeachable government agencies”—namely, the House Un-American
Activities Committee, the California State Senate Fact-Finding Committee
and the FBI. It is into hands like Mr. F agan’s that the gossip-column
dossiers of the House Committee most frequently ﬁnd their way.

Almost ﬁfteen years ago, 22 members of the faculty of Yale Univer-
sity Law School sent a letter to President Truman and the Speaker of the
House which contained this statement: “There are alarming signs that
persecution for opinion, if not curbed, may reach a point never hitherto
attained even in the darkest periods of our history. With it, we may expect
racial, religious and every other kind of bigotry . . .” This prophecy
showed a keen comprehension of the nature of the Un-American Activities
Committee, whose immediate abolishment the signers urged, and whose
continued existence brought the prophecy to fulﬁllment (the ﬁrst part of
it principally upheld in the later rise of McCarthyism).

In mid-1947, the Committee responded to continuing liberal pressure
by setting up a Subcommittee to Investigate Fascism headed by Rep. John
McDowell of Pennsylvania, of whom Gerald L. K. Smith reported that
“he has some of the same backers that I have.” The subcommittee held
one session, said to have lasted ten minutes, and then announced: “The

17

 

pressure for an investigation of native fascists comes from Communists.”
McDowell admitted that so-called hate groups existed, but he said they
were “not dangerous.” This is a judgment with which I happen to concur,
regarding hatism as a prime example of the errpr Jefferson said should
be allowed to stand as a monument to the power of truth to prevail when
it is left free to do so. With one or two exceptions like the Klan, the
underworld operates by speech, press, association, and petition, and it
enjoys the same right to these Constitutional freedoms as the rest of us.

There is one hate group, however, which has no access whatever to
this right and which is dangerous. That is the House Un-American Activ-
ities Committee. The American form of government is a dictatorship in
reverse. The citizen may dictate to the government; he may deny the
privilege of speech or association, or any other activity, to an agency
of government. The Committee is dangerous because it can not merely
seek but act out the reverse of that relationship, because it can suppress
the freedoms of others, and because it gives a false and unfair advantage
to error over truth by providing it an oﬂicial forum and transmission-
belt: it translates error into dangerous action. This is a hate group that
should be summarily eliminated. ,

“The American people,” said a victim of the Committee, one of the
Hollywood Ten, more than a dozen years ago, “are going to have to
choose between the Bill of Rights and the Thomas Committee. They can-
not have both. One or the other must be abolished. . . .” Today, accord-
ing to four members of the U. S. Supreme Court, the Bill of Rights is
going fast.

Foreword

In the following pages an American newspaperman advances the
shocking thesis that the House Un-American Activities Committee is
a hate group. He takes pain to deﬁne a hate group sharply as one whose
members “do not debate . . . they conduct political warfare . . . are
indeed exclusively anti, and sooner or later, this fanatical anti-ism be-
comes involved in one degree or another in ideological genocide . . .” As
a civil libertarian, David Wesley defends the constitutional right of a
private group to sow hatred “by speech, press, association, and petition.”
As a citizen, he denies to an agency of government the power to use
hate as a weapon of national policy.

Mr. Wesley does not write as a victim or potential victim of the
HUAC, except insofar as that Congressional body has arrogated to itself
the power to punish its critics~—or except insofar as any citizen of good-
will may provoke the wrath of our legislative inquisition. (A bare majority
of the Supreme Court has sanctioned such Star Chamber conduct of the
HUAC in the Braden and Wilkinson decisions, with Justices Black, Bren-
nan, Douglas, and Warren eloquently dissenting.) Mr. Wesley writes as
an independent-minded working newspaperman—editor of the editorial
page of the York, Pa., Gazette and Daily, ex-Life staffer, onetime foreign
and UN correspondent for the Overseas News Agency.

The astounding hypothesis that the HUAC might be a hate group
struck Mr. Wesley after a reporter for his paper and the Madison, Wisc.,
Capital Times, Ronald May, revealed the racist associations of HUAC
Chairman Walter and Staff Director Arens. Mr. Wesley found veriﬁcation
for his hunch after digging through a sickening mass of evidence cover-
ing the HUAC’s 23-year history. He ends with the documented fact that
a committee of Congress since 1938 has stood close to the center of
organized, racial, religious, and social bigotry.

In 1959 the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee reprinted a re-
markable but little remarked speech by Irving Brant, the distinguished
biographer of Madison, asserting the constitutional objection to legislative
inquisitions: that their actions comprise bills of attainder. This pamphlet,
“Congressional Investigations and Bills of Attainder,” is. still available
to bolster the spirited reassertions of First Amendment freedoms by
Justices Black and Douglas and Professor Alexander Meiklejohn. Now
we are privileged to present the political and moral objection to the
House Un-American Activities Committee: that our government has no
business in the hate business. We commend David Wesley’s revelations
especially to those who are tempted to see the HUAC’s faults primarily
as an excess of zeal accompanied by some disregard for procedural nice-
ties. Readers of the following pages will understand why so many religious
and educational leaders agree that the HUAC must be abolished.

Hate Groups and the Un-American
Activities Committee

By David Wesley

On January -18, 1961, two weeks after a husky rabble of American
Nazi Party members had swarmed into Washington to picket the White
House in defense of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, an
English professor sat in his oﬂice on the campus of the University of
California at Berkeley going over some study material with one of his
graduate students. Tom Parkinson was a poet, Guggenheim Fellow, and
author of many literary studies, as well as a teacher, and the newspapers
were later to describe Stephen Mann Thomas, the 29-year old student, as
a brilliant young scholar. ,

Suddenly, the oﬂice door swung open and a disheveled, wild-eyed

‘young man burst into the room. He carried a Bible in one hand and in

the other a double-barrelled shotgun. Before the two horror-struck scholars
could move, the visitor dropped the Bible on a table, raised the gun and
let go with both barrels. Then he ﬂed.

Thomas, more directly in the line of ﬁre, his back riddled with
bullets, fell dead. Professor Parkinson spent months recuperating from a
shattered jaw, which required skin grafting and plastic surgery. When he
was picked up two days later the fanatical killer, John Harrison Farmer,
son of a judge with a Master’s degree in journalism, told police he had
sworn death to all “Communists,” that God had commanded him to seek
this retribution.

Farmer did not know Tom Parkinson, but what he had read about
him had convinced him he was a Communist. Farmer had read that the
poet had supported the student-faculty demonstrations against the House
Un-American Activities Committee, whose San Francisco hearings of the
previous year had ended in an outcropping of ﬁre hoses. He had read

“ a scurrilous article in which Parkinson was attacked for his telling

criticisms of the Committee.

 While he was recovering from his terrifying close-range shotgun
wounds, Tom Parkinson wrote to a friend, of mine: “. . . the chief thing
that cannot be compensated for is the death of my most able and most
likable graduate student. Stephen Thomas was the ﬁnest graduate student
that I have ever had. It's a terrible thing to know that you are alive
because another person is dead; for if Thomas had not been in the oﬂice,
I should certainly have got both barrels of the shot-gun. «I carry, inci-

dentally, sixty pellets in my cheek and jaw, for the rest of my life. But
the real burden is the loss of that wonderful young man. He would have
been one of the great scholars of this age. . . .

“It’s amazing, isn’t it,” he went on. “I hope that a new climate in
Washington may spread through the country. ~We need some changes
in thought and feeling. . . . As I said earlier, the main problem for me
now is a deep sadness. . . . Somehow I could take being shot myself
with relative equanimity, but I brood on the death of the innocent, the
detached, the accidental victims of casual slaughter. It makes me feel that
in my life from now on I have to do the work of two men. . . .”

This is the harvest of hate.

Some months before the snuﬂing out of the young scholar’s life, as
it happened, my newspaper had been partly responsible for uncovering
an example——a particularly monstrous example, which I shall come to
later—of the involvement of the House Committee on Un-American Activ-
ities with America’s professional hate groups. In consequence of these
stories, I was led into an exploration of this side of the Committee’s life,
and the journey proved to be one of astonishing discovery for me.

When I embarked on the scrutiny-—a scrutiny of the Committee’s
links with the merchandisers of hate—I was ﬁrst struck by the arresting
paradox in such an idea. Like most people, I was aware of the fact that
the Committee had occasionally been graced by an unsavory character or
two, either as a friendly witness, or on the inquisitional dais itself, but
I had never really paused to reﬂect on how very odd it should be for a

Congressional committee charged with investigating Un-American activ-

ities to be associated in any way, except as investigator, with hatists.
If there is anything subversive of a free society, it would certainly appear
to be organized bigotry, meaning the zealous pursuit of eliminating from
that society not merely ideas or ideologies one disagrees with, but also
the people who hold them. Hate groups——and this will serve as my deﬁni-
tion for the subject of this essay—do not debate (if I were a foundation
man I would say they do not participate in the democratic dialogue), they
conduct political warfare, and in almost all cases a rather brutal form of
that warfare. They do not promote their own point of view so much as
they seek to destroy other views—-and, as I said, the people who hold
them as well. They are indeed exclusively anti, and sooner or later, this
fanatical anti-ism becomes involved in one degree or another in ideo-
logical genocide——racial elimination in theory if not in practice.

How wildly contradictory then would be the spectacle of an official
Un-American Activities investigative body having truck of any kind with
the professional merchants of hate.

I undertook my research to discover whether such was actually the
case, on a suﬂiciently consistent or institutional basis, that is, to be a fact
of the Committee’s life. And almost before you could say House Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities, I began to grasp something that seems
to have either escaped, or been diplomatically ignored by, just about
everyone. That is that the House Committee is a hate group itself. I do
not mean this in the sense of an epithet, nor do I mean it in any kind of

ﬁgurative sense. I mean it as a technical deﬁnition. When we explore the
nature and operations of the professional hate groups, that is to say, we
ﬁnd not merely that the Committee has had close and continuous links
with them throughout its 23 years of existence; we ﬁnd that those links
comprise nothing more than the natural alliance that any hate group has
with all the others. The connection between the Committee and the non-
governmental institutions of hate is not that it occasionally makes use of
inhabitants of this underworld; the only conclusion the student can come
to is that the Committee is itself an inhabitant of the underworld.

The most helpful way to define and identify an organization or in-
stitution is to locate the class or category of institutional activity into
which it may ﬁt. -One classiﬁes, of course, by noting characteristics and
behavior in common and the dearth of differences. There are any number
of characteristics identifying the behavior of hate—traits the student
ﬁnds all such groups possess. There is, ﬁrst of all, the “anti” syndrome, a
hallucinatory persecution complex, usually quite indistinguishable from
actual paranoia. In an orientation lecture distributed to Special Services
oﬁicers in World War II, the US. Army put it this way: “In the United
States, native fascists have often been anti-Catholic, anti-Jew, anti-Negro,
anti-labor, anti-foreign born.” The Committee for its part,” we shall find,
has always. been chimerically anti-radical, of every hue; anti-leadership,
whether government, church or party; anti-liberal and anti-libertarian;
anti-labor; anti-intellectual; anti-Negro; anti-alien; anti-Semitic; and
anti-democracy itself.

There is, secondly, a fanatical devotion to the status qu'o, or more
speciﬁcally to its most extreme form, thecorporate state; and in this con-
nection, Committee Chairman Francis E. Walter has recently provided
a typical example. He has introduced a bill aimed at bailing out the
electrical industry from the consequences of its being caught setting up
the corporate state within its own bailiwick. (The bill would give judges
the discretion to establish ordinary damages in anti-trust cases instead of
the now mandatory triple damages.)

Thirdly, there is a common language. Congressman John E. Rankin,
a dominant ﬁgure of the Committee for many years, once, for example,
referred to Walter Winchell as a “slime-mongering kike.” The latter word,
of course, is a favorite in the hate underworld, achieving its most allit-
erative expression during the 1952 election campaign, when one of the
candidates was affectionately known as “Ike the Kike.” There is also, as
one ﬁnds in every ﬁeld of endeavor, an interlocking system of ideas and
information and a congenial fraternity of the people engaged in the ﬁeld.
The Committee’s history in this respect leaves no doubt as to its place
within the American underworld of hate—and, furthermore, its role
within that world as a kind of national clearing-house and oﬂicial forum
for the general promotion of the merchandise of hate.

As a consequence of exploring this subject, I have come to believe,
in fact, that the most astounding single thing about this astounding insti-
tution is that this history——the history of the Committee as a bona ﬁde
American hate group—has never been written, so far as I know. Bits and

5

 

 

  

pieces of it, of course, are generally known—though less so the most
recent episodes——but they have never been organized into a coherent
record that would demonstrate once and for all that the House Commit-
tee is never to be confused with a legitimate Congressional investigative
body. Moreover, most of this history has been forgotten. I noted at the
start the supreme contradiction of such a committee consorting with
merchants of hate. But the contradiction is a really extraordinary one,
for the fact is that the Committee owes its existence entirely to these

forces. And even more extraordinary, the Committee’s leaders themselves .

might well have been liable to prosecution in wartime America for Un-
American activities in the legal sense, had they not possessed Congres-
sional immunity.

In taking a glimp-se at this history we must recall at the start that
the House Un-American Activities Committee was actually the invention
and creature of one of the most notorious hate-mongers in the annals
of the nation———a rabble-rouser, racist and ardent pro-Nazi, Rep. Hamilton
Fish. It was his constant agitation for a decade in the House that. ﬁnally
produced the Committee, and his own previous Special Investigating
unit had set the pattern and design for it. The ﬁrst chairman of the Com-
mittee, Martin Dies, was Hamilton F ish’s disciple and the two of them,
along with another key member of the Committee, Rep. John E. Rankin,
were the most favored and applauded Americans of the Nazi Propaganda
Ministry. I

Dies’s ﬁrst act was to appoint as Chief Committee Investigator one
Edward F. Sullivan, two years before a principal speaker at an Asheville,
N. C., convocation of the Nazi-Fascist ﬁfth column in America—attended
by such leaders of the movement as William Dudley Pelley, founder of
the Silver Shirts, who was sentenced to 15 years for wartime sedition;
James True, inventor of a special blackjack called the “kike-killer” who,
together with Sullivan, put out a pro-Nazi bulletin; and George Deathe-
rage, leader of the self-styled “American Fascist party.” Sullivan took a
prominent part at Asheville and also spoke at both German Bund and
Coughlinite rallies, not as a hate-group celebrity, which he wasn’t, but as
a publicity specialist, which he had become in working as one of the ﬁrst
professional publicists for Nazi ﬁfth column groups.

It is true that Dies himself was shortly given an “Americanism”
award, but the distinction was bestowed on him by the Constitutional
Educational League of Joseph P. Kamp. Kamp, along with his co-editors
of the pro-Nazi, anti-.Semitic Awakener—Lawrence Dennis, later indicted
for sedition, and Harold Lord Varney, an agent of Mussolini——was the
recognized intellectual luminary of the native ﬁfth column. John Roy
Carlson, who became an intimate of the Dennis crowd as an undercover
journalist, reported that Dies was one of Kamp’s “closest associates,” and
he reports in his book “Under Cover” that Dies shared speaking platforms
with such homegrown collaborationists as Rev. Edward Lodge Curran, the
right-hand man of the fascist priest, Father Coughlin, who himself sup-
plied the Committee with copious material, much of it from Nazi propa-
ganda sources. Evidence was later brought to light indicating that both

Kamp and Coughlin received funds from the Japanese and German
governments. V

Kamp, whose private secretary, Hazel Hoffman, worked for the Com-
mittee for a time as a “Special Investigator,” was a proliﬁc producer of
hate pamphlets, and a two-way collaboration with Dies quickly helped
to mushroom the Committee’s ﬁles on the one hand, and give ofﬁcial
luster to the League’s “educational” material on the other. The Com-
mittee worked in conjunction with three others who were top Nazi propa-
gandists——-Merwin K. Hart, director of the National Economic Council;
Fritz Kuhn, head of the German-American Bund; and that celebrated
tassel on the lunatic fringe, Rev. Gerald L./K. Smith. In recognition of his
services, Hart threw a banquet in Dies’s honor and Kuhn attended it.
For that matter, the FCC, in a report on Axis shortwave broadcasts. to
this country, noted: “Rep. Dies received as many favorable references in
Axis propaganda in this country as any living American public ﬁgure.
His opinions were quoted by the Axis without criticism at any time.”
This was during the war. Some went to jail for less.
* As to how the Committee functioned as a principal resource of the
U. S. hate underworld, Rep. Samuel Dickstein told the House: “I10

fascist organizations in the United States have had, and have now, the .

key to the‘ back door of the Un-American Activities Committee.” The
organizations not only fed the committee ﬁles _(one prominent professional
hate-peddler, Walter S. Steele, alone provided some 400 pages of “testi-
mony”), but their publications——especially Smith’s The Cross and the

I Flag and Rev. Gerald Winrod’s Defender, both of which were named in

sedition indictments—-—frequently carried Committee material and articles

by Committee members. The Committee, in other words, acted as a’

principal pinion of the poison press network, and was constantly praised
therein for its labors. '

Needless to say, the odor. from all this soon began seeping out of
the Committee rooms, and the Dies Committee’s life was threatened.
Whereupon, wrote Kamp in The Awahener, “the League (his League)
began a nation-wide drive on its behalf, secured over 4 million signatures
to petitions and deluged Congress with an avalanche of letters and tele-
grams from aroused patriots. . . . The Dies Committee,” he goes on,
“expressed its appreciation and, at a later date, Congressman Clare Hoff-
man at a public meeting in New York openly declared that but for the
League’s effective work the Dies Committee would not have been con-
tinued.” Smith, with his Nationalist News Service, used by some 200 hate
sheets, also took credit for helping save the Committee’s life, and Cough-
lin’s Christian Front, numbering thousands of members, also participated
in the campaign on Coughlin’s explicit orders.

/‘What I wish to stress in detailing some of this ancient history is the
atmosphere-—the twilight atmosphere of the large, vociferous, Nazi-col-
laborating underworld of American hate groups that infested pre-war and
wartime America. It was of and out of this underworld that the Commit-
tee was born and has had its life ever since. Sullivan was followed as

Chief Investigator by J. B. Matthews, a peddler of the phony Protocols
of the Elders of Zion whose autobiography was published by a prominent
anti-Semite, John Cecil. Both Matthews and his star witness, Walter 5.
Steele, had helped Elizabeth Dilling compile her fantastically crackpot
“The Red Network,” and Matthews began compiling the Committee’s
dossiers—a million of them, a Committee member reported—-in the
same way.

As counsel came Ernie Adamson who did the bidding of Rev. Smith,
according to Rep. Savage and other Congressmen. Dies, fallen into dis-
repute, decided against running in 1944, and once again the Committee
might have died had not Rep. Rankin of Mississippi maneuvered success-
fully on the opening day of the Congress in 1945 to get it transformed
into a standing committee. Rankin, who then went on to boss the com-
mittee with a fellow-racist, John S. Wood of Georgia, was not regarded
in the underworld as primarily an anti-Negro propagandist, but as the
most fearless anti-Semite in U. S. politics. His anti-Semitic speeches in
the House were as virulent as those by a Kamp, Smith or Winrod at a
fascist camp meeting. A favorite question of his to Committee witnesses
was “How many in that group were Jews?” Back in 1940 Rankin had
won a place on the “honor roll” of W elt-Dienst (World Service), the
central agency at Erfurt of Goebel’s world-wide propaganda network, and
after the War he came hotly to the defense of the indicted F arben and
Nazi military leaders, who, he declared, were being persecuted by “a
racial minority.” This, of course, was precisely the line taken by the other
hate groups.

What these long years did was to create a solid establishment: an
acre of ﬁles, a thoroughly indoctrinated staﬁ,* a ﬁrm tradition, a network
of contacts and sources of information, a conditioned pattern of behavior,
a methodology—all intricately interwoven into the whole frabric of the un-
derworld of hate, with its interlocking directorships and its broad, cross-
pollinating system of propaganda organs. After the ﬁnal collapse of the
Axis, the hate groups, despite the two sedition trials, which, however,
sent only four ﬁfth-columnists to jail, were swiftly back in business, and
the Committee establishment was all geared to do their kind of business.
It continued to play the role effectively. In the first major ﬂoor debate on
the Committee, which took place soon after the 79th Congress convened
in 1946, Rep. Hook of Michigan described the Committee as a “sounding-
board for the un-American fascist groups,” and informed the House that
“Gerald L. K. Smith is not only the Committee’s adviser on un-American-

*In a sworn aiﬁdavit Clyde R. Miller, formerly Education Professor at Teachers
College, Columbia and founder of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, declared that
during a discussion on May 23, 1945 with Adamson and a Committee investigator
named Nicklas, the latter told him: “You go back and tell your Jewish friends that the
Jews in Germany stuck their necks out too far and Hitler took good care of them
and the same thing is going to happen here unless they watch their step.”

Recently, a distinguished, anti-segregationist Southern lady found herself at a
table in the House dining-room with an employee of the Committee who, evidently
impressed by her Southern accent, as she later told a friend of mine, gave vent to
some “shocking” racist opinions about the situation in the South.

ism, he is also the conﬁdant of the Committee’s plans.” Rep. Savage of
Washington complained: “It seems to me all Gerald L. K. Smith has to
do is yell ‘sic ’em’ and the Committee’s counsel (Ernie Adamson) takes
after whatever party Mr. Smith is peeved at.”

In the same debate Representative Sabath of Illinois excoriated
Rankin’s foul fascist language, calling it “vicious,” “insulting,” and “dis-
graceful.” A Washington Congressman, Rep. Coffee, told the House
that the Committee “appears very sympathetic with any organization
which seems to uphold fascism, but very critical of any organization which
seems to oppose fascism.” Said Rep. O’Toole of New York, “The Com-
mittee has permitted itself to become a forum for the dissemination of
racial and religious theories which are not part of our democratic form
of government.”

The Committee’s chief defender in that debate was Rep. Karl Mundt
of South Dakota, a Committee member some of whose activities were
little more savory than those of its other leading members. He had several
times attended or spoken at meetings in which the blame for almost
everything was laid at the door of the Jews.

The Committee’s initial post-war demonstration of its continued adher-
ence to the tenets of the lunatic fringe was a campaign against the notion
that the U. S. was a democracy. In the early months of 1946 veteran,
_liberal, and other organizations that gave undue emphasis to “democracy”
in their literature suddenly began receiving letters from Committee Coun-
sel Adamson wondering, as he wrote one veterans organization, “if you
are suﬂiciently familiar with the history of the United States to be aware
that this country was not organized as a democracy.” To Drew Pearson
on February 11, 1946 he wrote menacingly: “Several people have called
to my attention the closing line of your Sunday night broadcast, ‘make
democracy work.’ I should like very much to have your deﬁnition of the
word ‘democracy’ as you are using it over the radio. If you will be good
enough to supply this information, I will give the matter further con-
sideration to determine whether it should be called to the attention of the
members of the committee for such action as they deem proper.” Pear-
son’s reply was to suggest that a padded cell be warmed up for Adamson.

In a letter sent out to the constituents of a west coast Congressman,
Adamson carried his thesis even further: “The Fifth amendment of the
Constitution of the United States was enacted for the purpose of prevent-
ing this government from ever being a true democracy.” Reading a copy
of this letter to the House, the Congressman declared angrily: “This per-
version of the Constitution . . . comes straight from the lips of Elizabeth
Dilling. These are the teachings of American fascists, indicted for sedition
by the government of the United States.” (Congressmen might have
pointed to Merwin K. Hart’s bizarre suggestion that it was through the
inﬂuence of “the Communist International of 1935” that the word democ-
racy “became substituted almost entirely for the word ‘republic.’ ”)

The Committee, illustrating a salient characteristic of hate groups,‘

was blissfully unmoved by the" opposition aroused by this little crusade.
