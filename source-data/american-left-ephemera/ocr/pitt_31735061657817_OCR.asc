—U. S. SUPREME COURT.
June ‘I4. ‘I943

VVhat’s the Genesis of this case? How did this come
to “the land of the free and the home of the brave”?

That ’s a fair question. It deserves a fair answer.

President Truman ﬂuﬁed it oﬁ at a press conference
recently. He said Witch hunts always follow in the wake
of Wars in American history. He implied he didn’t like
them. Witch hunts, that is.

Well, that ’s one answer.

We ’ve got another one.

It was President Truman himself who touched off
the cannonade against our liberties. -

His Executive Order 9835 leads the “loyalty check”
parade.

The order was issued March 23, 1947. It was sup-
posed to provide for the elimination of disloyal persons
from government employment.

The order enables a government agency making a
charge of disloyalty to hold a “hearing” and to conduct
a “review.” Thus the accuser, judge and jury are usually
one and the same.

The accused employee receives no statement of spe-
ciﬁc charges, is not permitted to confront his anonymous
accusers, is refused the right to cross examine witnesses.

The order provides for the creation of a huge “in-
vestigating” police staﬁf to probe the private lives,
thoughts, associations and even the school days of every
government employee, thus creating an atmosphere where

 
 
  
   
  
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
    

every bit of gossip, tattle and personal malice becomes
substance for a “d1sloyalty” charge.

The order provides for a .“Master Index” of all
employees against whom any accusations were ever made,
even though such accusations were later proved unfound-
ed. This type of blacklist was once outlawed in private
industry.

The order enables one man, the attorney general,
to set up a list of organizations “afﬁliation, membership
or sympathetic association with which” makes a person
‘ ‘subversive. ’ ’

But as of August 15, 1949, after 29 months of “loyal-
ty” checking of more than 2,000,000 government em-
ployees by the FBI, the loyalty review board of the
U. S. Civil Service Commission reported that only 62
Federal employes had been dismissed on grounds of
“doubtful” loyalty. That makes the percentage—less than
.000027 of 1 per cent. ~

This is baffling. Why all the steam on “loyalty”
if even on such ﬂimsy charges as are made in these hear-
ings only a handful of government employees are found
guilty of “disloyalty”? There ’s still another baffler.

Our government is adequately protected against dis-
loyal (no quotes, this time) persons by the application
of standards long established in laws.

These prohibit: Acts or conduct of disloyalty to the
government, or membership in an oragnization so advocat-
ing; violation of the oath of office which is prescribed
by statute and calls for undivided loyalty to the United
States government; violation of laws against treason,
sedition, sabotage, espionage, or unlawful disclosure of
conﬁdential information.

The real security needs of our government are taken
care of by existing laws. ‘They were adequate in wartime.
Why then the Truman Loyalty Order in peacetime?

C We charge that there is a conspiracy in this coun-
try of ours to wipe out the elemental liberties that we
as a people have prized since 1789 when our forefathers
insisted that the Bill of Rights be an integral part of
the Federal Constitution.

11

  

C We charge that the “cold war’n’_ has ‘frozen in its icy
grasp the peacetime developments ..we might have expected

in this country: an expanding economy and a widening

range of civil rights. ,

{C We charge the “cold war ’I’_ and the “loyalty order”
were designed to create‘ an atmosphere in which an air
force general could say calmly——“targets for A—bombs
already have been selected.” ' ' '

‘C We charge that one intent of the Loyalty Order was
to make it possible for President Truman to shout “Me,
too” in the recent campaign at Republicans babbling
about their “anti-subversive” records.

'0 We charge that the effect of the Loyalty Order was
to create an atmosphere in which midnight pumpkin
hunts would be taken seriously, in which a scare psychol-
ogy could be implanted in every well-meaning citizen ’s
heart, in which scientists could be hounded for daring to

think, in which a blacklist could be eifected against Hol-

    

lywood artists who would not sink to bended knee be-
fore a farcical Congressional committee.

The plain fact is . . .the ﬁnancial oligarchy that rules
the rulers of America is attempting today to establish
this country as the world capital of thought control, is
attempting to overthrow our democratic institutions.

The plain fact is . . . there is a conspiracy to swing
this nation away from the philosophy expressed by the
Supreme Court in 1937:

“ Tie maintenance of the opportunity for free polit-
ical discussion to the end that government may be respons-
ive to the will of the people’ and that changes may be
obtained by lawful means, an opportunity essential to
the security of the Republic, is a fundamental principle
of our constitutional system.

“A, statute which _upon its face, and as authorita-
tively construed, is so vague and indeﬁnite as to permit
the punishment of the fair use of." this. opportunity," is
repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the
Fourteenth Amendment.” ' "   '   ’ '

CHARTER OUT — ‘LOYALTY’ IN

"No person In the classified service . . . shall
be appointed. or reduced or removed or In any
war favored or dlsorlmlnaied against because
of Is polﬂleal or rellalous oplnlons or affiliation."

—Los Angeles county
Cllarier. Section 41

_Treading manfully in the path marked out by the
Pres1dent’s Loyalty Order, the ﬁve members of Los An-
geles County ’s governing Board of Supervisors on April
1, 1947, played a grim April Fool’s jest on the rights
guaranteed 20,000 County employees in the Federal Con-
stittution and in the County Charter. '

Unanimously, the ﬁve supervisors directed Chief Ad-
ministrator Wayne Allen and County Counsel Harold
Kennedy to draft’ legislation designed to investigate the
political beliefs and affiliations of the 20,000 employees.

By August 15, a recommended “loyalty check” was
submitted to the supervisors (at least one of whom felt
a twinge of his once-liberal conscience as he proceeded
to revamp the County Charter without the legality of
a referendum vote by the people) and by August 26 the
“loyalty check” in the form of affidavits to be sworn
to by the 20,000 employees was ordered, ﬁrst local “loyal-
ty check” in the nation. '

Instantly it was challenged in the courts by the em-
ployees. It was this challenge, winding its long way through
the various court channels, which now comes before the
Supreme Court.

The-affidavits contained four parts. Three were oaths
dealing with support of the State and Federal Constitu-
tions, a disavowal of advocacy to overthrow any divi-
sio'_n of the government by force and violence and a dis-
avowal of membership since December 7, 1941, in any
organization that so advocated, and disclosing any other
names under which the employee had ever been known.

13

 

The fourth part was a checklist of 142 organizations
in which the employee was required to indicate member-
ship or “direct or indirect support,” past or present.

This list was borrowed from an identical one issued
by the discredited State Senator Jack B. Tenney. It
was obtained in a Tenney un-American committee re-
port, an earlier edition of which was acclaimed by fascist
Gerald L. K. Smith as his “bible” in a speech heaping
praise on Tenney. ,

(Tenney recently resigned as head of his committee
following public disclosure of suspicious payment of state
funds by his committee and after a series of “loyalty
checks” sponsored by him to cover nearly everyone in
the state had been defeated by public pressure on the
state legislature as steps leading to creation of a police
state.)

The list contained the names of four labor unions,
ﬁve political organizations, two publications, two schools,
ﬁve organizations dealing with various aspects of foreign
aﬁairs, six with problems of civil rights and discrim-
ination and six with civic affairs.

Among them were:

Hold the Price Line Committee, League of Women
Shoppers, American Communications Ass ’n. (CIO), Amer-
ican Oommunist Party, Mooney Defense Committee,
Bridges Defense Committee, International Workers Order,
National Citizens Political Action Committee, United
Federal Workers (CIO), Civil Rights Congress, Bay Area
Council Against Discrimination, Citizens Committee for
Better Education, California Labor School.

The lawyers’ brief put it thoroughly:

“The full aﬁront of (the ‘Board of Supervisors’)
scheme and plan against the liberties of speech, thought
and association cannot be appreciated without noting the

‘ shocking breadth of the area of thought and speech cov-

ered by the organizations and publications listed in the
afﬁdavit as suspect, connection with which is alone enough
to shift to the employee, at the minimum, the burden of
proving his innocence of verboten advocacy.”

What was the point to the list?

14

 

The Association of Unitarian and Universalist Min-
isters of Southern California put the ﬁnger on it. A
resolution adopted unanimously by the Association said:

“To submit loyal Americans who believe in freedom
of conscience to an examination by the County Govern-
ment of their personal thinking and the organizations to
which they belong is to do them an incalculable harm,
and to deprive them of their constitutional immunity
from governmental interference with their rightful ac-
tions and thoughts.

"Such a person is no longer a creative and good
citizen. he becomes afraid to join any organization or
attend any meetings of any sort lest he be termed sub-
versive or un-American. and be deprived of his livelihood."

The public outcry stayed the hand of the execution-
ers While the litigation ground on.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the County employees took
a deposition from County Chief Administrator Wayne
Allen on January 19, 1948.

O Q. “In the event that any employee shall fail or
refuse to execute this oath or afﬁdavit will he be dis-
charged for that reason?”

'0 A. (By Allen) “No, sir.”

‘O Q. “At this time does any officer or agent of the
County have authority to reduce, remove or in any Way
discriminate against any County employee because of
failure or refusal to execute the oath or affidavit?”

:0 A. “Not to my knowledge. I don ’t see how any
oflicer could under the law.”

But then came a ruling in a Los Angeles Superior
Court which held that if the Benevolent and Protective
Order of Elks was not in violation of the Federal Con-
stitution in exacting a loyalty oath from its members,
then the County also Was not in violation in its oath.

On May 5, 1948, the afﬁdavits were presented to_ all
County employees. There was a week’s grace to sign.

‘15

And it was announced that failure to sign within the week
would be grounds for dismissal. despite the Coun Char-
ter to the contrary. despite Wayne Allen's depos tion to
the contrary.

Seventeen County employees, several submitting their
own versions of loyalty oaths Without beneﬁt of Ten-
ney verboten lists, refused to sign, saying that their belief
in the American Constitution prevented them from sign-
ing such an unconstitutional document.

They were dismissed forthwith——for insubordination.

Seventy-three others signed the ‘‘loyalty’’ affidavits,
declined to sign the Tenney list. They were retained
pending the ﬁnal disposition of the legal case.

But that was just the beginning . . .

Early in the fall of 1948, Army brasshats called a
special conference in the Pentagon Building in Washing-
ton. To this conference they invited only top executives of
the larger cities. The brass said the nature of the confer-
ence was a top-drawer, hush-hush secret.

Off to the conference hurried Los Angeles’ Mayor
Fletcher Bowron.

On his return he allowed himself to be quoted to the
effect that “the Reds are everywhere, something has to
be done.”

The Mayor did it. He caused to be introduced in
the City Council an ordinance requiring an oath that the
employee was not a member of the Communist Party. In
the fall of 1948 the ordinance was passed. By January
7, 1949, 23 city employees were discharged for refusing
to sign the oath on the grounds that it violated constitu-
tional liberties.

One of those discharged signed the oath after Wrestl-
ing with his conscience in a sleepless night. He turned it
in the next day, nine hours after deadline. He was ﬁred.

16

WHERE DOES IT LEAD?

"We will not. under any fllreaf. or In the face
of any danger. surrender flue guarantees of lib-
erfy our forefathers framed for us In our III!

of lights."
—FRANKL|N D. ROOSEVELT
Dec. 15. 1941

There is a deadly parallel here. It is with Hitler
Germany.

Hitler, too, had “loyalty oaths.” Hitler, too, handed
down Executive Orders. They led to war.

One Hitler Executive Order said:

“Civil servants who have been members of the Com-
munist Party or Communist auxiliary and substitute or-
ganizations or who have otherwise been active along Com-
munist lines, are to be discharged from Civil Service.”

A. L. Pomerantz, chief counsel at Nuremberg in the
trial of Nazi industrialists, quickly saw the parallel on his
return to this country. He wrote:

“I feel that these are some ominous and sickening
parallels between Germany, 1933, and America today.

‘.‘ The decisive tactics used by the Nazis to divide and
conquer the opposition was that old, but ever eifective
bugaboo, the Red scare. It was unnecessary to prove the
charge——it was enough to make it.

“Liberal people and progressive organizations, in an
effort to escape contamination, added fuel to the ﬁre by
joining in the denunciation of the ‘Reds.’ The trade
union movement went through enervating convulsions,
spewing out every Red, suspected Red, or ‘sympathizer.’
And it was while these anti-Hitler forces were embroiled
in this civil war that Hitler seized power.

“It is a tested historical phenomenon that, once the
disintegrating process of eroding civil liberties sets in,
whether the avowed target is the Christian or the Com-
munist, or whoever, it tends to continue until all civil
liberties are destroyed. It is a sort of social law of in-
ertia.

17

 

“There is an hysterical campaign raging here
ostensibly directed against the ever-popular target, the
Communists. When you examine it more closely, however,
it becomes apparent that the attack is really aimed at
the liquidation of all resistance to the mounting tide of
war and reaction. The approach (is) copied from the
Nazis.

“When you ’re trying to whip up a war ‘mentality,
you can ’t afford the luxury of dissent. It is the same
crowd that is crushing civil liberties which is clamoring
for war. This is no accident or coincidence; this was no
accident or coincidence in Germany either.”

These are sober and fearful words. They mean that
in the cannonading of our civil rights at home, the open-
ing shot in the next world war has been ﬁred.

But there is yet time. We can stop the war makers
by beating them in the struggle for preservation of our
freedoms.

Yours is the decisive voice in this struggle.

As Rogge warned, “If we remain silent too long, we
will have forfeited our right to speak.”

But there is more to your part in this struggle than
simply talking about it, spreading the word of the evil
menace threatening this country.

The Los Angeles case, as has been noted above, is
the ﬁrst test of whether you will retain your liberties.

The case puts you in the (start room with us. We
need you with us also in the ﬁnancing of this case. We
need your help to ensure the broad distribution of this
pamphlet.

Money is needed urgently. You can help. Contribute

would say. “It couldn’t happen here. This is America!”

Believe it or not, think it sham or not—-it’s true
that in the week of October 17 a case will come before
the U. S. Supreme Court so basic in its test of our tradi-
tional liberties that it could be entitled . . .

The People vs. Thought Control.

It IS happening in America. It ’s happening to
YOU. You will be in that court room. You and the
liberties you ’ve come to prize as unshakeably yours.

The case will be introduced undramatically.

It will be presented ofﬁcially as the case of Helen
Parker, et. al. Vs. County. of Los Angeles, et al.

It will be the ﬁrst “loyalty. oath”. case to hit the
Supreme Court. -

It will test whether the government rules the ‘peo-
ple, or, as we have come to believe in this country, the
people rule the government.

It will revolve around an attempt by the County of
Los Angeles to pry into the minds, thoughts, Words, and
associations of its 20,000 employees through means of
“loyalty chec ” afﬁdavits, and an attempt arbitrarily to
establish these afﬁdavits as a condition of employment.

On the decision will swing the fate of the ominous
pattern of witch hunts now sweeping across the country.

On the decision will swing the whole lineup of
“loyalty oaths” from President Truman’s Executive
Order 9835 on down to that foisted on thepeople by the
lowliest hamlet. - .- ,. ' ‘

On the, decision will swing the question of whether

‘any group of men have ‘ the ’ power to arrogate to them-

selves the authority to ‘deny employment to anyone be-
cause of political faith; to be prosecutor, Judge and Jury
in upholding their own ideas of what shall be orthodox

There is here no intent to shock you, shocking though
it may be.

Are you a mailman, a post office employee?

Justin W. Mackey, J r., Negro mail carrier in Los An-
geles, suspended. Charge: One night he had dinner with
a white family. Basis: He admitted he was friendly with
the family.

Bernard Corlin, Los Angeles postal clerk for 34 years,
suspended. Charge: Nine years ago he drove home from
a civil rights meeting someone who was “suspected” of
being a Communist or a Communist “sympathizer.”
Basis: He admitted he couldn’t remember.

Frank Barnes, mailman, suspended. Charge: He part-
icipated in “subversive” picket lines intended to break
down job discrimination at a Sears Roebuck store. Basis:
The Santa Monica branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, of which he was
chairman, supported the picket line.

Are you one of 2,000,000 government employees in
a branch of service other than the post office?

Sid Feldman, government employee in Washington,
D. C., suspended. Charge: He once distributed leaﬂets
protesting cuts in WPA appropriations.

Do you think mother-in-law jokes funny?

 

A government employee was charged with disloyalty
because an associate had heard that his mother-in-law was
‘ ‘ pro-Russian. ’ ’ ‘

Are you a professional man?

Dr. Samuel Rosenthal, Los Angeles medical man.
Dismissed in the city ’s “loyalty” check, though he signed
the required afﬁdavit that he was not a Communist.
Reason: he added a note of his own to the affidavit. “What
is this,” he asked, “Nazi Germany?”

Dr. David M. Goldstein, Los Angeles medical man.
Dismissed in the city ’s “loyalty” check, though he signed
the required aﬁidavit that he was not a Communist.
Reason: he added a note of his own to the afﬁdavit. “Also
not a member of the Ku-Klux-Klan,” he wrote.

Do you yet ask, “What ’s thought control to me?
I’m pure.”

Listen to some of the questions they ’re asking—this
year. Next year, if they are not stopped now, there may
be other questioners who in guttural voices will ask other
questions.

0 Q. What kind of books did you buy?

. I am asking what you thought.
I am interested in your ideas.
Did you ever discuss current events?
What do you think democracy is?

-O . Why did you want 9835 (Truman ’s Executive
Order) repealed?

-O Q. Have any of your neighbors made complaints
about having Negroes in your home‘!

That ’s lifted verbatim from transcripts of Federal
“loyalty” hearings held under Executive Order 9835.

C O C O
<°<:°<:°~‘.°@

Here are a few questions from the Los Angeles County
version.

‘O Q. Do you, or did you, belong to or support,
directly or indirectly, the Hold the Price Line Committee?

0 Q. Do you belong to the League of Women Shop-

ers?

P C Q. Do you belong to the Humanist Society of
Friends?

   

O Q. Do you belong, or did you ever belong, to the
Tom Mooney Defense Committee? Q

0 Q. Did you ever support or follow the Citizens
Committee for Defense of Mexican-American Youth?

‘O Q. Did you belong to, support or follow the Na-
tional Citizens Political Action Committee?

Much of this is cut in the pattern of the Taft-Hartley
Act designed to smash labor unions. Turn back to some
Federal ‘ ‘ loyalty ’ ’ hearings.

O Q. What I am interested in is the kind of activities
the union indulged in.

O Q. I don ’t believe We could get any phase of the
accused ’s activities that would give us a better insight
as to his philosophy other than his union activities.

=0 Q. You have been aware of the fact, haven ’t you,
that (the accused) is an active union member?

0 Q. Why did you switch to the CIO?

As the FBI has admitted, there is a move afoot in
this country to turn brother’ against brother, neighbor
against neighbor—all to be active informers on one an-
other.

Listen to the Federal “loya1ty” checkers.

O Q. Do you recall a meeting at the home of the ac-
cused employee to discuss the Loyalty program and its
effect upon the employees?

0 Q. Have you had any conversations that would
lead you to believe (the accused) is rather advanced in
his thinking on racial matters?_

*0 Q. Do you think she might have been an extrem-
ist about civil liberties—race‘ discrimination——questions of
that nature? .

And, mind you, on answers to questions like these
hangs the fate of Workers" jobs! ‘

Are you a member of a minority group? Take Warn-
ing; According to a federal survey, more than 90 per
cent of those “loyalty checked” out of their jobs are
Jews and Negroes. This is no mere accident.

Yes, you, Ordinary Citizen No.. 146,000,000, will be
in that court room. You and your rights.

The chief question in the Los . Angeles case, with
all the legal talk boiled out of it, is this: ' '

Will you retain the right, as speciﬁcally provided

’-for ’-in the Constitutio of’ the United" States, to free
‘thought, free speech, free assembly . . . to combine these

in carrying out your responsibilities‘ as a citizen on elec-
tion day and every other day in the calendar in the “pur-
suit of life, liberty and happiness” . . . not to be com-
pelled to ‘be a witness against yourself?

The Los Angeles case will signal either a green light
or a red light to a series of thought control measures al-
ready adopted and to - another series strung out across
the country like a gigantic line of traffic waiting for the
sign to go ahead—or to halt.

'0 On trial in this case will be people ’s thoughts.

0 On trial Will be the‘ Constitutional rights to think
freely, to speak freely, to assemble freely.

-0 On trial will be the freedoms basic to our form of
government, in the exercise of which a free people en-
gage in self-govemment.

‘C On trial will be the Bill of Rights.

‘ -0 On this case will hang one of the main issues of
our times-—the right to entertain ideas which may be

"at variance with ideas held by those in power.
