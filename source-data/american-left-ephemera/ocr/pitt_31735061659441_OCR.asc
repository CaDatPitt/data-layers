Labor-management collaboration for speedup in produc- .
tion was the basic “labor relations" policy of that period.
Company unions thrived, and some A. F. of L. unions -became ’
hardly better. The payoff for this dizzy speedup spree was the
crash that began in October, 1929-. Millions worked themselves ‘
out of jobs, not to work again until armament production.

Unfortunately, there are still some labor leaders who have
neither learned nor forgotten anything since the “booming” 
twenties and “busted” thirties. A. F. of L. President William 
Green, who sang hosannas to the speedup plans of the twenties,
is now singing the same song. all over again. He _advised
A. F. of L. members not to take part in demonstrations against .
the rising cost of living, but to concentrate on higher produc- 
tivity. And the Wall Street Journal and the entire chorus of »  .
Big Business reciprocated with hosannas to “Bill” Green for 
his noble example of ‘labor “statesmanship." V *5 

A resolution of the C. I. O.’s Special Emergency Conference

~ gave a alearcut answer to the speedup suggestion, as follows: V

“The (3.10. repudiates any suggestion that the answer to our 
economic ills lies in the speedup. or in the widespread de- 
terioration of terms and conditions of employment for which 
many employers in American industry are.’ increasingly if L
responsible. A I

“Twice in the past 25 years America suffered a depression as 
a result of the false prophesies of those who offered the Amer— *3‘ 
ican workers a system of speedup and low wages as the cure "
for their economic ills. The acceptance of such a theory at

. this time offers only the promise of a new depression to the 
American people.” 

The problem is not slowness of production. America’s pro- ‘ A
ductivity today makes the 1929 speedup look-like a slowdown. , A
Production advances during the war,~as revealed by the War ‘ 
Production Board, have gone forward as never before, and
the bulk of thechanges apply to peacetime. The problem is
one of raising the purchasing power of 32,000,000 families to
more than barelneeds. . - ~

Then we have heard no end of that “scientiﬁc” sounding
argument of ‘“supply and demand”—that whatever goes up
must come down. This was how -the big business ads soothed
the public while prices skyrocketed.

I t is true that capitalists cannot keep "prices indeﬁnitely at
extortionate levels. But it is also a fact that ‘under capitalism,
it is precisely when we have what. is commonly called “full
production and full employment” that prices are highest.
Prices may drop back here and there becauseiof special condi-
tions in an industry or its market. But a general fall in prices
usually comes together with a condition when employ-
ment drops and factories cl0se..Capitalism demonstrated that
lawvin the twenties and its economic laws are basically the
same today.‘ ' '

[Which Way?

Are the people of America to submit once "more to mo-
nopoly-imperialist plan-s for a whirl of insanity, disaster and
ultimately war, such as we have gone .through since the
twenties? Is it to be another bite at a Harding-Coolidge-
Hoover “back to normalcy” bait? Are Americans again to be
shaken down through high prices and high taxes for mo-
n,opoly’s glory at home and abroad?

Reaction counts on a repeat performance through its
symphony of labor-baiting, Negro—baiting, anti-Semitism and
Red-baiting. It still counts on dividing and confusing the

common people of the country. But, as Karl Marx, founder ‘

of Communism, said nearly a century back, “History repeats
itself‘, once as a tragedy and then as a farce.” »
The labor movement is not the weak A. F. of L. of 3,000,000
members, divided among craft organizations. Some 14,000,000
are in unions today and the pace—setting organization is the

pmore progressive C.I.O., composed mainly of powerful in-

dustrial unions in basic industries. Labor has advanced

_ politically and has learned to show its strength effectively

through movements like the C.I.O.’s PAC. Laws giving labor

‘much protection have replaced the industrial s-py agencies

and strike.breaking outﬁts of the twenties. _
The Negro people have become much more closely inte-
grated with America's struggle for progress, and Negro-white

unity has made great advances. Veterans, to'the disappoint-‘
ment of reaction, are steering towards greater cooperation ,_

with organized labor. Recent years have given evidence of a
' . 11

   
 

   

developing alliance between labor and sections of the farmers
and middle—class groups against the “economic royalists.”

The sixtuati-i-on today could -be very different from the
twenties. The peoples’ unity against the plunder of the trusts
is theonly real answer that must be given.

The People Against the Trus’rs

How does this struggle shape up today? -
1. Labor today is not submissive. The successful strikes, the

millions involved and -the 1oo per cent solidarity that marked.

those struggles, proves it. But the contracts won through those
strikes weire-violated when the government and Congress
allowed the price hold-up. Labor cannot haveany further
conﬁdence in promises of price “roll-backs” or in predictions
that the line would be held “from now on.” Unions have no
recourse but to demand the immediate reopening of wage
clauses in their contracts. L

2. This is a ﬁght of the entire community. The struggle for.

price control has brought out of the ranks of the people
numerous forms of struggle against the monopolies. Buyers
strikes, work stoppagesto demand controls, mass demonstra-

tions, parades and baby carriage caravans through shopping’

districts, neighborhood committees to check on prices, delega-
tions to Congressmen, demonstrations at price-gouging cor-
poraration offices, price committees in unions and shops, are
some of the forms that have become familiar generally.

The OPA struggle brought numerous types of organizations
in a common movement——trade union, veteran, youth, Negro,
professional, church, neighborhood storekeeper, , parent-
teacher. This unity must be developed and extended for the
ﬁght is only getting under way. i »

But a word of caution is in order. This is not a movement

against the neighborhood storekeeper. The ﬁght is aimed "

against the monopolies who’have the real whiphand in our
economy. The struggle should be waged in a manner that
will win the neighborhood store owners.

3. This is a political struggle. Americans have learned more
about their congressmen and national Adminsistrationduring
the weeks of the ﬁght on OPA than ever before. They saw

t 12

 

 

 

Congress in the grip of a ~bi-partisan bloc of Southern poll-
taxers and Northern Republicans. They saw how these

ﬂunkeys of Big Business robbed their constituents of meat, '

milk, butter, bread and everything a pay envelope must buy.
The people have also learned how the new OPA was

'projected as a sham, designed as a sop to the people and as

a brake on the mounting struggle for price control. And they
have received a ﬁne demonstration of the Truman Adminis-
tration’s policy of merely paying lip—service to the needs of
the people. Had, the President fought vigorously for a real
OPA and taken the ﬁght to the people, as Roosevelt dideon
such occasions, the result would have been different.

The President, in signing the bill, even expressed his ﬁrm
belief that it would work; In his October 14 “meat speech” he
surrendered, admitting ﬂatly that blackmail by the trusts
worked. , ‘ " ’ j

4. Labofs role and unity is the key. A united front of the

people goes far beyond labor’s ranks, but organized labor’s .

initiative is of primary importance. Proposals have come from

A many quarters of labor for a joint movement that would give

organized form to. the peoples’ unity against the monopolies.

The C.I.O., A. F. of L. and Railroad Brotherhoods should
agree on such a move and initiate an all-inclusive congressof
all labor unions, veteran, farmer, Negro, consumer, profes-

sional and government employes’ organizations, at which a_

common program on wage, price and tax policy could be
worked out. But such a movement will not be a reality until
A. F. of L. members bring enough pressure upon their top
leaders to break down refusal to work jointly with the C.I.O.

5. Millions are on a starvation level. Persons on social
security, pensions, veterans beneﬁts, soldier allotments, unem-
ployment insurance, public welfare and other forms of ﬁxed
incomes, have no way to meet" the sudden cut except through
legislation. They must be shown that only through joint
action with labor and other groups can they win. n

6. For a real wage mz'nz',mum._ Congress adjourned without
action on the Pepper 65-75 cents an hour minimum wage bill.
Meanwhile, we are still‘on the 40 cents an hour legal mini-
mum. Passage ‘ofthe bill should be one of the immediate
tasks before the new Congress.

SociaIism——+|1e Real Soluﬁownl

The Communist Party urges the above measures as im-
mediate steps to protect the living standards of the workers
and all small-incomed people. Communists are actively en-
gaged in advancing this program and.winning the broadest
possible support for it.

But Communists nevertheless warn that any improvements
under capitalism, be it wage raises or other reforms, will not
be a real and lasting solution. Only socialism, the working
class and the people in command of the industries and re-
sources now controlled by the monopolies, offers a condition
inwhich the great majority of the people could really ad-

vance. America, rich in resources, mostpowerful industrially, i

could turn from creating fabulous proﬁts for the few to
making life beautiful for the many. '
The feature that distinguishes Communists from others
who also ﬁght for improvements under capitalism, is the view
that the road which unites the people and teaches them to
ﬁght the monopolies also leads them towards a stage when
they will challenge capitalism itself. Thus, while Communists
are distinguished for their active part in every struggle, big
or small, they consider it their duty to- point to the limita-
tions in the conditions which workers can achieve under cap-
italism, and to urge the workersto strive for higher goals.
Capitalism offers the average worker no more than the

choice between poverty or a never-ending race with rising"

prices and taxes,and insecure employment and old age. Here
and there one hears ofha worker who worked himself out of
his class. But the great mass“ are doomed, to live in constant
fear of destitution. “Relief” comes periodically when new
wars bring an arms production boom.

Every small-incomed family conﬁrms this fact from its own
experience in the «past 25 years: It was war, unemployment
and starvation; then a few years of phoney prosperity; then

‘another crash and nearly 10 years of mass’ unemployment;

then ﬁve years of war again. Now, as the typical family looks
to the future, it sees only the fearful vision of the past. V

Eric‘ Johnston, former president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, perhaps unintentionally gives an eloquentestimate

.14

   

  

 
  
 
 

  

of w-ha-t the worker can hope for under capitalism. His ar-ticle

~in the New York Times, Feb. 24, 1946, on “Labor’s Stake in

Capitalism” says: 9

“Most men are chancey. The country is cluttered with pin-
ball machines and bingo games and slot machines. T-here is
almost an abnormal absorption in bridge and poker and gin
rummy, and the race tracks count their take in millions.‘

“It begins with Americans as little boys. One of the ﬁrst
games the American boy learns is how to play marbles “for
keeps.” He learns -to pitch pennies and bet on mum-ble-de-peg.
He is a chance-taker from the time he can toddle.

“The capitalistic system is supposed to guarantee a man a
chance to take a chance and shoot for larger gains. Obviously

all people cannot own a business of their own, but this no ,

reason why they should not,have their American right of a

chance to take a chance.”

This is the old office-«boy-to-president yarn ‘adjusted to pre-
sent conditions. Johnston knows that the hundred—to.-one shot

.of yesterday is thousands-to-one in present-day monopoly-

  

.controlle'd capital-ism. He plays on the thrill of winning the
dilﬁcult shot. We are all free to dream of luck at the sweep-
stakes of capitalism, even though we know that almost all
workers are doomed to live in fear of starvation.

The proﬁt system has lost a great deal of ground in recent
years. More and more of this world is losing conﬁdence in
Johnston's race—track. The last war endediw-ith the birth of
the ﬁrst socialist Republic—the Soviet Union. Many more
peoples are turning away from capitalism as a’result of recent
bitter experience. They have seen how monopoly capitalism
gives birth to fascism and all its costly consequences. This is
why most European countries today are banning monopolies
and placing major industries under state control. With this
trend goes a greater role of‘ the working class and t-he develop-
ment of real peoples democracies in those countries. '

American capitalism may appear strongtoday as it sits on
its money—bags and blackmails the world.’ The propagandists
of capitalism point to the economic chart at the moment and
pronounce our economic sy-stem as in the «best of health. But
the Communists say: remember 1929, capitalism was in its
ﬂower when the great crash came. ‘

By GEORGE MORRIS

S0 THE American worker came out of the war rich, with
loads of savings which he is rarin’ to spend for homes, cars,
refrigerators, washing machines, and what not?’

The Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Agricultural

Economics made a study to answer that very question. And

they found that: ' .
Of America’s 46,000,000 family units, 9,300,000 or 20 per

cent, have an income of $19 a week or less; 12,400,000, or 27

per cent, have between $19 and $38.50 a week; 10,300,000,
or’ 22.4 per cent, have from $38.50 to $57.50 a week. 3

A total of 32,000,000 families (70 per cent) are able at best
to purchase only bare necessities at present price levels. A
family unit consists of one or more persons in a family whose

incomes are pooled.

It was further—found that the ﬁrst group had an average A

in spendable savings of only $20 a family; the second group

$230, and the third group $470. But that was the picture in
.1945, the period covered by the study. During most of that

year we ‘were still ,on_ war work and earned overtime rates.
Presumably our workers were still laying away their fabulous
earnings in bonds and bank savings for the dreamed—of post-
war shopping spree. A

What is the story today?

In July 1946, after millions of workers had already won ‘

wage increases, generally 181/,_ cents an hour, the average
weekly take—home in manufacturing (before tax deductions)

was $43.07 according to Bureau o-f Labor Statistics. That is

about $4.50 less than the take—home at'the end of the war.
Obviously, today more than 70 per cent of America’s families

_ are at the bare necessities level.

What else Happened? Even the government’s over-conser-
vative ‘cost of living index places the increase since V-] Day
at over 10 percent. Food prices according to the BLS, soared
31.4 per cent just in the two weeks between the lapse and

3

 

    

renewal of OPA. On July 15, food prices stood at 80 per cent
above the prewar level, and still‘ kept rising.

The rise in the cost of clothing andhouse furnishings was
not far behind. Together with rent those items absorb almost
the entire budget of a wage <\:.«;rr:er’s family. A pay envelope
of $57.50 was regardedas fairly good before the war. Now it
is in the class of marginal living. The $1.08 an hour average
that BLS says workers in.manufacturing earn now, buys what

V 75 cent-s ‘bought in 1941. The same happened to savings.

Need more be said of hidden price increases—~the black
market, deterioration of quality, grade markups, absence of
cheaper goods? Those are not reﬂected in statistics. \

The bulk of the working class has not improved its lot as

a result of the war, and large sections have suffered a decline

in living standards. If many families ate better during war
years, it was.because there was no possibility of spending
money for durable essentials.

Appeasingl fhe Profif Hogs

For some time before Congress permitted OPA to expire,
it was already apparent that the Administration was yielding
to attacks upon price control. Hardly a day passed without
an announcement of a new price increase—always with the
explanation that it was done to encourage greater- produc-

tion. The death—blow to OPA, with the lifting of meat-.

controls by Truman, as the Meat Trust and the G.O.P.-poll
taxers’ coalition demanded, was the logical consequence.
On the other hand, America's basic wage was held down

' by a new stabilization formula. For the war ‘period and six

months after V-] Day, the general basic wage level was not
allowed to climb higher than the “Little Steel” limit of 15
per cent. But by the time the Administration began to apply
its post-"war stabilization policyeat the end of 1945, the cost
of living index showed a rise of about 33 per cent over
January, 1941. The 181/2 cent raises (15 to 18 per cent) were
accepted by labor as a belated “balancing” of wages and prices,
on the government’s assurance that the wage-price line would
be held ‘from then on.

T That contract was not kept. Wage raises were no sooner won V

4

 

 

than OPA opened the price ‘valve to keep up the high proﬁt ‘

level. Neither OPA nor business were satisﬁedwith the con-

‘tribution the bipartisan reactionary bloc in Congress made

to the maintenance of high proﬁts through big slashes in
corporation taxes._ ,
Proﬁtsrose from an annual average of $5.3 billions during"

the 1936-39 years to aniaverage of $22.7 billions a year in the

1942-45 period. In the latter period, even after payment of
the high _war taxes, corporations cleared an average of ten.

' billions a year—'the level which OPA has been helping them

to keep. V ‘

The Oﬁice of Price Administration. has, in eﬁcct, become
the Oﬁice of Price Advancement.

' Price-Fixing for the Trusfs

The policy of appeasing reaction only whetted the appetite
of those who sought to cripple price control. They swung out
to exploit fully the discredit OPA brought upon itself, to kill
it altogether. Newspapers and airwaves were clogged with:
clever ads promising a ﬂood of goods on the market if the
“free play’’ of prices were allowed. They played upon public
dissatisfaction because of scarcities and. high prices, and

' blamed it all on OPA.

The trust lobbies behind this campaign of propaganda

sought to give an impression that the “people” were in

revolt against OPA. The majority in Congress, consisting of
Southern polltaxers and most Republicans, lined up with the

trust lobbies. Back home pleas of the people were ignored. /

Opinion polls showing that'85 per cent of the people wanted.
price control were ignored. OPA was allowed to die on June
30. Gates were opened to a breathtaking spree of price in-
creases. “Free enterprise” was ﬂowering out in all its glory.

The one restraining factor was the rising temper of the C

‘people, especially the labormovernent.‘ Continued pressure,

demonstrations and bu ers strikes roved to the reactionaries
Y_ P

that they overplayed their hand. They retreated and passed a

new OPA. But what kind of an OPA? The extended OPA is _

only a shadow of its past. It simply puts a legal stamp upon
the" wholesale plundering of the public's pocketbook. ’

5 _

  

That was the price the people paid -for having 21 Congress
majority of tools of the big corporation lobbies, an Administra-

 

tion that only pays lip service to the Roosevelt policies but _

yields to the —“economic royalists” at every step, and for per-
mitting the continued division in labor’s ranks and political
disunit amon the common o le as a whole.

. Y 8 P5 P

‘As the real meaning of the new OPA unfolded, it revealed V

itself as a cruel fraud upon the people. Statements ‘about
price roll-backs to June 30 levels and announcements of dire
threats to ceiling violators, only draw bitter sarcasm from the
people. Further price increases is all that emanated from the
new OPA. And they have been coming amidst joyous stories
from Wall Street that proﬁts for the ﬁrst half of 1946 have
been close to the proﬁt level of the ﬁrst six months of 1945.

Here are a few samples to indicate the trend of the new
OPA's start:

On July 26, the day after the President‘ signed the bill,
OPA slapped a ten per cent raiseon rubber’ footwear; ﬁve
cents on rubber heels; six to eight cents a ton on coal, and a
whole string of raises on building materials, kitchenware,
fresh fruits and vegetables, common tools and dishes. Controls
were lifted entirely from hundreds of items. ’ _

On the following -day raises were ordered for another long
list of manufactured products. - ’

Men’s shirts, pajamas, shorts, and.boys’ shirt manufacturers
were favored with an 1 1 per cent raise on July 28.

On August 2, one cent was raised on a two-pound loaf of
bread; two cents on a half pound of macaroni; one to three
cents on a package of breakfast foods; one to two cents on
packages of corn meal and hominy grits, and 13 cents on a
hundred pounds of ﬂour. _ ‘ °

On August 5, carded yarn textiles were upped 16 per cent.

On August 12 another 7.3 per cent was slapped on the fast
disappearing, new, shiny car—the third raise in a row.

On August 13 came a staggering blow with a 10 to 13
cents raise on‘ one pound of coffee, and new hikes were
announced on clothing.

August 15 was a great day for manufacturers of radios,
electrical appliances, heaters, stoves, toasters, vacuum cleaners,

6

 

  

irons, washing machines, coffee‘-makers, shavers, photographic
equipment, typewriters, clocks, watches, and what not—-a 3
to 12 per cent Jump.

So it went on and on and on. The housewife had only to
step into a store to do her morning’s shopping to be sprung
with her daily new surprise.

The new OPA had in eﬁect becomea price-ﬁxing agency

much as the trusts and industry associations ﬁx prices. Only .

OPA did it on a far more extensive scale than was ever
possible under the trusts. The original objective of ﬁxing
prices in the interest of the consumer was forgotten.

The Real Enemies-—1'he Monopolies

The real whiphand in this conspiracy to syphon off the

I purchasing power and savings of the people, is wielded by a

handful of ‘powerful monopolies. They control the switch that
gives the “go” and “stop" signal for every important assembly
line in the land. They have their hands on the key raw
materials, transportation, marketing channels, banks, and can
snuff out any “free enterpriser” who does not fully ,“con-form.”

They dictate the price and proﬁt margin for the neighbor- .

hood store, be it for a toothpick, awashing machine, a pound
of beef or a bottle of milk. The neighborhood storekeeper has
a status little different than that of a chain-store manager.

During the war, the monopolies grabbed the hog’s share of
war orders. It is well to remember that even after Pearl Harbor
they were still on a sitdown against the government because
they wanted a proﬁt guarantee and postwar tax kickbacks
before they would earnestly get on wi-th war production.

When the war ended they began another sitdown——.for an
end of pricecontrol, a continued freeze upon wages and

legislation to hamstring labor before they would supply the’

hungry market. This blackmail policy was put forward in the

V name of “free enterprise.” But back of this deceitful ‘propa-

ganda is the basic concept of capitalism: production only for
profit. Better to make a higher proﬁt on a million cars than
to sell two million cars at a lower proﬁt. The meat trust

7

 

  

  

proﬁt yield on less meat keeps rising. ,
Big Business is now having a belly laugh at the cruel joke
it pulled upon the people. After the biggest price jumps had
already taken place, and with OPA blessing, Civilian Produc-
tion Administrator John D. Small informed the public that
production reached a near capacity level in-]uly—the very
July when the market went crazy with price increases. Small
reported that scarce items like nylon hosiery, men's shirts. and
suits reached an all-time high. 0
'The Department of Commerce announced that in that
same ‘July, manufacturing goods in warehouses increased by
$600,000,000 in value to the all-time staggering high of
$18,ooo,ooo,oo0! Wholesale and retail stocks brought the total
inventory to $3o,0oo,oo0,00o! V
That was the July when the newspapers carried National

‘ ‘ Association of Manufacturers ads telling the public that goods

are scarce‘ and production lags because prices aren’t high
enough. Now the public knows that the NAM lied. It was the
other way around. Prices were climbing and goods were scarce
because industry. withheld its wares from the market and
stored them for still higher prices and proﬁts. This is the real
cause of inflation—n0t wage increases.

There are people in the ranks of business who express a
fear that events are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
The magazine United States News, of July 26, examining the
very ﬁgures on incomes and savings cited atvthe opening of
this pamphlet, worries because sharp price rises could quickly
send most American families out of the market for all but
necessities. A rise in food and clothing and rents might snuff
ou-t the present selling boom for automobiles, refrigerators,

radios and washing machines sooner than most persons think. .

The magazine views only the seven per cent (3,400,000) of
America’s families with incomes above $5,000 ($96 a week)
as‘. a “steady market” for most consumer goods. Even the ten
million families (21 per cent) with incomes of $57.50 to $96
a week, are not considered by the United States News as a
reliable market for other than necessities.

The market nightmare and fear of the future has caused a
struggle in the lifeof America’s homes: to hold on to depre-
8

doesn’-t worry‘ about the decline of meat consumption if the

 

 

 

ciating dollars lest weekly pay envelopes run short for ‘daily ,

needs, or to ‘unload them for much desired durable goods that

lmay rise in price but which could be dispensed with.-Either

decision seems like a risk, especially for the 70 per cent whose

income is under $57.50.

Covering Up Hie Robbery

Like racketeers who try to cover their tracks, monopoly
propagandists have released a wave of poison to divert the

‘ minds of the people from the real facts on the great shake-

down of 1945-46. l

Theyipoint a ﬁnger at the unions, charging that recent wage
increases are responsible. This has always been the “big lie”
of the employers. Wage demands, as a general rule, always
come after dollars depreciate in purchasing power. The 181/2
cent raises only partly caught up with the wartime loss in real
wages. But business, withthe government’s blessing, started
another round» of price raises immediately to take back the
wage raises. » .

The trusts also-have a companion cry——speedup of produc-
tion. Their line of argument runs like this: products are scarce
because there isn’t enough to go around. So we must have
greater productivity of labor. If labor costs go down, the lower
pay envelope could buy more. But the trouble is that workers
are t.oo slow and lazy. .

This line is artfully peddled, especially for the ears of the
unorganized office and government workers, people on pen-

ysions, social security, veterans ‘beneﬁts, soldier allotments,

public welfare and other forms of ﬁxed incomes. The argu-
ment is cleverly designed to arouse op-position against organ—
