BOARD CHARTS ACTION PR OGRA  

Consolidation Stressed
As Union's Main Task

DENVER——Consolidation of the tremendous victory
scored by the membership in recent strike and contract
struggles was the main task projected for the union by
the International Executive Board at its meeting here

March 15-24.

The officers and Board
members, reviewing the un-
ion’s work over the last six
months and problems ahead,
noted the enhancement of
Mine-Mill prestige in the com-
munities and throughout the
labor movement as a result
of the successful strike battle,
and charted an action pro-
gram outlining operations for
the immediate future.

Among the top perspectives
for coming months laid down
by the Board are: placing the
union back on a’ sound finan-
cial basis after the heavy in-
roads .made on its funds by
the six-months’ strike; inten-
sification of legislative and
political action; new organiza-
tion and expansion of the
union’s m e in b e r s h i p within
the Mine-Mill jurisdiction;
broadening the support al-
ready achieved from other
unions for defense of Mine-
Mill‘ leaders under legal at-
tack; and development of staff
and local leadership, through
educational classes and area‘
conferences.

Acting under its authority
voted by last year's referen-
dum, the Board called for a
$5 emergency assessment to
be levied for the month of
June as a means of paying off
the loans and debts incurred
during the course of the

strike.
9; >(: 1:

‘ON THE BASIS of surveys
reported from the districts,
the Board rnjappecl a policy of
concentrating new organiza-
tional c a m p ai g n s wherever
possible in particular areas to
further strengthen the union’s
bargaining position.

Considerable time of the
Board's session was devoted

to a detailed analysis of con-
ditions in the industry. In-

;Numerous'. Grounds C ifeds for
Reversal of T—H Convictions

DENVER———“Numerous” reversible errors will be cited by defense counsel in ap-
pealing the case of nine present and past Mine-Mill leaders sentenced March 14 on
charges of conspiracy to defraud the governmentby violating the Taft-Hartley act.

Telford Taylor, who will head the fight for reversal in the higher courts, said: “I

do not recall any case over the course of my le

appeal were so numerous.”

A statement issued by
Mine-Mill President Jolm Clark
termed the convictions “un-
justified by the law or the
facts” and expressed confi-
dence that “the verdict will be
reversed by the higher courts.”

Notice of appeal was an-
nounced immediately after
trial Judge Alfred A. Arraj
denied motions argued by Tay-
lor for dismissal of the case,

WASHINGTON, D. C.—~Fur- .

ther delay on passage of civil
rights legislation appeared
likely at month's end when the
Senate Judiciary Committee
March 29 sent the compromise
House-passed bill back to the
Senate after writing major
modifications intoit.

One major change would
provide criminal penalties for
interfering by force or threat-s
with -court orders for school
desegregation. Another would
permit state officials-to sit-in

torneys are Mine-Mill general
counsel Nathan Witt and

SENTENCED to three years

er; Al Skinner, Raymond Den-
nis and'Chase Powers, board
members; Harold Sanderson
and Charles Wilson, staff

members, and M. E. Travis,
former secretary-treasurer who
is no longer with the union.
Jess Van Camp. staff member,
and James Durkin, former
staff member no longer with

tences of 18 months and $1,500

Convention
Date Set

DENVER — Mine-Mill's
regular 1960 Internation-
al convention, postponed
because of the strike,
will be held beginning
Aug. 29 at the Cosmo-
politan Hotel in Denver.

The Executive Board,
at its meeting here last
month, set the‘ date and
place as the most suit-
able to assure the great-
est possible representa-
tion by all locals. It also-
voted to streamline con-
vention proceedings into
a hard-working business
meeting with a minimum
of speakers.

An official convention
call will be mailed to all
locals later this month. g

cluded in the extended discus-
sion was a report by the Re-
search department on metals
employ-
ment, status of union organi-
zation, and the jobs outlook
in coming months. »

In this regard the union
leaders examined a number of
minerals bills now before con-
gress and adopted recommen-
dations for the industry along
with its general program of
legislative activity on national
issues of concern to all labor.
(See separate story on page
1.) ‘

CONFIDENCE that the de-

fendants in the Taft-Hartley
conspiracy case will be vindi-
cated by reversal of their con-
victions in the higher courts
was expressed by the Board in
a statement issued following a
report on the case by defense
attorneys Telford Taylor, Na-
than Witt and George Francis.
(See page 4.) Means of furth-
er building up the Defense
Fund through outside support
from other unions and or-
ganizations was also planned.

A summary by Witt of pro-
visions of the Landrum-Griffin
act as they affect Mine-Mill
and the individual locals was
ordered printed in this issue
of the Mine-Mill Union (see
page 11). A memorandum
containing the same informa-
tion is being scnt to all locals
as well.

Another decision of the;

Board called for concentrated
educational activities on an
area basis, including A leader--
ship schools, to broaden and

further develop the function-4

ing of local officers a 5 well as
staff members.

IN OTHER ACTIONS, the I

ings b e f o r e court-appointed
referees.

If the Senate approves the
House-passed version as is, the
bill would go directly to the
President for signing. Changes
in‘ the bill, however, would
send it back to the House
where the Rules Committee
would have another chance
to bottle it up.

Approval of the compromise
rights bill by the House March
24.had at first been expected
to bring final agreement on

legislation geared primarily to
voting rights before Easter.

THE MAIN FEATURE of
the House-passed .rights bill is
the Administration proposal
calling for the establishment
of Federal voting referees au-
thorized to register Negroes
where state officials will not
do so. Other major provisions
provide Federal penalties for:

court orders in school integra-
tion cases.

THE MINE-Mll.L UNION

Superior Women

Form Auxiliary

Wives and daughters of
Mine-Mill Local 938 members
in Superior, Ariz., have re-
quested and received authori-
zation from President John
Clark to establish a local
Ladies Auxiliary. Some 92
women, active in the local’s
recent strike and election cam-
paign, were initially involved
in organization of the group.
Temporary officers are Mrs.
Joseph Pursley, chairman, and
Miss Josie Sanchez, secretary.
President Clark "was scheduled
to install the new officers of
both the local and auxiliary at
a combined ,membership meet-
ing last month.

Butte Miner Files
Action on Silicosis

Butte miner Frank Parsons
filed suit March 14 in District

court against the Anaconda,

company, asking‘ judgment for
$75,000 in the action which ‘al-
leges he contracted silicosis
while employed at the. com-
pany’s underground B u t t e
mines from 1950 to 1959.

Parsons charges the com-
pany was negligent in that it

failed to provide adequate ven-

tilation or devices to remove
harmful dusts, failed to warn
him of the dangers of his em-
ployment, did not provide him
with adequate breathing de-
vices or respirators, did not
allow sufficient time to elapse
after underground blasting be-
fore ordering him back to
work, represented the work-
ing conditions as safe when in
fact they were not safe, and
iabitually fired explosive shots
in the mines during times
when Parsons and other em-
ployees were eating their
lunches.

As a result, Parsons says in
his suit, by inhalation and ab-
sorption of harmful dusts he
has contracted “emphycema,
fibrosis, silicosis and silica-tu-
berculosis," impairing his abil-
ity to resist disease and to
work, causing him to lose
earnings of $140 per week and
to suffer chest, back and lung
pains, and impairing the func-
tions of his heart.

Joe DeFreitas, George Rome

the committee which planned
the event.

Chicago Foundry
Workers on Strike

Some 110 workers at the Chi-
cago Foundry plant struck
March 4 for a better _contract
than the one which expired
last October 9. They make up

a unit of Chicago Amalga-

mated Local‘758 which holds
a number of contracts’ in the
area. The shutdown came after
countless negotiating meetings
both with and without Federal
conciliation where .the com-
pany‘ refused to makean ac-
ceptable offer on wage and
other demands. Another at-
tempt to reach agreement was
scheduled for a meeting on
March 23.

Apex Unit Forms
New Credit Union

Members of Amalgamated

Locals Consult on
AZ Pension Talks

Mine-Mill Locals 82 and 515
at American Zinc properties in
East St. Louis, Ill., and Metal-
line Falls, Wash., are working
as closely as possible in pen-

sion negotiations with locals

of other unions at AZ proper-
ties in Dumas, Texas, Mascot,
Tenn., Hillsboro and Monsan-
to, Ill., and Columbus, Ohio.

A common desire of the lo-
cals is company-wide, bargain-
ing on pensions which the
company is refusing, even to
the point of not allowing visit-
ing ‘committees to sit in on
any specific local talks. Thus
far, AZ has met individually-
with East St. Louis, Hillsboro
and Monsanto. A joint meet-
ing was held last month with
Mascot and Columbus, both of
which locals are in the Chem-

DENVER —— Former Mine.-
Mill vice president Orville Lar-
son is now on‘ the payroll of
the: Steelworkers union to

wprk _in the non-‘ferrous metals ,

jurisdiction of . -Mine-‘Mill, t it

was disclosed-last month.
Larson submitted his ..resi'g-

nation last November in the

middle of the biggest strike’

ever A‘ conducted by Mine-Mill,
announcing he was quitting ef-
fective January -1.

His higher-paying job with
the. Steel union, which has
spent 12 years ‘and millions of
dollars’ trying to muscle its
way into the non-ferrous metals
field, -pfaces him in the ranks
of those whowould divide the
workers _-in this. "industry.

‘*,=’ It will be recalled’ by many

that this is not the first -time
that a leader of Mine-Mill has
deserted the union for selfish
and personal gain. .

The Mine-Mill -membership -~

however, has learned from
years of experience how -to
deal with this type of “union
leader.”

All honest ‘ trade unionists
cannot but condemn Larson’_s
desertion and decision to work
for the enemies of -Mine-Mill.

THIS COLUMN is about money.

Our recent International Executive

problems facing our membership. in the

ganization to automation.
This issue of the UNION
reports on many of them.

As Secretary - Treasurer
of the Union, it becomes my
responsibility to deal with -
one of the most important
problems discussed by the
Board—money. Our strike
proved that our Union is '
fully capable of defending
the interests of its me1nber-
ship. We came out of the
strike with contracts which Dichter‘
in many instances are superior to those nego-
tiated by any lmion during the past year.

During the strike we faced enormous Wel-
fare problems. We were able to meet "them with
the assistance of our working and ‘Canadian

If we want money‘ available when we need

of it going towards the strike. fund. ~

A SIDE‘ from the strike fund, our Union
faces increasing costs for its normal op-

' . erations. This is a problem common to the en-

tire trade union movement. Over the past year
or -two, the Board hastried to meet these in-
‘creased costs by economy measures, but they

have proved insufficient. Costs go up quicker.

than we can economize.

For example, Landrum-Griffin  new‘.

and unanticipated-financial b1u'dens on ‘the In-

ternational and Local Unions. Today, a strike,

not only involves the problems of assisting our
membership, but of fighting off a variety, of
damage suits, all of themcostly. _

Organizational campaigns, no matter how
small, now involve heavy investments. The day
when you passed out a few leaflets and cards
and went in and won an election are over. In
addition, the day-to-day operations of the Union
——wages of staff and office personnel, station-
ery, servicing costs—are all going up.

ANY of our Local Unions face the same

financial problems. It’s time we tackled -
-. them. Every majoiﬁunion has been forced to -do
so-—and in this respect we are in no different V

a liveabledues st"-ructure——both for the Locals

~ and the International. ~ -

-‘Our Boardrealizes that money alone never
made a union. ‘But, with a: meager treasury, it
is difficult for even the best of unions to oper-
ate efficiently. ‘

The programdeveloped by the Board at its
recent meeting points the way to following-up
our strike victory with activities calculated to
further benefit our members’ and their fami-
lies. But every form of activity we embark
upon will take some money. The sooner we
face up to the problem of money the sooner
we will be able to move on all these activities.

Matter of Emphasis

get proposal asked Congress to appropriate’

$8,100,000 mostly for the new Bureau of Labor-
Management Reports to police enforcement
of the Landrum-Griffin act. On the other hand,
the administration asked only $3,049,000 for
the Federal Trade Commission to protect the

Indictment of Teamsters

DEN V ER—-Indictment of six
Teamster Union officials for
alleged violation of ATaft-I-Iart-
l.ey provisions concerning un-
ion political contributions was
denounced last month by
Mine-Mill's Executive Board

as “the latest move in along ‘

campaign of harassment aimed
not only at the Teamsters Un-
ion, but at the entire ‘labor
movement.” A
' "The ominous character of
the government’s action,’"A the
Board statement added, “is” un-
derscored by the fact that four
of the six named were addi-
tionally charged with, conspir-
acy.” " , '
The statement pointed_ out
that leaders of the -AFL-CIO

Textile Workers, ‘the Ladies ,

Garment Workers and other

' unions i as well as Mine-Mill

-have been indicted in recent
years for conspiracy to violate -

various sections of the T-H
act. Increasing use of this
half - century .- old conspiracy
weapon as an anti-labor device
is" a threat to the entire labor,

imovement, the Board said.

“We unqualifiedly condemn
this latest attempt to weaken
labor in one of the opening,
shots of the 1960 election cam-.
paign,” the Board statement
said. “The political nature of

the Teamster officials’ indict- .

ment is obvious from its 
ing, from the fact that some

of the alleged offenses oc- ‘

curred nearly four years ago,
and from its consistency with.

the pattern of the goverAn- .

ment’s to undermine" the

strength and effectiveness of I

Meat Union
Asks Aid In
Long Strike

DENVER —- President
Clark last month called
the attention of all South-
west locals to the con-
tinuing strike by the
-Amalgamated Meat Cut-
. ters & Butcher Workmen
against the Peyton Pack-
ing company in‘ El Paso.

In a life - and - death

struggle against that
company for a year, the

 

Meat Cutters are asking
all union members not
~ to buy Peyton products
produced with strike-
breakers, Clark wrote 10-
- cals in Texas, Arizona
and New Mexico where
the products are sold.
Asking Mine-Mill to pub-
licize their strike, the
Meat union points out
that Peyton products can
: be identified by the
brand name “Del Norte”
on packaged products
like bacon, sausage, Wein-
ers, lard and other items.
“U. S. Inspection No.
126” identified Peyton
fresh meat". If the inspec-
tion number is 126 on
meat in a particular mar-
ket, it is a Peyton prod-
uct, the AMC&BW says;
and if there is no num-
ber, chances are it is a
scab product with the
number destroyed.
Clark recalled that the
Amalgamated Meat Cut-
ters & Butcher Work-
men’s union was very
helpful to Mine-Mill dur-
ing the recent copper
strike.

fact several minor. improve-
ments were ‘made over the
years.

However, w h e 11 Canadian-

National Vice-President Mur-
phy entered the Falconhridge
negotiations in 1959 he pointed
out both to the bargaining
committee and to the company
that in his opinion vastly im-
proved conditions could be ob-
tained without increasing the
cost. _ . ’
Brother Murphy, together
with other Canadian national
officers, had at that time just
concluded negotiations, with
the Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Company providing
for supplementary retirement
benefits which involved an ex-
amination of the benefits to
be obtained from all the insur-
ance companies who carry

_ pension plans. V

THE COMPANY at first re-
jected any such suggestion
but, after investigation, ad-
mitted that additional benefits
could be obtained without in-
creasing cost and a joint com-
mittee was set up to investi-
gate the possibility. Research
director Lukin Robinson was
assigned to work with this
committee and the company
obtained the services of Co-
burn and Robertson who are
pension consultants.

This committee spent
months gathering statistical
material and after in an y
lengthy meetings arrived at a
unanimous decision ‘-to recom-
mend that the pension plan
which had been carried by the
Excelsior Life Insurance Com-
pany (combined with govern-
ment annuities) go to the
Standard Life of Edinburgh.
As a result of the recom-
mendation of the committee to
the membership benefits rang-
ing from 13% to 93% will be

   

o b t n i n e a for Falconbridge

members of the pension plan.’
The membership ‘ meetings _ 
accepted the recommendations '

of the pension committee al-
most unanimously. Each indi-
vidual member will, however,
have the opportunity to decide
very soon on the basis of an
exact comparison ‘of what the
new planwill mean for him
over the old "as to whether or
not he wishes to ; make _ the
change;
it 3!! lit

EVEN THOUGH the bene-
fits to the older members are
not as substantial because of
the shorter -length of time
that they will be in the new
plan, they are still so much
over what is now in effect that
thecommittee expects that the
change will be accepted by al-
most all members in the plan.

The plan will continue all.

the present benefits and op-
tions including the right to
insure benefits and in many
instances on an improved
basis.

THE PRESIDENT, it is
claimed, rejected any_ form. of
governmental action to provide
medical care for the Nation’s
elderly personson the ground
such a step represented‘ .“so-
cialized medicine.” This argu-
ment. is‘ the battle’-cry of the
American Medical Association,
now waging an all-out =cam-
paign against the . Forand bill.

‘ While the Ways and Means
Committee sought to reachits
own conclusion, ' evidence of
mounting public support for
favorable action on a national
medical care program was ac-
cumulating in Congressional
offices. V " '

V Western Congressmen,‘ espe-
cially from metropolitan areas,
report a heavy volume of mail
favorable to the Forand bill.
Opponents, mostly doctors sup-
porting the AMA policy, are
reported as in the minority.

ACROSS the country, Sen.
Jacob Javits of New York
notes that mail concerned with
the Forand bill has doubled in
the last four weeks. It now
outranks all other issues, he
said, with the “for”letters run-
ning 2 to 1 over the “noes.”

Another sampling is report-
ed in the Congressional Record
by Rep. Frances Bolton, who
comes from a conservative Re-

With Congressional actioni

now focused on voting rights,
doubts are arising over the
effectiveness of the r e f e r e e

phrey, saying that an “admin-
istrative procedure” was need-
od, had this comment on the
plan headed for adoption:

-“I have grave reservations-.,
as to the possibilities of regis- 
tering large numbers -of Ne-
groes through court-appointed
referees as the Administration
recommends. Our ‘F e d e r a 1
courts are not. set - up or ‘
equipped to do such a job.”

From the Deep South, as ‘re-‘
ported in the New York Times,
came a much sharper estimate.
“L e a cl e r s of both races” in
Baker County, Georgia, the
Times dispatch noted, “fore-
saw no change in the situation,
no matter what Congress did.”

elections are considered “white ‘

The main. reason cited as to

. the ineffectiveness of new leg-

islation is’ “fear of the eco-

nomic and physical reprisals '

that might be the lot of any I
' Negro who sought to register.”

“I don’t want; my t h r o a t

- cut,” a Negro is quoted as say-

ing in explaining why he
wouldn’t try» to register even
if a Federal voting law is en-
acted. » ' .

As to the sentiment .of
“white folks,”
quoted an overseer as stating:
“It doesn’t make any differ-
ence what Congress and the
Supreme Court say the law is.
It won’t make a damn in
Baker County, not during this

 What You Should Know About
  Provisions of New Labor Ad

I , the election of union officersf

. .._

By NATHAN WITT
Mine-Mill General Counsel

Although the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Landrum-
, Griffin) is a fairly -lengthy statute,‘ there are actually only a few provisions which di-
rectly_;concern Mine-Mill. This is, in part, a tribute to the fact that Mine-Mill’s proce-

dures, are already so democratic and so careful of the rights of the membership that

many of the provisions in Landrum-Griffin do not affect; Mine-Mill at all.

For.‘ example, Title I of

tLa'n'drum- Griffin-‘-'-the Bill :

of{,Rights for union. members,
about. which there has been
so much ba11yhoo—’-contains
only ;.01'1e Section which really
affects _Mine-Mill. This is the
provision requiring, 'a secret

ballot __for the raising of dues,‘
' which is dealt with below.

Even? this change does not at-

fect fithe International Union,

whose Constitution a l r e a d y
requires. a referendum, but
affects only the local unions.
Another example is Title IV
which contains the provisions
which purport to assure fair
and democratic procedures in

Here also, as will be ‘pointed

- out below, there is only one re-

quirement which affects Mine-
Mill and in this case also, only
the local unions are affected
and not the International Un-
ion.

A third example is all of
Title III, which relates to
trusteeships which interna-
tional unions may establish
over local unions. Mine-Mill
does not engage in _this prac-
tice, so this entire Title has
and -can have no effect on
Mine-Mill.

. I21 HI ‘ll .

THE OTHER principal rea-
son why much of Landrum-
Griffin does not affect Mine-
Mill is that Title VII, which
contains amendments to Taft-
Hartley, contains provisions
aimed principally at some
craft unions. These relate to
secondary boycotts, so-called
“hot, cargo” contracts, recog-
nition picketing, etc.

Except in strike situations,

 when Mine-Mill may be affect-

ed in regard to secondary boy-
(involving sub-contrac-
tors, railroads, etc.), these pro-
visions. have no day-to-day ef-
fect. on _Mine-Mill.

It is, therefore, necessary

A ‘for, us to deal only with the

few matters in Landrum-Grif-
fin which do concern Mine-

‘ e . Mill as a practical, matter.

Most ‘of these were covered’ in
-the. memorandum I prepared

if . last Fall, shortly after Land-

1. rum-Griffin became effective,
but if the following matters

A’ are taken ‘care of along the

 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

lines suggested, it will be un-

 : necessary to refer back to that-
‘  -V .. memorandum.

FILING OF REPORTS —

A. Every local and international
Htunion must file two reports

” With the Secretary of Labor.
‘ .1. One report is a report on

(Sr_e_c.:20l.;"(a)l). This report was
‘re;-_on December 13-, 1959, on
o,rms.~._supplied by the Secre-
or Labor. Once this ini-

the -' union’s procedures, , etc.~

tial report has been filed, it ’

does not have to be filed again,
but subsequent changes in any
of the matters covered in the
report must be reported when

the union filesaits financial re-

port, dealt with next.

' 2. The other report, also on -
forms supplied by the Secre- 

tary of Labor, is a report of
the unio_n’s financial condition
and financial? operations (Sec.
201(b)). This lceport must be
filed annually, within 90 days
after the end of the union’s
fiscal year.

3. With the ‘filing of the ini-

tial report on December " 13, ,
“1959, the union will be on the

mailing list of the Bureau of
Labor Management Reports of

» the Department‘ of Labor and ,
will automatically receive the ’

forms for filing,‘ of the annual

financial reports. If any local“

union has or has had any prob-
lem about filing or obtaining
the necessary _ forms, advice
should be sought from the In-
ternational Union.

4. The records on which the
reports are based must be pre-
served for at least 5 years.

5. These two reports are in
general similar to those which
were required under Sections
9(f) and (g) of Taft-Hartley.
Those sections are repealed by
Landrum-Griffin. However, as
pointed out above, the initial
report on the union’s proced-
ures need not be refiled an-
nually, as was true under
Taft-Hartley. ,

' ' BONDING—iAllloca1 unions

have already been advised of

the arrangements which ‘the ;

International Union has made
for the bonding of officers;
staff, and other personnel, in
compliance ~_With__, the require-
ments of Landrum - Griffin

_(Sec. 502(a)). _

It |l¢ Ill

DUES —— Local union dues
and initiation fees may be in-
creased and assessments may
be levied only by secret ballot
of the membership (Sec. 101
(a) (3)). The secret ballot may
be at a membership meeting
or by referendum, but if at a
membership meeting, “reason-
able notice” must be given.

There has not yet been an
official interpretation as to
what constitutes “reasonable
notice.” As much notice should
be given as possible, but no-
tice at the prior meeting
should be sufficient.

Landrum-Griffin does not
deal in any way with the
amount of dues, etc. This is

-left to the -union’s own consti-
-tution or by-laws.  -
1 ELECTION OF OFFICERS
 —-—T,he‘ . only ‘practical require-

\

ment of Landrum-Griffin which
affects Mine-Mill local -unions
insofar as the election of of-
ficers is concerned is the re-
quirement that. at least 15- days
notice of the election of offi-
cers must be .mailed to ‘each
member at his last known

-home address.‘ (See. 401 (e)).

Ballots and records pertain-
ing to elections must be pre-
served for one year.

AMENDMENT of the Con-
stitution of the International
Union and of Local Union By-
laws—As suggested -in - my
earlier memorandum on Land-
rum-Griffin1_.'(p. 4), all local
union by-laws sh o'uld be
amended to add this‘ provision:

“Insofar ‘as these by-laws
are inconsistent with the pro-
visions of Titles I and IV of

‘ the Labor-Manage‘_ment-‘Report

ing and Disclosure Act of 1959,
the provisions of said Act shall
govern.”

Local unions which do not
have their own by-laws and
which therefore operate under
those appended to the Consti-
tution of the International Un-
ion, do not need to do any-
thing in this respect because
the by-laws appended to the
Constitution we r e amended
along these lines by action of
the International‘ Executive
Board on October 23, 1959.
(This appears on page 27 of
the mimeographed copies of
the Constitution which were
recently distributed.)

Insofar as the International
Union itself is‘. concerned, its

-Constitution was amended by

a resolution of the Executive
Board on March 19, 1960, which
added Article 27, providing
that Title IV of Landrum-Grit

fin, dealing with election of

officers, shall be applicable.

These changes in. local un-
ion by-laws and in the. Consti-
tution are all that are neces-
sary in order to achieve com-
pliance with Landrum-Griffin
in these respects.

a tremendous jump in the productivity of its workers. In 1949,
only 13.1 tons of ore per man-shift, on the average, were pro-
duced. By 1957, Braden’s employees were producing 31.0 tons
per man-shift. In the short span of eight years, output per
man-shlft increased by 136 percent. Wages went up over this
period too, but inflation increased the price level more than ten

times from 1949 to 1956, so that the purchasing power of the.
miners pay envelope was actually less, by 1956 than it was

in 1949. A

At the exchange rate in effect in 1956, Chilean copper
miners pay per day was worth less than two dollars in American,

I money. The result has; been to deny to Braden’s. Workers any
share at all in the gains resulting from their increased pro- ~

ductivity. Data on wages and inflation are as reported by the

UN International_Labor Office. This agency has discontinued .,
publication of Chilean copper miners wage rates for the years”"> >
since 1956. In recent years, however, the government of Chile, .

as part of its “stabilization” program, has held a lid over wages,
so that purchasing power has continued to shrink.

BUNKER HILL is feeling the results of higher prices and .

increased sales of lead and zinc. In the last three months of
1959, the company earned a net profit of half a million dollars,
after payment of taxes and set-aside of all the law allows for
depreciation and depletion. This is the best three months, profit-
vvise, the company has had since early 1957. With even higher
ZIIIC prices in effect since early last January, the company
should show even better results over the January-March quar-
ter of 1960. ’ .

TINTIC DISTRICT in Utah is in the news with release of
reports last month by Kennecott Copper Corporation and Chief
Consolidated Mining Company. Kennecott, through its sub-
sidiary, Bear Creek Mining Company, and Chief Consolidated
are associated in an exploration project in the district. Ken-
necott reports only “the discovery of a commercial ore body of
moderate tonnage containing lead, zinc, silver and some gold.”

Chief Consolidated’s report is more enthusiastic, says one
ore area alone may run “well over two million tons” and “could
develop into a real bonanza.” It mentions one hole yielding
samples grading nine ounces‘ of silver, 33 percent lead and 17.9‘
percent -r-zinc. Kennecott, as operator of the project, has an-
nounced that a decision will be made shortly on whether -to

IN ADDITION to these
minimum immediate objec-
tives, the Board program also
called for pressures for repeal
of the Kennedy-Landrum-Grif-
fin law, continuation of the
fight to prevent passage of
legislation aimed at overturn-
ing Supreme Court ‘decisions
or to further curb civil liber-
ties, and a guard against any
attempt to push through in-
dustrial screening or passport
regulatory measures.

Stressed, too, was the over-
riding issue of peace, and the

support of congressional lib-'

erals who are‘ taking a. stand
for an affirmative policy of
the government to end the
cold war.

ON THE INDUSTRY pro-
gram, the Mine-Mill leaders
adopted a statement which de-
claredz

“The current Tariff Com-
mission investigation of the
domestic lead-zinc mining in-
dustry now drawing to a close
will again point up the prob-
lems which have beset this in-
dustry over most of the past
decade. We call upon the ex-

__ ecutive branch and the Con-
" gress,- when the report of this

investigation is submitted later
this month, to take appropri-
ate action to extend the exist-

ing lead-zinc quotas to manu-'

fact1u'ed and semi-finished
lead-zinc articles. The absence
to date of quotas ‘on the latter
items has sharply limited the
effectiveness of quotas on

manufactured lead and zinc
metal, ores and concentrates.
The Board reaffirms its pre-
vious recommendation that in-
dividual country quotas be ad-
justed to give credit to coun-
tries where lead-zinc miners’
wages approximate wages of
comparable workers in
United States.

“Lead-zinc mining subsidy
bills now before Congress and
to be considered later this
month by a subcommittee of
the House Interior Committee
fail to meet the problems of
the bulk of the nation’s pro-
duction facilities in these met-
als. Pending bills would extend

aid only to very small mines,’

or to a small proportion of the
output of large mines. In this
respect, they would be less
adequate than subsidy legisla-
tion previously considered by
the Congress. Any subsidy ap-
proach to the problems of the
lead-zinc industry would need
to encompass the large sec-
tions of the industry not cov-
ered under pending proposals.

“The Board reaffirms its po-
sition previously adopted in
opposition to the release of
lead, zinc or copper from exist-
ing government stockpiles.
Any such action inevitably
would operate to the longer
range disadvantage of orderly
development of the nation’s re-
sources of these metals.”

ON POITICAL ACTION, the
Board noted this is a presi-
dential election year during
which many states" will be
electing state legislators as
well as U. S. Senators, Repre-
sentatives and governors.

In order to make the union’s
voice heard in -the selection of
still undetermined candidates
and the adoption of. platforms,
the Board proposed immediate

activation of the union’s po- -

litical action program. It sug-
