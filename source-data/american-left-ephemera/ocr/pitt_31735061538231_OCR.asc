 

forced to admit women members; in some cases they bar-
gained for equal pay for equal work, in fewer‘cases they
fought for seniority for women. Women filled jobs they had
never filled before and colleges rushed women through
degree-granting crash programs in high priority fields like
engineering.

However, by the time I went to college in the mid-fifties, ~

these gains had long vanished. Jobs held by men before the
war had in many cases been “frozen” for them until their
return and women were expected to yield whatever career
advancement they had made in return for the “sacrifice”
the men had made fighting in the war.

The economy demanded that women be quickly trans-
formed from producers and highly skilled, competitive
technicians into lower level service workers, but primarily
into consumers. Our institutions and media were primed for
_this goal. And my contemporaries, long used to striving
for approval, were happy to do what was expected of them.
TIME Magazine, with unusual acumen, termed us a genera-
tion of passive notetakers. ,

I went to Douglass College, the women’s division of
Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. I was
resentful much of the time. I hated the curfews, strictly
enforced, which were imposed on us while across town,
male Rutgers students were free to come and go at any
hour. None of my classmates showed any anger—most of
them thought it was a good thing “for girls to have rules.”

I decided to change my major at the end of my freshman
year from journalism to English. I gushed to the head of the
English Department about the humanistic values of litera-

ture and he nodded approvingly, “Yes, English is a good
major. Most of our graduates become secretaries or teach-

ers.
There was no viable alternative during those years.

McCarthyism had foreclosed dissent. The only politically '

minded women I knew struck me as an elitist bunch, who
cultivated ‘personal eccentricity, who vtere scornful of and
scorned by their fellow students. The only student political
organization, N.S.A., was geared toward campus issues and
C.I.A. recruitment.

Some took refuge in aesthetics. I could discuss literature
with my friends—T.S. Eliot was the big poet on campus-
but literary appreciation was and is another kind of cop-out.
There was no one with whom I could even articulate, in
meaningful terms, my sense that the way we were living was
rotten. And the result of ineffectuality, prolonged in isola-
tion is that one comes to believe that one’s problems are
internal and purely of one’s making.

Naturally the political climate of the finky fifties af-
fected personal relationships. The crew-cut, white bucked
young men of the era, destined for the grey ﬂannel corpor-
ate structure, a government service or spying agency (at
least two of the men 1 dated in college entered the FBI),
had one area of experimentation open to them, sexual
adventurism (the only campus uprisings of the period were
panty raids). Yet here too, there were complex limitations.
Our salvation, as T.S. Eliot would remind us, was not with
man but with adhering to traditional institutions. A girl
must be chased but chaste; she must affirm a man’s mas-
culinity by showing her awareness of his attractiveness, but

she must never succumb-—or, as college women would re-

- mind each other solemnly, he would lose all “respect” for

her. It was the age of the horny hypocrite. Men would
boast in their fraternity “bull sessions” of their conquests,
but end each recital with the vow that “the woman I marry
must be a virgin.”

In my senior year, a group of Rutgers students confided
to some of my friends that they had-reported regularly to
the Dean of Women at Douglass about girls whose behavior
at fraternity parties had been, in their opinion, indiscreet.

In the latter part of my senior year I returned to campus
after spring vacation to find that a close friend, a Phi Beta
Kappa honors student, had left school. I made inquiries and
ﬁnally spoke to the dean. She told me that reports had

. been brought to her on numerous occasions about my

friend’s relationship with a Rutgers student. Different peo-
ple had reported that she had been living with him in his
New Brunswick boarding house. The dean said she had
confronted my friend with these reports and had demanded
that she go before the student honor board, “with a certain-

' ty of dismissal and a blot on her record,” or leave the

college and repeat her senior year. I learned later that my
friend did go back and get ‘her degree and in addition, won
a Woodrow Wilson fellowship. Naturally, no penalty was

- ever inflicted on the Rutgers student.

In the final week of my senior year, the round of

I precommencernent activities included a lecture by a min-
ister who used the Biblical text, “And let the older women

teach the younger women to be submissive unto their
husbands.” He told us at length that higher education was

, ‘alright, but that we must never forget that our true fun-
I , ction was to be obedient wives and tender, loving mothers.

I searched among my classmates afterward for someone

I who shared my outrage at this condescension, but everyone

I talked with termed it a ﬁne sermon. It was depressing to
realize that most of the women I knew were confirmed

I misogynists. The only legitimate accomplishment for a

woman was her ability to attract a man. “What good did all

,. her brains do her,” my classmates said of a renowned
*~ scholar, “she never got a husband.” The women I knew

identiﬁed only with the achievements of their menfolk;
usually their career plans went to the extent to “teaching
for a few years until Larry gets through med/law/grad
school.” Earlier in their college careers, most girls had
ranked each other by the number of dates each had; now
each woman was frantic about marriage. “If I don’t get a
man by the time I’m twenty-two,” a twenty year old friend
said in panic, “I might as well give up.” It was against this
backdrop of desperation that Marjorie Morningstar was
hailed as a major literary achievement of the decade and
Her-man.Wouk was reverently Timecoverized.

The college years were bad for me, what followed was
worse. I didn’t want to be Mrs. Button Down, but what
could I be? I come from a working class family. Like many
others, my parents were hurt by the Depression. I had
worked after school and summers since I was fourteen to
earn money for college. I had won a tiny scholarship (the
only big scholarships then were football scholarship s). I had
striven for grades since elementary school. My search for a
job after college showed me how absurd all that effort had
been. It didn’t matter how much or how little effort had
been madedby a male college graduate, but all that was

relevant in work terms so far as I was concerned was how
fast I could type and whether I could take shorthand.

I had a number of awful jobs, my self-esteem withering.
I could not even do the silly tasks well. My fingers would
stumble and shuffle over the typewriter keys, I could not
read my own shorthand notes, I would garble telephone
messages.

I sank into a pit of depression; if anyone had asked me, I
probably would have agreed that Herman Wouk was right.

Of course my relationships with men were disastrous. I
was always tense and fearful because the possiblity of
failure in a relationship was so threatening-and yet I was
always so relieved when the inevitable rupture came.

' In time, I fulfilled the other half of the English Chair-
rmn’s prophecy: I became a teacher. Not for any positive
reason, just because teaching seemed less stupid than sten-
ography. My first and subsequent teaching jobs were in
New York ghetto high schools. I wasn’t especially skillful at
first, but I also was not desensitized. I began to look at and
listen to my students and gained so much respect for them
for the fantastic and unappreciated struggle they were mak-
ing for the inadequate education they were given. I began
to try to meet their needs and to take pride in small
tangible measures of success (I realize, of course, that
because of the destructive nature of the school system, this

- “success” is illusoryi).

I had been teaching for a few years when I went to the
South. I went -for self-affirmation as much as for any other
reason. I taught in freedom schools in Virginia in the
summer of 1963 and in Mississippi in the summer of 1964.
The optimism of the civil rights movement is long gone but
I felt then and I feel now that the work of the freedom
schools was relevant.

Mississippi was the beginning of my liberation. There
was danger at times but I found that courage came from
discipline, from doing what must be done—unﬂamboyantly
(I could finally put the caped, masked heroine to rest). I
was pleased to find—asI had always hoped—that I could act
with “grace under pressure,” but oh, how silly Hemingway
he-mannerisms seemed to me after,,that summer.

I began to have friendships with movement women. The
discussions we had were serious and analytical, theory and
perception testing, far more satisfactory usually than dis-
cussions with movement men, who tended to be arrogant
and domineering or frivolous and personal. Still, we were a
movement within a movement, not yet ready to take our
problems seriously. But through each other, we were begin-
ning to realize the validity of our experience and percep-
tions; we began to take our aspirations for ourselves serious-
ly. I began to work on a doctorate, other friends have
entered law school. We began, finally, to see that meeting
our own needs, envisioning the full range of our potential
was a necessary part of meaningful change.

Women’s liberation has surfaced—we know the joys of
sisterhood at last~but we see as well that there are prob-
lems that divide us. Many women have not yet recognized
themselves, and many men are refusing to recognize us-
even some of our radical brothers are snickering. Most men
have refused to relinquish what they consider the last safe
target for abuse and humiliation. But when they begin to
take us seriously—and quite shortly they will-sisters, we
had better be ready.

In attempting to put together an alphabet soup of the
women’s liberation movement, I began to feel that I was
assembling some sort of descriptive telephone book for a
small city. With each new discovered and .defined group
came inklings of a dozen others just beyond, until it be-
came apparent that whatever else the movement is, its
numbers are legion and no comprehensive list could be got
ready by deadline time.

In a recent article (November 21) on “the new femi-
nism,” Time Magazine reported that there are “at least 50
groups in New York. . . 35 in the San Francisco Bay
Area. . . 30 in Chicago, 25 in Boston and a scattering of
others in cities ranging from Gainesville, Fla. to Toronto.” I
can add to that list an indeterminate number of British
groups and a large movement in Berlin (where radical femi-
nists have organized into communes, opened childcare and
information centers and operate a mobile health care ser-
vice). Fifty in New York? At least. Furthermore, the groups
vary greatly in type. Some are small, informal conscious-
ness-raising groups like the one described in this issue.
Others are organized around a single issue central to the
movement such as abortion or free child-care, some along
extra-feminist lines (for example, professional groups such
as Media Women or the numerous high school, college and
graduate school groups). Still othersare feminist caucuses
within organizations that are, to put it mildly in some cases,
not primarily feminist (e.g. YSA Women, the Women’s
Rights Caucus of the New Democratic Coalition, SDS Wo-
men). Finally, there are the groups whose organization and
politics are primarily feminist, independent and non-ferni-
nist professional and political affiliations, and who operate
in a wider sphere than the informal consciousness-raising
groups. I don’t have a complete list of these groups—-as far
as I know, no one does, since it is a characteristic peculiar
to the women’s liberation movement that it cuts across all
social divisions of class and race and that it is as politically
complex and fluid as a movement can be. New groups are
constantly forming, old ones divide and’ multiply into new
or undergo radical transformations as women strive for a
new and truer definition not only of themselves but of
politics as well. I began this project with the idea of
producing a neat diagram of the movement, a tidy, con-
scientious parsing of its elements. That idea has been aban-
doned; how does one diagram upheaval‘? Instead, what
follows is an attempt to describe briefly six groups whose
differences of style and concentration will yield a rough
measure of the movement as a whole. ‘

“Citywide” women’s liberation ,_c0alz'tion. This group
properly has no name and doesn’t particularly want one,
but is generally referred to as “Citywide.” It began in the
spring of 1969 as a coalition of revolutionary women, some
from other feminist groups, many from non-feminist radical
organizations (e.g. SDS, Newsreel, Levianthan and later,
RYM II), who met every other Thursday evening to°concen—
trate on women’s liberation issues. It has a ﬂuctuating
attendance membership of 50-70 women, who tend to
believe that while capitalism/imperialism and male chauvi-
nism maintain each other, the greater power and therefore
the focus of attack resides in the system rather than in male
chauvinism. They are distinct from much of the rest of the

women’s liberation movement by the fact that they ac- .

knowledge the possibility of strategic alliances with male-

dominated radical groups. They see women’s liberation as
essential to any real revolution, but do not always’ place
primary emphasis on it. Suggesting that “freedom is the
recognition of necessity” one woman active in the coalition
gave as an example the need for black and brown women to
multiply in order to combat “American genocidal policies”
as more important than the demand for control over their
bodies, i.e. free abortion and birth control. The same wo-
man pointed out, however, that there was a growing trend
in the coalition toward a more strictly feminist approach.

According to another member, the coalition has organized

separate day-care, abortion and health collectives and is in
O » the process of developing others. A propaganda collective is

.— planned, as well as others to work with high school and

' college students, and people are moving to Brooklyn and
Queens to organize there. The coalition is also willing to

assist any women in starting their own consciousness-raising

office, 2700 Broadway, New York City.
. The Feminists. Self-described as “a political organization
to annihilate sex roles” The Feminists began on October
17, 1968 as a breakaway group from N.O.W. which they
considered too hierarchical and superficial in its approach
to women’s liberation. An intense and highly disciplined
group, they meet twice a week and conduct frequent work-
shops and special meetings as well. Penalties for irregular
attendance are temporary loss of voting privileges and, if
necessary, expulsion from the group. They require further
that not more than one third of their membership be either
married or living with a man, on the basis that such arrange-
ment are inherently inequitable. They are also insistantly
democratic: the chair and secretary of each meeting are
chosen by lot, and all work, whether menial or demanding
of special skills, is assigned by lot with provision against the
same sort of task—writing a position paper, for example-
falling to one member twice before it has made the round
of the group.

The Feminists’ rules reflect their political theory which

""°*°‘ ”°'"‘°‘"°"‘ "‘° M""°'" male-female role system . . .The pathology of oppression

Women demonstrating outside Health, Education and Welfare can only be fully comprehended in its primary develgp-
at1959M0bi"Za“°“IVV35h‘“9‘°”D-C ment, the male-female division. Because the male-female
system is primary, the freedom of every oppressed indivi-
dual ‘depends upon the freeing of every individual from
every aspect of the male-female system.” They demand that
marriage and the family be eliminated, that children be
cared for by the society as a whole and not “belong” to
anyone and that extra-uterine means of reproduction be
developed as “a humane goal.” They also oppose sexual
intercourse (“at present its psychology is dominance-
passivity”) and suggest the exploration of other means of
sexual gratification as a way toward “physical relations . . .

(that) would be an extensionof communication between
individuals.” In a demonstration at the Marriage License
Bureau and City Hall the Feminists made additional de-
mands for economic and educational reparations for wo-
men and repeal of all state laws pertaining to marriage,
divorce and annulment. An interesting packet describing in
greater, detail the structure and basic principles of the group
may be obtained for twenty-five cents by writing to The
Feminists at 320 West 108th Street.

National Organization for Women. NOW was founded in
1966 by Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique.
It has more than 5000 members, including some l0O men,
with chapters in all the major cities of the U.S. lt is the
most politically moderate of the feminist organizations and
concentrates on working within the system with a program
of legislative demands for full equality for women. Those
demands include passage of an Equal Rights Amendment to
the Constitution which reads, “Equality of Rights under
the Law shall not be denied or abridged by the United
States or by any State on account of sex.” NOW also
demands the repeal of all abortion laws, the establishment

groups. The group may be contacted through the Leviathan ‘

states, in part, that “all political classes grew out of the_

14

of free, state-supported child-care centers and the revision
of the tax laws to permit full deduction of all housekeeping
and child-care expenses for working parents. The organiza-

tion functions as an effective legislative pressure group and

is considered to be largely responsible for the barring of
sexual categorization in Want Ads and was instrumental in
winning the fight by airline stewardesses to marry and stay
on the job after age 32. NOW is the only currently active
feminist organization that did not develop out of New
Left-oriented radical politics, a fact that is reﬂected, per-
haps, not only in its tendancy to focus somewhat exclu-

sively on specific legislative inequities without going on to
scrutinize the social and political system in which these’

inequities ﬂourish but also in the structure of the organiza-
tion itself. Not only is NOW hierarchical—there is a board
of directors, as well as national and local officers, all elected
for fixed terms—but among its male members there is even
a chapter president, a phenomenon that one might safely
guess has not been duplicated elsewhere in women’s libera-
tion. There is evidence, however, that a radical trend is
developing in NOW which should be interesting to watch.
NOW’s Manhattan office is at 328 West 12th Street, tele-
phone 929-8250.

Redstockings. Formed in January 1968, Redstockings
insist on the need for a completely new political analysis
based on their personal experience as women. Much of their
energy has been devoted to personal consciousness-raising,
not as “therapy. . . but as the only method by which we
can ensure that our program for liberation is based on the
concrete realities of our lives.” They have participated
regularly in women’s liberation demonstrations since the
start of the movement, however, they recently disrupted

and took over an abortion hearing in New York at which

women were denied_places on the panel. Their persistance
in sticking to their slogan, “We will not ask what is ‘revolu-

tionary’ or ‘reformist’ only what is good for women,” has,

on occasion, put them very much at odds with the Citywide

, faction of the movement. (It’s impossible, for example, to

imagine Redstockings accepting the Citywide interpretation
of the priorities of black and brown women in regard to
abortion andbirth control.)

Redstockings ﬂatly blames men for women’s oppression,
stating in their manifesto that “all other forms of exploita-
tion and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.)
are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, a
few men dominate the rest.” The group is opposed to
marriage and the nuclear family but does not attempt to
legislate the sexual lives of its members. They further “call
on all men to give up their male privileges and support
women’s liberation,” a demand that reflects their own
personal pledge to “repudiate all economic, racial, educa-
tional or status privileges that divide us from other wo-
men.” They hold an orientation meeting for new vﬁ)men on
the first Sunday of every month and they also have a
selection of interesting _literature for sale. ,,Write Red-

The Stanton-A nthony Brigade of the Radical Feminists.
Just begun _in November by a group of women already
active in women’s liberation who felt the need for a group
that would concentrate specifically on creating a mass
movement. The Brigade, by virtue of the political history of

its members, is radical-leftist but emphasizes feminism as .

the core of its politics. Their program is one of “conscious-
ness-raising actions,” demonstrations designed to focus na-
tional attention on radical feminism and to draw as many
women as possible into the movement. They feel that too
many women’s liberation actions in the past have been
politically self-indulgent (for example, wearing arm bands
mourning the death of Ho Chi Minh at the Miss America
demonstration) and have as a result turned women away
from a movement that should properly be inviting them in.
They also welcome publicity (many groups don’t at this
point, largely out of fear and distrust) and when planning
demonstrations will take into account ways to circumvent
distortion and misunderstanding of their actions. They have
begun with a core group of around 20 women and welcome
new members. As their membership grows it is to be divid-
ed into separate “brigades” of fifteen women each. So far

7 they have met once a week, usually on Monday nights, and

a meeting for new people is planned for the near future.

Women ’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell
(WITCH). WITCH surfaced on Halloween Day, 1968, with
an “Up against the Wall Street” action involving day-long

street theatre in the financial district and talk sessions with,

the women who work there. It is a ﬂamboyant
act ion-oriented organization with more than thirty autono-
mous covens around the country. Like most of women’s
liberation it has no official leaders and functions by consen-
sus. WITCH is opposed to marriage and the nuclear family
but its distinctiveness lies less in its ideology than in its
style, which is by turns exuberant, rude, funny and extra-
vagant. On the bus ride to Atlantic City for last summer’s
Miss America demonstration, a coven sitting in the back
produced several fine, rowdy songs and chants for the
demonstration when the bus was barely out of New York.
WITCH, more than any other group, suggests in its tone
that women’s liberation can be fun. A few excerpts from

‘ their manifesto:

WITCH is an all-woman Everything. It’s theater, revolu-

tion, magic, terr.or, joy, garlic ﬂowers, spells. It’s an.

awareness that witches and gypsies were the original
guerrillas and resistance fighters against oppres-
sion .‘I . Witches were the first Friendly Heads and Deal-
ers, the first birth-control practitioners and abortionists,
the first alchemists . . . WITCH lives and laughs in every
woman. She is the free part of each of us, beneath the
shy smiles, the acquiescence to absurd male domina-
tion. . . if you are a woman and dare to look within
yourself, you are a witch. . .you are free and beauti-
ful . . . Whatever is repressive, solely male-oriented, gree-
dy, puritanical, authoritarian—those are your tar-
gets. . . . you are pledged to free our brothers ‘from op-
‘ pression and stereotyped sexual roles as well as our-
selves. You are a witch. by saying aloud, “I am a Witch,”
three times, and thinking about that. You are a witch by
being female, untamed, angry, joyous, and immortal.”
WITCH also quotes the Bible _(Judges): “for rebellion is as
the sin of witchcraft.” New members are welcome and may
write to P.O. Box '694, Stuyvesant Station, New York

FETCHIT‘
WOMAN

Lesbianism is one road to free-
dom~freedom from oppression by

‘ men.

To see lesbianism in this con-
tex,t—as a mode of living neither better
nor worse than others, as one which
offers its own opportunities—-one must
abandon the notion that deviance
from the norm arises from personal
illness.

It is generally accepted that Amer-
ica is a “sick society. ” There is an
inevitable corollary to this statement,
which has not been generally accept-
ed: that people within our society are
all crippled by virtue of being forced
to conform to certain norms. (Those
who conform most easily can be seen
as either the most healthy, because
adaptable, or most sick because least
spirited.) The black is struggling to
free himself not only from white op-

F pression, but fromthe sickness of self-

contempt and the sick roles he has
been forced to play. Women are strug-
gling to liberate their minds from sick

sexual roles. It is clear that the self-
abasing, suffering, shufﬂing black is
not someone with a personal neurosis,

but society’s victim—and someone
who has been forced to learn certain
techniques for survival. Few people
understand that the same is true of the
se If-a b n ega ting passive. housewife.

Fewer understand this truth about the
homosexual

These techniques of survival help us
meet certain needs, at the expense of
others.

For women, as for other groups,
there are several American norms All
of them have their rewa-rds—and their
penalties The nice girl next door, vir-
ginal until her marriage-the Miss
America type—is rewarded with com-
munity respect and respectability. She
loses her individuality and her freedom
to become a toothpaste smile and a
chastity belt. The career woman gains
independence and a larger margin
of freedom—if she is willing to work
twice as hard as a man for less pay,

. and if she can cope with emotional

strains similar to those that beset? the
black intellectual surrounded_by white
colleagues. The starlet, call-girl, or
bunny whose source of income is da-
ectly related to her imsge as a sex

, object, gains some financial indepen-

dence and freedom from housework.
She doesn’t have to work as hard as
the career woman, but she pays
through psychological degradation as a
sex object, and through the insecurity

of knowing that her career—based on '

youthful good looks—is short-lived.
The lesbian, through her ability to
obtain love and sexual satisfaction
from other women, is freed of depen-
dence on men for- love, sex and
money. She does not have to do men-
ial chores for them ( at least at home),
nor cater to their egos, nor submit to
hasty and inept sexual encounters. She

is freed from fear of unwanted preg- '

nancy and the pains ofchildbirth, and
from the drudgery of child raising.
On the other hand, she pays three

penalties. The rewards of child raising F

are denied her. This is a great loss for
some women, but not for others. Few
women abandon their children, as
compared with the multitudes of men
who abandon both wives and children.
Few men take much interest in the
process of child raising. One suspects
that it might not be much fun for the

average person, and so the men leave it ‘

to the women.

The lesbian must compete with
men in the job market, facing the same
job and salary discrimination as her
straight sister. On the other hand, she
has more of a chance of success since
her career is not interrupted by child-
birth. _

Finally, she faces the most severe
contempt and ridicule that society can
heap on a woman.

A year ago, when Women's Libera-
tion picketed the 1968 Miss America
pageant, the most terrible epithet
heaped on our straight sisters was “les-

bian”. The sisters faced hostile aud-.

iences who called them “commies,
“tramps,” “bathless, ” etc., and _ they
faced these labels with equanimity;
but they broke into tears when they
were called lesbians. When a woman
showed up at a feminist meeting and
announced that she was a lesbian,
many women avoided her. Others told

her to keep her mouth shut, for fear"

that she would endanger the cause.
They felt that men could be persuaded

15

to accept some measure of equality for
women—as long as these women would
parade their devotion to heterosex-
uality and motherhood. ’

. A woman who is. totalbz indepen-
dent of men—who obtains love, sex
and self-esteem from other women——is
a terrible threat to male supremacy.
She doesn’t need them, and therefore
they have very little power over her.

I have met many, many feminists
who were not lesbians-but I have
never met a lesbian who was not a
feminist. Straight women by the mil-
lions have been sold the belief that
they must subordinate themselves to
men, accept.less pay for equal work,
and do all the shit work around the
house. I have met straight women who
would die to preserve their chains. 1
have never met a lesbian who believed
that she was innately less rational or_
capable than a man; who swallowed
one word of the “woman ’s role”
horse- shit.

Lesbians, because they are not af-
raid of being abandoned by men, are
less reluctant to express hostility to-
wards the male class— the oppressors of
women. Hostility towards your op-
pressor is healthy—but the guardians
of modern morality, the psychiatrists,
have interpreted this hostility as an
illness, and they say this illness causes
and is lesbianism.

If hostility to men causes lesbian-
ism, then it seems to me that in a
male-dominated society, lesbianism is
a sign of mental health.

The psychiatrists have also forgot-
ten that lesbianism involves love be-
tween women. Isn’t love between
equals healthier than sucking up to an
oppressor‘? And when they claim we
aren’t capable of loving men, even if
we want to-I ask you, straight man,
are you capable of loving another man
so deeply that you aren’t afraid of his
body or afraid to put your body in his
hands? Are you really capable of lov-
ing women, or is your sexuality just
another expression of your hostility?
Is it an act of love or sexual conquest?
An act of sexual imperialism?

I do not mean to condemn all
males. I have found some- beautiful,
loving men among the revolutionaries,
among the hippies, and the male
homosexuals. But the average man-—

including the average student male rad-

ical—wants a passive sex-object cum
domestic cum baby nurse to clean up

16

after him while he does all the fun
things and bosses her around —while he
plays either bigshot executive or Che
Guevara—and he is my oppressor and
my enemy.

Society has taught most lesbians to
believe that they are sick and has
taught most straight women to despise

and fear the lesbian as a perverted,

diseased creature. It has fostered the
myth that lesbians are ugly and turn to
each other because they can ’t get that
prize, that prince, a male! In this age
of the new “sexual revolution”,
another myth has been fostered—the
beautiful lesbians who play games with
each other on the screen for the titilla-
tion of heterosexual males They are
not seen as serious people in love—but
as performers in the “let’s try a new
perversion ” game.

Freud founded the myth of penis
envy, and men have asked me, “But
what can two women do together?”
As though a "penis were the sine qua
non of sexual pleasure! Man, we can
do without it, and keep it going lon-
ger, too!

Women are afraid to be without a
man ’s protection—because other men
will assault them on the streets’. And
this is no accident, not an aberration
performed by a few lunatics. Assaults

on women are no more an accident.

than are lynchings of blacks in Missis-
sippi Men have oppressed us, and like
most oppressors, they hate the oppres-
sed and fear their wrath. Watch a
white man walking in Harlem and, you
will see what I mean. Look at the face
of a man who has accidentally wan-
dered into a lesbian bar.

Men fear lesbians because they are
less dependent, and because their hos-
tility is less controlled.

Straight women fear lesbians be-
cause of the lesbian inside them, be-
cause we represent an alternative.
They fear us for the same reasons that
uptight middle class people fear hip
people. They are angry at us because
we have a way out that they are afraid
to take.

And what happens to the lesbian
under all this pressure? Many of my
sisters, confused by the barrage of anti-
gay propaganda, have spent years beg-
ging to be allowed to live. They have
come begging because they believed
they were psychic cripples, and that
other people were healthy and had the
moral right to judge them. Many have

lived in silence, burying themselves in
their careers, like name.-‘[c’ha"nging Jews
and blacks who passed for white.
Many have retreated into an apolitical
domesticity, concerning themselves
only with the attempts to destroy love
and replace it with consumer goods-
ﬂowers, mouthwashes, diamond rings,
automobiles—and which attempts to
completely destroy any form of love
outside the monogamous marriage.

This, by the way, is an important
point for all kinds of revolutionaries.
If you love your brother, you are less
willing to stand by and watch him get
crushed under the relentless pressure
of the rat race, of the doctor bills and
the furniture bills. If you love your
brother, you won ’t try to swindle him.
Restricting love to the immediate fam-
ily group isolates each family from the
comrnunity—each ethnic group from
the others—and makes all these isolated
frightened people more willing to set-
tle for fancy furniture on the install-
ment plan, for grudgingly bestowed re-
spectability, because they can ’t get the
real thing, real love. .

To return to lesbianism—because
lesbianism has become such a vile epi-
thet, we have been afraid to fight
openly. We can lose our jobs~we have
fewer civil rights than any other
minority group. Because we have few
family ties and no children, for the
most part, we have been active in
many causes—but always in secret, be-
cause our name contaminates any
cause that we work for.

To the radical lesbian, I say that we
can no longer afford to ﬁght for every-
one else ’s cause while ignoring our
own. Ours is a life style born out of a
sick society—so is everyone else ’s. Our
kind of love is as valid as anyone else ’s.
The revolution must be fought for us,
too, as well as blacks, Indians, welfare
mothers, grape pickers, SDS people,
Puerto Ricans, or mine workers. We
must have a revolution for human
rights.

Maybe after the revolution, people
will be able to love each other regard-
less of skin color, ethnic origin, occu-
pation, or type of genitals. But if
that’s going to happen, it will only
happen because we make it—starting
right now.

What defines a liberated woman? In my economic and
generational bracket she’s a woman who had to earn her
living before she married and who will get a job when
.money’s tight and he nonetheless A Woman, i.e., run the
house, mother the kids and try to keep her husband out of
the clutches of some gal who has more time to devote to his
ego. If she has An Education she will feel compelled not to
“waste” it and will bring in her share of the family income.
Mostly it's a question of economics. We only feel equal if
we earn money.

It seems to me a liberated woman is one who does
anything—-have a baby, hold a job, be a jockey——because she
wants to, not because she’s forced to. But then, that°s a
liberated man, too. So much of it comes right down to
liberating us all, men and women, from a lot of stupid
patterns, economic, sexual and social, without getting into
worse ones. I mean, I am long past the point where I feel
I’m a traitor to my Sex because I prefer brewing and baking
all day and half the night to being a teacher or a social
worker. Teachers exploit kids and social workers exploit
the poor and I’ve come to think those professions, as they
are now practiced, will have to go as surely as bombardiers
and munitions makers. And I don’t cry any tears over, say
women in advertising who aren’t offered the highpaying
jobs. I do get wrathful about underpaid nurses, not because

they ‘re female but because, like all truly useful workers in~

this society, they are undervalued.

Peculiar situations arise in regard to woman’s role at the
two communes I’m best acquainted with. At the longer-
established place, women, I understand, are not wanted in
the fields. They do specifically the kitchen work and light
gardening. They tell me that in the beginning—when they
were needed—the women worked_along with the men. Now
that the community has progressed to a degree of comfort
and self-sufficiency it is no longer a girl’s choice whether
she does “woman’s work” or “man°s.” Some of the girls
who resented their work being thus defined left for a newer
commune close by which is still at the stage of heavy
building and where they are welcomed to help whatever is
most urgent. Obviously the men have no choice at either
place. A division of labor that gives the physically weaker
members the lighter jobs makes sense. And where your
community°s desperate need is a roof and four walls against
the coming winter you’re not going to have a husky male

(or a not so husky one,_ for that matter) doing the cook-_

  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  

ing—-though cooking for 25 on a wood stove without run-
ning water is no easy task. It will be interesting to see how
roles develop as the new commune gets into more comfort-
able stages. I imagine many of the original women at the
older commune are glad not to have to be doing heavy
work. That part of building the community is over and they
shared in it. Perhaps some of the latecomers feel that by
missing the longer experience they are not as fully mem-
bers.

We came here, in part, to learn to live together. And
living together, meaningfully, means working together; not 
necessarily doing the same work but each having a part in"
keeping the family (or community) going. Kids especially
miss out on this today. Lots of women, too. They don’t
have anything real to do. Then I think of all the men whose

can see it all around me. I see no issue in soeiet:y more
directly related to my own personal struggles and values
than the effort to challenge people to listen to conscience
and refuse to accept militarism.

I°m not interested in talking unless its related to real life
decisions. I’m not interested in approaching problems
through “position papers” rather than experimentation. I’m
not against theory but I want to see it solidly based on
experience. For women to strive to be “political” strikes
me as emulating something l°d like to get away from. I
think women who advocate day care centers for children
have, for the most part, neither worked in one nor sent
children to one. I’Vc done both. I’m not sure these liberated
women would want to do either. It’s a theoretically derived
conclusion, Isuspect.

Nevertheless, I have benefitted from the consciousness
which Womenis L_ib,has encourged, which does grow out
of experience. We/’ve known that it would be hard to
support kids alone if we had to. \Ve°ve known that it is a
man’s-world culture and that women seek status and self-
dcfinition through sex. But Wom.en°s Lib has helped us to
see it in ads, hear it in speech, resist it in little ways every
day. I would really value. the further development of Wo-
men°s Lib among the pacifist segment of the movement, for
the mutual liberation of men and women from the aggres-
sive/submissiveia’l.l sorts of false stuff which we know we
reject but have to learn how to overcome. We can help each
other.

I think baking bread is a good thing to do. So is caring
for children. We need men working in nursery schools and
day care centers. There is no reason w.hy people shouldn’t
do these things and enjoy them, nor any good reason why
men or women shouldn°t both be doing them. /\nd l don"t
think we should shove off onto someone else the tasks we
don ’t like doing. Years agﬁ), when our fourteen-year-old was
a baby, we lived in a total community of shared work,
livelihood, and values. I remember one day rinsing soiled
diapers and thinking, what work could be more important
than this'.’ A new life, a community, all was of one p‘ie(:c. Ur
scrubbing stubby little potatoes for the community meal,
knowing Alma was in the shop and every other person
working to make the whole community, the whole life we
believed in, to be sustained. That feeling of amcaningful
context for work, menial work, day-to-day work which can
be done for love of the other people it is done for, this is
what we lack so keenly most of the time.

In this alienated, separated, distraught and (lireetimiless,
pressured atmosphere in which we work and try to-bring up
children and seek for some way to make a relevant contri-
bution to a better society, it has been all important for us
to know that a loving and mutually supporting meaningful
context is notjust a dream but can and has llilpp(‘.llt.‘.(l in our
experience. And because we know it has llappenetl we feel
bound to try to live that way where it isn”t happening. Mi-,n
and women share this desire and need to create it together
in their homes, places of work, and in the i‘i1()vemcnt.

‘here are a lot of men around who
think they ought to be automatically
opposed to the Women’s Liberation
Movement, but are keeping their eyes
and ears open for some clues about
what they ought to be opposed to.
Here is some food for their thought or
grist for their mill, whichever the case
may be, written by one who thinks

.men would be just as aggrieved by

imposed deﬁnitions of “masculinity”
as women are beginning to be about
imposed definitions of “feminity” if
only their role weren’t defined as the
“superior” one.

First of all, when women are seen
as marginal to the labor force they can
be called upon to work in areas where
shortages have occurred and wages
would otherwise be forced up. Since
they are willing to work for less, be-
cause of fewer opportunities for well-
paid positions, less mobility, and in
some cases less need when they are
supported by men (all of which are
aspects of the systematic subordin-

ation of women), they can be used as a,

threat both to the status and the re-
munerative value of a given occupa-
tion. The cure for this is not to in-
crease vigilance in keeping women out,

 WHA'F HA5 WEIMEWS LIB

but to welcome them as equals and
destroy the system that allows them to
be experienced as “unfair compe-
tition.”

Secondly, men should welcome a
movement that gives legitimacy to the
kinds of role changes that they have
already enjoyed or succumbed to (de-
pending on one’s point of view). If a
man no longer feels he must pull the
blinds before changing the baby or
loading the dishwasher, or that he
must apologize for bringing the kids
along to a meeting or canceling a trip
because he wants to attend a child’s
theater production, he has liberated
himself from a particularly insidious
form of oppression. Is it such a loss to
give up a style of life that separates
men from subsistence and nurturant
aspects of human existence? What
kind of human being is it that gets
revved up in the morning for his more-
often-than-not programmed work role,
and returns home in the evening to be
fed and petted and put to bed, then
goes through the motions of loving
and caring and conversing without the
possibility of genuine respect and com-
panionship between man and woman?

To take the case a bit further . . . to

break down the service—production dis-
tinction between men and women is,
in effect, to break down the hierar-
chical [ordering of people in society
generally, and to put people in a posi-
tion where they have to be responsible
for the consequences of their deci-
sions. If women are allowed to prod
men into doing things that they them-
selves would never do and men can
blame women for forcing them tc
trample the rights of others (in the
name of being a good provider, de-
fender of the faith, guardian of the
nation-state, etc.) the results are
 . well, look around and see what the
results are.

Societies that do not engage in war-
fare and in intraspecies competition
are without exception characterized
by a lack of distinction between the
work roles of men and women, (not
that men and women always perform
identical tasks, but they work together
cooperatively in productive capacities,
and regard each other as friends and
equals.) Such societies do not have
heroes and heroines, nor do they glor-
ify “masculinity” or “feminity”  . al-
though they do emphasize the enjoy-
ment of sex and other earthly plea-
sures.

Which brings us to the issue about
which men are most likely to be unin-
formed, the effect of Women’s Liber-
ation on heterosexual relationships. It
is commonly assumed that to de—em-
phasize differences between men and
women is to encourage “neurotic
homosexuality” or “castrating
women” or other such fearsome aber-
rations. Nothing could be further from
the truth. Liberated women, to the
extent that such can exist in a male-
dominated society, do not deny that
they need men, (although they may, in
some cases, also need women, but not
out of neurotic anxiety over their own
inadequacy.) On the contrary, they are
free to pursue men, to engage them in
mutually pleasurable activities, to re-
ject them as sexual partners without
endangering their valuable interaction
on other levels, and to express tender-
ness and affection toward men they
admire, not toward men to whom they
are merely “obligated” or on whom
they are in some way economically
dependent. Their sexual life is en-
hanced by the fact that they are not
taken in by models of “ideal female-
ness." They are confident of their own
femaleness and do not have to “prove”

it to themselves or others by be-
havioral affectations or standardized
dress.

At the risk of being anti-climactic, a
final point should be made about the
effect of Women’s Liberation on the
lives of men, and this pertains to the
phoniness that pervades all aspects of
life when men are by definition ex-
pected to pursue demanding careers
with single—minded devotion, and to
undertake sole responsibility for the
support of women and children, and
the external maintenance of the home,
regardless of their own often changing
or changeable interests, inclinations,
and abilities, while women are by de-
finition expected to undertake with
single-minded devotion the procreative,
nurturant, and housekeepingta sks with-
in the confines of the nuclear family,
and to engage in other activities only
in a supportive or auxiliary capacity.
These definitions have never been gen-
erally adheredto in spite of the labored
efforts of ecclesiastical, scientific, and
educational authorities, and are the
source of all the woes with which “Ad-
vice” columnists heroically cope.

Imagine a society in which people
would have maximum choice not only

with regard to the kind of work they
pursue, but with regard to their level
of commitment to it as well! Such a
society would require provisions for
child care, meals, , etc. outside the
home for those who would prefer not
to commit themselves regularly to
such activities, whether they be men
or women, and it would require mak-
ing allowances (financial or otherwise)
for men and women who want to de-
vote themselves entirely to such activ-
ities over a period of time. In such a
society neither men nor women would
serve as status symbols for the other,
but both would be regarded as inde-
pendently worthy of respect as indi-
viduals.

To work in these directions is not a
course that women can pursue arro-
gantly or without regard for their own
culturally inherited weaknesses, as well
as those of men. lt is not a course that
they can effectively pursue through
manipulation or coercion. it will take
more than anything else determin-
ation, a sense of humor, and confi-
dence that human beings are capable
of creating themselves in a new image.

On July 3, 1969 1111 Boskey, Kathy
Czarnik, Pat Kennedy, Maggie Geddes
and Valentine Green (later to be
known as Women Against Daddy War-
bucks) appeared in Rockefeller Center
with shreds of draft files, from 13 Man-
hattan draft-boards. (see WIN August
1969). At that time all but‘Maggie
were arrested, plus Linda Forest and I.
We were all charged with converting
government property to our own use,
a1though,what Linda and I had done
was simply to join in the general joyful

I throwing of the files-turned-

t into-confetti.

I During July and August preliminary

. hearings were set and each time the
U.S. prosecuting attorney asked for
and got a postponement—initially on
the grounds that they had not had
enough time, then because it was va-I
cation time and they couldn’t get
enough witnesses (plus a couple of the

Selective Service employees were no

etc. Linda’s and my lawyers—first Wil-
5 liam: Kuntsler and then Carl Broege
from the Law Center for Constitu-
. tional Rights, continually insisted on
our right to a. speedy hearing.
, Maybe I should explain briefly
what the process of going through the
courts is in federal cases. After some-
one is arrested the government is sup-

. inary hearing before a U.S. commis-
sioner, who decides whether there is
~ sufficient evidence to send the case to
a grand jury. Even hearsay evidence is
usually enough for a commissioner to
refer a case to a grand jury. Especially
for defendants who are innocent, a
, preliminary hearing is important as the
» commissioner just may recognize their
innocence and in any case the defen-
dants and their lawyer get to see what

_ “evidence” the government has, or has
concocted, as the case may be. If and
when the case is sent to the grand jury,

' the prosecuting U.S. attorneys present
, more evidence (although in completely
closed sessions) and the grand jury de-
cides whether to issue indictments. A

. grand jury can, and often does, hear
evidence on cases that never went
through a preliminary hearing. There-
I, fore it seemed clear that one reason
the government kept asking for post-
‘ ponements was they were waiting until
a grand jury could be called and issue
indictments, which would obviate the

need for “showing their hand” at a
preliminary hearing. Which is almost
what happened.

On Aug. 19, after 3 prior postpone-

ments, we appeared _for a preliminary‘

hearing and, per usual, the government
asked for a postponement. The com-
missioner obviously recognized our
right to a hearing but rather than grant
it he gave them a postponement and
lifted Linda’s and my travel restric-
tions! On Sept. 9 the government once
again asked for a postponement and
this time the commissioner granted it,
but ordered Linda’s and my bail re-
turned! In both cases we said there was
no connection between our demand
for hearing and our bail conditions but
the commissioner’s idea of justice
seems to be “a little something for
everyone” regardless of the issues in-
volved.

At the preliminary hearing set for
Sept. 9 Linda and 1, Jill and Kathy

longer working there!), and the FBI , t ' “
. still had one-fifth of the evidence, etcr

‘chilling’ effect of First Amendment
freedom of expression. . . The Gov-
ernment’s procrastination is all the
more deplorable when the accused are
deeply involved in political activities
and their arrests grew out of a protest
against the Vietnam war. An extended,
langurous prosecution (even if the ac-
cused are ultimately found to be inno-
cent) would definitely have a chilling
effect on the desire of these defen-
dants, and others, to engage in their
fundamental right to protest govern-
mental policies.”

The government elected to drop the
charges and have us appear before the
grand jury as scheduled rather than
hold a hearing. This meant that bail
was returned to the other four as well
and we were once again “free.”

The morning of the 19th our law-
yers began a suit against the govern-
ment to try to stop the grand jury

proceedings. We argued that the sta-
Wtute under which the grand jury was

investigating was unconstitutional.
That law is concerned with inter-
ference with the administration of the
Selective Service System and contains
the “crime” that Spock et al were in-
dicted for: advocating or conspiracy to
advocate draft evasion or refusal. The
judge said then that he would not inter-
fere with our appearance before the
grand jury that day but he would con-
sider whether’ to send the suit to a

appeared and while we were waiting
for it to begin we were all served with
subpoenas to appear before a grand
jury on Sept. 29. They had subpoenas
for Maggie, Pat and Val as well, al-
though only Val was later served be-
fore we went before the grand jury.
Carl Broege and Fred Boyden, the law-
yer for the other 4, went to’ court the
next week, asking that the subpoenas
be quashed and that we be granted an
immediate preliminary hearing. Judge
Constance Baker Motley finally ruled
on September 16 that we had to .have
a preliminary hearing by the 29th and
that in any case we could not be called
before a grand jury until we had had a
hearing. In her opinion Judge Motley
said: “There is a disquieting history of
governmental laxity with respect to
the holding of preliminary examina-
tions in the Southern District of New
York. This is not to be condoned, es-
pecially where, as here, governmental
practices may imperceptibly lead to a

jthree-judge court,-which is required by
law whenever a law is claimed to be
unconstitutional.

So we went, one by one, before the
grand jury. Jill, Val and Kathy refused
even to give their names; Linda and I
gave our names but did not answer
other questions. We were all told to
come back on October l3th but a
week before that we received letters
saying that the September grand jury
would not be meeting after October
3rd so we would not have to return.
Which is the last we have heard from
the government concerning our prose-
cution. .

On December 2nd the judge who
was considering our suit against the
government dismissed it because, he
said, there is no indication now that we
will either be called again before a
grand jury or that we wiﬂ be pro-
secuted. We are now appealing that

' decision.

TO 613-‘iusco

‘WITH  
‘LOVE

I wanted to be in Washington, but November 15th found
me in San Francisco and I’m glad. I’m glad partly because
no one reported San Francisco, which shows the extent to
which the media are controlled by a small clique of liberal
Communists in New York and Washington, as Chairman
Agnew said, and so I get to report it. My God, there were
maybe a quarter of a million people there (and maybe not
so many) and if it was a quarter of a million people there
(and maybe not so many) and if it was a quarter of a
million—this is ‘Frisco I’m talking about, not D.C.——then it
would have been the largest political demonstration in the
nation’s history, except for the one the same day in D.C.

But the other reason I’m glad I was there is because it
was beautiful. I was staying with friends, Betty and Julia,
and Julia hates crowds and stayed home, but Betty and I
went with a very sweet militant poet named John 0.
Simon, who really felt the days of street peace were over
and is himself busy practicing karate or judo, but ended up
being very high with the day (I think). We woke late and
were to join the parade at the “militant” area, of the five or

six starting points, but everyone had left an hour before we
got there so we trudged over hill and over hill and over hill
(this being San Francisco) until we finally‘ caught up with
this huge mass of humanity.

The whole thing turned me on, so I started taking little I

notes, and since I was carrying a camera too, a couple of kids
thought I was gov’t and knew the names of everyone by
maybe telepathy‘? and was copying them down for the FBI.
Anyway, here are my notes.

Flags, sea of black and white ﬂags greet me, each with
the number of war dead. This is a revolution washing down
Geary, rolling, dancing. We walked for hours and hours nd
once I paused in a bar for a drink and the old drunks were
mostly hostile. But kids hung out of windows to wave and
cheer. There was a blind girl walking, and “four generations
of American for peace,” one of them in a wheelchair, and

every head, freak, hippy, queer, patriot, NLF_supporter,_

and their brothers, sisters, lovers, were there.

The air ahead trembled from a rock band playing from
an open truck. Sky clear, high clouds, lots of sun, very
bright. Everyone is walking with their own signs and push-
ing their own causes, just like in Russia when the April
revolution broke out. The air vibrates with music. Little girl
reaches up and touches cop’s pistol on his hip, he leans
down, pats her on head. The Christians are out with special
signs in hippy style about how only Jesus cansolve these
problems, and handing out their four page tabloid “Right
On” (I hope that was the name of it). See Ira Sandperl. Get
lost from Betty and John. See Ira again and Izzy from L.A.
I hadn’t see in years. Find Betty and John. Pass store with
sign in window “Make Wine, Not War.”

Everyone is cheerful except for a few leftists who knew
in their hearts the revolution isn’t supposed to be cheerful.
Two incidents stand out: twice, moving through a middle
class area, its windows largely empty and silent, vacant as
corporate faces, there are flags displayed and middle-age
rniddle-American women stand watching us. These are, of
course, the pigs, the enemy through whose territory we are
marching to victory. They have watched the line for long
enough to know something strange, is happening. Both
times, I looked uptoward them, myself high, high on the
demonstration, and gave them a big smile and a “V” sign, as
if they were our supporters, and both times, shyly, slowly,
the raised the hands back in a “V” sign and smiled. In fact I
was like some god danmed politician, V’ing everyone in
sight. Felt great. Second incident—same neighborhood—I
see a young girl, maybe 14, holding a Moratorium Flag in
one hand and in the other a sign saying in crude hand
writing “WE HAVE WATER FOR ALL DOGS”, which she
did, in bowls. Where else, where else but here would people
bring their danm dogs with them on a march and where else
would someone realize others were fool enough to bring
their danm pets and arrange for water. Frisco, I love you
almost enough to please your vanity and call you San
Francisco. ‘

We got to the park, with people everywhere and I lost
my films of that, and Betty and I are old radicals and can’t
stand speeches and leave and some cunning woman lays
herself onto John who stays behind. And Moratorium was
over, and, like D.C., we had won. Agnew doesn’t have a pot
to hiss in.

Bob Dckene. Dead at 235

Bob Ockene, one ofthe most beau-
tiful guys in the Movement, died a few
days ago of leukemia, at 35. Relatively
few people knew about him or what a
crucial role he played, and that’s the
way he wanted it. Most who did know
him thought of him as the only gen-
uine revolutionary editor in the pub-
lishing world. He was that, alright, but
much more besides.

Like most of us who are now over
30, Bob was at first an arm-chair rad-
ical. In his college days he spoke out
against McCarthyism and joined the
reform democrats but he did not really
yet understand that the whole‘capit-
alist-imperialist American system
would have to be smashed before we
could all relate to one another as total
human beings. Drafted during the
Korean war, all he thought he could
do was manipulate the hawks of the
time so he wouldn’t have to kill any
Koreans. But then, gradually, as Amer-
ica became more and more visably im-
perialistic and dehumanizing, Bob real-
ized he would have to fight at home,
in whatever way he could. At first, the
way he chose was very mild: he got a
job as a salesman in Doubleday Book-
store and kept trying to convince cus-
tomers to read ‘ Gandhi, Marx, Upton
Sinclair, Howard Fast and whoever
else he thought could sway their opin-
ion. Then he decided that not enough
meaningful books were being publish-
ed in America and got himself an edit-

. or’s job.

The more he became radical, the
less he was allowed to publish in the
regular big-time houses. Offered high
salaries if he would only be more com-
mercial, he sought out instead the
smaller houses where his pay was low
but his freedom high. In 1964 he be-

came managing editor of Grossman’s

and immediately went to work to‘

bring out the kind of books he
thought could begin to seriously put
into question America’s capitalist way

ikf life. Two of his accomplishments

then were Barbara Deming’s Prison
Notes and Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at
Any Speed. ’

But by then Bob was much more
committed than just to push books.
He was oneiof the founders of Vet-
erans and Reservists To End The War
In Vietnam, a backer of Liberation
magazine, one of the earliest street
people in the pacifist days of the
Movement. As an editor, then the ex-
ecutive editor, of the Bobbs-Merrill
Company, where he went after Gross-
man’s, he set about publishing The
Collected Essays of /1.]. Muste and
books by Seymour Hersh, Allen Gins-
berg, Chuck Stone, Dave Dellinger,
William Everson, David Solomon,_
Milton Kotler, Dr. Joel Fort, Sylvia
Meagher, Andrew Sarris, Dr. Harold
Abramson, Carl Oglesby, William Ap-
pleman Williams, and books on the
Yippies, on the Conspiracy, on the
New Mexicans, all by Movement
writers. When I returned from Hanoi
in 1967 and my regular publisher re-
fused to bring out my book on North
Vietnam, Bob immediately did' so,
agreeing that, though it would cut
down profits, we should put out a
simultaneous paper edition.

In the Spring of 1967, Bob helped
launch the Support-in-Action group
which eventually merged into N.Y. Re-
sist. Though he himself never sought
publicity he was perfectly willing to
face felony indictments and signed
statements making him liable to them.
Living very modestly in Brooklyn, he
poured most of his salary into the
Movement, first into Pacifist groups,
then also into more militant elements.
Recently his support went to the Con-
spiracy, to individuals arrested across
the country, to The Rat.

Most Yippies who knew Bob, of
course, knew him as one of the foun-
ders and a. tenacious participant in the
Youth International Party. But scores
of jailed militants across the country

will remember Bob on a more personal W

basis. Stu Albert, for example, was tel-

ling me in Chicago last week how, one

day when he was especially low during

his 45-day California jail term, a pack-

age from Bobbs-Merrill arrived full of

books; Bob used to send dozens of
such packages not only to friends but

to militants, such as the Panthers, he

had never met. He would always think

of that personal touch, not just be-

cause it was the kind of thing he could

do butbecause he was instinctively a

collective being. His pad was always

open to crashers, he was always ready

to help. Scores of militants across the

country have received checks from
Bob for their defense. Others for their

work. When I got busted and fired

from San Francisco State, Bob was the
first out-of-town caller—with offers of
money and a book contract. Even in
the last year, weakened by his illness
and knowing he was dying, he kept

phoning encouragement to militant

friends, arranging contracts for Move-
ment writers, organizing new actions
by those he could influence most, the
intellectuals, so many of whom were
kept from copping out by Bob’s con-
tinuing commitment in the face of’
death.

Last week in his room at Beth ls-
rael, in between terrifying pain and
semi-consciousness a few hours before
his death, he told his wife Ann and a
few friends what he wanted. For him-

‘self: to be cremated and his ashes tos-

sed into the woods (which will be
done in Allen Ginsberg’s free farm in
upstate New York). For anyone else
who would like to show thier sym-
pathy: to send donations either to the
Rat (241 East 14th St., New York,
N.Y.) or to the Alpert-Hughey-Melville
Legal Defense Fund (Box 544, Stuy-
vesant Station, New York, N.Y.

Right on, Bob.

ARMS RACE
GONE BESERK

Facts and figures showing that the
international arms race h.as gone com-
pletely out-of-control are presented in
a 440-page report issued by the Stock-
holm International Peace Research In-
stitute two days after the start of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in
Helsinki. Gunnar Myrdal is the Institu-
te’s chairman and Robert Neil its dir-
ector.

Ofthe $159.3 billion spent for mili-

“$79.3 billion and the Soviet Union
$39.8 billion. In the U.S. the percen-
tage of the national product spent on
armaments has risen from 1.5% before
World War I to 10% in the period
following World War II. )

The sharpest rise in military spend-
ing has occurred since 1965. At pre-
sent the world is spending more for
military purposes than its total pro-
duction of goods and services at the
start of the century.

The report warned that within
three to six months, U.S. development
of multiple warheads would reach “a
point of no return” at which the So-
viet Union will be unwilling to halt
development of comparable weapons
and counterweapons. This would en-
tail test explosions of hydrogen war-

heads. The report noted that nuclear ‘

testing by both the U.S. and the Soviet
Union has been stepped-up consid-
erably since the 1963 Test Ban Treaty
barring such explosions in the atmo-
sphere.

Draft Lottery:

Russian Roulette

Have you dear WIN reader, just
heaved a loud sigh of relief as the draft
drawing on the first of December left
you (or your dear one) on one of the
“safe” groups? Do you feel almost not
paranoid for a change? Are you think-
ing of dropping out of college, now
that, draftwise, you can afford it? Are
you toying with the idea of dropping
your appeal case and all its hassles?
Are you considering not worrying
about your deferment, not worrying
about jail?

Before you do anything rash and
probably fatal (like any of the above
alternatives) be forewarned: the draft
lottery is nothing but a hasty, danger-
ously simple government concession, a
mere bone thrown only to appease
public opinion. It was conceived in
great haste, and its apparent simplicity
conceals enormous loopholes, much
figure juggling and a basic theory that
is not borne out by reality.

For example, if you live in a big-
city area and feel quite safe being on
the middle and bottom thirds: big-city
draftboards will continue drafting to
capacity. With a complex urban popu-
lation, they are loaded with defer-
ments, appeals, delinquencies and
other special cases. Their l-A pool is

. accordingly. smaller, and they‘ will end

up taking a large number of men from
the second and third groups, pretty
much the same men who would have
been drafted under the old system.
And that means you . . . .

Also, be forewarned that it will be
much harder to get deferments. This
January, Selective Service will meet to
discuss and revamp all deferments, and
make them tighter.

In the next few months much more
will be found out about the new draft
law. Only by keeping in touch with
draft-counseling organizations and

 

reading up on the new developments,
as the law is applied all over the coun-
try, will you be sure of where you
stand in relation to the draft.

ECO ACTION IN CHICAGO

Some people in Chicago, tired of
waiting for the never-to-happen legal
prosecution of air polluters, have de-
cided to do something about it them-
selves.

The Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare has determined that a
sulfur dioxide content in the air above
1.1 parts, per million is detrimental to
health. The sulfur dioxide content in

, the Chicago air is often as high as 4 to

12 parts per million. Sulfur dioxide is
a chemical in soft coal that becomes

I toxic when burned and mixed with

other chemicals in the atmosphere.
Commonwealth Edison is respon-
sible for dumping 50% of this deadly

chemical found in the air around Chi-

cago. The plan is to demand that Com-
monwealth Edison, by November 25,
1969, start using, and continue to use,
coal with a sulfur content of not more

[ than 1.5% by weight. If, by November

25, they have not announced through
news media that they have made this

. change, consumers will not pay their

light bills in December. If, by January

I 1, they still have not started using the

high grade coal, consumers will pay
their light bills but will not send in the
IBM card with their payments. By not
sending in the IBM card, their ac-
counting system will be jeopardized.
They need the IBM card for their com-
puters. This would be continued if
necessary in February.

They also ask the individuals to de-

1 mand that the current legislature

change the laws to prohibit shipment

1 into the Chicago area of coal with a

sulfur content above 1.5% by weight.
Mr. Clem Stava.of Commonwealth Ed-
ison is on the Chicago Air Pollution
Board. His resignation should be de-
manded.‘ There will be no organization
for Commonwealth Edison to nego-
tiate with. They will have to deal with
the public, and keep the public infor-

. med as to what they are doing by

using newspaper, advertising or other

mass media. 1 —VER
FOR BUSTS OUT

The Fellowship of Reconciliation is

a coalition of religious pacifist groups

that hasa reputation of being among
the most conservative and least acti-
vist-oriented of pacifist organizations.
On November 21 its National Council
met to discuss policies for the coming
months. It voted to work for the re-
peal of the draft, an end to the trial of
the Conspiracy, the freeing of Bobby
Seale, an end to government attempts
at repression and amnesty for all poli-
tical prisoners including: those. in exile
or in jail for drug violations, resisters,
deserters and “conscientious pro-
testors” imprisoned for destroying
selective service records. The FOR sin-
gled out black leaders, especially mem-
bers of the Black Panthers, as having
been jailed on charges growing out of
their political activity. At the same
time, the FOR issued a strong rebuke
to the government for its “attempts to
abridge free speech” and announced
plans to ask major organizations, par-
ticularly religious groups, to join in
protest. MJ.

LOCAL BOARD NO 53 . . .
Revisited

Six months ago (WIN, June ’69),
three young men, Ieslie and Jonath.an
Bayless and Michael Bransome invaded
local board no. 53 in Silver Springs,
Md. and mutilated the draft files with
their own blood and black paint. Les-
lie and Michael were sent to prison.
Jonathan was placed on probation. To-
day, Veteran’s Day, 1969, in an atmo-
sphere of misdirected patriotism, sur-

rounded by rallying veterans whose
memories of the horror of war has
dimmed with the years, three young
men, Jonathan Bayless, Robert Brake
and Robert Malecki stand accused of
re-affirming their loyality to a set of
principles somewhat different from
the graying gentlemen parading about
the Washington monument this after-
noon.

When I awoke this morning I
turned on the radio and heard a bored

announcer tell me death board no. 53

had again been raided. The files had
been removed from the office, ten-
derly laid upon the railroad tracks and
ground up by a passing train. The an-
nouncer identified the three suspects
as “a youth from Northern Virginia
and two men from Cleveland.” The
night before, Jon had introduced me
to two Bobs from Cleveland, in town
for the November March. I sat down
and said to myself, “My God, he’s
done it again. The tool, the beautiful
lovable fool.” Jonathan is my friend
and my next response was anger, anger
not at him, not at his apparent action,
not even at forces which, given their
nature and given his nature was bound
to produce something like this again.
The anger was with myself because I
had failed to convince him that he had
discharged any responsibility he ever
had to peace, had not convinced him
that he was much more valuable free,
sending out to a world sorely in need
of it, rays of sunshine and love.

I spent the day on a picnic alter-
nately laughing at the antics of my
friends and brooding on where Jon
and Bob and Bob were. Later I went
over to St. Francis House to share a
loaf of sadness with others who knew
Jon and Bob and Bob. How do we
feel? What are we thinking? We are
thinking about Bob and Jon and Bob
and we are feeling robbed and angry

over losing still another three of our
_ friends in a seemingly never-ending

struggle. We’re not going to see Jon
and Bob and Bob for a long time. We
don’t want them in jail and they don’t
belong in jail. Jon and Bob and Bob
committed no crime. Their irnprison-
ment is not a just act.

And I feel in myself a growing sense
of fear and frustration over every one
of our people who is in jail. None of
them belong there. Yet that is where
the best of the movement is. Can we
second-raters face these people when
our ends are affected? Can we in fact
create the society we want with these,
the best of us, where they are? Will the
type of world we build be satisfactory
to these men? Will our work measure
up to their deeds?

POSTSCRIPT: Is the above defeat-
ist? It’s a first reaction, all of it true,
all of it valid—as far as it goes. But as
in every action, the impulse of_ life that
gave birth to it makes itself felt sooner
or later. So we have dinner and start to
talk over what needs to be done. We
must raise $30,000 to bail our friends
out, we make plans to do so. We dis-
cover that what happened isn’t very
clear. We discuss the few vague de-
tails——how our friends were stopped
for singing “I’ve been working on the
railroad” and we alter the lines of the
song to read,

'I’ve been working on the draft

Can’t you see the files a-ﬂying, a-"

ﬂying far away . . .
And our anger and our sorrow are
submerged and we think we’ll raise

$30,000 (somehow) and have our

friends with us again (for awhile) and
that somehow, someday they’ll all be
free again—Rick and Leslie and Mike
and Jon and Bob and Bob and all the
others will be free again—including
those who chained them and led them
behind those gray prison walls. If you
can help us free them, help underwrite
the responsibility—do. The address is

DRAFT CARDS

STILL BURNING
About 250 people gathered at Man-

hasset, N.Y. Draft Board No. 3 Friday, '

November 29th to demonstrate against
the draft and to show their support of
David Chawes, Jerry Elmer and Vicky
Rippberger who were to burn draft
cards there.

David Chawes, a student at Harpur

college, who had burned his registra-

tion in August, explained why he was
now burning his classiﬁcation card. He
said that the Armed Forces, as the
main purveyor of U.S. imperialism
abroad must be hindered in its actions.
The people in the U.S. should contin-
ue to take actions to hinder the war
machine and at the same time build a
broad-based movement to destroy U.S.
imperialism. By publicly refusing to
cooperate with the draft, we are joining
and building that movement.

Vicky Rippberger, from Atlanta
WIN, burned the draft card of Howard
Schneider, a graduate student at C0-
lumbia, who was unable to attend in
person. She said that women should
not hide behind their immunity to the

draft, and that resistance work is not.‘

only the responsibility of men who
face the draft, but of all those who
have a conscientous objection to the
war. '

The third person to burn his card
was Jerry Elmer, a staff member at
WRL. Jerry refused to register in Aug-
ust and instead spent one weekfasting
and leaﬂetting in front of the Manhas-
set draft board. He was registered “in
absentia.” He said that unless people
accept public risk and act boldly

against the S.S.S. and the powers of
death which control our lives, there

may be no future for man. He called"

into question the seriousness of the
Movement today and the willingness

of each individual to take risks and '

conscientious actions for the ideals
they profess. Jerry was helped in burn-
ing his card by Wendy Schwartz of the
N.Y. GI Coffeehouse Project.

The cards were burned in silence
after Father Paul Mayer, legal coordin-
ator of the Catonsville 9 and Milwau-
kee 14, said a short prayer.

Gls FAST

The Thanksgiving Day fast, init-
iated by Gls at a field evacuation hos-
pital in Pleiku and spreading to a num-
ber of other units in Vietnam, was
described by one reporter as “the most
notable antiwar activity by Gls in
South Vietnam since a handful of sol-
diers donned black armbands during
the moratorium demonstration on Oc-
tober 15.”

At Pleiku all but 8 of the 141 sol-
diers in the 71st Medical Detachment
of the 44th Medical Group were ab-
sent from the messhall for Thanks-

giving Dinner. A number of those on-

KP duty also fasted.

In an open letter to President
Nixon, the group requested “that our
Thanksgiving rations be distributed
among the poor of the U.S. and Viet-
nam.” The letter pointed out that “So
long as American soldiers continue to
fight in a senseless war that cannot be
won, we the undersigned fell that we
have very little for which to be thank-
ful.”

ND BUTTON COSTS GI
HIS CITIZENSHIP

Because Sp/4 William Mahalas had
the audacity to wear an ND button, he
was denied U.S. citizenship at a group
swearing—in ceremony in Honolulu.

- Relating the incident on November
21 upon return to Vietnam, Mahalas, a
refugee from Soviet Ukraine during
the Nazi occupation, said: “They [the
2 sponsoring noncommissioned Army
officers] got to me and said: ‘Hey,
wait a minute,’ and they asked me
why I was wearing the peace symbol. I
said lots of guys wear it in Vietnam.
And they said their idea of a peace
symbol was riots, demonstrations and
SDS. They asked me if I would over-
throw the govermnent. I said I

couldn’t believe it and I said if it
makes you feel any better, I’ll take it
off.”

That Mahalas had, in effect, been
denied citizenship for wearing the ND
button, was confirmed by Pacific Ar-
my Headquarters in Honolulu.

REPRESSION IN QUEBEC

During the last six to eight months,
there has been a series of acts of state
violence in Quebec directed ‘against

anti-war and anti-poverty groups. Of-

fices have been raided and activists
harassed by police. The city of Mon-
treal has passed a law banning all dem-
onstrations_and large public assemblies
for a period from thirty days to six
months.

Recently, Michel Chartrand, a paci-
fist-socialist leader in Quebec and Pres-
ident of the Conseil Centrale of the
Confederation of National Trade
Unions in Montreal was arrested for
“subversion.” Bail has been set at

$2000, but he has been forbidden to ,

speak publicly. There is a possibility of
14 years imprisonment.

Chartrand was one of the speakers
at the recent WRI conference in Haver-
ford, Pa. Readers are urged to protest
his arrest by writing

Hon. Jean Jacques Bertrand, prime
minister,
National Assembly, Quebec City,“
Quebed.

FORESTS ENDANGERED

Conservationists and eco-activists have
sounded the alarm bell against the Na-
tional Timber Supply Act. This bill-
currently before Congress—is spon-
sored by a coalition of timber indus-
trialists. It calls for a total re-eval-
uation of current laws protecting the
U.S. wilderness, and may well pave the
way to turning over public forests to
wholesale rape by profit-hungry lum-
ber magnates.

Activists in the Pacific Northwest
are urging anyone who has ever enjoy-
ed a walk in the woods to join conser-
vation demonstrations and to flood
Congress with letters opposing the bill.

YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL

Quakers have been in the relief
business for a long time. In addition to
the inherent humanitarian nature of
relief work they talk of how those that
are helped today may be in a position
to help others in the future. A great
» deal of weight is placed on the positive
contacts Quaker relief work has gener-
ated over the years. These contacts
have helped the Quakers further their
work in non-ideologically motivated

relief.
In gratitude for the relief work

——Jerry Coffin

A few months ago I went to Detroit
for a RPM (Revolutionary Press and
Media) conference, and Maris sug-
gested that since WIN was paying my
way, I ought to take the opportunity
to look up some local WRL people
and, you know, find out where the
movement was at in the Motor City.

So Ralph gave me Carol Andreas’
address and I went over there for din-
ner, and we talked about telephone
tax resistance organizing, and coalition
politics, and women’s liberation—that
last being something Carol (you know,
a sociology teacher and a woman and
all) is really into. She had some pretty
heavy things. to say, and I decided I
ought to do one cooking column just
to prove I’m not one of those, you
know, “male chauvinists.” So I asked
her for the recipe for the plum thing
she had made for desert, and not being
as bitter about all those years of op-
pression as some, she was willing to
give it to me:

Pluma Mousse

6 Santa Rosa plums

5 cps water

3 tbspns cornstarch

3/: cp sugar

‘I: cp cream

Boil plums in water until
mushy. Combine other ingredients and
add gradually to plum mixture, bring-
ing to boil again.

I never tried to make it (cooking’s
not my thing, you know?) but I re-
member you can serve it hot or chil-
led, and it’s especially nice by candle-
light. I mean, we’re all part of the
same revolution, aren’t we?

INDIANS LIBE RATE ALCATRAZ been quarreling over what to do with

More than 350 American Indians
with reinforcements arriving daily have
reclaimed Alcatraz Island in San Fran-
cisco Bay, “in the name of all Ameri-
can Indians by right of discovery,” and
have occupied the barren former fed-

" eral prison since taking it over at

dawn, November 20th. A Call for a
Great Pow Wow has brought Indians
to the island from as far away as Alas-
ka, New Mexico, Oklahoma and New

. York.

A proclamation issued on the day
of the invasion declared the Indians’
willingness to purchase Alcatraz for
$24 in glass beads and red cloth, a
precedent set by the white man’s pur-
chase of similar island about 30 years
ago. “Our offer of $1.24 per acre is
greater than the 47¢’ per acre that the
white man is now paying California
Indians for their land.”

Citing a treaty signed with the
Sioux in 1868, the young invaders
claim that Sioux tribes were promised
first right to unused surplus property,
and that when the Federal prison was
abandoned in 1964 they should have
been offered the land.

Powerful business interests have

Alcatraz. The city’s tourist-profit-
oriented rulers favor some sort of plas-
tic recreation site, while Texas oil in-
terests have lobbied in Washington for
the sale of the island to real estate
developers.

Local officials seem to be waiting
word from Secre.tary of the Interior
Walter Hickel in Washington before ex-
pelling the Indians. The Indians want
an audience with Hickel on Alcatraz,
but he has refused to talk with the
Indians on their terms. Tremendous
Bay Area support has been gathered
through the overground and under-
ground media and from the move-
ment.

The federal government’s initial re-
sponse to the Indian action was a par-
tial and short-lived blockade of‘ the
island, but ingenious boat-owners were
able to get supplies through to the
Indians. One boat was rammed by a
Coast Guard cutter before the block-
ade was stopped. Later, the govern-
ment pumped water on to the island
from a barge.

In their proclamation, the In-
dians—-many of whom are from Native
American student groups at UCLA and

;changes

Berkeley—said:

“We feel that this so-called Alcatraz
Island is more suitable for an Indian
reservation, as determined by the
white man’s own standards. By this we
mean that this place resembles most
Indian reservations in that:

1. It is isolated from modern facil-
ities and without adequate means of
transportation.

2. It has no fresh running water.

3. It has inadequate sanitation facil-
ities.

4. There are no oil or mineral
rights. .

5. There is no industry and so un-
employment is very great.

6. There are no health care facil-
ities.

7. The soil is rocky and non-pro-
ductive; and the land does not support
game.

8. There are no educational. facil-
ities.

9. The population has always ex-
ceeded the land base.

10. The population has always been
held as prisoners and kept dependent
on others. _ '

WIN Magazine:

I just got your last number of the
magazine, revealing that Paul Good-
man, whom I’ve read and admired, is a
homosexual boy raper along with other
rapers of that breed. I’ve sent you
some money at times but now I’m
through. If I thought that all leftist
groups were the same as your magazine
indicated, I would give them up in-
stantly. I believe in the revolt of the
young people but unless they improve
on their elders, why bother to rebel?
Please take my name off your list and
do not send any more to me.

With complete disgust,
Josephine Terrill
LosAngeles, Calif.
Dear WIN:

Whenever I wonder what else the
peace movement can say that’s new,
you come up with a special issue that’s
vital.

What a magnificent article by David
McReynolds~a piece of his soul, hon-
est, fragile, intense. His guts are over-
shadowed only by his humanity.

And the fine, warm and loving
piece by Paul Goodman, a friend of
mine, although he may not know it.

Paul should, of course, be president,

although he doesn’t deserve such~pun—
ishment and would get spiritually or
physically assassinated.

Cocteau is beautiful, and the.,cov-
ers, photos of David, Cesar, Dallas Po-
lice Girl/Guy.

WIN has won another in a series of
battles on the side of life, humanness
and loving. Feelingly,

Dear Sirs, '

I recently applied for a subscription
to your publication believing it to be
interesting and informative in the field
of social change, “Peace and Freedom
through Nonviolent Action”. I judged

L30

the merit of WIN Magazine on the
January 1, 1969 issue which dealt with
community farms. I found this issue" to
be a good publication in terms of so-
cial comment andthus entered a sub-
scription. The ﬁrst issue arrived today
and has created some serious prob-
lems.

The present issue deals with homo-
sexuality, a subject that, despite its
controversial nature, I feel should not
be hidden. However, on page 23 you
published a photo of three nude males
in an advertisement which is, I think,
very poor judgment. I an 17 years old
and live in a very conservative com-
munity, and based on this issue, my

parents have decided I must end my

subscription. If you feel that your lib-
eral and/or radical viewpoints should
be heard in conservative areas by young
people, then may I suggest that you
abstain from such photographs? If
your attitude is one of total indiscre-
tion,‘ then I -am afraid you will ﬁnd
yourself only appealing to a limited
faction of the public (those who al-
ready agree).

Please "end my subscription as soon
as possible and feel free to reply to my
tSU88eSti0I1- Sincerely,

Paul Schraub
T ustin, California

‘Brothers and Sisters,

Somewhat, I suppose, like David
McReyno1ds I had mixed reactions
when I was informedthat WIN was
coming out with a special issue on the
homosexual and his oppressed state in
society. I wondered if the time was
right for such a step within the Move-
ment. I feared that such an issue might
prove divisive and hurt more than it
helped. Now that I have seen the issue
and obtained the opinions of friends
on it, I think you were right after all.

I am reminded of something e.e.
cummings once said, “When one per-
son oppresses many people, everybody
cries ‘tyranny’! but tyranny occurs
just as truly when many people op-
press one single individual. . . and
nobody even whimpers.”

Peace and Love,
Richard Chinn
Chicago, Ill
Dear Sir: .

I was favorably impressed by the
November 15 issue of WIN with its
first-person accounts of the experience
of hor_nosexuals.,H‘owever, I think that

homosexuals often “fail to see the for-
est for the trees,” and that the primary
problem is not homosexuality, per se,
as much as it is just plain sexuality.
As a sexually mature divorcee I could
write just as heart-rending an account
of my own experiences, as I am sure
any sexually awakened person who has
not worked out a long-term satisfying
relationship with a sexual mate, in our
culture, could do. Our culture exalts
love goddesses (and gods), love potions
and lotions, and all kinds of alluring
bait, for the very reason that sexually
apathetic people enjoy titillation and
fantasy more than they do the down-
to—the-earth real thing.

Let’s not work just for the rights of
homosexuals, but for the sexual rights
of everyone. Let’s throw out the
ﬂashy lures and develop the basic sex-
uality which is a healthy part of every
human being, be he male or female,

heterosexual or homosexual. I suggest ‘

that the liberation movement, in gen-
eral, and not just a portion of the
peace movement, adopt as its slogan

“Make Love Not War.”
Sincerely yours,
Marjorie S. Baker
Brentwood, M0.

Dear David McReynolds,

This is at day of signaled growth for
me—-growth of arrogance. For I’m dar-
ing to accuse David McReynolds, of all
people, of unfairness when he bets
only on the kids. You predict that
your contemporaries will be “upset”
and “bafﬂed” by your notes in WIN.
“Instructed” is the more just word,
instructed once again in decency and
integrity, in the hard work of re-
maining an entire man in a piecemeal
world. Year after year of articles in the
Voice and WIN, and these Notes—al1
coming from the same scrupulous clar-
ity, the same man.

Of course, you’re right in betting
on those under 2S.'But they are not

a10I1€- Sincerely and in Peace,
Henry Braun
Temple University, Philadelphia
Sirs,

I never write letters to the editor,
but I felt that I must congratulate you
on your current issue regarding homo-
sexuality. I am deeply impressed, as a
Black man and a believer in liberation,
with your courageous open and consis-
tently freedom oriented issue. As usual
you are all right on. Keep up the good

  
  
 
  
  
  
   
 
  

work. Ignore the ﬂak, static, and bull-
shit.

With thanks for such a good issue.

In peace, freedom and love,

Dear WIN,

Thank-you for your good conser-
vation and homosexual issues. You are
becoming a magazine I not only enjoy
but need.

I’d.like to say a couple of things

homosexual issue. I was both moved
and enlightened by it. By the latter, I
mean the piece helped me to see male
homosexuality as a way of being, a

l

about Dave McReynolds’ piece in the '

I

of being. Why should a man of his
dignity and worth have to make a pub-
lic disclaimer of belonging to the fat-
uous gay crowd‘? As a middleaged,
middle-class, almost square heterosex-
ual female, I don’t have to go around
disclaiming association with the
beauty-salon-Bergdorf-Goodman gang.
I also am slightly offended by the use
of the word “queer”, especially as a
substantive. To me, it is a pejorative
and without dignity, and as a substan-
tive, it tends to define the whole man
by one aspect of his physical and emo-

. tional life.

On the personal suffering which
both Dave and Paul Goodman write
about, I suspect that to some extent,
caught as they are in their categories,
they mistake its origin. Just on the
evidence of the articles, it seems to me
that while some of the misery they
describe undoubtedly derives from so-
cial pressures, secrecy, etc., and some
from guilt, shame, repressions, some is
merely that misery that does after all
accompany unremittingly urgent sex-

3 uality and being in love or looking for

love. .I mean, with all the romantic
and/or neo-Freudian glorification of
sex and love-sickness, we tend to for-
get that they are exhausting, preoccu-
pying, in short, a nuisance, whatever
the sex of the lover or object. This is
so even though they are a nuisance
that we escape at peril to our human-
ity. But still, most of us get more relief
from the nuisance as the decades go by
than Dave and Paul apparently have.

One more thing. About Dave’s al-
leged cowardice. He seems to have
some kind of simplistic notion that
courage and cowardice are a function
of the fear threshold. 1 don’t know
exactly how to define the courage-
cowardice axis, but I think it is in the
second or third rank of moral equa-
tions. T personally am afraid of diving
head first into a swimming pool and
even more afraid of going in airplanes,
and I have several times been idiotical-.
ly not afraid of wicked crackers and
cops, and I don’t think these idiosy-
ncracies say anything one way or
another about my moral fiber. But
then I think men, whatever their sex-

 
  
 

,f way of suffering, and a way of loving l

ts that are not in the end that different

Le from mine (female heterosexuality).

(. I’m afraid that for even the most liber-

y ated of us (not me), the squares and j

3, the deviants alike, just the words and i

;t A the going rules set up barriers that E

1. bind us to our commonness.

._e I was made angry, though, by

» David’s undertone of apology for him- -
self, for writing the piece, for his way '

Dear WIN:

I’m motivated to write this by the
excessive romanticism I’ve been read-

ing (in your otherwise excellent maga-

zine about “communes”). The fact re-
mains that just owning your own land,
house, etc. doesn’t mean you’re free to
develop experimental forms of inter-
personal relationships. The surround-
ing community still has virtually all
the political power, lawmaking ability,
and the ever-present police power to
enforce its will. I too feel that new
forms are needed, but a secure envir-
onment is necessary to develop them.
Therefore for communes to be a suc-
cessful vehicle, they must be located in
such numbers, either in terms of den-
sity or size, so as to gain political con-
trol of the jurisdictional area, e.g.'
minor civil division. Without such con-
trol over their fate, those who inhabit
the communes are reduced to cower-
ing individuals, huddling, hiding, hop-
ing to avoid the adverse sentiment
which might lead to harrasment or vio-
lence. I merely ask the question of
how one can develop new relationships

ment when one’s very existance is in

communities are antithetical to the
very nature of communes.

Dear Editors:

We wish to take this opportunity to
thank your and all of Steve Trimm’s
friends for the kindness shown him
during his peace movement activities.
As you may know-he felt very deeply
about the peace and civil rights move-
ments and wrote extensively on these
subjects. This may be at an end.

On Oct. 10th Steve disappeared and
there is some ‘evidence that he may be
dead. This was the day after his appeal
of his conviction of a four year sen-
tence on draft refusal was _ turned
down by the appeals court in‘N.Y.
City. He has not been in touch with us
since the night of Oct. 9,-the night the
news on his appeal was broadcast.

We know how much his friends
meant to him and we are grateful to
them on his behalf.

Sincerely yours,
Wayne and Lynn Trimm

Gentlemen and ladies:

I have read WIN for the first time
(December issue), and am convinced——
a little bit of alright!

Incidentally, I would like to offer a
correction for the listing you pub-
lished for our address in the Dec. issue.
You listed:

G.A. Carter, Box 2143

El Paso Texas 79951
The correct listing should read:

We would appreciate your printing this
correction in your next edition, as we
no longer receive mail addressed to the

Dear WIN,

The G.I. issue of.WIN is excellent.
However, there is one very serious
omission. Specifically, in the list of
organizations to which servicemen can
turn for legal assistance you omit
SLAP (Southern Legal Assistance Pro-
ject, 8591/2 Hunter St., Atlanta, Ga.
30314; telephone (404) 876-2159)

For a small organization SLAP has
handled an unbelievalbe number of mi-
litary cases. Moreover, SLAP is in the
heart of the South. It is far closer to
far more bases than organizations with
their headquarters in New York City. I
guess the only disadvantage of being in
Atlanta is that so few people know of
its work.

The legal work of SLAP is handled
by two very able attorneys, Howard
Moore, Jr., and Peter Rindskopf. Fi-
nancing SLAP is a real problem, espe-
cially since movement big-wigs have
tended to ignore SLAP’s work.

Sincerely,
Henry Bass

Dear Mr. Editor,

With reference to your new issue on
the Gls, will you please make the fol-
lowing correction:

American Deserter Committee

Dear Win, 2nd Dec. 1969
Who is Ofelia Alayeto, who writes

under the heading, “Canadian Con-

science” in your Dec. 1st edition?

I don’t think she is terribly familiar
with the Ottawa scene, to judge by her
snide remark about the “city’s tiny,
inbred radical movement.” In point of
fact, for a small community, Ottawa
has a remarkable history of continuous
peace action. My own committee
started out over 10 years ago, as “The
Committee against radiation Hazards,”
and has managed to move with the
times through several changes, first as
“Canadian Campaign for Nuclear Dis-
armament,” then as “The Ottawa
Committee to End the War in Viet-
nam,” and how under our present
name, Ottawa Committee "for Peace
and Liberation.

It is quite true than 10 years ago we
were a very tiny minority, and no
doubt clung to one another—a fairly
human reaction when perhaps half a
dozen people could be expected to
turn out to a demonstration. However
it is fairly significant that we have re-
tained many of the original activists,
while at the same time having greatly
increased our membership and influ-
ence in the city.

There are of course other groups,
which your correspondent seems quite
unaware of—“Voice of Women,”
Quakers, Unitarians and the student
Vietnam Mobilization joined together
for a large march and rally for the
Nov. Moratorium. Sometimes we un-
dertake actions together, sometimes
separately—-which again speaks for a
very flexible approach.

From my own experience as secre-
tary'of all the 4 various forms of our
present committee, our main difficulty
has been to co-ordinate work with a

1 simple fact—each year we have to get

to know a new “crop” of students-
and unfortunately I find they are only
active at certain times of the year-
when not on holiday or studying for
exams!

The effort of a few people during
the visit of Andrei Gromyko, was a
very small action indeed—-the main ac-
tivities over the past year in Ottawa
have consisted of:

1. Presentation of 2 Briefs to our Gov-

ernment. One on External Affairs and

Defence. The other on the position of

9 draft dodgers and deserters~which was

directly instrumental in altering the
government’s position to a more fa-
vourable one.

In this connection I might mention
that I personally started the program
of help for draft dodgers some 2 years

ago, which was quickly taken over by

Prof. James Wilcox and his wife—who
have performed incredible feats during
this time.

2. 3 demonstrations outside the Amer-
ican Embassy over the summer-2
visits inside the Embassy. These 3 de-
monstrations took place for the Hiro-
shirna/Nagasaki anniversary, the Aleu-
tian testing and the Oct. Moratorium.
3. 3 weekend conferences, one to get
out a new policy statement (I enclose
copy) and one on the draft.

I would suggest that Ofelia Alayeto
gets in touch with me, we can find
plenty of work for her to do-—and if
she is concerned about us being “in-
bred” I am surprised she hasn’t come
forward to contact us before—-as other
new members do. Nearly every day, a
new American arrival or a student
interested in peace work contacts me
and joins -the group—I don’t call that
being inbred.

My own position has been clear and

overdose of Clique was found in the

bloodstream.

The epitaph reads:

Died of the very ailment it was
trying to eliminate.

Dear WINers:

The following is a summary of an
autopsy on the body of New York
Resistance.

In general, the results of this autop-
sy seem to oppose the findings of
those former staff members who wrote
the obits of the group that appeared in
a previous issue. No doubt this is a side
effect of the disease that struck this
unfortunate and has caused loss of
memory among the survivors of the
disaster.

1. Liver: found to be suffused with
poison Ego.

2. Heart: shattered by hostile vibes.

3. Head: broken by an alienated in-
strument.

4. Stomach: filled with hard pellets
of petty Bullshit.

The whole nervous system suffered
from a basic lack of Love and a huge

ized folk” can send money in, but at
Sandstone no such luck.

I am not saying people should not
send money, but be ready to get it
back. And by all means put your re-
turn address on it.

In order to get money to political
prisoners we are attempting to set up
an on-going'Prisoners Emergency Fund
in this region. It will be a central fund
which gets donations and distributes
money to prisoners through “author-
ized correspondents”.

DAYS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
1970 WAR RESISTERS LEAGUE CALENDAR

ll

. . Law never made men a whit more just; and, by
means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed
are daily made the agents of injustice . . . How does it
become a man to behave toward this American gov-
ernment today? I answer, that he cannot without dis-
grace be associated with it.”

Henry David Thoreau,

from ”On the Duty of Civil Disobedience”
published in 1849

The 15th edition of the War Resisters League Calendar is
given over, entirely to Thoreau's classic essay On the Duty
of Civil Disobedience, which is printed in its entirety as a
part of the Calendar.

This essay touched Gandhi and Tolstoy and, while large-
ly ignored when it was first published more than a century
ago, eventually had an impact which helped secure Thor-
eau a lasting place in American history. And that is how the
essay is generally treated—as a safe part of our history. So
safe, in fact, that several years ago the U.S. government is-
sued a commemorative stamp in Thoreau's honor.

The War Resisters League has taken Thoreau's essay and
’’illustrated’’ it with some sixty photographs of acts of civil
disobedience that have taken place in the past twenty years.
An essay can be called a ”classic” only if it is alive. The 1970
Peace Calendar shows how alive Thoreau's essay is, and
how powerful a weapon civil disobedience is, living on
today in dozens and hundreds of young Thoreaus in action
against war and racism.

The photographs for the Calendar were selected and the
book designed by Mark Morris who also wrote a thoughtful
preface. In addition the Calendar has:

..a page for every week of the year

..a facing page of text and photographs

..a directory of peace periodicals and organizations, Amer-

ican and overseas_. with blank pages for notes

. .128 pages, 5'/2" x 8'/2", wire-bound and flat—opening, the

Calendar pages of which can easily be removed when the

year is over, leaving a bound volume for your permanent
library.

The Peace Calendar is a unique and inexpensive gift
that will be remembered every day of the year.

SECOND CLASS POSTAGE PAID AT N.Y.. N.Y. I000]

_ ot long ago I was invited to speak about women’s
liberation at a labor union conference. When I arrived
someone handed me a resolution on male supremacy which
had been passed the previous evening. Delighted that the
issue came up, I read the resolution with enthusiasm—then
my heart sank. If such a resolution had been written about
blacks and racism, everyone would have been outraged, but
in 1969 “1iberal” resolutions on women don’t elicit such a
response. '

It said that “male supremacist attitudes (italics are mine)
toward women predominate among union members. . . ”
and then went on to propose that within union ranks
“every effort should be made to initiate discussions on this

subject,” and “programs designed to raise the issue in an

instructive and constructive way should be undertaken.”
There are not male supremacist “attitudes”. We live in a

sexist system! This is not by any means just “attitudes”—it

is the economic and psychological oppression and exploita-
tion of women. Like racism, sexism splits people from each
other for the proﬁt of a few. It is an ideology that is used
by and reinforces a ruling elite—always men—and keeps the
rest of us impoverished, exploited and warring amongst
ourselves.

Women’s‘ Liberation emerged because we live under a
sexist system. A recent article in Time Magazine tried to say
the same thing, but it defined sexism as consumerism and
women’s liberation as a non-political fight by militant bra-
burners and karate-choppers to eliminate symbolic woman-
hood. Time is trying, as it always has, to make an explosive
political movement apolitical in content. But it won’t suc-
ceed because women are talking about real oppression and
are enraged about the real conditions of their lives.

What is women’s liberation? It is simply organized rage
against real oppression. Recently a woman phoned to say
she had just had an abortion at one of the best hospitals in
the District of Columbia. Because she couldn’t find a doc-
tor to help her before, she couldn’t have the abortion until
her ﬁfth month of pregnancy. She therefore had to have a
more complicated and dangerous saline injection, rather
than a simple D and C. The saline solution, when injected
into the womb, brings on labor contractions in several
hours to several days thereafter. The woman had to wait in
the hospital until the fetus was expelled, and for the entire
operation she paid the exhorbitant fee of $1,000, in ad-
vance, not counting the time she lost from work, etc.

The ‘doctor she went to, an ob./gyn. who practices at
that hospital, didn’t let her know when to enter the hos-
pital until three hours prior to the time he could see her. He
told her nothing about the procedure, only that when she

went into labor she might ask a nurse for a pain-killer. She ‘

waited in terror, not knowing what would happen, on the
maternity ward watching newborns come and go until she
aborted. She was treated like someone’s dead aurn hidden
in a closet. Nurses brought her food only when she rang
persistently to ask for it, but she was given no other
attention.

When she finally went into labor three days later she was
in great pain. The nurse refused to give her any drugs; no
doctor was phoned. When the nurse finally came to her
room about an hour after she first rang, she angrily gave her
a bedpan and told her to call after the fetus was expelled
There, alone in her bed, the woman went through several

4

hours of labor, had her five month old fetus in the bedpan,
and two hours after the ordeal was over, the nurse finally
came to take the pan away.

This woman had to stay in the bed with the bloody fetus
in the pan the whole time since she was too weak to move.
No antibiotics were given, and she was sent home several
hours afterward. She later developed high fever and some
infection, and was finally treated by her family doctor since
the ob/gyn was not available.

I repeat: this was not a charity case in a city hospital.
This was a $1,000 operation at the city’s best. You can
imagine what happens at D.C. General, the public hospital,
but most women never get to a hospital at all.

This is the oppression women’s liberation is about. It is
caused by the sexism of a profit-based society that refuses
to provide adequate health care, that refuses to develop safe
contraception, that refuses to allow women the choice of
when to bear children, that bases its health system, like
everything else, on profit for drug companies, private cor-
porations and not on human needs, that refuses to take
responsibility for rearing future generations of children.
This is what the women’s liberation movement is fighting—
not only the images of femaleness Time stresses, although
those sexy ads and beauty contests are a good indication of
the kind of shuffling women are being trained to do.

A HARD
EAlN’S

GONNA FALL

Women also face oppression as workers. We suffer great
discrimination in wages, are fired first and hired last, are
essentially the most exploited sector of the labor force. In
1964 the median income for male workers was $6283; for
female workers it was $3710, and the gap is continually
widening. Non-white women receive lower wages than
white women, but all women receive lower wages than all
men. Contrary to popular belief, white women do -not earn
more than non-white men; and non-white women are made
to suffer the effects of both racism and sexism. (see Hand-
book on Women Workers, U.S. Dept. of Labor, 1965.)

We receive such low wages because we are shunted into
low-paying secondary jobs, and often cannot find full-time
jobs at all, so are given a bum deal with no fringe benefits,
either from a corporation or a union, in temporary and/or
part-tirne work. We are not holding jobs that are organized,
but we work mainly in the most unorganized, unstable
sector of the labor force.

The largest single occupation of the 28 million working
women in this country is clerical work—typists, ﬁle-clerks,
bookkeepers, etc.—followed by service work, and then
semi-skilled factory operatives. We are the waitresses,
cooks, hotel maids, assemblers, and hospital attendants of

America. Even when we have college degrees. we can not
usually hope for much more than a secretarial job.
But contrary to current mythology, we are not working

SQAOBH EU Eﬂ :0}o|_]d

for pin money or because we like our jobs——who could like
being a hotel maid‘?-We are working because financially we
have to.

‘In 1967 62% of working women were supporting either
themselves or others. They were either living alone or had
husbands who earned less than $5,000 a year. In 1963 36%
of American families had an income of less than $5,000 per
year, so it should be clear it’s not just the needs of a
handful of people we’re talking about. Women have to
work, but they are being told they don’t, and being discrim-
inated against on the job because they are women.

These discriminatory practices do not come out of thin
air. They are based on something—that is the ideologies of
male supremacy (with its correlative female inferiority),
and the nuclear family (women’s place is within the home
and caring for the children.) Both ideologies are being used
by capitalism, as they have been used _by all economic
systems in the past, to create cheap labor, scab potential, a
reserve labor pool, unpaid domestic labor in the home, and
an insatiable domestic consumer market for domestic ex-
pansion.

There is a poem written by Alice Wolfson of D.C.
Women’s Liberation that is about these ideologies:

SIX

Six and skinny

knock knees and hair in strings

six and ﬂoating through the basement
playing dracula and frankenstein

bruce made me a chalk

come play on my potsy

six and scarlet fever

and my own nurse and no one can come into my room
and books baked to go back to the library
they don’t smell like potatoes at all

six and say whistle

don’t comb my hair i like it messy

six and no more santa claus

and suddenly seven and mrs. dracula

Those who work in education play a particularly accom-
plice-like role in reinforcing these ideologies by a racist and
sexist tracking system that guarantees that women end up
at home as housewives, mothers, or at work when neces-
sary, as handmaidens to American business. We are not
taught our history, but are denied the opportunity to learn,
to experience, to grow. We are conditioned, programmed,
channeled, at a very young age, into knowing that our
survival comes from getting “Dracula” to make us his
“Mrs.”

It should be clear that not all women workers are park!
workers. Those who work as domestics,—full-time at-home
housevvives—do totally uncompensated labor and are there-
fore left out of the mainstream of a wage-labor society. It
has been estimated that housewives work roughly 90 hours
a week at home, depending on how many children they
have, and that while they do this work they are in the same
economic and social position as a serf, not.as a wage-labor
proletarian. .

At home women are isolated, kept in privitized “work-
places” where they do scut work that Good Housekeeping

5

makes all kinds of attempts to glamourize. To relieve their
boredom, they have been given gadgets and the outlet of
consumption, but that is the pacifier of only the well-to-do,
and the noose around the neck of those whom it locks
within the installment-credit system.

The free labor that housewives perform is very useful to
business. It allows men—the “real” workers—to spend more
time at the work place. It gets two workers, in effect, for
the price of one. The family, moreover, is the chief vehicle
for keeping women in a subordinate position, as well asthe
proto-type for the creation of all other classes—it is the
class division brought right into bed. Each man at least can
have some “property”, some power and control over some-
one—~i.e. his wife and kids. Each woman must make sure her
breadwinner continues to be a stable worker. The family
functions to guarantee the survival of corporate, class
America.

The ideology of women’s role within the family allows
women to be moved in and out of the labor force when
needed; i.e. a reserve labor pool business can keep around,
not even classify as “unemployed”, and use when neces-
sary. During World War II we women were recruited to fill
in for fighting men. Day-care centers were provided, train-
ing was given, etc. After the war ended, we were forced out
and back to the home as quickly as possible. Myths of
maternal deprivation and glorification of housewifery help-
ed tremendously.

But women have also been able to be used as scabs on
the labor movement because of this mythology. Because
they can be given low wages, because they will accept
part-time work (or are trained to want, or actually need
part-tirne work since there are no free day-care centers),
because they are unorganized, they can be used to break
strikes, to provide workers cheap, etc. This benefits not us
but the bosses, since ‘our measly salaries will not let us live
in anything resembling luxury, especially when we are the
sole support of our families.

Since women are both wage and non-wage workers, and
since the basis for the economic and social oppression we
face cannot be solved on bread and butter struggles alone, it
is necessary that we organize into one massive “union” as
sisters who will fight sexism and capitalist exploitation of
that ideology. We must organize where we now are in

|3|.|}38 |.I.|0.l§ ).lEM31S CEH :O].O|.|C

hospitals, in industry, at service jobs, and at home in our
communities.

We must make programmatic demands that will lead in
the direction of our freedom. We need: free medical care
that is non-profit and based on preventive medicine; free
and safe contraception and abortion; free child-care facili-

ties, day and night for all; wages paid to women for cur- .

rently uncompensated labor—during pregnancy, for child-
rearing, for domestic work at home; equal wages for equal
work; and an end to sexist and racist tracking and educa-
tion.

There are some models that women are now experi-
menting with:

1. Union caucuses: Women, Inc., a woman’s caucus of
the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers Union,
has been demonstrating in Antioch and Stockton, Califor-
nia. against both Fibreboard, the corporation that employs
them, and their union, for discrimination in wages, in
services (day-care, for example), and in hiring/firing, place-
ment on seniority lists, rewritten job definitions, and gen-
eral discrimination against women workers. They are de-
manding equal pay for equal work, an end to the misuse of
state protective labor legislation, an end to the arbitrary
lay-offs of women and for company supported chﬂd-care
facilities.

This may be the first example of a separate woman’s
struggle within the organized labor movement since the
turn of the century. It certainlyis a breakthrough in not
allowing either the bosses or the union to channel dissent
solely into wage-demands.

2. Organizing women in “women’s work”—There has
been almost no organizing done in jobs women primarily
hold—either by unions or by movement groups. Generally
women are seen only as temporary workers, so they are
ignored. Women’s liberation groups all over are trying to
organize secretaries, waitresses and domestics, to give a few
examples, not only as workers around worker-type griev-
ances, but as women who will probably not always work
these particular jobs, but who will always suffer from
exploitative sexism. Therefore, we are organizing around
the general condition of women. '

3. In the early part of this century the I.W.W. attempted
to organize everyone into one big union—the employed, the
skilled, the unskilled, and the unemployed. They failed, and
were ripped apart by cops, the govermnent, and their own
lack of clear direction. It is the intent of Women’s Libera-
tion to organize women as one big union wherever they are.
Sexism is a total life confrontation. We, as women are now
divided into classes, according to race, and by the arbitrary
definition of worker vs. non-worker (housewife). We must
unite to end the oppression of all women.

There has always been sexism, no matter what the eco-
nomic system. But sexism has no chance of being elimin-
ated under capitalism. Should some of us think ‘we have
“made it”, whatever that means, the rest of us will still be
used to supply cheap, free and reserve labor, to consume, to

scab on each other. We need a socialist system based on ,

human needs, not the profit of some off the exploitation of
all the others. We as women must create a total revolu-
tion—a classless society where racism and sexism cannot
exist, Only in solidarity can we be free, but only in struggle

"Contrary to a variety of popular images, Women’s Liber-
ation is not a movement of hardened and coldly unfeeling
females, shouting rhetoric, hating men, and scorning “unlib-
erated” sisters. Nor is it a movement that demands “instant
liberation;” women do not have to leave their husbands and
lovers, abandon their children, throw away their make-up,
burn their bras, quit their jobs, or sleep with each other in
order to be part of the movement. Indeed, even those most
involved must continually struggle to come to grips with
changing concepts of ourselves.

Liberation* is a constant process-—and for a woman
whose liberation involves in great part an end to her loneli-
ness and isolation from other women, it would be both
agonizing and impossible without their support. And to
provide this support, women have organized the “small
group”—the strength of our movement, through which wo-
men reach out to each other, grope together, grow together.
It is our best means of raising consciousness, our most
effective organizing tool, and, at the same time, our most
human structure.

Every Sunday night I meet with 10 other women. Two
high school students, two high school teachers, a social
worker, 3 college students, 3 drop—outs. We-came together
originally through a Resistance women’s mailing; later some
of us brought friends. Marilyn and Janice are sisters, Kay
and I, quite accidentally, are old family acquaintances,
Ronny and Paula close school friends, Bette knew none of
the others until our first meeting.

Our first discussions were fumbling, in our enthusiasm
we would jump from topic to topic as new ideas flew from
one to another, fragmenting the political from the personal.

Until we realized that we had to begin with our most
potent political force—our lives. And the best way to do
that, we discovered, was for each of us to speak about her
life—her chﬂdhood, her family, her friendships, ambitions,
lovers, husbands, career. A method in itself revolutionary; a
way of breaking down one of the strongest bulwarks of our
s0ciety—the belief that an individual’s perceptions of her-
self cannot be understood by anyone else; that individual

  

 

*I.'do not believe that anyone—male or female—can

' achieve true liberation under capitalism. In this article,

however, I am primarily concerned with those changes that
we can make in our lives, the ways we struggle, and the
changing of our consciousness.

problems must, therefore, be dealt with in isolation and

loneliness."

For the past few months each meeting has been devoted
to one of us——to listening to her “story,” dealing with her
life. And, indeed, though backgrounds, specific experiences,
and current situations vary (e.g., Mary comes from Texas,
was raised as a Southern Baptist; she and Sandy and Bette
“came of age” in the 50’s; Paula is from a wealthy Mid-
western town, the rest of us from New York, New Jersey or
California) we can meet on a common ground, having each
been brought up and socialized to play the role of woman.

For many of us this openness demanded a tremendous,
sometimes overwhelming emotional effort, one which ne-
cessitated the laying aside of life-long inhibitions. In our
society it is always a risk to relinquish the security of

anonymity, one of the few securities allowed us. In this

case, we each had to overcome the additional fear of losing
the support and friendship of the group. How did any of us
know to what extent we could trust each other? How could
we know that we wouldn’t meet with hostility, disapproval,
ridicule? These fears, though real, proved to be unfounded.
In fact, our group has drawn much closer since these
intense personal analyses began.

As we grew to know each other better, we began to fall
out of the group roles that we had assumed I no longer felt
the need to be a leader, Ronny began to see herself less as
the group scholar or group mentor, Bette no longer acted as
our most knowledgeable link to other women’s groups,
Marilyn and Linda stopped being the “not quite commit-
ted.” And we began to relate to each other as individuals
and as friends. ,

Listening to other women, learning about their feelings,
their weaknesses and strengths, their fears, their experi-
ences, has helped me to accept myself as a woman; I’m not
the only one whose sexual initiation was difficult and
painful; I’m not the only one who won’t open her mouth.in
a large group unless I know the indisputable truth and even
then, only if I’ve rehearsed it a dozen times; I’m not the
only one struggling to overcome dependency on men, to
experience healthy relationships with both sexes.

But perhaps most important to me——to my self-
image—was the realization that the dynamic woman is not a
rarity, not an abberation of the natural order. Every woman;
in our group is an exciting person; we don’t cackle; we’re

not incurable gossips; and we are likeable—something Amer— .

ican women don’t often think about each other-—or about
ourselves For me, to enjoy women “en masse” was an
almost totally. new experience. I, who had always shunned
all-girl groups, all-girl schools, now look forward to my

all-girl meetings as one of, the high points of my week. I

know now that if women are dull, if women are docile, if
women are difficult to work with, it’s only because that
behavior has been expected, in fact demanded, of us, and
we’ve learned to see ourselves that way. _ ''

But now we’re uniting against“ such programming, and
that unity extends across the nation. Debby, who was in
our group until she moved to California, sent us a letter
about her small group there:

“Several people live in communes, one girl is preg-
nant and unmarried, another wants to be but is afraid
she’ll loseher job, another girl just divorced her hus-
band, another is living in a women ’s commune and not

8

seeing men A few undergraduates, 1 or 2 graduate
students. A girl who never was told about orgasms or
the clitoris and of course is living with a guy. The
group is a lot different from the one in New York.
While there seems to be, on the whole, a much less
developed social consciousness, people are eager to talk
about the most intimate things and do so with an
amazing frankness and lack of inhibitions. .. We’ve
had long talks about masturbation and lesbian-
ism—talks so honest, that at times I ’ve had trouble
participating because of my own hang-ups. . . In a way
this is what I want— for a while I felt] was losing touch
with my gut feelings; intellectualizing. ”

Since Debby’s left New‘York, we have begun to discuss
“those most intimate things,” but it has been difficult for
us to examine our own sexuality on more than a superficial.
level, a difficulty in great part due to the age range of the
group (17 to 36) and the resulting gapsin our sexual
experiences.

The concept of women’s liberation and participation in
the movement has made profound differences in many
lives. Shattered illusions replaced by more deeply meaning-
ful realities. Not all pleasant or easily acceptable. As a step
towards an ultimate goal-—better relationships with men and
women—we often have to sacrifice, at least temporarily,
those we now have. Until both men and women can better
understand what those relationships should be, and until
society allows more creative exploration of relationships
For some, this means broken marriages..For Kay, who is
thankful she became aware of women’s liberation while she
is still in high school, it means, “Because of what I now
know and feel, I probably won’t want to have many of the
relationships I might otherwise have desired, but I can see

myself having fewer, stronger ones.” For Bette it has meant \

a greater self-esteem, the strength and ability to do what
she wants, rather than what is wanted of her. For Sandy it
may mean motherhood outside of marriage. Mary, the only
woman in the group with children, would like to move into
a commune with her family. Ronny has begun to use her
maiden name and to explore living apart from her husband.
I, too, have given up my visions of myself becoming Mrs.
Somebody Else. Which is not to say there aren’t many
contradictions in our lives~—in my life, specifically, there are
many: in relationships with some women whom I still see as
threats, with men on the demands I still make of them,
with my boy friend (especially), with my parents, in my
job.

What is often, however, our greatest obstacle is guilt.
Guilt that comes from taking care of our own lives. Guilt
that is very real for women brought up to be caretakers of
husbands and children, to sacrifice their needs for their
family’s. Or for those of ‘us in the broader political Move-
ment, taught to see our struggles as trivial, even frivolous,
next to those of the Asians, the Africans, the Latin Ameri-
cans, and in this country the blacks and the workers. Guilt
that has kept me out of the Women’s Movement for a long
time. '

But it’s beginning to go away. I’m growing stronger,
more confident, though sometimes I have to fight to make
it show. And that’s when I know I can turn to my sisters.
And I know they’ll understand.

was a child during World War II, which, in that time of
American innocence, was a very popular war. The war
entered‘ every aspect of our lives, particularly the lives of

children, and we were the more easily manipulated because -

of it. In school we were made to feel that any minor
dereliction, thetiniest defiance of authority would some-
how adversely affect the “war effort.” We earnestly saved
our dimes and quarters to buy defense stamps. Each week

we fervently sang patriotic songs in assembly, filing in-

middy-bloused lines into the school auditorium where a
little placque at the side of the stage bore a quote from Joe
Louis: “We will win because God is on our side.” When
report cards were distributed, the assistant principle, a
large, stout, white haired, truly awesome woman, would
visit the classrooms and examine each student’s report card.
If a student had not made a satisfactory rate of progress, in
her opinion, she would characterize each small delinquent a
“Nazi,” or worse, a “J ap.”

Still, the emphasis of those years was on the importance
of each individual doing his or her part and I at least was

made to feel that what I did mattered ;that indeed, the fate ,
of the nation depended on my getting an “S” for Satisfac- ,
'tory in “Works and Plays Well With Others.” And if my

days were spent in grim, guilt-ridden conformity, I could
escape at night into my soaring fantasies, performing in my
dreams countless individualistic feats of derring do which

‘always resulted in the total defeat of my country’s enemies.’
Moreover, my fantasy life did not exist in a vacuum; it
~ . found external nourishment.

of the comics were male (men who related to women in a
medieval, chivalric fashion, zooming across the sky with a
girl sitting in their arms, a female newly rescued, passively

adoring and about to be rejected); nevertheless, there were .

a few strong, unfrivolous, equally fabulous heroines ﬂashing
among the superjocks—Wonder Woman (naturally she was
labelled a lesbian “by psychologists who studied the comic
phenomena) stood out magnificently as a beacon for ‘my
aspirations.

My imagination was also fed by films of the era in which

women were significant. Of course, Hollywood continued .
‘ to spin out imagery of woman as sex object, and a new

dimension of this sort was developed during the war——“pin-
ups;” Betty Grable smiling coyly back at servicemen above
a dimpled derriere. But one of the most popular film
characters of the era, played by Ann Sothern, was a com-
petent, gum chewing working class heroine, Rosie the
Riveter. ’

My friends who used to put on mosquito netting and
play “bride,” were studying to be coy and giggly when boys
came near, were starting to put on bras—and lot.s of airs
—and were beginning to talk cute about menstruation. I
looked forward to an adulthood of action, not the constric—

W ting tedium of housework, the absorbed attention to the

care“ of objects and the pursuit of routines that so often
estranged my mother from me. .
There was a basis in reality, then, for considering this

‘ alternative. During the Second World War, laws restricting .

the working hours and conditions of women were suspended

_ “for the duration of the emergency,” and labor unions were 9.
