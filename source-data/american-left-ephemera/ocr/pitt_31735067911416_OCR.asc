AN) EDITORIAL .
The attack on lT1',uInan

 ‘TO ‘SOME OBSERVERS, the Brownell-Velde-Truman affair was

very confusirYg..Truman, they noted, has a long anti-communist record.
How could he be red-baited? , ’

What the attack on Truman means is that McCarthyism has be-
come the open and official policy of the Eisenhower administration. It
is part of an overall plan to make every iremnant of the Roosevelt
New Deal *‘si1bvei'sive.” That includes -the New Deal policy of a fair
shake for organized workers. ' I
_ Truman himself—and he should know—-said last week that “anti-
communism is being ‘used for partimn political purposes.” The purpose
is a on'e—party system—tlie party of the “Millionaire Cabinet.”

CONSERVATIVE and middle-of—the-road labor unionists are in
much the- same position as Truman in this matter. They have tended
tolreply on their anti-communism for protection from the attacks
which started with labor leaders considered to be “left-wingers.”

They have remained on the side,-lines while congressional commit-.

tees attacked unions. Many supported the ouster of eleven -unions,
from the CIO. Few protested when the president of the United Public

' Workers was indicted for contempt of Congress for refusing to hand

over a list of the members of his ‘union so they could be persecuted
and fired. I . M - '
.- Will a hands-off or a red-baiting policy buy_ them continued im-

‘ munity from attack?

CONSIDER the case of Harry Truman. ‘It was he who legalized

. the establishment by the Attorney General of- a list of “subversive”

organizations. When the Republicans accused him of “coddling Com-
munists” he was able to-reply, “Look how many we've sent to jail.”

His Justice Department deported or moved to deport thousands

I of aliens for supposed radical thinking. He encouraged members of

his ‘party in their witch—hunting investigations. \ .

Now, when a Republican administration turns the same weapons
against -Truman, we see that not only among workers is it true that
“An injury to one is an injury to “all.” . V . .

If the Republicans can get away with this, what chance will even
the most right-wing union have? What chance will there be to stop
the’ Butler bill‘? Under 3. Butler law, or Goldwater-Rhodes law, what
chance would an “anti—Communist”,u_ni_on have?

It would -get the same consideration that Truman got for his anti-

A Communism. Any union raising any demand foriwages and conditions

T‘ would get the .Truman treatment; andit would wind up losing its legal
bargaining rights. A i ‘
' i ONLY THE UNITY of labor—left, right and center—together

; with the farmers, church people and others who are fighting back,-
‘ can save our unions and our country from a blackout of civil liberties

aI_id.destruction of our labor unions.

“WASHINGTON, D. C.——Mine-Mill’s
program for jobs was projected once
again this month as the best solution
to the deepening crisis in the lead and
zinc industry.

The general program to safeguard
the living standards of workers in the
non-ferrous metals industry was con-
tained in a statement submitted by the
Union's four top officers to the U. S.
Tariff Commission holding hearings on
the question of increased tariff rates

‘on lead and zinc. It was presented to

the Commission through Herman Clott,
Mine-M.ill’s I legislative representative
in Washington.

Stressed in the program is immediate

‘relief for those workers already hit by

the lead-zinc \depression and plans to
increase consumption of the metals
both at home and abroad.

THE MINE-MILL -PROGRAM,‘ em-
phasizing the need‘ to provide both
emergency and long range solutions to
the metals problem, calls for:

1. Immediate relief for small and
marginal mines through passage of the
Premium Price Plan Bill, introduced by
Senator James Murray of Montana last
April. ‘

2. Relief for leaidand zinc workers
through a law proﬁding direct federal
aid over and above present une‘mploy-
ment compensation benefits, through
substantial wage increas_es_ to workers

still employed, and through reduction
in income taxes. '

3. Increase of domgstic consumption
of non-ferrous metals through legisla-
tion for a. sizeable; public works pro-
gram, including river valley develop-

-ment, schools, hospitals, highways and

rural’ electrification:-each of which
would consume gigantic amounts of
lead and zinc, and would provide 3
much greater domestic market.

4. Increase foreign consumption of
metals by lowering or modifying all
barriers to peaceful "world trade and

_ by helping to promote industrial de-

velopment of under-developed countries
without political ‘or economical inter-
ference.

ONLY THIS KIND of a basic ap-
proach, the officers emphasized, can
really provide a solution for the present
crisis in lead and zinc;

“We believe.” the statement pointed
out, “that the national emergency now
confronting the lead,-zinc industry re-
quires basic and far-reaching solutions
along the lines outlined above. Any in-’
crease in tariff rates would not only be
inadequate to the needs of the situation,
but through its restrictive influence on
world trade would further aggravat
the situation.” i

solution to the lead-zinc crisis, the of-

0" of American life? A 

7 era of a well-organized labor‘ movement."

By John Clark

UNION has just gone thi'ough_ another
election. The unofficial results have been given out and the first week
of December the convassing committee will meet in Denver to declare
the official results. 0 ' i

The interests of the‘ employers in this election were clearly shown

A "by the front—page coverage given. Stooping to theirclowest depths to

malign this union, their paid columnists poured out
a. diatribe that should not only nauseate every true
trade unionist, but should show clearly the plans that
are being laid for the whole organized’ labor move-
ment in this country.

The hysteria of fear and distortion being created
in this country by the National Association’ of Manu-
facturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
_ — American Mining Congress, _who are sponsoring and
fighting for passage of the Butler Bill, is done for one purpose-

99‘ 

that of government licensing and control of’ labor unions.

Any spurious charge by an employer_wou1d take away a uniqn’s
bargaining rights, without the right of a hearing if‘ the appointed

_ Board to administer the law felt those charges were “meritorious"’——. '  _ ' y i . if , 1
following the now well-known procedure of finding one guilty on the ‘ . V « , 
unknown evidence ofstoolpigeons, or byusing your constitutional P Hg  p 

in 100,000 acrres-of Canadcil, ,; 

1 rights against self-incrimination in being "questioned before knowing

the bill of particulars against you.

“Fear is a great silencerand people are being kept quiet for
fear of being accused of sympathy with communism. When people
become afraid to speak their beliefs,’ or to defend the innocent, or
to explore new ideas, then freedom is really in danger.”

This statement was made in‘New York, November 9, by former
President Truman, who at this time is under attack by thecpolitical

, bosses‘ of the present -administration.

The Butler Bill, the hearings _of the McCarthy-Jenner-Vlelde and
McCarran Committees on -labor unions, -are a specific part'of the

crusade of big business to deny you the right ofiyour basic.freedoms, ,

and to silence your opposition to the passage and intent of these anti-

7 la.bor laws.

\

A TODAY, because of this fear, we see American labor divided--leaders

of labor who in the past were vociferous in their denunciations of such
activities are silenced and some even join the ranks of ‘reaction in- add-

0' -ing their veiled ‘support to. these measures. Can it be that this fear

has edged them this way andprendered them 'inarticulate?_

"What is the intent-of those who are snooping into every phase

Our Union has been one of the targets of these iiiquisitions——both

0, of the committees and the press. Why?

Is'it because we advocate peace and the abolition of wars? Is it

9 because we advocate world trade to insure job security for the
workers? (The 'metal situation‘ and its effect in ouivindustry, with _

thousands unemployed, is ‘proof of needed (support? on this question.)

_ Isiit that we subscribe to the unity" of Workers, in our industry
over the world? ,Is' it for our support of valley authorities, better

-housing, schools, and other programs‘, for the. economic welfare of this

nation? Is it for our opposition to the steals in oil, forests, and.
grazing? <Or our defense of civil liberties? Or our fight against racial ‘
discrimination and anti-labor bills that deny the fight of’ free labor’
unions to choose their leaders? * ' , ‘—

Or is‘ it because; of our militant and successful fight for a wage
increase again, this year? . it .

These are the- policies ‘of Mine-Mill. These are the policies of

 many other unions. These’ are the policies of other organizations: The.,

singling out of one or two unions by placing connotations or accusa-
tions by professional, paid informers that these policies and the

 advocacy of them is somehow, someway subversive, is the most dia-

bolical plot against all labor in our. history.

1

PART OF THIS ATTACK on our Union has caused some division

. ff .of_our‘ members. To _fail to judge the cause correctly and to refuse to 
 fight? against these attacks can only mean the disintegration of free
. -labor and the beginning of company or industry controlled unions;

1  .“”'CHARLEST'ON, S. C. —Attention was centered on two important developments here as the strike

of Naco Fertilizer Workers against a pay cut goes into its 15th week. I
 On. the one hand, Naco Fertilizer Company began proceedings before the National Labor Relations
Board asking for a de—certification election, and ‘on the other, Charleston Fertilizer &-Chemical Workers
Local 863 filed charges of unfair labor practices against the company. ' . '

The action of the company in attempting. to get a de-certification election.reveals the fact that its

 x‘

‘y true purpose had been to break the Union rather than to -cut wages. This is further proved by the fact

‘that -this "relatively smalllcompany has spent enough money‘ during the past foyrteen weeks to have en-

"-tibled it to pay its“ employes a substantial wage increase for a period of two or three years to come.

In filing unfair labor practice charges aga

not an economic strike but that rather
the company. forced the men off the job
by a coercive and discriminatory, wage
cut’, at a time when the _’rest- of the
._  fertilizer industry in that area had not
 ‘I reduced. wages. ”
 New legal question -
This brings an entirely new question -
. V before’ the NLRB, and the ' charges
‘*'which Mine-Mill is lodging against -th
.company are, in a ._ .-- .
sense,-b-r e a kin g .
‘new ground. The ‘
Board has pre- ‘
ﬁviously ruled that‘
D. strike for higher
wages alone is an -
economic strik e
and» that strikers .
do not have the ‘
-‘protection of the
NLRB in holding
_ ‘their jobs while engaged in such awork
‘stoppage. This shows how the Taft-
Hartley law is designed to aid the
companies in an economic fight with
their employes. . ,-
“'t In this.ca,se, however, Mine-Mill is
’ pointing out'that it was not the Union
which attempted to change wage and
working conditions .by striking, but
‘rather that _the company put ‘a cut into‘
effectat a time when the members of
_ the Union were willing to continue to
'work pending further negotiations.
Another point made in the charges

James Wilson I

g 4_  against the company is that racial dis-

'»"‘f.‘crin1ination has entered the pi_cture_ in
that the all-Negro group of workers"

, 583 King St}, Charleston, S. C.,

’ ' November 15, 1953. ’

To the Editor, Charleston News 8: Courier,

Charleston, S. C.

Dear Sir: I --
The charge has been made against Southern industry that they have on occasion

used one race against another in order to fight unions and keep wages down-. This

charge has beenstrongly denied and we union members would be happy if the.

denial were true. _ ‘ ‘ ~
However, some of the members of my local union right here in Charleston are

_ experiencing this kind of discrimination.‘ A Feftilizer Company. in Charleston recently

cut wages although no other fertilizer company in the area had done so. The Union

proposed thét the men should ,,continue working on” the same wage scale which had -

been in effect pending further negotiations or pending a change in the general wage
scale in the fertilizer industry here. I ‘

This reasonable proposal was turned down and the Company put the wage..cut
into effect. The members of our Union could not agree to cut their own ‘throats
and the throats of their brothers by workingunder a discriminatory wage cut. They
knew that a wage cut at. this time in the Charleston fertilizer ‘industry would hurt

- not only the men (already low paid) but also businessmen and the community" as

a whole. ' . _ _ A

Since that time, this company has hired 60 to 70 wh_ite workers to replace the
some 30IN‘egro workers who refused to work under a pay cut. And these 60 to 70
white men are doirrg the work formerly done by the 30 colored workers. (Not a

. single Negro worker is working in the plant today.) In other words, this "Company,

which said it had to cut wages, has already spent erroughmoney to pay its employees ,

a substantial wage increase for the next two or three years!

So it is clear that the Company wants to break the union; and that it is willing
to use white against colored workers for this purpose. By the way, if a company
can get white workers to work for'lower"wages than Negroworkers, is this their
way of/pfomoting "white supremacy"? If so, it should be clear to white and Negro
workers alike that this will lead only ‘to "boss supremacy" and a lower standard of
livin‘g‘,‘for a_ll of us alike, regardless of color. I -' ~

And since industrialists and business men deny that they use or encourage,-the
use of one race against another, maybe the fertilizer companies in this area will use

their influence to see that this un—American and un—Christian practice is stopped in‘

the Charleston area. -

The closed hearings conducted by the
McCarthy witchhunters were marked
by terror tactics against engineers and
former clerical and secretarial help at
Fort Monmouth. Many housewiveswere —.
called at their homes and thld to report
to McCarthy within an hour without

being told what the investigation was

all about. . i

REFERRING to the fact that Attorney General

_ Brownell has never done anything about prosecuting
Senator McCarthy on his “financial transactions.
which merited prosecution,” Pearson goes on to dis-' -

‘ close that “Brownell also let the statute of limitations  *
expire this month on the senate report alleging _cor- .'
ruption in the Maryland ‘senatorial ca7{npaign in which ,
McCarthy likewise figured,” the pampaign which re-' ‘

Also featured as gue_st moderator on Hunt’s show, ,
the AP story discloses,’ was Robert E. ‘Lee, former
FBI agent, long-time pal of McCarthy recently ap-
~ pointed by President Eisenhower to the Federal Com-
munications Commission which controls ‘radio and
‘television broadcastinglicenses. ,

A_LSO TIED IN with Hunt is Victor Johnson, a
former administrativeassistant to McCarthy, who the
Associated Press says, has been quoted.as saying he

1 was working for the Facts Forum in order to help
Hunt put his ideas across. .

Both Lee and his wife have been politically active
as associates of Senator McCarthy and his wife, and
all four, Mr. and Mrs. Lee and Senator and Mrs. Mc-
Carthy, were involved up to their ears in the political
smear campaign which elected Senator Butler of
Maryland in 1950. i -- .

On the McCartliy-Lee tie-in with Butler, the Balti-
more Sun recently report_e-dd that when McCarthy
helped defeat former Democratic Senator Tydings

/said, “simply because the present Ad-

  of-Biloaircl declares Vclollar   
     December assessment 3

 

A DENVER—Acting on a mandate unanimously voted by the Mine-
Mill Convention in St. Louis last September, the International ‘Execu-
ltilve Board, has declared a $1 per member assessment applicable to the
month of December, 1953.‘ Notice of the assessment was sent to all
local unions in the United States and Canada on November 10.
The assessment was declared in lieu of a per capita increase
0 favored by a great many delegates at the convention as a means of
A «meeting the greatly increased operating costs of the Union.
- Secretary-Treasurer M. E. Travis, writing to the locals on behalf
of the International Executive Board, pointed out that in spite of the

statements made at the convention by
dozens of delegates in support of a
. percapita increase of as high as fifty
cents a month, “the International Ex-
ecutive Board and the Convention Com-
mittee both _felt it would be unwise to
impose an increase in percapita at this
time,” and had therefore proposed an
assessment instead.
"HIGHER COSTS . _ ,
The letter to the locals explained
that “this assessment is necessitated
"by the current financial situation _in

the International Union growing out H

of greatly increased operating costs

and expenses in connection with new

organization.” 7

Pointing out that the financial situ-
ation in the Union was thoroughy re-
ported on and discussed at the-St. Louis
Convention, the letter emphasized that

~ “that convention acted to call upon the -_
International Executive Board to levy.

on assessment.”

“In making the motion for an assess-
ment,” the letter reports, Brother
Doug'Gold of Kiberley Local 651 said:

‘I thi-nk that this Convention" as the ‘ ‘

highest body of the International
-should give some leadership to the Ex-
, ecutive Board on the assessment . . .
I would like to move that an assess-

ment beheld this year. I think we
A need the money.’ ”

-The letter goes on to quote some of
the ‘local delegates at the convention
who spoke in support of‘ resolutions
submitted to the Convention by 16 lo-
cals calling for’a per capita increase.
Among these were the locals compos-
ing’ the Kennecott Council.

KENNECOTT RESOLUTION ..

The Kennecott resolution‘ stated in
-part:

. “Our Union’s responsibility for in-
. creased ‘worlc in the field of political
action, trade union unity, organiza-

tion, etc., will incur additional expense .

we-an.d ‘ require a.dditiona.l income.”

A  ' _ In speaking for the Kennecott reso-

'lution, President Joe Dispenza of L0-

ca 485, Binghani Canyon, Utah, asked:

“How in the can we still build

' loc'al unions in this International, serv-
ice the unions we now have to be good

I A. -‘strong zmions-,‘i_f we don’t increase per

capita tax payments to this. Inter-

‘_ national Union?” . .

“O_ne delegate from Local 18', Kellogg,
Idaho,” the letter pointed out, “said,
‘-Wegot .a pretty good settlement in
most of the industry. The guys ought
not to- kick about kicking in some
” money. Our enemies will destroy us
if we don’t fight. This is really. the
year we ought to get out and get
somemore money.’ ” ;
Other statements by convention dele-
gates in support of increased revenue
for the International were quoted in
the letter as follows: «
Larry Mowrer, Local 16, Great Falls,
Montana: \ g _ ' —
“I realize that the International
. needs more money if it is to do pa.-job.
I think it is time this Convention took
..some -steps putting to a referendum
vote the establishing of niinimum
yducs . . .” '
Hugh Hales, Local
Utah: , ' .
A “Kennecott ‘workers, like all thcf rest
,.of -the» workers in the Intlernutional

mittee both felt that it would be un-
wise to impose an increase in per capi-
ta at this time. Growing unemployment
in the industry and other factors com-
pel this decision.

“In lieu of a per capita increase,”
the letter continued, “a
delegates expressed the necessity for
an assessment . . . and ‘as indicated
above, the Convention unanimously
acted to call upon the International
Executive Board to levy an assessment.”

Meanwhile, to further improve the
ability of the International Union to
operate under a budget limited by _a
relatively low per capita as compared
with other unions, and without,impair-
ing continued full service to the locals,
the officers of the Union are acting to
institute as many economies as possi-
ble in order to cut expense. A meeting
of the International Executive Board
scheduled for November 21 was to go
into the details of putting new econo-
mics into effect. '

California (I0 calls
for the 30-hour week

SAN DIEGO,_ Cal.—A “program
‘against depression” adopted at the re-
cent California CIO Council convention
here includes a call for a 30-hour week
without reduction in the ‘present 40-
hour take-home pay. at key speaker at
the convention was Robert Oliver, as-
sistarit to C10 . president W alt e r
Reuther. , I

Either Reuther has changed his mind
about the 30-hour week as part of a

v long-range programgto avoid mass un-
employment‘ in a‘ depression, or the
California‘ CIO has taken a position for
the 30-hour week directly opposite to
Reuther’s stated policy on the subject.
When the demand /for a 30-hour week

was raised by Ford Local 600 delegates *

and others at the United Auto Workers
convention earlier this year, Reuther
himself was mainly responsible for its
defeat by blasting the demand and
those who raised it as cofnmunistic.
The 30-hour week demand in indus-
tries where widespread layoffsare oc-
curing, however, is being pushed more
and more to the fore in the fight to
save jobs. VAFL president Georg-e
Meany, for example, recently raised it
- as -a more practical prospect than
achievement of the -guaranteed annual
wage demand, a favorite with Reuther.
The Mine-Mill Wage Policy Commit-
tee, as early as last April, included the
30-hour week without loss in pay in the
Union’s. wage and contract program,
especially "for those areas where loss of
jobs has become A a serious threat
against the living standards of many
workers.

Jobs program
(Continued from page 1)
ficers made the following points: a
tariff fails to recognize that the prob-
lem is world-wide, that a crisis in world
trade is at the root of the lead-zinc
depression, and that to the extent a
tariff kept foreign metal out of the
U. S. it would make it much more dif-
ficult for foreign countries to buy here,
thus aggravating the crisis ev__en more.

FURTHERMORE, the statement ex-
pressed doubts that any tariff would
give enough protection’ to high cost
and small producers who are the hard-
est hit, since such tariffs would favor
the big lead and zinc corporations at
the expense of the smaller corpora-
tions. The statement also pointed out
that past experience has shown tariffs
to be no really effective aid against
foreign competition in time of economic
crisis, as in the 1930s when the indus-
try suffered from depression despite
the fact that they were supposed to be
protected by a relatively high tariff
wall. '

AN ANALYSIS of the situation
pointed up the underlying causes at the

isoot of the crisis, adding weight to the
Union’s contention that “far more com-
prehensive solutions are required than
could be effected by any revision of
tariff rates.” Summed up briefly, these
causes are: '

—European markets which had been
consuming large quantities of lead and
zinc were shut off, due to the general
economic decline in those countries, and
the metals began to flood the U. S.
market.

——Although U. S. consumption of
both lead and zinc remained high, the
imports forced prices down, resulting
in shutdowns of many small operations,
layoffs of-thousands of workers, and
bankruptcy for small businessmen in
thelnining communities affected.

—T,he.crisis is aggravated by the
tight control which monopoly corpora-
tions hold over the lead and zinc indus-
try, both domestic and foreign.

ONTHE LAST POINT listed among
the causes of the crisis, the officers’
statement emphasized that the real sig-
nificance of the imports‘ is the fact that
control of the most important lead and
zinc operations abroad is in the hands
of _U. S. corporations, and that while
these imports are foreign-produced the
control arid profits are in the hands of

the biggest corporations with headqtuar--».

ters in New York City. .The statement
points-_out that these are the very cor-
porations- which have suffered least
from thelead-zinc crisis or which are
actually in a position to profit from it.

To the Editor:

Our answer to your question in the
last issue of THE UNION is, stick to
the International Constitution which

states, “The pages of the Official
Journal shall be open to all officers
and members of the organization for
the discussion of social affairs, indus-
trial, economic and political questions,
or any other questions pertaining to
the interest of the working class.”

The last two issues of the Union
paper prior to the International elec-
tions were not following this part of
the constitution. ,
. Let’s not forget part of the union
man’s creed, “an injury to one is an
injury to all.”

Please put this in your Open l“o1'u1n.

Fraternally yours,

‘ NLRB orders new vole ‘

at Christmas, Arizona

CHRISTMAS, Ariz. — Mine-Mill's
charge that company interference in-
fluenced the workers to vote against
the Union in an election held at the
Riviera Mines here September 22 has
been upheld and a new election or-
dered.

A ‘directive issued by the D_i1'ectoi;/_;'
of the NLRB 21st Region on October,

29 declares that the company violated
fair election procedure, sets "the dis-
puted' election aside and directs th t a
new election be held. The previous elec-
tion had resulted in 27 votesibeing cast
-for “No Union” and 24 for Mine-Mill,
_but a brief 01 objections to the elec-
’tion was filed’ by Int'l rep. Jack C.
Marcotti on the ‘grounds of company
interference.
The objections were based on com-

pany efforts before the election‘ to in- -

fluence the vote against the Union,
by way of a company-called meeting,
“Dear John” letters to the workers,
company promises and other unfair
election activities. ,

With the Union’s objections having

been upheld by the Labor Bpardand
a new election ordered, the company -

is now attempting to stall the new

vote by ‘demanding a September 8-

eligibility date for those voting in‘ the

 next election. The Union, pointingout
,, that the September 8 date would deny
_a vote to approximately 70. workers‘

of the 120 now employed by the com-

pany, is demanding that all workers‘
on the payroll as of Octbber 27 or"

thereabouts be eligible to_vote in of‘-

\ der to, guarantee a fair and dehiocratic. _

election among all the workers.in-

KANSAS CITY—-En un reporte gir-
ado -a toda la nacién por radio y tele-
visit’) la noche del 16"de noviembre
desde \ Independence, Missouri, Harry
S. _Truman, ex-presidente de los‘/EE.

.,..UU., contesté las acusaciones y calum-

niaslanzadas contra el por él Fiscal
General de la nacién Herbert Brownell.

En‘ un discurso politico previo ante
“hfmcheon” en Chicago
Brownell “alcusé” a Truman “en efecto,
de conscientgmente haber traicionado
la seguridad de los EE. UU.”

Dijo Truman, “Su ‘cargo es falso, y
el Sr. Browpell. debiera haber sabido
que era falso en los momentos que lo
hizo.” Aﬁadio Truman, “Pqr lo tanto,
lo que esta administracién (la de Eisen-

hower) ha intentado es claro, ha\--tor-

cido una decision que hizo posible cl
procedimiento de una investigacién de
gran importancia. . .” “Esto es dema-
gogeria vergonzosa. Es peor que eso.
Herbert Brownell Jr., el fiscal general
de los EE. UU.—-el mas elevado oficial
legal de nuestro gobierno—ha de-
gradado laimais alta funcién de nuestro
gobierno-—-la ad-ministracién de la jus-
ticia. . .” , '

“En decir que, Harry Dexter White
era‘ conocido como. un espia comunista
por la misma gente lque le nombré,

'minti6 él al pu-eblo norteamericano.”

Siguié diciendo.Truman, “Este trag-
ico envilecimiento de- la alta oficina
del procurador general es lo suficiente
daﬁoso, pero la cosa que mas quiero
advertirles esta noche es que este in-
cidente es solo el-mais publicado y el

~'més reciente» ejemplo del decaeimiento“

VANCOUVER, B. C.—Strenuous ef-
forts, both open and undei-handed, are
being made by the British Columbia.
bosses, and those of Canada in general,
to bust trade union organization in
this country. -

After weeks of strike in the interior
of this province, the International
Woodworkers of America seem as far
as ever from a settlement, with the
operators in general stubbornly refus-
ing to bargain with any measure of
good faith, and secretly formulating
plans to bust the units involved, which
if successful would pave the way for
the big operators along the coast and
on Vancouver Island to do away en-
tirely with the union.

. These plans were sent to all op-

erators affected by the strike in the
form of a confidential letter from a
section of the Canadian lllanufacturers
Association, which is beingi_p1'oteslcd
by the union to the government as a
breach of the Industrial Conciliation
and Arbitration Act. . ‘

.. BOSS PROPAGANDA

There is considerable support among‘
unionists here for the theory that the
stiff stand of the interior operators
is being supported b_V‘the big‘ coast
operators, such as the H. R. Mac.Millan
interests, who these the observers say

really deliberated promoted the strike
with the two—pronged objective of
eliminating interior market competi-
tion. and breaking organization in the
lumber and logging‘ industry of the
province.

Similar tactics of secretly disl‘ribul-
ed boss propaganda are being pursued
in the shipyards, where the Marine
Workers and Boilermakers Industrial
Ilnion, (_CC‘L), and certain craft un-
ions ofvlhe ALFL such as the Plumbers
and the Machinisls ~have.been in ne-
‘goli-alions for many weeks.

Recently Western Business and In-
dustry, a scab shop spokesman of the
bosses, published articles recapitulat-
ing the “Kusych Case,” reported some-
time ago in THE UNION.

Kusych was fired from the Boiler-
makers for anti-union activity, and»his
endeavors to get re—instated through
the courts became a focal point for
all employers’ anti-union security ac-
tivity, which appeared to receive its

_final solution in a finding of the Privy i
Council for the union.

PAYOFF TO KUSYCH
But Kus_vch started the actions all
over again, prompted and sponsored
sub rosa by the CMA, and is now busy

addressing Boards of Trade across Can-
ada in a fund—raising' tour to pay the
costs of over $14,000 levied onhim by

This. of course, amounts to provid-
ing the means of a covert payoff by
the bosses, since every meeting can
raise $1,000 or more for a lecture which
all who have heard" Kusych talk agree
wouldn’t be worth a cigarette stub.

In evident preparation and to pro-
vide a lead’ to local Boards of Trade,
this story was run in the. magazine,
violently slanted, but then some agency
at present unknown but suspected ‘on
pretty solid grounds to be the CMA,
sent reprints of.’ the article to every

employee of the shipyards, using the‘

very latest -mailing lists.

BARGATNING TOUGHER

Unparalleled protraclion of Mine-
Mill negotiations in most operatio'ns,,
although some successes have been
won indicate also that the bosses hope’
to make inroads this winter and‘ next
year against unions in this industry.

With depression thunderheads loom-
so blackly on the economic horizon that
even the Unemployment Insurance
people last week admitted the immedi-
ate future looks gloomy for the thous-
ands already out of work, reaction un-
doubtedy feels that the climate is about
right for heating up the campaign
against unions.
