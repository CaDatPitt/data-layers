Local 711 Contract Provides
Gains of 43.6 Cents per Hour

FAIRVIEW, Pa.——A doubling of pension benefits, impressive health and wel-
fare improvements, and good wage gains are among the many features of a new three-
year contract. agreement between Mine-Mill Local 711 and the Parker White Metal

Covering 268 workers, who enthusiastically ratified last month’s settlement,
the contract is estimated as providing 41.6 cents per hour in gains over that period. V
Effective Oct. 1, pension benefits were doubled from $2 to $4 per «month per

year of service. Additionally, the program was amended to provide a guaranteed $100

disability pension without any offset on Social Security. The new $100 rate, twice the
old guarantee, will cover all existing disability pensioners.
A‘widow’s pension, one of the improvements that Mine-Mill will go after in

its nationwide bargaining in 1966
and 1967, was won. In the event
of a worker’s death, his widow
will receive an amount based on
half the number of years of his
service for the rest of her life,
even if she remarries. The pen-
sion plan, like the rest of the con-
tract, runs for three years, put-
ting Local 711 in good position

Workers Unanimously OK _
New Barth Sm-elting Pact

NEWARK, N. J.-—-Members of Mine-Mill Local 482
on Sept. 28 unanimously ratified a new three-year con-
tract with the Barth Smelting and Refining Company

The board action thus confirms statements made by

to negotiate further pension im-
provements following the indus-

which provides general wage increases totaling 19 cents
an hour over that period, plus additional hikes ranging
from five to 1'7 cents an hour for 44 of the 78 workers at _

Mine-‘Mill early in May, when the union’s petition was

filed, that the Inco workers want
another vote on which union will
represent them. M o nth s of

I painstaking investigation turned

up nothing to negate that fact.’

. In the bargaining unit of 14_,-
569 employees, 7,21-Vt or Just 3

‘ hair under 50 percent signed

Mine-Mill application cards and

paid the necessary $1 fee. This
is 658 more names than the_45 .
percent required by Canadian

labor law.

Immediate Bargaining

Final -board hearings‘ on the
application were held in Toronto
on Sept. 9, and since that time
there has been increased pres-
sure from the Sudbury com-
munity to have the vote as soon
as possible. The Inco workers
are well aware that 1965 is an
excellent year for bargaining
and that Mine-Mill, if victorious
in the election, can bargain with
the company immediately. The
present Steelworkers’ contract,

‘on the other hand, does not ex-

pire/for another year.

_ The Oct. 28 action of the
board came only four days after
a huge rally at the -Local 598
hall, at which appeals for an
early vote were . heard. Mine-
Mill also had collected thou-
sands of signatures on petitions
calling for an election as quick-
ly as possible.

Candidates Appeal

A week earlier, on Oct. 17,
the six candidates seeking fed-

. eral office from the Sudbury

-and Nickel Belt ridings, who

debated their political views at

‘ a ‘Mine-Mill meeting, signed a

petition to Premier Robarts
asking that the labor board
make an early decision on the

i5‘.”“’o‘t’éT Making the appeal

  

  were "Roger Landry, Conserva-

tive party candidate from Nickel
Belt; Bruce Kerr, Conservative,
from Sudbury; Ossie Godin,
Liberal, from Nickel Belt;
Rodger Mitchell, Liberal, from
Sudbury; Norm Fawcett, New

, Democratic party candidate from

, Nickel Belt; and Bud Germa,

NDP, from Sudbury.

An early decision by the
board, said Kerr, is synonymous
with an early vote at Inco. “It
will . . . accomplish what we
all want," he stated.

The Steelworkers attempted
this year to achieve a certifica-

tion vote at Falconbridge Nickel

here, where Mine-Mill has bar-
gaining rights. Labor board

'  figures. however, showed them

to have fallen 119 cards or-five
percent short of the necessary
45 percent at the much smaller
_lj"~alconbridge operations.

UnofficiaIVoting Results

DENVER, Colo.-—-Unofficial returns from Mine-
Mill local unions in Districts 1 and 3 indicate that
Barney Rask and Verne Curtis, the incumbent board
members for the two districts, have won re-election.
The rank-and-file canvassing committee, slated to
meet here on Nov. 15, will make the official tally of
votes in these races and on two proposed constitu-
tional changes that union members throughout the
country voted on in the Oct. 19 referendum.

Indications too, are that the convention-backed

proposal to increase the per capita payment to the-
international union by 25 cents per member per

month in each of the next four years was narrowly

defeated in the balloting. «
William Lee, business "agent ‘for Local 25 in

the plant.

The wage increases for these employees, ‘in other
words, will range from 24 to 36 cents an hour over the

thre_e-year period.

The contract, outstanding for the secondary smelting
industry and estimated at a value in excess of '30 cents

an hour, breaks new ground
in a number of directions for
its section‘ of the non-ferrous
metals industry.

The across-the-board wage
hikes, effective Oct. 1 this year
and in 1966 and 1967, are five,
six, and eight cents an hour.
The many reclassifications took
effect Oct. 1, while other gains
in the agreement’s first year in-
clude an additional holiday, im-
proved shift differentials, a bet-
ter vacation program, and jury
duty pay.

The additional holiday, the
worker’s birthday, makes a total
of nine. Shift differentials were
upped from 7 and 7 cents an
hour for the afternoon and

Tacoma, Wash., opposed Rask for the District 1
board spot, while Curtis was opposed by James
Buck, president of Local 51 in Rodeo, Calif., for the
District 3 board position.

vice-president; Irving Dichter, ‘secretary-treasurer; -

graveyard shifts to 10 and 15
cents per hour respectively.

Vacation Schedule -

After two years of service, the

' worker’ will receive 60 hours of

vacation time; after three years,

two weeks; and after 10 years,

three weeks. Effective Oct. 1,

1966, four weeks of vacation will

Low Wages Under Contract System

The federal government as employer: Most workers who do
laundry, janitorial, guard and food service work- for the federal
government are not direct employees of Uncle Sam, but work for

7 contractors who bid for the government work. Most of these em-

ployees are not covered by the minimum wage law. Congress has

_ ’ before it a bill to provide that contractors supplying these services
.~ must pay a minimum of $1.25 per hour to their employees.

Newspaper Strike Settled

Newspapers are back on the stands in New York after a 24-day

‘Times, other newspapers locked out employees. The biggest issue-

again—was automation. The union won agreement that the Times
would give six months notice of the planned introduction of auto-
mated equipment and a guarantee that full-time union members’
jobs would be protected; part time employees get lesser protection.

. Other issues were pensions and union security.

ACW Health Examination Program -

A health examination program, negotiated by the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers Baltimore Joint Board and employers in the
area, went into effect recently. It provides ACW members with
free yearly physical examinations and biennial eye examinations.
The program is financed by a company contribution, negotiated
two years ago, of one percent of the payroll of all employers under
contract with the Baltimore Jo-int Board of ACW.

Upon application for an examination, a member is referred

  first to a local medical laboratory which runs all the routine tests
';._*——chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, blood count, etc. The results ‘
  . oﬁjthe tests are forwarded to the member’s doctor, who uses them
~ , _'to supplement his own examination. Results of the tests and exam-

inations, ‘together with recommendations for treatment, specialized
consultation, etc_., are forwarded then to the medical director of
the health examination program and reviewed by him. He also can

~ suggest further studies or treatment.

All ‘records, constituting a complete medical history of the

’ <membe_r, are kept on file, but are the property of the member only,
fa_r_ld neither the union nor the employer has access to them except

Victory for BLFE in

Commerce Committee Recommendation

Latest development in the fight between railroad operators and
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen is the
decision of the Senate Commerce Committee, following 18 days of
hearings, to recommend further negotiation between BLFE and
the carriers. At issue is the award of an unprecedented compulsory
arbitration, ordered by Congress, which allowed the operators to
lay off thousands of locomotive. helpers. When it ordered compul-
sory arbitration two years ago, Congress also provided for a review
of the situation at the end of a two-year period.

The committee’s recommendation for further negotiation is
regarded by BLFE as a victory. The operators had asked for ex-
tension of the award for another two years. _

The Labor Department and ‘the National Mediation Board will
be reporting periodically to the Senate Committee on the progress
of negotiations. ’ .

The major point made by the union since the layoff of locomo-
tive helpers.is _a big increase in railroad accidents, which BLFE
attributes to the increased hazard involved in one-man locomotive

operation. . * *. *
Why Labor Fought for Medicare,

Government experts figure that Medicare coverage, if pur-
chased privately from insurance carriers, would cost well over

will be $4.40 per month, or $52.80 per year each for the employee
and the employer. 9 - . f ,

Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley
' Act (already done by the House),
increase the federal minimum
., wage and extend its coverage

(as approved by the House Edu-

cation and Labor Committee),

1 and improve the unemployment
compensation system.

. , Two other House - p a s s e d
measures also must receive Sen-
ate concurrence next year-the
federal mine safety bill for the

‘ non-ferrous metals industry and
an amendment to the Coal Mine
Safety Act which would extend
its coverage to small mines em-
ploy—ing 14 or fewer workers.

In addition, if the achieve-
ments of this Congress are to
be made as meaningful as pos-

-sible, effective implementation

and administration must be car-

ried out ‘by the Johnson admin-
istration. This is particularly
true in such areas as the-new

Voting Rights Act, which pro-

vides for federal registrars; the

expanded War on Poverty,
which has encountered stiff at-
tacks in many parts of the coun-
try; and the newly-created Cab-
inet level Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Affairs, set up to
deal with the massive and grow-
ing problems of America’s cities.

Congress and the administra-
tion thus have plenty of uncom-

pleted business to attend to in ’66.

Many Achievements

Yet, while Congress chalked
up a few debits this year (such
as the House-passed resolution
“approving” U.S.
against the threat of “subver-
sive domination” in Latin Amer-
ica—a resolution which quickly
» brought ’a flood of protests from
.. South and Central American
leaders), by and large the 89th

3 - Congress in its first session, aid-

ed by President Johnson, estab-

.lished ‘an excellent record. The
following are only a few of the
"many legislative highlights of
1965:

O'Medicare — a program to
cover most of the hospital, nurs-
ing, and related medical costs
of those persons over 65, to be
financed by an increase in So-
cial Security payments —- was

finally passed. The American-
Medical Association’s perennial
charge "of “socialized medicine”
this year didn’t do its job. The
vote in the House was 313 to 115;
in the Senate, 68 to 21.

Included in the bill was a sup-.
'_plement:ary voluntary program
to cover doctor bills, diagnostic
tests, and some drugs. Partici-
pants will pay $3 a month for
such insurance, which will be
matched by the government.
The medicare bill also provides

'a seven percent increase in So-
__,,,,_cial Security retirement bene-

»__‘v'-7? ‘fits, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1965.

, 0' Federal aid to education . . .
Its first year cost‘ estimated at

$1.3 billion, this bill was de-.

signed particularly to provide
"assistance to elementary and

secondary schools in districts
with large numbers of children
from low-income, families, al-
thouglr more than 90' percent of
the school districts throughout

- the country are expected to re-
ceive federal grants.

A Includedin the measure are

’ funds for books and library ma- .

-terials, a program to establish
community-wide 'supplem,entary

education —, centers and services,
and an authorization for improv-
ing educational . research.

In- the area of higher educa-
tion, Congress approved a ‘bill

The measure sets up a Na-
tional Teacher Corps, whose per-
sonnel will work in slum areas,
and establishes a p r o g r a m
through which students fro-m low
and middle-income families can
obtain interest-free loans for col-

'lege and those from higher-in-

come families can get low-in-
terest loans. ~

0 A new voting rights law
eliminates literacy tests and
other such tests used to./ deny
to anyone the privilege of voting
in states and counties where
less than 50- percent of the per-

sons of voting age participated

in the 1960 elections. The bill
also empowers federal regis-
trars to register voters in areas
w h e r e discrimination against
minority groups has existed.
,An attempt to include a ban

tions in ‘Mississippi, Alabama,

ed in the Senate, which had to

bill passed in the first session
was an amendment to the Lan-
drum-Griffin Act which removed
discriminatory provisions affect-
ing the bonding of union offi-
cials. The change will save
about 25 percent on bonding
costs.

O'The 1965 Housing Act ex-
tends for four years the urban
renewal program and calls for
60,000 additional public housing
units per year. Therent subsidy
plan, one of the few really new
programs adopted by the Con-
gress, ran into trouble at the
end of the session when the
House killed the appropriation
of funds necessary for its im-
plementation. Designed to aid
the low-income family, the bill
was snafued through an appar-
ent administrative mistake
which would have made families
earning as much as.$25,000 a
year eligible for such subsidies.

mocratic majorities in both chambers, wrapped up itsfirst session on Oct.123_,-
domestic front. The Johnson administration saw this Congress enact many-—‘
tion reform—which had been the unfulfilled goals of severa’l‘__j%‘_

in 19-65, as it has donelfor many years, it saw no final
’s top priorities. To strengthen its progressive record, the Congress must in 1966 repeal '

The appropriation may be re-
stored next year when the snarls
are untangled.

O The old national - origins
quota system that favored the
immigration of northern Euro-
peans was junked in favor of a
new plan, effective in 1968,
which will favor relatives of U.S.
citizens and foreigners with spe-
cial skills. Although expected
to slightly reduce total immigra-
tion, it should distribute new
citizenship rights among people
from more nations.

Many other important mea-
sures were approved, among
them a four-year farm program,
expanded public works pro-
grams, extension of the Man.-
power Development and Train-
ing Act, several other hea-lth
measures, including ones ap-
propriating funds for mental
health centers and providing
grants to medical and dental
schools, a $4.7 billion cut in ex-
cise taxes to take effect in
stages over the next three-years,
establishment of —a National
Foundation on Arts and Humani-
ties, anti-pollution bills, and a
bill designed to beautify the na-
tion’s highways by the removal
of billboards and junkyards.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

7 November. ‘I965

MINE-MILL MEMBERS AND OTHER SUDBURY CITIZENS

Company Try for cheap Settement
At Ground ting loomed to Fail

 by Irving Dichter
 . International Secretary-Treasurer
” and AS&R Council Coordinator
NE HUNDRED AND TWENTY members of our union have
been on strike at the Ground Hog mine of ASARCO since the
middle of July. Ground Hog is a zinc mine in Silver City, New
Mexico. Though the number of people involved in the strike is
V , comparatively small, the issues involved are of importance to every
" member of the union. .
‘Ground Hog reopened at the beginning of this year after having
- been shut down for close to seven years. What prompted the com-
, pany to reopen was the continuing strong demand for zinc and the
"- favorable price situation. When the mine reopened, zinc was selling
'. at 141/2.cents a pound. ‘ '
, The issues at stake in the strike are very simple. The company
_' is trying to impose a substandard contract which our memlership
 will not accept. From the very beginning of negotiations, the com-
, 1 pany insisted that it could not and would not meet the standards
iv, established by the union throughout the ASARCO chain and the rest
1 of the industry. This meant a very low wage scale with a common
I labor rate approximately 50 cents an hour less than that prevail-
ing in the major sections of the industry . . . a health and welfare
,,.-plan in-no way comparable to that covering other ASARCO work-
‘ rs . . . no pension and no security.-severance plan. The company,
rthermore, would not consider acommon expiration date with
e rest of the ASARCO workers.
- . ‘k * ‘k
HE COMPANY tried to justify its position by a variety of ex-
. planations. It claimed Ground Hog was a marginal operation.
' ».'I_§liat may very well have been when the price of zinc was 10 cents
, pound and there was more metal than customers. But at present
.’ rices, Ground Hog can be as" profitable as any other mining opera-
.- ion in’ the country.
I . The company, further claimed that there should be a wage-
fringe differential between zinc mining operations and those pre-
”-vailing in copper. This idea has been ‘
. _promoted by the operators for years, and
 - in. some areas they have made it stick.
~  _Wha_te,ver_ its original justification, today
-"it has as little _validity as a mule in a
 L‘ mine.“ The profit figures of the major
' -"zinc and lead producers are as good and
‘rising as fast these days as those of any
of the companies in basic copper.
A. And Ground Hog is not just another,
nline operated by somesmall company
"which has a difficult time meeting the H 
..prevailing rates. It is owned by one of Dichter
, * the largest mining, smelting and refining companies in the world.
- ASARCO this year will probably recordthe greatest net profit in
, . its’ history. Whatever comes out of Ground Hog, ASARCO is a
7  . _ -company in every way comparable to Kennecott, Anaconda, and
4‘  Phelps Dodge. * * *
‘ HE COMPANY’S resistance to a standard agreement may be
prompted by considerations which have nothing to do with» the
demand for zinc, its price, or ASARCO’s profit figures. The com-
pany may have a commitment to some of the other operators in the
Silver City area to keep a lid on wages and fringes. Silver City is
potentially a booming mining area and the only company in the
’ M area paying standard rates is Kennecott.

    

  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
    
   
  
  
   
   
   
    
 
  

eyvailing in the Coeur d’Alenes. There the companies, including

ASARCO, have ‘succeeded in setting up an isolated pattern of bar-
gaining. They seem committedto each other to maintain i.t, regard-
less of the settlements throughout the rest of the industry. Their
A’ success to date is easily explainable. The workers in the Coeur
V V d’Alenes were beaten into submission after a lengthy strike and
’= _ ‘ then divided into numerous unions. »

. ~k * ‘A’
UT SILVER CI_'I‘Y is not the Coeur d’Alenes. If ASARCO is
,‘ maintaining its bargaining position to protect substandard
 rates at New Jersey and American Zinc, it will have to keep Ground
Ilogclosed for a long time. The Silver City workers are not split
M. . in three or four different unions. Both the International Union and
l . _Local 890, the parent local of the Ground Hog workers, are prepared
~ for a lengthy strike.
 The International Union is contributing $500 a week towards
- the support of the Ground Hog strikers. When school opened some
5 two months ago, the 1,000 members of Local 890 assessed them-
.selves_$5_each to provide for the children’s’school needs. Money
jlst bleginnmg to come from other ASARCO locals in support of the
es r1 e. -
 Our leadership and membership in New Mexico together with
- the International Union are determined that there will be no sub-
f -standard wages and workingconditions in the Silver City area from
27the.A‘n‘1erican Smelting and Refining Company.

House-0Ked “RTW" Repealer
Faces '66 Senate Showdown

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The U.S. Senate on Oct. 11 turned down by a 45 to 47 roll-call vote a mo-
tion by Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) to end an eight-day filibuster against making HR
77, the House-passed bill to repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, the pending business be-
fore the Senate. This was 17 votes shy of the two-thirds necessary to close off such “debate,” and
the following day Mansfield abandoned his attempts to achieve Senate passage of the measure this

year.

With the weary Senators anxious to adjourn and get home, the vote on the filibuster can hardly
be taken as a real test of strength on the issue of repealing the so-called “right-to-work” law. At
least 52 of the 100 Senators, it is figured, are committed to support repeal, but the majority this year

did not get the chance to exert its will on the issue.

At the same time, however, the postponement until 1966 is viewed by RTW forces as an important
victory. They believe, or at least hope, that some Senators will find it more difficult to vote for re-

peal next year, when Congressional elections are again held. Nine-
teen states now have “right-to-work” laws, which would be wiped
out by repeal of Section 14(b).

Passed in House By- I8-Vote Margin

Backed by the Johnson administration and the top priority goal
of the American labor movement, the repealer bill was approved by
a 221 to 203 vote in the House on July 28. Church groups and civil
rights organizations have joined labor in the campaign for the bill.

Commenting on the fight by RTW forces to save Section 14(b),
in an article in the Oct.-Nov. issue of Labor Today, Mine-Mill Presi-
dent A. C. Skinner notes that all of the numerous state “right-to
wor ” campaigns “pa1e by comparison.”

“One thing does stand out, however,” adds Skinner, “even at
this stage. A ﬁrm determination and unity of all sections of labor
have overcome tremendous obstacles.”

Congress will reconvene in January, after a breather of a few
months. As noted earlier, 1966 is an election year——one which its
members will be anxious to wrap up early and hit the campaign
trail. Leading the filibuster forces against the 14(b) repealer is
Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-Ill.). The renewal of the re-
pealer battle should be launched early in the sssion by Sen. Mans-
field.

In the House, 21 Republicans joined 200 Democrats in voting

for repeal, while 117 Republicans and 86 Democrats opposed the-

measure. Following is the roll-call vote of the Congressmen from

Oct. l4 Meeting

NEW YORK CITY——S0me 40

delegates, representing Mine- ,

Mill, the United Auto Workers,
the Steelworkers, and the Inter-
national Union of Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers,
met here on Oct. 14 to discuss
coordinated bargaining with the
Anaconda American Brass
chain. _
The meeting—the most suc-
cessful and united to date, ac-
cording to the delegation from
Mine-Mill Local 593 in Buffalo,

N. Y.—was called by the Indus- _

trial Union . Department of the

AFL-CIO. Other Anaconda lo-.

cations represented were ‘~ To-
ronto, Ont.; Ansonia and Wa-
terbury, Conn.; Detroit, Mich.;

rKenosha, Wisc.; Paramount,
and -

Calif.; Hastings, N. Y.;
Rariton, N. J.

Bargaining goals developed at
the conference s t r e s s e (1 im-
proved pensions and job securi-
ty measures ‘which would more
adequately protect the younger

‘ Anaconda“ employee’. In" ’a‘d_di‘-
'tion to the need for a doubling.
‘ of normal pension benefits, the

delegates dis c u s s e d supple-

mented pensions to allow for.

early retirement of senior Ana-
conda workers. ’
It was agreed that the unity
of all unions representing prop-
erties in the chain must be in-

creased and maintained in or- .
\ der to achieve the greatest

success in the next round of
negotiations. The rank-and-file

-membership of the various

unions, said the Buffalo dele-

gates, are strongly behind and,

pushing the unified approach _to
bargaining.
Delegates called for an ex-

panded negotiating committee, '

representative of all of the
unions in the chain, to meet
with the company to negotiate
wages, pensions, health and
welfare improvements, holidays
and vacations, preferably at the
New York headquarters of Ana-
conda.

Attending the conference from
Local 593 were President Pat
Pacile, Robert Felton,
Olear, Clayton Gorn, and Jo-
seph Scioli, international repre-

‘sentative. They made a full re-

port to the membership of the
local at a meeting on Oct. 17.

The next meeting of the vari-
ous unions will be held in Chi-
cago, Ill.

Excerpts from Pope Paul's U. N. Speech

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.—Monday, Oct. 1; . . . an
historic event . . . Pope Paul VI, the Holy Father of the
Roman Catholic Church, makes a unique pilgrimage
from the Vatican to speak before the General Assembly

’ of the United Nations. His address, delivered in French,
is an eloquent plea for brotherhood and for peace.

Excerpts from Pope Paul’s« address follow:

Now, you here represent all peoples, allow us to tell you that
we have a message, a happy message, to deliver to each one of

. you and to all.

We might call our message a ratification, a solemn moral rati-

«fication of this lofty institution.

‘. . . this organization represents the obligatory path of modern

= civilization and of world peace . .

. The peoples of the earth turn

to the United Nations as the last hope of concord and peace . . .

tit

=l=

The edifice which you have constructed must never fall; it must
be perfected, and made equal to the needs which world history will

. present.

You mark a stage in "the development of mankind from which
retreat must never be admitted but from which it is necessary that

advance be made.

You give sanction to the great principle that the relations be-
tween peoples should be regulated by reason, by justice,‘ by law,
by negotiation;, not by force, nor by violence, not by war, not by

fear or by deceit.

Thus it must be. Allow us to
congratulate you for having had
the wisdom to open this hall to

the younger peoples, to those

states which have recently at-
tained independence and na-

' A tional freedom.

\ .

A

=l=>l:=!¢

In the ideological construction
"of mankind, there is on the nat-
ural level nothing superior to
this. Your ‘vocation is to make

brothers not only of some but of

all peoples, a difficult undertak-
ing. Is there anyone who does

not see the necessity of coming

thus progressively to the estab-
lishment of a world authority,
able to act efficaciously on the

-juridical and political levels?

Advance always! We go fur-
ther, and say: Strive to bring
back among you any who have
separated themselves, and study
the right method of uniting to
your pact of brotherhood, in
honor and loyalty, those who do

not yet share in it.

Act so that those still outside
will desire and merit the confi-
dence of all; and then be gen-
erous in granting such confi-
dence. . . . Ensure that the re-
ciprocal trust which here unites
you, and enables you to do good
and great things, may never be
undermined or betrayed.

1: 3?! ill

Thus, let no one, inasmuch as
he is a member of your union,
be superior to the others: Never
one above the other.

This is the formula of equality.
‘ Men cannot be brothers if
they are not humble.

It is pride, no matter how
legitimate it may seem to be,
which provokes tension and
struggles for prestige, for pre-
dominance, colonialism, egoism;
that is, pride disrupts brother-
hood. ,1; .~;. ,3

And now our message reaches
its highest point. . . . Not the
ones against the others, never
again, never more!

Listen to the lucid words of
the great departed John Ken-
nedy, who‘ proclaimed, four
years ago: “Mankind must put
an end to war, or war will put
an end to mankind.”

Many words are not needed
to proclaim this loftiest aim of
your institution. It suffices to
remember that the blood of mil-
lions of men, that numberless

 .5. Supreme C ourt Rebuffs
nti-Union Kohler Company

WASHINGTON, D.C.——The ‘Supreme Court, in denying last month a hearing ‘

sought by the Kohler Company, upheld a 1964 ruling by the National Labor Re-

,,,_,__,_l_a_tions Board ordering the reinstatement of 57 strike leaders who were fired during a
year strike against the company by Local 833 of the United Auto Workers.

. The NLRB order, which also stated that unfair labor practices by Kohler had
 ' brought on the strike, had earlier been upheld by the U. S. Court of Appeals here.

Hailing the decision of the high court in rejecting" the appeal, UAW Secretary-
Treasurer Emil Mazey said it would appear to “any reasonable person” to be the end

of the road for company
0 p p o s i t i o n to reinstatement.

“But long ago,” he added, “we

stopped counting on what- ap-
“ pears reasonable.”

Contempt Charge

Kohler has, failed to reinstate
other workers and pay them for
lost wages in compliance with a
1962 court decree enforcing an
earlier decision of the NLRB.
A contempt of court charge
against «the company because
of this failure is now pending

--bef,ore_~the Circuit Court of Ap-

— rpeals. Edward M. DuQuaine, a

federal court special master,

 -be found‘ in civil contempt and
 be ordered to pay several mil-

date for future hearings.

In August, 1960, the NLRB
ordered the company to rein-
state all strikers who wished to
return to work with the excep-
tion’ of a group of 77 and then
to bargain with the employees.
While a limited reinstatement
offer was made, the NLRB said,
Kohler still refused to bargain.

Eligible for back pay, if Du-
Quaine’s- recommendations are
upheld, are about 430 employees
who worked a 32-hour week for
about six months after return-
ing ‘to their jobs in September,
1960,. and about 520 strikers who
refused to return to work, say-
ing that the reinstatement»
wasn’t adequate because of the
company’s continued refusal to

the Supreme Court—an addi-
tional 57 workers_ would be rein-
stated with back pay plus in-

vote, said that Kohler “at no
time intended to accept the union
as the collective bargaining rep-
resentative to be dealt with in

which unites you, with an oath
which must change the future
history of the world:

No more war, war never
again! Peace, it is peace which
must guide the destinies of peo-
plesand of all mankind.

Peace, as you know, is not
built up only by means of poli-
tics, by the balance of forces
and of interests. It is construct-
ed with the mind, with ideas,
with works of peace.

You labor in this great con-
struction. But you are still at
the beginnings.

.. . it is towards that new
history—peaceful, -truly human,
history, as promised by God to
men of good will, that we must
resolutely march; the roads
thereto are already well marked
out for you; and the first is that
of disarmament.

If you wish to be brothers, let
the arms fall from your hands.
One cannot love while holding
offensive arms. '

Those armaments, especially
those terrible arms, which mod-
ern science has given you, long
before they produce victims and
ruins, nourish bad feelings, cre-
ate nightmares, distrust and
somber resolutions; they de-
mand enormous expenditures;
they obstruct projects of union
and useful collaboration; they
falsify the psychology of peoples.

Let unanimous trust in this
institution grow, let its authority

increase; and this aim, we be-‘

lieve, will be secured.

We rejoice in the knowledge
that many of you have consid-
ered favorably our invitation,
addressed to all states in the
cause of peace from Bombay,
last December, to divert to the
benefits of the developing coun-
tries at least a part of the sav-
ings, which could be realized by
reducing armaments.

We here renew that invitation,
trusting in your sentiment of hu-
manity and generosity.

You are not satisfied with fa-

greater step forward, one de-

This aspect of the organization
of the United Nations is the
most beautiful; it is its most

it is the.world’s greatest hope; it

THE MINE-MILL UNION

November, 1965 If

THIS GROUP OF CHILDREN FROM THE AMERICAN FORK TRAINING SCHOOL FOR THE RETARDED presented an excellent and touching program of
vocal and instrumental music at an Oct. 13 luncheon meeting of the officers and stewards of Local 392 and their wives. The Mine—Mill local in Magna,
Utah has been active recently in collecting clothing for the school's use and in doing some repair work at the institution, located some 40 miles from

Salt Lake City.

MAGNA, Utah ——- A touching program

of vocal and instrumental music by 24

children from the American Fork Training School for the Retarded highlighted a
luncheon on Oct. 13 for the officers and stewa1'-ds of Mine-Mill Local 392-and their

wives.

Saying that the excellent entertainment was “humbling and heart-warrning,”
District 3 Board Member Verne Curtis added, “It would be difficult to describe the
impact” of the program, which was presesentecl in gratitude for the recent clothing

drive of the local union for the school.

Curtis said he was sure that the 50 to 60

persons who viewed the performante all came away with the realization that their

less significant than they had
believed.

The entire group of young-
sters, many of whom are phys-
ically as well as mentally
handicapped, sang “I Am a
Child of God” to open the pro-
gram, which included musical
solos and ducts in addition to
other selections by the whole
group. A smaller group sang
“Count Your Blessings” and
other songs. '

"The program ended with the
singing of “May the Good Lord
Bless and Keep You.”

Start of Drive

Local 392’s campaign to col-
lect clothing to donate to the
school was sparked by Ellis
Burrell, who some months ago,
together with his wife Ella, had
driven to the institution to
deliver a small bundle of
clothes that they felt the school
could use. At that time, they
visited the various depart-
ments, made inquiries, and con-
cluded that there was a great
need for voluntary assistance.

Ellis brought the matter up
at a meeting of Local 392, sug-
gesting that the union sponsor
a project of clothing donations.
Since that time, he had made
several trips to the school with
bundles of clothes. Collection
boxes have been placed in each

In addition, on Saturday, Oct.
16, 11 carpenters, both active
and retired members of Local
392, went to the American Fork
School, located some 40 miles
from Salt Lake City, to lay 66
cartons of tile. Although the
tile had been purchased by the
school several months ago, it
had neither enough trained per-
sonnel nor adequate funds to

have the tile laid in the school’s_

large hall. '

The 11 men—Burrell, Warren

build new cabinets and to put
doors on those without them.

Undersi-affed

Up to 1400 mentally retarded
persons are quartered at the
school. While staff members
have “a great deal of patience,

perseverance, and natural-

ability,” according to the Bur-
rells, the institution needs more
trained personnel and addi-
tional finances.

Mrs. Dora Rees, the director
of voluntary service at the
school, accompanied the group
of children. to the Local 392
luncheon, as did Mrs. Lydia
Kirkpatrick, the music director,
and Mrs. Norma Lewis, the
school matron.

Bond Proposal
Clobbered by
Arzona   Voters

Overwhelming rejection by
Arizona voters on Oct. 19 of -a
proposal to allow the state’s
legislature to borrow up to $100
million through the issuance of
bonds means that other sources
of revenue must be found if the
state’s colleges and institutions
are to be able to meet their
immediate building needs.

Preliminary estimates are
that their requests may total
about $30 million. The State
Planning and Building Commis-

sion, which began hearings late

last month, plans to meet again
in November.

The bonding proposal, which
was strongly supported by

Democratic Governor Sam God-I

dard, would have provided money
now for building purposes, while

allowing the state to pay over’

an extended period of time.
The proposition, however, was
snowed under by a 41/2 to 1

margin by the voters. Some__

220,000 persons went to the polls
—about 46 percent of the turn-
out in the state for last fall’s
presidential election.

Also going down to defeat was
a companion -proposal which
would have allowed the legis-
lature to go ahead with the bond
issues without further voting by
the people. i L , -

THE MINE-MILL UNION

IOU Stock Option Programs

WASHINGTON, D.C.-—Legislation granting to the Federal Power Commission

A «control over restricted stock options for top executives of utility companies would

benefit both the ordinary stockholders of the companies and their customers, main-

- tains U. S. Sen. Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.), who on Sept. 28 introduced a bill which would
give the FPC broad power in this regard.
The restricted stock option——explained by the private utility companies as an
“incentive” to attract and hold competent executives——is a device, states Metcalf,
. through which the “insiders” are cleaning up, while the stock held by ordinary stock-

hen the “option” is exercised,
a e executive pays, not the cur-
» rent price, but the price at the
‘time the “option” was granted.

‘ He is. not obligated, should the

‘price not be up, to take the
stock.

On Oct. 5, 1959, Metcalf
cites as an ‘example, J. E.
Corette, president of the Mon-
tana Power Company, pur-
chased 30,000 shares of the com-
pany’s stock — a transaction

- whiuh netted him $370,000. He
' didn’t have to pay the $23.75 per

share which was the selling
‘price at that time. Instead, he

' " paid less than‘$11.50'per ‘share-

the price a few years earlier
when his “option” had been
' granted. Co-rette paid, in other

- words some $342,230 for stock

worth $712,500.

Principal Speaker
V The featured speaker at the
joint "Montana Associated Utili-

 ties annual convention-Northwest
.Public Power Association work-

shop banquet in Missoula, Mont.
last month, Sen. Metcalf said

that millions of dollars in “out--
 rate” utility stock is being sold

to officials of at least 324 power
companies on option deals.
His bill, should it receive Con-

2’ gressional approval, would re-

quire FPC approval of power
company security issues and
would “put the burden of proof

' ‘on the companies” by requiring

them’ to prove to a competent
agency that stock options are
appropriate for public service

~ u companies.

.?, Faces Tough Campaign
Up for re-election next year,
‘Sen. Metcalf has, in the past
two years, made a series of
speeches in the Senate aimed
at the abuses of private power
companies. He thus has earned
, the opposition of the Montana
one of the
state’s biggest companies, which
is expected to_ pour money
‘freely into the campaign to de-
feat the Montana Democrat.
The Anaconda Company, an-
other «industrial giant in Mon-
_tana, also is unhappy with Met-
calf because of his vigorous
support for federal mine safety
legislation. '
“There are those who con-

, being watered-down in value.

5 xecutives at some later date when, in most cases, the market value will have risen.

M9

tend,” wrote Metcalf in an ar-
ticle in The Nation last year,
“that the stock option is per-
haps a superfluous incentive for
people’ making $75,000 a year
(Corette’s salary as president
of Montana Power), and I tend
to agree.” His major concern,
however, he continued, is not
with stock options generally, but
with their use “in one of the
most stable, least competitive,
most profitable enterprises in
America—the electric light and
power industry.”

Since the industry —— the na-
tion’s largest, with about 12
percent of the capital invested

.in all American business—“is

not competitive,” continued Met-
calf, “and since the consumer
is forced to foot the bill for
company operating costs and
profit, the question should be
asked whether the investor-
owned utilities (as they like to
call themselves) or IOUs (as I
prefer to call them) should be
allowed to use the restricted
stock option.”

The record profits racked up
by the industry are partially
due to technological advances,
says Metcalf, but mainly be-
cause ,“it is a monopoly selling
a necessity for which demand
is constantly increasing.”

Limited Jurisdiction
The Federal Power Commis-
sion’s jurisdiction over security
issues is presently limited to the
few independent operating com-

panies that are organized out- '

side the states in which they
operate, or that are organized
and operating in states which
lack a state agency authorized
to police issuance of securities.
Such state regulatory agencies,
maintains Metcalf, “are even
more susceptible to ‘taming’
than federal agencies.” “In
some states,” he says, they “are
little more than industry lap
dogs.”

The FPC, however, in the
summer of 1964 in the Black
Hills Power and Light Com-
pany case, rejected by a 3 to 2
vote the company’s application
to set up an option plan for top

executives on the ground that

the plan was “not compatible

 

U. S. Sen. Lee Metcalf
Protecting the Consumer

with the «public interest.”
Montana Power, which used
to be a New Jersey corporation
operating in Montana, has es-
caped FPC jurisdiction over
security issues by moving to
Montana. Some 750,000 shares,
or 10 percent of its total com-
mon stock issuance, have been

‘subject to “option” sale.

In his Nation article, Sen. Met-
calf also pointed to G. L. Mac-
Gregor, president of Texas
Utilities, as a major beneficiary
of such stock options. With an
annual salary of $92,150, Mac-
Gregor, who will receive more
than $33,000 a year when he
retires, “has also realized a
windfall profit of $350,000 under
the stock-option gimmick,” said
Metcalf. -

The Montana Democrat said
he had singled out as examples
Texas and Montana “because
the IOUs in these states are the
top contenders for the ‘light
overcharge’ championship of
the United States.” The rate of
return for the major companies
in those states is about nine
percent-50 percent more than
the six percent rate considered
reasonable by most regulatory
commissions and utility experts.

Arguments Destroyed

that stock options are needed to
get and keep competent execu-
tives, thereby providing better

 fMef calf Seeks Regulation Of Three More Unions Lend

“Conspiracy” Defense Aid

Three more international unions have registered in the past
month their support for the six remaining defendants in the Mine-
Mill “conspiracy” case, while, at the same time, contributions to
the defense fund have been rolling in from a large number of in-

dividuals and organizations.

At the end of October, too, defense attorneys Telford Taylor,
Nathan Witt, and George Francis filed with the Supreme Court a
reply to a government brief of Oct. 22. The high court, which
hands down such decisions on Mondays, may well decide either
this month or next on whether or not to accept the case. If ac-
ceptance is granted,_ arguments probably will be heard sometime
this winter, with a decision likely prior to the court’s adjournment

in June.

In an Oct. 12 letter from General President S. Frank Raftery,
the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of
America, an AFL-CIO union, indicate’d its full support of and agree-

ment with the position taken by
the American Civil Liberties Un-
ion, the National Farmers Un-
ion, and seven national labor
unions in a “friend-of-the-court”
brief urging a Supreme Court
review of the case. The union,
said Raftery, has written to
U. S. Attorney GeneralNicholas
Katzenbach of its opposition to
government-imposed 10 y a It y
tests, such as the since-repealed
Taft-Hartley requirement for
non-communist affidavits, and
to prosecutions based on the
doctrine of “conspiracy.”
Woodworkers. Barbers

The International Woodwork-
ers of America, also affiliated
with the AFL-CIO,‘ contributed
$250 to the defense fund, and a
donation was also received from

dressers, Cosmetologists and

Saying that the convictions of
the Mine-Mill defendants “would
be harmful to the whole cause
of American labor and the great
tradition of American justice
and fair play,” the Tri-State
Typographical Conference, meet-
ing in Pittsburgh, Pa. on Oct.

management which benefits both
company and consumer, the
FPC pointed out, in the Black
Hills case, that “the record
shows that without stock op-
tions the company has lost no
employees with a salary in ex-
cess of $7,000 per year except
by death or retirement.”

Noting that since 1956, when
Montana Power instituted its
stock option plan, the cost of
electricity it supplied has in-
creased, Metcalf said that the
same thing has been true for
the industry as a whole through-
out the country.

“The industry’s guideline to
success, it would seem,” accord-
ing to Metcalf, “is to pass all
cost increases on to the con-
sumer, but pocket all cost re-
ductions.” “You would never
know it to look at your electric
bill,” he said, that twice as
much electricity can now be
produced from a ton of coal as
was the case 20 years ago.

Incentives

Noting that little evidence
can be produced to show that
the stock option has provided
any sort of incentive benefitting
the consumer, he maintains that

- “plenty can be offered to sug-

gest that it provides an incen-
tive to keep rates and profits
so high that the market value of
stock is almost certain to rise.”

Virtually the same thing was

said by the FPC in the Black_

Hills case. “. . . the incentives
under stock option plans,” it
pointed out, “. . . tend naturally
to‘ divert management from
their responsibilities to the
public and to focus their atten-
tion on maximizing prices and
earnings inorder to push stock
quotations ever higher. . .”
Sen. Metcalf, one of the chief
proponents in the Senate of fed-
eral mine safety legislation, was
scheduled as a featured speaker
at the Mine-Mill international

‘convention in August. The rea-

son he was unable to attend was
that at that time there was a
threat of special interest legisla-
tion coming up designed to

weaken. rather, than strengthen .

which represents 31 local unions
in western Pennsylvania, north-
ern West Virginia, and western
Maryland and has a total mem-
bership of some 2,000, “are
leaders of a union which for
more than 70 years has carried
the banner of American trade
unionism against a group of
giant corporations in the non-
ferrous metals industry.”

The International Typographi-
cal Union is one of the labor or-
ganizations which on Sept. 20
joined the ACLU in filing the
“friend-of-the-court” brief. .

Mine-Mill Local 670 in Tren-
ton, N. J. last month voted a
$15 per month contribution to
the defense fund, which finances
the heavy legal expenses in-
volved in the “conspiracy”
case. Most locals are now do-
nating on a regular basis,

Contributions were received
in October, too, from locals of
other unions, from other or-
ganizations, and from many in-
dividuals. One woman from

she recalled with pride,-. ‘her

Advice on Miniature Radios

The November issue of‘ CONSUMER REPORTS finds note-
worthy differences in tone quality among 19 medium and top-priced
miniature radios tested by Consumers Union. The sets also differ
in economy of use and convenience of operation. As in the past
tests, there was no correlation between the number of transistors
and quality.

Some very good news for consumers:

List prices ranged from $10 to about $26, a significant drop
from the $30-$50 range that prevailed for the top-priced miniatures
tested by CU six years ago. The set that earned the highest rating
had a list price about 40% below the highest priced set.

‘If you don’t have access to CONSUMER REPORTS or don’t
find a good deal on one of the high-rated sets, you can perform
some tests of your own:

0 Try to tune in stations between 1100 and 1600 on the dial.

If you have trouble locating stations, try other sets.

0 Tune in a strong station and turn the set around. If the
volume changes disturbingly, try other sets.

0 Tune in a news broadcast from a strong st-ation while
standing in a noisy section of the store. Seevwhether you
can understand the announcer.

0 Tune in music from a strong station in a quiet spot to
judge tone quality. Avoid interference (noise) from
fluorescent lights.

Try to get the dealer to agree to an exchange privilege it the

set you "buy receives your favorite nearby stations poorly or not

at all. * * *

Permanent-Press Shirts Show Promise

The-newest non-wrinkle in men’s wear is the permanent-press
shirt, ,a, post-graduate version of the familiar wash-and-wear shirt.
Only, two early entries were available for pre-Christmas testing by
Consumers Union. A full-scale project of more brands will be re-
ported in a future issue. In the November issue of CONSUMER

‘ REPORTS, Consumers Union comes to a tentative conclusion that

this type of shirtis superior in some significant ways to the con-
ventional wash-and-wear type.
, The permanent-press process is a marriage of two basic ap-
proaches to wash-and-wear: blends of cotton with synthetics, and
usingresinsiset by heat treatment. Cotton alone,vtreated with resins
loses strength, but the polyester synthetics are unaffected by such
processing. The synthetics in the blended fabric compensate for
the loss of strength in the treated cotton...A key point in the per-
manent-press process is that the final curing takes place after the
shirt is made instead of in the flat fabric.

Seam puckering can be a problem\in permanent-press shirts.
But ,in.contrast to wash-and-wear shirts, the new type will reveal
any gseam-puckering by inspection before they are worn, not after
the first or second laundering. .

Among the conclusions in CONSUMER REPORTS are these:

0 The models tested were superior in strength and dura-

. .,_bility to most of the cotton wash-and-wear shirts report-

' ed on in November 1963 and about on a par with the un-
treated polyester-cotton blends tested at that time.

O'”'All the shirts tested yellowed somewhat after many
washings but ordinary bleach restored whiteness.

O The shirts were at least as comfortable in use as a com-
parable wash-and-wear shirt (the weather was hot and
humid).

O The permanent-press shirt, carefully laundered and

_ ‘dried, presented a better appearance than the wash-and
wear shirt, especially at the seams, and retained the ap-
pearance throughout the day.

The shirts performed best if machine washed at low tempera-
ture (about 100°), low agitation speed, and low spinning rate, pref-
erably in a small load followed by tumble-drying the load gently
with no heavy or large items such as towels or sheets included.

A permanent-press shirt so handled is likely to hold its press
for as many as 20 "cycles ‘of wear and laundering before gradually
losing some of its finish. Drip-drying was not quite so kind to the
shirts, but the traveler who must drip-dry may find ironing un-
necessary if he is willing to put up withrslight wrinkles for a short
while (the appearance improves after a brief period of wear).

It should be reemphasized that CU’s findings must be consid-
ered, tentative until completion of tine larger project.

Tips on Buying Chemistry Sets

The November issue of CONSUMER REPORTS points out that
the parent who wishes to introduce a child to chemistry can buy a

chemistry set for as little as $1 or as much as $40. The article
evaluates 24, sets of this popular Christmas gift representing the

three major brand lines and several other brands. It suggests some _
hazards to avoid and ways to get maximum value in your purchase. ‘

_ The $1 sets usually give chemicals, equipment and instructions
for about 10 experiments, and the accent often is on magic tricks

or “detective” work. The most expensive sets come packaged as_

miniature “laboratories” with an extensive array of chemicals and
toy versions of lab apparatus which Consumers Union found to vary
from poor to good. Educators consulted by CU were against the
selling of magic tricks as chemistry sets but CU concluded: “Some
' of the children might have fun with the set anyway.” _

Four of the sets of one manufacturer were rated Not Accept-
able because they ignored.certain important regulations under the
Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act, failing to carry prop-
er warnings on boxes and labels. Even with sets whose labels con-
form to FDA requirements, manuals sometimes warn inadequately
of hazards not covered by the law. CONSUMER REPORTS points
to such potential pitfalls as the following:

3 Alcohol lamps could quite easily leak onto work surfaces

3 q and clothingif mishandled and be ignited from the burn-
ing wick or a‘ match; —

Senate Subcommittee Attac: , y
On CU Thoroughly Discreditef

BOULDER, Colo.——Some 1,500 persons jammed the Glenn Miller Ballroom of the University o ‘
Colorado Memorial Center on Oct. 28 for a “teach-in” in support of civil liberties, held in respons -
to a brief reference to the university that was contained in a 256-page report prepared by the staff o
the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, entitled “The Anti-Viet Nam Agitation and the Teach-*_
Movement—The Problem of Communist Infiltration and Exploitation.” * A

Although only half apage of the lengthy document was devoted to CU, that section had be_en__s_‘ ._
thoroughly discredited at the ' " ‘
end of a week’s publicity that:

O Sen. Thomas Dodd (D-
Conn.), vice-chairman of
the subcommittee, an-
nounced that the section
would be removed from
copies of the report dis-
tributedin the future;

0 Sen. Gordon Allott (R-Colo.)
demanded that a subcom-
mittee aide responsible for
the erroneous material in
the CU section of the report
be identified and ﬁred;

0 John Love, Republican gov-
ernor of Colorado, warned
against a “witch-hunt” at
the university;

0 Sens. John L. McCle1l-an
(D-Ark.) and Roman
Hruska (R-Neb.), who are
members of the subcommit-
tee, admitted that they had
never seen that portion of
the report that had been
prepared by the subcommit-
tee staff;

0 Sen. Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
disavowed the part con-
cerning CU when he learned
thatit was based solely on
a report from an anony-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Mine-Mill History . . . Kendall, Montana

  State P
Federatt

The development of the Kendall State Memorial Park, where picnic sites and
recreational areas will be made available to Montana citizens, may be speeded up as

 
 

the result of a bill passed by the state legislature last session which transfers the jur-
isdiction for the state parks from the Highway Commission to the Department of Fish
and Game. The latter controls more funds for this type of developmental project.
Over 122 acres in what was the prosperous mining camp of Kendall early in the
century have been deeded to the state. A small portion of that land, once owned by
Local 111 of the Western Federation of Miners, was turned over to Montana last No-
vember by the Mine-Mill international executive board.
At the present time, only 3‘/-'_» lots in Kendall have not been deeded to the state,
Held by four elderly women, they can probably be obtained by legal proceedings when

the development work begins.

Long since a ghost town, the
Townsite of Kendall had been
made up of 1,292 lots. After the
closing down of the mining op-
erations in 1920, the town was
soon deserted by its inhabitants.
During the hard times of the
late 1920’s and early ’30’s, most
of the owners let their lots go to
Fergus County for delinquent
taxes.

$9-15 Million in Gold

The strike that produced the
mining camp at the foot of the
North Moccasin Mountains oc-
curred in the early 1890’s. How-
ever, the mines of Kendall,
credited with having produced
a certain $9 million and per-
haps up to $15 million in gold,
were not really developed until
after 1900, in the spring of
which Harry T. Kendall pur-
chased a parcel of land which
had been held, and let go, by
several other men. A corpora-
tion known as the Kendall Gold
Mining Company was soon es-
tablished and, by July, 1901, the
company was cyaniding 100 tons
of ore per day, ‘averaging $8
per ton. By May of the follow-
ing year, a new and more
modern-mill_of 500 tons daily
capacity had been completed.

As more and more families
moved into the camp, the need
for a school became apparent
and, in early September, 1901,
Kendall School District No. 37
was organized. A one-room log
cabin known as “Flanigan’s
Place” was used temporarily,
until, in September, 1903, a con-
tract was let for a new four-
room building. The bid: $3,875.

Union Organized

Soon after the gold mills be-
gan operations in Kendall, the
number of miners working in
the area increased considerably.
In early May, 1901, a local
union was organized and a hall
erected. In April, 1902, the
union was reorganized, under
the name
Union No. 111,” and became af-
filiated with the Western Fed-
eration of Miners. F. W. Brew-
ington was the president of the
local, which, by the beginning of
1903, had a membership of 160.
That January, the trustees pur-
chased a lot on which to build a

' ‘ Miners’ Union hospital.

The two-story frame building
‘was completed that spring. Pro-
viding a valuable service to the
entire community through the
years, the hospital contained a
doctor’s office, a small operat-
ing room, several rooms for
patients, and quarters for a
resident registered nurse and
operating staff.

Dr. Gaylord McKay was the
first resident physician at the
hospital, which was supported
by assessments of the union
members. Wages those days
averaged $5 per 8-hour day for
hard rock miners; $3.50 per day
for muckers and other workers.

Monthly Payments
Hospital and doctor charges
for the workers-and their fami-
lies I were covered by -monthly
payments of $1.50 by single men

and ‘$2.50 by married men. An‘

extra fee of $25 was charged for
obstetrical cases. Use of the
hospital and its staff was avail-
able to others in the com-
imunity, who -were charged for

 -the services. Their .p‘ay»ment1 of

four—room building was constructed in 1903 for $3,875,
replotcing Ct one-room log cctbin known as "Flc1niggn’s
Plctce" which l'lC{Cl been used. As mining operations began
being curfctiled in fall of 1912, the school discontinued the
use of first one room, then another, until it was completely
closed. At the time of this Charles E. Morris photo, there
were about 125 pupils. Teachers at the time were Arthur
R. Thompson, also the principal, Bessie Hogelcrnd, Maude
Morton, -and Lydict Vctllentyne.

$3.50 per day for using the hos-
pital went into its operating
fund. Dr. McKay, who was fol-
lowed by a Dr. Doty, Dr. Charles
W. Smith (1906-08), Dr. William
J. Lakey (1908-10), and Doctors
Patton and Brown, were paid
salaries from the fund, as were
the others on the hospital staff.

The doctors also could collect
fees for private practice, but
were restricted from making
trips into the countryside more
than 10 miles from the mining
camp.

Emma J. Bollman, Clyde
Winegar, and Catherine M. Mil-
ler served as nurses at the
Miners’ Union hospital-—Miss Mil-

ler for several months after the
last doctor had departed in 1918.
By that time, the mining opera-
tions were almost closed, there
were few people left in the
camp, and the hospital could no
longer be supported. At its peak,
the population of Kendall had
reached only about 1,500.

With the discontinuance of
mining in the locality, the hos-
pital was closed and the build-
ing later sold and moved away.
Title to the lot, however, was
retained by the union and final-
ly passed on to the 11/line-Mill
International, which paid the
taxes on the lot until deeding it
to the state last fall.

[Utah Site for Nuclear Explosion?

Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) says the Cactus mine in Beaver
County, Utah, owned by Tintic Lead Co., is under consideration as
the site of an underground nuclear explosion designed to shatter
a copper ore body so as to permit copper recovery by leaching in
place. This is just one of several sites under consideration by the
U. S. Bureau of Mines and the Atomic Energy Commission, said
Moss. He added, “Sufficient information is available to indicate
that such a project has a high degree of expectancy for success,
at least from a technical aspect.” '

ASGR, Newmont Take Over Granduc Mine

Granduc Mines, new British Columbia copper producer, has run
into financial difficulties in recent months. After considerable road
and tunnel building and development work, the cost of bringing the
mine into production, originally estimated at $55 million, has been
re-figured at $85 million. The American Smelting and Refining Co.
and the Newmont Mining Co. have announced arrangements to
lea.se the property, pay all costs of development, and pay a royalty
to Granduc Mines on the net proceeds from production.

Granduc, near Alaska border (see map)'was= the site of a
disastrous avalanche last Feb. 18 which killed 26 workers and in-
jured 18 more. Aside from mine site development, the Granduc
project calls for cutting an 1-1-mile tunnel and building a connecting
road to tidewater at Hyder, Alaska.

Wage Increases’

Across—the-board wage boosts
of six cents .an-hour in the first
year and seven cents an hour in
each of the other two years of
the contract were won, which
will bring the average hourly

earnings at the plant to $3.31 per ’

hour by Oct. 1, 1967.
Substantial improvements
were made in the area of health
and welfare. The weekly sick-
ness and accident benefit was
increased by $20, from $50 to

$70, and will be paid for a full

year rather than the previous 26-
weeks. Payments will be started,
on the first day after an acci-

Poisoning Hazard

The reopening of old silver-lead mines in the Rocky Mountain states due to higher prices for both

”metals has created a lead poisoning hazard, according to Duncan Holaday of the U. S. Public Health

Service in Salt Lake City. So far there have been three known cases of lead poisoning and three Others
that were borderline cases, all from New Mexico.
Holaday said lead carbonate, usually found near the surface, is the poisonous material. Lead
sulfide,‘ or galena, found in deep mines is not poisonous. Holaday said old-timers understood this but
operators today “seem to have forgotten the experience of 40 or 50 years ago.”
The cases were uncovered when blood samples from New Mexico silver miners were analyzed

for lead content. The U. S. Pub-
lic Health Service has issued
warnings to all silver mining
states recommending that sil-
ver-lead mines be given special
inspections to inform operators
of possible danger.

Ilihbard Named Head
Of Bureau of Mines

President Johnson on October
23 announced the appointment
of Dr. Walter R. Hibbard,'Jr., as
the new director of the U. S.
Bureau of Mines. Dr. Hibbard’s
appointment is a “recess” ap-
pointment, requiring Senate con-
firmation next year when ‘Con-
gress reconvenes. _

Hibbard is a metallurgist who
has headed adivision of the re-
search and development center
of General Electric at Schenec-
tady, N. Y.

The appointment of _Hibbard
fills the 10-month vacancy that
has existed since the resigna-
tion of Marling J. Ankeny on
Dec. 30, 1964. Since that time,
Frank Memmott has been act-
i'ng director of the Bureau.

“‘Mr. Memmott’s wide range
of experience in both coal and
metal mines and his dedication
to the healt.h and safety pro-
grams of the Bureau of Mines
have been invaluable in the in-
terim between directors,” said
Interior Secretary Stewart
Udall, who also stated that “Dr.
Hibbard’s outstanding experi-
ence in the development and
direction of research programs
will be a tremendous asset to
the advancement of the impor-
tant scientific work of the Eu-
reau.”

“Research is the key to the
continued progress of much of

~- the vital “effort of the Bureau of

Mines,” said Udall.
. Born in Bridgeport, Conn., Dr.
Hibbard is a graduate of Wes-
1€_yan University and received
h1S doctorate in engineering
from Yale University in 1942.

-The author of 70 scientific
papers, he is the president-elect
of the American Institute of
Mining, Metallurgical", and Pe-
troleum Engineers for 1966 and
is -chairman of the National
Academy of Science’s Materials
Advisory Board. '

During World War II, he
served as an officer with the

Bureau of Ships in the U. S. _
Navy; and, in 1957, he was a»

member of the exchange dele-
gation. of U. .S. metallurgists
visiting the Soviet Union.

1964, up from a final count of
46 in 1963. This is more than a
28 percent increase over 1963.
Work injuries in 1964 numbered
3,745, up about 71/2 percent over
1963. One-third of the deaths in
1964, 20, occurred in lead-zinc
mines and mills; copper mining
and iron mining accounted for
13 fatalities each; and all other
metals combined totaled 13.

Seven Killed in

Coal Mine Fire

A fire touched off when a con-
tinuous mining machine cut a
power cable at the Clinchfield
Coal Company’s Mars Mine near
Sardis, West Virginia, on Oct.
16 claimed the lives of seven
coal miners, who died from
smoke inhalation and _lack of
oxygen. More than 100 rescue
workers worked for 32 hours to
save the trapped men. A total
of 140,men are employed at the
mine but, fortunately,. only ten
were underground when the fire
broke out. Three who were
operating the mining machine
escaped after unsuccessfully try-
ing to put out the fire.

guilty of concealing the extent
of accidents by .not reporting
them. Under federal law, rail-
roads are required to report to
the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission all train accidents which
cause $750 or more in damage
to equipment or tracks, whether
an injury results or not. But
John W. Bush, vice-chairman of
the commission, testified at a re-
cent Senate hearing that two-
thirds of the complaints filed in
1964 charging railroads" -with
non-reporting of accidents were
found upon investigation to be
valid.

Despite the failure to report
all accidents, the Interstate
Commerce Commission has re-
ported that -train accidents
causing $750 or more in dam-
age have increased by 11.2 per-
cent since 17,000 firemen were
removed from their jobs last
year. President H. C. Gilbert
of the Brotherhood of Loco-
motive Firemen and Engine-
men contends that removal of
the firemen is the direct cause
of the increase in accidents.

Warning on Lead
In Atmosphere

A report by Dr. C. C. Patter-
son of the California Institute of
Technology indicates that lead
is contaminating the atmos-
phere in large ‘cities to a
dangerous degree. He estimates
that lead concentrations in the
air in urban areas are about 27
times the concentrations found
in rural areas.

This results in a buildup in
the lead content of the blood of
people living in large cities.
The current average content of
lead in blood for the United
States as a whole is roughly
half that at which obvious
symptoms
begin to appear. But persons in

atmospheres with heavy con-.

centrations of lead have higher
lead blood content. This is
borne out’ by a recent survey of
.200,Cincinnati garage mechanics
and parking lot attendants, who

in the blood three times as
high, on the average, as two

of lead poisoning '

V were found to have lead levels-

Price Increase Tightens}

Current Copper Squeezej,

A two-cent per pound increase
in the price of copper, posted
first by Chilean and later by
African producers, has further
tightened the copper situation.
This hike plus the, problem of
Rhodesian “independence” are
upsetting the world copper
scene. The $64 question now is
whether U. S. producers will fall
into line with a two-cent boost
in the price of domestic copper.

The price increase was kicked
off in Chile on Oct. 20 by Ana-
conda and Kennecott on an or-
der from the Chilean govern-
ment. Both companies, leading
Chilean copper producers, an-
nounced that their Chilean out-
put would henceforth be sold at
38 ‘cents a pound. The effect of
this on the U. S. consumers of
Chilean copper, with the addi-

major source of high atmos-
pheric concentrations of lead is
the use of lead in gasoline.

His views drew sharp blasts
from the American Petroleum
Institute and the Lead Indus-
tries. Association. The Institute
rejoinder said that all “accepted
medical evidence proves con-
clusively” that lead in the en-
vironment presents no threat
to public health.

Coal Fatalities

The U. S. Bureau of Mines
has reported that during the
first six months of this year
134 men were killed in U. S.
coal mines. This was 10 more
than were killed in the first
half of 1964, an increase of 8
percent. Production and man-
hours were higher in 1965, but
fatal accidents nonetheless in-
creased by two percent per mil-
lion tons of coal produced and
by four percent per million
man-hours worked.
