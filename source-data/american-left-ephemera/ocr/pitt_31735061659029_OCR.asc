The Story of the
 American Youth Congress

“We declare that our generation is rightfully en-
titled to a usejul, creative, and happy life, the
guarantees of which are: full educational opportun-
ities, steady employment at adequate wages, security
in time of need, civil rights and peace.”

American Youth

Youth Congress committees; 270 delegates from social,
cultural, and ethical groups; 14« national oﬂices of youth.
organizations; and 81 delegates from nine political parties
(Republican, Democrat, EPIC, Communist, Socialist, Farm-
er-Labor, Progressive, etc.) .

From this vast gathering came the second program of
the American Youth Congress. The larger problems facing
young people remain fundamentally unaltered: unemploy-
ment, the threat ofiwar, the danger of fascism. The pro-
gram which was adopted is an attempt to give direction to
the solutions of these youth problems.

The Detroit Congress deﬁnitely established the Ameri-
can Youth Congress as the spokesman of the younger gen-
A ,’ eration. Speciﬁc applications of the program, at such times
as the _Italian invasion of Ethiopia and President Roose-
.velt’s Baltimore appeal to youth, formulated the position
; of the majority of American youth. Of necessity, such a
ti. program is a minimum one. It offers no permanent solu-
tion; it does not attempt to point the eventual way. It seeks
merely to solve the most immediate problems, as the least
common denominator of the convictions of youth. The basis
of the Youth Congress idea is to submerge matters of dis-
agreement and unite on points of agreement, and the re-
sponsibility for application of program and leadership of
2 the movement between annual Congresses rests with the Na-
‘p tional Council and its Resident Board. 

Elected by all the Congress delegates, the National
Council includes delegates representative of national and
local organizations from coast to coast. Matters of policy

* are decided by this body, through regular meetings and
occasional referenda. The actual tasks of guiding the Con-
gress rest with the Resident Board, which is made up -of

e American Youth Ac1'—Our Maior Campaign

This account is insufficient as an explanation of the
ovement with a picture of its day to day work. First among
ese is the campaign to get the United States Congress to
ass the American Youth Act, a measure introduced into
ngress on January 14, 1936, by Representative Thomas

lilnnesota. The American Youth Act was drawn up by the
ational Council of the Youth Congress, and the campaign
‘r it is led by the Congress. When hearings were held on
":2 bill by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor
7iMarch, over a thousand young people ﬂocked to Wash-

ized youth. There were nationally known ﬁgures such
Professor Charles A. Beard, Congressman Lemke and
ncis Corman; and there were obscure, unknown young
pple by the hundreds, from schools, breadlines, vfarms
workshops.
A housands of young people in half a hundred cities and
’s‘ held meetings, demonstrations and parades on
morial Day in response to the call of the Youth Con-

for youth to commemorate the war dead by resolving
there shall be no more war. In sending out the Call to
Third American Youth Congress in Cleveland, July 3,
and 5, it can know that youth will respond with a gather-
ven greater and more significant than last year to re-
h, the movement into its third and greatest year.

Even more signiﬁcant is this strength of the Youth Co A
gress in light of the fact that the organization is not a-mem; j
bership but a federation of groups which have their own
problems and programs. The Congresshas no group of per-
sons to rely upon for unimpeded support. Young workers in
the Congress support the Declaration of Rights and the

employed organizations for concrete membership partici-
pation.

Young Christians and"Jews support the movement but
devote /their time to their church and turn ‘to its social

support the movement but turn to their own programs 0
altering the social order or building a new one for the
final resolution of society’s tremendous conﬂicts. This as
pact of the organization is best expressed in a statemen
adopted by the National Council at its meeting in Wash
ington, D. C., January 25 and 26, 1936: “The American
Youth Congress is not a membership organization, but ra
ther a federation of organizations to take united action on
issues affecting youth . . . . . .If the Youth Congress is t
grow as a force in American life and involve larger nurn \‘
bers of youth organizations in its work, it must select th V’
central issues that are of vital concern to the youth of
America and concentrate virtually all “of its energies t
push those issues.”

The central issues of the American Youth Congress as
we look forward to Cleveland on July 3, 4e and 5, will cen-[
ter in two major ﬁelds. First, we must ask ourselves: What.
does American youth face this year that is new? and second:
How can we look ‘toward bettering the Youth Congress or»

ganizational structure?

Issues Facing Us

  
 
  
  
   
    
   
   
  
    
 
  
   
    
   
 

A The new factors with regard to employment seem ob-
‘ vious. The “recovery” many of us saw immediately ahead
only so short a time as a year ago has proven illusory what
with the increase of unemployment among youth and the
decrease in general wage scales. The recovery that has been
idely -publicized has not been for youth. The President
s recognized this fact in extending the National Youth
dministration for another year. “Recovery”, if it were to
ve had any speciﬁc reference to youth, would have meant
ﬂ at the job and educational possibilities and provisions of
V "e American Youth Act would have been put into effect.

7 At the sameitime we will come together knowing that
5 'e American Youth Act with whatever changes we have
propose before its introduction again next year can be
‘ssed only if the young people weld even more strongly
ﬁed and more widespread support of it among them-
Ives and among their elders.

.Undoubtedly the American Youth Congress will con-
der how best young people can deal the most effective
ows to fascism through continued support of the boycott
the Olympics held under Nazi auspices. We will con-
er, further cooperation with groups devoted to fair play
ports. We will decide our part in the Hearst boycott, in
‘ e maintenance and extension of civil rights, and incom-
tiirg Negro discrimination. 

-- We have a responsibility to determine a war program
gnizant of increased militarization of youth and the war
euvers going on at the very moment of our Congress.

to make student military training optional rather than com-
pulsory as a step toward complete abolition of R.O.T.C.

Organizationally many new factors will enter into our-
discussions and plans. In the ﬁrst place the Youth Con- A
gress has grown at a pace rivalled only by the pace with 
which the young generation has been starved, militarized,
shelved and shut up. The National Council of Industrial
Girls and the National Council of Business and Professional
Women of the Young Women’s Christian Association have
afﬁliated to the Congress. The Abyssinian Baptist Church,
the largest Protestant Church in the world—a Negro church,
the League of Senior Clubs of the 92nd Street Y.M.H.A.,, W
the largest Y in the world, and the New England Division
of the National Student Federation of America have recent- . ’
ly joined our ranks. Hardly a day passes that new groups
do not send in their requests for charters.

To cope with this situation problems of encouraging
more volunteer and employed leadership as well as prob- '
lems of keeping more careful records will be discussed.

Whether the Congress launches a national publication
will also have a place‘ ‘for discussion.

The relationship of the Congress to the American Fed- -
eration of Labor and to the Christian Youth Council of
North America will need careful and complete analysis.
The extent to which better cooperation can be arranged 
with these groups will depend on the number of spokesmen
from them that we have among the delegates.

United for Peace. Freedom and Progress

 the coming Congress in Cleveland, more than three thou-

ality: “Peace, Freedom and Progress.” These ideals ur-
ently need reinforcement. They need, as one writer has
jointed out, many friends to insure their realization in a
orld so fraught with disorder. The Youth Congress, in

oph-making, involving thousands who have remained aloof

AMERICAN YOUTH ACTS

NE bit of advice animated several generations which

have gone before. It expressed hope and promise and
fulﬁllment. It reﬂected an era in which progress dominated
the American scene. That bit of advice, ﬁrst given by a
journalist, echoed by his contemporaries and reiterated by
historians, was “Go West Young Man.”

No other statement more clearly embodies the oppor-
tunity which the United States, for many decades, offered
to young people setting out in quest of work and security.
If avenues of employment were cut off in their immediate
surroundings, if passing epressions threatened their fu-
tures, they could head oil" for the West to open up new
parts for fruitful exploration. Legends and romanticism
surrounded the frontier, but its essential, irresistible fact
was real opportunity.

No longer can we search for the same kind of new
frontiers——the same kind of progress. In an hour of grave
crisis “recovery” signiﬁes a permanent army of unemployed

' youth. “Revival” implies only minor readjustments without

real opportunity for millions. There is no new trail to be
followed_into distant areas. Dismayed by the agonized
crumbling of our traditional economic forms, present day
‘super-patriots are less genial and constructive in their ad-
vice to youth. They have invented a new command. It ex-
presses despair and frustration. To those who plead for
jobs, who vow solemnly to maintain their right to live, the
answer is being given: “Go back where you came from.”

A Hand-to-Mouth Existence

To the extent that this command daunts the organiza-
tional efforts of modern youth and they allow the steady
recession that has already set in to continue, will the fatal
forecast of Mr. Aubrey Williams, Executive Director of
the National Youth Administration, become reality. He pre-
dicted, “We know that a vast overwhelming majority of
the children born in the last twenty-ﬁve years will never
rise above a hand-to-mouth existence; that all their steps
from the cradle to the grave will be dogged by poverty,
sickness, and insecurity.” Youth’s responsibility and mis-
sion is clear——.organizationally and programmatically.

The real live problems of American youth are obvious to
every citizen through his acquaintances in his own com-
munity. Too often he allows himself to believe that what
he sees and knows of young people in his family or block A
is unique. However, these National Youth Administration
ﬁgures, as given by Aubrey Williams, are eye-openers:

 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 

“It is estimated that from live to eight million young
people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-ﬁve are
wholly unoccupied. They are neither working nor at-
tending school. Almost three million young people are 5
on relief. Seven hundred thousand young people had
to quit school last year before they had ﬁnished high

7 school. And last June hundreds of thousands of them
graduated from school and college into a labor market
that was greatly surfeited. It is a cold and unwelcom-
ing world that our young people are entering. . . .”

“Recent estimates show that even though there has V
been a pick-up in business, it is absorbing only a few, 
of the unemployed. That mfans that the chances of get- — K p

ting young people into private industry are becoming
smaller, not greater.”

This is a government oﬁ‘icial’s mild recognition of the
inability of private industry to employ the unemployed.
Proof of the permanency of this situation lies in the state-
ments of President Roosevelt, of Mr. Aubrey Williams, as
well as in the steadily rising curve of unemployment since

1919, a curve not even interrupted by the “prosperity”
of 1929.

Educational Opportunities Restricted

Free public education through high school is an ideal
far from achieved in our country and the tendency is to
restrict educational opportunity rather than expand it. Only
15 per cent of our population has a secondary school edu-
cation, and at present only 63 per cent of the young people
of high school age are in high school. In many sections the

"situation is more serious. In Arkansas and Mississippi, for
‘ instance, fewer than ﬁve per cent of the Negroes of high

school age, and in farm areas less than 40 per cent of the
young people of high school age are enjoying the educa-
tional opportunities held as minimum essentials by the

‘people for a whole century. Free public education through

high school is still a‘goal to be achieved in the face of

modern educational retrenchmcnts.

Young America, doomed with the fate of permanent

lllunemployment ii it awaits the call of private industry, un-
._ willing to be used as a bludgeon to beat down trade union

wages, ﬁnding free public education through high school

adequately, and acted as a threat to the general wage scales.=_

No “out” has been proposed in Washington.

A Spokesman of the Younger Generation

And now young ‘people, through the federation they have;
P built———The American Youth Congress—are recognizing
their own power in society. This power does not setiyouthii

up as a separate social force, but recognizes youth’s distinct

problems and builds democratically to meet them. In a

little less than two years the American Youth Congress
movement has become so potent that it can enlist behind

its major campaign four million or more young people.

Government oiﬁcials are given pause by it; conservative

daily papers refer to it as the spokesman of the younger

generation, and politicians attempt maneuvers to use it in
the coming elections.

Under the simple slogan “Peace, Freedom, and Pro-
gress”g, the American Youth Congress hasbanded millions

of young people together today. As it ‘is on the verge of A
entering its third year and a new accounting of the factsv

concerning it is due, it can justly be credited with having
profoundly affected the attitude of our generation. Yet it
wasiinitiated at the behest of no one group. A’ A

V As far as American young people were concerned, the
- formation of the American Youth Congress was an historical
accident of great importance. In the spring of 1934, Miss
fViola Ilma of New York City, struck upon the idea of
drawing youth together, of building a youth movement
écompletely representative of the entire generation. By per-

youth, ranging from the Boy Scouts to the Young Com-
munist League, caring nothing about their being demo-
iciﬁatically elected as delegates, to a congress held in the
summer of that year. The idea wasn’t hers alone; she had
shortly returned from a trip, ﬁnanced through unknown
sources, to Nazi Germany, and she was admittedly im-
pressed and stimulated by the Hitler youth movement. At
the Congress her motives became clear. She was to be chair-
man, regardless of what the delegates might want; she and
persons appointed by her»were to draw up the resolutions
in which no discussion from the floor was to be permitted;
"er and the same people from her Central Bureau for
oung America were to make up the continuations body;

Democracy ls Victorious

 But those three days of the Congress—August 15, 16,
d 17, didn’t go as she had planned. The majority of dele-
ates, though they had not come as democratically elected
 resentatives from their organizations, nevertheless were
ive to the desires of their constituencies to cast off the
_ upor and despair of the depression and get together to
Seek a way out. Miss Ilma’s plans did not recognize the
rrentcproblems of such young people. Miss Ilma had not
, nsidered the desire of American youth to have some-
thing; to say about its own program. Miss Ilma was forced
. e 7 C

the American Youth Congress was born out of a victoriou
tussle with tyranny. s  Y

The delegates, driven by the despair of the past years
and by the still vague vision of the strength and glories
to be attained through unity, rose to the occasion. Out of
that Congress these representatives of 79 organizations with
a combined membership of about 1,700,000 youth in 16
states came with a new sense of triumph and hope for the
future based upon the discovery that there were common
solutions to their common problems, that it was possible
to unite around a minimum program and go out to rally;
other youth groups to that program.

A Common Program of Vigorous Action

V The goals they set for themselves two years ago have
remained basically unchanged: To have youth decide for
itself "what its major joint problems are; through discus
sion and consultation to draw up a programof action look
ing toward the solution of those problems; to carry thi
program into action and bring itvconstantly to new circle
of youth; and to weld strong unity for action among youth
No one idea is wanted or allowed to dominate, nor on
group to control——else the Youth Congress is defeated. Th
signiﬁcance and basic value of thermovement lies in thy
fact that it is an instrument for youth to use as it requires
according to majority decisions, not static but changing an
often as needed or wanted. _ j
The keynote of the ﬁrst program lay in the words: “W
want a youth movement that shall consider its mission t
be to wipe war from the face of the earth, to destroy fascism
to work for concrete and immsediate economic measures a

  
 
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
 
    
    
  
  
   
  
  

set’ forth in our program, and with the goal of a cooperative’ .
world without oppression of man by man....With this
goal, around a common program of vigorous action, we
all upon the youth of America to rally.”

Around this program the Youth Congress movement
ook shape. Regional congresses sprang up from coast to
coast, becoming part of the national movement and shap-
ng their programs in whole or part upon it. The move-
ment which began among national leaders of wide-spread
organizations was brought down to community groups and
focal leadership. Even today it has not been sufficiently
carried ‘to. memberships; but without doubt the Youth,
Congress at the end of its first year was vastly more repre-
sentative of the younger generation and more the property
of youth. 0

Movement Expands

And of course by the end of that period, deﬁnite changes
;n the movement had taken place. They were brought out
?y the Second American Youth Congress, held in Detroit,

uly 4- to 7, 1935. The expansion of the movement among
the younger generation was shown by the fact that 1,205 
elegates gathered from 853 organizations with a combined 0 '
-a embership of 1,350,000 in 27 states. In addition there
were 86 fraternal delegates and several hundred observers.
those present 53 per cent were under 21 years of ago
only nine per cent were over 25. Their representation
_ as follows: 195 delegates from 157 trade unions; 69 ,

,Iﬁ‘ settlement houses and youth centers}; 49 churches were

‘e-presented; 5 A. F. of L. central labor bodies, 171 stu-
its from 40 student groups; 95 peace organizations;'
