Realistic solutions

The solutions and remedies I have pre-
sented are realistic, necessary and possible.
However, these solutions will not materialize
without mass pressure and mass struggles.

And this is no time for the union leaders
to sit in wann-cushioned chairs and play
tootsie with the corporations. This is a time
when union leaders and members must raise
hell all over the place. There is no other
way.

Black-white unity is key

The key to mass struggles is working class
unity. And the main ingredient of steelwork-
ers’ unity has always been the unity of Bl-ack
and white workers. This question has now
emerged as an integral part of the present
crisis in steel because steelworkers cannot
win without unity.

And there can be no solid unity without
a struggle against racism—racism that the
steel corporations have fostered and prac-
ticed for over a hundred years.

The bottom line in the struggle against
racism in the steel industry is the struggle
for economic parity for Black, Puerto Rican
and Chicano workers with their white class
brothers.

Therefore, there is a need for an affirma-
tive action plan in the steel industry, a plan
that will eliminate the unequal status of
Black steelworkers through adjustments in
hiring, upgrading and layoffs.

There is a solid basis for unity in the
struggle to raise the economic status of the
40% of Black Amenic-ans and the 16% of
white Americans who are now forced to live
below the ofﬁcial government established
poverty level.

Progress through struggle
In his better days, Ernest Hemingway
once wrote: The world is a ﬁne place and
worth ﬁghting for.” Yes it is a ﬁne place.
But -it is also true that without struggle, and

if t-he corporations can continue to have,

their way, it can be a nightmare.

Through struggle it is pos-sib-le to win re-
forms. But the- long-range truth is that no
matter how many short-range victories and
remedies are won and put into effect, the
basic pattern, the source of the problems,
will remain.

As long as private corporations have con-
trol over industries such as steel, there will
be crises and disasters for the working peo-
pie.

The way out

The only way to put an end to the crises
and disasters is for the people to take over
the industries, the banks and the Govern-
ment.‘ Only then it is possible to put an end
to the evils and the insatiable greed for
private proﬁts, and proceed to set up an eco-
nomic system that will operate the mines,
mills and banks solely for the beneﬁt of
the people.

One-third of the world’s people are do-
ing just that. S-ocia-lism has become the wave
of the future.

The steelworkers in the socialist countries
not only do not face disasters because of
layoffs; -their Bill of Rights guarantees each
worker a job-—a job at his or her highest
skill. In the socialist countries there are no
high-paid executives, no corporate coupon
clippers. The steelworkers own and operate
the steel mills. They are the sole stock-
holders. ‘

 

10

It is obvious that when people them-
selves run the industries, they are concerned
about people. No one in the executive suites
of the Lykes Corporation knows or cares
about the laid-otf Campbell workers. All
they care about is their proﬁts.

For them, the closing of the Campbell
Works is nothing more than a $20 million
corporate tax write-oil. When left to them-
selves the conporate executives will never
care about people.

But there is a way to make them take
notice. There is a way to force concessions
from them. And it is the only way. That
way is militant, mass struggles.

Having gotten rid of tens of thousands of
workers, and ruined whole communities by
closing down mills, and after getting the

Carter package $1 billion Xmas gift, the
steel monopolies are now preparing for a

jump in activity and a hike in corporate _

proﬁts in 1978. Prices will be increased.
The production lines will be speeded up.
This will continue until the next crisis.

To the bigger steel corporations the crisis
that is a disaster in Mahoning Valley, Beth-
lehem and Buffalo, is a bonanza.

If my visit here has helped to stir things
up, and if my being here has raised some
fears in Washington and in the corporate
otlices-—a fear that if they do not respond
the steelworkers just may join the Commu-
nist Party and opt for socialism——then I an
happy to have made that contribution.

MAY THE NEW YEAR BE A HAP-
PIER ONE FOR ALL OF YOU!

A people’s solution to the steel crisis

1. Emergency federal funds to guarantee full wages and beneﬁts -to all laid
off steelworkers until their jobs are restored. '
2. Federal takeover of all shut ‘down steel plants, with guarantees that work-

ers and the communities have decisive say over management. .

3. Complete, speciﬁc aﬂirmative action programs against discrimination. End
all racist hiring, and promotion practices. » _

4. Federal investigation and action to end special harassment and discipline
against minority and female steelworkers.

5. Create more jobs in steel:

A. A 30 hour work week with 40 hours pay; no forced overtime.

B. Slash the military budget to release funds to‘ pay for constructive
peacetime use of steel, such as: Federally -ﬁnanced housing program
for 3 million quality, low-rent units each year; build or re-build mass
-transit; modernize railoads and bridges; build educational, health and
recreational facilities, especially in the inner cities, and in rural areas
where needed. ‘ . _ "

6. Protect existing» jobs by a federal law prohibiting further layoffs. Rejec

any demands from the steel corporations for wage cuts. *

7. Strict control over steel prices -to guarantee demand and prevent corporate
_ ‘gouging’ of federal purchases. a p
8. Open new markets for steel. Repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment. End
all trade restrictions against the socialist and developing countries.
9. Unite , steelworkers world-wide through greater international trade union
cooperation; re-aﬂiliation of the AFL-CIO with world trade union bodies. »
10. Force U.S. steel corporations to invest more at home by prohibiting their
investment in low wage, repressive countries such as South Africa and
Chile.

Coming to Youngstown is coming back
home. But this time, because of the closing
of steel plants and the laying off of steel-
workers it feels like coming back to visit
and to help an old friend that is ailing.

But let me say—Mahoning Valley, like
Buffalo, Bethlehem and other steel centers
are not terminally ill. There are effective
remedies. The ailments can be cured:

For the 60,000 permanently laid off steel-
workers and the one-quarter million mem-
bers of their families, for the construction
workers, service industries workers and for
the small business people in these steel com-
munities life has turned into a disaster, a
nightmare. For those who are able to collect
unemployment beneﬁts, or still have some
savings, the full impact of this disaster is
like waiting for a ﬂood to crest before relief
arrives.

Like all crises, these tragic developments
in the steel industry are a moment of truth
for all institutions and organizations.

This crisis again puts the spotlight on the
bestial, anti-human and brutally criminal
nature of the proﬁt-hungry steel corporations.
It also exposes the subservient, captive and
lying nature of the mass media, especially
the press. It exposes the so-called “elected
representatives” of the people in government
and who sit in silence or make assinine ex-
cuses for the reckless actions of the steel
companies. And it puts a beam on the bank-
ruptcy of apple-polishing trade union leaders,
who are caught with their class collabora-
tionist pants down. Strictly on"merit—instead
of $90,000 salaries—-the George Meany’s
and the McBride’s should be given the pink
slip.

Beat The Steel Crisis -- Save Every Job

by GUS HALL

I landed in Mahoning Valley in the middle
of another disaster, the economic crisis of
the 1930's. Life then was raw and brutal.
Hungry families were evicted from their
homes. There were soup lines. Death from
so-called “natural causes,” of people weak-
ened by hunger, increased dramatically. There
were no unemployment checks, relief checks
or old-age pensions. And there were no wel-
fare systems people could turn to for emer-
gency relief.

But, in spite of the hunger and misery,
there was hope because there was a ﬁghtback.

Militant fightback

There were strikes. And not a week passed
in Youngstown without some kind of mass
demonstrations, petitions, hunger marches.
And for some of us the county jail became a
second home. It was a common sight to see
the marshalls coming to evict families from
their homes; the neighbors getting together,
taking the furniture off the street and putting
it back into the house.

Because the militant ﬁghtback the federal
government was forced to take emergency
measures and appropriate money for pro-
grams like WPA, PWA, etc. Because of the
ﬁghtback movements, with all their weak-
nesses, we now have unemployment beneﬁts,
Social Security and welfare systems.

When the economic crisis of the 30s was
over, aside from some of the skilled workers
in the hot rolling mills, most steel workers
were still unorganized and did not have the
protection of trade unions.

In those days, if workers even whispered
complaints about low wages and working
conditions, or the need for unions, they were
ﬁred without recourse or appeal.

I was ﬁred by both Youngstown Sheet
and Tube and Republic for union activities.

Each steel corporation was a power unto
itself. Besides the FBI and the city and
county police departments, each corporation
maintained its owned armed police force,
its own secret stoolpigeons and an industry-
wide blacklist.

But again, there was hope. The workers

saw a glimmer of light at the end of the
tunnel because there was a rising mood of
determined struggle and ﬁghtback. Against
all obstacles the steel unions slowly took
root—ﬁrst as a secret, underground force,
later as open, ﬁghting, United Steel Workers
locals.

As you who are older will recall, Tom
Girdler, then President of Republic Steel,
avowed publicly that he “would rather quit
as president and pick apples” on his farm
“than sign a union contract.” Of course six
months later he was forced to sign that
contract.

The lessons are obvious. Without struggle,
without unity and organization, millions
would have died of starvation during the
the depression. Without organization and
united struggles, steelworkers would still be
working 10-12 hours a day for 30-40¢ an
hour. In fact, without struggle, there would
be a system of slaves and slavemasters, or
we would still be a British colony.

Unity in mass struggles are the only
weapons the people have. As history is a
witness, people have a choice—-either remain
on their knees begging for crumbs, or stand-
ing up and ﬁghting for what is rightfully
theirs.

New crisis

Now the steelworkers face a new crisis, a
new disaster.

And who can today seriously challenge
the fact that without struggle, without organ-
ization and unity, that cities like Campbell,
Struthers and Youngstown will go down the
drain—down the polluted Mahoning River.

Today it is the Campbell Works and
tomorrow, when U.S. Steel completes its new
mill in the Astabula-Canneut area, it will be
the Ohio Works and McDonald. Without"
struggle the Mahoning Valley, and many
other valleys, will become ghost valleys.

The question is: What and who is destroy-
ing this once busy, green valley? Why is
there a crisis in the steel industry?

As usual, the captive mass media and the
steel corporations, in a conspiracy to hood-
wink the people, are deliberately pointing the
accusing ﬁnger in the wrong direction. They
are lying through their teeth.

It it is a calculated, dirty falsehood when
they claim that the cause of the crisis is high
wages, steel imports, high taxes and too-strict

I937 Pickefs

pollution controls.

Imports not the cause

The basic source of the crisis is not in the
Ruhr Valley in West Germany, or the steel
valleys of Japan. The real cause of the crisis
lies in the bloated valleys of Wall Street, in
the executive suites of the steel corporations
and the “peanut” administration in Wash-
ington. The steel imports are, in reality, a
very small factor, and therefore it is a cruel
hoax to say that restrictions against imports
are going to reopen the Campbell Works.

Six years ago, in 1967, 18% of all steel
supplies in the U.S. came from foreign im-
ports. In 1976, -the total was $l4.1%. And
the 1977 ﬁgures are going to be even lower.
In other words, the percentage of imports
declined in the six-year period. And the fact
is that these imports are more than balanced
off by the steel and steel products the U.S.
ships overseas.

So the killer is not foreign imports. But
they are being used as a good gimmick——-
because if the steel corporations can con-
vince the steelworkers that imports are the
culprit they will not look closer to home
base and ﬁght for real solutions.

Proﬁts doubled
However, it is true that U.S.-made steel
is not as competitive as it used to be. But
the main reason for this is not the wages

 

 

 

of U.S. steelworkers, but because the steel
corporations in Japan and Western Europe
are ready to accept a proﬁt margin of 8%%
while the U.S. corporations, in their bound-
less greed, skim oil 12-18% in proﬁts. In
the last 10 years the U.S. steel corporations
have more than doubled their proﬁts, and
their executives’ salaries.

It is an unmitigated, bold-faced lie that
the cause of the p-roblem is that the steel-
workers’ wages are too high.

The hard facts are that 10 years ago, in
1967, steelworkers’ wages accounted for
$16.00 of every $100 worth of steel shipped.
Last year, wages accounted for only $12.00
of every $100 worth of steel. In other words,
the corporations are getting a bigger share,
and the steelworkers are getting a declining
piece of the total steel pie. And, in the same
period, (1967-77), the steel corporations
increased the prices of steel by 150%.

Ask any steelworker’s family how much
they have managed to save—how rich are
they after the 25 percent tax bite, escalating
rents, the rising mortgage payments, interest
rates, utility bills and the inﬂated cost of
food and clothing.

Ask any steelworker whether they should
voluntarily take a wage cut because they are
too well off, too aﬂluent. The steelworkers’
wages are not the cause, and therefore cut-
ting wages is not the solution to the crisis.

And look who’s complaining about the
high wages of steelworkers!

Successful pirates

The Lykes Corporation is a bank presi-
den-t’s dream. The 18 directors and olﬁcers
of Lykes and Youngstown Sheet and Tube
admit to a take-home pay of $1 million,
300 thousand dollars last year. They are the
most successful pirates in all of history. A
Mr. Cleary, a vice president of both corpora-
tions, has an annual salary of $130,000, plus
$90,000 a year in retirement'beneﬁts,- plus
the coupons he clips from 3,000 shares of
stock.

Joseph T. Lykes gets $135,000 a year
in salary, $100,000 in annual retirement
beneﬁts, and the coupons on 380,000 shares
of stock.

Randolph Rieder another vice president
of Youngstown Sheet and Tube, gets
$155,000 per year, and $45,000 in yearly

 

retirement beneﬁts.

After all this legal robbery, the parent
company of Youngstown Sheet and Tube,
admitted it made a proﬁt of $20 million last
year.

These leeches, who's productivity is zero,
have the brazeness to speak about steel-
workers’ productivity! The gall of these de-
generate embezzlers—to complain about
workers’ wages! And these same corporate
pirates have now forced the coal miners in
the mines they own to go on strike.

These corporate vultures have the audacity
to complain about taxes. They are the big-
gest tax swindlers in all of history. Last year
the U.S. steel corporations’ tax swindle was
over $273 million which they should have
paid. For closing the Campbell Works, the
Lykes Corporation has ﬁled a $138 million
loss, and for a $20 million tax credit.

This is proof positive that crime does pay
—but only if the crimes are committed by
the big corporations.

A complete fraud

It is also a complete fraud and a false-
hood that one of the reasons for the present
steel crisis is because workers in Japan and
Western Europe work harder and are more
productive than U.S. steelworkers. The hard
fact is that there are no steelworkers in the
world who are as exploited as are the U.S.
steelworkers. In fact, that is one of the
problems. Less and less steelworkers are
producing more and more steel. There are
100,000 fewer steelworkers today producing
much more steel than 10 years ago. Last
year U.S. steelworkers produced as much
steel in 301/2 hours as they did in 40 hours
in 1967. That is a 25% leap in productivity.

The critical question

Now, the critical question is: Are there
solutions to this crisis?

Without any question there are both im-
mediate and long-range remedies. But you can
bet that the steel corporations are not going
to like our solutions. They did not like our
solutions to the economic depression, or the
drive to organize steelworkers. They do not
like our solutions because i-t is an unavoid-
able fact that any real solution is going to
demand changes in priorities. Any real solu-
tion is going to affect the corporate sacred
cow—-namely, their proﬁts.

 

The Carter "packages"

The Carter Administrationhas also come
up with a so-called solution. President Carter
has been so long in the business of selling
peanuts that everything from Washington now
comes in the form of “packages.” There are
“tax packages” and “energy packages.” It is
easier to hide things in packages. So now

there is a Carter “steel crisis package.”

The Carter package is based on the overall
concept——give the steel corporations anything
they ask for, and if by chance some few
nickels trickle down to steelworkers they will
not object. There is nothing of substance in
the Carter package for the steel workers. But
when you add up all of the rebates, invest-
ment inducements, gifts and credits given to
the corporations, they amount to a $1 billion
Christmas present to the steel monopolies.

So, it is $1 billion for the steel corpora-
tions and “peanuts” for the steel workers.

The steel corporations have doubled their
proﬁts in the last 5 years and their executives
get $200,000-300,000 salaries. But whatever
plans for modernization of the mills they
plan to undertake under the Carter package
it will be paid for by increased taxes on
the people. The restrictions on foreign im-
ports in the Carter package will give a free
hand to the U.S. steel corporations to raise
the price of stee1—further adding to the pres-
sures of inﬂation. They are now planning on
another 10% price increase.

So the Carter package is no solution. It
is a hoax on the steelworkers and the people.

Some real solutions

Now, what are some real solutions and
remedies?

The real solution must start with an im-
media-te—-right-to-live, emergency appropria-
tion by the U.S. Congress that will provide a
decent standard of living for every laid-oﬁ
steelworker, for the duration of the crisis.

There must be a demand that the Ohio
Senators and Congressmen get oti their fat
behinds and, for once, ﬁght for the interests
of the people.

It is high time for Senator John Glenn to
get out of the corporate orbit and for once
in his career blast-otf in the interest oi the
steelworkers.

Such an emergency appropriation is ab-
solutely necessary for steelworkers. And the
fact is that it would cost less than the cost
over-runs ‘of corporations doing business
with the Federal Government. It would cost
less than the interest the bankers get on the
nation-al govern-ment debt, and less than what
the _U.S. Government spends to bolster the
military, racist, fascist dictatorships in
countries like Chile and South Africa.

Such an emergency appropriation must
be based on the , concept that for society
there should be only one priority——the most
basic of all human rights-—the right to live.

When Congress reconvenes in January '78
this should be the #1 order of business.

A great need for steel

Now the question is: Is there a potential
domestic market for steel?

Yes——and the potential is bigger than
ever. A few examples will be proof enough:

The Federal Transportation Department
reported just this week that out of some
750,000 steel bridges in the country, 110,
000 are collapsing, and in need of replace-
ment. One-half of the bridges in Pittsburgh
are now limited to 3,000 pounds. They re-
port that a steel bridge collapses every other
day in the U.S.

A program of rebuilding and replacing
these bridges would keep the Campbell
Works in operation full-time.

In the big cities, water main breaks in
the water systems take place every other
day. Most of the water mains are over 50
years old.

It is estimated that New York City alone
needs $2 billion worth of steel pipe to re-
place a 100-year old system. This could keep
the pipe mills running year-round.

The cities badly need transit systems. The
building of such systems would keep the
Ohio Works, and my old stamping ground
Briar Hill Plant, going at full-steam.

Housing crisis

There is a housing crisis in the U.S. There
is a crying need to tear down and replace
the slums with modern, liveable apartment
complexes. This would create a large mar-
ket for structural steel, and steel that goes
into the manufacturing of pipes, stoves, re-
frigerators, etc.

This by itself could easily add an addi-
tional 60,000 jobs in steel. So when you
add to this the steel that goes into the manu-
facture of autos and badly needed railroad
tracks, it is obvious there is a potential do-
mestic market for steel.

What is the obstacle?

The obstacle is priorities. The top priority
of the Carter Administration is the $130
billion dollar, totally wasteful military
budget, and the doubling of corporate proﬁts
every 5 years. Therein lies he problem.

»Dollar for dollar, the military budget-
the production of weapons, arms, missiles,
etc.————results in the least number of jobs
and uses very ‘little steel. Something like

2-3% of the steel produced in the U.S.A. is
used in the production of arms.

The military takes $130 billion, when only
$25 billion of that would be required to
replace all the 110,000 rickety steel bridges.

Besides, the military budget is promoted
by a campaign of ﬂ-agrant falsehoods and
fakery. For 60 years the Pentagon has de-
manded bigger and bigger budgets behind
the cry that, “The Russians are coming.”
Well, the Russians have not come, and they
are not going to come. It is a fraud.

So the simple transfer of 50% of the
Pentagon budget, and a cut in the enormous
corporate proﬁts would open up the domes-
tic market for steel.‘ A cut in corporate prof-
its would make steel more competitive. But
again, this means a change in priorities—
from the dead end, war-oriented economy
to a peace-oriented economy.

What about the foreign market?

Again, there is a great potential market
for steel and steel products.

The facts are that while the older capital-
ist countries like Great Britain, France, West
Germany and Spain suﬁer from a chronic
crisis of stagnation and therefore do not
prov-ide a potential market for steel, the so-
cialist countries and most of the “Third
World” countries -are in a long-term historic
period of growth and construction. They are
in a period of an economic boom. They
want to buy steel and steel products.

So again-, what is the obstacle?

The hangup is the U.S. foreign policy. A
policy of aggression has become counter-
productive for the U.S.

For example, the people of Angola are
now entering a historic period of construc-
tion and industrialization. But they cannot
forget that U.S. imperialism was the main
supporter of t-he colonialist, r-acist oppressors
of the people of Angola. How can Angola
(or, for. that matter, other countries like An-
gola), think about buying U.S. steel or steel
products when the Carter Administration. to
this very day refuses to give up its policies
of aggression and will not establish diplo-
matic recognition‘ of Angola, while it con-
tinues to give support to the main enemy
of all national l-iberation movements—the
fascist, racist regime of South Africa. This is
the obstacle to trade with the “Third World”

 

countries.

The socialist countries are a huge poten-
tial market. But again, there is an obstacle.

The amendment to the trade bill by Sena-
tor Jackson of Washington and Congress-
man Vanik of Ohio, places a spec-ial, dis-
criminatory tariff on imports from most of
the socialist countries. And the amendment
by Senator Stevenson of Illinois actually cuts
oil ordinary business credits to the socialist
countries th-at are used by all countries who
import and export.

These discriminatory amendments have no
other effects except to wipe out 60,000 jobs
of U.S. workers.

The simple removal of these special, dis-
criminatory amendments would open the
markets in the socialist countries to U.S.
steel and steel products. There is an ac-
cepted rule of thumb-—every $1 b-illon of
exports creates 60,000 jobs for one year.

So it is clear, a change in priorities, and
a change in a foreign policy that cuts off the
United States’ nose to spite its face, would
open up both domestic and foreign markets
for U.S. steel and steel products._

The military-industrial complex is against
these measures because they would then not
be able to play around with $130 billion
budgets. But, for the Steelworkers, for the
people and for the steel communities, these
measures are becoming historic necessities.

The shorter workday

A 6-hour day, without overtime or cuts in
take-home pay in the steel industry, would
create approximately 100,000 new jobs.
That by itself would be more than enough
to put every recently laid-otf steelworker
back on the job.

Steelworkers banished

In the‘ past year, the steel corporations
have condemned and banished 65,000 steel-
workers’ families to a life of pain, insecurity
and wﬁering. By any yardstick of human
rights, this is a crime. These criminal ac-
tions should be proof enough that the-se cor-
porations cannot be permitted to continue
to dominate, and be in charge of such an
important and vital aspect of 1ife——one that
in so many ways directly -affects the lives of
a majority of the people.

There are no crises for the big stockhold-
ers of steel corporations. Five years ago the
s-tocks of the 8 largest steel corporations
averaged $12.30 per share; last year the
shares averaged $23.40. And, no one buys
s-hares without expecting big dividends.

How can the steel plants be left in the
hands of people who pick up a phone and
cut the lifeline of a quarter-million people
without a thought, compassion or concern?

Nationalize industries
There is an effective remedy and in a

 

 

 

C

sense it would be just punishment for the
crimes of the steel corporations. The time
has come when in the U.S. we are forced
to consider the nationalization of a number
of industries. We simply are not going to be
able to solve the serious problems of energy,
steel, coal, housing, mass transit and the
pharmaceutical industry without nationaliza-
tion.

Why not relieve the Lykes Corporation of
all the Youngstown Sheet and Tube plants
by nationalization?

Nationalization means that these industries
would be taken out of the system of cor-
porate proﬁts, and would then be demo-
cratically operated and controlled as public
properties by elected representatives of the
workers and the public, and run for the
beneﬁt of all the people. Such industries
would t-hen dispense with the private proﬁts
and corporate executive salaries.

Many pitfalls

It is unrealistic and illusory to think this
can be done by some committee passing
the hat and collecting $50 mill-i-on to buy
the Campbell Works. This becomes a diver-
sion. Such dreams turn into nightmares.
Many of the people who are pushing this
idea are well-meaning, but not very realistic.

The Federal Government has a special
fund for small pl-ant takeovers. It is called
ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan).
It could be better known as “Aesop’s
Fables,” because there are a number of pit-
falls.

First, the total ESOP fund is less than $60
million. Secondly, such takeovers are a trap,
because the Federal Government insists that
the corporations and the old management
hold onto key positions.

Senator Long, the open corporate stooge,
said of ESOP, “It is better than Geritol—it
will increase prod-uctiv-ity, it will save this
(capitalist) economic system.”

The Youngs-town VINDICATOR, the old-
est corporate stooge, rushed in with its anti-
la-bor editorial:

“Productive changes in work rules will

require oﬂicials of the United Steelworkers

Uni-on to take a new look at their ad-

versary relationship with steel manage-

ment. Realistic concessions may well be

-the order of the day. . . .”

There is only one concession that must
result from plant takeover—the elimination
of corporate proﬁts.

In the ESOP takeovers the workers be-
come patsies. And the concept of paying the
corporations for the closed industrial plants
is itself a fraud. Why not give the Lykes
Corporation a dollar bill? The Youngstown
Sheet and Tube Company is closing the
Campbell Works, laying off 6,000 steelwork-
ers, and the Federal Government is paying
a bounty to the corporation in the form of
a $20 million tax write-off. Therefore, the
takeovers must take place through and by
way of the Federal Government. But after
the takeover the workers and the people’s
representatives must then be permitted to
operate these plants.

The argument that workers and people’s
representatives are not capable of running
such facilities is sheer nonsense. After all,
who runs the plants now if not the workers?
Most of the present stockholders of Youngs-
town Sheet and Tube ‘and Lykes don’t know
a rolling mill from a gin mill.

Like vultures waiting for the kill, there
are “fast buck” con men also getting into
the act. The people of Mahoning valley bet-
ter be on guard against swindle.

The talk of reopening the Campbell
Works under new corporate management is
accompanied by a barrage of propaganda
about a cut in wages, deferment of wage
increases, about speed-up of production,
about deferment of pollution controls.

There are powerful corporate forces who
would like to see a pilot plant—without a
union, with lower wages. They see this as a
wedge, a way of destroying the effectiveness
of the steelworkers union in all of the plants.
