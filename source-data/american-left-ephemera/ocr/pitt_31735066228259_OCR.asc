to the owners of wealth for use in production in order that the
worker may make a living. This class division into capitalists hold-
ing or controlling all the wealth, and workers owning nothing but
their labor power which they are compelled to sell for a livelihood,
is to be found in every phase of capitalist society; modern capital-
ism, however, is characterized, not only by this division, but by a
staggering concentration of wealth. It is the corporation that now
owns and operates industries in the U. S. A. The small owner, the
individual manufacturer, is the exception, and even he is controlled
by the big corporation. The rule is the large corporation. Eighty-
three per cent of the total capital investment in the U. S. A. in 1928
was in the hands of the utility, manufacturing and ﬁnance corpora-
tions. From 1922 to 1928 inclusive, the stockholders in American

7.3 billions in stock dividends. This is sufﬁcient proof that your
employer is no more a free individual acting on his own accord;

actual control of the business of the U. S. A.

VVhat is the result?

You are working for a boss. You are his “hands”. He uses you
to make proﬁt. How is this proﬁt possible at all? Because he
makes you work more than is necessary to defray your wages. In
other words, when you work you are not only reproducing the value
of your own upkeep but you are also producing surplus value which
goes to the employer who owns the means of production. The
longer the working day, the more surplus value you produce working
with the same speed. The quicker the pace of your work, the more
surplus value you produce within a given time.

The capitalist will sell the produced commodity in the market.

He will sell it at the price ﬁxed, not by himself individually, but
by the corporation of which he is a part. If he can produce more
cheaply than his neighbor, his proﬁts will be larger. This is why
he drives you on to work faster and faster. This is why he intro-
duces labor saving machinery which results in what they call
“technological unemployment”, which is another name for throwing
out workers displaced by a machine. This is why he uses’ efficiency
engineers and experts of every kind. He calls it industrial progress,
but he doesn’t think of progress at all. He thinks of proﬁts. Every
other manufacturer thinks of proﬁts. Every other manufacturer
speeds his workers ever faster and introduces newer and better
machines. The result is that ever greater numbers of workers are
being displaced, while the production capacity of the manufacturing
establishments is enormously increased.
And here we have arrived at the source of the madness called
capitalism. The numbers of actually employed workers grow
smaller. The production capacity of the factories and plants grows

bigger. The wages of the workers are being cut in order that the
employers may get bigger proﬁts, but together with this the pur-
chasing power of the population decreases. Mass production goes
on at breakneck speed, while the market shrinks. It seems incon-
ceivable that anything like this should be carried on by reasonable
human beings, yet this is actually what was happening between 1922
and 1929. Even at the very height of industrial “prosperity” this
vicious discrepancy was noticed by sober observers. There was
over-expansion of plant with no corresponding expansion of the
home market due to the greater exploitation and impoverishment
of large masses of workers and farmers. American automobile
companies had a capacity of 7.7 millions per year; production was
only 4.5 millions. The steel industry had a capacity of 65 million
tons of ingots and castings; it produced only 56.4 million tons in
1929. Oil reﬁneries were running at about three-fourths of their
productive capacity. The bituminous coal mines had a capacity of
750 million tons but they produced in 1929 only 535 million tons.
Cotton textiles used only about three-fourths of their mill capacity;
the woolen and worsted industry ran about 60 per cent of capacity.

But even that section or that percentage of the plants that was in
operation produced vastly more than the market could absorb.
America was producing goods it could not sell either at home or
abroad; competition among the producing units therefore increased.
Every unit was trying to "produce cheaper than the other, which
meant on the one hand greater exploitation of the workers, and
on the other hand introduction of more and better machinery with
a greater capacity to produce. Wall Street at the same time was
doing its bit. Wall Street is the popular name for the greatest
"combination of ﬁnancial manipulators, and it was boosting stock
prices sky high. The price of stocks is based upon the expected
earning capacity of the unit that issues the stocks. This earning
capacity was declared by the advocates of Wall Street to be un-
limited. Prosperity was to go up and up in an unending spiral.
Stocks were rising all along the line, with very few exceptions.
New companies were formed and their stock unloaded on the public
at high prices. Old companies were issuing new stock in ever
greater numbers, cashing in on proﬁt-hungry and credulous people.
The big sharks of the stock exchange were making billions. The
volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange rose from

  

173,000,000‘ shares in 1921 to 1,125,000,000 shares in 1929. The‘

average price of leading industrial stocks rose from $79 in 1921 to

$366 a share» in 1929. The fat boys of Wall Street were having the

time of their lives. Everybody praised the glory of mass production
under the modern industrial system.

The structure was built on sand. The crash came. It was in-

evitable. Stocks tumbled down. Capitalist propagandists asserted
9

  

  

that it was only a violent “downward readjustment”. It was ‘more
than that. It was a disaster. Production, which lagged even before
the crash, began to decrease more rapidly. By 1932 the steel in-

,dustry was working at 15 per cent capacity, the automobile industry

decreased over 50 per cent, coal production decreased 55 per cent,
freight car loadings were down 50 per cent; the index of business
activity was around 50. Factory employment decreased 40 per cent,
and the total earnings of the workers decreased about 60 per cent.

W The loss in wages in 1932 amounted to over 20 billion dollars.

We are still in the grip of the economic crisis and all the stunts
and displays of President Roosevelt with his National Industrial
Recovery Act are of little avail. ,

Let us now cast a critical glance at the whole situation. They
call it depression and they wish to make you believe it is sheer
accident. But it isn’t. It is “a depression of a special type”. It is
rooted in the very nature of capitalism in its present stage, which is
the stage of a general crisis. Think of this: while you were speed-
ing your life out of yourself in a Ford plant or a Rockefeller mine,
the big. heads of the business corporations were garnering the proﬁts.
When 17 million workers had been dismissed to face the hazards
and miseries of unemployment, the big heads of corporations were

. still reaping proﬁts. True, they complained of hard times. But

these hard times have not made a single chairman of the board of
directors of the large corporations go begging in the streets for a
nickel to buy a cup of coffee. The “captains of industry and

* . ﬁnance”, as they call themselves, are well off, depression or no
‘depression, whereas the wages of the employed workers were cut

mercilessly and the unemployed were left to shift for themselves
with the beggarly Home Relief hardly suﬂicient to keep body and
soul together. Big business is still prosperous while the working
class is suffering the greatest hardships. Must that be?

And it is not the workers alone who suffer, either. The small and
poorest farmers, millions of them, are not much'better off. They,
too, feel the crushing hand of the big industrialists and bankers. As
producers of agricultural goods they have to sell; as consumers of
manufactured goods they have to buy. When they sell, they are
confronted with the food trusts, milk trusts and tobacco trusts which
pay them a small fraction of what they charge to the ultimate con-
sumer. When they buy, they are confronted with the agricultural
machinery trusts, the automobile trusts, the fertilizer trust and all

.other big corporations which charge high prices for their goods.

When they need money they are at the mercy of the banks; when

_ they transport their goods, they are at the mercy of "the railroad

magnates. In either case, they suffer.
The rich farmer, himself an exploiter, can stand his ground. The
small and poor farmers succumb. During the crisis, millions of
_ . V _ 10 . . - t

   

  

 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    

  

farmers have sunk tothe level of actual poverty and near-starvation.
Sturdy workers of the soil, often equipped with the best machinery

   

of men—-unable to feed themselves! Must that be? ‘
Under the New Deal, the prices of agricultural products have been
raised, but the farmer has to pay higher prices for manufactured

 
 
 

be beneﬁted by some of the provisions of the Roosevelt administra-
tion; the small and poorest farmers, millions of them, are on the
verge of ruin.

Nor is this all. We mentioned above the engineers, the draftsmen,
the chemists, and all those scientiﬁcally trained men and women
who actually manage a modern industrialestablishment. They did
splendid work in helping to build up American industry.‘ When
the crisis came many of them were dismissed without much ado.
Those who did not know how to manage industries dismissed those
who knew. Engineers who designed the Eighth Avenue subway in
New York are known to be selling shoe-laces for a living. Architects
with years of experience sleep in parks. The capitalists did not
need them any longer. They were “dismissed”, thrown out like old
rags. Dismissals became general throughout the entire educational
and cultural ﬁeld. Writers and artists, professors and research men,
inventors and teachers—all had to go. The plight of hundreds of
thousands of_ intellectuals is aggravated by the fact that for years
they were wont to think of themselves as part of the ruling class.

' They were “ﬁred” by the ruling class because they were no more
needed—for the owners of wealth.
_ Is this an accident? It is not. It is the outcome of an insane
system where wealth is owned, not by those who produce it, but by
H those who do not produce anything, who have amassed it out of the
  work of others under the protection of the law; a system where
 production is directed, not towards satisfying human wants, but
 A towards making proﬁts for the owners of wealth; a system where
' i ' productive capacity increases vastly while the purchasing power of
the people is being slashed through cuts in wages _and through the
exploitation of the working farmers by the large corporations; a
system where the primary purpose of labor—to satisfy the basic
needs of humanity——is completely lost sight of in the scramble for
bigger fortunes, for fatter stock exchange slices and more ruthless
“cleaning out” of the small fellow. Where there exist all these
contradictions of capitalism, a situation like the present is inevitable.
One outstanding feature of this situation is war. Economic
rivalries are extended from the home market to the world market.
Economic rivalries on an international scale lead to economic wars,
and economic wars lead to a clash of arms. This is a truth that

but the farmers’ debts have not decreased. The richest farmers may ‘

   

cannot be denied. Even Professor Raymond Moley, Roosevelt’s
former chief adviser, had to admit this. But not many realize that
this is no accident. It is a basic law of capitalism. The war of
1914-1918 was nothing but the clash of two coalitions of big powers,
one led by Germany and the other by Great Britain, for the economic
domination of the world. Great Britain was an old capitalist power
with colonies all over the world. Germany was a powerful new-
comer in the world of big industry and its colonial possessions were
small. On the eve of 1914«, capitalism was being strangled within
its own frontiers by the contradictions between mass production and
insufﬁcient purchasing power, as pointed out above. World expan-
sion had become imperative for the capitalism of every country.
Since there were no more free territories left on the globe for the
big industrial states to take possession of, the clash came. It was a
clash for the re-division of the earth.

This clash is now vastly more imminent than it was before 1914-.
Capitalism is literally choking within the borders of each state.
Capitalism is seeking to dominate the markets of the world. This
cannot be done by peaceful means. The London Economic Con-
ference of 1933, which was supposed to facilitate a peaceful coopera-
tion of the capitalists on an international scale, failed. The result
is a sharpening of the economic warfare. In this warfare the front
line is occupied by the duel between the pound and the dollar.
But other rivalries are not eliminated, like the growing intensity
of struggle between the U. S. A. and Japan for the domination of
the Paciﬁc, like the frantic efforts of Germany to get “a better place
under the sun”, which means a greater territory in Europe and
colonies on the other continents, or like the Japanese encroachments
upon the independence of China and the Japanese brand-new theory
of an Asiatic Monroe Doctrine, which in substance means that Japan
bids all other capitalist powers to keep hands off Eastern Asia and
the Paciﬁc in order that Japanese capitalists may be free to garner
proﬁts to their heart’s content.

In their mad hunger for new territories and markets the capitalists
of the world never for a moment lose sight of the Soviet Union.
Here is a country with great natural resources and a tremendous
amount of wealth. How happy the capitalists would be to swallow
it up! ' What proﬁts they could squeeze out of those millions of
workers and peasants if they became Colonials of the great im-
perialist powers! Added to economic appetites is the ever-present

desire to crush the dictatorship of the proletariat and the building
of Socialism in the Soviet Union which they hate so much. Hence
all the plots against the very existence of the Soviet Union. Hence
the open declarations by Germany and Japan that they aim to in-
crease their ‘territory at the expense of the Soviets. Hence the con-
nivance of other great powers in the machinations against the Soviets.

International rivalries and the lust for expansion make the
capitalist world one great armed camp. (The Soviet Union, because
it is not a capitalist country, does not need expansion and does not

ﬁght for foreign markets. It has proved its peacefulness through '

many years of international relations and would wish nothing better
than to be allowed freely to build up its new Socialist life. But
due to the continuous threat of attack, it was forced to build up its
Red Army, which is not only manned but oﬁicered by workers and
peasants and is therefore a real army of the people.) There is a
race for armaments among the great capitalist countries. Each one
is building more battleships, more bombing planes, more cannon,
greater armies; each one is producing more and deadlier poison
gases, disease germs and other means of destruction. America is
leading in this respect.

Capitalism breeds war. Capitalism cannot solve its contradictions
without war. But this solution is the solution of ruin. War is
devastation. It destroys not only precious human lives, but large
amounts of goods. It is an orgy of destruction. The brunt of a
capitalist war, however, is borne by those who- work.

Where capitalism is organized in big corporations to control the
markets, we have-monopoly capitalism. The States that are domi-
nating oppressed nations and are driving towards. war to control
foreign markets, are imperialist powers. The wars of the capitalist
countries that are waged for the purpose of dominating other coun-
tries to be used as markets, sources of raw materials and investment
grounds, are imperialist wars.

This is capitalism in its modern form. This is capitalist civiliza- --

tion. A palace built on crushed human bones. Glittering glory
for a few at the price of oceans of blood and tears of the many.
Progress running amuck at every step. Prosperity devouring itself
and devouring untold human lives. Expansion made possible by
killing and maiming huge masses of innocent people. Scientiﬁc
advance made to serve the purpose of destruction. Security for the
non-producers; starvation for the producers. The drones in great
esteem; the workers downtrodden and despised. Must that be?

The Communists say it must not. The Communists say this huge
waste of human energy and human resources, this colossal amount
of human suffering, this «humiliation of starving in the midst of
plenty, this living on the dumping grounds of big cities at a time
when humanity knows already how to build Empire State towers,

this debacle which is worse than war and pestilence, can be avoided. ’

Life can be made livable. Life can be made a. continuous and un-
interrupted stream of work, satisfaction of the basic human needs
of everybody, and cultural growth. This can be achieved only by
the working class arising to take over and organize society on a new

basis. This basis is to be Communism.

_ The Cure
i  propose, in. brief, that all resources, all land and buildings,

all manufacturing establishments, mines, railroads and other
means of transportation and communication,‘ should be, not private
 property, but the common property of all those who work. We
propose that production be made to serve the needs of those who
work, rather than to serve the enrichment of a few parasites. We
propose that parasitism should be abolished altogether and that
society should consist only of those who work, which means that all
members of society should be socially useful human beings. We
hold with science that production and distribution of goods can be
planned to avoid anything resembling the crisis in capitalist society.
' Planned economy on the basis of common ownership without any
class division is called Communism. ‘ '

PLANNING UNDER CAPITALISM IMPOSSIBLE *

Before we proceed we must say a word or two about the idea of
having planned economy under capitalism. .

If planning means anything, it means ‘organizing human activi-
ties in a certain direction to achieve a deﬁnite and clear-cut aim.
Planning a garden means undertaking a number of steps—like pre-
paring the ground, the seeds, the fences, putting the seeds into the
ground, etc.——which will ultimately result in a garden. You cannot
say you are planning a garden when your aim is rabbit-shooting.
You do not plan a garden when you think of digging into the ground

- for gold. This is so obvious that it does not need any proof. The
. aim is What determines the plan. The aim of planned economy
should be to satisfy the needs of the population by setting into ~
motion all the production forces of a country, or even of the whole
world. To secure a decent living for .everybo'dy—that is the aim.
To organize all economic activities accordingly—that is the plan.
But the aim of capitalism is not to secure a decent living for all.
The aim of capitalism is to secure—as they say-—“reasonable profits”
on investments. Proﬁts _come ﬁrst. The people come last. A
“reasonable profit” is a proﬁt that looks reasonable’ to the owners
of wealth—and that means all the traﬂic will hear. The needs of the
population are mentioned in speeches—but they do not determine
the actions of those who rule.

 
   
   
     
         
   
      
 

* PUBLIsHER’s NOTE: While this pamphlet was in the process of production,
the Supreme Court of the U. S. A. declared the “Codes” of the N. R. A. to be
. unconstitutional. This, however, does not invalidate the basic correctness of
the analysis herein contained. On the contrary, it only lends strength to the
argument that planning under capitalism is impossible.

' agricultural products.

_ few, greater misery for the masses.

‘This is what happened under the New Deal.
Nobody could say more beautiful words than Roosevelt did about
the New Deal- Why, the man was going to make everybody happy.
The New Deal was going to increase the purchasing power of the
country so that the manufacturers would be able to sell more goods.
When the manufacturers increase their sales they naturally have to
increase production. Increased production means more jobs. More .
jobs mean greater earnings for the workers. Greater earnings mean
greater purchasing power, greater markets. The farmers were not
to be left in the red either. Prices on farm products were to be
raised. Higher prices mean greater purchasing power in the hands
of the farmers. Greater purchasing power in the hands of the .
farmers means a greater market for manufactured goods. The 4
workers, with their increased purchasing power,’ were to buy more
Prosperity in the cities, prosperity on the
farms. Set the whole thing in motion—and it will go on and on.
A spiral rising ever higher with every new coil.

All this was to be planned. To prevent “unfair competition” the
manufacturersweregiven codes. _To secure decent wages the workers ‘
were promised a minimum wage and were given Section 7a. To
raise farm prices, ‘agricultural production was to be controlled. To
secure a general price rise, the gold content of the dollar was cut.
Everything was to click. Everybody was to cooperate with every-
body else. The government was to guide all concerned, like a 
benign old father, towards the goal——the “new social order”.

What was wrong in this elaborate scheme? It was based on "a
pretense. It pretended to overlook the basic laws of capitalism.
It wished you to believe that the manufacturers would raise wages _
without raising the prices of goods produced. It pretended to assume
that, having raised the workers’ wages, the manufacturers would not
increase the speed-up. It appealed to big business not to ﬁx un-
reasonably high prices on manufactured goods, while it gave the
united businessmen the power to do so—through their “codes”. It .
declared that the big trusts are interested, not in gouging the poor
farmer, but in making it easier for him. It peddled a fable about
the identity of interests of the capitalists and the workers, the
capitalists and the farmers. It put your hopes in the cheaper dollar,
concealing the fact that for the same nominal wage you" could buy A
fewer goods——in other words: that your real wages were cut. At
the same time the New Dealers told you that the purchasing power
of the workers would rise.

What was the result? The “plan” produced greater proﬁts for 21

Listen to the report of the Bureau of Internal ‘Revenue of the
USA. It deals with the change in the number of large tax-payers
from 1932 to 1933. In 1932 there were 20 rich men whose taxable

       

  

income was one million dollars or more. (The property of each one
of those “big shots” ran into» the billions.) In 1933 there were 46
such men. The number of the Very richest increased in the ﬁrst
year of the New Deal way above 100 per cent. The net income of
this group increased from 35 million in 1932 to 81 million in 1933.
For the same time‘the number of individuals with an income of
$5,000 or less decreased about three per cent. The total income re-
ported for the year increased only 2.5 per cent, which means that
prosperity for the country as a whole did not arrive. During the
same time, however, manufacturers’ proﬁts increased from 656
million to 1,200 million; trade proﬁts increased from 218 to 392
million dollars. This only shows that the income of the country
became concentrated in fewer hands. Roosevelt sang about the
“wider distribution of the national income”. In reality the rich
became richer; the poor became poorer.

During 1934'the process continued with greater speed. Accord-
ing to the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor
(which is very friendly to the N.R.A. and the New Deal), the net
proﬁts of 418 leading corporations increased in 1934 compared with
1933 from 605 million to 911 million—an increase of over 50 per
cent. The same corporations in 1932 had an income of only 49
million. Truly, big business was aided by the New Deal. In this
respect Roosevelt’s plan worked. Big business squeezed the small
businessmen ruthlessly and drove large numbers of them out of
business. Big trustiﬁed capital did well, indeed.

But how about the workers and the farmers who, together, form
the bulk of the population? According to the A. F. of L., there
were 11,459,000 unemployed in November, 1934, or 429,000 more
than in November, 1933. But then the A. F. of L. does not count
the semi-employed (those who work one or two days a week) and
those who never have been employed—the millions of youths that
have reached working age during these years. Basing itself on
governmental ﬁgures, the Labor Research Association estimates the
number of unemployed as equal to 17 million. Counting ﬁve
dependents to every two unemployed persons (which is the general
average), we arrive at the stupendous ﬁgure of 42.5 million men,
women, and children who have no means of making a living under
the New Deal. This is fully one third of the total population.

As to the workers’ wages, the New Deal promised higher wages.
But the New Deal created greater proﬁts. The proﬁts came from the
greater toil and the lower pay of the workers. The N.R.A. promised
to raise the wages of the lower-paid workers and to shorten the
hours for all. But, ﬁrst, the manufacturers increased the speed-up
of the work, that is to say—they squeezed more work in fewer
hours out of their wage-slaves; secondly, they cut the wages of the
higher-paid workers more than-they increased the lower wage levels.

,.%.

     

In other words, under the guise of helping the workers they sharp-
ened exploitation. The net result as reported by the President of the
A. F. of L. is that “comparing 1934« with 1933 . . . the workers’
yearly wage has increased 6.7 per cent . . . while the price of food
rose 11.3 per cent and prices of clothing and house furnishings rose
15.3 per cent. Clearly, the average employed workers’ standard of
living was lower in 1934 than in 1933.”

What is true of the workers is true also of the professionals, the
technicians, the teachers. Last December a report issued by the
Methodist Federation of Social Service had the following to say
about the fall in cultural standards: ’

“Some 9,000,000 families live in homes that conservative investi-
gation calls substandard. The people’s cultural standards lag. Hun-
dreds of rural schools have been closed; tens of thousands have
been reduced to only two and three months in a year; 5,000,000
unemployed youths have been trained for a type and standard of
living that is not available to them.”

There are 250,000 unemployed teachers in the U.S.A.

The situation of the farmers has also become worse. The New
Deal attempted crop control. The government paid the farmers for
land not cultivated or plowed under. People’s money was wasted
on the “plan” to have less cotton, less wheat and less meat produced
for the people. The rich farmer beneﬁted from higher farm prices.
The poor farmer, the tenant farmer, the share-cropper became poorer
because they had to pay increased prices for manufactured goods
while they were forced to sell their own products to the food trust
at low prices.

This is the net result of “planning” under the capitalist system.
Has it done away with the contradictions of capitalism? It has

sharpened them. It has created no markets either at home or abroad. ‘.

It has, on the contrary, decreased the purchasing power of the masses,
i.e., the home market. It has made wider the gulf between the
owners of wealth and those forced to sell their labor power. It has
intensiﬁed the class antagonisms.

One more feature to complete the picture. While thousands of
m’ills were standing idle, the manufacturers introduced ever better
labor-saving machinery in those mills that worked at least part of
the time. In 1933, the productivity of labor was 27 per cent higher
than it was in 1929. Today it is still higher. If the country were
to produce today as much as it produced in 1919 one third less
workers would be needed. What is to become of those that are
“not needed”? And with earnings cut over 40 per cent, who can
buy the goods produced with the better technical equipment?

The N.R.A. was looked upon as our example for the rest of the
capitalist world to follow. That the N.R.A. has failed is now ad-
mitted even by many of its former sponsors.

ECONOMIC PLANNING THAT IS REAL

When we Communists speak of planned economy we do not mean
a‘ plan similar to that of the N.R._A., which leaves all the waste-
fulness, all the inefﬁciency and all the criminal parasitism of capital-
ism untouched, only increasing the power of the big industrialists
. and bankers. We do not mean a system where the big industrialists
swallow up the small and middle industrialists and where the big
banker gobbles up everybody and everything.
a When We Communists speak of a society organized on the basis of
‘planned production and distribution we mean something entirely
different. What we have in mind is- very simple. It is clear-cut.
Take over from the private owners all natural resources, all mines,‘
factories, plants, railroads, ships. Turn all this into national prop-
A erty administered by the workers under a Soviet State. Do away
I with production for proﬁt. Make a survey of all available resources,
plant and man power. Figure out how much of the products of each
industry can be produced, say, in a year. Fix the annual consump-
tion of the population at this rate. When you do so you are sure that
nobody will go hungry or -without a roof over his head. But this
is not sufficient. Make it your purpose to increase production.
‘Employ the best services of scientists to improve your machinery
. and your methods of work. Encourage scientiﬁc research to advance
. science for the purpose of improving life.‘ Extend this improvement
not only to industry and agriculture but to all realms of life. The
output of industry is sure to increase. Distribute the fruits of in-
creased production among all the members of society. Improve
their well being. Increase production still more by further improv-
ing machinery and methods according to the latest data of science.
Distribute the beneﬁts of the increased production again among the
population without exception, always heightening the technique of
production to enrich the economic and cultural life of all the
members of society and to ease their labor. Continue this process
indeﬁnitely. When you do so there will be no crises, no unem-
ployment, no exploitation, no wars, no fear of the future.

Is this impossible? '

We do not even have to refer you. to the experiences of the Soviet
Union where this is actually being accomplished. We refer you to
f the experiences of these United States. The total national income
 (of the U.S.A. for 1928 was estimated at about 89.4 billion dollars.
‘This would have meant $750 for each of the 120 million of the
population of the United States, man, woman and child, or over
$2,000pa year for a family of three, if it were not for the fact that
.more than one-half of this national income went to owners of land

would go tothe private owners of land and capital because there‘ 5
would be no such owners, and everything would go to the working
people because everybody would be a worker. But Communism ‘
would not content itself with a national income equal to that pro
duced under capitalism. Communism is an incomparably higher or-
ganization of society than capitalism. If the Soviet Union, an A"
industrially backward country, was capable of increasing the output, .,~
of industry 300 per cent in ﬁve years, an industrially more highly
developed country like the U.S.A. would be able to increase .its  _
output at least ﬁve times in ﬁve years. Assuming then that the
national income of the American Soviet was originally equal to that
of 1928, the income of a family of three after the ﬁrst American j
ﬁve-year plan would be more than $10,000. If we- add the use of all‘-‘
the cultural facilities, all the buildings and all the playgrounds now I
denied the working class, the income in terms of utility would in
crease still faster. In ten years, even at a moderate rate of industrial‘-,,
development, working only about ﬁve hours a day, a family of thre
would have a standard of living measured today by, say, $20,000 a
year. And that would be only_a beginning, for human inventiveness},
knows no limit and the progress of science is unending. I
The application of science to human society was the slogan of th
technocrats in the heyday of their propaganda. But the technocrats.‘
proposed to busy themselves with production without reorganizingri
the foundation of society. This is why all their recommendations‘
remained suspended in the air. In one respect, however, they were?-
correct: they showed what immense possibilities for the satisfaction?
of human wants are contained in the achievements of science and
in its future growth. I
Communism _compared to capitalism is like capitalism compare a
to the economy of the native Indian population of three centuries‘:
ago. Communism builds. It encourages scientiﬁc advance on 
colossal scale. It makes man complete master of nature and of th
social system. It reduces human labor to the easy task of supervising}
machinery a few hours a day. It leaves mankind free to engage in"
the higher intellectual pursuits. It makes every worker a highly
cultured being and everybody responsible for the welfare of all. It
inscribes on its portals: Let everybody work according to his ability
let everybody receive from the common stock of goods according
to his needs. In the lower stage‘of Communism, called Socialis ,
the rule is that everybody receives according to his work; but here
too there is no exploitation, no oppression, no insecurity, no poverty,
but everybody is working and work is made the badge of honor;
Life is made humane. With this begins the great ascent of man.

But isn’t it a utopia? Aren’t those Communists dreamers? We
propose to show that the Communists are the greatest realists, that
the program advanced by them is not only capable of fulﬁllment,
but that the forces that will realize it are already in operation.

UTOPIA AND SOCIAL SCIENCE

year of prosperity in America. Everybody praised the new era.
Professors advanced ingenious theories to show that the progress of
industrial’ expansion could not be checked. Newspapers hailed the
great organizers of industry, who, in their judgment, made this un-
precedented progress possible. Preachers and scenario writers,
vaudeville singers and Senators, generals and Salvation Army lassies
—everybody gloried in America’s powerful upswing. And the
leaders of the Socialist Party, who are supposed to be against
capitalism, declared that capitalism in America was on the upgrade,
i that its constructive forces were growing and that the only way
radicals could expect to accomplish anything was by pleading with
the powers that be for some concessions to alleviate certain social
evils. -

It looked all sweetness and light. But there were those stubborn
Communists who refused to share in the general hallelujah. Those
fellows were equipped with the Marxian method. Some clever guys
in the American labor movement made light of that “old German
scholar” Karl Marx, who, they said, spent his life in the British
1 Museum and knew nothing about America of today. Yet what Marx
did was to provide revolutionary workers with a method wherewith
-to analyze society, and that method can be applied to every society
whether Marx himself is alive or not. The Marxian method was
‘further advanced by Lenin who applied Marxism to 20th century
capitalism, the era of the rule of ﬁnance capital, which he called
imperialism. Lenin was thus able to predict, not only the World
War, but also the Russian revolution.

’ The method of Marx and Lenin made it possible for the Com-
~munists of America to foresee what all the thousands of learned

    
  
  
   
  
   
 
  
    
   
   
  
  
    
  
   
    
  
  

ofthe crisis in the U.S.A. Why was it possible for them to predict
the coming disaster? Because they analyzed the basic forces of
capitalist society, they understood the maturing contradictions, they
did not let themselves be fooled by the superﬁcial progress. They
were the only realists in America. Compared with them, such men
as Ford and Morgan, Mellon and Dawes, Hoover and Mills, looked
like shadow-hunting fools.

The NRA. is another example. When this child of the New Deal

 was born there wasn’t a group or a party in America—outside of the

Communists—that did not greet it with high hopes. Everybody saw
the coming of a new era. Everybody sang Roosevelt’s praises. Con-
gress ate out of Roosevelt’s hand. Labor leaders bowed before the
great planner. Socialist leaders hailed the plan as a way to
socialism. The press was one great stream of enthusiasm. All were
happy. The Communists alone sounded the warning to the working
class. They pointed out from the very beginning that the N.R.A.
aimed to secure greater proﬁts for the bosses at the expense of lower
living standards for the workers. They foresaw the further crushing
of the small businessmen by large-scale business. They realized
that the NRA. could not abolish the crisis because it did not plan
to do away with private ownership of wealth.

Or take the realism of Soviet achievements. When the Com-
munists (Bolsheviks) seized power in Russia in November 1917,

all the wise men of the world, statesmen and professors, socialists.

and liberals, predicted the imminent downfall of the new regime.
Yet the Communists believed it could succeed. Here and elsewhere,
the Communists were equipped with the Marxian analysis. They
were under the leadership of Lenin. They knew what all the
theoreticians of the capitalist countries refused to understand: that
within the working class there had come into being a new power,
a new consciousness born out of ‘the new freedom, a new driving
force that could not be crushed. Were they dreamers? Far from
it. They were scientists, social scientists. The Communists are the
only social scientists in the world today.

A scientist is not against dreaming, but his dreams are real. A
scientist has before his mental eye the whole structure he plans to
erect before the pﬁrst foundation stone is laid. — Is he dreaming?-
Not at all. He is equipped with the understanding of the laws of
nature; he knows his material; he knows how to arrange it; he
visualizes all the processes which his material will have to go through
until it is shaped to form a building. He knows the machinery and
the other equipment necessary to carry his plan to completion. And
yet, he is the biggest dreamer in the world because he dreams of
things that can be made to_ exist. His dreams are not shadows.
They are forecasts of realities to“come. -

In the very same way, Communists are dreamers. But they are
practical dreamers. They see the forces of present-day society at
work. They see the trend of this work. They realize the absolutely
unavoidable outcome of the clash of social forces. They realize
what has to be done in order to hasten the unavoidable outcome‘.
They have before their mental eye a complete picture of the funda-
mentals of society to be erected on the ruins of capitalist society.
They see the social instruments whereby this stumbling block of a

capitalist system can be cleared away to give room to the new, the

Communist, society. They apply their forces at the most advan-
tageous points to achieve the greatest results. .

While the ﬁnal goal, the Communist Society, is always kept in
the Communists’ mind, they have a practical and realistic program
for every day. They do not expect you to sit idly by and wait until
a Communist Society has fallen into your lap like a ripe apple off
a tree. They formulate for the working class a program of action
through struggle, based on the needs of the workers and toiling
farmers at the present time.

IV

The State

WE have surveyed the economic system that is the basis of
capitalist society. Let us now examine its political super-
structure, the State.

You have been taught that we live in a democracy, that the in-
stitutions of this country are bulwarks of freedom, that the govern-
ment of the U.S.A. is a government by, for and of the people.
From time to time you are allowed to cast your vote, and on this
occasion you are told that by universal suffrage the “sovereign will
of the people” is expressed.

Yet, somehow or other, you as a worker and millions like you
have small chance with the State. Take such an issue as unemploy-
ment insurance. A law to guarantee every unemployed worker a
certain subsistence minimum is a vital necessity, for the workers.
Over ﬁve years have passed since the beginning of the economic
crisis. Numerous laws have been passed to protect the bankers, the
real-estate owners, the mortgage holders, the railroad magnates—but
very few laws to alleviate the sufferings of the unemployed through
direct State aid. Apparently the State is not there to aid the workers.

The Wagner-Lewis bill pending in Congress does not provide un-
employment insurance for any working man or woman now unem-
ployed. The bill proposes to creategfiunds for those who will become
unemployed in the future—and those funds are to be meagre enough.
The bill is a mockery of unemployment insurance, an insult to the
working class.

Or take another example. There are laws and courts and jails for
the criminals—and you were told that all citizens are equal before
the law. But you know perfectly well that a big swindler, a banker
who robbed a great many poor people of their savings, a racketeer
who is extorting hundreds of thousands from innocent people, sel-
dom lands in jail, and if he does, he is soon pardoned or else his
imprisonment is turned into something like a vacation in a country

22 '

club. But if you, a worker, steal a loaf of bread to satisfy your
hunger, the law will be after you and there will be no mercy.

A RICH MAN’s STATE

The truth of the matter is that this is a rich man’s State and a
rich man’s government. The State is there to act on behalf of
finance capital and to protect its interests against the people. The
government is the executive committee of the big trusts.

You, an American worker, may be shocked to hear such a state-
ment. You have been fed so much “democracy” bunk that you
think it almost sacrilege to reveal the true nature of the State. This
is exactly what your masters are after with their propaganda. They
want you to believe that the State is holy and that its high function-
aries are like saints surrounded by halos. All the pulpits, schools,
newspapers, radio, lectures, moving pictures and other sources of
information controlled by big business are engaged in giving you
false notions about the State. Yet consider for a moment the simple
fact that one per cent of the population controls nearly two thirds of
the nation’s wealth,—and it willnot be diﬁicult for you to realize
that the individuals composing this one per cent must have vastly
more power than the individuals composing the 87 per cent of the
population who own, together, only 10 per cent of the national
wealth. Compare your own inﬂuence with the inﬂuence of the big
banker of your community in dealing with the precinct_ policeman,
the police captain, the judge, the prison warden, the governor, the
legislature. Why, a plain worker doesn’t count at all when it comes
to what they call the seats of power.

The State is an instrument of power in the hands of the big in-

dustrialists, bankers and landlords, who by this token are the ruling '

class. The State is there to effect the exploitation and oppression
of the workers and the poor and small farmers, and also of the
subjugated colonial peoples, by the ruling class. The Constitution,
the government, its laws, its agencies: the army, the militia, the
police, the courts, the jails, the legislatures——all are there to effect
the exploitation and oppression of you and millions like you.

We know you, an American worker, may hate to call yourself
“exploited” and “oppressed”. You have been taught false pride,
not the pride of refusing to be exploited, but the pride of refusing
to admit that you are exploited. Your refusal, however, does not
change the fact that the coal barons squeeze the last drop of your
life blood for the sake of their profits and that when you go out
on strike the State sends its deputy sheriffs and militia to crush your
resistance. Here, in labor disputes, you can easily recognize the
State as the executive committee and the strong arm of entrenched
wealth.

We Communists do not like the expression, “labor dispute”. It
suggests a disagreement among people on an equal basis. It sug-
gests a friendly bickering of parties to an agreement who ‘happen
to disagree on a certain point. It suggests an amicable and per-
fectly lovely settlement of mutual grievances. What a false and
misleading notion! There are no labor disputes. There is the wish
ofthe capitalist to press some more sweat and blood out of the
workers, and there is the wish of the workers to ﬁght their enemy,

representatives may try to achieve the ends of capital by cajoling
and wheedling. But they always keep the big stick‘ ready. The
State——that is the big stick of the owners of wealth, the big stick
of the big corporations. ,

This is the only realistic view of the State. Every one who tries
to persuade you that the State is your friend, your defender, that
the State is impartial and only “regulatory”, is misleading-.

We hear Roosevelt saying that the State is there to protect both
industry and labor. But under capitalism you cannot protect both
“industry” (meaning the capitalists) and labor (meaning the
workers)! When you protect “industry” you give it freedom to
exploit “labor”. When you protect labor you make it possible
for labor to get more out of industry. You cannot keep ﬁre and
water reconciled.

In reality the State under Roosevelt is a more efﬁcient instrument
at the service of big capital than it wasunder Hoover. All these
administrators, adjusters and consolidators are nothing but agents
of the State serving the interests of big business. The States locally
are especial instruments of the capitalists. The militia is rampant
everywhere. Sheriifs are breaking up strikes. Policemen are carry-
ing out evictions. Militant workers are being imprisoned for strike
activity. Unemployed workers and their leaders are being clubbed
and jailed for demanding relief. Negroes are lynched under the
ben_evolent guardianship of the State.

You were told that the State under the New Deal guarantees you
the right of collective bargaining. Section 7a of the National In-
dustrial Recovery Act, you were told, guaranteed the workers the
right to bargain collectively through representatives.“of their own
choosing”. But the State helped the manufacturers to use this very
section to organize company unions which carry out the will of the
employer. Section 7a has been used, says a former government
agent, Thompson, appointed by Roosevelt to investigate the N.R.A.,
“to force through compulsory arbitration and company unionism”.
As to enforcement of Section 7a, that is to say, punishing those

bosses who do not carry out the provisions of the N.R.A., Mr. Biddle,
Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, declared in a
report, March 13, 1935, that “enforcement had virtually been sus-
pended”, that in no case except one had suit been brought against

an employer and that in the one exception the employer had been——‘

found not guilty.

The State under the New Deal has greatly increased its machinery
which is working overtime against the workers. The State has in-
corporated into its Boards a number of important reformist leaders;

the N.R.A. is supported by most of the leadership of the A. F. of L. ‘

With their open or covert aid, the State has broken many a splendid
strike and robbed the workers of the fruit of many a ycaliant struaggle
by dispatching against them either armed men or mediators or
both. .

If you, a worker, fail to realize that these bluecoats and district
attorneys, judges and prison wardens, governors and presidents,
generals and admirals, “mediators” and “arbitrators”, together with
tne gentlemen in the legislatures, State and Federal, are nothing but

a corps of agents of big capital, you are merely reacting the way .

these gentry wish you to.

The Communists are the only group in present-day society who i

recognize the basic nature of the capitalist State. The State may
change its appearance and its appendices. It may use the par-

liamentary system, with a limited freedom of speech to opponents—— ''

as long as this opposition is not too dangerous. It tightens the
screws and tries to silence the opposition when the situation becomes

disturbing for big capital—as this was done under Wilson during,

the war. It may do away with parliamentary procedure altogether
and institute an open reign of terror when danger to capitalism
becomes particularly acute due to the rising tide of the revolutionary
labor movement—as was done in fascist Germany. The forms
change. The phraseology differs according to time and place. The
essence remains. The essence of the capitalist State is service in the
employ of capitalism for the preservation of capitalism.

THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES

On the question of the State the Communists naturally and un-
avoidably come into clash with other political parties. The question
is putlsquarelyz Can the working people achieve their liberation by
merely using the State machinery of capitalism? To this question
the liberals answer in the aﬂirmative; the reformist union leaders

answer in the affirmative; the Socialists answer in the affirmative; the '

Communists answer in the negative. _
The liberals are dissatisﬁed with the functions of the State. They

  

point out its “shortcomings”. They do not close their eyes to the -. A
25 ‘

 
 

fact that there is inequality. They know the war-breeding nature
of the capitalist State. But what do they propose to do? They
propose a little tinkering here and there. Direct primaries were
one act of such tinkering. The abolition of the lame duck session
is another. The initiative and referendum is a third. But’ that has
nothing to do with the very nature of the State as ,a bulwark of
private property and capitalist exploitation. -

An improvement in the electoral laws, an extension of the freedom
of the press, no matter how important for the working class, does
not touch upon the fundamentals of the capitalist State, namely, its
being an instrument. of power in the hands of the big owners of
wealth. Improve the State—and you have made it more flexible,
more capable of adapting itself to circumstances; you have made
it a better instrument of oppression.

The American labor leaders of the William Green, Matthew W011
and John Lewis type, do not wish to have a revolutionary political
party organized to defend the interests of the working class. They
are not opposed to the capitalist system even in words. They pro-
pose to support such representatives of the Republican and Demo-
cratic parties as are willing to introduce reforms on behalf of labor.
Not much breath need be wasted on the program of the labor

3 leaders of “punishing enemies and rewarding friends”. The Re-

publican and Democratic parties are the parties of big capital. They
may ﬁght one another at the elections for the control of the ad-
ministration, but they differ little from each other and they do the
bidding of the big trusts. Their treasuries are ﬁlled from the coffers
of the big industrialists and bankers- and, quite often, their chief

leaders are, themselves, big industrialists or bankers or both (Andrew.

Mellon, Charles Dawes, the late Dwight Morrow in the Republican
Party; Owen D. Young, John Raskob, Bernard Baruch in the Demo-
cratic Party). To expect that the gentlemen of these parties will help
the workers achieve their end is to expect that the leopard will
change its spots.

The Socialists, on the other hand, have their own political party
and they claim to be opposed to the capitalist system. They some-
times wax eloquent in denouncing the evils of the capitalist system.
But what do they propose? They propose to “improve” the capitalist
State so as to make it an instrument for doing away with private
ownership of wealth. In other words, they preach the nonsense of
turning the exploiters’ club, by the power of prayer, into a rose-
bush. Since this “theory” appears in the garb of Socialism and
since there are a number of workers who lend it their ear, it is
necessary to dwell on it a little longer.

NO NEED OF REVOLUTION?

The Socialists say there is no need "of a revolution. They say
democracy has prepared for the workers all the means necessary to
achieve Socialism. Let the workers use universal suffrage, they say,
to send Socialists into the legislative assemblies. Let the Socialists
form a majority in these assemblies. When this is done, the road

L is open to pass laws abolishing the capitalist system. Of course,

there is the Federal Constitution which prohibits the conﬁscation of
property by legal procedure, but this, says the leader of American
Socialists, Mr. Norman Thomas, can be overcome. Let us have a
Constitutional Convention to amend the Constitution so as to permit
Congress to enact Socialist legislation. Let Congress then enact a
law which orders the big corporations to cede their industrial estab-
lishments and all their property to the State. Let us not expro-
priate them, say the Socialists, not by any means! Let us pay them
with bonds issued by the government and redeemable in thirty
years. This will mean introducing Socialism by paciﬁc methods.
No revolutions; no seizure of power; no infringement upon the law;
no mass action; no expropriation of the exploiters. Everything
lawful. Everything in a gentlemanly fashion. The electoral law
works. The citizens vote. The legislators assemble. They count
noses and ﬁnd a Socialist majority. The Socialist majority, both
in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, passes a law.
Capitalism passes out. The big trusts bow before the “will of the
people”. “Gentlemen, you. are the lawful heirs of our system”, they
say politely, and leave the stage for the Norman Thomases and
their associates.

What a sweet picture! And how deceptive! We are sorry to
mar such an idyllic scene. But we Communists are realists, and we
do not wish to be carried away by fancies, especially when these
fancies are beneﬁcial to the capitalist system as they tend to keep
workers from ﬁghting the capitalist State. '

Let us not argue at length about the ingenious invention of paying
the owners of industrial establishments with bonds, which means
recognizing that the exploiters- are entitled to their monopoly of the
means of production and that, if they are to give them up, it is to
be only through sale. It is not really difficult to see that if you
pay your exploiters with bonds, you continue their exploitation in
another form. You may have taken over the factories but you still
continue working for the proﬁts of the former owners. Everybody
can see that. Let us rather examine the proposal of introducing
Socialism by means of the ballot.

What does the State consist of? It consists not only of the legis-
lative assemblies, which, by the way, play a lesser and lesser role as
big monopoly capitalism grows. It consists ﬁrst of all of the army

with its commanding staﬁ, the militia, the police force and the
executive branch of the government-which uses the armed forces to

achieve the ends of capitalism. Is it possible to get a majority of V’

Socialist Congressmen? Even assuming that such a miracle would
happen, it still wouldn’t spell Socialism. Even before there is any
danger of a majority of Socialists actually ready to legislate Social-

t ism, the electoral laws can be changed to prevent such an emergency.

Even were a Socialist majority to convene, their decisions may not
be carried out. One squad of soldiers is suﬂicient to disperse an
entire legislative assembly, the way this was done in Italy, in Ger-
many, and in many other countries.

In case of a Socialist majority, we have before us one of two
possibilities. Either the capitalists are certain that the Socialist
leaders are harmless to capitalism—as was the case on numerous
occasions in Germany and England when power was in the hands
of the Socialist leaders; in such a case they will rather be glad to
have them carry the burden of government for capitalism; or the
capitalists do not like that Socialist majority, because it suits their
interests better to have an open dictatorship,—and then they will
have every means to get rid of the unwelcome legislators.

Remember that the Socialists are against revolutionary methods.
Remember that they do not appeal to the masses to offer resistance
against brutal capitalist oppression. And do not forget that capital-

- ism is armed to the teeth and that it will use its armed force to secure

its domination. Capitalism never gives up its wealth and power
voluntarily and it has little respect for its own laws when it comes
to defend its rule. . ,

He who says that you can use the capitalist State to abolish
capitalism verily resembles one who says you can demolish the

I ’ enemy fortress by the sounds of trumpets.

It would seem at ﬁrst glance that the Socialists are merely en-

‘ a ed in da dreamin . Unfortunatel , it isn’t as harmless as that.

The activities of the Socialist leaders are actually harmful to the
interests of the workers.

What is the real role of the Socialist leaders? We have no
quarrel with those rank-and-ﬁle workers who are at heart revolu-
tionists and Socialists but do not see through the fog of Socialist
phrases. But we are obliged to point at the pernicious role of the
Socialist leaders. At a time when it is necessary for the workers to
understand the real nature of the State as an instrument of exploita-
tion and oppression, they tell the workers that the State, as con-
stituted at present, can be a means of liberating them from
exploitation and oppression. At a time when it is necessary for the
workers to gather strength and ﬁght against the capitalist State and

its laws, the Socialists preach to the workers a reliance on this very ‘

State and its laws. At a time when it is necessary for the workers

to. develop the will to power which shall ultimately crush the
capitalist State and make the workers and farmers the ruling power
in -a State of their own making, the Socialists tell the workers that -
nothing of the kind is needed_ and that they have to remain within
legal limits prescribed for them by the ruling class.

The’ Socialist Party of the U.S.A. has recently become divided '
into three major factions: the “old guard”, the “militants”, and the
Revolutionary Policy Committee. The “old guard” are rock-ribbed
reactionaries who have openly supported the N.R.A. and who boost
capitalist democracy. The “militants” waver, in Words, towards ,
class-struggle polices. In practice, however, although they are the _
majority of the National Executive Committee, they have virtually
been capitulating to the “old guard” on all major issues. As to the
Revolutionary Policy Committee, it is torn between revolutionary
sentiments and the reformism of the Socialist Party. While the “old
guard” deﬁnitely and openly opposes the united front ‘of. workers’ .
struggle, While the “militant” leaders employ tactics of delaying and ,
blocking, the Revolutionary Policy Committee has never put up a 1
real ﬁght within the Socialist Party for a united front. Common
to all groups is their shrinking before revolutionary struggle. The
division within the Socialist Party only serves to show that the
rank-and-ﬁle Socialist workers are becoming tired of reformist
policies and are moving to the Left. It is their pressure that makes,
the leadership shaky.

VITAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED

Our dispute with the Socialists is not a dispute in words. It is a
clash in politics. Perhaps we needinot go so far as the summer of
1917 in Russia, when the Socialists, holding power, refused to ally
themselves with the workers and peasants organized in Soviets
against the exploiters and their State, but rather entrenched them-
selves in the capitalist State together with the exploiters against the
workers and peasants, until they were dislodged by the November,
1917, Revolution,‘ under Bolshevik leadership, which crushed the
capitalist State and established the Soviet State as the organ of
power of the workers and poor peasants.

Perhaps we need not go back to 1918 and 1919 in Germany,
right after the November, ‘1918, Revolution, when the Socialists,
taking over the power in the capitalist State, actually crushed the
uprising of the Workers, ﬂooded the country with workers’ blood ‘
and thus secured Germany for capitalism. We have facts of the _
more recent past which are no less illuminating. C

For fourteen years the Socialists held power in Germany. There
is a cruel logic to the situation of a Socialist leader becoming a
defender of the capitalist State. Once you, defend the State there

. « 29- ' . .

 
     
   
   
  

     

  

  

is no reason why you should not become a member of the Cabinet
in the government of that State. The Socialists became ministers,
chiefs of police, judges, prison wardens, executioners, in the Ger-

‘ man State. This was the case not only in Germany, but also in

Great Britain, in Austria, in Belgium, and elsewhere. Once you are

A part of the machinery of the capitalist State, you of necessity do

the bidding of the owners of wealth. . Such is the nature of that

State.

The Socialists everywhere fought against the revolutionary labor
movement which was trying to secure higher wages, shorter hours
and better working conditions. They suppressed workers’ demon-
strations by force of arms. Remember Wedding and Neukoeln,
sections of Berlin, where a Socialist chief of police, using Socialist
policemen, ﬁred machine guns point-blank at workers celebrating

 

M May First by a street demonstration, and where scores of workers .
'were killed. Remember a Socialist air minister in the Socialist

MacDonald Cabinet of Great Britain sending military airplanes to
drop bombs on Arabian villages in territories in which an oppressed
nation arose against foreign rule. Remember a Socialist war minister
in the same Cabinet sending troops to India to crush the struggles
of the workers and peasants for Indian freedom and thus to secure

' India for the British capitalist exploiters. Remember the activities

    

of the German Socialist leaders in cutting the wages of the workers,
in cutting the unemployment insurance of the workers, in voting
appropriations for the construction of battleships and allowing
the fascists full freedom of propaganda, organization and action.
When the fascist danger became acute, the Socialist leaders, instead
of agreeing to united action of all the workers, whether Socialist or
Communist, against fascism, made common cause with Von Hinden-
burg, appealing to the workers to vote for him as the savior of
“democracy”. The German Socialist leaders did not defend the
interests of the workers but they defended the interests of the
capitalist State in its democratic form. They allowed the Nazis to
grow strong and to seize the power of State.

There is blood on the hands of many Socialist leaders, blood of
the workers. Do not call us vindictive when we say that these
Socialist leaders are traitors to the working class. We merely call
a spade a spade. We are realists.

We have discussed the war danger. What is the stand of the
Socialists towards the war danger? In 1912 the Socialist Parties
of the world met in Basle, Switzerland, at an extraordinary congress
of the Socialist International, and passed a resolution pledging
everybody to ﬁght for Socialism in case of war. But when the
imperialist world War came, in 1914, the leadership of the major
Socialist Parties joined hands with their capitalist governments in
delivering the masses to ﬁght the war for the proﬁts of the capitalists,

' 30

 

  ;—::=’= :5

 

for colonies, for markets, for plunder. Since then the parties of
the Socialist International have been instrumental in preparing the
war and in carrying out the war policies of their capitalist overlords.

An extraordinary international Socialist Conference met in Paris
at the end of August, 1933. The Socialist leaders discussed the
question of fascism, the question of war and peace. Did they
suggest any effective remedy against fascism? The only real remedy
is a revolution of the working class to overthrow capitalism by ﬁrst
destroying the capitalist State. But the Socialist leaders were op-
posed not only to revolution; they were opposed even to the united
front of struggle against war and fascism. The Socialist leaders
again talked “democracy” instead of revolution. They talked League
of Nations and disarmament conferences instead of a real mass
struggle against war. What was the actual achievement of the

- Socialist conference? It spread illusions among the workers to the

effect that by using the instrumentality of the capitalist State, they
can abolish-the evils of capitalist oppression and by using the
instrumentality of capitalist international institutions like the League
of Nations or the Hague Tribunal, they can abolish wars.

We in America have not seen'_ Socialists in the role of Cabinet
members or Senators. But we have seen Socialist Congressmen,
Socialist mayors (-Milwaukee, Reading, Bridgeport), Socialist judges
and Socialist chiefs of police. Were they in any way ﬁghting the
capitalist State? Not at all. A Socialist Congressman during the
imperialist world war gave his consent to all the military appropria-
tions. Another Socialist Congressman later gave his consent to the
predatory Versailles Treaty, the venomous child of the war. The S0-
cialist city administrations were as adamant in refusing to introduce
unemployment insurance as were the Republican and Democratic city
administrations. Workers demanding home relief and unemployment
insurance were just as brutally beaten up in Milwaukee and Reading
under a Socialist mayor, as were their class brothers in Pittsburgh
and New York under Republican and Democratic mayors. A
Socialist mayor in Milwaukee was no less prompt in cutting the
wages of city employees than was his Democratic master in the White
House in cutting the wages of the federal employees. And just as
the Socialists of every other country condone and support the wage-
slashing actions of the capitalists, so the Socialists of the United
States condoned and supported the National Recovery Act which is a
concerted attack on the living standards of the masses.

In the summer of 1934, at their Detroit convention, the Socialist
leaders, under pressure from below, reversed themselves and voiced
mild criticism of the N.R.A. But those were mere words. The
Socialist leaders did not undertake any action to ﬁght the N.R.A.

Many of them continued cooperation with government boards. Many

of them continued preaching that the N.R.A. was a boon for the
Workers.
A The Socialists of the United States are not in the Cabinet, but
 they have “arrived”. They are treated by the capitalist masters with
 respect. They are “good”. They are peaceful. They are loyal.
‘ They are held up as a shining example in opposition to the militant
Communists. The labor baiter, Mr. Grover Whalen, one time chief
V of police of New York and later N.R.A. administrator for that city,

appealed to the Republican, Democratic and Socialist politicians
alike to help him in the blue eagle drive. A Socialist leader,
' Panken, was appointed judge by the capitalist mayor of New York.
' Another Socialist was appointed member of a charter committee
which is to improve the Constitution of the City of New York—for
the beneﬁt of the bankers. Time is not far distant when the
Socialists may be called to governmental positions-—to stem the
tide of rising workers’ revolts by means of sweet phrases about
achieving Socialism by the power of the ballot. ~

The capitalist State is a glaring fact. It is ﬂesh and blood of the
. capitalist system. It stands in the way of the workers’ progress

towards a new, free life. Can it be abolished by gradual trans-
formation? Those who say it can are the staunchest supporters
of the capitalist robbers and the most active promoters of im-
.perialist wars. Their theory is not harmless, indeed. It is a
poisonous theory. It is a smoke screen behind which cruel
capitalist exploitation is hiding. »

We Communists say that there is one way to abolish the capitalist
State, and that is to smash it by force. To make Communism pos-
sible the workers must take hold of the State machinery of capitalism
and destroy it.

A Program of Action
1. ECONOMIC STRUGGLE

OW can it be done?
. Once you agree that this State is your enemy the answer
v to the question is not difficult. Once you have freed yourself from
the democracy illusion your road is clear. ' _
Watch the State. Try to understand every one of its maneuvers.
The State is often used by the capitalists not only as a big stick but
also as poison gas or as an anesthetic, as is the case under the New
T Deal. Quite often you are told you are given privileges at the same
time that your pockets are being picked. Analyze the functions of
the State. Try to understand the forces behind its actions. And

remember that if it ever yields anything to the workers it does so i

under pressure.

This leads us to the road along which the working class can arrive
at the destruction of the capitalist State: revolutionary struggle.

The working class is placed in this capitalist society in'a position
where to live it must ﬁght. This ﬁght, to be effective, must be
aimed not only at the capitalists but also at their State. And once
the ﬁght is effective enough it must inevitably lead to the smashing-
up of the State. This is the logic of the class division of today.

- And this indicates the program of action for the working class for
today and tomorrow and day after tomorrow until the ﬁnal reckon-

ing with the capitalist system has arrived.

The ﬁght begins in factory, mine, and mill. It is ﬁrst of all a.
ﬁght for higher wages, for shorter labor hours, for better working"
conditions. It is a ﬁght for unemployment insurance, for social in--
surance "generally, by which is understood that the State pays a,
minimum wage to those out of work, to the sick, the injured, and._

the aged. Capitalists love to indulge ‘in humanitarian phrases.

History has proved, however, that they never grant anything to the ’

working class unless forced to do so by the ﬁght of the workers;
This is why the -very existence of the working class is under the
sign, Fight. ,

Every ﬁght, however, demands its own organization. The work-

ing class has long created agencies for the economic struggles: ,

the labor unions and the unemployed councils, the former to ﬁght

for better conditions for those employed, the latter to ﬁght for those‘-
who are unemployed. We call these struggles economic because ..
their main purpose is to secure for the workers a larger share of ‘
the products created by their own labor. They challenge the eco- 

nomic power of the ruling class.

Not much acumen is needed to realize that economic struggles.
can not remain purely economic. When you strike, when you form ,

a picket line, the State in the shape of policemen and armed thugs
rushes to the aid of the employers. When you demonstrate for social
insurance you are again confronted with the armed force of the
State which is busy “dispersing the crowd”. We are living now

under the blue eagle. The National Industrial Recovery Act prom-i
ised the workers pie in the sky. But under this new dispensation .

one injunction after thepother is issued against the strikers. One
“arbitrator” after another is sent to confuse the workers, to promise
them a favorable settlement if they give up the strike—only to betray
them in the end. The very aim of the N.R.A. is to crush the re-
sistance of the workers. It is therefore inevitable that whenever the
workers are bent on actually defending their economic demands
they are forced to ﬁght the State.

' We Communists hold that every class struggle is a political strug-

33

   

 

  

    

I gle. -When you demand social insurance you address yourself both

to the capitalists and to the State. When you demonstrate for home

relief you present your demands to the city or state government,

which is a political body. When you ﬁght for the eight-hour work
day or the abolition of child labor by law you are defending an
economic demand by directing your struggle against the State.
When you ﬁght for higher wages to be gotten from the owners of a

-plant or a mill you always confront the agencies of the State not

only as policemen but also as injunction judges, as “mediators”,
“arbitrators”, and other kinds of official “peacemakers” who have
the interests of the employers at heart. This is why we say that
every class struggle is a political struggle.

THE LABOR UNIONS. THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL INSURANEE

And it is here that we Communists come into the sharpest clash
with the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and similar
organizations, including unions under Socialist leadership, all of

H‘ which we term “reformist”. It is a foundation stone of the policy of

such labor leaders to cooperate with the State. These leaders claim
to defend the interests of the workers but they also claim that they

have no quarrel with the system. The most they admit is that they

have “labor disputes” with some “unfair” employers. The State to
them is fair. The majority of capitalists, they believe, is also fair.
The minority of recalcitrant employers, they say, must be either ca-
joled or persuaded or else frightened by public opinion to fall ir1
line. Once this is accomplished, they contend, nothing remains for
the workers but to “cooperate” with their employers and the govern-
ment for the common beneﬁt of all.

Again we have before us a rosy picture. And again we must

‘ remain realists. We must see those leaders in action. We must

unmask them before the workers.

At first, however, we call your attention to the very outlook of
many of those leaders, to what is called in scientiﬁc language their
ideology. They proceed from the conception of unity of interests
between employer and employee. By this alone they deceive the
workers. There is no more unity between the‘ employer and em-
ployee than there is between the robber and the robbed. There
is a clash- of interests. There is an eternal antagonism. There

can be no peace and no unity between the exploiter and his

victims. The capitalist strives to secure for himself as much of the
workers’ product as he can get by force or fraud or both; the work-

_ ers, resisting exploitation, strive to get as big a share of their own

product as they can force the boss to yield. That is fundamental.

That is the law of capitalist society.‘ It is the division of classes.

Itis the never-ending class conflict as‘ long as capitalism lasts. This
34

conflict may not always break out in mass action, like demonstra-
tions and strikes, but it always smolders underneath. Capitalist

society is a battleground and the workers are an army on. the _

march against the enemy.

He who says then that there is unity of interests between employ- ,

ers and employees is committing treason to the working class.
Needless to say, the State is not “neutral”. At best the State only

pretends to be a friend of the workers. Under the N.R.A. you are .

told you have equal rights with your employers and that the State
is in partnership with both. The truth of this statement is re-
vealed by the fact that numerous strikes, of the miners, steel work-
ers, auto workers, marine workers, textile workers, and others, were
crushed by the government in league with the leaders of the A. F.

of L. The truth of this statement is revealed in the shooting and -

killing of pickets in Philadelphia, in the calling out of militia with
artillery and machine guns against the striking miners in New
Mexico and Utah, in the introducing of martial law in the South
during the great textile strike of 1934, in the reign of police terror
during the marine strike in San Francisco, in innumerable injunc-
tions against picketing. When'a labor leader of the reformist type
tries to persuade the workers that the State is equally fair to em-
ployer and employee, he is blinding the workers and undermining
their resistance.

This is exactly what those “labor leaders” have been doing for '

many years. They have been preventing the workers from realizing
their own strength. They have discouraged many a strike which
broke out spontaneously because the workers could stand their con-

ditions no longer. Wherever these leaders call a strike because they ‘
are forced to do so by the militant spirit of the rank and file, they ‘
do it reluctantly and with no real ﬁghting spirit. Instead of broad- V

ening the strike, calling out neighboring industrial establishments

and spreading the struggle over a wide area, instead of ﬁring the.
strikers with conﬁdence, with enthusiasm, with a consciousness of-
their strength, the leaders most often smother the movement by-
underhand machinations with the bosses. Wherever a real strike A

with a true militant spirit developed, of late, it was under rank-

and-ﬁle leadership and in deﬁance of the reformist top leaders. _
The latter are happy when they succeed in putting an end to the .

militant struggle and in getting arbitrators to step in.

And who are the arbitrators called to decide the issues affecting T

the lives of the workers? As often as not the board of arbitration
is composed of an equal number of representatives from the work-
ers and the employer. Those who represent the employer know very
well how to defend his capitalist interests. The reformist leaders

who represent the workers do not ﬁght for the interests of the.

workers with a ﬁrm hand, because that can be done only when the

workers’ side at the conference table is reinforced by a mighty strug-
gle outside. The reformist representatives at the conference table do
not act as ﬁghting representatives of workers facing the enemy. They
wish to please——the bosses. At best they try meek persuasion. A usual
method with them is to plead with the bosses on the grounds that
the workers will “get out of hand”: Often they are interested in
their own private advantage rather than in the welfare of those
whom they are supposed to represent. These two “parties” to the
“clispute” agree on an “impartial” chairman who is to decide be-
tween them. The impartial chairman is either a lawyer-or a capital-
‘ist politician. Under the N.R.A. the “arbitrator” ‘is often a blue
eagle State agent, which is often worse than an “impartial” chairman.
The fate of the workers is left in the hands of people who belong
to the enemy class. '

M . Nor is that all. Under the NRA. thereformist leaders have
“been incorporated into the administration as members of the in-
iinumerable advisory boards. Their task is to please the government
rather than serve the workers. And there is no fundamental differ-
-ence in this respect between reformists belonging to the Republican
or Democratic parties and the reformists belonging to the Socialist
Party. William Green or John Lewis, Matthew Woll or David
»,Dubinsky, Edward McCrady (now raised to the post of Assistant
Secretary of Labor for his good services to the bosses) or Sidney
iHillman—no matter how different their coloring may be, they are
(all birds of a feather. T

They claim to be pure and simple unionists and their slogan is

’ re steeped in politics. They are mixed up with the State. They
‘are part and parcel of the machinery of the State. They are not free
«*of politics; they are only engaged in rotten politics, in capitalistic
Jspolitics, in politics that tend to "bind the workers hand and foot.
‘ ‘We Communists look upon the labor union as upon the front-
‘trench organization of the working class. It is this organization
‘through which the workers directly confront the employers in the
struggle for better conditions. The union cannot do away with
‘exploitation, for exploitation will disappear only with capitalism
'tself. But the union can improve the conditions of the workers—
-[to a degree. The union -is the organization that ﬁghts for the
interests of the workers at the very source of exploitation. Its
place is in the shop, facing the employer. It must be on the
alert. The employer is always ready with new schemes to squeeze
’ reater surplus value out of the workers. He is assisted by all
_sorts of advisers. He never lets up.. He will even go as far as
-‘to assure you that your own standard of living won’t' be reduced
if only you allow him greater proﬁts. He will complain bitterly that
your “unreasonable” demands may force him to close his business.
. 36 -

 

 
 

y“No politics in the labor movement”. What a lie! They themselves,

r:‘—'.;<-‘

To meet all these machinations you need a union. that is wide-awake, -,

ﬂexible, and has great ﬁghting power. Such a union trains the
workers for the ﬁnal clash with capitalism to abolish it altogether.

The strength of the union is in its closeness to the workers, in its
responsiveness to all their grievances in the shop, in its ability to
communicate with the rank and ﬁle on short notice. For this pur-
pose, shop committees must be elected by the workers of every shop.
The shop committee must represent the workers of a given produc-
tion unit and be under their control. The unions must be built on

the basis of the shop committees. The unions must be under the'

closest control of the shop committees.

When we Communists speak of ﬁghting we do not always mean
the strike. We mean the defense of the interests of the workers in
every instance and in every possible way. If the workers are
organized, they can bring pressure to bear upon the “office” against
every encroachment on the workers’ rights. If the workers are a
power, the voice of their representatives has weight. This power

must always be felt. It is therefore necessary that all the workers »

of the shop understand their class interests, understand the meaning

of unionism, and are ready to back up their shop committee. Ob- _

viously, the union. must be more than a dues-collecting apparatus.

- The union must be alive and functioning every hour of the day. It

must have the rank-and-ﬁle spirit. It must have knowledge of every‘
detail of the situation. And it must have guts.

When the workers go on strike, the employers summon all their
forces, including the State. They use every means to demoralize
and split the strikers’ ranks. The workers must summon all-their

forces. The efforts of, the bosses can be defeated only by a union

which is capable of bringing out the strikers’ ﬁghting spirit, only
where there is a militant rank-and-ﬁle ‘leadership close to the masses
and sharing the life’ of the masses. .

It is for such a militant spirit and for such leadership that we
Communists are ﬁghting in the labor unions. And it is just for this
that the reformist leaders call us “disru ters”, “‘irres onsible ele-

ments an e s .

We understand why the reformist leaders are dead set against 

We see through them and we tell the workers the truth. Wherever
we are we organize the workers; we help organize the union; we try
to enlighten the workers as to their class interests. Many reformist
leaders shun the word “class”. They favor class collaboration, col-

laboration with the employers. Therefore, they do not want the ,
workers to look upon themselves as a class, to understand that their.

class interests cannot be reconciled with those of the bosses. We try

to develop class consciousness, class militancy, class pride. They

call us disrupters; but what we disrupt is the unity between some

reformist leaders and the bosses. They call us irresponsible, but

the responsibility we reject is responsibility for the bosses’ proﬁts.
Also, we have no ‘fear of bosses. We say that the workers can be
stronger than the bosses, if only they are organized and conscious.
We saythat even the powerful Steel Trust can be forced to yield
concessions to the workers if they organize their strength.

Next to the union struggle and closely related to it is the struggle
for unemployment and social insurance. There are about 17,000,000
unemployed at the present time. This vicious system has excluded
them from production, although all the goods accumulated in
this country are the fruit of their labor. They are entitled to all
the wealth. They insist on their right to live. The capitalists have
all along opposed the enactment of any social-insurance legislation.

'Now, however, in the face of the persistent and determined struggle

for unemployment insurance, they are scheming to put over a sham
social insurance which guarantees no human existence. The Wagner-
Lewis Bill leaves out completely the 17,000,000 at present unem-
ployed. It speaks only in terms of future unemployed. The Bill
leaves the States free to introduce or evade unemployment insurance.
Where introduced, the insurance funds will not accumulate before
three years after the law is enacted. The majority of State Legisla-
tures close in April or May and will not reopen this year (1935).
At best they could pass insurance laws in 1936. The system then
will begin to pay beneﬁts only around _1939——and even then the
payments will be meagre and only for part of the year and will
cease as" soon as the funds are exhausted. That the funds will rapidly
be exhausted is clear from the fact that wages are low and that the
funds are only a small percentage of the very low wages.

As to those who are unemployed today, the government does not
oifer them any‘ security whatever. Public works are supposed to be
organized by the government, but they areonly temporary; they do
not pay a living wage, and they absorb only a small fraction of the
unemployed. Late in 1934- Roosevelt promised to put three and a
half million workers on relief jobs. This ﬁgure was obviously ex-
aggerated—for publicity purposes. But even so, what is to become
of the other thirteen and a half millions? Figures officially pub-

.lished in the early spring of 1935 showed that there were 2,664,000

persons in need of aid in the City of New York. Fully one half of
them received no aid. What is to become of these? How shall they
live? Needless to mention that even those receiving relief cannot
live a half-way decent human life.

As against this the Communist Party initiated the Workers Un-
employment, Old Age, and Social Insurance Bill, which was in-
troduced in Congress by Congressman Lundeen. This bill, known
as House Resolution 2827, provides real insurance. It calls for com-
pensation, in an amount equal to average wages, to all unemployed.
The moneys are to be raised by taxing incomes, inheritances, and

  

 

 

l



 

 

gifts of $5,000 and over, and by curtailing unproductive appropria-
tions, like those for the army and navy and other militaristic and

imperialistic ventures. The funds thus formed are to be -adminis- *

-tered by the workers themselves.

Not only has the Communist Party created this real social in-
surance plan, but it has mobilized large masses of workers, farmers,
professionals, and small businessmen to ﬁght for the bill. The
Communist Party was instrumental in calling the great Labor Con-
gress in Washington (Jan. 5-7, 1935) that put all its weight behind
the social insurance bill. It made this country aware of the urgent r
need for unemployment insurance. It mobilized wide support for
this bill among the rank and ﬁle of the A. F. of L., winning endorse-
ment of a vast number of local unions, as well as a number of central
bodies and international conventions, in the face of persistent opposi-
tion of the top leadership of the A. F. of L.

Wherever some relief was introduced, this was done as a result
of numerous struggles led by the Communist Party. The Com-
munists were instrumental in organizingthe Unemployment Coun-
cils which, together with other workers, fought for every crumb of
bread for every unemployed.

2.‘ THE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPER1ALIs'r'WAR

War is inseparable from the capitalist system. The Great War
of 1914-18 was fought for the redivision of the world. During the
sixteen years after the conclusion of the first imperialist war all the
contradictions of capitalism have become much sharper than they

‘ were prior to 1914. More rivalries among nations, more armaments,

greater international tension, sharper conﬂicts, as the conflict be-
tween the U. S. A. and Great Britain (“the war of the dollar against
the pound”) . In the last couple of years Nazi.Cermany has loomed
as the greatest menace to the peace of Europe. Hitler’s open declara-
tion of organizing a new conscript army, a military air ﬂeet, and a
large navy has made the war danger more acute. War may become
a fact almost any hour. War appears to the capitalists as a way out
of the crisis. War is a great feast for the robbers. It means huge
war orders, an orgy of speculation, an accumulation of unheard-of
fortunes, and this may look like the overcoming of the crisis, tem-
porarily at least. War offers to the capitalists the prospect, or at
least the hope, of victory over the other imperialist powers and in
consequence gigantic indemnities, seizure of territories, extension of
colonial possessions, and otherwise an increase of markets, spheres
of inﬂuence and other gains. War, to be sure, means squanderingi
the wealth and the man powerof the nations; it means actual devas-

tation of provinces and countries and death for great masses of the

, people; but these “costs of war” have never deterred the capitalists
.,from plunging the countries into that bloody mess.

Witness the dismal failure of all the so-called international con-
ferences to settle disputes among the imperialist nations. Not only
‘ have all the conferences of the last years ended in ﬁasco, but they
. have actually led to a sharpening of all contradictions‘ that rend the
capitalist world asunder.

There was the Lausanne Conference where the greatest European
imperialist powers tried to settle the reparations problem. It seemed
to be settled, but.the settlement was shipwrecked on the rocks of
America’s refusal to yield on the question of war debts. The Lau-
‘ sanne agreement has remained suspended in the air. 1
1 There was the question of Manchuria, invaded by Japan. The
League of Nations made the gesture of trying to settle the dispute.
‘It sent the Lytton Commission to study the problem. In reply Japan
quit the League of Nations. War in the Far East has not stopped
for over two years. Japan is making ever new encroachments on
Jehol Province, on Mongolia, and practically establishing its pro-
’ tectorate over China. '

- The Geneva Conference met for months and months. It was sup-
posed to reach a disarmament agreement. The result is an increase

only one class of industries that is prospering in the capitalist coun-
tries: war industries. Naval armaments are making tremendous
, progress. Swanson, the Secretary of the Navy, advanced the “sec-
'fond-to-none” program‘for the American navy. This program is

J the imperialists of Great Britain have replied with a gigantic naval.
"construction plan. , There is a race of armaments between the French
and Italian imperialists.

,' The World Economic Conference was a total failure. The result
is a sharpening of all international rivalries. “Economic national-
ism”, promulgated by the leading imperialist nations, is a method
of economic warfare; at the same time it is a method of preparing
the economic system of the imperialist countries for the coming
armed conﬂict. Never has the question of markets for the capitalist
countries been as acute as it is at present. The question of markets
_is nothing but the question of redividing the globe among the im-
9 perialist nations. And that means war.

-The forces that produce war are more powerful in 1935 than they
were in 1913. The only country that stands for peace and that tried
to promote a program of peace, disarmament and unhampered world
economic intercourse in Geneva and London is the Soviet Union. .
War" against the Soviet Union is a fundamental policy of capital-
.ism. Between 1917 and 1922, the ,U.S.A., England, France, and

armies of intervention into the Soviet territory and they ﬁnanced‘
the counter-revolutionary generals that were trying to overthrow the
new workers’ rule. When intervention and counter-revolution col-
lapsed before the irresistible onslaught of the workers and peasants
organized in the Red Army under the leadership of the Bolshevik
(Communist) Party, and the foreign armies had to be withdrawn,
there began the economic war against the Soviet Union. This war
continues to the present day. But notthis alone. There have been
innumerable attempts at military intervention. In 1929,lan army-
was actually sent into Eastern Siberia through the- Manchurian war-
lord, but this attempt was frustrated by the quick and decisive action
of the Red Army. Over and over again Soviet embassies and trade
missions in the capitalist countries have been raided and Soviet rep-
resentatives imprisoned. Over and over again officially sponsored‘
campaigns were conducted in the capitalist countries against the
Soviet Union. The Fish Committee is still fresh in the workers"
minds. It was a Congressional committee supposed to investigate
Communism in the United States. It did not investigate Commu-—'
nism; it made no attempt to study Communism as a social phe-
nomenon. Instead it made it its speciﬁc business to disseminate th
most malicious propaganda against the Soviet Union. Nor was the‘
Congress of the United States alone guilty‘ of fabricating insidious"
lies against the Workers’ Republic. Cabinet members and politi-_
cians in high standing degraded themselves by spreading tales about.
Soviet “dumping”. The “forced labor” story was widely circulated
and made the basis for discrimination against Soviet imports. ‘

In the autumn of 1933 this government recognized the Soviet
Union. For a while the attitude of open official hostility to the
Soviet Union was toned down. Negotiations were begun for credit?
extension to the Soviet Government. Soon, however, the government‘:
of the U.S.A.~ began to “cool off”. A campaign of unprecedented
malice against the Soviet Union was unleashed by the Hearst press.
Red-baiting, with a view to “Moscow”, was undertaken by a Congres-
sional committee headed by Dickstein and McCormack, which was
ostensibly set up to investigate fascism. Debt negotiations were
abruptly terminated. The US. Government recalled its military
attaché from Moscow. -

Whether openly hostile or pretending oﬂicial “friendship”
whether recognizing the Soviet Union, as this was ﬁnally done also
by the U.S.A., or stubbornly refusing recognition; whether conclud-
ing non-aggression pacts or severing commercial treaties or even
severing diplomatic relations, the attitude of the imperialist coun-
tries towards the Soviet Union remains that of an enemy camp. There
is not a secret confab of the imperialist powers in which conspiracies’-3
against the Workers’ Republic areunot hatched. ' »

 

   

 

   

ROOSEVELT AND WAR

We live in an atmosphere of imminent war. All national policies
are now directed_ towards the preparation for war. What are these
so-called conservation camps if not training grounds for the future
army to be used in the war? What is this militarization of the
schools and colleges if not preparation for war? What are these
numerous “war games” on the water and in the air, on the land and
in the sea if not preparations for war? What is this mobilization
of the industries of the United States, with administrators ready in

W 7 every section, with a machinery so timed as to make it possible to

put the whole country on a war basisvwithin a few hours? What

are these repeated declarations by cabinet members that the navy

was needed for the purpose of “expanding American commerce”?
‘What is this modernization of the army, modernization of battle-
ships, and the huge increase in the aerial forces of the United States,
if not preparation for war?

Roosevelt’s government is a war government. And it is in order
to screen these war preparations from the public view for a while
that paciﬁst phrases are used. Roosevelt talking of world peace!

T Socialist leaders applauding, trying to make the people believe that
Roosevelt is an angel of.peace. Reformist union leaders singing in-

unison with Roosevelt’s apostles of peace. A mutual admiration
society for laying a smoke screen. Gabriel over the White House.

-While this hosannah is being sung the munitions plants are working

overtime; poison gas is manufactured in huge quantities; tanks and
armored cars are turned out by the thousand; dozens of new formi-
dable battleships are being feverishly constructed to make the navy
“second to none”; a large part of the public works appropriations is
turned to military purposes; seven hundred thousand youths are
being drilled in the “conservation camps” under army oﬂicers; a
militarist, propaganda under the slogan, “Stand behind the Presi-

-dent”, is in full swing and reminds one of war time under Wilson;

plants that do not at present work for the war are mobilized to begin
such work at a moment’s notice; and the entire war machinery is
being perfected by the application of the latest inventions. The ad-
ministration of the NRA. is backed by the war industries and ad-
ministered by leading war-mongers. The N.R.A. has the slaughter-
ing industry uppermost in mind. The N .R.A. means war. R
Here as elsewhere we Communists remain political realists. We

v say to the workers, Words are chaff; they mean nothing; they mean

less than nothing; deeds count. The deeds of the Roosevelt govern-
ment are war deeds.
We say the workers must ﬁght against war. The workers must

' realize that war is against their interests. There is only one war

that is just—and that is the war of an oppressed class for its libera-
42

tion or the war of an oppressed nationality for its independence.
All other wars are predatory wars. Wars of imperialist powers
among themselves or against the Soviet Union, wars for the seizure
of territories or the securing of colonies are wars for the proﬁts of
the exploiters, but they are fought with the bodies of the workers
and farmers. The workers and farmers must resist. We cannot stop

.war altogether. It is not possible to prevent the coming of war as

long as capitalism lasts. However, war can be postponed. We can
hold a threat over the heads of the ruling class preventing them at
least for a while from plunging us into the carnage. The time ele-
ment counts. Workers’ organizations. may grow in the meantime.
The Soviet Union may increase its power. The working class may
become a greater factor internationally, forcing the governments
to refrain from immediately carrying out their war plans.

The ﬁght against the war danger is a political ﬁght. The working
class must be aroused. There must be protest meetings, mass peti-
tions, demonstrations, strikes. The powers that he must be given

to understand in an unmistakable way that the workers and farmers

are dead set against war. This spirit must be communicated to the
army. ‘

If this ﬁght has been carried on with suﬂicient determination, the
ground is prepared for action when war comes. The workers do not
realize that it is in their power to postpone war. It is. Workers in
ammunition plants, go on strike! Shut down your plants! Prevent
governmental strike-breakers from resuming work! Railroad men,
refuse to handle war materials or to transport troops! Keep guard
over your railroad yards and depots lest transportation facilities be
used by governmental agents. Marine workers, do not load either
men or ammunition! Truck drivers, refuse to assist in war work!
Workers of other industries,_help the strikers. Farmers, refuse to
give your foodstuffs and raw materials to be used for the slaughter!

If the workers rise in this way against war, the capitalists with
their armed forces will try to break the deadlock. There will be
attacks on strikers. The workers will have to offer resistance. We
Communists do not close our eyes to the fact that this means civil
war. But when the masses are organized and fight in great numbers
under revolutionary leadership the victory is assured. Part of .the
army is certain to waver and to join the people. There may be vic-
tims, but their number can not be compared to the losses in life and
limb that the workers would suffer in the imperialist war.

Victory in the civil war spells the doom of the capitalist State.

We Communists do not say to the workers that they have to begin

the civil war today or tomorrow. We say that the civil war is the ‘

inevitable outcome of long and arduous struggles against the capital-
ists and their State and that these struggles must be made the every-

day practice of the working class.
' 43

  

3. THE STRUGGLE AGAINST FAsc1sM

. We have mentioned above that the capitalist State changes its
‘form and tactics in accordance with the interests of the ruling class.
«When social conditions are more or less stable, when no great mass
 movements threaten to overthrow the rule of the owners of wealth,
9 the State allows itself to appear democratic. You are told then that
_ “the people” are the actual rulers of the land.

But even when the State appears in its democratic guise it is
. democracy for the owners of wealth and a dictatorship over the
masses. The system in the United States is a democracy for the
Morgans and Mellons, the Rockefellers and the Fords, and every-
body that “counts” inasmuch as it carries out their will. But what
' about the striking. miners that are being gassed? What about
._ the hunger marchers that are being clubbed? What about the tex-
“atile workers that are being shot down in cold blood? What
about the milk strikers that are being surrounded by squads of
;. deputy sheriffs, beaten and jailed? What about the legal weapon
of injunctions used against strikers ﬁghting for a bigger crust of
 bread? What about those numberless cases of workers’ blood spilled
for the sole reason that they are trying to defend their right to live?
' Democracy for the rulers, dictatorship over the workers; terror,
., legal or extra-legal, is always used against the workers even where
"i _ the semblance of democracy is preserved.

‘ This semblance, however, is easily and eagerly removed whenever
it suits the interests of the rulers. The system prevailing in the
1, U.S.A. at the present time hardly deserves the name democracy.
7 Government is increasingly becoming a one-man affair. Congress
_;’ is ceding its prerogatives of law-making to Roosevelt, who is a
virtual dictator, acting through a number of boards appointed by
him. All this vast economic legislation that has been introduced
._now is not of Congressional origin and has not received Congres-
sional approval. In foreign policies Congress has long become
:.7nothing but a rubber stamp, while the treaty power is in the hands
' of the President and his advisers. There was once prevalent in
1- _America the theory of the “balance of power” between the legis-
‘lative, judicial, and executive branches of the government. It is
no accident that the executive branch has gained ascendancy over
the rest. This is in keeping with the interests of Wall Street. It
-_ assures quick action. It makes for quiet “deals” away from the
glaring light of publicity. It makes it unnecessary to dicker with

 their electors (although by and large it has not been difficult for
ff. Wall Street to keep Congress in line). It _clears the ground for
 further developments along the road of an open dictatorship.

dictatorship for the primary purpose of crushing the revolutionary‘
labor movement that threatens capitalist rule and for the purpose‘
of fusing the State with big business in order to prolong the existence-
of capitalism, there we have fascism. Fascism is brute force against
a rising working class which begins to challenge the capitalist power.-
Fascism at the same time attempts to organize industry and com-
merce on behalf of the owners of wealth. The iron hand that is used
against the workers and poor farmers is aimed to force them to
accept lower wages and worsened working conditions in order thu

to secure greater proﬁts for the employers. Government regulation
of industry and commerce, government subsidies and aid from the
treasury, i. e., from the taxes squeezed out of the masses of the popui
lation, also have ‘the purpose of increasing the proﬁts of the great
industrialists and bankers. Fascism is a form of government which
reduces. the overwhelming majority of the population to abject pov-.._'
erty and degradation’ so that a few heads of large corporations may

Fascism is a form of capitalist rule designed to save the systemlf
of exploitation for the big exploiters. But it uses for its purpose
large numbers, masses of the harassed middle class, sections of th .
peasantry, and even some backward elements of the working class,‘
particularly those that have not gone through the school of produc-'3
tive industrial work. The crisis of capitalism hits hard the small;
owner, who begins to despair. ' The same crisis creates numbers of;
young sons and daughters of workers who never have a chance to’,
work and thus practically become declassed. All these elements
are greatly dissatisfied, but they do not have the class feeling, the?
organization and the experience of the industrial workers. They. are;
an easy prey to illusions. They hope for political miracles to hap-7
pen. They are inclined to put their faith, not in concerted mas
action, but in the leadership of some individual whom they believe.
to be great. It is to these masses that fascism comes with its anti-.

something like a “share-the-wealth” program,.conﬁscation of large» .
incomes, nationalization of department stores, etc. ' It promises to;
abolish poverty without abolishing the capitalist system. At the,
same time it hides from these masses the real cause of their misery ;;
instead, it chooses some scapegoat, like the Jews or other minorities,
to put on them the blame for everything evil that capitalism brough
to the people. Social ciemagogy and rabid nationalism are the two
main instruments of fascism to beguile those strata of the popula--
tion that are being crushed by large-scale capital in the course of the
deepening crisis. Rabid nationalism includes not only persecution
of national minorities and hatred for all other nations but, in the
ﬁrst place, it serves to cover up the class differences and to let loose
an unbridled national aggressiveness. Let our nation become
45

   

 

 

strong, says fascism, let it have the greatest possible army and navy;
let it take the place under the sun that belongs to\ such a chosen

~nation——by war preferably—and all the difficulties will disappear,

and everybody will be happy—“every man a king”, according to
Huey Long.

From this it is quite obvious that the difference between the rule
of capitalist democracy and the rule of fascism is a difference in

. form and method, not in principle. The principle remains the same:
'3 serving the interests of the owners of wealth. The foundation of
society remains the same: private ownership and exploitation. The

fascist regime is the open dictatorship of the capitalist class, the
terrorist dictatorship, with the veil of democracy cast away. We

[Communists value the democratic rights which the workers have won

-——as a consequence of incessant struggle——under capitalist democ-
racy. We are ready to defend these rights. We strive to bring about
united working-class action to defend these rights. But we realize
that capitalist democracy is the disguised dictatorship of the capital-

.ist class, that there is no fundamental difference, no difference in

substance, between capitalist democracy and fascism.
Here, as elsewhere, the Communists have a clear understanding

of the social forces, whereas the Socialist leaders spread illusions

and pursue policies which weaken and disarm the workers. The
Socialist leaders put all their hopes in capitalist democracy.‘ In
their eyes it is the open road to the peaceful introduction of Social-
ism. They reject the warning of the Communists that the capitalist
class will ﬁght to the bitter end to retain power. They carry on
class-collaboration policies. And even when they see capitalist
democracy crumbling under the pressure of the crisis of the capital-
ist system, when they are confronted with the menace of rising
fascism, when they see capitalism preparing to replace its demo-

cratically-gloved iron hand by the openly brutal fascist fist, they

still persist in their class-collaboration policies and refuse to pre-
pare the workers for the unavoidable struggle. They place every
possible obstacle in the way of the united front fought for by the
Communists. Not only that, they rush frantically to unite with
capitalist groups who profess opposition to the open fascist move-
ment but proceed, with the support of the Socialist leaders, to intro-
duce measures of fascism. This united front with capitalist groups

 the Socialist leaders call “choosing the ‘lesser evil’ ”.

Thus, in Germany they supported Hindenburg against Hitler
rather than support the working class revolutionary movement
against both Hindenburg and Hitler. Thus, in Austria they sup-
ported the fascism of Dollfuss against the Naziism of Hitler Ger-
many. In this ‘way they broke the unity of the workers, disarmed
them in face of the enemy, sought to persuade the working- class even

’ to support its bitterest foes. In this way they made fascism in Ger-
46

 

 

 

 

 

many and Austria possible. And this is why we Communists say
that the road to fascism was paved by the Social-Democratic leaders.

Do not be surprised if you see Social-Democracy persecuted by
fascism. When capitalism dispenses with the democratic form. of
government it has no use anymore for its Social-Democratic maid-

 

servants as an agency for spreading democratic illusions. Besides,

the fascist rulers are very much afraid of the Social-Democratic
rank-and-ﬁle workers, who, they rightly see, are eager for common
revolutionary action with the Communists against capitalism.
Here in the U.S.A. we have no full-ﬂedged fascism as yet. But
the elements of it are fast growing before ‘our very eyes. Those
attempts to prevent workers from striking; those N.R.A. codes sup-

. posed to organize industry and commerce by State regulation; that

“partnership” between government and industry and government
and labor that has been proclaimed as the policy of the Roosevelt

administration; that reign of terror that is sweeping the strike areas A4

of the country-——what is it if not the manifestation of fascist tenden-

cies? That dictatorship of one man so-eagerly acquiesced in by '

everybody, except, of course, the revolutionary workers—what is
it if not something very much akin to fascism? That propaganda
of super-nationalism which comes from high places in Washington,
especially after the collapse of the London conference, is it not
reminiscent of fascist tactics? We certainly have a fascization of
the governmental apparatus, and there is being developed an at-
mosphere where fascism may quickly become the order of the day.

Outside of all sorts of “shirted” secret organizations, like the
Silver Shirts, the Crusaders, etc., we have three large centers of

fascist propaganda, headed by William Hearst, Father Coughlin, if

Huey Long. Hearst is poisoning millions of people every day with

pro-Hitler, pro-Mussolini, pro-fascist and anti-Soviet propaganda‘

of the most pernicious and unscrupulous kind. Father Coughlin,
the “radio priest”, has won tremendous popularity through his
advocacy of “social justice” and his apparent opposition to Wall
Street. Huey Long has become a power due to his fascist domina-
tion of the State of Louisiana and his “share-the-wealth” plan. This
trio may some day shape the destinies of the U.S.—if the masses
are not on the alert.

It should be remembered that from the very beginning of the New
Deal we Communists warned against the menace of fascism inherent
in it while the leaders of the A. F. of L. and the leaders of the Social-
ist Party hailed it as a “new charter for Labor”, “a step in the
direction of Socialism”, etc. - Even today many of these leaders
still maintain their faith in the NBA. and in Rooseve-lt’s democracy
as opposed to fascism.

How can we recognize the fascist nature of such gentry as the
Coughlins, Longs, and their ilk? Here are a few signs. They all

between 1923 and 1933: they are preparing the ground and per-
Tfecting the organization of ‘fascism “made in USA.” .

The ﬁght against fascism in all its manifestations is one of the
fundamental tasks of the American workers. The united front of
struggle to stem the rising tide of fascism is ‘of vital historic im-
portance. Fascism can be crushed if all those opposed to it unite
to form one mighty force and if they ﬁght it day in and day out.
The experience of the united front.-in France proves this conclusively.

THE NEGRO PEOPLE

One of the major policies of American capitalismis the oppres-
sion of the Negro people.

There are about 12 million Negroes in the United States, accord-
ing to the official census, but it is commonly believed their number

Those living in the North are mostly concentrated in industrial
centers and a few large cities. Thus New York has a Negro popula-
tion of 328,000;'Chicago, 234,000; Philadelphia, 222,000. New
Orleans, Baltimore and Washington have about 130,000 each. This
great population of colored Americans suffers under a system of
oppression more vicious and cruel than any known in modern times.

Over seventy years ago the chains of chattel slavery that crushed
the Negroes were supposed to be lifted. As a matter of fact, the
chains of ‘slavery still cut into the very Vitals of the Negro people.

The overwhelming majority of the Negroes are either workers
,4, or farmers. In the South they are mostly tenant farmers and share-
croppers, and over them the white landlord rules supreme. When
\ the landlord sells his land he sells it together with those who work
" on it as he used to do under chattel slavery. When the Negro tenant

necessities on credit—and he must do so since he is poverty-stricken 1
—he pays exorbitant interest, sometimes as much as 37 per cent per 0
annum, and his debt binds him to the farm. When as debtor he‘
tries to leave the farm, he is arrested and put into the chain gang
unless “bought out” by his landlord or another white boss. He
works himself to death for the owner of ‘the land. It was estimated
that even before the present crisis 7,000,000 Negro people in the
South lived on an income of less than $5 per week per family, and .
of these, 3,000,000 lived on an income of only $3 a week per family.
During the crisis the situation of the Negro masses has grown worse.

In the industrial centers both of the North and of the South, the '0
Negro workers receive less pay for the same Work as white workers, ‘_
and they are treated worse. In the large cities of the North, as well
as of the South, they are segregated in special ghettoes, where they 5"
pay more for crowded and unsanitary rooms. The reformist unions 0'
refuse to organize the Negro workers; many unions of the A. F. of L ‘
would not admit Negro. workers at all, and others admit them only

 

cluded from relief and, when relief is granted, they receive less than -._.
even their white brothers, although unemployment has been much"
more severe among Negro than among white workers. Under the
NRA. thousands of white bosses have discharged their Negro work _
ers to replace them by whites, whose work was by no means superior 
to that of the Negroes.

The striving of the Negro masses towards education is being ham
pered by the white ruling class. There are fewer schools for the
Negro children and fewer educational institutions for the youth
Negro intellectuals, physicians, scientists, educators, lawyers, as -a
rule are barred from practising among the white population and ,3}
are discriminated against in a thousand other ways. Even the Negro 1,
business man has .to contend with obstacles and barriers, legal and ‘
otherwise, unknown to the white members of his class. At every step‘.
the Negro meets with a barbed wire fence blocking his progress.

All this economic oppression is accompanied by a system of -.

 

prevailing before the Civil War. The Southern Negro is almost en-
tirely deprived of the vote. The Jim-Crow laws make his existence
intolerable. A vicious propaganda is conducted by the white ruling "
class against the Negroes, branding them as an “inferior race”. .1
"This whole structure of oppression is backed up by the special’: ;.
weapon of the American white ruling class—lynching.
We Communists declare that the cause of Negro liberation is the :-
cause of all the white toilers, in the ﬁrst place that of the working’
class. We take it as self-evident truth that every nation is entitled to ..

ority” was purposely invented by the exploiters to justify their op-
49 p A p '

 

pression of other nations. We proclaim that the American Negroes

are a nation and that Land, Freedom and Equality, the demands that
glowed on the banner of the ﬁghting Negroes during the CiVil_ War
and Reconstruction,’ must be the watchword of the struggle for Negro
liberation today. By this is meant—that the plantation system in the

South should be destroyed; the land should be divided among the _
_ Negro farmers, croppers and tenants; full economic, political, and

social equality should be guaranteed for the Negroes in every section
of the country, and that the Negro people be given full freedom to

T. develop unhampered as a nation.
. To those acquainted with the national problem there is nothing ,
‘unusual in this idea of the Negroes in the United States being a

nation. What traits distinguish a nation? Stalih, the man who not
only made a profound study of the national problem, but was in-
strumental in liberating the many nationalities that groaned under
Czarism in Russia, enumerates the following features of a nation:
A nation, he said, is “an historically developed community of
people with a common language, territory, economic life and an
historical tradition reﬂecting itself in a commonculture”. 4
All these traits we ﬁnd combined in the Negro people. They
certainly are an historically developed community of people. They
have a common language; they are bound together by a common
economic life; they have historical traditions that are different from
the traditions of other Americans; they are developing a culture

 all their own. All this must be granted by every observer.

As to territory, there is a continuous stretch of land running from
the eastern shore of Maryland down into Texas through twelve

4 States, and embracing about 397 counties, in which the Negroes

form the majority of the population. This territory, commonly
known as the Black Belt, is the homeland of the Negroes. They have

-tilled that land virtually from the time it was first settled. It is

one economic unit since it is identical with the old cotton-belt of

l the South. It is there where '70 years ago the Negro masses valiantly

fought for their liberation. It is there where today they have begun
to battle for the new freedom. This new freedom we call National

’ Self-Determination.

Every nation has a right to live its own life, independent of other
nations. Together with the most advanced and courageous ﬁghters

: among the Negroes We Communists say that this territory, this Black

Belt, which by rightbelongs to the Negroes, must be organized as -a
distinct political unit regardless of state lines that now out across it.
In this political unit the Negro majority must have full governmental
control, which means the right to set up a government and to organ-

. ize armed forces to defend their rights. This does not mean ex-
cluding and discriminating against the white toilers now living in

this territory. On‘ the contrary, they will have equal rights with
' 50

   

 

 

the Negroes and therefore more freedom than they have ever enjoyed
under the dictatorship of the white ruling class. The governments
andpthe armed forces of the white ruling class ‘must be removed
from the Black Belt. ‘

This demand may be new to many American Workers. Yet it is
simple justice. It is in line with the general demand for the libera-
tion of all oppressed nationalities everywhere in the world. The
white workers in the South will ﬁght for this demand of the Negro
people for this will be the only way they will be able to destroy
the power of the ruling class.

American capitalism is oppressing not only the Negro people,

although their oppression is the worst. American capitalism op- M

presses also a number of colonial and semi-colonial peoples, like
those of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Cuba and many others.
Wall Street capitalists are taking the cream off these countries,
leaving the workers and poor farmers in servitude and starvation.

HOW THE FIGHTING IS To BE DONE

We Communists say it is the ‘duty of the workers to ﬁght against
capitalist terror, against manifestations of fascism, against the op-

pression of other nations. We say it is in their interests to ﬁght. -

We appeal to the class interests of the workers and the exploited
masses of the population. Stand guard. Offer resistance to capital-
ist terror. Fight for your right to organize, to assemble, to strike.
Break the capitalist dictatorial rules directed against you. Do not
submit. Strike back. In unity is your strength.

Freedom must be fought for and this ﬁght cannot wait. It is a
matter requiring action right now and every day. Your employers
try to prevent you from organizing: organize. They will try to ﬁre
your organizers: stand pat, defend them! They will try to discharge
more: answer by calling a strike: picket the plant! They will send
policemen and hired deputies to break up your picket line: stand
ﬁrm, don’t yield! They will send a reformist union leader to per-
suade you to accept boss arbitration: drive him out like a yellow
curl They will put some of your leaders in jail: demonstrate, pro-
test, ﬁll the court room. with hundreds of workers, demand the
release of your comrades, picket the court house, picket the judge’s

house, call other workers to help you in your struggle; make your '

struggle the struggle of great numbers of class conscious workers!

Your masters send marines against a" Latin-American country as ‘

was recently done against Cuba, when 29 warships were mobilized
to crush the workers’ and farmers’ revolution. Your masters always
aid the local exploiters against whom the masses have risen. Their
aim is to maintain in the Latin-American countries a puppet govern-
ment, submissive to Wall Street, because Wall- Street is getting hun-
- 51

 

     

dreds of millions out of the toil of the local masses. Remember that
you cannot be free as long as the colonial and semi-colonial masses
are oppressed. Remember it is the same enemy you are ﬁghting and
the same struggle will liberate all of you. The workers have to
ﬁght against every step of American imperialism, extending a

brotherly hand of aid to the peoples of the oppressed countries.

The chains of slavery that cut into the Negro people are cutting
also into the very heart of the white workers and farmers. The great
working class leader, Karl Marx, once said: “Labor with a white
skin cannot emancipate itself whereelabor with a black skin is
branded”. Your masters trample the Negroes to the ground in order
to lower not only the standards of living of the colored masses but
also those of the white workers and farmers as well. If the bosses
succeed in crushing one section of the working class that is black they
can more easily crush the other section that is white. By oppressing
the Negroes the bosses wish to make you weak; by uniting with
the Negroes the white workers can make themselves strong. There
is a great ﬁghting spirit among the Negro people. To break the
rule of the master class the workers of America need the Negro peo-
ple as allies. To break their chains the Negro people need the
American workers as champions and allies. Their interests are the
same. Their enemy is the same. Their struggle must be united.

We say therefore to both white and Negro ‘people: Black and
white, unite. Violate the Jim-Crow rules, both in the North and
in the South. Unite in the same revolutionary unions, in the same
cultural and social organizations. Negro and white, ﬁght side by
side. Stop the lynch-crimes. Teach the lynchers the lesson of
militant resistance. Make them feel in their very bones that one
cannot murder people and escape unpunished. Once a strong united
front of white and Negro workers and poor farmers meets the lynch-

. ers in a ﬁghting order, they can put an end to those bloody crimes.

We say to the Negro people: Remember that only through the
struggle of the workers and exploited farmers against capitalist
domination can you become free as a nation. Do not heed the
propaganda that calls you “Back to Africa”, back to Liberia, or any
other preachment that would have you relinquish the ﬁeld of battle.
Remember that there is no escape from exploitation and oppression
unless through revolutionary struggle that puts an end to the rule
of the oppressors and exploiters. Remember that your own Negro
reformists, like the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, who bow before the ruling class, begging them
to be “good” to the Negroes in return for obedience and slavish
docility, are not the best friends of the Negro people; as a‘ matter of
fact, they are only perpetuating your slavery and serving your mas-
ters. Remember that the propaganda of “Unity among the colored
races” (this poison is right now being instilled by Japanese imperial-

52

 

 

 

 

   

ists among the American Negroes) is misleading. Humanity is split
not into races but into oppressors and oppressed. The interests of
the Negro nation are inseparably tied up with the interests of the
white workers and farmers who suffer under the same masters. The
interests of the white workers and farmers are inseparably bound up
with the interests of the people oppressed by the same rulers.

We say to the Negro workers in particular: You are the most
militant of all your people. You have to be in the forefront of the
battle for liberation. You must join hands with your fellow work-
ers in the factories, in militant labor unions, in all other working
class organizations, in the struggle for higher wages and for all
other working class demands. Do not heed your nationalist friends
who try to persuade you that all the whites are your enemies. Look
at the way in which all minority nationalities have been liberated
and made to live a free and happy and cultured life under the
Soviets, ‘thanks to the united struggle of all the toilers.

We say to the white workers: Those who‘preach among you the
doctrine of “race superiority” are your bitter enemies. When they
speak about the “purity of the white race” they mean the _ proﬁts
of the white exploiters. When they speak about the white race being
a “master race” they" are concerned with piling up millions for the
masters. When the labor bureaucrats refuse to admit the Negroes
to the unions they are acting in the interests of the bosses to prevent
a coming together between white and Negro exploited. It is in the

interests of you workers to repudiate the poison of your masters.

Remember that white chauvinism weakens your ranks and strength-
ens the power of the oppressors. Remember that even your inaliﬂer-
ence to Negro oppression is support to boss rule. Your banner is
therefore the banner of brotherly unity, of a ﬁghting unity with the
Negro people.

The Communist Party is the only party in America that has
actually introduced Negro equality in the practice of our organiza-
tions and our every-day ﬁghts. The proof of our theory is not in
our words but in our action. Such struggles as that in connection

_ with the Scottsboro frame-up have become landmarks in the history

of the struggle against American capitalism.

THE UNITED FRONT

We have enumerated the basic struggles of the workers. There
are many more struggles. Each day brings its own tasks. Each
step of the capitalists and their State demands new struggles of the
workers. These struggles are not separated from each other. They
are intertwined into a united whole. One struggle helps another.
One victory makes others more easy. All of them strengthen the
working class. All of them weaken the capitalist system. The

53

 
   

 
 

' midst of depression.

 

struggle is always for immediate demands, but it inevitably implies
the ultimate goal: overthrow of the capitalist system. If you keep
‘your eyes open you will soon realize that only those who are for
the overthrow of the capitalist system actually ﬁght for immediate
demands. The reformist labor leaders and the Socialists, who are
not fundamentally opposed to capitalism, are not really ﬁghting
for immediate demands. Take the instance of the strikes or of the
struggle for unemployment insurance. Whatever ﬁghting has been
done in the last few years for higher wages and unemployment
insurance and relief was done under a revolutionary leadership with
the closest participation of the Communists. .
These struggles are nobody’s invention. They are dictated by life
itself. They are an outcome of existing conditions. They are vital
to the very life of the workers. With the deepening of the crisis,
with the increase of the number of the unemployed, with the increase
of the war danger, with the increase of the capitalist attacks on the
standards of living of the masses, with the increase of the fascist

' danger, with the’ increase of lynch terror, mass struggles of the

workers have become a greater necessity than ever. These struggles
will be the more effective, the greater the masses that participate in
them and the stronger their unity and will to ﬁght. This is why
we Communists advocate the united front of action.

_ The capitalists are organized. They have the government at their
beck and call. And they are crafty. They have decided to make
the best of a bad situation. Of course, they would prefer prosperity
with its sky-rocketing proﬁts. But they see their way even in the

If you squeeze each one of them a little more-—the foreign-born
are also classed as Americans when it comes to squeezing—you can

still accumulate enough proﬁts. Reduce the standard of living of

eighty million people a dollar a month and ‘you have “saved up”
for the capitalists a handsome yearly sum of 960 millions. Make
it ﬁve dollars a month—and you have the magniﬁcent sum of 4.«
billion, 800 million dollars yearly. Proﬁts will be on a good level.
Business will be able to “carry on”. Roosevelt will say “we are
deﬁnitely out of the red”. The New Deal will be hailed as the
great social achievement. As to those eighty millions of workers,
‘farmers, professionals, small businessmen with their families—well,
the rulers on top will express sympathy with the bad luck of those
unfortunates; preachers will speak of charity, Morgan will appeal on
the radio for a dime to help the “destitute”, and rich ladies will
organize charity balls. All of them will do their best to persuade
the masses to accept a pauper’s standard of living with starvation as
companion, and sickness and death from malnutrition as a prospect.
This is the capitalist way out of the crisis.
In case the masses do not readily agree to live like paupers in

this land of plenty, the capitalists have at their command the ﬂood-
gates of propaganda ballyhoo on the one hand, the club of the
American Brown Shirts on the other. The former has been used
without stint, but there is no limit demagogy can go. The latter
is being effectively developed and can easily be put into operation.
As part of the program we have increased terror, more lynchings,
persecution of foreign-born workers, deportations. The crowning
glory of the whole scheme is—war.

We Communists say this simple thing—that the masses must
refuse to carry the burden of the crisis. It is not the workers’ crisis. A
It is not the farmers’ crisis. We workers and farmers are willing ~.
to work, to produce. It is the proﬁt-seekers’ crisis. They have "I
brought it about by their greed. Let them bear its burden. '

To put it as plainly as possible. The Communists say, The masses
of America are entitled to American standards of living. If the
capitalists want to reduce us to beggary we must resist. We must
secure for ourselves a decent existence. The country is rich enough.
It can afford it. If there is a choice between the capitalists making,
proﬁts and the workers and farmers making a living, we say: down
with the proﬁts. But of course, the capitalists won’t give up readily.
There will be ﬁghts for every inch of ground. These ﬁghts must
now assume gigantic proportions. It is literally a life-and-death
struggle. Shall we live—or shall Morgan accumulate some more
wealth? Shall we have a roof over our heads——or shall Mellon buy
himself a new estate? Shall our children receive education——or shall
the Steel Trust declare a new dividend? Our program is to make
the capitalists foot the bill. They don’t like it._ They will resist.
They do resist. This is why the exploited must form a powerful
front—a united front of all the exploited and oppressed.

This is the crying need of our times.

The idea is simple enough. We are Communists. But our
neighbors may not be Communists. They may be Socialists or
Democrats or Republicans, or non-party. Yet if they are workers
they must be interested in unemployment and social insurance. We
tell them: The broader the front of struggle for social insurance
the more certain the results. Therefore, let us unite. Let us agree
to ﬁght unitedly for social insurance. Let us all organize one great
drive, one demonstration, one hunger march, one petition campaign.
We do not amalgamate in this drive. We keep our organizational
independence. Yet we unite for this particular act. We thus can
greatly widen our front. We can make it as wide as the working
class itself. A

The same is true about the struggle against fascism. The same is
true about the struggle for Negro rights. The same is true about
the struggle against war. And of course the struggle for higher

 
  
   
  
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
       
   

  

successful as a united struggle of large masses irrespective of their
political aiﬁliation. ‘

It is‘for this reason that we Communists have been advocating
and organizing the united front for the last few years. While we

have met with resistance on the part of many reformist union leaders

and leaders of the Socialist Party, we have met with response among

 

the workers and farmers. Thus, united May-Day demonstrations,
/united anti-fascist and anti-war demonstrations, united ﬁghts for

home relief, united campaigns for social insurance, and above all
other things, the great San Francisco general strike, have been
brought about. Two anti-fascist congresses were organized with
thousands of delegates in each. The American League against
War and Fascism was formed. The Congress for Social Insurance
was called. The drive behind HR. 2827 was organized. Numerous
strike struggles were fought.

The Communists say the united front must be extended to embrace
all those interested in resisting the capitalists’ attempts at lowering
the standards of living of the masses and in ﬁghting the danger of

' fascism and war.

  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 

In our efforts to build the united front we have approached every
working-class organization. Thousands of local unions of the
A. F. of L. responded. Many fraternal and cultural organizations
joined. Many professional groups lent support. Yet the bulk of
the top leaders of the A. F. of L. and of the Socialist Party oppose
the united front. '

By this they refuse to strengthen the working class in this crucial
historic period. ‘

They advance a number of “arguments” that are equally clumsy
and false. First they say we are “insincere”. But, my dear re-
formists, how can you prove sincerity if not by action? The proof
of the pudding is ‘in the eating. The proof of our sincerity is in
our oining every united front, carrying out the terms of the agree-
ment with other organizations, doing the work, participating in the
ﬁghting. The proof of our sincerity is in the fact that We Com-
munists are the only organization that has consistently and unre-
mittingly fought for the creation of the united front.

Then they say we are pursuing “our own” Communist interests.
This is an old claim. It does not hold water. The only aim we
pursue everywhere is to make the workers more successful ﬁghters
for their right to‘ live. In the united front we want to see more
unity, more ﬁrmness, more red-blooded ﬁghters.‘

Another accusation is that we want to “capture” everything we
touch. Nonsense. _ We do not want to make the American League
against War and Fascism or the League of Struggle for Negro
Rights a Communist organization. We want every section of the
toiling masses in the united front and we have joined in united

action with various and widely‘ divergent mass organizations, work-
ers’ organizations, farmers’ associations, paciﬁst groups, church
organizations, student bodies, etc. We have not attempted to capture
any of the existing united-front organizations. And we have kept
the standing agreement not to criticize the aﬂiliated bodies in relation
to the united-front action as long as they adhere to the policies of
the united front. ,

Back of all this loose talk about this or that vile Communist plot
is a very simple reason. The reformists are afraid of revolution.
In this they are entirely subservient to the existing system. They
shun everything that may give a olt to the masters of the land. In
the united front they sense an instrument that may cause the rulers
no amount of trouble. This they try to avoid. They pretend to be
shocked by the “unreasonableness” of some of our proposals, but
they are shocked by the struggle against the capitalist system.

It may sound comical, but many a reformist is against the demand
of high wages or a decent standard of living on the ground. that
“business cannot afford to pay that much”. The reformist argues
that if the demand is carried business will be “forced to the wall”.
He argues forthe exploiter, not for the exploited.

We Communists say: If the exploiters have created a system which
cannot yield proﬁts for them and secure a decent living for all,
then why should the exploited worry about the proﬁts? If the
exploiters are forced to the wall because we must live, then let them

to support the exploiters. If they cannot carry on their business
under such conditions, somebody will. In fact the workers them-
selves will carry on the business Without proﬁts—for the benefit. of
all. This, of course, cannot be achieved without revolution. But
such is the present situation in America, that the very necessity to’
live drives the workers to a revolution. There is only one Way open
for the workers—the revolutionary way out of the crisis.

The reformists are afraid of the united front because that will
make the working class more powerful and hence more prepared for
revolutionary battles. The reformists dread an attack on the
capitalist system. But the workers do not. The workers have no
stake in this system. They have nothing to lose but their chains.
This is why they must join the united front and force their leaders
to yield to a united front.

We do not conceal the fact that through the united front we as
Communists may gain greater influence among the masses. Such
has notably been the case in France where Communists and
Socialists formed a united anti-fascist, anti-war front. But this is
solely due to the fact that the actual experiences in the united-front
struggles teach the workers the correctness of the Communist policies.
Let ‘the reformists blame themselves if their programs and tactics

Has it ever occurred to you that such a state of affairs is wrong?

Take another example. You are a tenant. For ten or ﬁfteen
or twenty years you have been living in a house. You have paid
your rent regularly. You have paid off your flat several times over.
Yourllandlord smiled at you as long as you were a “good” tenant.
But now you have lost your job. You have not paid your rent for
several months. A sheriﬁ comes. Your furniture is thrown, out
on the sidewalk. You are “evicted”. Yet you know perfectly well
that it isn’t the landlord who built the house. It is you and others
like you who have produced all the building material and who have
actually constructed the house. Besides, you made the landlord rich
by your payment of rents.

Suppose now, you refuse to quit the house. Suppose you band
together with your fellow tenants and declare .you are not going to
permit anybody to “drive you out into the street. You are a proud
American; you will not allow any man to turn you into a beggar.
Again, you would be confronted with police clubs, courts and jail.

It looks strange. But this madness is the every-day practice of
our great and wealthy country.

proceed.- We said that the owner “has never worked”. You may
disagree with this statement. Doesn’t a factory owner spend days
and days in his office? Doesn’t a banker keep office hours? Doesn’t
he go to the country club and golflinks to rest after his strenuous
labors? The papers and the preachers and the professors tell you
‘ ‘ that the business man is “doing his share” in production. They
even say that he is an indispensable part of the industrial organism.
This is one of those incorrect notions that are being inculcated in
the minds of our people from childhood on. In fact, the small
business man may still do some work by himself: the grocer works
behind the counter, the cobbler works together with his few men.
But the bigger the business, the less work remains for the actual
owner. What does Morgan know about-the operation of railroads
-and mines and restaurants he controls? What does Rockefeller
' know about work in a coal mine or an oil reﬁning plant? Remove
Ford from the top of his pyramid and nobody will notice the loss.
Ford may have been instrumental in working up his business long
ago with the aid of numerous engineers and workers—but he no
more “runs” his business than the man in the moon.
Big business, large scale production of the modern type is con-
‘ I ducted by all kinds of specialists with the aid and cooperation of
T workers. Engineers, technicians, draftsmen, machinists, chemists,
all kinds of experts are managing the big industrial giants of today,

Workers. .
The time has come to organize a united front of all workers who
are ready to break with the capitalist parties but are not yet ready

' to line up with the Communist Party. There is no reason why these
workers should continue to support the Republican and Democratic.
parties, which carry out the policies of ﬁnance capital. There is

no reason why they should not unite to build a Labor Party that
would ﬁght for unemployment insurance, adequate relief, higher
wages, abolition of child labor, a guaranteed 30-hour working
week, the right of the workers to organize, the right to strike and
picket, the closed shop, economic, political and social equality for

-the Negroes, anti-lynching laws, etc., a party that would ‘ﬁght

militarism, fascism, police terror, war. One need not be a Com-
munist to support such a program. 7
What we have in mind is not a party that would be controlled
from on top by the reactionary labor leaders and, calling itself a
labor party, would actually be a third party of capital; what we

‘ Ahave in mind is not a party that might talk nice words about

“redistribution of wealth” but in practice would check and suppress
the struggles of the workers and serve to preserve capitalism, like the

iFarmer-Labor Party of Minnesota or the LaFollette Progressive _

Party of Wisconsin. What we propose is a Labor Party founded
on the trade unions and other working-class and working farmers’
organizations,‘a party‘ controlled by the rank and ﬁle and ﬁghting
for the immediate needs and interests of the working people. Such
an anti-capitalist Labor Party, the Communist Party is ready to
help organize. _ In such a Labor Party the Communist Party is ready

‘to participate as a component part. This ‘means that the Labor
_ Party must be a mass united front of many organizations agreeing

on a militant program for continuous all-year-round struggle.

VI

The Revolutionary ﬂverthrow of Capitalism and the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat

THE overthrow of the State power, and with it, of the capitalist
system, grows out of the everyday struggles of the workers.
One is historically inseparable from the other.

As the organization of ,the workers grows, as their struggles be-
come ﬁercer, while many non-proletarian elements like farmers,
intellectuals, and oppressed members of the lower middle class join
the revolutionary movement, the final onslaught on the fortress ‘of

  

 

capitalism draws nearer. These struggles are the reaction of the
masses to the misery wrought by the crisis of capitalism. The
capitalists try to overcome the crisis by putting additional burdens
on the shoulders of the masses, but they cannot cure the incurable
disease. There-comes a time when large sections of the population
say that this simply “cannot go on”. The government seems to be
entirely incompetent to cope with the political and social difficulties.

  

The belief of the population in the wisdom and all-powerfulness of '

the “men higher up” is shaken. These men are losing their conﬁ-
dence. The conﬁdence of the masses in their own strength is growing
apace. The struggles of the masses meanwhile become broader
and deeper. The government tries suppression. It does not succeed
in crushing the spirit of revolt. It cannot stem the tide. The
previous struggles of the workers count greatly. The clearer the
class-consciousness of the workers, the more steeled they are in
ﬁghting, the better the revolutionary leadership they have developed
in the course of years (the Communist Party), the greater the num-
her of friends they have allied with themselves from among the
other oppressed classes, the more capable are they to deal -the
ﬁnal blow. ‘

It is not necessary that this ﬁnal blow, i.e., the revolution, should
come in connection with an imperialist war, although this is very
likely. Capitalism will seek to prevent a revolution by plunging the
country into war. War is to serve not only as a way out of the

crisis but as a means to arouse the patriotism of the masses, to

 

increase governmental terror (martial law)", and to divert public
attention from internal affairs. War, under such conditions, for a
while retarding the revolutionary movement, may hasten it later
when the war sufferings begin to tell on the-masses.

A time comes when there is demoralization above, a growing
revolt below; the morale of the army is also undermined. The old
structure of society is tottering. There are actual insurrections‘; the
army wavers. Panic seizes the rulers. A general uprising begins.

Workers stop work, many of them seize arms by attacking arsenals. V
Many had armed themselves before as the struggles sharpened. -

Street ﬁghts become frequent. Under the leadership of the Com-
munist Party, the workers organize Revolutionary Committees to be
in command of the uprising. There are battles in the principal
cities. Barricades are built and defended. The workers’ ﬁghting
has a decisive inﬂuence with the soldiers. Army units begin. to
join the revolutionary ﬁghters; there is fraternization between the
workers and the soldiers, the workers and the marines. The move-
ment among the soldiers and~marines spreads. Capitalism is losing its
strongest weapon, the army. The police as a rule continue ﬁghting,
but they are soon silenced and made to ﬂee by the united revolution-

ary forces of workers and soldiers. The revolution is victorious.

HISTORIC EXAMPLES

Can it be done?’ It has been done more than once. A revolution
broke the backbone of tsarism in Russia in 1905, but was soon de-

'_ feated. A revolution abolished tsarism in March 1917 when a pro-

visional revolutionary capitalist government was established. In
each case the workers played the leading role. A workers’ revolu-
tion was accomplished in Russia in November 1917 when the Soviet
Government, which is the government of the workers and peasants,
was established. The Soviet system has been in existence for nearly
18 years. A workers’ revolution took place in Germany in 1918,
in Hungary and Bavaria in'1919, in China in 1927. A revolution
took place in Spain in 1932. In most of these revolutions the
workers were betrayed; they were either deprived by shrewd capi-
talist politicians of the fruits of their revolutionary struggle or

’ defeated‘ in armed combat, with Socialist leaders aiding the ex-

ploiters. In Russia the revolution has survived ﬁrst of all because
the workers had a strong, well organized Bolshevik (Communist)
Party that headed their ﬁght. The defeat of the other revolu-
tions does not argue against the eventuality of revolution. In
fact, revolutions are inevitable. They are a natural outcome of the
existing system. Our time is a time of workers’ revolutions. If not
all of the revolutions of the last 15 years succeeded in securing
the workers’ rule, this was due either to the absence of a strong
Communist Party entrenched among the workers, or to the absence
of other strong working-class organizations, or to the intervention
of foreign imperialists, or to some of these causes combined. And
in either case, the reformists were playing the role both of enemies
within the working class betraying the revolution and of leaders
of.the capitalist forces from without the working class against the
revolution—all in the name of- “democracy” and “freedom”.

Can a revolution be won? Capitalism creates a situation where
large masses of the people are dissatisﬁed, embittered, emboldened
by intolerable hardships. Capitalism itself prepares the conditions
for its cataclysm. If under conditions of a severe capitalist crisis
the majority of the working class is ready to wage a determined
armed ﬁght "for the overthrow of the capitalist system, then the
revolution may be victorious, provided there is in existence a mass
Communist Party recognized by the workers as their leader in
struggles against capitalism. '

A standard reformist argument against the revolution is: “The
weapons of warfare are so strong in our days that the workers have
no chance of winning in open conflict”. The wish is father to the
thought of the reformists in this respect. Because they hate a revo-
lution of the workers, they maintain that a revolution cannot win.
What is true is that a revolution cannot win unless the armed forces,

60

 

 

 

or at least part of them, join the workers. But once they join, the

workers have not only riﬂes and cannon but also airships and poison ,

gas and battleships to ﬁght the bosses. Poison gases are destructive,
to be sure, but their destructive power can be turned also against
the old system. There is no reason why the workers should not use
them against the enemy when the ﬁnal conflict has arrived. In all
revolutions throughout history the armed forces of the old system
were at the beginning stronger than the armed forces of the
revolutionists.

THE QUESTION OF FORCE AND VIOLENCE

“But this is force and violence”, somebody will contend. “Don’t
you Communists know that the use of force and violence is wrong?”
We reply to this, ﬁrst, that if being a “red-blooded American” means
anything, it means that you must not take punishment lying down,
that you must offer resistance; secondly, that it is not the workers
but the capitalists and their State that start the use of force and
violence. When you wish to stay on in your place of work and the
employer who wants you “ﬁred” sends for the watchmen and has
you thrown out, it is he that uses force. When you wish to stay
on in the apartment of a house you and the like of you have built,
and the landlord calls the sheriff to evict you, it is he that uses
force. When‘ you go out on a demonstration in the open in front

of a governmental oiﬁce and the government sends the police and'

armed thugs to beat you up and disperse you, it is the government
that is using force. When you are thrown in jail for refusing to
transport ammunition in time of war, it is the government that is
using violence against you. Force and violence are the daily bread
of the exploiters and their government in dealing with the exploited.
Force and violence are the very essence of the State. When the
warehouses are bulging with foodstuffs you and the like of you
have produced while you, the hungry, are kept from them by the
armed force of watchmen and police, force and violence are used
against you. How can you live and breathe if you do not resist?
How can you defend your fundamental interests if you do not defy
boss restrictions? To defy boss restrictions, to resist the attacks
of the enemy class is just as natural for the working class as it is
for a red-blooded human being not to take punishment lying down.

What a picture! Those who live on your sweat and blood tell
you it is not “right” to resist this robbery. Those who hold the
big stick over you tell you to be meek as a lamb. Those who make
the oppressive laws against you preach among you about the sanctity
of the law. This is boss law, boss justice, boss ideas of right and

wrong. If the workers..were to submit they would not be able to

live; they would be reduced to something Worse than chattel slavery.
61 ‘

 

We Communists say the workers cannot have respect for boss
law and boss morality directed against them. The class interests

' of the working class—these are the supreme law for the workers.

Defending their lives and their future they must inevitably come into

 conflict with boss law. Defending their very lives they are driven
‘to stand up against boss force. Fighting against the boss system

they are defending not only their own class interests but the interests
of mankind. For capitalism has reduced mankind to a state of

chronic misery, poverty, insecurity, fear, periodic carnage, insane
’_ luxury for the few,’hunger and degradation for the many—a state
 that simply cannot continue if mankind is to progress. Capitalism

is decaying and, to save humanity, this putrid wound-on its body
must be removed. V a
When you ﬁght capitalism you are doing what is right and just

_and lawful from the point of View of your class interests and of the
future of humanity. You are not “outlaws” the way the capitalist
gworld brands revolutionary ﬁghters. You are ﬁghting for a-higher

morality and a higher law» that will forever abolish exploitation—the

,_ morality and the law of the social revolution.

Having crushed the capitalist State the social revolution, acting

[through armed workers and soldiers, will establish the Soviet State
--asthe instrument of the workers’ and poor farmers’ power.

THE SOVIET STATE

The Soviet State was first established in Russia, but it was later

{introduced wherever workers seized power: in Bavaria, Hungary,
in large sections of China, and, most recently, in Asturias and
Biscay (Spain). The Soviets are composed of Deputies elected at

the places where men and women work. In cities, the Soviets are

elected by the workers in factories, plants, oiﬁces and educational

establishments. In villages, the Soviets are elected by all working

-peasants. Each person engaged in any kind of work is entitled to a
‘vote. Owners of wealth, capitalists, land-owners, and other ex-

ploiters, as long as they have not yet been turned into useful citizens

~ working for the community, are excluded from suffrage. They

have no voice in the administration of public affairs. On the other
hand, suffrage is extended to vastly greater numbers of working
people than is the case under capitalism. The Soviets of Workers’,
Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies form the local government every-
where. Representatives of the local Soviets form the central Soviet
which is the government of the country.

The Government of the Soviets is a government of those who
work. It is elected in the places of work from among those who
work, and it is responsible to those who elected it. It consists
exclusively of workers and peasants, which means that it is the
.  - 62

   

  

- letarian rule. Exploitation of man by man is abolished. Differences

 
 

greatest democracy in the world. It is a real government of the
rank and ﬁle. Exploiters are barred from it. Its deputies and other
officials are paid no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.
Its deputies are subject to instant recall by their electors. Under
the Soviets the workers- and peasants are armed, and police and
judicial functions are carried out by the workers and peasants them-
selves. _ ' t ’
This government has the great task of taking away from the
owners the plants, factories, railroads, banks and turning them into
public property to be administered by the workers for the common
beneﬁt of all. In other words, it is the task of the Soviets to abolish
private’ property in the means of production and to establish Socialist
production and distribution. .
This cannot be accomplished peacefully. The exploiters won’t.-
give up their loot even after their State power is crushed. They v
will have to be routed. The Soviet government will have to expro- I
priate the expropriators by force. The latter will conspire and plot 
against the new system; they will organize~counter-revolutionary up-
risings: The‘ Soviet State will have to crush these with an iron hand.
The former exploiters will be given no quarter. The old system of
robbery with all its rubbish will have to be cleared away. This means.
that the Soviet State must be ‘ruthless; it must destroy the counter-
revolutionary forces——the quicker the better for the workers and for ‘
the future of mankind. This is why the Soviet State is named’
Dictatorship of the Proletariat. It is the reverse of capitalist dic-.
tatorship. It does not pretend to be a government treating all on
the basis of equality. It openly declares itself to be a class govern-
ment directed against the former ruling class. It is avowedly an
instrument for the expropriation and suppression of the former ex-
ploiters and oppressors. It is a government of the former exploited
and oppressed. And it does away with exploitation and oppression
forever. As soon as private property is abolished, as soon as the
industrial machinery of the country has become socialized, as soon
as the individual farmers have been induced, for their own advantage,
to unite in collective farms, exploitation of man by man ceases to
exist. That means freedom. K 
With the workers coming into their own, the road is open for
economic and. cultural progress undreamed of under capitalism.
Production is rapidly increased. Standards of living rise higher
and higher. Education, letters, art, invention blossom under pro-

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

between farmers and workers disappear. Minority nationalities, op-
pressed and kept backward under capitalism and granted self-
determination by the revolution, rapidly develop. The whole country
becomes one big working community on a high plane. The rule
is soon established: “Let each person work according to his ability; _

I 63 '

 
 
 

    

    
   
  
  
   
   
   

   

let each person receive from the common stock of goods according
to his needs”. This is Communism.

Man himself changes under such conditions. Soon the State is
no more needed. In a classless society there is nobody to suppress
or keep in check. Highly cultured men and women, bred in a
spirit of collective life, masters ofnature and of their own society,

  

do not need the big stick of the State. They manage their affairs _

without the State force. Mankind is free, forever.

VII

The Communist Party

THE Communist Party is the vanguard and general staff of the
workers in their struggle against the old system, in their
revolution against it and in the upbuilding of the new system.
The Communist Party is a political party, which means that its
concern is the struggle of the working class as a whole for State
power. Whereas the primary concern of the militant unions

. is the economic struggle for better conditions while preparing the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

workers for their ultimate struggle; whereas the primary concern
of the Unemployment Councils is the ﬁght for unemployment and
social insurance; whereas the fraternal organizations concern them-
selves primarily with mutual aid and the struggle for social insur-
ance (none of these struggles is isolated from the others and all of
them must be fought on a political basis), the Communist Party
concerns itself with all phases of the movement, unifying them,
giving them direction, ﬁlling them with the spirit of the class
struggle, orientating them towards the ultimate overthrow of the
capitalist system.

The Communist‘Party is a political party. Its aim is to effect
the seizure of political power by the workers. It therefore looks
upon every activity of the workers (and poor farmers) from this
point of view.‘ But there is no contradiction between the ultimate
aim and the immediate interests of the workers. Whatever con-
tradicts the political aim of the workers is also harmful to them at
present and therefore rejected by the Party. The outlook of the
Communist Party is wider and more all-embracing than the outlook
of the other working-class organizations, even those that assume
the point of View of the class struggle.

The Communist Party not only draws into its ranks the most
advanced and most militant workers, but it gives them political
training. It teaches them Marxism-Leninism, which equips the
worker with a thorough understanding of the society he lives in
and of the historic task of the working class. The Communist Party

- ' 64

  

 

.7.‘ A .«~

.. wr 

 

looks upon its members as leaders in the struggle and it trains
them to be ﬁt for this work. The Communist Party is a school
of the class struggle in every one of its phases.

At the bottom of all the activities of the Communist Party lies
a clear and exhaustive analysis of the social forces in the society
of the present.* The Communist Party watches very carefully every
turn in the development of the country, whether economic, political,
social or cultural, and at every turn it points out to the workers
what they have to do in order ﬁnally to achieve the maximum
results, the overthrow of capitalism. This plan of struggle for the
working class is called the Party line. The Communist Party is
the only political organization that works out a line of activity
for every branch of the labor movement at every given moment.

The Communist Party is active directly as an organization and
indirectly through its members within other organizations. The
Communist Party leads political as well as economic struggles, like
the ﬁght for the liberation of political prisoners, the ﬁght against
high taxes levied upon the workers, the ﬁght for better housing, free
lunches for school children, the ﬁght against imperialist war and
for thedefense ofthe Soviet Union, the ﬁght against governmental
terror, the ﬁght against the Jim-Crow system and lynchings, the
ﬁght against fascism, the ﬁght for the liberation of the oppressed
colonial peoples, and many others. These ﬁghts are conducted
through literature, through mass meetings, through demonstrations
and, when occasion demands. through open mass combat with the
police in the streets.

The Communist Party also participates in the election campaigns
as a separate and distinctpolitical party. It nominates its candidates
for federal and local offices and it solicits votes. It is anxious to
have its representatives in the legislative bodies. But its election
campaigns and its activities within parliament are fundamentally
different from those of, say, the Socialist Party. We Communists
are not here to help the capitalists govern the masses. We are here
to help the masses press their masters, get from the capitalists and
their government a maximum of concessions.‘ We do not spread the
false notion that there can be cooperation between the exploited and
their exploiters. On the contrary, we go to the legislatures to prove
to the workers that such cooperation must not be because it is good

"only for the bosses. In other words, we go to the legislatures——and

we conduct our election campaigns—in the spirit of the class
struggle. We use the platform of the legislatures, from which our
voice can be heard better than the voice of private citizens, to help
organize the workers and help them conduct all their daily struggles.

* For the daily opinion of the Communist Party on all economic and politi-
cal questions read the Daily Worker, published at 50 East 13th St., New
York City.

65

 

At the same time we try to force the law-makers to pass legislation
that would bring relief to the workers. We do so, not by pretty
speeches, not by telling the lawmakers, who are servants of the big
money bags, how ﬁne and noble they are, but by heading great
movements of the masses which would make those gentlemen sit up
and take notice. In other words, while the Socialists solicit votes

in order to reform the State and thereby to make it more effective

for the capitalists, we Communists practice revolutionary parliamen-

tarism, by which is meant strengthening the working class and
weakening its enemies. We go to the law-making institutions, not to

tinker them up for the beneﬁt of the capitalists, but to be a monkey

‘wrench in their machinery, preventing it from working smoothly

on behalf of the masters. We use, while there, every step of those
agents of the capitalists to expose them before the people, to show
what these so-called representatives of the people and what all these
so-called democratic institutions actually are. '

THE PARTY UNIT

Aside from these political activities directly conducted in the name
of the Communist Party, every Communist is obliged to be active
in the organization to which he belongs and in the place where he
works. Wherever there are three or more Communists, whether in a
factory or in a mine, in a union or in a fraternal organization, they
have to get together and form a group. A group formed in a place

I - of work is called Party nucleus. A group formed in an organization

is called Party fraction. The group discusses the problems of the
shop or the organization and instructs its members to act in the
best interests of the working class. A good Communist is a worker
who thoroughly understands the problems of his place of work or
his organization and who develops activity that can serve as an
example for his fellow workers. A good Communistis a so-
cial being who has the interests of his fellow workers at heart

A andwho is devoting his best energies to advance the cause of the

workers wherever he happens to be.‘ Agood Communist is a man
or a woman who by virtue of these qualities becomes a leader.
amongst his fellow workers——not a leader by dint of some mechanical
control, but a leader by dint of better understanding, more courage
and superior organizing abilities. Communists are trained to. be

‘ that way. This is why a small number of Communists will

oftenachieve more than greater numbers of unorganized workers
pulling in different directions. What is important to remember is
this, that Communists have no interests other than the interests of

the working class, the improvement of its life at present and the ‘

‘destruction of capitalism in the future. You have undoubtedly heard

‘about the “sinister plots” of the Communists; There, is nothing

sinister about the Communist organization. Here are a dozen Com-’
munists working in the same shop. It is natural for them to get»
together and form a shop nucleus. It is natural for them to constitute
themselves as a permanent body. They may use secrecy to avoid the

spying eye of the employers; but this again is most natural under -
capitalism; the workers would be foolhardy to expose their plans

of activity to the bosses.

A Party nucleus holds its meetings regularly every week. Our
shop nucleus will discuss at nearly every meeting how to organize
the struggle of the workers against the employer in that particular
shop. The shop nucleus will not keep itself isolated from the rest
of the workers. On the contrary, it will be the duty of every Com-
munist to be in closest touch with the workers, to be part of the
workers, to understand every issue of their shop life. The Com-s
munists will distribute papers and pamphlets among the workers;
If need’ be, they will publish a local paper which will expose the a
evils of the shop and-organize the workers for struggle. The Com-
munists will keep secret from the management and the stool pigeons,
but not from the workers. They will invite non-party workers to
their nucleus meetings to discuss certain problems. They will gain-
the conﬁdence of the workers just because they have a well-thought
out and ﬁtting solution for the pressing problems and because they
show resistance in dealing with the boss or with the foreman. They
have got to stand up as ﬁghters or else they cannot be Communists.
They will soon become known to the workers as a militant group.
Many more will join. The inﬂuence of the Communist Party will
grow. ,
The time comes when the Communists head an open struggle
against the employer or the State. It may be a strike for higher
wages. In this case the Communists will help organize a strike
committee from among the rank-and-ﬁle workers, this committee to
consist of Party and non-Party workers and to act under the direct"
leadership of the trade union of that industry. It may be a mass
demonstration for unemployment insurance. In that case the Com! ,~
munists will help "organize a local rank-and-ﬁle Unemployment’ I
Council. It may be any other act of struggle. In either case the
Communists will not force their will upon the workers. On the con-»
trary, they will see to it that they share the initiative with as many»
workers as possible. ‘They are not here to give orders. They are
workers themselves who suffer like all the other workers but give a‘
clearer voice to the protest that is brewing "among the workers. The
more workers participate in preparing an act of struggle the greater ~
the chances of victory. ' .

In such struggles some of the workers will move to the front as
more clear-sighted, more active, more able to express the needs of
the workers, and more quick-minded in ﬁnding a solution to an

67 '

 

 

never produce. They could be removed without any loss to actual
operations. ,

And yet, it is they who decide to cut down production or to close
the plant altogether, depriving both the staffs‘ of specialists and the
skilled and unskilled workers of their sole means of making a living.
Those who do not produce decide for those who produce.

As to bankers and brokers, real estate operators and promoters——
they do not produce anything essential to human life either, although
they have the lion’s share of control over-production. As a matter

 
 

of fact, they produce nothing. They transfer “paper” from hand to "

hand. That paper—call it checks or deeds or drafts or shares—is
a claim to the fruits of somebody else’s labor. V

Another question is that of “bad luck”. You have been taught
to think that when you are out of work it is just your misfortune.
“Business is bad”, “there is a depression”, they say. “Nobody is to
blame”. You are given to understand that economic powers are
beyond human control. You are told that a depression is something
like an earthquake, like a thunderstorm, like an avalanche. And
yet, human ingenuity has learned how to control some of the most
formidable forces of nature. The- human mind has harnessed elec-
tricity, which produces the lightning. Human knowledge is accom-

plishing things which look miraculous. The tropics and the poles, *

Khe air and the bowels of the earth are all coming under control of

‘ man. Why should he not be able to control the production and

   

distribution of goods that are vital for his life? Isn’t the Soviet

Union a living example that this can be achieved? Why should‘

there be a situation like the one we suffer under in the U.S.A. at
present where millions of able-bodied workers, capable and willing
to work, are being consumed by idleness and hunger, while excellent
machines and ‘mountains of raw material are lying around unused?
Is it so difficult after all for human genius to organize a constant
flow of goods which would satisfy everybody’s needs with nobody
compelled to go without food, clothing and shelter? II-Iumanity
has learned to master the forces of nature. The progress of science
is tremendous. New and ever newer inventions are made to aid
human labor. At the “Century of Progress Exhibition” at Chicago,
they showed cotton-picking machines, each of which does the work
of 16'to 48 men. There are excavators and ditch diggers that do
the work of 20 or 30 men. Between 1919 and 1929 the productivity
of American labor increased 43 per cent. Why should the terrible
crash in 1929 have had to come? Why should we have had to
suffer those long weary years of the most terrible crisis in the history
of this country?

We cannot blame this plight of millions on “natural forces”.
There is nothing natural in such a situation. It is not natural that

men should go hungry while the means to produce food are close
. 5 ,

 

-emergency problem. These will become the mass leaders. Some of

them will be Communists, some non-Party workers, but in the long.

run every ﬁghting mass leader will ﬁnd his way to the Communist
Party because he will realize its advantages for the workers’ struggle.

Thus the Communist nucleus will establish itself as the ﬁghting

organization recognized by the workers. It will lead. It will put

' fear in the heart of the boss. It will put conﬁdence in the hearts of

the workers. It will become the vanguard and the leader of the
local workers. V _

The Communists who, for one reason or another, are not members
of a shop nucleus’ (or mine or mill nucleus) organize locally in the
place of residence into a street nucleus. The street nucleus is com-
posed of the Communists living in the same neighborhood. It may
consist of from ten to thirty, but rarely more members, because a
large nucleus becomes unwieldy. When a street nucleus grows too
large, part of it is organized into another nucleus and given another
territory to work in. The street nucleus organizes and leads the
‘workers’ struggles in its territory. Suppose there is a shop in that
territory and the workers are unorganized. The street nucleus
concentrates on that shop. It organizes open air meetings in front
of the shop just at the time when the workers ﬁnish work. Some of
the workers stop to listen, become interested, receive papers and
pamphlets distributed around the meeting place. The nucleus re-
peats_this action until contacts are established with the shop. Once
there is a group of sympathetic workers inside, the task of organiz-
ing the shop workers to defend their interests becomes much easier.
One street nucleus may concentrateon a number of local shops. It
also concentrates on unemployed work. It makes a canvass of all
the unemployed in its territory, organizes from among them an
Unemployment Council, ﬁghts together with it for unemployed relief;
if need be, the street nucleus calls a demonstration in front of the
local Home Relief Bureau to insist on aid for those discriminated
against. The street nucleus heads many other workers’ struggles. in
its territory. The ﬁght against the eviction of unemployed, the ﬁght
for free gas and electricity for the unemployed, the ﬁght for the
release of imprisoned local workers, assistance to strikers’ pickets,
local demonstrations against the oppression of Negroes in the neigh-

 borhood—all these and many other activities are the almost daily‘

tasks of the street nucleus.

Both the shop and the street nuclei, thus, exist not for themselves,
not for “Communist interests”, as you are so often told, for there
are no Communist interests outside of the interests of the working
class. The Party nucleus is a’ center of ﬁghting Workers in a shop
or neighborhood. That is a bad nucleus which stews in its own
juice. A good nucleus is one that is in various ways connected with
the workers in the shop or neighborhood, is recognized by themlas a

' 68 .

  

, organizer. Its inﬂuence can be great, if the workers are induced to

uniform line; they plan work and they carry it out. The bosses

ijterests. When they see a party 0

 

 
 

ﬁghting unit, is supported by them, is continually increased by the
joining of new workers, and is proved as leader in many .class
conﬂicts for the beneﬁt of the workers.

‘Not the least among the functions of the shop and street nuclei ..
is the distribution of the Communist, papers, magazines and pam-
phlets. After all, the press is a good propagandist and a good

   
 
  

read it and to spread it. The Communists make it their business
to talk to non-Party workers, explaining to them the meaning of the
Communist press as‘ the workers’ press, and offering to provide
them with a paper or magazine. In the same way they distribute
pamphlets and books. Once a worker has begun to read a paper or
pamphlet explaining to him the class struggle, he soon recognizes
the truth of that explanation which he can supplement by numerous
facts from his own experience. Reading about the class struggle,
recognizing the correctness of the class struggle, is a step to actual
participation in the class struggle. ‘.

Here as elsewhere there is a deep-gulf between us Communists
and the Socialist leaders. They say the American workers are
difficult to move and that there is no hope of workers putting up a
stiff ﬁght in this country. We say, but let the American worker
recognize his class interests, and he will ﬁght in great working-class
militant organizations for his life, for his freedom, for the ﬁnal
liberation of his class and all oppressed. I ’

Aside from shop (mine, plant) nuclei and street nuclei’ of the
Communist Party, there are Party fractions. The Communists be-»
longing to any organization form a special fraction which discusses
the problems of its organization and proposes a line of action for
its members. This enables the Communists in a reformist union or V
fraternal organization to follow the same line. The Party fraction
advocates militancy and strives to transform the whole organization
into a real ﬁghting unit. _

' It is quite obvious that Communist activity requires‘ training.
Every Party nucleus is in fact a training school in the practice of the
class struggle. It also gives theoretical classes to its members. It
conducts discussions on current questions. Its most capable, militant
members are sent to special training schools. The whole Party is
engaged in raising, as we call it, the theoretical level of itsmembers.

You will now understand what there is to those tales about “Com-

munist plots”. The Communists have a good organization and a

 
  
  
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 

certainly dislike such a method, when used by the workers. You will
also understand why the enemies speak so much about “rigid Com-
munist discipline”. They would like the workers to be undecided,
without unity and cohesion. That would be good for the capitalist in-
f revolutionary workers organized, .

enlightened, trained to do revolutionary work and acting in harmony
with one another in accordance with a preconceived plan, they decry
it. In this plan, unity and cohesion, however, is the strength of every
workers’ organization, including that of the Communist Party. We
discuss problems, we study them carefully, but once a decision is
made it is binding for every member. We are a democratic organi-

zation because every member has a vote and every rank and ﬁler is’

entitled and invited to criticize the activities of the organization or of
individual leaders, and to participate in shaping the policies of the
Party. We are at the same time a centralized organization because
we work according to one plan and because decisions of the higher
Party bodies are obligatory for the lower bodies—from the center
down to the units. The Communist Party is thus built on the basis
of democratic centralism. That makes for unity of action.

THE PARTY IN ACTION

Let us now have a look at the Party as a whole. At the head
of it is the Central Committee elected at the national convention.
In the Districts there are District Committees elected at District con-
ventions (the country is divided into 27. districts) . Each District is
divided into Sections and each Section comprises a number of units,
i.e., shop and street nuclei. Under the District and Section Com-
mittees are the various fractions. The interests of the Party require
that all members should have thoroughtly discussed every issue that
comes up in the life of the working class. They should have dis-
cussed in each unit what every member has to do in the coming few
days. Directives are given from the Center to the Districts, from
the Districts to the Sections and the units. Everybody must be
prepared. Everybody must understand the meaning of what is to be
done. Everybody is obliged to assist his comrade. There should
be complete unity of purpose and unity of action. Today we are

having a unit meeting which ﬁrst discusses an important problem,-

theoretical or practical, and then assigns work to each member. It
is at this meeting that the fundamentalunity of the Party is forged.
Tomorrow each one of these Party members will plunge headlong
into one or the other realm of work. One will confront the boss with
the demand of the workers in his shop; another will lead a group of
unemployed workers to the Home Relief Bureau to demand immedi-
ate relief for those that have been discriminated against; a third will
participate in the picket line facing the clubs of armed thugs; a
fourth will be active in putting back into an apartment the furniture
of an evicted family; a ﬁfth will be speaking to a group of marine
workers, trying to make them join the union; a sixth will be
speaking to a group of workers engaged in an ammunition plant,
trying to make them understand the necessity of organizing in order
70 ~ .

 

 
 
 
   

 

to be ready to stop work in case of war; a seventh will distribute
leaflets calling for a demonstration to protest against U. S. im-
perialist intervention in Cuba; an eighth will be speaking in the
open air in favor of the local Communist candidate for mayor; a
ninth will be showing the workers a Soviet ﬁlm in which the free
life of the workers under the proletarian dictatorship is vividly
depicted. All these Communists will be animated with one ideal.
They will all work along the same line. They will work hand in
hand with all the workers they are connected with, trying to make
them understand the better ways of struggle and to make their
struggle more effective. At the next unit meeting every comrade
will have to report as to how he or she carried out the assignment.
All the Communist units, forming concentration points of the work-

. ers’ struggle, are engaged in practical everyday work, the more

practical the better, but at the same time they never for a moment
lose sight of the ultimate goal of the movement—the destruction of
capitalism. ' V

When you observe the Communist Party in action you cannot
fail to compare it with the blood-stream of the human body. Like
the blood-stream it brings life to every section of the body of the
working class. Like the blood-stream it helps build up every tissue.
Like the blood-stream it makes the organism live, act, grow.

There can be working class movements without the Communist
Party, but there can be no real movement for the liberation of the
working class without the Communist Party. There can be no
ultimate overthrow of the entire capitalist system without the Com-
munist Party.

Hand in hand with the Communist Party and under its guidance
functions the Young Communist League, the revolutionary organiza-
tion of the young workers. Many other organizations function
under the guidance of and in close cooperation with the Communist
Party. ,

There is a Communist Party in every country of the world. All
of them work for the same end, and all of them adapt their activities
to conditions existing in their country. Delegates from each Com-
munist Party gather once in a few years to an international Com-
munist Congress (there have been six of them so far). The Congress
meets for two or three weeks and discusses thoroughly the inter-
national situation and -the situation in every country. Experiences
of a world-wide struggle are shared and a general line of further
struggles mapped out. The Congress elects an Executive Committee
which is the leading body between one congress and the other. The
decisions of the Executive Committee of the Communist International
guide the activities of the parties. The Executive Committee meets
at intervals of a few months. Its meetings very much resemble a
small congress. Between one meeting and the other a smaller body

‘ 71

 

I _ called Presidium is conducting the affairs of the organization. The
- organization is called the Communist International and expresses _the
common’ purpose and common decisions of all the Communist
Parties of the world. The Communist International (Comintern)
gives unity of policy and leadership to the entire revolutionary
I movement of the world. It is the general staﬁ of the world revolu-
tion of all the exploited and oppressed. ' '
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is aﬂiliated with the
' Communist International." It is the most inﬂuential but not the only
inﬂuential Party in the International. It is one part but not the
whole of the International. Its advice is highly precious because
nit has long accomplished what the Communist Parties of the world
are only striving at—the proletarian revolution. The advice and
experiences of the other Parties, however, are also of great value in
‘determining the policies of the Comintern. The seat of the Comintern
is Moscow because this is the capital of the only workers’ and
peasants’ government in the world, and the Comintern can meet
there freely. As the workers become the rulers of other countries,
‘ the Comintern will not have to conﬁne its meetings to Moscow alone.
The Communist Party of the U.S.A. is thus part of a world-wide
organization which gives it guidance and enhances its ﬁghting power.
"Under the leadership of the Communist Party the workers of the
-_vU.S.A. will proceed from struggle to struggle, from victory to

I victory, until, rising in a revolution, they will crush the capitalist

.jState, establish a Soviet State, abolish the cruel and bloody system
of capitalism and proceed to the upbuilding of Socialism.
This is why every worker must join the Communist Party.

at hand. It is not natural that a government should order the
destruction of three and a half million bales of cotton by plowing
under the year’s harvest on ten million acres of land in the South

,the way it was done by the government of the U. S. A. in 1933,

while so many are badly dressed. It is not natural that there should
be poverty in the midst of plenty. It is not natural that milk

» should be dumped into rivers while babies are_starving. It is not

natural that the most ingenious means of production and transporta-
tion should be rusting away while those who produce them and

' can operate them are being wasted away by starvation and disease.

All this is most unnatural. It is insane.

One word about the law. You have been taught to respect the
law which appears in the shape of the policeman or the judge. You
were taught that this is “justice”. Yet where is the justice of your
being thrown out into the street for non-payment of rent? Where
is the justice of your being dismissed from the mines after many
years of work? When the owner ejects you forcibly from his
premises, this is not called force; when you resist, they say you

are using force and violence. When the sheriff puts your belongings .

on the sidewalks, that’s law. When you break the" padlock and
replace your furniture in.its old place, that’s unlawful. Why is it
that violence against the workers is’ law and resistance to violence
is unlawful? Why is it that robbing you of your only source of life
is justice and protesting against this bloody justice is injustice?
Something is wrong here, too. Apparently, all these notions about
law and order, about justice and injustice, about crime and punish-
ment, are made in the interests, not of you and the like of you,
but in the interests of those who use them against you.

One more instance. The workers declare a strike. They have
been told many times by many ﬁne gentlemen that there is a partner-
ship between the owners and the workers, that they must cooperate
for the beneﬁt of the industry. When partners disagree on a certain
issue they ﬁght out their dispute. Suppose you decide to ﬁght it
out by refusing to work. You are entitled to do so under the law.
You organize a picket line. You say you are partners to this plant
and you want to ﬁght it out with your own employers. The em-
ployers try to bring in scabs. You refuse to admit the scabs into
the plant. Immediately police arrive. The law protects the scabs
and attacks the strikers. If you insist on your right to keep the
plant shut, you are ﬁred at, and the history of strikes in America is
one long trail of bloody murders perpetrated by the police, by the
“law” protecting the scabs. . -

There must be something wrong in a “law” that professes equality

of employer and employee but at the same time uses all its power
to oppress the latter in favor of the former. There must be a

monstrous lie in the statement that employer and employee are

, capitalists, while labor power is a commodity which has to ‘be sold

 
 

State itself apparently is something vicious and cruel and not the"
nice and lovely “institutionof liberty” it is reputed to be.

We think it is urgent for the workers to look more deeply -1I‘lt0 '
these matters. Moreover, it is our deep conviction that workers.
who do not concern themselves with these vital problems are doing
grave harm to themselves and their class. Only, when you under-
stand the malady can you ﬁnd the proper cure.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

II
‘ The Iliagnosis

W0 professors of Columbia University, Adolf A. Berle, Jr.,
and Gardiner C. Means, recently published a book called The
M odern Corporation and Private Property. In it they tried to sum

tive economists came to the conclusion that out of a total of 367
billion dollars that formed the national wealth of the U. S. A. in
1929, 200 big companies held assets amounting to 81 billion or,"
roughly, 22 per cent. How many persons controlled those 200 com-
panies? Possibly no more than 2,000. An insigniﬁcant handful
of people controlling over one-fifth of the Wealth of a country with
a population of over 120 million. The professors call it “concen-
tration of economic power” and they point out that that concentration
is proceeding at a very rapid pace.

“The actual extent to which the concentration of power has
progressed is striking enough”, they say. “More striking still, how-
ever, is the pace at which it is proceeding. In 1909, the assets of
the 200 then largest non-banking corporations amounted _to only 26 ~ '
billion dollars. By 1919 the assets of the 200 largest corporations
had reached 43.7 billion dollars, an increase of 68 per cent in ten
years. In the next ten years from 1919 to 1929 they increased to
81.1 billion dollars, an increase of 85 per cent” (p. 33).

According to the Report on National Wealth and Income pub-
lished in 1926 by the Federal Trade Commission, the richest 1 per
cent of the population in the U. S. A. owned at least 59 per cent
of the wealth; the small capitalists, 12 per cent of the population,
owned at least 31 per cent of the national wealth; the workers and
working farmers and small shopkeepers, 87 per cent of the popula-
tion, owned barely 10 per cent of the national wealth.

This is capitalism in its modern form.

Capitalism is a system of society where all means of production,
factories, mines, railroads, are in the hands of private owners called
