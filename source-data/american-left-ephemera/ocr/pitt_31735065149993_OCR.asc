WASHINGTON, D. C.-—
vMine -' Mill reintensified its
drive in the nation’s capital

' here last month, for federal
.legislation to protect the health
and safety of workers in the
metal mining industry.

; President John Clark spent
a week in Washington, imme-
diately following the Interna-
tional Executive Board meet-
ing, pushing for enactment of
Mine-Mill’s bill for mine safe-
ty and the prevention of indus-
trial and’ occupational disease,
especially silicosis.

He was accompanied in his

Representative Horace White
and Montana Regional Direc-
tor Ernest Salvas.

TOPPING the round of ac-
tivities was Clark's presenta-
tion of testimony on the need
for federal inspection of non-
coal mines to a select Subcom-
mittee of the House Education
and Labor Committee which
held hearings on the bill (HR
5435). Congressman Herbert

Zelenko (D., N. Y.) is chair-
man of the subcommittee.
Introduced in the House of

 

Representatives this year by
Congressman James 0’I{ara of
Michigan and in the Senate by
Senator Lee Metcalf of Mon-
tana, the measure is closely
similar to Mine-Mill’s original
mine safety bill first intro-
duced in Congress by the late
Senator Murray of Montana
more than ten years ago.
Besides presenting the un-
ion’s testimony to the sub-
committee, Clark also dis-
cussed the bill at a separate
meeting with its chairman,
Cong. Zelenko. The balance of
the week was devoted by the

Mine-Mill group mainly to lob-
bying for passage of the bill
with other congressmen and
senators, including Congress-
men Olsen, Montoya, and
Udall, and Senators Mansfield,
Metcalf and Moss.
=l< >l= >l=

AT the same time, to back
up this effort, the national of-
ficers requested all locals to
write or wire their senators
and congressmen urging sup-
portof the mine safety meas-
ure.

subcommittee for the Mine-

Pride in,Union Hall

Pride in their union head-

quarters was demonstrated by
leaders and members of Ray- ‘

Sonora (Ariz.)_Copper Work-

ers Local 915 when they con-

verged on their hall recently
for a complete redecoration
and clean-up of the lawn and
shrubbery surrounding it.
The Mine-Mill building is
considered one of the most at-
tractive and cleanest struc-
tures in the area, and the un-
ion membership showed they
intend to keep it that way.
Volunteers were readily avail-

able when the decorating and -
clean-up work call went out N

for completion of the job prior
to the Kennecott vacation
shutdown on July 2.

F o r m e r President Gilbert
Celis, in urging Local 915
members to get the job done,
said: “This building" belongs
to all of us. We must take
pride in our hall and prevent
it from getting to the point
where it will look like the
Steel local shack just a block
away from here.”

Montana UC

n Cases A ppealed

Some 65 unemployment
compensation cases arising
out of the 1959-60 Anaconda
copper strike are now under
appeal to the Montana Su-
preme Court. The issue arose
during the-strike when many
miners and smeltermen who
obtained ct h er employment
were subsequently denied un-
employment compen-
sation benefits by the Unem-

" ployment Compensation Com- ‘

mission after that
ment terminated.

District court decisions have
overruled the denial of bene-
fits in s-ome of the cases and
upheld the Commission on
others. It is regarding 31 of
the latter cases that Mine-Mill
in Montana is appealing to the
top state court, as well as
fighting the UCC’s appeal of
34 other cases on which the
courts have decided that bene-
fits must be granted.

Attorney Charles V. Huppe

employ-

. is handling the cases for Mine-

Mill. The International Union
has contributed $2,000 towards
the cost of fighting the ap-
peals through, most of which
is beingcarried by the Mon-
tana locals. _ ‘

-While no overall‘ figure has
been given to the dollar value
of benefits involved in the dis-
puted claims, numbering
news-
paper estimates have placed
the amount as high as $70,000.

The state Supreme Court’s
opinion on the issues involved
is expected to clarify a num-

.ber of cloudy provisions in the

Montana Unemployment Com-
pensation law.

Arizona Reader
Writes on "Riders"

An elderly lady who former-
ly'lived in the deep South and
now resides in Globe, Ariz.,
manages to read the Mine-Mill
Union “thereby,” she says,
“g e t t i n g a cross-section of
what people are thinking.”

On reading the last issue

RICARDO CAMPOS, member of Superior (Ariz.) local 938's Safety Com-
mittee and example of a good union steward, feels that his child

"should start wearing the Mine-Mill emblem at an eurlyage. He says

the Mine-Mill button represents job security, better working condi-
tions and the preservation of human rights for both him and his child.
This has been proven for Campos since Mine-Mill came to Superior
three years ago, after Magma Copper had operated in that town

without a union for 45 years.

(July) she sat down and wrote
a letter to the editor, Wh1Cl’1
is quoted in part as follows:
“I was especially attracted
to what was said on page 2,
about the Freedom Riders. I
have thought about this quite
a lot . . . particularly about

how there are various minori-

ties that are fighting _ for
FREEDOM OF CHOICE and
how wonderful it would be if
we could just exchange infor-
mation, and come to see each
others’ viewpoint, and JOIN
TOGETHER, and then, we
could get nearer to that
BROTI-IERHOOD OF_ MAN
under the FATHERHOOD OF
GOD as visioned in the last
paragraph.”

.,,We thank the lady whose
love for the whole human race
is so evident in her letter.

In Washington Scene

INETY-FOUR degrees temperature and the humidity

that goes with it in Washington, D. C., in some ways

must be a factor. in the turmoil that one senses is going
on these days “on the hill.” '

Brother Salvas, White and myself spent a few days
there last month, visiting Senators and Con-
gressmen in an effort to push support for
some of the proposed bills which this Union
is vitally interested in, especially mine safe-
ty on which I presented a statement to a
subcommittee of the House Education and

One wonders at the seeming lack of en- ;

thusiasm on domestic issues facing the
country as a whole. While there is plenty
of lip service, there is a notable lack of push
for the enactment of curative measures.

.. What is disturbing is ‘the obvious. silence
Clark around such issues as the ever-growing un-
employment, the increasing importation of foreign goods pro-
ducedby low-wage countries against which it is impossible for
our workers to compete, and automation with its job-killing
results adding hundreds of thousands to the relief lines.

at _* ir . .
ACK of enactment of social legislation like school aid and
particularly old age pensioners’ medical care which is being
sabotaged by the inhuman tactics of the AMA top leadership
‘and their million-dollar lobbyists—all these are disturbing fac-
tors in the seeming apathy of the taxpayers’ servants on Capitol
Hill. '
One part of the atmosphere is inescapable, and that is the
present ominous trend towards a catastrophe that can well end
in complete oblivion for all. -
Millions of people in all countries——the «greatest majority
living happily, loving their country and the blessings that na-
ture and the advances of_ civilization and progress have given
them——are walking blindly into the grave possibilities of a
nuclear war that can destroy every living thing on Earth.
, ‘Ir * ‘k '
RONICALLY, the impending peril is in the hands of a few

    

world leaders and not the millions of people; a few Who feel .

their control of the destinies of all people of the world is their
right, their right to decide what is the definition of that sacred
word “liberty.” ’ _
The Berlin situation, according to all reports, could be the
trigger to start and also end this impending conflagration.

A disturbing statement by columnist Marquis Childs (which, '

although it has been denied by General LeMay, has not been re-
tracted to my knowledge -by Mr. Childs) is certainly not reassur-
ing to the hopes of all of us for the good "things this life and
this world can accomplish. . ~ ' ,

MR. CHILDS said in his column:

“A small incident illumines the atmosphere of this capital.
At a ‘Georgetown dinner party’ recently, the wife of a leading
Senator sat next to Gen. Curtis LeMay, chief of staff of the Air
Force. He, told her a nuclear war was inevitable. It would be-
gin in December and be all over by the first of the new year. In
that interval, every major American city—Washington, New
York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles—would be re-
duced to rubble. Similarly, the principal cities of the Soviet
Union would be destroyed. - _ '

“The lady, as she tells it,‘ asked if there were any place
where she could take her children and grandchildren to safety;
the general would, of course, atthe first alert beinside the top-
secret underground hideout near Washington from which the
retaliatory strike would be directed. He told her that certain
unpopulated areas in the Far West would be safest. The Senator
dismissed this as ﬂesh-creeping to whicht‘Curt’ and the other
Air Force generals resort at appropriation time.”

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Hopes that House Education Committee approval of a-
3-year $375 million program of federal aid for parochial and private schools would
speed action on the Administration’s Senate-passed top priority 2.5 billion public

Committee.

The Rules Committee,
often referred to as the '
“graveyard of liberal legisla-
tion,” voted 8 to 7-July 17 to
table all -proposals for federal
aid to schools, thus in effect
killing three school aid bills
before it. ‘ ' —

THE three bills, previously
approved bythe House Labor
and Education committee,

- would have provided for gen-.

eral federal aid forschool con-
struction and teachers’ salar-
ies, long-term loans for limi-
ted construction for private as
well as public schools, and
scholarships. Behind the Rules
Committee vote was a contro-
versy over help for church
and other private schools.

Peculiarly enough, the 8 to
7 vote against permitting the
House to act on- school aid
was exactly opposite to the
result expected from liberali-
zation of the Rules Committee
early in the present session of
Congress when the Adminis-
tration succeeded in adding
three members, including two
Democrats, to the committee.

This was hailed at the time

sion. It

has been cool towards the bill,
and that House Majority Lead-
er. John W. McCormack has
been warm against it.

Immediately following — de-

feat of the’bill in Rules, re-
ports circulated that Adminis-

tration’ strategists -were p1an- V

ning maneuvers to revive it for
House action by going around
the Rules Committee.

One maneuver reported un-
der consideration was a
House - squeeze play involving
passage of a separate bill to
extend schoolaid to impacted
areas as a means of going to
conference with the Senate. In
conference, funds for school
construction would be added
to the House bill and the com-
promise would be brought
back for final action.

’ THESE impacted areas are
ones with heavy federal em-

. and then in the House to ap- ~

prove the result. It is felt that

‘ of the eight Rules Committee
hearted support to the Presi- ,

members who voted to shelve .
the Administration’s package. I:
school aid bill, five of them

‘ would find itidifficult to block .

a conference‘ that fwould kill
the impacted areas program
involving 3,500 school
tricts; ’

Three other methods for by- I

. passing the Rules Committee i

have been -mentioned to .pos- -
sibly save the school aid bill. S’

ONE is _a discharge petition S

which would require signa- “

tures of a majority of the -
total House membership. Over,
the years, only two laws have
been enacted by discharge pe-
titions. Chances for success
of -this method at this late

stage of the session are hard-'
ly considered bright. ‘

The two other alternatives

are special parliamentary pro-i
cedures—Calendar Wednesday,

and suspension ofuthe rules. ’

Both are such severely limited
devices that they are hardly
ever called into‘ play. A

Calender Wednesday, used

was last applied ‘before .tha '
in 1950. Suspension of the E
rules requires" ‘a two-thirds
vote, a fatal handicap‘ for con-
troversial legislation.

DENVER———Recognition of the civil rights issue. as one of the most important
and vital of our times was underscored by action of the Mine-Mill Executive Board
at its meeting here July 10-14. ’

Following up a major resolution appr oved by the last International convention

in Tucson, the Board voted to establish a National Civil Rights Committee and

agreed that the union’s top
body itself would constitute
the leadership of the commit-
tee.

Vice-Presidents As-
bury Howard and Al Skinner
and Secretary-Treasurer
ing Dichter were assigned the
specific responsibility for co-
ordinating and developing the
committee’s work from the

national office along with the _

participation ofstaff and local_

Among the chief functions
of the committee will be im-
plementation of civil rights
programs adopted by conven-
tions and area conferences as
well as by the Executive
Board between conventions.

BUTTE, Mont.——Information

was received by Mine-Mill here 1'

late last month that the De-
partment of Interior is pro-
posing to dispose of, or con-
vert to silico-manganese, about

351,000 long dry tons of low- '
grade manganese ore at Butte V

and Phillipsburg.

This can create long-term
employment for from 250 to
500 workers in the Butte area.

widespread p l e a s , including
those from the state’s leading
newspapers, that the case be
reopened.

Although the unionists were
alleged to have conspired to
dynamite buildings of the
struck mill and a power sta-
tion, no dynamiting‘ actually
ever took place.

Several labor papers have

pointed up the parallel be-
tween the “conspiracy” charges

against the Textile ’ unionists-

and those against Mine-Mill
and other unions as examples
of anti-labor prosecutions to
punish unions for crimes never
committed.

New Arizona Public Employees’

TUCSON, Ariz.—Action, to afford local members better understanding of recent

challenges to the state’s new public employees’ loyalty oath law was
Arizona Mine-Mill Council at its last meeting in Miami June 24. " _

Legality of the oath requirement for public employees under an “Arizona Com- 3

lenged by a school teacher

CORRESPONDENCE on
court actions seeking to block
further use of the oath in Ari-
zona was received by the Mine-
Mill council from the Emer-

gency Committee to Defend
Liberties of Arizona Public

Employees which pointed out
that while the oath itself ap-
pears to be an affirmative one,
the law requiring its signa-
ture includes a penalty sec-
tion that perverts the oath
into a disclaimer oath.

After thorough discussion of

the matter, the Council dele-

taken by the

gates acted to invite members‘

of the Committee to speak at
local meetings so that rank
and file members could get a
full understanding of the loy-

alty oath and the challenge _

to it. . ‘

THE 28-year-old teacher told
reporters she had no objection
to signing a simple affirmative
oath, but “I do not feel oaths

IN ADDITION to his review
of Mine-Mill testimony previ-
ously given at other hearings,
Clark presented further evi-
dence which has since become

"aviailable, and blasted several
myths repeated before the
subcommittee by witnesses op-

’ posed to the bill.

One such fallacy, widely cir-
culated, is that accident rates
in non-coal mines are signifi-
cantly lower than in coal
mines, and hence federal in-

_ spection is unnecessary.

Clark b 1 a m e d “statistical
juggling” for the lumping to-
gether of accidental rates
at open pit and underground

, mines, and presented da.ta to

show unsatisfactory and per-
sistently high accident rates
in underground metal mining
——higher than coal mine_acci-
dent rates.

He cited Bureau of Mines
1958 data showing 63,399 pro-
duction workers in all UQS.

non-coal mines, ofhwhom 40,--
315 were employed in under-.

ground metallic mining and

- 6,418 in underground non-me-

talic mining.
* * *

PRESIDENT Clark lowered
"the boomon advocates of
state mine inspection.

“Those who say we should
rely on state inspection and
enforcement know all too well
the ineffectuality pf state in-
spection in ‘nearly every im-
‘portant-mining state,” he de-
clared. “Any reliance on the
states for correction of condi-
tions would be‘ futile. The
codes have varying enforce-
men_t powers of dubious ef-
fectiveness. Even more impor-
tant, nearly every state mine
inspection staff is starved for
funds and lacks trained per-
sonnel and specialized equip-
ment.” .

He pointed out that “oppo-
sition to the bill on the part
of the mine owners is testi-
mony to the effectiveness they

. see it would have in exposing

u n s a f e conditions

in the
‘ mines.” ‘
5!‘ 3!‘ ill

CLARK also based his argu-

' ment for federal mine inspec-

tion on the continued high

‘rate of accidents and of indus-

trial diseases in metallic and
non-metallic mining.

' He cited the increase in the
"number of men drawing state
silicosis benefits in Montana
from 287 in 1942 to 776 in

_‘1961, while over this same pe-

‘   riod of years employment in
K ,

' metal minim: in the state fell

° from 11,969 to 3,900.
Likewise, he cited state and '

U.S, figures to show continued
high. accident rates in under-

 i. ‘g r o u n d mining of copper, _

lead-zinc, gold-silver, manga-

ium and miscellaneous metals.
' Hefound “no downward trend

’ in accident rates in these in-

dustr’ies.”

. HE-also pointed to the ad-
.-mission by federal officials

 i that a high proportion of uran-
 .— iurn mines exceed recommend-
.  \ ed levels of radon gas as point-

ing‘ to the need for federal

; -1-mine inspection.

more adequate budgets and
improved safety code provi-
sions generally yield no re-

sults.”

HE outlined the lack of suc-
cess of a union committee

with representatives of eight
unions in New Mexico, includ-

ing Mine-Mill, in attempting
to get more funds for the
state mine inspector and adop-
tion of stronger state safety
code provisions.

In Arizona, he said lobbying
by the Arizona. Mine-Mill
Council this year for more ap-
propriations for the s t a t e
mine inspector were only par-
t i a l l y successful. Regarding
Montana, he spoke of the re-
jecti-on by the Governor’s Safe-
ty Code Committee of more
than '75 percent of the volumi-
nous recommendations submit-
ted by Mine-Mill local unions
in Monta.na.

"Clark said “our recommen-
dations were, we believe, very
modest; they were based upon
provisions now found in other
state codes and upon stand-
ards recommended by such
agencies as the'American
Standards Association and the
American Conference of Gov-
ernmental Industrial Hygien-
ists.”

“All this frustrating experi-
ence confirms us in our sup-
port of federal mine safety
legislation now,” Clark told
the committee, adding that

. such protection for the health

and safety of metal mining in-
dustry workers is long past
due.

Down to the Wire A

Negotiations between the
copper workers’ union and
Anaconda Company at the El
Salvador mine and Potrerillos
smelter in Chile failed to pro-
duce a new agreement at Mine-
Mill press time. The present

one of the factors in the cur-

For the last 25 years New

hire non-union members for
such jobs. , 

Last year the National Party '
sought the support of white-

permit workers in any indus-

The bill has been denounced

support either from employers
or the newspapers, who fear
passage of the law would
touch off industrial strife.

Regarding the latter ad-
vance, as of now 75 per cent
of this Southwest differential
has been eliminated by Mine-
Mill bargaining in the last
three years. It is expected
that next year’s negotiations
with Kennecott will get rid of
the remaining 25 per cent to

direction of developing uni-
