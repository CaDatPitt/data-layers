Mine—Mill’s pending strike was pledged
last week in a letter to International
president John Clark from Eddie Tan-
gen, Marine Cooks secretary-treasurer.
, “We have studied the issues in-
volved, and certainly no ‘group of
workers in America is more entitled
to achievement of their just demands];
Tangen said. “We know that you are
up against a tough group of employers,
but we are‘ confident that with the
militancy and unity the members of

Mine-Mill have displayed before, you
and they will be completely successful.

“Rest assured that this Union will
support you in every way possible
until victory has been a'chiev»ed.”

Iohn‘ Clark, - author of this
guest editorial. is president of ’
the, International ' Union of
Mine. Mill and Smelter Work-
ers. with headquarters in
Denver.

By Iohn Clark
HEN an 85 percent majority
of 60,000 workers votes to
Walk out on strike to back up
their wage and contract demands,
you may be sure that plenty of
. thought goes into
the voting. ; _

I’ve known thou- ‘

sands of workers
in the half century .
or so I’ve been in l
the labor move-
‘ ment, and I have ,
yet to meet the
worker who likes
to strike.

But the Workers Clark

in the nonferrous metals industry’

have made up.» their. minds that if
they /must strike in order to get a
contract providing for an adequate

wage increase and a decent pension .

plan, they’ll do it. With them that
is a serious business.

.
HY‘ did these’ workers decide to

. walk out on strike Monday, Aug. -

27? . .

They are convinced that a sub-
stantial wage increase is an absolute
necessity. They have seen ‘prices rise
well over 12 per cent since January,
1950, even by the fraudulently low
figures of the bureau of labor statis-
tics.

By last May, a copper miner
had to Work a full two and one-
fifth hours longer in order to
buy the same basket of food he
bought in June, 1946. Price in-

EDITORIAL

This industry has operated on a
forty-eight—hour‘week basis almost
continuously slnce the end of World
War II. Only with the time-and-a-
half for that extra eight hours a
Week can our members maintain the
minimum “health and decency”
standard of living set by the bureau
of laborstatistics.

.They areconvinced the employ-
ers are easily -able to make very/
large concessions in the form -of
wage and other money increases,
without raising metal prices even
a half-penny a pound. The twelve
maid} companies in the nonfer-
rous metals industry last year

-made an average profit of $3,348

for each and every employe. For

Kennecott the profit was $5,875
an em-ploye; for Phelps Dodge it
was $5,786. Yet a wage increase
of 30 cents an hour throughout
the industry would average only
«’ $600 a worker.

Nonferrous metal profits, already
at record levels, are still rising. For
the first half of this year, Anaconda
Copper Mining company profits were

.American industry as a whole. In

to their employes. In one case-—Ana-
conda——they offer nothing.
l{ODUCTIVITY—-the amount of I 
work turned out by each em,-
ployei for every hour on the job—- 
has -gone up fabulously in this indus- . * ' 5 ‘
try. The—bu_reau of labor statistics
just disclosed that productivity in
copper mining went up 14 per cent ,
from 1949 to 1950. That compares ‘» 
with a normal rate of 3 per cent 3: ' I ,
a year increase in productivity for 1 - .‘ I

the smelting and refining sections of - - ’
our industry, the BLS says p1'oduc- = 
tivity went up 10 per cent in 1949- ' - ' A
50. Mine-Mill research department
figures show the jump at 12.2 per
_cent. Our members simply want a.
share in the fruits of their own in-
creased output. __
On-the-job accidents are in- ~- 7
creasing‘ at an alarming rate, as in I ‘
the result of the pressure of metal
employcs for greater and greater
production. In one very large .
mine where our members work,
308 accident injuries were re-
ported in the first seven months
of 1951-against a total working‘ 
force of 425. No wonder this 111- . ' . 
dustry has a "notoriously high "  "
“turnover rate.” Our members .j ,3’
feel that if they are going to I
keep on risking their lives in haz- .3 
ardous jobs, they should be paid '4 9' *
adequately for it.- ' A

801/; per cent above the first six The fact that we have been‘ in   in 3
months of 1950; Phelps Dodge prof- negotiations for more than four and “ if‘ '
its were 93 per cent higher. And a half months is proof enough that _.' _‘ 

last year was the greatest in his-
tory for the metal companies. In the
last quarter of 1950, nonferrous met-
als profits were rolling in at an an-
nual rate of 36.4 cents (before taxes)
on every dollar of investment, and
17.2 cents after taxes. Startling,
isn’t it? Yet these metal magnates
refuse to offer more than a few pal-
try cents an hour in wage increases

we are not “strike—happy,” that we
want very much to reach a settle-
ment of our demands peaceably.
Even though we have actually set a.
strike date, we are still ready and
willing to negotiate with any of the
companies Whenever they indicate 5 » 
they are ready to come through with V ’
an offer that has real meaning to , ,
our members. " . ‘V ,3

Federal Mediation and Conciliation‘ Service
Washington 25, D. C.

 

Kennecott Copper Corporation;

Joint Kennecott Negotiating Committee

Under existing law it is the duty of the Federal Mediation

, and Concilliation Service, in order to prevent*or_ minimize inter-
ruptions of the free flow of commerce growing out of labor

disputes,‘ to assist the parties in industries affecting commerce

to settle such disputes, through concilliation and mediation.

Such a dispute éxists between the Kennecott Copper Corpora-

tion,'Utah Copper Division, andxthe joint Kennecott Negotiat-

A work stoppage growing out of this dispute will notjonly
affect the economy of the country, but will have a devastating
effect upon the national defense effort. .

~As representatives of the Government, ‘ we_,have the re-
sponsibility of seeing to it that no interruption to production
occurs if possible to prevent. The Federal Mediation and Con-
ciliation Service is therefore recommending to the Kennecott
Copper ‘Corporation, Utah Copper ‘Division, and the joint
Kennecott Negotiating Committee that the dispute be settled
,1. The provisions of the existing contract, together
with the ‘changes; tentatively“ agreed upon, «-and the

\ ‘Wage adjustment herein recommended co_nsti.tuterfull

2. The Company grant and the Union "accept an
amountvaveraging sixteen (16)“ cents per hour‘to be
applied to the adjustment of wage rate classifications
and theadjustment of such other economic» matters
‘as the "parties agree upon, in’ addition to the pension
proposals which, have been discussed during negotia-
‘ v. 7

Acceptance ‘of this recommendation is not intended and
is not to be construed as re_lievin'g_eith_er party of their obliga-,
tion-s under the Defense Production Actor _the rules and regui
. lations of the Wage Stabilization Board. ‘ .

will also add to the earnings of

The company also agreed to

BAYARD, N. M. -— Workers at the
Kennecott, AS&R and Peru operations
in this area walked out on strike last
week in protest against a newattempt
by Empire Zinc scabs to provoke vio-

Goforth.

The shut-down began Thu 1' s d a y
morning when word spread through the-
district' that two carloadsof scabs had_
deliberately run down three women on
the picket line," and -a scab had shot
at -and’. wounded a strikernwho ‘was
A nearly, a block away from the picket
:  line_. \ . I ,
:Three women and a man—all on the
“ side of the striking E-Ziworkers-—-were
A hospitalized as ,a result V of the com-
’ pany-inspired violen_ce, all of which‘ was
'. watched by Sheriff Goforth and Under-
- sheriff Louis Brown, who came to; the
‘ picket line area with 15 s“special- depu-
. ties,” one of whom fired a tear-gas‘
, ‘ . bomb at the pickets.

A INT’L PRESIDENT John-Clark, as

' soon as he got word. of the,incident,

sent a wire to N. M. Gov.AEdwin Me-
chem, demanding -that the governor

. take steps aimed at the punishment of

 .Goforth, the sheriff's deputies and the

. strike-breakers “for conspiracy, at-

‘-tempted murder. and ‘assault and bat-

' tery.” I
. , “The time‘has come to end_ this flout-
- , '_ ing of the law by the very men who

are charged with the responsibility of
y ' upholding law and order in Grant
' County,” Clark's wire said. “As Gov-
L ernor of New Mexico, you have a re-

‘ sponsibility to make sure that the
‘'‘Sheriff, his deputies and the gun-toting
1 strikebreakers are punished for these

crimes.” A

. _ The incidents at the end of last week

.. - climaxed a rapid-fire series: of events
‘‘ Twhichiincludedz
_ i  O A National Labor Relations Board
~ trial examiner issued a NLRB“‘com-
" plaint” against Empire Zinc charging
: _~: that the company ‘had engaged in and
'  was engaging in “unfair labor prac-
, 2 tices,’? and that the strike, which be-
g Egan. last October 17 “was caused by
'_.:‘the company's refusal. to bargain in
. ‘good faith.”

The Company was given 20 days to
‘post notices that it would cease inter-
_ ference with its employees or face an
NLRB order requiring compliance.’

./ ‘ QJoe Roach, N. -M. State Police

tions expert”‘flown here from "New_ 

York.‘ to handle the company’s back-’to-
Iwork movement in Jyun,e,. was‘ dis-
coveredby pickets trying to haul scabs
in the back of his car. Theinext day

Graves and S. S. Huyett, manager of 

the strikebound operation,,were istop,- "

ped in_another attempt to__smuggle 
. strikebreakers onto company property.

0 Latest "persons to be arrested were
Simon Molina, strike relief committee
chairman, his daughter,'Carmen, and a
'14-year-old boy, Rudy Chapin. They
were ‘booked by Sheriff Goforth on ‘_
trumped-up charges at almost the-
same timethat four wives of Local
.890 members and two strikers were
jailed for refusing to sign “peace
bonds,” pointing out that they had not
endangered the peace" of the commu-
nity. The six included: Mrs. Henrietta
Williams, Mrs. Mary Perez, Mrs. Vera
Molano, Mrs. Sabina Salazar, Fred
Berreras and Antonio Rivera.

0 An E-Z striker and his wiferwere -
hospitalized when a car driven-by scabs
deliberately turned into the striker’s
"car, and overturned it. Cut and bruised
were Henry Polanco and Anselma Po-
lanco, who were driving to the picket
lines. Scab Marvin Mosely was later‘
overheard phoning Sheriff Goforth and
reporting: “I was in the car.” -We.
started passing, and pulled right into

_ it—— an old Model A. Two people are

in the hospital.”

« The picketline incident last week was
marked by a nightmare of violence.
Among those hospitalized was Mrs.
Consuela Martinez, who was knocked
down ‘by a car when it charged the
picket line, and then run over by both

the car and a truck following closely ’.

behind. The two vehicles also struck
and injured 14-year-old Rachel Juarez,
who had been hit by another scab car
and carried 200 feet several weeks ago. ‘

The violence began when Goforth ap-
peared at the scene of the. picket line,
accompanied by some 25 “deputies,”
and ordered them: “Open the lines. I
don’t care if you have to kill the
women.” _ ’

Ones scab truck driven by Denzel
Hartless ‘deliberately left the road to
strike -64-year-old Bersabe Yguado,
who was sitting on a bench off the
side of the road. Mrs. Yguado and Miss

A Juarez were also hospitalized. .

Clark pointed to the close relation-

by citing the fact that there are 4%.

long-ranged goal isia piogram to elim-
inate the air pollution that leads to the
disease. I

STEVE HARVEY of Butte Miners’
Union, Local 1, emphasized the impor-
tanceiiof better treatment of workers

Canadian Ship-O local -
' hits CCL leadership

KIRKLAND LAKE, On't.—The grow-
ing restlessness of Canadian Congress
of Labor members withltheir top lead-
ership is demonstrated in a letter Just
received by " Mine-Mill Local 240 here.
The Canadian Congress of Labor is
the name used by the C10 in Canada.

The letter came from the Industrial
Union of Marine & Shipbuilding Work-
cts of Canada, CCL affiliate, which
recently ended a strike at St. John,

N.B.- The Mine-Mill local here had sent

a contribution to the ship workers’
strike fund, along with a strong letter
of support. The strike was won July 11.

The Ship’ local’s recordingsecretary,
Ralph Osborne, wrote Local 240, say-
ing: “We wish to point out to you that
the policy of the CCL top leadership
is not necessarily the policy of all the
locals, affiliated with the Congress.
The Maritime Marine Worker's Fed-
eration is convening in August and

our delegates are going to present a ,

resolution before the Assembly asking
that the Federation formally protest

to the Congress the raiding against"

your union and the UE.

“Yours is a very progressive Union_

and we congratulate you on the high

‘standard that you have maintained for

your membership and we wish you
every success in your fight against the
‘raiders.’ ” ’ '

The Truman Administration’s policy

‘toward Asia is “bankrupt.”

That statement is made by William
0'. Douglas, associate justice of the
U. S_. Supreme Court, writing in LOOK
magazine.

Failure-——or refusal—of the U. S.
government to recognizethe facts of
life in Asia may produce “a crusade
against America” in Asia, according
to the liberal .jurist.who has spent
many months"‘travel1ing in the Orient.

As. a nation we’ve relied too heavily
on the military since the end of World
War II. Most people, for example, felt
that General MacArthur understood

_Asia, he goes on. But from his own

observations, he learned that: ’

“in Asia, in the villages. and on the
peasant level, the people do not feel
that Gen. MacArthur either knows or
understand their problems,'nor should
we expect him to. It is the role of a
general to implement poltical deci-
sions, not to formulate them.”

There are three key revolutionary
trendsin Asia, says Douglas, who is
now making his third trip through, the
Orient: “1) an intensive nationalism

born of deep revolt against foreign,

domination; 2) a passionate resolve to
be rid of landlordism; 3) a‘ burning
concept F of equality for ’the‘ colored
races, a“resolve to restore the” colored
people to a place of dignity and re-
spect.” =

“The peoples of Asia,‘ like their an-
cestors, are serfs in a feudal’ system.

Most of; the land is owned by_ a few‘
men. .A nation of millions work for a _
The great

few hundred overlords.
mass 0')‘ peasants are tenants, receiv-
ing meager shares of the crops they
raise and they are eternally in debt
to their landlords. on loans at exhorbi-
tant interest.”

THE U. S. has refused to help these

.people escape from landlorism, deep
- poverty and . endless oppression, the

LOOK article says’. Instead, we have

policy in Asia ‘bankrupt’

lead us into supporting their oppres-
sors.

“We are behind the powers that be,
the vested interests, the landlords of
Asia. We are for anyggroup that is
anti-Communist. Which, means we
have become partners (in the eyes of

the peasants of Asia) with the corrupt "

and reactionary political powers of
that continent,” says Douglas.-

As one example,_ he pointed to our
failure to aid the starving millions of
India until Congress had bickered for
months over terms under which we
would send grain. And, he adds, when
the U. S. announced its support of
the French in Indochina “a shudder
passed through southeast Asia.”

“If any power had done to us what
the French have done .to the people
of Indo-China, we would produce the
most glorious revolution the world has
ever witnessed ; . . The French im-
posed on that area one of ’the most
vicious_colonial systems in all his-
tory.” ‘

The American decision to cross the

38th parallel, writes Douglas, was a
serious mistake. It made the entry of
’the Chinese into the Korean war in-
evitable. It was a-- purely military de-
cision, when what was needed at the
moment was a political decision that
wouldhave called a halt, saved Amer-
.ican lives and sought for a permanent
solution of Korea’s complicated prob-
lems.

"“All the’ dollars and guns we can

furnish will not stop the revolutions _

that sweep that continent . (Asia),”

he goes on. “Ourinsecurity is-not Rus- A

sia’s armed .might. Our insecurity is
our political bankruptcy in influenc-
ing A\sia’s destiny.”

Editor’s Note: The Colorado strikes,
of the early 1900s, culminating in mar-
tial law at Cripple Creek and Tellu-

hundreds of union iners to Kansas
and New Mexico, were preceded by a
strike in Telluride in 1901. The Tellu-
ride -walkout was settled by sensible
action on the part of union officials led
by Vincent St. John, with the aid of
Lt. Gov. D. C. Coates. The following
account of the strike is from the Au-,
gust, 1901, issue of the Miner’s Maga-
zine.

The-strike at the Smuggler Union
mines at Telluride, which culminated"
in the killing and wounding of men on
July 3, is over. The mine is again in
fult operation.

For a long time the'miners on the
Smuggler Union had complained of the:
contract system of paying so‘much.a
fathom for ground broken, because, a

$3.00 per day, the prevailing wages of
the San Juan district.

The contract system was inaugurated . '
by Manager Arthur L. Collins when he‘
took charge of the property for the. pi"
Calumet-Hecla Company. Collins is an
Englishman and had. managed mines .
where the contract system was in. 
vogue in the old country; he‘ came
from the Calumet-Hecla (Michigan)'— 
where work was done on the contract 
system; he had introduced it in the /'
Central City district and destroyed the. f,‘ ,
wages of the district, and thenxwenth
to Telluride and inaugurated the same*
system. It was unsatisfactory-from the A
start and no other mining company
used the system. .

OFFICERS of Telluride_Miners-’ Un- ,
ion had waited on Collins and urg 
the abolishment of the system, but e ,
refused to allow the system to be.-.,,
changed, saying: “I am'the manager of A
the mine and no one else, especially 
unions, can interfere or have anything i
to say.” ' ,.

Seeing no other way to bring about
abolishment of» the system, the union 
ordered a strike, which took effect May. .- 
1, last. From that time until the lat- 
ter part of Jun’e the mine laid idle. .

Late in June Collins began to pick.
up men to work the mine, and‘started
operations- ‘ , Q 

Committees of the strikers vi’sited.,",

who had been appointed as ’ deputy’

the hands of these deputies. ‘ 2 - A’
THE SITUATION became so acute T

a. m. on July 3 and sent a committee
to request the scabs to quit work. .'
They refused and from the best in-
formation _obtainable,, the deputies and
guards opened fire on the strikers and
John Barthel], .a union miner, was shot
through the neck and instantly killedgr
This led to general firing on both sides
which continued for two hours, when"
surrender was grade by the deputies

Ask vote at Canada
@ Metals in Toronto

TORONTO, Ont.—The /organizing
drive in this area has now /resulted in
application for certification of Mine-
Mill as bargaining agency for some
400 workers of the Canada Metals
Company, a subsidiary of U.S.-owned
Na-tional Lead.

The Canada Metals drive, headed by
Int’l rep. George Herman and assisted
by rank-and’-file members of Port Col-
'borne Local 637 and Sudbury Local
598, was conducted in the face of op-
position by the raiding AFL Chemical
Workers Union and a company union
.-A within the plant itself. Despite this
"opposition, a whirlwind Mine-Mill
campaign signed up more than half
the workers within four or five days.

With the Mine-Mill application be-
fore the On ario Labor Relations
Board, both the_ AFL Chemical Union
and the company union filed interven-

\ tion in the hopes of preventing a Mine-

- , Mill’ victory by forcing a three-way
vote. '

V Consolidation work .for the new or-'

, ganization was highlighted by a visit
from newly-appointed District 8 re-
gional director Nels Thibault who in-
stalled the officers of the new Mine-
Mill plant and assisted in setting up a
functioning union apparatus.

‘While waiting for the Labor Board
hearing on‘ the Mine-Mill application
_"“and the two interventions, the organi-

zational drive at this plant is continu-
'.ing with the objective of signing up
the remainder of the workers before
the hearing. \

re re to Timmins miners ,
SUDBURY, Ont.———Substantial finan-
cial assistance for the 1,600 strikers at
the Hollinger gold mines of Timmins
was assured when Mine-Mill members
of Local 598 started weekly contribu-
tions to a strike fund started by the.
local here last week. An initial check
for $250 was sent to the official Steel-
workers strike benefit committee. in
Timmins. . ‘ 4
Despite the fact that the Steel‘lead-
ership of the Timmins strike had
launched a vicious attack on Mine-Mill
following the offer of assistance, Local
598—presi‘dent Nels Thibault declared
that such aid would be forthcoming and
if the official strike benefit committee
of the Steelworkers returned the money,
Mine-Mill will find other means of get-
ting the funds to the strikingminers.
“Our purpose and desire is not to help
Millard personally,” Thibault said. “We
feel certain that he can get by easily
on his various salaries.
“But we ‘do have grave concern for
the welfare of the 1,600 Hollinger min-

ers and their, families. We are behind,

them 100 per cent in their efforts to
achieve decent standards of living. We
are going to make collections from our_
members regularly and will supplement
them by direct contributionsfrom our
local treasury to assist the Hollinger

Record crowd attends

Yellow-knife picnic
’ YELLOWKNIFE, NWT.———The largest
crowd in history was on hand early this
month for the annual , Yelloxxvknife
Miners’ picnic, held at McNiven Beach.
The affair was blessed by good, warm
weather.

The event——which started at. mid-
night with a dance on the beach board-

walk-—included children’s races, a"bingo ~

game, and later an’ impromptu square-
dancing session. ’

The size of the crowd at this biggest
event in Yellowknife history is indicat-
ed by the fact that 1,500 hot dogs were
consumed. The city’s board of trustees
called it a civic holiday, the Union—.
Mine-Mill Local 802-called it Labor
Day, and Northwest Territories Council
declared it a public holiday.

Union members from both the Con
and Giant mines helped organize the

ammoth affair, under the leadership.

took the consequences. The CIO was‘, ‘~-

the very beginning. The ULPC repre-
sented a “unity” of opportunism and
sell-out, a device whereby the AFL and
.CIO attempted--unsuccessfully—to tie
their members even_ more closely than
ever into the D_eniocratic Party ma-
chine. -

The fact that the AFL is now break-
ing away from the ULPC is just one
more indication of the mounting re-
bellion in conservative unions against

the Waf drive policies being followed‘

by their top" lead_ership. They see in
these policies how their own- living
standards and working conditions are

becoming worse and wors_e—and they -

don't like it. Top officials of the AFL,
like Green and Meany, are not pre-
-pared to abandon their cooperation
with the war drive..— But they are con-

vinced that it isl a mistake‘ to remain ._ _ ‘ _ _ ‘ p

p _ _ By Hermon Cloﬂ Y‘ . __ 4 ,
You’d like to know vvhat’s going on in Washington today? Listen __
to this! The new tax bill is before both houses of Congress for con- 1 _
sideration. The House is working on a billwhich calls fora flat 1)21/2 0/of . _ 
increase in your personal income taxes. Whatever you paid last year, '
under the House proposition you’d pay 121A;% more. That goes for  L’
everyone. Tough enough, but you haven't heard the half of it. \ ‘_ ~ ‘ i
‘The Senate decided to propose its own bill. It would call for a
3%: tax on your_ TAXABLE INCOME_.,.,0n/the surface that sounds like‘, ’
I a break over the House bill, doesn’t it? But wait! Let’s figure it out. 5
Under the Senate “bill if you have two kids and make between 3 and ,5 9 
thousand bucks a year, you’d pay 151/; % more than last year, but ‘if, f "f-.&
you make'$100,00'0 a year (no, we know you don’t) and have two kids
you’d pay only 51/2 % more than last year. ‘/ p T-
‘ Yes, this :is the double talk that goes on. Actually. the Senate bill.’-

  
    
       
   
     
      
 
    
       
     

      
     
     
       
         
       
   
           
        
      

of't_he“m’oderate income groups (you and me). But in criticizing the”-r,
Senate bill, we‘don’t mean to suggest _in any way that the House lpiilllfg,
is fair or just. .. _ y ‘ i  
FAR FROM ‘IT. A flat 12%% increase with no‘ consideration for ’ s
the greater bite which the present cost of living takes from the lower  I .
' income groups is just as bad. ,_ ‘ -+ a ~ *
Taxes should be paid by those who are really profiting from the __
present situation. Who? The big corporations and the people with 
‘incomes in the upper brackets. ' ’
Let’s do something about it. Our whole union is engaged in a‘ 
struggle right now to make life just‘"a little bit easigr for each one '1
of us. But if the present tax bill goes through (either the House or.  "
the Senate version) We take‘ a cut before we begin. -“

"Right now’ Sit down and write your: Senators and Congressmen."-
