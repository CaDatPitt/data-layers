nniversary

To Be Celebrated at Denver Convention

DENVER—The 70th anniversary of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers will be celebrated at

the Union’s International Convention to be held here starting March 18.

Greetings from many other unions, organizations and individuals paid tribute to the distinguished history of Mine-
Mill as one of the-oldest, most militant and most democratic unions in the United. States and Canada.

Guest speakers will be James R. Hoffa, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Albert
Fitzgerald, President of the United Electrical, Radio and Ma chine Workers, Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conf

Democrat of Texas.

A special panel on safety will be held during the first afternoon of the Convention.
Business of the Convention will include discussion and decisions on bargaining objectives for next year, legislative

and political action plans,
decisions on defense of the
Union, civil liberties and
civil rights. Also on the
agenda will be nomination
of officers, on the basis of
the new officer structure
and districts approved in
the 1962 referendum. If
constitutional changes are
proposed they will be acted
upon by the Convention
and referred to referendum
if approved.

The Officers’ Report to
the Convention speaks with
pride" of the Union’s 70-year
history:

“It was from Denver that
our national leaders were
kidnapped over half a cen-
tury ago to stand trial in
Idaho on trumped-up
charges; it was to Denver
that they triumphantly re-
turned a year later after
vindication in memorable
court battles. It was from
Denver that our Union first
pushed out from its moun-
tain base to organize the
miners, mill and smelter
workers in the Southwest,
the Pacific Coast and Alas-
ka.”

WASHINGTCN, D. C.——An early retirement bill based on proposals developed by Mine-Mill
has again been introduced into Congress by Rep. Joseph M. Montoya (Dem.) of New Mexico. The
bill, identical with the one introduced last year, would provide for retirement at age 60 for min-

ers and others in occupations dangerous to health and safety.

If passed, the law willenable workers on such jobs to retire, if they choose, five years earli-
er but with the same benefits as the Social Security Act now provides for those retiring at 65.
Early retirement in certain occupations is part of the welfare legislation of more than a score

of advanced industrial nations and is endorsed

THE PROPOSALS em-
bodied in the bill were dis-
cussed at the Mine-Mill con-
vention in Tucson two years
ago, subsequently were
drafted in bill form by the
Union R e s e a r c h Depart-
ment and approved by the
Ex e cut i ve Board.‘ They
were reviewed by the draft-

by the Int’l Labor Office (see list, Page 2).

ing section of the House of
Representatives.

Most hazardous occupations,
based on fatal and disabling
accident rates, are mining and
quarrying, police and firemen,

heavy construction, logging and .

sawmill work, beet sugar refin-
ing, stevedoring and operation
of harbor vessels.

The legislation is in the form
of an amendment to the Social
Security Act. Under congres-
sional rules, it must first be
passed by the House before be-
ing considered by the Senate.

‘kit

THE BILL calls for investiga-
tions for the purpose of designat-
ing hazardous occupations. It

specifies that weight shall be
given in these proceedings to
such factors as fatal and dis-
abling accident rates, occupa-
tional mortality, incidence of dis-
abling occupational diseases and
physical ability of older workers
to perform duties involved.
As law, it would authorize re-
tirement at age 60 with full

Metcall Blasts
Survey Report
On Silicosis

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Sena-
tor Lee Metcalf (Dem., Mont.)
last month delivered a blast
from the Senate floor against a
U. S. Public Health Service re-
port whitewashing the silicosis
situation in industry.

The report, supposedly based
on a survey under way since
1958, was entitled “Summary of
Findings in the Revaluation of
Silicosis in the Metal Mining In-
dustry—A Joint Study by the
Division of Occupational Health.
Public Health Service, and the
U. S. Bureau of Mines.”

Senator Metcalf was especial-
ly critical of the conclusion:

“Review of all available evi-

V dence suggests that the medical

and engineering controls adopt-
ed by the mining industry have
proved to be effective in the
control of silicosis. Indeed, it is
possible that in another decade,
with continued vigilance, this
disease may have little signifi-
cance as a health problem in the
metal mining industry.”

Survey Incomplete
Not only do the results of the
survey fail to support these con-

, ' clusions, but as Senator Metcalf
_ points out, the survey was in-

complete in that it failed to cov-
er miners with silicosis who are
no longer employed in the
mines. The Senator lists other
technical objections to the meth-
ods used in conducting the sur-
vey.

Mine-Mill protested the re-
port’s conclusions in a meeting
with representatives of the Pub-
lic Health Service and the U. S.
Bureau of Mines on January 31.
The United Mine Workers’ Wel-

, fare. and Retirement Fund has
' ~ ya protested also. .

The bill is intended to be ap-
plicable to miners and to mill,

WITH ITS REFERRAL to the
House Ways and Means Commit-
tee, steps are being taken to have
reports on the bill prepared by
the Social Security Board, the
Public Health Service and the
U. S. Department of Labor.
These reports, it is anticipated,
will help to lay a solid factual
base for congressional: commit-
tee hearings on the measure.
Mine-Mill will enlist the sup-
port of unions representing

 Reintrocluced  

workers in other hazardous jobs
at the hearings in a final legis-
lative drive for enactment.

REP. MONTOYA is a long-time
friend of Mine-Mill. He has
shown a keen interest in non-
ferrous metals industry legisla-
tion and la b o r and welfare
measures. Montoya twice was an
honored guest speaker at Mine-
Mill conventions——at Tucson in
1961 and Denver in 1958.
Mine-Mill President John

union membership, has ex-
pressed appreciation for the con-
structive interest demonstrated
by Montoya in the welfare of
workers. ’

MADISON, Wisc.——“Step up
to the Bar, men!”

That's what the state Su-
preme court has ordered all
lawyers in‘Wisconsin to do.
By the Bar they mean the
State Bar association, which
all the state’s lawyers are
obliged to become members of
in the country’s tightest union
shop.

Under the court’s order,
none of Wisconsin's more
than 5,000 lawyers are per-
mitted to practice their pro-
fession without joining and

paying dues to the State Bar-

association. Before the court
acted in favor of the organized
members of the bar, less than
half the lawyers in Wisconsin
had joined the voluntary as-
sociation.

If it’s good enough for law-
yers in Wisconsin, what right
have “right-to-work” propa-
gandists to talk about “com-
pulsory unionism?” '

In Washington State
Sets Legislative Goals

OLYMPIA, Wash.—A United Labor Lobby com-
posed of all unions in this state was set up last month at
a meeting here attended by 79 delegates. Mine-Mill was
represented by James Buck, Board Member, and William
E. Lee, Business Agent of Tacoma Smelterman’s Union,

Local. 25.

Major legislation to be pushed by the Lobby includes:

0 Increase in the taxable
wage base on unemployment
compensation to insure sound-
ness of the fund and make pos-
sible increases in benefits from
$42 to $49 a week.

0 Elimination of certain
disqualification provisions in
the unemployment compensa-
tion law.

0 Coverage for public em-
ployees, agricultural workers,
employees of nonprofit institu-
tions, for unemployment bene-
fits. .
Disability Compensation

Introduction of an off-the-job
injury or illness compensation
bill. This would be financed by
1% of the first $3,600 of an em-
ployer’s payroll.

Workmen's Compensation

0 A flat increase in the lump
sum settlements under Work-
mens’ Compensation for per-
manent injuries of 40 to 50 per-
cent.

0 Partial permanent disabil-
ity pension.

0 Extension of coverage un-

der Workmen’s Compensation
to a number of occupations not
now covered.

O-Legislation to regulate at-
torney fees in the handling of
Workmen’s Compensation cases,
with payment to be from the
fund rather than from the award
granted the employee.

Officers

Joe Davis, President of the
Washington State Labor Council,
was elected Chairman of the
United Labor L o b b y; Norm
Schut, Executive Secretary of
the Federation of State Em-
ployees, was elected Secretary.
A Steering Committee was ap-
pointed by Davis, as follows:

ll Washington Roundup l‘

WASHINGTON, D. C.——With the filibuster ended

and committees organized, congressional legislative ma- o

chinery finally began rolling. Hearings, mostly on the
House side, ranged from booze to bread, debt limit to
draft, and working mothers to missiles. ‘
Other top subjects included the President’s Youth
Opportunities bill, a $15 billion military procurement
authorization, aid for education and the tax program.

Many who had been critical of
Administration foreign policy
came to the support of the Pres-
ident against attacks from those
who, as one Senator put it, were
“running around with do-it-your-
self CIA kits” trying to out-spy
the U. S. military and to push
this country into an invasion of
Cuba and a third world war.

New Line on Tax Cut

Seldom has a major Adminis-
tration proposal been in worse
trouble than JFK’s tax program.
It’s being flayed from every
side, so much so that the debate
begins to sound like a bar-room
donnybrook. What will come out
of it all is anyone’s guess.
Kennedy himself now says

 

RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT FOR ‘STEEL RAID-
ERS? This gadget was purchased by the otticers
ot the raiding Steel Local Union at Sudbury, Ont..
during the time they had possession of the Union

‘ hall last year’. Following a Labor Board-supervised

election in November which was won by the Mine-
Mill candidates, they took possession ot the hall,
made an audit and inventory, and found this piece
of spying equipment, used by Don McNabb. presi-
dent of the raiding Steel local. What appears to be
a watch is a very sensitive microphone. The white
box is a tape recorder equipped with a harness so
that it can be worn under clothing. Last year's Con-
vention delegates should remember McNabb and a
few other raiders who sat as visitors in the balcony
ot the convention hall at the King Edward Hotel in
Toronto. Stepsare being taken to recover money
spent on this kind of thing.

Utah Local Files Unfair
Charges at Kennecott

MAGNA, Utah-—Charges of
unfair labor practices were
filed against Kennecott last
month by Arthur-Magna Mill-
men’s Local 392.

The issue started with a com-
pany announcement of a cut-
back in the foundry with 18
men laid off and that relief time

would be cutso that men who ,

were working one hour on and

one hour off would have one;

hour on and 15 minutes off.

The Union demanded nego-
tiations, since these changes
affect working conditions. When
this was denied, charges were
filed with the NLRB. After the
NLRB investigator had recom-
mended that a hearing be held,

the company asked Local'392 to ‘

drop the charge and negotiate.

Kennecot:t’s next move was to
announce that it would change
relief time to one hour on and
one-half hour off and would put
three men back in the foundry.

The Union of course replied
that this was not bargaining. At
press time for The Mine-Mill
Union, the issue had not been
resolved. ,
Local 392 has had the help
of Reg. Dir. Verne Curtis and
Int’l Rep. G. L. Buckner in

this case.

he’s ready to settle for a scaled» ‘L

down tax cut this year and, no
reform. He’s also tossed aside
the argument that the tax pro-
gram is needed to promote eco-
nomic growth; the new line
holds that it will ward off a de-
pression.

Meanwhile, the powers-that-be
parade before the House Ways
and Means Committee, arguing
every facet of fiscal policy ex-
cept what would be good for the
working people.

The Items To Be Trimmed

As the tax debate proceeds, so
does the howl to reduce Federal
spending. For an idea of where
the savings would be made, lis-
ten to the Council of State Cham-
bers of Commerce-—a body that

reflects the sentiments of the ~

“economizers.”

Here are some proposed re-
ductions: $121 million from the

school lunch program; $148 mil- .

lion from aid to Federally-in»
pacted. school districts; $493 1nil-
lion from public assistance; $762
million from grants-in-aid pro-
grams; $776 million from public
works;
National Institutes of Health.

And so it goes-—the catalogue
of items that are bankrupting
the country.

New Hospital Plan

The Administration’s hospital
care program for the elderly is
once again before Congress. It
was proposed in a special mes-
sage that listed 36 other recom-
mendations to help the Nation’s
senior citizens.“ The social se-
curity health insurance plan of-
fers‘ some changes from last
year’s bill, especially in benefit
structure.

Sen. Anderson and Rep. King,
co-sponsors of the previous bill.
joined in introducing the latest
version. Nothing will happen on
this proposal before summer or
early next year. It is also evi-
dent that opposition remains
strong, and that passage of the
hospital insurance bill next
year will demand decisive lead-
ership from the President, along
with mass pressure from the
grass roots. ’

The New Uncrowned King _

Ever since Sen. Kerr died,
Washington has wondered who
would succeed him as the Sen-
ate’s “uncrowned king.” Sen.

Richard Russell, the longtime-

Dixiecrat po werhou s e, now
seems to be filling the role. He
is chairman of the powerful
Armed Services Committee and
has also taken over as head of
the potent defense appropriation
subcommittee.

A Biographical Sketch

WHO IS

HOFFA?

Too many union members, along with the rest of the
population,. know Jimmy Hoffa only from the picture
painted of him by anti-labor newspapers, magazines and

newscasters.

Any local union shop steward or other labor leader
who has been singled out by the company for punishment
in an effort to hurt the union can understand the cam-
paign against Hoffa. James R. Hoffa, as General Presi-
dent of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is
head of the largest union in North America, with 1,720,-
000 members. He is the most militant, effective leader of
a major union; the anti-union pressure against him is

correspondingly great. '
Who_i_s Hoffa?

Miner's Son ,

To understand what makes
Jimmy Hoffa tick, why he is
still the target of the big guns
of politicians, one must look
into his background and ex-
amine it in the light of trade

‘unionism as a whole.

Hoffa was born February 14,
1913, in Brazil, Ind., the son of
John Hoffa, a driller inthe coal
fields of Illinois, Kentucky, and
Indiana. When Jim my was
seven, his father died. He had
breathed too much coal dust in
the mines.

Mrs. Hoffa moved Jimmy, his
two sisters and a brother to
Clinton, Indiana, and took in
washing to pay for their
keep. From that day, Jimmy
had to work hard. After school,
he strung clam lines in the river
and ran errands to help sup-
port the family.

Worked at 12

In 1928, when Viola and her
children settled on Detroit’s
West Side, Jimmy was only 12
years old. But even at the age
when other youths his size were
on the sandlot mimicking the
mannerisms of famous athletes,
Jimmy‘ had experienced the
rigors of long hours of work,
low pay and no job security.

He enrolled in the Ninas school
and went through the seventh
grade. But for him, circustance
had placed a poor priority on
formal education. His mother
worked long hours in a nearby
factory where the pay was low.
The family lacked many neces-
sities of life and knew no lux-
uries.

At 16, Jimmy went to work
as a stockboy in a department
store. A year and a half later,
he took a job at the Kroger
warehouse, unloading boxcars.
Each day he reported at 4:30
p.m., received 32 cents an hour
for time worked.

Firsf Strike

“You stayed as long as they
wanted to keep you,” he recalls.
“But you got paid only for the

hours you actually worked. The -

rest of‘the time you just sat
around, waiting for more box-
cars to come in.” If his fellow
workers thought conditions were
bad, Jimmy knew they were in-
tolerable. So, at 17, he led his
first strike, won it, and plunged
headlong into the labor move-
ment.

A load of strawberries ar-
rived at the warehouse. Jimmy
led a strike. He demanded a
raise in pay, better working con-
ditions, an insurance plan.
Threatened with the loss of a

perishable cargo, management
held out only an hour.

Jimmy Hoffa had negotiated
the first of thousands of con-
tracts he has obtained thus far
in his career. Later, this group
was chartered as a Teamsters
local and Jimmy went on the
staff as an organizer.

Tough Times

Those were tough times for
labor. During Jimmy’s organ-
izing drive, union automobiles
were bombed, its office was ran-
sacked. Policemen played a
nightstick tatoo on organizers’
skulls.

“They hired thugs who were
out to get us,” Jimmy says.
“Brother, your life was in your
hands every day. There was
only one way to survive—fight
back. And we used to slug it out
on the streets. They found out
we didn’t scare.”

During the strike of 1939 Hoffa
was jailed 18 times within 24
hours for picketing. As soon as
he got out of jail he would re-
join the pickets. To Jimmy
Hoffa, the number of arrests

-was of minor importance, prin-

ciple was. “We picketed for a
year and a half, and we won
the strike.

Teamster Leader

He established the -- Michigan
Conference and the Central
States’ Health and Welfare
Funds. The latter covers more
than 90 per cent of the over-the-
road Teamster members in 23
Midwest and Southern states.
He also negotiated a pension
plan which today pays a mem-
ber with 20 years service $200
a month at age 60.

In 1948, then 35, Jimmy was
appointed one of three Interna-
tional Union trustees by the late
President Dan Tobin. At the
1952 Convention in Los Angeles,
Hoffa was selected ninth vice
president of the International
Union.

A Dynamo

In 1958, he became General
President. Today, at 49, Hoffa
is the same dynamo he was at
17. He works 12 hours a day,
neither drinks nor smokes, has
no taste for going out on the
town. He and his wife, Jose-

phine," still live in a modest‘

brick home he purchased in 1939
for $6,800. They have a married
daughter and a son who is a
student at Michigan State.
Hoffa has often made it clear
he doesn’t care what a McClel-
lan or an Eastland thinks of him.
But he cares what a rank-and-
file member thinks of him. Even
today he knows more members
of his Detroit local by their first
names than officials in daily
contact with. the membership.

what is just and what is our
due, and which we will not be
denied.

While we meet in Convention
the entire trade union move-
ment faces mounting problems.
During a period of so-called
prosperity unemployment con-
tinues at an unprecedented rate.
Pending in Congress are bills
to ban national bargaining,
compel arbitration in ‘ disputes
affecting the “national inter-
est,” further limit the use of
Union funds, and a host of oth-
er bills equally crippling;

There is a drive on in Con-
gress-—as so aptly put by Presi-
dent Joseph Curran of the Na-
tional Maritime Union — to
“company unionize” the trade
union movement.

Sections of the trade union
movement have been sharply
critical of the failure of the Ad-
ministration to realistically

grapple with the unemployment.

problem. The President’s tax
program which he proposed to
stimulate the economy and ulti-
mately r e d u c e unemployment
has been challenged by Walter
Reuthpr as being “far too con-
servative to meet the nation’s
needs.” Reuther, on behalf of
the Industrial Union Depart-
ment of the AFL-CIO, has urged
that tax reductions be immedi-
ate rather than stretched over
a three~year period, that the
lower income groups receive
greater consideration in the re-
ductions, and that in addition
the government embark on a
major increase in public spend-
ing to meet “our social defi-
cits” in fields like education,
health, and urban renewal.

More Jobs Needed

Reuther further called for a
shift in the Administration’s
wage policy to encourage Un-
ions to seek higher pay. At
present the Administration is
putting on a great deal of pres-

sure to limit increases to the"

so called “productivity” in-
crease. He called for a change
in the Administration’s attitude
on the shorter workweek and
legislation to cut the workweek.

The Department of Labor esti-
mates we will need some 13
million more jobs by 1970 to
keep up with the growth of the
labor force. In addition, we will
need two million additional new
jobs annually to offset the job
losses from technological
changes or automation. Some
recognition of the enormity of
this problem is the fact that
within the past five years our
economy has averaged only 258,-
000 new jobs annually.

Shorter Work Week

More and more sections of
the labor movement are com-
ing to the understanding that
one of the primary solutions of
the unemployment problem,

whether present or future, is
the shorter workweek.

Today -even George Meany,
for a long time lukewarm to
the shorter work week, stands
by that position. With 5.8% of
our work force unemployed,
understated by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, and with the
certainty ' that this figure will
grow larger, the need to insti-
tute the 35-hour week is no

longer-' a long-range perspective‘

but an immediate objective.

Automation and its conse-
quences are a national problem.
If the government bears re-
sponsibility for our “national
security” then it must bear re-
sponsibility for our “job se-
curity.” -

Only a program which sets
as its immediate goal: the 35-

__ hour week, a more equitable

tax reduction program, in-
creased spending for public
works, medicare, upward re-
vision of present standards of
unemployment insurance, re-
training and relocating workers
as a permanent part of our so-
cial security system, and an
earlier retirement age, can we
hope to deal with this problem.

It is the obligation of the
trade union movement to make
the President and Congress as-
sume this responsibility.

Anfi-Labor Bills

To merely list some of the
proposed and pending anti-labor
bills in Congress would make
any trade unionist’s hair stand
on end. Senator John L. McClel-
lan has a bill which would
«place Unions in the transporta-
tion industry under the. Anti-
Trust law.

This bill would make it un-
lawful for “any Union acting. in
concert with any other labor
union, even if it is a sister
local of the same national or
international, union, to partici-
pate in a strike in the transpor-
tation field or engage in picket-
ing, boycotting, or issuance of
an unfair list.”

Violations would be punished
by a one-year, imprisonment
and a $50,000 fine. Among the

' co-sponsors of this bill is Sena-

tor Amos 0. Eastland of Missis-

sippi.

March On Washingfon
James Hoffa, President of the

Teamsters Union, recently pro-

posed a march on Washington
in opposition to this legislation.

Unfortunately, his proposal has

not been picked up by the labor
movement as a whole. As the
years go by, seemingly the
lobbies, legislative conferences,
and other forms of petition by
labor grow fewer and fewer.
Unions which in previous years
held regular Washington lob-
bies of rank-and-file members
and local leaders have dropped
them. Is it any wonder that the

onncnns BEPOBT—CONTINllEl)     1

voice of big business grows

 
 

stronger in Congress. . , ' '

We like the idea of a na-
tional labor lobby in Washing-
ton. But we see no reason that
it be only defensive. Such a lob-
by should not only concern it-

self with defeating pending anti- .

labor legislation but should deal
positively with the other major

' problems facing the labor move-
ment and the American peo- . *

Your officers propose that
major emphasis be given to

tackling all of the problems re-‘ '

lated to job security at the bar-
gaining table next year. We.
need protection against loss of
jobs due to automation and
mechanization. We must stop
company attempts to break
down long established work
standards and practices.

Our members must have
greater security against ‘peri-
odic layoffs that are made as a
result of rigid and monopolistic
pricing. policies pursued by the
Copper Trust in utter disregard
of national policies and the wel-
fare of their employees.



Your officers propose‘ that .-

formulation of our demands re-
lated to job security be given
high priority by all local. un-
ions and bargaining councils.
Among other objectives,‘ we be-

lieve that consideration must -

be given to several of the fol-
lowing proposals.

1. Double overtime pay for all
overtime in excess of 8-hours
per day or 40 hours per week.

2..An industry-wide program of
supplemental benefits, and
severance pay for all laid-off.
workers, regardless of cause.

M3. Firm agreements that no

workers with one or more
years of seniority will be laid
off before company-wide. op-
erations are reduced to a

32-hour standard work week, ~-

and that workers employed
less than 40 hours per week
shall be paid for one-half the
difference between 40 hours
and actual hours under 40
worked.‘

4. Special three-month vaca-
tions for every worker with
15 years seniority to be re-
peated every five years.

These vacations would be in 5
addition to regular annual va- « ..
cations as set forth in our 1

contracts. V "
5. Overhauling of pension plans
to provide: - I '

of pensions, without actu-
arial adjustment, that
would have accrued to age

Union Defense
These events of the past year
should establish beyond any

reasonable doubt what the In-

Officers said last
the time the

ternational
September at

’ .» Justice Department announced

-it would retry the conspiracy
case:

“There never was a con-
spiracy as charged and no of-
ficial of this union ever en-
gaged in any such conspiracy.
The whole procedure has been
a vengeful persecution of Mine-
Mill.

“During the past 10 years,
our Union‘ has been subjected

‘ tothe most brutal legal prose-

cution ever experienced by any
labor organization in the coun-
try. We can only conclude-that
today’s action is continued
legal harassment for harass-
ment’s sake.

I Labor Support

Thousands of people in and
out of the trade union move-
ment, who have acquired some
understanding of this continuous
harassment of Mine-Mill, now
recognize this conspiracy
against our Union as a fact.
The growing recognition of this
fact in the labor movement has
resulted in constantly increas-
ing support for the defense of
‘Mine-Mill in these cases. Hun-
dreds of local unions, central
labor councils, and 15 interna-
tional‘ unions are now on record
condemning these attacks
against Mine-Mill, and in one
form or another supporting the
defense of this Union. Many
other prominent individuals and
liberal organizations outside of
the ‘trade union movement have
spoken up and come to our de-
fense. Labor leaders, lawyers,
and many people concerned
with civil liberties simply can-
not "understand the decision of
the Justice Department to retry
the seven remaining defendants
in the Conspiracy Case.rO.n the
face of it, it seems to be an
extremely ridiculous decision
motivated solely by a vindic-
tive determination to continue
the harassment of our Union.

O_'I'her Unions AH'ae:k'ed
The many years of hounding

and persecution by the govern-

ment against Harry Bridges and
other officers of the Longshore—
men finally came to an end

‘when it became obvious that

they couldn’t split or break the
Longshoremen’s union. The cur-
rent campaign by ‘government
forces to get James Hoffa and

S fsplit the Teamsters union will
 someday come to an end when

the forces involved become con-

‘vinced they can’t succeed. Like-

wise, the harassment and perse-

' cution of Mine-Mill will some

day end when those same peo-
ple decide that such attacks
cannot split or break this union.

The splendid support of the

 Mine-Mill Defense Fund by 10-
. cal unions, officers and staff

representatives within the Un-
ion, and the continuous growth
of support outside the Union
and‘ in‘ the labor movement

generally has brought honor '

and respect to Mine-Mill. Scores
of unions and union leaders

, have. said publicly that Mine-.
’ . ’Mil_l’s fight is a fightin; behalf

-of the entire labor,‘ movement.--_

A and so it is.

Civil Liberties  

No" Union in America has had

to bear the brunt of reaction as

-~ has our Union. Over the years
= we -have been victimized by
 -sthe Taft-Hartley Act and the
.; ‘Mccarran Act. We have suf-

   

fered from ’ the -climate created
by a host of laws which have
eroded the Bill of Rights and
infringed the civil liberties of
all Americans. Our leaders- and
members have been haledj be-
fore the House Un-American
Activities Committee ,and the
Senate Internal Security Com-
mittee. We have been hampered
and restricted in the work for
which we are organized—to im-
prove the wages and working
conditions of our membership.

The House Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee’s latest and
most disgraceful assault against
the civil liberties of the Ameri-
can people was its attempt to
bully and discredit the courage-
ous Women’s Strike for Peace
movement last December. The
women of the movement were
subpenaed, and under the glare
of klieg lights and flash bulbs,
appeared before the Committee.
The committee came off second
best. Women’s Strike for Peace,
in a statement issued when the
subpenas were served, said:

“With the fate of humanity
resting on a push button, the
quest for peace has become the
highest form of patriotism. We
believe that nuclear war is the
greatest enemy of the American
people.

‘We Do No!’ Fear ideas’

“We submit that it is not we
women who should be ‘investi-
gated’ but those who, with the
cool logic of madness, attempt
to reconcile us to complete de-
struction. ,

“Our ‘crime’ is to cry aloud
that nuclear war should not be
permitted, and we shall con-
tinue to cry aloud with all our
strength. ’

“We do notfear the contami-
nation of ideas; we fear the
conspiracy of silence. The time
is long past when a small group
of censors can silence the voice
of peace. To muzzle honest de-
bate in the name of national
interest is to do our country,
and the world, a fatal disserv-
ice.”

As -an editorial i-n the Interna-
tional Longslioremen’s and
Warehousemen’s Union paper,
The Dispatch, observed, “What
a force it could be if the na-
tional labor movement had the
same attitude.” o

No Special Cause

We plead no special cause but
the cause of our country when
we seek the repeal of every law
which limits the right of an
American to think as ‘he sees
fit, to speak freely, to join
whatever organization he
chooses, to write in freedom——

in effect, to enjoy the privileges
of our Constitution. --

We seek the abolition of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee and its counterpart,
the Senate Internal Security
Committee. We seek the repeal
of the Smith'A'ct. the McCar-
ran Act,‘ the Taft-Hartley’ Bill,
and the Landrum-Griffin Bill.
All of them place restrictions
on our basic Constitutional liber-

ties.
Civil Rights

We have a special responsi-
bility in the fight for civil rights.
We are and remain the dominant
Union in the Rocky Mountains.
The fight for civil rights is a
national fight and will be won
when it is won everywhere.
Vestiges of discrimination both
on the job and in the commun-
ity prevail throughout the West.
Its elimination in the communi-
ties where we live can best be
done with our help and we
should give it without hesita-
tion. We can assist in the cam-
paign to secure passage of the
24th Amendment to the Consti-
tution which would bar the poll
tax, in every State ‘Legislature.
We can press for the elimina-
tion of discrimination in hous-
ing, jobs, and elsewhere,
through State legislation.

Dr. Martin. Luther King, in
his speech before the AFL-CIO
in 1962, stated our feelings on
theneed for labor and the Ne-
gro people to work togethe
when he said: -

“To find a great design to
solve a grave problem labor
will have to intervene in _the

political life of the nation to"

chart a course which distributes
the abundance to all instead of
concentrating it among a few.
'I‘he»strength to carry through
such a program requires that
labor know its friends and col-
laborate as a friend. If all that
I have said is sound, labor has
no firmer friend than the 20
million Negroes whose lives will
be deeply affected by the new
patterns of production.” ’

Labor’: Responsibility
The trade union movement
has an extraordinary responsi-

bility in this. situation——the re- T

sponsibility is to help end dis-
crimination on the job and in
the trade union movement. To
date the trade union movement
has made little use of the Presi-
dent’s Order or the Committee.
Most of the complaints against
discrimination have been made
by the Negro people them-
selves.

There is no doubt that one of

Tciylor-Knapp's True Fissure and
' Cliff Mines

T HE True Fissure and Cliff lead-zinc-silver and manganese
mines were surveyed by the Bureau of Mines last year. The report
of the survey listed 79 recommended safety improvements. Among
these were: -

O The compressor airnintake should be extended outside of the
compressor building to insure pure air entering the compressor.

0 The maintenance platform at the sheave wheels of the shaft
headframe should be provided with handrails.

O The approach trestle at the waste rock bin should beiprovided
with handrails and adequate floorings should be provided where
mine cars are dumped. 

O Guards should be provided at the following equipment: pri-
mary crusher drive and motor pulleys and belts; gear drive at
trommel screen; conveyor pulley and drives where washed ore is
dumped; and the electric slusher hoist rope. ‘ ‘ '

0 Safety glasses should be kept available at the grinding. wheel.

0 All buildings within a radius of 100 feet from any mine open-
ing should be of fireproof or fire-resistant construction.

I Fire extinguishers should. be inspected and tested at least
once each 6 months, and a dated record should be attached to each
extinguisher tested.

0 Compressor oil kept at the compressor building should be
removed and -stored at the oil house, and only a 2- to 3-day supply
kept at the compressor building.

0 Water-fire-fighting equipment should be provided at the sur-
face plant.

O The old explosives and capped fuseat the hydrant shelter-of
the washing plant should be destroyed. it ’

O A second hoistman should be in attendance at all timeswhile
men are being hoisted or lowered unless the hoist is’ equipped with
automatic overwind, overspeed and automatic stopcontrols.

O A second escapeway should be provided from the Cliffmine
workings to the surface.

0 Mechanical ventilation should be provided at the 804 drift
west workings to maintain at least 30 f.p.m. velocity of air in work-
ing places after blasting.

0 Management should consider the installation of water toilets
at the washing plant and True Fissure mine changeroom and at the
Cliff mine changeroom.

Kennecoh"s Chino Mine

THE U.S. Bureau of Mines report on its health and safety survey
of the Chino open pit copper mine at Santa Rita, New Mexico, lists
two safety improvements made during the course of the survey.
These were:

0 An additional limit chain was installed on the large cutoff
saw at the carpenter shop.

0 The bulldozer operator on the waste dump was instructed by
the foreman to push material only half the distance from the track
to the edge of the dump. _

Eleven additional safety recommendations were made. These
included: ‘

0 All belt drives, gear drives, drive couplings, and drive shafts
located within 7 feet of the floor should be guarded.

0 Drop pans should be provided under the racked oil barrels
at the lamp-repair shop, at the electric-locomotive-repair pits, and
at the railroad-car-maintenance section.

0 The handrail on the right side of the No. 2 end of locomotive
No. 61 should be repaired.

0 All electrically powered hand-held tools should be frame-

iv grounded. ~ -

[Power systems supplying electric shovels, draglines, and
similar equipment, where the line-to-ground voltage exceeds:150,
should provide a neutral point at the originating end, and this neu-
tralshould be connected to ground through a suitable_impedance. A
grounding conductor should be carried with the power conductors
and this grounding conductor connected to theequipment frames
and to the neutral point through the impedance. A current trans-
former should also be installed in the grounding conductor and con-
nected to suitable ground trip relays in such a manner as to cause
them to function and open the power circuit in case of a ground
fault on the system or equipment.

_- THE M|NEsMll.-|.~‘ UNION 

 

 

Dulski (D, N. Y.) last’ month by Mine-Mill leaders here.

The group, shown with Dulski. in the picture at right,

took up the following issues as reported by Int’l Rep.

Joe Scioli:
“Taxes——Rep. Dulski said he
will push for the highest pos-
sible tax cut for lower income
groups, dependent on how the
issue shapes up in the hearings.
Our position is for $1,000 income
tax exemption per person. Dul-
ski is not opposed to higher tax

. exemptions. .
“Medicare — Dulski supports

this all theway, through Social
Security, ‘but he sees no real
possibility for passage of this
measure this year.

“Jobs—We stated our position

b on tariffs and a UN‘ Metals

Bank. of majorlrsurplus metals
in our industry. We advised
"him of the New Jersey zinc
shut—down in Hanover, New
Mexico, because of imports re-
sulting from lower tariffs. .
“Dulski told us that he knows
of no cuts being proposed in
tariffs for brass products and
that he was very much in-

' terested in our UN Metals Bank

-program. He said it had merit

and possibilities and that all
nations would have to cooperate.

“We made it clear we would
strongly oppose any tariff cut
proposed by anyone on brass
mill products. We wanted no in-
vasion of our jobs.

“Early Retirement Bill——We
advised Rep. Dulski that Rep.
Montoya had introduced a bill
calling for retirement of workers
at age 60 with full benefits
normally paid at age 65. Dulski
favors early retirement, he said-,
and would back the Montoya
bill.

“SACB Hearing—We discussed
the SACB case and the ‘con-
spiracy’ business. After explain-
ing that 14 years of attack, har-
assment and legal persecution
of our union should be brought
to a halt and off our backs, we
asked for his support.

“We gave the Congressman a
copy of the ACLU letter to Att’y
General Kennedy and asked that
he have it put in the Congres-
sional Record. Rep. Dulski said

he ..would consider it seriously
and let us know. - -

PHOENIX, Ariz. ’—-‘ Rec-

 ,ommiendatior_1s, for improve-

ment of claims handling by

" the Arizona Industrial Com-

mission, were made last

,l’I10l1l.'h by a delegation from

Arizona Mine-Mill Council
locals. They were backed
by local union leaders who
told of the injustices and
delays encountered by in-
jured Workers in trying to
get compensation for time
lost and for permanent dis-
ability.

The group appeared be-
fore a special Industrial

9 Commission Study Commit-

tee of the Arizona House of
Representatives.

Their ' recommendations in-
cluded changes in the Indus-
trial Commission’s procedures
to force full and immediate re-
porting of all injuries, giving

” doctors more responsibility for
assisting claimants, and de-
centralization of the Commis-

sion work so that its representa-
tives would be available in all
areas of the State.

‘A’ T at ’

‘Previous Meeting I

The hearing came as a direct
result of an earlier appearance

before the Committee by Ari-

zona Mine-Mill Council Chair-
man David Duarte and Int’l
Rep. S y l v a in Schnaittacher.
They outlined to the legislators
a program for their investiga-

tions. The State Representatives
were so impressed with Mine-
Mil1’s detailed knowledge of
the Industrial Commission prob-
lems that they ‘invited repre-
sentatives of our Arizona Lo-
cals to appear before them and
present their concrete recom-
mendations. ‘

The ’Union’s report pointed
up the steps in the Industrial

-Commission’s claims handling

procedures that it said -“lead to
delays, and medical and legal
controversies.” -. ‘

*i,**, *

‘Tun COMMITTEE was asked A

to "query the Industrial ‘Commis-
sion’ on delayed and inadequate
accident reporting by employ-
ers and doctors, and to investi-

gate the possibility of better‘ as_- _’

sistance to claimants by com-
mission personnel. «

Part of the blame for “the
hardship to workmen’s compen-
sation claimants and their fam-
ilies” was put on what the
statement c a ll e d; “technical
shortcomings in the way the

, ture’s .

ployment

compensation laws are written
or interpreted.”

Lobbying. Too

At; the same time that local
leaders and International Un-
ion staff have been in Phoenix
for their work with the Legisla-
Industrial Commission
Study Committee, they have
been contacting their Senators
and Representatives to push
passage of bills raising unem-
insurance benefits,

opposing discrimination in pub-

lic accommodations, giving free
text books for high school stu-
dents and bringing mills’ and

smelters under the jurisdiction i

of the Arizona. State Mine In-
spector. ’

Arizona Mine-Mill members
are also seeking the establish-
ment of a legislative committee
to study the state’s outmoded
mine safety code and propose
revisions. - »

 Eight Mining Companies Guilty of Price Fixing, Says
7:1. Federal Court .  . . Companies Invest in Africa

“GUILTY” was the finding of Federal Judge Blumen-
feld in Hartford, Connecticut last month in the case of
eight corporations and five officers indicted on charges
of conspiring to fix brass product prices.

4 The guilty: Phelps Dodge Copper Products, Revere
Copper and Brass, Bridgeport Brass, Cerro Corporation,
Calumet and Hecla, Mueller Brass, Progress Manufactur-
ing.Company, Triangle Conduit and Cable, R. H. Lewin
of Cerro Corporation, Edgar P. Dunleavy of Phelps
Dodge,, Richard L. Allen and John M. Dumser of Bridge-
port Brass, and Alfred C. Dappert, of Mueller Brass.

. Sentencing will be March 4. Companies and indi-
 . viduals are subject to fines of up to $50,000; individuals
- ' i also‘ up to one year in prison. 0 1

it Pleading not guilty and subject to trial are An.aconda
. American Brass and Vice-President Justi/n Lockwood;
¥L'_”\SCOVill. Manufacturing Company and Sales Manager Mau-
jg.’ rice Liston, Jr.; and Ch-ase Brass and Copper Co., a Ken-
 P necott subsidiary.

PROSECUTING attorney John J. Galgay of the
anti-trust division said price-fixing charges in the brass
and copper mill industry involved a business doing $360

.million in sales‘ per year. “That’s about as flagrant a
price-fixing conspiracy as I’d like to come upon,” he said.

Judge Blumenfeld remarked from the bench: “We
hold ourselves out to the rest of the world as a free econ-
omy. I would hope by now that the people who control

— as large a segment of our economy as are represented here
 know that the government does not regard free enterprise
5  as a power to control prices for their own benefit.”
The indictment said the price-fixing conspiracy began
‘as early as 1956 and continued until some time in 1961.

t-PROLONGED STRIKES ‘hit hard at 1962 profits of American
Metal Climax and St. Joseph Lead Company. American Metal Cli-
-niaxv’ profits for 1962 dropped by $11,100,000 compared with 1961.
no.3-Company officialssaid the decline was due principally to the strike
at/the Climax molybdenum mine at Leadville, Colorado, settled
fearlier this year after a shutdown of nearly six months. '
_l A ‘St. Joe’s profits in 1962 were nearly 30 percent less than in 1961.
’Company officials said strike losses accounted for practically all of
the decline.. Company losses continue to mount as the strike by the

Steelworkers at St. Joe’s lead mines in Missouri, now in its eighth
month, goes on with little indication that a settlement is near.

Late in February a special federal mediator reported no prog-
ress in contract talks resumed earlier in the month. He was quoted
as saying: “Some minor and trivial items were eliminated, but
economic issues were not touched on at all.”

U.S. OVERSEAS INVESTMENT in new copper production,
slowed in Chile by uncertainty over taxes and popular demand for
nationalization of American-owned mines and smelters, is going
ahead in Africa. A
, Latest project to be announced is development of the Palabora
copper deposit in the state of Transvaal, Union of South Africa. The
deposit has about 315 million tons of -ore averaging nearly 7 ‘percent
copper and can be mined as an open. pit.

Present plans call for an outlay of $105 million over the next
three years for mine development, a mill and concentrator, and a
smelter. 12 million tons of ore would be treated per year. U.S. Com-
panies participating in the investment are Newmont Mining Corp.
and American Metal Climax, Inc.

*‘A'*

COPPER PRICE, steady for nearly two years at 31 cents, is
beginning to worry some industry observers. The Birmingham,
England, correspondent of American Metal Market, daily metal
trades paper, said two weeksjago: “Majority opinion assesses a
right value for copper today, in the light of the economic and trade
outlook, at no more than 220 per ton [U.S. 271/2 cents per pound].
How much’ business has been lost through maintenance of the fixed
price, it- is impossible to say. Those who are endeavoring to expand
the use of copper by advertising its virtues are unable to draw at-
tention to the price at which it is obtainable.” '

Simon D. Strauss, vice president of American Smelting and Re-
fining Co., joined the chorus at the annual dinner of the Copper
Club in New York February 15. He said that for copper to be com- ‘
petitive with other substitutable materials, “we must have the right
price. As situations change we should recognize the price of copper
should change and not create a fetish of 31 cents.”

***

ALUMINUM is one of copper’s strong competitors. Cuts in
aluminum prices, now 221/2 cents per pound, have widened the
spread between copper and aluminum prices to 81/.» cents—widest
spread since 1956. Wall Street Journal says a large producer of
aluminum conductor strip, working with a large manufacturer of
transformers, seeks to replace copper with aluminum for high volt-

_age transformer windings. Objective is to out both weight and cost
of transformers.

by 100,000 tons to 300,000
tons per year. ,

Stockholders groaned when
Kennecott announced the quar-
terly dividend per share would
be reduced from $1.25 to $1.00
per share to finance the expan-
sion. Also unhappy was Chile,
where, Kennecott has put ex-
pansion plans for its Braden
Copper Company subsidiary on
ice because of the uncertain tax 4" ‘

outlook.

KENNECOTT WORKERS are
taking a hard, long look at the
program, too. Giant strides in
increased output "per employee
lie ahead. This huge investment
in expansion of pit and precipi-
tate copper production will in-_
volve increased rail haulage, a .
new mill, modernization of the ». *
Garfield smelter and other im-
provements.

Despite a 50 per cent increase
in copper production, said J. -P.
O’Keefe, Utah Division man-
ager, in an interview with the .
Salt Lake Tribune, the invest-, ' 
ment would not result in in-
creased employment. The net
result will be to maintain about
the present level of employ-
»ment.

When the expansion program
is completed in four to five
years, Kennecott workers in
Utah will be producing 50 per
cent more copper per man than
today.
