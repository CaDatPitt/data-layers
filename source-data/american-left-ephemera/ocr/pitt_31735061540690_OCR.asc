to defend the independence of American nations against ag-
gression from without.

In the face of this tradition, when an even more aggressive
challenge to democratic freedom was issued by Germany and
Italy in a new invasion of Spain, the United States limped
shamefully behind “non-intervention” with a policy called
“neutrality.” "Neutrality” did not distinguish between a help-
less people brutally assaulted and a wanton war-making power,
not between a recognized democratically-elected government
and a faction. “Neutrality” was followed by an arms embargo
which operated against the government of ‘ Spain but no-t
against the German and Italian invaders of Spain. Nazi re-
action to the arms embargo should have awakened the spon-
sors of "neutrality” to the great danger. The Berlin corre-
spondent of The New York Times reported that the German
Foreign Oflice “cannot find words strong enough to express
its satisfaction.”

Even the masters of evasion have come in 1939 to recog-
nize what the steel workers, bakers, farmers, lawyers and
laborers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade knew in 1936. The
seizure of Prague by Germany shocked even the British and
French governments out of their complacency. The following
words of Chamberlain are a vindication of the sacriﬁce made
by humble Britons and Americans in Spain:

“What we are concerned with is to preserve our indepen-
dence. When I say our independence, I do not mean this coun-
try only. I mean the independence of all states which may be
threatened by aggression in pursuit of such a policy as I have

d-escri-bed.”

That indeed was what the peoples of the world were con-
cerned with when the democratic governments were toying
with the policy of “non-intervention” and “neutrality.” The
demonstrations and collections made on behalf of Republican

Spain surpass any previous solidarity eiiort the world has
witnessed.

One great nation was free from the limiting mistakes of
“non-intervention” and "neutrality.” What Thomas Paine
said of the American Revolution, Joseph Stalin repeated about
the Spanish War: V

“The workers of the Soviet Union are only fulﬁlling their
duty by rendering all possible assistance to the revolutionary
masses of Spain. They realize that the liberation of Spain from
the yoke of the fascist reactionaries is not the -private concern of
Spaniards but the concern of all advanced and progressive
humanity.”

Hampered by their governments, the democratic peoples
helped in the same spirit. The aid of workers, farmers, scien-
tists, writers, musicians and housewives was made manifest in
the form of International Brigades of volunteers to fight fas-
cism in Spain. America’s Abraham Lincoln Brigade is a proud
proof that the people of this country never subscribed to the
shame of a false “neutrality.”

For twenty-two months the stream of volunteers flowed
from North America to Spain providing replacements for
casualties. Those who fell were buried in unmarked graves,

or at best a stick from an orange crate bore their names in -

crayon scrawl for the rain to wash away. It is customary after
a war to raise a monument to the dead whose identity could
not be determined. But here the process is reversed: the names
of the dead alone were safe to cite and honor. It was the living
who were bound to remain unknown.

Those who fell died that humanity might go forward not
backward, but while they thought in broad terms of the
brotherhood of man, they did not forget the special interest
of their own country in the outcome of the war. They knew
that America’s government had been described in Germany

11

and Italy as "Jew Bolshevist democracy.” If German and
Italian intervention in Spain could be "justiﬁed” by an ob-
jection to “Bolshevism” in Spain, why not an invasion of
America tomorrow?

’The living unknown soldiers returned to this uncertainty.
Would the day come when the new unholy alliance, from sound
bases in Latin America, would exercise pressure on the Ameri-
can people to limit their democratic freedom? Would America,
too, be invited to accept a form of government or select poli-
cies pleasing to Germany, Italy and Japan? That would in-
deed be a loss of independence.-

Many voices in high place will be heard scouting such fears,
asserting America’s inviolability, ascribing to the two oceans
an absolute protective power. Others argue that our indepen-
dence is not in the least in danger because (they say) the
empire designs of the aggressors ‘are only the reasonable
aspirations of “have-not” nations, and do not offer the least
challenge to the Americas.

‘ These two types of argument complement each other mar-
velously. Both lead to the same conclusion: that we must do
nothing, and in doing nothing, will preserve our peace and
independence. The curious thing about the spokesmen for
both these doinothing theses is that they demand we abridge

our independence even while they mock our fears for its loss.

The very voices that defend Japan against the charge of con-
spiring to attack us forbid us to fortify Guam because that
would offend Japan. Those who cannot believe that the
Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis harbors designs against us declare
that we must surrender our legal right to lay an arms embargo
against these aggressors. .

These are not political differences. Whatever the individual
spokesman may feel, this urging of cowardice, this self-en-
slavement by fear, this surrender of freedom to avoid slavery,
is the voice of treason. The story of Spain is too fresh, of

12

 

Czechoslovakia too poignant, of the Munich settlement too

shameful for anyone to miss the point. The greatest weapon.

of the new Caesars is treason, and against treason in our land
we have every cause to beware. Nor is there anything new in
this phenomenon except its form. The law of the conqueror is
“Divide and rule,” and the object of treason is to set us one
against the other instead of all against the aggressor. Was not
this the danger that our first American government faced?
Was it not the parent of the Civil War?

Washington found the formula, still good in our time, to
defeat treason and division. He called that formula “unity.”
Today we must ask, around what policies shall we build the
unity of the whole American people? What shall the symbols
be? Surely not the policy of capitulation, of “non-interven-
tion,” of “neutrality” and surrender of democracy in the name
of “peace”? No, the very governments that once sought peace
by those paths have now admitted their error. Nor may we
build unity on a platform of indifference to treason. That was
the mistake of Spain, that the mistake of Czechoslovakia.
Indeed, it tells the story of fascism’s coming to power in Ger-
many and Italy as well. No, our model is clear: the example of

- resistance in Spain, of the International Brigades, of the

Abraham Lincoln Brigade. It should not be diﬂicult to choose
between the way of Benedict Arnold and that of the Abraham
Lincoln Brigade.

If we would avoid needless repetitions of the sacriﬁces made
by this gallant band, we must grasp the lesson of their ex-
perience now. It is the simple word: Resist! And if we are to
resist aggression in defense of our independence and of our
democratic form of government, surely the least costly method
will be found in the company of all other peoples who seek the
same goal. The lesson of Spain again comes to our aid. It tells
us that the Soviet Union is the surest and strongest of allies
in such a cause. It is safe to say that Spain could have been

13

 

saved had the United States joined the Soviet Union in pro-

testing and opposing the invasion. Though we delay facing

the problem, a few months or a few years will lay the naked
choice of liberty or death at our door. Then or before then,
the American people will decide in favor of independence.
In the hour of enlightenment the service rendered by the
American volunteers in Spain will first become fully apparent
to the many who have not understood. Perhaps then the
United States government will erect a monument to the living
unknown soldier, the veteran of the Abraham Lincoln
Brigade. '

If we are agreed that Decoration Day cannot more ﬁttingly
be observed than by honoring the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
dead, there remains only the question of “how.” Flowers for
the dead, to be sure, but what of the living? What of the
ideals and purposes for which they fought? There are many
ways of honoring both the men and their ideals, useful ways.
It is to be hoped that by May 30 all American prisoners of
Franco will be home, and will not need your pressure to obtain
their release. It is equally to ‘be desired that the scores of vol-
unteers in France (jailed and kept in concentration camps by
the ungrateful French government) shall have returned‘ to
America by that date. In that case the problems of the vet-
erans will all fall into a single category: Rehabilitation.

Hundreds will still need medical aid; some require surgery;

' mechanical arms and legs are wanted; re-education of the

physically handicapped and maintenance. for the permanently
disabled all demand a constant ﬂow of money.

Finally, beyond attending to the wants of these men who
have deserved so well of us, we have no right to forget the
ideals that inspired their sacriﬁce. At this late date we must
urge upon our government a reconsideration of its past mis-
takes. The error committed in hastily recognizing the puppet
Franco must be mitigated by a just use of diplomatic relations

14

 

 

to halt the bloody reprisals now taking place in Spain.

More important than this, the fundamental mistake of a
false "neutrality” must be corrected. Legislation permitting
aid to victimized nations and outright embargoes against ag-
gressors must replace the shameful Neutrality Act of -1937.

For ‘us as individuals and through our clubs, churches,
unions or other societies, there is a constant duty toward mil-
lions of refugees from fascism throughout theworld. The
misery of the nearly half million Spaniards, herded into
French concentration camps, is the most pressing single prob-
lem of the refugee. Whatever we may contribute to feed these
people, to aid in their rehabilitation, by way of moral pressure
to halt their abuse and persecution in France, must remain
subordinated to the major service we can render the refugees.
That is, we must once for all halt the aggression and fascist
oppression which has created this new “class” of refugees
spread over the face of the earth. We must make the world
again a place in which men live at peace, where they were born
or where they settle, without distinction of race, color or creed.

Last of all, in these diﬂicult times, we must not look upon
the expensive victories of reaction as ﬁnal. These men of the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade whose memories we honor on Deco-
ration Day knew that they were risking death in but one battle
of a long-enduring conflict. We must be above discouragement
by single defeats. We have no greater enemy today than our
own faltering faith. Let us keep heart for the many, many
battles yet to come.

Only in this way shall we keep faith with those who died.
To them let us repeat Lincoln’s Gettysburg pledge:

"That from these honored dead we take increased devotion ,
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion.” ' "

15

-FOR TWO years a large group of Americans, veterans of the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade, were locked in Franco prisons-“held
by Franco and Hitler and Mussolini. *

Many were wounded, ‘but their fascist jailers refused to care
for their “wounds. All are ill from the prison diet of beans and
garlic soup. Beans and garlic soup and nothing else for two years.

Now they are free. Their first act upon crossing into France .

was to contribute from their ﬂimsy cash allowance for food for
their ten buddies who still remain in the concentration camps.

They faced the terrors of fascism. They slept for two years
on the cold stone ﬂoors of the San Pedro prison; they lived for
two years on a never-changing diet. All are sick now.

But all are more determined than ever to dedicate their lives
to the -defense of democracy. They are freedom’s ablest soldiers.
Restoring them to health restores to the battle for liberty here
in America ﬁghters steeled in the ﬁght for democracy.

Do your part today.

From These Honored Dead...

By DAVID MCKELVY WHITE
and JAMES HAWTHORNE

HE WOUNDS of the Civil War were still raw when
May 30 was appointed as a day of remembrance for our
thousands of soldier dead. In the year 1868 the dropping of
ﬂowers on l<insmen’s graves was more than an act of tradi-
tional reverence for the dead. It could not fail to be a day
dedicated by the American people to renewing the ideals for
which they and their countrymen had bled from 1861 to 1865.
Today we observe Decoration Day with faint and confused
memories of the issues which men thought worth their lives;
The word "slavery” comes to our minds and we hazily con-
ceive the emancipation of the Negro people as the objective
of the North. In reality the freedom of all peoples was at
stake in that war, though Americans expressed their primary
concern in the slogan: “The Union forever!__”
Why then should the fate of popular government through-
out the world have depended upon the preservation of Ameri-
can unity? The United States was a symbol of democracy.

' It was “a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the

proposition that all men are created equal.” Lincoln saw the
Civil War as a test of "whether that nation’ or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated can long endure.” Nor did the
world simply wait on the result: a half million foreign and
foreign-born volunteers fought in the ranks of the Federal
Army!

If we turn back to the beginnings of American history, we
are no longer surprised to ﬁnd such a close relationship be-
tween internal American policy and the world status of democ-
racy. The Revolutionary War was won and the independence
of the American colonies procured through the aid of millions
of European sympathizers. Against the Americans and their
allies were ranged all the eighteenth century forces of reaction.
Our active foemen included the American Tories and the
Bourbon King of France. Our allies included the British
people who regarded our struggle against George III as theirs;
the French people, who forced their king to grant us aid; the
German people (and even German princes), who protested
British recruiting of German mercenaries and celebrated
Washington’ s defeat of the hirelings at Trenton.

The celebrities of culture and science in every land ranged
themselves beside the champions of liberty in the New World.
Voltaire, Goethe, Schiller, Kant, Lessing risked their personal
friendships or deﬁed their noble patrons to stand with the
Americans. Younger men came to offer their lives. Lafayette,
nineteen years of age, left a young wife, family, fortune, title,
to fight for the new freedom. Von Steuben ignored his rank
and personally drilled the ragged Continentals at Valley
Forge until they became an army. The Poles sent Kosciusco
and Pulaski; the Swedes were represented by the Baron de
Stedingk. As for the French, they numbered thousands; thou-
sands to take home the germ of the French Revolution.

And so the war was won; the colonies became independent.
Could anyone be so naive as to imagine that reaction would
make no further effort to destroy this "awful” breeding
ground of democratic ideas? The Americans, at least, could
have no illusions. The British retained the frontier posts and
incited the Indians against them. The Spaniards intrigued in
the back country. Above all, the enemy now turned to the use
of more subtle weapons. It played upon the sectional interests

4

 —¢-_a---"'--Q-————.—————-—————— —

of the various regions to set state against state. Then indeed it
might divide and rule or divide and destroy.

With this sword hanging over their heads, the Founding-

Fathers formed a union of the colonies, and the United States
of America was born. The government had no choice but to
subordinate all other purposes to the single objective of main-
taining unity. Internal and foreign policy must be bent to this
end. Washington’s greatness in "peace rests on his clear and
unfaltering pursuit of unity. Even his farewell admonition
against “permanent alliances“ and his earlier stand for neu-
trality in foreign affairs had nothing in common with the
sorry "isolation” and one-sided "neutrality” of our time.

In his farewell address, Washington explained that he had
proclaimed neutrality in 1793 in order “to gain time to our
country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions.” Nor
did that prevent him from laying an embargo in 1794 against
the hostile mother-country, Great Britain, in favor of Amer-
ica’ s ally, France.

Washington noted that conﬂicting interests of the various
states and regions made any foreign alliance that might please
one section distasteful to another. Therefore he advised ﬂexi-
ble agreements and alliances that should be “temporary and
liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied, as experi-
ence or circumstances shall dictate.” Even this caution was
exercised out of concern for the weakly welded joints of the
Union and was not in any sense inspired by fear of giving of-
fense to some European powers. Sectional rivalries, Washington
observed, already contained the ﬂavor of civil war, “which
opposite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would
stimulate and embitter.”

The wisdom of Washington and other leaders postponed
but did not avert "the inevitable conflict.” Civil war broke out
in 1861. Once again the progressives of the whole world rallied
around the issue of American unity for its broader meaning.

5

Once again world reaction openly and furtively aided the
partisans of division by way of weakening world democracy.
The British Tories picked quarrels with the American gov-
ernment. The British workers——th-ough starving for want of
Southern cotton to spin—b1ocked every Tory maneuver to
bring England into the war on behalf of the Confederacy.
Thousands of Irishmen came to America to volunteer for the
cause of the Union. The Tories aided ‘Confederate agents to
enlist the Irish clergy against the volunteers. Handbills
screamed: “Persecution of Catholics in America!”

The emigrants were informed (in manifestos signed by
their local priest or high ecclesiastics) that the Unionists were

-responsible for the burning of Catholic churches in Charles-

town and Philadelphia and the South, and for shooting down
Catholics in the streets of Brooklyn; Baltimore, Cincinnati,
Louisville and St. Louis. (Do you remember the stories from
Spain?) As in our time, this poppycock failed of its purpose.
More than 140,000 Irish fought for the North in the Civil
War! The Germans were still more numerous. One of every
four Federals was foreign-born! ’
At Gettysburg, President Lincoln promised the foreign and
foreign-born volunteers that their sacriﬁce should indeed be
in no narrow cause but for a high universal principle. "We

here highly resolve that government of the people, by the L

people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”

It is indeed ﬁtting that we recall the dead of the Civil War
and of our later wars in this spirit; that we bring ﬂowers to
those who fought for the nation’s unity and for the extension
of popular government. _ '

Time has added to the graves we brighten on Memorial
Day. There are the dead of the Spanish-American and World
Wars to remember. Surely it would be a greater honor to them
if we were to restore to Decoration Day the essential American
tradition; The burning enthusiasm for national unity, and

6

 

universal popular independence that inspired them, should
once again be recalled on this great holiday. If we observe
Memorial Day in this spirit, we must include in our honored
dead a long line of American volunteers ‘who have died on
foreign soil.

Once again a glance back into American history reveals
that volunteering is an essential New World tradition. The
American people have always been conscious of their debt to
foreign volunteers in the Revolutionary War and Civil War.
In return they have offered their lives in progressive causes.
Mo-re cautious, or less generous, minorities have always at-
tempted to halt volunteering.

In 1793 Gideon Henﬁeld was tried in Philadelphia for

violating American neutrality by‘ sailing before the mast of a
French privateer. France—America’s ally——was at war with
England; the latter still held our frontier posts, incited the
Indians, harried our shipping. "Neutrality” would not stick:
the jury acquitted Henﬁeld despite a virtual instruction for
conviction by the judge. "The verdict was received with
shouts, for the twelve had spoken no more than the common
sentiment of the city.”

No less a man than George Rogers Clark, explorer of the
Paciﬁc Northwest, deﬁed “neutrality.” He took a commission
from the French to raise and equip an army of American
volunteers to march against the Spaniards. Spanish restrictions
on the Mississippi traﬂic were a matter of life and death to
people in the back country. Governor Shelby told Jefferson
that Kentuckians could not be neutral in a matter that touched
them so nearly. In South Carolina an inquiry committee at-
tempted to halt “illegal recruiting.” It not only failed to
obtain any convictions, but had to face a $60,000 damage suit.

For mo-re than two decades Americans fought in South
America to aid the colonies in their struggle for independence

from Spain. The armies of Bolivar and San Martin, the ﬂeets

7

of Chile, Argentina and what is now Venezuela owed ships
and men to America. Despite ofﬁcial “neutrality” the very
agents of the American government threw in their lot with
the revolutionaries. In the great double revolt in Canada
(1837) ; in Paris in 1848; in Cuba in 1850, and so to our own
day: wherever Americans saw a struggle for democracy, in-
dependence or freedom from oppression, they shouldered arms.

When Spain cried out in 1936, how could they do less?

If American government leaders had turned back to read
Torn Paine’s stirring appeal for help to America, and had
substituted “Spain” for “America,” they might have avoided
the mistakes they made and followed the example of the
volunteers.

“The cause of America [Spain],” Paine wrote, “is in a great
measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances have
and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through
which the principles of all lovers of mankind are aﬂected, and
in the event of which their alfections are interested. The laying
a country desolate with ﬁre and sword, declaring war against
the natural rights of all mankind, and extirpating the defenders
thereof from the face of the earth, is the concern of every man
to whom nature hath given the power of feeling.”

This seems so clearly the case of Spain that at this late date
one ﬁnds it hard to understand the reasoning of the British,
French and American governments. Already in 1936 one fact
stood out clearly in international affairs, namely, that a new
Caesarism menaced the peace of the world. Three powerful
fascist-militarist nations had declared their designs and, in-
deed, wars of aggression against Manchuria, Ethiopia, China
conﬁrmed their words. Their declared program of conquest
must inevitably lead them to exploit the Spanish war as a pre-
liminary to conflict with the world democracies.

The Spanish war was only days old when it was positively

 

 

learned that Rome and Berlin were arming the rebels. They
accompanied this threat to democracy itsel_f by the ominous
declaration that they could "not tolerate” the establishment of
a "Bo.lshevist” government in Spain.

Here was a direct challenge to France and England, yet
the British and French governments replied with “non-inter-
vention.” Since the sale of arms to a legitimate government
to defend itself against a rebellious faction is authorized by
international law, such sale would in no way constitute inter-
vention. “Non-intervention” was therefore a surrender by
Great Britain and France of a legal right in favor of the
actual intervention in Spain by the fascist powers. The new
policy was in violation of international law, for it denied to
the Spanish government its legal right to purchase arms. In
practice the policy was even worse. It directly aided the aggres-
sors by denying lawful sale of arms to the government while
permitting unlimited war aid to the rebellious faction. By long
continuance, "non-intervention” encouraged the Nazis and
Blackshirts to pass from open aid of the rebels to direct in-
vasion of Spain.

The United States had a vital stake in this curious game.
For more than a hundred years American policy has recog-
nized that a puppet Spain in the hands of reactionary powers
constitutes a major menace to the Americas. In the 1820’s a
reactionary “axis” invaded Spain with the admitted intent of
acting through her to bring South America back under the
yoke of reaction. It is interesting to note that Thomas Jeffer-
son, who had originated the phrase “no entangling alliances,”
urged President Monroe to join with Great Britain in a chal-
lenge to the aggressors.

“While Europe is laboring to become the domicile of
despotism,” Jefferson explained, “our endeavorshould surely
be to make our hemisphere that of freedom.” Out of this situ-
ation emerged the Monroe Doctrine: a Pan-American front
