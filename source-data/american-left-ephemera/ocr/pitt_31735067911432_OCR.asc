  Trial examiner
‘ finds for union ‘

CHICAGO——Word was received as
THE UNION went to press that a re-
port just issued by NLRB Trial E_x-
aminer Eugene Dixon’ in the case of
Precision Scientific Company’s refusal

» to recognize Mine-Mill’s Chicago Amal-

gamated Local 758 completely sustains
the Union’s right to bargaining repre-
sentation at the plant. A

The trial examiner’s report throws
out the company’s" contention that Mine-
Mill Local 758 is not a union, and rec-
ommends that the national,NLRB force
the company to recognize the Union
and bargain with it.

Precision Scientific thus loses a
round here in its long and vicious at-
tempt to bust the local in the Plant. If
followed by the national Board, the ex-
aminer’s recommendation would in ef-
fect nullify the union-busting injunc-
*tion which‘,/T the company recently got
from the ‘County court against Local
758.

CHICAGO——Fifty thousand copies of
ti leaflet setting forth the facts in the
'.Pi"ecision company’s union—busting in-

junction have been distributed by Mine- ,

Mill Local 758 here. '

‘.

_ Local 758, with- the _support of the ..
 'Interna'.‘tional Officers, is urging the
 following actions:

1. Issue public statements condemning
the injunction, and join “Amicus
Curiae” in the appeal our. union is
making to the higher courts. (Send
copies to Local 758, 1110 S. Oakley
Blvd., Chicago.)

2. Urge the National ,Labor\R_elations
Board in Washington to use the pow-
er it legally has to go into the
courts to protect Federal jurisdiction
and the rights of unions under Fed-
eral law‘, against this “states right”
injunction that would upset all labo
relations. '

s

I 8.Call on political parties and candi-_
dates, especially judicial candidates,

' Jtoprotest this injunction and urge
its reversal.

District 6 locals start  
campaign against Butler bill

NEW YORK CITY———Action against the Butler Bill has been started through-
out District 6 in meetings of local unions and _area leadership and legislative
meetings. . ' - *

On .the basis of discussions held to date, the Butler witchhunting “task force”
can expect a cool reception if they invade District 6 on their union-busting mission.

The Eastern Smelting and Refining Council, meeting in New Jersey, voted
to launch a campaign involving, visits to Congressmen and Senators and united
action with other unions to defeat the Butler bill plan to destroy unions. A

This has been followed by discussion in local unions which have rallied the
membership in defense of the union against the Butler Bill and the Committee.
Shop papers and leaflets will continue the campaign‘ to bring the.facts of the
situation to the entire membership. - . 1 \

IN CONNECTICUT, a state legislative meeting held in conjunction 'with
the Ansonia stewards meeting voted to conduct a similar campaign. In addition,
pledges of finances were made to purchase television time and newspaper adver-
tisements to acquaint the general public and other unions with the menace of the
Butler bill.

The caliniax of the campaign will be a mass delegation to Washington in
which District 6 will participate with other sections of the union when this
action is projected by the International officers.

Speaking before the various meetings in the District, Board Member Albert
Pezzati has stressed the fact that the Butler Bill aims to complete the job
started by the Taft-Hartley Act. ’

‘This new union-busting bill, like the Goldwater-Rhodes Bill,” said Pezzati,

“is especially desired by the corporations at this time in order to soften up labor
for wage cuts in the event of a depression.” *

Government files anti-trust
  suit against ASR, St. Joe

A new angle on causes behind the present lead industry crisis was unfolded

last week when the government filed a civil anti-trust suit against American Smelt- -

ing and Refining Company and St. Joseph Lead Company, two of the country's
biggest lead producers. _ A , ‘ .~
In the suit filed in Federal Court October 9, both companies were charged
with monopoly control and manipulation of the price of primary lead in the United
States dating back to 1920. , . '
' Included in the monopoly practices which AS & R and St. Joe Lead are charged
with having engaged in for the past 33 years are the following: -- .
ENGAGING in a continuous agreement to surpress and‘ limit competition in

1 the mining, smelting, refining and marketing of primary lead by regulating pro-

duction, exercising control over the refining and m_arketin-g of competitors’ produc-
tion, joining with foreign producers to influence the movement of foreign lead
into the United States, and by these. devices having exercised control over the

price of primary lead in this country.

 

 

Gilman strikers
reject E-Z ‘offer’

GILMAN, Colo.—Mine-Mill's second

. Empire Zinc strike is in its ninth

week. Last week the members of strik-
ing Local 581 rejected, by secret bal-

lot, what officials of New Jersey Zinc —

Company’s Empire Zinc division called
an “offer.”

Twenty-four hour picketing contin-
ues, with not a scab in sight. It is

. winter in this high mountain camp, but

the strikers are dug in and determined
to win the 1952 and '53 wage increases
the company has denied.

Strike relief from nearby locals has

been outstanding.

Local 557 at Denver, with 125 mem-
bers, has given $330, and is planning a
benefit dance on a big scale.

Local 393 at Leadville, with 160
members, has given $600, is checking
off $2.50 a month for eac‘1 member for
strike relief for the duration. This lo-
cal also is preparing for two dinner-
dance benefits.

Local 913 at Salida, with 40 mem-

bers, has given $130, is taking collec-

tionss every pay day.

Local 676 at Leadville, with 40 mem-
bers, has given $50, is working with
Local 393 on fund-raising.

From Miami, Ariz., comes a report
that Local 586 has voted to give $50
a‘month from its treasury as long as
the strike lasts, and to take up collec-
tions among its members.

Other locals are urged to support
this important strike. '

musics TRAVIS“

Candidate for International Secretary-Treasurer

This has been one of the most en-

ergetic election campaigns in Mine-‘

Mill’s history. I am in full agreement
with those who have stated that there
is really only one basic issue in the
union elections. That issue is pork
chops. More food in the bellies of our
kids, a better house, an American
standard of living.‘

A I state the issue in this Way because
here have been attempts in this cam-
aign to take the minds of Mine-Mill’s
ﬁxembership off the real stakes in‘ this
election. One of my opponents, for ex-
ample, has attempted to make East

.Berlin the issue. Another candidate

for office has declared that we have
to “educate” the workers in some op-
erations tolaccept lesser wages than
those in other operations. ,_

As always, Mine-Mill's members will
vote to maintain unity in this organ-
ization—unity that has put our union
away out in front of collective bar-
gainimg results; unity that has stood
the test of anti-labor attacks from em-
ployers, raiders and witch-hunters
alike.

The issue has been stated clearly:
It is whether we’re going to accept a
“soft” leadership in November to get
us a “soft” settlement next summer, or
whether we'll accept a militant, strong
leadership that will back up the mem-
bers’ needs for every single penny it
is possible to squeeze out of the monop-
‘oly corporations that dominate our
industry. \ .

I am proud to be associated with the

“unity team” that has helped to win.

so many victories and gains for the

‘membership. It goes without saying

that Lam in full support of President
John Clark, Vice-President Larson, and
Brother Asbury Howard, who is a
candidate for Vice-President.

I should say a word or two here

about both Brother Howard and Vice-
President Charles Wilson.

Brother Wilson deserves the praise
of every Mine-Mill member for his

highly principled and unselfish action _

in not running for_ re-election in order
to make it possible for Brother How-

ard to run. Brother Howard has a long ,

record of courageous trade unionism
behind him. For twenty years, he’s
been a leader of the Negro people in
the Deep South. No one in our union
has had so tough an assignment. No
one has acquitted himself more ad-
mirably. =~

I want also in this statement to ex-
press my full support of all consti-
tutional amendments on the ballot, par-
ticularly those amendments which will
strengthen our ,union in Canada and
increase the unity between "the United
States and Canadian membership of
our union. _ ‘

CHARLES. McLEAN

Candidate for International Secretary-Treasurer

At the recent convention in St. Louis
several. statements were made that the
candidates would carry on a “clean”
campaign. Everyone wants a clean,-
good, honest fight, but hardly ’had the
delegates returned from the conven-
tion when the UNION—-the official
"mouthpiece of the International, start-
ed to throw the dirt.

We hear remarks about “red bait- ,

ing” and that you,.shouldn’t call a.
communist a communist, but it is per-
fectly safe, sane and fair to call a

person any and every name in the

bookiwithout any justification or basis
of fact. ,H,ow decent International Of-

, ficers permit statements to be pub- ’
i’ lished, that they know are false, is

beyond the comprehension of honest
trade unionists.

peoples world so concerned about Mc-

I pledge myself to follow the pro-
gram outlined and accepted by the
Convention. My education qualifies me
to handle the job of Secretary-Treas-
ureii“ ' 1

Even though I may not be as experi-
enced as the incumbent, the principle
which concerns me and most of us in
District 2 is the principle of freedom
of opinion. We have been confronted
this year with Brother Travis and sev-
eral organizers and staff members at-
tempting to‘-impose their thinking on
the rank and .file members of District
2.

Brother Travis even took it upon
himself to support ‘Joe Chavez for
Board Member when he and the orga-
nizers know full well that he wasnot
the choice of the delegation. We pro-
test the tactics used in their attempt
to cram down our throats a man which
is not of our own choosing. They have
placed candidacy on a racial basis, a
fact Which is hard to conceive coming
from the very people who preach quali-
fications and not race should be the
determining factors in the campaign.

We protest their treatment of our
convention delegates, trying to herd
us like sheep in order to corral us to
their way of thinking. We Mexican-
Americans demand to be treated like
men and equals" that we are in this
union and not as something that has
not reached maturity intellectually.

Ccnidida-le-for Bo‘ar.d Member. District 2

Greetings to all the locals
Dear Brothers and Sisters:.

I am grateful for this opportunity to
greet all members of Dist. 2. As you
know,’ I have been nominated for the
job of Dist. 2 Board Member, a nomi-
nation that I accepted with a deep
feeling of joy.

The reason I have accepted this nom-
ination is that the work of a union
has become almost second nature to
me.

I have attended conventions since 1943
in Butte, and have rarely failed to be
at important conferences that our un-
ion has called. I have served as a
member of ‘the canvassing committee,
and worked for a short time on the
staff of District 6 as an International
R-epresentativedn New York.
Throughout these years, I, and niany
of my brothers in the" Southwest have
been clamoring for a chance at the job
in which we can help ourselves and

i continue to help other brothers grow

in this great organization of ours. My
decision to run for this job was one
which I hated to make because I am

running against two of our best broth- _

ers in Dist. 2. ‘I have known them and
worked with them for several years.

The program of our_ great Interna-
tional is one that should be carried out
by allmembers in every section of the
union, and the keystone of this pro-
Our
program of unity is the one rock upon
which our enemies will stub their toes.

We will show our enemies that we

practice as well aspreach, democracy

I have been in Mine-Mill since it '
first started in El Paso back in 1937. .

ALBERT SKINNER

I see no need to repeat the record of 
Mine-Mill because it is well-known. 

Our Union, as in the past, made his-

tory at the St. Louis convention. Let’: -

make it here“in Dist. 2. , _
\ There are great things to be accom-

plished yet in our Dist. 2 and in our 
U.~nion—-and we willachieve tl_1em'_by~'
_ getting together regardless of how’ the .

election comes out.

In closing, I want to make clear my  ,

strong ‘support for the fighting, pro-.

gressive leadership in our Union, the "

kind We have had in. recent years, ‘and
unity amongst all the workers in our
great International Union of Mine, Mill
&\Smelter Workers.

Fraternally yours,

Candidate. for Board Member. District 2

I would like to refer the readers of
THE UNION to the letter in «this issue
of the Open Forum (page 8) from
Locals 392 and 485. That should be
considered as my campaign statement.

I.wish to state to the entire mem-
bership of District 2 that I am _en-
dorsing the unity team of Clark, Lar-
son, Howard and Travis on the basis
of--the’. outstanding record which our
Union’s leadership has
achieved and on the basis of Brother
Howard’s outstanding record as a Re‘-
gional Director in the South. I believe
Brother Howard’s election will help us
to recognize the great contribution of
our Negro membership to the advance-
ment of our Union.. ~ ‘ _ .

I endorse the unity slate, fully mind-

_ful that Brother Travis is endorsing

Brother" Chavez and Brother Larson is
endo1'sing Brother Smothermon. That

_ speaks volumes for the democracy‘ of

Mine—Mill. Brothers Travis and Larson
have the right to support whom they
please, just as I have that right. _
Insofa.r“"as. the District 2 race is
‘concerned, I have always’ stood, for

I'will continue to do so. ,

The most important issue facing the
membership. of our Union in this year’s
referendum is the maintenance of
Mine-Mill’s ' tradition of democratic:
self-government by"the rank and file
membership. ‘ i » - '

The spokesmen of big business and
our industry no longer try to hide their
purpose.' Thus, the McCarrans, the
Jenners, and the officials of impor-
tant companies organized by Mine-
Mill openly and brazenly join ‘in de-
manding that Mine-Mill purge itself
of capable and militant leadership.

At a"time.when our union and our

‘we have never heard of in all of our

All members ‘of the ..committee’ to-
gether with John Clark and with the
assistance of Orville Larson worked
hard’ on negotiations in Montana in an
endeavor to get .9. good settlement
which was reached. The settlements
reached in Montana compare favorably
with V practically all contracts within
the International Union and compare
more than favorably with some con-
tracts. ‘All decisions of the Montana
Joint Negotiating Committtee were
checked with the International Offi-
cers, through John Clark, who «was
present at all negotiating sessions.

The Montana Joint Committee re-
sents the insinuations_ contained in the
_DeStefano letter, and if the Open For-
um is continued to be used for such
_disruptive statements the top‘ officers
of the International Union will be held
directly‘ responsible. We request that
the position of the Montana Committee
contained in this telegram_be published
in the very next issue of THE UNION.

In answer to the above telegram I
would like to say that even Iihave no

are sent -in to the Union paper with the
request that they be published,,just as
I have no control over attacks on In.-

In the Convention I asked that the
campaign for officers be carried on
cleanly and upon the issues which in-
volve the welfare of the membership.
Uppermost of these is pork chop issues.

It is unfortunate" that in the heat
of the election campaign certain

~charges and counter charges arezymade. f
, My own position is clear. I have en-

dorsed Brother Travis for reelection,
and my support has no strings at-
tached. I do think that Brother McLean
has a tough joboto perform in Montana,
and I was sorry to see him attacked
just as I was sorry to see Brother
Travis attacked. While it isAunfortun-

local papers have to‘be used in an elec-

The campaign tactic of attacking

To the Editor:

The undersigned members of Mine?
Mill are supporting the united leader-
ship team of Clark, Larson, Howard,
‘and Travis in the November 2nd unio_n
elections. We do so for the following
reasons: .

1. The united leadership of Mine-Mill
has established the most outstanding
collective bargaining record of all
unions in basic industry. It has estab-
lished this record despite many ob-
stacles and attacks from the outside.

2. The united "leadership has_ pro-
tected our union in. the face of attacks
from employers, _reactionary politi-
cians, and company stooges within the
ranks. , .

3. The leadership has united the
union, increased its membership, and
made it stronger. . .

Two members of the unity team are
opposed for election;-We support both
Brothers Travis and Howard on their
records.

Brother Travis has chalked up an
amazing and creditable record as sec-
retary,-treasurer. He has proved him-
self to be a compete_nt' and able admin-
istrator of the union’s finances. He
has an .ou’tstandi_ng record as an organ-
izer'and negotiator. He has not per-
mitted attacks by our union’s enemies
to “take the easy way,” whether it be
in bargaining, organizing, 7or admin-
lstration. '

Brother Howard is seeking office
as vice-president in place of our Com- ~
mittee Chairman, Charles Wilson,
who “stepped down” in o_rder to give
more adequate representation to an
important section of our union ——- the
fighting, loyal Negro membership of
Mine-Mill. For. twenty years he has
worked in one of the most difficult
situations in the union’s jurisdiction,
the Deep South. He has proved to be
a courageous leader, an expert organ-
izer, a.n able negotiator. , _‘

The Mine-Mill ‘Unity’ Committee,

’ embracing th\e‘ undersigned and other
Mine-Mill members in support of Clark,
Larson, Howard, and Travis, also is
supporting the proposed constitutional
amendments and urges all members of
the union to approve them. .

The committee wishes to take this
opportunity to thank -the hundreds of
union members who joined itsranks,
distributed its literature, contributed
funds for its functioning.

All that remains now is to get out
the vote for these four leaders, leaders ‘
who stand for unity, strength, and
courage in collective bargaining, in po-’
liticahaction, in‘ organization, and..‘_in ’
fighting for thetneeds and aspirations
of all sections of our membership.

The issue is leadership with guts vs.
leadership with fear. That's why we 5
have campaigned so energetically for
John Clark 3t'or president, Orville Lar-
son«and Asbu-ry Howard for vice-presi-
dents, and .M. E." Travis for secretary-
treasurer. We hope all members will
do the same. ' | p ‘ '

. Brother Charles McLean, in his state-
ment as a candidate for International
Se_c.retary-Treasurer, charges that
". . . the only time that the_ workers
in Montana were double’ crossed was
when the International 7Union’s. Re-

--search Director sold. a phony bill, of

goods, to the workers in Montana in the

form of the present pension plan. . .”,

The record’ of Anaconda pension ne-
gotiations will show that my first par-
ticipation in-‘these negotiations was in
February, 1952." This ‘was exactly
three months after Brother McLean
and other members of’ the Montana
negotiating committee had signed an

agreement with the company which,-

among other things, spelled out the es-
sential features of the present pension
plan. A A

The 1951 A n a c o n d a settlement,
signed in November‘ of that year, after
the nation-wide strike, followed -~ the
pattern previously established in,Ken-
necott and Phelps Dodge. The pension
plan was part of an over-all package
worth about 21 cents. The Research
Director_did not participate in" the ne-
gotiations leading to this final settle-
ment in Montana in November, 1951.

In February, 1952, at the request of
the Montana Negotiating Committee,

ANACONDA‘ Rsplvro ESGR couucn.

The Anaconda‘Mill & Smeltermen’s
Union at a ‘regular meeting held on
Thursday night, October 15th, vigor-
ously resented the remarks made upon

_ Charles McLean and Bill Mason and
demanded that an answer be made to
thistsmear and further demanded that
the answer be published in the UNION
paper» in the Open Forum previous to
the election to beheld on November
2nd. , ' C '

It is not necessary for us to defend
either McLean or Mason becausetheir
record speaks for itself, and it is not
‘one that needs defending, however,

‘the false statements made by one De-

Stafano " need answering so that the
unwary will not be misled. /

We in Montana, have never attacked it

any candidate personally. We can cam-
-paign on issues, but since the official
organ delves into, personalities, let us
say‘ that a man cannot throw mud
' without getting a little bit dirty, and
we are not going to be idealistic in
this fight; . ,: 
DeStafano raises the question in
regard-to the rate of pay and working-
conditions in Butte. Here he is talk-
ing about something of which he knows
nothing. In regard to the wages, the
lowest wage paid to an underground
worker in Butte, and we say lowest
wage .is!'$1,4.71,per -shift. In Anaconda

thelowest wage, the starting wage for -

laborers, is $13.85 per shift, and of

" . course the other ,classifications are
graduated“ upward. We do not’ know '

your rate_é,but -how, does "this compare
with 'you1*=’rates ?‘ Are we among the
worst in‘ the

,-

-'ada?' F ‘, 1‘

Another‘ ‘point raised lbygDeStafano"

was the 1949 contracts. He stated that

-_Mon,tana extended their contracts for .

._ ‘a year without a wage increase,,‘and_
that after everyone ‘else got 5c an hour,

_ , the Anaconda Company l“voluntari1y”»

gave _Montana the nickel. All we can

 "say tothis is ,"NUTS.’f In 1949 We_ did»

.not-- secure "a wage increase, neither
‘ did-“ the locals ‘that ,DeStafano talks
_‘ a-bout..Early in 1950, 5c per‘hour»_was‘
 gained in wageincreases. We say early
in’ 1950 because in order to get this
measly nickel in January ‘and Febru-
ary 1950’the ‘contracts were extended

 to‘ June 1951- not June 1950} The ».In-
 ‘-ternational. Union Officers urged ‘Mon-
gtana‘ to accept “the ‘sameﬁc offer. over
..the‘ objections‘ of the Montana Com-‘
A ’- _mi-t,t.ee_ because we felt we were being
' .. '_.-‘sold-.; down, the [river for _5c in. order

United States and Can-

I did _not participate in meetings with
the company on the pension plan. These
meetings were for the‘ purpose of “for-
malizing” what had already been agreed
to in the 1951 settlement. Our job was
to spell out in final. written form those
paragraphs of the 1951 agreement that
dealt with pensions. On several issues\
not specifically covered’ by the 1951

-bargaining agreement "we did gain lib-

eral concessions from" the company.

I have never heard any responsible
official of this union defend the 1951
Pension Plan as anything more than
“a -foot in the door” on this issue. It
was accepted in 1951 as a part of a
21-cents package. We're all aware of
its deficiencies and all bargaining
councils since then have been working
toward correcting‘ these deficiencies.

The Research Director neither cre-
ated nor “sold” the pension plan.‘ On

-pensions, as on any other issue, the

Research Department does not set pol-’
icy. ‘My job, in the pension negotia-
tions was to provide technical assis-
tance to the‘Montana locals (as well
as to Kennecott, Phelps-Dodge, and
A.S.R. locals) in putting into final
form what they had previously accept-
ed in generahbargaining negotiations.
BERNARD W. STERN,
Research Director.

‘tracts. So the 5c-that Destefano talks
about covers both‘the'1949 and 1950
contracts. (Two for a nickel.) Also,
conditions were a lot different in
1950 than they were in 1949.

The next point ‘DeSta.fano raises is
the negotiations '-this year. Lg’: us re-

mind everyone that President John ri H

Clark participated in every _negotia-
tion session this year in Montana. Not
only this year, but every _year since
1936; so neggtiations are not solely
Mason-McLean’s responsibility. The
wage offer this year was made simul-
taneously when it was made in the
East. There was practically a_ couple
.of hours difference when the proposal
was made in the East and the~West.
Who forced Anaconda to make‘ the
offer?-—Was it the threat of a, strike
in the Brass Plants on August 31st or
was it the threat of striking the Mines
in Butte and the Srnelters in Mon-
tana? He states no-preparations were

~ made for strikes in Montana. What a
laugh—in Montana we are prepared’

to strike tomorrow, and we might, if
we cannot settle a grievance, and we
have that right. The militant workers
in Montana do not need any education
to ‘strike—they strike and educate the
Company. The Company isn’t anxious

to take the Montana workers on, but"

some plants can shut down for 2 or
3. weeks for “vacation,”-iwe can’t.

_ Talking about education the Mon-
tana leadership were not educated in
some of the same “séhools”r which
some of the International people were
educated, We always steer clear“of
these —— schools that teach “world rev-
olution” and the communist party line
——Perhap‘s DeSta_fano agrees -with this
type of education. ‘ ~ _

Who is this DeStafano and why is
he throwing mud balls that some- one
, else is making for him? _

The present “leadership” the “com-
unity” a slate, should be defeated. Mc-
Lean and Mason should be elected, and
in the race for Board Member of Dis-
trict Six——that is up‘ to the member-
ship in District Six, and’ we are not
going to interfere ‘in their affairs-
and to DeStafa.no, keep out of dis-
trict “one” both personally and po-

litically; Maybe it was he that posted M

the. note -on the rest room door.

isnot for nothing that the enemies

 2.Smith Act, Taft—Hartley,, McCarran-
Walter, the Korean War, McCarthyism
and now the Butler Bill.‘ The intent of
all these __moves -has been to soften up
and divide the labor movement.

Drunk with some ‘initial successes,
they are now goingto try to. move in
for the ki1,1.'-In-‘oi-der to get, to this
point, they had as their first objective
that of weakening a_nd,‘if possible, de-

Once again I have the privilege of
standing for the office of Board Mem-
bersfor District 8. The confidence ex-
”tended me by my fellow members in
the District in this respect impresses
upon me the responsibilities of that
office and stresses the very vital issues -
that will be facing the International
:Board in this coming term; issues that
will arise from a threatening economic
recession in the form of unemployment, ;
wage cuts, speed-up and a further in-
vasion of the civil rights of Canadian
and U.S. workers. ’

-Tolcombat such a developing situa- -
_- tion will require the full resources of s
»_an _experienced, inilitant" and united

this type of leadership standing in this V

{Candidate for Board Member. ,Disi'rici' 7-

It is a high honor to be nominated
for continued leadership in our great
International Union.

It is one of the paradoxes of our
day that those/unions such as Mine-
Mill, noted for the most democratic
membership -control, should be the ones
most violently attacked for alleged
Outside control.

Most of our members. are well
of this old, time‘-worn game of the em-
ployers. It_ is unfortunate that— some
candidates" in this election should try
to‘use it for their own purposes.

, I am giving. my complete endorse-‘
ment and support to the “unity team”
of candidates—.Broth_ers Clark, Larson,
Howard, and Travis-——with special em-
phasis on the two who have opposition.
Maurice Travis and Asbury Howard
have given the _kind of, clear-sighted,
fighting leadership that .organiz_ed
workers need/and want. . 5 “

I am in support of the" proposed
amendments to. the Constitution. Those
aimed at strengthening the Canadian
section of our Union are especially
important. - CHASE POWERS_/

_Our Union and all labor, in the im-
mediate days ahead, will be faced with

increasing savage attacks by the em- *

‘ployersand their political agents. Only

a .strong united team, representative
of the membership, can effectively lead
our Union in this period. ‘

We believe that Brothers Clark, Lar-
son, Howard and Travis are that team.

For a more unified‘ and stronger
Mine-Mill, in the interests of all the
members and their families, we’ sup-
port John Clark for President, Orville
Larson for ,Western Vice President,
Asbury Howard for Eastern Vice Presi-
dent, and Maurice Travis for Secre-
tary-Treasurer. of our Union for the
next two years. ‘

on the membership in the District to

has directly contributed to the many‘

Ten delegates from four local gun-
ions representing one phosphate mine

and four fertilizer plants, along',wit.h 

District 5 Staff Representatives and
‘visitors from Local 838 and 843' in
Macon, met’ to‘ discuss forthcoming
contract and wagenegotiations and to
map a common bargaining program

and strategy. The meeting is an out-' i

growth of" the activities of the Mine
Mill Fertilizer-Phosphate‘ Council which
.was set up two years ago‘ and which

has been coordinating bargaining ac-_

tivities of the fertilizer and phosphate

. workers in District 5 since thattime.

The newly formed Joint Bargaining

Committee agreed on a ‘program of.

_economic demands and
plans to coordinate forthcoming nego-
tiations with ‘Virginia-Carolina which
will be carried on in widely scattered
sections of the South. The phosphate
mine and fertilizer plants represented
-at this conference are located in Mt.
