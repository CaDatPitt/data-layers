FASCISM AND THE TRADE UNION
MOVEMENT

By FRANCIS J. GORMAN

IRST of all, in analyzing the special fate of trade

unions under a fascist dictatorship, we should know what
the meaning of fascism is. Fascism is a form of government,
and is not the same as a democratic government, or a republic.
Fascism is not a system, though, not is it an economic theory.
For the same economic theory operates under fascism that oper-
ates in our so-called democracies-—that is, in countries like
America, Great Britain, Canada and so forth.

Fascism, then, has certain special political features which
differentiate it from other governments. Fascism is, first, the
complete disfranchisement of the people, and the complete
abolition of constitutional government. The second character-
istic is the supremacy of the military. Fascism is, in short, a
military dictatorship. Under fascism there can be no opposition
at the polls to the dictatorship, even though mock elections
are held. Concentration camps lie in wait for those who dare
protest the loss of their liberties and their constitutional guar-
antees. It makes no difference to the fascist war-lords whether

-you be a Democrat, a Republican, a Socialist or a Communist.

If you dare protest—even though you be a fa5cist——you are
promptly put in jail and subjected to what are reported to be
incredible tortures.

Why is this? Why is it necessary to use this brute force in
order to run a government and control a people? What is it
that fascism is trying to protect that it must crush the people
under aniron military heel? I; must, of course, be protecting

 

  

something the people do not approve of, otherwise force would
not be necessary.

We think it is a tottering, decaying economic system that
fascism is trying to protect. We think that when those who
hold the purse strings of a nation (and therefore control the
How of everyday necessities, through their control of the means
of producing these necessities) discoverthat the system which
makes their continued control possible is about to fall away
from them, they seize any means in their power to hold on.
We think that when a whole nation is plunged into starvation,
unemployment and degradation, and the people see no hope
of ‘real prosperity again, then these people begin to rise in
protest. This is when the lords of industry and finance get
frightened, and seek a puppet politician, such as Hitler, to be
the hero-dictator, and impose on a whole nation the forced
dictatorship of a very few individuals.

The fascist form of government, then, has its roots in the
economic system. It is for this reason that the danger of fascism
is so important to the workers and to the trade union move-
ment. .
The most obvious threat to the continued exploitation of
labor is, of course, the trade union movement. When the
wheels of industry get hopelessly clogged, and wages become
lower and lower, and productivity per worker rises higher and
_higher, the workers, where they are organized, protest in a
laody and demand redress.

It is against the trade union movement, then, that the ﬁrst
blow is leveled under fascism. The means by which the workers
can protest in a whole mass must be removed ﬁrst, otherwise
it will be impossible for the ruling few to force their will
on the people. So, the trade union movement is declared illegal,
and a gigantic system of company unionism is installed. This is
not fancy; it is fact. In both Nazi Germany and fascist Italy
the free trade unions have been wiped out, and organizations
under the direct control of tlig government have been put in

 

 

their place. Needless to say, the government representative sees
to it that no eﬂective economic action is possible for the
workers. i

When the workers’ means of mass protest is removed, the
fascists then feel free to do anything they like with working
conditions. Since the reason for a fascist dictatorship lies in
the fact that industry aims at maintaining and increasing its
profits by further lowering the standards of living of the
working people, the first thing which happens is that wages
are either directly cut, or they are indirectly cut through speed-
up and stretchout. Sometimes, indeed many times, both things
happen. The growing challenge of the unemployed as a result
of fascist dictatorship is throttled by placing the unemployed in
labor camps that take on the character of a reserve army, be-
cause the fascists need all the man-power they can lay their
hands on to continue to force their fascist dictatorship on the
people. They need it, also, to carry on their foreign wars for
colonial possessions.

Wars for colonial possessions are necessary to fascism.
Why? Because at home industry has become so crippled that
it cannot support the people, and it is necessary for the
fascists to expand into other countries in order to ﬁnd material
for exploitation. Here, again, this is not fancy theory, for all
the events of the past few years have proved this to be true.
Take Italy, for instance. When Mussolini had reached the end
of his rope in his own country, and when, despite the terror
of protest, groups of workers were going on strike for enough
money to buy bread for their children, I1 Duce had to seek
farther and find new territory and a war to take the people's
minds off their poverty and misery. He chose Ethiopia as a
likely ﬁeld for aggression.

Who fought this war for Mussolini and for the industrialists
who support and control Mussolini? Young men who had
never had a chance to earn their living. Boys who could not go

to school because their parents didn't even have enough money

11

 

 
 

for food, let alone the enormous tax burden imposed by the
fascist government. The unemployed fought the war—boys
who had never been gainfully employed, and men who had
been shoved out of industry because it could no longer
function properly and maintain them. In other words, the
workers fought the war. What will they get out of it-those
who were lucky enough to come back? More taxes, more un-
employment, more starvation in order that the military ex-

ploits in Ethiopia may be paid for.

Germany is doing the same thing. Germany is taking her
young men and forcing them to bear arms in defense of a
government they cannot believe in. Germany is forcing un-
employed workers into the army on pain of starvation and con-
centration camps if they do not ﬁght. Why? Germany, like
Italy, cannot stand up under the strain at home. Her industry
cannot absorb the nation’: available man-power any more than
Italy's could. Therefore, Germany is playing for high stakes
in Spain, hoping to get some colonial concessions out of
Franco if the rebels win, and hopingtto defeat the loyalist
government which will constitute a threat to fascism if it is
allowed to survive. Who are forced to ﬁght these foreign war:
for Hitler? The workers‘. And the German workers will get
no more out of I-Iitler’s exploits than the Italian workers, be-
cause there is nothing for them to gain!

In the United States the workers still have a chance to save

themselves from the barbarous horrors of fascism. The trade.

union movement still has a chance to survive, and grow
stronger and stronger. We do not have fascism here yet. But
we have the elements of fascism here. Remember, its roots
are in the economic system, and we ourselves can see that our
economic system is not much different from that of Germany
or Italy. Do we not have millions of unemployed? Do we not
have terrible speed-up and stretchout? Has the workers’ in-
come risen with the enormous upward leap of proﬁts? No. We

are headed for the same thing if we don’t watch out.

In the textile industry, for instance, hundreds of manu-
facturers recently announced "wage increases.” Upon in-
vestigation, we discovered that these “increases” were decreases
because simultaneously the workload was increased, and work-
ers were laid oif. Actually, the mill-owners saved money by their
"wage increases.” Why did they do this? Because the threat
of organization is becoming more pressing. Because the work-
ers are becoming aroused at their continued exploitation in the
face of exorbitant proﬁts, and are beginning again to want the
union for protection.

The same thing occurred in the steel and automobile in-
clustries.

These manufacturers, in addition to trying to fool the work-
ers into thinking they got increase: when actually they got
decrease: and men were laid off, are preparing for days to
come when these workers will rise up and demand real in-
creases through their union. They are laying in stocks of tear
gas, machine guns, billies and other weapons of modern war-
fare to use against the workers when they strike for their
rights. They are hiring spies and stool-pigeons to tell them
what the workers are saying, and what the plans of the union
are. In these ominous facts we can see the forerunner of
fascism in the United States. There is, however, one important
difference. The workers still have recourse to the courts; they
still have the constitutional right to fight for higher wages,
shorter hours and less workload. Trade unions are still legal
in the United States.

It is this fundamental, democratic right which we must all
protect and extend. If we wait until our unions are smashed
we will have a fascist dictatorship before we can do anything
to stop it. We must, therefore, not only protect what member-
ship we now have, but extend that membership to the millions
now unorganized.

In France and in Spain the workers realized before it was
too late that they must take stgps to safeguard their constitu-

I

  

tional guarantees. They realized that their unions alone were
not enough to protect their economic interests. They formed a
People’s Front. In the United States we will call it a Labor
Party, probably. But it is essentially the same thing.

In Spain the reactionaries, desperately struggling against
the inevitable collapse of their complete control over the po-
litical and economic processes of the country, rose up in insur-
rection against the legal government. They made war on the
government which the Spanish people had voted for at the
polls. This shows us that we are in no mean struggle in this
fight to preserve democracy. Those who want to destroy it will
stop at nothing.

Another terrible thing comes out in the Spanish conflict
which is of vital importance to American workers. This is the

' fact that it is no longer just a ﬁght between Spanish liberals

and Spanish reactionaries. It is a fight between democracy and
fascism. It is an international ﬁght for supremacy. This
means that we, too, are involved,» even though our country
may be formally out of it, because we, too, are believers in
democracy and are against the forces of fascist reaction.
The only course for American trade unionists to follow, we
feel, is the immediate building of a broad, all-inclusive anti-
fascist People's Front movement, the building, in other words,
of the Labor Party. We may have to fight for this Labor
Party, as the Spanish workers are doing. We may not, on the

other hand. But if we are determined enough, it is not the .

fascists but ourselves who will decide whether or not progress
is allowed a free course.

It will do us no good to say: “Maybe if we don’t form a
People's Front, or a Labor Party, we can hold oli fascism.”
The German and Italian workers had no People's Front and
no Labor Party, and they got fascism just the same. The
Spanish workers at least have a good ﬁghting chance of win-
ning. Without a People’s Front or a Labor Party, we will
not even have a ﬁghting chance.

H

 

 

We know the terrible consequences to the working class
of a fascist dictatorship. We know, also, the means by which
we can ﬁght and defeat reaction if we begin soon enough.
We have two courses, then, to pursue: first, building and
strengthening our trade union movement until the millions
of workers in mass production industries are organized; and
second, building and strengthening our Labor Party until we
have a solid People’s Front against the power of industry and
wealth which would keep us in subjugation at the point of a
bayonet and make us starve without a word of protest.

THE LABOR PROBLEM
IN GERMANY

By ALFONS GOLDSCHMIDT

EFORE the Hitler regime, Germany was the classic
B country of labor organization. Not only from the point
of view of numbers, but of form and methods, the
workers’ organizations served as models for workers? move-

0 ments in other countries. Organization into labor unions as

well as into labor parties was, with some interruption, growing
steadily for decades, and reached an enormous volume after
the war. The members of the general German league of
unions increased from a little more than 2,000,000 in 1914,
to almost 8,000,000 five years after the war. The drawing up of
trade union agreements between the workers andiemployers
became so common in Germany that the number of those con-
tracts grew from 7,819 for 107,503 factories with 1,120,000

' men in 1918, to 10,768 contracts for 890,237 enterprises, with

about 14,500,000 employees. In the last years before Hitler
no important industrial undertaking was made outside of these

‘ agreements. The solution by arbitration of differences between -

employers and employees played a decisive role in the policy
of both sides. Strikes, lock-outs, and all the principal problems
of labor were settled in this manner. ‘

But this was not a quiet development. The struggle for
unions and union rights was very diﬁicult, and the way toward
a strong position of the unions was paved with thousands of
victims. That the inﬂuence of the union system did not cover
the demands and necessities of Germany's labor became more

evident during the war, when the growth of unions ceased, due
15

 

 

to military economic centralization, and after the war when
a system of labor councils in the factories was established by
law to give the workers a more direct inﬂuence in and control
of industrial conditions. Of course, these labor councils never
became an effective instrument of the labor movement, nor
a strong complement to the unions, but were utilized by the
unions to organize workers within the plant.

The old theoretical struggle within the unions and the
Social-Democratic Party of Germany about the necessity and
the opportunity of a general strike was not solved before the
war; but after the war during the “Kapp Putsch.” Then
the main question at issue in this struggle, namely, whether the
unions should merely be a weapon for the improvement of the
economic conditions of the German workers or, ultimately, a
political weapon too, was answered by the fact that the work-
ers’ parties and the unions faced the danger of being entirely
destroyed. Therefore immediately after the beginning of the
reactionary "putsch” the general strike was proclaimed and
served effectively. Thus the first reactionary uprising after
the war was broken down.

But the economic crisis of Germany, especially the increase
of unemployment after 1929 to about 9,000,000 out of work
and the millions working only some few hours during the

day, became so threatening that the opposition within the

unions and parties and from outside of the unions grew against
the union policy of the reformist leaders. The re-establish-
ment of the political and administrative power of the Social-
Democratic Party in 1928, backed by union leaders and some
lower functionaries, proved to be a hindrance to a more de-
cisive course of labor against the rapidly organizing forces of
reaction, and especially the Hitler movement. I believe for
my part that the various offers by the Communist Party of
Germany to the leaders of the Social-Democratic Party to act
in common were rejected by the Social-Democrats especially

because of the restrictive inﬂuence of hundreds of thousands
I7

   

of Social-Democrats holding positions in public and semi-
public administrations. The more gigantic the volume of the
Socialist unions and Party became, the weaker became the will
of the reformist leaders and officeholders.

In this atmosphere, the reactionary pre-Hitler German gov-
ernment could plan to stabilize Germany’s capitalism on the
basis of the unions; to make the unions, so to speak, a firm
ground for proﬁt calculation even after this calculation had
been shattered by the crisis. It was no longer possible for any
industrial enterprise in Germany to plan its business for more
than some weeks or months ahead. Although the calculation-
destroying inflation was over, the period of deﬂation did not
bring the slightest security to German capitalism. No balance
existed any more.

Under such conditions the pre-Hitler government was ready
to work together with the unions, that is, to grant the workers
a certain degree of social security on the basis of reduced
wages, hoping to stabilize proﬁts through long-term trade
union agreements. This is one way for capitalism to avoid
an entire collapse temporarily.

Under the Bruening government a law was passed which cut
wages by 10 to 25 per cent. All the reformist union leaders
agreed with the measure and fought in the unions to maintain
it. This was their first step in aiding fascism and helping
ﬁnance-capital in Germany to overcome the crisis.

It is characteristic that one of the most important members
of the Nazi party, Gregor Strasser, who was murdered by
his former friends in June, 1934, was in favor of an alliance
of Germany’s reaction with the unions. Those hesitations,
the conservatism of many Socialists in secure administrative
positions, the weakening of the will of the leaders by discus-
sions of possible uniﬁcation with the I-Iindenburg government,
etc., cleared the way for Hitler.

I should like to relate here a characteristic discussion which

I had in Berlin with the Socialist Premier of Prussia, and
18

 

 

 

other high government oﬂicials and union leaders, about two

weeks after Hitler came to power. Then the unions were
not yet destroyed, and the Socialist government in Prussia,
ousted some days later, had at its disposal many millions of
uniﬁed workers, the Prussian police and, not least, the Com-
munist Party, which was ready to help: that is, to fight with
the Socialist Party in this day of terrible emergency.

In the course of this discussion I asked the Prussian Premier
if the Socialist Party would not immediately act. “It is already
ﬁve minutes after twelve,” I remarked to him. But he turned
furiously against me, crying: “We are Democrats and Social-
Democrats and we acknowledge the right and duty of Presi-
dent Hindenburg to entrust the greatest party with the organ-
ization of the government. But the greatest party is actually
the Nazi party, whose representative is Hitler. This is our
Constitution and we shall be constitutional to the end.” I
objected, saying that Hitler had nothing to do with the Con-
stitution, and that it was his trick to misuse the Constitution
with the aim of violating the Constitution “legally” after
coming to power. I then asked the union leader if the unions
would not do something at once. He replied: “We stand
ready-armed and we need only press the button to have the
general strike effective within one hour.” I asked him when
he would press the button. Then this man, who was to be
Premier of Prussia for two days longer, jumped to his feet
shouting: "We will proclaim the general strike at the moment
Hitler dares to violate one paragraph of the Constitution.”
This is clear enough. I left the meeting horribly depressed and
saw the entire labor movement of Germany breaking down.

The Communist press was already suppressed, the persecu-
tion of political opponents had already begun, Berlin was
covered with a pestilence of Nazi espionage. In short, the
Constitution had already disappeared and the unions remained
passive with their weapons at their feet, until they were

entirely destroyed. The button was not pressed; but the Social-
19

 

in Party and all the German labor organizations, economic
and political, a proud army of direct members and sympathiz-
ers of approximately 12,000,000 in the last elections, disap-

’ peared.

The Constitution was so extremely well interpreted and exe-
cuted in the end that it not only became a scrap of paper, but
an instrument to be falsiﬁed, and violated to such an extent
that it turned into a direct and deadly instrument against the
labor, movement in Germany with all its glorious tradition.
There were sacriﬁces of blood, money, and enthusiasm, to-
gether with destruction of thousands of buildings, papers and
reviews, textbooks and schools. Members were killed or in-

carcerated in concentration camps and prisons.

In 1932 Hitler addressed a large crowd of coal and iron
industrialists at the town hall in Duesseldorf in Rhenania. This
group was headed by Fritz Thyssen, a son of one of the most
successful expansionists in Germany’s heavy industry. The
address was not published, but one of the participants told me
on the occasion of a speech which I delivered against Hitler
at the same place two weeks later: “None of us believe in this
nonsense on economics, but what shall we do? Through Hitler
we can get rid of the unions. This is our aim because the
unions, with their policy on wage scales and -working con-
ditions, deprive us of every opportunity to make a reasonable
proﬁt.”

This was indeed the main idea of Thyssen in particular,
who was more or less weakened by the crisis. The idea was
so to change the workers’ organizations as to attempt to make
of the unions a real instrument for fascist policies.

Hitler was from the start ﬁnanced by these magnates like
Thyssen, and with brief interruptions when he did not seem
as successful as he should, his private army was fed and nour-
ished out of the industrial funds, with the aid especially
of the big landowners in Pomerania and Eastern Prussia. So

20

 

 

the organizations of workers of Germany were entirely
changed into what Hitler called the "Labor Front.”

Hitler had hoped to enter upon a period of world prosperity,
with Germany sharing in it so that he could get the glory of
one who had supposedly saved the German people from its
unemployment and misery.

One could realize from the start of the Hitler regime, how-
ever, that Germany would not become prosperous, even if
international capital should enjoy a period of seeming prosper-
ity. The only way for the Hitler regime was the increase of
armament and of all the so-called heroisms and sacriﬁces, can-
cellation of the Treaty of Versailles, reoccupation of the Rhine-
land zone, aid for the fascists in Spain, etc. All the violations
of treaties, the great words in bad German, were and are
merely smokescreens for the main and real purpose of the
Hitler regime, namely, to give back to capitalists one hundred-
fold and more of what Hitler had received. For some time the
method looked successful to those who do not understand the
process of the creation of value and least of all the danger
of a fast development of constant capital. Hitler had promised
to eliminate unemployment. So began the famous labor strug-
gles, and indeed millions of unemployed thus became “em-
ployed” in a sense. But the question is, what is employment?

The so-called “just” wages of the Nazis are today ten to
fourteen marks per week. This is less than the relief paid by
the republic before Hitler came to power. Labor becomes
more and more compulsory, and consequently the remunera-
tion lower and lower. Nazi industry and administration ex-
haust any and every opportunity to "squeeze out” the labor
force of the German workers. They proﬁt even from a fund
created for workers’ vacations. The land laborers are even
worse off than the industrial workers. To illustrate: A land
laborer receives, with a family of nine children on a large
farm not far from Berlin, in form of kind 465 marks, and in

form of cash 315 marks yearly, or 11 pfennigs per hour. There
are, as always in such situations, some categories of skilled
workers, especially armament workers, who are better paid,
but the average level of real wages is sinking rapidly. Accord-
ing to my calculation, the decrease of the average real wages
since the end of January, 1933, has been between 25 and 30
per cent. If we identify this decrease with the lowering of
purchasing power (purchasing power being power equal to
the market), then we have a reduction of the entire purchas-
ing power of Germany of from one quarter to one third, in-

clining more toward the latter than to the former ﬁgure.

Now let us turn to the problem of German territory. "A
people without space”—this was and is the slogan of German
reaction. Not a people without means, and real means, to use
their labor power; but without space. What is space? There is
a geographical and an economic space. They are not identical.
If these two places could be identiﬁed, then Brazil and Africa,
for instance, would be the wealthiest territories of the world.
The economic space depends directly upon the conditions of
labor power. The better those conditions, the larger the eco-
nomic space. As the conditions of German labor power, under
Nazi rule, are becoming worse and worse, Germany’s economic
space logically becomes more and more limited. That means
that Germany under another rule, not preparing for war, and
not confusing the armament race (that is, falsiﬁed employ-
ment) , with real employment, would have suﬂicient space for
at least twice its present population. It is necessary to change
our idea of territorial space because of the fundamental mis-

takes made in Nazi Germany and elsewhere. With the idea i

of space, we must change the idea of employment and unem-
ployment. I have devoted many years to the study of this
central problem and have come to the conclusion that the
identiﬁcation of territorial space and economic space is one
of the main causes of the dangerous theory of expansion which

infects millions of minds and enables the expansionists in
22

 

capitalist countries to go on with their destructive policy of
competition for the acquisition of colonies.

The slogan of self-suﬂiciency or “autarchy” is the same as
the slogan “people without space.” It is a kind of neo-mercan-
tilism, that means, monopolization of labor force in favor of
the sale of this cheap labor force on the world market, the
conquest of new colonies, conclusion of treaties with the same
tendency, the pressure for loans, raw materials, etc., by war
menaces, etc. This autarchy means a gigantic military camp
or fortress exploiting the labor force of the working man in
order to produce cheaply, and to increase the armament and
finally to replace their own sinking purchasing power or value
by victirnizing millions on the battleﬁelds. It is not by chance
that a general, namely, Goering, became the leader of this
process, with Dr. Schacht, a man without understanding of
economic laws, behind him.

Since the proclamation of the so-called new "Social Con-
stitution,” formulated in a law of January 20, 1934, "regulat-
ing national labor,” labor conditions have gone down.
Through this Constitution all the old rights of the workers
in the factory, permitting them to elect labor councils, were
abolished..Insteadithe Nazi government, under the cover of a
so-called election, actually appointed “trustees” of the Labor

' Front (called Vertrauensleute) . Under this new law the prin-

ciple of leadership in the interests of the factory owners was
carried through. All strikes were forbidden and any differences
as to working conditions, wages, etc., were left in the hands of
Nazi district functionaries. The old independent force of or-
ganized labor was wiped out. What had previously been a
Nazi policy since May 22,_ 1933, now became a law.

With the intensiﬁcation of the armament industry, the capi-
talist market became a state market without the disappearance
of capitalistic private property. This means that a regular cir-
culation no longer exists. Although under such conditions

German money value became more or less “empty,” it was
23

   

until now possible to maintain an apparent money stability
inside of Germany. Outside of Germany, that is, in the
sphere of a relatively regular circulation, the German mark
has no more purchasing power. Therefore the necessity of
obtaining foreign money by an increase of exports. Here we
have the cycle which it is impossible to avoid, and the danger
of the explosion of sinking labor power.

To continue this destructive and unproductive policy of
capitalist monopolization, Germany needs goods which it
has to import and pay for with foreign money. Here is a

list published by Dr. Schacht showing the percentage of,

foreign goods already consumed in Germany in 1934:

At present Germany is suffering from a terrible lack of
ironeore, which can only partially be supplied from within
Germany. In 1936 the import of iron was about 19,000,000
tons. against 3,400,000 tons in 1932. Here we have one of the
main causes of the Spanish "adventure” of Nazi Germany.

iHere we also have one of the main causes of German '3 war
Y

drive against France and of the Swedish fear of German at-
tacks. It is not a case of a crusade for the maintenance of

‘heroic Nazism, but for very concrete objectives.

The import of textile raw materials is also sinking rapidly,

and so it is and must be, much more than before, with all prod-

ucts (especially food) which Germany cannot raise in sufﬁ-
cient quantities for herself. The destruction of labor power can-
not remain unpunished. The regime has already spent about
25,000,000,000 marks for armament, and by the end of the
current year it will have spent, more or less, 40,000,000,000
marks. This horrible burden is carried by 15,000,000 work-
ers, millions of them not paid at all, or no better. than beggars.
Therefore the Nazi government feverishly makes propaganda
for the consumption of cabbage, carrots, forestry products,
etc. The production of "Ersatzstoife," that is, substituted raw
material and food, only accelerates the process of decline be-
cause of the enormous cost.

Although the dictator-general of Germany’s economy, Goet-
ing, menaces farmers and dealers for price speculation with
the severest punishment, the prices go their natural way, that
is, upwards. The rulers will soon realize, as did Germany’s
imperialists during the war, that there is no possibility of stop-
ping this process. In 1932, at the lowest point of Germany's
food consumption, the nourishment of the German people,
especially of the German workers, was better than now. Even
at that time they had more butter thanicannon.

1 The promise that the workers should share the proﬁts of
capital has not been fulﬁlled. To submit to the individual

lead_ership of the factory owners does not at all mean partici-
25 v

 

 

pation in their dividends or, if it does, then this participation
is a fake, the so-called dividend-sharing amounting to no more
than three, seven or ten marks per year. This curious type of
"common-sense” economy becomes visible in the enormous
rise of war industry proﬁts and in the income of Nazi lead-
ers. Goering receives 86,000 marks as president of the impo-
tent Reichstag, while every deputy receives 17,400 marks per
year for doing nothing except saying “yes” to Hitler once or
twice during the year. Schacht, the President of the Reichs-
bank, who praises the sense for thrift, receives more than 300,-
000 marks per year, and so it is with hundreds and thousands
of Nazi leaders, and this after the promise by Hitler to end
the administrative corruption and the increase of "overhead”
expenses. All this has to be paid by the workers.

The Hitler regime some time ago began its fifth year of
social-economic destruction. A survey of the labor conditions
in the four years of Hitlerism reveals on one side an increase
of the employed workers from 12,300,000 in 1932 to 16,000,-
000 in 1936. But the total wages at the end of 1935 were
only 31,700,000,000 marks, in comparison with 26,000,000,-
000 marks in 1932. This means that while the number of
employed increased 25 per cent, more or less, the total in-
come increased only 20 per cent. So state the oil-icial sta-
tistics. In reality, however, the income decreased from the
insurance of unemployed about 1,900,000,000 per year.
Furthermore, an enormous increase of taxes, money for
social insurance, and so-called voluntary contributions, must
be added to- this loss, aside from the increase in prices of
between 12‘/2 and 15 per cent. Using oﬂicial statistics we find
labor power in Germany 25 per cent weaker than at the begin-
ning of the Hitler regime. In reality I believe that 30 per cent
would be nearer the truth. This process of decline is now going
on faster than before, because of the enormous amount of
expenditure for armaments. In 1937 the volume of new con-
stant capital of this entirely uxziproductive type will be 12,000,-

i 5

 

000,000 marks, that is, a little less than one-half of the total
real wages in 1932, and a good deal more than one third of
the total real wages in 1935.

In some industries, especially the armament industry, the

real wages are higher than, for instance, in the textile industry.

In the textile industry the weekly income of a male worker
was in June, 1936, no more than 22.72 marks. If we subtract
taxes, so-called voluntary contributions, and so forth, as well

A, as the increase in prices, the weekly real income of this type

of worker cannot be more than eighteen marks, or a little
more than 57 weekly. That is much less than the average
relief allotment in the United States. A worker’s family of
four persons receives less than $2 per head. Food, clothing and
expenses for shelter are the main expenses of the German work-
ers. One can now imagine the misery already existing in Ger-
many and growing every day. It is true that the number of
armament workers increased enormously, but millions and
millions have a lower standard of living than ever before.
Their situation is worse than the situation of the unemployed
before the Hitler ragime.

On the other hand the labor time increased from 6.9 hours
in 1932, to 7.5 hours in 1935. The total labor volume was, at
the end of 1935, 46 per cent higher than in 1932. While the
German workers had to work 46 per cent hours more than in
1932, and at present even more (some of them are working
100 hours per week), the real income sank destructively. The
productivity per labor hour has increased so that the worker
expends now much more energy per hour for much less real
income. ,

Here we have another picture of the real economic con-
dition of Germany today. It is the tragedy of capitalism of
this time in general, and especially in the fascist countries,
where unproductive constant capital is built with a tempo
never seen before. Under such conditions we cannot speak at
all of even the slightest stability of labor power, if we under-

stand this to mean the daily restoration ' of labor’: own
power by at least the necessary quantity and quality of food
and shelter. The houses of workers are to a large extent in a
miserable condition. Today 1,500,000 Germans do not live in
their own apartments, and are obliged to live in a small and
unhealthy part of the homes of others. Most of these Germans
are workers. Millions lived in stables, concentration camps,
forced labor camps, and so forth.

The consequence of this entire situation in Germany is the
cry for exports, credit, colonies, raw material, and food from

outside. The participation of Nazi Germany in the Spanish

war is an instance of such violent "business,” paid for with
the strength and blood of the German workers and soldiers.
How long can a country go on under such conditions?

The answer must be: not long. The reckoning is at hand.
In spite of Nazi repression and destruction, the oldﬁghting
force of labor is again beginning to assert itself. We can see
already the coming regime of a free Germany, which is now
being shaped in the People's Front.

ITALIAN TRADE UNIONS
UNDER FASCISM

By _ GAETANO SALVEMIN I

NEW economic and political machinery has been in- I V

1 vented in Italy by Mussolini. It has been imitated by
Hitler in Germany. It has been introduced into Austria after
the suppression of the Socialists. In December, 1934, the New
York Time: announced that former King Alfonso of Spain
and the Duke of Alba, “scion of one of Spain’s most dis-
tinguished lines,” had declared themselves in favor of the
corporative state. In England Sir Oswald Mosley assures his
countrymen that they will reach the heights of felicity when
they adopt the corporative state. In this country Bishop Joseph
Schrembs of Cleveland, an admirer of Father Coughlin, holds
up the protection that Mussolini has given to labor as an
example to American capitalism (New York Herald Tribune,
August 6, 1936).

What are the essential features of the Italian corporative
state?

I. The Organization:

Italy is divided into provinces. In each province a single
organization may enjoy legal recognition for each group of
employers, employees, or professional classes. The law admits
the existence of de facto organizations outside the legal ones.
But no one has yet dared to form any such de facto organ-
ization. Such an attempt would be regarded as a subversion of
the national order and would be severely penalized.

Nobody may join the oﬂicial fascist organization of his

A 2

 

 

trade if the secretary does not admit him, and the secretary
may expel any members who, in his opinion, are “undesirable.”
But everybody must contribute annual dues to the organization
for his trade whether he belongs to it or not.

The fascist organizations are grouped into nine National
Confederations: four for the employers, four for the employ-
ees, and one for the professional classes.

The presidents of the National Confederations are appointed
by Mussolini. The oﬂicials of‘ the subordinate organizations
are designated by the presidents of the Confederations after
consulting the leaders of the Fascist Party. They can be re-
moved by the government if they fail to manifest a sufhcient
degree of "undoubted national [that is, fascist] loyalty.”

Thus, the ofiicials are not "elected” by the members, but

V are "appointed” from above. They are accountable not to the

membership of their organizations, but to the leaders of the
party in power.

In 1927, a few fascists timidly requested that the system of
free election for officials be adopted, afhrming that there was
no longer any danger that men antagonistic to the party in
power might gain control of the unions. The Secretary General
of the party rejected the proposal, proclaiming that "the sys-
tem of appointing ofhcials from above, a systemfundamentally
fascist, had given excellent results, such as that of suppressing
every survival of democratic mentality. We are an army of
believers, not a mass of organized members.” The request for
elective directors was renewed at the beginning of 1930. But
the Fascist Grand Council, which is the highest governing body
in the regime, denied the request, declaring that “no modifi-
cation should take place in the system of designating directors,
a system which embodies the spirit of fascist legislation.”

II. Who I 3 Master of the Machine?

So far there would seem to be no difference between the
associations of the employers, on the one hand, and the unions

 

of employers or the organizations of the professional classes,’

on the other. All have their oﬂicials appointed from above.

But the conditions actually obtaining in the different classes
are not the same.

Among the employers there is a sharp division between the
big industrialists, landowners, and bankers,iand the small fel-
lows. When an oﬂicial is to be appointed in an association of
employers, the big business men-—-few in number-—gather at
their business or social meetings, choose their man of conﬁ-
dence, ring up some of the leaders of the party in power, give
the name of the best man, and the best man is appointed. For
instance, the President of the Confederation of the Industrial
Employers today is Count Volpi, who may be called the
Italian Rockefeller. It cannot be doubted that he represents
perfectly Italian big business. ~

The small industrial employer, the small shopkeeper, the
small farmer, do not take part in this game. They have no
voice in the appointment of the oflicials of their own associ-
ations. The directors of the associations of employers are the
representatives of those big business men who control the as-
sociations of each group—-and not of the little fellows.

As regards the workers, there is no difference among them
of most powerful and less powerful, of big and small. All are
small, all are powerless. They are too numerous. And they
are not allowed to meet and discuss their business. They can-
‘not ring up the leaders of the party in power and lay before
them their own nominees. The directors of their organiza-
tions do not represent anybody: they are merely the men of
confidence of the party in power which control their unions.

This holds good for the professional classes also.

In the fascist corporative state big business is an active
factor and runs the associations of employers. The classes of
the small employers and of the employees and the professional
classes are passive elements, subject to whatever their oflicials
think ﬁt. Small employers, workers, and professional classes

31

 

  

have in the fascist organizations no greater authority than
have the animals in a society for the rescue of animals. I

This is a basic point if one wants to understand fascist trade
unionism. But the admirers of fascism take good care never
to give any concrete information about this phase of fascist
trade unionism. If you read a lecture on The Aims and Poli-
cies of the Fascist Regime in Italy, which was delivered at the
Institute of Public Affairs of the University of Virginia in
1934, and which President Butler of Columbia University pref-
aced in the monthly publication of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, you will learn that “each member of
an organization casts a ballot in the election which creates its
directive body.” Read the recent book of Professor Schneider’
of Columbia University, The Fascist Government of Italy,
p. 81, and you will learn that the trade organizations in Italy
are “self-governing,” and they practically afford the only
example in Italy “of electionism or of oﬂice coming from be-
low instead of from above.” Both of these statements ignore
the basic fact: the complete suppression of freedom of activity
of rank-and-file members in fascist trade unions.

III. Labor Agreements and Labor Court

When one has formed a clear idea of the legal organiza-
tions and their officials, one can fully grasp what is meant
when one hears that all contracts concerning wages, hours of
work, etc., are drawn up by the organizations of employers
and employees and that these contracts are binding on all the
employers and workers, whether they are members of the or-
gani.zations or not. Those contracts are drawn up by men in
the conﬁdence of the big employers and by officials who have
been appointed from above to control the unions of the em-
ployees. The membership of the unions has no say in such
matters. If anyone is not satisﬁed and ventures to grumble,
the secretary of his union turns him out of the union, and so

32

 

 

 

all the members who remain within the union become satisﬁed .

and contented.

Strikes are forbidden and punished by a severe and progres-
sive scale of penalties, the maximum being seven years’ im-
prisonment.

In July, 1926, about 1,400 workers, most of them women,
went on strike at a factory in Carosia, near Genoa. "Since
the fascists have had the upper hand,” said some of these wo-
men, "we are isolated and leaderless. The employers have

V seized the opportunity of reducing our wages by nearly 40 per

cent.”

Some of the women, suspected of being leaders of the strike,
were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.

Lockouts are forbidden as well as strikes. Thus, the fas-
cists claim that capital is put on the same level as labor. But
where strikes cannot take place, Iockouts become unnecessary.
Moreover, the law, while forcing workmen to labor under
threat of imprisonment, cannot force an employer to give work
if he declares that he can no longer maintain the old wages.
The stoppage of work is then not a lockout, but a closing
down induced by a "justified motive.”

When the representatives of the employers and the oﬂicials
who run the workers’ unions do not agree, their dispute is to
be decided by the Labor Court, either regarding contracts in
course of execution or those in process of formation. The
court consists of a judge and two experts, and all experts must
be university graduates. In this way the workers are automati-
cally excluded from the court.

The fascists justify the abolition of the right to strike by the
following theorem:

“The state is no longer the state, i.e., is no longer sovereign,

if it is not able to deal out justice in conﬂicts between social
classes and categories, forbidding them to exercise private jus-
tice, just as this is forbidden to individuals and families.”

But in labor disputes who is the state? In the “corporative
33

 

 

  

state” we ﬁnd on the bottom rung the men of conﬁdence of
the big employers and the officials appointed from above to
run the unions of the employees, and on the upper rung we
ﬁnd the judges and experts of the labor courts. On neither of
these two rungs have the working people any real representa-
tion. Therefore the "state” turns out to be the employing
class. '

IV. "Brother: in the Fascist Family”

Under the fascist corporative system you are the owner of
your land, of your factory, of your sheep, of your shoes,
but you are not the owner of your manual work. If your labor
is all that you possess, that labor does not belong to you. Oil}-
cials, whose deeds you may not criticize and whom you may
not dismiss, dictate to you as to how many hours a _day you
shall work, what wages you shall be content with, and what
fine you must pay to your employer if you are not industrious
enough. V

A socialist state would nationalize capital as a means of
redeeming the worker from the slavery of wages. The fascist
state nationalizes labor and hires it out to private capital at
the price which the state itself—that is to say, the oﬂicials
of the unions appointed by the leaders of the party in power
and the judges of the labor court—deems expedient.

A national confederation of fascist unions is what in the
United States would be regarded as a colossal company union
comprising all the workers in a given trade all over the country.

In Germany the Nazis have devised a slightly diﬁerent trick
for the enslaving of labor. In Nazi Germany there is among
the workers in each factory a Nazi group-—a i‘cell,” as they
call it. The employer, who is no longer called employer but
"leader,” nominates from among the members of the cell the
representatives of the workers. These representatives are called
“trustees.” The workers of the factory have the right to accept

or to reject the "trustees” so nominated, but they have no
34

 

right to vote on a different list. All that they are allowed to
vote on is whether they shall or shall not swallow the list of
persons nominated by the employer. If the majority rejects
the list, the Nazi party takes the matter into its own hands and
the "trustees” are appointed by the leaders of the party. Wages
are ﬁxed by the employer. If the “trustees” designated by the
employer or by the leaders of the party find that wages are too
low, the matter is settled by the labor court, which is analogous
to the Italian court of the same name.

Actually, what the Nazis have done is to combine the
Italian system, which puts the unions under the control of the
fascist party, with the American system known as the company
union, which puts the unions under the control of the employ-
ers. ,
There is, however, a difference between Italian and German
unions and the American company unions. In Italy and Ger-
many the official unions have been made compulsory by law,
while in the United States, the workers are not legally obliged
to join the company unions but may even, if they so wish,
oppose them. If they join the company unions and are not
satisﬁed with the results, they have only themselves to blame.

The three systems have this in common: that the aim of the
employers, whether in fascist Italy, in Nazi Germany, or in
democratic America, is to destroy the independent unions.

In February, 1928, Mussolini described the working of his
system in the following words: "I declare that henceforth
capital and labor shall have equal rights and duties as brothers
in the fascist family.”

V. National "Election:”

When a new Chamber of Representatives is to be formed,
the provincial and national officials of each Confederation meet
in Rome and draw up a list of their own nominees. The
procedure of nomination is as follows: The president of the
Confederation, who receives his appointment from Mussolini,

35

  

in accord with the national leaders of the fascist party, who
are likewise appointed by Mussolini, prepares the list of nomi-
nees, reads it out to the meeting of the officials, and the latter
approve it en bloc by acclamation. The confederations are
allotted 800 nominees.

Two hundred more candidates are nominated by bodies
of a cultural or charitable nature designated by the govern-
ment. The method of nomination is the same for these priv-
ileged bodies as for the confederations: the President of the
body, who has been appointed by the Secretary General of the
fascist party, who in his turn has been appointed by Musso-
lini, announces the names and the meeting accepts them by
acclamation. “Authority comes from above.”

The names of the thousand nominees are then “presented”
to the Grand Council of Fascism, which is a body of about
thirty high fascist personages chosen by Mussolini. The Grand
Council draws up the list of the 400 future representatives. But
it is not restricted to the thousand nominees. It may also choose
persons who are not on the list. Such unlimited discretion
makes the “presentation” of the preliminary list a mere farce.

After the Grand Council has “designated” the 400 repre-
sentatives, the names go to the electorate for "ratiﬁcation.”
For this purpose the whole country forms a single electoral
unit. The voter is asked to declare whether he approves or not
of the whole list of 400 names. He is at liberty to answer only
"yes” or "no” for the whole list.

In other words, the task of nominating the candidates does

not belong to political parties, but to the presidents of the
confederations and other privileged bodies, who directly or
indirectly are appointed by Mussolini. The right to elect the
deputies belongs not to the electorate but to the Grand Council
of Fascism. whose members are likewise appointed by Musso-
lini. And the electorate is left with the sole task of saying
“yes”  “no.”

When it has to say "yes” or “no,” there is no opposition

36

 

 

5.:

press, no opposition party organization, no possibility of  V

paigning against the official list, and no opposition candidates.
Whoever refuses to go to the polls reveals himself as an op-
ponent of Mussolini and becomes an outlaw.

On coming into the polling station, the voter receives two
ballot papers, a tricolor one with the world "yes” and a white
one with the word "no.” The tricolor ballot is printed on
paper so thin and transparent that even when folded it can
easily be distinguished from the white one. The voter, how-
ever, is allowed to retire into an enclosed space and there,
in the most absolute secrecy, to put one of the two ballots--
the one which he does not wish to utilize-—into a box. When
he leaves the enclosed space, he must hand over the other
ballot, the good one, to the recording oﬂicer. The "election”
of 1929 resulted in 8,500,000 "yeses” and 136,000 "noes,”
while the "election” of 1934 resulted in 10,000,000 “yeses”
and only 10,000 “noes.”

In speaking of fascist "elections,” Mussolini’s propaganda
agents state that in Italy today voting is no longer done in
territorial but in occupational constituencies, and they take
great pains to explain that man's major interest is not residence

. but occupation, and that the citizen should vote for his own

representative within his own class and not according to the
chance of his residence. This political doctrine would be de-
batable, if in fascist Italy the representatives really were
elected by the membership of each confederation. As a matter
of fact, the nomination is made by the presidents of the con-
federations and other privileged bodies and the choice is made
by the members of the Grand Council of Fascism. All these
gentlemen are Mussolini’s appointees. Their operations have
nothing to do either with territorial or with occupational con-
stituencies. When the moment comes for the voter to answer
“yes” or “no,” he gives his answer not in an occupational
but in a national, i.e., a huge territorial, constituency, and he

must answer "yes” if he does not wish to find himself in jail.

As far as the 400 representatives are concerned, they repre-
sent no one and nothing. No bond unites them to any electo-
rate. Those who are constrained to say “yes” enjoy no means

 

for either approving or disapproving them. The so-called rep-—

resentatives are under the military discipline of the fascist
party and both in the House and outside must obey Mussolini’:
orders.

VI. The "Corporations”

Above the organizations of employers and employees we
ﬁnd in Italy the twenty-two so-called “corporations.”

What are these corporations?

They are bodies, each one of which deals with a given
category of industry, agriculture or commerce. For instance,

one deals  textiles, another with the production and com-

merce in wheat, another with the steel industry, and so on.

The members forming these corporations fall into four
classes: (1) cabinet ministers and high ofhcials, who are ap-
pointed by Mussolini; (2) experts, who are appointed by
Mussolini; (3) members of the Fascist Party, who are ap-
pointed by the Secretary General of the party, who is in his
turn appointed by Mussolini; and (4) so-called representatives
of the employers and employees, who are designated by the
presidents of the confederations, who are appointed by Mus-
solini, and who do not have to render any account of their
acts to the membership of the organizations, as you would
expect in an "army of believers.” Of course, the employers are
represented by big business men, while the employees are
represented by bureaucrats. i

Mussolini is the president of all these councils and designates
their vice-presidents. He is entitled to change the composition
of the councils whenever he thinks ﬁt and to rid himself of
councillors who have become “indiscreet.” If the opinions of
the councils do not fall in with Mussolini’s opinion, he is em-

powered to reject them, and he can even prevent these opinion:
38

 



 

from being published in the press. The councils are convoleed‘
at Mussolini’s pleasure. If he never convoked them, nobody

would object and things would go on just the same.

The twenty-two corporations were inaugurated on Novem-
ber 10, 1934, and first began to function in January, 1935.
Until now all they have done is to give advisory opinions on
minor technicalities; as, for example, what names are to be
given to the different types of cheese, so that one may not
be confused with another; whether it is possible to use silk
produced in Italy instead of cotton imported from abroad, etc.
Yet they began to perform miracles many years before they
came into the world. If you doubt my words, consult the 1929
edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and you will find that
the corporations are there described as if they were already
functioning in reality.

How shall we explain this fact? Nothing is easier. Towards
the end of 1926, Mussolini christened the Italian fascist dic-
tatorship as the corporativc state, Dictatorship did not enjoy
a high reputationwin ch¢‘re“ct»r'ds’ of history. Mussolini did not
relish the idea of passing down to history as a mere imitator
of old discredited experiments. He therefore clothed himself

A in a brand-new mantle, the mantle of the corporative state,

the institutions of which had to supersede the outmoded
institutions of democracy. And behold! As soon as Mussolini
spoke of the corporative state, all the fascist propaganda
agents outside Italy began to describe the corporations, which
did not yet exist, and to extol the miracles which they were
allegedly performing.

In many countries today there are, side by side with the
Ministers of Labor, advisory councils, partly elected by eco-
nomic groups of the population, partly appointed by the gov-
ernment. They can exercise a remarkable inﬂuence on the
policies of the governments, since their advice is published by
the press,is publicly discussed, and cannot be ignored by the
Ministers. If one said that rhage are today in Italy “advisory

 

  

, councils” on economic questions, that the members of such

councils are all in the hollow of Mussolini’s hand, and that
such councils are powerless if Mussolini does not agree with
them, everybody would at once understand that such institu-
tions are the most futile, bureaucratic bodies that the world
has ever seen. Fascist propaganda agents take good care never
to explain the mode of recruitment of the corporations and
their powers and procedure. Read Professor Schneider's book
(pp. 97-100), for instance, and you will know just as much
about the characteristic features of the Italian corporations as
you know about the corporations on the planet Mars.

VII. Class Cooperation

That the oflicials of the fascist unions and the corporations
are not “elected” from below, but are “appointed” from above,
that the members have no say in the choice of the ofﬁcials and
in the conduct of their unions, that the officials concoct the
labor agreements, and that labor disputes are ruled on in the
last resort by a Qggrt in which the workers are not rep-
resented—these' facts alone do not justify us in drawing as the
conclusion that the workers’ interests are not protected. In a
society for the welfare of animals the animals do not elect
the oﬂicials, nor do they participate in the meetings at which
the society’s affairs are discussed. Yet who can harbor doubts
as to the good will of the society’s officials and the efhcacy of
their work for animal welfare? I

Thus, before passing a deﬁnite judgment on the fascist cor-
porative state, one must first inquire into its results as revealed
in the conditions of the working classes. The tree is judged by
its fruits. What are the fruits of the fascist corporative state?

Let me give one instance of how the system works.

In March, 1927, the representatives of the rice cultivator:
and the officials who run the rice weeders’ unions signed a
contract to the effect that wages should be cut by 10 per cent.
Fifteen days before the beginning of the harvest, the employers

40

 

 

« ~,’,_‘'C_"2w5~=4z“':<\m+~

; ,
i

it

 

announced that they could not pay the wages agreed upon.
because after the signing of the contract the price of rice had
sunk 25 per cent. They asked for a further cut of 20 per cent.
The union officials then oﬁered a further reduction of 2.5
per cent. This was judged insufhcient by the employers.
When the question was brought before the Labor Court, it
authorized only the cut of 2.5 per cent to which the ofﬁcials
had kindly consented, and made the workers give back to the
employers what they had already received in excess. Then, after
wages had been cut by 12.5 per cent, the daily papers an-
nounced that the Labor Court had defeated the employers.

In 1928, the government decided that a fresh cut of 7.5
per cent should take place. During 1929 the price of rice
went’ up 20 per cent, and the growers oilered the workers an
increase of 1.5 per cent, which the oﬂicials of the unions
accepted with gratitude. But in 1930 the price fell again and
the oﬂicials generously accepted a further reduction of 17.5
per cent.

In 1931, the employers requested another cut of 35 per cent.
The oﬂicials hastened to offer a cut of 20 per cent. The Labor
Court granted a cut of 24 per cent. In 1933 and 1934 wages
were again reduced. Thus, between 1927 and 1934, the wages
of 200,000 workers, mostly women, were cut by from 55 to
61 per cent,. according to the different groups of the weeders.

Every time a cut took place, the papers praised to the skies
the spirit of "class cooperation” which fascism is fostering
between employers and employees. Prince Metternich was
wont to say that nothing was more advisable than cooperation
between the man and his mount, but one should. be the man
and not the mount. Under fascist class cooperation the em-
ployer is the man and the employee the mount.

VIII. The Standard of Living

The average wages of industrial workers at the end of 1934

were one—half of what they were in 1926, when the cor-
41

 

   
  
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
   
   

porative state was in its initial stage. The wages of agricultural
workers were even less than one-half of what they had been.
Meanwhile, the cost of living did not change until the end
of 1929. From 1930 to 1934 it did fall, but only by 25 per
cent. Thus, -in the course of eight years the Italian people lost
more than 25 per cent of their real wages. If one adds the
losses caused by increased unemployment to the drop in real
wages, one realizes the deterioration which has taken place
in the standard of living of the Italian working class under the
fascist corporative state. i i
In June, 1931, Professor Bizozzero, an agricultural expert
and a one hundred per cent fascist, advised the Italian peas-
antry to eat little bread and hardly any meat and to return to
maize as a staple food, if they wanted to ﬁnd a way out of
their present troubles. “Maize,” as the Cabinet Minister,
Signor Acerbo, explained in September of 1932, “serves to
feed not only human beings, but also cattle and especially
pigs.” The stiff mush made of maize, when it is not varied
with bread and meat and not sufficiently salted, produces a
horrible disease—pellagra. A fascist professor writes: “Among
animals only the herbivorous have need of salt, not the carni-
vorous. For the carnivorous rich salt is a luxury. For the herbi-
vorous proletariat of Italy it is a necessity.” Lest they should
put too much salt in their stiif mush, the price of salt, which
in Italy is a state monopoly, was raised in September, 1928,
from two and a half cents a pound to six cents a pound.
Pellagra was slowly disappearing from Italy during the ﬁfty
years of the pre-fascist regime. In 1930, an authority on
hygiene, who is also a one hundred per cent fascist, Professor
Messedaglia, drew attention to the fact that a case of pellagra
had occured in a zone from which the disease had disappeared,
and raised a cry of alarm at the steady fall in the standard
of living among the rural population of his district. ,
In 1935 a fresh increase in the cost of living of from 15 to

20 per cent occurred, but wages remained unchanged. During

A the spring and summer of 1936 a newincrease in the cost‘

of living became apparent. Last September (1936) , the Amer-
ican commercial attaché in Rome estimated that living costs
had increased from 10 to 15 per cent during the preceding
twelve months.

The distress became so unbearable that the government had

‘ to order an increase in wages which amounted to from 5 to

1/0 per cent, according to the different groups of working

people. These increases have been heralded as a proof that

Mussolini has at heart the welfare of his beloved subjects.
The truth is that these increases did not meet the increase in
the cost of living which had taken place during the first half
of the year.

Conclusion

I hope the reader now understands why Hitler was eager
to introduce Mussolini’s corporative state into Germany, why
the Austrian clerico-fascists aped it in Austria, why the Duke
of Alba and former King Alfonso are enthusiastic about it,
and why the Catholic Bishop of Cleveland admires not only
Father Coughlin’s radio sermons but also Mussolini’s cor-
porative state. This is no doubt also the reason why Mr. Myron
C. Taylor, chairman of the United States Steel Corporation,
speaking in November, 1936, at a dinner of welcome for
Mussolini’s newly appointed ambassador, assured the latter
that all the world is forced to admire Mussolini’s success in
disciplining the nation. By “nation” Mr. Taylor did not mean
big business. Big business does not like to be disciplined. By
"nation” he meant the trade union leaders, writers, workers,
journalists and college professors who’ do not worship big
business. These people need to be "disciplined” in the United
States too.

Mr. Taylor is no more disturbed than the European admir-
ers of Mussolini by the latter’s syndicalist ﬁreworks and the

43

   

"revol'utionary” institutions of his corporatiye state. They ail

know quite well that the fascist corporative state is merely the

 old capitalist state in its most despotic form, marked by the

K ruthless suppression of personal rights and political liberties;
notably the liberty of the trade unions.*

CONCLUSION

I-IE picture of conditions in Germany and Italy as pre-

sented by those who have experienced its terrors, is suf-
ﬁciently challenging to arouse progressive, thinking Americans,
whether organized or unorganized, whether they work with
hand or brain. Here we have a picture of the catastrophe which
would overtake the American people, if a system like Musso-
lini’s fascist corporative state, or Hitler’s coordinated dictator-
ship, were ever permitted a footing in this country. Here we

‘ have precise information concerning the fall in living stand-

ards, the actual starvation, bad housing, low wages, heavy
taxes, burdensome armaments, imperialist ventures in colonial
aggression threatening new foreign wars, the total suppression
of civil liberties and persecution of racial minorities which
result when fascism is permitted to ride the saddle. Fascism
solves no economic crisis. It does mislead well-intentionecl
people into believing that it can do so, when all it actually
does is to increase the burden on the shoulders of the working
population for the beneﬁt of ﬁnanciers and industrialists.
Under the colossal swindle of fascism, the workers’ trade
unions stand to lose their organizations, built up through

. decades of struggle, almost over night. The violent suppression

of all workers’ organizations is a foundation stone of fascism.

In this period, American labor is on the march. We have
seen this in the splendid spirit of resistance manifested during
the sit-down strikes, first in the fortress of anti-unionism (Gen-
eral Motors. in Detroit), then spreading in rapid succession
from one industry to another across the country. It is important
to point out that even under fascist terror, labor is making
itself felt. In Italy, for example, reference has been made to

a recent wage increase. Some anti-fascists see in this a ma-
45

   

neuver on the part of fascist leaders, in order to knife the
workers’ movement in the back. The fascists, of course, would
have us believe that this increase is due to the benevolence of
Mussolini. Actually, however, the wage increase is due to the
workers’ agitation within the ranks of the fascist unions. A
joint statement, issued by the (illegal) Socialist and Commu-
nist Parties of Italy immediately thereafter, claimed this as a
signiﬁcant result of union pressure. Gherardo Casini, a fascist
functionary, has stated in Lavoro Fascista that the problem is
no longer one of “bringing wages up to the level of the cost
of living,” but of “examining the very trade union structure
and activities.”

Even in the terrorized fascist organizations, therefore, the
workers are becoming more outspoken than ever before. They
are raising issues of wages, living conditions and trade union
life, thus using the fascist corporations themselves to break
through fascist suppression and legality, and in fact even
forcing some of the fascist leaders to take up their grievances
and debate them in the press. In this way, the workers in
fascist countries are beginning to use the corporations as
unions, since none other is available to them now. This is
important, for it indicates the possibility of a general revival
of the labor movement in these countries, while at the same
time constituting a serious threat to the whole fabric of fascist
legality—a matter of prime importance.

In Germany there are even more signs of ferment and
change. Here as elsewhere the aim of the Nazi party was to
crush the workers under the lowest living standards ever
known in Germany. To do this, Hitler found it necessary to
try to stamp out any signs of labor struggles for better con-
ditions. But the situation in Germany shows that Hitler’ s plans
have not been entirely realized. In the fascist Labor Front,
there is a broad opposition movement formed by the workers
despite the terror—a struggle to bring back the old independ-

ent fighting force of labor.

Labor must and will defend itself against destruction. The
Hitler regime has reduced Germany to beggary. Inside the
country, however, there is the beginning of a People’s Front
of working people, the middle classes, and peasants, to ﬁght
against the brutality of the fascist dictatorship. In the last
few weeks there have been cases of passive resistance and even
of open strikes in many industries. In the peasant districts,
there are dissatisfaction and ferment expressed in refusal to pay
taxes or yield products to the government. Very recently we
have read of open resistance to the sending of workers’ sons
to ﬁght for fascism in Spain. Especially in the domain of
religion, there is continued opposition which forces Hitler to
capitulate and grant free elections for church self-government.
All these factors taken together indicate that the forces of the
People’s Front are growing and maturing towards a free and
democratic Germany.

We in the United States can learn, and must learn, from
these examples. It is not necessary for us to pass over the
bloody road of fascism. An open fascist party has not yet
crystallized in the United States. We have the power in our
hands to resist, indeed to crush the fascist elements now appar-
ent on the American scene. For those who still doubt that
such forces exist, there is the adventurer Gerald L. K. Smith,
successor to the mantle of Huey Long’s Louisiana dictatorship.
The press of March 2 announced that Smith had just started
a venture to form "A Committee of One Million,” with him-
self in the capacity of “Fuehrer,” because "his friends wanted
him to form it.” On January 27, Chairman Dickstein of the
Immigration Committee told the House that "German spies
and Consuls and representatives in this country” were train-
ing 200,000 men in German uniforms chieﬂy in Illinois, Penn-
sylvania, New York and Michigan. Black Legionism in De-
troit shocked the American public. It has by no means been
wiped out. Its sinister possibilities, whether in the shape of a

anti-Semitic activities of Henry Ford, or the paid agents of
Hitler in America, are menacing forces, ready allies of the
Liberty Leaguers who proved themselves such conspicuous
enemies of democracy in the last elections. It will be recalled
that these forces were held in leash by an aroused people, who
preferred to take no chances with fascism here. The people
are again on the move to reform the Supreme Court against
the unrestricted power to thwart progressive legislation.

France has demonstrated through its Popular -Front how to
deal with the fascist menace. The Spanish People’s Front has
shown the world how magniﬁcent and invincible is the ﬁghting
spirit of the people in defense of democracy, against the forces
of international fascism and its mercenary armies!

The need of the hour in America is to build this bulwark
in opposition to fascism, through the instrument of the
Farmer-Labor Party, uniting all those who are opposed to
fascism, cementing all those who are for democracy and peace.

For the People’s Front against fascism and war which it breeds,
no single group is more important than the trade unions. Their‘

strength will be second to none in the People’s Front in this
country, organized‘ to ﬁght reaction and safeguard democracy.
The wave of sit-down strikes under the leadership of the Com-
mittee for Industrial Organization (C.I.O.) is an indication
of the ﬁghting capacity of the American labor movement, and
of its determination to organize effective, powerful instruments
to win some measure of economic security now. With one-third
of this great nation still "ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed,” it is
imperative that forward looking people join hands with labor
now in organizing the Farmer-Labor Party to combat all fas-
cist inﬂuences threatening our hard-won democratic rights.
To help vanquish fascism, we dedicate this pamphlet, in the
belief that those who read -will act to forge the People’:
Front against fascism and war. ‘

WHAT THE CIVIL \‘VAR MAY MEAN
TO SPANISH TRADE UNIONS

Foreword by
ISABEL DE PALENCIA

HE General Union of Workers in Spain——the U.G.T.,

as it is commonly called—is probably one of the best
organized and most disciplined and, politically, one of the most
alert organizations in the world. It came into existence over
fifty years ago under the leadership of Pablo Iglesias, founder
of the Spanish Socialist Party. The first union was that of the
printers, which now comprises all the press workers, from the
humblest newspaper vendor to the best known editors.

The U.G.T. has, as its political organ, the Socialist Party,
which has at all times given a high example of leadership.

When the military rebellion broke out, the U.G.T. had
over 1,000,000 members. The agricultural workers alone num-
bered 400,000. It must be borne in mind that all the labor
legislation which had been achieved in Spain was due to the
efforts of the U.G.T. At the moment of the rebellion, the
Builders’ Union had obtained the forty~hour week, and this
beneﬁt was about to be extended to other unions.

Naturally the progress in labor legislation, although con-
siderable, left much to be desired. The wages of Spanish work-
ers in all trades are decidedly lower than those prevailing in
many other countries. Yet even these low wages had provoked
great opposition among the employers. Were anyone to doubt
this, he need only look over the decrees issued by the Depart-
ment of Labor during the two and a half years when the
Department and the fate of the Spanish workers were alike in
the hands of avmember of Lerroux’s party, and afterwards of

 
  

Senor Salmon (the alter ego of Gil Robles, leader of the
Jesuit Fascist Party and ardent supporter of Franco). Wages
came down witha rush to pre-republican standards. Protective
laws for women and children were reduced or ignored. The
mixed Boards of Trade that had helped to solve so many con-
ﬂicts were done away with and replaced by courts under the
chairmanship of magistrates-

It was useless to present claims, for workers got no proper
hearing. Finally the strike of October, 1934, gave an excellent
excuse for the dismissal of thousands of men and women from
their jobs, particularly those who formed part of the executive
committees of their respective unions.

The misery in the agricultural zones became so great as a
result—since all members of the unions were refused work—
that in 1935 people in some villages were reduced to eating
grass alone for very hunger.

These recent occurrences give us "an excellent indication of.

the fate that would overtake all workers’ organizations were
Franco to win. His attitude toward the unions has already
been made evident by the fact that in all those towns and
villages where his forces hold control not only are members of
the executive committees of the unions shot down, but also all
workers carrying a mere membership card in a union.

In the ﬁrst manifestoes issued by him, where he speaks of
the necessity of establishing a military dictatorship in Spain
as the only means of ensuring order, Franco also speaks of
dissolving Parliament and all workers’ organizations. .

Lately, because of the country’s resistance to his dictatorial
attempts, he has published another manifesto in which he ads
dresses the Spanish workers and calls upon them to separate
from what he calls their traitorous leaders and to join him.
Were not the moment so tragic, Spanish humor would ﬁnd
occasion for the exercise of irony in commenting on this appeal.

There is not a worker in all Spain who does not know that

the triumph of Franco would be the end of all social advances, J

the protective laws, the liberty of association, and even the
personal freedom of every Spaniard. The Spanish capitalists
and employers have the feudal doctrines and beliefs too deeply
ingrained in their systems not to take advantage of such a
victory to reduce the working class to absolute slavery.

Fortunately such will not be the case. Rather face extermin-
ation than a fascist dictatorship! One must remember that
Franco is not a man of intelligence or vision. He has never
been interested in any problem affecting the vital interests of
the country; and the men who are giving him their support,
notably Gil Robles, instead of taking the labor problems into
consideration, have done nothing but increase the tension be-
tween workers and employers and irritate the masses with their
unjust measures.

It must be remembered that, except in the Basque Provinces,
where the Catholic Party has understood how to plan and
carry out social reforms, the Catholics have nowhere managed
to form a labor party or even a workers’ organization. The
small group they claimed to have formed is non-existent.

These reasons alone are enough to make all Spaniards sacri-
fice everything rather than allow Franco to win. Remember the
slogan: "Rather die standing up than spend the rest of our
lives on our knees!”
