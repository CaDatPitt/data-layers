factured at the North; directly or indirectly. (Laughter.)
From him who ﬁrst taught you your alphabet, to the pro-

 

fessor who gave the ﬁnish to your education, and taught

you to make black appear white, they were all Northern
men. Nevertheless, I don ’t want to see the Union dissolved;
for as long as we are united, we have an inﬂuence over you;
indeed, you stand so greatly in need of us that I should be
very sorry to leave you.’ (Laughter.) '
Mrs. R. here made an appeal“ in behalf of the principle
of refusing to consume slave products, believing it would
have a great tendency to abolish Slavery. Not being able to
ﬁnd a market for their products, the slaveholders would
have either to go to work to feed their slaves or free them.
And as for Working, there was an entire inability on the
part of the slaveholder. He was a poor, miserable, inactive,
lazy, unfortunate creature, and with all heart and soul she
pitied him. (Laughter.) When I ﬁrst stepped on slave soil,
said she, I read the curse of Slavery upon it. A gentleman
once asked me at the South, what I thought, on the whole,
of South Carolina. I told him: ‘I am sorry to say that you
are a century, at least, behind in the means of civilization.’
(Laughter.) He wanted to know why I thought so. I said:
‘The only civilization you have exists among your slaves;
for if industry and the mechanical arts are the great cri-
terion of civilization, (and I believe they are,) then cer-
tainly the slaves are the‘only civilized ones among you, be-
cause they do all the work.’ (Laughter.) (In Charleston
and Columbia, S. C., the slaves are painters, glaziers, car-
penters and masons; in fact, all the trades are ﬁlled with
slaves. The owners cannot do any kind of manual labor,
because it is disgraceful, so that everything is done by
slaves.) He told me I had to thank my stars for being a
woman. (Laughter.) I said I always thanked my stars for
being a woman (renewed laughter), but I wanted to know

rect discourse for the next few sentences is unclear; Mrs. Rose spoke, of course,

wherein I had to thank my stars in that particular instance.
Said he, ‘Our State has made provision for many cases,
but not for all. For instance—when we catch a good Aboli-
tionist, we give him a coat of tar and feathers.’ (Laughter.)
I then told him that, as for me, I was an Abolitionist in the
fullest sense of the word, (applause,) and be I a woman or
not, said I, you are so exceedingly lazy and inactive here
that it would be an act of charity to give you something to
do, were it even to give me a coat of tar and feathers.
(Great laughter and applause.) To say that he was enraged
would express no idea whatever. (Laughter.) Then I said
to him, ‘My dear sir, you have to thank yourself for this
altercation; I did not begin it; I knew your weak spot, and
did not wish to touch it. (L-aughter.) You thought that I
would be a coward and recreant to my sentiments. I tell
you, sir, that if I had never been an Abolitionist before, I
would have become one here, and you would have helped to
make me one.’ (Applause.) Let a Northern man or woman
go to the South, and the moment they touch the slave soil,
they are looked upon as if they had come prepared to steal
negroes [sic], and they never will let you alone, no matter
how silent you may be; they will commence to draw you out
and discover what your principles are. And it is a shame to

 

acknowledge it, they ﬁnd too many cowards from the North,:

who are recreant to their own principles; and having suc-
ceeded so many times with persons of this character, they
think they can always succeed.—They think that, for the
sake of getting into society and being patronised by the
higher classes, you will say, ‘O yes, your institutions are
the best that can possibly be for your portion of the
Union. *1”

It has always appeared to me to be the greatest error
and absurdity to suppose that the South is ever going to
forsake the North. Where are they to go? It was a sheer

12 “The keen and brave encounters of Mrs. Rose with the Carolinians were
capital,” wrote L. appreciatively in commenting on the published reports
(National Anti-Slavery Standard, XIV, No. 13, August 20, 1853, p. 50, col. 4).

political trick, raised, for the purpose of making political
capital, when our politicians in 1850 raised the cry--which
(looking at the reporters present) of course the newspapers
had to echo (laughter)—that the Union was in danger.“
There was not a man of sound sense in the South, I venture
to say—and there are many such-—that believed it for a
moment. It was got up by political gamblers of both sec-
tions, for the purpose of making capital. If you could only
estimate the immense injury that Slavery does, not only to
the South, but to the North—in fact, the whole World—-you
would say, ‘Leave us, if you will; we will willingly give you
a passport, if you will rid us of this incumbrance.’

Our friend Garrison has repeated to us the many bless- ‘

ings resulting from upright actions. Yes, every act brings
its own reward or its own punishment. Every good act
produces its own corresponding reward, and every bad act
its corresponding punishment. How, then, must not only
the South but the North be punished in consequence of that
great, immeasurable wrong of Slavery‘? Oh, the shame and
outrage that, for one single moment, that great blot should
be suffered to remain on the otherwise beautiful escutcheon
of this republic!

But permit me to say that the slaves of the South are

not the only people that are in bondage. All women are'ex-
cluded from the enjoyment of that liberty which your Dec-

laration of Independence asserts to be the inalienable right

of all. The same right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, that pertains to man, pertains to woman also.
For what is life without liberty‘? Which of you here before
me would not willingly risk his or her life, if in danger of
being made a slave‘? Emancipation from every kind of bond-

13 The threats of secession came in the Senate debates around the Wilmot
Proviso abolishing slavery in the territories acquired from Mexico, and led to
the Nashville Convention, inspired by John C. Calhoun, which rejected the
“compromise of 1850” and called for secession. The slaveholders’ offensive
not only defeated the Wilmot Proviso but passed a strengthened Fugitive Slave
Law.

age is my principle. I go for the recognition of human
rights, Without distinction of sect, party, sex, or color.“
(Applause) *

14 This formulation by Mrs. Rose harks back to the time in England in
1835 when she was a prominent ﬁgure in The Association of all Classes of all
Nations, founded by Robert Owen, the object of which was to eﬁect “an entire
change in the character and condition of mankind, by establishing over the
world,  principle and practice, the religion of charity for the opinions, feel-
ings, and conduct of all individuals, without distinction of sex, class, sect,
party, country, or colour, combined with 9. well-devised, equitable, and natural
system of united property. . . .” (Manual of the Association of all Classes of
all N ations, No. 2, London, 1836, p. 30.) This organization marked Owen ’s
divergence away from the trade union movement (G. D. H. Cole, Robert Owen,
London, 1925, pp. 220-221).

ERNESTINE L. ROSE: HER ADDRESS ON THE
ANNIVERSARY OF WEST INDIAN EMANCIPATION

This address is reprinted for the ﬁrst time since it was
published in the periodicals of 1853.1 The speech is full of
wit, sarcasm, irony, farce, good sense, and the passion for
human freedom, and evoked from those who heard it the
ﬂattering interruptions not only of applause but of laughter.

The occasion for its delivery was important in two
senses. The anniversary of British West Indian Emancipa-
tion, which actually began on August 1, 1834, when 30,000
slaves were freed in Antigua, had for many years been cele-
brated in many places, but for a long time New York city
had known no such celebration. The old New York City
Anti—Slavery Society, founded in 1833, had become inactive
in 1840. The dominant merchant class in New York, which
had once opposed the extension of slavery, had in 1850 been
intimidated by Southern threats of secession into collaborat-
ing with slavery-extension programs and into supporting
the Fugitive Slave Act. In that year, anti-slavery assem-
blies had been mobbed in New York by Captain Isaiah
Rynders’ Tammany toughs, and Ernestine L. Rose, Fred-
erick Douglass, and William Lloyd Garrison had been
among those who had faced the pro-slavery hoodlums. The
base for political copperheadism was being laid in those
years. The anti-slavery movement seemed to be retreating.
Yet in 1853 a new anti-slavery society was organized in
New York, and its ﬁrst major public appearance was on this
West India Emancipation Day.”

and quotations appeared in the N ew-Y ork Daily Tribune, August 5, 1853, p. 4,

Despite heavy rains on Wednesday, August 3, and
clouds on Thursday morning, the day of the anti-slavery
excursion, picnic, and meeting, a couple of hundred Negro
and white men and women boarded the Island City at 9
A.M. at Fulton Street and were at the grove in Flushing
called St. Roman’s Well by 10:30 A.M. When the speeches
began after lunch at 1 P.M., the audience had grown to ﬁve
or six hundred. Showers compelled the purposive and good-
natured audience to seek the cover of a barn that had been
prepared for the contingency, and the speeches were there-
fore heard indoors. In his invocation, the Negro minister,
Rev. Mr. Campbell, prayed for abolition in the United
States, and then there were songs by a Negro choir in which
the audience joined. The main address was made by Wil-
liam Lloyd Garrison, who was followed by Ernestine L.
Rose, and several others, last but not least among them
two Negroes, V. W. Wilkins and Thomas Van Renssalaer,
the latter having been responsible for organizing the ﬁrst
New York meeting to salute West Indian Emancipation in
1834. The proceedings lasted until about 5:30 P.M., with

the audience continually interested and contributing to a_

collection of funds to be used for the free distribution of an
abolitionist pamphlet. Everybody seemed to be pleased
except the reporter for the pro-slavery New York Herald,
who ended his two—column account prominently displayed
on the front page with this to him happy reﬂection: “The
whole affair was acknowledged to be a contemptible failure,
and all the proceedings were very stupid indeed.” It seems
that the Herald, which inhaled with pleasure and proﬁt the
stench of slavery, professed delicately to be repelled by the
smell of Negroes.3

When Lauren Wetmore, president of the New York City
Anti—Slavery Society, introduced Mrs. Rose, he remarked,

Oliver Johnson from the Pennsylvania Freeman to the National Anti-Slavery
Standard in New York.

“I have now the pleasure to announce to you a speaker
from that portion of mankind who are not always repre-
sented on occasions like this, by their own orators.” The
Tribune noted that she was Jewish. The Herald called her a
“Polish female advocate of Woman’s rights,” sneered at
her good looks, and mocked her foreign accent. The Times
chose to be faintly mysterious, reporting that Mrs. Rose
“came forward amid much applause. The public anteced-
ents of thetalented speaker will sufﬁciently indicate the
tenor of her remarks, during the delivery of which she was
frequently interrupted by bursts of warm applause.” Mrs.
Rose was already widely known as a Utopian Socialist,
atheist, Woman’s rights leader, and abolitionist.‘ This
daughter of a Polish rabbi had left home at 17 in 1827, came
to England’ several years later, and became a follower of
Robert Owen, the Utopian Socialist. With her husband,
William E. Rose, also an Owenite and atheist, she had come
to the United States in 1836, and had quickly become active
and famous as a leader in the struggle for Woman’s rights,
and as an atheist. By 1850, when the ﬁrst national Woman’s
rights convention was held in Worcester, Mass., she served
on the Resolutions (then called Business) Committee to-
gether with Frederick Douglass and Garrison. The speciﬁc
public antecedent to which the Times referred was perhaps
the fact that on June 12, 1853, she had been an outstanding
ﬁgure at the Hartford “Bible” Convention .of free-thinkers,
and had been all but prevented from speaking by a horde of
theological students and others who had come speciﬁcally to

 

disrupt the meeting, and had succeeded. Even Garrison had I

not gotten the rough treatment that was accorded to Mrs.
Rose by the pious gentlemen.‘
But now let this anti-slavery address speak for itself.

ERNESTINE L. RosE’s ADDRESS ON THE ANNIVERSARY or WEST
INDIAN EMANOIPATION AT FLUSHING, LONG ISLAND, N. Y.,
AUGUST 4, 1853.

FRIENDS——I can hardly leave this place without rais-

 

ing my voice in unison with those who have spoken here. _

Indeed, the exercises of this celebration would not appear
to me complete, Without having Woman raise her voice in
this great and noble cause (applause); for when has any
good cause been effected Without her co-operation? We have
been told, to-day, that it was a woman that agitated Great
Britain to its very centre, before emancipation could be ef-
fected in her colonies.“ Woman must go hand in hand with
man in every great and noble cause, if success would be
insured.

I love to attend such anniversaries; I think the effect is
very beneﬁcial. Many such are celebrated in this country.
New England celebrates the anniversary of the landing of
the Pilgrim Fathers," and Well she may; for when those
Pilgrim Fathers left their native shores, it Was to obtain
that civil and religious freedom which was denied them in
the mother country; and in so far as the same freedom is de-
sirable for all, it is perfectly right and proper that their
descendants should keep the anniversaries of the landing of
their ancestors.‘ Thousands attend these anniversaries, I
doubt not, with joyful hearts and grateful memories; and

5 In his address, Garrison had mentioned Mrs. Elizabeth Coltman Heyrick
(1769-1831), who in 1824 had published in Manchester and London a pamphlet
entitled: “Immediate, not gradual abolition; or, An inquiry into the shortest,
safest, and most eyfectual means of getting rid of West Indian Slavery.” In it,
Mrs. Heyrick had argued that stopping the slave-trade was not enough, and
advocated a British popular boycott of West Indian sugar as one means of
achieving emancipation.

7 The newspapers were then full of lengthy accounts of the Pilgrim Day
celebration at Plymouth, Mass., which was unusually impressive and we11-at-
tended because the date of the aﬂair had just been altered from December 22,
when the Pilgrims debarked at Plymouth, to August 1, when they embarked at
Delft Haven, Holland. Winter celebrations having proved unpopular, the date
was changed to the summer.

though I am not myself an American by birth, and have
never had the pleasure of attending such an anniversary,
yet my heart is always with those who do, for they hail a
day of freedom. But there are other anniversaries kept in
this country, one of which I presume you all love to cele-
brate; and that is the anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence. That great and glorious day did not create,
but gave to the world a great truth—- that all men are born
free and equal, and are therefore entitled to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. My heart always rejoices in
that day, and I shall never forget the emotions I felt when
I ﬁrst witnessed its celebration in this country. It seemed
to me as if the sun shone brighter, the birds sang sweeter,
the grass grew greener. Everything in nature seemed trans-
formed from deformity to beauty. Ah, were only that great,
noble truth of the Declaration of Independence carried out,
as it ought to be, there would be no need of our meeting here
to—day. (Applause.) Then indeed might we all rejoice
when the Fourth of July arrives. But whether it is carried
out or not, the truth remains the same. Alas! that it should
come up in judgment before this great nation! But though
I rejoice when that great day comes round, I cannot help
contrasting, as I sit here to-day, the event which that com-
memorates with the one which we are met to—day to com-
memorate. All my feelings and principles are republican; I
may say I am-a republican by nature; but in comparison to
the liberation of 800,000 slaves,“ the Declaration of Inde-
pendence falls into utter insigniﬁcance. (Applause.) It falls

3 The ﬁgure of 800,000 slaves was correct for the year 1807, but the aboli-
tion of the British slave trade led to such overworking of West Indian slaves
that the number had been reduced by 1830 to 700,000 (John Kells Ingram,
“Slavery,” Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th ed., 1930, XX, 782). A. L. Morton
notes that although West Indian planters received £20,000,000 in compensation
for emancipatiug their slaves, “the production of sugar declined considerably.
By a curious irony, the abolition of slavery here stimulated the African slave
trade, because the production of sugar in Cuba and Brazil, where slavery still
continued, developed rapidly and created a new demand for labour. . . .” (A
People’s History of England, London, 1938, p. 467.)

 

 

 

ERNESTINE L. ROSE 349

short, just as theory falls short of practice. (Applause.)

 

There is almost an immeasurable distance between the two.»

The one was the utterance of a great truth, that will last
forever; the other was a practical application of it. How
different the results! the Declaration of Independence—has
it yet. abolished Slavery? But the great act of emancipa-
tion of 800,000 human beings has shown to the world that
the African race are not only capable of taking care of
themselves, but are capable of enjoying peacefully as much
liberty and as much freedom as the white men. Thus it has
done far more towards the cause of freedom-—towards
emancipation from all kinds of slavery—than the Declara-
tion of Independence did. (Applause.) For in spite of that
Declaration——in sadness and sorrow do I say it—the United
States of America are guilty of outrage and recreancy to
their own principles in retaining slavery; while Great Brit-
ain, without that Declaration, having yet a great deal of
oppression and tyranny in her midst, has shown a noble
example to the world in emancipating all her chattel slaves.”

It is utterly impossible for us, as ﬁnite beings, with the
utmost stretch of the imagination, to conceive the depth and
immensity of the horrors of slavery. I would that, instead
of speaking and listening to—day, we could all sit down in
perfect silence, and each and every one of us ask ourselves
what is it to be. a slave ‘.3—-what is it to emancipate eight
hundred thousand slaves? We have the evil among us; we
see it daily and hourly before us; we have become accus-
tomed to it; we talk about it; but do we comprehend it—do

9W. E. Burghardt DuBois presents a more scientiﬁc view of the cause of
British abolition: “When the American colonies won their independence, the
Caribbean ceased to be a British sea and investment began to be transferred
from the West to the East Indies. . . . Eventually Negro slavery and the slave
trade were abandoned in favor of colonial imperialism, and the England which
in the eighteenth century established modern slavery in America on a vast
scale, appeared in the nineteenth century as the official emancipator of slaves
and founder of a method of control of human labor and material which proved
more proﬁtable than slavery.” (The World and Africa, New York, 1947, pp.
63-64.) One of the enterprises British capital turned to was the opium trade.

 

 

350 JOURNAL or NEGRO HISTORY

We realize it—do We feel it? What is is to be a slave‘? Not
to be your own, bodily, mentally, or morally—that is to be
a slave. Ay, even if slaveholders treated their slaves with
the utmost kindness and charity; if I were told they kept
them sitting on a sofa all day, and fed them with the best of

the land, it is none the less slavery—(applause); for What

does slavery mean? To work hard, to fare ill, to suffer
hardship, that is not slavery; for many of us white men
and Women have to Work hard, have to fare ill, have to
suffer hardship, and yet We are not slaves. Slavery is, not
to belong to yourself—to be robbed of yourself. There is
nothing that I so much abhor as that single thing—to be
robbed of one’s self. We are our own legitimate masters.
Nature has not created masters and slaves; nature has
created man free as the air of heaven. The black man and
the white man are equally the children of nature. The same
mother earth has created us all; the same life pervades all;
the same spirit ought to animate all. Slavery deprives us
of ourselves. The slave has no power to say, ‘I Will go here,
or I will go yonder.’ The slave cannot say, ‘My Wife, my
husband, or my child.’ He does not belong to himself, and
of course cannot claim anything whatever as his own. This
is the great abomination of slavery, that it deprives a man
of the common rights of humanity, stamped upon him by
his Maker.

Not being a native of this country, I have probably had
some different ideas with regard to the Workings of slavery
from What many abolitionists have. I do not belong to any
abolition Society, as my friend by my side said he was
compelled to belong to the Garrisonian Society1°—(laugh-
ter) ; but With my Whole heart, mind and soul, I bless him
for having been the great and noble voice of humanity to
this country for emancipation. (Applause.) I go for eman-
cipation of all kinds-—White and black, man and woman.

1° Garrison had said to the audience, “You are all thorough-going Aboli-
tionists—all uncompromising Abolitionists. I will not ask you to be Garrisonian
Abolitionists [Disunionists] ; for myself I cannot help being one of that kind.”

Humanity’s children are, in my estimation, all one and the

same family, inheriting the same earth; therefore there
should be no slaves of any kind among them. There are ties
that bind man to man far stronger than the ties of nation—
than the political and commercial ties——ay, even stronger
than the ties of relationship; and these are the ties of hu-
manity. Humanity, the great mother of all, has thrown
around us ties, sympathies and feelings which are more
endearing, more effectual, and more noble, than any other
that have ever bound man to man.

Our friend who has addressed you to-day has mentioned
the fact that the opposers of emancipation are fearful that
the South will not trade with the North. No greater folly
was ever conceived. The South forsake the North! What
will they do‘? Six years ago, I was in Columbia, S. C. A
senator, returning from Washington, made a speech there,
in which he talked a great deal about Abolitionists and
Disunionists of the North. A young lawyer, who boarded
at the same hotel where I stopped, came home full of these
ideas, and commenced a conversation with me on the sub-
ject of slavery; and he was so full, that he could scarcely
ﬁnd time to express his indignation. ‘We don’t want the
North,’ said he——‘we are independent of the North, and
We can afford to dissolve the Union to-day.’ I let him go on
for some time, for I knew he would run himself out. (Laugh-
ter.) After he had done so, I told him I did not wish to
have the Union dissolved; I would like to stick to you, be-
cause you need us. (Laughter.) I then asked him, ‘Wherein
could you be independent of the North? Who are your
teachers and professors? Northern men. Who weaves your
cloth and bedecks you‘? Northern laborers. Who grows
much of the food that nourishes you‘? Northern men. (In-
deed, so greatly impoverished is the land in the South that
it is a positive fact, that I once saw a cow held up while she
was fed.) (Great laughter.) ‘Just remember, my dear Sir,’
said I, ‘that from your head to your feet, you were manu-
