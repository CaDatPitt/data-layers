June 20 Vote Setto Authorize Strike
section AgainstNonferrous Companies

Negotiations’ Slow Pace
Prompts Call for Vote

DENVER, Colo.-—A broad strike authorization vote I.
among 70 local unions in the nonferrous industry whose

contracts expire on or before August 31 was approved by
the 28-member Nonferrous Industry Conference Continu-
ations Committee here on June 5. The balloting will be

conducted on June 20.

A resolution, which was passed unanimously by the
committee, noted that no company has yet “made a seri-
ous proposal for a new contract” and stated that “under
these circumstances, the need for strike authorization is

evident and compelling.-”

Participating in the vote will be

locals of ‘both the

United Steelworkers and Mine"-Mill representing many

properties of the copper indus-.
try’s Big Four—Kennecott Cop-
per, the American Smelting and
Refining Company, Phelps
Dodge Corp., and the Anaconda
Company—as well as others
holding bargaining rights with.
many other major nonferrous
companies.

Progress ‘Modest at Best‘
Approval for the strike au-
thorization yote came after re-
ports were ‘heard from the co-
chairmen of the unions’ bargain-
ing committees which have
either begun or attempted to get
into negotiations with the vari-
ous companies. USWA Vice-
President Joseph P. Melony,-
who together with Mine-Mill
President A. C. Skinner‘co-
chairs the Nonferrous Industry
Conference, noted that the re-
ports indicated that bargaining
progress to date , must be de-
scribed as “modest at-the very
best.” . . ., _
, A resume of the progress
made to date in negotiations

with the various companies, as
reported by the bargaining com-
mittee co-chairmen, follows:

Anaconda

Progress can be summed" up
in one word—none. No meetings
have thus far been held. Initial
requests by the union to sched-
ule negotiations were refused by
Anaconda, who said it was im-
possible to meet until late in
May, after a scheduled stock-
holders meeting ‘had concluded.
Since then, the llcbmpany-' e-
fused to meet on local issues,
insisting that these be settled in
conjunction with overall bar-
gaining.

In the meantime, a conference
of the unions holding bargain-
ing rights with Anaconda was
held in Denver, Colo. on May
22. Twelve international unions
were represented by 82 local

union and staff delegates. Adop- - ‘

DeathToI| in Butte
Continues to   Rise

BU'I"I‘E, Mont —\The grim promise that .1967 is
building up. to be one of the bloodiest years in recent his-
tory at the Butte operations of the Anaconda Company

was bolstered‘ last month when Norman Enberg, age 51, g
and Glen L. Hendricks, 23, were killed while at work in 

the Mountain Con mine.

The two deaths are the sixth and seventh fatalities    I

at the company’s properties here in 1967-—a figure that
already equals the death toll for the entire yeariof 1966.

A continuation of the pace could
well produce the worst record
in the history of the Butte mines
at least" as far back as 1930.

Premature Explosion
The two men, members of
Mine-Mill Local 1, were killed in
a so-far unexplained premature

‘ blast at the mine on May 16.

‘Their partner, William Diei_jin-

-ger, had just left the area to

The U. S. Bureau_of Mines in-
vestigated the accident, but as
this issue of the'Mine-Mill Union
goes to press its report has not
yet been issued. I

Téamsterswin Nationals  
Pact Worth

. WASHINGTON, D. C.—The International Brotherhood of Team-
sters won its largest trucking contract ever, when accord was

reached recently on a new "three-year National Master Freight
Agreement. Ratified late last month by a mail referendum vote of

the 500,000 workers covered, the

‘cents anhour in increases, including 55 cents in wages and an
increase of better than $8 per worker per month in company con--

tributions to the pension fund.

Retroactive to April 1, the contract provides for a 25—cent gen-
eral wage boost this year, including an 11-cent cost-of-living raise,
_with further pay hikes of 15

cents each slated for next year
and 1969. First year increases
alone amount to an immediate
minimum weekly raise of $10
for hourly rated workers. Rates
for over-the-road drivers were
boosted by %-cent per mile this
year, with subsequent 1/i-cent‘
increases due in each of the fol-_
lowing two years.

‘ The pay scale under the old
contract, which expired on
March 31, ranged from $3.32 to
$5.00 per hour,

Wage Protection

Ensuring protection of the
gains, is a cost-of-living esca-

- lator clause, which could pro-

vide further wage hikes of up
to five“ cents each year. Based
on increases in the BLS Con-
sumer Price Index, these ad-
justments would be applied next
April and each year thereafteirt
covering both wages and em-
ployer contributions to pension

4 and health and welfare funds.

Pension contributions by em-
ployers will be upped in April,
1968 by $1 per worker each
week, with another $1.00 per
week increase in 1969. This will
bring weekly employer contri-
butions to $10 for each worker,

igﬁrhitratorﬂules Apex Must Pay
-Discharged Worker for Vacation

CHICAGO, ILL.—An Arbitration decision won recently by
Mine-Mill Local 758 grants three weeks’ vacation pay to Timothy A.
Edelin, a former employee of the Apex Smelting Company here,
who was discharged for cause on Dec. 27, 1966. The discharge
itself was not‘ contested and was not an issue in the case, in which
arbitrator Norman Brown ruled that the company had violated the’
contract by refusing payment of accrued vacation time. V

Apex maintained that Edelin already had taken three weeks’
vacation in 1966 and that he was not eligible for further benefits
since he was not on the payroll
on Jan. 1, 1967, which began the
next vacation period.

No Cutoff Date

Pointing out that the contract
agreement contains no provision
establishing an eligibility cutoff
date for vacation pay, the union
argued that such -pay is a .de-
ferred wage payment, earned
and accrued by the worker.
Denial of this payment consti-
tues. a forfeiture not justified by
the terms of the contract, Local
758 declared.

In ruling forthe union, Brown
noted that Edelin’s 1968 vacation
was granted for his having '
worked a specified number of
days in 1965. In 1966, he- again

Brown found invalid the alle-
- gation by Apex, based on six
previous cases in which no pay-
ments were made, that a “past
practice” involving the for-
feiture of vacation pay upon
discharge had been established.
The arbitrator ruled that, since
the workers involved in those
cases did not file grievances
and because the union had no
knowledge of them, -a “fixed
practice accepted by both par-
ties” had not been set.
Appearing for the union at a

the continuing ﬂow of nonferrous news to Mine-Mill members.

All members, who already should have been receiving
Steel Labor for several months, will get that publication of
the United Steelworkers on a monthly basis. In addition,
beginning in July, the USWA Nonferrous Report also will
start 3-“fdvming out each month, to be issued to the leadership
of every nonferrous local. The Report previously has been a
quarterly newsletter, issued four times a year.

During the period of 1967 nonferrous negotiations, too, a
Nonferrous Bargaining Bulletin will be issued on a frequent
basis to members of Mine-Mill and the Steelworkers who are
involved in this important round of bargaining talks. To keep
all union members as up-to-date as possible on developments
in negotiations, blowups of these bulletins will be sent to all
nonferrous locals for posting on bulletin boards at the union
halls and in the plants.

The financial secretary of each Mine-Mill local union soon
will receive instructions for keeping up to date the mailing
lists‘ for USWA publications, which are printed by Cornelius
Printing, 2457 E. Washington St., Indianapolis, Indiana 46201.

rent AS&R agreements expire

on June 30. Unlike their —ex-.

perience with several of the

other._ major chains, ‘however, .

Mine-Mill and the United Steel-
workers have found it impossi-
ble to get into any kind of real
bargaining to date with the
AS&R Company.

Because of the company’s
bargaining inactivity and its
very busy attempts to split the
AS&R workers, these workers
were the leaders in demanding
strike authorization from the
unions’ Nonferrous Conference
Continuations Committee-
granted by the committee at a
June 5 meeting in Denver.

Special Meetings

Well-attended special member-
ship meetings throughout the
chain late last month, at which
the company’s maneuvers in
trying to split the unity of
AS&R workers were exposed,
had passed resolutions calling
for an immediate national AS&R
strike authorization vote.

As this issue of the l\Iil.;-Hill
Union goes to press, only one
brief one-and—a-half-hour session
—on May 15——had been held with
company representatives, and no
further meetings are presently
scheduled.

The breakdown of talks was
due.to the company’s refusal to
meet with the duly-authorized
union bargaining committee. Ad-
ditionally, AS&R, still stalling
on the discussion of local-issues,
has placed an insulting eco-
nomic offer on the table on a
plant-by-plant basis and already
has issued its first “Dear John”
letter to AS&R workers—also' ob-

,viously futile attempts to divide

them.

The abrupt May 15 halt in

AS&R negotiations marked the
first major clash in 1967 ~non-

To House Mme-Mull Archives

Construction is now underway at the Norlin Library of the University of Colorado
in Boulder, Colo. of a special enclosure in which to house and maintain a collection of
historical material, to be known as the “Archives of the Western Federation of Miners
and the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.”

From the earliest days of the Miners’ Protective Association in Virginia City, Ne-
vada in 1863 through Mine—Mill.’s merger with the United Steelworkers at the end of

this month, the union and its
members have played signifi-
cant roles in making history
. . . of the labor movement, of
the West, of the whole broad
spectrum of American history.

To preserve, for future use
by scholars, the vast bulk of
historically important b 0 0 k 5,
documents, p a m p h 1 e t s, and
other materials now in_ the
possession of Mine-Mill, the
union’s international executive
board agreed to turn over the
archives to the university, where
a century-long record of indus-
trial unionism can be gathered
and properly cared for in a cen-
tral place. A

Subject to the final approval
of the university regents, the
transfer of materials from the
Mine-Mill international office in
Denver is expected to be started
next month. Current records and
materials needed for continuing
functions when the unionizzmerges
with the United Steelworkers on
of course, will be
moved to the USWA interna-
tional headquarters in Pitts-
burgh.

Locals' Help Asked

In addition to providing ma-
terial from the Mine-Mill inter-
national headquarters-, the union
has agreed to seek help from its

local unions in obtaining for the
central library depository his-
torical documents now located in
the field. Already much material
has been shipped to the univer-
sity from Mine-Mill locals in
Montana and Idaho. This in-
cluded:

0 From Local 16 in Great Falls,
Mont., a continuous set of
_'local union minute books dat-
ing back beyond the Decem-
ber, 1897 date of charter-a
record of continuous active
unionism going back to Sept.
21, 1892. Volumes of the Min-
ers’ Magazine for several
years, including one (1902)
which was completely missing
from the international union’s
collection. A copy of the 1930
convention proceedings, also

Mine-Mill Fund
lo Commemorale
Slide Victims

TORONTO, Ont. — Canadian

Mine-Mill officers announced re- ,
cently that a fund is being set‘

up as a memorial to the 116
children and 28 adults killed in
Aberfan, Wales last Oct. 21,
when a massive avalanche of
coal slag buried part of the min-
ing village, including a school in
session.

The fund was instituted by the
union after communicating with
David “Dai” Francis, general
secretary of the Welsh Mine-
workers Union. It will be used
to award a yearly prize or
prizes for the Children's Choir
competition at the Miners’
Eisteddfod, an annual music
festival at Porthcawl which is

sponsored by the miners’ un- A

1011 .

The avalanche emerged as an
even more tragic occurrence
during a nine-week hearing in-
vestigating its cause. Lord
Robens, chairman of the Welsh
Coal Board, admitted in his
testimony in April that safety
measures dealing with mining
slag were clearly inadequate at
the time of the Aberfan slide.
He noted, however, that this
situation has now been correct-
ed-.

The coal board has been
severely criticized for allowing
such dangers to exist. Senior of-
ficials of the coal board, how-
ever, claim, that they were un-
aware of the presence of the
water beneath the slag heap,
due to inadequate methods of
detecting underground springs.

Mine-Mill President A. C. Skin-

1893 through, 1909,; .

Dr. Clinton E. Jencks, who served for 10 years as a
local and international Mine-Mill representative and now
is a professor of economics at San Diego State College in
California, has recently undertaken the researching and
writing of a history of Mine-Mill from 1863 to the present.

While in no way an “official” history of the union,
the work is expected to fill a current void in the recorded
annals of the past century. Although parts of Mine-Mill's

history have been treated by
many historians, no such com-
plete history has previously
been attempted.

Cooperation Urged

Because of this, the union’s
international executive board is
urging that officers and mem-
bers of the many local unions
that Jencks plans to visit co-
operate with him to the greatest
possible extent. One of the ma-
jor tasks in which Jencks is
now engaged is the collection of
historical material for transfer
to the union archives being es-
tablished at the University of
Colorado.

For both his work and that of
other historians in the future, it
is important that valuable ma-
terial not be lost as Mine-Mill
locals are rechartered as locals
of the United Steelworkers of
America and enter a new phase
of history. ' "

Jencks, who has beenworking
with the archives at the in_ter-
national‘ office in Denver since

colleges, recently spent a few
weeks in the field. His experi-
ence indicates that, while local
union officials may feel that
most documents of interest have
been lost, much valuable mate-
rial can be tracked down, both
at local union halls and from
individual members and re-
tirees.

The San Diego State College
professor actually envisions two
works—first, a relatively short,
popularized version "to be used
as a guide for a lengthier and
more definitive history.

_ Five-Year Work

The job, he estimates, will
take at least five years, de-
pending on his success in win-
ning grants and fellowships that
would permit fulltime work on
the project. To date, Jencks has
been awarded a grant-in-aid to-
wards summer expenses for re-
search work by the‘ American
Council of Learned Societies and
another grant from the Rabino-
witz Foundation, which is con-

ditional on his ability .-to secure

A Proud ‘History

_  IS UNDERSTANDABLE if a degree of sadness accompanies

‘ these last weeks of the existence of our organization as an In-
I ternational Union. After all, the attempts to develop a hard-rock
- miners union go back to the days of the covered wagon and the
_,.-opening of the West. They go back to Virginia City, Nevada, where
’_104- years ago, on May 30, 1863, the first miners union, called the
‘(Miners Protective Association, was organized..

.  3,‘ It, took 30 additional years of bitter struggle and sacrifice to
give,birth to the Western Federation of Miners in Butte, Montana
'.._ i'n—{"1893. Twenty-three years later, in 1916, the W.F.M. became
f;3 the = International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. Even
 agvery limited ‘understanding of these 104 years of turbulent his-

tory. is enough to justify the fierce pride .
i ,that' our members and their fathers and
"’grandfathers have had in this hard-rock
.7..miners union. ' g A '
Fo1,‘-a-.union is much more than a trade
‘j name or a charter. A union is an organi-
-''_zation of peop1e—of people who preceded
us;-_as union members as well as those
who, are its members today. You can
c,h,a_1_1ge..the .trade name or charter of an
organization, but you cannot dissolve the
tioiltributions to trade union history made
by,o,ur.-predecessors. Nor will the experi-
er1¢e,:iand—militant tradition of our present
membership be any the less. We will
carry these assets into the merged organi- ,
zation and make important contributions, together with the mem-
bership of the United Steelworkers of America, to the advance-
ment,-and-welfare of all trade union members.

USWA OFFICE AND TECHNICAL WORKERS "are not second class employees in nego-

Chicago last month. Attending the two-day meeting at the Sheraton Hotel were several
representatives from Mine-Mill. L. to R: Iames Pinta, Mine-Mill international representa-
tive; Iohn Pastin, head of the USWA O&T Department, who chaired the conference; Mickey

First White Collar Conference

CHICAGO, Ill.-——-Urging more than £100 delegates in attendance at the United Steel-
workers’ First International White Collar Conference to work for contract safeguards

against the erosion through automation of clerical and technical jobs, USWA Vice-

President Joseph P. Molony pledged that the union no longer will tolerate the at-
tempt by companies to make white collar workers “second class employees in negotia-

tions.”.

Keynoting the well-attended May 11 and 12 conference, Molony pointed to the
fact that U. S. Steel had cut some 1,500 office and technical workers from its payroll

over a period of six years and
declared that methods must be
found to deal with displacement
by technological change.

The age of automation and
the computer provided the ma-
jor focus of the meeting, which
was attended by several Mine-
Mill representatives.

USWA President I. W. Abel,
who addressed the concluding
session, noted that the union
last year organized some 1,400
new white collar workers in 20
locals, bringing the Steelwork-
ers’ total figures to 25,000 white
collar workers in 2-50 local un-
ions. He stressed the need for
unity between office and techni-
cal and production workers, and
the necessity for them to under-

~ stand each other’s special prob-

lems. I

Attending the conference were
USWA members from virtually
every industry within the un-
ion’s jurisdiction. Delegates
came from throughout the Unit-
ed States, Canada, and Puerto
Rico. _0bservers also were pres-
ent from the United Auto Work-
ers’ Technical, Office & Profes-
sional Department.

Extensive Planning
John .Pastin, head of the

USWA O&T Department, who
chaired the two-day meeting, at
the Sheraton Hotel stated that
a planning committee of 1210-
cal union presidents had worked
almost nine months in its
preparation.

Other speakers included Dis-
trict 31 Director Joseph Ger-
mano, who welcomed the dele-
gates to Chicago; USWA Re-
search Director Otis Brubaker,
who discussed the urgent need
for cost-of—living protection in
O&T contracts; General Counsel

Bernard Kleiman, who reviewed »

a situation involving the trans-
fer of salaried workers to a new
computer center; and Ben
Fischer, head of the Arbitration
and Wage Department, who
made an arbitration report.

In line with the attempt to
devote increased attention to
the specialized needs of office

and technical workers, this
year's union proposals for the
nonferrous industry, drafted by

USWA and Mine-Mill delegates’

to the first Nonferrous Indus-
try Conference in Salt Lake City
in March, include a separate
section specifically dealing with
problems of 0&T employees.

already developed in nonferrous collective bargaining now in prog-
ress throughout the country. The merger of the Steelworkers and
Mine-Mill has cut through the rivalry and division of trade union
bargaining efforts of the past. There has developed a united labor
front at the bargaining table this year that none of us has ever

before experienced in this industry.

It is the mining companies this year, or a least some of
them, which are desperately trying to hang on to the old divisive

forms of local by local bargaining . . .

attempting’ to continue the

old whipsaw bargaining game of union against union. These ef-

forts will be in vain.

As a result of the merger of the two major unions in this in-
dustry, we now have theopportunity to bring collective bargaining
in this industry intolthe. 20th, century. This effort will benefit ever-y

Timliering collapse
Takes Lives of
Two Idaho Miners

A collapse of old timbering
brought death last month to
two miners. at the Silver Sum-
mit mine of the Hecla Mining
Company near Osburn, Idaho.
Edward G. Donovan, age 54,

and (Hans Gunderson, 51, were.
killed» in the accident on May 2.’

Donovan, leadman of the shaft
crew, and ‘Gunderson, a shaft
repairman, were repairing the
shaft from the top of the cage
when there was a sudden move-
ment of the south wall of the
shaft above the 1800 level sta-
tion, causing timbers to loosen
and fall. The cageidropped and
the men were killed when the
timber fell down the shaft on
top of them.

Gunderson leaves a wife and
three children, two of them de-

pendent, while Donovan has no
survivors.

In a report of its investigation
of the double fatality, the U. S.
Bureau of Mines says that in-
adequate wall support may
have contributed to the accident.
Its recommendations include a
statement that “Rock bolts
should be installed above and
below the old timbering prior
to timber renewal.”

The Bureau’ further recom-
mends ‘that “Extreme caution
should be exercised when clean-
ing rubble from the shaft and
retimbering, with particular em-
phasis on supporting adequately
the already loosened south wall
of the -shaft.” V _

C nadian Policy Conference
TORONTO, Ont.——Many of the major goals set by last year’s annual USWA Canadian Policy
Conference have been achieved over the past 12 months, National Director William Mahoney reported
to delegates to the 1967 conference, held at the Westbury Hotel here on May 17 and 18.
Pointing out that 1966 was a year in which it was necessary for labor to win back gains made by
the industry in 1964 and 1965, when many agreements were closed, he said the union scored some
notable successes. In the primary steel industry, for example, Mahoney said, the contracts won

will establish wage rate parity
with U. S. Steelworkers by their
termination dates.

Pension Achievements

He noted that last year’s'pen-
sion resolution called for a total
retirement income equal to 75
percent‘ of a worker’s best
earnings after 30 years’ service,
and said that, as a_result of con-
tracts negotiated with Inco,
Stelco, and Algoma, “we can
proudly claim to have achieved
this pension goal for over 30 per-
cent of our Canadian member-
ship-.”

Several Mine-Mill staff and
local “union members attended
the two-day session, at which a
report was made on the merger
of the Canadian sections of the
two unions, that will combine in
one union some 90 percent of
the country’s nonferrous metals
workers. The merger will be-
come effective on July 1, fol-
lowing a special Mine-Mill con-
vention in Winnipeg late this
month and subject .to its, ap-
proval by referendum vote.

Delegates also heard exten-
sive reports from District Di-
rectors Larry Sefton of Toronto,
Jean Gerin-Lajoie of Montreal’,
and J. C. Nicholson of Sy_dney,
N.S., whodiscussed the various

cratic Party of Canada, -called
for labor activity in the political
and legislative spheres on a
scale greater than ever before.

Wide Range of Resolutions
A The delegates, too, concerned
themselves with resolutions
on a variety of subjects,‘ in-

» eluding bargaining objectives,

mine safety, organization of the
unorganized, the operation of
the union, and legislation and
government policy. ,

Passed after considerable dis-
cussion was a five-point resolu-
tion on the war in Viet Nam,
which supports the idea of a
negotiated settlement that

i would reflect the military and

political realities of the country.
Disagreeing with advocates of
total victory or the unaccept-
able humiliation for any side‘,
the resolution urges the Ca-
nadian government to support
unconditional negotiations, open
to all parties, including the Viet
Cong, for an immediate cease-
fire; a United Nations role in
achieving an end to the con-
flict; implementation of the
Geneva Accords, including the

“No Room — or Any More Time — for

Compromise,” Declares Labor Secretary

Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz on May 5 announced health standards to
reduce the radiation hazard to American uranium miners. Four days later, in reporting
this to a Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, he blew the lid on the
shameful 17-year history of buck-passing and bureaucratic weasel-wording which has
contributed to the death and disability of these miners. Labor salutes and supports him.

In defending his action in setting the exposure limit, he declared there can be no
“deliberate condoning of an identifiable and preventable cause of death, or giving lung

cancer to uranium miners when
we know what we are doing.”
He warned the committee that:
O 98 miners have died of lung
cancer since 1963 and an-
other 250 to 1,000 (the esti-
mates vary widely) are al-
ready incurablyv afflicted
with it. . -
0 Of the 2,500 underground
uranium miners, presently
at work, about two-thirds
of them‘ are toiling under
conditions which at least
triple their chances of dy-
ing of lung cancer if they

ent working conditions.
The story behind Wirtz’ pre-
dictions is grim.

Long Recognized Hazard"

The major health hazard to
uranium miners comes from
radon gas. The gas quickly
breaks down into what are called
radon daughters which attach
themselves to dust particles, are
inhaled by uranium workers,
and cause lung cancer. The
radon daughters, although short-
lived, are deadly with alpha
radiation. _ .
' This effect has been recog-
nized for over 500 years at mines
in Germany and Czechoslovakia
where silver and cobalt have
been mined, but where uranium
and radium are present in the
ore. In 1880, the disease was
identified as lung cancer. '

Since 1950 in the United States,
assorted state, federal, and pri-
vate groups have been discuss-

I ing the problem of health haz-

ards in uranium mines. Medical
experts, compensation officials,
mine operators, state safety in-
spectors, the Bureau of Mines,
the Atomic Energy Commission,
the Department of Labor, the
Federal Radiation Council— all
have been involved. They have
allowed the problem to get hung
up over jurisdiction, authority,
disputed safety levels, and eco-
nomic feasibility.

Although several states —'have
set radiation levels, there has
been substantial opinion, reports
Wirtz, that these levels were
“too loose for human safety.”

FRC Meeting   ’

On May 4, the day prior to
Wirtz’ announcement, a meet-
ing of the Federal Radiation
Council was held at which it
was expected that a recom-
mended standard would be an-
nounced. (The FRC is a cab-
inet level committee which con--
sists of the Secretaries of De-
fense, Labor, Health, Education
and Welfare, Commerce and Ag-
riculture, and the Chairman of
the Atomic Energy Committee.

"Priority of Human Values"

Levels. (A Working Level, or
WL, is a measurement of the
quantity of radon daughters in
the air producing a specified
radiation. One WL is defined as
300 micromicrocuries of total
alpha radiation per liter of air.)

The present average exposure
of uranium miners is 2 WL,
down substantially from aver-
ages of 7 WL ten years ago and
10 WL twenty years ago. Even
at the current exposure level,
however, Dr. Leo J. Gehrig,
Acting Surgeon General of the
United States, told the Joint
Atomic Energy Committee, 287
lung cancer deaths might be ex-
pected over the next 20 years-
a figure amounting to 246 more
deaths from this cause than
could beexpected in this group
if they were not exposed to radi-
ation on the job.

Because many of today’s min- -

ers have been exposed to higher
radiation levels in past years,
estimates of actual deaths in the
next two decades are much
higher. Noting that it takes an
average of 20 years from the
time of over-exposure to death,
Dr. Gehrig said that mortality

figures will grow each year for _
. many years. Pointing out that

some 10,000 men have been em-
ployed in underground uranium
mines prior to this year, he said
statistics -indicate that 529 will
die of lung cancer, in addition to
the 98 already dead.

. Toll of 1.150 Possible

Still grimmer predictions say‘
the death toll may reach 1,150
by 1985.

Dr. Gehrig, who testified that
the incidence of the extremely
deadly disease among some of
these miners is 40 times the
normal rate, noted further that,

‘evenif the average concentra-

tion were to be reduced to 1 WL,
137 deaths could be anticipated
—-96 more than might be ex-
pected in a group of the same

size from the general popula-_
;  ‘ ’ I ‘

» only when the 1 concentration

is reducedto ,3 WL would the
projected lung cancer‘ mortality

rate among uranium miners be
brought down to the normal U.S.
level. At that concentration, Dr.

. Gehrig stated, 41 lung cancer

deaths among the miners could
be anticipated—about the same
level as might be expected
among the population at large.

It was this .3 WL figure that
Secretary Wirtz proposed as the
standard at the meeting of the
Federal Radiation Council on
May 4. He reported in his testi-
mony before the Joint Commit-

tee on'Ato‘mic Energy that this.

standard was concurred in only
by the Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare (John B.
Gardner) and the Secretary of
Defense (Robert McNamara). A
majority ofthe Council did not
‘support his proposal. Wirtz noted
that the Atomic Energy Com-
mission and the U. S. Bureau of
Mines support the less stringent
1 ‘Working Level figure as a
standard.

.3 WL Standard Set

The following day, however,
Wirtz acted, under the authority
of the Public Contracts law, and
announced that the .3 WL stan-
dard was immediately effective.
(Thirty days are provided for
comments on the standards,
which, Wirtz said, will be care-
fully considered.)

This level, .3 WL, is better
than three times lower than the
present allowable exposure in
Colorado — the only important
uranium-producing state which
has any radiation ‘standard set
out in its code. Additionally,
there is the factor that the

mines is not present.

state's "standard has not been

upheld. .

Thelatest available informa-
tion (introduced at the Senate
"hearings of March, 1966 on the
federal mine safety bill) shows
that for the third quarter of
1964, in the five states account-
ing for some 90 percent of the
country’s uranium, 53 percent of
the mines registered radiation
at 1 WL or more. In the same
period the following year, 1965,
the situation worsened—61 per-
cent of the mines were exposing
workers to radiation of 1 WL or
more.

In Colorado itself, with a 1 WL
standard set by the state code
and a state enforcement author-
ity, 56 percent of the mines
showed radiation at 1 WL or
above in the third quarter of
1964, And for the same period
in 1965, that percentage in-
creased to 61 percent.

Same Old Story
This is typical of the whole
picture of state ‘responsibility
for miners’ health and safety-

cient enforcement. 6 l

When reporting his action in

was sharply questioned. Con-V _

V (Continued From Page 8)
  Aspinall (D-Colo.) sharply criti-
 jcized the Labor Secretary for

what he said was failure to con-

sult the states on setting the

«.3 WL standard, and further
charged that Wirtz had prg-

J ,' Vieﬂmpted the authority of Con-
1 gress. (Aspinall, notorious

- C spokesman for the mining indus-
 -try, is no friend of labor. He
tried first to kill the metal mine

a safety bill, then to cripple it
with amendments. He voted

 1 against extension of the federal
Acoal mine safety act to cover
‘ smallmines. He voted against
~,~’_, , repeal of Section 14(b) of Taft-
  Hartley.’ His attack on Wirtz
Y./marks the third time in recent
years in which he is found op-
posing measures to improve

’ safety standards for miners.)

However, Wirtz had anticipat-
S ’ -ed this sort of criticism and an-
nounced that he had acted, in

I promulgating the standard, to

bring to a head 17 years of fruit-

less conferences and discussions
involving all levels of federal

 

 
   
  

and state officials.‘ He was sat- '

isfied, he said, that C under the
Walsh-Healey (Public _Contracts)_
 . law helrhad full authority to act.

Forceful Summation

In a biting, almost angrgg sum-‘

mation, Wirtz told the joint com-
‘mittee ‘that man “has unlocked
an infinitely powerful physical
force, offering unmeasurable
promise for the whole human
race. Part of the fallout of this
"discovery is that some men—
only .a few—are dying from
cancer caused by the methods
of developing its raw material.
7 This-. could be prevented——but at
some extra expense and possi-
bly with some delay.
_ “If the setting of a .3 WL stan-
V dard for radiation exposure is
. protested because it will close
V H‘ " , down a mine, the controlling
‘question will remain of whether
a/ looser standard will close
-down a man. Similarly of a
 V a hundred mines and one man.
if  , “If the protest is that the evi-
' . dence, is incomplete as to how

many men have died, or will,

4‘/I  A from lung cancer clearly attrib-
' rutable to radiation exposure in

_ V the uranium mines, the controll-
  ing replywill be that some un-

=  deniablyihave. Attaching signif-
 icance to how many lives have
 -:been taken knowingly and un-
anecessarily puts a lower price

on even one human life than
democracy’s authentic tradition
permits.

“If the point is made that
there is always some human
cost of industrial" advance, or
even normal commerce, the nec-
essary answer is that none of
this can be condoned. . . .
(W2'rtz’ emphasis.)

“The ultimate question here is
whether an economic enterprise
is to be required to satisfy the
human values it affects or
whether those values are to be
compromised to serve the enter-
prise. This issue rarely arises
in such clear, sharp outline.
When it does, there is no room
—or‘ any more time—for com-
promise.

“There is no more critical im-
perative today than this soci-
ety’s assertion of the absolute
priority of individual over insti-
tutional interests, and of human
over economic values.”

Metcalf Bill
In an effort to bring the issue
more sharply before the public,
Senator Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.)
plans. to introduce a bill to pro-
vide adequate. compensation,

through state and federal funds, '

to workers in the uranium indus-

try who suffer injury or death in

the course» of their work. He
quoted a private study, made

for the state of Colorado by the"

New York actuarial firm of
Woodward and Fondiller, Inc.,
which estimates that Colorado
alone can expect to face claims
for compensation totaling $8,-
500,000 for victims of radiation.

Franz, Jr., commissioner of
mines in Colorado, in testimony
prepared for presentation before
the joint committee on,June 6,
contends that 95 percent of the

_state’s uranium" mines would

have to shut down if Wirtz’ pro-
gram is carried out. He said
that even if the-1 Working Level
maximum is accepted (the fig-
ure in the Colorado code), it
would seriously affect 80 per-
cent of the Colorado uranium
mines.

A program of inspection of
uranium mines is being worked
out jointly by the Department of
Labor and the U. S. Bureau of
Mines. Compliance will be en-
forced through the Labor De-
partment’s authority under the
Walsh-Healey Act to recommend
against government contracts
with mine operators who fail to
comply with the radiation stan-
dard.

Ban on Industry

Sought by labor

A vigorous battle is being
waged‘ by several unions against
newly-instituted industry strike
assistance pacts, developed by
companies to cushion profit
losses incurred during labor
disputes. Such agreements have
been signed by various compa-
nies in both the airline and rub-
ber industries, affording strike-
bound businesses with insurance
payments from companies not

’ on strike.

The United Rubber Workers,
currently on strike against three
m ajor tire companies, have
filed an unfair labor practices
charge against the Firestone
Tire and Rubber C0,, insisting
that the rubber aid agreement
has interfered with good faith
bargaining. Not only does the
pact provide for reimbursement
of losses, said URW P-resident
Peter Bommarito, but it has the
effect of preventing an employ-
er from reaching an agreement
with the union ‘without the ap-
proval of_ the other companies
involvediin the pact. The URW
plans to file the same charge
against the four other rubber

companies which are parties to

this program,

A similar agreement K exists
among several airlines, During
the 43-day nation-wide air strike
last year, four strikebound air-
lines collected’ $44 million in
payments from the plan. Tem-
porary approval for ‘the strike
insurance, issued by the Civil
Aeronautics Board, is due to ex-
pire on July 10. The Interna-
tional Association of Machinists
and other unions representing
pilots, flight engineers, dispatch-
ers, clerks and transport work-
ers are askingthat the board
deny approval for its extension.

The legality of such plans has
never been tested. Should the
National Labor Relations Board
fail to uphold the URW unfair

labor practices charge against_

Firestone, the matter will prob-

ably have to be semen in the ,

federal courts.
The URW, meanwhile, is ask-
ing consumers not_ to buy,prod-

Farm Workers Win First
Texas Recognition Pact

RIO GRANDE CITY, Tex.——The AFL-CIO’s United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee established an
organizational foothold on Texas soil last month, when
a major Starr County grower agreed to recognize the
union as the bargaining agent for its workers.

Signing the pact were UFWOC Vice-Pres. Gilbert
Padilla and Virgilio Guerra of Los Velas ranch near,
Roma. It was agreed that negotiations for an initial con-
tract would begin immediately, with a provision to submit

to a mutually agreed-upon ar-
bitrator all issues not resolved
within 60 days. The ranch em-
ploys between 50 and 100 pickers.

Area-Wide Strike

The farm workers currently
are conducting a general strike
in the area, hoping to win simi-
lar agreements with other grow-
ers during the cantaloupe and
honeydew melon harvest, pres-
ently at its peak. The major ob-
jective is the La Casita ranch,
now the object of a nation-wide
“Don’t Buy” campaign.

The most successful tool in

-this organizational struggle has
' been thé’UFWOC’s,‘first interna- "

Strike Insurance 

tionalpicket line. The Confeder-
ationii‘ of T M e xi c a 11 Workers
(CTM), an affiliate of the Inter-
American Regional Organization

‘of Workers, has stationed pick-

ets across the Rio Grande River
at Miguel Aleman and Camargo
to discourage Mexican workers
from crossing the border to
work in the melon fields.

Redland black “Huelga” flags, '

were ﬂown at the crossings
from May 11 to 13, during which
time not a single Mexican work-
er crossed into the U. S. The
governor of Tamaulipas state
has since ordered the ﬂags re-
moved, but UFWOC officials
are negotiating to have them
hoisted again.

The growers are definitely
feeling the pinch. Not only have
they resorted to the usual prac-
tice of hiring scabs, but they
have used local politicians and
the Texas Rangers in getting
help to continue the harvest.

Rangers Ride Again
Not at all restrained about us-
ing their authority for strike-
breaking activities, the Rangers

have roughed up and arrested-
_ pickets for using boisterous and
profane language, jailed UFWOC ‘

 

_ Cesar Chavez
UFWOC Director

representatives, and even took
over the operation of a train
loaded with melons. A telegram
sent to President Johnson by
the union, charging the Rangers
with the use of physical vio-
lence and intimidation in deny-
ing citizens their constitutional
rights, resulted in Justice De-
partment investigators being
sent to the area.

Additionally, Guerra had been
“under pressure” T from the
other growers not to sign an
agreement with the union. He
and his five brothers have ex-
tensive holdings in Starr Coun-
ty, including the principal stock
interest in the county’s only
bank. The growers threatened to
withdraw their funds from the
bank if a union agreement was
signed, but Guerra signed the
pact anyway.

While the agreement with Los
Velas ranch is just the first in

-the Lone Star state, it repre-

sents a heartening breakthrough
toward the eventual goal of or-
ganizing the agricultural work-
ers across the country. The
UFWOC ah'eady has made great
strides, in. California, with such
properties as Schenley and Di-

. Giorgio now under -union’ con-

tract.

BISBEE, Ariz. —- Mitchel
La-rned, 24, a miner at the
Phelps Dodge Copper Queen
mine, was killed by a fall of
rock on May 5 at the com-
pany’s Campbell shaft.

Upon investigation by the
U. S. Bureau of Mines, it was
determined that Larned fell
from the fourth to the third
floor of 25 stope when. a post
collapsed, and was killed in-
stantly by a dislodged slab of
rock 4 feet long, 30 inches wide,

and 28 inches thick.

Larned and his partner, W. T.
Cole, were mucking out the
third floor and" preparing for
lagging the fourth. According to
the Bureau report, slushing of
the muck may have caused dis-
turblance of the ground around a
center post supporting two sets
from which caps had been re-
moved.

When Larned climbed to the
fourth ﬂoor, the post collapsed.

ing slab. and killed outright. It

insulting proposal:

to a continuance of the present
wage scale, health and welfare
program, pension and insurance

in many benefits,

this proposal is being made in

intend to hold Magma to its pro--

Death Takes Fannie
Petersen at Age 35

DENVER, Colo.—Fannie Petersen, Mine-Mill’s oldest pensioned
employee, died on May 16 at the age of 85. A veteran of 40 years
of service with the union, she had been retired since 1947.

She went to work for the union, then the Western Federation
of Miners, in 1907 at the international office in Denver, Colo. At

that time, the three internation-
al officers were in jail at Boise,
Idaho, charged with the murder

, of former Gov.’ Steunenberg. The

three, William “Big Bill” Hay-
wood, Charles H. Moyer, and
Charles Pettibone, were defend-
ed by the great Clarence Dar-
row, and were subsequently ac-
quitted.

Fitting Introduction 5

Miss Petersen viewed this dif-
ficult period as a fitting intro-
duction to a union whose history
has been one of leadership in
the cause of workers’ rights.
“The union has had its ups and
downs, but it always comes

"back. stronger than ever,” she

often said.

During her four decades with
Mine-Mill, Miss Petersen was a
secretary and bookkeeper, serv-

«ing as head bookkeeper for sev- '

eral'“years before retiring. She
moved‘ with the international un-
ion from Denver to Salt Lake
City in 1927, back to Denver in
.1936, and then to Chicago, in
1945. Five years after her re-
tirement, the , international of-
fice was again moved back to
Denver in 1952.

She was a member of Mine-
Mill Local 55 in _Tooele, Utah,
and also a member of the Unit-
ed Office and Professional Work-
ers of the CIO.

In appreciation for the ser-
vices she rendered to the union

"through the years, delegates to
3the 1941 convention in Joplin,
"Mo. awarded Miss_ Petersen with
:.a plaque, which hung in the
‘international headquarters for

many years and was “highly

- treasured” by her.
For the past two years, Miss.

Petersen resided at the Park-
side Nursing Home here. Up un-
til a year ago, she was a fre-

'.l"l-ICE" MINE-l«sIllLLs.,UNIO‘.N

quent visitor at the international
office, pointing to her continuing
interest in the union.

Funeral services were held on
May 20 at the Moore Mortuary,
with burial at Fairmount Ceme-
tery. Miss Petersen is survived
by two brothers, James Peter-
sen of Portland, Me. and Wil-
liam Petersen of Elgin, Ill., sev-
en nephews, and three nieces.

High Court Voids Calif.
Anti-Fair Housing Vote

WASHINGTON, D.sC.—The U. S. Supreme Court on

.May 29 held unconstitutional California’s Proposition 14,

which was approved by 2 to 1 margin in a November,
1964 general referendum. In effect, the 1964 vote had
wiped out two state laws prohibiting discrimination in
the sale or rental of dwellings and had given property

owners ‘.‘absolute discretion” in housing tra<nsactions.« “
Justice Byron R; White said in the majority opinion

of the court that the amendment made “the right ‘to

discriminate” one ofthe "basic policies of thestate. The

5—:f1'uling, with Justices John M.
Harlan, Hugo L. Black, Tom C.
Clark, and Potter Stewart dis-
senting, restores full potency to
California’s Fair Housing Act-
at least for the time being.

Repeal Campaign
Meanwhile, the 'state’s Real
Estate Assn. has wasted no time
in rallying, forces to have the
law repealed by the legislature.

Failing that, it intends to prey

sent another, more carefully
worded amendment for voter
approval in the 1968 general
election]

The California Senate has al-
ready voted to repeal the fair
housing law. Hearings are cur-

rently underway in the Assem- _

bly, with floor action expected

within a fewiweeks. Presently,
it appears that there is more
support in the Assembly for a
proposal to weaken the law
through amendments than to re-
peal it, but Gov. Ronald Reagan
has announced that he will sign
a repeal measure if it reaches
his desk.

Eitl_1er._action would most cer-

tainly add" sparks to the state’s 

already seething racial atm"o--
sphere. Since Proposition 14 was
passed, realtorsflandlords, and
many others selling houses have
ﬂatly stated, “We don’t have to
sell or rent to ‘Negroes now,
and we’re "not going to.”

Iowa Passes Law
. Fair housing‘ legislation re-—

‘ceived a warmer reception in

Iowa, with enactment in April

of a new law banning racial and_

religious discrimination in sales
or rentals. All housing is cov-
ered except owner-occupied
duplexes, owner-occupied room-
ing houses with six or less units,
and property owned by religious
institutions. Enforcement, how-
ever, may be a problem. The
Iowa Civil Rights Commission is
empowered to hold hearings on
complaints and to enforce any
anti-discrimination orders it is-
sues, but there are no specific
penalties provided for offenders.

Nationally, hearings are pres-
ently being conducted before the
Housing Subcommittee of the
Senate Banking and Currency
Committee on a bill (S1358)
which would ban by stages
housing discrimination through-
out the country. Housing trans-

actions involving federal financ-'

ing, already affected by a 1962
presidential executive o r d e r,
would be covered immediately
by statute. Unit dwellings of
five or more and non-occupant
sales or rentals would be cov-
ered in 1968, with the law ap-
plying to all housing tr.ﬁsac-
tions in 1969.

Chances for passage of the
measure are viewed as dim at
best, even by Congressional
supporters of the proposal, who
note the more conservative
character of the 90th Congress

l The Labor Scented’

  Half-Strike Proves Effective

Many unions that have in the past been shackled by strike bans, 
are perfecting and using a new approach to increase their effective- ' ‘:1
ness in collective bargaining sessions—-the half-strike. The strategy_ ' 
usually involves the submission to management of proposals, with 
a deadline date set for agreement. Pressure is then applied by the
workers in the form of slowdowns, union meetings on company V "‘
time, and large-scale sick leave absences.  

Nurses, teachers, social workers, and public employees have‘
all used this technique with surprising success in recent months. 
Such tactical maneuvering resulted in members of the Uniformed  
Firemen’s Assn. winning the first contract in the 102-year history 
of New York City’s fire department. 5 ; 1: "

Good Riddance! 5

European housewives are bemoaning the criticalservant short-
age, as restrictions are being imposed on one of the last sources ’
of exploitable domestic labor——the au pair girl. Devisedyears ago, 
au pair was an agreementbetween families in different countries A “
to exchange teenage daughters for a year so that the girls could
learn another language. They were expected‘ to help around, the
house in exchange for room, board, and some pocket money. The
system worked fairly well as long as regular servants performed V
most of the heavy work. - .. -- ‘j

In recent years, however, with an increasing standard of liv-  -
ing, regular domestic labor has been hard to come by, and the " 1'
burden of-.. the chores has fallen on the au pair girl. Manyworked — ,

  

:1-long,hours,i_with. some, not even receiving a day off. 

No more! Norway and Great Britain have signed an agreement ‘
regulating age minimums, wages, and hours worked. In addition, , _
the Council of Europe is setting up a convention on au pair girls .‘
that will standardize rules in its 18 member countries. ' ’

Business Leaders Pollecl

A recent Gallup poll on the question of industry-wide strikes;
was conducted among top business leaders in the country, produc-.. 9
ing few surprise answers. When asked if they thought new ways —,
should be developed to settle such disputes, 83 percent said yes.  ”
A total of .88 percent felt that labor unions covering whole indus-
tries are actually ‘monopolies and should come under the anti-trust
laws. Only 22 percent favored the use of a government-appointed
committee to settle a strike by compulsory arbitration, complain-
ing that labor is given more consideration than business inusuch
settlements. . » * * * » A -  5

Too-Early Forced Retirement Opposed -. -~ 5‘
Hearings were held recently before the Senate Committeeon -. 
Labor and Public Welfare on a bill which would ban age discrim-
ination in employment. Iris Peterson, a vice-president of the stew-‘ '
ard and stewardess division of the Air Line Pilots Assn., told the
committee that the only bona fide qualifications for flight attend- 3.‘
ants should be‘ the ability to provide service and safety. ' _- ’ "

Stewardesses have charged that many airlines consider their- 7 —?
ability to provide sex appeal more important than their other func-_ . ,
tions, and have pointed out that male attendants who perform‘ 
ﬂight services are not subject to compulsory retirement at a ‘cer- .,
tain age. Seven airlines now require stewardesses to retire by age - J:
35, with many othrs having unclear policies. -

Bearing on a similar subject, an arbitration case last month: ‘ f
ordered the reinstatement of an American Airlines stewardess with  
full back pay. She had been fired on May 1, 1966 because shewas. 
married. Officials of the Air Transport Division of the Transport?!
Workers Union, which represents stewardesses with the airline, 
called the decision a “milestone" ruling. It could affect 74 other.’ .
women who lost jobs with various airlines after they married. ~ ' x

Guaranteed Wage Maior Demand in 

Replacement of the standard hourly wage with a guarantee‘  
annual income shapes up as one of the major bargaining ‘gens

United Rubber Workers, with more than 50,000 workers already",on_ 3

rich Co., and Uniroyal, Inc., have demanded what the union calls
a full employment earnings program (FEEP). I W 

United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther also has stated
his intention to win a similar plan. “If they (auto companies)f-_,can
pay their executives by the year,” says the UAW leader, “they,c’an
pay their workers by the year.” Contracts covering some 700,000
auto workers expire this September. * / 1'

The group is presently engaged in assisting the USWA cam-
paign to bring genuine trade unionism back to the huge Bunker

 Locals Chart Joint Survey Backs Johnson's Call

For Improvements in Welfare

WASHINGTON, D. C.——~Early in the year, President Johnson announced that he

would set up a special commission of leading Americans to conduct a two-year study’

of Various proposals for guaranteeing a minimum income to all of the.country’s citi-
zens. Noting the ‘‘obvious faults” of the public assistance program in the U. S., the
President pointed to the “miserably low” state standards of need.

Declaring that “it is time to raise payments’ toward more acceptable levels,” John-
son said that in 18 states a family of four is presumed to be able to manage on $45 or

less per person for a month. In
many states, the chief executive
continued, actual payments av-
erage much less than their own
standards of need.

Now reinforcing the Presi-
dent’s plea is a recent federal
study of the 7.3 million Ameri-
cans on welfare which indicates
that only 50,000 stand any
chance of becoming self-support-
ing within the next few years.

Stating that “the question is

no longer whether there should
be handouts to the poor, but
how to break the poverty
cycle,” Joseph A. Califano, a
top White House aide, said the
survey shows that few can pos-
sibly expect to get off the wel-
fare rolls, “even if every pro-
gram, public and private, were
adequately staffed and effi-
ciently run.”

Survey‘ Breakdown .
It indicates the fo 1 l o w in g

breakdown of the 7.3 million
welfare recipients:

0 2.1 million over 65, with a
median age of 72.

. An additional 700,000 who
are either blind or so severe-
ly handicapped that their
work potential is “extremely
limited.”

9 3.5 million children whose
parents are unable to sup-
port them.

0 The remaining 1 million are
the parents of these chil-
dren, but only 150,000 are
fathers. Of these fathers,
100,000 are incapacitated.

Noting that this leaves only
some 50,000 who are capable of
being given job skills and train-
ing that will make them self-

- sufficient, Califano said, “Now

we must look beneath the sur-
face, and we must _do so with
analysis and judgment informed
by facts, with a willingness to

experiment, with a recognition
of past mistakes and a deter-
mination to correct them.”

"Negative Income Tax"

President Johnson has indi-
cated that one proposal that will
receive attention from the spe-
cial commission to be estab-
lished is the so-called “negative
income tax,” under which fami-
lies below a certain income level
would receive automatic pay-
ments from the treasury rather
than paying taxes to it.

Such plans may or may not
prove practicable and “are al-
most surely beyond our means
at this time,” President John-
son said, “but we must examine
any plan, however unconven-
tional, which could promise -a
major advance.” .-

Prospects for such an ad-
vance‘, however, if judged by
the current composition of the
Congress, are far from bright.
Only last month, on May 17, a
House coalition of Republicans
and Southern Democrats killed
the funds for financing the rent
supplements program, designed
to improve housing for low-in-
come families. The vote was 232
to 171.

. . . What we hold important is
man, eachman and each group
of men, and we even include the
whole of humanity.”

Increased possession is not
the ultimate goal of nations nor
of individuals, All growth is
ambivalent. It is essential if
man is to develop as a man, but
in a way it impri-sons‘ man if he
considers it the supreme good,
and it restricts his vision. Both
for nations and for individual

, men, avarice is the most evident
form of moral underdevelop-

“God intended the earth and
all that it contains for the use
of every human being and peo-
ple, "Thus . . , created goods

those of property and of free

“The world is given to all,
and not only to the rich.” That

constitute for anyone an abso-

one is justified in keeping for
his exclusive use what he does
not need, when others lack ne-

At Sub-District Conference

OAKLAND, Calif.-—-—USW-A Secretary-Treasurer Walter J. Burke,
the major speaker at a sub-district conference here on May 13 and

nizing in the face of the increasing automation of American indus-

, try. The union leader, -too, discussed labor movement history, in his

address, ’d'elivered only "a few weeks prior_to the 30th anniversary

Lobbying Slated
' » The meeting at the Hotel

Leamington here was called for
the purpose of discussing the

mutual problems of the variou .,
locals in the areas of collective"

bargaining, the operation of the
- grievance procedure, and legis-
lative activity. While Thomas
Consiglio painted a rather bleak
picture in his report on the leg-
islative outlook, it was decided
that representatives from many
of the locals would travel to
Sacramento the following week
to lobby for labor-backed bills.

District Director Charles J.
Smith, in suggesting the possi-
.bility of contractdanguage to
prevent companies from indoc-
trinating new workers with an
anti-union bias, said that, par-
ticularly in areas where there is
the union shop, the companies
try to make new hires believe
that contract benefits are pro-

vided through the generosity of

the employer, with the union '
. siphoning off unwarranted dues

payments.‘ These. new ' workers-

The introduction of industry
is a necessity for economic
growth and human’ progress; it

‘is also a sign of development ~

"and contributes to it.

But it is unfortunate that on
these new conditionsof society
a system has been constructed
which considers profit as the
key motive for economic prog-
ress, competition as the su-
preme law of economics, and
private ownership of the means
of production as an absolute
right that has no limits and
carries no corresponding social
obligation. This unchecked lib-
eralism leads to dictatorship. ..
producing “the international im-
perialism of money.” One can-
not condemn such abuses too
strongly. . . . But if it is true
that a type of capitalism has
been the source of excessive suf-
ferings, injustices and fratricidal
conflicts whose effects still per-
sist, it would also be wrong to
attribute to ‘industrialization it-
self evils that belong to the woe-
ful system which accompanied
it. On the contrary one must
recognize in all justice the irre-
placeable contribution made by
the organization of labor and of

-- industry to what development

has accomplished.
=i<  =I<

We must make haste: too
many are suffering, and the dis-
tance is growing that separates
the progress of some and the
stagnation, not to say the re-
gression, of others.

Individual initiative alone and
the mere free play of competi-
tition could never assure suc-
cessful development, It can even

be affirmed that economic

growth depends
.pl_ace upon,.soc,i_al progress; thus I
basic_- ‘education’ is ‘the’ primary L
object of .any ‘plan of develop-

ment. What must be aimed at
is complete humanism.

:14 :i:

There can be no progress to-

-ward the‘ complete development
of man without the simultane-'

ous development of all human-
ity in the spirit of solidarity.

Today no one can be ignorant
any longer of the fact that in
whole continents countless men
and women are ravished by hun-
ger, countless numbers of chil-
dren are undernourished .
whole regions are condemned
to the most depressing despond—
ency.

We must repeationce more
that the superfluous wealth of

rich countries should be placed,

at the service of poor nations.
The rule which up to now held
good for the benefit of those
nearest to us, must tdday be
applied to all the needy of this
world. '

But it is necessary to go still
farther. At Bombay we called
for the establishment of a great
World Fund, to be made up of
part of the money spent on
arms, to relieve the most desti-
tute of this world, Only world-
wide collaboration . . . will suc-
ceed in overcoming vain rival-
ries. .. . . '

When so many people are hun-
gry, when so many families suf-
fer from destitution, when so
many remain steeped in igno-
rance, all public or private
squandering of wealth, all ex-
penditure prompted by motives
of national or personal ostenta-
tion, every ‘exhausting arma-
ments race, becomes an intoler-
able scandal. We are conscious
of our duty to denounce it. Would

The world is sick, Its illness
consists less in the unproductive

division and hatred within coun-

Wide Use of Nuclear Fuel Forecast

Arthur D. Little, a management consultant, predicts that when
private ownership of uranium and plutonium comes into effect in
1973, there will be a big demand to be met by uranium producers
in the United ‘States. He contends that the demand for nuclear fuel
will skyrocket in the 1979’s, when as much as two-thirds of power-
generating capacity will be using it, rather than other fuels.

He told uranium producers to expect to have to make substan-
tial expenditures for explorataion and for construction of processing

Union Radiation Expert Blasts Uranium Mine Hazards

Leo Goodman, veteran United Auto Workers staff man and secretary of the Atomic Energy Tech-
nical Committee of the AFL-CIO Industrial Union Department, recently delivered the John Fogarty
Memorial address in Washington, D.C. The memorial, under the auspices of the Medical Care Sec-
tion of the American Public Health Association and the District of Columbia Public Health Associa-
tion, honors the late Rep. John" Fogarty of Rhode Island, a long-time Congressional fighter for public

health legislation.

Goodman’s topic was “Radiation Hazard in Modern Industry.” He devoted” much of his attention
to the plight of the uranium miners in the western states, and of their widows and surviving depen-

dent children. Goodman gave
the names of ten widows of
Colorado uranium miners who
have died from lung cancer.
They received workmen’s com-
pensation payments ranging
from $13,250 to $22,858,

But the state of Utah, he said,
thus far has not paid a single
claim to the widow of a uranium
miner who was the victim of
lung cancer caused by breathing
radon gas. Goodman said that
national interest is focused on a
case now before the Utah Su-

- preme Court which seeks to
have the court require the state
Industrial Commission to accept
the judgment of the U. S. Public
Health Service as to whether a
death from lung cancer was or
was not attributable to previous
exposure as a uranium miner. '

. Meanwhile, he said, the U. S.
government , continues . to deny
“to the widows of the men whom
we in the IUD call the ‘Atom’s
Peaceful Soldiers’—the men who
die working in this industry but
whose widows cannot get even
a measly workmen-’»s compensa-
tion because the Atomic Energy
Commission’s funds are used in-
stead to createa national psy-
chology that they have the safest
industry in the country. . . ..The
AEC lies; the others (other gov-
ernment agencies) accept the
lies.” '

Hearings Underway ‘

Goodman said the Joint (Con-
gressional) Committee on Atomic
Energy, which is now holding
new hearings on atomic health
hazards, should call the widows
of "uranium. miners who have
died from atomic exposure as
witnesses instead of government
bureaucrats.

In a‘ matter-of-fact recitation
of deadly statistics based on his
own research, Goodman told’ of
the failure of the federal and
state governments, - the Atomic
Energy Commission, and the
private; atomic energy industry
to provide protection for “atomi‘é_'
workers. , ' V _

He charged that ‘the control
of atomic health problems can-
not any longer be left to, those
with selfish interests in the pro-

. motion of atomic energy pro-
jects. He said physicians and
those interested in" medical care

‘ “must rise up and insist on the
priority to which their role in

‘ ‘ societyientitles them.”

M (Goodman’s address was de-
livered before Labor Secretary

“V  Wirt='sré¢¢nt1v tssnedisa

; 

 

federal radiation standards for
uranium mines under the
Walsh-Healey Act. See story on
pages" 8 and 9.) '

Colorado River Polluted

He recited the story of the
“callous accumulation of tailing
piles in the millions of tons each
containing disintegration prod-
uct of uranium and radium
families which polluted the C010-
rado River with isotopes whose
half-lives ranged up to 1620
years.”

The radioactive waste piled on
the banks of the Colorado River
was leached by the weather
from the waste piles and “pol-
luted the river as well’ as the
atmosphere.”

Goodman criticized the role of
physicists assigned to control
health problems in nuclear
plants, pointing out that these
scientists have taken to calling
themselves “health physicists.”
He quotes one such “health
physicist” as having written a
few years ago as follows:

“Just as in conventional safe-'
ty, the slogan of the 1930’s, ‘Safe-
ty First,’ has since been dis-
carded in favor of a balance’be'-
tween accident. “prevention ‘and
operational convenience or econ-
omy, so in the radiological field
a balance has always been nec-
essary between radiation risks

and operational considerations. .

It is the ability. to reach a. ra-
tional and satisfactory balance
or compromise that is the funda-
mental test of the health physi-
cist’s professional ability.”

" Apart from the’ fancy phrase"-'
ology, the quotation above well

, reﬂects the, attitude of most --

state mine inspectors today. The
enactment of the federal metal

and non-metallic mine safety

law last September and Labor
Secretary Wirtz’ recent estab-
lishment of radiation standards
for uranium mines provide evi-
dence that the federal govern-
mentdoes not sh_are this easy-
going approach to safety stand-
ards. -
