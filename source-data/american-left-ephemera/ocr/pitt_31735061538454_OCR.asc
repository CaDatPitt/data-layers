 THE
TRUTH ABOUT
JERRY BROWN

Jerry Brown, one of the media's favorite young
politicians, sleeps on a mattress on the floor;
listens to Joni Mitchell and Linda Ronstadt; and
has read Allen Ginsberg and the Whole Earth Catalog.

Billing himself as an "antipolitician" politi-
K cian, Brown hopes to turn a bit of working people's
dissatisfaction to his own account. ~

é Lots of image, few issues: that's Brown's
strategy. "In this business, a little vagueness
goes a long way," he philosophizes.

There is another side to Brown’s
image, however. The California gover-
nor has favorably impressed America’s
ruling rich as a ruthless Scrooge where
government-funded social programs
are concerned. Newsweek called him a
“closet Reaganite.”

The Wall Street Journalagrees. A
May 1976 editorial explained that

Brown's “new generation” of politi- b

cians “looks like a refreshing change
of the political scene. . .
politic can use any injection it can get
of ﬁscal responsibility and skepticism
about government’s ability to remake
society.” ‘

To” “set an example” for other
Californians, Brown has ostentatious-
ly refused to take up residence in the
state’s luxurious govemor’s mansion;
and he has eschewed his ofﬁcial
limousine for a Plymouth from the
state motor pool.

Brown also tries to sugarcoat his
austerity measures in verbiage bor-
rowed from the ecology movement.
“People in their own heart of hearts
know that we are in a limited world,”
he says. “We all sense it in our own
personal vibes.”

Or, “We must bring into our con-
sciousness planetary realism . .
knowing that there is a bottom line to
our resources . . . that are planetary
limits.”

For American banks and corpora-
tions, Brown’s talk about “lowered
expectations” comes as a welcome bit
of sermonizing at a time when work-
ers’ expectations are rising rapidly.

cutbacks record
However ethereal Brown’s rhetoric

may often be, his cutbacks in Califor- .

nia have been painfully down-to-earth.
He conspired with Democratic state
legislators to slash a proposed school
funding bill from $220 million to $115"
million. He then used his veto power to
lop another $27 million when the bill

. the body _

crossed his desk.

Brown also vetoed funding of learn-
ing centers for autistic children and
opposes increased expenditures for
Medi-Cal, a state medical plan, and
other services. “People don’t want to
give something for nothing,” he ex-
plained. “They don’t want to help do-
nothings and ne’er-do-wells.”

The wealthy elite to whom Brown

caters clearly don’t “want to help"
anybody or anything other than them-
selves.

Brown boasts about his “prolabor”
record, pointing to legislation giving

. teachers certain collective bargaining

rights. This gain, however, was won
through struggle by teachers, not
given by Brown. ‘

The govemor’s concern for teachers
is more accurately gauged by the
layoffs and school cutbacks caused by
his tight-fisted budget.

Unemployment

Brown ’s only proposal "to lessen
unemployment is the Democratic par-
ty’s Humphrey-Hawkins bill. This
bill doesn’t commit Washington
to creating even one job for America’s
10 million unemployed.

The governor's own record in Cali-
fornia is no better. ‘‘If we have a
dramatic jobs program for, say, 30,000
persons,” he says in his own defense,
“it might just attract 30,000 more
people to California.”

What about the crisis of the cities?
Brown told New York 1*'u.~t reporter
Robert Bazell that cities like New York
may be “things of the past." After all,
he explained, cities are a relatively
recent development in human history.

Brown is not nearly such a skinllint
when it comes to America’s $115
billion war budget. “Military costs
have gone up,” he told Playboy maga-
zine, “and I don’t realistically think
the budget will be cut.”

In the same interview Brown ex-
plained, “I get the impression that
we're being pushed around a lot and
that America has become a big sap for
the rest of the countries.” ,

“And I don't like it,” he continued.

“We have a lot of strength, so I don't
see why we should have guilt feelings
and act like we’re always the fall guy."

While Brown opposed the Vietnam
War, today he refuses to support
unconditional amnesty for those exiled
or dishonorably discharged for resist-
ing that war. When two Village Voice
columnists asked him, “Would you
support liberation movements in
Rhodesia diplomatically and militari-
ly?” he replied, “I'm not prepared to
say that.”

Asked about CIA and FBI crimes,
Brown told Playboy. “There’ve been
abuses; these agencies have gotten out
of control and have to be brought back
into control. But in the process, we
may end up throwing out the baby
with the bath water.”

Civil rights fighter?
What about Brown’s record on issues
of special concern to oppressed nation-

al minorities?

The governor’s admirers point with
pride to Brown’s role in passing a law
banning redlining, the practice of
denying personal and commercial
loans to Blacks, Chicanos, and other
minorities. What is the truth about
Brown’s role in putting this legislation
on the books?

The governor's contribution was
primarily to water down an originally
tougher bill to make it more palatable
to California's savings-and~loan inter-
ests.

The California governor is also
opposed to busing. This has undoubt-
edly lifted the spirits of racist oppo-
nents of court-ordered desegregation
Brown pretends that he is a “friend”

of farm workers. He bases this claim
on compromise legislation worked out
under his administration authorizing
elections to secure union representa-
tion.

Friend of tarm workers?

Since passage of the California law,
however, Brown and his Democratic
party cronies have crippled it. Leo
McCarthy, speaker of the California
State Assembly, pushed through a bill
denying UFW organizers access to the
ﬁelds during the workday. Comment-
ing on this pro-employer move, Brown
said, “I believe the assembly acted
wisely and with courage.” The gover-
nor has refused to back a UFW-
initiated referendum to restore this and
other essential rights to agricultural
workers.

Brown’s touted concern for the
earth’s environment is also phony. For
example, he did not support Proposi-
tion 15, an initiative on the June'76
ballot to place stiff’ safety restrictions
on the nuclear power industry. The
Sierra Club, a leading environmental-
ist group, rates Brown’s record as only.
“fair."

What is left of Brown’s accomplish-
ments as governor?

To deflect attention from his pro-
industry policies, Brown plugged up
one or two loopholes in corporate tax
laws. Under the pressure of populai
support for gay rights, he signed a bill
repealing antihomosexual statutes.
And to distract attention from his
inaction on the needs of working
people, especially the most oppressed
layers, Brown has appointed women
and nonwhites to many state offices.

The truth is that Jerry Brown is not
a guru, not a “child of the sixties,” and
not a friend of the farm workers--or of
anyone else who works for a living. He
is a sly, smooth-talking capitalist
politician

Fred Halstead and the other California Socialist
Workers party candidates don't share Brown's view that
working people should lower their expectations.

Halstead champions the rising expectations of
working people around the world. Never before have
technological advancements promised such a bright
future for humanity: a future without hunger,
disease, and inequality; with expanding wealth and
leisure time; with unbounded potential for the
enrichment of human civilization.

It is not "planetary limits" that are holding
us back from this future, Halstead contends. The
shackles on human progress have been placed there
by the capitalist system.

A vote for the Socialist Workers slate is a
vote to replace that system with a democratic,
socialist society based on human needs. A vote
for Brown or any other Democrat or Republican
is a vote to preserve the capitalist system and
enrich the tiny minority who profit from it.

Next November you can take your pick.
