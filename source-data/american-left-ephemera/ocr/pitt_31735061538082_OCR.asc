they are determined to ﬁght militantly and to bring in:
to play all their battery of forces against it. The Greens
and other reactionaries of the A. F. of L. also know What
it means to their antiquated system of craft unionism and
their fat bureaucratic jobs, and that is why they, too,
are ﬁghting against the success of the steel campaign,
even going to the extent of splitting the labor move—
ment by ousting the C.I_.O. unions, in order to prevent
it.

When the big steel strike comes, its winning must
be made the ﬁrst order of business for every progressive
force in the United States. A great steel strike would
be a turning _point not only in the trade union move—
ment, but in American life generally. The ﬁght of the
steel Workers for organizationis the cutting edge of the
struggle of the toiling masses against the Whole lineup
of reaction and incipient fascism in the United States.

CHKPTER TWO
STEEL swarm-:: STRATEGY

‘HEN organized labor goes into such an im-
‘   portant strike struggle as that evidently now‘

, looming in connection with the organization
of the steel industry it must proceed with a deﬁnite
strike strategy, based upon a realistic measuring of the
balance of the opposing class forces and modiﬁed from
time to time as changing circumstances dictate. VVe may
be sure that the employers, in their ﬁght to preserve the
open shop, which‘ is worth billions to them in extra prof-
its, are going ahead with a highly developed strategy.

In the following pages, therefore, I shall undertake
to outline some of the major principles of a sound strat-
egy and tactics for the steel workers’ struggle; to de-
velop a line of policy that is realistic and justified by the
present economic and political situation and by the gen-
eral relation of forces between the capitalists and the
Workers. The leaders of the C.'I.O. and the Steel Work-
ers Organizing Committee are, of course, experienced
strike leaders, and it is not for me to instruct them in
strike strategy. There remains, however, the task of
putting into popular form the principles of strike strat-
egy and strike organization in this very vital situation.

In the development of any severe strike struggle be-
tween the workers and their employers the following
general propositions, among others, should be constant-
ly borne in mind.

First, the cultivation of a ﬁrm ideological solidarity

in the ranks of the strikers. The bosses, proceeding from

thetraditional exploiters’ principle of divide and con— .

quer, constantly attempt to split the workers along lines
of skilled and unskilled, Americans and foreign-born,
Negroes and whites, men and Women, employed and
unemployed, adults and youth, Catholics and Protes-
tants, radicals and conservatives. This danger is especi-
ally very acute in struggles in the boss—ridden steel in-
dustry.

In 1919, the employers and their tools tried with all
these means to pit one section of the Workers against the
other and they may be depended upon to do so again in
1937. As against these disruptive moves the workers’
leaders must counter by a loyal defense in the interests
of all these various groups, thus making them all feel
that they have everything to gain from the success of
the general movement.

They must focus the attention of the masses primari—
ly upon the immediate economic and political demands
of the steel Workers and reject all reactionary efforts to
divert the Workers’ attention into abstract discussions of
race, religion,politics, etc. Especially there must be no
boss—inspired Red—baiting allowed to take root in the
steel Workers’ movement and to disrupt its forces. The
steel campaign can be a success only if the maximum
possible ideological solidarity of the workers is achieved
and maintained.

Second, another important consideration in the ques-
tion of developing a successful strike strategy is the care-
ful cultivation of a high morale among the strikers.

This is very necessary in ﬁghting such a vicious combi—‘

nation as the steel trust, and morale building must be

12

 

 

gone about systematically. The achievement of the ide-
ological solidarity previously discussed is an important
element in developing a good morale among the work-
ers, but it must be supplemented by various other fac-
tors, including persistent education of the masses re-
garding the strike situation and the political meaning
of the struggle, by cultivating mass participation in
strike activities and democratic control of the strike, by
exercising a determined and reliable leadership, by a
ﬁrm but not mechanical discipline, an effective drama-
tization of the struggle, good strike organization, etc.

Third, a further elementary question of good strike
strategy is to proceed upon the general principle of the
offensive. Workers, like soldiers, ﬁght best on the at~
tack. A defensive strike is a losing strike. The steel
workers should never allow themselves to be put on the
defensive. Every halt must be utilized to organize
a new attack and every attack by the employers or the
government must be offset by some form of renewed
counter offensive. Only when workers are completely
defeated is such a policy not possible. The steel workers
must know how to guard their strike reserves and to
draw upon them when a new forward movement is nec-
essary. The present economic and political situation
greatly favors a policy of the oﬁfensive.

These elements of strike stra’tegy—-a ﬁrm ideological
solidarity of the workers, a high morale in the strike,
a strike that proceeds upon the principle of the oPfen—
sive—must be constantly borne in mind in developing
every stage of the coming struggle. But there are many
other principles of strike strategy, no less important,
which I shall now proceed to discuss in some detail.

13

    
 
 

 

The United Front

A uniﬁed command is a fundamental principle of V

strategy in all strikes, as Well as military operations.
What is involved in it is the uniﬁed action of the ﬁght-
ing forces. Failure to achieve such a uniﬁed strike leader-
ship, principally’ through craft divisions, has cost the
workers many a bitter defeat. Especially is a uniﬁed
command and real solidarity of the Workers necessary
to beat the open shop kings in the steel, auto, rubber,
oil, etc., industries.

\ The industrial form of the C.I.O. unions conducting
the struggle in these industries lays a solid foundation
for a uniﬁed command and the Vital strike unity. Nev-
ertheless a danger threatens from the craft union lead-
ers of the American Federation of Labor. ‘These reac-
tionaries, although they themselves for years have done
nothing to organize the mass production industries, are
extremely antagonistic towards the Committee for In-
dustrial Organization doing the job. They assume a
dog-in—the-manger attitude. It is more than likely,
therefore, that they will inject themselves into the situ-
ation and try to inveigle a fringe of the skilled Workers
into their many disconnected craft unions. At the mo-
ment I Write these lines they are following such a strike-

A breaking policy in the General Motors auto strike.

Such an action Would be a crime against the steel,
auto and other Workers, as it would seriously split their
ranks and weaken their ﬁghting" force. But no one fa-
miliar with the shady history of the reactionary A. F.
of L. leaders need be surprised to see them adopt such
a disruptive course. They have done it time and again

14

 

in strikes of independent unions. The danger is all the

 

 

greater inasmuch as the trust magnates, happy to see
the workers dissipate their strength ﬁghting each other,
always greet and encourage the craft union leaders in
their splitting tactics. Nor would such a development
be unwelcome to the Roosevelt administration as offer-
ing a proliﬁc source of slippery compromises.

‘The introduction of craft unionism into the mass pro-
duction -industries by the A. F. of /L. leaders should be
resisted militantly by ‘every progressive force in the
whole labor movement as a strikebreaking policy. This
resistance should be supported by an aggressive cam-
paign to educate the unorganizedmasses as to the his-
torical failure of craft unionism in the mass production

‘ industries, and by a call to these workers not to join the

craft unions but to aﬂiliate themselves with the C.I.O.
industrial unions.

If, nevertheless, the craft unions should succeed in
getting into steel by the time the strike "takes place, they
must be dealt with on a united front basis, and
unity of action sought in this manner. They should

be drawn into- the strike on a full cooperative basis with‘

the industrial unions. This means that they ought to be
allowed and induced to send regular delegates to the
strike committees, and likewise to their sub-committees
for relief, defense, publicity, etc., and that they should
also participate in the mass picketing and other mass
strike activities. The craft leaders would object to this,
so it would have to be done over their heads by direct

appeal to the membership. Only in the unlikely event,

however, that the craft unions should become real fac-
tors in the steel industry would it be practical to make

15

 

 

the resultant trade union agreement of a joint char— »

acter signed by other unions as well as the A. A.

In the developing great strike movement at all cost
there must be prevented the shameful but all too com-
mon spectacle of union strike—breaking, that is, of one
or more unions striking While the others Work. The
solidarity of labor demands that the craft unions stay
out of the mass production industries and leave the ﬁeld
to the industrial unions. For them to enter these indus-
tries at this time could serve the interests of no one but
the great trust magnates and reaction generally.

A Determined Obiective

A good military strategist never forgets his main ob-
jective, although bad leaders often do so. He refuses
to allow himself to be diverted from his goal by the
feints and tricks of his opponents. And so it is with the
labor strategist; he, too, must always keep his major
objective in mind. He must constantly be on the alert
to keep the employers from sidetracking his Whole

\ movement into the fatal swamp of delay, disintegration

and betrayal. Especially is such vigilance necessary
when the enemy is the powerful and resourceful steel
trust.

Up till the present time the central strategy of the
steel corporation has aimed at destroying the steel cam-
paign by giving niggardly Wage increases to the workers
and by cultivating the company unions, although their
great plant supplies of tear gas, machine guns and other
deadly Weapons show that they are preparing for drastic
violence. The employers have been unable as yet under
the present circumstances to employ the widespread dis-

16

 

 

charge of workers, suppression of free speech, terrorism
of workers and organizers, etc., with whichthey op-
posed the organizing campaign in 1919.

As soon as the movement of the steel workers ap-
proaches the point of mass action we may expect that
the steel barons will go into the next stage of their anti-
union strategy, not only by using more terroristic
methods, but also by having recourse to the policy of
seeking to divert the whole thrust of the union away
from the companies and into a hopeless morass of gov-
ernmental committees, court action, time—killing media-
tion, etc. The ﬁrst real test of the steel workers’
strength and strike strategy will "come when they have
organized the bulk of the workers and they serve their
demands upon the Iron and Steel Institute for a con-
ference to work out a national trade union agreement
for the steel industry. It is at this point that the steel
companies will attempt to paralyze or kill oh‘ the work-
ers’ movement by bogging it down in a swamp of dis-
integrating maneuvers.

This is when the workers must be most acutelyon
guard and when they have to persist most determinedly
towardstheir central objective of forcing concessions.
directly from the employers. The steel workers must
not trust their cause into the hands of the Roosevelt
government. The government is allied with many great
capitalist interests, and it cannot be depended upon to
force the steel trust to make a settlement favorable to
the workers. Especially must the steel workers beware
that Roosevelt’s “era of good feeling” policy does not
result in some sort of a compromise disastrous to their
movement. If Hearst and other labor haters are en-

17

 

 

  

thusiastic over the so—called “era of good feeling” it is

‘because they see in it a possible means to check the

workers’ advance to trade union organization and better
living conditions. . 3 _
Still fresh in the minds of the workers are the maneu-
vers by which the Roosevelt government, the courts and
the A. F. of L. leaders killed off the Weirton steel strike
and also the devious means by which they ruined the
powerful movement of the steel Workers in~1934-, the
one being sidetracked into endless court actions and the

' other getting lost in the trickery of a board set up by

Roosevelt. These defeats of the steel workers through
the Roosevelt government are in line with those of the
workers in the automobile and other industries during
the days of the N.R.A. And Roosevelt’s recent Whole-
sale cutting of unemployment relief and his general at-
titude of conciliation toward the employers has not in-
creased the workers’ conﬁdence in him.

 

Such experience must serve as lessons to the steel

workers in their present developing struggle. Towards
the Roosevelt government their attitude must not be
-one of naive reliance, but of mass pressure to preserve
civil liberties in the steel areas and to force the steel
trust to yield to the demands of its workers. The steel
workers must not let their movement degenerate into
mere court actions to defend their right to organize, or
long—winded government-controlled elections suppos-
edly to learn whether or not the AA. has the right to
represent the steel workers. These questions must be
settled by pressure against the employers and, if neces-
sary, by mass strike action. ’

The central aim of the movement should be a direct -

18

 

 

settlement between the unions and the employers, and
every step takenmust be directed to accomplish this
end. The steel Workers should not enter into arbitration
proceedings or other settlement maneuvers engineered
by the government unless, ﬁrst, their major demands
h-ave been conceded, and the steel trust is most unlikely
to make such preliminary concessions. These Warnings
are especially necessary inasmuch as the Workers still
have many illusions regarding the liberal policies of the

Roosevelt government and such illusions can easily lead.

to defeat.
A Maximum Mobilization of Forces

Should the employers fail in their inevitable attempt
to liquidate the steel Workers’ movement through gov-
ernment or court action, or’ through some such phony
arbitration as employers have so often defeated Workers
in the past, then in all likelihood they Will set out to beat
the C.I.O. and the Amalgamated Association in an open
strike struggle. Just What kind of a fight. they are get-
ting ready to make may be gathered from the fact that
they are now storing up their plants With machine guns,
riﬂes, tear gas, etc., and are even drilling their thugs
in preparation for a ﬁerce strike; The steel Workers,

therefore, must base their plans upon the practically

certain prospect of a great strike against the steel cor-
porations. .

The perspectiveof a huge national strike confronts
the workers’ leaders with the necessity of bearing close-
ly in mind another basic principle of strategy, that of
mobilizing a full suﬂiciency of forces to achieve their

objective. A good strategist never sends a boy to do a

man’s job. This strategic principle may be illustrated by
an old—time circus story: A boss canvasman was ex-
plaining to a visitor how vitally important it was that
the cook—Wagon should arrive early on the circus lot in
order that the men could breakfast, or else they would
not put up the big top.

Said he: “N o cook—Wagon, no breakfast, and no
breakfast, no Work,” and he explained therefore, that
they always used the precaution of having eight of the
strongest horses to pull the cook—Wagon over the muddy
roads.

“But,” inquired the visitor, “suppose the roads are so
poor that your eight horses can’t pull the cook-wagon,
what then?”

“Oh, then,” said the circus boss, “we put on more
horses, and if they can’t do the job we get out old
Babe the elephant, to push it from behind.”

“Still,” persisted the visitor, “suppose the roads are
so terribly bad that even all these horses and old Babe
together can’t haul the cook—wagon through the mire,
how about that?”

“Oh hell,” declared the boss with ﬁnality, “We just
put on more horses and more horses. The damned cook~
wagon simply has to go through.”

It is in this spirit of unconquerableness that the Work-
ers’ leaders must face the eventuality of a national steel
strike. They must be prepared to throw more and more
forces into the struggle until ﬁnally they budge the
“immovable” steel trust. The steel campaign must come
through and_that is all there is to it. Nothing will be
handed to the Workers gratuitously, either by the bosses
directly or by the government. All they will get is what

20

 

 

 

4

they are willing and able to ﬁght for. The key to the
winning of the movement of the steel workers is the
greatest mobilization of labor’s forces ever made in the

\ United States.

The Proper Time and Place

Another major strategic consideration that must al-
ways be borne in mind in strikes is that of dealing the
blow at the best time and place. The enemy must be hit
both at the proper moment and its most vulnerable spot.
The steel workers, if they keep this point clearly in
mind, are in a splendid position to win.

The C.I.O. plans to have the majority of the steel
workers organized by the middle of February, 1937,

‘after which the demands of the workers will be sub-
mitted to the American Iron and Steel Institute and a

a conference insisted upon. This is a practical schedule

and it climaxes the steel movement at a most favorable
"moment. Undoubtedly by the date set the great ma-
jority of the workers can readily be organized. Then,
allowing a few weeks for preliminary negotiations, the
steel situation should come to a head somewhere about
the end of March. .

This is just the time (March 31) when the national
agreement of the 5 00,000 bituminous miners expires.
From a strategic standpoint obviously the correct thing
to do is to link up the struggle of the steel workers
with that of the bituminous coal miners, and possibly
also of the anthracite miners, thus developing a broad
movement of about a million coal miners and
steel workers. This appears to be the aim of the
C.I.O. and, if so, it is sound strategy. The interests of

21

 

  
  

these two basic sections of the workers are bound up to-
gether. They have largely the same forces of massed
ﬁnancial capital to ﬁght, and there is every reason Why
their ﬁght should be combined into one general move-
ment against the closely allied steel and coal corpora-
tions.

A joint strike of the one million steel Workers and
coal miners would exert a tremendous power. It would
bring to a standstill the two most basic industries and
tie up other industries far and Wide. It would constitute
by far the greatest strike in American history. In View
of the favorable situation in industry, with production
rapidly rising, the combined coal miners and steel work~
ers would probably be able to secure Victory, forcing the
open shop kings, for the ﬁrst time, to treat their work-
ers like human beings. But labor should “make assur-
ance doubly sure” by hooking still more horses to the
cook-Wagon if need be. There must be contemplated, the
extension of the strike struggle among the Vast armies
of workers in the automobile, rubber and heavy metal
and electrical fabricating industries, and also further,
if necessary.

, The C.I.O. is now conducting organization cam-
paigns in these mass production industries. In the
present situation, so Very- favorable for organization
Work, its campaigns can easily and should be speeded up
so that the unions involved (Which, as they are led by
the C.I.O., would not have to depend upon the reaction-
ary leaders of the A. F. of L.) can also present their de-
mands to their employers by the end of March, if not
sooner. The entrance of the Workers in the auto, rub-
ber, aluminum and other highly Vulnerable and closely

22

 

 

 

interlinked mass production industries simultaneously
or at approximately the same time into the struggle
would enormously strengthen the Whole movement.
Such a movement in the key industries would constitute
a most effective coordination of the strategic principles
of opportune time, key place, sufficient power, etc. While
each of these great groups of Workers has its own de-
mands, the entire movement should be coordinated
around the central strategic task of winning the de-
mands of the steel Workers. This main objective espe-
cially must not be forgotten in Whatever settlements
are arrived at in the various industries. ‘

It may turn out in reality that the steel workers, coal
miners, automobile Workers, etc., will not actually co-

ordinate their national movements—the auto Workers

especially are running ahead and developing a great na-
tional struggle of their own. Possibly, in View of labor’s
present extremely favorable position, these great
groups, acting separately, may achieve their major de-
mands. It is also possible, although most unlikely, that
they can secure their demands Without great strikes.
Nevertheless, the foregoing proposed line of strategy,
the linking together of these big movements, with steel

‘ as the center, is basically correct. It Would be a tremen-

dous manifestation of labor’s power. It is the best course
to be followed under the present circumstances, the
policy that would insure the workers’ victory most
quickly and completely in these industries and open the
doors the Widest for a general advance by labor on all
fronts.

Every conservative and reactionary inﬂuence will be
exerted to prevent the steel Workers, miners and other

key Workers from acting jointly and will seek to defeat
or half defeat them one section at a time. It is, there-
fore, the great task of the progressive forces to do all
possible to link the steel, coal, auto and other Workers
into one great united front ﬁghting movement against
massed ﬁnance capital.

To What extent it will turn out to be possible to call
into action labor’s -heavy ﬁrst line reserves, both to Win

their own demands and to achieve victory in the steel

struggle, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear 5
whether the steel workers strike alone, jointly with the
miners, or in combination with other industries, at least
they must have substantial support from the railroad
Workers. The latter must refuse to haul raw materials
into, or ﬁnishedproducts out of the steel mills. If the
conservative leaders of the railroad brotherhoods do

' not agree to prohibit the hauling of cars in and out of

struck mills the rank—and~ﬁle railroad Workers must
be organized not to go through the picket lines into the
mills and all this in spite of the wage concessions that the
companies are evidently preparing to give them to lull
their ﬁghting spirit. Failure of support from the rail-
road workers in this elementary respect was a basic
cause for the loss of the 1919 strike and it must not be
repeated.

Organized labor must be prepared, if necessary, to
support the approaching steel strike by strike action
far and wide in many other industries. At all costs the
steel Workers’ struggle for organization must be Won.
The fate of the trade union movement is bound up With
the steel workers, Whose movement must needs be car-
ried through to Victory.

24-

 

 

 

Political Action in the Strike

A national strike of steel Workers, and especially a

great combined strike of workers in steel, coal and other
industries, Would be highly political in character. It
would become immediately the central political issue of
the country. No one would have a keener appreciation

of this fact than the employing interests of the country. »

In such a situation, We might be sure that they would
shout revolution in all keys, and try to utilize the gov-
ernment to stampede the Workers back to work in a Wel-
ter of violence and confusion.

The Workers must also be acutely aware of the polit-
ical character of the developing mass struggle and, as
good strategists, be prepared to use every political
weapon at their disposal. In the great general strike
in England in 1926, one of the Worst errors made by
the conservative union leadership was to ignore the ob-
viously basically political character of the movement
and to try to keep the struggle restricted to the eco-
nomic sphere. This was disastrous, as it prevented the
workers from utilizing their many political means of
struggle. Such a mistake must not be made in the great
struggle that in all probability will develop before the
organization of the steel Workers is conceded by the

— steel trust.

 

Let me repeat: political action does not consist in re-
lying upon the Roosevelt government to Win. the
workers’ ﬁght against the steel trust. On the contrary,
the workers must mobilize all their political organiza-
tions and sympathizers to reinforce the great economic
strike struggle of their unions by bringing mass pres-

25

 

 

 
   
  

sure upon the government, local, state and national, to
prevent the use of troops, injunctions, etc., against the
strikers and to force a strike settlement favorable to
the workers. Immediately with the development of
such a great strike movement as now appears certain,
Labor’s N on—Partisan League, the various Farmer—La—
bor Party groups, the Socialist Party, the Communist
Party, the progressive blocs in the national government
and state legislative bodies, and other political forces
sympathetic to labor, should all connect up their forces
to mobilize public sentiment and bring determined po-
litical pressure against the steel corporations through
the government.

The occasion of the strike should also be utilized po-
litically by labor’s coming forward militantly with its
whole legislative program for the preservation and de-
velopment of civil rights, for the 30~hour week, im-
proved social security and unemployment relief, the le-
gal right to organize, abolition of company unions, pro-
hibition of scab-herding and spy systems, etc. A victory
in steel should be accompanied by a general advance of
labor legislation in every ﬁeld.

A great strike in steel, coal and other industries
would also put immediately upon the agenda of the day
the question of the political mass strike, and the workers
must, from the outset, prepare to use this powerful
political force. It is certain that in many localities,
especially where the authorities tried to suppress the
right to picket and when they used violence against the
strikers, local general strike movements would or could
result. Also, on a national scale, should thesteel trust,

supported by organized capital, make a determined ef—.

26

 

 

 

 

fort to defeat the strike by violent measures, the ques-
tion of ainational general strike would almost certainly
become a living issue among the ranks of labor, regard-
less of the eﬁorts of the reactionary trade union oﬂicials.
the employers and the government to prevent it. The
political mass strike could have as its objectives the
Withdrawal of troops and the re—establishment of civil
rights in the strike areas, the removal of anti—labor
government oﬂicials, the advancement of important la-
bor legislation thrust up by the strike situation, against
the shipment of strike breakers, against evictions of the
strikers, for placing of strikers on government unem—'
pl.oyed relief, the release of arrested strikers, and for
the favorable settlement of the strike.

During the past several years the American working
class has gained much experience with the weapon of
the mass political strike to add to its previous experience
with the historic Seattle and‘Winnipeg general strikes.
It learned very much about this form of political strug_—
gle in the great San Francisco strike of 1934, as Well as
in such local general strike situations as those of Pekin,
Terre Haute, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, etc. The many
valuable lessons from these struggles must be used if
such strikes occur during the approaching labor up-
heaval. Should the organized employers seriously

_ threaten to beat the strike of the steel Workers and the

other mass production workers, the masses of American
workers generally must defend the right of the steel.

CHAPTER THREE_ ,
s'r1:£:1. swarm: onannrzmrion

major principles of strike strategy and tactics nec-

essary to apply in the event‘ of a great strike in
steel and allied industries. It now remains to consider a
number of others required to insure the success of such
a struggle. These include good strike preparations,
thorough—going strike organization, democratic strike
leadership, mass participation in strike activities, care of
the material welfare of the strikers, mobilization of the
strike reserves, etc. -

In View of the existing very favorable economic and
political circumstances a national strike of steel Workers,
and especially a great strike of steel workers and coal
miners combined (and also possibly other industries),
would create a situation extremely diﬂicult for the em-
ployers to handle, and would probably be of short dura-
tion. Nevertheless it would be dangerous simply to
place reliance in the prospect of a short, quickly victor-
ious strike. If the employers determine to ﬁght against
the unionization of the unorganized Workers militantly
and with all their power, the consequence might Well
be a long and bitter struggle, even where such huge
masses of Workers are involved.

We must remember that the 1919 steel strike of
365,000 Workers lasted three and a half months; also
that the national railroad shopmen’s strike in 1922 of
400,000 Workers continued for ﬁve months, and that

28

IN THE previous chapters I have discussed several

 

 

 

 

the great coal strike in 1927, involving some 500,000
Workers, Went on more than a year. In fact, as I write
this, We are now seeing the powerful strike of 70,000
maritime workers lasting over two months although it
has shipping completely paralyzed on the entire Pa-
ciﬁc Coast and badly lamed on the Atlantic and Gulf
Coast. And the glass workers, also, have been on a na-
tional strike 14- weeks already.

In any event, whether the employers intend to resist
to the last ditch or not, the best Way to bring about a
speedy and favorable settlement of the probable 1937
steel strike, which the bosses are forcing on the workers,
is to make that strike the biggest, best organized and
most effective in American labor history. The principles
of strike organization outlined in this chapter are cal-
culated to help achieve this end. They are based on
sound experience and can be applied not only to steel,
but also to automobile and such other industries as may
be involved in mass strike movements in this period.

Strike Preparation

Fundamental to the carrying out of a good strike
strategy is a thorough preliminary organization for the
struggle. This is equivalent to the recruiting and train-
ing of an army before the battle. Such preparation is
especially necessary in an industry like steel, Where the
Workers have had Very little experience in organization
and disciplined action, and Where the power and ruth-
lessness of the enemy they have to ﬁght are enormous.
Good preparation gives the Workers incomparably
greater striking power. It is on the same principle that
drilled troops are far better ﬁghters than raw recruits.

IN 1919,.after the steel trust, by the use of troops,
tion, had violently broken the strike of 365,000

as steel Workers and lashed these oppressed toilers back

into the mills, I ventured to forecast in my book, The
Great Steel Strike and Its Lessons, that “it will not be
long until they have another big movement under Way.
. . . The great steel strike of 1919 will seem only a pre-

_ liminary skirmish When compared with the tremendous

battles that areibound to come.”

This forecast is now in all» probability about to bere-
alized. Events are fast shaping up for the greatest
labor struggle in American history, one that will in-
volve unparalleled masses of striking workers, and
probably several industries, in the very heart of the
industrial system, with the steel industry as the storm
center. of the whole movement. Already the beginnings
of this huge struggle are to be seen, as I write this, in
the upheavals among the automobile Workers.

The Long Struggle of the Steel Workers

Ever since the decisive defeat of trade unionism in
the steel industry during the great Homestead strike
44- years ago, the steel trust has ruthlessly lorded it

3

 

 

In strike preparation the ﬁrst thing to be considered
is the building of the union itself. This requires that the
present steel campaign be speeded up so that practically
the entire body of steel workers are members of the

. union before the actual strike begins. Nor should the

oﬂice workers in the steel plants be left out of the steel
union in its drive to organization. Under the stimula-
tion of the great strikes in the auto, glass and other in-
dustries and with the workers present readiness to or-
ganize this speeding up can be easily accomplished by
the application of broader methods of organizing work
———that is, the holding of great series of mass meetings,
widespread radio broadcasts, vast distribution of litera-
ture, etc. It should not be difficult, with the use of such
intense organizing methods, to soon have the workers
pouring into the union in a great ﬂood. The steel cam-
paign should aim at solidly organizing every worker in
the steel towns, including restaurant workers, building
trades, retail clerks, etc., into their respective unions.

The extension of the union to include all possible
masses of the steel workers is the main insurance against
the development of the dangerous back—to—Work move-
ments that are always organized by the employers in
every great strike and which are now so menacing in the
automobile strike. It is, of course, vitally necessary to
organize the most important key plants, but the work
must not be conﬁned to them.‘ It must take in the Whole
steel industry.

Can the sit—down, stay—in and walk-out types of local
strikes which are now so rapidly organizing the workers
in the auto industry also be used in the preliminary
stages of unionizing steel? This remains to be

30

 

 

 

learned. As the steel movement grows, as the Workers
feel the union .becoming strong,_ as their morale and
feeling of power rise, and as they see Workers in other
industries conducting local strikes successfully, the steel
workers, smarting under long years of injustice, may in-
cline to try such strikes themselves, at least in the smaller

» independent plants. Whether or not they can do so

successfully will depend upon whether the employers
take advantage of such local strikes to force unprepared
and disastrous partial struggles. In any event, the C.I.O.
will do well to proceed cautiously in this matter, to
guard carefully against untimely local strikes and to
continue its present strategy of subordinating all local
activities to the development of a great disciplined na-
tional movement of steel Workers.

It may well be that the method of the stay—in strike
will be applied to many steel plants in the event of a
general strike call. Whether or not it will be used will
depend upon several factors: if the Workers consider the
experience in the automobile industry Was successful, if
the government is hostile and will permit the use of
gas and other violence against stay—in. strikers, if a
union feels strong enough to control the plans Without
staying in, if the prospect is for a long or short strike,
etc. It was the steel workers, in Homestead in 1892,
who gave the first and most heroic American example
of strikers’ occupying struck plants and it may be fol-
lowed in the approaching strike.

Besides signing up the workers it is also necessary,
as soon as practicable, to set up the new local unions of

the Amalgamated Association, and to get them func— -

tioning. These locals should be not merely general con-

31

 

 

 

 

 

‘.4-~—«.  “x-.---I.-«...t-i‘:f:': ,

glomerations of all the Workers from each mill 5 they
should be departmentalized, with sub—locals for the
most important mill departments. New oﬂicials should
be elected throughout the union. The establishment of
the locals and new ofﬁcials will do much to raise the dis-
cipline of the men; it will give them more of a feeling
of being organized and will increase their conﬁdence in
each other and in the stability of the movement. Such

solid organization will double the weight of their blow‘

When the strike test comes.

Good strike preparation also requires that the com-
pany unions be entirely merged into the AA. before
the time the probable strike actually takes place. If not,
the bosses will attempt to use them as strikebreaking
organizations. The company unions, declaring openly
for the AA. and its demands, should from now on
carry on the most active campaign to mobilize their

membership into the trade union. And if, when the _

strike does occur, the company unions are not entirely
absorbed by the A.A., they should join in its strike call
and then» formally merge With the trade union. The
declaration of the strike must sound the death knell of
company unionism in the steel industry, if the workers
have not succeeded in killing it even before that time.

Should there be any A. F. of L. craft unions in the
steel‘ industry when the strike takes place theyshould
be linked up with the A. A. and should join in its gen-
eral strike call.

All these organization preparations for the strike
should be accompanied by a most thorough education
of the steelworkers on the tasks and signiﬁcance of the
coming strike. The union demands should be literally

' 32

 

 

 

plastered over the entire steel industry, and also pop-
ularized far and wide throughout the whole country.
With myriads of bulletins, leaﬂets, stickers, posters, etc.,
as well as broad radio campaigns, newspaper advertise-
ments, etc., the workers and the general public should
be taught the meaning of the struggle and be kept ad-
vised of its progress. Great mass local, district and na-
tional rank—and—ﬁle conferences and meetings of steel
workers and as things approach a head, a great mass
strike vote, should be utilized to educate and organize
the steel workers for the coming struggle. .
The old adage “Well begun is half done” applies to
strike strategy as well as to other activities. The ﬁrst
blow isoften decisive. Usually trade union strikes are
badly organized, which weakens them from beginning
to end. But this one must be different. It should be

. thoroughly prepared, organizationally and ideologic-

ally. If this is done, then when the steel workers almost
certainly strike in 1937, their walkout will be so com—
plete that “no one will be leftin the mills even to blow
the whistle”. r’

Democratic Strike Leadership

One of the basic means for building a strong strike
and for the working out of good strategy is the devel-
opment of a democratic strike leadership through na-
tional andlocal broad strike committees. Usually A. F.
of L. strikes are managed by small and remote com-
mittees of bureaucratic oﬂicials. These people, whose
conservative and slippery policies make it necessary
for them to prevent rank—and-ﬁle “interference in the
strike control”, remain quite detached from the working
masses. They issue arbitrary commands to the workers,

33

  

  

 
 

who have practically nothing to say about the Whole
.strike. Commonly the result is that the latter’s high
qualities of discipline, enthusiasm and ﬁghting spirit
are but little developed. Thus the entire: strike is
weakened. .

The broad democratic strike committee system, which
is based on the best strike experience the World over,
is vastly superior to the prevailing primitive A. F. of
L. system of a handful of dictatorial oﬂicials running
the strike as they please. The broad strike committee
gives the workers the realization that the strike is
really their affair. It awakens in them an intelligent
discipline and not merely a blind obedience to orders;
it raises their morale, avoids the usual mass passivity
and brings about the maximum mass’ activity. Above all
_it provides the means for the strikers to contribute their
intelligence to the shaping of Strike policy. The broad
strike committee system also aids the work of the
strike executive leaders by connecting them directly
with the masses. It facilitates their knowing what is
actually taking place in the strike ﬁelds, What tactics‘ the
bosses are using, what are the Workers’ moods, etc.

It also ‘provides the mechanization for the “swift
mobilization of the Workers for a needed defensive or
oﬂensive maneuver. This system of broad strike com-
mittees has been used to a considerable extent in the
A. F. of L. needle trades, and other progressive Amer-
ican unions, but especially by the revolutionary unions,
such as the I.W.W., T.U.U.L., etc., and by many
unions in other countries. It has always proven highly
effective. The coming steel strike, in keeping with the
progressive character of the C.I‘.O. movement, should

me‘

systematically apply the powerful weapon of the broad
strike committee. V

The democratization of the strike leadership should
start at the top. The national leading committee of the
Whole strike should consist not only of the national
union executives but also of striker representatives
from the various striking areas (and industries, if more
than steel is involved). This broad committee, with
proper departments for publicity, relief and defense,
should deal with major questions of policy. It should
meet frequently and have a small executive committee
carry on the strike leadership between meetings.

Large departmentalized strike committees, based

4 u on the re ular union oﬂicials lus a broad re resenta—
P 8 P P

tion of mill strikers, should also be organized in the
respective steel towns and districts, as local circum-
stances may dictate. Each steel mill should also have
its own broad strike committee. The mill strike com-
mittees should conduct their local activities under the
leadership of the local or district strike committees;
the size of the committees varying according to the size
of the mills, the rate of representation ranging from one
member for each 25 workers to one member for each
100 workers. Such mill strike committees should be
thoroughly representative of all departments, special
care being taken also to see that Negroes and foreign—
born workers are fully represented and elected to re—
sponsible leading posts. The Women’s trade union aux-
iliaries should be represented in the strike committees.
The mill strike committees have a maze of functions.
Especially complicated are their tasks in the case of
stay—’in strikes. They have to be organized, through

«35

 

 

 

 

 

sub—committees, to attend to picketing, discipline, food,
sleeping arrangements, medical care, entertainment, de-
fense, liaison with the local strike committee and other
struck plants, etc. Consequently, the mill committees
must be highly responsive to the needs and control of
the strikers.

The strike committees, national, district, local and
mill, should be fully authorized to conduct the strike
in all its phases, the various regular trade union organs,

such as national executive boards, district councils, local A

unions, etc., meeting only to transact routine business
not immediately connected with the strike. The various
strike committees should be elected on the eve of the
strike. Before the strike is ended the national strike
committee should submit the proposed. terms of settle-
ment for a referendum vote by the strikers.

These principles of democratization and departmen-
talization should also be introduced into the A. A. struc-
ture as the union is built. The A. A. constitution is
obsolete, unﬁtted for the steel industry and should be
completely rewritten. '

Mass Strike Activities

The working out of a good strike strategy requires
the highest degree of mass participation by the strikers
in the organized activities of the strike. More than that,
it also involves drawing the strikers’ families into
these activities, for the strikers’ women and children
are also very eﬁective ﬁghters and morale builders.
Onlyby such a general participation of the whole strike-
bound population and the development of the highest
degree of activity possible by men, women and children,
can the maximum striking power of the workers be

36

 

 

realized. In this respect again, the coming steel strike
must be vastly superior to the ordinary A. F. of L.
strike, in which, because the conservative leaders fear
the growth of militancy among the rank and ﬁle,'only
a small percentage of the workers, not to speak of
their families, actually carry on the strike, the great
mass remaining passive.

In previous pages I have discussed Various forms of
cultivating a high degree of mass strike activity————the
holding of democratically elected local, district and
national rank—and—ﬁle pre-strike conferences to formu-
late and popularize the Workers’ demands and to elect
the union officials, the taking of a national mass strike
vote, democratic participation in the broad strike com-
mittees, general voting upon all settlement proposals,
etc. To these measures should be added the holding of
frequent mass meetings during the strike, mass pa-
rades ‘o.f strikers; mass marches of men, women and
children from district to district and mill to mill, the
sending of small delegations, or ﬂying squads of work-
ers, from one area or industry to another; the teaching
of the strikers to sing labor songs in their meetings and

demonstrations ; the development of sports activities '

for the youth 5 the holding of social aifairs, etc.

But the most important of all forms of mass strike
activities is mass picketing. Good picketing is a decisive
factor in every big strike—that is Why employers are
so rabidly opposed to it. Picketing is usually grossly
neglected in the ordinary A. F. of L. strike, only a few
of the workers carrying it on, and then merely in a
desultory fashion. The consequence is a great loss in
the holding power of the strike. The best Way‘ to con-

37

 

duct picketing is on a mass basis. Not only should all
the strikers be mobilized for picketing, but their Women
and children as Well. In addition, prominent liberals and
others should be brought into the strike areas from the
outside to march in the picket lines. Where one or more
industries are striking, joint picketing should be organ-
ized. The unemployed can play a most important role
in picketing, and the members of non—striking unions
should also be systematically drawn into the work.
Women’s and children’s picket lines should be organ-
ized on special occasions. This system of broad mass
picketing raises enormously the political level, enthu-
siasm and resistance power of the strikers. It has been
used eﬁcectively in many I.W.W. and T.U.U.L. strikes,
by the more progressive A. F. of L. unions, and by
many unions in foreign countries. When the 1937 steel
strike comes, the progressive C.I.O. should adopt the
modern, effective system of mass picketing.

The picket line should be well organized, not mere
crowds of workers. It should be under the control of
the picket committee, which is a section of the strike
committee. The picketers should be organized into

.squads, each squad headed by a carefully selected cap-

tain. All strikers should be required to do their bit at
picketing. The youth especially should play a big role
in the organization of the picket lines. The picket com-
mittee must maintain pickets around the mills at all
times, Whether or not they are trying to operate with

_ scabs. Especially must there be great mass picket lines

on Monday mornings and upon all occasions when at-
te_mpts are being made to bring scabs in-to ‘the mills.
Often the difference between bad picketing and good

38

 

 

picketing is the difference between a lost and a won
strike. ‘
Strike Publicity

I The question of a well—organized strike publicity is
most fundamental to the success of a great strike in
steel, or a combined strike of steel, coal, auto, etc. In
such a big strike the capitalists will frantically howl
that the whole movement is an insurrection, a revolu-
tion, and they will throw their entire publicity machine,
the newspapers, radio, etc., into the task of terrorizing
the public and of driving the workers back to the mills

in a Welter of violence and confusion. In the 1919 steel

strike they used such a Red scare effectively, with the
help of the Wilson government. In the San Francisco
general strike in 1934- they also loudly shrieked revo-
lution and created a hysteria among sections of the
population, and they do the same thing to a greater or
lesser extent in every strike. We may be absolutely
certain, therefore, that their poison—gas campaign would
be inﬁnitely Worse in the case of the prospective nation-
wide steel or steel-coal strike involving up to a million
or more workers. ' ' e

To combat successfully this vicious strikebreaking
propaganda offensive of the employers will be basic for
the -winning of the strike. In order to create a favorable

public opinion it is necessary that the workers develop .

a great publicity counter-oﬁensive of their own. They
must dissipate the charges of revolution by centering

~ the whole agitation around the immediate economic

and political demands of the struggle. They‘ should re-

lentlessly expose the vast riches and proﬁts of the em-

ployers and the health-destroying, spirit-killing poverty
39

«A

 

over the vast army of steel slaves. The steel barons
have enforced upon the Workers the most ruthless ex-
ploitation, With low wages, the long day and Work
week, infamous spy systems, boss tyranny in the mills,
wholesale slaughter by unprotected machinery, etc., etc.\
They have made of the steel towns dirty, miserable, ‘xx
poverty—stricken, disease—laden shack communities ruled
by gunmen and servile company political tools and
devoid of all culture and beauty. And the national and

\
l

 

state governments have actively assisted in maintaining " !

this outrageous situation.

The steel Workers have waged many fierce and de-
termined struggles to end their intolerable position: the
heroic Homestead strike of the Amalgamated Associa-
tion of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers (A.A.) in 1892,
the hard—fought battles of the AA. in 1901 and 1909,
the brave struggles of the I.W.VV. in McKees Rocks in
1909, the huge national strike of the 24 allied A. F. of L.
unions in 1919, the bitter strike of the Steel and Metal
Workers Industrial Union (T.U.U.L.) in Ambridge
in 1933, the general organization campaign of the A.A
in 1934 and many other big movements throughout
the years. During these heroic struggles for liberty,

workers and union organizers, and their martyrdom is

company thugs have jailed and murdered many steel 

symbolized by the asassination of the able and coura- 
geous organizer, Fanny Sellins, who was shot to death S

by steel trust gunmen in 1919.

All these courageous battles of the steel Workers were
lost, that is, lost in the sense that they failed to achieve
their major goal of unionizing the industry. Some of

4-

- -__.._,.,___...,.. 2 -gm

 

of the workers, the terrorization and suppression of
civil rights by the bosses’ gunmen, the great signiﬁcance.
to American democracy of a Victory by the Workers, etc.
The strikers must know how to dramatize their struggle
by sending women’s and children’s delegations to the
state legislatures and to Congress, by securing investiga-
tions by government and citizens’ committees, by cover-
ing the country with a network of sympathetic mass
meetings, by staging great mass demonstrations of all
kinds throughout the strike areas, by monster mass
picket lines, etc.

Not the ‘least of this essential publicity work is the
education of the strikers themselves, who will be sub-
jected to the ﬁercest propaganda barrage from the em-
ployers in attempts to stampede them back to work. The
striking workers should be systematically taught the
meaning and implications of the strike through a plenti—
ful ﬂow of regular bulletins, special leaﬂets, mass meet-
ings, radio broadcasts, etc. Especially must they be kept
informed in detail as to the progress of the strike itself.
In this connection, in case of a hard strike, among other
such measures to be adopted, rank—and-ﬁle delegations
should be sent from district to district so that workers
may be directly informed as to the status of the strike
from personal observation. In 1919, in the later stages
of the struggle one of the most effective strikebreaking
methods of the bosses was to have fake delegations of
workers Visit Various strike districts and then start false
reports and demoralization among the strikers, both in
their home‘ towns and other centers. Neglect of the fun-
damental task of systematic education could easily result
disastrously in a, bitterly fought steel strike.

4-0

 

To meet these huge educational tasks of creating a
favorable public opinion and of keeping confusion out
of the ranks of the strikers, the national strike com-
mittee should set up a special publicity section, with
an experienced publicity director in charge. This pub-
licity department, in addition to building its own im-
mediate publicity machinery, should systematically
mobilize the trade union, revolutionary and liberal
press, as Well as friendly radio broadcasters and news-
papermen working on the capitalist press. All these ele-
ments cooperating together Would constitute a a great
educational force, one that could make the voice of the
strike heard loudly and clearly in every corner of the

country.
Strike Relief

Strikes, like armies, march on their stomachs, and
many are the strikes that have been lost through hunger.
In making ready for a great strike in steel it is necessary
that all preparations be made to build up a strong sys-
tem of strike relief, despite the probability of the strug-
gle being of short duration. In the matter of relief
work, as in so many other of their phases, usually Amer-
ican strikes are Very weak. Strikes which provide relief
systems that can serve as types for the coming strike
were the 1919 steel strike and the 1926 Passaic textile
strike.*

The strike relief machinery should be, in operation
not later than two weeks after the strike begins, because

* See The Great Steel Strike and Its Lessons, by William
Z. Foster, and The Passaic Textile Stri/ee, by Mary Heaton
Vorse. V

4-1

 

 

 

from the outset there are always emergency cases re—
quiring attention. The C.I.O. general call for a strike
fund ought to go out immediately upon the declaration
of the strike. This to be supported by calls from the

A. F. of L., individual trade unions, state federations,_

central labor councils and other sympathizing organiza-
tions. Of course, the reactionary A. F. of L. leaders will
either openly or covertly oppose such strike support,
but their opposition must and can be broken down by
rank—and—ﬁle pressure.

The striking union or unions should set up an organ-
ized relief department as a sub-section of the general
strike committee, with an experienced relief organizer
in charge. Strike relief work has two general aspects——
collection and distribution—and there must be created
special organization for each. On the collection side, the
organization should consist of: (a) trade union strike
relief committees in Various cities and towns, (b) united
front relief committees or other workers’ organizations
in the same localities; (c) special relief committees of
liberal professionals, clericals, paciﬁsts, Writers, etc. All
theseicommittees are to be coordinated through the na-
tional relief department of the strike committee. A
corps of relief collectors and organizers should be put
in the ﬁeld by the national relief organization. Depots
should be established in all important centers for the
collection of cash, food and other strike supplies. Na?
tional and local relief conferences ought to be held
wherever practical. There can be drawn into the relief
collection Work not only trade, unions, but also churches,
Y.M.C.A.’s, Negro organizations, fraternal societies,
farmers’ unions, Veterans’ organizations, cooperatives,

4-2

 

 

unemployed workers’ organizations and workers’ po-
litical parties. i

The distribution side of the relief is to be handled
by special relief committees of strikers in the strike
areas, under supervision of their respective strike com—
mittees. The relief committees require sub—committees
to investigate needy cases and to check up generally on
the distribution of relief. In this sphere, the strikers’
womenfolk can do very important work.

At the outset of the strike all efforts should be made
to get the strikers on the home relief lists upon the
same basis as the unemployed. This can be accomplished
in many places with the proper political mass pressure.

Inasmuch as regular strike beneﬁts could not, in all
probability, be paid in a national 1937 strike of steel
Workers, the strike relief necessarily takes three major
forms: (a) distribution of cash for the strikers’ special
expenses; (b) common kitchens Where food is pre—
pared for the strikers and their families, with special
food for the smaller children 5 (4) commissaries from
which families may carry home groceries, clothing and
other strike relief supplies.

Money. The organizations forming the C.I.O. should
place upon themselves heavy strike assessments. Other
unions should adopt voluntary assessments. This ﬁn-
ancial income should be supplemented by tag days, shop
collections, social affairs, special milk funds, etc., or-
ganized by the strike committees in the various centers.

F ood. Great concentration must be made upon the

. collection of non-perishable foods by the strike com—

mittees, house—to—house collections being organized.
Special attention should be given to collecting strike
43

 

 

 

relief supplies in the immediate strikeareas and sur-
rounding territories. The farmers provide a rich source
for food collection in such big strikes and their organ—
izations need to be contacted.

Shelter. This is always a great problem in large
strikes. It must be attacked in a Variety of ways: by
doubling up the evicted families with others, by mora—
toriums in rent paying in strike—bound towns, by ex-

tension of credit to strikers by landlords, by court action’

and mass pressure to prevent evictions, etc. Where
company towns exist, tent colonies and barracks may be
necessary to take care of the wholesale evictions. The
shutting off of gas, electricity and water can often be
stopped by exerting political pressure upon the local
authorities. In some instances cash is necessary to meet
rent, water, light and similar expenses.

Clothing. Systematic collections of all kinds of cloth-
ing should be made by the relief committees all over
the country. Local clothing repair units can be estab-
lished in the strike towns by sympathetic Women and
tailors. Cobblers should be organized to take care of
shoe repairs, etc.

Medical Aid. In every strike center medical units of
voluntary doctors, dentists, nurses, etc., should be estab-
lished. Medical units also may be organized outside
and sent into the strike areas by the relief committees.
In addition, there should be committees of outside doc-
tors to visit and to give publicity on conditions in the
strike districts. ' A

Relief collection and distribution must be handled
basically as a political question, not as a matter of char-
ity. In the strike districts, strike relief should be so

4-4-

 

organized as to stimulate mass picketing, each picketer
being furnished with a card which is punched to indi-
cate the amount of picketing he has done. The collection
of relief in the various cities should be utilized to arouse
the class—conscious solidarity of the workers and to
draw the broadest masses of workers into active support
of the strike. The Whole relief apparatus, collection and
distribution, must be utilized to popularize the objec-
tives of the strike, to prevent the recruitment of strike-
breakers, to defend the strikers’ civil rights, and to
bring pressure to bear upon the employers and the gov-
ernment for a favorable settlement of the strike. A
Well—organized relief system can exert a tremendous
force in strengthening the strike, both economically and
politically.
Strike -Defense

In every strike the question of defending the civil
rights and personal safety of the strikers and the union
leaders constitutes an important problem. Especially is
this problem acute in a_ great strike against the lawless
and Violent steel barons. Defense activities are not only
a matter of court action, but especially of mass pressure
of the strikers and the widest possible masses of strike
sympathizers against the government and the employ-
ers. The national strike committee requires a legal de-
partment Which organizes this branch of strike work.
Here the International Labor Defense can also play an
important part. A staff of Voluntary attorneys should be

' recruited nationally and in the respective strike areas.

Attacks on the civil rights of the strikers by the em-
ployers, in whatever manner, must be militantly re—

45

 

sisted. All the forces of the strikers, the outside labor
movement, the strike relief organization and the sym-.
pathetic masses generally should be mobilized to protest
against such attacks on the democratic’ rights of the
workers, through the holding of mass meetings, sending
of delegations to the state legislatures and Congress.
When injunctions are issued forbidding the right of
free speech and assembly, the strikers should follow the
traditional American trade union policy of ignoring such
court orders. When troops are brought into a strike area
the strikers must not only ﬁrmly insist upon the main-
tenance of their civil rights, but also know how to fra-
ternize with the soldiers and thus Win as many as
possible of them to the side of the strike.

Vigilant protection must be constantly given to the
persons of the strikers and their leaders; When either
striker or leader is arrested for strike activities, he
should be promptly defended legally and politically.
Where there is danger of violent attacks upon the
strikers’ meetings or upon their leaders _by gunmen and
vigilantes, these meetings and leaders must be person-
ally defended, such protective measures being organ-
ized by the picket committee and being especially the
task of the youth. Against the company-controlled vio-
lators of civil rights and for the personal safety of
strikers and leaders the strikers should make active use
of all available political institutions, including the arrest
and prosecution of the armed thugs; the securing of in-
junctions against the violators of the Workers’ civil
rights, the removal, impeachment and election defeat of
lawless city and state oﬂicials.

46

 

 

 

 

Mobilizing the Strike Reserves

Every good general understands that a basic part of
his strategy is carefully to mobilize and utilize his re—
serves, and the need to do this is no less acute in a
strike, especially in the case of a great strike in steel and
allied industries. Such a strike would for the outset
have Vast potential reserves, created by the profound
sympathy the strike would awaken in the toiling masses.
These masses would realize that not only were the
strikers’ interests involved in the struggle, but also their
own living standards and democratic rights. The strike
leadership must know how to organize and make the
maximum use of this favorable mass sentiment of these
great reserves. Usually, this kind of Work, like the
various other tasks that go to make up a strong strike,

are grossly neglected in A. F. of L. strikes. Such must

not happen in the steel strike, for We may be sure that
the steel trust will mobilize every reactionary inﬂuence
in the United States behind its cause and the workers
will need every possible ounce of support for theirs.
The question of mobilizing the reserves of a national
steel strike involves not only developing the solidarity
of the workers’ main forces directly—-the support of
the unorganized masses of workers, of the members of
company unions, of the unemployed, of the non-striking
trade unions, of workers’ cooperatives and of the work-
ers’ political parties—-but also the mobilization of the
huge masses of semi—proletarian and petty bourgeois
sympathizers who are actively interested in the Winning

it of the strike. This necessitates the development of

united front committees of youth clubs, fraternal socie-
ties, churches, peace movements, professional guilds,

47"

 

 

   

Women’s clubs, Negro organizations, farmers’ cooper-
atives, veterans’ associations, etc., for various strike
tasks.

In the preceding pages I have sketched concretely
some of the Ways in Which these very vital petty bour-
geois and semi—proletarian strike reserves can be util-
ized, including their participation in publicity work,
technical aid for strikers, defense and relief activities
and general political work. To facilitate the mobiliza-
tion of these reserves, a national citizens’ committee,
comprising such liberal strike sympathizers——including
politicians, educators, scientists, Writers, artists, etc.—
should be set up at the commencement of the strike.
This liberal committee must Work closely with the na—
tional strike committee in political activities in support
of the strike, and should stimulate the formation of
local relief committees of liberal strike sympathizers.
Especially in the strike areas is it necessary to build up
similar strike citizens’ committees of professionals, small
businessmen, clergymen, white collar Workers, office-
holders and representatives of Various mass organiza-
tions, to offset the strikebreaking activities of the ever-
present and dangerous citizens’ committees organized by
the employers. A national strike in steel and allied in-

dustries must be made a great rallying issue for the .

major massing of the democratic forces of the United
States to win the struggle.

CHAPTER FOUR

CONSOLIDATING TI-IE
VICTORY

'1' IS a fundamental principle of strategy, whether
I military or labor, to follow up the victory by

pushing back the enemy on every front and to cap-
ture all possible of his strongholds. In the months ahead
the C.I.O. leaders, as well as the progressive forces
generally of the labor movement, must give this stra-
tegic principle serious consideration.

Lenin once wisely remarked that we never can have
real victory unless we also know how to retreat when
need be. A good general always bears this thought in
mind. In this situation, however, there need be no per-
spective of retreat. The strategy must be based on the
offensive, and animated by a spirit of daring and in-
domitability. The stage is all set for a great labor vic—
tory, provided only that the trade union leadership rises
to the occasion, to the height of its tasks. This victory,
which can be so readily won, must be realized to the
full in all its possibilities and implications. In the ﬁrst
chapter of this pamphlet I indicated the great impor-
tance to the working class of a victory in the steel in-
dustry. Now let us look at this whole matter 'a little
more concretely.

Organizing the Millions of Unorgctnized

I I When, early in 1936, the workers of France, ﬁghting
against the rising menace of fascism and organized in

49

 

 

0 

them, it is true, brought a measure of relief to the steel
workers, such as the great 1919 strike which abolished
the 12-hour day and seven—day week and established
generally improved conditions. All of them drove the
iron of class bitterness deep into the steel workers’
hearts, but none of them resulted in establishing a solid
organization in the steel industry.

The ever—present enemy combination of the power-
ful steel trust and the hostile capitalist government,
aided by the maneuvers of dishonest A. F. of L. labor
leaders, was always too much for the steel workers. But
now the steel workers, with better leadership and or-
ganization, are mobilizing their forces for a new strug-
gle, for a fresh attempt to secure relief from the out-
rageous tyranny and exploitation in their industry. The
Committee for Industrial Organization, comprising 15
unions with a total of some 1,500,000 members and
headed by John L. Lewis, the aggressive president of
the United Mine Workers of America, is going ahead
with determination to organize the half million workers
in the great steel industry. The ﬁeld leader of the work
is Phillip Murray, chief of the Steel Workers Organiz-
ing Committee (S.W.O.C.) and vice-president of the
U.M.W.A. ‘

A Favorable Outlook

Many factors combine to make the present situation

, Very favorable for the success of the C.I.O. campaign.

First, the steel workers, like the great body of Ameri-
can workers generally, are in a highly militant mood
and are determined to force concessions from their em-
ployers. They are especially strengthened in their new

5

V ‘ ‘ ,, ,.'

 

a great united front of Radicals, Socialists and Commu-
nists, defeated the reactionary forces and elected the
present Popular Front government, one of the after-
maths of their victory was that within a year the French
trade union movement increased its membership from
some 1,500,000 to over 5,000,000. This is about
equivalent to the American trade union movement (con-
sidering the differences in size and industrialization of
France and the United States), leaping up from its
present low ﬁgure of about 3,500,000 to a membership
of 15,000,000 or 20,000,000. A victory in steel in the
United States, if properly followed up, would un-
doubtedly give a tremendous stimulation to trade union
organization in general in this country. It is a question
whether there will.be as great an advance as that which
followed the victory of the Popular Front government
in France. But certainly success in the steel industry
would throw the door wide open for the organization
of many millions of workers. The extent to which the
possibilities of the situation will be realized will de-
pend largely upon the ability and farsightedness shown
by the trade union leadership.

Even in the very favorable situation after a great
victory in steel, the organization of these millions of
workers can only happen in the fullest measure if the
progressive forces everywhere in the trade union move-
ment make the task of organizing the unorganized all
labor’s ﬁrst order of business. Determined drives must
be made to begin the unionization of the huge masses
of unorganized in all ﬁelds, the millions of general
metal and electrical workers; the mass of textile work-

50

 

 

ers,_the army of truck, bus and taxi drivers, the great
numbers of unorganized packing house, metal mining,
building trades, food workers, lumber workers, agri-
cultural workers, etc., as well as those in the auto, rub-
ber, aluminum, oil, glass and other industries now being
organized by the C.I.O. Nor should there be forgotten
the masses of white collar workers, teachers, technicians,
oﬂ-ice Workers and government employes, who are in-
creasingly ready for organization.

Big inroads by the trade unions into these great un-
organized millions can be made by the labor movement
if the work is gone about with system and’ decision.
Every branch of organized labor must take up the

- organization work. The C.I.O. should seize upon the

event of a victory in steel to redouble its own «efforts
to organize the mass production industries and to stim-
ulate all sections of the labor movement into the greatest
organizing campaign in the history of American labor.
The reactionary A. F. of L. Executive Council must be
compelled by mass pressure to support the growing
organizing campaigns, -or at least not to sabotage them.

‘ Every international union, state federation of labor,

city central body and local union should begin organ-
izing Work in its respective sphere. The whole labor
movement must surge with organization work. This is
the ﬁrst task in consolidating a steel victory, by register-
ing it in the fundamental ﬁeld of organization among
the unorganized millions. If this task of organization is

well conceived and properly carried out, it will mean »

incomparably more power and militancy for the labor
movement in this country.

51

 

 

 

Reorganize the Trade Unions

The organization of steel and other mass production
industries, With its establishment of the principle of in-
dustrial unionism and its smashing victory over com-
pany unionism, its bringing of millions of unskilled and
semi~skilled workers into the unions and its giving rise
to a militant and union progressive leadership in these
industries, would necessarily have profound elfects upon
the whole trade union movement in many directions.
It would lay the basis for a far—reaching revamping of
organized labor’s policies, structure, leadership and gen-
eral outlook. It would provide the workers with a splen-
did opportunity to free themselves ﬁnally from the
mess of reaction and crookedness that has marked A. F.
of L. oﬂicialdom for many years past. To consolidate the
victory in steel especially requires that it register itself
in full force in this sphere by a profound reorganiza-
tion of the trade union movement as a whole.

The further substantial advance of the trade union
movement in this country necessitates breaking the con-
trol of the Greens, Wolls, Hutchesons, Ryans, Freys
and the other top misleaders of labor, together with that
of their local understrapper gangsters, racketeers and
small—time reactionary bureaucrats. These people have
stood in the way of the workers’ progress all too long,
drawing their enormous salaries and shamelessly play-
ing the game of the bosses. More and more the workers
are evidencing a disposition to get rid of them, as is
shown in such recent elections as those among the New
York painters, teamsters and longshoremen. and in many
other places. And with a real victory in steel, this ten-

5 2

 

 

 

dency would be enormously strengthened. The workers,
if given proper leadership, will be ready to make a
grand sweep of the whole reactionary crew that now
dominates so many trade unions.

The trade unions must also break ﬁnally with their
reactionary top A. F. of L. oﬂicials’ traditional policy
of class collaboration, and begin to orientate towards a
policy of class struggle. Fifty years of bitter experience
teaches that class collaboration, based upon the false
principle of the harmony of the interests of capital and
labor, has nothing but defeat to offer the workers. The
workers can gain nothing by their oﬂicials wheedling
the bosses and adapting the unions to the latter’s needs.
They can only go forward by a policy of struggle. The
workers can win only what they have the power and
determination to ﬁght for. It is high time that the trade
union oﬂicialdom was jarred loose from the bosses’
apron—strings. For the ﬁrst time in its history the Amer-
ican trade union movement will stand on its own legs,
both in the economic and the political struggle.

A further Vital part of the necessary reorganization
of the l.abor movement is that the trade unions must be
thoroughly democratized. The workers should put a
ﬁnal end to present baneful conditions of national
unions that never meet in convention, local unions that
go on for years without holding meetings, stolen trade
union elections; oﬂicials self-elected for life, expulsion
of workers because of their political opinions, unions
controlled by notorious racketeers, trade union agree-
ments adopted without rank—and—ﬁle sanction; corrupt
leaders furnishing union—card strikebreakers to employ—

53

 

 V -,:

 

   

ers; open deﬁance of majority rule by union oﬂicials;
union conventions comprised almost entirely of paid
oﬂicials, etc., etc. The present forward surge of the
Workers, especially in the event of a victory in steel, is
just the time to deal a mortal blow to this Whole poison—
ous system of autocracy and corruption that has cursed
the American labor movement for so many years.

The badly needed reorganization of the trade union -

movement should also result in placing not only the
unions in the mass production industries upon an in—
dustrial union basis, but the craft unions generally as
Well. Steps ought to be taken in every industry Where
the craft unions are established to gradually consolidate
them into industrial unions through a process of closer
cooperation, federation and amalgamation. Practical ﬁrst
steps towards this industrialgoal are: one general na—
tional agreement for all railroad trades and a strength-
ening of the railroad federation movement by including
all of the t'Wenty—one railroad unions; uniform agree-
ments in the building trades to expire on the same date;
amalgamation of the metal trades into one industrial
union, formation of a national maritime federation on
the Paciﬁc Coast model 5 organization of a general trans-
port Workers’ federation; creation of a federation of the
needle trade unions; closer affiliation of the printing
trades; federation of the food trades unions, etc. A Vic-
tory in steel and in other mass production industries
would greatly facilitate this advance of the craft unions
generally towards industrial unionism. Craft unionism,
a product of the horse—and—buggy age, was obsolete 30
years ago and it is a heavy drag on the progress of the

54

 

 

 

working class. It must be superseded by a modern,
eifective system of industrial unionism in all industries.

Reunite the American Federation of Labor

The present split in the A. F. of L. is a menace to
the interests of every worker in this country. It leads
to a weakening of the organizing campaign in the mass
production industries; it causes craft union strikebreak—
ing during strikes of the industrial unions (auto, radio,
etc.); it divides labor’s forces politically, and it weakens
the working class on every front.

The split is the rotten fruit of the reactionary Green
bureaucracy Which, fearing that the organization of
the millions of unorganized, semi—skilled and unskilled
will jeopardize its rich sinecures, have gone even to the
extent of splitting the labor movement in order to pre-
vent the organization of the unorganized and to main-
tain its own worse than useless leadership. It traitorously
and illegally suspended C.I.O. unions with over
1,250,000 members, simply because the latter seriously
undertook the organization Work in the mass production

industries that the A. F. of L. Executive Council has.

stubbornly refused to do. No one but the employers
and a handful of reactionary trade union leaders proﬁt
from such a shameful spectacle. The breach in the
ranks of labor must be healed. The present situation,
and especially if the steel workers are victorious, offers
a splendid opportunity for the progressive forces of
labor to mend the split in the A. F. of L. on a sound,
progressive basis.

It is necessary ﬁrst of all to prevent the present split

55

 

   

from spreading. The Workers must refuse to unseat
C.I.O. union delegates in the state lfederations‘ and
central labor unions if ordered to do so by the A. F. of
L. Executive Council. They must hold intact the labor
movement at the bottom, even if it is split at the top.
There must also be no splitting of international unions;
Wherever the question of aﬂiliation to the C.I.O. or A.
F. of L. develops, the principle of majority rule must
prevail in all such cases. It is important also that the
C.I.O. retain its present status as a national committee to
carry on organization work in the basic industries, as
this will prevent the reactionaries from spreading the
split into all sections of the labor movement, as they
would do if two rival national labor federations faced
each other. Meanwhile, While putting these emergency
measures into effect, a unity campaign must be carried
on far and wide throughout the Whole trade union
movement, to Win as many as possible of the trade
unions to condemn the splitting policy of the A. F. of
L. Executive Council and to give active support to the
organization Work of the C.I.O. Especially must the
local A. F. of L. craft unions stand solid With the
C.I.O. industrial unions and vice versa in the case of
strikes, and under no circumstances permit their mem—
bers to Work when strikes are in progress.

The C.I.O. is based upon the most fundamental sec-
tions of the proletariat, those in the heavy, mass pro-
duction industries. It is doing incomparably more vital
and important work than the reactionary’ Executive
Council of the A. F. of L. The latter is a brake on the
labor movement, While the C.I.O. is carrying on the

56

 

 

most fundamental work of organization and stimulating
labor’s progress generally. The C.I.O. already clearly
has the backing of an overwhelming majority of the
organized trade unionists, as well as of great masses of
the unorganized Workers. And as its work of organiza-
tion proceeds the mass support of the C.I.O. will in-
crease by leaps and bounds in all sections of the work-
ing class.

It is most vitally important that the C.I.O. organize
this Vast supporting sentiment in the craft unions, so that
these progressive forces, united ona sound program of
industrial unionism and the organization of the unor-
ganized, can break once and for all the deadly grip of
the Executive Council reactionaries on the labor move-
ment and throw their full strength into organization
work. In the present circumstances the victory over these
reactionaries will not be too difﬁcult, if the C.I.O. will
give more attention to this matter and take more active
steps to organize the progressive forces throughout the
labor movement.

Under the consequent heavy pressure, the machine of
the Greens, Wolls and other reactionaries in the craft
unions would soon collapse and the progressives secure
the leadership of the labor movement. And in the pro-
cess the unity of labor could be re-estab.lished, despite
the reactionary opposition. The present great surge for-
ward of the masses, especially in the event of a victory
in steel, must result in uniting the forces of labor———A
F. of L. craft unions, C.I.O. industrial unions, railroad
brotherhoods and millions of unorganized workers-—
into a great united, progressive A. F. of L. based upon
industrial unionism.

57

A victory in steel, with its resultant mass enthusiasm
I and increased ﬁghting spirit, must especially be utilized
5 to strengthen the workers politically. It is disastrous
E folly for the workers to support and depend upon the
_+ _ old political parties. This is true also of the present
 administration. The Roosevelt government is a capi——
f talist government and will of its own volition do noth— s
l ing to infringe upon the real interests of the great ﬁn-
’ ancial rulers of the country, nor has it done so in the
past. All the real concessions that the workers will get
from the present government is what they have the
organized power and good sense to ﬁght for. The work-
ers and other toilers must have their own political party
and program and give them strong mass support.
The next months should see great political activity on
the part of the workers, farmers, and lower middle
class elements. In conferences and meetings they should
map out united front programs of state and national
legislative demands and then give them the solid back»-
ing of all their trade unions, farmers’ organizations,
progressive blocs in Congress and state legislatures, and
of the workers’ and farmers’ political parties. Mean-
while, they should' also systematically set up local and
state Farmer—Labor Parties, wherever there is a suﬂ'i—
cient mass basis. This whole developing political move-
ment should go in the direction of the formation, as
soon as possible, of a great national Farmer-Labor Par— A
ty, the beginning of a broad People’s Front in the i
United States, to wage struggle against the growing
menace of hunger, fascism and War.
Clearly, the C.I.O. has a heavy responsibility to fur-

58

 

ther this progressive political Work. The reactionary
A. F. of L. leaders have refused to develop independent
political action by the workers _and they know no other
political policy than to keep the masses enchained to the
Republican and Democratic Parties. It is highly dan-
gerous further to neglect building a great Farmer-
Labor Party of the toiling masses. These masses are
more and more showing signs of breaking with the two
old parties, and if organized labor does not give them
the lead with a new party, they are exposed to the
serious danger of falling under the control of such
demagogues and fascists as Hearst, Coughlin, Smith,
Lemke, Townsend, etc. The organization of the work-
ers in the mass production industries, and particularly
if there is a victory in steel, will lay suﬁiciently broad
foundations fora great_ Farmer—Labor Party in the
United States and otherwise facilitate its development.
History thrusts upon the C.I.O. the responsibility of
bringing such a party into actual being.

The Struggle for World Peace

With the great strengthening of the trade union
movement in numbers, program, leadership and class
consciousness that will come from the organization of
the workers in steel and other basic industries the trade
union movement of this country must take a more pos-
itive part in the struggle to maintain world peace and
democracy. The world is facing the War threats and
tyranny of the fascist aggressors, the Hitlers, Musso~
linis, Francos, etc., and more and more the democratic
forces of the World, with the Soviet Union at their head,
are organizing to prevent these fascist barbarians from

59

 

- morale by the defeat of Landon in the 1936 elections,

and they feel a new sense» of confidence and power.

Second, conditions in the industry are on the up-
grade from an economic standpoint and are favorable
for a drive to organization. Besides, the steel bosses
are somewhat on the defensive after their big election
defeat.

Third, the Roosevelt government is deeply obligated
to labor and even if it will take no active steps to organ-
ize the steel workers, it will probably not deﬁnitely op-
pose it, as so many administrations have strenuously
done in the past.

Fourth, another favorable factor is that for the first
time a substantial section of organized labor, the C.I.O.,

' realizes the vital importance of organizing steel and is
pushing forward energetically toward its accomplish—_

ment. The drive also has the support of the Communist
Party,iand other militant and progressive forces.

Fifth, the organization drive is proceeding on the ad-
vantageous basis of uniting all the steel workers into one
industrial union, the A.A., instead of into a couple of
dozen disunited, squabbling craft unions as in previous
campaigns.

A Huge Strike in the Making

The drive of the steel workers for trade union organi-
zation will almost certainly result in a big strike, prob-
ably the greatest this country has ever known. It goes
without saying that the steel workers will do every-
thing possible to secure their demands without such
a struggle; for they well know the toll of suifering that
that they have to pay in all great strikes. But they

deluging the World with a new and more terrible blood-
bath. The American workers must do their share, side
by side with the democratic masses of other countries,
to hold back this threatening slaughter and to defend
the Very existence of civilization itself.

The A. F. of L. policy of non—participation in World
affairs is fatally wrong. Despite the sophistries of Presi-
dent Roosevelt, William Green, Norman Thomas, and
a host of others, there can be no neutrality for the
United States in the war that the fascists are now so
busily preparing. The whole world will be drawn into
the slaughter if and when it comes. The only way Amer-
ica can keep out of war is by keeping war out of the
world. At all costs, the American workers must help
stop the approaching war by supporting the policy of
collective security against the fascist aggressors. We
must give active aid to the brave Spanish Workers and

. peasants who are now struggling heroically against the

fascist butchers 5 we must support militantly the peace
program of the Soviet Union, we must re—aﬂiliate the
American trade unions to the Amsterdam Trade Union
International, we must connect up our own forces with
the anti—fascist ﬁghters for peace in every country. And
all these measures must be backed up by a powerful
united front peace movement in this country, consisting
of trade unions, farmers’ organizations, professionals’
associations, youth organizations, peace societies, wom-
en’s clubs, religious bodies, local Farmer—Labor Parties,
Socialist Party, Communist Party, etc. As a mass pro-
gressive force the C.I.O. has the responsible task to
draw the great body of trade. unionists into this vital
struggle for peace.

60

Role of the C.I.O.

The C.I.O., led so aggressively by John L. Lewis,
is doing a historically important thing in carrying on its
vigorous campaign to organize the armies of exploited
workers in the mass production industries. As we have
seen, this campaign has within it possibilities for a fun—-
damental strengthening and reorganization of the whole
American labor movement. Thus the C.I.O. has be—
come the actual leader of the trade union movement.

The Executive Council of the A. F. of L. has shown .

itself opposed to this vital organization work and be-»
cause of its narrow craft union and personal interests
has refused for many years past to do the organizing
that the C.I.O. is now undertaking. Had it so desired,
the A. F. of L. could have easily organized the steel
workers during the war, or during the Coolidge period
of prosperity, or during the strike upheavals under the
N.R.A. in 1933-1934. But the A. F. of L. wanted
nothing to do with the organization of the steel workers.
And worse yet, now that the C.I.O. unions, which are
awake to the basic importance of this task to themselves
and to all other workers, are proceeding to accomplish
the organizing work that the Executive Council has so
long neglected or prevented, the Executive Council
actually suspends them, one—third of the whole labor
movement, from the A. F. of L., and thus traitorously
splits labor’s forces in the face of the enemy. Never,
even in the shady history of the A. F. of L., has mis—
leadership sunk to lower levels. The A. F. of L. Exec-

utive Council has surrendered the true leadership of the

trade unions into the hands of the C.I.O.
  61 3

 

The Communist Party heartily supports the C.I.O.
organizing campaigns in the steel, automobile, rubber,
glass, textile, oil, etc., industries, and it mobilizes all its
forces to assist in this work. It extends this aid for the
same reason that it supports every forward movement
of the workers wherever it may originate or what form

it may take, whether it be a strike, an organization cam?‘

paign, the carrying on of independent working class po-
litical ,actiVity, or what not. The Communist Party has
no interests apart from those of the working class, and
every Victory of the workers is a victory for the Com-
munist Party. But in supporting the C.I.O.’s organizing
work the Communist Party does not fail to point out
constructively and in a friendly spirit whatever it may
consider to be Weaknesses in that work, such as the in-
suiﬁcient mobilization of the progressives in the craft
unions to support the C.I.O.’s position, hesitancy in
using more aggressive methods of mass organization
work, underestimation of trade union democracy, failure
to raise the question of industrial unionism regarding
the craft unions themselves and insuﬂicient orientation
towards the formation of a national Farmer-Labor
Party. Also the Communist Party, with its revolution~
ary program, looks far beyond the perspective of the
C.I.O. It aims at the abolition of the capitalist system
and the complete liquidation of the exploitation of man

‘ by man through the private ownership of industry and

the land, by the establishment of socialism.

The C.I.O. has done very good Work up to date, but
its biggest tasks still remain ahead. There is to be
accomplished not only the successful completion of the

62

 

 

O-

 

organization drives in steel, auto, etc., but also, as I
have pointed out, the broad tasks of consolidating the
victory, that is, of realizing the full economic and
political possibilities of the C.I.O. movement, including
the extension of the organization Work far and Wide in
industry generally; the re-establishment of a uniﬁed
and democratized A. F. of L. based on industrial
unionism and a class struggle policy and with a progres-
sive leadership; the foundation of a great united
front Farmer—Labor Party as the beginning of an
American People’s Front 5 the building up of a broad
peace movement, etc. These tasks confronting the
‘C.I.O. amount, in sum, to a veritable renaissance of the
whole American trade union movement.

John L. Lewis and other C.I.O. leaders, although.

having a very conservative background, have shown a
real spirit of progress in the development of the C.I.O.
movement. Their progressive advance was a most ex-
traordinary development to take place in the ranks of
the reactionary A. F. of L. trade union leadership. And
to accomplish the historic tasks of the great forward
development of which they stand at the head, new tests
will be made of their responsiveness to the masses’
needs. To realize in full the implications and possibilities
of the situation they Will have to display the broadest
vision and livest progressivism. They have in their
hands the opportunity to do a most fundamental service
to the Working class, not only of America, but of the
Whole World. A

probably will have no choice in the matter, as the arro-
gant steel kings will most surely force a strike. They‘
will never concede the Workers’ elementary demands
for the right to organize, better wages, shorter hours,
improved working and living conditions, etc., without
making every form of resistance they can under the
given circumstances. They made this quite clear at the
very outset of the steel organizing campaign in the
middle of 1936, when the American Iron and Steel In—
stitute, the central organization of the steel magnates,.
declared in a statement published simultaneously in
375 national full—page newspaper advertisements at a
cost of $500,000 that the steel corporations were deter-
mined to resist at all costs the organization of the steel‘
industry. The militancy of the automobile kings and

 

coal barons, closely allied with the steel magnates, also '

illustrates the employers’ determination to ﬁght to save
the open shop. -

Nor can the Roosevelt government be counted upon
to prevent the strike by forcing the steel trust to estab-
lish human standards in their industry. What is devel->

oping is a head—on collision between the steel trust and.

their long—oppressed Workers. Unless all signs fail, the
great steel strike of 1919 Was only a dress-rehearsal for
the big battle that is looming up in 1937.

The Vital Issues at Stake

The successful outcome of the present organization
campaign in the steel industry will have Wide economic,
political and social repercussions. It will far outrun in

signiﬁcance the building up of the Amalgamated As--'

sociation into a powerful union of 500,000 workers, im-

portant though this objective may be. It will constitute V

a great Victory of the whole working class over the open
shop policy of American ﬁnance capital and it will deal
a shattering blow to company unionism in all industries.
It will give an enormous stimulus to trade union organi-
zation, both in the mass production industries and
throughout industry generally. In 1919 already we
understood that a victory of the great steel strike would
open the doors for organization in many industries, but
now the unionizing possibilities of such a victory are
far greater. It would prepare the way for the organi-
zation of many millions of workers and would institute
a radical improvement in wages and working conditions
throughout American industry.

Victory in steel would also have profound effects
upon the trade union movement as a whole. It would
deﬁnitely establish the principle of industrial unionism,
not only in the mass production industries, but aid also
the reorganization of all trade unions upon an industrial
basis. It would lay the basis for a new and progressive
leadership in the A. F. of L. and would undermine the
paralyzing policies and corrupt regime of, the present
clique of reactionaries who have long been a stumbling
block to the American Working class. A successful out-
come of the steel drive would so strengthen the hands
of the progressive elements in the trade unions that
they would be able to carry through the reuniﬁcation
of the A. F. of L. in spite of the policy of the Greens,
Wolls, Hutchesons, Freys, Whartons and other labor
reactionaries to split the movement.

The success of the steel campaign would also great-
ly push labor forward politically. Not only would the
broad mass movement that must develop around the
organization of steel result in making the 30-hour
week, adequate unemployment relief, genuine social
security, abolition of industrial spy systems, elimina-
tion of strikebreaking detective agencies, and many
other demands of the workers, active political issues
that would have to be granted by the employers and the
government, but it would also further the political or-
ganization of the workers. The workers’ class conscious-
ness would be aroused, and volume and speed would be
given to the movement for a Farmer—Labor Party and
the eventual development of the People’s Front in the
United States. Nor could such popular advances in the
United States fail to have favorable effects upon the
world struggle of the toiling masses in defense of de-
mocracy and against hunger, fascism and war. .

On the other hand, a defeat for the workers in the
present effort to organize the steel industry would be
a most serious setback to labor generally; The after-
elfects of the 1919 steel strike defeat were disastrous
for organized labor as a whole, and a defeat of the steel
workers now would be a worseblow and would give a
great stimulus to reaction and fascism in the United
States. Such a defeat must be avoided at all costs. Vic-
tory for the steel Workers must and can be achieved if
the struggle is carried through aggressively and with
the systematic mobilization of all of labor’s available
forces. -

The bosses know full well the possibilities and im- -
