MILL HUNK
HERALD

You may be wondering what the
hell this is all about. ‘Here's our
best shot at an explanation:

What it is: A newspaper, monthly to
start, for the reports, opinions and.
stories of the average person. A
newspaper operated democratically,
independendently, uncensored and
upfront.

What it is not: Profit making

Owned by anybody

Operated from the top down

Ass kissing

The Pittsburgh Press

The Name: (catchy ain't it?) It was
chosen for that reason. However,
this paper is not just for mill Work-
ers, the title simply acknowledges
the important work they do in Pgh.
This paper is for all‘ working people,

housewives, office employees, retirees. \ ,_. _ _ ,_,§
_ .l-Iere's who paid for this first .fl<

nurses‘, teachers, bus drivers, bar-
tenders-- you name it.‘

Who can write for this paper? Anyone '

can. 35 people contributed 52 art-
icles this time. The goal fo"rxthe _
next time is to double those figures,
that's how it willgrow, multipli--
cation.' There are veryfew "pro-.

fe_§)sional" writers .invd_l'$iéti,.,   ‘
can probably’ tell.’ Fo‘r"th'is kind of , 

paper; polished writing"sty1es. are 
not as ‘crucial as timely and real
things to say. . So, ‘what you write and
how you say it is what will be printed.
Articles won't be messed with except;
for grammer etc. if requested. '
Finally, it is alsoimportant to’
know where people are coming from.
Therefore,. articles must be signed,
with your occupation, and what part
of town you live in, or accompanied
by a brief printable explanation as to
why this must be anonymous. ,
How is it run? Democratically. The
subscribers, not the publishers, will
control the Mill Hunk Herald. For
example, when the paper gets enough

money to pay for an editorial staff
(part-time at first most likely), there
will be an election for these jobs
by the subscribers by mail ballot.
Anyone who has written for the pa-
per will be eligible to run for these
positions. Also, the paper will hold
periodic public meetings (with
parties following) to discuss pro-
blems and new ideas. _Any decisions
made at these meetings must be
ratified (by mail ballot) by the‘ sub-
scribers.

Here are some examples of some
possible decisions:

Example #1 Advertising:

There is none now. (except a lit-
tle free number advertising a lawyer
who often does free labor cases).

But suppose Kaufmann's wanted a full
page ad. The meeting might vote
"yes" but that decision must be rat-
ified (or reversed) by the subscribers
ballot before it can be enacted,
Example #2 Subscription Price It's
$2. 00 a year (not guaranteeing how
many issues, so it is, at this point

a small gamble). Sup_Qo§e the meeting

'v‘oted"to“change the subscription
price? That decision would have to
be ratified or rejected by the sub-
scribers. '

Example #3 Political Stands: There
are none now. But supposing the
meeting voted to back Jack Ham for
President in 1980. That decision
once again must be ratified.

. ciple of, the thing’--it's the money."

Example #4 Censorship: There is.
none now. Suppose someone is writ- -4.‘;
ing consistently obnoxious stuff. The
meeting might vote to censor or
edit the person's material. That
decision would have to be _ratified_
by the subscribers by mail ballot
before it can be made good.

The principle here is dem-
ocracy-—the rule of the clear ma-
jority of who the paper serves"
the subscribers. That's how the _
Mill Hunk Herald is gonna be run.’

know how the working people caused

still paying for today.

Also, you're off base when you
praise v.w. for bringing jobs to
Pennsylvania. This is not a gift,
but a shrewd business move. They
only came here for one reason-
money, lots of it. They'll get it
too, via tax breaks, less shipping
charges, no tariffs, and with your
help, slave labor.-

__ You mentioned that because of the
actions of the v.w. workers;other
industries will take heed and not
build their factories here. well, I
hope so. If they want to pay less

=.money than other areas and harass
‘ with impunity, who needs it? It's

time they learn the worker wants his
fair share. while the company is only
investing his dollar, the worker is
investing his body. This is the age
of not only profit but super profit,
so why can't the worker live a bit
more confortably.

It would be nice to see Pennsyl-
vania workers get at least as much-as
Michigan or Ohio workers in related
fields. It would also be nice to see
the Pittsburgh Press take a worker's
viewpoint in a strike for a change.
Better yet, another paper to give
the Press some competition. A paper
with a blue collar slant, then we'll
see how many Press Papers get deliv-
ered in Hazelwood, Lawrenceville..

and other working class neighborhoods.

J.P. Stevens textile mills in
the South have been trying for
15 years to win the same basic
rights that most Northern in-
.dustrial workers take for granted.
These rights include job security
and seniority, decent wages, ben-
efits and pensions, a contract to
guarantee these and other rights.
Many of J.P. Stevens’ southern
mills sprang up after Stevens
closed most of its Northern
mills which were unionized,
leaving more than ll,0OO
union workers without jobs and
hiring southern workers at lower
wages and with no union contract.

_In the course of the 15-year
‘organizing campaign at J.P. Stevens,
the company has been charged with
unre than 1200 labor law violations.
These_infringements upon-its workers
right to organize have earned for
Stevenseits reputation as "the
number 1 labor law violator" in
the U.S.

J.P. Stevens violations are
‘~ many and varied. For instance,

in small southern towns where
many Stevens mills are located,~
Stevens has had the cooperation
. of other area employers to be‘
* able to effectively--and illeg-
'~ ally--blacklist Stevens workers
fired for union activity. 'And,

The largely student organiza-

chapters, including one at the .Un— ,

Chapter, like all the chapters, is
working actively on a campaign to
oppose the proliferation of nuclear
power stations and on a campaign to
convince the Pitt administration to ~

DICK’S PICKS H7\VE 
BUSINESS TILT , 

With the election of a
new governor, I don't think
it is too much for the voters g
to expect new and reliable peo-
ple in Gov.-elect Dick Thorn- ' E
burgh's cabinet. But it seems
that some of the nominees lean
to industries and utilities, as
well as politics.

In the case of Helen 0'Ban-
non, all she ever did, as a mem-
ber of the Public Utility Com-
mission, was to get increases in
utility rates. She was always
more concerned about how the
‘stockholders would react than
the way it affected small con-
sumers.

I'am not condemning all of
the nominations. I am sure that
some or most of them are OK. ;

   
        

I hope that more people '
will write to their senators to
study these appointees and elim-
inate these people who theythink
will not work for the good of ‘
state and the taxpayers.

.Presjdent Carter is reportedly consi-
dering_the invocation of the Taft.
gHartley Act to force the return of
fabsentee congressmen of both parties
to their seats. . ' ‘
Experts,_however, are predicting
that the president's legislation will
run into trouble in the_House of Rep-
resentatives where it will;WacK*the
support of powerful absentee‘congress—
men. And even if the bill should some-
how pass, it is by no means certain _
that congressmen will obey the back-*

or THE

In any area of life, change is
inevitable. Our society is changing
constantly. And, without a doubt, so
is_the face of the United Steelwork-

' ers. Some perceive the changes,
others do "not. Our Union boasts a
membership of 1.4 million workers. _A
In basic steel alone, there are some

I ' 400, 000 members.

Presently, an attitude of com-
placency rests like a blanket over
much of‘ the. rank and file in basic‘
steel. All of the men who entered
the mill in the post war period of the

late 40's and early 50's are now head.-.

ing for retirement. Within the next-_‘5
to 10 ‘years almost all of them will -3
retire. ~When this happens, the aver-
age age of thexrarik and file in the
mills will drop drastically. The mills
will be saturated with men in their
20's and 30's as new men areﬁhired
toireplace those retired. Obviously, ' '
what they want from their contract
will change. Presently,v.' there is a
heavy emphasis on pensions and

pension benefits. Within the next .-10 

years, the emphasis will switch back
to the paycheck and the man 'witli5f,5;:he

From a small, empty storeroom in
Lawrenceville 60 some odd years
ago, two men started a business for
themselves making stopper heads,
which at the time were in great de-
mand. So a well-made stopper head
brought big orders that could not
be handled by just two men. Being
businessmen, they saw a great
future in the crucible industry.

So the best thing to do was get
a bigger building and hire good
men to increase their production.

After 40 years of production and
a good profit, these two men stepped

‘aside and turned the company over
to a handpicked corporation,
Vesuvius Crucible Company.

ﬁwenty more years and this
corporation has grown into the
largest giant in the crucible
industry, expanding all over the
world with plants in several
foreign countries, being very
careful not to let any union
activity organize at any of the
expansion plants. Now that a
multimillion dollar corporation

v» has been established outside the
original home plant, who needs the
. men from Local 3730 who worked

that it should be followed to the
Nword. The company twists and turns
thése words to their advantage. They
feel that they can do whatever they
"want and nothing should be said about
it.“ - * ‘
This day is done. As long as we

try to violate the éontract for fear

local 1531 rank & file, do not lose
momentum, keep up the good work and

SHUTiDOWN

Since Harch l, '78, the 325 members
of USNA-Local 1406 in Hckecsport have
been on strike against a company
offer that would take away 42 years
of union gains. Their boss, Ft Pitt
Steel Co. insists on:

1. Combining jobs to eliminate

_ over 100 jobs.

2. Contracting out much of the
work in the mill.

The union's demands are for no take-

end, the union offered to go back to
work under the old contract and submit
contracting out and incentive pay to
binding arbitration, but the company
turned this down and locked the doors.
About a month ago, the company ann-
ounced that the plant was closed, but
recently, Ft. Pitt made an offer to
sell the plant to the union for one
dollar. However the company wants the

needs the men that punched the
time clock faithfully day after
day; who needs the men that
.fought heat, sweat and dirt; the
men who helped build a dynasty
in the crucible industry; who
needs them now? .
On October 31, 1976, when

their contract with Local 3730
U.S.W. expired, the men were
offered a contract that in no
way could be accepted: They _
wanted the men to take a re-
duction in hourly wages, to
eliminate cost of living, take
away three paid holidays and
pay only half of any increase
in medical and surgical bene-
fits, no department seniority,
plant management having the right
to place men on different jobs
at their discretion.

After a little more than 2
years on the street and very little
negotiating with the company, the
men of Local 3730 U.S.W.A. still
have faith. Now more than ever
brothers and sisters of all local
unions must draw closer together and
extend the hand of help. _

United we stand, divided-we fall.

right to manage the plant and to sell
finished castings to its other subsid-
aries so they can control distribution.
The union would also have to take over
the comnany's debts. In addition, by
"selling" the plant, Ft. Pitt can get
out of paying severence pay due the
emnloyees- about $650,000. 80, it's
Clear that the company's 31 offer is
nothing more than a media stunt to
turn public opinion against the work-
ers.
| In contrast to the steadfast deter-
Imination of the Local 1406 members to
|oppose attempts to bust their union,
[what has the International really done?
[Out of a 93 million strike fund, the
|§t. Pitt strikers got only the usual
I330 a week. After weeks of leafletting
and discussion about the strike by
rank and filers thruout the valley,
the District finally called a rally
to supnort Local 1406. Although the
rally was a big step forward, it was
too little, too late.

The main way the International sold
out was by keeping the brothers at FT.
Pitt. isolated from other union
members and tied up in endless court
proceedings. The International did
nothing to hit COJDEO (Ft. Pitt's
parent Co.)at its other plant locations
in Ohio, which is the whole purpose of
having an International. Our Internat-
ional ncwspaper, STEEL LABOR, waited
almost a year to publicize the strike.

With the recent events at Heppenst-
alls Steel, Latrobe Steel, Vesuvius
Crucible, and now Ft, Pitt, it is
clear that our great union is under
attack(union busting). We need to
link together big and small shops into
one steel industry collective bargain-
ing unit. If our present “leaders” are
wiable to keen our union stronj, than
the membership will see to it that we

THE RED SCARE
There are very disturb-
ing signs for the Labor hove-
ment as we move into the1980fs
We are faced not only with a
new form of class war fostered
by the "New Right"and cor-
porations and our Union's
leadership inability to fight
back, but now our own leader-
ship is attacking_any dissent
as being fostered by "outside
influences", namely the tried
and true way to bring the
workers in conflict with each
other; "THE RED SCAREP. Yes,
that grand old tactic that de-
stroyed the Industrial Workers
of the World(Wobblies), with
the complete support of the
1:F.ofL. aha Samuel Gompers,
which helped smash the "Big
Steel" strike of 1919, which.
helped prevent the rise of
industrial unionism for over
40 years, and which threw out
some of the strongest and‘
hardest fighting unions in
the C.I.O. during.the McCarthy
era and in the process de-
_stroyed thousands of lives.

'Yes folks. it's back and
with vengance. The only dif-
'ferrence this time is that it
is not the companies who have
started the "Scare" but the
leadership of our own unions.
The people who are supposed to
represent\us! They have been
ensconed in their Ivory towers
and have been patting them-..
selves on the back about what
'a great job they do that_they
cannot comprehend a true up-
surge of discontent and in
psome cases-open'revolt. ‘they
‘think that we are so unedu-
cated and stupid that the only

way that,there could be an
uprising would be because of
"reds" stirring up the happy
and contented workforce. ’ ‘
That-is an old“argu-

ment that has been“used over
and over again throughout the
years. ?irst by the companies,
wanting to keep unions out,
and secondly, by Union of-,
ficials who wanted to keep-
their positions safe from
unionists who would fight
the companies. It has
worked so many times in .
theipast'because'we allowed
it to, but this time we can-
not afford to let happen or
else we are doomed to endless -
servility to the ‘hacks’ who
run our unions.
