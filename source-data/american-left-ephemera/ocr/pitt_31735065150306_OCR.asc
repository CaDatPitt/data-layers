said, “and we cannot affordlto

cal activity by labor unions is a

U. S. SENATOR HUBERT
HUMPHREY (D., Minn.), mem-
ber of the Senate Foreign Rela-

tions committee, praised Ford’s
1 speech as “the kind of realistic,
constructive appraisal of our
present situation that our coun-
try badly needs. I just hope Mr.
Ford’s address, will be carefully
read by President Eisenhower.”

U. S. SENATOR ALLEN J.
ELLENDER (D., La.), ,in his re-

, port about his extensive travels
in Russia and his talks with
hundreds of workers ' there,
said:_ “This curiosity (in the
Russians about everything

a-fertile area in which can be
planted the -seeds of freedom
for Russia. I therefore recom-
mend that, subject to reason-
able security regulations, we

ment’s tangled security setup to workers in.non-sensitive jobs
[has been «re-introduced in Congress by U. S. Senator John Butler,

cials have called it a “long step towards requiring that every‘

. If that ever happens, we will have exchanged the

freedom of American democracy to a tyranny of the police state.”
The Walsh-mgton Post and Times-Herald called the bill “totali-

ta_rian.”

In an editorial, the United Mine Workers Journal said:

“Organized labor -is going to have to be on its toes in the
new Congress to prevent reactionary, anti-labor legislators

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Clark Voices
Sympathy

DENVER——— “Deepest sym-
pathy” on the recent coal
mine disaster at /Bishop, Va.,
was expressed last month by
Mine-Mill President John
Clark in a telegram to United
Mine Workers President John
L. Lewis.

Thirty-seven miners were
killed in a gas —-explosion at
the giant Bishop coal mine.
It was the nation’s worst mine
disaster since 119 miners died

- in a blast at West Frankfort,
Ill., in 1951. About 80 men
were underground at the time,
but the 37 dead apparently
were the only ones in the im-
mediate blast area."

Clark’s telegram expressed
“deepest sympathy of the na-
tion’s metal miners to the
unionbrothers and families
of 37 coal miners who lost
their lives in the shocking
Bishop -disaster.” He pledged
“our cooperation in having
instituted legislation and safe-
ty measures which will end
the slaughter of underground‘
miners.”

a miner at Bunker Hill and
member of Local 18, was found
dead in the snow near his
smashed house about two hours
after the slide came down the
Sierra Nevada Hill at 4 a.m. on
Feb. 5. Mrs. Weaver was
thrown through the air and
landed in a pile of snow near the
stove in the kitchen of Mr. and
Mrs. W. M. Triplett, her ‘neigh-
bors. The Tripletts saw her
arm sticking out of the snow
and pulled her free. She was
taken to the hospital in critical
condition. Mr. and Mrs. Triplett
were uninjured, but their 10-
year-old son was" knocked out
of bed.

Embree on Dec. 15, 1877, in
Newfoundland, the union
veteran was the son of a
Methodist minister, growing
up in Nova Scotia and " New
Brunswick and later migrating
to British Columbia in Western
Canada. He was graduated
from Sackville university in
Nova Scotia as a mining engi-
neer and assayist. *1,’

After‘ his graduation he at-
tempted to make his way to the
Klondike. " He never got there.
He went to work as a miner in
British Columbia, joining the
WFM. He remained a member
of the union the rest of his life.
He was a member of Phoenix
Local No. 8, the same local
through which President John
Clark first joined the union.'He
had also been a member of the
old Greenwood local.

IWW ORGANIZER

Sam had what -the biogra-
phers call “a stormy career” as
a trade unionist. He organized
for the old Industrial Workers
of the World and was sentenced
for four year to the Idaho peni-
tentiary on charges of “criminal
syndicalism,” a favorite open
shoppers? weaponagainst
unions in the early days of or-
ganization. '

He was involved in the his-
toric 1917 box-car deportation of
"union men from the Bisbee,
Ariz., mining camp. For a time
he worked as an organizer in
Nome, Alaska. ’

Among his various union as-
signments was a period as edi-
tor of the union. paper. He was
a’ member of the Big Bill Hay-
wood Defense committee. ,

Brother Embree got ‘ the
name of “Sam” working under-
ground. He told the story of

how a Chinese foreman couldn’t
remember his real name and
told him he would call him
“Sam.” The miners picked it up
and “Sam” he remained for the
rest of. his life.

Sam was a union leader in
the best sense of the word. He
was engaged in countless organ-

izing campaigns and negotia--

tions. In later years he became
ill and _was retired on a union
pension. ,

Sam is survived by his widow,
Lucy MacKenzie Embree,’ whom
he married in 1908 in Green-
wood, B. C. They were child-
hood sweethearts. Also surviv-
ing is a son, William, and a

Ghost‘   Story

(SPECIAL -TO MINE! MILL UNION)

WASHINGTON, D. C.—A
parade of ghosts took the wit-
ness stand early. last week as

hearings opened here before the. 1

Subversive Activities Control
board on the 1955 Brownell-But-
ler‘ petition against . the Mine,
Mill and‘_Smelter Workers.
Conducting the hearings, ex-
pected to last for many months‘,
is Francis Adams Cherry, for-
mer governor of Arkansas.
The first witness called to the

stand by L. E. Broome, repre-

senting Attorney General
Brownell, was Ralph Rasmus-
sen‘, former Mine-Mill vice pres-
ident and long-time payrolleron
the staff of the ‘Steelworkers,
the r ai din g outfit which has
been trying unsuccessfully for
more than a. decade ‘to get a
f o o t h o_ l d in the non-ferrous
metals industry. ‘ .
~ It was Rasmussen who served
as the medium through whom
the dead. men Spoke. He quoted
them to “prove” that Mine-Mill
was “communist.” He was 'still
on the stand when this issue of
the Mine-MillUnion went to
press but hehad already quoted
the late Philip Murray, CIO and
Steelworkers’ president; the late
Ora Wilson, Mine-Mill vice pres-
ident; the late Jess .Gonzales,
one-time District 6 board mem-
her; ‘the late Paul Burns, who
was business agent of Local 50
when he waskilled in an auto
accident in .1941 and the late
Jess Nichols, former Mine-Mill
international representative. ;
It was difficult to say how
long Rasmussen would remain

“on the stand for he- still was

only half-way‘ through the list
of possible dead men who could
no longer refute whathe-.was
saying on‘ the stand.“

There were many discrepan-
cies_ in Rasmussen’s cu r r e nt
testimony and -that which he
gave to the McCarran commit-
tee investigating Mine-Mill in
1952. On cross-examination by
Mine-Mill General Counsel Na-
than,Witt, Rasmussen admitted
he had given “erroneous” testi-
mony about the union to the lVIc-
Carran group. He had an amaz
ing memory for exact dates as
far back as 1937 on. direct ex-

, amination, but on cross exami-

nation he gave the McCarran
hearing date as August, 1954.. It
was in O_ctober;1952... 7' ‘” ' '

Salmon (Idaho) Miners and

Wages at both these proper-
ties have been historically lower
than in the Coeur d’Alene ‘min-
ing district of Idaho. In many
respects other parts of their
agreements have been inferior
to the wages and conditions in
the Coeur d’Alene area. As a
result of the recently concluded

negotiations, they-- are now
fully equal. ‘

The settlements, retroactive
in full .to July 1, 1956 have
brought these Sound three-year
agreements article..- by article
into line with the Bunker Hill
agreement held by Coeur
d’Alene District Union No. 18
in Kellogg, Idaho, and in sever-
al respects are considered by the
locals’ negotiators to have sur-
passed the Bunker Hill agree-
ment. -

Wage raises range from a
,minimum of 14 cents an hour

to a high of 18.9 cents an ’

hour, with the former low
rate increased by_ $1.12 per
shift and the former top rate
increased by $1.51 per shift.
In addition, automatic in-
creases of 6 cents per hour

Empire hotel, February 2 an.d 3, in a District 6 Conference
which many described as the most constructive, confident

and active ever held in the district.

_ ' "The comprehensive two-day meeting of rank and file

leaders covered an agenda

which included discussion of
federal and state legislation,
civil rights, shop problems,
state of the union and a legal
report. Addressing the sessions

was" further enhanced by a so-

SOUTHERN FUND
A highlight of the conference.

-was the presentation to Vice’-

President Howard of more than
$600 in contributions from sev-
eral locals for the Southern

Brother Howard is director. The

" ‘ceremony followed discussion of

the civil rights report made'”by

Vice-"President Larson, con-
_gratulatlng the conference on
its enthusiastic and -optimistic
spirit, outlined the job ahead
for the entire union which, he_
pointed out, includes expa_p-
sion of services, new organi-
zation,’ increasing the union’s
financial stability and defense.

LEGISLATIVE WORK
Almost the entire discussion

York. Reports from Int’l Reps.
Henry Rapuano (Conn.), Al
Petit-Clair (N. J.) and Joe Scioli
(N. Y.) showed that in each case
the Mine-Mill political action
committees were planning their
activity onthe basis of coopera-
tion with AFL and CIO groups
in. support of legislation benefit-
ting labor as well as in opposi-

-tion to. “right-to-work” and other

-anti-labor bills.

- Throughout, the meeting was '
marked by the fullest partici-

Reports ‘from "many of the
delegates on shop problems in
their respective plants pointed
up a developing l/ay-off situation
in brass and an increasing tend-
ency of the companies to get
tough. Conclusions drawn from
the discussionindicated the need
by the locals to sharpen their
approach on grievances in the
shopion a day to day basis and
to press the fight for jobs.

BUFFALO, N. Y.——In a
tightly-reasoned legal opinion
last month, Deanllacob Hyman
of the University__ of Buffalo
Law School ruled in favor of
Mine-Mill in a crucially im-
portant arbitration case in-
volving the layoff of five mem-
bers at age 68 by the American
Brass company, an Anaconda
subsidiary. 9 '

Buffalo Brass and Copper
Workers Union No. 593 and the

tire Anaconda Conference, com-
posed of local unions‘ of sev-
eral affiliations, made the orig-
inal decision to take the case to
arbitration because the other
pension and collective agree-
ments in the Anaconda chain
are exactly the same. It is felt
that the award in the Buffalo
case would have a direct bear-
ing on all of the other opera-
tions.

Dean Hyman ruled that the
company had violated the
discharge clause of the col-
lective agreement by" laying
off the five men at 68 when

sions because they had not

Pressures

 Listed As

Main Reason 9  

"WASHINGTON —- Congress
has begun consideration of the

1 civil rights program requested

by President Eisenhower with
comments from both suppor-
ters and opponents indicating
that ‘the legislation has more
chance of passing this year

,.than at any recent time.

The belief is based on the as-
sessment of the political_ pres-

«sures to support the measure

that members of both parties
will feel when, and if, it comes
to a final floor vote.

In this situation, opposition
strategy dictates an effort to
delay, defeat or weaken the
civil rights measure before it
comes to the floor. ‘The longer
consideration can be prevented,

, the more effective the “ultimate

weapon”—the Senate’ filibuster
—becomes.

In this battle for time, major
roles fall on the House Rules

" committee and the Senate ju-

diciary committee. The chair-
men of both these groups" are

V opposed to the civil rights bills.
SHOUSE RULES COMMITTEE

The House R-ules committee

-acts as a clearing house for

nearly all legislation considered
on the floor. It will determine

' when, and if, a civil rights bill

may be cleared for House floor
action, and whether or not it
may be amended from the floor.
The committee itsel’f"'may not
amend the bill. ’

Chairman» Howard W. Smith

. (D., Va.)' of the‘12-man Rules

committee delayed action ;on
1956 civil rights legislation long
enough to prevent Senate con-
sideration. . , -

Smith, in a Jan. 15, 1957, in-.

it  terview, said the civil rights
, backers “won’t- get anyﬂcomfort

from me.” But despite Smith's,

‘.9;-opposition, there ‘seems’ little

" i.d;oubt the, civil ‘rights bill will

be cleared..by the committee for
floor action. The only change
in the committee’s membership
since 1956’was the substitution
of.Rep. Hugh Scott (R.,"Pa.)
for Ellsworth, who was de-
feated last November. Scott
long has been a leader in the
campaign for civilrights legis-
lation and_voted for passage of
HR 627 while Ellsworth voted
against it July 23, 1956.

Backers of _the civil rights
bill are considering whether to
bring it to the floor under an
open rule, as in 1956, or to try
and obtain from the Rules com-
mittee a closed rule that would
forbid amendments from‘ the
floor. In 1956, 21 amendments
were offered and five of these
were adopted. The most im-
portant of the approved amend-
ments prescribed “rules of fair
procedure” for the Commission
on Civil Rights; ‘it is regarded
by some civil rights backers as
an encumbrance, by others as
an improvement. If, _as seems
likely, an open rule is agreed.
to again in 1957, civil ' rights
backers will face the added
task of keeping enough sup-
porters of the bill on the House
floor during consideration of
the measure to’ defeat what
they regard as “crippling”
amendments. The legis1ation’s
backers argue that the prospect
of amendments under an open
rule must be faced, because
even if a closed rule could be
obtained it would alienate some-
supporters of the bill who
would object to its being “rail-

roaded” through the House un-.

der what sometimes is termed
a “gag rule.” ‘ - ‘*4
SENATE COMMITTEE '

The Senate Judiciary com-
mittee has original jurisdiction

anti-lynching bill -(S 91, 81st
Congress) reported June 6,
1949, was the last civil rights’
bill "cleared for floor action by
the committee. Unlike the

0 _ Further U.S. copper price drops last month raised the

‘’ possibility that the government may soon step into the
 market to help stabilize prices. Two successive decreases,
0 within a two week period, brought'the price down to 32

 jcents—’——14 cents below the 46 cents high of a year ago.
@These decreases followed the downward trend of foreign

   

 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

-  and custom smelter prices.

,  Government officials told
brass industry representa-
tives recently that a drop to
30% cents would automatically
‘raise "government purchases by
from.10,0_0O to 15,000 tons a
month._That is because, under

i_ existing contracts with com-

panies’ that recently developed
‘ newimines, the government is
obligated to buy copper at
about that price if the com-
panies can’t get more on the
_ open ,market. These purchases
' should, at least, help to brake
the price slide. Other measures
-—including a possible renewal
aof buying for the national
stockpile—are also under con-
sideration.
‘ STOPGAPS
These stopgap measures
-will not solve the basic prob-
lem——the growing excess of
supply over demand." World
copper mine production, in
' recent years, has greatly in-
creased but markets for this
increased supply,
._ in the U. S., have not kept
._— ‘pace. That basic problem has
‘ been recently aggravatedhby
production slumps in some
I of the more important cop-
per-using industries—partic-
ularly building construction,
autos, and a_1ppliances._

Last year, the U. S. didn’t
consume, much more copper—
maybe two p-er cent more—than
it ‘did in -1947. Over that same

. period— by contrast—use of

_, aluminum-tin the U. S, increased
by over 300 per cent. A lot of
that ‘aluminum. replaced pre-
Viously used‘ copper; most of it,
‘though,-went ‘into new uses de-
veloped by the aluminum in-
dustry.

New psns LACKING
The copper industry hasn't

developed . an -important new’

use for copperfor many a long_
year. Vi/hile copper was in short

supply, most companies were
willing to merely rake in their
extraordinary p r o f i t s. They
weren’t too much concerned
about loss of old markets and
did nothing to develop new
ones. They even neglected-—
until very recently—the most
elementary kind of selling job
on their product.

Most U. S. copper com--
panies can survive and still
enjoy healthy profits at lower
prices. The going will get. a
lot rougher, though, if they
don’t ‘start doing spmething
about developing new uses
and new markets for copper
——both in the U. S. and
throughout the world.

LEAD AND ZINC

Year end figures for both
lead and zinc show that both of
these metals enjoyed unusual
price -stability th.rough last
year..In- contrast to copper—-
the price of which varied by
nearly 28‘ per cent over b. the
year—~lead and zinc prices re-
mained practically unchanged
throughout the year.

That price stability was
primarily due to large scale
government purchases of ex-
cess supplies. Without this
support, prices of both of
these metals would have also
dropped.

The annual figures also point
up some of the problems faced
by ‘our domestic mining in-
dustry. , ‘ . ¥

U. S. lead and zinc smelters,
it now seems, are getting a
very substantial portion of
their ' s u ppl ie s from foreign
sources. The amount coming
from domestic mines appears to
have stabilized at a relatively
low level.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Secretary-Treasurer U U U
Pezzaii Fincis Mine-Mi” ;
-1 Stacks Up to Ethics Code

_V .. »‘ C ORRUPTION and racketeering in unions have received

so much public attention Vlately that many unions, includ-

fping the AFL-CIO Executive board itself, are rushing into

__ print with various “codes of ethics.” There is something

5‘ - ‘ defensiveabout these proclamations of purity. ‘They, smack

 » ., too much of a public relations Vpro- V
 .V gram. V

 _ ‘ . In the Mine, Mill and Smelter
iv, ,Workers Union, we have long tak-
’  ‘yen our democratic procedures for
 -granted. For us to issue a code
against racketeering and corrup-

,  tion is about as necessary as say-

U - ing that we are against child labor.

Still it would be interesting to
:see how Mi ne-Millstacks up
’ against some of these codes. Re- ,
p U cently an impartial group of citizens, including four min-
, ~; isters, a rabbi, an industrial engineer and a lawyer, made
 ;a three-month study of an Operating Engineers’ local in
, - New York at the request of a rank and file reform group.
2." This‘ inter-faithcommittee then issued a number of rec-
’ ommendations for reform which were recently published
‘- in the Catholic newspaper WORK. These recommenda-
 = , tions, says WORK, “. . . offer an index of how a union—
‘ mindful of the dignity of its members—should be run.”

. Let’s take thisindex point by point and see how Mine-

g ‘Mill measures up to it. ' V

. c ' THE COMMITTEE “Elections should be conducted by secret
- . ballot. If nominations are made by a nominating committee, the
" committee should be elected by secret ballot.” ' I -

_ MINE=MIVLL: All electVions,V both local and International,
a ‘are by-secret ballot. Election judges are also voted by the
' I V " membership. Nominations are made directly from the floor.

U THE COMMITTEE: "When the local has foremen and other

supervisors as members, they should be in a separate unit a ‘to

, assure rank and file members the‘ right and the opportunity to
j exercise free expression within the union.’ ” ~ .

MINE-MILL: Article I of the Constitution provides “sep-

- . a1-ate chartered locals” for supervisory employees, and else-
where the Constitution specifiesthat ‘supervisory employees

7 shall have no voice or vote or seatin meetings of the pro-
_duction locals. ' I I

_ ‘  COMMITTEE: “Each member should receive a written
U __repor_t on the welfare fund, including details on receipts and dis-
‘ bur'se_ments.U’.’ « ‘”‘- * ' 0

,V° _,,;M-INE-IVIILL: No settlement can be" reached‘ without .a-

vote of the membership. Nor can there be any strike -without

.UMUINE-ll/IILL: Except for filling vacancies by temporary_
ppointments, the practice in Mine-Mill is to elect Vshop stew-
ards’ by a vote of members in each department. . U V '1

 ‘V. -U  “The member’sV._right_ to a job should not
‘be, affected in any way by whether he supports or opposes the

Major Union Drive:

AT month’s end, with many legislatures in
a flurry of deadline activity as they prepared
to adjourn with many important bills still up
for action, Mine-Mill locals were making their
political forces heard and felt in a number of
state capitols. This was especially true in the
Rocky Mountain west where .the union’s legis-
lative committees were involved in effective
working relationships with other labor organi-
zations, political activity was being handled on
practically a full-time basis both by local union
and international representatives, and the mem-

- bership was actively involved at every stage.

Even with some crucial issues still undeter-
mined, it appeared clear that this activity was
already paying off.

, Montana

Legislative activity in Montana was inten- ‘
-sified as the deadline passed‘ for the trans-
mission ‘of bills from one'House‘ to the other.
In addition to the full lobbying job -headed by V
Board Member. Ernest Salvas-i with the assis-
tance of Int’l.‘Reps. Kalafatich and Powers,
and special legislative representative Arnold
Olsen (former State Attorney General), Mine-
Mill lobbying activities were increased by the
addition at the state capitol of Larry Mowrer
of4 Great Falls Smeltermen No. 16, Barney

. Rask of Butte Miners, No.1; -John Fonk of

East Helena Mill & Smeltermen No. 72, Ed Fa-
hey of Anaconda Mill & Smeltermen No. 117,
and Int’l Rep. J. P. Mooney. This full delega-
tion participated in a hearing on occupational
,disease bills the week of Feb. 18.

All Mine-Mill locals in the state are affili-V
ated with the Montana Mine-Mill Legislative
committee through which actviities are cen-
tralized. Furthermore, all labor lobbying is
coordinated through the Joint Labor Commit-
tee of the Democratic Party on which Board
Member Salvas serves as western Montana.
chairman. Frequent‘ joint meetings with AFL-
CIO leaders are held to review developments
and plan strategy. ‘ ' _ .

The full Montana program, backed by Mine-
Mill and the other unions of the Joint Com- C
mittee, has been passed in the House. This
includes an eight-hour collar-to-collar bill on
which more progress has been made than ever
before, increased unemployment compensation,
occupational disease bill, increased workmen’s
compensation bill and minimum wage bill. The
only benefits reduced injiouse passage .from
the increase to $100. a month proposed -in the
program were'.siliVcotic payments; the approved
bill raises ‘them from_ the present $65 toU $7’,
Already assured by action‘ in both Houses is
amounts on industrial

-accident legislation. _. V '  .

Asof Feb. 25 the Senate had acted on two "
bills: passed an occupational_ disease bill with
many restrictions, including a waiver clause
that would enable companies to compel present ’
and future employees. with existing‘ non-disab-
ling silicosis to waive all future rights and
compensation; and passed a workmen’s com- J
pensation bill which would slightly increase“
benefits but would also make additional res-
,trictions.. V V” U .o
A press-time bulletin Feb. 27 ~ from Salvas

‘ reported that an unemployment compensation V
. bill had passed both Houses and had gone to

the governor for signature. It raises weekly
benefits -from $26 to $32, increases the number
of‘ weeks‘ from 20 to .22 and eliminates the
present waiting period. '

Washington  

Organized labor, united politically at this
session of the Washington state legislature,
has tasted the fruits ofhvictory with the pass- ‘
age-= of at least three important bills in .the
House. Backed -by Mine-Mill, these are an in- '
dustrial insurance. bill which would increase.
benefits generally by as. much as .31 ’-percent,
a safety bill which would Vmakeit a gross de_-

an lunemployment compensation bill which
would increase -benefits from $35 to $45 a
week.’ All were considered‘ to have a good.
chance of passage in the Senate. ‘ -
Lobbying‘ actively in cooperation‘ with other
union representatives were UWilliam Lee, Elmer-
Olsen and Tom Rigney of Tacoma ‘Smelter-
men’s Union No. 25, assisted by District 7'
Board Member Chase Powers who-~ attended
the hearings on industrial insurance and met
with legislators and other union officials in-
eluding top leaders of the state AFL and CIO.
Olsen also met with Governor Rosellini to V
discuss his appointments of a Labor & Indus-

V » tries ‘Dept. director’ and supervisor, changes in

Insulting the Housewife ,  

  Hucksters Viclimize Shoppers With S
Various High-Pressure Gimmicks i

HAVE pity on the Ameridan housewife.
She’s the most insulted person of our‘ gener-
ation. P S

The insults are fired at her when she goes
shopping—and at regular intervals between——
through newspaper ads, TV commercials, dis-
play gimmicks, sales pitches, and other kinds
of razzle-dazzle. — ’

Every day she’s being high-pressured to buy
products steep in price and- low in quality.

‘How is this done‘? These are a few of the

recent affronts to her intelligence and good
sense‘: ‘

Olnstead of speaking to her in English,
the ad writers and pitchmen hand her a lot of
double talk: “The Jet-Spray and Deep Over-
flow rinses, the efficient.Sediment Swirl-Out
removes suds, soil, lint.” If the ad writers had
any respect for her ability to read English,
they would have said: “This washing machine
rinses well, gets‘out every speck‘ of dirt.” » ’

Hypnoﬁsm

0 They try to hypnotize her with fancy
boxes:-—ta-king for granted that she doesn’t
buy food but only buys. the box the food comes

in. ‘Their opinion of women was recently '

summed up by. Gerald Stahl, executive vice-
president of the Package Designers Council:
.“Psychiatrists tell us that a woman‘ ap-
proaching: a supermarket goes into a ~,slight
state of trance-—-her pulse slows down, the
pupils of her eyes. dilate. The average woman
takes exactly 20 seconds to cover. oneaisle in
a. supermarket, so you have to have a carton
that attracts and hypnotizes this woman, like
waving,a.flasl1lig[ht-in front of her eyes.”

0They try to trick her and make a dis-.

honest woman of her. In one Chicago. store,
when a woman asked ‘the price of an appliance
a salesman told her that the tag said $289,
but he had better check. _

So he turned to call loudly back to the

manager, making sure that the customer saw 1
his brightly colored hearing aid as he- turned. .

The manager's pre-arranged answer was $269.

‘ Turning‘ back to the customer, the sales-
man said, “Aren’t you glad we checked? The
new price is $239.” Of course, the salesman’s
hearing was ‘perfectly. good. Thinking that .the
salesman’s hearing handicap was getting her

- higher prices.

. ting high-priced,

an extra _$30 discount she signed up then" and
there.  ‘ .

Gambling A _ .
OThey appeal to the little woman’s gam-
bling instincts. .
Add up the digits in your social security—
mine total to 36——and that’s the discount she’s

, entitled to on a large Westinghouse appliance.

Your discount is higher or lower, of course,
depending how lucky you are with your social
security digits. _ -

OThey use bait to hook the housewife.

-p.

The advertising racketeer offers a product at

a spectacularly low price (usually furniture,
sewing machine, and ' vacuum cleaners)——a
product the retailer is determined not to s_ell if
he can possibly avoid it. K ,
His real purpose is to establish face to face

» contact with the customer so thathecan sell

her quality products at regular and much
He will go. to great length ‘to
avoid selling the bait, even to discrediting the
product. "
0 They use the trading starnp—an old. gim-
mick to dazze the housewife with premiums so
she will abandon the money-saving habit of
shopping around and comparing -values and

specials offered by different markets in the

neighborhood.‘ Instead of going to the store
with the best buys, she’s persuaded to go: to
the one that gives stamps. . '
“These stamps are a crazy thing, psycho-
logically,” one Kroger Co. official said: “In
one of our stores, a- lady came up to the
manager complaining about the 39-cent price
on one item. She wanted us to make it 40

- cents so she would get an extra stamp.”

’ The double-price swindle is also popular in
the perfume and hosiery industries and is be-
ing adopted by some hosiery manufacturers.
Here's the way it works.

A hosiery maker places a small ad in a
national magazine and lists an extravagant
retail price for the merchandise. The whole-

sale price‘ for the hose is'so much lower that

the retailer has room to cut theilretail price in
half and convince’ the ladies that ‘they are get-
“nationally-advertised” hos-
iery at a bargain.’

to 28 cents an‘ hour was nego-
tiated by Local 902 and the Sud-
bury Brewing and Malting Com-

ery, estimated to cbst the com-
pany 14 cents per hour.

Driver-salesmen formerly
considered as being outside the
bargaining unit will now come
under’ the present agreement.
An additional» statutory holiday
with pay is provided. .

An outstanding feature is
that while the‘ term is for a
two year period, the second

What Union
Is Doing

In Canada   

MOUNT SHEER, B. C.——The
terms of the new two-year
agreement between Local 663

‘ and- the Britannia Mining and
Smelting Co. provide for a nine- '

cents per hour general wage
increase, retroactive to October
1956;‘ with an additional five

cents effective October, 1957. 1

Other fringe benefits bring the
package up to 20 cents per hour.
These benefits include new
pension plans, the elimination
of qualifications in -statuatory
holiday clauses, and an increase
in group insurance coverage.
The new base rate is $1.67,
the base of $1.54 having been
eliminated. Miners will now re-
ceive $1.85 after the first raise.

Remac

SALMO, B. C.-——Unity and
perseverence paid off hand-
somely for 120 miners and mill
at Reeves MacDonald
Mines when Local 901 of Mine
Mill won a new agreement here
last week. Protracted negotia-
tions since the end of October
1956 had first seen the agree-
ment almost reached on wages
and hours only to break off on
the issues of severeance pay
and pensions. ‘

The dispute was submitted to
a Conciliation Board composed
of Mr. Green, Mayor of Kaso,
as chairman, with Mr. Giege-
rich representing the Company,
and Mr. R. Harding, CCF M.-
L.A., "representing the Union.

The Conciliation award pro-
vided for a settement of wages,
hours and other matters and
suggested resumption of nego-
tiations on pensions. .

The settlement provided for a
two-year agreement with wage
increases from 9c to 121A:.c aver-
aging 11.8c the first year effec-
tive to October 30, ’56. In the
second year of the agreement
another 6c to 81/20 an hour ‘in-
crease is granted. . -

In addition to theseﬂwag
gains, the Union obtained pad-
justments on wage’ .classifica-
tions, improved overtime rates,
2% times for statutory holidays

._ if worked, increased shift dif-

ferentials, increased sickness
and accident and life insurance
benefits. ‘

‘WASHINGTON, D. C.——The
National Hells’ Canyon associa-
tion, eight Washington State
Public Utility districts, and the
National Rural Electric Cooper-
ative association on Feb. 14
asked the U. S. Supreme Court
to , review the Hells Canyon
case and to look into the inter-
pretation of the Federal Power
act under which the Federal
Power commission on Aug. 4,
1955, licensed the Idaho Pow-
er company to build three low-
head dams on the Snake river.
The Association had advocated
that the FPC instead recom-
mend to Congress that the gov-
ernment build the high Hells
Canyon dam. The Court of Ap-
peals upheld the FPC’s action
on Oct. 9, 1956. 5 * 5 . _

Mine-Mill was one . of the
earliest supporters of“ a high-
head dam at,Hells Canyon.

The way in which the rivers
of the Pacific Northwest are
developed, _“will shape the ‘eco-
nomic future of the region,” the
petition said, pointing- to’ the
need for flood-control storage
and for low-cost power, to sus-
tain"the resource-based economy
of the Columbia Basin states.
“As a precedent,” it continued,
“the decision below may affect
the economy and future of ev-‘
ery river region, and thus the
economy and security of the
nation.” “

DIFFERENT VIEWS

The Hells Canyon Association
said that Section 10(a) of the
Federal Power Act has never
before been interpreted by the‘
courts. The section requires
that a project, to be licensed,
must be ‘_‘best adapted to a com-
prehensive plan.”

The ‘FPC examiner, the FPC
itself and the Court of Appeals
all arrived . at different inter-

-pretations of this section of

the law, the petition‘ asserted-;
neither the commission nor the

THE MINE-MILL UNION ’

C,-iﬂaroh. 1957

   

--Convencion en St. Paul

.ST. PAUL, Minn.—En tanto

-[que muchos sindicatos norte-
»americanos eran acusados el

 “mes pasado de précticas no
- democraticas y de practicas dic-

tatoriales, los Trabajadores del
International Union of Mine,_

Mill and Smelter, controlado por
la afiliacion, estaban prepa-
randose para celebrar su cum-
pleaﬁos n1’1mer’o 64 asistiendo a

sus 52 ava Convencion aqui. La 0

convencion celebrada de acuerdo

’ con la mas democratica consti-

tucion del movimiento obrero
norteamericano, se iniciara aqui
el lunes 18 de marzo en el Hotel

0 .Lowry y continuara por todo el

.resto de esa semana.

g~Los delegados y dirigentes
sindicales entrarzin a esta

 convencion _con v i c t or i a s

mayores detrés de ellos y con
un empuje determinado para.
la estabilidad y la consolida-
cion y encaminadas. Talvez la.
mayor tarea de la conven-
cion sera el ‘adelantamiento
del ‘gran objetivo de 1957 de
Mine-Mill-de fortalecer nues-
tra posicion como el sindicato
-dominante de la industria de -
. metales -no ferrosos. ..

INTERVALO DE 10 ANOS

E1 Mine-Mill vuelve a St. Paul
y in I-_I_otel Lowry después de un
intervalo de 10 aﬁos. Hace diez
‘aﬁos que el sindicato abrio su
43 -ava Convencion aqui, tres
dias despuésde que la ley Taft-
Hartley entro en vigor. Fué el
primer sindicato obrero norte-
americano que demandara la
abrogacion de la ley. Casi todos
"los otros sindicatos han seguido
el ejemplo en convenciones
subsiguientes. '

Los delegados a la convencion
;del Mine-Mill consideran, ordi-.1
,-narias estas acciones historicas.
Ya estén los sindicatos locales
enviando sus resoluciones sobre
docenas de ma.terias; De t.stas
naceré la direccion -del sindicato,
otros precedentes, otros esca-
lones hacia un sindicato mas
grande y mas vigoroso.

UN ANO SOBRESALIENTE

El_ entusiasmo del obrero
brdinario por la convencion
1-aparecio en la edicion del 2 de
febrero de. ‘Mine-Mill Butte
Miner, publicado por la Local
1, en- estas ipalabras: ,,

“Se espera que ésta sea ‘ﬁna
de 'l,as'convenciones mas triun-
tales y victoriosas- debido all
hecho de que. el Mine-Mill tuvo

‘ el -aﬁo sobresaliente ‘del -siglo. . .

Bien pudieran los sindi-calistas

de todas las minas y molinos y »

fundidoras regocijar y ‘darse
pamadas en la espalda en St.
Paul; Es por razén de la buena
y brillante dirigencia local e

‘-internacional de. este sindicato

;que».. los trabajadores pueden
.esta'r justamente orgullosos del
sindicato que ellos han edificado

’ y por el cual han luchad-o hasta

 ,llegar a" su_ actual prestigio.

cales encontraran bastante

razon para. tener entusiasmo

en St.‘ Paul. Primero, la
5‘ agenda de la convencion esta
repleta de articulos ’ espe-
ciales que les serén de gran
valor practice a los sindicatos
locales en los meses veiiideros.
Se presentarén bien conooidos
y habiles locutores y ordenes
de-negocios especiales, incluso
un dia entero de discusciones

al redondo sobre salud 7y
bienestar, que se estan
proyectando.

DIVE1,%SION

En cuanto a diversion, las
locales del Distrito 3 bajola
dirigencia del Miembro de_ la
Mesa, Raymond Dennis, seran
los huéspedes. Ellos y el Sindi-
cato Internacional mismo han
proyectado cuidadosamente las
horas de mas descanso de ,la
convencion. Casi a la cabeza de
la lista, por supuesto, estara el
banquete anual para los dele-
gados y sus esposas que se
celebraraen el Lowry el jueves
por la noche el 21 de marzo.

Se presentaré. enel banquete
un espectéculo de baile y.m1’1-
sica, con la estrella de Holly-
wood y Broadway Lloyd Gougli
como encargado ‘de ceremonias.
Ademas, las varias delagaciones
del distrito estén proyectando

sus proprias fiestecitas durante
la semana. _

Los que vayan de compras y
Io.s que vengan a ver lo que hay
tendran las conveniencias de dos
ciudades_ enteras para escoger
ya que St. Paul esta directa-
rnente opuesta, después de cruzar

el Mississippi, a su ciudad
gemela de Minneapolis. .
CON CILIOS"~ ’

También habran varias reuni-
ones de concilios de negocia-
ciones del Mine-Mill en St. Paul.
Los concilios del AS&R y del
Anaconda también proyectan
reuniones para el sabado 16 de
-marzo en el Lowry’ y el concilio
del Kennecott se‘ reuniré. el
domingo 17 de marzo.

Ya que éste es aﬁo de, elec-
ciones para el Mine-Mill, los
candidates para funcionarios
internacionales, y miembros -de
la mesa ejecutiva seran nom-
brados el iiltimodia de la con-
vencion. 

Seeligiré durante la conven-
cion el International Canvassing
Committee, el cual revisara y
contara ‘los votos de la eleccion
de referendum que tomaré lugar
.e1 21 de mayo.
presentara para el voto’ de la
afiliacion ese dia, cualquier
enmienda constitucional apro-

bada por la convencion.

Lac Razon Que La ,Mesa Proprisou
Un Aumenfo Por Cabeza  

DENVER—»Para llevar a cabo
con éxistp el programa de con-
solidacion y organizacion actual-
mente en camino, dentro del
Mine-Mill desde que se firmaron
los acuerdos de tres aﬁos, va a
ser necesario ingreso adicional.
El programa no puede realizarse
a base de actual balance entre
entradas y gastos.

Segiin el Secretario-Tesorero,
Albert Pezzati, ésta es la razon
-principal a que acude la Mesa
Internacional Ejecutiva en su
_decision de- proponer un au-
mento de 50 centavos. en las
cuotas por cabeza. Si queda
aprobado en la convencion
venidera en St. Paul, el aumento
recornmendado seria ‘puesto a
vote de referendum por parte de
la aﬁliacion e1 21’ de mayo.

, La decision de la Mesa de
hacer la propuesta financiera se
alcanzo después de varios meses

de consideracion de los “hechos

de la Vida ﬁnanciera,” dijo Pez-
zati. Los gastos subieron mien-.
tras que los ingresos se esta-
bilizaron.
“Un sindicato que esta
administrando millones de
dolares de contratos, de ;pro- '
gramas de salud y bienestar,
planes de pensiones y otros
beneficios de la afiliacion es
una empresa grande,” dijo, el
secretario - tesorero, “y no
costea perjudicar estas tre-
mendasganancias con un pro-
grama de economia falsa. El
problema principal no es que
' hayamos aumentado. el mi-
mera de ‘actividades en que
gastar nuestro dinero. El ver-
dadero mal esta en el dolar
sindical, que como el dolar de
todo e mundo, vale basante
menos que lo que valia.”

LOS COSTOS AUMENTAN

Los tramendos aumentos de
tarifas de viaje, tarifas de hotel,
tarifas de’ teléfono, precios de
papelde escribir, costos de im-
prenta, el costo de toda clase de
abastecimientos sindicales, y
de otros articulos. rutinarios son
responsables por algunos de los
crecientes costos del sindicato,
pero éstos no son, de‘ninguna

..manera,. las’ razones Vprincipales

‘para proponer un aumento en el
impuesto por cabeza. _
Principalmente, la necesida
de mas ingreso viene del pro-
grama del Mine-Mill de ‘consoli-
dar su posicion como el sindi-
cato dominante en la industria
de metales no Ierrosos-—u"na
posicion muy encarecida por las
victorias, negociativas de 1956,
las cuales abrieron camino para
estabilizar el sindicato y forta,le-
cerse en preparacion de ganan-
cias de negocia-cion del porvenir.
CARACTERISTICAS'

Las caracteristicas principales
del programa -de consolidacion
en la manera formulado por la
Mesa Ejecutiva, y las cuales
todass costarén bastante dinero,
son las siguientes: .

algiin tiempo, tan inadecuadas
que han perjudicado la eficacia
del cindicato. Ann siendo que
el Mine-Mill estuviera preparado
para pasarla_ como mejor pu-
diera, sin embargo, y quedarse
en las mismasyoficinas, ‘la, deci-
sion ya no esta en manos del
sindicato. Se esta ahora of_re-
ciendo el edificio para venderse
y parece inevitable que se derr-
umbe. El historico teatro Tabor
ya ha cerrado sus puertas.

Los arquitectos y contratistas
han estado trabajando en los
planes de una nueva oficina

depende de si se aprueba o no
el aumento por cabeza.

_ CANADA.

Una de las causas del aumento
en l.os gastos del -sindicato es el
compromise de , devolver un
minimo de $5,000 por mes a la
canadiense
del Mine-Mil], el cual entro en
vigor el‘ septienmbre pasado. Se
justitica por completo este re-
embolso ya que los canadienses
han estado pagando wtodos los
costos de su propria operacion
sin ninguna ayuda del sindicato
Internacional y al mismo tiempo

M han estado pagando unos $15,000

por mes al Internacional. Aim
con esta devolucion, mas la
devolucion 'de otros cinco -cen-
tavos por afiliado parael peri-
odico sindical canadiense, el
sindicato Intenacional todavia
recibe, enteramente libre y sin
obligacion, un promedio de
$9,000 por mes del Canada.

Otros gastos recientes que
se han incurrido incluyen un
--aumento en la parte que le'
corresponde al sindicato Inter-

Por supuesto, que ninguno de

personal, o al aumento de las ,

Other ‘recent’ expenses in-.

ering the staff. ‘ '
‘None’ of *-the increase inex-
