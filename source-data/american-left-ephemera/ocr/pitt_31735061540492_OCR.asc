rule ’- that cements ﬁlibuster in the. Senate; the road block-

to FEPC and all other civil‘ rights legislation. ’1‘his isthe
Rule 22 for which his running mate,» Sparkman, voted. This
V is the same Sparkman who on the matter of ﬁlibuster stated

in a. speech in Mobile, Alabama, back in 1952:

“We 21 Southern. Senators are pledged to use every parlia-
mentary device possible to defeat civil rights legislation.”

It is Sparkman who, if elected, will sit in the presiding.

chair of the Senate and will make rulings on parliamentary
questions involved in any ﬁght over civil rights legislation.

p The day, after Mr. Stevenson made his- statment on
ﬁlibuster, Sparkman in Memphis, Tennessee, when asked

‘What he would do as Vice-President on the matter of ending.
oﬁlibuster said:

“I would meet issues as they come up. No judge will an-
nounce ahead of time what he will do if a point of order is

raised.’ I will look up the rules and precedents and rule as’

I would if I were a judge.”

What precedents would Mr. Sparkman look up? I-13

himself voted to establish precedents in support of filibuster-

against FEPC. He himself voted to override all anti-ﬁlibuster
rulings on civil rights. legislation. Are not these the prece-
dents that would guide Mr. Sparkman?

‘Let us bear in mind that you cannot separate Spark»
man from Stevenson. When you vote for the one, under
our law, you cast your vote for the other. You vote for both
President and Vice-President with the one vote.

Let .us- return v to Stevenson’s speech in New York on
civil rights. Immediately following his words in that speech
with which he tried to -fool the people on FEPC we find this
statement: . ’

“Iwould urge in these ﬁelds and in many others that affect

national policy that all of us resolve to take a fresh look.

There has been too much freezing of positions, too much emo-
tion, too many dogmatic statements of irrevocable attitudes!’

This is the language of a glib tongue and of a crooked

intellect. The only honest attitude on discrimination and- ‘

inequality must be one that is irrevocable. We of the
’AMERIC.AN LABOR PARTY (New York’s Progressive
Party) have taken and will continue to take an irrevocable
attitude. We say there must be compulsory fair employment

’ Stevenson Goes to Richmond

'1

N September 20, Stevenson went to Richmond, Virginia. 1

His Richmond speech reveals the real Stevenso_n—-
the real Stevenson on civil rights, the real Stevenson on
white supremacy.

In this speech he ﬁrst slanders the genuine efforts that
were made for democratic reconstruction after the Civil
War. He ‘aligns himself with those who opposed the estab-
lishment of real democracy in the South at that time. He

1 praises the charms of the Old South, or shall I say the slave

South. He talks of the mocking birds and the beaten bis-
cuits. He talks of the literature of the South. And what
is the book he extols? Gone With The Wind!

Then, really warming up to this theme, the “enlight-

ened” Mr. Stevenson makes this astounding statement :_ T

“Among the most -valuable heritages of the Old South is its
political genius, which in many respects was far ahead of
its time. Even today some of the ﬁnest products of Southern
governmental thgught are only beginning to win the general
acceptance which they have so long deserved.

“A classic example, it seems to me, is the Constitution of the
Confederacy. Scholars of constitutional law have long recog-
nized it as a sound and most thoughtful document.”

This is not Rankin or Bilbo talking; this is Stevenson
talking in September, 1952, in Richmond, Virginia. ’
The Constitution of the Confederacy is praised by the

candidate of the Democratic Party of 1952; the same Con-

11

/

   stitution which would have perpetuated ‘slavery and would
,”f‘;: have given constitutional sanction to the slave trade.

 . . ”i.Ca-n a vote-seeking candidate stoop any lower? Appar-
I ‘ ently he can. Mr. Stevenson, bowing to the Dixiecrats,
lwent on:

 

 ' .2; , ‘ ' .9‘. . . the Southern talent for government has won the recog-
  , p_ nition which is its due. Many of your statesqare among the
' ' “ ‘ ‘ best governed in theeland.” '

The best governed states in the land‘? . . . The state
 governments of Jim Crow? Of segregated schools? Of the
* S  Martinsville Seven executions? Of the “legal” lynching of
,  Willie McGee? Of the bombing of the Moores? Of the shoot-
 ing in cold blood of Negro soldiers in uniform only because
they sought the shelter of “white only” bus depots in these
“best governed” states during the last war?

   In,Richmond, Stevenson made the classical apology for
2 _ discrimination and racial hatred:

“So long as man remains a little lower than the angels, I
suppose that human character will never free itself en-
“tirely from " the blemish of prejudice, religious or racial.

These are prejudices, unhappily, that tend to rise wherever

the minority in question is_ large. . . .

,, “Some forget this, and in talking of the South, forget that
_ in the South the minority is high.” ,

J E;I suppose Mr. Stevenson would have the Negro people

» “ apologize‘ for existing and for being in such large numbers
' inthe South. » - '

_ r _,  He even’ seeks to equate “‘anti-Negroism” and “anti-
 Semitism” with anti-Southernism in the following passage:

1’ °"4“1x.ut.I_’ do not attempt to justify the unjustiﬁable, whether
 S’ ' it. is anti—‘Negroism in one place, anti-Semitism in another,
or for that matter, anti-Southernism in many places.” '

Here Mr. Stevenson tells us in one breath that he is
opposed to anti-Negroism and anti-Semitismabut in the next

breath he opposes those decent Americans who strongly and
uncompromisingly ﬁght anti-Semitism and anti-Negroism. “

It is said that Mr. Stevenson uses the English language

States ever used it so deviously.

Stevenson in Richmond continues his orgy of arrogant 

southern bourbonism:

“In Congress Southern leaders once‘ again give wise and
distinguished service to the nation. . .. .” e

What Southern leaders in Congress? Representative

John S. Wood, chairman of the House‘Un-American'Activi- " E

any candidate for the high oﬂice of President of the United- ‘

ties Committee? Sgnator Eastland of the McCarran -Com-' , :  A

mittee? Senator Connolly of Texas, chairman of the Senate}

Committee _on Foreign Relations? .

Signiﬁcantly in this speech devoted entirely to glowing-r 
praise of the white South, Mr. Stevenson robs the emanci-' A

pated slave of the credit for his ‘contribution to the,rebuild-=

ing of the South. He omits any mention of the slaves’; ’ H
descendants; of. the tremendous role they have played’ in C ,
the development of that land and its industries; of their__ _.
toil, of their art,» their literature and their science; of their 1‘

struggles for their rights, and above all of their heroic and

It's Still Taft-Hqrﬂey H
S THERE a lesser evil on the issue of the Taft-Hartley

‘ Law? We know-the Republican Party’s position on 'Taft-  .'

Hartley. It was announced by Senator Taft, the co-author,

an

 

of Springﬁeld, ‘Illinois, but the Jefferson Davis whose spirit  H *

VA
\

 iof”the_,Taft-Hartley‘ Law, after having breakfast with Eisen-

 

hower on September 12th. Eisenhower “adheres” to the prin-

\ ciples” of the Taft‘-Hartley Law, said Mr. Repub1ican——and

he had it in writing. So that we all know that Eisenhower
and the Republican Party “adhere” to anti-labor injunctions

\  ~ and to all the other “‘principles” of the Taft-Hartley slave-
’ /labor law. ' .

Now, what is Stevenson’s real position.

In February he said that he wanted merely to modify

the Taft-Hartley Law; .that he wanted to amend it. In his

by speech beforethe AFL Convention‘ he asserted that there

was no real difference between amending and repealing,
but that he favored‘ repeal simply because of the implication
involved in the name Taft-Hartley. , g

In Detroit on Labor Day he called for the repeal of
Taft«—Hartley, -and at the same time he made ﬁve recom-

. mevzidations,‘ the sum of which constitute the re—enactment

of its most vicious provisions under another name, In his
speech in New York to the AFL Convention he declared
that he stood ‘by these ﬁve recommendations. Any read-
ing of them, as outlined in the Detroit speech, would lead

« = any honest man, any friend of labor anywhere, to realize
‘ . that here again we have the same Taft-Hartley, its guts, its

brains, its eyes, its ears, its legs, in another proposed law.

Mr. Stevenson in his Labor Day speech in Detroit stated
that he is against -injunctions. But, he added:

“We cannot, however, ‘tolerate shutdowns which threaten

the national safety, even that of the free world. The right -

‘to bargain collectively does not include a right to stop the
national economy.”

‘ . And in New York before the AFL he said:

“You have expressed your willingness to accept procedures
which recognize the priority of the public interest in national
emergency disputes.”

What does this language mean ? It simply means that

{P

!.\_N‘

:2-aqmg.

whenever the press and-the administration‘-whoop it up; and
shout that a strike threatens the national safety, then the

in President will declare that such afstrike cannot be tolerated.

This means strike—breaking by Presidential decree, something

gattempted by Truman in 1946 when. he tried to draft railroad

strikers into the Army. .
Further in the Detroit speech. Mr; Ste-vens_on called for

seizures.. Seizure today is str-ike—break.ing. The steel workers,
learned this bitter lesson when they get their -dose of‘ strike‘-

breaking» through seizure.

Eisenhower endorses strike--breaking injunctions under .i

the Taft—Hartley law. Stevenson endorses strike-breaking by
a ban on strikes during “national e-merg.eneies,”. and by
seizure, or the ending of strikes by Presidential decree. I
submit, that here again there is no “lesser evil.”

A recent issue of the magazine Business Week also sees
no “lesser evil” on this issue; it points out:

‘‘There’s awide area of agreement between’ Republicans and

Democrats on what should’ be relaxed: in Taft-Hartley and

«what shouldn’t be touched.”

The working people of America will not swal.low either
Eisenhower's “adherence” to the Taft--Hartley» -law or Stev-
enson’s tricky formula which means Taft—Hartley under a
new name. Nor will they permit some pretenders to the title
of “labor leader” who act as business men of labor, to sctfttle
1abor’s rights. Many of these “business men: of, labor” joined
with. Truman’-s Secretary of Labor Tobin, a supporter of
Stevenson, in vtorpedping any real ﬁght for repeal of Taft-
Ha-rtley in the Congress elected in 1948; - S

I am conﬁdent that the same ﬁghting spirit_ which
spurred ra.nk and ﬁle workers to stand up for higher wages
and better working conditions in steel, railroad, mining, long-
shore and other industries will reject Taft-Hartleyism in

any disguise. I urge them to recognize that onlythe Progres- — _
sive: Party and its candidates-Vincent Hallinan». for Presi- T

15’

 

 

 

lidelit, and Charlotta A. Bass for Vice-President-call for the

outright repeal of the Taft-Hartley law, the ‘re-enactment

‘av. . of the” Wagner Labor Relations Act, and the end of the
_ wage-freeze. . . g

Eisenhower ‘McCarthyism’ and
Stevenson 'McCarranism'
A OME Americans, who rightly see in Eisenhower, Nixon
and McCarthy a grave danger to our civil liberties, try

to forget that it was the Truman administration, aided and
egged on by the McCarrans and the McCarthys, which

 launched the greatest witch-hunt in American history, and
laid the ground-work for the total destruction of 'our Bill
of Rights. ’ t ~

Has Stevenson repudiated these crimes against Ame:ri--

A ca’s freedoms? He has not! Instead, in speech after speech,»
_ he has pledged a pitiless pursuit of every phase of the Tru-

I_!l_£,L_[l’Witch-hunt. _ V
, Yet many seemed beguiled by the few high-sounding

ggeneralities Stevenson used in his speech before the Ameri-

can Legion, which I say was deceitful and devious. It is easy
to. defend, the civil liberties of General Marshall against

A  McCarthy's attacks. The real test of a defender of civil liber—
ties in this country today- is defense of the constitutional .

rights -of Communists. This Stevenson not only did not do

; at the Legion meeting but he aided and abetted the ferocious

assaults “now being made on the civil liberties of American
Communists. (-

_ It is well known that “anti-Communism” is a .weapon
to c‘.n;tstroy the rights of all who seek peace, security and

 equa1ity._ineour country. That is how it is-being used by the

._  .Democrats. and Republicans alike. That is how Stevenson
‘ A’ L, and Eisenhower insist they will continue to use it.

2  Stevenson followed up his Legion speech with a reveal- -

 _in_g talk at Albuquerque, New Mexico on September 12th.

" * In‘./this address he adopted the fascist declaration of policy 1 ~

ICS

 

 

 

 

in the McCarran A.ct,t almost verbatim. He accepted it and‘:

embraced all of the legislation which inc-;';'-ates our ‘Bin 0%‘
Rights.’ He justified the activities of the Department of?

V Justice and of the F. B. 1. After promising ruthl.essi_y:. to

prosecute and extlrpate “Communists” anywhere in gov-
ernment, labor and in business, he made this statement:

“We have tightened up our espionage and security legisla-
tion. We have instituted a Federal loyalty system-—and we

did so, I should add, in l947——three long years before the »

Senator from Wisconsin made ‘his shrill discovery of the

‘K
\

_J

\

Communist menace. . « ~ ‘ i

"We have prosecuted the Communist leadership. Where the»
law has been violated the Justice Department has indicted
and convicted the criminals. In all this effort/we na.ve"ha7d‘

the faithful and resourceful work and national protection-

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. . . . .

“. . . So far as l cansee, the FBI is. doing and has done an.

excellent investigation job. . . .”

Here Mr. Stevenson brags that the Democrats were
ahead of McCarthy’, three long years, he says, in the mas’-

sacre of the constitutional liberties of the American people. r

It is signiﬁcant also in this respect that at Sp-ringfield,il.ffa*s.sa-
chusetts, he went out of his way to congra5u?ate- the Demo--

cratic Party candidate for Senator, Representative Johny

Kennedy. NSaid Stevenson:

“I want to say to you that John Kennedy isamy typeyofisa ’

guy. I wonder how many of you know that it was (jc~n.g'iress-
man Kennedy and not Senator Nixonwho got the first cita-
tion for a ‘Communist for perjury and it was Christotfel. the

labor leader who held the Allis-Cliglniers plantior so long" M

in_ Milwaukee. What is more’ he was convicted."

‘Here he boaststhat the Democrats were ahead of Nixon
in the persecutionof innocent people. The case of the United
Automobile Workers leader Christoffel is one of the most

despicab1e"fra.me—ups in -the history of American jiir2sp:rud-- V

repeal of the Smith and McCarran Acts; it is a vote for

peace, security and jobs; it is a vote to restore this goverm S  9’

ment to the American people.

It is a vote as valuable as that cast for the Liberty’

Party in 1840 against slavery, and for the Free Soil Party‘ .~  
« in 184-8 and 1852 against extension of slavery. It is a_ vote-
similar to the one that made up the one million votes for ‘ ;-
Eugene V. Debs in 1920, which, in turn, led tothe four mil-_ -4

lion votes for LaFollette in 1924, and for victory for’R0ose~i » 7

velt in 1932.

Great causes were never won by sacriﬁcing a realiﬁghty
and substituting for it the seeming lesser evil. In 1916 we
were told that Wilson was a lesser evil, that he had kept us

out of war, that electing him would give us time in which ,
to secure the peace. Wilson was inaugurated March 4th,. ..
1917; on April -7th of the same year we were at war ‘ft ~ '

make the world safe for democracy.”

In Germany we had another illustration of the lesser V’ 
evil. The lesser evil advocates said: “Better Hindenburg» : 9
than Hitler.” A real ﬁght against both was sacriﬁced for-it »
the seeming lesser evil of Hindenburg; and the Germans-

got both, Hindenburg and.Hitler. And to those who say
better Stevenson than Eisenhower, I say to them thatyif.

they do get Stevenson they are getting Eisenhower, -9 

for the people who nominated Eisenhower are the

same forces that controlled the Democratic‘ Conven--i ~-
tion which nominated Stevenson. The program is the ‘same, = ~

the parties are the same, their masters are the same.

There can be no difference between an Eisenhower War.»  ..i=::

The greater the vote for Hallinan and-‘Bass, the stronger
will be the organized force to continue the ﬁght for peace
after the election. A large vote for Hallinan and Bass will
be an inspiration to millions of Americans to join their
strength with those who have voted for the Progressive
Party in this election.

A surrender to any seeming lesser evil will mean the

destruction of the only organized political opposition to war.
Our nation will be eternally grateful to those who in

N’ Iny considered judgment the elections’ of 1952 take -place

' under conditions which point to a concerted plan to extend»
the Korean War into a large-scale Asian -war, after the polls ’

close. I amp-ﬁrmly convinced thatthose who plunged us into
Korea, both the Republicans and Democrats, a-ndi those

whose conspiracy they serve in this matter, Aphavem decided

that peace is dangerous to them and that the war must be
extended.

The consummation of this plot to exte.nd the war  de-=
layed until after the elections only because of fear» of the

people. The<American people are deﬁ.nitely opposed to the - V
Korean »War. The overwhelming majority of Americans, no —

l

 

 

matter howithey are divided on other issues, are united on A
the objective of cease fire in Korea.

This is the issue the war plotters do not want discussed
in this campaign. They have tried to rig this election with‘
the nomination by both the Republican and Democratic Par-
ties of candidates who deliberately evade the all-important
question of cease fire in Korea. By this scheme they hope to
prevent the people fromusing the election to express their
demand for a cease fire.

The term all-important is inadequate to describe the
crisis character of this issue. Tragically, after 27 months of
killing in Korea, with 119,000 American casualties, some of
us accept the Korean conﬂict as we do the ﬂowing of the
Hudson River. After 14 months of talk at Panmunjon some
have come to feel that this so-called “police action” or “little
war” is something with which we can live. They have for-

gotten that war in our time is like cancer——if it is not stopped ‘
it spreads: If this Korean War is not stopped now, it too will '

spread.

V We have drafted over one million men since the War in
Korea began. We have today, from the standpoint of selec-
tive weapons, the largest military machine in the history of ‘

., the wor1d..The fact that it is being expanded every minute

is no accident. The war plotters intend to use it. It is part
of their plan ' to spread the War. Witness the intensiﬁed
bombing—bombing brought to the very borders of the Soviet
Union and China.

The report of the United Nations Economic Committee
onthe failure of Western Europe to achieve economic re-
habilitation, together with the ever expanding war machine,

and the stubborn refusal to cease fire, portends the‘ decision

tdplunge us'into_ a ‘world War after the American people
have been beguiled into" throwing away their opportunityto
vote against war in thes1952 campaign. - .

There is only one question which has not been settled:

4

 

 

I at Panmunjom, the question of returning war prisoners. This
»question, since time immemorial, has been settled always
after the shooting has stopped. No war in history has ever '

"been fought over this issue. The reason the Pentagon does
-not agree to cease ﬁre now, and to negotiate the return of

prisoners afterwards, is not one of mere ,stubborness -or na- _

tiaonal pride. There is only one reason: A cease ﬁre would
upset the plot toutilize Korea to hurl-use into the devastation

of a world war. The war plotters must have ‘shooting and

 

 

killing going on when the order for world war is ﬁnally
given.

The War Ploﬁers Can Be Sfopped

I SAY that all this can be stopped. I say that by using the
election to mobilize the people's demand for cease :ﬁre, we
can prevent the war in Korea from -being turned into World

 

War III. I also say that unless we utilize this election as the‘ -

-most effective means in the next month to alert Americans
to an urgent and undeniable demand’ for cease ﬁre now, our
country will be pushed into an expanded war, with conse-

-quent Fascism and the destruction of eyerything for which .

men live. , p
The resolving of every other issue, civil rights, -labor,
civil liberties, agriculture, the economic well-being of the

American people, depends on cease ﬁre i.n Korea. If war does -

not cease, but spreads, then there will not only ~be- no civil
rights enacted, but inequality and discrimination will be in-
tensiﬁed, labors’ shackles will be tightened, freedom totally

'-destroyed, and the future of Americans crushed under the‘

burden of war. “

The issue of cease ﬁre in Korea is everything; nothing
else counts. That is why no one can afford the -luxury -of be-
ing lulled into smugness by any alleged “lesser evil.”

It is on this ‘over-all, fundamental, and «decisive issue
that both candidates,‘ Eisenhower and ‘Stevenson, are as

 . alikeas two individuals can possibly be. Both Eisenhower

 and" Stevenson support the Korean War. And in opposing a.

 cease firenow,“ both support its spread. K

 ' Eisenhower time and time again has said that we had
no other recourse than to get into the Korean "war.

Stevenson said on September 9th in San Francisco:

“In Korea we took ‘a long step toward building at security
system in Asia. As an American I am proud that we had the
courage to ‘resist that ruthless, cynical aggression. 3. . . ’ ’ »
“I believe we may in time look back at Korea as a major
turning point in- history. . . .”

   -As to cease fire, Eisenhower-‘s answer is:

Here again Stevenson is not the‘Lesser Evil; he is the

Other Evil. ' Q __ .

Skilfully I Devised Evqsiéiis

_DENT’.[TY of position on the fundamental issue of peace or
war by both Eisenhower and Stevenson leads inexorably
to identity of position on all of the other issues tied in with
it.
Let ussee: Is there any difference between the Repub-
lican and Democratic platform on civil rights? I need not
argue about it. Here is what Dr. Channing Tobias says about

‘the civil rights planks of both these platforms:

“Eloquently stated vague principles, carefully planned omis-
sions and skilfully devised evasions, all woven together with

_p such ambiguity as to mean all things to all men.”
Is there, then, a lesser evil on civil rights?‘

V First of all, let us bear in mind that the Democratic
Party platform does not use the words filibuster, anti-lynch,
anti-poll tax, or the term FEPC. These words are purposely

omitted and in their place we have meaningless generalities‘

Stevenson followed up the generalities of his party plat-

form when he stated in his speech to the New York Demo-is
crats on August 28th that he would support FEPC “When

states fail to act and inequalities of treatment persist.” In
that speech he ﬂatly stated that he favored action - by the
states ﬁrst, and took the position that discrimination isa state
-problem to be treated by the states, and that the federal‘ gov-

ernmentshould step in only when the states have! failed to .

act. This, I submit, is a negation of FEPC.iIt isa devious
way of asserting that» he actually opposes federal FEPC.

' Inequality and discrimination are national problems and
require national legislation. If the matter is left to the states
to act upon, and if, as Stevenson proposes, the government
cannot step in where the states have acted, canyou imagine

'43.‘ ""“‘_. __,,.—r

 

 

 

what kind of an FEPC we would have iii: such states as
Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama, whose Democratic organ~

izat:ions support Stevenson? Yet, if these states set up. any '

kind of an F.EPC, howeve;r hypocritical and ineffective, Stev-
enson proposes that the federal government stay out.

How can anyone whoybelieves in civil rights accept the

Stevenson position on c:ivil rights? Is the Stevenson position 4

of state priority on FEPC a lesser evil than the Republican

pos:it:ion that FEPC is the primary responsibility of the»
states? Stevenson on ‘civil rights is not the Lesser Evil; he»

is the Other Evil. .

The Democratic Party, the Republican Party and the-

Liberal Party want FEPC as an issue and not as a law. In

‘Stevenson's own state he took no initiative to get an FEPC

bill passed. As a result, FEPC was defeated in Illinois by one
vote, the vote of a Democ:rat.

Only the candidates of the Progressive Pa.rty—Hallinan
and Bass+—stand unequivocally for a compulsory federal
FEPC law. it

. On the question of ﬁlibuster Stevenson said on August
28th that he supports the principle of majority rule. He
declared: - . ‘

“The precise nature of the changes that should be made in
the present Rules of Congress is, of course, a problem for

the Congress itself,.for each House, under‘ our Constitution, 7

makes its "own rules for doing business. As President"!
could not make the decisions but I could and would use
‘gvhatever inﬂuence I may have to encourage the Congress
to shake‘ oft‘ its thackles.”

Here again we have the Stevenson technique. It is the
Yes and No .tec"hnique.‘He will “shake off the shackles,” but
he would-leave “the precise nature of the changes” to the
Congress. What is signirﬁeant is that nowhere does Stevenson
speciﬁcally state that he ‘will use his inﬂuence to abolish Rule
22. He makes not the slightest mention of ‘Rule 22. This is

s the rule which makes majority‘ rule impossible. This is the ~
