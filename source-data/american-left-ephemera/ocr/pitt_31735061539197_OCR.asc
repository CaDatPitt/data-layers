DISCRIMINATION  

  
  

if he wants a barber he must hire from the top of a syndicate
list, whether he is black or white.

“The plant manager in need of a technician, the personnel
executive seeking a clerk or secretary — both must submit to the
same process. Admittedly this is coercion, but it is necessary and
it can be expected to disappear when the need for it no longer
exists.” A

In dealing with holdouts, the approach of the Cuban govern-
ment is the direct opposite of the “moderation” and snail-like
“deliberate speed” which is offered to Negroes here.

If a Cuban Negro is denied a cup of coffee in a restaurant
it’s the restaurant own-er, not the Negro, who goes to jail. '

From the outset the Cubans have moved hard and fast against
those who try to perpetuate racism. For example, the Feb. 12,
1959, issue of Jet reported: ’ ‘

“As the Castro government’s first move to end ‘segregation
in Cuba, Gov. Morales Hernandez ordered the closing of private
clubs in the province of Santa Clara unless the premises were
opened to Negroes . . . ; The action followed a rally protesting
continued segregation of Negroes in the city of Santa Clara . . .
For years, the province, considered the most prejudiced area in
Cuba, had upheld prejudice . . . . Gov. Hernandez ended an age-
old segregation policy in the city park. Formerly Negroes were
barred from walking in the central section of the city park.”

- Won’t it be a wonderful day in this country when Jim Crow
clubs and restaurants are told to desegregate or shut down?

One of the most inspiring aspects of the drive to wipe out
all barriers between the races is the educational campaign. In
healthy contrast to this country, where school books either slur
over the subject or add their disgraceful bit to bolstering prejudice,
the Cuban people are being taught to understand that both from
a social and scientific viewpoint the myth of “racial superiority”

"is false and reactionary.-

This educational material is gpread across the country in
books, articles and frequent nation-wide broadcasts by Castro and
other government leaders. The educational material is designed
for both adults and children. (For an example of what a book
can and should say on the race question see page 13.)

This education by word and deed is already having a pro-
found effect on Cuban life. This doesn’t mean that prejudice has
been erased completely yet. Notions ingrained over decades aren’t
wiped out overnight and there are still people in Cuba with no-
tions of white “superiority.” \

I met one such person in my visit there. He was the librarian
at one of the private clubs in‘ Havana. An old man, he told me
with a tremor in his voice that the public library across the street
now welcomed Negroes, but his library did not. ’

The real significance of that episode, though, was that he
felt the need to tell me this in a whisper. Whether he liked it or

10

 

 

‘not, he knew he was living in the past and that the whole weight
of Cuban society today is against him.

This tremendous achievement of the Cuban revolution has"

won the enthusiastic support of many civil-rights fighters in this

country. I’m confident it will win even more support as the truth

about Cuba becomes more widely known.

Rights advocates like William Worthy, Julian Mayfield, his-
torian W. E. B. DuBois; actor Ossie Davis, Robert F. Williams,
leader of the Monroe, N. C., NAACP, Richard Gibson of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee, and others, have declared their de-

termined opposition to any move to crush the Cuban revolution.

(See their public statement on page 15.)

In taking this stand they are motivated not only by support
of the social gains of the Cuban revolution and their feeling of
solidarity with the Cuban people. They correctly believe that every
blow struck at the Jim Crow system in Cuba is also a blow at that
system in this country. ,

They recognize that the dollar interests which fostered Jim
Crow in Cuba also foster it here. Their statement boldly declares:
“The enemies of the Cubans are our enemies, the Jim Crow bosses
of this land where we are still denied our rights.”

, By the same token, the Jim Crow bosses are determined to
crush the Cuban revolution because they understand that its suc-
cesses threaten them at home. Cuba is providing an example of

social progress and equality that strikes a chord of fear in the

heart of every racist in this country. .

That’s one of the reasons the gang of anti-Negro counter-
revolutionary Cuban exiles are receiving such powerful backing
in this country. And make no mistake about it. The Cuban coun-
ter-revolutionaries are racist to the core.

Proof of their racist position comes from one of the very few
Cuban Negroes working against the Castro government in this
country. Dr. J. R. Betancourt lists his alleged grievances against
the new Cuba in an article published in the May 1961 issue of
the NAACP magazine, The Crisis. (One of his complaints is that
the Cuban government now sponsors dances every weekend “in
select places which had previously barred Negroes.” The result,

he says, has been loss of business by the old clubs that catered’

exclusively to Negroes.)

Despite his zealous attacks on “communism”»in Cuba, Betan-
court seems to be having a hard time getting accepted by the
counter-revolutionaries. He writes: '

“They have formed many organizations of exiled Cubans to.

work for the overthrow of Castro and his Communist regime. All
are controlled by white Cubans, members of the upper or middle-
class . . . . Yet they do not exhibit the slightest interest in
the fate of the Cuban Negro . . . . None of these exile groups
have committed themselves to a non-discriminatory program
should they get in power.” ’ *

It’s no accident that these exile groups haven’t committed

11

 

themselves to such a program. The U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency isn’t financing them in order to improve Cuban race rela-
tions. That would be bad for the business of the dol1ar—hust1ing
tycoons who dream of re-establishing their domination of Cuba
through these exile hirelings. *
Those who are concerned with stamping out racism every-
where will take a different view of the matter. I

Julian Mayfield, in the article previously quoted, put it i

this way:

“The important lesson in the Cuban experience is that great
social change need not wait on the patient education of white
supremacists. A government that is sincere can show it means
business by imaginatively using its moral and legal weight to
destroy racism . . ’

“I know it would be naive to say there are no racists left
in Cuba. What matters is that the new government has snatched
away their power to deny a man a job, a house to live in, or a
chance-to realize his best potential because of his color.i

“That is why the Cubans of color are solidly behind the rev-
olution and are willing to die to keep it.” «

Everything I saw in Cuba confirms ‘what Mayfield says.
While visiting one of the new national parks (formerly one man’s
private estate), I talked with a bearded young Negro soldier who
had fought in the Sierra Maestra with Castro. ‘

He told me that he had always stood up against Jim Crow
but it wasn’t until he joined the rebel force that he felt he was
really getting somewhere. s ‘

' “It’s a wonderful thing,” he said, “to be fighting for some-
thing you have a stake in.”

I think every civil-rights partisan in our country has a stake
in that fight too. Not only because what is being accomplished
is good for the Cuban people but, equally, because it helps to
advance the fight for full equality in this country.

The need to speak up for fair play for Cuba — to demand that
Washington adopt a hands-off policy — is urgent. Powerful forces
in this country are still determined to crush the Cuban revolu-
tion even if it takes U.S. troops to do it and even if it brings the
world to the brink of a new war.

If they areipermitted a free hand to carry out their criminal
plan it will strengthen the hand of racism and reaction through-
out this country.

I don’t think they will succeed in carrying out their plan.
The tiny island of Cuba has unfettered a powerful force for social
progress based on the unity of its people in a fight forithe com-
mon good. The Cuban revolution will survive and will continue
to provide a splendid practical example ofthe way to destroy
Jim Crow. - '

More and more, people will realize: If the Cubans can build
a rational society based on equality and brotherhood, there’s no
good reason why we can’t do it here.

‘The Brotherhood of Whifes
And Negroes is Indispensable’

(The following excerpts from the Cuban Civic Training
Manual deal with the question of racial prejudice and discrimina-

tion; Published by the Ministry of Education, the civic manual is.
widely used in Cuba for adult education. It’s treatment of the race‘

question is a good example of what school text books and general
educational material in this country could and sho-uld be.)

There are those who justify racial discrimination, persuaded
that “Negroes constitute an inferior race.” In other countries like
the United States and South Africa, this racial prejudice, this

tenacious idea rooted in the mind for so long a time, brings men -

to the most bestial crimes — lynching, mass assassinations, per-
secution of Negro students, terrorist acts against Negroes’ homes,
death sentences for insignificant crimes, sometimes falsely at-
tributed to Negro citizens, etc.

But is there a scientific basis for believing that Negroes con-
stitute an inferior race . . .?

The very concept of race is much discussed. In the past nu-
merous authors have believed that different numbers of “races.”
existed. For one such author there are three such “races”; for
another there is more, up, to 34. According to Ferdinand Ortiz one
can’t properly speak of human races.

The most reasonable criteria is that there are human groups
differentiated among themselves by a series of external physical
characteristics which are transmitted by heredity. There are,
therefore, various basic racial groups which are given the name
caucasoid, negroid and mongoloid, the first corresponding to the
people known as whites; the second to the Negro people; and the
third to the Chinese and other Asian people, also to the primitive
inhabitants of America, etc.

In any case, the problem in Cuba is reduced to the existence
— to the separation —— of Whites and Negroes.

Whatever the racial groups being considered, the most in-
teresting thing is that among human beings the similarities are
more important than the differences . . . .

Science established with complete certainty that there are
neither superior or inferior races; therefore, the Negro is neither
superior nor inferior to the white. ,

In all times and places racism (and national hatred) have
been the means to oppress people. To justify colonial oppression
in Asia and Africa, the colonials invoked the “inferiority” ofthe
people. The anti—national groups in our country, the great in-
terests (foreign companies, large landholders, parasitic magnates)
found racial discrimination and the persistence of prejudice ben-
eficial and convenient, because they contributed to divisions among
the people and permitted them to have at their disposal a. reserve

13

 

labor force for the most arduous work and creating fears that _

maintain distrust‘ and weaken the Revolution . . . .

During the actual revolutionary process different forms of
racial prejudice were taken advantage of ' to put the brakes on
the Revolution. In the beginning, to split the Negro population

from the struggle against the tyranny, the reaction circulated the T

story that a “revolution of whites” was being brought about; but
after Fidel Castro’s firm anti-discriminatory stand of March 22,
1959, the reaction, in order to split the whites from the revolu-
tion, said, “This is a revolution for the Negroes.”

It is in reality a revolution for whites and Negroes, with all
racial groups identifying themselves with the nation’s progress.

As we have seen, humble white men and women don’t ben-
efit, but rather are immeasurably harmed, if they act in a preju-
diced way and discriminate against their Negro brothers . .

SlavehoIders' Weapon

Racial prejudice and discrimination in Cuba date from the
slave period during which it reached its greatest height. It was
necessary to proceed as if the slave was not a human being, or
was an inferior being, and it likewise suited the slaveholder to

make the slave believe this in order to dominate him‘ more easily.»

When slavery ended, there remained in society the same
discriminatory venom that used to justify it, since the criteria
of inferiority accumulated against those who were exploited as
slaves continued to be used once they were free to oppress them
and their descendants as Negroes.

The nature of the relationship of subordination that our coun-
try maintained until recently with the United States, where racial
segregation has so much virulence, also contributed to the per-
sistence in Cuba of discriminatory attitudes. This had a lot to do
with the fact that when the War of Independence was over the
foreign occupiers deprived humble Cubans, especially the Negroes,
of the opportunity to participate in the development and enjoy-
ment of the wealth of the country . . . .

Whites (Spaniards) and Negroes- (Africans) arrived in Cuba
at almost the same time. No factor contributed more vigorously
to the wealth of Cuba than the work of the Negro slave. , . .

Whites and Negroes participated together in the revolution-
ary war against Batista and his foreign protectors. /

The Cuban nation, then — its culture, its real independence
— is inconceivable if the Negro is left out of the historic past
and revolutionary present. The union and brotherhood of whites
and Negroes is indispensable for the triumph of the Revolution. . . .

There is a lot to do — and it must be d ne — so that our
revolution prevents racial discrimination and ugroots racial preju-
dice from the minds of all citizens.

"Cuba—A Declaration of Conscience"

This advertisement appeared in the Afro-American April 22 and
29 and in the New York Post April 25, 1961,

316 3|: it

Because we have known oppression, because we have suffered
more than other Americans, because we are still fighting for our own
liberation from tyranny, we Afro-Americans have the right and the
duty to raise our voices in protest against the forces of oppression
that now seek to crush a free people linked to us by bonds of blood
and a common heritage. ’

One-third of Cuba's people are Afro-Cubans, of the same African
descent as we. Many of our own forefathers passed through Cuba on
their way tq the slave plantations in the United States. Those who
remained on the island knew the same brutality that their brothers
suffered on the mainland; after emancipation, they too knew disen-
franchisement, they too became second-class citizens, peons exploited
on the huge U.S.-owned landholdings.

Today — thanks to a social revolution which they helped make -
Afro-Cubans are first-class citizens and are taking their rightful place
in the life of their country where all racial barriers crumbled in a
matter of weeks following the victory of Fidel Castro.

Now our brothers are threatened again — this time by a gang of
ousted Cuban political hacks who find segregated Miami more con-
genial than integrated Havana. This pack of mercenaries who hope
to turn back the clock in Cuba are armed, trained and financed by
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. But they know that by them-
selves they can never re-enslave the Cuban people, so now they are
openly boasting that U.S. troops will go to their aid as soon as they
land in Cuba.

This criminal aggression against a peaceful and progressive people
must not be allowed to happen. But if it does, we are determined to
do all we possibly can to hinder the success of this crime.

Afro-American correspondent William Worthy declared recently:
“If Cuba is attacked, I and others who know the facts will denounce
the attack as an evil, and wicked colonial war deserving of opposition
and resistance by Afro-Americans.” Worthy warned that,. if such an
attack, took place: “In this country we would see civil rights setbacks
from coast to coast. Our enemies would be strengthened and em-
boldened.”

Afro-Americans, don't be fooled —— the enemies of the Cubans
are our enemies, the Jim Crow bosses of this land where we are still
denied our rights. The Cubans are our friends, the enemies of our
enemies.

T INTRODUCTION

Drawa semi-circle on the map of the western hemisphere
from Rio de Janeiro to Boston and Within this semi—circle you
will have vaguely outlined what might becalled “black America,”
Within this area lies most of Brazil, the Guianas, Venezuela,
Colombia, Ecuador,‘ Panama, the West Indies Federation, Mar-
tinique, Guadalupe, bHaiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico,
Cuba and the southeastern portion of the United States.

Here is to be found the largest concentration of persons of
African descent outside the continent of Africa itself. In only a
few places do black men and Women make up the majority of the
population, butalmost everywhere they form a substantial por-
tion. And their labor power is essential in agriculture and industry.

Black has almost become synonymous with poor, and these
descendants of African slaves in many cases have been left prac-
tically as impoverished as their forefathers. They are landless
peasants’ who make up a rural proletariat or, where there is some
industry, they are only permitted to occupy the bottom rungs of
the ladder of the industrial hierarchy. They are the people with
the highest amount of illiteracy, and no schools. They are exposed
to every disease and social plague, and yet have no hospitals.

, They have no vote or, if there is some sort of formal democracy,

their ballots mean little in the organized deceptions of electoral
campaigns. Besides, they have far more serious problems — such

as finding their next meal.

The Whifes Suffer Too

Within this same area) live many white people and many of
them exist quite as miserably as their black neighbors. These

whites also suffer from malnutrition, illiteracy, ‘disease, economic,

exploitation and political oppression. Logically, they should be
the natural allies of the blacks in the struggle for a better life,
but that is rarely the case, even in Latin countries Where racial
discrimination is far more “subtle” than the North American
variety, whether of the South or the Northern ghettoes.

Even a hasty examination of the contradictions of power and

Wealth in this part of the Americas will reveal that any pro— ’

found revolutionary change can only be _made by an alliance of
the dispossessed and the disenfranchised of both races. But there

is an enormous difference between paying lip-service to such a
revolutionary unity——in the time—worn manner of many‘ U.S.
“liberals”——and actually forging that unity in action. It is not
enough merely to combat racism; one must fight the vast social

evil, the system which fosters racism as a means of p-erpetuatm

ing its domination of the economic, political and social lives of
men, regardless of the color of their skin.

Cuba’s revolutionary leaders, from the days of José Marti
to Fidel Castro, have been well aware of this. And the history of
their victorious struggle is the first record we have of genuine
revolutionary unity being forged between white and black Amer-
icans. ,

Yet, during the revolutionary battles and in the first months
after the triumph of the revolution, there were many who feared
that Fidel and those around him were “going too. far.” There
were even some who expressed the fear that Fidel himself might
be sowing “racial discord” by declaring himself so passionately
against all the vestiges of racism in Cuban life.

For their part, Afro—Cubans were cautious at first. A few
slogans were not enough to prompt them to commit themselves
to the revolution. After all, they could recall the early days of
his regime when dictator Fulgencio Batista was boasting about
his “mixed” blood. But Fidel Castro’s 26th of July Movement
was concerned with people, not slogans, and it had the desire
and the will and the ability to do something. And Afro-Cubans
joined in that battle, as Harry Ring has authoritatively reported
in this pamphlet. _ ’

In that struggle, as Harry Ring has stated, the Negro people
of Cuba became “theifirst of any country in the Americas to win
full economic, social and political equality.” It is worth recalling
that the white people of Cuba also won their economic, social and
political freedom. With-out one there never would have been the
-other. This is one of the most important lessons that the Cuban
Revolution has for us in the United States, as well as demonsrating
once and for all that the forces of racism and oppression in this
hemisphere are not invincible‘. i

How Cuba Uprooted
Race Discrimination

During a visit to Cuba in the summer of 1960 I met a young
woman who symbolized one of the most inspiring and dramatic
accomplishments of the revolution there.

She was a Negro, in her late teens. We met on a bus tour into
the countryside. During our conversation, I asked her what she
did.

She replied that she was studying surveying and that when

the course was completed that year she would go on to the Uni- \

versity of Havana to become a civil engineer.

An obvious thought came into my mind: Could she pursue
such a career if she lived in the United States?

In Cuba today the Negro people have entered a new era. Be-
fore the revolution Jim Crow flourished. It took a somewhat dif-
ferent form than it does here but the net result was just as
vicious and degrading.

Yet in less than three years the revolution has wiped out
racial discrimination almost completely. V ‘

The revolution is making remarkable progress in solving the
basic social problems that beset the long-exploited Cuban people,
both black and white. Under U.S. domination, the island had been
converted into a vast sugar plantation that provided back-break-
ing, low-paying work three or four months of the year and wide-
spread hunger the rest of the time. Now the new government is
developing a diversified economy capable of providing both em-
ployment and the goods the people need.

Unemployment has been sharply reduced and within a few
years the problem should be eliminated altogether. Thousands of
dispossessed farmers are being given their own piece of land or
the opportunity to join flourishing farm cooperatives.

‘Miserable slums are being rapidly replaced by beautiful,
low-cost homes. Hospitals and clinics are being built on an ade-
quate scale for the -first time in Cuban history. Public beaches
that ordinary people can afford to go to have been opened for

the first time in the island’s history. '

Schools have sprung up like mushrooms and an army of
teachers, professional and volunteer, are waging a dramatic one-
year campaign to wipe outilliteracy. .

Rents have been cut in half and soon the Urban Reform Law
will eliminate the landlord—tenant system altogether. One of the
aims of the revolution is to make every Cuban a home-owner.

The colored citizens of Cuba, who constitute about 27 per
cent of the island’s population of 6.5 million, have benefited im-
mensely from this program of social progress. A whole new way

4

, of life has opened for a segment of the people who before the rev-
_ \olution lived with the same fate as the Negro people of our coun-
I try——“the last hired and the first fired.” ’

By the same token, Cuban Negroes generally lived in the
worst homes, had the least opportunity for schooling and. for
careers for their children. They suffered the most from the absence
of medical care. I

In the new Cuba, the Negro has come into his ‘own. I visited
a beautiful new housing development in Havana and knocked at
a door at random. The lady of the house was a Negro in her
thirties. She spoke good English and told me she had lived in
Brooklyn for several years. She had come to the United States
because under Batista there had been no work.

After the revolution she returned home, married, and now
has a baby.

In Brooklyn, she said, she earned $40 a week working in a
laundry. For a tiny one-room “furnished apartment” in the Jim
Crow Bedford-Stuyvesant district she had paid a rent of _$95
a month. _ — .

Now she and her family live in a spacious, ranch-style, five-
room house with a lawn in front and garden in the rear.

The cost of their lovely new home? Just $18.66 a month. And
that’s not rent. In 25 years ‘it will belong to them.

Because they are sharing in the benefits of the revolution
that they played a big part in making, the colored people of
Cuba are solid supporters of the Castro government. But their
devotion to the revolution springs from somethingeven more basic
than approval of the general gains it has achieved.

The Negro people of Cuba are the first of any country in
the Americas to win full economic, «social and political equality.

_ This wasn’t a victory that came quickly or easily. The his-
tory of the struggle for first-class citizenship in Cuba has many
parallels with the history of that struggle in this country.

Negroes were brought to Cuba as slaves at about the same.
time they were brought to this country and slavery was not
abolished in Cuba until several decades after it ended here.

Like here, the Negroes played a decisive and heroic role in

I the abolition movement which was part of the long fight to, win
independence from Spain. Negro troops and leaders were in the
forefront of that fierce, bloody struggle.

But like here, the end of slavery in Cuba did not bring full
citizenship for the Negro people. The fight for equal rights had
to be fought continuously on every front--the right to a decent
job, the right to patronize public places on the same basis as
whites, the right to equal political opportunity and representation.

The struggle was a bitter one and there were several armed

’ uprisings of the Cuban Negroes. One of these uprisings, in 1912,
was crushed with the aid of U.S. marines.

5

 

For the Negro people of Cuba, the revolution led by Castro.

was the climax of their long battle against racial discrimination.
Their spectacular victory in breaking the back of the Jim Crow
system, I think, offers much food for thought for the civil-rights
movement in our country.

The Cuban victory over Jim Crow explodes the theory of

. ‘‘gradualism.’’ Resolute revolutionary action in Cuba has accom-

plished more in 30 months than has been achieved by a century
of “gradua1ism” in the United States.

At the same time, in my opinion, revolutionary Cuba also
demonstrates the incorrectness of the Negro Nationalists who
preach that Negroes must separate themselves from whites be-
cause they can never win equality in a country where whites are
a majority of the population.

Cuba is also showing that the practical way to abolish Jim
Crow is tostrike directly at its social and economic roots. Jim
Crow isn’t being liquidated in Cuba by futile appeals to the
“hearts” and “good will” of those who profit from the racist
system. ‘

The results of Cuba’s revolutionary approach to the question
of race relations has been strikingly apparent to those visitors
concerned with the problem. (That’s undoubtedly one of the rea-
sons the State Department put a ban on travel there.)

Negro journalists who" visited there have given eloquent tes-
timony to the contrast between race relations in Cuba and here.

.Reporting from Havana in the Jan. 16, 1960, Pittsburgh
Courier, William G. Nunn, Sr., wrote: “My impressions, and they
must remain just that, are that I have seen democracy in action.

“I’ve experienced the thing which Negro Americans have
dreamed about happening in their own country. . . . The Castro
regime has pushed into the limbo of the forgotten past the hated
color schism which has divided the people.” ,

The distinguished foreign -correspondent, William Worthy,
had this to say in the Sept. 24, 1960, A;f'ro—Ame'rica»n:

“If I was a colored parent, eager to raise my children free
of racial complexes and ingrained subservience, I would at any

sacrifice treat them to at least one impressionable year in reVolu- _

tionary non-discriminatory Cuba where the free and unse1f—con-
scious mixing of races and complexions is startling to an out-
sider. . . ‘

“If white Americans had brainwashed me to accept ‘modera-
tion and gradualism’ in the fight for civil rights, if I believed
that revolutionary steps against job and housing discrimination
werenjt feasible, I would test my theories against Fidel Castro’s
bold measures that overnight established equality as’ the law of
the land, as the rigid policy of the government and as the day-by-
day habits of the citizenry.”

To undercut the effects of reports like these, supporters of
the hate-Cuba campaign in the United States have tried to argue

_ that the civil-rights stand of the Castro government isn’t anything "4 _

to get excited about because there never was any real race dis-
crimination in Cuba.

They point to the fact that there has always been wide—scale
intermarriage in Cuba; that Negroes weren’t forced into segregated
neighborhoods and schools; that they were employed in many
skilled trades; and that a number of prominent politicians, includ-
ing ex—di-ctator Batista, were of mixed ancestry.

,What these people are really saying is that the Jim Crow
system in Cuba wasn’t identical to the one here. But the record
shows that Jim Crow did exist in an acute form there.

For example, the Cuban Committee for the Rights of Negroes
issued a report in 1934 which said: “There are industries Where
they cannot work; in commerce, in the great foreign enterprises,
above all, Negroes are not employed. In certain industries they
work where the pay is least: for example in the graphic arts
they may be compositors, but seldom linotypers; in the tobacco
industry they are cigar-makers and strippers, but not sorters or
trimmers, who are the employees who earn the best wages.”

Lip Service to Equality
In his book, Rural Cuba (University of Minnesota, 1950),

iisociologist Nelson Lowry wrote: “While orators on Memorial

Day (Dec. 7) pay glowing tribute to one of the greatest national
heroes of the War of Independence, the colored General Antonio
Maceo, no man of color seems to have been appointed in recent
years to the council of ministers, and only rarely to immediately
subordinate positions. Some colored politicians get elected to the
national Congress, although not in ratio which the colored popula-
tion bears to, the total.‘ The governing class, in other words, is
predominantly white and appears to regard affairs of state as a
White preserve. . . . _

“It cannot be denied that there is consciousness of color in
Cuba, although it is‘ true that color plays a less conspicuous’ role
than it does in the United States. While the man of color pervades
practically all of the occupations, he is predominantly in those
which are further down the social hierarchy. The clubs which are
so important in urban social life in Cuba are strictly on a color

- basis. The various yacht -clubs are strictly white. If the colored

people want club life they must provide their own, also on an
exclusive basis.” .

A 1935 Foreign Policy Association report on Problems of the
New Cuba offered this information:

“Negroes have continued to perform the manual labor to
which they were accustomed under slavery. In the towns they
are found in domestic service, in the ports many of them work
as stevedores, in the sugar country Negroes cut a large part of
the sugar cane . . .

“During the revolutions of 1868 and 1895 the White Cubans
and Negroes were drawn closely together against Spain. . . .

Because of this historic association and the general Latin attitude
toward interracial relations, racial prejudice in Cuba has not
been nearly so acute as in Anglo-Saxon countries. It seems true,
however, that it has increased during the past few years. This is
attributed partly to the unconscious influence of the American
point of view and partly to economic distress.”

Such reports do more than confirm that a Jim Crow system
did exist in Cuba. They also offer a solid clue as to who» was
responsible for it.

When the Spanish imperialists were ‘driven out of ‘Cuba at
the end of the last century a new colonial power began to move
in. U.S. business interests —— sugar, fruit, utilities, banking,.gamb-
ling, tourism — became the dominant force in internal Cuban
affairs. V

And these interests brought with them a product “made in
the USA” — the doctrine of white supremacy.

A wedge was driven between black and white to shatter the

unity established in the struggle against Spain. Jim Crow began _

to reappear throughout Cuban society. The old game of divide-
and—rule was played for all it was worth by the U.S. corporations
and their Cuban political stooges.
Every Cuban that you talk to will explain that the worst job
discrimination was that of the North American companies.
Social discrimination? How could Negroes be permitted ac-

. cess to hotels, clubs and casinos? That would be “bad” for the

tourist trade!

The role of the U.S. companies in re-establishing Jim Crow
in Cuba also helps to explain the present government’s determina-
tion to wipe out racial injustices.

The aim of the Cuban revolutionaries when they organized
their heroic — and integrated — rebel band in the Sierra Maestra
mountains was to end the Batista tyranny and bring independence
and democracy to the island. «

To achieve this goal, they had to end thepower of U.S. busi-
ness interests over the country’s economic and political life.

When the power of the North American corporations was .

broken in Cuba the basis of the Jim Crow system was shattered.

But that was only the beginning of a process that is still go-
ing on. The old Cuban politicians and the dollar interests that
kept them in power had a vested interest_in preserving the Jim
Crow system. The revolutionary government, on the contrary, has
no other source of power than the people themselves. Such a ‘gov-
ernment can endure only if the people are completely united. (It
was this unity of the Cuban people that smashed the CIA-spon-
sored invasion in April 1961.)

Castro and his associates came to ‘power with deep anti-
racist convictions. (Castro was already known in his student days
as an outspoken opponent of Jim Crow.) But even more impor-
tant than their personal sense of decency and fair play was their

clear understanding that the revolution could survive only if the
people were united.

Four months after Castro came to power, the April 16, 1959,
issue of Jet magazine reported: _

'_“Already the bearded leader who led his integrated rag-tag
rebel army out of the swollen Sierra Maestra mountains into
Havana . . . . has called for an'end to racial discrimination and
urged fair employment practices regardless of color. . . .

“Castro told the nation in a radio address that racial dis-
crimination is a scheme to divide Cuba against itself, warned
that Cuba has enough enemies on the outside, then warming to

his subject, Castro cited the part Negroes had played in the

Revolution . . . . Thenin the bluntest terms of all he told Cubans
there was no such thing as a ‘pure Caucasian.’ Pointing to those

proud of their Spanish ancestry, lecturer Castro said Moors from-

Africa dominated Spain for 800 years, added that all of ‘us’ have
African blood.”

Three-Fronf Campaign

The campaign of the Cuban government to abolish Jim Crow
has proceeded on three major fronts — by example; by cracking
down on those who practice discrimination; and by broad popular
education to erase prejudice from the minds of the rank-and-file
white citizenry.

The example has been set with the creation of a thoroughly
integrated government. This hasn’t been done by appointing a few
Negroes to minor posts for the sake of “window dressing.” Negroes
have the unrestricted opportunity to rise in the government “on
the basis of ability and they are using that new opportunity.

These are some of the high officials in the new Cuba who
are Negroes: Juan Almeida, commander of the Rebel Army;
Carlos Oliveras, deputy minister of foreign affairs; Antonio Gaucet,
assistant secretary of labor; and Calixto Garcias, chief of the mili-
tary district of Oriente province.

Government officials consciously work to educate the people
by example. Author Julian Mayfield offered one such example
in an Oct. 1, 1960, article in the Afro—America'n:

“At the climax of the carnival season in 1959 when the queen
was chosen, the government was represented by the chief of the
army, a black man, who placed the crown upon her head and,
as tradition demanded, was honored by the first dance with her.

“The upper classes were astonished. But this year when the
revolutionaries repeated their bold act, the event passed almost
unnoticed.” -

Mayfield also explains how government and union hiring
services have eliminated discrimination in employment:

“The proprietor of a barber shop in a lush hotel like the
Havana Libre (formerly the Havana Hilton) would never have
considered hiring a colored barber before the revolution.- Now
