countries, a war in which there will be no distinction between
front and rear, a war of destrfiction of everything which makes
the life of a present-day cultured nation possible. The next war
will be a war against the workers, against women and children;
it will be a war of extermination. It will be a fascist war.
(From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International.) ~

POVERTY, DEATH AND SUFFERING FOR THE TOILERS-—VAST
PROFITS FOR THE CAPITALISTS

W arr involves slaughter and nameless swﬂerings for the toilers,
and proﬁts and monstrous super-proﬁts for capitalism.

For the workers and peasants 1914- to 1918 meant twenty
million dead, thirty million maimed, ruin and devastation of
their homes. But for the Krupps and Schneiders, the Bethlehem
Steels and Vickers—bi1lions in surplus proﬁts never before at-
tained. In the United States, for example, the Du Pont Com-
pany (explosives) ﬁgured its war proﬁts in 1918 at $246,000,000,
or 1,130 per cent of the pre-war proﬁts! Numerous scandals
throughout the world, especially in-France, Germany and the
United States, have sufficiently proved that during the last World
War, while soldiers guilty of fraternization were shot, the ex-
ploiters—for whose interests they were sent to the slaughter——-
sold “the enemy,” the raw materials and the machines it lacked
to continue the war against their own country!

, And, more recently did not the Sena.te Inquiry Committee in
Washington prove in 1934- that Skoda———controlled by Schneider
——furnished large quantities of arms and munitions to Hitler to
establish his dictatorship? Did not the same Inquiry Committee
show the Aircraft Company, the Du Pont Company, etc., at work
supplyingllitler with large deliveries of airplanes and explo-
sives? Do we not see at the present time the Suez Canal Com-
pany cynically calculating that the. transit of 120,000 Italian
soldiers to Ethiopia yielded it £90,000 in additional proﬁts?

This explains the interest of its shareholders in having the
largest possible number slaughtered in ‘Ethiopia so that as many
troops as possible may pass through the canal, causing dividends
to rise.

10

 

 

War is necessarily military dictatorship over’ the whole
country.

Over the whole cou.ntry——-and not merely in a few regions
as in 1914-18. It has been well established, in fact, that the
war of tomorrow will be a total war. Employing aerial gas
bombardments of big industrial centers, it will abolish the old
distinction between civilians and the military, between the front
and the rear.

Imperialist war would mean the destructio-n of the vestiges
of democratic liberties, wherever they still exist; it would mean
the suppression of the rights of association, of free assembly, of
freedom for the labor press, already so restricted. It would
mean the destruction of all workers’ organizations and a free
ﬁeld for the fascists. It would mean a tremendous increase in the
exploitation and oppression of the working class, and requisitions
in the countryside. It would mean a regime of forced labor for
the colonial peoples. To an extent a million times as great as in
1914-18, it would mean the atrocious rule of the gallows, of tor-
ture and murder by the fascist gangs. »

Who paid and who is paying the costs of the imperialist grea
war of 1914-18?‘ -‘

Those who were sent to the slaughter by the bourgeoisie and
by the abominable treason of Social-Democracy—the toilers,
“victors” or “vanquished”———are still paying today all the costs
through their reduced wages and crushing taxes. '

Even those whom the bourgeoisie wanted to win over, the
ex-servicemen, these victims with mangled bodies, with burned

lungs, with blinded eyes, now see their meager pensions cut still '

more in all capitalist countries. ,

While the capitalists, on the c0ntrary—-—"‘victors” and “van-
quished”—whose dividends sky-rocketed during the four years of
slaughter, have invested gigantic sums in new modernized enter-
prises, and are making exorbitant proﬁts from them in spite of the
crisis.

In short, the poor have sacriﬁced everything, and are paying
the expenses of a war that served only the interests of their
exploiters. The rich have made enormous proﬁts in this gigantic
enterprise of destruction. '

11

 

Imperialist wars are proﬁtable only for the exploiters, for
the capitalists; they bleed, they‘ annihilate the proletarians, the
toiling masses of all countries. (From a speech delivered by
Andre Marty at the Seventh Congress of the Communist Inter-
national.)

WHAT ARE THE CAUSES oF WAR?

War is inseparable from capitalism. The struggle against
war, above all, calls fora clear insight into its nature, causes,
etc. . . .
The cause of war as an historic phenomenon is not the “evil
nature” of mankind, not the “bad” policies of governments, but
the division of society into classes, into exploiters and exploited.
Capitalism is the cause of wars in modern history. These wars
are not exceptional phenomena; they do not contradict the prin-
eiples of capitalism, of private ownership in the means of produc-
tion, of competition and exploitation, but are rather their direct
consequence. Imperialism, the monopolist stage of capitalism,
sharpens all the contradictions of capitalism to such an extent
that “peace” becomes but a breathing spell for new wars. The
surface of the earth and its economic wealth (with the exception
of that part which is ruled by the proletarian dictatorship)
is almost completely monopolized by a few big powers.

The uneven economic and political development of the vari-
ous countries, however, again and again creates the necessity
for a new division of the World. In the last analysis, this cannot
take place except through wars waged by the decisive imperialist
countries against one another. At the same time, however, the
exploitation of the hundreds of millions of proletarians and
colonial slaves can be maintained only by bloody wars of op-
pression. (From the Theses of the Sixth Congress of the Com-
munist International on the measures of struggle against the
danger of imperialist wars, Part II.)

‘Two Worlds——Victorious Socialism and

g 1 Belligcrcnt Fascism

FASCISM AND REACTION ARE PREPARING WAR AGAINST
THE SOVIET UNION

THE basic contradiction, that between the socialist and the
capitalist world, has become still more acute. . . .

Although the acuteness of the imperialist contradictions ren-
ders the formation of an anti-Soviet bloc difﬁcult at the present
moment, the fascist governments and war parties in the capitalist
countries endeavor to solve these contradictions at the expense of
the fatherland of all the toilers, at the expense of the Soviet
Union. (From “The Tasks of the Communist International in
Connection with the Preparations of the Imperialists for a New
World War”, Resolution of the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International on the Report of M. Ercoii.)

THE MIGHT OF THE SOVIET UNION HAS GROWN C-ONSIDERABLY

The changes in the relation of forces which have taken place‘

in the Soviet Union in recent years, and which are an expression
of the ﬁnal and irrevocable Victory of socialism over capitalism
gave a death blow _to these criminal plans of attack against the
Soviet Union. They have destroyed any possibility of the counter-
revolutionary armies of intervention receiving support within the
U.S.S.R. from the classes hostile to the dictatorship of the
proletariat.

The tremendous authority enjoyed by the ‘Soviet Union not

13

only among the Communist vanguard, but also among Social-
Democratic and non-party worlgers, among the small peasants,
the petty bourgeoisie, the intel5lectuals and the youth, the fact
that millions of people are ready to ﬁght for the defense of the
Soviet Union with all their strength, are among the very important
‘factors responsible for the fact that the country of the dictator-
ship of the proletariat has so strong a position as against the
capitalist states.

Taking all these elements into consideration, the conclusion
that we must reach is that the relations between the Soviet Union
and the capitalist states have entered a new phase, the basic
feature of which is the growing authority of the countryof the
dictatorship of the proletariat and its peace policy. (From M.
Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist In-
ternational.)

THE ANTI-IMPERIALIST MIGHT OF THE CHINESE RED ARMY
HAS ALSO GROWN CONSIDERABLY

During the year and a half which has elapsed since the Thir-
teenth Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist In-
ternational, the Chinese Red Army has won a great new victory.
Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party and the Central Soviet government of China the main
forces of the Red Army in the former Central Soviet district of
Kiangsi-Fukien not only successfully slipped through the stra-
tegic encirclement byiChiang Kai-shek’s army, which was almost
a million strong, but also broke through the enemy’s ring on
the southern and western fronts and accomplished the he-roic
march from Kiangsi to Northwestern China. By passing through
nine provinces, overcoming the difficulties presented by the high
mountain ranges, lack of roads, and mighty rivers '(Wukiang,
Yangtze, Chinsa-kiang, Tatu Ho, etc.), by ﬁghting through a
distance of over three thousand kilometers, the main forces of
the Chinese Red Army displayed heroism and accomplished mili-
tary feats unexampled in the history of the Civil War. The Red
Army carried out in time the general plan of crossing into
Szechwan, joined forces with another principal part of the Red
Army (the Fourth Army) in the vicinity of the city of Chengtu

14-

 

 

... . —.-,-w-wm—n--«-nous-o.-vuvmaunsav. 

 

and, together" with the Fourth Army, created a new Central
Soviet district on part of the territory of the provinces of Kwei-

chow, Szechwan, Sikang, Yunan, Kansu and Shensi of such size '

and strength as was previously unknown. . . .

The fact that the slogans of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China to increase the numerical strength of
the regular units of the Red Army to one million men and to
extend the territory of the Soviet districts to include a population
of one hundred million people can already be fully realized in
the very near future is another proof of the great victory of the
Red Army. (From a speech delivered by Wang Ming at the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.) ' ”

“BUT THE CAPITALIST WORLD DOES NOT WANT TO ALLOW THE
SOCIALIST SYSTEM To DEVELOP PEACEFULLY”

The U.S.S.R. needs no foreign wars for the purpose of trans-
forming the world. The people themselves will rise against their
oppressors and do that. The U.S.S.R. needs‘ no wars because in
the competition between the two world systems it is the system
of socialism that is winning every day; for it shows the wo-rld
its superiority over the capitalist system. If the world bour-
geoisie left our country in peace for a decade it would be able
by its socialist achievements to convince the vast masses of hu-
manity all over the world of the superiority of its system and
would transform even the most “peaceful” people who now
serve as the bulwark of capitalism into revolutionaries opposed
to capitalism.

But the capitalist world does not want to allow the socialist

system to develop peacefully. It cannot exist without wars, and '

it is pulling the toilers, full steam ahead, into new wars. (From
D. Z. Manuilsky’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International.)

Who Are the Chief Fomenters of War? '

WHO IS DRIVING MATTERS TO A NEW 

JAPANESE imperialism, waging war in the Far East, has already
made a start toward a new repartition of the world. Japan’s
rapacious expedition is already leading to the weakening of the
inﬂuence of British ‘and American imperialism in China, is men-
acing the position of Great Britain and the U.S.A. in the Paciﬁc
and is preparing for al counter-revolutionary war against the
Soviet Union.

Being the chief instigators of war, the German fascists, who
strive for the hegemony of German imperialism in Europe, raise
the question of changing the boundaries of Europe at the expense
of their neighbors by means of war. The adventurist plans of
the German fascists are very far-reaching and count on a war
of revenge against France, dismernberment of Czechoslovakia,
annexation of Austria, destruction of the independence of the
Baltic states, which they are striving to convert into a base for
attack on the Soviet Union, and the wresting of the Soviet Ukraine
from the U.S.S.R.

German imperialism has found an ally in Europe-—fascist
Poland, which is also striving to extend its territory at the ex-
pense of Czechoslovakia, Baltic countries and the Soviet Union.

The dominant circles of the British bourgeoisie support the
German armaments. By this policy Great Britain is striving to
set up a counterbalance to the United Statcs on a world-wide
scale and, simultaneously, to strengthen the anti-Soviet tenden-

16

 

 

eies not only of Germany but also of Japan and Poland. This
policy of British imperialism is one of the factors accelerating
the outbreak of a world imperialist war. .

Italian imperialism is directly proceeding to the seizure of
Ethiopia, thus creating new tension in the relations between the
great imperialist powers. (From “The Tasks of the Communist
International in Connection with the Preparations of the Impe-
rialists for a New World War”, Resolution of the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International on the Report of M. Ercoli.)

HITLER GERMANY IS THE CHIEF FOMENTER OF WAE

The German fascist government has introduced general con-
scription. It has incorporated the German civil air ﬂeet into
the military air force. The law of the fascist murder regime on the
introduction of conscription means the open carrying out of
the hitherto secret arming and a feverish increase of this arming.
It furnishes the war parties of all the imperialist countries with
a new pretext for increasing the insane armaments competition.

The German fascists, by creating an instrument of murder
which even surpasses the pre-war army of hated Prussian mili-
tarism, further increase the international tension. The Hitler
government is placing war immediately on the order of the day.
It immediately threatens the neighboring countries. The German
fascists are deliberately heading for a new imperialist world war.
They are directing the points of their bayonets, the mouths of
their guns, their airplanes against the land of socialist construc-
tion, against the Soviet Union, against the ﬁrm walls of which
every wave of fascism beats in vain. (From the Appeal of the

Communist Parties of Germany, France, Great Britain, Poland, «

Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Austria, Hungary and Lithuania,
April 1, 1935.) I A

GERMAN FASCISM AND THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT

German fascism masks its war provocation by the demand for
the liberation and uniﬁcation of all Germans living in Europe.
In reality, the task it sets itself is that of establishing its own
hegemony on the Europe-an continent, and it counts on attaining
this aim by leading a crusade of reaction against the U.S.S.R.

17

 

  

. ..This fundamental direction of the foreign policy of
National-Socialism is conﬁrmed by all the activity of the leaders
of the “Third Empire”, by evenything _th3y have done since their
advent to power. The stubborn, refusal to sign a pact guaran-
teeing peace and the frontiers in Eastern Europe is not the least
important manifestation of this activity. On May 21, this year,
in his last speech on German, foreign policy, in a speech which
is the height of hypocrisy and demagogy, Hitler o-nce again con-
firmed that the entire policy of National-Socialismvis aimed at an
attack against the Soviet Union.

Indeed, no contrast is as profound as that existing between

ztheecountry of the dictatorship of Hitler fascism and the country

of the dictatorship of the proletariat. German fascism is the in-
stigator of the most raging capitalist reaction, of bloody oppres-
sion of the workers, the toiling peasants, the national minorities
and the entire German people. The Soviet Power means the
liberty of the working class, the liberation of all toilers from
all forms of oppression and exploitation, the right of self-deter-
mination for all peoples. The Soviet Power is the champion of

the liberation of all humanity. Fascist Germany is the reign of

the magnates of capital and of the feudal landowners. The
Soviet Union is the country of emancipated labor, of conscious
discipline, of the most advanced culture and progress. German

fascism, which is the instigator of the civil war of the dying

bourgeoisie against the proletariat, is likewise the champion of
war against the country of ‘the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The basis of the war propaganda carried on by the fascist press
in calling for the “extirpation of Bolshevism” is, along with rabid
imperialist aggression, rabid class hatred of the most reactionary
sections of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. (From
M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist
International. )

JAPAN--THE MOST AGGRESSIVE OF THE IMPERIALIST POWERS

The imperialist power that is the most aggressive, that is
feverishly preparing for war, and is already waging war, is with-
out doubt Japan. . . . i

The aim pursued by imperialist Japan and openly avowed by

18

 

 

its statesmen is the establishment of Japanese hegemony not
merely in the Far East, but in all Eastern Asia and along th
western shores of the Paciﬁc Ocean. '
The growing strength of the ‘Soviet Union and of the Red
Army drives the most aggressive Japanese militarists to co-me
out against any postponement of the war and in favor of using

ppzallppproppgrtygigities as rapidly as possible and ﬁnding allies that

could enable them to begin the war today instead of putting it
off until tomorrow.

This tendency to accentuate the situation in the Far East dom-
inates the whole of Japanese policy; it was manifested by the
refusal to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union,
by the intrigues through which Japanese diplomacy links itself
with the instigators of war and the enemies of the Soviet Union
in Europe, by the increased war preparations now being carried
outiby the Japanese generals in Manchuria, by the feverish con-
struction in the latter region of new railway lines and strategic
roads, by efforts to create an autonomous industrial base on the
Asiatic continent, in Manchuria, for the Japanese army, by the
continued provocations on the Soviet frontiers on the part of
aggressive Japanese-Manchurian circles and their repeated efforts
to provoke conflict with the Mongolian People’s Republic.

The policy of expansion pursued by the Japanese generals
is the most reactionary class policy. Their bayonets are directed
primarily and above all against the revolution, but the forces
of the revolution will unite and ﬁght with the utmost vigor and
enthusiasm to foil their criminal plans. (From M. Ercoli’s Re-
port to the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

ITALIAN FASCISM’S ATTACK ON ETHIOPIA

By the example of Italy we clearly see that the fascist regime

' is inevitably drawn into war in Virtue of its policy and in ‘virtue

of the contradictions of this policy. . . . ~
The conﬂict with Ethiopia is likewise the last stage of th
evolution of the nationalist and chauvinist "demagogy of fascism,
the conclusion of the so-called people’s campaigns with the aid
of which fascism has endeavored to deceive the masses. Fascism
has launched new demagogic campaigns at each diﬂiculty, at

each aggravation of the co'untry’s situation. But a moment comes
when all demagogy ceases to avail and fascism, under the whip
of its own unbridled chauvinisrh, under the drive of the bour-
geois groups that are most interested in a warlike outcome,
precipitates itself into the war which it has preached as a healing
remedy for the world and as an inevitable necessity for the solu-
tion of the problems facing the world. War is the last wisdom of
fascist regimes. The bellicose campaign of Italy in eastern
Africa has had as its consequence the accentuation of its rela-
tions with the big capitalist powers, not only in the area affected
by the Italian attack, but in all other areas as well. In Europe,
the repercussions of this campaign are already today extremely
powerful and will become still stronger if an armed conﬂict
breaks out. In fact, there is not a single capitalist state which is
not directly or indirectly affected by this conﬂict.

The impossibility of erecting barriers to separate the differ-
ent points of friction between the big imperialist powers, the
impossibility of localizing any conﬂict breaking out between
them is plainly shown by the example of Ethiopia. Peace is in-
divisible. _ '

The attack of fascist Italy on Ethiopia will inevitably result
in a new sharpening of the antagonisms and open struggle be-
tween the imperialist world and the colonial peoples. For the time
being the struggle of the Negro peoples o-f Central and Eastern
Africa, which has been going on for decades, has been in abey-
ance. During these decades the Negroes in Africa have been
subjected to a regime not only of exploitation and enslavement
but of veritable physical extermination. The crisis years accen-
tuated the horrors of the colonial regime enforced by the Euro-
peans on the immense black continent. On the other hand, in
the war which they waged in Libya in 1924-29, the Italian fas-
cists gave a proof how fascism conducts its colonizing activity.
In this sphere also, fascism has proved to be the most barbarous
form of the domination of the bourgeoisie.

The war of Italy in Libya was conducted from start to ﬁnish
as a war of extermination of the native population. It ended in
the massacre of 20,000 natives———men, women and children-—who
had been driven by armed force into the most arid part of the

20

 

 

country, where they died from hunger and thirst and were ex-
posed to machine gun ﬁre from airplanes. A war of fascism
against the last free native state of Africa will evoke a reaction
and indignation in all black Africa, in all the Arab countries and
in Mohammedan India. The ﬁrst symptoms of this indignation
are already visible. Our Italian Communist Party was perfectly
right in taking a defeatist position towards the imperialist war
of Italian fascism and in launching the slogan “Hands Off Ethio-
pia”. The Ethiopian people is the ally of the Italian proletariat
against fascism, and from this platform we assure it of our
sympathy. The revolutionary traditions of the Italian people,
the traditions of Garibaldi’s Volunteers—-these traditions in whose
name the first Italian internationalists with sincere enthusiasm
entered the ranks of the ﬁghters in Poland and Hungary, in
Greece and South America, in every place where the banner of
struggle was raised for national liberty, these traditions bring
the Italian toilers to the side of the Ethiopian people against the
fascist bourgeoisie. Today, in face of the prospects that new re-
serves o-f the anti-imperialist revolution in the enormous African
continent will be drawn into the struggle owing to the assault
of fascism, the Seventh Congress of the Communist International
once more proclaims that the Communists are the vanguard of
every struggle against imperialism. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to
the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

FASCISM MEANS WAR

At the present moment the danger of war threatens con-
cretely from three sides: from German National-Socialism, from
imperialist Japan, and from Italian fascism. These are the most
reactionary states; they are states that have either abolished the
regime of bourgeois democracy or that have never possessed it,
states striving for war, desiring war, already waging war.

Capitalist reaction is war; fascism is war. This is what actual
reality demonstrates to us now.

Our banner is the banner of the ﬁght for peace. We shall
raise this banner before the millions of toilers of the whole
world! We shall defend it from the fascists, from all the war-
mongersl (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of
the Communist International.)

21

 

 

  

Why Certain Capitalist Powers Are at

Present Interested in Peace

AT THE PRESENT  SOME GREAT POWERS ARE FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF PEACE

THE contrast between the capitalist world and the world of
socialism continues to be the deepest contradiction of the present
historical period.

This contradiction is expressed today especially sharply by
the fact that the imperialists of ‘two of the greatest countries,
Germany and Japan, are openly calling for war against the
Soviet Union, are trying to create a bloc of a number of reac-
tionary and fascist states to prepare and wage this war, and are
supported and encouraged in these efforts by the most reactionary
strata of the bourgeoisie of the greatest imperialist power, Great
Britain. , " p ’

The policy of aggression of German fascism and Japanese
militarism leads inevitably to a new accentuation of all inter-
national antagonisms, but at the same time to a differentiation
in the policy of the great imperialist powers, some of which are
interested in the defense of the status quo and in a temporary
and conditional defense of peace. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to
the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

WHO IS in FAVOR or THE STATUS Quo?

At a time when particularly the fascist states——Germany, Po-
land, Hungary, Italy~—are openly striving for a new repartition

22

 

of the world and a change in the frontiers of Europe, there is a
tendency among a number of other countries to maintain the
status quo. At the present time this tendency is represented on a
world scale by the United States; in Europe,‘ primarily by
France; the efforts of these two leading imperialist powers to
maintain the status quo are supported by several smaller coun-
tries (the Little and Balkan Ententes, some of the Baltic states),
whose independence is threatened by‘ a new imperialist war.
(From “The Tasks of the Communist International in Connection
with the Preparations of the Imperialists for a New World War”,
Resolution of the Seventh Congress of the Communist Interna-
tional on the Report of M. Ercoli.)

THE FRENCH BOURGEOISIE DOES NOT WANT TO RISK A NEW
WAR JUST NOW

What is -the position of the bourgeoisie of the French Repub-
lic in the question of the war danger?

The Frenchbourgeoisie is not interested in war at the present
time. The victory it won in 1918 has enabled it to accumulate
immense riches, and has insured it hegemony in capitalist Europe.

At the present moment the French bourgeoisie is satisﬁed
with what it has. It does not intend to take the risk involved in
a new war.

It well knows that it defeated its German rival only after
52 months of war and with the considerable aid of the most
powerful imperialisms in the world. It realizes that it would be
diﬂicult to resist successfully ;a fascist Germany powerfully
equipped, whose population is half as large again as its own.
(From a speech delivered by Andre Marty at the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International.)

GERMAN FASCISM---A THREAT TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND
FREEDOM OF SMALL NATIONALITIES

Can one not foresee what a victorious war of German fascism
would signify for Europe?'Such a war would signify the end
of national independence for the Czechs, the Lithuanians and the
other little nationalities of the Baltic, as well as for the Poles,

23

Dutch, and Belgians. All the peoples of Europe understand this,

 

a proof of which is the enthusiasm with which these peoples-

whose national independence is {threatened by National-Socialism
welcome the ever more active /and authoritative participation of
the Soviet Union in European politics, because this international
activity of the U.S.S.R. bars the road to the offensive of the

E German fascists. '

In concentrating the ﬁre of our struggle against the principal
enemy of peace, against German fascism-——which does not pre-
vent us Waging an irreconcilable struggle against the imperial-
ism of our “own” countries and against the extreme war parties
of the capitalist countries connected with German fascism-we
accomplish our role as the supreme defenders of all the liberties
and conquests of the working class and toilers, and "we defend

-national freedom. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Con-

gress of the Communist International.)
FASCISM Is MENACING THE PEOPLES OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA

German imperialism is threatening a. number of countries.
Among those most immediately within ﬁring range is Czechoslo-
vakia. The Czechoslovakian people are threatened with the loss
of their national independence. The German, Slovakian, Hun-
garian, Ukrainian and Polish peoples in Czechoslovakia are in
danger of coming under the heel of German, Hungarian and
Polish fascism. (From a speech delivered by K. Gottwald at the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

THE COMMUNISTS SUPPORT THE NATIONS WHOSE INDE-
PENDENCE IS THREATENED

If any "weak state is attacked by one or more big imperialist
powers which want to destroy its national independence and
national unity or to dismember it, as in the historic instance of
the partition of Poland, a war conducted by the national bour-
geoisie of -such a. country to repel this attack may assume the
character of a war of liberation, in which the working class and
the Communists of that country cannot abstain from intervening.
It is the task of the Communists of such a country, while, carry-

24

 

 

 

 ing on an irreconcilable struggle to safeguard the economic and

political positions of the workers, toiling peasants and national
minorities, to be, at the same time, in the front ranks of the
ﬁghters for national independence and to ﬁght the war of liber-
ation to a ﬁnish, without allowing “their” -bourgeoisie to strike
a bargain with the attacking powers to the prejudice of the
interests of their country. (From “The Tasks -of the Communist
International in Connection with the Preparations of the Impe-
rialists for a New World War”, Resolution of the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International on the Report of M. Ercoli.)

The Soviet Union—A Bulwark of Peace

THE SOVIET UNION IS FIGHTING FOR PEACE

THE role of the U.S.S.R. is growing as the bulwark of peace
among nations. And in the face of the threatening danger of a
new disaster, the peoples are turning their gaze towards the
country whose mighty armed forces are still restraining the in-
stigators of imperialist war. The U.S.S.R. rallies and groups
around itself all those who do _not want war. These are not only
the vast toiling masses of town and country, not only classes,
their parties and organizations in the various countries, they are
whole nations and states whose independence is threatened by

 

war; these are, even the bourgeois governments of important .
imperialist countries which today are not interested  war.‘ What »

their motives may be is a matter of secondary importance at the
present time. (From D. Z. Manuilsky’s Report to the Seventh
Congress of the Communist International.)

THE POLICY OF THE SOVIET UNION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
POLICY OF PEACE

The policy of the Soviet Union is a policy of peace. The
fact that the Soviet Union pursues a policy of peace is not
accidental, is not dependent upon any transient state of things.
This policy is organically connected with the very nature of
Soviet power, with the entire history‘ of its development, with
all that it is and does.

26.

 

In 1917, was not the slogan of peace one of the main slogans
with which the Bolsheviks proceeded to conquer power? C

This indestructible linking up of the masses o-f workers and
peasants with the Soviet government on the basis of a policy of
peace was reinforced by the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk
Peace, which offers us an example of the conditions the German
imperialists would have imposed on the whole world if they had
succeeded in completely realizing their plans.

Thanks to this policy of peace the Soviet Union has been
successful up to now in smashing all the plans of isolation and
encirclement concocted against it by the imperialists. All impe-
rialist states of any importance at all have been constrained to
establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The U.S.S.R.
has concluded non-aggression pacts with all countries with which
it has common boundaries, the only exception being Japan, which
has refused to conclude such a pact. From the Genoa Conference

‘in 1922 right down to the Disarmament Conference, the Soviet

Union has continually and energetically raised the question of
complete disarmament. When its proposals for complete dis-
armament were rejected it came forward with the proposal for

partial disarmament, ﬁghting to the very end to diminish the

war danger.

In the post-war period, Social"-Democracy was in power in
quite a number of countries. But is there a single Social-Demo-
cratic government that did one-hundredth part as much in the
cause of peace as the Soviet Union has done? Is there a single
Social-Democratic government which declared for the abroga-
tion of all secret treaties concluded by the bourgeoisie for the
preparation of war, which solemnly renounced so-called “his-
torical” rights cl.ashing with the interests of other countries or
the interests of peace?

The Soviet government gives us an example of how the fight
for peace must be conducted by its coolness and resoluteness in
relation to all the provocations of the Japanese generals. Is the-re,
has there ever been a government that was able to do in the
defense of peace what the Soviets did when they proceeded to
sell the Chinese Eastern Railway? The U.S.S.R. has shown in

this case how one must act if one desires to avoid war. Only the

27

working class in power is able to pursue such a cool and, at
the same time, bold policy of peace. _

By its peace policy the Soyiet Union has proved that only
socialism means peace. It is for this reason that this policy has
mobilized and mobilizes the proletarians of all countries to
ﬁght for socialism, and rallies around the working class millions
of toilers, peasants and intellectuals who hate war and are striv-
ing to preserve peace. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh
Congress of the Communist International.)

THE STRENGTH OF THE FIGHT FOR PEACE LIES IN THE
MIGHT OF THE SOVIET UNION

Even at the gravest moments, the struggle for peace is not a
hopeless one. It is not hopelessbecause, in struggling for peace,
we support ourselves now on the strength of the working class

which has the power in its hands in the U.S.S.R. Note what the a
Soviet Union has achieved. War has already menaced its from-

tiers for years. But by ﬁghting tenaciously for peace, by sacri-
ﬁcing all that it was possible to sacriﬁce for the cause of peace,
by relying on its powerful strength, it has been able to avoid war

up to the present. If the Soviet Union had not existed, the breath-_

ing space between the two cycles of wars would not have been
so long. The peoples would long ago have been thrown into a
new slaughter. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International.)

RED DIPLOMACY 0N GUARD

The international situation is particularly tense and acute,
war can break out at any moment and at any place, and any war
will inevitably become a world war. It likewise follows from all
this that the antagonisms between the big imperialist. powers are
developing in such a way that at a given moment, under given
conditions, they may to a certain extent form an obstacle to the
creation of a new bloc of the powers for war against the Soviet
Union. This opens wide possibilities for the Soviet policy of
peace. .

If it is true that differences exist in the positions of the

various countries-—such as I have just sketched—then we cannot.

28

 

 

fail to take them into account in determining our revolutionary
strategy and our tactics in the ﬁght against war. This is absolutely
essential. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of
the Communist International.)

UNITE AGAINST THE ACGRESSORl

The U.S.S.R. took a great step forward towards the rapproche-
ment between it and several small weak states, whose indepen-
dence, as we have already pointed out, is threatened by the war
plans of German fascism. The rapprochement with these states,
for which the aggression of National-Socialism" represents an
exceptionally concrete and serious danger, led, as you know, to
formulating the deﬁnition of an aggressor.’ This deﬁnition is of
interest to us here less as a diplomatic event than as the concrete
expression of the real connection which is coming into being
between the workers of the Soviet Union who are defending the
achievements of the proletarian revolution on the one hand, and
on the other, the small peoples and small nations that are de-
fending their liberty and national integrity, and all the friends
of peace.

Realizing the role which the national question plays in the
life of the peoples, we have to reckon on the absolute probability
that in case of a war provoked by German fascism, certain peo-
ples of Europe who have secured their independence at the cost
of great suffering will -prefer, in order to preserve it, to ﬁght on
the side of the Soviet Union as the only country in the world
where the national question has been solved in accordance with
the aspirations of the peoples, by granting to every nationality
the right of self-determination. At all events, we know that this
is in the interests of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, Lithuania,
and a number of other small states, and that it is the duty "of the
revolutionary vanguard of the working class to prevent the hour-
geoisie of these countries from pursuing a policy which runs
counter to these interests.

The proposal for the conclusion of the Eastern Pact was
made after establishing the deﬁnition of the aggressor. Being
based on recognition of peace as indivisible and of the impos-
sibility of separating the danger of war menacing the east of

Down With War!

To ALL WORKERS AND WORKERS’ ORGANIZATIONS;
TO ALL FOES OF WAR AND FRIENDS OF PEACE;
TO ALL PEOPLES WHO DO NOT WANT A REPETITION OF THE
' WORLD SLAUGHTER or 1914-1918:

The imperialist struggle between the great capitalist powers,
particularly Great Britain and Italy, over Ethiopia has led to
Italian fascism attacking the Ethiopian people. Italian ‘planes
are bombing peaceful towns and villages of Ethiopia.

Under the suspicious guise o-f concern for Ethiopia’s “inde-
pendence”, British imperialism is preparing war against Italy for
the possession of Ethiopia. The British navy stands ready to
ﬁght. Together with Great Britain, other imperialist states, alleg-
edly in the interests of the restoration of peace, are demanding
a protectorate over Ethiopia. The instigators of war in other
countries are working feverishly. Fascist Germany is only waiting
to take advantage of the war in Africa in order to attack Lithua-
nia. Germany, Poland and Hungary are forging a bloc in fur-
therance of their aggressive plans in Eastern Europe. The Aus-
trian question is again being placed on the order of the day.

t War complications in Europe would untie the hands of the
Japanese imperialists in the Far East for an armed attack on
other parts of China and would extremely intensify her aggres-
siveness towards the Soviet Union. The war of the Italian fascists
on Ethiopia may be a prelude to a new world imperialist war.
On September 25, eight days before the commencement of
Al’ military activities, the Communist International addressed a pro-
‘ posal to the Labor and Socialist International for joint action
against war.
Till now the Labor and Socialist International has not given
a favorable reply to our pro-posal, because there are serious con-
tradictions within its own ranks. Those elements in the Labor and
Socialist International who are in alliance with their bourgeoisie

 

3

Europe from the threat of war in the west, this proposal was
intended to achieve the result of putting the instigators of war
into a difﬁcult position and of, rallying all friends of peace, who-
ever they were. ~ ’

As is well known, the proposal for the conclusion of an
Eastern Pact was rejected by the warmongers, and this was bound
to be followed by the establishment of an especially close con-
nection between the Soviet Union and the states interested in
active resistance to the present aggressors———Which has led to the
conclusion of pacts of mutual aid between the Soviet Union on
the one hand and France and Czechoslovakia on the other. (From
M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist
International.)

OUR AIMS ARE IDENTICAL

For us it is absolutely indisputable that there is a complete
identity of aim between the peace policy of the Soviet Union
and the policy of the working class an.d Communist Parties of
the capitalist countries. There is not, and cannot be, any doubt
in our ranks on this subject. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

BUT OUR TACTICS DIFFER

This identity o-f aim by no means signiﬁes that at every given
moment there must be complete coincidence in all acts and on
all questions between the tactics of the proletariat and Commu-
nist Parties that are still struggling for power and the concrete
tactical measures of the Soviet proletariat and the C.P.S.U. which
already have power in their hands in the Soviet Union.

The tactical positions of the proletarian Parties in regard
to the same concrete question need not necessarily be identical.

Our comrades of the French Communist Party and of the
Czechoslovakian Communist Party have understood that their
policy must be determined by the same Marxist-Leninist method,
which demands that the concrete circumstances be taken into
account. For this reason, in addressing "themselves to the bour-
geoisie of their countries, they could say and had to say to them:

30

   
    
  

 

 

“"""""~‘»"*W"*""‘ '»"»“ - * - ‘ i r . . M 2.  'i'l‘ '  .

“Gentlemen, you, have signed a pact, a limited pact, with the
working class of the Soviet Union that has the power in its hands,
but you have not signed any pact with the working class of our
country, with us. We have no guarantee that you will not utilize
your army, which continues to be a class army, against the work-
ing class of our country and against the colonial peoples, our
allies in the struggle against imperialism. We have no guarantee
at all that you will not continue to make the poor, and not the
rich, pay the necessary expenses for the organization of your army.
We have no control over the manner in which your class govem-
ment and your reactionary and fascist General Staff will spend
the money that you take from the poor in order to pay for the
organization of the army. We have not even any guarantee that,
when the decisive moment arrives, you will remain loyal to the
pact that you are signing today. _-

“For all these reasons, gentlemen, we can neither vote your »
military budget nor give up the struggle against your government.
But please note that this does not mean that we have no interest
in the pact that you have concluded with the Soviet Union or that
we are indifferent to the manner in which you give effect to it.
We know that in your ranks there are those who are against this
pact, that there exists a section of the bourgeoisie who would like
to tear it up. We, indeed, will defend the pact with all our strength
because it is an instrument in the struggle for peace and for the
defense of the Soviet Union. We shall vote for the pact in parlia-
ment and we shall expose any attempt tocpursue a policy which
is different from or in contradiction to the obligations ensuing
from the pact.” -

(From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International.) -

“STALIN IS RIGHT”

The F ranco-Soviet pact is one of the steps towards the strug-i
gle for peace. It is in this sense that the French workers and
peasants, Communists, Socialists, Democrats, have approved
Stalin’s clear remarks to Laval.

The more the French workers reﬂect, the more they realize
that this is the only possible road, and that once again our great
Comrade Stalin has fulﬁlled his true function as leader.

The day that the report of Stalin’s declaration was received
in France, considerable excitement was caused. And when, a
few days later, we pasted on the walls a tremendous poster “Stalin

31

Is Right”, hundreds of thousands of workers of the Seine——-So-
cialists, Democrats, Communists——passed by the poster and cried
“Bravo!” (From a speech dglivered by Marcel Cachin at the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

3 WHAT THE FRENCH PROLETARIAT THINKS OF THE
FRANCO-SOVIET AGREEMENT

The French proletarians know that it is a shameful slander
to say that the Soviet Union is interested in war. They know very
well that the U.S.S.R. is, on the contrary, the only power that
tries to avoid war by every possible means. The Soviet Union
has foiled the plans of imperialism, which wished to isolate
it. It is collaborating with all the little countries that are menaced
in their independence ‘at the present time, and with those that are
not interested in breaking the peace at the present historical
moment.

It offers its pacts of non-aggression, peace guarantees, and
mutual assistance to all nations, no matter which they are. One
must have a brazen‘ face to say under these conditions that the
Soviet Union wants war and is preparing for it. No! All honest
minds know very well that the U.S.S.R. is a great peaceable
nation, the only really peaceable nation in the whole world!
(From a speech delivered by Marcel Cachin at the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International.)

THE WORKERS’ AND PEASANTS’ RED ARMY-—-A FORCE FOR PEACE

But the peace policy of the Soviet Union is not a policy of

Acapitulation to the enemy, is not a policy causing the U.S.S.R.

to close its eyes to realities, to renounce defense of the gains 0
the Revolution. " ‘-

Indeed, since the existence of the Red Army we have for th
ﬁrst time in history a situation where a formidable armed force
is put at the service of the cause of peace.

The Red Army is an army of peace because. it is the army
of the working class.

On January 1, 1930, 31.2 per cent of the Red Army were
workers. On January 1, 1934, the percentage of workers had
risen to 45.8 while at the beginning of this year it was 49.3 per

32

 

 

cent. But this percentage increases on passing from the mass of
the membership of the Red Army to its middle and upper com-
manding cadres. The contradiction which tears apart the bour-
geois armies, where the mass of soldiers consists of peasants and
workers while the commanding cadres consist of representatives
of the most reactionary classes and cliques, this contradiction is
unknown to the Red Army. Seventy-two per cent of the regi-
mental commanders are workers, 90 per cent of the divisional
commanders, while the commanders of army corps consist of
working class elements to the extent of 100 per cent. Is a more
concrete proof necessary to show that the Red Army is an instru-
ment of peace held in the ﬁrm hands of the working class?

The workers and collective farmers who form the overwhelm-
ing majority in the Red Army are no longer “soldiers”. They are
a part of that wonderful Soviet youth whose representatives we
greeted at the opening session of our Congress and who consti-
tute the sole example in the world of a new generation, free,
mighty, joyful and conﬁdent of the future.

They are the sons of the heroes of the Civil War. They are a
youth which has learned the conscious, voluntary discipline of
socialist labor in the factory and the collective farm. They are
a youth which knows that it owes to the revolution and the
Soviet power that it has been spared the horror of capitalist fac-
tories, of unemployment, of material and spiritual misery. This
youth is imbued with the psychology of creation, because the
land in which it was born is the only country where factories,
cities, socialist industry, collective farms, a new life, are being
built on a grand scale. The Soviet Union is the land of the pio-
neers of a new civilization, and is consequently the land of peace.
Dreams of conquest, decadent raptures over bloodshed and preda-
tory wars as the sole “sanitary measures” for humanity, can be
engendered only in countries of decaying capitalism.

The proletarians in the capitalist countries know that the
Red Army is headed by the most devoted ﬁghters for the revolu-
tion. They know that at the head of the Red Army stands our
Comrade Voroshilov, a champion of the proletarian revolution,
the son of a railroad worker and a charwoman, a man who at
the age of seven worked in a coal mine at a wage of ten kopeks

33

per day, a smith by profession, a member of the Bolshevik
Party even before the Revolution of 1905, a man whose entire
life is linked with the struggles bf the vanguard of the Russian
workers under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, one who has
always been a most disciplined Bolshevik, one of the best pupils
of Lenin and Stalin. .

Will not the miners from the Ruhr and the north of France,
will not the unfortunate workers in the textile factories of Japan
recognize in Comrade Voroshilov and in the other leaders of the
Red Army their class brothers and comrades-in-arms?

The revolutionary workers of the whole world know that in
the ranks of the Red Army the percentage of Bolshevik Party
members and Young Communist League members is steadily in-
creasing. They know that the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army
created by Lenin, which was forged during the Civil War under
the directlleadership of Lenin and was led to victory by the great
Stalin, is guided by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
the sole Party so far which has given an example of persistent
and victorious struggle against imperialist war.

Every step forward, therefore, in strengthening the Workers’
and Peasants’ Red Army is greeted with the greatest joy by all
the exploited and by all friends of peace in all the capitalist
countries.

The international proletariat knows and understands that
humanity would ‘long ago have been dragged into the abyss of
war if it had not been for the Red Army; it understands that the
existence of this powerful force is the guarantee of peace and
of the victory of the working class. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to
the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

34

 

 

Our Main Slogan Is Peace!

THE struggle for peace in which we rely on the strength of
the Soviet Union, has, therefore, every chance of being success-
ful. Every month, every week which we gain is of enormous
value for humanity. Conscious of the deepest aspirations of the
masses and the vital interests of all humanity, the Communist
International puts itself at the head of the campaign for the de-

fense of peace and the Soviet Union. The slogan of peace becomes '

our central slogan in the ﬁght against war. (From M. Ercoli’s
Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

THE DEMAND FOR PEACE HAS ACQUIRED A NEW MEANING

Conscious of the deepest aspirations of the masses and the
vital interests of all humanity, the Communist International puts
itself at the head of the campaign for the defense of peace and
the Soviet Union. The slogan of peace becomes the central slo-
gan in the ﬁght against war.

The polemic over the slogan of peace conducte-d by Lenin
during the World War against the Trotskyists was a polemic

against the Menshevik tendency to counterpose the slogan of V

peace to the slogan of defeatism and the transformation of the
imperialist war into a civil War against the bourgeoisie. In fact,
during the imperialist war, the problem could no longer be that
of ﬁghting to maintain peace, but of utilizing the deep crisis and
the wave of hatred against the capitalist world create-d by the
war in order to unleash the proletarian revolution and overthrow

35

  

the class domination of the bourgeoisie. It was the imperialist
powers which spoke to the people of a “just” and “democratic”
peace in order to hide the imperialist aims of their war and rally
the masses to the chauvinist policy of defense of the fatherland.

We not only do not hide the slogan of the conversion of
imperialist war into civil war, which, in case of war remains the
basic, central slogan of Bolsheviks, but by ﬁghting desperately
for peace we desire as the result of this ﬁght to unite around the
revolutionary vanguard the masses of the workers, toiling peas-
ants and also the petty bourgeoisie, which the proletariat must
lead along the path of the conversion of imperialist war into civil
war against the bourgeoisie.

If in the period immediately following the war we did not
put the slogan of peace at the center of our agitation, it was be-
cause for everyone “peace” then meant the peace of Versailles
which we condemned and against which we were ﬁghting. We
wanted to avoid even indirectly seeming to give our support to
the Versailles system. Today, when the Versailles system has
crumbled and German National-Socialism is striving to provoke
a new war with the aim of forcing on the people of Europe a
system of oppression still more monstrous than that of Ver-
sailles, the defense of peace receives an entirely different con-
tent. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the
Communist Inte-rnational.)

TO FIGHT FOR PEACE IS TO DEFEND THE SOVIET UNION

No one can doubt that the coming war, even if it were to
begin as a war between two big imperialist powers or as a war
of a big power against a small country, will inevitably tend to
develop into and will inevitably become a war against th-e Soviet
Union. Every year and every month of respite is a guarantee for
us that the Soviet Union will be in a position to repulse most
strongly the attack of the imperialists. Our struggle for peaceis
thus directly linked up with the peace policy of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics.

The cause of peace and the cause of defending the Soviet
Union become a single cause and not a single worker will refuse

36

 

 

to ﬁght for it. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International.)

TO DEFEND THE DEMANDS OF THE TOILERS IS TO DEFEND PEACE

The struggle for the immediate economic and political de-
mands of the working class, toiling peasantry and all sections
of the toiling population must play a primary role in the organ-
ization of the united front for the ﬁght for peace. The very prep-
aration for war carried out by the bourgeoisie at the expense of
the toilers forces the masses to take up this struggle for their
immediate demands.

Note the record ﬁgure reached by the war budgets during
recent years. This means that the burden of ‘taxation which op-
presses the workers, peasants, craftsmen, and small shopkeepers
is continually increasing. The proﬁts of the war industry are
also reaching record ﬁgures, while wages are falling more and
more, particularly in the countries which are most intensely pre-
paring for war.

The preparation for war, especially in the fascist countries,
is accompanied by measures for organization of the whole of
war industry and for adapting the entire economy of the coun-
try to war needs, and this has an immediate effect on the posi-
tion of the workers, both from the economic and the political
point of view. In Germany, a plan for the reorganization of the
whole of industry for war purposes is already in process of opera-
tion. The same thing is taking place in Japan. In Italy, the intro-
duction of corporations is nothing but a form of the centraliza-
tion of industry in case of war.

In the war industry, the workers are already subjected to a
war regime and this emphasizes the necessity for specially in-
tense work in this industry. ,

The struggle for the immediate demands of the workers,
peasants and toiling masses in general is our most effective means
for exposing the chauvinist demagogy of fascism, of demonstrat-
ing the lying character of the fables propagated by them: the lie
about race, about “war in the interests of all”, about the “state
above classes”, about the “proletarian nation which is struggling

37

  

 

\
it
is against capitalist nations”, about the “necessity of conquering a
place under the sun”, etc. _ g i

In the course of the struggle for the re-al interests of the pro-
“ letariat and toiling masses against exploiters and oppressors,
‘ the workers and the whole mass of toilers become educated in
the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Hereby the weapon is
being forged which in the ﬁnal analysis will give us the possi-
bility of shattering chauvinist propaganda. But for this to be a
really sharp weapon we must undertake the defense not only of
the immediate economic interests of the masses, but also of their
political demands and aspirations. We must know how to inter-
“ pret all their interests, we must show that it is precisely the
working class and its vanguard that has the task of solving all
|i the problems concerning every section of the toilers in the given
\‘ country. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of
the Communist International.)

ll  WOMEN AND WAR

‘Q? There cannot be a successful ﬁght against fascism and war
 unless the broad masses of women are drawn into. it. And agita-
?» tion alone will not accomplish this. We must ﬁnd a way of
‘ ‘ mobilizing the masses of toiling women around their vital inter-

ests and demands, taking into account the concrete situation in
g each instance, in the ﬁght for their demands against high prices,
‘‘ for higher wages on the basis of the principle of equal pay for
in equal work, against mass dismissals, against every manifestation
\* of inequality in the status of women, and against fascist en-
slavement.

It is necessary to seek out the simplest and most ﬂexible
forms, in order to establish contact and bring about cooperation
in struggle between the revolutionary, Social-Democratic and
progressive anti-war and anti-fascist women’s organizations. We
i must spare no pains to see that the women workers and toilers
ﬁght shoulder to shoulder with their class brothers in the ranks
of the united working class front and the anti-fascist people’s
front. (From G. Dimitroff’s Report to the Seventh Congress of
the Communist International.)

38

 

 

THE YOUTH AND WAR

The acute danger of war does not frighten us. But it de-
mands an earnest and energetic mobilization of the toiling popu-
lation for the purpose of resisting, for combating the war
preparations of the bourgeoisie; it demands that the millions
of members of the younger generation must be summoned for
the united front.

How else can we resist the imperialist warmongers? (From
a speech delivered by O. Kuusinen at the Seventh Congress of the
Communist International.)

WE SHALL NOT ABANDON THE YOUTH T0 FASCISM

These widespread activities of the bourgeoisie in regard to
the militarization of the youth must be countered by us with the
aid of equally widespread activity aiming at wresting the younger
generation from the inﬂuence of the bourgeoisie and fascism. We
must prevent the youth enrolled in the mass fascist organizations
from undergoing the tragic experience that our generation under-
went in the World War. We want to have the youth already
ﬁghting side by side with us for peace. We must therefore direct
and accelerate the process of destroying the inﬂuence of the bour-
geoisie among the youth. We must ﬁnd a way to the younger
generation, we must understand their mood and what isvin their
minds.

In the fascist countries, it is absolutely essential to bridge
the abyss that in some cases already exists, or which is in proc-
ess of being created, between the old generation _of revolutionary
workers and Communists and the younger generation of toilers.
There is only one method of bridging the gap between the old
and young generations, namely, to penetrate the fascist organiza-
tions, to work within these organizations, to organize a united
front and establish our nuclei within the fascist organizations
themselves in the forms demanded by the situation. We must go
so far as to transform whole sections of fascist youth organiza-
tions into points of support for our anti-war work. _

We do not want to surrender the youth to fascism. We do.

39

  

are concerned not so much for the preservation of peace as for
the imperialist interests of their ruling classes. They are there-
fore making every effort to prevent joint action by the working
class nationally and internationally. In this extremely serious
moment, when the lives of millions are at stake, the working
class must emphatically demand that despite the resistance of
the opponents of a united front, the way should be cleared for the
powerful current of proletarian unity. We are convinced that
the supporters of a united front ‘within the ranks of the Labor

 

and Socialist International will do everything possible to have_

the proposal of the Communist International accepted.

Not a minute more must be lost.’ The unity of action of all
labor organizations, all friends of peace in all countries for the
isolation and bridling of the fascist warmongers must not be
delayed a single moment!

The Communist International calls upon all its Sections im-
mediately to proceed to organize powerful actions by all toilers
against war. The Communist International earnestly appeals to
all Socialist workers, their organizations and parties to set aside
all the differences of opinion hitherto existing and jointly, shoul-
der to shoulder, to resist the fascist warmongers. The Communist
International calls upon all workers, all workers’ organizations,
irrespective of trend, all foes of war, all friends of peace, all
nations who do not want a repetition of the horrors of the World
War, to amal.gamate their forces in order to frustrate the rapa-
cious war already begun by the Italian fascists, to strike a severe
blow at the latter, and thus to support the Italian people in its
struggle for emancipation. The Communist International calls
upon the working class of every country to exercise the greatest
vigilance in relation to the policy of its own imperialist govern-
ment. It calls upon the toilers to guard against the spread of the
war to other countries and to prevent the transformation of the

'Italo-Ethiopian war into a new butchery on a world-wide scale.

  

Proletarians!‘ Toilers of all countries!

DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS ON THE
QUESTION OF WAR

-The state of confusion and internal collapse in which Social-
Democracy ﬁnds itself is manifested in a particularly striking
way in the attitude of the Social-Democratic Parties to the ques-
tion of war. The Social-Democratic Parties, which only a few
years ago expressed themselves—.even if rather indeﬁnitely———
against defense of the fatherland and spoke of certain forms of
mass action in case of war,’ have since begun to pass over more
openly to collaboration with the imperialist bourgeoisie in
regard to defense of the bourgeois fatherland. '

The Swiss, Dutch and Finnish Social-Democratic» Parties, for
instance, have acted in this way. So have also the ‘British Labor
Party and Trades Union Congress. At the same time, the will
to struggle against war, for peace and for defense of the Soviet
Union is strengthening among the masses of Social-Democratic
workers, and a process of differentiation in connection with the
war question is taking place in the Social-Democratic Parties
and organizations. In the Left wing of the Socialist Party in
France, there is developing, although with great vacillations, a
tendency towards the position of revolutionary struggle against
war, and, in particular, to renounce defense of the fatherland
under a bourgeois regime. In the Social-Democratic Parties which
have been driven into emigration by fascism, there have also
been observable tendencies, as yet timid, for linking the struggle
against war with the struggle for the overthrow of fascism. We
cannot but welcome and do everything possible to assist the
approach to a revolutionary position on the part of these Left
groups of Social-Democracy. And we shall achieve it by entering
into a united front with the Social-Democratic workers, while
-at the same time never refraining from systematically exposing
all hesitation and theoretical inaccuracy in regard to this ques-

4-0

 

 

tion, which is one of the most complicated and important ques-
tions of Marxist-Leninist theory. (From M. Ercoli’s Report to
the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

FOR UNITY OF THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE

We must, in our consistent and thorough-going struggle for‘
peace, develop our anti-fascist work in the army. We shall not.
surrender the mass of the soldiers to the fascists. All penetration
of fascism into the army is a menace to peace. Every effective
measure against such penetration assists the defense ‘of peace.

The fascists are instilling their anti-proletarian, militarist and
chauvinist policy into the army. This gives the more justiﬁcation
for the working class in the countries of bourgeois democracy to
demand that the army should be democratized by granting the-
soldiers all political rights. We demand that every soldier should
have the right freely to express his opinion on the war propa-
ganda that is being conducted in the army by the fascists, that.

he should have the possibility both inside and outside the army‘.

of expressing his desire for peace. We demand that all political
rights should be granted to the soldiers because we are certain.
that an unfettered expression of the desire of the soldiers can
hinder the war plans of the bourgeoisie and fascism.

For the same reason we demand that the fascist oﬁicers should '

be expelled from the army and that the reactionary «general
staﬂ's should be subjected to democratic control, in the exercise
of which workers’ organizations should participate.

We put forward these demands in order in every possible
way to hinder the advance of fascism where it is not yet in
power. The very development of our policy of the united front
and people’s front demands it.

Our principal task, therefore, is to link the army with the
people. Hence we shall ﬁght in defense of all partial demands
of the soldiers——those demands which have been the starting
point of all movements that have taken place in recent times
among the masses of soldiers in bourgeois armies. (From M.
Ercoli’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist Inter-
national.)

.'FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE ARMY AND THE CREATION OF
AN ANTI-FASCIST PEOPLE,S ARMY

/Ki‘

The bourgeoisie is just nowl trying to justify its ‘military
imeasures on the grounds that a strong army is necessary in
order to combat German imperialism. The Socialist leaders are
demanding that the Communists should vote for the war budget
« on the grounds that it is in the interests of the ﬁght against Ger-
.man fascism and even of support for the Soviet Union. We, the
‘Communists, ask, where is the guarantee that a weapon in the
hands of the bourgeoisie and the fascist generals will not at the
decisive moment be turned against the working class? We ask,
‘how can an army which is controlled by fascist generals, and the
soldiers of which have been deprived of all democratic liberties,
how can such an army defend the democratic republic against
fascist reaction? , ‘

Such an army is incapable of defending the country from
external counter-revolution. And therefore, in the interests of a
genuine defense of the republic from fascist attacks, we are
ﬁghting for the democratization of the army, for the immediate
removal of the fascist generals and officers from the army, for
granting the soldiers all civil liberties, including liberty of
assembly and the suffrage, and for the improvement of the mate-

4 rial welfare of the soldiers.

The fulﬁllment, of these demands would frustrate the plans
of the fascist reactionaries to utilize the army for their own pur-
poses. These demands are an essential condition for the energetic
defense of Czechoslovakia against Hitlerist imperialism.

But the danger with which the entire toiling population of
our republic is today being threatened by fascism, internal and
external, is so great that it is essential, in addition to democratiz-
ing the army, to mobilize the Whole strength of the people for
defense against fascism.

We are combating the endeavors of reactionary bourgeois
circles to militarize the youth; we are combating them because
the Prussian militarization of the youth under the command of
reactionary oﬂicers leads to the further enslavement of the toil-
ing people, and not to the defense of the republic against fascism.

42

 

 

..;,:,».~.—~

 

Realizing the danger of fascism, and pointing to the endeavors»
of the reactionaries to concentrate all the armed forces in their
own hands, we propose and demand the creation of an anti--
fascist people’: army. a ~

An anti-fascist people’s army, which would embrace all pro-«
letarian and progressive strata in voluntary military organiza.-»
tions, which would be built on the principles of democratic self-~
government, would form the bestdefense of democratic liberties-
and the democratic republic against the fascist‘ enemies of the
people. It would be the basis for the genuine military prepared--
ness of the people in a war against internal and external» counter-«
revolution. (From a speech delivered by Jan Schwerm at the:
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

What Must Be Done?

oun REPLY: LET US UNITE OUR FORCES! LET US FIGHT
TOGETHER FOR PEACE!

  
   
 
    
   
    
   
  
 
   

In face of the frightful reality of the capitalist world which
is rushing into war, millions and millions of men, women,_ youth,
and soldiers ask with anxiety: “Is our fate irrevocably ﬁxed?
Is it not possible to prevent this terrible scourge which threat-
-ens us?”

We Communists, the vanguard of the working class, can
reply to this question. We know that war is an inevitable accom-
paniment of the capitalist regime. Capitalist society, which is
based on the exploitation of man by man and the hunt for
proﬁt,. cannot avoid giving rise to war. But we know equally
well that all questions of the development of human society are
decided in the ﬁnal analysis by struggle———by the struggle ‘of the
masses. We launch our appeal to the great masses who do not
want war: “Let us unite our forces. Let us ﬁght together for
peace. Let us organize the united front of all who want to
defend and preserve peace.” (From M. Ercoli’s Report to the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

WAR CAN BE HINDERED

The preservation of peace is possible, itiis possible to hinder
war, under deﬁnite conditions to avoid war is a thing that is
possible and realizable. On the basis of this conviction we shall

44-

 

 

gather around us millions -of persons for the struggle for the
great, most just and most socialist cause——the cause of peace.
(From M. Ercoli’s reply to the discussion on his Report to the
Seventh Congress ofthe Communist International.)

A BROAD PE(lPLE’S FRONT AGAINST VVAR

Relying on the U.S.S.R., the proletariat must create" within
each country a broad general people’s front for the struggle
against war and unite the broad masses of the people into a
united front against the instigators of war. And this makes it

I necessary for the Communists to substitute for the old, amateur-

ish methods of conducting isolated, short, anti-war campaigns,
such a broad and coordinated struggle against War that would,
on the basis of the peace policy of the U.S.S.R., draw into its
ranks all the anti-war forces on a national as well as on an
international scale; a struggle that would combineywithin itself
all the various forms of action: street demonstrations, speeches
in parliament, convening international conferences of workers’
organizations, the creation of a close network of anti-war com-
mittees, etc. Today, shooting from the old-fashioned shotgun‘ of
small campaigns in defense of peace is quite inadequate when
the Communists can use the tanks of the broad people’s move-
ments against the menace of imperialist war.

By popularizing to the widest possible extent the Stalinist
peace policy pursued by the U.S.S.R., which brilliantly shows
how the predatory plans of the instigators of war may be
thwarted, the Communists must abandon the fatalist view that
it is impossible to prevent the outbreak of war, that it is useless
ﬁghting against war prep'arations—a view that arises from the
hitherto extremely limited dimensions of the anti-war movement.
(From D. Z. Manuilsky’s Report to the Seventh Congress of the
Commun-ist International.)

WE MUST FIGHT OUR “OWN” IMPERIALISTS

At the base of our revolutionary strategy, and consequently
of our concrete struggle against war, we put the concentration
of forces against the Japanese militarists who threaten an on-

45

slaught on the Soviet Union at its eastern frontiers and who are
striving to destroy the conquests of the Chinese revolution, and
against German fascism—the chief instigator of war in Europe.
We endeavor to utilize all differences existing in the positions of
the various imperialist powers. We must utilize them skillfully
in the interests of the defense of peace, not forgetting for an mo-
ment the necessity of delivering a blow against the enemy in our
own countries, against our “own” imperialism. (From M. Ercoli’s
Report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

TODAY THE WORLD IS NOT W’!-LAT IT WAS IN 1914

It is true that imperialist wars are the product of capitalism,
that only the overthrow of capitalism will put an end to all
war; but it is likewise true that the toiling masses can obstruct
imperialist war by their militant action.

Today the world is not what it was in 1914.

Today on one-sixth part of the globe there exists a powerful
proletarian state that relies on the material strength of victorious
socialism. Guided by Stalin’s wise peace policy, the Soviet Union
has already more than once brought to naught the aggressive
plans of the instigators of war.

Today ‘the world proletariat, in its struggle against war, has
at its disposal not only its weapon of mass action, as it did in
1914. Today the mass struggle of the international working
class against war is coupled with the inﬂuence of the Soviet
Union as a state, of its powerful Red Army, the most important
guardian of the peace.

Today the working class of the world is not under the exclu-
sive influence of Social-Democracy participating in a bloc with
the bourgeoisie, as was the case in 1914. Today there is the world
Communist Party, the Communist International. Today the bulk
of the Social-Democratic workers are turning to the Soviet Union,
to its policy of peace, to a united front with the Communists.
Today the peoples of the colonial and semi-colonial countries
do not regard their liberation as a hopeless cause. On the con-
trary, they are passing on more and more to determined struggle
against the imperialist enslavers. The best evidence of this is

the Soviet revolution in China and the heroic exploits of the‘.

Red Anny of the Chinese people; ,_

The popular hatred of war is constantly gaining in depth and.
intensity. In pushing the toilers into the abyss of imperialist
wars the bourgeoisie is staking its head. Today not only the work-

. ing class, the peasantry and other toilers champion the cause of

f..g;____;_the preservation of peace, but also the oppressed nations and

.weak peoples whose independence is threatened by new wars.
Even some of the big capitalist states, afraid of losing out in a

‘,,{_,,.L new redivision of the world, are interested at the present stage

w

in the avoidance of war.

This gives rise to the possibility of forming a most extensive
front of the working class, of all the toilers, and of entire na-
tions against the threat of imperialist war. Relying on the peace
policy of the Soviet Union and the will of millions upon millions
of toilers to have peace, our Congress has opened up the per-
spective of unfolding a wide anti-war front not only for the
Communist vanguard but for the working class of the whole

“ world, for the peoples of every land. The extent to which this.
world-wide front is realized and put into action will determine
whether the fascist and other imperialist war incendiaries will
_'be able in the near future to kindle a new imperialistlwar, or
whether their ﬁendish hands will be hacked off . by the axe of
a powerful anti-war front. (From the address delivered by
G. Dimitroff on August 20, 1935, at the close of the Seventh Con-
gress of the Communist International.)

Resort to such other effective forms of mass action as circum-
stances may warrant! Let the Italian fascists know that you will
not tolerate their military provocation! Let the ruling classes
know your might in the struggle for peace!

See to it by the unity of action of all labor organizations,
and especially of the organizations of the transport workers,
railwaymen, seamen and dockers, that not a single train shall be
dispatched, not a single ship leave her moorings, if they carry
freight in support of Italy’s war on Ethiopia. If this militant
measure is put into effect it will surround Italy by an iron ring
of isolation and frustrate the war she has already commenced;
it will be a sharp rap over the knuckles for all the fascist war-
mongers who are preparing to imitate the example of the Italian
fascists.

The governments of the decisive capitalist states represented
in the League of Nations are for their part condemning it to
impotence. The interplay of selﬁsh interests of the imperialist
powers is frustrating collective action by the League of Nations
against the fascist warmongers. Salvation from war lies in the
hands of the international proletariat and its organizations, it
depends on their joint and energetic action. The peace policy
of the Soviet Union, the only state which is determinedly oppos-
ing imperialist conquest and consistently pursuing a policy of
peace, is the most powerful bulwark of the international pro-
letariat in its struggle against imperialist wars and in the cause
of peace. ,

In this hour fraught with danger the Communist International
issues the call:

Workers of the world, unite! V

Not a single train, not a single ship, in support of Italy’s

' war on Ethiopia.’

Surround the fascist warmongers with an iron ring of isolation!
Hands oﬂ the Ethiopian people.’
Down with imperialist war.’
Long live the peace policy of the Soviet Union!
Long live peace.’

A New World War Is Threatening

APPEALS OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL TO T'I-IE
SECOND INTERNATIONAL

September 25: “War in Ethiopia
may break out at any moment.”

To THE SECRETARIAT or THE LABOR AND SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL,
BRUSSELS: '

Comrades:

War in Ethiopia may break out at any moment. The German
fascists are only waiting for this moment to ﬂing themselves upon

‘ weak Lithuania andioccupy Memel. The consequences of military

  

action by the Italian and German fascists would be incalculable.
It may lead to world war.

The Seventh Congress of the Communist International has
instructed the Executive Committee of the Communist Interna-
tional to propose to the leaders of the Labor and Socialist Inter-
national the establishment of international united action of the
proletariat. We know that your Executive Committee has resolved
to make a careful study of the decisions of the Seventh Congress
of the Communist International before expressing its opinion on
the question of united action. In order to give you the opportunity
for this we wished to wait before making a concrete proposal
that negotiations on this question should be undertaken. But the
international situation is so tense, the danger of a new imperialist

6

 

 

..w. ‘:u mu . ~  v -  " ,-.'.2’ ' '

war breaking out is so grave and imminent, -that not a single
hour must be lost.

The recent conference of the Labor and Socialist Interna-
tional and the International Federation of Trade Unions proposed
a number of measures against the threatening war. The Com-
munist International welcomes your decision. But everything
that has so far been done on your part and ours is still inade-
quate in face of the grave menace. The efforts of both Interna-
tionals to save peace must be united. Both Internationals must
act in unison, and by their joint efforts arrest the hand of the
fascist warmongers.

Joint action by both the Internationals would rouse the work-
ing class, and the latter would also carry along with it the sup-
porters of peace among other classes of the population. It would
rouse whole nations to ﬁght for peace. It would launch such a
mighty movement against war that under its pressure the League
of Nations would be forced to take more effective action against
the aggression of Italian and German fascism. It is not too late
to avert the frightful catastrophe towards wh-ich the fascist
criminals are driving humanity.

Tomorrow this may be impossible.

This is why we propose to the Secretariat of the Labor and
Socialist International immediately to discuss at a joint con-
ference of representatives of both Internationals how best, by
joint effort, to carry out the measures for the preservation of
peace indicated by your International and ours.

On behalf of the Executive Committee of the Communist In-

ternational we are delegating to this conference Comrades Cachin ‘

and Thorez from France, Comrade Pollitt from Great Britain and
Comrade Schwerm from Czechoslovakia.

We request your reply at the earliest possible moment.
Greetings!

On behalf of the Executive Committee
of the Communist International,
GEORGI DIMITROFF, General Secretary.

October 7: “For Several Days Al-
ready War Has Been Raging in Africa.”

TO THE SECRETARIAT OF THE LABOR AND SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL,
BRUSSELS.

Comrades:

For several days already war has been raging in Africa. The
international working class was unable to avert it, just as it was
unable in time to prevent fascism coming to power in Germany,
because its organizations did not act solidly and unitedly. The
working class, therefore, proved unable to launch a powerful
popular movement of all classes and peoples anxious for peace
against the fomenters of war, and thus erect an insurmo-untable
barrier to war.

On September 25, i.e., eight days before the outbreak of mil-
itary activities, we sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Labor
and Socialist Inte-rnational. We proposed that a joint conference
of representatives of both Internationals, should immediately dis-
cuss how best, by joint effort, to carry out the measures for the
preservation of peace indicated by your International and ours.
The Secretariat of the Labor and Socialist International informed
us that the Executive Committee of the Labor and Socialist Inter-
national would consider our proposal. But we have not yet re-
ceived a favorable reply from the Executive Committee of the
Labor and Socialist International. The fact that joint actions by
both the Internationals were not immediately organized un-
doubtedly encouraged the fascist warmonge-rs to start military
operations.

Since many opportunities have already been missed, it is all
the more our duty and yours at the present moment to strive
to bring about the cessation of military operations and to prevent
the war spreading to other countries. Any further delay in estab-
lishing unity of action to combat the war which has already
begun would be of serious consequences. Those who in this grave
hour still refuse, or still hesitate, to unite all the forces of the
working class and all the to-ilers and to adopt every means to
bring about the cessation of the military operations of the Italians
against Ethiopia and to prevent war spreading to other parts of

the world and becoming the prelude to a new world war, incur
a grave historical responsibility towards the proletariat of the
world. '

In the interests of peace, we, in the name of the millions of
workers who in your ranks and ours are demanding a united
front in order to combat war and fascism, once more stress the
urgent necessity for a favorable reply from the Executive Com-
mittee of the Labor and Socialist International to our proposal.

We once more inform you that the delegation appointed by
us is in Paris awaiting negotiations, and we request you to address
your communication regarding the place and time of negotiations
to Comrade Cachin at the offices of l’Humanité.

On behalf of the Executive Committee
of the Communist International,

GEORGI DIMITROFF, General‘ Secretary.

WHAT WILL THE NEW’ WAR BE LIKE?

But what will the new ‘war he like? Army oiﬁcers, men of
science, and novelists have tried to depict the horrors of mechan-
ized war, of chemical and bacteriological war. But we refrain
from making any predictions because the most sensational dis-
coveries are being kept secret and because it is diﬂicult to con-
ceive the degree of barbarity which the bourgeoisie are capable of
reaching. The “small” wars which have been fought during
recent years in South America between the vassal statespof Great

Britain and the United States afford a terrible example in this '

matter. Paraguay, which has a population of a million, had ﬁfty
thousand killed; Bolivia, with three and a half million inhabi-
tants, had seventy thousand killed; terrible ﬁgures compared with
the corresponding losses of the big capitalist states during the
World War. The war of these little countries stopped because
its horrors were so great that the whole population rose in revolt
to put an end to it. And this was only a “small” war!

We cannot foresee what will take place when the most per-
fected means of destruction are put into operation on a mass scale.
We know only that the next war will be a general war of all
