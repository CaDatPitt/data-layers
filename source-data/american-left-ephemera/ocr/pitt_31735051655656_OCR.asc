THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FOREIGN-BORN

What is the importance of the foreign—born as
1) a section of the population?
2) a section of the voting force?
3) a Section of the industrial army?

PROPORTION OF THE FOREIGN-BORN TO THE
TOTAL POPULATION

As Shown by Chart No. 1 On the cover, the foreign—bOrn
and foreign stock make up 34.8% of the total population of
the United States. According to an analysis of the census

8

ﬁgures for 1920 the foreign—born make up 13.4% of the
total population. Those of foreign stock, that is whose
parents were fo-reign-born, make up 21.4%. The Negro
native—born are another 9.8%, and the native white of
native white parentage make up the remaining 55.3% of
the population. Thus it is that the foreign—born stock com-
prises over one-third of the total population.

PROPORTION OF THE FOREIGN—BORN OVER
TWENTY-ONE TO THE TOTAL POPULATION
OVER TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD,

According to a statement made recently by the chair-
man of the Executive Council of the Civic Federation, “out
of 54,000,000 eligible voters in the United States, only
26,000,000 votes, or 48%, were cast.” There are today over
6,000,000 naturalized foreign—born citizens eligible to vote-—
that is one-ninth, or over 11%, of the total number of voters
in the United States.

The political power that this one group could wield is
suggested by the fact that it numbers nearly one—fourth of
the number of votes cast in the last election. But because of
the wholesale disenfranchisement practised on large sections
of the working class, notably the Negro masses in the South,
and because of the tendency of many of the qualiﬁed voters
not to make use of the vote, a so-under analysis can be made
by taking as a basis the entire population over twenty—one
years of age who are potential voters.

Chart No. 2, on the back cover, shows the composition
of this population. Only 50% are native white of native
white parentage, 9.5% are Negroes, and 39.5% are foreign-
born or of foreign parentage. Actually 19% are of foreign
parentage, and 10.3% are, as Secretary of Labor Davis has
pointed out, naturalizable.

Thus it can be seen that the worst exploited groups, the
Negroes and the workers of foreign stock, have a potential
voting force of 40% of the total voting strength and if we
add the naturalizable foreign—born to this group it equals

V the voting strength of the native white of native white

parents. Of course the many obstacles which have been
intentionally created to prevent these workers from partici-

9

pating in the elections make the possibility of their express-
ing their strength effectively through voting.

THE FOREIGN—BORN WORKERS IN INDUSTRY

It is, however, when we consider the foreign-born
workers from the standpoint of their part in the industrial
life of the nation that the great part they play in the life of
this country becomes apparent.

Lauck and Sydenstricker give ﬁgures to prove that 58%
of the industrial force of America are fore1Ign—born workers.
In their book ”Conditions of Labor in American Industries,”
they present a table showing that from 60-70% of the
workers in the clothing, mining, iron and steel, meat
packing, and leather manufacturing industries are foreign-
born.

The National Association of Manufacturers in its ofﬁcial
organ, “American Industries,” states that the foreign—born
workers are found in the basic industries according to the
following table:

PROPORTION OF FOREIGN-BORN TO NATIVE WORKERS IN THE
BASIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

Name of Industry Percentage of Foreign-Born Workers
Iron and steel manufacturing ....................... --58%
Slaughtering and meat packing ____________________ _-61‘7,,
Bituminous coal mining ____________________________ __620/0
Woolen and worsted manufacturing ................. --62%
Cotton goods manufacturing ________________________ _-62%
Clothing manufacturing _____________________________ __69%
Leather manufacturing _____________________________ __67%
Furniture manufacturing ____________________________ -_59%
Oil reﬁning _______________________________________ __67%

Turning to the geographical distribution of the Foreign-
Born in the United States, we ﬁnd that 11 millions of the 13
millions are located in the East and North—Centra1, or indus-
trial sections.

A comparison between the native white population, the
Negro population and the,foreign—born population in the
different districts shows that in the industrial centers of the
Northeast and Central, as well as in the mining districts of
the West, the main proportion of foreign-born is high and

10

the proportion of Negro low. In these districts the foreign-
born workers are the main source of cheap, unskilled labor.

On the other hand, in the South where the Negroes are
the lowest—p-aid so—called common laborers, the proportion
of the foreign—born is small and the Negro runs corres-
pondingly high.

The following table, made up from the ﬁgures of the
United States census of 1920, shows the distribution of the
foreign—born, native white, and Negro, both as to number
and percentage of the population.

NEW ENGLAND AND EAST NORTH CENTRAL

In Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Connecticut, where the foreign~born are
25.3% of the total population, the leading industries are

I textiles, boot and shoe manufacturing, and in these indus-

tries the foreign-born workers are to be found working the
longest hours for the lowest wages. In the Middle Atlantic
States, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the
4,960,418 foreign—born are 22.1% of the total population,
the clothing industries, the steel and the mines as well as
general manufacturing, employ a majority of foreign—born
workers.

This holds true for the East North Central district,
the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and
Ohio. Mr. S. L. Lawton of Hancock, Michigan, stated in
the hearings before the Committee on Naturalization and
Immigration of the House, January 1923, “98% of all men
working in the mines (of Michigan) are of foreign birth.”

Mr. J. M. Larkin, Assistant to the President of the

11

Bethlehem Steel Company, in the hearings before the Com-
mittee on Naturalization and Immigration of the House of
Representatives, January 1923, also said: “From 40-45%
of the employees of the subsidiary companies of the Bethle-
hem Steel Corporation are people of foreign birth. They
comprise, in the main, the following nationalities: Austro-
Hungarian, Slavic, Russian, Italian, Swedish, Polish,
Greek, Portuguese, and Spanish, coming in the main from
the central and southern European countries.”

The Chairman: “Do you think it is a good plan to be
continually bringing a stream of aliens here to work 12-hour
shifts in a hard industry?”

Mr. Larkin: “I will answer that by saying that if the
industry is to progress and to operate we must have this
class of labor or a similar class.”

Today, if the steel industry is to “progress,” if the divi-
dends are to be paid, if the industry is to continue to roll up
millions in proﬁts the employers must have the foreign-born
workers and they must intensify the exploitation and in--
crease their ruthless oppression. Or they must have a
“similar class” for like purposes.

The only “similar class” is that of the Negro workers.
In the southern states the Negroes——a disenfranchised

. group—are working in the textile mills, the mines and the

steel mills under much the same conditions of discrimina-
tion, degradation and exploitation as is the lot of the
foreign—born in the industrial and mining centers farther
north.
SOUTH ATLANTIC

In the South Atlantic district—Maryland, the District
of Columbia, Virginia and West Virginia, North and South
Carolina, Georgia and Florida—the Negroes are 30.9% of
the total population and the foreign-born are only 2.3%.
Large numbers of Negroes are farm laborers, tenant
farmers, but it is also true to the extent that where there is

an industrial development the Negroes are the so—called

common laborers.
EAST SOUTH CENTRAL AND WEST SOUTH CENTRAL

In the East South Central, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mis-
sissippi, and where the Negroes are 28.4%, the foreign-

12

born workers are only 0.8%. In these states the Negroes
are working in the mines and mills and factories under con-
ditions of work, hours, and wages very much as prevail for
the foreign—born workers in similar industries.

Much the same is true for the West South Central, the
states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. In
these states the Negroes take the place of the foreign-born
workers as the most oppressed section of the working class.

MOUNTAIN AND PACIFIC DISTRICTS

In the Mountain district, the states of Montana, Wyo-
ming, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New
Mexico, as well as in the Paciﬁc district—the states of
Washington, Oregon, and California—-where the Negro
population drops off to less than one per cent, the propor-
tion of the foreign-born rises to 13.6% for the Mountain
and to 18.6% for the Paciﬁc.

The foreign—born workers are back at their places in
the mines--digging the coal, and m.etals, at work in the
smelters and oil reﬁneries,

WEST NORTH CENTRAL

The West North Central———North and South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri-—non-
manufacturing states, have the largest proportion of N ativc
White to be found in any district, 86.5%. The proportion
of foreign—born——l0.9%——are largely at work in the mines.
There is, however, one factor which is worth noting in re-
gard to this district. It includes 200,000 foreign-born
farmers—more than a third of the total number of foreign-
born farmers in the United States.

* * *

These ﬁgures show that the foreign-born workers
occupy a position in American industry which makes them
the most essential group in bringing into existence the wealth
produced in the United States.

Their work has created the great fortunes of their ex-
ploiters. Frederick J. Haskins has well depicted their place

13

i-n the life of America in his poem, “The Immigrant”:

I have shouldered my burden as the American man-of-all-
work.

I contribute eighty—ﬁve per cent of all the labor in the
slaughtering and meat-packing industries.

I do seven-tenths of the bituminous coal mining.
I do sevelrl1ty— eight per cent of all the work in the wool-en
mi s. '
I contribute nineteen-twentieths of all the clothing.
I manufacture more than half of the shoes.
I build four—ﬁfths of all the furniture.
I make half the collars, cuﬁfs and shirts.
I turn out four-ﬁfths of all the leather.
I make half the gloves.
I reﬁne nearly nineteen-twentieths of the sugar.

A I make half of the tobacco and cigars.

And yet, I am the great American problem.

When I pour out my blood on your altar of labor, and lay
down my life as a sacriﬁce to your god of to-il, and
make no more comment than at the fall of a. sparrow.

But my brawn is woven into the warp and woof of the fabric
of your national.

My children shall be your children and your land shall be
my land because my sweat and my blood will cement
the foundations of the America of Tomorrow.

THE OPPRESSION OF THE FOREIGN-BORN
WORKERS.

LIVING CONDITIONS

The for.eign—born worker ﬁnds the dice loaded against
him from the moment he arrives. The living conditions in
our slums, industrial towns, and mining camps are horrible.
Thomas Burgess, in “The Foreign-Born Americans and
Their Children,” paints in the following picture their life
in America:

“Bitterly hard to-il, and bitterly hard living have been the
beginning of most of their lives in their adopted country,
and such have often continued to the end.

“Hard, terribly hard is the lot of the poor little children—
those who survive the tenement life of our great cities, liv-
ing in homes of some two rooms with their large families,

15

often mixed indiscriminately with additional boarders.
There are two blocks on the East Side of New York cover-
ing less than nine acres in all, that house eight thousand
souls.

“Whole families toil their lives out; sewing all day and
far into the night in reeking tenements ﬁnishing garments
for the merest pittance, making myriads of artiﬁcial ﬂowers,
neckwear and the like.”

The living conditions are even worse in the mining and
mill towns. Here the company is also the storekeeper and sells
the food and necessities for the family at exorbitant
prices. Often a system of charging and counter-charging
goes on so that the wages are paid by the company back
into its own pocket and the workers are kept always in
debt, always in fear of eviction and always facing the
spectre of unemployment which means starvation.

Large numbers of foreign-born workers ﬁnd their way
into the mines. It is impossible to give an adequate picture
of what a miner’s life is, but the following extract from a
recent book, “The Government——Strike Breaker” by Jay
Lovestone tells the story.

“Irregularity of employment is one of the worst diseases
afﬂicting the miner’s life. It means aggravated unemploy-

vment for him. The miner cannot know today whether

there will be wo-rk for him tomorrow. Many times, at the
whistle’s call of “work” in the evening and the morning,
the miner will rise at 4 o’clock in the morning, get himself
ready for work, walk more than ﬁve miles to the pit, and
then be informed that there is nothing doing because the
railroad company had failed to furnish empty cars.

“ ‘Men working in this district (Crooksville) never have
an opportunity to straighten themselves or straighten their
backs during the day until they go out of the mine in the
evening, unless they choose to lie ﬂat on the ﬂoor or bottom-
of the mine. They enter the mine in the morning and
sometimes they have to walk for miles in a stooped position
to their work. They are frequently compelled to go
through mud and water in order to reach their work.’ ” (1)

“Pneumonia, consumption and colds are not uncommon
amongst the miners. They are always exposed to gas and

16

dust explosions, to the falling of slate and coal, mine damp,
ﬁre, drowning and electrocution. Denial of sunlight and
fresh air accompany the starvation wage of the miner in
his hard lot.

In 1921, despite severe unemployment, the toll of killed
in the mines was 1,973 according to the report of the
Bureau of Mines.”

EXPLOITATION OF THE FOREIGN-BORN

The form of exploitation of the foreign-born worker
varies in the different localities, but there are certain gen-
eral practices Which are to be found where foreign-born
workers are numerous.

EXPLOITATION IN SECURING A JOB

“Employment Agencies.”

The Commission on Industrial Relations Report of 1915,
states: “The business as a whole reeks with fraud, extor-
tion and ﬂagrant abuses of every kind. A charging of fees
out of proportion to services rendered, discrimination of
charges to different applicants for the same job, sending men
long distances only to ﬁnd no one had ordered men. Split-
ting fees with foremen and superintendents, leading fore-
men to hire and discharge more often than necessary in
order to have more men hired through agent; misrepre-
sentation of employment; and terms of employment, ex-
ploitation by countrymen under the so-called padrone sys-
tem under which foreign-born are recruited and exploited
by employment agents of their own race.”

EXPLOITATION BY FOREMEN AND SUPERINTENDENTS AFTER
SECURING Jon

“The foreman and his superiors and inferiors some-
times form a regular hierarchy of exploitation in which
the ignorant immigrant is the “victim”. Often the im-
migrants are forced to pay monthly bonuses to a
superior in order to keep their jobs. An example of this
is the case of 19 Lithuanian workmen who had signed af-
ﬁdavits to the effect that they are regularly paying part

of their wages to one foreman in order to k-eep their
jobs, within two weeks after the afﬁdavit had been
presented to the president of the corporation the 19 men
were ﬁred.” Report of the Mass. Commission on Im-
migration, 1914, Page 40.

WAGES

According to Lauck and Sydenstricker in “Condi—
tions of Labor in American Industry,” “Statistics of an-
nual earnings of native and foreign-born show a con-
siderably lower economic status for the latter group,
both for males and females.” In the mines of Michi-
gan which employ almost entirely foreign-born workers,
“over 80 per cent of the miners were found to be earning,
at annual rates, between $700 and $800.”

WITH HOLDING WAGES

It has been shown by the investigation conducted
'by the Carnegie foundation for the advancement of
Teaching by Reginald Heber Smith that: “Hundreds of
thousands of men, many of them immigrants, have been
unable to collect their wages honestly earned . . . . . . . .”

The practice of witholding wages is one to which
the foreign—born workers in unorganized industries fall
an easy prey. Under the pretext of being learners they
are often paid much less than the regular wage for such
work. On the pretext of having spoiled material or on
the pretext of theft, wages are witheld. Promised over-
time pay is often not forthcoming on the ground that
no written contract was made. The records of the New
York Legal Aid Society are full of such cases. For in-
stance, “a Russian woman who was employed at $7 a
week as a button hole maker was informed at the end
of the ﬁrst week that she would have to work four
weeks for nothing before she would be entitled to any
pay.”—The Immigrants Day in Court.

THE FOREIGN—BORN WORKER AND THE COURTS

Ignorant of the English language, our laws, our
court procedure, the foreign-born worker is the victim

18

of fraud and dishonesty practiced by unscrupulous and

‘ vicious constables, lawyers and judges.

LAWYERS AND LAWYERS’ RUNNERS

Hanging about the corridors of our court houses and
homes of justice are to be found the lawyers’ runners
who drum up business, usually of the most vicious sort
for their employers.

In 1918 the Massachusetts Bureau of Immigration
made an investigation which showed: “Over twenty in-
dividuals were found daily in the corridors adjoining
the First and Second Sessions of the Municipal Criminal
Court of Boston, soliciting business for attorneys and
furnishing ’bail for persons arrested.

“These runners dealt mainly with the foreign—born,
ignorant of our customs, our language and our legal
procedure. Pretending to have great inﬂuence with the
courts, the police and the district attorney, they were
ready to guarantee the discharge of accused persons,
whether innocent or guilty, on payment of a fee to them
or to the attorney whom they represented. On the
other hand they threatened with severe penalties, long
prison terms or heavy ﬁnes, persons accused of even
minor offenses, for which in any case, the penalty would
be light, should they fail to engage the attorneys recom-
mended by the runners.” This form of intimidation,
blackmail and swindle is carried on by the lawyers who
in many cases are directly in the pay of the prosecution.

COMPENSATION ILLUSTRATIONS

Justice courts such as exist in many states, notably
Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania, ﬁnd in the foreign-born
workers a source of unlimited spoils. The judges in
such courts do not have to know any law and they are
not salaried officials, but depend on the fees, costs and
ﬁnes levied in cases brought before them. Such judges,
having practically unlimited power, with the con-

nivance of their constables and thugs, round up the

foreigner, trumped up on minor charges, and collect
court fees which are d1V1(l€Cl between the judge and

19

the constable. This exploitation is the kind of justice
handed out to the foreign-born.

According to “The Immigrants Day in Court” by
Claghorn, “In Pennsylvania justice had combined with
certain railroad detectives to arrest immigrant women
for stealing coal from the railroad tracks. The value
of the coal stolen in many cases was not more than ten
or ﬁfteen cents, but the wom-en were brought before the
judge in large numbers for trial, had to pay from $20
to $25 for ﬁnes and costs. As the women were seldom
able to pay this in one amount, it was made payable in
weekly instalments for $1 to $2, and for a long time it
was a common sight to see a line of 20 to 25 women
standing outside these justice courts waiting to pay the
weekly instalments on their ﬁnes.”

In the Aldermanic courts the same conditions pre-
Vail. In Pennsylvania for example there is a state
game law under which the alien is not allowed to have
in his possession either ﬁre arms or a dog. The law in
this case provided for a ﬁne of $25 for infraction, half
of which goes to the informant, the rest to the justices,
constables, etc., quoting again, “In many cases the alien
was ﬁned because his children had some small pet dog,
obviously not a game dog, and as to ﬁr-e arms, con-

stables are known to have arrested several foreign—born

residents under this law because their children had been
playing with toy pistols.” Claghorn says, “The alder-
men, like the justices are paid by fees, and their in-

I comes are out of all proportion to the services they per-

form. In Pittsburg quite recently it was estimated that
one alderman received over $10,000 a year in fees, an-
other over $20,000. In no case does an alderman take
less than $5,000 a year. The aldermen for the most part
are men of mediocre abilities and attainments, without
legal training, and in their courts are found the usual
evils of the justice court.”

~When he comes into court in connection with a strike or
any form of industrial dispute the foreign—born worker is
met with an attitude which was expressed by a New York
magistrate "who said that he believed in collective bargaining
but that “foreigners who were allowed in this country

20

must be thankful, obey the law, and keep their mouths shut.”
In the strike of the clothing workers in Cincinnati in 1919,
where a large percentage of the strikers were foreign-born,
the attorney for the strikers said, in no case were they
given a fair trial, and the fact that they were foreign-born
practically convicted them before their cases came up in
court.

The history of terrorization and manhandling used by
the police, the cossacks, and the troops, as the case might
be, in the Textile strike at Lawrence, in Passaic and Pat-
terson in 1919, as well as the great steel strike of 1919 are
bloody testimonials to the methods of Americanization em-
ployed by the American capitalist class. In each case the
majority of the strikers were foreign—born.

The story of the practical enslavement of the foreign-
born workers has been told again and again in the labor
history of the United States. The conditions to which the
foreign—born workers were obliged to submit in the steel
industry, the mining industry and the textile industry are
but outstanding examples of the lot of these workers in
industry generally.

LAWS. DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE FOR-
EIGN-BORN

It is not only in the operation of the courts that the im-
migrant is victimized but written upon the statute books of
many of the states are laws which restrict the foreign born,
his rights and freedom. There are for example laws in
fourteen or ﬁfteen states which limit in some ways his right
to acquire and hold property. Davis in his recent book
“The Russian Immigrant,” states certain of the laws as
follows:

In the state of Oregon, foreigners have no right to read
newspapers and magazines which are not printed in Eng-
lish. The same law is proposed in the states of Maryland,
Kentucky and New York.

In the state of Pennsylvania, the foreigners have no
right to keep dogs. _

In the states o-f Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee

21

and Washington, the foreigner has no right to teach. The
same law is pending in the state of Massachusetts.

In the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Washington, Nebraska, Kansas, Maryland, Oregon and
New Hampshire, in case of accident, a foreigner does not
receive the compensations which are due to the American
citizen in a similar case. This law exists, notwithstanding
the fact that among foreigners there are a great many more
a.ccidents than among Americans.

In the states of Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey, Cali-
fornia, Arizona, Rhode Island, Idaho, New Mexico, Wy-
oming, foreigners cannot be employed for public works. In
Arizona, if a foreigner tries to evade this law, he is ﬁned
$1,000, or imprisoned for six months, or both.

In the states of Massachusetts and Oregon, the same
law is before the legislature. In the states of Massachusetts,
New York, Washington, Illinois, Utah and Louisiana, a
foreigner is accepted for employment on public works only
if there is no American to be found in his place.

In the state of Idaho, the foreigner is accepted for work
in a factory only if he has his ﬁrst citizenship papers.

In the states of Illinois, California, Minnesota, Idaho,
Texas, Missouri, Nebraska, Indiana, Montana, Arizona,
Oklahoma, Kentucky, Iowa and Mississippi, aliens have no
right to own property, or the ownership is limited between
ﬁve and twenty years. In many places, foreigners are al-
lowed to own not more than 320 acres, or are without the
right of succession.

In the state of Maryland, it is proposed not to allow
the foreigners to carry on commerce at all.

In the state of Louisiana, foreigners cannot do any
public printing work.

Besides these, there are many offending customs in the
American attitude toward the foreigners. From all this it
is plain that the relationship to the foreigners is not very
warm. Foreigners having to bear all this cannot write
home very enthusiastic letters about America, and, of course,
they want to leave, the sooner the better. '

If the work of the foreigner is appreciated, if he is need-

22

ed in the mines, in the construction of subways, and for
the work in the factories and farms, one must give him
human rights, and one must not offend him at every step.

Some of the worst state laws are as follows:

Kansas: Unless the alien has ﬁled a declaration of in-
tention to become a citizen, his property shall escheat to the
state, in the event of his death. (1)

Michigan: Persons not citizens can teach in the public
schools only if they have ﬁled their intention of becoming
citizens. (2)

Nebraska: All public meetings——political meetings or
conventions, the purpose and object of which and the con-
sideration and discussion of political or non-political sub-
jects of general interest, or relating to the well-being of
any class or'organization——shall be conducted in the English
language exclusively; providing the provisions of this Act
shall not apply to meetings or conventions held for the pur-
pose of religious teachings, instruction or worship, or lodge
organizations. (3)

Aliens are prohibited from holding any public ofﬁce in
the state. (4) .

Aliens may not teach in any public, private, or parochial
school; (5)

It is illegal for aliens to own, keep, or have ﬁrearms in
their possession. (6)

Nevada: Only a citizen of the United States or a
person who has declared his intention of becoming one
shall ‘be employ-ed in the construction of public works
in any office or department of the state. Exception is
made in the case of convicts, and exchange instructors
in the University, from North and South American
countries. (7)

New Mexico: The possession of a shot gun or riﬂe,
or the hunting of wild birds, game or ﬁsh, by unna-
turalized, foreign—born residents is prohibited. (8)

Oregon: It is unlawful to display or circulate or offer
for sale any newspaper or periodical except in English
unless a literal translation shall be conspicuously displayed.

The employers are creating by law a class of wage
labor which can be compelled to accept low wages and bad
working conditions, and then using these oppressed and
exploited workers to destroy the organizations and reduce
the standard of living of the native and foreign—born alike.

They hope through oppressive exception laws directed at
the foreign-born workers to create a class of workers who
cannot ﬁght back, and thus weaken and destroy the whole
labor movement.

Protection of the Foreign-Born

on Registration of the Foreign-Born

III Contract Labor—The Colt Immigration Bill
IV Revocation of Naturalization Papers

THE NEW OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE FOREIGN-
BORN

Now it is proposed that there be added to these state laws,
discriminating against the foreign—born workers, oppressive
federal laws through which the exploitation of the foreign-
born can be intensiﬁed.

In a Manifesto issued on January 10, the Workers
Party of America stated the case with a simplicity and
directness which cannot be bettered.

AMERICAN WORKERS!
PROTECT THE FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS

AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF THE CAPITALISTS
AND THE GOVERNMENT

Manifesto of the W orkers Party of America

The capitalists, with the aid of the Government, are
launching a new attack on the workers of this country.

They are preparing, through oppressive laws, to make it
impossible for the foreign—born workers to ﬁght against the
open shop and for better wages and working conditions.

They hope that by enslaving the foreign-born workers
they will be able to force the open shop and lower wages on
native and foreign-born workers alike.

The foreign—born workers have suffered for many years

25

in this country because of their inability to speak the lan-
guage and their lack of knowledge of the country. The
capitalists have taken advantage of this to rob and oppress
the foreign-born even worse than they rob and oppress the
native-born workers.

They have compelled the foreig—born workers to accept

low wages. They have kept down the standard of living of '

the foreign—born workers and compelled‘ them to live under
the worst possible conditions. In the mining regions and
steel districts and many other industrial centers the foreign
born workers have been herded together in shack—towns,
without social life, without recreation, mere slaves off the
bosses.

. .In recent years the foreign—born workers have joined
the native-born in the struggle against the bosses, the open
shop and low wages. The bosses have learned that they can
no longer use the foreign-born workers to cut the standard
of living of all American workers. The great steel strike of
1919 showed that. The repeated strikes of the coal miners,
in whose organization there are many foreign-born workers,
showed that. The strike of the clothing workers and the
textile workers, whose unions are almost entirely made up
of foreign-born workers, proved that.

In order to stop the movement of the foreign-born work-
ers to join the native-born in building strong labor unions,
which will protect the interests of the foreign-born and
native workers alike, the capitalists and the Government are
proposing to pass oppressive laws directed against the for-
eign-born and intended to keep them hopeless slaves of the
capitalists.

THE FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS ARE TO BE
REGISTERED. THEY ARE TO BE FINGER—PRINT-
ED AND PHOTOGRAPHED LIKE CRIMINALS. IF
NATURALIZED THEY ARE TO HAVE THEIR
CITIZEN’S PAPERS TAKEN FROM THEM IF
THEIR CONDUCT DOES NOT SUIT THE BOSSES.
THEY ARE TO BE DEPORTED IF THEY PARTI-
CIPATE IN STRIKES OR MAKE SPEECHES IN
STRIKE MEETINGS.

26

All these measures to keep the foreign—born workers in
the grip of the employers are now being proposed‘ by Gov-
ernment authorities. '

Secretary of Labor Davis in his annual report advocated
the annual enrollment of all foreign—born, stating, “They
must be made worthy of the high privilege of citizenship in
the United States. To do this we must know who they are
and what they are. For this purpose I propose to enroll the
stranger within our gates. To learn to know him, to aid
him to become a real American if he is worthy, or to send
him whence he came if he proveunworthy.”

President Harding in his message to Congress on Dec.
9th, stated: “There are pending bills for the registration of
the alien who has come to our shores. I wish the passage
of such an act might be expedited . . . . Before enlarging
the immigration quotas we had better provide registration
for aliens, those now here or continually pressing for ad-
mission, and establish our examination board abroad to
make sure of desirables only.”

That the government is merely carrying out instructions
of the employing class is shown by the similarity of the re-
commendations of the Secretary of -Labor and of the
President of the United States, to the demand, of the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers in a letter to its mem-
bers, “That the United States assert the right to register,
distribute, educate and otherwise supervise the alien during
the period of his alienage.’_’

That the plans for registration, ﬁnger printing and cat-
aloging of the foreign-born are but a step in the direction
of the registration and cataloging of all workers is shown by
the fact that recently a bill was introduced in the Legis-
lature of the State of Michigan which provides, “That every
person in the State of Michigan shall be required to register
once a year with the authorities, giving information as to
name, sex, age, date and place of birth, color, nationality,
citizenship, present and past address, occupation and one or
more ﬁngerprints. This bill also forbids any ﬁrm or or-
ganization from employing anyone who is not registered.”

THE NEW IMMIGRATION POLICY

For over a half century the employing class has encour-
aged mass immigration to this country. Great industrial
organizations had their representatives in Europe to paint
rosy pictures of the conditions in the United States in order
to induce the workers of Europe to come here. The em-
ployers urged the foreign-born workers to come to the
United States in order to provide themselves with an unfail-
ing supply of cheap labor.

The foreign-born workers, who came to this country by
the millions as a result of this propaganda of the employers,
did not understand the customs of the country. They had
no political rights. They were strangers in a strange land.
They could consequently be oppressed and exploited, paid
low wages and subjected to worse working conditions,
without being able to- make an effective resistance. Thus the
employers coined great proﬁts out of these foreign—born
workers.

During the period of the war in Europe the stream of
immigration to this country was dammed. The foreign—born
workers already here became more familiar with the life of
the country. Even before the war there had been great
outbursts of protest from the unorganized foreign—born
workers. The textile strike of Lawrence, Mass., the strike
of the steel workers at McKees Rocks, great struggles in the
mining industry showed that the foreign—born workers were
restive under the oppressive conditions from which they
suﬁered. At the end of the war came the great strikes of
the steel workers and the miners, a great majority of whom
were foreign—born workers. These struggles showed the
employers that the foreign—born workers were no longer
docile slaves but were ready to unite with the native—born
workers in the struggle for a higher standard ‘of living and
better working conditions. .

With the end of the war-time prosperity and the coming
of hard times, with millions unemployed, the employers did
not need foreign-born immigrants and_the law restricting
immigration was passed. Now, however, with the period
of depression modiﬁed, the employers are planning to se-
cure cheap labor in a new form.

28

Realizing the danger and opportunities oﬁ‘ered in an im-
migration law further to oppress and enslave the Workers,
the National Association of Manufacturers has likewise
given its instructions, as follows: A

“The Secretary of Labor ought to be authorized, upon
presentation to him of satisfactory evidence of a continu-
ing shortage of labor of a particular class or type, to admit
otherwise admissible aliens in" excess of the quota until in
his judgment such conditions are improved.”

Perley Morse, a Government investigator, in The World
of December 3, 1923, goes even farther. He advocates
careful selection in Europe and distribution in America by
a Commission, “This commission should intelligently dis-
tribute the immigrants throughout the United States allow-
ing none to settle in our big cities. Further, it should be
their duty to see that they stay in the country and do not
go to the cities. This should be obligatory for a period of
ten years, after which time, if the immigrant has in every
Way proven himself worthy, he should automatically be-
come a citizen of the United States and a certiﬁcate of
citizenship should be granted him.”

This recommendation was one of the forerunners of the
Coltimmigration act which was introduced into the last
Congress. Although no action was taken to change the
Immigration Law many bills were presented. All were
sidetracked, however, in favor of Senate Bill S 4303—a
bill to permit the introduction of CONTRACT LABOR.

Today the employing class is faced with this dilemma:
The industrial reserve army must be augmented with a new
supply of common, heavy, machine labor. It has been de-
pleted by the cessation of immigration and the attendant
increasing homogeneity of American Labor. We are “back
to normalcy” with the shortage of ‘labor and 1,500,000 ofﬁ-
cially unemployed according to Secretary of Labor Davis.
Industrially, therefore, the employers want immigration5‘1a-
bor coming from the Balkans and Southern Europe. Polit-
ically, however, such immigration is still “dangerous."
These countries are in a state of ﬂux. Their political to-
morrow is questionable. VVorkers coming from these
countries are looked upon as a source of revolutionary con-

29

tagion. On the other hand, the politically “safer” and “saner”
workers from Northern and Western Europe cannot meet
the industrial demands of our employing class. Furthermore,
even if these workers could meet the industrial demands,
letting them in and getting them to come are two different
propositions. Politically, the employers want Northern
European laborers; industrially, they reject them. Industri-
ally, they must have Southern European laborers; politically,
they must reject them. Senator Colt has introduced the
real answer in his Senate Bill S 4303, which reads as
follows:

“The Secretary of Labor may, upon submission to him
of satisfactory evidence that there is a continuing shortage
of labor of a particular type or class which, after reasonable
effort, has not been found unemployed in the United States,
authorize contracts with and the admission of otherwise
admissible alien labor to such extent as will in his judg-
ment meet such established shortage . . . notwithstanding
that such aliens so authorized may exceed the quotas of
their respective nationalities now admissible under this Act.”
Babson advised all employers to see to it that that bill is
supported, as the solution of the problem from the em-
ployers’ viewpoint lies in importing slave labor on the con-
tract basis,

Under the provisions of this bill it will be possible for
the employers to bring into this country foreign—born work-
ers bound by contract to work for low wages and under
working conditions which no native or foreign—born worker
in this country would accept. Thus the employers propose
to strike a new blow at the standard of living of the whole
working class of the United States. wt»,

CITIZENSHIP PAPERS TO BE REVOKED

Secretary of Labor Davis after proposing to select, ﬁn-
gerprint and distribute the foreign-born workers advocates
as the ﬁnal step for the security of the Dictatorship of the
Capitalists that,

“The law authorizing the Government to institute pro-
ceedings for the revocation of naturalization certiﬁcates
which have been procured through fraud or illegality,

30

should be enlarged so that the Government would have the
authority to revoke naturalization certiﬁcates because of
gross misconduct or disloyalty occurring subsequent to na-
turalization. The purpose of this suggestion is so manifest
that further comment or argument in its favor seems un-
necessary.”

It may be as the Secretary of Labor states that
comment is unnecessary. Undoubtedly the United States
Congress to which he was referring his suggestions knew
exactly what he meant. The question is: Do the 14,000,000
foreign-born in the United States know? Do the 36,000,000
who are either foreign-born or whose parents were foreign-
born, do they know?

Or do the 6,000,000 naturalized foreign—born citizens
realize the attack which is advocated against their citizen-
ship?

These 6,000,000 foreign—born naturalized citizens repre-
sent one-ninth or over 11 percent of the voting force. True,
the majority of them are workers, but Secretary Davis goes
far in thus attacking the foreign-born workers. Let the
American working class give its answer.

III Meaning of the New Attack to the Native
Workers

IV All the Workers Must Unite to Stop This Attack
V How to Defeat the Exploiters
VI A Plan for Organizing the Workers’ Campaign

VIII Conclusion

We have seen that America’s mighty industries have
been largely built up by millions of foreign-born workers.
We have seen that the foreign—born workers comprise
60 to 75 percent of those employed in such basic industries

as coal, mining, steel, clothing and textiles.

We have seen that the foreign—born, the overwhelming
majority of whom are Workers, are a great proportion of
our total population and voting population.

Therefore, the problems and hardships of the millions of
foreign-born workers are of the greatest industrial and po-
litical importance to the native workers.

The wonderful pictures painted by agents of the em-
ploying class to encourage mass immigration to America
are entirely false. The capitalist class has taken advantage
of the foreign—born workers’ ignorance of the language,
customs, and institutions of the country and of their lack of
political rights to force upon them the lowest pay, the
longest hours, and the worst working conditions.

And today the employing class is redoubling the force
and momentum with which it normally oppresses and ex-
ploits the foreign-born workers.

32

A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE AMERICAN WORK-
ERS

Why has the capitalist class launched a new drive against
the foreign-born workers? What does this new attack
mean, to the native workers? To the whole working class,
native and foreign-born workers alike?

Why must all workers unite against the employers in this
new attack upon the foreign-born working masses?

What must the workers do to defeat this offensive of
the exploiters?

How shall the workers organize against the capitalists?

WHY THE NEW DRIVE AGAINST THE FOREIGN-
BORN WORKERS

The oil capitalists, the kings of ﬁnance, the copper
barons, the steel magnates, and the packing and textile lords
are uniting their forces. Witness the giant mergers of the
Anaconda and Chile Copper Cos., the merger of the Indus-
trial Bank and the Manufacturers’ Trust Co. of New York,
the $250,000,000 alliance of the Consolidated Textile Co.
and the Woolen Trust, and the $600,000,000 merger of the
Armour and Morris Packing Cos.

In order to force lower wages, longer hours, unspeak-
able conditions of employment, and a higher cost of living
on all the workers, the employers are uniting their own
forces and trying to divide the working class.

The struggle between the working class and the em-
ploying class, no matter what the nationality, race, or reli-
gion be, is a war. In this war, the class war, as in all other
wars, an army picks the weakest sector in its enemy’s front
as the ﬁrst point of attack. This is the quickest and easiest
way of breaking through and smashing the whole line of the
enemy’s defense.

The employing class has picked the foreign-born workers
as the ﬁrst workingmen to be attacked because they are
the weakest politically, the worst oppressed industrially
and the most handicapped socially. Not knowing the lan-
guage and institutions of the country and often being vic-

33

tims of the prejudice and hatred fostered among the native
workers by the capitalists, the foreign—born workers offer the
easiest picking for the owning class.

Thus‘, the drive of the exploiters against the foreign-
born workingmen is only an entering wedge to split wide
open the army of the working class, native and foreign-
born. The employers’ aim is to pit one section of the work-
ing class against another.

With lower wages and worse conditions of employ-
ment forced upon the many millions of foreign—born work-
ers, the defeat of the better organized and better paid native
workers is made sure. The success of the capitalists in
forcing lower wages, longer hours, and intolerable working
conditions on the native workers is then only a matter of
time.

MEANING OF THE NEW ATTACK TO THE
NATIVE WORKERS

It is clear that the present drive of the employing class
against the foreign—born workers is only preliminary to
and an integral part of the new offensive that is being
prepared against the whole working class~—the native and

the foreign—born workers. The‘American capitalists have

used such tactics before.

In preparation for their “Grand Offensive”——the great
Open Shop Drive of l920—2l———the employers ﬁrst launched
a ﬁerce offensive against the foreign-born workers. They
established a reign of unbridled brutality against these
workers. Hundreds were beaten up, thrown into jails and
deported in the notorious “Red Raids of 1919-20.” In
order to separate the native workers from their foreign-
born brothers, in order to prejudice them against the for-
eign—born workers, the capitalists and their Government
raise ridiculous and false alarms about revolution. The
struggle of the steel workers against the 12 Hour Day and
industrial slavery was branded a “RED” conspiracy. And
the strike of the miners in defense of their meagre pay
was broken by a Government injunction!

With so large a number of the workers intimidated,

34

the capitalists felt safe in launching their Open Shop drive
against the whole working class. The divided workers
were then easily crushed by the united capitalists. Union
after union went down to defeat. Wages were slashed to
the bone. The workers—native and foreign—born—lost
many of the gains won through years of bitter struggle.

The procedure of the capitalists’ attack is clever. First,
the exploiters force the damnable working and living con-
ditions upon the foreign—born workers. Then, the same em-
ploying class curses and condemns the foreign—born lab-
orers to the native workers for the intolerable conditions that
it has forced the foreign-born workers to accept. The
exploiters and their press spread the brazen lie that the
foreign—born workers are a menace to the American stan-
dard of living. The capitalist class thus hides its own guilt
by shifting the blame to the foreign—born workers.

Thus the enmity of the native workers to the capitalists
who are to blame for the falling American standard of liv-
ing is turned from these exploiters and against the foreign-
born workers instead. Thus the employing class misleads
the native workers into believing that their foreign-born
brothers are responsible for lowering wages and lengthen-
ing hours. The American workers are in this way divided
along the artiﬁcial lines of nationality. A disastrous defeat
for the working class is assured and a capitalist victory is
secure.

ALL THE WORKERS MUST UNITE TO STOP
THIS ATTACK

The millions of foreign—born workers employed in the
basic and other industries can be a source of great strength
or terriﬁc weakness to the whole working class in its
struggle against the capitalist class.

When these millions of foreign—born workers are op-
pressed, unorganized and separated from the native work-
ers they are a source of weakness and danger——politically
and industrially—to the whole labor movement.

But if these foreign—born workers are organized and
united industrially and politically with the remaining Amer-

35

ican workers-the native workers——then the working class
can successfully ﬁght back the capitalist attack. Opposed
by a united working class the employers are bound to fail in
their campaign to break the unions, cut the wages, lengthen
the hours of labor and lower the standard of living of all
the American workers———native and foreign-born alike.

In the class struggle against the exploiters, the foreign-
born workers are splendid ﬁghters. Who has forgotten
the heroic ﬁght put up by the many thousands of foreign-
born steel workers against the greedy Steel Trust in the
Great Steel Strike of 1919? And it was the valiant resist-
ance and inspiring solidarity of the foreign-born textile
workers and miners in their great strikes of 1922 that were
highly instrumental in checking the Open Shop drive to
smash the unions and slash the wages of all the workers!

If the American workers are to save themselves from
capitalist slavery, if the American workers are to win
freedom from exploitation and oppression by the employing
class, then all the workers, native and foreign-born must
unite in the common ﬁght. The heroic ﬁghting forces of
the foreign-born workers must become a living part of the
whole Working class army. A divided front of the workers
will crumble before the ﬁrst capitalist onrush of the mighty

. united capitalist army, ﬁnanced by billions of dollars and

ofﬁcered and led by the military and judiciary forces of the
most powerful government.

HOW THE WORKERS CAN DEFEAT THE EX-
PLOITERS

1. All workers must unite and wage a strong campaign
for the removal of all existing exception laws against for-
eign-born workers.

2. All workers——foreign-born and native-must unite
to prevent the enactment of new laws against foreign-born
workers.

3. The labor unions must Wage a strong campaign of
unionization amongst all unorganized Workers, especially
amongst the unorganized foreign-born workers in the basic
industries. .

36

4. All the workers must wage an active campaign to
uproot the prejudices fostered by the employing class against
the foreign—born and to draw the millions of foreign-born
workers more and more into the political life of the country.

A PLAN FOR ORGANIZING THE WORKERS’
' CAMPAIGN ‘

A Council for Protection of the Foreign-Born Workers
should be formed and call upon the workers everywhere
to organize local councils for the protection of
foreign—born workers. These should consist of dele-
gates from labor unions, labor political organizations
and organizations of foreign—born workers, such as beneﬁt
societies, Turn-Vereine and similar organizations.

ORGANIZATION FORM AND PURPOSE OF THE
COUNCIL FOR PROTECTION OF THE FOREIGN
BORN WORKERS

1. The purpose of the Council for Protection of
F oreign—Born Workers should be to carry on a campaign
against all legislation against foreign-born workers and all
other forms of discrimination. It should endeavor to bring
to the «foreign—born workers a realization of the necessity of
their joining the labor unions and participating in the polit-
ical struggles of this country and thus ﬁghting side by side
with the native born workers in the struggle against political
oppression and for a higher standard of living and better
working conditions.

2. The National Committee of the Council for Protec-
tion of Foreign-Born Workers should be made up of repre-
sentatives of national organizations of labor unions, state
federations of labor, central labor bodies, labor political
organizations and of organizations of foreign born which
are predominantly made up of workers, such as beneﬁt
societies, Turn—Vereins, and similar organizations.

3. Local Councils for Protection of the Foreign-Born
VS/orkers should be formed on the same basis as the National
Committee by local branches of organizations such as those

named above.

THE CAPITALIST CLASS——OUR COMMON ENEMY

The American workers are in a struggle against the best
organized and most powerful capitalist class in the world.

In America, more than in any other country in the
world, the workers must, regardless of the place where they
happened to have been born—the foreign—born and the
native workers—~unite, against their common enemy, the
exploiting class." The native and foreign—born workers are
oppressed by the same employing class. The capitalist class
that breaks up the unions—-of the native railroad workers.
is the same owning class that evicts the striking foreign-
born miners. The executive committee of the capitalist
class, the Government, that hands out infamous strikebreak-
ing injunctions against the native striking shopmen is the
same Government that issued injunctions and sent soldiers

with bayonets and machine guns against foreign—born textile

workers, miners and steel workers.

All the American Workers———native and foreign~born—
have but one enemy——the capitalist class that exploits and
oppresses them.

We denounce the laws directed against the foreign-born.

iVVe denounce registration, -ﬁnger-printing and photograph-

ing as un-American and intolerable, making boasts of free—
doin a lying mockery in any land where it is done. Further
enslavement of the foreign-born_ wage earners must not be
permitted as a subterfuge by the bosses to destroy the
standard of living of the American working people. Lab_or’s
best possible answer to this attack’ is increased unity of

‘native and foreign born workers and a more strongly or-

ganized Labor Movement.

CONCLUSION

-Down with the laws oppressing and enslaving the work-
ers, foreign—born as well as native!

38

Away with the outrageous capitalist plans to register,
ﬁnger-print and photograph foreign—born workers like
criminals!

The enemy of the workers is the employing class.

The ﬁght is between those who work for a living and
those who own; between the workers and exploitersl

All the workers, native and foreign-born, must unite as
a class against their common enemy——the Capitalist Class!

Allvfor the unity of the workers against the unity of the
exploitersl

All for the solidarity of the workers against the solidarity
of the exploiters!

Let there be one mighty army of labor!

The United Front of the Workers against the. United
Front of the Capitalists! .

One front against the one enemy !——tl1e employing class

that robs and oppresses all the workers!

NEW PAMPHLETS

Fora Labor Party

By JOHN PEPPER

The greatest issue before the workers of America today is the
immediate formation of a LABOR PARTY. This pamphlet, just
reissued in an enlarged edition of 64 pages, gives the history of
working class parties in the United States. It shows the historical
necessity of the workers forming such a party in order to form a
united front against the capitalist parties. It shows the necessity
of the unions getting back of such a party in order to have a part
in the government of the country. Every radical and worker will
proﬁt by reading this pamphlet.

Russia To-Day, 1923!

By JAMES P. CANNON

Russia To-day, 1923, is just the sort of little propaganda
pamphlet to give to the hard-boiled opponent of Soviet Russia.
It is more than this; it is a convincing propaganda pamphlet
for Communism. Comrade Cannon, Chairman of the Workers
Party and for seven months a fraternal delegate of the Workers
Party to the Executive Committee of the Communist Interna-

tional, gives authentic information as an eye witness of condi-'

tions in Russia and the strength of the Soviet Government.
Subjects dealt with are “Labor Unions in Soviet Russia,”
“Reconstruction,” “The Red Army,” etc.

The Bankruptcy of the

American Labor Movement

By WM. Z. FOSTER

This pamphlet has caused consternation in the ranks of the
reactionaries of the A. F. of L. The - paradox of the most
advanced capitalist industrial system with the most backward
labor movement is analyzed by Foster. His merciless handling
of the misleaders of labor and his keen analysis of the intricate
industrial organizational problems of American workers makes it
an invaluable pamphlet for forward thinking workers.

THE FOREIGN—BORN AMERICANS—WHO THEY
ARE AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM

I Who Are the Foreign-Born Americans? ‘

II Country of Birth of the Foreign-Born Americans:
21) THE F IRST PERIOD -OF IMMIGRATIoN——FOR--
EIGN - BORN POPULATION FROM NORTH
WESTERN EUROPE;
b) THE SECOND PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION-—
FOREIGN—BORN POPULATION FROM CEN-
TRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE;
c) THE RECENT IMMIGRATION.

VVHO ARE THE AMERICANS?

' Are they the ScOttish—born Carnegies, the Ger1nan—bOrn
Schiffs or the English-born Marshall Fields, whose Amer-
icanism has paid them in hundreds of millions of dollars?

OR

Are they the many millions of workers, who, coming
from far lands, have dug the coal, made the steel, laid the
railroad tracks, and run the textile looms——have built the
giant industries of America?

. VVHO ARE THE FoREIGN—BoRN?

There are 13,894,841 F0rez'gn—B0m; 13.4% of the total
population of America. Over 34% of our population are
Of fOreign—bOrn stock, that is either fOreign—born or Of
foreign—born parents. 1

3

There are 6,208,697 Foreign-Born who are over twenty-
one years old—qualiﬁed voters or 10% of the citizens of
America. The 17,816,181 citizens of foreign stock make up
29.2% of the potential voting population of America. Fully
another 10% of the population over 21 years old are, as Sec-
retary of Labor Davis has said, naturalizable. The Foreign-
Born W orkersare 58% of the total employed in American
industries.

In the basic industries, mining, iron and steel, meat pack-
ing, and clothing, 60-70% of the workers are foreign~born.

“AMERICANIZING” THE FOREIGN-BORN

What has been the lot of these foreign-born American
workers? The longest hours and the lowest wages; the
worst housing and the poorest schooling; and discriminatory
State and National laws against them. This has been the
lot of over 34 million immigrants who have come to the
United States within the last hundredyears.

Millions of foreign—born workers, herded in the mining
and industrial centers of America, have, with sweat and
blood, ground out fabulous proﬁts for the employing class.
And today it is against these workers that the employing
class is launching a new offensive. This offensive is part
of the organized campaign to intensify the oppression and
exploitation of all the workers—-Native and Foreign. p The
capitalists aim to foster and perpetuate articial divisions
in the ranks of the workers, divisions along lines of na-
tionality. ‘

It is the task of all workers regardless of their place
of birth to unite and present one front to the common
enemy in the common str-uggle——-the ﬁght against the ex-
ploitation of those who work by those who o,wn—the ﬁght
against capitalist slavery.

“We are a nation of immigrants” is admitted even by
that spokesman of pure Americanism, James A. Emery,
General Council of Nat’l Association of Manufacturers who
adds, “Within a hundred years we have admitted to the
United States some thirty—four and three quarter millions
of immigrants.”

COUNTRY OF BIRTH OF FOREIGN-BORN
THE FIRST PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION

From the countries of Northwestern and Central Europe
came the ﬁrst tide of immigration which swept the builders
of America’s industries to our shores.

According to the United States census of 1920, 47.9%
of the Foreign—B0m in America came from those countries
which furnished the bulk of the earlier immigration.

The following table gives the number from each country
of North Western Europe and also the percentage of the
total foreign-born population represented by each nationality.

The characteristics of this group of foreign—born work-
ers were:
1) they came from industrial countries;
2) they were largely English and German-speaking;
3) their traditions, customs, and habits resembled
those of the people living in the United States.
For these reasons and because of the rapid development
of American industries during this period they quickly
passed out of the ranks of the unskilled Workers, not handi-
capped by differences of language and customs, it was less
possible to exploit them, as a group, separate from the
American—bOrn Workers.

THE SECOND PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION

From South Central, Southern and Eastern Europe
came the second tide bringing the labor which developed
and expanded our railroads, mines and industries. Until
1890 the great portion Of this foreign stream ﬂowed from
the Nordic countries——during the next twenty—five years
that preceded the Great War, the Slavic and Southern coun-
tries of Europe increased their immigration ﬂOw—-—ecOnom-
ically the industrial, agricultural and transportation and
mining development of the nation moved in continuing
dependence upon an immigrant stream of willing laborers.

The 1920 census ﬁgures Of the United States show that
today 46.3% of the foreign-born population came from
these countries of the South and East.

The foreign—born workers, coming from these countries,
differed greatly from‘the ﬁrst group. Largely peasants from
agricultural countries, they knew little or nothing of modern
industrial methods or machinery. Cut off by differences
in language, in customs, religion, they more easily became
a prey to the employing class, today the most exploited and
oppressed section of the American working class.

THE RECENT IMMIGRATION

During the World War, the stream of foreign-born
ﬂowed back from the industries of America to the battle
ﬁelds of Europe.

In 1920-21, however, 668,000 immigrants landed in the
United States. Fearful of an invasion of the politically un-
orthodox, Congress, as the expression of a panic-stricken
capitalist class, passed the so-called Three Percent Restric-
tion Act. Since then approximately 356,995 foreign-born
have been admissible.

This number has been divided according to the
law, among the diﬁerent countries on the basis of 3% of
the number of each race present in the United States, ac-
cording to the 1910 census. During this last period of im-
migration no changes have taken place in the composition
of the working class.

From every corner of the earth they have come, strong,
sturdy people, eager to realize liberty and happiness in the
promised land. They have come, hoping for a new and bet-
ter life, in which the misery and suffering of the past will
be ended. Instead they ﬁnd that in the United States they
are the despised burden bearers, who, performing the hard-
est and most unpleasant work, are condemned to live in
squalor and poverty while they create wealth for the class
they serve.
