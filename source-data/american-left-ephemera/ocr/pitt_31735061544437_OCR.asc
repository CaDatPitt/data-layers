WASHINGTON
cm’

The past few months have seen an amazingincrease instudent activity for
peace. During this period, however, we have also seen the resumption of
nuclear testing by the Soviet Union and then by the United States, the
crisis over Berlin, 100 megaton bomb rattling--one crisis after another.

   

Clearly we must increase our action for peace and make it more effective
than it has ever been. For these reasons theestudent Peace Union, in co-
operation with Tocsin (Harvard) and several otherorganizations,is call-
ing for students to converge on Washington on February 16 and 17 to dem-
onstrate before U.S. Government offices and the Soviet Embassy to make
clear their demand for an end to nuclear testing, an end to fraudulent
civil defense, and a beginning of concrete initiatives for peace. There
will also be opportunities for groups and individuals to visit congress-
men, Senators, and other Government officials in order to discuss with
them alternatives to the arms race. This project is part of Turn Toward
Peace, a nationwide effort to arouse new interest in peace.

To support the thousands of students expected to participate in the pro-
test in Washington, we urge all those who cannot go to stage a sympathy
protest on their own campuses. This is our chance to make ourselves a
political force which cannot be ignored.
