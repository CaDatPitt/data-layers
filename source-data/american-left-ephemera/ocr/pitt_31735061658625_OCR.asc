“It's rather evident most of the big
dailies, on their editorial pages, were
out of step with the masses of the peo-
ple. ’ ‘ '

A “Publishing a big newspaper is BIG
BUSINESS, and BIG BUSINESS is con-3.
servative.”

This is what Lloyd Gregory, Managing
Editor of the Houston Post, had to ad-
mit in one of his recent columns.

An examination of the daily newspa-
pers of Texas will prove conclusively
that they do not speak out for the in-
terests of the people of our state. They
are advocates only of the program of
a tiny minority of the people, who" are
constantly fighting progress in the
state.

The daily newspapers of Texas are
out of tune with the aspirations, de-
sires and hopes of the people of our
state.

For a long time Texas has needed a
journal which would speak upon the
basic problems of the day; give an-
swers to the vexing questions facing our
people ‘ daily in this critical period of
world history, and expose the enemies
of the people.

In the short period of its existence,
TEXAS -SURVEY has made a begin-
ning i11 the direction of filling the
need.

TEXAS SURVEY exposed the . anti-
Roosevelt forces who tried to steal the
electoral vote of Texas last year.

TEXAS SURVEY focussed attention
on the fascist forcesin our state, such
as the. “Christian American” and the
“Committee :.for Constitutional Govern-

ment,' ’
