A GOOD IDEA FROMIMINNEAPOLIS

Here is an idea which was put into effect in the hﬁnneapolis Branch}

.The members in other Branches may take it for what it is worth.

 

The Hall in Minneapolis is located on‘a street where many people are
passing to and fro; It also has a large display window. Another
coincidence contributing to this idea was that we have a member in
our ranks who is an artist. We took advantage of his talent by having
him enlarge some of the most select cartoons which we thought were
appropriate to fit the present conditions. At present we have eight
cartoons in the window. It does one good to see the crowds that stop
and are showing interest in these cartoons.-These cartoons tell a
story in'Uhemselves. Anyone who'will not read our literature, has

the privilege of receiving an education on the class struggle and the
discrepancy which exists in society today by simply gazing into our
windows. -

The artist has agreed to enlarge more cartoons which will give us a
chance to make changes in o Window.. '

Of course, we also have on display our papers and pamphlets.

REGARDING LANGUAGE DIFTICULTIES

What difference does it make whether a man talks German, Hungarian or
Latin? It does not stop him from striking.

I would suggest that the editor of the GOB ignore all further arti-
cles on this subject as we have wasted too much ink and paper on it
already. What in the-~h--~'is t.-he‘, I".W.’W‘.. coming to? It is getting
nearly as bad as the.Comical Party or the A;F. of L. with all this
dissension coming from 94 — 5th Ave.

Yours for a.Real I;W£W. with no-ﬁissension,
‘ JJW.Carter, Xl2ll5l

AN EIGHT PAGE Il\TDUSTRI;AL wonm

Splendid cooperation in donations, increased bundle orders and arti-
cles was received for the hwy Day Industrial Workers-

By such means we can build the prestige of ou official organ and of
our organization. ’ '

At any time, even Without the donations, but with the same number of
bundle orders, we could more than break even on an eight page paper.

Why not cooperate, arranging each two months or so to have an eight
page paper and build bundle orders for the issue accordingly?

A,PROTEST.

Since I am not actively engaged in the organization work, or in other
words, still on a vacation, I am sort of hesitating to voice my views
on the organization affairs. However, I cannot refrain from voicing.
my objection to the majority GEB members‘ ruling re Guy B. Askew as
a.writer for the Industrial Worker. ' . 4

So long as an editor is at liberty to use the waste paper basket or

in other words, have authority to publish or not to publish articles _ ,i
submitted to him, I venture to say that I cannot~see any logical

reasons for the GEB to make such.ruling; unless, of course, they have

no confidence in their (hired hand) editor's intellectual ability

and in organizational honesty.-

On the strength of a.motion by a #110 business meeting requesting the
GEB to instruct the editor to re-write Askew's articles before pub~
1ication,.we were made to believe that it is what really motivated
the GEB tq adopt such a discriminating ruling. The GEB, I presume,
feel that it is their painful duty as General Supervisors over the
affairs of the organization, to adopt for its safety more effective"
protective measures. But, I wonder if that is the real motive. ’

G.R.U. e.o.c. CHAIRMAN MISUNDERSTANDS I.U. #640 CHARTER “

A notice appeared in the Industrial Worker of_a meeting being called.

at 94 - 5th Ave., NYC,fcr three weeks during the month of March,.in>

which all members of #460, #640 and #650 were asked to attend and .
build a functioning I.U. #640,Branch. Shortly after this meeting an ;
application for #640 charter'was made‘by the members of the #460 a

Branch and others coming under the jurisdiction of the new I.U. #640.

The signers of this application were told in answer that a #640 '

charter had already been issued a few days ago and asked if they want-

ed another #640 charter.~ — ‘

After investigating the issuance of the #640 charter, it was found
that the signers of the other charter application were the same mem~
bers who had consistently refused to function in the'#460 branch
which had been functioning for more than a year, although they were
supposed to function through this branch.

Six months ago the GEE Chairman informed the members of the #460
Branch that charter fee would not be necessary where #640 charters
replaced #460 charters. The GEB were aware of the fact that a #460
Branch was functioning in N.Y.C. and that the members at 2036 ~ 5th
Ave. belonged to it, yet the GEB issued a #640 charter to these same
members, in order that they Wouldn't have to join with other members
of N.Y.C. who were trying to build a union of hotel, restaurant and
cafeteria workers, and at the same time become an I.U. Branch. Wheth~
er the Finns at 2036 - 5th Ave. hare a #640 charter or a mixed branch
charter, does not change it into anything else. It still remains a
language branch; this time its called an I.U. Branch. Was it P01itiC5
or just plain every day beating around the bush?

Page #4 - General Organization Bulletin for hey 1956.

The G.O.C. Chairman of the G.R.U. is supposed to pass on all charter
applications in the G.R.U. but those who wished to have the Finns on
the safe_side did not take this into consideration. The G.R.U. G.E.Bo
member lives in Chicago, yet the charter was signed and sent out
without his knowing it. Why was this done?

ByéLaw 8A of the G;R.U. stands in force until it has been repealed by
the membership. This ByéLaw which stands for the building of I.U.
branches in the G.R.U} has been sabotaged by the members at 2036;» 5th
Ave. with the help of-officials in the Main Office from the day it
was carried. Are we to believe that the same people have changed~their
minds overnight and decided to build I.U. branches? Sounds like the
commies~and-John.L. Lewis‘ change of heart. ' .'v

.The G.O.C. of the G.R.U. protests the #640 charter in New Yerk City on-

the grounds that the members who signed the charter application have
violated By+Law 8A of the G.R.U. and every dembcratic principle of the
I.W.W., on the grounds that the G.O.C. Chairman_did not see the
charter application_and the highehanded manner in which it was issued.

(Note by General Secretary4Treasurer: There is nothing irregular about
the I.U. #640 charter issued to members of that I.U. in New-York
City. It is not issued to a group of Finnish fellow.workers, but to
any=and all members of I.U. #640 that see.fit to belong to the
Branch so chartered, At this time.there is every reason for I.U. #640
in New York city, to go ahead. Fred W.Thompson, Gena Sec'y.-Troas.)

V WHAT TO to WITH THE W.P.A.

(Editor's note: Ehis was received in time for the last Bulletin, but
was mislaid in correspondence files. F.W.T.) ‘ '

I would like information on the following questions:

1. Have the W.P.A. workers any economic power, being relief workers?
2. If so, have they the power to put the government out of business
by using direct action, the same as is used on an individual owner
of industry? I it ‘~ ' I to   ‘ » ~i

3. In-the district where the writer happens to be, there is in the

,.gs

 

 

neighborhood of fifty~foum different projects; by striking on one .1

project for shorter hours and higher wages, can we win?

4. On W.P.A. checks it says on them.WFor Relief Purpose only".-

5. On these projects here there would be about six Industrial Unions
represented according to our chart; Ehese workers are continually
being shifted from.place to place: the wages are the same on all
these projects. % ~ -* “3'

How am I to mo about organizing them into Industrial Unipns when it
really calls forﬁmass union-and mass action on district? How can these.
workers be industrial workers when.they have retreated a couple of
hundred years or so in using tools of the middle.ages for destruction f
or construction? “ ‘~ « '“ "*- ‘. ' . , 5

I have been thinking that maybe there are other'members of the_I.W.W.
who are also thinking of what to do.‘ We boast that we are capable of

meeting all opposition with scientific organization. I have a L.
suggestion along the following line:

That workers on relief projects he organized into the I.W;W. as members

at largegwhen they leave the relief projects and enter private indus~y'f,

try, that is if they are unlucky, then transfer them.to the rightful
I_U, _‘ : ﬂ_ , 4 . . . A >v;,

I would like constructive criticism, better‘suggestions than I have.
The workers myst be organized and educated to be ready to give their
best to the new classless society. , _ _p. p . - V» - J
