“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

BILLIONS OF MOLECULES . . .

In body physiology, a mucous membrane is com-
paratively gross, and would present an impenetrable
barrier to gaseous molecules. The membrane lining
each alveolus isbut a single cell in thickness, a mem-
brane so delicate that molecules of oxygen and car-
bon dioxide are able to ﬂow ceaselessly back and
forth. Across this delicate barrier is the blood of
the pulmonary capillaries." Every —minute 5 to 6
quarts of blood course through these capillaries.

In the respiratory process it is of the essence that
the gases involved, oxygen and carbon dioxide, be
separated by an intact but semi—permeable mem-
brane. Itiis here that gas exchange takes place, oxy-
gen going into the blood, and carbon dioxide leav-
ing it.

In order to function, the alveolar spaces must be
kept relatively dry. Water seeping into the alveo-
lar spaces fromithe body ﬂuids, as it may do in cer-
tain disease conditions, is removed by .lymph ves-
sels. If irritating substances are allowed to injure
the delicate membrane separating the alveolar spaces
from the blood of the body, then body ﬂuids seep
into the spaces. Effective gas exchange is no longer
possible.

. . . AND THEY KNOW_
WHICH WAY TO G0!

The passage of oxygen from the alveolar spaces in-
to the blood follows the laws of physical diffusion.
A plentitude of oxygen molecules in the alveoli lies
in close proximity to blood with a far lesser supply.
Diffusion of oxygen into the region of lesser pres-
sure is rapid.

Once the molecules of oxygen are made available
to the blood, having diffused through the alveolar
membrane, they must have a convoy to get them
to the cells of allbody tissues. This is provided by
one of the blood constituents, hemoglobin, an enor-
mous molecule carrying as one of its components
the red coloring matter of the blood. It is part of the
design of respiration that the linkage between the
oxygen molecule and hemoglobin be unstable and"
impermanent. The chemical union of these two must
be so lax that less than a second need transpire for
the hemoglobin to give ups its charge of oxygen.

REALLY FASCINATING

The actual manner in which the oxyhemoglobin
molecule is induced to give up its oxygen involves
a fascinating study of both chemistry and physics.
The greater the oxygen deprivation in the tissues, the

greater will be the concentration of carbon dioxide
molecules, and the presence of carbon dioxide mole-
cules acts to inﬂuence the hemoglobin to yield its
oxygen — all this with .mathematical exactitude.
Then the hemoglobin, freed of its oxygen, is able
to ferry back the carbon dioxide molecules, which
have come into being in the tissues as the product
of cellular oxidation.

NO SUBSTITUTE FOR OXYGEN

Despite the enormous complexity of human res-
piration, there yet remain some simple facts. We
must have oxygen in order to live. The only surface
our body has to take in oxygen consists of the fra-
gile tissue within our lungs, separated by a mem-
brane only a single cell in thickness, from our body
blood. Destruction of this alveolar membrane means
we no longer have the means of supplying our body
with oxygen. Impairing the ability of hemoglobin
likewise, in any way, to take oxygen to the tissues
is a matter just as_grave.

One’s hold upon life is only as tenuous as the
physical structure of this delicate tissue. No region
of the body lies so pulsatile, so exposed, as these
air cells of our lungs. The body integument, by com-
parison, is a ‘turtle’s carapace. Most of what we
ingest or expose ourselves to physically involves
conscious volition — except for the air. we breathe.
A person is able to hold‘ his breath a long time, but
not indeﬁnitely. lUnconsciousness supervenes, and
the respiratory center of the brain at once serves to
compensate by accelerating the breathing pace.

How POISON GASES}
KILL us

The air we breathe is a mixture of gases composed
approximately of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen.
Remove the oxygen from the air and any animal
will, within minutes, die of oxygen starvation. This
is called asphyxiation. The nitrogen at hand is no
offender. Yet an atmosphere deprived of oxygen
can surely “kill.” Certain poison gases do no harm
at all to lung tissue, yet they prevent the blood from
taking up oxygen. These are asphyxiant gases, of
which carbon monoxide is a leading example.

Nitrogen gas, which surrounds us, is inert. It en-
ters into no chemical combination with other sub‘-
stances. Within the lungs it serves merely to dilute
the oxygen. It would make little difference if the
nitrogen were replaced by helium, another inert

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS -ANGELES

gas. In fact, being lighter than nitrogen, it would
diffuse more readily into alveolar tissues. This pro-
perty is made use of in certain lung diseases where
the flow of air is impeded by mucus. Helium, being
seven times lighter than nitrogen, conveys the neces-
sary oxygen into the limited air spaces more easily.

CHLORIN E “MERELY IRRITATES”

Among poisonous gases there are those which kill
by reason of their irritating. action on the mucosaof
the respiratory tract. Chlorine gas is one of these.
It’s an “old-fashioned” poison gas, used in World
War, 1. Yet it still kills today just as effectively as
it did in 1915, the’ year it was ﬁrst used as a war
gas. Here’s chlorine in action, as described by Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle:

“From the base of the German trenches over a con-
siderable length there appeared jets of whitish va-
por, which gathered and swirled until they settled
into a definite low cloudbank, greenish-brown be-
low, and yellow above, where it reflected the rays
of the sinking sun. This ominous bank or vapor,
impelled by a northern breeze, drifted swiftly
across the space which separated the two lines.
The troops, staring over the top of their parapet
at this curious screen which ensured them a tem-
porary relief from fire, were observed suddenly to
throw up their hands, to clutch at their throats, and
to fall to the ground in the agonies of asphyxiation.
Many lay where they had fallen, while their com-
rades, absolutely helpless against this diabolical
agency, rushed madly out of the mephitic mist and
made for the rear . . . the dead -garrisons, whose
blackened faces, contorted figures, and lips fringed
with the blood and .foam from their bursting lungs, I
showed the agonies in which they died."

ACTION OF AN IRRITANT

The immediacyand violence of death from chlor-
ine gas is ‘caused by the fact that the gas is soluble
in water and at once reacts with the moist mucus
membrane of the throat. The ﬁrst symptom is cough-
ing; then choking occurs; the glottis becomes swol-
len and paralyzed so that the poison gas may not
even have a chance to invade the lung tissue. Vo-

miting of frothy -blood and mucus is quite charac-
teristic.

Even in the First World War, chlorine became
"old hat” as a poison gas. A far‘ more desirable ex-
terminator for humans was found in phosgene.
Phosgene is more subtle in its action, because it dis-
solves more slowly. One can breathe a goodly quan-
tity before even being aware of its irritant property.

PERFECT po1soN specs

The ideal to be attained in a gas designed to exter-
minate human populations would be to have it odor-
less, colorless, and invisible. It should be so poison-
ous that even one part in a million would kill. It
should not react with water. If it does, it will enter
into combination with the mucus membranes of the
nose and throat and- warn its victim. Ideally, _the
gas should have the opportunity to invade complete-
ly the lung tissue, for when it has done that, neither
mask, nor any remedial treatment is of any use.

Poisonous ‘gases being synthesized in laboratories
today have a high degree of speciﬁcity and reﬁne-
ment. Some are colorless, odorless, invisible, and may
have as their only effect the rendering of a popula-
tion completely lacking in will power for a number
of hours —» suiﬁcient time to cause capitulation to
an enemy. A

MARGIN OF SAFETY

In addition to the asphyxiant group, and the ir-
ritant group, there is another‘ category of poisonous
gases. Into this category belong those gases having
an effect upon the fatty substance surrounding the
nerve sheathe. Chloroform is one example. A mod-
erate dose produces anethesia; a greatly increased dose
depresses the respiratory center of the brain causing
death. Nearly all anesthetics and medicines have this
same feature: a certain speciﬁed dose has a pharma-
cologic action; a larger dose has a lethal action. The
region between the pharmacologic and the lethal dose

‘called the "margin of safety,” i_s, of course, extremely

important.

The concentration of poisonous gases is expressed
as parts per million by volume instead of in percent-
age ﬁgures. Some gases exert a toxic effect at only
1 part per million, sometimes less. Expressing this
concentration as a percentage, for example 0.0001%,
is cumbersome, hence the preference, for parts per
million, or p.p.m.

“SMOG” OVER LOS' ANGELES

HOW NITRIC OXIDE KILLS

Nitric oxide”, also called “nitrous fumes,” is a
dark reddish-brown gas considerably heavier than
air, so that its fumes are visible as vapor h-overing over
the ground. '

Another oxide of nitrogen is nitrous oxide (N20) ,
once known as "laughing gas,” and used by dentists
as a weak anesthetic. Except for the fact that both
can be called “oxides of nitrogen” there is no other
resemblance between them. Nitrous, oxide, when
used as an anesthetic, can kill you if sufficient oxy-
gen is not added to the anesthetic mixture; that’s
asphyxiation, however. 4

ALMOST GOOD AS PH OSGEN E

The action of nitric oxide isnoften compared to
phosgene, a gas once prepared and stored for use in
exterminating populations. Like phosgene, nitric
oxide dissolves unwillingly and slowly in water. It
is in this property that its insidious action lies. Per-
sons who have inhaled seemingly minute quantities
of this gas — oftentimes at an industrial plant —
have even Walked away from the scene, refusing
treatment, and claiming they "feel all right.” They’re
dead next day. I .

Although the gas is smelly, there is no reeky
stench, no mucous—piercing sensation which at once
would set the cough and vomiting reﬂexes into ac-

tion. This is what happens when even very small.

amounts of ammonia or chlorine are inhaled. (What
housewife does not move back in disgust as she
pours bleaching solution into her tubs?)

CAN’T COUGH ITUP EITHER

The action of nitric oxide is slow and protracted.
The gas has hardly any affect on the mucous mem-
branes of nose or throat and thus may invade the
alveolar tissues of the lungs. No body defense is
raised. The microscopic cilia whichwaft away par-
ticles of matter which ﬁnd their way intothe lungs
are effective only against ‘particles exceeding a size
of 5 microns. Such a particle is a veritable giant com-
pared to even the largest molecule.

Within the alveolar spaces, mingling freely with
the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, the gas
decomposes and casts molecules of nitrite upon, the
delicate membranes separating the lung tissue from
the blood of the capillaries. Nitrites deposited upon

* We refer tc No. (not NO) and realize correct chemical
designation is NITROGEN DIOXIDE.

this tissue act as a profound irritant. The body ﬂuids
seek to dissolve the substance, albeit with diﬂiculty
and slowly.. Plasm seeps frorri the capillaries to en.-
gulf the irritant; the membrane separating the air
of the lungs from the body blood is tornasunder.
Its ability to allow oxygen to diffuse into the blood
is lost. Moisture seeps into the alveolar tissues, far

too much forthe vessels of the lymphatic system to

ICITIOVC.

THIS IS PULMONARY EDEMA

The submergence of the alveolar tissues by the
body ﬂuids means that the victim” is drowning, just
as effectively as if he were submerged at the deep end
of the swimming pool.

This is not a pretty way to die. Clinically, the
condition is known as pulmonary edema. The clas-

sical picture of death from pulmonary edema is.
that of the patient sitting bolt upright in bed or

even hunched far forward with elbows resting on
his knees. The position is an aid in difficult breath-
ing. The countenance is one showing wild anguish
and terror — the instinct of the animal is to sur-
vive — as he ﬁghts and gasps for every breath. A
frothy pink discharge may cover nose and mouth,
and tokens the severe .damage within the lungs.
At this point, nothing can be done. The treatment
for pulmonary edema is commenced before‘ such
extreme symptoms make their appearance. Part of
this treatment is the introduction of oxygen under

‘ positive pressure. Less than positive pressure will re-

sult in greater suction with inspiration, a greater
tendency to tear away at the already weakened al-
veolar membranes.

Nitric‘ oxide kills because of its. action as an irri-
tant on lungs. Other gases of the irritant type are
sulfur dioxide, hydrogen ﬂuoride, ozone, and the
aldehydes; there are many others.

HOW CARBON
MONOXIDE KILLS

Anyone who owns a car, and who is bent on sui-
cide, has the means of self—destruction at hand. This
is common knowledge. Inhaling directly from the
exhaust pipe of an automobile, with motor run-
ning, can result in death within seconds. Automo-
bile exhast may‘contain 7% carbon monoxide, more
than, 50 times the lethal dose. ‘

Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, and for
these rea-sons it ‘kills many who are -not at all desir-

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

ous of departing this life. One of the insidious fea-
tures of carbon monoxide poisoning is that paraly-
sis and prostration can occur, while consciousness
remains_. A person who has collapsed from the ef-
fects of carbon monoxide poisoning may be acute-
ly aware of his peril, may want desperately to crawl
away, but he is unable to translate conscious desire
into the necessary muscular action.

Families have become asphyxiated when carbon
monoxide fumes have seeped through the ceiling of
a garage into living quarters above.

IT’S SO EASY.’

Like all gases, carbon monoxide diffuses. evenly
into the available area surrounding it. Given time —
it will. Every physical reaction takes a certain amount
of time. In the case of carbon monoxide molecules,
as light as the air we breathe, diffusion into the sur-
rounding space is quite rapid. That is why, with
thousands of automobiles spewing poisonous mix-

tures from their exhausts, we- are alive, instead of

littering the streets with our dead and comatose
bodies. _ —

Although the concentration issuing from an au-
tomobile exhaust is readily lethal, such prodigal use
is not at all necessary. One-hundredth this amount
may sufﬁce. Air with only 0.07% carbon monoxide
going into the lungs can result in 50% of the blood
becoming saturated with carbon monoxide. Such
a small amount!

OXYGEN CAN’T ,WIN

The affinity of hemoglobin for the oxygen mole-
cule is one of mere romantic dalliance. Hemoglobin
and carbon monoxide,_on the other hand, have an
attractive force over 200 times as great, a‘ veritable
death hold. Competing with carbon monoxide for
a hemoglobin convoy, oxygen doesn’t stand a chance.

Even» though present in such minute quantity in
the airy residuum of gases circulating within the
alvelor tissues, carbon monoxide wins every time.
The new molecule called carbonyl—hemoglobin rushes
with the blood to oxygen-depleted tissues. Nothing
happens. There is no release of carbon monoxide in
the tissues. It merely continues its hold on the he-
moglobin..

/become saturated with carbon monoxide, uncon-
sciousness results; death ensues when saturation in-
creases to 60% to 80%. Quite obviously, this con-
centration is not reached in Los Angeles, for how-
ever erratic may be the habits of the city’s drivers,
most of them do seem to remain‘conscious,.and get

.When 50% of the hemoglobin of the blood has‘

to their destinations alive. iHowever, less than lethal
concentrations produce physical symptoms. These
are headache, nausea, ringing in the ears, weakness,
irritability, sleepiness, etc. -

SUB-LETHAL A SYMPTOMS

The symptoms related to carbon monoxide poi-
soning can be quite misleading. It has happened
that patients sent to sanitaria for convalescence from
carbon monoxide poisoning have often been thought
to have schizophrenia or some other mental derange-
ment.

the brain cells are most dependent upon an immed-
iate supply of oxygen. And-in the brain, those cells
connected with the cerebral cortex, and "higher
centers,” have a metabolism in greatest demand for
oxygen. The metabolic pace is'7 times as great here
as in other parts of the body. Carbon monoxide poi-
soning, and the resulting anoxia, can cause, these

cells to deteriorate. Mental regression is a frequent

sequel to severe carbon monoxide poisoning. Any

gas which "can starve the brain of its oxygen can

cause a similar deterioration,

LET’S STEP BACK 50 FEET
TO MEASURE IT a e a

Carbon monoxide is one of 5 air poisons which,

when the concentration has reached a certain level,

can trigger an “alert.” For Carbon Monoxide. the
critical concentration is 100 parts per million or
0.01%. That density is the amount recorded at one
of the monitoring stations throughout the County,
none of which gets as close to heavy traffic as the
curbside. And certainly no monitoring station re-
presents the situation‘ existing within an automobile
or the cab of a truck. '

There have been attempts to link some of the
“crazy” accidents on freeways to the driver’s suf-
fering from a mild carbon monoxide poisoning.
There are little data on that subject,‘ however.

It would be helpful, also, to have experimental
work done on the concentrations of carbon monoxide
in the front seat of an automobile, especially in one
where there are faulty exhaust connections, leaks in
muﬂlers, and leaky piston rings. This is not an ‘ori-

ginal observation. Over 25 years ago safety engineers"

recommendedthat‘ cars be inspected regularly for
faults in the exhaust system.

“SERIOUS” IN 1926

How about the carbon monoxide concentrations
on downtown streets where traﬂic is heaviest? The

There is reason for this. Of all tissues in the body, _

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

concentration is deﬁnitely greater, despite the dif-
fusibility of the gas. And the concentration can
build up rapidly in the front seat'of an automobile
following close to another in heavy trafﬁc.

It would be helpful to have experiments which
would measure the amount of blood saturation with
carbon monoxide occuring in traﬂic policemen, fol-
lowing an 8-hour stint of duty. Nor is this an ori-
ginal idea. Studies made in Philadelphia policemen
showed that after an 8-hour traffic duty many had
carbon monoxide blood-saturation levels as high as
30%. This is not enough to cause unconsciousness,
but it’s enough to cause severe headache and — with
repeated exposures — to leave permanent damage.
This experiment was carried out in 1926. In 1926
a "busy” street would seem like a present-day haven.

"TH|S LOVELY
OZONE IN THE AIR''
-OZONE IN THE GOLDEN STATE

Ozone has become a familiar word to smog-racked
Southern Californians. Newspapers include data on
"ozone readings” for the previous day just as rou-
tinely as they refer to the downtown temperature.
We are getting as accustomed to the word “ozone”
as we are to "smog.” And that is unfortunate.

There’s a tonic ring to the name ozone. Poetic-
minded persons have been wont to refer to the brisk-
ness of clean mountain air as “ozone,” or the stimu-
lation of ocean breezes. This is not true. Ozone is
present in the normal atmosphere 0.035 parts per mil-

lion by volume, whether at the seaside or atop a

mountain.

An ozone concentration of 0.5 parts per million
in the Los Angeles area is sufficient to cause a First
Alert. That is about ﬁfteen times the ozone occur-
ring free in nature. Even this seems to be a triﬂing
amount to make such a fuss about.

“WHAT’S OZONE ANYHOW?”

Just what is this substance called ozone? For a
deﬁnition I telephoned a member of the “medical
scientiﬁc” committee of the Air Pollution Control
District of Los Angeles County. He was a physician.

"Ozone? Well, you could say it’s a gas, rather like
oxygen. Oxygen is a molecule composed of two
atoms of oxygen, while ozone is a molecule having
three atoms of oxygen.”

Yes, the answer is correct. Beautifully correct.

And certainly anything “like oxygen” — without
which we couldn’t live — is nothing to worry about.

The answer is just as correctlas deﬁning chlorine
gas in terms of table salt, which is sodium chloride,
we use every day. As a matter of fact, most of the
chlorine gas used in the United States is obtained by
electrolysis from sodium chloride. Merely removing
an electron apiece from two chloride ions (the stuff
in table salt, remember) will produce a molecule of
chlorine gas. But everyone knows that chlorine gas is
no good at all as a seasoner!

IT MIGHT CRACK RUBBER . . .

Any deﬁnition of ozone should mention the fact
that it is an extremely reactive gas. It attacks most
metals except gold and platinum. The householder
in Southern California should not be dismayed at
the rate at which metal ﬁxtures, jewelry, and or-
naments acquire a black-brown tarnish. It is due
to oxidants like ozone, and also to the sulfur com-
pounds in the air. The only substance more reactive
than ozone is pure ﬂourine gas which is used to etch
glass and metal. It would be well to reﬂect on what
a gas, almost strong enough to etch glass, can do to
sensitive lung tissue. '

It is a source of great concern to tire manufac-
turers that stores of rubber tires should crack and
deteriorate in the Southern California “air.” This
is a source of concern, too, to the Air Pollution Con-
trol District, which lists it as an “economic nui-
sance.” The standard test for ozone is noting the
time it takes for a moderately stretched rubber band
to crack.

. . . BUT IT CAN’T HURT US

It is really baffling that there are so few people who
ever consider what effect “air” which can crack rub-
ber and corrode metal may have on their lungs, the
most sensitive and the most vulnerable tissue in the
body. Unlike a rubber tire, the human lung cannot
be patched or replaced.

How much of this ozone can we stand? Well,
there’s an organization composed of industrial phy-
sicians called the American Conference of Govern-
mental’ Industrial Hygienists which establishes
threshold levels (called maximum allowable concen-
trations, or M.A.C.’s) for noxious substances to
which workers may be exposed. A

When these M.A.C.’s are established, it is assumed
that the worker is on an 8-hour shift; that the con-
taminant is the only one to which the worker is
exposed. This makes a difference. Minute amounts of
some «gases or vapors which, if absorbed or inhaled

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

alone, would cause little or no untoward effect, when
inhaled with another toxic material have a greatly en-
hanced effect, far greater than merely “adding” the
separate effects of the two substances. This is called
synergism.

IT’S DIFFERENT IF YOU’RE
PAID TO BREATHE IT

‘This conference of industrial hygienists. set a
threshold level of 0.1 parts per million for ozone,
for an 8-hour day, assuming that no other contam-
inants are in the atmosphere. Some members of the
group even insisted that this level was too high.

Why such extreme caution? A‘worker employed
in industry has the legal right to collect insurance
beneﬁts or sue for damages if he is sickened by poi-
sonous substances encountered in his work. .

Californians, especially the southern breed, like to
think of themselves as among the very healthiest and
hardiest. Yet one becomes curious as to just how it
came about that ﬁve times the exposure considered
maximum for a worker in industry (assuming no
other contaminants are around) must be reached in
the Los Angeles area before a First Alert is sounded.
The effect of a First Alert is mere legal notiﬁcation.
Ten times the maximum allowable concentration per-
mitted in industry must be reached, or 1.0 parts per
million, before a Second Alert is sounded. Only
then is an attempt to be made to stem the polluting
sources.

GUINEA PIGS DIE OF IT

Tracking down data in the medical tomes, one can
find some interesting experiments on the exposure
of laboratory animals to ozone. Here are some of
the data:

When guinea pigs breathe air containing
0.002% ozone, or 20 parts per million, they
die off in a few hours,

At a concentration of 0.2 parts per million,
which the human population of Los Angeles
County has been conditioned into thinking is
insigniﬁcant, it takes a lot longer to kill the
guinea pigs, all of" seven months to abserve that
the death rate is much greater for those in the
0.2 ppm ozone group than in the contral
group, while the ozone-denied are frisky as
ever.

In experiments where the concentration was
raised to 0.5 parts per million ozone, the death
rate began to be appreciably greater, — and
sooner. After only 14 weeks the death rate of
the ozone-exposed was noticeably greater.

One experiment involved three groups: (1) The
usual control group breathing pure air; (2) A group
of guinea pigs breathing ozone concentration as low
as 0.1, ppm; and (3) Guinea pigs infected with tu-
berculosis germs and also kept in an atmosphere of
0.1 ppm ozone. The tubercular animals, who were
also breathing 0.1 ppm ozone in their air, died much
faster than either of the other two groups, but they
were followed soon enough by the ozone-exposed.

"Thus it may be reasonably concluded that ozone
is lethal or predisposing to death of guinea pigs in
continuous exposure at concentrations as low as
0.1 ppm; higher concentrations up to 0.5 ppm
produced mortality more rapidly.”"‘

Rx ozoma. FOR ANGELS, I
AD LIBITUM

It was the feeling of a renowned medical investi-
gator, Dr. C. A. Mills of Cincinnati, that 0.2 ppm
should be the uppermost limit for ozone concentra-
tion in the area. Dr. Mills is not very popular with
the “medical scientiﬁc” experts who set threshold
values at bargain rates for Southern Californians.

"Ozone toxicity manifests itself in animals and
people primarilyby irritation and swelling in the
cells lining the air passages. Such swelling in the
smallest air passages next to the lung’s air sacs in-
terferes seriously with their proper ventilation and
is the direct cause of death. Other toxic materials
such as sulfuric acid mists or the oxides of nitro-
gen may act similarly in the air passages.”1‘ I

Ozone harmful? Of course not. Just ignore the
scientiﬁc data on the subject already at hand_. Other-
wise deprecate the experimenter.’s ﬁndings severely,
and ridicule .the man himself. Give an investigator
with a more congenial point of view a grant of mo-
ney to carry on "research” a little more palatable.
Give his data to your public relations people to "pro-
cess for public consumption.”

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

HOW "SMOG" KILLS

"Smog” kills. A most formidable array is lined
up to say otherwise: apologists for industry; the
A.P.C.D. and its “medical scientiﬁc” consultants;
the State Department of Public Health; the federal
health services; and glad—to-cooperate medical soc-
ieties. '

Regrettably, “smog” kills slowly. If cause and
effect were dramatically linked, we would not have
millions of persons facing such insult with passivity,

A coroner's deputy, called to the scene of acci-
dental death from a poison gas like carbon monox-
ide, ﬁnds a familiar scene. The room where the vic-
tim was found had been closed in with a heater
going full blast. There is a rosy hue to the vic-
tim’s skin. It’s carbon monoxide death for certain.
Yet there must be medical conﬁrmation. Chemical
analysis of the blood reveals a concentration of 60
to 80 per—cent carbonyl-hemoglobin. Such is sim-
ple, uncomplicated death due to a poison gas. No
one would dare say, “You can’t prove it!”

TO A “CLOSED ROOM,” ADD

The line of proof establishing “smoggy” death is
a little tenuous. The “closed room” is represented
by a. condition known as temperature inversion,
cooler air held to the ground by a warm air mass
overhead. —

Poison gases, the constituents of "smog,” which
a few days before had dispersed readily into_ the
atmosphere, are now held in. What was one day just
a minimal concentration of sulfur dioxide or nitric
oxide.is now building up to signiﬁcant proportions.

Any poison in the air at all is a challenge to the
human constitution. Taking sulfur dioxide as an
example, it is possible to smell the gas when the
concentration is 3 p.p.m., to have subjective symp-
toms of discomfort when the concentration has
reached 8 p.p.m. When experiments have been un-

dertaken, however, to test the eifects of the gas in,

concentrations so small the subject didn’t know
he was in an atmosphere containing the gas, never-
theless changes were noted in blood pressure, heart
rate, and breathing pattern.

“INSIGNIFICANT”

These "insigniﬁc'ant” concentrations of poisons
are building up slowly, and present a hurdle which
the weaker members of the population are not
able to surmount.

The ritual of “smoggy” death would seem to re-

quire at least four or ﬁve days. That was the pat-
tern observed in the deathly‘ debacles of Donora,
London, and Belgium’s Meuse Valley. There was the
combination of air stagnation, the slow building
up of concentrations of poisonous gases “smog”
from industrial wastes.

There was, in addition, a cold, ﬁne mist which
played a part in these tragedies. Minute droplets
of such a fog act as attractive particles for the mole-
cules of sulfur dioxide in the air. It is now a sul-
furic acid mist with greatly augmented ability to
damage the respiratory tract and lungs.

AND LET STAND AWHILE

The weakest become sick the very ﬁrst day. These
include the very old, for old age increases that con-
dition called chronic emphysema. Also, among the
immediate sufferers are those with lung diseases,
for poisons put too much demand upon the right
heart. And —— so many omit to mention — the
very young are among the ﬁrst victims, for they
as yet are unable to effect the coordination neces-
sary to cough, to clear the throat, and to raise mu-
cus from airways. An aspirator can do it — if
there’s time.

Among those who sicken the ﬁrst day are can-
didates for death from cardiorespiratory illness the

I the second, third and fourth» days, death ensues fol-

lowing a quatrain of days’ suffering. Succeeding
days ﬁnd even healthy members of the population
succumbing to such illnesses as headache, chok-
ing, nausea, coughing attacks, spitting up blood.

DEATH IN A SMALL TOWN

In a small community of 13,000 like Donora
the fourth day presented a dramatic and terrible
picture. Twenty deaths had occurred and 6000 were
sick at home or in hospitals. In such a small com-
munity the cause is at once apparent and traceable
to the steel works, the‘.zinc smelters, and the sul-
furic acid plant, which had been jetting indus-
trial wastes in the form of poisonous gases into the
air of Donora for years. On this occasion, ‘however,
the poisons and climatic conditions were in con-
junction. —

The cause of these deaths and illnesses at Donora
was due to the reaction of “merely irritant””' gases
on the‘respiratory tract ‘and within the lung tis-

irritates living tissue” ——— MALCOLM H. MERRILL,
Director, Calif. State Dept. of Public Health.

sue. Such gases as sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid mist,
nitrogen dioxide, ozone are among many capableof
producing such an effect. Death is usually brought
about by pulmonary edema or heart failure, as a
result of the action of the poisons on lung tissue.

Let’s just explore some “if’s” in a case like that
of Donora.

If there had been strong breezes blowing across
the valley, there would probably have been no
deathly episode.

I f that ﬁne cold mist had not been present in the
air, the death rate might have been slight, and the
number of illnesses so reduced, the community
would have been unaware that any excess deaths
were occuring

On the other hand, if there had been both the
air stagnation and also the ﬁne cold mist, WITH-
OUT THE POISONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE,
NO DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN ATTRI-
BUTED TO “SMOG.” The fall climate of Penn-
sylvania is not lethal.

WAN TED: AN E TIOLOGIC AGENT

Those who dedicate themselves to diversionary
tactics in order to vindicate “smog” as a killer, en-
gage in a preciosity which isobscene. Here’s a sam-
ple from a “scientist” retained to give expert testi-
mony for the defendants in suits brought against
the steel and zinc plants by the Donora victims:

“The etiologic agent or agents in the Donora
episode have not been identiﬁed with any con-
vincing proofs on even arguments. There was
no unusual activity or unusual fuel consump-
tion by the steel mills,_ by the railroads, or by
the residents. The fuel usedwas the same as they
had been using, soft coal with about 3/; per-
cent S (sulfur), some natural gas, and consid-
erable fuel oil. Automotive traffic is not es-
pecially heavy in this area. It was generally
agreed that the causative agent was no one sub-
stance but a combination that could be kept
within safe limits by practicable measures.”1'

This is how a B.S., Chem.E., D.Ss., LL.D. says,
“You can’t prove it!”

SLOW DEATH FROM SMOG

Let no one have a vaunted sense of superiority
that "smog” as killer selects only those already fee-
ble. No one is quite the same again who survives
a seige of “smog.” The injury may not be dis-
cernible, but it’s there. And it leaves candidates

for the next onslaught of the Grim Reaper. (The
cliche was never so appropriate).

If "smog” could only be thought of in terms of
numbers dead, it would have little signiﬁcance. As
prescient beings, we live with an awareness of death.
"Might as well go ‘one way as another,” is the cheery
remark. The death toll from “smog” would be a
triﬂe compared with that from accidents in the
home, and far less than deaths caused by automo-
tive accidents. ~

Slow death from “smog” renders us a little less
than human, and debases the work of the Creator’s
fashioning. The most sordid account of death from
lung cancer is not so repugnant as this robbing of
the substance of living beings.

MANY ARE CHOSEN

“Smog” kills by providing an intolerable burden
of poisons upon those unable to meet the strain.
Those individuals with chronic bronchitis, asthma,
heart disease, emphysema are usually the ones who
die first in a “smoggy” episode.

On the other hand, “smog” itself induces such
chronic diseases, and puts an undue strain upon
the heart. It makes no sense -— if one would be an
apologist for “smog” — to mention that the vic-
tims already were chronically ill. For “smog” it-
self has placed them in that echelon. Death from
“smog” is on the instalment plan.

When some future disaster occurs in Los Angeles,
shall we (the dead) hear some apologist, perhaps
an expert medical witness retained to give a clean
slate to those criminally responsible, say indulgent-
ly that the poor wretches who died were already
chronically ill? Hadn’t they lived in Los Angeles
10 to 15 years?

THE PHYSIOLOGY
OF IT FIGURES

Some physiological details may be mentioned.

Persons with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema
have difﬁculty breathing. One can observe the
strain imposed on such individuals at times by ob-
serving the nostrils dilate at the ‘stress of inhal-
ing air, even while in a sitting posture. Exhaling
air, too, can be diﬂicult. Swelling of the bronchial
tubes and the accumulation of mucus within the
lungs impede the ﬂowing out of air.

1 PROF. PHILIP DRINKER, before the Royal Institute
of Public Health. (London, Eng), July, 1957

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

This trapped-in-air which cannot be expelled
causes increased air pressure within the alveolar tis-
sues. The alveoli become distended, and lose their
quality of resilience. This condition exists in pul-
monary emphysema. Tissue within the lungs be-
comes thickened and results in what is known as
pulmonary ﬁbrosis.

HEART STRAIN INDUCED

A greater pressure within the lungs, when air
cannot escape, causes the arterioles and capillaries
in the pulmonary bed to become constricted. Whe-
ther t-he lung tissue is destroyed, or the capillaries
are greatly constricted, the resulting mischief is that
blood going into the lungs has found insuﬁicient
surface exposed for taking in oxygen.

Insuﬂiciently aerated, the blood from the lungs

proceeds to the right ventricle of the heart ——- want-
ing in oxygen. Anoxemia is the result. We ﬁnd
ourselves “short of breath.” The symptom is call-
Qd dysnea.
‘ When resistance in blood ﬂow has been imposed
by constricted vessels in the lung, an undue strain
is placed upon the right ventricle of the heart,
which receives the pulmonary blood. "Right heart
failure” occurs, when the strain is too much.

THE .PROFESSOR, “SMOG”, AND
MORALITY

Slow" death from “smog” involves us in moral
issues. They are inescapable:

The Professor retained by the zinc smelters and
sulfuric acid plants of Donora to protect them
[against those who would sue for the damages
wrought, emphasized that those who died at Don-
ora, as in London, had previously had asthma, heart
disease, or lung disease. What he did not mention
was that the conditions which had been allowed
to exist at Donora had themselves initiated the lung
conditions which enfeebled them. It’s a circular re-
lationship.

“In prolonging life expectancy, we have a large
reservoir of people who have no margin of safe-
ty; with the steady ‘strain such as the atmosphere
(sic) at Donora provided, they become sick and
die.”

The apologist for poisons sounds very convin-
cing. Those hardy Pennsylvania folk sickened and
died because, as humans, they found the slow cu-
mulative effects of poisons in their systems too much
to tolerate. An Olympic runner, exposed for as long
to such conditions, would be able to muster no more
resistance.

A MILD WAY TO DIE

And here we expatiate. Be most attentive, please,
to the following quotation:

“I suppose the toxicology of this fog is best
likened to that from a mild gas attack [des-
cription of London disaster] —— mild because
it so obviously singled out the ageing, the car-
diac, and the asthmatic. The young and the
healthy were not PARTICULARLY bothered in
London, Donora, or Meuse Valley. .. .

“The fact that the young and healthy went
through these episodes (and through Meuse Val-
ley’s) indicates that complete freedom from the
pollutants is not essential. . . ”

(Italics supplied)

Let’s just face up to this thing now. In Profes-
sor Drinker’s writing there occurs and recurs phrases
like those emphasized above, “the young and the
healthy were not much bothered. . .”

SURVIVAL or THE YOUNG
AND HEALTHY?

Yes, we’ll take on the professor, despite the
B.S., Chem. B, D.Sc., and LL.D., which tag after
his name. What Professor Drinker has omitted
to say is that the young and healthy members
of the population, whether at London, Donora, or
Meuse Valley, were not visibly affected, did not
seem to be bothered.

The young and healthy of Donora in 1948 are
today not so young, understandably. They are far
from healthy. Those men who survived the Donora
trouble have had a death rate more than twice as
high as that of their counterparts in the population.

THIS INCREASED MORTALITY WAS DE-
TERMINABLE WITHIN A YEAR FOLLOW-

ING the Donora Disaster. The “public health ex-~

pert” who —- for a price — will rescue poison-pro-
ducing industries, knew that when he wrote (in
1957) that the “young and healthy were not bo-
thered much,” and then ‘suggested that "complete
freedom from pollutants may not be essential.”

RESEARCH — EX POST FACTO

Were it not for the public relations campaigns,
which are adroitly handled, surely one of the most
stupefying aspects of “smog” and health would be
the delayed reaction occurring between the research
ﬁndings and appropriate action upon them.

The response time for the torpid body known as

.- « -p1v-.:s:9ua-euaeun-«apﬁsc

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

 

the United States Public Health Service seems ‘to be
approximately 10 years. A curious chain of events
occurs: Research . . . oﬂicials “express concern” . . .
research is questioned . . .. collateral projects are un-
dertaken . . . Result: zero.

The funny fugue takes place only. in the ﬁeld
of air poisons. (Perhaps also in the ﬁeld of tobacco
and health.) The personnel of the U.S. Public Health
Service, and state health departments show heroic
zeal when it comes to warning the public of the
dangers presented by some Haitian dolls imported
here, and warns the public of Asian ﬂu and pre-
cautions to be taken if one catches it.

In 1948, the year of, the Donora episode, research
as to the ill effects of air poisons was THEN AL-
READY YEARS OLD; and that research was reli-
able. Ten years later results of a long-term study
sponsored by the ‘U.S. Public Health Service at the
University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health were revealed at the 86th annual meet-
ing of the American Public Health Association.

Within a year following the initiation of the re-
search (in 1948), the price paid by those who sur-
vived at Donora was apparent. Yet a long-term re-
port does help in permitting easily—affrighted ofﬁ-
cialdom to postpone action. Reports, — and time-
consuming research.

The Pittsburgh report’s ﬁndings in brief:

1. For the period since the smog, the death rate
among men in the affected group in Donora is more
than twice that of non-affected males.

2. The difference in th-e mortality of the two
groups showed up within one year after the 1948
smog, and increased steadily until 195 4, when it ap-
parently stabilized.

3. The survivors among the affected citizens of
Donora show a higher frequency of current illness
and symptoms and also a higher prevalence of chron-
ic illness. These differences are reﬂected even in
the group under 20 years in 1948.

4. The relationship of particular contaminants in
the Donora air to speciﬁc symptoms could not be
pinned down.

5. The smog, in essence, also brought out or ac--
centuated previous disease.

a trout in the milk." — TI-IOREAU.

"But the report left unan-
swered the question of whe-
ther the poison fog that blank-
eted Donora for ﬁve days start-
ing October 27, 1948, was
linked to subsequent deaths and
impairment of health.

“Dr. Antonio Ciocco, head
of the biostatistics department,
said that data collected so far
proved only that smog made

sick people sicker.”
From an AP news story.

Did the U.S. Public Health Service wait for ten
years to “break” this news? Why?

When our public health oﬂicials catch some ro-
dents with Rocky Mountain Spotted fever, do they
conduct a 10-year study on the effects of the dis-
ease, before they take even mild emergency mea-
sures or warn people through radio and press of the
hazard?

Why this ducking of the head into the statistics
tables, when the problem is so immeasurably greater
and more signiﬁcant? Is it because the nature of
the adversary strikes fear into the hearts of too many
who are very fond of their jobs in the United States
Public Health Service?

These words are not written heedlessly: We speak
now and then of “foreign agents” in our midst, of
the ease with which a saboteur might go about his
task. We should not fret. We are effecting our own
ruin most ably. An enemy should be well pleased.

The breath of life is becoming a poisoned breath.
Our cities are becoming regions where entire pop-
ulations are becoming debilitated and dispirited.
When human vigor is sapped, the progress to moral
and spiritual conquest is easy.

Some of the most ingenious minds in the ﬁeld
of organic chemistry have been trying to synthe-
size a gas which would produce indifference on the
part of human populations to their conquest. Let
the chemists examine the constituents of our own
atmosphere in Los Angeles! Then match it with
the numbing unconcern on the part of the popula-
tion toward their own violation, the jocularity and
euphoria that become part of front page newspa-
per stories during the “smog season.” A tactical
victory has already been achieved — but we are
not the victors.

 

“SMOG” OVER, LOS ANGELES

A WHEN IT ISN'T THE POISONS.
.|T'S THE PARTICLES . . .

Take a small rock lying on the ground. It’s harm-
less. Pick it up and throw it at someone, it’s dan-
gerous. Used in a slingshot, more so. The bigger
this rock, the more capable of injury.

In body physiology the smaller the “rock” the
more dangerous it is. If the" rock is crushed, the big
pieces plummet to the ground, sure as Newton’s
apple. Very small particles drift to the ground.
Extremely minute particles remain suspended in the
air. Although a billion times larger than molecules
composing air, their course earthwards is affected by
the motion of the air molecules, constantly bashing
each other about.

Size is important. These minute particles are
measured in terms of microns. Now, if you mark off
a meter stick (which is approximately 39" long)
into a thousand divisions, you have units of length
called millimeters. Taking a millimeter and dividing
it into one thousand divisions, you have the unit of
length called a micron.

IT’S THE SIZE THAT COUNTS

The smaller the particles the more likely they are
to remain suspended in air and enter the air passages.
Particles submicronic in size are inhaled. But they’re
so small they are apt to be exhaled, too. In most
cases, the critical size for particles ranges from 1 to 5
microns. Such particles have the greatest chance of
being retained by lung tissue..

Most of the time we inhale dust particles with im-
pugnity. Autopsies on human lungs reveal the city
dweller, for the soot of the city is deposited along the
lymphatics of his lungs. In a coal mining district
iron dust may be inhaled and deposited on the lung
surfaces, seemingly without ill effect.

Inhaled particles undergo diverse fates:
(1) Become harmlessly deposited in the lungs.

(2) Cause, by chemical reaction or mechanical
action, a condition known as pulmonary fibrosis.

(3) Act as a chemical irritant, as in the case of
the fluoriides, alkalies, sulfuric acid, etc.

(4)' Became absorbed by the blood stream like lead
or arsenic vapors.

(5) Cause mechanical irritation of mucous mem-
brane, resulting in allergic reactions.

FATE OF PARTICLES

\ .

Some particles may be absorbed by the blood
stream and exert a systemic action. In lung diseases
drugs are often introduced intratracheally as aero-
sols, in order that their action may have an effect on
lung tissue and be taken in by the body circulation as
well. Antibiotics are absorbed thus. But also certain
poisonous metals like lead and arsenic, when inhaled
as a dust, are absorbed by the bloodstream, through
the lungs, and have the same effect as if swallowed——
but more so. (The intestinal tract offers much great-
er resistance to the absorption of such particles as
lead than do the airsacs of the lungs.)

An entire group of lung diseases, called the pneu-
moconioses, results from inhalation of dust par-
ticles. Of these diseases, silicosis is one of the most
well known.

SILICOSIS

Persons may be exposed to silica dust (usually in
their work) for over 5 years without having symp-
toms. Silica particles less than 5 microns in diamet-
er are most dangerous.

These silica particles cause a physico-chemical re-
action. ‘The tissue surrounding the particles be-
comes thickened, and eventally develops into fibrous
nodules. These nodules may become so large that
they merge into each other. The effect of this is to
deprive lung tissue of its function.

Since portions of alveolar tissue are destroyed,
other alevoili have a greater load, they become dis-
tended, and gradually lose their elasticicity; a con-
dition known as emphysema may result.

When this is the case, the victim of silicosis has
trouble breathing; he tires more easily; and shows a
lessened capacity for work.

Silicosis is not often the cause of death. Generally
a disease like bronchopneumonia or tuberculosis su-
pervenes. However, when silicosis proceeds to death,
it is because so much of the lung tissue has become
ﬁbrotic, that the blood enters the right ventricle with-
out sufficient oxygen; the right ventricle becomes
strained and enlarged, and right heart failure results.

The significance of silicosis is that it develops very
slowly over the years. Shortness of breath may be
the only symptom.

Other symptoms are chronic fatigue, insomnia, loss
of appetite, pain in the chest, hoarseness.

Silicosis is not a leading health hazard in the Los
Angeles area. Therefore it would seem of little pur-
pose to go into some of its clinical details and pathol-

ogy. However, those exposed to silica dust suffered
for many years from vague and undefined symptoms,
before the disease became a clinical entity_.

‘IT MIGHT BE PSYCHOSOMATIC

Silicosis is a very important disease in industrial
medicine because of the long-time disability it pro-
duces. Industrial health rules are meticulous in
setting forth maximum concentration of particles
to which workers may be exposed.

Exposure to beryllium dust can cause tumors and
cancers of the lung; (This is also true of nickel dust).

When fluorescent light bulbs are broken it is possi-

ble to develop skin cancers. It may take as long as
five years for the disease, berylliosis, to develop. Or
one may suffer an acute case of pneumonitis fairly
soon. _

Like silicosis, the disease berylliosis, is significant
for us because the. hazard existed for many years be-
fore its harmful potential was recognized. Likewise,
with other industrial dusts.

It would seem therefore that intelligence would
direct that we avoid the inhalation of these metallic
fumes and dusts, of whose action we still know little,
rather than to go on blithely exposing ourselves to
them because their untoward action “hasn’t been
proved.”

PARTICULATE LEAD

One seems to hear so little about lead particles!
Each gallon of gasoline here in the West usually
contains from 2 to 3 cc of tetraetheyl lead. Three
cubic centimeters amounts to about sixty drops.

Tetraethyl Lead is extremely toxic. It is emitted
from the exhaust of the automobile as a volatile lead
compound in minute particles. The amount con-
tained in only 1 gallon of gas, 2 to 3 cc.- is more than
enough to kill. An even more serious feature of vol-
atile lead compounds emitted by automobile exhaust
is that the size of the particles is submicronic, and
are able to penetrate the body via the lungs. Lead
acts as a cumulative poison.

THOSE WONDERFUL ADDI TI VE S

Poisoning from tetraethyl lead is a serious hazard
to those engaged in its manufacture and handling;
cleaners of gasoline storage tanks, who inhale the
fumes in their work, are, many of them, suffering
from chronic lead poisoning.

13

Tetraethyl lead compounds may even gain access
to the body through the intact skin.

Citizens of Los Angeles are not suffering from
acute poisoning due to tetraethyl lead compounds.
But let us see what symptoms are attributable to
“mild” or "light” exposure to tetraethyl lead.

Insomnia..
Loss of appetite, especially at breakfast.
Nervousness.

Loss of weight.

Fatigue.

Weaknes.s

Muscle pain.

Diarrhea.

Metallic taste in mouth.

Reduced blood pressure.

These symptoms, admittedly, apply to a great
many other diseases as well. ‘

“NO NEED FOR CONCERN”

Here is reassurance from the Ethyl Corporation as
to any possible hazard to the general public from the
gasoline additive known as tetraethyl lead:

“. '. . no need for concern at normally used con-
centrations of TEL, even under the most adverse
conditions . . . No trouble from lead poisoning has
developed, and analyses of air in many cities have
shown lead concentrations, as judged by current hy-
gienic criteria, TO BE INSIGNIFICANT. These
analyses have suggested also that much of the lead
burned in gasoline is not exhausted in forms which
can remain suspended in the atmosphere.”

Well, the makers of tetraethyl lead should know!
On the other hand, what would happen to a poor
research chemist at the Ethyl Corporation laborator-
ies, who thought TEL was dangerous?

Here, by the way of contrast, are some of the Pre-
cautions which workers exposed to tetraethyl lead
must observe in industry:

JOB SAFETY, _THAT’S
ANOTHER THING

“THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS APPLY
TO ALL LIQUID ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF
LEAD, THEIR CONCENTRATED MIXTURES,

breathed. Never touch any article wet with these
compounds except when wearing gloves impervious
to tetraethyl lead.

“2. Only persons trained in laboratory methods
should be permitted ot handle these compounds or
equipment contaminated with them.

3!‘ ?l- 3!‘ 3!-

"8. Whenever tetraethyl lead compound or con-
centrated solutions thereof are spilled, proceed as
follows:

at. ALL PERSONS MUST LEAVE THE AREA
AT ONCE, and not return until equipped with im-
permeable gloves, rubber apron, and an approved
gas mask. The gas mask may be either an air-line
hose mask through which fresh air is continually
pumped, or a canister type, consisting of a full-face
rubber gas mask, with eyepieces of splinterless glass,
a rubber breathing tube‘, and a canister separate from
the facepiece, containing not less than 500 cc. of ac-
tivated charcoal. _

b. If spill is on the skin——wash thoroughly with
kerosine, followed by soap and water.

c. If spill is on the clothing———immediately remove
and thoroughly wash clothing in kerosine or non-
inflammable dry cleaner.

d. If spill is on shoes or other leather articles—-
tbey sbould be burned as tbey cannot be adequately
decontaminated.

e. If spill is on ﬂoors or equipment —— it may be
cleaned up with cotton waste saturated with kero-
sine, and cotton waste must be burned. Wooden
floors will absorb tbe compounds and tbis may
necessitate tbe removal of tbe contaminated boards.

and finger nails must be thoroughly cleaned before
any object, such as food, tobacco, or gum is placed
in the mouth. .

“I0. Whenever these compounds are handled out-
side a ventilated hood, an approved gas mask, rubber
apron, and gloves impervious to tetraethyl lead must
be worn.”

ONLY 3 c. c.

Thinking that such an extremely hazardous
chemical, even when dilute, deserves just a mite of
“concern,” we tried to get data on the concentration
of volatile lead at traffic intersections in Los Angeles.

It's plain surprising how with the testing, measur-
jng, monitoring, evaluating, processing that goes on

as a function of our Air Pollution Control District,
and despite the maintenance f a "public informa-
tion” staff, it’s so difficult to find such data.

POOR PEOPLE OF PARIS

We did, however, ﬁnd data in the literature where
tests on volatile lead had been made. The concen-
trations ran as high as 0.12 mg per cubic meter.
THIS WAS CONSIDERED? IMPORTANT—i’n
Paris, France, that is, where the tests were run. In
Paris most of the cars are small; cyclists are numer-
ous; and there are not so many enormous buildings
to trap in air. Such a long way to go for data!

We telephoned a physicist at Air Pollution Foun-
dation, who reported that traffic tests had shown
concentrations of volatile lead compounds .on thor-
ughways in Los Angeles to be as high as 0.16 mg per
cubic meter.— Since the Meximum Allowable Con-
centration in industry for volatile lead is 0.15 mg per
cbic meter, we expressed surprise.

Such data is certainly not something the public
relations experts like to have on,hand to “let the
public know.”

When we expressed concern at the relatively high
concentration for such an extremely toxic poison
(far more toxic than arsenic‘ dust), our informant
said: “Oh, well, you probably get as much as that
on the food you eat every day, insect sprays and all.”

Thank heavens! Everything is all right again!

ANOTHER NOTE FROM
FOREIGN SCENE

M.A.C’s or threshold limits are not supposed to be
critical levels. They are supposed to represent levels
which would have to be greatly exceeded to produce
noticeable symptoms.

Notwithstanding, we’re just captivated by a foot-
note in a leading textbook of Industrial Hygiene
(Patty) that Russia — of all countries! — has an
M.A.C. for carbon monoxide of 35 ppm as against
ours of 100 ppm. Now this was in 1948, and we
don’t know if the ﬁgure has been changed.

Shall we infer. that (1) Russians are so puny they
are more susceptible to toxic substances; (2) we are
so superior and hearty we can “take it”; or (3) per-
haps the increasingly liberal tendencies of those who
enjoy "scientific immunity” t.o dollop out extra por-
tions of poisons may well be worth restraining.

PROPAGANDA --
AND PUBLIC HEALTH

When a patient’s condition is hopeless, the phy-
sician resorts to palliative measures. Since further
treatment can accomplish nothing, just make the pa-
tient comfortable. Keep up his spirits. Above all,
maintain a cheerful, optimistic front. “You’re' get-
ting along ﬁne!” You’ll be up and around next
week.”

The analogy — although grisly — seems not in-
appropriate to a situation where 6 million people
live exposed to a health hazard of the ‘ﬁrst magni-
tude, poison-polluted air. The cheery voice and the
placebos are provided by a county organization
known as the Air Pollution Control District, or the
A.P.C.D.; more particularly, by members of the
propaganda staff who call themselves "public relat-
tions” or “information” aides."‘

PLACE BOS FROM
THE PUBLICISTS

Every now and then a patie_nt rebels. H.e wants to
thrust‘ aside the apparatus for tube-feeding and at-
tempt even the most radical treatment —— if there
is a jot of promise in it. He’d even like the truth
about his condition without the masking ﬂavor of
cherry syrup.

To most of us propaganda is an ugly word; we’d
like to think that Russians and Nazis were its only
victims. A successful propaganda campaign leaves
too many dupes in its wake — among them, us.

The purpose of propaganda is to develop public
attitudes congenial to the ends of the propagandists,.
During World War II so devious were the methods
of enemy propagandists, that no radio report em-
anating from a belligerant country could be taken
at face value. Many newspapers routinely printed
over each such story a warning to its readers not to
accept it as true until later verification. We ourselves
in the “war of ideas” had to become combatants in
skillful propaganda techniques. Apparently many
of our “information” men today received their train-

ing when no moral question was ever raised as to the-

propriety o-f their methods.

* By no means has A.P.C.D. alone preempted the propa-
ganda field; There are also Air Pollution Foundation,
oil companies, industries, Calif. State. Dept. of Public
Health and medical societies.

BY ANY OTHER NAME,
I T’S STILL PROPAGANDA

A propagandist by any other name is still a pro-
pagandist. A corporation president would blanch if
you were to call his “public relations counsel” a pro-
pagandist, but any candid person would have to ad-
mit the techniques employed are the same.

Newspaper city desks and other communications
media are swamped daily by handouts prepared by
“public relations” experts. Yet, what are they to do?
Those handouts contain news; are written expertly.
When not too blatantly commercial, a good many
are published. No editor kids himself, however. It
may be "news,” and it would have taken a corps of
his reporters a good while to track down the same
data, but that “news” has been censored at the
source. It has been sieved, and the unattractive par-
ticles cast aside.

Corporations depend on their public‘ relations men
to “make friends of the community” and for their
"product.” We might become a little cynical at times,
yet we usually concede it’s their money, and their
business.

“SHOULD” THEY KNOW?

When government bureaus, public school systems,
and medical associations retain “public relations”
counsel to provide us with news we “should” hear,
that is another thing. It becomes very much our bus-
iness when public taxes are used in the process of glos-
sing over and duping, even when the effect is to
make us happy and content.

When —— in their concern lest the people “become
aroused” — public health ofﬁcials can turn their data
over to their public relations staff "for processing
for public information,” we’re a good league and a
half away from anything resembling freedom ‘of
the press or even freedom itself.

To what extent should propaganda techniques be
allowed to inﬁltrate the ﬁeld of public health? Every
sensitive individual reading these lines should pon-
der that question.

In World War II, we were briefed to “know the
enemy,” so subtle were the means employed by pro-
pagandists among us. Must we have to review those
measures in order that we may read the daily news-
paper or listen to the radio, in order to ﬁnd out how
critical are matters affecting our public welfare?

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

IT’S SUBTLE ALL RIGHT

The skillful propagandist is no match for most
of us. His arsenal has been taken from the most pro-
found study of psychology, public opinion polls,
and from divining the secret wishes and aspirations
of our inner selves.

When propaganda is linked with public health,
a moral question is involved: In the name of “pub-
lic relations,” bringing “our story to the people,”
how much should be tolerated in the way of sub-
tle misrepresentation? Is not practiced, buoyant
cheerfulness a form of deceit? When is the wilful
passing over, the ignoring of that which might alarm
of that which might detract from “our story,” a form
of guile?

FREUD STILL KNOWS BEST

The Air Pollution Control District has been a ﬁx-
ture in Los Angeles County since 1947. It was not
until 1955 when the public had become “cynical,
disgusted, and confused” —— in the words of the PR
staff — that the Air Pollution Control District asked
the Board of‘ Supervisors for succor. It was pro-
vided through an "aggressive jublic information
program."

Today no one will. deny that there has been a
great change in the public attitude toward "smog.”
That "public relations” has been responsible for this
change is indubitable. The A.P.C.D. now applauds
the tractability of the population in the “smog bat-
tle.” In its publications, it refers to that sorry time
when "specious arguments disseminated by special
interest groups and self-seekers” were rife. Yes, we’ve
been through this together.

CONFESSIONS OF A
“SELF-SEEKER”

Public attitude toward "smog” has been subtly
and unconsciously resolved. The organization which
for over a decade has spent tens of millions of dollars
“controlling” smog has evolved into a Freudian pa-
rent-image,‘ toward whom are directed ambivalent
feelings of hostility and dependence. Many who tele-
phone the “information” staff of A.P.C.D. on bad
days, lambaste the aide who answers. This is actually
therapeutic; telephone therapy.*

An insidious aspect in the change of public atti-

tude is the seeming acceptance of "smog” by the
vast majority as a natural phenomenon, like volcanic
ash sifting down upon the countryside. Yes, it’s
hard, and it certainly isn’t too good for people with
weak lungs, or the old folks, but if you don’t like
it, you’d better leave.

This is by no means an accidental accomplishment_.
It reﬂects propaganda at its most subtle and skilful.
The objective is to render a once emotionally-coloured
word innocuous. ("Communists? Why, they’re just
like us folks!” “The Reds? Why, they just want the
same things we do.” Get the idea?)

“WE CAN’T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT I T” —— THAT’S GOOD PR

The word “smog” itself is a euphemism. How
different would be our reaction if the term "smog”
were to be deleted from every one of the hand-
some (and free) “information” booklets put out by
A.P.C.D., the oil companies, and the ~Air Pollution
Foundation, and the term. "poisoned air” had to be
substituted in its place. (“Poisoned air” will be used
throughout this pamphlet; and “smog” kept in quo-
tation marks.)

Here are ways to strip even “smog” of its fear-
ful connotation. "Sm0g” was always here. At this
moment I am looking at the handsome cover of :1
booklet put out by an oil company. The picture shows
the ship of Cabrillo entering Los Angeles Harbor for
the ﬁrst time. Indians were burning ﬁres along the
shore. Cabrillo named the harbor the “Bay of

_ Smokes.”

16

Here’s another photo, a real beauty, in a magazine
of great prestige. It shows “smog” in a Brazilian tro-
pical forest, over a thousand miles away from in-
dustry. That “smog” is due just to the "natural oxi-
dation” of the organic material_in the forest. "Smog?”
Why, it’s natural, so it’s nothing to worry about!

When groans of the sufferers still don’t subside,
the propagandist has another trick. “Smog is due
to the activities of people.” This is enough to give
us all a massive guiltcomplex. And if guilt is to be
apportioned among 6 million defendants, how on
earth would anyone go about placing criminal re-
sponsibility?

* Los Angeles psychiatrists admit their phones are swamp-
ed on “smoggy” days by agitated patients.

 

 

“SMOG” OVER. LOS ANGELES

“LIGHT TO MODERATE
EYE IRRITATION TODAY”

It is a testimonial to adroit propaganda that in the
minds of millions of Southern Californians ‘-‘smog”
means just a little eye irritation, decreased visibility,
a cough that now and then becomes a nuisance. There
is a passive acceptance of “smog.” We have even
incorporated new meanings into our language. We
refer to the “smog season” as persons living in India
refer to the “monsoon season.” We no longer refer
to "getting rid of smog” but rather “controlling” it-.

Only now and then during very “smoggy” periods
do spurts of indignation bec'ome reﬂected in letters
to newspaper editors. The millions who should be
most concerned are conﬁdent that some day “they”
will do something about it. “They” won’t -let us suf-
fer. “They” won’t let harm come our way.

This is a wholesome attitude —— from the view-
point of the propagandist. It indicates that the pub-
lic has lost a little of its capacity to rely upon its
intelligence and to-use its own initiative — both in-
telligence and initiative being great hindrances to
an effective propaganda program.

BORIC SOLUTION
HELPS . . . A LITTLE

Let’s take this little matter of eye irritation. Yes,
it’s a nuisance. Swabbing the eyes with dilute boric
acid helps somewhat. If the eye itself swells, applying
Warm compresses for 20 to 30 .minutes can help re-
lieve it. As you lie there with the comforting com-
press over your eyes, would it shock you to be told
that eye irritation is one of a complex of symp-
toms associated with poisonous gases? “Eye irrita-
tion” means toxic substances have actually combined
with the protein of the eye; that cells from the cor-
nea itself have sloughed off; and that the cell struc-
ture of the eye substance has been actually altered. _

We become hoarse sometimes during “smoggy”
episodes. Some of us react with a dry hacking cough.
That’s because our respiratory tract is doing all it
can to engulf particles of poisonous irritant with
mucus, which allows the offending substance to be

W/coughed up. The reﬂexes of the respiratory tract can

only do so much, however. The human system can
tolerate only a little more poison than canaries and
guinea pigs. To a physician, a “mere cough” can
mean anything from a nervous habit to imminent
heart collapse.

THE ID . , . THE EGO . . . AND ‘SMOG’

The -skilful propagandist (certainly one whose
client represents billions of dollars) can call .in a
crew of psychoanaysts to help out. And those guys
know us backwards and forwards.

Security is" one of the most dominant human urges.
Choking on “smog” makes people scared, uneasy, be-

reft. You can’t exactly turn ,a lead smelter into a A

father-image, but you can go a long way. Those
folks have to know that someone is looking after
them, someone cares.

That’s why so much of the “information” literature V

has the YOU slant. We want YOU to understand
why we have “smog.” We want YOU to know what
we’re doing about it.. We want YOU to know we
have some very clever doctors doing research which

will help YOU.

Smog Boss becomes a personalized image — should
we say a parent—image? We hate him when it’s “smog-
gy.” Why does he let this happen to US? Then We

realize that Smog Boss is in there fighting for us.

“SMOG CHIEF LAMBASTED BY CITY
COUNCIL” “SMOG CHIEF GOES BE-
FORE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS”
“SMOG CHIEF ON THE HOT SEAT”

“SMOG CHIEF FIGHTS TO PASS RULE XYZ”

Can’t you just see him in there ﬁghting for us?
It’s enough to make you want to go down to Hall
of Records and cheer him.

Smog Boss also knows when it’s necessary to be
a soft—voiced despot. (Good fathers know when
they have to be stern.) On real “smoggy” days when
reﬁneries along the coast and hundreds of indus-
trial plants are spewing fumes, when the black-
brown smoke from heavy diesel-powered equipment,
buses and trucks billows forth unchecked, you get
sort of scared. It should be stopped. Why doesn't
someone do something?

Smog Boss knows when he has to put a stop to
this talk! He has the answer all right: He tells you
he is already controlling a couple thousand tons of
industrial poisons.'Know what would happen if all
that were released on a “smoggy” day? There would
be few persons left in Los Angeles to worry about
“smog.” Still complaining?

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

“IN CASE OF A SMOG ATTACK,
CALL YOUR FRIENDLY A.P.C.D. . .”

Should such a gruesome thing ever occur, that
Los Angeles experienced a disaster like that which
took many thousands of lives in London (and it’s
not possible to conceal the matter in the interstices
of vital statistics), it is quite probable that the A..P.
C.D-. will be in the forefront of those organising
rescue teams. Ambulances, stretchers, and oxygen
cylinders will probably bear cheery stickers: “Your
A.P.C.D. is on the job! Serving 6 million people in
the Greater Los Angeles Area.”

This is not vulgar satire. It is a mere extension of
the means employed by the Air Pollution Control
District, the rather farcical bedside manner — a little
out of date now -—- of the father—physician, who lets
you know how grave your condition is, and yet
wants you to know he’s there to help you. If you’re
smart, you’ll listen and do what you’re told..

“BREATHE SMOG! LIVE LONGER!”

"Let the People Know!” “The People Have a
Right to be Informed!” These are the banners in
A.P.C.D.’s Public Enlightenment campaign.

Members of the "Public Information” staff are
so diligent they even invade the classrooms. They
supply booklets and posters to the schools; they get
the cooperation of science supervisors. and science co-
ordinators. Teachers are even given “competent in-
struction from District representatives.”

Sometimes those school meetings are open to the
public. You are even allowed to ask the “District
representative” questions that bother you. Here’s one
exchange: '

Question from the audience: “Some people
say that “smog” causes sickness. Is that
true? Does it really have any effect on
health?” (Will the bad man really get

me, Pappa?)

The speaker shakes his head; his smile is just warm
enough, just suﬁiciently reassuring so that the ques-
tioner need not feel too embarrassed for having asked
such a ridiculous question.

Answer: “I’m really glad you asked that
question. Look at it this way. Fifty years
ago there was no ‘smog’ in Southern Cali-
fornia. And you know what the life-ex-
pectancy of a person was then? Only 45
years. Now in 1958 we have a good many

smoggy days. And what’s our life expec-
tancy? Why it’s nearly 70 years, and We
hope to make it a lot» greater.”

Hurray! Hurray! Breathe Smog! Live Longer!

Hearing this, I cast about among the audience
wondering if any of the high school teachers would
devote some considerable time in his or her class
to exposing this fallacy. I wondered whether the
day of “Conform and Be Safe” had indeed arrived.

THE DEVICE OF MR. GRISWOLD

It is revealing at times to see a graph showing the
amount of intoxicants in the air over a year’s time;
such a graph has to be studied. A much simpler
means of knowing how things are “smog”—wise' in Los
Angeles is to see how many years projected into the
future is the “device” of  Griswold.

It’s the perennial news story.

“SMOG" OVER LOS ANGELES

“THE REFINERIES IN THIS AREA . 

"The reﬁneries in this area are the cleanest in the
world . . . The reﬁneries in this area are the cleanest
in the world . .. . The reﬁneries in this . . .”

This is the saturation technique, and although
you may be choking that minute from the gaseous
exudates from the El Segundo plant, you’ll be bab-
bling the same tune: “The reﬁneries in this area. . .”

When this technique is used on our boys captured
by the enemy, it’s called "brainwashing.”

PROTECT THE PEOPLE.’
GET RID OF POISONS.’

When things get too bad, and citizen’s groups
begin milling around Hall of Records, and the scene
begins to look like -a mass fumigation project, the
propagandist knows how to handle it. He starts a
campaign.

SMOG BOSS SAYS, ‘GET
HYDROGEN FLUORIDE
OUT OF THE AIR’

The headlines are screaming it. Smog Boss is again
interrogated by City Council, and Board of Super-
visors-have poor Smog Boss on the carpet. But Smog
Boss goes in slugging. He’s shown all washed up,
ready to collapse after the struggle, but persists.

‘GET HYDROGEN
FLUORIDE OUT OF THE AIR’

Smog Boss says every company putting hydrogen
ﬂouride into the atmosphere should be forced to
close down.

(And you thought he wasn’t working for US!)

A struggle needs an opposition. You’ve got to
ﬁnd some "ﬂouride people” to scream that they don’t
want to cut down. This is hard. Someone pops up to
say that there’s no ﬂuoride in the air anyhow, but
he’s shushed up. They have a real hard time round-
ing up companies that eject ﬂuorides from their
stacks, but they get ’em.

Medical experts appear to say that ﬂuorides are
deadly poisons.

Smog Boss ﬂails about insisting that Los Angeles
citizens aren’t going to be exposed to deadly poi-
sons. A citizens’ group is milling around Hall -of
Records at the time the crucial hearing is held. And
word is passed out.

19

“Board of Supervisors passes resolution un-
animously! ”

"Any industry releasing ﬂuorides into Los
Angeles air must close down.” ' ‘

The extras are on the street in an hour.

ANOTHER VICTORY
WON BY SMOG—CRAZED FOLK

SMOG BOSS CONGRATULATED!

Later on at headquarters the oﬂice messenger boy
says, “I just don’t get it! There was never any ﬂuor-
ide in the air anyhow!”

"Shut up, you dope!”

LET THE PEOPLE KNOW

When smog creeps over the city ﬁlling all crevices

, and tormenting the citizenry, the valiant members

of the Public Information staff of A.P.C.D. re-
main unﬂinchingly at their posts — the telephones.

Of the 15,019 telephone calls received at A.P.C.D.
Public Information HQ last year . . . (calls are tal-
lied so that they may be inserted in the year’s Pro-
gress Report), most of them are received on “smog-
gy” days, when people get some sort of emotional
release from vilifying anyone at A.P.C.D.

APCD EXPECTS EVERY PR MAN
WILL DO HIS DUTY

You can learn very interesting things by asking
for “information”

Back to Ozone, let’s see what A.P.C.D. can tell
us on the subject.

“Ozone? Yes, people do talk a lot about it. For my-
self, I think it’s overrated. Such a tiny bit and all.”

“Know something? Our chief down here, Mr. Gris-
wold, placed himself in a plexiglass container we
have here, and our technicians put in ozone at 2
whole parts per million. That’s four times the a-
mount we have to call an alert on. After two hours
he bounced right back.”

“Has it anything to do with cancer?” .

“Oh, well, if you’re worried about that, one 0
our Scientiﬁc Team at the University of Southern
California is do-ing some experiments. Once a day
he puts mice in a sealed chamber which has air and
1 ppm ozone for one hour. Every day they bounce
right back. After two years, there’s found not to
be a trace of cancer in their lungs. The only thing

 

 

“SMOG” oven Los ANGELES

our scientist found was that these mice were a bit
smaller on the average than the controls.”

What a relief! That takes care of ozone! Does it?

As for Mr. Grisw'old’s dramatic self-exposure, the
subject of the experiment is a hearty male standing
about 6 feet, 2 inches, weighing in at 225 pounds, in
excellent health. He didn’t, however, “bounce right
back” after his 2-hours session of breathing pure air
to which had been added 2 parts per million ozone.
Not like those bouncy mice, at any rate, The mice,
on the other hand, can’t tell you how they feel.

“AND HE BOUNCED RIGHT BACK”

Looking up the Archives of Industrial Health, you
ﬁnd the subject. complained of tightness and pain
in his chests; he felt unable to concentrate. Later on,
his hands and feet felt a little numb. The chest pain
recurred later in the evening. He suffered from in-
somnia. In two or three days he developed a cough
and raised mucus from deep within his chest. He
had this cough for about two weeks. Also, for a
period of at least two weeks he had symptoms he
could describe only as "extreme tiredness.”

The- Ordeal of Mr. Griswold should impress us
with his desire to risk his life for Science, for us. He
went into a sealed chamber into which was piped fil-
tered air containing 1.5 parts per million ozone dur-
ing the ﬁrst half hour, and 2.0 ppm ozone during
the ﬁnal hour and ahalf.

Our gratitude is just slightly. altered when we
learn that, as long ago as 1913 two medical investi-
gators undertook to submit themselves to the ozone,
experiment, except that they took in more ozone,
and stayed longer. They, too, complained of irrita-
tion and headache.

The stunt did, however, provide forage,‘ everlast-
ing forage, for the public relations experts." Ozone
dangerous? Just listen to this . . and then the in-
cident is recounted. ’

RESEARCH: MICE, MONEY, OZONE

Now for the mice who "bounce right back” after
an exposure of 1 ppm ozone for 1» hour each day.
One can feel a little cynical about this experiment,
and especially the emphasis that these mice showed
no ‘trace of cancer, Here, too, one is given the im-
pression, subtly, that ozone is the carcinogen to wor-
ry about in the» atmosphere."‘ The literature on the
exposure of animals to concentrations of ozone is
quite revealing.

20

What then could be the purpose of an experiment
in which mice are exposed to varying concentrations
of ozone? The 2-year span of the experiment can-
not at all be related to human beings where calcula-
tions indicate that it takes sometimes 15 to 20 years
to develop lung cancer.

Could it be that the purpose of the experiment is
to find an optimum concentration of ozone, and an
optimum exposure time which; will permit mice to
“bounce right back” good as new, so that individuals
who call in for “information” may be reassured?

STAFFERS PLEASE NOTE . . .

Make as many tie-ins with positive images that
you can. American Cancer Society has plenty of pre-
stige. Have some guy who’s an M.D. from it say
that “smog” won’t hurt people, or at least that "they
can’t prove it.” People seem to think that anyone
from those charitable groups is 100% philanthropic.

Get those fellows to mention cigarette smoking a’
lot. .

“You’re complaining about smog! Why, smoking
cigarettes is ten times worse.”

(Say, Boss, didn’t we use that line before? Remem-
ber, when all that ruckus came up about cancer being
caused by cigarettes, we said, "Cigarettes! Smog is
ten times worse!”

(Shut up, you dope. We’re on another payroll
now.)

MEMO TO CHIEF

How about tossing some good slogans into our
campaign, Boss. Why not make folks like smog? “No
smog like California smog!,” “Breathe Smog! Live
Longer!,” “When smog’s around, good jobs “abound.”
Nothing like a good slogan, I’ve always said. We
could reserve some radio and TV time and sliplit
in on 20-second showings.

* On three separate occasions I telephoned A.P.C.D. and
asked to speak to a member of the informational staff,
and then inquired about any “possible” connection be-
tween “smog” and cancer. Studies on this subject are
voluminous. On each occasion I was given vague or eva-
sive answers such as, “Well, I certainly don't see any-
thing here.-. .” or given information on experiments hav-
ing no bearing at all on carcinogens. This, from a tax-’
paid organization now and then lauded for “keeping the
public informed.” I

“INTO WHICHEVER HOUSE”

It’s too bad the propagandist doesn’t announce
himself by means of a sound truck, or by giving
away free sticks of chewing gum. We’d know some-
thing was in the offing right off. What’ can the
poor layman do when the “scientist” steps into the
ring? Well, he get’s thrown for the count.

One of the scientific mainstays of A',.P.C.D., for
instance, is Dr. P. Kotin. Let’s draw into sharp
focus the image of, this Dedicated Scientist, working,
searching, testing, experimenting . . . For What? To
ﬁnd the "Mystery Element Y” in “smog”? Willhe
inject himself with the dread bacillus in his dedica-
tion to “science?” , _  .

Dr. K-otin is both a practical and ambitious. man.
We must go back a few years to know his -adroiti
strategy.

In 1953‘ some very important papers were read at
the National meeting of the American Cancer So-
ciety giving the positive unarguable relationships be-
tween cigarette smoking and cancer. Who spoke up
in vigorous protest. Dr. P, Kotin. "Compared to
smog, cigarettes‘ are nothi'ng”——such was the tenor
of his report.

Do we recognize at once the zealot, the scientist
who Wants to save us from the dangers of “smog”.
Dr Kotin must be identified as a member of the
Scientific Advisory Board of the American Tobacco
Industries, who is a “dedicated” man; he is dedicat-
ed to diverting as much fire from the cigarette—canc'er
furor as possible——and “smog” is a most convenient
place to send it.

And never mention “poison” in the same breath
with automobile exhaust. When we say there is as

BOMBAST FROM. BERKELEY

Say, fellows, don’t let this happen again! John

“Just before departing for Washington, this
week to consult with the Surgeon", General
about “smog”, Dr. John Goldsmith of the Cal-

that the citizens were entitled to the Four" Free-
doms: These are Freedom from Adverse’ Ef-
fects of Smog; Freedom from Risk; Freedom
from Impaired Health; Freedom from Chronic

Irritation.”

That’s what you call a good. news release to the
papers and a swell tie-in. Now how about some of
you working out a deal with the Bill of Rights, that
sounds as good. You might even tie in the Declara-
tion of Independence. A if

WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!

Never refer to a "smog” crisis. Make partners of
the people. Call it always a “Smog Battle.” That
booklet called “Breaking the'Smog Barrier” is per-
fect. It ties in us with the scientiﬁc marvels of the
20th century.

Now that picture of Dr. What’shisname peering
down the barrel of that spectrometer. “Ultra-sensi-
tive new Instrument probes smog secrets.” That’s
good too. Keep using that phrase “smog secrets” or
“mystery of smog.” It keeps people thinking there
is a mystery to it. ‘

of space to lamenting its presence. _.

No newspaper representative will,- however, dis-
agree with these statements: (1) A newspaper will
not go outof its way to offend. unduly the business
interests of the community. (2) It will not do any-

ulation to become panic-striken.

 

OVER LOS ANGELES

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

For illustration of this, reference may be made
to the Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition in
1933. An epidemic of amebic dysentery broke out
and was deliberately “played down” to a point of
suppression by the news media. Visitors might re-
fuse to come to Chicago. Thousands of dollars would
be lost by those who had invested money.

Many deaths occurred; and many hapless visitors
became ill with this very serious malady, for which
there was then not the treatment we have today.

"Smog” has become too insidious and invasive
for a mere newspaper crusade.

YOU, TOO, CAN BE A
RABBLEROUSER

We want to be on the Right Side, the Good Side.
Yes we do, no matter how some of us might say
we’re Rugged Individualists. We want to be recog-
nized, thought well of, and represent the better ele-
ments of our communities. We like to be associated
with good people and —— when necessary — engage
in heroic struggles.

These wants are reﬂected _in the subtle psycholo-
gical mechanisms of transfer and identiﬁcation. Ob-
serve how propaganda techniques go about this
so deftly.

Admit it’s true! Haven’t YOU now" and then
thought that certain drastic measures were in or-
der, when day after day the noisome accumulation
of poisons in the air increases? Haven’t YOU ever
thought that there might be days when the reﬁn-
erics should shut down, and along with them, why
not order the lead smelters and the big fume-pro-
ducing industries to shut down too? And those
diesel trucks and buses! Why, they’re shooting poi-
sonous aldehydes and nitric oxides into the air by
the millions of cubic feet. Why not electrify the
buslines anyhow? And on" days when there is a pall
of poison overhead, why not put automobile trafﬁc
on a "necessity only” basis as we had during war-
time?

THERE’S AN ART TO
NAME-CALLING

Before you let the words out of your mouth,
they’ve got the slurs ready for you. But it’s subtle,
all right, this name calling! You’re not exactly call-
ed crazy for taking moderate preventive measures

before there’s a debacle of deaths in the area -
but you’re given to understand what side you’re on.
This time the propaganda line issues from the
mouth of the Managing Director of the Air Pollu-
tion Foundation’s Scientiﬁc Team, W. L. Faith.
The phony front organization is another of the
more obvious propaganda techniques. For instance
if you wanted to set up an organization which had
as its purpose converting this nation to communism,
what would you call it? “Frends of Khrushchev
Club?” The answer to this we all know, having seen
the sorry history of organizations heatedly pro-
testing they were working for “American Ideals.”
Any veteran of the Paciﬁc campaignlearned in
jungle ﬁghting to be alert when he heard, “Joe?

“All technical men now- agree
that hydrocarbons and related
organic compounds are, toget-
her with oxides of nitrogen, the
major cause of some, if not all
of the bothersome manifesta-
tions of smog. An emotional

spurred on by rabblerousers or
sincere but uninformed individ-
uals, yells: Get rid of them!
Shut down the reﬁneries! Abol-

“Dedicated to the solution of the smog problem.”

Yes, we’ll certainly agree it’s “dedicated.” It’ll work.

toward the removal of poisons in the atmosphere
when it’s found economically proﬁtable for its in-
dustrial backers to do so — not before.

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

THOSE DIESELS I

If every truck, bus, and piece of diesel equipment
in Los Angeles were to be removed by tomorrow,
there would be little perceptible difference  the
smog situation. Or, what is referred to as the “over-
all picture”. This means your car might be flooded
with diesel exhaust as you are forced to follow an
MTA bus into town, but that the poison fumes bath-
ing your face can’t even be felt by someone in Watts
or Beverly Hilis.

DIESEL FUEL IS ECONOMICAL

Yet the existence of these obvious leaks of poison
into the atmosphere, WHEN THE REMEDY IS
AVAILABLE, must be taken as a criterion of the
eﬂﬁciency with which the'“smog control” people are
doing their job, and it must be considered an intima-
tion of what we may hope from them in the future
when it comes to “doing something” besides giving
euphoriac press releases to the papers.

The following are statements of fact:

(1) Trucks and busses can be run without
using diesel fuel. ('2) They can be run on gasoline;
(3) Using gasoline, they‘ would be able to utilize
after-burners, already on the market, which, how-
ever, cannot be adapted as yet to the ordinary pas-
senger vehicle; (4) even with equipment employing
diesel fuel there are filters and scrubbers available to
render most of us fumes innocuous.

Even at this miniscule level there is nevertheless
money involved. Diesel-fuel suppliers would be of-
fended——nay outraged; gasoline is more expensive;
the change—over might cost as much as a couple of
hundred dollars per vehicle. That’s quite a lot of
money, when one company or trucking concern may
own several hundred trucks or pieces of equipment.
(At such an impasse, it is much better to raise a
psuedo-issue such as regulating the hours in which
housewives could burn their rubbish.)

LET’S NOT DISTURB ECONOMY

Coy about doing anything to offend organized in-
dustrial interests, here is how A. P. C. D. ducks this
issue: The matter is taken care of in one of the
more irnpressive—appearing scientific reports issuing
from the public relations and educational department
of this tax-supported agency:

“Only 120,000 gallons of diesel fuel are

burned per day by buses, trucks, and rail-
roads in Los Angeles for transportation as

23

compared to 4,5 00,000‘ gallons of basoline.
From these figures it is obvious that the
quantity of material discharged from diesel
ex/aausts is insignificant . . .” (italics supplied)

You need go no further. A..P.C.D. has spoken
and said “it is obvious."

Completely ignored is the fact that diesel fuel
burns at a much hotter temperature, and that the
exhausts of trucks and buses act as generators for
the nitric oxides, the most potent poisons to be found
in smog!

“Exposure to concentrations of oxides of nitrogen
found in diesel exhaust gas is dangerous even for
short periods.”

For this statement we must thank the Bureau of
Mines, which has done a considerable amount of
research on nitric oxides, because of the use of un-
derground diesel equipment.

M.A.C. FOR N02

The American Conference of Governmental In-
dustrial Hygienists recommended a’ threshold limit
of 5 parts per million for nitric oxide (That bus
you’re following is exhaling nitrogen oxides at a
concentration well over 1000 ppm.) . Of course, this
is on the understanding that the expsure may be
over a period of 8 hours. It does not however, take
care of the case, where persons are exposed to nitric
oxides intermittently in huge concentrations.

Considered dangerous for even short exposure, such
as half "an hour, is a concentration of 100 to 150
parts per million of nitrogen dioxide.

RAPIDLY FATAL for short exposures is a con-
centration of the gas of 200 to 700 parts per million.

“MERELY ALDEHYDES”

THE AMOUNTS OF NITRIC OXIDES EMIT-
TED BY DIESEL EXHAUSTS ARE CALCULAT-
ED IN THE THOUSANDS OF PARTS PER MIL-
LION. The fact that dilution with the air is in-
stantaneous when the gas leaves the exhaust, ex-
plains why more automobile drivers aren’t mobile
zombies by the time they reach their destinations.

Further ducking of the issue is represented by the
statement APCD «makes that what you really smell
from the diesel smoke is “merely aldehydes.” They
might as well say “merely cyanide.” Aldehydes are
poisonous hydrocarbons, not so deadly as the nitric
oxides. The aldehydes have a M.A.C. of 20 parts
per million as compared with S of nitric oxides

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

IS THIS OUR
STATE DEPARTMENT
OF PUBLIC HEALTH?

It is the duty of the State Department of Public
Health to compile statistics on disease and death
rates, and to employ competent personnel ableto
make inferences from such data. In all civilized
countries this is a function of government.

Such matters are beyond the scope of the ordinary
citizen. Even the medical practitioner considers med-
ical statistics a specialized technique. It is a ﬁeld
which is extremely important to public health.

Before the preserve of esoteric knowledge repre-
sented by the sciences, the layman knows his place.
Too often, however, he humbles ‘himself unduly.
It is wisdom to know when to rely upon the sci-
entiﬁc expert; it is" also a part of wisdom to know
when common sense should prevail.

RES IPSA

In suits at law for medical negligence there are
occasions when the layman’s judgement suffices. Res
ipsa loquitor — the thing speaks for itself —— is the
rule. For instance, when a patient sues a hospital
because a surgical instrument was _left in his ab-
domen from an appendix operation, (the writer
apologizes for the lamentable example) it doesn’t

(nitrogen dioxide), and 20 of hydrogen cyanide.
Aldehydes “merely” irritate eyes, nose, throat, and
lungs.

Another interesting omission is that in Los An-
geles truck and bus routes, and seemingly so much
heavy construction equipment, are concentrated in
certain areas. There’s East Los Angeles, an indus-
trial site. It is also a residential area classified as
“blighted”. Here, so often, it is possible to observe
these vehicles laying a heavy brown-black smoke
screen, even on hot and "smoggy” days. Within
areas_of stagnant air theyvturn the region into sump
holes.

There is no more justification for these leaks of
poison into the environment, even though the num-
ber of sources may be comparatively small, than
there is justiﬁcation for a dock health inspector to
allow " just a few” rats to leave an incoming ship.

take a highly-paid expert with an M.D.. and a special-
ist’s rating in surgery to conﬁrm that a hemostat
left inside the abdomen isn’t part of recognized sur-
gical technique. Even the most obtuse member of a
layman-jury can see that’s no way to perform an
operation.

Recognizing that the ﬁeld of medical investigation
is very complex, let us, nevertheless, sit as a jury of
laymen and take a look at the evidence. We’ll event-
ually get to having a look at statistical “evidence”
used by our California State Department of Public
Health in stating that poisoned air ("smog”) isn’t
harmful, or has “never been proved to be the cause

of death.”

“IDEAL” EXPERIMENT

Just how would one go about determining the
effect of air poisons (“smog”) on health?

During September, October, and November of
1958 we had an undue number of “alerts,” acknow-
ledgement that appreciable amounts of poisons are
in the atmosphere. During this same period I’d heard
of a number of persons sick with pneumonia, bron-
chitis, or “respiratory ailment” of one type or another.

Impulsively, I want to point out the coincidence:

“See? There it is, proof right before us.”

24-

At this juncture, I recognize my point of view is
biased. Merely amassing a great many illustrative
cases to prove my point is the very opposite of the
sound scientiﬁc approach.

The question must be asked: What would have
been the situation had there been no aerial poi-
sons during September, October, and November? In
a population of 6 million some are dying all the
time, and certainly many are dying of respiratory
disease. How much of the respiratory disease should
be blamed on the air poisons?

To answer the question, let’s set up an ideal ex-
periment, to see what relationship there is between
air poisons (“smog”) and health impairment.

1938 . . . A MEMORABLE
YEAR FOR AIR

We will divide the population of Los Angeles
County into two groups, matched in every respect
so far as age, health, economic status, neighborhood,
length of residence in county, etc. The only difference
between these two groups is that Group I will breathe
air of the vintage 1938 (a highly good year for air
in this region), and Group II will breathe 1958 air
with its acrid dregs of poison.

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

(Yes, the “experiment” follows the lines of pure
whimsy, but it is necessary to follow it through as
a hypothetical example.)

Group I is designated the Pure Air Group; and
Group II, the Poisoned Air Group. (Likewise essen-
tial to the experiment would be having the indi-
viduals comprising each group ignorant as to ‘whe-
ther they were getting the Pure or Poisoned air —
another ludicrous’ impossibility, but truly essential
to an experiment.) The experiment would last- three
years, so that both immediate and long-term effects
could be studied.

Health records are tabulated for all individuals
of both groups. ‘ b

After the 3-year period when the disease records
of the two groups are compared, is there a difference?
Is such a difference ‘'significant,’’ or could it have
arisen on the basis of chance alone?

Let us consider two possibilities:

CON CL USI ON 8

FIRST: In Group I (Pure Air) the disease rate was
just about the same as in Group II (Poisoned Air).
Respiratory‘ ailments followed a seasonal pattern
among both groups, with no special predeliction for
either. No signiﬁcant difference in death rates.

CoNcLUsIoN: The presence of poisons in the air,
in the concentrations existing in Los Angeles, has no
health effect on humans, or at least any damage ef-
fected is too subtle to be detected within threeyears.

SECOND POSSIBILITY: Comparing Groups I and
II it was found there were twice as many cases of
pneumonia, bronchitis, pnuemonitis, pulmonary ede-
ma in Group II (Poisoned Air) as there were in
Group I (plain-fare air). Among those already
having chronic respiratory conditions, there" was
found to be 10 times the number of respirator
deaths. '

CONCLUSION: The two groups being alike in every
respect, poisoned air ‘being the only variable, we

can conclude quite deﬁnitely that aerial poisons are '

related to an increase in disease and respiratory deaths."

LET’S KEEP ON RESEARCHINGI

With such evidence before us, and dealing with
humans rather than mice or guinea pigs, it would be
ridiculous to assert: “But, wait! We have to be cer-
tain just what this poison is. We have to make stu-
dies to see how much of this poisoned air a person

25

can take before he deﬁnitely looks sick. We should
see if any correlation -exists. between feeling sick and
looking sick. Why, we still haven’t made tissue stu-
dies of all those who died. We’ll need a lot of ‘money
to set up research projects — a lot of money, and a

lot of time. We’d like to erect some special labora-

tories to study this thing.”_ V

Were such a situation to arise in such deﬁnitive
outline, those who insisted on keeping the poison in
the air in order that their well-ﬁnanced “studies”
might be completed, would surely be run out of
town in characteristic Old West fashion — a noose
around each neck.

The situation would be as patently ridiculous as
having the defendant’s lawyer in a murder case pro-
test: "Gentlemen of the Jury, you cannot convict my
client of killing his uncle by putting poison on the
pot roast. Why, the experts haven’t even been able
to decide whether it was the arsenic or the strych-

nine which killed him.”

OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS

Obviously, it will never be possible to make studies
of tbe effects of air poisons ("sm0g’.’) on human
beings wbic/9 would permit such unarguable con-
clsions as tbose presented above.

No experiment will ever have the open-and—shut
finality that attends the Germ Theory of Disease.
No bacillus or virus causing “smog” sickness or
“sm-oggy” death will ever be isolated. Sickness and
death resulting from air poisons are brought about
by chemical agents.

Since human beings cannot be studied under the
controlled conditions of the laboratory, a medical
investigation must pursue another course: the study
of a special sampling of the population. In Los An-
geles such a study engrossed the patients in nurs-
ing homes. Inasmuch as the preponderance of deaths
in the London and Donora disasters were among the
aged, the nursing home investigation would seem
a" “natural.” Ninety-two nursing homes were stu-
died; the total patient count was around 3826. Be-

ginning July 3, 1955, each nursing home reported’

its number of daily deaths.

ANALYSES or MORTALITY

A study of death rates in association with such‘

factors as season of year, existence of contagious
disease, (and also in association with the existence
of aerial poisons) is a vital function of a public

alerts.” We know, too, the pattern of a typical "smog-
gy death.” The ﬁrst day is one of complaint; the
second and third day the patient is bedridden, and
a diagnosis of pneumonia or pulmonary edema has
been made; the patient may suffer one, two, or three
days (or even recover) but death typically follows
this course. "Smoggy” death is not immediate, like
the striking down of troops in war —._but a slow-
acting thing.

“THANK YOU, DOCTOR”
“WITNESS EXCUSED!”

As a group of laymen looking_ at these exhibits, we
can already make some pretty good conclusions. A
mere 100 or so “excess deaths” here were due to the
inability of many feeble constitutions to survive a’
bout with poisoned air —— or perhaps the prospect
of returning to the living to face the "smog” sea-
son caused the ﬁnal exitus of many.

Yet, wait. Another variable enters the picture.
September 1 and September 2 were two days of ex-
cessive heat. The temperature was 110°F. on Septem-
ber 1, and 108°F. September" 2. And the following
three days were 103°, 101°, and 100 F. It seems
to this writer that the September 1 and 2 tempera-
tures were horrendous, but the other “high” tem-
peratures not at all excessive for this region of the
country —— the region so many selected to retire in
because of its dry, warm climate. Heat of this na-
ture is far more tolerable than a day in San Fran-
cisco, for instance, with a temperature of 88° and
high humidity.

As a jury of laymen it is quite permissible for us
to feel that, beyond any reasonable doubt, poisoned
air ("smog”) accounted for many, if not most or
all, of those deaths. 'Here’s how the State Depart-
ment of Public Health, whose job it is to employ
personnel of probity and integrity, met the issue in
its beguilingly misleading booklet entitled ‘_‘Clean
Air for California”: , ’

“[The graph’* ] indicates the lack of any corres-

pondence between days of air pollution in Los

Angeles during the last six months of 1955

and deaths in the nursing home population.

Again the sharp rise in mortality associated with

the period of high temperature demonstrates

that these persons are unusually sensitive at least
to this aspect of their environment. Presum-
ably they are the same type of patients that
would be adversely and immediately affected
by air pollution. Yet the data do not substan-

tiate any such effect.” .

THE “DETACHED” SCIENTIST?

The paragraph quoted should be read, thrice read.
The graph to which reference is made should be stu-
died with care. When this has been done, either of
two conclusions may be drawn: (1) The medical-
scientific personnel in the California State Depart-
ment of Public Health, upon whom we depend for
specialized knowledge, are fatuous and incompetent;
or (2) They are dedicated‘ to a vicious and repre-
hensible misrepresentation of fact. A study of the
educational qualifications of those employed on the
professional staff of the State Department of Public
Health should demonstrate that ignorance cannot
suﬂice as an excuse.

‘ Let us not dwell unduly on obsequies for these
fragile inmates of County nursing homes in Los
Angeles. During this period of impacted poisons
in the air, there were 1114 excess deaths in Los An-

geles County at large. One thousand, one hundred '

fourteen more than in the preceeding two weeks,
and in the last two weeks of September.

WHAT DID THEY DIE OF .7’

Of what did these many hundreds die? The pat-
tern of death does not follow any disease epidemic.
Was it heat prostration? That affects many of those
undergoing great physical exertion in the hot sun.
For heat prostration, however, the prognosis is gen-
erally excellent. It is usually transient and the mor-
tality rate is extremely low, although it is possible
for death to occur from ciruclatory failure. (Pre-
sumably bedridden senile patients in nursing homes
are neither exposed to the rays of the hot outdoor
sun, nor are they required to do work involving
great physical exertion.)

Did these hundreds die of heat cramps? That’s
another condition tied in with high tempartures,
causing discomfort to those doing heavy muscular
workiin temperatures above 100°. It is related to
the sudden depletion of water in the tissues, a shift-
ing of the chloride balance, lost through perspira-
tion. Salt tablets help a lot.

Heatstroke? The victims are_those who have un- .

dergone prolonged exposure to excessively high
temperatures (such as could be found in the engine
room of a ship in tropic latitudes), or those exposed
to the direct rays of a ﬁery sun.

Let us just assume that these hundreds of deaths
were due to heatstroke. The clinical symptoms of
heat stroke, however, are easily marked, and can be
related to the activities of the person before he was

stricken. It would be quite simple to “rule out”
heat stroke in these deaths by examining the actual
death certiﬁcates.

VITAL STATISTICS ARE NOT
SECRET PAPERS '

The maintenanceof death records, just as -the
collection of birth and marriage notices, is a recog-
nized function of government, and one relegated
to the Department of Public Health. These records
are public property. The recognition of the public
nature of such documents is about as old as the
doctrine of haheas corpus. It is of extraordinary im-
portance to our public welfare that the State of Cali-
fornia Department of Public Health did not choose
to divulge these "excess deaths” until three years
later. It is of tremendous importance to the public
welfare that a digniﬁed request to be permitted per-
sonal access to these records is handled deviously
and circuitously.

As a jury of laymen, we have used common sense
and intelligence in examining this data. We can
draw certain conclusions “beyond all reasonable

doubt.”

“DON’T TELL ME ANYTHING
UNPLASANT, DOCTOR I”

A trained medical investigator does not permit
himself even "reasonable doubt.” When Dr. C. A.
Mills made his study, he omitted from his calcula-
tions all days when the temperature was over 96°. He
ignored those days in September when the death rate
spiraled. Notwithstanding, he came to the follow-
ing grave conclusions:

“THERE NO LONGER EXISTS”

"In sum total, this Los Angeles smog hazard is
represented by 230 excess respiratory and car-
diac deaths in the year 1949, by 281 in the last
137 days of 1953, and by 334 in the year 1954.
It should be borne clearly in mind that ‘this is
merely one measurable index of smog damage,
that its total of nonfatal ill-health and chronic
damage in the respiratory tract must far out-
Weigh these deaths in community importance.

“If we add to these Los Angeles findings the
Cincinnati survey results clearly relating. lung
cancer incidence to exposure to urban motor
exhaust fumes and general air pollution, we be-
gin to see the outlines of a c'ommunity health

CANCER - Tobacco Indusfry
SMOG — Govt Bureaucracy

"Of the various executive abilities, no one excited
more anxious concern than that of placing the in-
terests of our fellow citizens in the hands of honest
men, with understanding sufficient for their sta-
tion.”

There is a sorry parallel between the reaction of
the tobacco industries, when faced with the irrefut-
able cancer-tobacco link, and the reaction of the
State of California Department of Public Health to
the “smog” crisis.

Dispassionate medical and scientific opinion has
always been in accord with the results of the Amer-
ican Cancer Society study establishing the link be-
tween lung cancer and cigarettes.

What was the reaction of the tobacco industries?
They set up their own medic'al “Research Commit-
tee’ to sponsor “independent research into tobacco
use and health.” A Scientific Advisory Board guides
research by “outstanding scientists and doctors under
conditions of utmost freedom.”

“WE’LL MAKE YOU
OUTSTANDING”

If the “outstanding” scientist who qualiﬁes for a
money. grant doesn’t come from a sufficiently “out-
standing” institution, it’s a simple matter to set up
an institution with prestige for him. It is also ad-
vantageous to have research projects under way on
other diseases like tuberculosis, cerebral palsy, cystic
fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, etc. All these repre-
sent “positive tie-ins.” Surely no’one who is “doing
something” about cerebral" palsy could be a knave!

The cancer-tobacco link has already been estab-
Iished. Subsequent studies have more than substan-

hazard calling for the most effective remedial
measures available. The Los Angeles, situation is
indeed so severe and so fraught with health
hazards to the area’s residents, that any pollu-
tion control program should be put on the com-
pulsory health basis that alone can provide it
with the necessary overriding authority.”'""

tiated the earlier ones. Yet here we have the to-
bacco industry’s Scientific Advisory Board’s pre-
tentious “main areas of investigation of the prob-
lem”:

INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM
(TOBACCO INDUSTRY)

"1. The physical and chemical composition
of tobacco and accompanying products, such
as cigarette papers and additives. This covers
the preparation, fractionation and analysis of
tobacco and of added substances.

"2. Tissue changes in humans as well as in
animals, in normal life or under laboratory con-
ditions, subjected to various types, duration and
intensity of exposure to various tobaccos and
derivatives, and other potential irritants. Tissues
of special interest. are those of the mouth, lungs,
glands, heart and other organs of subjects of
various ages, sex and strains.

"3. Smoking and other tobacco habits, and
the emotional and physical makeup of smokers,
with respect to establishment, duration and in-
tensity of tobacco use, and correlation of these
data with metabolic, glandular and ‘nervous
types under various degrees of stress and chal-
lenges.”

One need not be at all astute to recognize the
import of establishing these “areas of investigation.”
It is to stave off as long as possible recognition and
action upon the fact that tobacco contains ingred-
ients which cause lung cancer.

After the excursion into tobacco and cancer .stu—
dies, let’s read the announcement of the California
State Department of Public Health, which reﬂects
its attitude toward defumigating our poisoned at-
mosphere.

INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM
(DEPT. OF HEALTH)

“Effective control of smog is not now possi-
ble because of a lack of fundamental informa-
tion. Before realistic and truly effective smog
control methods can be fashioned, we must:

"1. Identify compounds that causetypical
smog conditions.

“2. Extend scientiﬁc studies to determine
the nature of reactions taking place in the at-
mosphere, the substances entering into these
reactions, and the compounds formed.

"3. Learn more about the adverse effects of

29

air pollution on humans and identify the spe-
cial substances responsible.
“4.. Devise reliable and practical means for
measuring air contaminants. -
“6. Developipractical and effective means 0
controlling certain emissions.”
It is one thing for the tobacco industries to take

to cover behind a “Scientiﬁc Advisory Board.” It

is quite another for the State of California Depart— V

ment of Public Health to go in for such shenanigans.

Yet such are the timorous, quaking natures of
those in supposed positions of responsibility and trust.
These are members of the department which holds
one of its functions to be “providing leadership‘ to
local communities in public health matters.”

And this is the department to which, in their fren-
zied buck passing, our local politicians would toss
the hot potato referred to as “doing something
about smog.”

CALLED A “PROGRESS REPORT”

Here are more heroic objectives of the State Health
Department, quoted from their last “progress re-
port.” -
"To continually review research in health

effects . .. . to analyze mortality among popula-

tions . . . to analyze morbidity in exposed pop-
ulations through surveys . . . to maintain sur-
veillance of the effects of air pollution through
studying (a) the eﬂect of air pollution on the
patterns of day-to—day borne, recreation and
work activities, as well as on (b) the deaths and
transfers—to-hospitals among patients in nurs-

ing homes.” (Italics furnished). ,

But something new has been added! Those who
should be attacking a health problem aggressively
and realistically in this sickened State have added
another category of questions to their surveys:

“DID YOU HAVE A
‘SMOGGY’ CHILDHOOD?”

"Special questions to measure the trend in
people’s attitudes toward air pollution were in-
cluded in the California supplement to the Na-
tional Health Survey schedule during April -
June, 1958. vThese data are now being coded
and machine processed, Speciﬁcations for ma-
chine tabulations and analysis plans are being
developed. These plans will include a comparison
between the low, medium and high smog areas
within Los Angeles County, as well as a com-
parison be-tween the major metropolitan areas,

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

other urban areas and rural areas of the State.
For the first time attitudinal measures of smog
effects will be related to selected disease condi-
tions of varying degrees of severity, by sex and
age and degree of urbanization.”

Were you sort of curious to know what the‘ De-
partment of Public Health planned to do with that
$750,000 it requested?

“PM CONDUCTING A SURVEY”

Next “smoggy” day you might have a knock on
your oor.

"Excuse me, Madame, but I’m conducting a sur-
vey for the State Health Department. It’s noted
here that you live in an area which our engineers
and statisticians have classiﬁed as in the transitional
zone between medium and high smog areas. We’d
like to know your attitude toward smog. Now, on
these forms which the State of California Public
Health Service has published, you’ll see that 10.0
represents a state we call ‘desperation’ and 1.0 re-
presents ‘complete indifference.’ Of course, your own
attitude is certainly somewhere in-between those
states. And here are questions for you to answer as
to the recreational activities of your family com-
pared with the day’s ozone reading.” ‘

LESS TARS IN OUR “SMOG”

Why, pretty soon we’ll be seeing paid testimonials.

"I’m Mrs. of Los Angeles. All I want to say
is that never in my life have I felt so well as»I have
since moving to dear old smoggy Los Angeles. Why,
I wouldn’t change the smog in Los Angeles for any-
thing. My husband likes it, too. And, as for my
children. They thrive on it!”

Anyone know of a good ﬁlter-tip gas mask?

SMOG AS KILLER STILL
UNPROVED, EXPERTS SAY

PANEL TELLS MEMBERS OF CANCER SOCIETY
THERE’S NO EVIDENCE OF POLLUTION DEATHS

Air Pollution is a source of bother to three-fourths
of the people in Los Angeles, is responsible for mil-
lions of dollars of crop damage, and is an aggrava-
tor of many chronic diseases, but it has never been
proved a killer of humans.

This is a summary of a discussion by four experts.

ARE THESE OUR DOCTORS?
ARE THESE OUR SCIENTISTS?

A cruel misconception has been allowed to ﬂour-
ish in the lay mind by those who have technical
knowledge in the ﬁeld of air poisons. That is the
notion that “smog” is some elusive element which
must be ﬁrst identiﬁed, isolated, and then ways
studied of extracting it from the atmosphere. The
“smog problem” is even compared to the dramatic
and ceaseless toil which accompanied the seeking out
of -the causative agents of yellow fever, malaria, tu-
berculosis, poliomyelitis.

Even writers who vigorously protest the obvious
do-nothing program of the “smog control” bureau-
cracy entertain the illusion innocently. Here is a
fragment taken from a Los Angeles periodical: “If,
after countless experiments, something that consti-
tutes smog could be identified as the chief villain,
then the battle could be concentrated in one direc-
tion: eliminating the factors that make up that
element.”

THAT MYSTERY ELEMENT AGAIN

That ﬁnding a rare element “that constitutes
smog” could be the popular impression of a mode of
attack is excusable. For “scientists” and "M.D.s” to
allow this notion to be given credence is arrant
mischief.

The chemistry of the atmosphere is known. The
chemistry of toxic gases and substances at present
contaminating the Southern California area is also
known. AND THE MEANS OF REMEDY ARE
THIS MOMENT AT HAND, AND HAVE
BEEN FOR YEARS!

In Southern California there are innumerable per-
sons who have been advised by their family phy-
sicians to leave the area because of “smog.” In Pasa-
dena, where gaseous fumes become impacted against
the once blue mountains, such cases are common.
Certainly, not now do the sun, the orange orchards,
the mountains, desert and palm trees beckon to the
weak and wan.

MAY WE QUOTE YOU?

Strangely enough, it is impossible to find an M.D.
on the “medical scientiﬁc” group paid by A.P.C.D.
who will admit that “smog” is anything but a "nui-
sance,” and this refusal even to intimate its hazards
extends to doctors holding jobs in the State Depart-

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

ment of Public Health, and to those representing
medical organizations. S

In the whole confounding picture nothing is so
macabre as knowing persons who have been told to
get out, and knowing that at least half the physi-
cians in Los Angeles are on record as having said that
they have recommended to certain of their patients
to leave on account of “smog,” and then meeting
this bland evasion.

THE DOCTOR-IN DUS TRY
RELATIONSHIP

Industrial physicians admit that eventually in their.

work their real “patient” becomes the company or
industry which pays them. So many times they have
had to represent the company in damage suits brought
by employees, that they gradually come to associate
themselves with the companies and industries.
Must this also be true of doctors, men associated
in most minds with the family minister, the conﬁ-
dant and helper in time of trouble? Once they be-
come subsidized to pursue an “investigation,” do
they become mere hirelings? I
Doctors in government oﬂicialdom pussyfoot
around the basic issue. They insist that the compo-
nents of “smog” must be “identified completely,”"‘
and that experiments covering several years must
take place before the situation can be remedied.
Doctors have studied basic chemistry. The layman
may visualize the “smog battle” as looking about

for a "Mystery Element,” but doctors knownbetter.

Will doctors, too, become members of the Legion of
Frightened “Men?

“WELL, IT CERTAINLY
ISN’T GOOD FOR YOU”

I asked a doctor, conducting a “medical experi-
ment” for A.P.C.,D’., "Surely it must be bad for a
person having to breathe all this gunk?”

“You can’t prove it! Anyhow, it’s possible for
persons to live with just one lung left.”

So he can, doctor. He can live with a kidney re-
moved, and with a heart containing a plastic gadget.
He can use clever mechanical devices to take the

place of missing limbs. He lives, doctor, — but not:

so well.

I called up the president of a medical association.
This was in September of 1958. Is "smog” bad for
people?

31

“I’m against it‘ . . . It’s a public nuisance.”

‘‘Isn’t it a health hazard, doctor?”

“No, it’s not a heal-th hazard, not now.”

"Wouldn’t you ever think of it in the same status
as a polluted stream in a typhoid problem?”

"NO! Typhoid fever is a disease. We have no evi-

dence that smog causes disease_. It causes only minor

symptoms, some eye irritation, that’s all. People live
just as long here as they do anywhere else.”
"When you have a certain number of known tox-
ic gases in the air, doctor . . .”
“What has that got to do with the medical pro-
fession? 'Smog’ is a nuisance and I’m against it.”

BILL OF PARTICULARS,
VERSUS SCIENTISTS VERSUS

‘DOCTORS ET AL, ET AL. . . .

Instead of merely recounting these sorry episodes,
let’s make up a bill of particulars against the much
touted "Medical Scientiﬁc Committee.”

1. Under the aegis “protecting the public health”
they allow a false sense of security to be engendered
in the community by the program of “Smog Alerts.”

They are responsible for the impression current,
that rescue from the hazard of poisoned air is sim-
ilar to rescue from the ledge of a cliff — dramatic
but_ possible. They allow the impression to be created
that it is within the power of the A.P.C.D. to stave
off a possible calamity. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. _

It will be possible to be driving a car, running
heavy» diesel equipment, and letting the reﬁneries
go full blast, while the concentration of ozone in
the atmosphere is 0.95 ppm-. This is still within the
First Alert stage, the effect of which is mere legal
notiﬁcation.

Should the ozone level reach 1.0 ppm, authority
exists to stop all automobile trafﬁc, order indus-
tries to shut down, and the reﬁneries to close down
their equipment. (Does anyone care to visualize
some of the scenes along our freeways on a hot, smog-
gy day when all trafﬁc could be ordered stopped?
“But all you’d have to do is to go into a drug store
and wait for it to be over.” This was the statement
made to me by one of the most illustrious scientists

*~ Words of Surgeon Genl., U.S.A.

    

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

on the “scientiﬁc” team. HINT: Keep close to an
air-cooled movie house.)

THIS IS VILLAINY

In such a situation it ‘is. possible to see that there
would be thousands of casualties from hysteria and
panic alone. It’s anticipated that the 1.0 or more
ppm ozone would not last a long time. When it has
subsided to 0.98 ppm, off we go, merrily as before!
This is villainy.

2. Those on the “scientific team” permit their
names and the prestige of their positions to give luster
to an organization whose attainments are meritorious
— only in the ﬁeld of propaganda techniques.

3. Those who are "scientiﬁc consultants,” by their
silence and refusal to repudiate their connection with
the organization, permit A.P.C.D. to oversee a mask-
ed program of “research” which heightens the illu-
sion among the population that “something is being
done,” and that the problem is one which actually
requires research. A spinach crop may be salvaged
by spraying with Vitamin C, but this can’t be ex-
trapolated to the human population.

Doctors have become pusillanimous. They have
allowed a pseudo-language to develop. Eye damage
is termed "eye irritation”; “slight cough” covers
cases of chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema;
“chest pain” for heart and lung impairment.

Those who are “scientific consultants” surely know
that cancer is a disease which may develop very
slowly, even taking ﬁfteen to twenty years. Cancer
takes far’ longer to develop than the life spans of
many mice. Knowing this — and aware that the
layman does not — they permit short-term experi-

‘ ments on mice to pass‘as “research.”

“YOU CAN’T PROVE IT I
SO THERE!”

4. For the mere sake of publicity (what other
possible emolument?) members of the medical pro-
fession have allowed themselves to give “testimon-
ials” for A.P.C.D.’s propaganda line, “You can’t
prove it . . . You can’t prove it . . .” It is also the
propaganda line of the California State Department
of Public Health.

5. “The cruelest lies are often told in silence.” The
physician holds a position of privilege in the com-
munity, because worthy forebears of his so endowed
the profession. The layman wants to believe that
the physician’s fealty to mankind is ancient.

"Where the love of man is
There also, is the love of this Art.”

32

''LIFE IS SHQRT.
ART IS LONG"

Research, the magic ‘word! Research involving

the effects of air pollution on‘ human beings is di—

vided into two categories by the California State
Department of Public Health.

"1. Laboratory and clinical experimentation
to determine the speciﬁc effect(s) of individ-
ual contaminants or groups of contaminants
on animal or human tissues.

"2. Epidemiological studies involving the
analysis and interpretation of mortality and
morbidity statistics in relationship to the oc-
curence of air pollution episodes etc.”

As for the epidemiological studies, we_ have
seen such outrageous abuse toward data on mortality
and morbidity collected by the DPH that it should
not deserve the name "scientiﬁc.” We have seen
that the State of California Department of Pub-
lic Health is so arrogant it can “decline” to publish
— do they seem to think it insigniﬁcant? — data
to the effect that 1114 excess deaths occurred during
one smog episode in Los Angeles.

Of what practical use is it to have such “studies”
continued? In a court of law the jury has the priv-

ilege of dismissing altogether the testimony of a

witness‘who has been tripped up in just a couple
of falsehoods.

IS RESEARCH THE ANSWER?

And THIS is most important. In the report of
the Interim Committee’s sessions on public health,
there is the following:

“When asked what success could be expected
from the medical research projects in the ﬁeld
of air pollution, Dr. , a member of the Los
Angeles County Air Pollution Control District’s
Scientiﬁc Committee, responded as follows:

EXHIBIT ‘A’ —
MEDICAL PROPAGANDA

"We have no guarantee, except past experi-
ence with other types of research. There are
a -number of medical problems which, when I
was in medical school, had no solution . . .

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

“For instance, about all we knew about po-
liomyelitis when I was a medical student was
that it was caused by a virus which attacked
certain parts of the central nervous system,
period! . . .

"Now, most of this knowledge has developed
since the Foundation of Infantile Paralysis was
organized, not very_many years ago. It has cost
quite a number of millions of dollars, and many
people working, but something really worth-
while has been accomplished in the ﬁeld of po-
liomyelitis. _

“The congenital heart disease, the valvular
and other structural defects in the heart, when
I was a medical student were just interesting
things from the medical point of view, and
something to arouse your sympathy for the
child and the families, but you could do no-
hing about it. You just waited for the child to
die. Today we can operate upon many of these
defects, correct them, and give the child a
chance for a normal life.

VITAMINS, HORMONES, “SMOG”

“This has come about through research in my
day, in my professional day.

“The matter of vitamins and their relation
to nutritional disease, almost all of it developed
since I was a medical student.

“And the same with most of the hormones.
Insulin was discovered while I was in medical
school. . . It took 25 years of the present cen-
tury before insulin‘ was actually brought to any
state of perfection,_ and it is still being im-
proved . . .

"The point is that there are numerous in-
stances in recent medical history where condi-
tions that were not understood or not respon-
sive to therapy a few years ago, are now under
control, or actually being eliminated. Many in-
fectious diseases are almost a thing of the past.

“The medical student today rarely sees ty-
phoid or diphtheria or smallpox. These all have
disappeared in this century.

“So I am just as conﬁdent as I can be of any-
thing in the future, that the type of research
that is being initiated in the air pollution con-
trol district here, and similar studies elsewhere,
the type of thing Dr. Kotin, Dr. Motley, Dr.
Bryan, and many others, are doing in the bio-
logical ﬁeld, will within a very few years bring
us results which will make it possible for us

33

to protect the citizenry against this thing which
we now call smog.”

Rx MEDICAL PR

If this statement by a physician represented mere
ineptitude, one could grieve, and be tolerant. How-
ever, it must be c'onsidered for what it is, one of
the most subtly engineered of medical-public rela-
tions pieces. It has everything.

There is the optimistic import of a doctor mak-
ing references to medical accomplishments of re-
cent decades, the implication that the nature of
the hazard in “smog” is comparable. There is the
reminder that years, money, and more money are
necessary to relieve the smog-racked.

LET APOLLO WEEPI

The gorgeous banners of medical history are un-
furled, the triumph over polio, the discovery of in-

sulin, the hormones, the battle to end epidemics of

smallpox and diphtheria -— what person can listen
to the panegyric without having his emotions a-
roused? And then there is slipped in the punch line,
the commercial, the dirty jingle. Would that the
ghosts of Ehrlich, Pasteur, Koch, Jenner, Virchow,
Semmelweiss, Paracelsus, and their legion, could be
assembled for retribution!

BETTER GAS MASK

HINT TO "Scientists”: There will never be a
brilliant discovery which will “protect the citizen-
ry” from lung-invading poisons (even though the
citizenry were to contribute every dime in its pos-
session to the “struggle.”) The only "discovery”
will be an improvement in the style of gas mask.

The author of the statement quoted at usch length
is "research chief” of a medical research foundation
in one of the Los Angeles environs. (The foundation
remains just a bit evasive about the exact source of
its operating funds.)

Only recently D'r.. _ was granted $25,000 by
the Tuberculosis Association to make a study to de-
termine whether poison gases (“smog”) make a
person more susceptible to tuberculosis. That sum
of money should certainly buy a lot of mice. It is
hoped, however, that the $25,000 does not represent
the crumpled dollar bills of many thousands of do-
nations, those sent in by people for the purchase
of Christmas seals, hoping they are “doing some-

thing for a good cause.” It is hoped rather that the

LET'S TAKE IT TO COURT!

"No state legislature can bargain away tbe public
bealtb-or tbe public morals.” (U. S. Supreme Court)

Government makes use of its police power in en-
acting laws to protect the health, morals, comfort
and general welfare of the people. Salus populi su-
prema lex.
ancient Rome, when the sovereign had the duty of

safeguarding citizens against disease and crime. The-

use of police power implies that individual liberty
and property rights are subordinate to the common
good. Police power “rests upon the fundamental
principle that everyone shall so use his own, as not to
wrong or injure another.”

Anglo-Saxon principles of justice, embodied in
the common law, are our legal inheritance as Amer-
icans. These principles survived over the centuries
despite wars, plagues, famine, and the abuse of
monarchs.

DRAWN AND QUARTERED?

To the smog-racked it must come as a surprise to

“LIFE IS Sil-lORT,— (Continued from Page'33)

$25,000 was contributed by a single industry, which
asked that the money be earmarked for “research”
at the foundation so splendidly named. Magic words
when you utter them, Doctor, “They’re doing a lot
of research on that.” The effect is like a sedative.

Here, too, we don’t have to be wearing a stetho-
scope around out necks to ﬁgure things out.

HINT TO RESEARCH MEN: Any injury to the
lungs, or impaired functioning of the lungs, ren-
ders the patient more susceptible to infectious lung
disease. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease. Ergo. , .
Spare those mice, Doctor!

An example of the increased susceptibility to tu-
berculosis from impaired lungs is found in victims
of silicosis. This disease results from the inhaling
of extremely ﬁne particles of silica dust producing
a condition known as pulmonary ﬁbrosis. When stu-
dies have been made among humans, those persons
exposed to silica dust in their work have been found
to be tbree to ten times more susceptible to tuber-
culosis, tbau tbose not so exposed.

The “research” so grandly undertaken at the me-
dical foundation described above is not research
but occupational therapy.

The doctrine was recognized even in.

34-

know that even in the 13th century the right of

humans to breathe clean air was considered para-
mount. In 1307 one whotransgressed the smoke-
abatement law was executed!

In reading decisions, based upon age—old prin-
ciples, one is inspired by the clear unequivocal lan-
guage delineating the rights of humankind. When
there was risk of hurt or even inconvenience to man,
no compromise was in order.

In the early cases “dense smoke” was considered
a nuisance, and a source of injury to others. There
was then no knowledge relating “dense smoke” to
poison gases, poison particles, cancer, shortened life
span, and a more wretched existence. The court
“took judicial notice” that contaminated air was
harmful, and no recourse was needed to a bevy of
experts demanding years of research and money to
verify just how bad the stuff really was.

It is not within the capacity of this writer to trace
these court decisions over the years and discover at
just what point the road forked. For certain it did.
The courts of today do not give legal redress to
sickened citizens which they once did.

That noble personification of Justice would seem
to have become intimidated; the balance held up for
all to see would seem to have a faulty mechanism.

FREEDOM TO FUME

The following are random excerpts from court de-
cisions rendered in the field of air pollution:

In 1907 an industry brought suit against Indian-
apolis, arguing that the city’s smoke-abatement or-
dinance denied the industry its “freedom”. The
court upheld the city ordinance.

“The emission‘of dense, black . . . smoke from any
smokestack .. . . except as a private residence, shall
be deemed and is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance.”

“The question we have to deal with is . . . the
right to prevent the emission of dense smoke within
the corporate limits of a populous city, wherein (if
there be no regulations) the smoke from scores of
steam plants must often "cover the city as with a
pall, THEREBY IMPAIRING THE HEALTH
AND COMFORT OF THOUSANDS, AND CAST-
ING GRIME UPON EVERY EXPOSED OBJECT.
IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE PRINCIPLE
OF THE GREATEST GOOD OF THE GREAT-
EST NUMBER, OR IN THE DECLARED AU-
THORITY OF GOVERNMENT REASONABLY
TO REGULATE THE USE OF PROPERTY FOR
THE COMMON GOOD, IT MUST BE AFFIRMED

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

THAT POWER EXISTS TO DEAL WITH A
CONDITION WHICH RENDERS LIFE IN A
GREAT MANUFACTURING CITY LITTLE
SHORT OF IMPOSSIBLE.”

EVERYBODY KNOWS IT

In 1904 a manufacturing plant in Missouri
brought a case to court, arguing a city ordinance
against fumes was invalid. Here’s a fragment of
the decision rendered: ’

" . . . the Legislature has the power to declare
places or ‘practices to the detriment , . . or injury of
the health, morals, or ‘welfare of the community,
public nuisances . . . Even at common law smoke
alone in certain circumstances constituted a nuis-
ance; when it produced a tangible injury to prop-
erty as by the discoloration of buildings, injury to
vegetation, the discoloration of furniture, and like

cases.”

“(It is) KNOWN TO ALL MEN,
THAT THE EMISSION AND DIS-
CHARGE OF DENSE SMOKE INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE OF A LARGE
AND POPULOUS ‘CITY IS OF ITSELF
A NUISANCE . . . AND CALCULATED
TO INTERFERE WITH THE HEALTH
AND ‘COMFORT OF THE INHABIT-

ANTS . . . ”
HUMAN WELFARE FIRST

Over 50 years ago a principle of law was written
into the decision of People 1/, Detroit White Lead
Works, 82 Mich. 471, 46.

" . . . whenever a business becomes a nuisance, it
must give way to the rights of the public, and the
owners theereof must either devise some means to
avoid the nuisance or must remove or cease the
business, even THOUGH THE BUSINESS IS CAR-
RIED ON IN A CAREFUL MANNER, AND
NOTHING IS DONE WIIICH IS NOT A REA-
SONABLE AND NECESSARY INCIDENT TO
THE BUSINESS. . . ”

In plain words the judge said: “Were sorry if you

/have to close shop and leave town, but human wel-_

fare in the first order of business here.” There seerned
to be no murky grey zone when it came to a declar-
ation on the rights’ of human beings to breathe un-
fouled air.

In 1907 in Des Moines, Iowa, a laundry filed suit
against the city arguing that its smoke-abatement

35

law was an infringement upon constitutional free-
dom.

The judge said:

“The state . . . or a county may declare dense
smoke a nuisance and subject to restraint as such:

THE HARSHNESS OF SUCH LEGIS-
LATION, ’OR' ITS‘ EFFECT UPON
BUSINESS INTERESTS, ARE NOT
VALID CONSTITUTIONAL OBJEC-
TIONS. Nor is there valid federal con.

stitutional objection that the regulation require the
discontinuance of the use of property, or subject the
occupant to large expense in complying with the
law.”

From a 1949 Tennessee decision:

“Ordinances to preserve the pblic health . . . have
gone to great length in enumerating the implied
powers of municipalities to enact laws to protect
the community from infectious and contagious dis-
eases, from bad water, against nuisances injurious
to health, and noxious odors and gases.

“INASMUCH As THE PROVISION
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE
SAFETY OF THE INHABITANTS IS
ONE OF THE CHIEF PURPOSES OF
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, ALL REA-
SONABLE ORDINANCES IN THIs
DIRECTION HAVE BEEN sus-
TAINED,”

ONE .NIGHT’S SLEEP

In 1950 a New York court, ruling that a smoke-
abatement ordinance was “not unreasonable” said:

“At common law, an action of nuisance will lie
for substantial discomfort or inconvenience . . .
according to plain and sober and simple notions
among the English People . . . THE COMMON
LAW JUDGES BY NO SPARTAN STANDARDS.
THE LOSS OF EVEN ONE NIGHT’S SLEEP IS
NOT DEEMED A TRIVIAL MATTER . . . And
it may be added that the complexities of our mod-
ern society, due in large part to congestion of pop-
ulation and concentration of industry and business

IMPOSE AN EVER INCREASING DEMAND FOR-

INIVIDUAL CONCESSIONS TO THE COM-
MON GOOD .. . 3’

Here are refreshing words (1907) of Mr Justice
Holmes of 11 United States Supreme Court decision:

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

STATE HAS THE POWER

“The state has an interest in all the earth and air
within its domain. It has the last word as to Wheth-
er its mountains shall be stripped of their forests
and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air . . . ”

At the turn of the century these principles had
been established by the courts:

(1) The legislature of a state can declare air
poisons a public nuisance and use police action
against industries which emit them.

(2) Such a state law to protect human Welfare
would be upheld by the courts.

(3): The state legislature can delegate to a county
or to a city the power to enact ordinances for remov-
ing air poisons; this is part of its recognized police
power inherent in any government.

(4) Dense smoke and gases_ were considered a
nuisance, and "harmful to health “as a matter of
common knowledge.” (No expert scientific testi-
mony needed!)

LET'S BE REASONABLE
son" COAL IS CHEAPER

Does it not seem, however,—the layman might
ask——that legislation governing the fuels used by in-
dustries should be reasonable?

In a district where soft coal is plentiful, is it not
unreasonable to enforce a law requiring industry to
use expensive anthracite coal or a smokeless fuel?

Wouldn’t this cause great hardship? What if it
drove some of the industries from the city?

Answering just such questions, the Supreme Conrt
of Illinois said as follows:

“It may be that some, and perhaps, very great in-
convenience would be experienced by a rigid enforce-
ment of the provisions of this ordinance. How that
may be this court cannot know. What powers the
city council may exercise under the general law or
under its police powers is a question of law to be de-
termined by the courts; but when the city council
will exercise the powers with which it is clothed
rests in its legislative discretion, and the consequences
that may flow from the enforcement of ordinances
enacted within the powers conferred, rests alone upon
the body enacting them, and with which the courts
have no concern.”

JUST DISCOMFORT

Earlier decisions (before ‘ the symbol of Justice
began to tremble slightly) held it was not even
necessary to prove impairment to health, to declare
smoke and fumes a nuisance.

"Discomfort, inconvenience and annoyance to the
public is sufficient, and impairment to health is not
necessary to render the emission of smoke and fumes
a nuisance . . . ” (a Los Angeles Superior Court in
1910).

“ . . . any use of one’s property, ordinarily lawful,
may become a nuisance, not only wben it produces
injury to public health, safety and morals, but also
when it occasions public inconvenience, or materially
impairs the public comfort . . .. ‘the physical comfort

)3)

of human existence .

THIS WAS LOS ANGELESI (I910)

Toughened ”smog” veterans of Los Angeles will
ﬁnd this case really droll. In 1910 a houseowner
near the Arroyo Seco in Los Angeles brought suit
against the Los Angeles Suburban Gas Company, be-
cause the smoke, odor, and noise of the plant inter-
ferred with the “comfortable” enjoyment of plaintiff’s
property.”

The plaintiff brought forth no evidence that his
health or that of his family had been affected. But
he complained that the smoke was so thick it even
obstructed the landscape; it had a penetrating odor;

at times it even smelled like a London fog!

This plaintiff was awarded damages for "annoy-
ance and ‘inconvenience suffered."

The Court said:

“ . . . it is not necessary that the health of plaintiff
or members of his household should have been im-
paired. It is sufficient if the odors, sounds, and
smoke were offensive to the senses. (Yes, this was
Los Angeles, 1910).

6,000,000 PLAINTIFFS

A 1925 California case:

“It was not necessary to the recovery of damages
caused by the nuisance of smoke and soot to prove
actual damage to plaintiff’s property. She was en-
titled to recover for the PERSONAL, DISCOM-
FORT AND ANNOYANCE TQ WHICH SHE
HAD BEEN SUBJECTED. . . if

does not possess the power of eminent domain.
“Thus one who coveted his. neighbors proper-
ty could force a sale of it by the simple ex-
pedient of injuring such property, of impair-
ing the enjoyment thereof and cause the
owner to sell or forego all right to damages
. . . This of course cannot be the law.”

(A California decision)

LET'S BE REASONABLE (Continued from Page '36)

that when air is laden with a heavy cloud of smoke

and dust such a condition constitutes a nuisance and

is detrimental to the health and safety of the public.
When therefore the legislature confers upon a mu-
nicipality authority to safeguard public health, it’s
wholly unnecessary that the charter go further and
declare smoke and dust are detrimental to health.
EVERYBODY-KNOWS THAT IT IS,. . . ”

And a New York case:

"Dense smoke a carrier as it is of dust, soot and
cinders, contaminates and pollutes the atmosphere
and deteriorates its normal healthful attributes and
qualities, and therefore cannot but be harmful to the
public health, especially in populous areas. THIS
IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE.”

ARE THESE
OUR POLITICIANS?

Poisons in the air over our cities represent a clear
and present danger to the human population, some-
what more insidious than the massing of enemy
troops at a border.

The sources of the poison are known. The know-

ledge and wherewithal for removing the poisons are
at hand, and have been for years,

In order to clean up, it will be necessary to have
public oﬂicials with suﬂicient courage to make moral
choices. The question posed is a simple one: Do hu-
man rights supersede‘ property rights? To answer
the question in the affirmative is to hold to a legal and
moral principle which was established even before
our republic was created.

To answer the question in the negative is all
right, too. After all, nihilism is a recognized philos-
ophy. Yet, if we subscribe tojthe thesis that human
‘welfare is relatively unimportant, we must abide by
certain corollaries of that decision.

PLEASE, YOU CAN HAVE
MY CIVIL RIGHTS

We should be explicit and admit that such a
phrase as “life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness” is an American archaism.

We should withdraw with dignity from any “hu-
man rights” committee of such organizations as the
United Nations.

We should not be ridiculous about this thing call-
ed “civil rights.” The mere existence of a “civil
rights” committee can only be thought of as ma-
cabre humor. (Somebody should devise an appro-
priate cartoon for the caption: “You got the vote,
didn’t ya? Whatcha complainin’ about, just that
ya can’t breathe?”)

Since human life is relatively unimportant, we
should not squander billions of dollars on "charity
drives” which serve to prolong the lives of those
in whom the breath of life but ﬂickers.

LEGION OF
FRIGHTENED MEN

Interposed between ourselves and our certain
peril is a legion of frightened men. They are, for
the most part, those whom we have elected to public

ofﬁce and their appointees. When they have even

THE "SMOG" CHAIRMAN

"When a man assumes a — public trust, he

should consider himself as public property.”

Supervisor Warren M. Dorn, Smog Chairman for
the Board of Supervisors, has always been forth-
right" about admitting he was elected supervisor be-
cause he planned to “do something about smog.”
That was, let’s see, in 1956.

STATE LAWS SOUGHT ON
SMOG-CONTROL DEVICE

New State laws which would give powers to the
State Director of Public Health to halt the sale of
automobiles unable to meet smog-emission standards
will be sought by the county at the State Legisla-
ture next month. '

The Board of Supervisors
voted unanimously Tuesday to
campaign for the new control
laws after Supervisor Warren
M. Dorn had declared that the
lack of jurisdiction of State
health authorities "is a major
loophole in our air pollution
control program.”

TEST OF GASES

The proposed new legisla-
tion would call for examina-
tion of all automobiles, new or
used, being oﬂered for sale to
determine whether exhaust gases
contain ingredients that would
endanger public health.

Dorn said that the State
Health Department al r e a d y
possesses the scientiﬁc appara-
tus and know-how to make the
plan work.

“If this is put into effect,”
Dorn went on, “the State health
authorities could ﬁx maximum
standard for tail-pipe emissions
that would protect citizens
throughout smog-infested sec-
tions all over California.”

Dorn estimated that, with
enactment of the new controls,
much of the smog arising from
motor vehicles could be elim-
inated within about three years.

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGBLES

"If this is put into effect,”
D‘orn went on, “the State health
authorities could ﬁx maximum
standards for tailpipe emissions’
that would protect citizens
throughout the smog-infested
sections all over California.” I

Dorn ,estimated that, with
enactment of the new controls,
much of the smog arising from
motor vehicles could be elimin-
ated within about three years.

CAN WE ASK YOU SOME
QUESTIONS, MR. DORNP

After reading this item in the Times, which em-
anated from his oﬂice, we’d like to ask him some
questions:

What are the functions of the Board of Super-
visors? Many folks think the Board of Supervisors
governs the County of Los Angeles.

To say that the lack of jurisdiction of State health
authorities “is a major loophole in our air pollu-
tin control program,” might make some think a
bureau in Sacramento is responsible for the present
crisis in Los Angeles County

Mr. Dorn, who in this county is responsible for
enacting legislation to regulate air pollution at its
source? Don’t you think people should know the
Board of Spervisors now has, and always has had,
such authority? »

“The proposed new legisla-
tion would call for examination
of all automobiles, new or used,
being offered for sale to deter-
mine whether exhaust gases
contain ingredients that would
endanger public health.

ARE THESE OUR POLITICIANS? (Continued from page 37)

glimpsed the enemy, they have fallen back in dis-
may, like the most callow of recruits. To give them-
selves more courage, and to pretend at least to be
waging a purposive campaign, they make noisy skir-
mishes into the ﬁelds of propaganda, false issues,
devious misrepresentation.

Our only hope is that by the force of public in-
dignation we can remind this legion of frightened
men, our elected representatives, that the moral
choice is still to be made.

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

Could this be a newspaper oversight? The state-
ment implies that it is not now known whether “ex-

haust gases contain ingredients that would endanger
public health.”

YOU MEAN IT?

Mr. Dorn, if you were to go out to your garage,
close the door, start the motor of. your automobile,
within minutes you —would succumb to just one of
the poisons in exhaust emissions, carbon monoxide.

Assuming there wer no carbon monoxide in the
exhaust, you could — but it would take a few hours
——ﬁnally die of pulmonary. edema, caused by the
presence of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust.

Assuming neither carbon monoxide nor nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust, you would soon feel very
sick, because every minute the exhaust gas, con-
taining hardly any oxygen and too much carbon
monoxide, is displacing the available oxygen in the
air.

Whether you’d ﬁnally die of asphyxiation, we
don’t know. Anyhow, the motor of your‘ car would
ﬁnally conk out, because it needs oxygen to run on.

ONE BIG GARAGE

On days of low temperature inversion, millions
ofipersons in Los Angeles County are in a garage,
surely the world’s most commodious, but a garage
nonetheless. Into this garage are even being piped
the “exhausts,” by the thousands of tons, of the in-
dustries and reﬁneries which make this county
wealthy.

“ ‘I f this is put into effect,’
Dorn went on, ‘the State health
authorities could ﬁx maximum
standards for tailpipe emissions
that would protect citizens
throughout the smog -i nfested
sections all over California’!”

Thank you for protecting us, Mr. Dorn. We’re
just 6 million, and we don’t want to die. Thank the
other members of the Board of Supervisors who
voted unanimously on this proposal “to protect

the health of the people.”

Dorn estimated that with en-
actment of the new controls,
much of the smog arising from
motor vehicles. could be elimin-
ated within about three years.”

39

We understand this to mean that (1) with the
help of a device which does not now exist; and
(2) giving the state legislature a job which the
best chemists in the country would be unable .to do,
THEN the automobile will no longer be the leading
source of smog. Our enthusiasm remains in check.

The date of this news item is December 4, 1958.
Is it your reasoned judgment that the population
of Los Angeles could go through another seige like
that in September, October, November, and Decem-
ber of 1958?

With evidence linking “smog” to respiratory ill-
ness, shortened life span, cancer, general ill health
and debility, can you answer, “Yes”?

POLITICS 8’ PRESS AGENTS

Although he may not have the right “device” to
stick on tailpipes, Mr. Dorn does have a ﬁne Press

Agent. The press coverage onthe occasion of his-

recent trip to Washington to “do something about
smog” was spectacular. Nearly every newspaper
reader in Los Angeles has seen the’ picture of Super-
visor Dorn spurning the gift of cocktail glasses prof-
fered by an oil company to each member of the
Board. Readers know now that 'that’s one public
official who’ll never be deﬂected from his purpose
of “protecting the health of the people..”

Mr. Dorn’s Press Agent is better known as his
“smog aide” (but gets paid as an Administrative
Assistant). However, he knows very little about
“smog” except that “doing something” about it is
good politics and good public relations. We know
members of elective oﬁices are not supposed to re-
tain Press Agents paid from County funds. Onthe
other hand, the man is an ex-reporter, columnist,
and managing editor of the Pasadena Independent
and does an A-1 publicity job.

WHAT DOES MR. DORN THINK?

Anyhow, we asked Supervisor Dorn’s Press Agent
a couple of questions and got revealing answers:

Question: What are the noxious things in gasoline
that Mr. D'orn thinks should be removed?

Answer:
ferring the matter to the State Department
of Public Health.

And Another Question: How aggravated would
the “smog” situation have to be before Mr.
Dorn would-be in favor of such measures
as asking‘ the reﬁneries to take a "holiday”
and regulating’ automobile use — perhaps

He doesn’t know. 'That’s why he’s re-I

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

putting automobiles on a “necessity only”
basis.

Answer: Keep people from using their automo-
biles? Mr. Dorn knows the people would
never stand for that!

“THE PEOPLE” AND MR. DORN

Are you in accord, Mr. Dorn? Do you think
“The People” would -go into one awful pout if re-

quired to keep their cars in the garage for a whole,

week at a time? (No one complains because ﬁre-
works — although beautiful — cannot be sold in
the county.)

We havesingularconﬁdence in the willi"ngness’of
Americans to make sacrifices — certainly when the
'‘sacrifice’’ amounts merely to slowing down, at cer-
tain times, on the use of a luxury appliance.

Perhaps some of the talents of the publicists on
the “doing something ‘about smog” detail could be
diverted to giving the known, unglossed, facts re-
lating to air poisons, including those contributed
by automobile exhausts. That would be one inform-
ation c‘ampaign certainly in the public interest, and
could even justify expenditure of taxpayers’ money.

Is there just the smidgen of a possibility “(and We
blush at the insinuation), that rather than the sen-
sibilities of “The People” the economic interests in-
extricably linked with the use of 3 million auto-
mobiles are Mr. Dorn’s concern?

OR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY

The money represented by these automobiles is
nothing compared with the businesses and industries
which service car-owners directly and indirectly.

If automobile use were ever restricted during a bad
“smog season,” it would be necessary to have fast,
eﬁcient public” transportation, perhaps even having
electriﬁed buses or a monorail system. This would
let loose a hornet’s nest of opposition from some
of the most powerful interests in the county. (There
would even be facing Dr. Faith’s charge of being a
"rabblerouser.”) Even within county oﬂicialdom
there would be consternation at losing part of the
millions of dollars derived from gasoline taxes.

Wisdom and fearlessness would be required. There
was, however, a time when people associated wis-
dom and independence with the men whom they
elected to public oﬂice. A good many people would
still like to think that the accomplishments of a man
in public office were measured by such qualities ra-
ther than by the number of column inches of news-
print he gets.

ure to tackle automobile ex-

Here at last! Someone has offered an easy remedy
to the “smog” problem. It’s simple: Cancel that pur-
chase order for your new Cadillac.

MR. REES op THE S 9TH ASSEMBLY
DISTRICT WOULD SEEM TO BE
SUFFERING FROM RECURRENT
SHOCK EPISODES

When the local airborne bandwagon taxied into
International Airport from the Surgeon General‘s
junket in Washington, Mr. Rees, you told newsmen
you are "shocked” at evidence that “smog” could
be a cause of cancer of the lung. Other newspaper

 

 

“SMOG” OVER‘ LOS ANGELES

accounts have quoted you as being shocked at excess
deaths in connection with “smog” episodes.

Now we’ll take time out. to be shocked!

If you’re the same Thomas M. Rees who served as
chairman of the Assembly Interim Subcommittee
on Health Effects of Smog, it seems you’re taking
all this rather hard.

At the time your committee was in session, over
two years ago, you were in possession of data from
a questionnaire sent to all physicians in Los An-
geles County. Over 80 per-cent of them believed
that "smog” was a contributing factor to lung can-
cer. Ninety-ﬁve percent admitted “smog” caused
such physical symptoms as shortness of breath, head-
ache, chest pain, cough, etc.

NOTHING NEW ABOUT LUNG
CANCER AND “SMOG”

Your committee also had before it the results
of studies made in 1946 showing highly signiﬁcant
relationships between air pollution and lung cancer
both in Chicago and Cincinnati.

As chairman of the Assembly subcommittee, you
were handed the report of Dr. C. A. Mills, who came
out to California at the behest of interested citizens
(not the State Legislature) for the purpose of study-
ing the “smog” hazard.

Dr. Mills, who is a conservative and cautious
worker, attributed an approximate 845 excess deaths
as due to "smog” for the three years 1949, 1953,
and 195 4. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 1114
EXCESS DEATHS FOLLOWING THE “SMOG”
OF 1955. Nor does it include the excess deaths
WPIICH HAVE OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER of 1958, as
yet unreported.

A good many personsiwould like to know if you
were privy to the fact that the State Health De-
partment failed to disclose those 1114 deaths. Is
such suppression consonant with our form of
government?

“The state could ban the
sale of automobiles which pro-
duce more harmful evhaust
than others.”

We consulted an expert automotive engineer on
this point, and discovered that the State could do
this, if each of the 3 million automobiles in Los An-

geles County could have in tow a 50-foot trailer .

to serve as a gas laboratory. Two technicians should
go in each trailer.

WHO HAS THE POWER
TO MAKE "smoe" so?

NOW IT’S YOUR TURN TO
“DO SOMETHING”

Southern Californians may well be skeptical of
the local political claque noisily announcing it will
have the state legislature “do something” about or-
dering an as yet uninvented “smog-‘control device”
placed on automobiles.

Inasmuch as such a device is still mythical, there
are legal‘ problems associated with -“forcing” it to
be put on automobiles.

.MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO (1953) this
hypothetical problem was resolved by the legal ad-
visers of the Los Angeles County Board of Super-
visors. However, like an old movie, the produc'ers
of the show can be rather certain a good many in

(Continued on Next Page)

REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT
BUT FOR WHOM?

Mr. Rees, we don’t _want to talk about matters
which bring discredit to our State, but you do re-
call a few years ago when even the Governor ad-
mitted that certain lobbyists in Sacramento “ran
the Legislature” and had “more power than the
Governor.” -

That caused quite a sensation. Everyone was try-
ing to decide just who was the Real Boss of Cali-
fornia. The liquor interests seemed to be getting all
the credit for a time.

Do you concede that of the 400 lobbyists regis-
tered in Sacramento, a good many are employed by
those industries WHICH WISH TO MINIMIZE
THE SERIOUSNESS OFv“SMOG”? Is all this non-
sense?‘Do you dispute the fact that one oil company
lobbyist has an expense account of $5 00,000 per
year? Have you ever heard of grateful industries
making campaign contributions to “cooperative le-
gislators” when election time rolled around?

Mr. Rees, was our State Legislature actually set
up to represent the people in our republican form of
government? Or should we say that the “legislators”
meet now and then to select a Poet Laureate, to de-
cide that the Valley Quail should be our State bird,
and ﬁnd out how the lobbyists want the votes to
go on -the various bills presented? '

the audience have (1) not seen it or (2) forgot-
ten it anyhow.

INTRODUCING “THE PEOPLES
REPRESENTATIVES”

Here is the opinion of the County Counsel, whose
job it is to give legal advice to the Board of Super-
visors of Los ‘Angeles County; the opinion also des-
cribes the powers of the Board to remedy “smog.”

“THE RULE-MAKING POWER OF "THE
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, SITTING AS THE
AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD, IS
BROAD. ENOUGH TO COVER ALMOST ANY
CONCEIVABLE SITUATION IN CONNEC-
TION WITH THE CONTROL OF AIR POL-
LUTION IN THIS COUNTY.” Such powers, how-
ever, may not be exercised_arbitrarily, capriciously,
or unreasonably. Board action‘ must be based on
proven facts or sound scientiﬁc opinion. . . The
Board will have the power to require motor vehicles
to be equipped with a device to eliminate the emis-
sion of air contaminants as soon as such a device
is perfected, shown to be effective, available on the
market and the requirement of its use is found to
be reasonable. . .

THAT DEVICE IS GETTING RUSTY
BEFORE IT’S INVENTED

"However, we are informed by the APCD ‘en-
gineers that there IS NO DEVICE ON THE MAR-
KET AS YET WHICH WILL REDUCE OR
ELIMINATE THE EMISSION OF FUMES FROM

.MOTOR VEHICLES.T One device is being tested,

another is still in the designing state. It is not known
whether either will work. Neither is it known how
long it will be before some such device, after being
proved practicable, will be available commercially.

"Until such a device is perfected and on the mar-
ket, any rule requiring the use of the device is ar-
bitrary, capricious and void, UNLESS THE HA-
ZARD TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS SO GREAT
THAT A RULE WOULD BE IUSTIFIED FOR-
BIDDING THE SALE OR USE OF MOTOR VE-
HICLES INVTHIS COUNTY. FROM THE FACTS

* .“The lack of supervision o-f the State Department of Pub-
lic Health is a major loophole in our air pollution control
program.” WARREN M. DORN, Smog Chairman, Board
of Supervisors, Los Angeles County

1- This opinion was rendered in 1953; it applies as well to
1959.

4;, These words were written in 1953. The Board's authori-

Vty is the same today, but “smog” has become aggravated.

42

GIVEN _TO US, THE BOARD TCOULD CON-
CLUDE THAT THERE IS NO SUCH EMER-
GENCY NOW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTYJII
. . . As it is impossible to tell when" such a device
may be invented, or if invented, when perfected
for motor vehicle use and shown to be practicable,
no such regulation could be adopted now to be ef-
fective at a future date. ' I

“We conclude, that the rule you suggest, with cer-
tain modiﬁcations, can be adopted when the re-
quiredldevice is available, but not until then.”

CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND

Question: Inasmuch as legal authority rests with,
the Board of Supervisors to eliminate “smog,”
could the members of the Board be held crim-
inally responsible for deaths occurring in an
air pollution disaster?

(This Question was addressed to the Board of
Supervisors by, a certain Francis H. Packard, Chair-
man of a citizens’ action group against “smog.”)’*

Portions of the County Counsel’s opinion on this
matter are set forth below:

“Mr. Packard’s question involves two hypo-
thetical situations:
1. An air pollution disaster has occurred; and
,2. a contributing cause of the disaster is a
weak and inei_f.e.ctive emergency regulation.
"At the outset, we wish to make it clear that
we are in the possession of no facts which would
indicate that the existing emergency regulation
is weak or ineffective. To the contrary, see
the report of the Air Pollution Control Oﬂicer
on this subject to your Honorable Board.
“What is necessary or proper to accomplish

"‘ In 1955 thousands of persons in Pasadena felt

that “something should be done about smog.” A
Citizens’ Anti-Smog Action Committee was formed.
Tremendous enthusiasm was aroused by these “self-
seekers” until they were molliﬁed by the politicians.
One who refused to be dissuaded from his purpose
was Francis H. Packard, now chairman of this Com-
mittee. The organization has met many vicissitudes,
and at times its only operating personnel is Fran-
cis, H. Packard, chairman-typist-and provider of
postage stamps. He is referred to as a “disturbing

element” by A.P.C.D. but is philosophic about it.

He feels that people have little other recourse in

-such matters than just to goon being “disturb-

ing elements.”

 

“SMOG” OVER’ LOS ANGELES

 

the purpose of this chapter rests in the sound
discretion of your Honorable Board.

THE HONORABLE BOARD '

“The authorities are in accord that, . . .. mem-
bers of a legislative body cannot be held per-
sonally responsible in . . . the exercise of discre-
tion vested in them by virtue of their oﬁce, ei-
ther for or against any particular legislation or
rule, in the absence of corruption. Public policy
demands that, when" the law trusts the sound
judgment and discretion of an officer, he be
protected from the consequences of erroneous
judgment. Although an individual may suffer
by the ofﬁcer’s mistakes, generally he is not lia-
Able . ,. . where he acts in good faith, within the
scope of his authority, and without malice or
sinister motive.

JUDGEMENT AND PUBLIC OFFICE

“The true basis of this rule is that an officer
should not suffer personally where in his offi-
cial capacity, he exercises a discretion that his
public oﬂice requires him to exercise.

“Manifestly, police regulations such as the A
Rules and Regulations of an Air Pollution Con-
trol District must be reasonable and consistent
with the law. Whether a rule or regulation is
reasonable is a question for the court to deter-
mine . . .

“. . . EVEN IF THE RULES AND REGU-
LATIONS WERE LAX AND AN AIR POL-
LUTION DISASTER SHOULD RESULT,
‘NO CIVIL LIABILITY COULD ATTACH
TO YOUR HONORABLE BOARD or the
members thereof in the absence of malice, cor-
ruption or sinister motive in "adopting such
Rules and Regulations for the Air Pollution
Control District.

“Very truly yours,
HAROLD W. KENNEDY,
County Counsel .
By Donald K. Byrne (Sgd.)
Deputy County Counsel”

NEITHER CORRUPT NOR
SINISTER

In reading the opinion of the County Counsel. to
the Honorable Board, we noted the words “malice,

43

corruption or sinister motive.” (and none of these
vices would we impute -to the Honorable Board).
It seemed interesting that there should be an omis-
sion of the word “negligence.” —

Entire law volumes have been written on negli-
gence. Of what does negligence consist?

Negligent driving is apparent to anyone who
drives a car. .A policeman can pass on a driver’s
negligence without a glance at the Vehicle Code.

A safety inspector who is persuaded ‘to let some
faulty masonry "pass” is negligent.

A citizen who allows a crime to take place in
his presence, without attempting to ~ aid the vic-
tim or apprehend the criminal, is culpable.-

" An engineer whose job is to inspect a dam, is
guilty of criminal negligence, when, noting a few
tiny cracks, which would pass unperceived by the
ordinary person, he fails to send out an alarm.

A physician called to attend a patient with pneu-
monia and who does nothing but sit by the bedside,
and after the patient’s demise, comfort the be-
reaved family, is guilty of criminal negligence. He
is neither malicious, sinister, or corrupt. Yet, as the

possessor of specialized knowledge, he is expected‘

to take positive .action in certain c‘ases calling for
such action. He could be held responsible for the
patient’s death. .

And another question is raised ‘in the layman’s
mind by the opinion of Counsel to the Honorable
Board:

“YOU CAN’T SUE THE KING!”

Are members of the Board of Supervisors “offi-
cers” or are they “governors”? If they are “officers,”

it is implied that they are carrying out theorders

of a governing body. Which governing body? Why,

the governing body which they themselves consti- '

tute! This does indeed become wearisome sophistry.
But is the question not without justiﬁcation?

We telephoned a lawyer, an expert on negligence.
“Pretend we had unlimited funds and wanted to
sue the Board of Supervisors . . .”
“You can’t sue the king!-”
“But the Board of Sup-—. . .”
“You can’t sue the king!”
. A-nyhow, that’s it. Government representatives
are immune to lawsuits, in their capacities as govern-

ors; they cannot be ‘held criminally or civilly res-

ponsible for decisions they make — or neglect to
make. That’s called “sovereign immunity.”

 

 

 

“SMOG” OVER LOS ANGELES

“The care of human lifeand happiness, and not their

destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of

good government.”

 

SUPERVISORS
DEMAND AUTO
SMOG CONTROL

State control _to control the
noxious content of gasoline . . .
and to provide for installation
of antismog devices on all new
automobiles was urged by the
Supervisors of 10 Southland
c'ounties yesterday . . .

The Supervisors by their ac-
tion handed the antismog pro-
position to the State Supervi-
sors Association Air Pollution
Control Committee headed by
William Philliﬂs, Supervisor
from Orange County. Phillips
said his committee will advo-
cate the new laws. . . _

In addition, certain stand-
ards could be established to
limit the noxious content when
gasoline is ma‘nufac‘tured, Phil-
lips said. . . .. '

“It is ﬁtting that California
lead the way in antismog legis-

lation,” he added.

A sordid carnival has taken I place in Los An-
geles to obscure the fact that the members of the
governing body of the county are afraid to tackle
the Leviathan known as "Smog..” I

,A typical publicity handout to the newspapers
is- that appearing above. The purpose of the story
is to create the impression among the population (of
whoma good percentage are voters) that the Board
of Supervisors is “doing something” about “smog.”

Let’s. translate the journalese into the simple terms.

44:

CHICKEN LITTLE,
CHICKEN LITTLE,

1. The supervisors of Los Angeles County are
frightened and don.’ t know what to do.

2. They met with some supervisors of 10
other counties in Southern California, who also
are frightened and don’t know what to do.

3. All the supervisors from the Southland
counties decided that although there’s safety ‘in

numbers, there’s not enough. Therefore, they

decided to move the matter into the realm pre-
sided over by supervisors from the entire state.
At least the state supervisors have formed a
committee.

THE SKY IS FALLING!“

4. Even the committee acting for the super-
visors of all the counties of the. state doesn’t
know what to do. (The members really know
what should be done, but they are frightened).

5. So the State Supervisors Assoc'iation’s Air
Pollution Committee decided the illusion of
“doing. something” would best be ‘served by
turning theirnatter over to the State Legislature.

6. However, instead of turning just “it” over
to, the Legislature, it is necessary to formulate a
couple of concrete proposals. These are:

They offer no suggestion how the noxious
content of a poisonous .fuel like gasoline will be
“controlled.” Nor do they suggest a way in
which an antismog device, which has not even
been invented, can be put on cars.

“It is fitting that California lead the way in anti-
smog legislation,” said the Supervisor‘ of Orange
County. ' '

"smoo" OVER LOS ANGELES

 

IN CONCLUSION.
we HAVE ONLY
A FEW WORDS TO SAY. . .

(NOT in order of importance)

. (1) Buy this pamphlet. (You may be just “look-
ing” at it.) We went in hock to get it out, and
still owe the printer.

(2) The issue before us is really a moral one.
Tremendous courage will be required to grapple with
the forces which would minimize “smog” for‘ econ-
omic advantage. Even more courage than cancel-
ing an order for a'Cadillac. More courage than that re
quired by members of the City Council or Board
of'Supervisors of Los Angeles to refuse to ride any
but "sma1l”, cars. ' ’

The moral issue is whether a price should be put on
human welfare and (human life. Every ﬁber of our
moral beings cries out against this.

WHY IT’S EASY 2 »

Yes, someone must get up to say that, DESPITE .

CATACLYSMIC ECONOMIC CONSEQUEN-
CES, such extreme measures are in order as cur-
tailing automobile traffic, closing reﬁneries and in-
dustries when there is even the possibility of "smog.”
We must not permit such lunacy as having a gov-
ernment bureau like the A.P.C.D. forecast “heavy
smog tomorrow.”

A politician may feel he is inviting annihilation
to take such a stand. (It is so much easier to say,
“Smog must Go!”) Thoughtful people should sup-
port such a man.

Rather than “paralyze the community” by such
measures, we believe that a well-informed citizen-
ry would address itself to the task ahead. And ra-
ther than having the politicians waste time "berat-
ing Detroit” in newsprint, a boycott such as cur-
tailing automobile use would spur Detroit to a
“crash” solution faster than you can slam on a brake.

THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC LIFE
ARE HARD FACTS

(3) Take a realistic look at the hard facts of econ-
omic life; they must be faced: ‘

California depends upon the petroleum industry
alone for 25% of its income. One industry! What
about the automotive industry, and also the 15 ,'000

45

industries in Los Angeles, County? They contribute I

tremendous sums in tax—money. ‘One county de-
partment alone, in Los Angeles, depends each year
upon $30 million collected from gasoline taxes!
No matter how formidable such moneyed might,
it is not license to existjat the expense of human
beings. ‘ I

. (4) Los Angeles has beenin a state of crisis for

a decade. Let’s dispense with the slogan’s of the _

politicians, “Smog Must Go! .-—- Visible and_ Invi-
sible. . .”o and the cliches of the scientists, “More

research is needed,” etc. Research should continue,‘

but now is the time for rigid policing and con-
trol measures, bearing heavy penalties for infrac-
tions.. (When yellow phosphorus was recognized
as a poison, it quickly “disappeared” when. exorbit-
ant taxes were placed upon its commercial use.)

An “alert” should be given "When the‘ ozone level
is at 0.1 ppm and more pronounced measures taken
at‘ O.2_ ppm —_— despite a litany of protests from the
scientist faction.

WE HAVE THE MEANS
' (S) The wealthiest county in. the world 
THE MEANS NOW AT HAND TO RID THE
AIR OF ITS POISONS. THE GOVERNING
BOARD OF THIS COUNTY IS THE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS.
(6) Put the “experts” in their places. Every

reﬁnery in the area, and every industry, can hire

a stable of experts in medicine and chemistry to be-
fuddle us with data. What is right and proper should
be according to the “clear and simple notions of the
people.”

(7)_ Call to task political candidates (of any par-
ty) who seem too avidly attached to the vote-get-
ting slogan “attracting new industries to Califor-
nia.” Have them face up to reality, which is that
this area is not exactly the potential gold mine for

industries that its touters would have us believe — .

not until human beings can move about in un-

fouled air.

(8) Demand through senators and congressmen
federal legislation at least as good as that supplied
by the. federal Food and D'rug Act_. It should be bet-
ter, and carry strongly punitive measures. (An in-
dustry measuring its wealth in the many millions
is unimpressed by even a $10,000 ﬁne)‘.

 

 

 

“SMOG”-' OVER ~ LOS7 ANGELES

“EN GARDE!” . .» .

‘THE PHONY FRONT

(9) ‘Give a long, hard look * at any organization
calling itself a “Pure Air Foundation” or which

gives itself the motto, “Dedicated to the solution of-

the smog problem.” Most of these are mere “front”
organizations for the very reﬁneries and industries
for whom ‘community policing action would mean
economic loss. These organizations are so ingenious-
ly deceptive”that, by ‘comparison, any “commie

front” group wouldseem obvious as an old ﬂoosie.‘

The politician, too, is ﬁnding “Clean Air for Cali-
fornia” a better slogan than “Helping the unem-
ployed,” or “Solving the farm problem.”

-(10) Look skeptically at the handsomely printed
“information folders” .and “technical reports” of
the A.P..C.D., The Air Pollution Foundation, oil
companies, even the State Department of Public
Health. (“Clean Air for California.”) These repre-

sent the work of geniuses — in the ﬁeld of decep-

tion. -
(11) Recognize that the Air Pollution Control
District, if it were in the employ of those indus-

be congratulated for its’ work in keeping “smog”
around and. keeping the people paciﬁed. As long as
A.P.C.D. exists,’ it will give a false, illusion of se-
curity.. When human welfare is involved, we should
not permit ourselves the luxury of indulgence.

APPLY ONLY«IF ALL
ELSE FAILS

(12) All the foregoing suggestions have been set
forth in an attitude of despair. The array of anta-
gonistic forces is too great. The awareness of the
peril, physical and moral, is too slight on the part
of those who should be most concerned.

Therefore, why not give thought to an old Hindu
remedy called d/oarymz. It is avsilent appeal for justice,
by fasting even to death, while seated at the door
of the wrongdoer. It is suggested that willing citi-
zens of Los Angeles assume the appropriate pos-
tures on the steps of the new County Ofﬁce Build-
ing, where are located the air-conditioned, 12-room
suites of the Board of Supervisors. In India it takes
as long as a month to die in this fashion, but be-
cause of the asphyxiants in the Los Angeles air, the
process. would no doubt be beneﬁcently hastened.

GLOSSARY

iirlilrﬂr

ii?

AIR — A mixture of gases in our atmosphere of
which about 79 %_ is nitrogen, 20% oxygen, and 1%
carbon dioxide and rare inert gases. The word mix-
ture is important. If air were a compound, every
sample of it would have the same percentage com-
position of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.
It would mean that when “air” was taken into the

. lungs, a chemical breakdown would have to take

place before oxygen could be freed for respiration.
As it is," the lungs simply select oxygen molecules
and let .the inert nitrogen gas serve as a diluent and
be expired, —— so much simpler than having to de-
pend upon a chemical reaction to obtain oxygen.

ALARMIST —— Anyone who thinks “smog” should
be eradicated rather than “controlled” and who

thinks that should be done NOW.

ALVEOLUS — One of the minute air cells of the
lungs, the ultimate unit of respiration.

ANOXEMIA — Lack of oxygen in blood.-
ANOXIA — Lack of oxygen. A
ATELECTASIS — A diseased condition of the lung

where it may be shunken or airless. It may be acute
or chronic, complete or incomplete. The cause of
atelectasis is bronchial obstruction.

BRONCHUS — One of the two subdivisions" of
the windpipe extending into the lungs.

BRONCHIOLE — One of the smaller subdivisions
of a bronchus. '

BRONCHITIS — Inﬂammation, acute or chronic,
of bronchial tubes. Although there are other causes,
acute bronchitis may be caused by ‘physical and
chemical irritants such as dusts, strong acid fumes

.(such as sulfuric acid mist), irritating gases. Al-

though in the normal state the bronchial tubes are

7%

‘:9?

clean and sterile, bronchitis permits the invasion of
germs of far more serious disases, e.g. tuberculosis
and pneumonia.

BERYLLIUM — A rare, steel—white, metallic ele-
ment, rather" like aluminum but lighter and harder.
One of its industrial uses is coating the insides of
ﬂuorescent light tubes. Beryllium dust, although
considered at _ﬁrst unimportant, causes acute lung
inﬂammation and granulomas (cancer-like condi-
tions) and is now regarded as extremely hazardous.
Cases of death from inhalation of the dust have oc-
curred when the concentration in the atmosphere
was less than 0.001 milligram per cubic meter of air..

CAPILLARY — A type of blood vessel, extreme-
ly small, spread throughout the body. Through‘ the
thin walls of the c'apillaries, oxygen of the red
blood cells "passes to the tissues; the carbon dioxide
from the tissues passes into the capillaries.

CARBON —— is an element, a non-metal. It is found
free in nature in the form of graphite or diamond.
Carbon is a necessary part of all animal and plant
life. Organic chemistry is a study~of carbon com-
pounds. Compounds like petroleum and natural
gas, which contain carbon and hydrogen, are called
hydrocarbons.

CARBON DIOXIDE — A colorless gas, a product

of oxidation in body tissues; when present in ex- .

cess it acts as a stimulant to the respiratory center
of the brain.

CARBON MONOXIDE (See Catalogue of Poisons)
CHLORINE — (See Catalogue of Poisons)

CARCINOGEN — A substance capable of produ-
cing cancer.. Carcinogens have been" isolated from
both_ tobacco and “smog.”

‘ COMBUSTION, — Burning; it is the rapid'oxida-

tion of a substance with the liberation of’ heat.
' In the burning of gasoline complete combustion
is represented by the-following equation:

Gasoline + Oxygen —} Carbon Dioxide + Water
(Supplied - ‘
by air)

The automobile engine is designed for power and
efficient performance, not for seeing that a chemi-
cal reaction takes place to completion. Therefore,
products of incomplete combustion are released in
the exhaust.

Carbon Monoxide
Unburned gasoline

j vapors

Aldehydes

Acetylene

(Oxides of nitrogen—
not actually a product
of combustion, but the
high temperatures
cause the nitrogen of
the air, ordinarily in-
ert, to react.)

COUNTY COUNSEL — The legal advisers to the
Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County.

CRUDE OIL — Petroleum just as it comes from
the ground, before reﬁning. .

DIESEL ENGINE — A type of internal combus-
tion engine, differing from the gasoline engine in
that the ignition of the fuel depends upon the heat
of compression of air in the cylinders, rather than
spart ignition. An advantage of the diesel engine is
that it can use cheap crude‘oil for fuel. Engine tem-
peratures are much hotter than gasoline engines.
Exposure to diesel exhaust fumes is hazardous even
for short periods of time..

DIFFUSION —— A processin which the molecules
of one substance become uniformly distributed
among those of another substance, seemingly in con-
tradiction to the laws of gravitation. Diffusion is
a property of gases, the lighter the gas the greater
its speed 0 diffusion.

DONORA — A little town of 13,000 located on
a bend of the Monongahela River in Pennsylvania.
It has become the poignant symbol of “smoggy”
death. During a period ‘of cold, dampness, and air
stagnation, from October 26-31, 1948, the indus-

Gasoline -1- Oxygen —>

trial poisons from the city’s zinc and sulfuric“ acid
processing plants. were allowed to settle upon the
city. On the ﬁfth day, 2.0 persons had died, and over
6000 of the ‘population had become acutely ill. _

Even among those who survived the “smog” the
death rate has been double that for ‘persons unex-
posed. And survivors of; the “smog” have since
shown a far greater incidence of illness.

An investigation carried out by the American
Public Health Service revealed only “triﬂing” a-
mounts of poisons. These “triﬁing”~levels exist many
times in the Los Angeles area.

The pathos of D'onora’s drama is best portrayed
in the book, “Air Pollution and Community Health,”
by C. A. Mills.

EDEMA —— Abnormal accumulation of ﬂuid in body
cavities. When it occurs in lung tissues, it is called
pulmonary edema.

ETHANE — ‘A gaseous hydrocarbon, occuring in
natural gas.

EMPHYSEMA — A diseased condition of the lungs
in which the air sacs become enlarged and distended.
so that the walls separating the alvebli are worn away.
The result is a lessening of the over-all surface ex-
posed to air. Emphysema causes lung tissue to thicken.

Any condition which can cause these alveolar tis-
sues to hyperinﬂate may produce emphysema. Chron-
ic lung infections, or inhaling toxic dusts or air poi-
sons may cause or aggravate the condition.’

For the sufferer of emphysema, breathing becomes
increasingly diﬂicult, unless unaffected portions of
the lungs may take over increased functions. The
emphysema patient ﬁnds exertion, even talking,
very tiring and causes him to cough. Sometimes the
patient is able to breathe more easily if he assumes a
forward sitting posture, with elbows placed upon
the knees.

GAS — The characteristic which distinguishes a gas
from a solid or liquid, the other two states of mat-
ter, is its inﬁnite expansibility. It ﬁlls any contain-
er, no matter the size, because its molecules move
around so fast. '

There are certain gas laws:

If a gas is compressed, itsvolume will decrease.

Under the inﬂuence of heat a gas expands.

Because the molecules of a gas are in rapid mo-
tion, they diffuse completely into the surrounding
area. '

The characteristics of a gas are explained by the
molecular activity. The ‘molecules of ' a gas are in

48

“SMOGf’ oven Los ANGELES

 

constant, extreme, and erratic motion, constantly
colliding with one another. This motion is called
Brownian movement and explains why a very hea-
vy gas or vapor like bromine, about 3' times the
weight of air, will diffuse equally throughout the
area allowed it. . ‘ ‘S ' -

The speed with which agas diffuses depends upon"

its molecular weight. The lighter a gas, the more
rapidly it diffuses. Hydrogen, the lightest‘ gas known,
has the greatest speedoof diffusion, and mingles-with

air 4 times as rapidly as does oxygen. The rate of.

the diffusion of a gas increases with the temperature.

GAS MASK —— A face covering that constitutes,

mosphere "surrounding us. In -its combined state it
is a constituent of all living tissues.

NITRITE — A salt form of nitrous acid.

OXIDANT — Any substance which causes another
to become oxidized.

OXIDATION — Oxidation is a process whereby
oxygen enters into chemical combination with an-
other substance. When iron corrodes and gets rusty,
a new chemical, iron oxide, has been formed. In or-
ganic chemistry, an oxidation reaction is best illus-
trated ‘by the conversion of the food we eat into
carbon dioxide, water and energy. V

In the world about us, the decomposition of plant
life, the change in color o_f the leaves in autumn
and their disintegration are examples "of oxidation.
It is nature’s way of returning the world of the liv-
ing to its inorganic constituents.

OXYGEN — A gaseous element occurring freely
in the atmosphere. It is indispensable to all animal

life.

PHAGOCYTES —— Large cells in the body, capa-
ble of independent, amoeboid movement. They can
ingest bacteria and absorb foreign particles.

PNEUMONOCONIOSES — A category of lung
diseases caused by inhaling particles of dust or

by the lungs. A

SMOG -— “A source of bother to people in Los
Angeles” ——- if you wish to use the deﬁnition of_the
A.P.C.D. The word “smog” was first used in- 1905
to describe a combination of smoke .and fog in Lon-

poisons.

SMOG CONTROL. -—- The maintenance of atmos-
pheric poisons in the air at slightly sub-lethal con-
centrations. The art of "smog control” has become
important to industry, politics, and government
bureaus.

SYNERGISM —— Applied to poisons-, it means that

ALDEHYDES —‘ Aldehyde describes a ‘group of
chemical substances, which vary .in toxicity; and
they reek. As a poison, aldehydes produce local ir-
ritation, especially in the respiratory tract. The
nose and throat are affected, as well as the bronchi
and the lungs. Their chemical action in the body
depends upon their combining with the proteins,
resulting -in precipitated protein substances. They
alsoeinterfere with body enzymes. In contact with

the skin, aldehydes may give rise to cases of serious

skin disorders.
The effect upon theeye is that of “eye irritation.”
Described in more detail by an. expert in Occupa-

“tional Medicine, Dr. Fleming:

“Aldehydes profoundly affect the _cell structure
by combining with the amino, carboxyl, and hy-
droxyl groups of protein.‘ Edema and loss of the
corneal epithelium develop slowly» after exposure.

Deep structures in the cornea are then involved,

and damage to’ the blood vessels in the conjunctiva,
with hemmorhages.”

Ranked with others, aldehydes cannot be con-_

sideredas very‘ poisonous. A leading source of alde-
hydes is diesel exhaust gas.

AMMONIA —— A whiff of spirits of ammonia may ‘

-be given to revive a fainting person (it’s useless);

at strong dose may kill by reason of irritating act-
aion upon the throat passages. Congestion and swell-
ing of the respiratory tract may produce spasm of
the glottis or larynx so that air to the lungs is
closed off. ~

About gases in general, which "merely irritate”:
“Some irritant gases act primarily upon the
upper throat passages, causirfg. inﬂamation of
the nose, throat, and larynx. Others extend their
action to the bronchi and cause bronchitis and
bronchopneumonia. Still others act chiefly , on
_ the lungs, ' cause pulmonary edema. The symp-
toms of laryngitis caused by an irritant gas are _
‘quite different from those‘ of pulmonary edema;
but so also, for example, are the symptoms aris-
ing from a burn upon the palm of the hand and
one on the eye ball.” (Henderson 81 Haggard)

Liquid ammonia‘ has extensive use in refrigeration
and fertilizer‘ plants.

CARBON MONOXIDE,-— (Please refer to the
chapter on Carbon Monoxide) — The M.A.C. for
carbon monoxide exposure is_ 100 parts per million
for an 8-hour day, assuming no other contamin-
ants are present. The ‘level at which a First Alert

may be called in Los Angeles is 100 parts. per mil-

lion).

It is of the greatest importance just where mea-
surements of the gas are taken. Carbon monoxide,
like all gases, diffuses rapidly into the surrounding
environment. ‘However, tests of carbon monoxide
concentration, taken at a, distance of 50 feet from
the curb, as in the casexof tests run by the Air Pol-
lution Foundation , ARE NO INDICATION of

CHLORINE —_- Chlorine is used extensively in com-
mercial processing and also in the puriﬁcation of
water supplies. It is a component of bleaching pow-
der.. Readily soluble in water, it, like ammonia, gives
ready warning of its presence.

When chlorine is the .cause of death or injury, it
is becauseof its irritating effect on respiratory pas-
sages.

The .M.A.C. for prolonged exposure is 0.35 to
1.0 ppm. A concentration of 3.5 ppm must exist
before the average person can detect its presence
in the air.

GASOLINE —— (Considered as a poison, and apart
from the effect of any of its additives) .—-— Gasoline
is a poison even before itlgets into your car’s engine,
so that anyplan to n“remove the toxicity of gas-
oline” can only be regarded as one of "the major
fatuities of our day. Even in minute. concentrations,
gasoline, being very volatile, irritates the eyes and
skin. No service station operator needs a Hydrocar-
bon Theory of Smog Formation to convince him of
this.

Inhaling lower concentrations cause ﬂushing of the
can result in unconsciousness, coma, and death.
Drinking it may cause severe symptoms and death.

Inhaling lower concentrations cause ﬂushing of the
face, mental confusion, staggering and incoordin'-
a.tion. .

The products of the incomplete combustion of
gasoline, the aldehydes, carbon monoxide, nitrogen
oxides, etc. are considered separately.

HYDROGEN CYANIDE — Hydrogen cyanide
(evolved from the reaction of sodium cyanide and
sulfuric acide) is used to despatch our criminals in
the State’s lethal chamber. On the scale of relative
toxicities, however, hydrogen cyanide is 200 times
more tolerable than a gas such as ozone.

Hydrogen cyanide is one of the most rapidly-

Fatal in less than 1 hr

acting of poisons, combining at once with the blood
hemoglobin, as does) carbon‘ monoxide.

The gas ' is used in. industry as a fumigant; it
kills insects -—— all higher animals —— but is ineffec-
tive against bacteria... Also, it is ‘used in gold—ex-
tracting. ‘

For prolonged exposure the M.A.C. for hydrogen
cyanide is 20 ppm.

HYDROGEN FLUORIDE —- Hydrogen ﬂuoride
is one gas which is more reactive on tissue than is
ozone. Used to etch glass and metal in industry, it
is capable {of forming ulcers wherever it may come
in contact‘ with the skin or respiratory membranes
of the body. It is used as a constituent in refriger-
ant ' gases.
For prolonged exposure the M.A.C. is 3 ppm.

HYDROGEN SULFIDE — Hydrogen sulﬁde in
slight concentration smells like rotten eggs — which
is good. Massive concentrations result in failure to
detect the smell at all, because the olfactory nerves
have become paralyzed. .
, For prolonged exposure, 8 hours, the M.A.C. for
this gas is 20 ‘parts per million. This is the same
M.A.C.. for hydrogen cyanide gas.
Hydrogen sulﬁde is one of the gases released in re-
ﬁnery operations, and only recently in Los Angeles
County the strong odor of its presence was detected

over the southern part of the county. The ‘fumes

originated‘ .. in El Segundo area (the reﬁnery area)
and were swept inland through Hawthorne, Gar-
dena, Compton and Inglewood.

Hydrogen sulﬁde was the gas responsible for the
deaths at Poza Rica, Mexico,‘ when an operating de-
’fect at the reﬁnery permitted the gas to escape over
the surrounding areas.

In large concentration hydrogen sulﬁde may have
an immediately lethal effect. However, even in low
concentration, it may have an irritating effect upon

the cornea of‘ the eye. The gas" actually causes the

precipitation of sodium sulﬁde upon the eye. It feels
like “grains of sand.”

NICKEL — As a constituent of fuels, nickel dust
represents a certain hazard. Some people are extreme-
ly susceptible to nickel, even developing a derma-
titis from‘ the use of nickel zippers. Nickel acts ‘as
a carcinogen. ‘

NITROGEN, OXIDES OF — There are several

oxides of nitrogen. These are Nitrous oxide (a mild

anesthetic); Nitric oxide (seldom exists in the at-
mosphere as it immediately oxidizes to N02)‘; Ni-

trogen dioxide; AND nitrogen trioxide, tetraoxide,

pentoxide, and peroxide.

The one of chief concern as a “smog” constituent
is Nitrogen dioxide. It is classed among the extreme-
ly poisonous gases, although considerably less poi-
sonous than the gas to which it is often compared,
phosgene. .

The main source of nitrogen dioxide is in power

-plants,’ reﬁneries, diesel motor exhausts, and auto-

mobile exhausts. Although a signiﬁcant poison in
itself, Its presence in the air also. encourages the
development of ozone.

OZONE —— Our attitude toward this extremely poi-
sonous gas is somewhat befuddled in that over a
space of years, those who observed its excellence in
killing germs considered it might have beneﬁcial
properties! (Hydrogen cyanide is excellent in kill-
ing insects, but isn’t recommended for ﬁlling sachet
bags.)

Certain experiments undertaken with ozone have
demonstrated that its toxic action is _increased great-
ly in the presence of other contaminants. Existing
as the sole contaminant in ﬁltered air, considerably
more of it can "be tolerated.

THE MAXIMUM. ALLOWABLE CONCEN-
TRATION FOR OZONE IS 0..I ppm IN INDUS-
TRY. THIS THRESHOLD VALUE HAS NOT
BEEN ACCEPTED IN CALIFORNIA, WHERE
A CONCENTRATION 10 TIMES THAT MUST
EXIST (1.0 ppm) BEFORE REMEDIAL ACTION
IS TAKEN.

PHOSGENE —— Phosgene is a chemical tie—in of

both carbon monoxide and chlorine gases, and its
toxicologic effect is more than twice that of either
of those components. It was once a hazard in the
use of chloroform as an anesthetic. . In the use of
carbon tetrachloride ﬁre extinguishers, phosgene
evolves from the chlorinated hydrocarbon and hot
metal. For this-reason carbon tet extinguishers have
only limited use.

Like nitric oxide," phosgene gas waits until it in-
vades the lungs before the molecules begin to de-
compose — which istoo late.

The M.A.C.. for phosgene has been set at 1.0 ppm.

SULFUR DIOXIDE - SULFURIC ACID —— Sulfur
dioxide is a colorless gas nearly 2% times heavier
than air. It is constantly in the air over large coal-
burning areas, and in the presence of moisture, sul-
fur dioxide forms sulfuric acid — the acrid mists
which have, .with other contaminants, accounted

I for the lethal "fogs” of London.

Any industry which makes use of sulfuric acid
or forms sulfuric acid in its processing plants is a
potential source of sulfur dioxide. Because of the
almost universal use of sulfuric acid in industry,
this makes almost any industrial community a source
of this gas.

It is possible to detect concentrations of the gas
at a concentration of 4 parts per million. At a tenth
this concentration, and far below the threshold of
smell, the gas has physical effects on breathing rates
and heart action. At a concentration of only 0.02%
(200 ppm) the extreme irritating effects of this gas
cannot be tolerated even for one minute.

TETRAETHYL LEAD — For the community at
large, the chief source of TEL is the gasoline used
in their automobiles. Automobile exhaust also emits
TEL in particulate form. A limit of 3 c.c. per gal-
lon of gasoline has been set. TEL’s poisonous effects
may arise from contact with the skin, inhaling the
vapor, or swallowing even minute particles which
have contaminated food or drink..Even from severe
exposure symptoms may not arise for 3 or 4 hours.
Slight exposure may cause such undeﬁned symptoms
as nausea, lack of appetite, nervousness, weakness,
etc. The poison is a cumulative one. It is not elimin-
ated from the system.

VANAD-IUM — is important as an industrial ha-
zard, because of its presence in fuel oils used in re-
ﬁneries and power _ plants. It’s action is considered
when it occurs as dust,

“Vanadium ‘compounds, especially the penta-
valent forms, act as irritants to the upper res-
piratory tract and eyes . . . Upon prolonged
or intense exposure, pulmonary. involvement
may occur leading to bronchopneumonia. . .”

REFLECTIONS ON
THE NATURE OF
HUMAN RESPIRATION

BREATHING MECHANICS

Living creatures need air in order to remain living
creatures. Among the higher animals, including
man, the act of breathing is a specialty, the lifting of
the diaphragm, the contraction and expansion of the
rib cage, the alternate sucking in and expelling of
air. No matter how complex may be the physiology,
the principles involved in breathing are still mech-
anical. Leather bellows could perform the feat as well.

Most of the time we inhale air and exhale it with-
out any c0nsc'ious awareness. Only a few people have
known the horrors of partial strangulationor as-
phyxia, and survived to tell of it.

Respiration, on the other hand, is a physiologic
activity of which we are completely unconscious.
Respiration involves getting a supply of oxygen and
transporting it to the body tissues. Respiration is a
primordial function of all living creatures. The tiny
"blue baby” with defective heart is suffering from
difficulty in respiration, not with breathing.

IT’S THE OXYGEN THAT COUNTS

In the simpler forms of life, oxygen is always very
close to the body surface, such as in the amoeba or the
hydra. The single-celled amoeba lets in a globule of
air now and then at will. Going up the invertebrate
scale, there are found certain types which have long
airducts going the length .of the body.

Fish, enormously complex by comparison, wrest
molecules of oxygen from the water as it gushes
through their gills. A fish cannot live when its wa-
tery “atmosphere” has been deprived of dissolved
oxygen, or when -noxious substances in the water
make it impossible to utilize the available oxygen.

A marvelous specialization in mammalian develop-
ment is the spongy mass of tissue embedded within
the chest cavity, the lung. Specialization in lung de-
velopment works ever toward obtaining the maxi-
mum exposure of breathing surface to air. The tis-
sues of the human lung provide a surface to air more
than 100 times that of the entire surface of the body.

MILLIONS OF ’EM

The air we breathe goes through nose, throat, tra-

chea, then into either bronchus, the smaller bron-
chioles; then — ever bifurcating ,—- into the ulti-
mate unit of respiration, a minute saccule called an
alveolus, similar in its structure to the cell of a
honeycomb. Of these alveoli there are countless mil-
lions, lying in quivering proximity to the blood-
ﬁlled capillaries of the pulmonary vessels.

The alveolus may be regarded as the sacred ﬁnal
chamber into which air ﬂows_. The alveolar tissue
is the most vulnerable of all body tissues. Through-
out the entire route the air has taken, there have
been valiant defenders against access to these air
spaces. The hairs — so unaesthetic —— visible at our
nasal oriﬁces, and so easily tickled, are vestiges of
crude animal defense, alert to seine out any offend-
ing insect or particle. And so that which we engulf
by mouth won’t have a chance to go down" the
“wrong way,” the coughing reﬂex comes into play,
and we cough up the objectionable substance.

Mucus membrane lines the entire respiratory tract
beginning at the nose and throat, continuing into
the trachea, the bronchus, the smalled bronchioles.
Also, throughout this entire passageway, there are
microscopic hairs called cilia which engage in cease-
less waving motion to force any unwanted particle
back, into a bronchus where it may be coughed up
and expelled. Consciously we "clear the throat” and
spit out, a lucky animal defense that. The presence
of irritants in our air passages causes mucus to ﬂow
from’ the linings in great abundance —— for our pro-
tection.

LET THE PHAGOCYTES
TAKE OVER

Another protective device of the lungs lies in the
germ-ingesting ability of the white blood corpuscles,
those known as phagocytes. They arise from lymph
nodes, engulf and destroy invading bacteria. They
do this in the healthy lung. The tarnished lung loses,
depending upon the extent of injury, its ability to
cleanse itself. Germs of any infectious disease which
happen to be around, tuberculosis, inﬂuenza, pneu-
monia, may have a ﬁeld day.

Protection is a feature of the entire respiratory
passage -— almost. Nose, throat, trachea, bronchus,
bronchioles have a lining of mucous membrane and
microscopic hairs; even to the minute chambers, one
called the atrium and the other the infundibulum,
which lead to the alveolus. At this point there are
no more defenders. The alveoli have as their sole
function allowing oxygen to pass into the blood
stream and allowing carbon dioxide to ﬂow from
the tissues into the lungs for excretion.
