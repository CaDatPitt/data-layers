December 1934

The Defeat of theSpanishOotober

, HE l?.:\"l‘R.»\NCE of the Chiristian-Fascists i_nt0_ith’e govern-, 1

ment was the signal for the insurrection to the ,S_pa_n_,i_sh work-
ing class. Having learned the lessons of the recent inte_rn.ationa-1
experiences, particularly those of Austria, it well understood that
there was no use in creating illusions for oneself. Thehour for

the armed struggle had arrived. Any delay, no matter what the
pretext, would have weakened the position of the proletariat, giving ._

the enemy time to prepare himself better, and besides, _would.ha_v_e
sowed demoralization in the workers’ ranks at the time when its
spirit was at maximum tension. _

Reaction and the government in spite of the discoveries made
of arms deposits, and the even more resolute attitude of the social-
ist press, did not expect anything like so rapid and serious a reply.
The majority government was formed at 6 P.M. on October 4 and
the general strike began at midnight. .

The bourgeoisie never took the revolutionary threats of the

syndicalists in all seriousness. The very prudent history of the‘

syntlicalists in the labor movement was known and it was no secret
that when radical phraseology was resorted to, the object was to
cover its shameful acts with a heavy veil of rhetoric. On the other
hand, the socialists in their speeches, commenced to assume an
ultra-intransigcant position in direct contradiction to their daily
behavior in action. This too awoke many doubts and was the
result of the inability of the socialist party leaders, and their lack
of decision when it came to taking a clear position in a given
political situation. Froin the moment that their participation in
the government came to an end, they announced a complete reor-
ientation onto the revolutionary road, affirming that they wereno
longer interested in the course of “bourgeois” republican politics
which according to them belonged to a world that the socialist
party had forever renounced. The socialist party leaders pretended
a disdain that they did not feel and which was contradicted by
their daily acts, for all of the republican parties, for all possible
government changes, for all electoral problems. As the legislation
of the republican-socialist period was annulled, without the social-
ist party in spite of its verbal intransigeance doing anything more
than make the usual gestures, the bourgeoisie continued arrogantly
to assert itself in the belief that this revolutionary hysteria on the
part of the socialist party might be the result of offended pride for
having been displaced from power, a means of intimidation, or else
a propaganda stunt intended to attract the masses but certainly no
firm revolutionary determination. The recent discoveries of arms
deposits, many at the homes of leading socialists, again commenced
to sow the seeds of alarm among the bourgeoisie at a time when
the latter had thought the danger of a socialist revolution to be past.
I But one well acquainted with the socialist movement could, in
spite of its inconsistent policy, have formed an even clearer idea of

the direction of its policy, than the socialist party leaders them-’

selves. This, in spite of the pedantic skepticism of the doctrinary

. elements of the working class (Stalinists, anarchists) who were

fortiﬁed by an entirely negative attitude towards the social demo-

cracy, and the ironical reserve with which the most conscious ‘ele- -

ments of the bourgeoisie received the warnings of the revolution.’
As the situation became more acute, it was increasingly -evident
that the socialist party was really determined not to‘ allow itself
to be beaten down by Fascism. This was the: only thing that was
clear: the other revolutionary gesticulations had not crystallized
into anything concrete. ’

The youngest and most enthusiastic elements formed an exagger~ .

ated idea of evolution of the party, which they assumed had
broken or was about to break forever with reformism. The Left-
ward evolution, manifested in the international social democracy
after the victories of the counter-revolution in Germany and Aus-
tria, was sharper and more rapid in Spain than anywhere else.
This was due to the special political situation of the country and
not to any real essential diiiference. We well know that under the
present circumstances of the labor movement the possibilities of
victory over Fascism depend in the ﬁrst place on the degree to
which the social democracy has evolved towardsthe Left, This

is especially so, in view of the uselessness of expect,ing,any_t_hi'ng _

progressive froni the Communist International, that paralyzed ap-
pendage of the diplomatic policy of the U.S.S.R. which now per-

haps is about to disappear from the political arena. It would how-
ever be a mistake-to suppose that the social democracy, through;
internal evolution, can transform itself into a truly revolutionary ‘

party.

_ If reaction had ceased to advance, the radicalization of the
socialist party would have become limited to a diversity of opinions
and tendencies inside a party that was stalled in its traditional
reformism. At the same time that the socialist party on the one
hand was energetically preparing to ﬁght Fascism, it kept open to
the very last moment a means of retreat, whereby it might be able
to take refuge in a. democratic solution. It is here that we must
look for the immediate and concrete causes of the failure of the
October 5 insurrection. That is where the explanation lies and not
in the insurrection having come too late as in Vienna or an act of
treason by the organization responsible for the movement. If a
reformist party, because of its reformist character did not decide
to resort to the insurrection until it saw the enemy actually taking
over the power,-this does not mean that a revolutionary party
placed in the same position would have rebelled at an earlier date.
But it ’would‘not' have arrived at the day of the insurrection in
such disadvantageous condition, it would have utilized thoroughly
everyrecourse at its disposal in order to alter the course of poli-
tical developments, without ceasing to prepare for the worst. Al-
though it is true that the Spanish socialist party had progressed
somewhat compared with its international colleagues, it allowed
the months to slip by, remaining passive, taking no advantage of
excellent, perhaps decisive opportunities for inﬂuencing the imme-
diate course of national politics and for the futureof the revolu-
tion. But not one of the dominant points of view existing in the
socialist party could understand the necessity of partial struggles.
Those who dreamed of a formula for democratic concord were
afraid of barring the road to this possible solution by antagonizing
the Rights with their audacity. And those who dreamed of the
revolution, which to them was summed up in the single word “in-
surrection” looked down from the heights of their dreams with
nothing but disdain for the partial struggles; they considered the
latter to be of little signiﬁcance, fearing that the ﬁnal triumph
might be compromised by the expenditure of energies in partial
combats. But in view of the advances of reaction there was no
other way out than through the armed insurrection. In this respect
the socialist party cannot be accused of having been too soon or
too late. If the revolution failed, or rather, if at the decisive

inoment in Madrid, there was no insurrection—which according to

many probabilities would have been suﬁicient for victory——this is
because in the decisive days the S. P. policy, ever vacillating be-
tween the insurrection and the hope of a miracle that could have
made possible the establishment of a democratic equilibrium, had
catastrophic consequences. ‘
' :k as »I< *

Lacking the broad revolutionary Marxist conception, the social-
ist party canalized the whole revolutionary movement onto ‘con-
spiratorial grounds, making it solely and exclusively a question of
secret and meticulous preparation of a. coup de main. Allof the
reasonsigiven above pushed the S. P. in just that direction. This
natural inclination was still further stimulated by one of the most
brilliant jewels of international sensationalist literature which put
the ﬁnishing touch to the narrow concept that the S. P. held of
the revolution. We refer to the book Coup d’Etat—-the Technique
of ,Re-2/oluption, by the Fascist writer Curzio Malaparte. The strange
thesis that for the conquest of a modern state, a previously in-
structed minority capable of seizing a few key points, is suﬁicient,
adds toan already sufficiently narrow idea of the revolution, a still
narrower concept of the insurrection. The socialists found their

that has" enlightened contemporaneous thought-~believi~ng that they '

had come into ipossessioni of “Trotsky’s tactics”, as they themselves
stated. Malaparte, it must be noted, attributes to Trotsky the dis-

revolutions irrespective of the political situation or of the masses.

The Malapartist “technique” has not, it is clear, had anyir_npor-
tant effect on the course of the revolt, nor could it have had at
the decisive moment. If we refer to it at all, it is only in order to
point out the extent to which the more solid conceptions of social
revolution had been overshadowed by conspiratorial ideas. No one
proposes to deny the need for trained cadres with deﬁnite objec-
tives. If the insurrection had taken place in Madrid, the militia
would without doubt have been the most important element in the
armed struggle, although not to the extent of making superﬂuous
.the intervention of the great masses. The problem consists in
determining why it was, if an insurrection had been planned, that
so far as Madrid is concerned, it was limited to a general strike
with skirmishes doomed to failure.

In the ﬁrst place, the leadership lacked energy, not daring to
launch the movement in its full intensity. rWhen the order was
given for the general strike it was said that it should commence
peacefully in order to resort to the insurrection afterwards. Such
an order could not have been due to any technical consideration,
which would have been stupid. It reflected» a moment of weakness
on‘ the part of the leadership. In spite of this order having been
given at the last moment it is not likely that it would have been
of much consequence if the militia had been in readiness for action.
Being in complete disagreement with the plan, such an order would
have arrived too late to have inﬂuenced the activity. of the -militia.

But the militia were without arms. The party held on to the
guns until the last moment in the hope that the government crisis
would be solved without the entrance of the Christian-Fascists in
the. cabinet, in which case there would have been no armed strug-

.gle. There were a number of reasons for hoping that the crisis

might be solved in a manner unfavorable to the Rights, although
none of these reasons was a very sure one. The socialist party
placed itself on the sidelines, conditioning the movement on the
outcome of the crisis, without on the other hand, doing anything
toinﬂuence this outcome. aWhen the solution given to the cabinet
crisis became known, the movement was decided upon. But the
task of arming the militia at that time, in the space of a few hours,
was extraordinarily difficult, not to say impossible, especially for
a leadership that was already vacillating on the matter of the
intensity of the attack. It was enough for the armed forces of the
state to come out into the streets, repeatedly searching passersby
and vehicles, in order to cut the movement to pieces. The insur-
rection in Madrid was limited to a long strike, sustained by the
proletariat with exemplary enthusiasm and discipline. .
At the same time in the province of Asturias, the miners pro-
ceeded with extraordinary rapidity and energy to sow demoraliza-
tion and panic among the bourgeoisie, being able actually to gain

control of the entire province. Aside from the inevitable excesses,

there was nothing chaotic about the revolution in Asturias, that is
to say, it was not a movement that had gotten out of control. No ;
the Asturian workers restricted themselves to making the revolu-
tion victorious in their zone. If Madrid had responded in like
fashion, the insurrection, supported by the general strike in most
of the towns, would have gained in extent and depth‘. The proba-
bilities of victory would have been great.

What occurred can be attributed to nothing else than the desire
not to have the proletariat armed in case the leadership, enabled to
ﬁnd a democratic solution, wished to renounce the struggle. This
position, maintained tenaciously and carried to repulsive extremes,
wound up with catastrophic consequences. In the activity of the
S. P. during the preparation for the armed struggle, the most im-
portant consideration was that of assuring the retreat if there were
occasion for it, rather than taking measures to assure victory if a
struggle took place. All of its tactics were motivated by a re-
straining attitude towards the masses.‘ From this emanated its
exclusivist obsession in the question of leadership, its immeasurable
will to control, carried to the point of attempting to control the
uncontrollable, to ﬂinch at what must be dared, to back down for
fear of losing. Under this cloak of exclusion in the leadership
..were concealedno high revolutionary considerations, but prudent
calculation worked out with an eye to possible settlements. The

care thatwas taken to leave no channel open for the revolutionary

spirit of the proletariat, in case the party wished to take refuge in
some compromise formula, ended by closing the road to victory

when the encounter between the classes became inevitable.

We can be certain that there will be many socialists who refuse
to accept this interpretation. But how then are these events to be
explained? How can the fact that the insurrection was limited to
a strike be explained, if the movement commenced precisely under
the circumstances chosen by the leadership and with the uncondi-
tional support of the working masses? VVhere was the catch?
These questions can only be “explained” by unloading the responsi-

bility on one scapegoat or another, by accusing so-and-so of de- '

sertion, another of treachery, etc. Had this been so, had the failure
of the movement resulted from the failure to carry out orders
coming from the leadership, some essential cog in the machine
would have broken down completely. But everyone feels that there
was no such betrayal or desertion. The working class was unable
to act because it was not allowed to prepare itself to do so in
advance. If we add to this the last minute wavering of the lead-
ership, which under other circumstances might perhaps have been
overcome, we have the full explanation of the pitiful spectacle
presented by the revolution in Madrid.
an >1: =1: >9:

The Catalonian developments should be dealt with separately.
Here the leadership was in the hands of the autonomous govern-
ment. Between the government and the workers’ organizations,
or rather the Catalonian workers’ organizations, there was no
connection at all. F urthermore/I the Catalonian working class
movement was divided into two great groups-—the group of organ-
izations -aﬁliated to the VVorkers Alliance, and the C.N.T. The
latter, of its own volition, withheld from the conﬂict entirely.

Relations had been broken off between the auonomous govern-
ment of Catalonia and the central government in Madrid, although
in some regards, the appearances of discipline were maintained.
This situation prevailed as the result of the agrarian law passed
by the Catalonian parliament. The Catalonian reactionaries util-
ized the central government which declared the law annulled. The
autonomous régime however attempted to apply the law in deﬁance
of Madrid. This intransigeance of Catalonia created a situation
that could only be solved by violent means, or else by displacing
the Rights in Madrid and reéstablishing harmony between the two
governments. ~

Objectively, Catalonia was the point most to be feared by Spanish
reaction. The Rights feared it even more than they did the labor
movement itself, for here the enemy was a government that could
count on the support of the urban petty bourgeoisie, of the peasants
who were its stro-ngest support, of the proletariat which while not
adhering to the Catalonian government, did owe its allegiance to
the revolution, and on all of the moral and material resources that
go with state power. Having at its command its own oﬂicial
forces, the support of the overwhelming majority of the population,
and every facility to prepare itself, the revolution in Catalonia
should have been invincible. But to the petty bourgeois composition
of the government can be attributed the reason why Catalonia,
mainstay of the fevolution, was the one to succumb first andwit
the least resistance. i

The agrarian conﬂict over the land cultivation laws went no
further than a discussion on the jurisdiction of the one government
as opposed to the other, a dispute among lawyers, in which the
Catalonian government maintained its positions magniﬁcently, but
without at the same time preparing for the struggle that was in-
evitably approaching for fear of being accused of revolutionary
activities or of assuming a subversive attitude. This attitude was
in radical contrast to the socialist party which had been preparing
many months for the armed struggle, although when the struggle

-did take place such deplorable use was made of the valuable previ-

ous preparations. The Catalonian government held itself strictly
aloof from the labor organizations and even from the peasant
organization that supported it whole-heartedly and with which it
could have no serious differences, in view of the fact that the
peasants only wished -to expropriate the land without indemnifica-
tion. The government wished the peasants to conﬁde blindly in
its benevolence, and to hold ‘their; peace. Upon what forces then
did the Catalonian government expect“ to rely in the struggle? The
answer is not difﬁcult: the ofﬁcial forces und.er its command and
the hope-—founded on weknow not what-—that the army of the
central government would support it. Only thus can one explain

an attitude that in other circumstances. would have been comical.
A" plenary session of the Catalonian Genoralidad, meeting in its
own oﬁicial’ hall, on the 5th of October, proclaimed the Catalonian
Federal Republic . . . and right there the whole Generalidad con-
tinued to sit as if it were functioning in the most normal of times,
sending out calls by radio to a populace which had not armed itself

it ‘ and "which at that particular moment, had no intention of preparing
» for battle.) I . " -

Martial law ‘was declared and thearmy, charged with suppress-
ing the uprising, called on the Catalonian ‘government to capitulate.
This demand was rejected, upon which the army co_mmander an-
nounced without any sign of haste that the government palace

“would be bombarded at dawn. The bombardment took place
' according to schedule and, realizing the ridiculousness and useless-
"ness of resistance, the autonomous government surrendered. In
"different parts of the city small skirmishes took place in which

there were few casualties. Thus the Catalonian movement was
suppressed.
* * * >1!

Let us now look into the role played by the other labor organ-

izations. ‘ Given the absolute hegemony of the socialist party in the

movement, together with its unwillingness to share or concede the
leadership or any part in it, the dilemma became quite clear for the
rest. They could either join the movement, attempting to strengthen
it and give it increased impetus, or else hold aloof from it, which
would have simply meant to betray the revolution. Examples of
both these attitudes were to be seen. The first was the position of
the tendencies making up the VVorkers Alliances, and the second
was the position of the C.N.T. which did not participate in the
V\/orkers Alliances excepting in Asturias.

A W'hy didn't the Wrirkers Alliances play a more important role?

- '\-Vhy did they limit themselves to following the socialist party?

On a number of occasions the doctrinaries of all countries have
accused us of playing not only a pitiful but even a dismal role for
playing up these Alliances that in general have no strength of their
own and no real independence of the socialist party. There was
no one in the Alliances but knew of this situation, but they only
knew that there was only one way of overcoming this dependence.

‘ This could only be by giving impetus to the development of the
Alliances, being willing at the same time to make all the conces-

sions necessarily imposed by the relationships of forces. Step by

‘step the correctness of this position has been demonstrated to the
‘enemies of the Alliances. After having emptied their batteries

against the Alliances, after having attempted to utilize the fact of
the establishment of the united front between the C. P. and the
S. P. in France, in order to set up in Spain also, a direct pact
between Stalinists and socialists, the Spanish Stalinist party a few
days prior to the insurrection ﬁnally decided to enter the rWorkers
Alliances. The C.N.T. placed itself in a similar position, adapting
to the anarchist language the self-same sectarianism. The C.N.T.
ﬁrst condemned the Alliances as a pact among politicians arrived

at -in order to deceive the masses, later it showed itself inclined to

cede on the condition that the united front be limited to trade union
organizations to the exclusion of the political parties. Its original

intransigeance was visibly reduced to the position of a legal form-
-ula,ito an intellectual artiﬁce that might serve as a ﬁg-leaf to cover
_up the abandonment of an erroneous position. The current in favor

of the Alliances gained ground daily in the ranks of the C.N.T.
In deﬁance of its superior committees, the C.N.T. of Asturias
joined the Workers Alliances. If the whole organization on a

--national scale had done likewise, the role played by the Alliances

in the uprising would most certainly have been very different. At
least the C.N.T.Uwould not have covered itself with shame, as it
did during these events, with the honorable exception of Asturias.

The ‘socialists accepted the Alliances inasmuch as this would
extend their authority’ over masses without mortgaging their poli-

.tical independence as leaders of the movement. The overwhelming

majority of the proletariat was already in the socialists’ ranks so

‘that for them‘ the Alliances‘ could be nothing but an addition where-

with to augment their-‘prestige’. On the other hand, to have at-

itempted at this time to alter the relationship of. forces, breaking
’ contact with the socialist ‘party which could easily have been done

by proposing united front-conditions unacceptable to them, would
have shown a desire to waste time to the great detriment of the

revolutionary movement. The experience of those who have at-
tempted to idothis is conclusive, and we are- quite sure that it could
not have been very different even if they had carried on their
propaganda more intelligently. This is why the socialist party,
strong in its organized numerical superiority, was not interested in
carryingthe Workers Alliance movement to its ultimate goal—the

national united front. The dispersion of theexisting Alliances

assured -the socialists of the supportiiof.‘-the“ various tendencies
without need of -making any concessions in the national leadership
of the movement. ‘ The only way in which the socialists could have
been forced into a national united front, with all that this implies,
was to strengthen the Alliances within the limits already accepted
by them—-—local and regional. Then the national united front would
be imposed by the Alliances themselves, and it would be but a
matter of time to decide in what manner this would be established,
whether by a National Congress of the Workers Alliances or by
an agreement among the national committees of the organizations.
Thus the moment would have arrived, as a consequence of their
own development and because of the hold that they had among the
workers, when no party, not even the strongest would be in a
position to counterpose itself to the Alliances without seriously
cracking. But this impetus could only come through the joint effort
of the Left wing, and it is quite clear that the VVorkers Alliances
could not put themselves in shape in time to play an important role
in the insurrection, if during the-nine or ten months of their
existence, they have had to spend in warding off the blows directed
against them by the most considerable sections ‘of that very Left

wing—-the anarchists and the Stalinists. The socialists limited,

themselves to reporting to the Alliances the most important deci-
sions that they had taken, listening to the opinions of the latter,
reserving to themselves the right to accept or reject these opinions.
in those Alliances. where the socialist inﬂuence was greatest, such
criticism as was not accepted by means of a friendly interchange
of views, had no chance of winning by votes.

However it should not be supposed that the role of the Workers
Alliances was nil or of little consequence. They contributed
powerfully to raising the morale of the proletariat, giving it a
palpable and growing idea of unity of action. The only conscious
activity of the workers in Catalonia, assuring them of contact with
the rest of the country, was due to the Workers Alliance. The
slight inﬂuence that the Workers Alliances were able to exert over
the socialist party, was of real beneﬁt, contributing to break down
some of its most dangerous prejudices. Finally, as we have already
said, the only force to remain outside of the Workers‘Alliances
was the C.N.T. whose aloofness has been of such-a nature that we
cannot end this article without saying something about it.

The C.N.T. has gone through this whole period with its back
turned to the danger of the Rights, devoting itself to combatting
the Catalonian government and the socialists. Bearing in mind
only the repressions it suffered in Catalonia and the persecutions
through which it had gone during the ﬁrst period of the republic,
it converted itself into an instrument that could be readily used
for the beneﬁt of reaction.’ It cannot be denied that the most
inﬂuential and least conscious elements of the C.N.T. preferred
the Lerroux régime to the political situation that had existed previ-
ously, although these preferences were covered up by the verbal
repudiation of “all politicians” equally. Badly broken as a result
of its previous actions, the C.N.T. was no longer a danger to the
reactionaries whose principal purpose was to defeat the socialist
party, which for the moment had become the point,of convergence
of the majority of the labor forces. The régime of relative toler-
ance, that the Rightist reaction consciously conceded to the C.N.T.
was suﬂicient to deﬁnitely decide them in. their -ill-concealed pre-
ferences. Wherever its forces were weak the C.N.T. gave a luke-
warm support to the insurrection, but where its forces were great-
est, it gave no support at all. It would seem that what was at
stake in this struggle was not’ the life or death of the labor move-
ment, but rather, they said, a “socialist movement”. -

As a culmination, after such an indescribable attitude, the C.N.T.
attempted on November 7 to declare a peaceful general strike of
24 hours as a protest against two executions carried out in As-
turias. The strike was of no great importance nor could it be in
view of the weakness of the organization. But the date set for
the strike was precisely the day when the legal period following the

state of martial law would normally expire. The government was
able to utilize this unimportant strike as a pretext to extend martial
law for another month. '

On certain details of the attitude of the anarchists, no deﬁnite
opinion can yet be given; but what there can be no doubt at all
about is that, during this period, the anarchist organization was

the most fertile ﬁeld for all reactionary speculation.

FOR A revolutionary movement to be successful, it is absolutely

necessary to have a pre-conceived plan and a general strategy
to be followed out with secondary variations, adapted to the cir-
cumstances of the moment, and that can be worked out only in the
course of the insurrection itself. If this is not the case, not only
does one incur the risk of falling short of the goal, but by taking
a series of measures that have no concrete and well-deﬁned object,
the road leading to victory is likely to be blurred, making impossible
an immediate triumph and setting back to a future period the
hour of proletarian emancipation.

If the Spanish proletariat had heeded these Marxian principles,
it would today be the dominant class in Spain. But the leaders of
the movement, lacking in intelligence and decision did not know
what they were doing. They had no military plan adapted to con-
ditions in the various regions, with the result that they maintained
a waiting attitude, waiting for what might happen in other regions,
and above all, waiting for something to happen in Madrid.

Once again in the history of the labor movement, the petty
bourgeoisie (Esquerra, socialist leadership, leaders of the “Basque
Labor Solidarity”) has shown itself incapable of leading a revolu-
tionary movement to its conclusion. The moment chosen for the
armed uprising was premature; but once commenced, i-t became
necessary to carry it through to the end. The defeat of the revolt
was caused by having maintained a defensive attitude in most
sections of Spain instead of launching an immediate offensive. The
insurrection is not a game for children; it is an art that must be
understood in minutest detail. VVhen two forces meet in battle
formation, it is necessary to know the precise state of morale of
the enemy, his forces" and his plans as well as his weak points in
order to hurl the main attacks of the revolution against them. At
a time when the balance inclines in favor of the adversary, ex-
perienced and intelligent strategists must be able to retreat in an
orderly fashion so as to keep the forces under their command as
intact as possible.

-When the Samper ministry resigned on the night of October 5,
no advantage was taken of the weakness and vacillation of the
ruling class. As soon as the railway workers union of the U.G.T.
found itself incapable of paralyzing traffic, the insurrection was
already lost. It was recognized that the railway strike must be
the backbone of the general strike. The attempt to tie up the
railways having failed due to the suicidal stupidity of the anarcho-
syndicalists, the government was able to mobilize the necessary
materials and personnel for the transportation of loyal troops to
the vital centers of the revolt. The cabinet ministers wept with
joy when they saw that the anarchists were not supporting the
movement, and demoralization was spread among the lukewarm
and semi-sympathetic elements by means of the radio.

The general impression among the reactionary forces and espe-
cially among the Fascist oﬁicialdom that directed the repressive
apparatus of the state, was that if on the night of October 5 to 6
(Friday-Saturday), the insurgents had thrown themselves into the
armed strugglewith determination, the victory of the revolt would
have been inevitable. They also commented that if there were three
Asturias in "Spain, the revolution" would have swept everything
before it. On Friday night it would have been possible to win the
army for the uprising by means of the conspirators among the

army oﬂicers. On the other hand, by Saturday morning this had

already become impossible because the oﬁicers and soldiers involved
in the conspiracy had beenplaced under arrest and the morale of
the troops had altered completely. On this occasion a phenomenon

situation which cannot be of great duration has been created. The
defeat of the working class has not been translated immediately
into a complete victory of reaction, as would certainly have hap-
pened had the insurrection taken place later than it did. The vic-
tory of the government was received very frigidly. This extremely
singular situation must be explained, but such cannot be the purpose
of this article.

army takes an active part in the service of the stronger force.

Fundamentally the Spanish revolution was a sectarian movement
based exclusively on the members of the socialist party. It rested
on Secret Committees instead of basing itself on the most advanced
class; on ofﬁcials of the army instead of on the soldiers and the
revolutionary will of the toiling masses. This sectarian uprising
has brought defeat to the Spanish proletariat, with the particular
circumstance, however, that the labor movement has maintained
itself intact in most localities, due to the fact that the working
class was held in reserve. The proletariat’s energies were not
utilized, it was kept waiting for orders and instructions from the
socialist chiefs-——instructions that never arrived.

The united front organizations, that is, the VVOrkers’ Alliances
with their combat organizations—the workers’ militia-composed
of all proletarian tendencies united for the common purpose of
combatting the enemy class, did not exist excepting in a minority
of localities. And where the Alliances did exist they were as yet
without a history, without a tradition—-—they had not as yet attained
any moral ascendancy over the masses. Asturias, however, was
an exception. Here they played a very important role. In many
places, last minute attempts were made on Friday the 5th, to or-
ganize and popularize the Workers’ Alliances. In such cases,
however, they did not function because neither the leaders, the
militants or the masses had understood the role of these Alliances
beforehand. The role that should have been played by the Workers
Alliances in the insurrection, had been hidden from them. As a
result, the leadership of the movement was in the hands of Secret
Committees, the functions of which were usually concentrated in
the hands of a single individual with very few assistants. There
were cases in which the chairman of the Secret Committee was
arrested on the ﬁrst day, leaving the whole network in the hands
of a couple of comrades who were unacquainted with the arrange-
ments and connections with the other committees, there being
nothing else for them to do but await orders from Madrid and give
evasive answers to all questions asked them.

The discrepancies between the motor forces of the revolution
and the leadership of the movement, became very evident. The
leaders followed democratic will—o’-the-wisps and the masses sought
the social revolution. This is why the former backwatered from
the ﬁrst moment, curbing the enthusiasm of the masses and failing
to call out the troops under the officers who had promised their
support. No party was in a position to reach the masses with an
analysis of the state of the movement throughout the country in
order to counteract the demoralizing inﬂuence of the radio which,
by its lying and biased reports, was one of the best instruments at
the service of the counter-revolution.

The socialist and Basque Solidarian leaders, as well as the
lﬂisqucwa and the Estat Catala, had a mortal fear of the commu-

nist, socialist and anarchist masses. The leaders of all the organ- ,

izations showed their inability to lead the masses. The socialist
‘leaders showed indecision, a low political level and cowardice.
Those of the communist party, with their organizational weakness,
demonstrated their incapacity and tail-endism. The Basque Soli-
darian-s, the Esquerra and the Estat Catala covered themselves
with ignominy and treachery, and the anarchists, wherever they
had greatest influence and control, proved to be traitors with no

-_ O ACCOUNT of the intellect.ual development of Marx would
; be complete- unless it considered l\~’larx's relationship to an
inﬂuential group of G-ermanradical thinkers who called thein-
selves “true”. or “philosophical” communists. So important and
dangerous did Marx regard their views that for years both he
and Engels carried on a ﬁerce polemic against them in the radical
periodicals of the time. This was brought to a climax and ﬁnish
in the specialsection of the C on-miunist Manifesto devoted to “der
deutsche oder der wahrc .S‘ozial»z'snzns"’ (Inc) in which after a
short summary and refutation of their views, .\larx accused the
“true” socialists of being allies of the feudal reaction.
, ..The understanding of the situation is complicated by the fact
ftliat the leading ﬁgures of “true socialism” stood closer to Marx
’and_ Engels than any other radical German group in the ”4o’s. VVe
know that Moses Hess, the chief theoretician of the movement,
iconvertecl Engels to communism, and Zlocisti, Hess’ biographer,
‘claims that Hess was not without influence on Marx, too. More
‘interesting is the, fact that Hess collaborated with Marx in writing
Die demsche Ideologie (1845); part of the manuscript is in his
handwriting. Hess was also an ally of Marx in his struggles
against Bruno Bauer, Ruge, Stirner, and Feuerbach. After the
ﬁrst criticaliwritings of Marx and Engels against “true socialism”

' appeared, Hess avowed himself convinced by their arguments,
' forswore his past literary habits and plunged into a study of poli-

“tical economy (Letter to Marx, July 28, 1846). His essay——Die
,F_0lgen d61”Rc’t'0l1itl0l'l'(l1€S Proletariats (I847)——publishe(l before
the Communist’ Manifesto was written, is Marxian in tone and
analysis, save on some organizational issues. Yet the Communist
Manifesto published early in 1848 unmistakably concentrates its
tire on Hess,’ making allowances neither for the actual develop-
ment of Hess’ views nor for his revolutionary integrity.
Ainother factor which has made it difficult for some to under-
stand Marx’s criticism is the general acknowledgment that, per-
fsfinally, Moses Hess was a man of singular purity of character.

_ Hewas sensitive to every form of injustice, passionate in his devo-

'tion to principles, and almost saintly in his every-day behavior. He

 unable to hate even those who had harmed him. Although

subjected to a life—long poverty, even more grinding than that of
Marx, he never wavered in his allegiance to revolutionary ideals.
,He was very active in the First International where he joined
"forces with Marx against Bakunin. Early in life he broke away
"from his orthodox ‘Jewish home and married a prostitute-—“in
order“ to atone for the evilsociety had done”—-with whom he lived
in  marriage until his death. His friends nicknamed him
“the communist rabbi". ’

_ Both the vehemence and justice of Marx’s denunciation of the
(“true socialists” have been challenged by students of the period.
Koigen,- Hammacher, and Zlocisti* have maintained that Marx
himself was at one time a “true socialist” (about Engels’ “philoso-
’phic"al socialism” there is no question at all), and that historically
there is no more justiﬁcation for believing Hess to be a precursor

of Marxism than for accepting Marx’ characterization of- him.
Mehring. Bernstein, and G. Meyer* do not maintain that Marx
was a “true socialist” but they are unequivocal in stating that’
lfarx and Engels did less than justice to “true socialism” in gen-
eral and to Hessin. particular. Riazanov takes a middle ground;
but Lukacst defends Marx in every particular and even asserts
that far from being a “true socialist”, Marx was not even a genuine
Feuerbacliiaii. I . d
For our purpose it is immaterial whether Marx was a “true

socialist” or whether Hess was a forerunner of Marx. That they\
» shared‘ a great many positions together is indicated by their common

derivation from Hegel and Feuerbach on the one hand, and their
common struggles against other oppositional tendencies on the
other. More important are the differences which manifest them-
selves between them. Even if it should turn out that Marx was
a “true socialist” and that the views he argued against were those
that he himself had earlier embraced, it would still be necessary,
in tracing Marx’s intellectual biography, to consider his criticism

of “true socialism” as self-criticism. ’

~ I
'l"lllEZ PHILOSOPHY OF MOSES HESS
“In Frankreiclz vertritt das Proletariat, in Deutschland
des Geistesaristokratie den Humanismus.”——-HESS/.

“True socialism” was a pseudo-political tendency among a cer-
tain group of literary men, publicists and philosophers in Germany,
all of whom had been influenced by Feuerbach. It was not a
system of thought. In a sense, every “true socialist” had his own

philosophy. Hess, Griin, Liining, Kriege, Heinzen, each developed ,

his position in his own way so that no general exposition can be
an adequate account of all the “true socialists”. If one must
choose a representative of this tendency, there is no choice but to
turn to Moses Hess. He was the recogn-ized leader of the group.
By virtue of his unremitting activity in behalf of revolutionary
ideals, he had. already won the title of the “father of German com-
.n;unism’~’. Unfortunately, the philosophy of Hess is not a uniﬁed
doctrine. It is futile to look! for system or consistency in it. Hess
was by turns a Spinozist, an Hegelian, a Feuerbachian, a Marxist,
a natural science monist, and a combination of them all. It will
therefore be necessary to select for exposition only those of -his
views which Hess held in the Forties and which were in _large
measure shared by his “true socialist” comrades. Marx’s criticisms
will then be more intelligible.

I. The Social Status of the German Intellectual. It was Heine
wlio"ﬁrst. proclaimed that the Germans had succeeded in doing only
in thought what others had already done in fact. This was a
pointed way of saying that although the Germans were lagging
behind other western nations in their social and political develop-
ment, their philosophical theory from Kant to Hegel had already
given an adequate ideological expression of the needs and ideals
of bourgeois society. In Germany proper, however, the bourgeoisie

had not yet come to power and the class relationships were ob-

scured by a host of traditional, religious, sectional and political
factors. The country was predominantly agricultural; the semi-

feudal estates provided a food supply sufficient not only for the

domestic market but for export. Political power was largely con-
centrated in the hands of the nobility. This power had been chal-
lenged by Napoleon in two ways. First, by a direct attempt to
introduce democratic and constitutionalcustoms in those’ parts of

Germany which he had conquered; and second, by the indirect

[effects of theimposition of the Continental system, which by bar- ‘
, ring English manufacturers from Germany called into existence a

German industrial class (cf. Engels, Der Status Qua" in Deutscl:-
land, Marx-Engels Gcsa-mta-usgabe, Sec. 1, Vol. 6, p. 231 ﬁ‘.). With
Napoleon’s defeat the ﬁrst danger was removed——(except for the
promise of a constitution which the Prussian King had made in

,order to spurhis subjects on against the invader). But the second

danger remained. The German bourgeoisie which had grown

‘strong enough to dominate the domestic m.arket during the Napo-
leonic wars, continued to grow. Manufacturing, mining and

shipping were developed on a wider scale. The bourgeoisie de-

-manded a tariff-union (Zollverein) for all the thirty-nine German

states and got it. It demanded a protective tariff for Prussia, and
got that too. At every step, however, it encountered the opposition
of the landed feudal interests whose wealth and power had been
adversely affected, ﬁrst, by the Napoleonic wars which had closed
the French and English markets, second, by the English Corn
Laws,‘ enacted after the restoration of peace, and third, by over-
seas competition in agricultural and grazing products. The strug-
gle between the rising bourgeoisie and the nobility was mediated
by the monarchy which tolerated the bourgeoisie because it in-
creased the national wealth and supplied new sources of revenue.
Politically, however, the monarchy favored the landed nobility
because it feared that the development of industry would force the
surrender of absolutism and accelerate the national uniﬁcation of
Germany. Meanwhile, the consequences of the agrarian reforms
of Stein had increased the number of independent peasant—propri-
etors who, together with the local hand-workers, small tradesmen,
etc., constituted a class of petty bourgeoisie. Its interests were as
much opposed to the large landlords as to the industrial capitalist.
A small, inarticulate and newly created class of proletarians, which
accompanied the growth of industry, suffered an intensive exploita-
tion that often takes place when a country is ﬁrst opened to manu-
facture. ,

In this confused social and political scene, government was
possible only with the help of a great bureaucracy of ofﬁcials who
administered the complicated laws and regulations which grew out
of the conﬂicts of so many different interests. In the course of
time the bureaucracy began to consider itself an independent class
with independent interests. But since by training and origin it was
feudal in outlook, it was unsympathetic to the bourgeoisie. VVith
growing resentment the latter found that the red tape, and the
bribery necessary to break it, were interfering with normal-indus-‘
trial expansion and adding to the costs of production. Its econo-
mic interests demanded the overthrow of the absolute monarchy,
but it was itself so strongly infected with the semi—feudal Smot-
und Stiindes-plzilosojahie that it preferred to truckle to the nobility
and bureaucracy rather than to risk an open ﬁght. Its only possible
allies were the proletariat and a part of the petty bourgeoisie. The
first was too weak, and the second-—in Germany-—more royalist
than the king. And so the German bourgeoisie hoped to win its

much needed reforms not by open class struggle but by (I) involv-

ing the nobility in the net of its investment schemes, (2) by making
the government dependent upon it for its ﬁnances, and (3) by
petitioning the king and his bureaucracy for a liberal constitution
in the name of “social progress”, “humanitarianism”, and “philo-
sophy”. V

It is against this background that the “true socialism” of the
radical German intellectuals must be understood. They were ac-
quainted with the great French socialist writers without having
acquired a clear insight into the class stratiﬁcation of their own
country’ or a consciousness of the speciﬁc needs of the proletariat
as a class.* As a group the intellectuals could only function either
by direct or indirect service with the bur.eaucracy—which meant
going over to outright reaction—or by expressing the demands of
an opposition class. In-the Thirties the Young-Germans and the

‘Young-Hegelians had frankly adopted the point of view of the

German bourgeoisie andhad agitated for all the constitutional
rights which ~England_and France were enjoying. But with the

disintegration of these schoolsof thought and" with the disseitiirla-'3
tion of French socialist ideas, the German-intellectuals lost ¥t_hei’rV~ we
enthusiasm for the bourgeoisie. Instead of continuing with them?"
in a common struggle against the absolutist monarchy, they ‘turned""
all their weapons against bourgeois culture and politics,'ci'iticizing"'

the social consequences of industrial production. In their most
advanced phase they spoke in the name of the proletariat,._b_ut the”
only proletarians they knew were the ones talked a'bout*by the“

I-‘rench socialist writers. Or what was even more confusing, they
sometimes proclaimed that “Das Proletariat ist "die AZl/_Ienssch"hez'l’-'-
(the proletariat is humanity) so that it would appear, as Marxf‘-i

once caustically observed, that in struggling to abolish classes, the-
communists were striving to destroy humanity. -

In fact, whatever revolutionary consciousness developed among"
the German intellectuals took“ place quite independently of the
development of the German proletariat. Hess was not only un-'

acquainted with the German working classes, he was even unaware’ ‘

of the existence of communistic groups among the German workers

in Paris. “VVhen I came to Paris,” he writes, “I was no more -
aware of the existence of communistic groups of German journey- -

men than they were of me.” (S0.zialist'ische Allfséitze, ed. by Z10-
cisti, p. 122.) And Engels in one of- his letters to Marx, writing
of the great interest in communism which he and Hess had suc-

ceeded in "awakening by public meetings, admits that they were‘

winning converts among all classes except the proletariat.

“All of Elberfeld and Barm , from the money aristocracy to
the épicerie, was represented. /Only the proletariat was not there.
. . . Things are going ﬁne. Everyone is talking about communisni,
andwe are winning new followers every day. Wuppertaler ciom’-'
munism is um? 2/érité, yes, almost a force. . . . The dumbest, most"
indolent and philistine of people who are interested in nothing’ in
the world are beginning to become enthusiastic [schwiirmen] about
communism.” (Gesavzntansgaibe, Sec. III, Vol. 2, p. I4.) -

Engels, himself, had already perceived the limitations of a theory 1' 

of communism which took its point of departure from abstract
ethical principles without relating them to the concrete ‘struggles

of the working class. In the preface to his Condition of the Eng- 

HS/L l’Vorkz'ng Class- (1845) he admits that one of the aims of his
book is to put an end to all communist “Pl/z.a.ntastereien nnd
.S‘c/Lroéirnzcrcien pro at contra" and to provide a factual analysis

of the economic realities which were shaping the social destinies '

of the proletariat and determining the conditions of their ‘emanci-

pation. The majority of the radical German intellectuals, ‘how-‘

ever, were insensitive to the existence and i1nporta‘n’ce"-of social’

class divisions. Imbued with the ideals of a perfect society, they"

were unable to join the bureaucracy which adiiiinisteredﬁresent

society. They also refused to make themselves-a vehicle for the"

speciﬁc temporal demands of the bourgeoisie or proletariat. The
only standpoint from which they passed criticism upon society was
an allegedly classless ethics whose values expressedinot the imme- '

diate need of this-or that class but the essential needs of the whole I

of society. They felt themselves to be the prophets of the good’

society whose organization could be deduced from the““t~rue,'ria-*‘5’

ture” of man. They were concerned with the sufferingsof‘ the ,-
proletariat and the disparity which existed between their present 
life and their life as it ought to be. But they "had no conception or‘?

what constituted the proletariat. The proletariat was identiﬁed-

with an abstract category of distress. The “true socialists”’?sy1n‘-',* '
pathized with the proletariat as they would sympa't'hiz'e' with "the"?
cause of any underdog. They claimed to be socialists‘ aslmuch*forv? ’
the sake of the ultimate welfare .of the nobility and bourgeoisie as_ '

for the sake of those whom these classes oppressed.‘

It should now be clear why such a position tended to strengt'hen-"‘

the belief that it was possible to ﬁnd an objective social philosophy"
which was valid for all classes of society. ' '

2. Communism as Hnnlamsm. The philosophy of Hesswas _‘

born of a desire to ﬁnd fundamental principles of social organiza-
tion which would make possible the elimination of all conflict be-
tween man and man, and class and class. Early in his; career, as "
a follower of Spinoza and Hegel, he believed that valid principles
of social order could be derived only from a knowledge of the.
metaphysical structure of existence. The good life is a life based-
upon the insight into the unity and necessity of all things. Virtue
arises from the knowledge of our status and function in the all-
embracing‘ totality called by both Spinoza and Hegel; God. ’ Two-

difficulties, however, compelled Hess to modify his original Spinoz-
ism. First, its contemplative outlook upon life conflicted with his
z:ons.cz7ou.mess that a great many things had to be done, that prob-
lems werepressing for a solution which could not be found by
viewing them sub specie aetcrm'tatiis. Secondly, a consistent Spin-

oaism and Hegelianism seemed; to imply that in the complete vision

of the order and connection of things, everything was blessed with
necessity, and that evil was non-existent. This would call into
question the very reality of the social problems of evil and oppres-
sion which irked Hess’ sensitive nature and which had furnished
the starting point of his whole philosophical enquiry. The practi-
cal upshot of this philosophical ethics was to identify religion with
morality and to make the problems of daily life which confronted
him, unimportant and unfeal.

Hess’ task was now to ﬁnd a philosophy which would justify
the autonomy of moral activity. Like most of the Young-Hegeb
ians, Hess turned to F ichte. The active personality of Fichte, his
early enthusiasm for the French Revolution, and his apparent
social and political liberalism had initiated a kind of Fichte Re-
naissance among the Young-Hegelians. Since it was from him
that Hegel had taken over and developed the dialectical method,
the Young—Hegelians could with good philosophical grace couple
their allegiance to the hero of the AthcismussI1'eit with their school
loyalty to Hegel, the philosopher of the restoration. About the
same time that Hess was writing his pieces in the Rlzelnische
Zeitmzg and his essay, Plzilowplule dcr Tat, Kiippen, the close
friend of Marx, published an article on Fichte med die Revolution
in which he declared: “Now that the impulse to free political
development has again come to life in us Germans . . . the voice of
the purest, most determined, and strongest character among Ger-
man philosophers will be better understood and will ﬁnd a readier
reception than ever beforc.”* Hess, however, was more interested
in grafting l7ichte"s metaphysics of activity upon Spinoza’s doc-
trine of substance (something which Hegel had already done) than
in Fichte’s explicit political doctrines. “Not being but action is
first and last. . . . Now is the time for the philosophy of spirit to
become a philosophy of activity. Not only thinking but the whole
of human activity must be lifted to a plane on which all opposi-
tions disappear. . . . Fichte in this respect has already gone further
than the most recent philosopher.” (Plzilosophie der Tat, Sozial-
istisclie Aufsiitze, p. 37, p. 50.)

In invoking the Fichtean principle of activity to supplement the
Spinozistic doctrine of Substance, Hess was expressing in an

/esoteric way the conflict which he had already described in more

popular fashion as the conflict between religion and morality. The

religious outlook, he contended, was essentially one of acceptance

-—an acceptance of the order of the universe, whether it be called
God, Nature. Reason, or Spirit, of which human beings were a
part, and whose n1ystcrious,and purposive ways could only be
dimly apprehended by faith /and intelligence. The standpoint of
morality, on the other hand, was one of assertion-_—an assertion of
what ought to be and what is not, an imposition of a new order
and not merely the recognition of an old. The root of religion was
man’s feelings; the source of morality was the practical necessities
of life. So long as human beings strive after ideals of perfection,
there can be no completely irreligious men; so long as they live in
society, they cannot be completely immoral. lrreligion is simply a

‘ word for other people's religion; immorality, a term for behavior

different from our own. The essence of religion is worship,‘ the
essence of morality, cozzscientlo1z.sm>.c.s'. ( Religion -mid’ Sittliclzleerit,
ibid., p. 28.)

The conflict between religi<)i1 and morality, Hess went on to say,
can only he avoide<.l if both observed a proper division of labor.
Religion had no business in politics or with the concerns of the
state. It is a private matter——an affair of the individual soul faced
by the immensities of the cosmos. The ﬁeld of politics belongs to
ethics; its object  the general interests of mankind. “Let religion
educate, edify, and elevate the 1'N(.‘l2l'L’I./d'Zlal» soul. Let it support the
weak and console the suffering. But in public life let man show

dependent men.” - ' I
But now Hess found himself confronted by even greater diffi-
culties. If religion could not serve as a basis for social peace, how
could ethics take its place? In aﬂirming the Fichtean principle of
activity, Hess was subscribing to the view that individuality is a
brute metaphysical fact. Principles, cannot act in time and be
acted upon; only individuals can. In the social ﬁeld, individuality
expresses itself in the different personalities whose relationships
constitute the social order. But, if virtue be no more than can-
.S‘L‘»i€7ll"l0’ll.S"n/¢?S.S‘, if each individual is to fulﬁll the law of his own
nature, what is the guarantee that social peace and freedom can be
secured? Hess is asking how genuine social morality is possible.
A social morality based upon convention or contact between per-
sonalities breaks down as soon as an individual or a group becomes
sufficiently powerful to violate the compact with impunity.‘ A
social morality based on authority or revelation is compatible with
the autonomy of moral action. Yet a social morality must be
grounded on some objecti-zze order. It cannot be the order of na-
ture. And at this point, Hess turns to Feuerbach. Morality must
be grounded on the “true” nature of the human species—on Man
viewed not as a series of isolated individuals or as one abstract
universal--Hum.anity——-but as a living unity whose different parts
have developed from a common source and which are bound to-
pether by a feeling of natural kinship. But man cannot live as
man—and here Hess improves on Feuerbach-—unless he recognizes
that his human needs require new institutions; that all the social
and political conflicts of the past and present have grown out of
the root evils of private property; that. money plays the same role
in distorting man’s practical life that religion plays in distorting
his intellectual life. Having read Proudhon and the Utopian

French socialists, Hess tries to link up their conclusions with I

Feuerbach’s method: ,

“The essence of God, says Feuerbach, is the transcendent es-
sence of man, and the re-al theory of the divine nature is the theory
of human nature. Theology is a-nthropology. That is the truth,
but it is not the whole truth. The nature of man, it must be added,
is social, involving the cooperative activity of all individuals for
the same ends and interests. The true theory of man, the true
humanism is the theory of human society. In other words, anthro-
pology is socia-lism.” (Loc. cit., pp. 115-116.)

The logical corrolary of this position was that the struggle for
human freedom and social security must be waged not in the name
of the proletariat, but in the name of humanity.

3. Communism as the Ethics of Love. The speciﬁc content
with which Hess ﬁlled this abstract humanism is not hard to guess.
It was a variant of the Feuerbachian ideal of love. Although the
full realization of communism depended upon the existence ot
certain social conditions (about whose nature Hess at this stage
was rather vague), communism as an ideal was already implicit
in every altruistic tendency which stirred within the -human breast.
The historical development of society, he held, may be legitimately
viewed as a result of the conflict of two great passions-—egoism,
manifested in individual self-assertion against others, and love, as
expressed in all action inspired by the consciousness. of the essen-
tial identity of the individual with mankind. Egoism or selﬁshness
is the ﬁnal source of all social oppression and exploitation. Cruelty,
fraud and robbery, feudalism, chattel and wage slavery, pauperism
and prostitution are possible only because men draw a circle around
themselves and their nearest of kin, and focus attention so strongly
upon the ﬁeld of their immediate vision that they become indif-
ferent, and ultimately blind, to the interests and the very existence
of those who live beyond the line. Social institutions are such as
to place a premium upon selﬁsh behavior. And although this be-
havior is hedged in by rules of law imposed by the state, these
rules themselves represent the organized selﬁshness of dominant
groups. Capitalism or “the system of free competition is the last
wortl of egoism”. It distorts and perverts every phase of culture-—
religion, art, education———by substituting for the ideals of -the col-
lectivity, private _interest and private satisfaction ascontrolling
factors. ‘ . ' ‘ 1

to theoretical principles of love and humanity, freedom and equal-
ity. The more altruistic their declaration, the more consistent-—

as the history of the English and French bourgeoisie illustrates-—
. their egoism. The fact, howeverf that in order to move great

masses into action, vehement lip-service to _the ideals of love and
lumiarz-ity is. necessary indicates that “the real nature of man” re-
cognizes that these ideals alone are ultimately valid and yearns for
their fulﬁllment. But they can only befulﬁllecl when, private
property and the arbitrary power which its possession gives over
other human beings, is abolished. “Communisrn is the law [Leberz.s-
gesete] of love applied to social life.” It is not enough to preach
love to realize communism, as Feuerbach-does; nor can it be
brought about by preaching hate. Lovemust be organized into
action; recognition of the identity of the real interest of all man-
kind must be carried over into every phase of personal and social
life:

“You have been told that you cannot serve two masters at once
-—God and Mammon. But we tell you that you cannot serve either
one of them, if you think and feel like lmmcm beings.‘ Love one

another, unite in spirit, and your hearts will be ﬁlled with that‘

blessedness which you have so vainly sought for outside of your-
selves, in God. Organize, unite in the real. world, and by your
deeds and works you will possess all the wealth, which you have
sovainly sought, in money. So long as you do not strive to develop
your own nature, so long as you strive to be not human but super-
human and iu.lmma11. creatures, you will become inhuman, you will
look down contemptuously upon human nature, whose real nature
you do not recognize and treat ‘the masses’ as if they were a wild
beast. The beast which you see in the people is in yourself.”
(Ueber die N at in unserer Gesellschaft Mﬂd» deren. Abhilfe, Sozial-
istische Aufséitze, p. 149.)

Hess left it unexplained how this belief in the essential unity of
mankind could be reconciled with his characterization.of those who
did not share his belief. Perhaps it is too much to expect this of
one whose ﬁrst interest was not in social analysis———but, like the old
Hebrew prophets, in social justice.

If anthropologically, communism was humanism, and ethically it
was humanitarianism, it followed that the appeal to action would
be framed not in terms of material interests but in terms of cul-
ture,‘ creative activity, peace, honor, justice, and other ideal goods.
The “true socialists” took the ﬁeld against all those who pretended
that the communist movement was exclusively or even primarily a
movement of the proletariat, and who spoke as if its demands
centered around the needs of the stomach. Howcould communists
preach the ideal of classlessness and still appeal to one class against
another? How could the ideal values of communism be regarded
as the concern only of the proletariat when they really flowed from
the real nature of man? Hess admitted, to be sure, that in France
the movement was proletarian, but he explained this by saying that
the French proletariat was communistic “not out of egoism but out
of humanity”. The proletariat becomes communistic out of love
of mankind. But why should one, asks Hess, who out of love of
mankind is already a communist, regard himself as a proletarian?
And in fact there are communists who are not proletarians and
there are proletarians who are not communists. All that one can
say is that since the proletariat suffers most from the effects of
organized egoism..(which Hess identiﬁes with capitalism) it is
more likely than any other group to feel and understand the unity
of mankind, and the necessity of establishing communism to realize
it. Hess makes a point of correcting Lorenz von Stein, an Hegel~
ian of the cei1ter,wl1ose book, Der Sozialismus and Kommum's11ms
des heutigen Frankreich (1845) introduced, _so to speak, the
theories of Frenchsocialism to the German public. Despite his
reactionary tendencies, Stein had made some surprisingly realistic
analyses of the French revolutionary movement. He had grasped
the importance of the class struggle in French history and had
distinguished between the “proletariat” as an historical category
bound up with capitalism and the “poor” and “unfortunate” to be
found in any society.* Hess insists that Stein has given a mislead-
ing account of communism. “It is an error——and this error is due

to the egoistic narrowness ‘which cannot rise to a truly humaun -

a outlook-—yes, it is an error diligently spread by the reaction, and
by Stein above all, that socialism develops only among the prole-
tariat, and among the proletariat only as a question of fulﬁlling
the needs of the stomach.” (Sozialistzkclze Attfsiritze, p. 129.)

Socialism is not a question of bread, although it may be that,‘ too.
It is in the ﬁrst instance a question of man, of moral values, es-
pecially of human dignity. These values Hess formulates different~
1;: at different times. Sometimes it is simply trutiz which is the

communist ideal; only under communism will social parasitism_
and the civilization of lies based on itdisappear. Sometimes it is F

creative work in which effort and enjoyment will always be found
together. Sometimes it is character or virtue, deﬁned, by Hess, as
the “freedom to follow the law of one’s own life” (and which
dangerously approaches the ideal of bourgeois freedom). But
through the entire scale of ethical variations developed by Hess,
there sounds one fundamental theme: the social revolution presup-
poses a moral revolution. . i

4. “True Socialism” as Reactionary Socialism-. Had the “true
socialists” restricted themselves to declarations of brotherly love,
they probably would have been remembered only as another
Utopian socialist sect. But they prided themselves upon having
advanced beyond their master, Feuerbach. If thinking ﬂowers in
action, then political thinking must concern itself in the most inti-
mate way with the contemporary issues of politics. As has already
been indicated, the German bourgeoisie was struggling against the
nobility and bureaucracy for the democratic rights already enjoyed
by the bourgeoisie in France and England. The “true socialists”,
posted on French communist theory, knew that in a bourgeois
democracy the proletariat was exploited even more openly than in
an absolute monarchy, that the formal rights of press, assemblage,
trial by jury, etc., could not be effectively exercized where glaring
social inequalities prevailed. Speaking, then, for the proletariat——
for the future of humanity—the “true socialists” repudiated-the
demands of the bourgeoisie, attacked their spokesmen as hypocrites,
and succeeded in confusing the intellectual strata of the petty
bourgeoisie who had regarded the change from an absolute mon-
archy to a constitutional republic as genuine social advance.

In this crusade against bourgeoisliberalism the chief offender
was not Moses Hess but Karl Griin and after him, Otto Liining.
But Hess was not without faults. He paraded an indifference to
the political program of the democrats and was quick to accuse
them of compromise, insincerity and cowardice. Even communists
were suspect if their origins were bourgeois. The badge of ' real
ethical purity was proletarian. “Most communists,” he wrote,
“who stem from the bourgeoisie go no further than general ‘phrases
and attempts at compromise [between the older order and the
new]; it is only the proletariat which carries things to a decisive
break with the existing order.” (Rlzeinisclze Jahrbiichcr, Vol. II,
1846, p. 65.) F '

Hess maintained that the real cause of social distress was eco-
nomic and to agitate for political reforms was therefore a waste of
time. All governments, except revolutionary ones, were indifferent
to the welfare of the proletariat. Addressing German liberals, he
wrote: . . T I ‘

“Has the King of Prussia shown less concern for the misery of
the poorer classes than the French Assembly or the French king‘?
So convinced are we by reflection upon the facts and upon the
real causes of social distress that this is not so, that all liberal
political strivings appear to us as immaterial, even as downright
disgusting” (formlich gum Ekel geworden sind). V F I

It was Karl Griin, however, the man upon whom Marx poured ‘
out the vials of his wrath, who formulated the anti—liberal attitude ’
of “true socialism” most sharply. The promise of a constitution.‘

which the King of Prussia had made in 1815 was long overdue.
At every opportunity, the bourgeoisie reminded him, his counsel-
lots, and his successor, of his unredeemed pledge. Every incident
of domestic unrest was capitalized by bourgeois and liberal opinion

to point out that constitutional safety-valves of popular resentment l

were better than none. T-he clamor for a constitution became
particularly strong after the revolt of the Silesian weavers. It was
in ‘answer to this that Griin wrote:

“Who in Prussia wants a constitution? ‘The liberals. ‘Who are '

the liberals? People who sit within their four walls, and some
littéraz‘eu_rs who either themselves own property or whose horizon

 

  
  

Page 144

is bounded by the wishes of "the worthy factory owners. Does this
handful of owners with their literary hacks constitute the people?
No. Does the people desire a constitution? Not in its dreams.
. . . Had the Silesian proletariat a consciousness . . . it would pro-
test against a constitution. The proletariat has no consciousness
but we . . . act in its name. We protest.” (Ib2'd., Vol. I, p. 98-I00.)

Liining was more interested in awakening the proletariat to its
great mission of social salvation than in drawing it into supporting
the political demands of the bourgeoisie. “There is only one way
of making the proletariat conscious of its humanity, that is through
the organization of education.” (Dicses Buch gelziirt dem V olke
[a periodical], Vol. II, 1846, p. Io2, quoted by Speier, loc. cit., p.
126.) And so the “true socialists”, each in his own way, helped
the reactionary nobility in its struggle to retain sole political su-
premacy in Germany.

5. C ommimism and Nationalism. Hess was the first socialist of
his day to link up the question of nationalism with the theory of
communism. Nationalism is of two varieties, just as internation-
alism is of two varieties. True nationalism, which may be deﬁned
as pride in the distinctive character of local culture, has been per-
verted into the false nationalism of modern states by the institution
of private property. So long as competition andvwar between indi-
viduals prevail within communities, it is inevitable that the same
principles be applied by the organized groups which constitute
states in their relations with each other. The struggle between
nations takes more gruesome forms——-wars, massacres, etc.-—than
the struggle between individuals within the nation, because there
is no consciousness of common ties of local culture to diminish the
cruelty towards others called forth by a conﬂict over the means of
life. just as it is necessary to’ ﬁnd a rule to regulate the distribu-
tion of goods within the coinmunity in order to give each one an
opportunity to develop his personality, so it is necessary to ﬁnd a
rule which will apply between nations so that each nationality will
be able to develop its distinctive culture. “The problem of the
elimination of national hate is intimately bound up with the problem
of egoistic competition. International war cannot cease until indi-
vidual war, competition, ceases. All the problems, all the difficul-
ties, all the contradictions which have arisen in this country, flow
out of-this fundamental question.”*

Commercial nationalism generally gives rise to a spurious renais-
sance of national culture. Everything becomes “national” and
therefore the concern of the true patriot, e.g., “religion and a pro-
tective tariff for monopoly enterprises; freedom and cotton;
mediaeval ruins and modern industry; gravestones and railroads."

In this way. national cultures which are the bearers of unique‘

value, become claimants to total and exclusive value. They no

longer are content to live peacefully side by side faithful to their '

own national genius and yet tolerant of others; they seek to impose
their own culture upon others in the name of a militant and holy
nationalism. They thereby destroy not only the unique value of
other cultures but their own.

False nationalism breeds a false intcrnationalism——cosmopo1itan-
ism. True internationalism recognizes the necessity of distinct
cultures and nations. “But only the individual is real”, and nation-
ality is the individuality of a people. It is no more possible for
humanity to exist without particular peoples and nations than to
exist without particular individuals.

Like most of his contemporaries Hess had a strong belief not
only in the existence of national traits and character, but in their
ﬁxity. National traits may be an historical product, but the kind
of development which is possible to each nation is determined by
its essential nature. The German is essentially contemplative, the
Frenchman passionate, and the Englishman practical. These
traits will be found reflected in their revolutionary movements too.
The German is a comnmnist out of philosophy; the Frenchman, out
of his strong feeling for justice; the Englishman, because of ma-
terial interests. All three elements are necessary; but in the strug-
gle for socialism, the Frenchman will give the signal for actions}

6'." Trdnst'tion.to Realism. It wouldbe a. great injustice to Hess '

to close the exposition of his thought at this point. For his “true
socialism” phase lasted only a few years. By 1847 Hess had al-
ready abandoned his appeal to humanity and the essential nature of

man and had undertaken a study of political economy. His essay,‘

Die Folgen ides Revolution des Proletariat, no longer speaks of
ideal presuppositions of communism but of material conditions,
not in terms of the development of the spirit of humanity but of
the development of productive forces. In this essay of Hess will
be found, with a clarity and precision quite foreign to his other

writings, the theory of the concentration and centralization of‘

capital, the theory of increasing misery, the theory of overproduc-
tion to account for the periodicity of crises, the-doctrine that the
collapse of capitalism is inevitable, and the view that the develop-
ment of revolutionary consciousness is a simple and direct out-
growth of economic distress—theories which were to receive
classic formulation, together with a denunciation of “true social-
ism”, a few months later, in the Communist Manifesto. The
change in tone and subject matter is so striking that mere para-
phrase cannot convey it. I quote therefore some characteristic
passages.

“A revolution of the proletariat presupposes before all things
the existence of a proletariat-—-presupposes a struggle, not merely
about abstract principles but about concrete and tangible interests,
presupposes thatthe very existence of the great majority of the
workers is threatened, that these workers know who the enemy is
they have to ﬁght, and that they have the means in their own
hands to achieve victory.‘ . . . It remains to ask what must social
relations be in order to produce uniform oppression of the workers
as well as the instrument of their liberation? . . . We have already
indicated how free competition—in the last instance free-trade-
makes wages equal. But before free competition can reach the
highest phase of its development . . . a certain series of economic
facts must precede it. . . . Machines must be discovered, instru-
ments of production must be perfected and multiplied, work must
be subdivided, more must be produced than consumed, business
crises must arise as a result of overproduction and threaten to
ruin an entire country in case the obstacles which remain in the
way of industry are not removed. . . . Once social relations have
reached this revolutionary height, nothing can stop the proletarian
revolution. All measures to revive and develop private interest are
at last exhausted. . '. . It is large industry which, as we saw, in the
last ‘instance provides. the means and conditions for the overthrow
of the existing social order based upon private industry, private

trade, and private property. It is large industry which creates a '

revolutionary class and-uniﬁes it against the ruling bourgeoisie.
It is large industry which makes the proletariat subjectively con-
scious of the necessity of shaking off its yoke in that it gives the
proletariat a consciousness of its position. . . . What fetters pro-
duction today? The business crises? How do crises arise?
Through overproduction. Why is more produced than can be
consumed? Have, then, all the members of society more than
enough of what they need? By no means, most of them lack the
barest necessities of existence, not to speak of everything else
which man needs for the development of his natural dispositions
and capacities. . . . Why, then, this overproduction, this distress in
the midst of plenty? Well we have seen: the more progress private
industry makes, the more capital accumulates in private hands, the
more those who are propertyless are compelled to sell their personal
labor power [Arbeitskrdfte] in order to secure the necessary means
of life. "The worker, however, who is compelled to sell himself or
his labor power, becomes a commodity. Its value obeys the same
economic laws as other commodities.” (Sozialistische Aufsiitze, pp.
215-216.)

It remains to ask where Hess derived these views, especially
since in some of his later writings, the echoes of his earlier doc-

trines are still to be heard. There can be no question but that Hess .

read Ricardo and the Ricardian socialists in -the light of Marx’s

views as expressed in the Anti-Prouidhon. It is a legitimate infer- I

ence that these views weretlevelopedi for Hess by Marx.in their

last period of collaboration.‘ As we proceed" to Marx’s criticism of ’

Hess, it is necessary to bear constantly in mind that for all his
dislike of the personal characters of Marx and Engels, after 1847
Hess regarded himself as a Marxist. ‘ . = . r

THE NEW “NEW INTERNATIONAL”

EARLY this month, a joint fusion
convention of the Communist League of
America and the American iWorkers
party launched the Workers party of the
United States. The new party is dealt
with elsewhere in this issue and requires
no detailed comment here. The assembled
delegates voted to publish an oﬂicial
weekly organ, The New Militant, and to
adopt THE NEW INTERNATIONAL as the
monthly theoretical review of the Work-
ers party. Beginning with the new year,
therefore, our magazine will appear as
the oﬂﬁcial publication of the new party,
devoting itself essentially to the theoreti-
cal and scientiﬁc problems of the working
class movement and putting forward the
revolutionary Marxian doctrine of our
party.

The party has designated as editors of
the magazine comrades Max Shachtman
and John iWest, with comrade William
Duncan as business manager.

With the founding of the new party,
which represents a concentration of the
advanced revolutionary forces in this
country, who have already succeeded in
attracting to the party a number of mili-
tants who were previously unattached, or

‘else members of other organizations, the

 $h\¢r\4v\4r\4v\uov\cr\4v\av\at\¢o\4¢\¢c\4v ..us..u\--‘us.-‘..\..‘4rs4.\..rs._.,.~,_

prospects for our review are greatly en-
hanced. The gratifying reception with
which it has met up to the present will
now certainly be extended into new ﬁelds,
so that we shall be able in increasing
measure to reach new hundreds and even
new thousands of readers.

In harmony with these prospects, we
intend to make the review even more at-
tractive than it has been up to now. In
addition to dealing with the more direct
problems of the working class, with
polemics, with theoretical questions, THE
NEW INTERNATIONAL will henceforth
strive to reflect more systematically the
topical questions of the American class
strnggle—both in the economic and poli-
tical ﬁelds. Furthermore, we intend to
aim at dealing with subjects of even more
universal interest——the cultural and scien-
tiﬁc world. We shall not write on such
themes merely because they deserve being
written about, but only when the contri-
butions made are of a quality which merit
printing.

Another point in our policy which will
be of interest to our readers is the fact
that we do not.’ intend to print only such
articles as ' ritten by members of the
new party, or ‘ {ily from the strict stand-

\

point of the party’s principles. As the
occasion offers itself, we aim to invite
contributions also from critics or oppon-
ents, without thereby converting our re-
view, which has a point of view and ad-
heres rigidly to it, into a loose open for-
um. This invitation will be extended
particularly in cases where the subjects
dealt with are of a nature which still de-
serve or require thorough discussion in
the movement itself.

We want to make THE NEW INTERNA-
TIONAL the outstanding review of revolu-
tionary Marxism, at least in the English-
speaking world. The multiplication of
the forces now behind our review will
surely facilitate the attainment of this
goal. For our part—the part of the edi-
tors and the contributors—-we shall do all
in our power to produce a satisfactory
publicatiorr..;. ‘The rest depends entirely
upon our body of loyal readers and
friends. We are counting on their sup-
port, on their subscriptions, on their dis-
tribution of the magazine, on their ﬁnan-
cial aid whenever it is necessary—and it
always is. VVe feel conﬁdent that you,
reader, will do your part.

VOL. I

DECEMBER 1934 p A _ ~ , , NO. 5

The WoI'kersPartyIs Founded

T HE WORKERS party of the U. S. did not emerge suddenly
from nowhere. It was born of the merger of the Communist
League of America and the American Workers party, itself the
outgrowth of the Conference for Progressive Labor Action. Each
organization took pride in its past. It did not disown that past in
coming into the merger. Rather did each organization by its par-

_ ticipation in the merger bear witness to its appreciation of the

history of the other.

Before launching on the main theme of this article, two observa-
tions. on the signiﬁcance of the merger may be made. In the ﬁrst
place, a nun ber have asked the querwon, Why is l.’ that precisely
the group which has been most concerned about theory, and on the

' other hand, the group ‘vhich has been most “activist” have got

together? sWithout entering now into a discussion as to the exact-
ness of the description here employed, it may be pointed out that
atone point in the evolution of the movement, the elaboration of
theory may be the prime need, and at another the application of
theory in action. However, there cannot be, and never is, a divorce
between sound theory and sound practise. A group which devotes
itself to‘ the discussion of theory in the Marxian sense does not do
it for the sake of agreeable mental exercize, as an alternative per-
haps to working cross-word puzzles. It is concerned with theory
because it needs tq know how to act and will not act on a merely
opportunistic basis. Elaboration of theory leads, therefore, to
practical work in the labor scene. On the other hand, a group
which seeks to act in a responsible and not an adventurist spirit in
the revolutionary movement, which is concerned about ultimate and
not merely about immediate aims, may indeed scorn Talmudic
theologizing and debates which lead simply to more debates; but it
cannot be indifferent to theory. It can render a service which the
trade union bureaucrats, for example, cannot render, not merely
because its members may individually be more honest or self-sacri-
ﬁcing, but chieﬂy because it has a clear conception of the economic
and political system, the role of the working class, etc., and there-
fore can thread its way through the complex maze of events." T_ hat
is to say, it must fall back on theory. If it does not ﬁnd theoretical
questions answered by any existing political party it must hammer
out theory for itself and build a new party. Thus the fusion'i,of
the C.L.A. and the A.*W.P. was not accidental. Moreover, the
fusion will bear fruit which neither group by itself could have
produced. ,

Another question which has been raised is, Why is itthat the
most “internationalist” and the most “nationalist” group got to-
gether? The ﬁrst comment on that question is naturally that one
cannot believe everything he reads in the papers, especially in the
Daily W orker. Seriously, the point of the revolutionary interna-
tionalism of the C.L.A. has been that it is a fatal error to make the
laying of the foundations of the socialist economy in the Soviet
Union and the socalled “defense of the Soviet Union” the almost
exclusive concern of the revolutionary movement; that the defense
of the Soviet Union itself today depends upon the growth and
victory of revolutionary parties in capitalist countries and that
energy must be concentrated on that task. When the A.VV.P. has
insisted that the revolutionary movement must be built in the United
States it has done this, not with any notion that a revolutionary
movement could be national in character, but precisely because it
was so deeply concerned that the working class of the United States
should do its part in the world revolutionary movement. It in-
veighed sometimes against sentimentality and romanticism about
labor internationalism because it was so deeply concerned about
building the international revolutionary movement realistically and
so avoiding a repetition of the tragic débacle which overtook the
movement in 1914 with the outbreak of the war and again in 1932
under the onslaught of Fascism in Germany and elsewhere. Again,

therefore, the merger is the correct and natural outcome of the
history of the two groups.

The merger also signiﬁes that we are'not slaves to the past. Our
faces a.re set to the future. We go to meet the test of action.

Objective conditions vary in different countries; the ‘working
class is at different stages in its evolution. Consequently the
crucial issue before the revolutionary party is not the same in
different countriesor at different periods. The trade union issue is
the master issue in the United States today. By the manner in
which it meets that issue the \/Vorkers party will justify or stultify
itself in the initial period of its existence.

Reactionary employer interests and the “liberal” Roosevelt ad-
ministration are well aware of the fact that it is over the right of
workers to organize and bargain collectively, in the organizing
campaigns and strike struggles of the past two years, that capital-
ism and the working class are locking horns today in the 1.7.5. By
might’ and main, by direct; and brutal or indirect and subtle means,
they seek to prevent organization, to build company unions, to
postpone the issue over Section 7a of N.R.A. to prevent strikes, to
break them, and where unions are formed to confuse the member-
ship and corrupt the leaders so that the unions may not become or
remain genuine instruments of struggle. _

VVithout in most cases thinking the problem through,‘ with wrong
or incomp-lete theory perhaps, if they have any at all, the masses of
the workers also sense the signiﬁcance of the conﬂict. And this
includes‘ not a few white-collar, professional and technical workers,
who until "recently hardly thought of themselves as “workers” at
all. They are ﬁghting for bread and butter of course. What else
should starving men and women ﬁght for? But they sense the need,
for power‘ in order to get bread; they know that power comes from
organization; they ﬁght magniﬁcently and starve in order to get
recognition of their union. In the room in which Okey Odell, the
Ohio onion str_ike_ leader, lay recovering from his wounds last

August, surrounded‘ by armed union members determined to ﬁght

it out with any vigilantes who might try to seize him again, a
special guard stood before the federal union charter these onion

,w_orkers had received from the A. F. of I... pledged to die before
"they would permit it to be taken away!

In ‘certain more sophisticated quarters of the labor movement,

there are those who do not see what is plain to the capitalists and

politicians on the one hand and the working masses on the other.
The avowed social democrats and the unavowed ones, including
some of those who regard themselves as devotees of the “American
approach”, think of course that the class struggle is fought pri-
marily and mainly at the polls. One of them recently remarked
that Upton Sinclair in his EPIC campaign for governor of Cali-
fornia had carried the class struggle in that state to the highest
point it had ever reached, and did not even mention the marine
workers’ strike that raged up and down the Paciﬁc coast last sum-
mer, and the. general strike in the San Francisco area! No, not

.Upton.on his -soa.p—box but Tom Mooney in jail is still the symbol

of the class struggle in California.

-At the other extreme are doctrinaries and Leftists to whom the
unions, especially those in the A. ll’. of l.., are company unions,
Fascist unions, “bulwarks of capitalism", etc. Until recently at
least the C. P. held to this estimate and proceeded to do its utmost
to divide the working, class by building its own sectarian, paper
“industrial" unions. Others holding this estimate stand in holy
aloofness from the present struggles of the workers and -their ill-
advised attempts to organize, perhaps condescending to lift up
their voices to preach the one -true doctrine to deaf ears. Those
with syndicalist leanings may participate actively and courageously
in strike struggles, but they will have nothing to do with the unions
which conduct or grow out of these strikes. Some day, they feel

blissfully certain, objective conditions will compel the workers to
rise spontaneously, to turn their backs suddenly upon the past and
its misguided struggles, and to put over the revolution.

To reject these attitudes does not mean that we accept the
present leadership of the A. F. of l..., its structure, its policies, its
attitude toward employers and government. For the Marxist that
is even more impossible than it was at an earlier period. The
unions cannot in the period of capitalist decline fulﬁll the func-

” -tions, achieve the gains for the workers, that were possible when

capitalism was still able to give substantial concessions at least to
large sections of the population. The class-collaboration philoso-
phy becomes more dangerous as the capitalist crisis deepens, will
prove fatal if it prevails as that crisis reaches its.crimax.

The struggle of the unions against the employing class and the
government is genuine and has a progressive character, therefore,
only in the degree that within the unions the struggle against the
bureaucracy and its policies goes on. This intra—union struggle
can be effectively waged by the rank and ﬁle, the progressive and
Left elements, only if they are organized. VVl1o shall lead and
inspire in this struggle and the organization for it, if not the
politically developed, the theoretically trained workers? In other
words, the revolutionary party? Correctly, therefore, the \~‘Vorkers
party of the U. 5. places in the forefront of its Program of Action
for the next six montlis the organization of the Left-progressive
wing in the unions. g
' Neither the socialist party as a whole nor any section of it
worth mentioning has a clear conception of the crucial nature of
this task. In effect, therefore, they all strengthen the hands of the
trade union bureaucrats and, so far as they have inﬂuence, commit
the movement to a non.-1ni.lit:mt and reformist attitude. The Right
wing has of course always served the union ofﬁcialdom in exchange
for votes and jobs as “.labor lawyers”, etc. At the Detroit conven-
tion they fought bitterly against even a mild. censure of the A. F.
of L. leaders. Today they are openly seeking an alliance with the
unions under their present leadership in a Labor part_v—-to the
Right of where the S. P. has supposedly stood.

, Meanwhile the adolescent and unrealistic character of the leader~
ship of the various shades of “Militants” is clearly illustrated by
the fact that they engage in most violent shadow-boxing with the
Right wing over the “united front” with the C.P. (or that poor
relation of the C. P., Lovestonc, of whom the R.P.C. is in turn a
poor relation) and over what they are going to do, or think they
are going to do, when war or the revolution co1nes~—-but back down
before the Right wing on the trade union issue, the test of the
revolutionary realist today. The Militants do not concentrate on
huilding_ the Left-progressive wing in the unions. They concentrate
on getting posts in the unions which, in the absence of 21 Left—
progressive wing under the leadership of revolutionary forces, can
only result in the l\/lilitants becoming assimilated to the trade union
bureaucracy, as has happened often enough in previous years. It
is inconceival-)le that the workers, the miners, e. g., or the steel

A workers, who know the union situation from the inside and whose

very livelihood in many instances depends literally upon the out-
come of thestruggle against the union bureaucracy, can long fol-
low such leadership, can postpone joining the :VVorl<ers party and
thus assisting most effectively in building the Left wing in the

 unions.

The unions are instruments of struggle, agencies of collective
bargaining, etc. within the capitalist system. By themselves, they
are not revolutionary instruments. In fact, left to themselves they

 become “pure and simple"", degenerate into rackets, fail even as

collective bargaining agencies. ‘What transformations, revolution~

ary changes, new formations, may occur in the economic organiza-

tions and the economic struggle, as on the one hand the economic

offices; in union halls; on the picket lines; on the streets of Toledo,
Minneapolis, Milvvaukee, San Francisco, the steel and textile and
automobile and mining towns, that struggle rages and will rage in
the months ahead. Build the unions; organize the workers; develop
their militancy; broaden, deepen, intensify, politicalize the day—to-
day struggles; ﬁght the bureaucrats; build the Left-progressive
wing~—this is the program of revolutionists today, the program of
the VVorkers party.

The socalled communist party has clearly demonstrated how
such a program should NOT be carried out. Abandoning the con-
ception of party democracy and workers democracy completely,
the C. P. has espoused a mystical, absolutist, utterly un-Marxian
conception of a party which can do no wrong, which stands out-
side and above the w rking class. (From this to an absolute ruler
over the party itself is only a step.) This leads to a fatal lack of
faith in, actual contempt fo-r, the working class. It ﬁnds expres-
sion in the theory of social-Fascism (working class organizations
that do not accept our domination are Fascist); in united—front-
from~below manoeuvres (these stupid asses will not see through
our clever scheme to crush them) ; in using strong-arm methods to
break up the meetings of other labor groups; in “capturing” unions
and other mass organizations by political trickery or main force;
in manipulating union machinery so as to put party members in
oiiice; in calli1i_g‘strikes and telling the workers what the strike is
about after they get out on the sidewaik. At this very moment we
are seeing another ludicrous and yet tragic illustration of, what
‘this attitude leads to. Members of independent building trades
unions fostered bythc C. P. are in open revolt against the party
which, after years of building separate sectarian, often paper,
unions all along the line, has suddenly realized the futility of that
course and miiw proceeds quite as mechanically and dictatorially to
try to liquidate every independent union it can lay its hands on,
regardless of the circumstances which gave it birth, its mass base
or the will of the membership!

The W'orkers party will not utter its own doom in advance by
using such methods in its trade u11ion work. It will rely upon the
correctness of its analysis and program, the persuasiveness of its
propaganda, above all upon the activity, devotion and militancy of
its members in the unions to win the conﬁdence ﬁrst of the pro»
gressives and then of the broad masses in the unions.

No fact stands out more clearly from a survey of the present
scene than the need of a revolutionary party with a sound trade
union program. The masses are in motion. They continue to press
into the unions. One strike struggle follows upon the heels of the
-other. Yet for lack of effective organization of the Left—progres-
sive wing, itself the result of the disastrous policies of the C. P.
and S. P., many strikes are prevented, no strike has gained results
proportionate to the spirit displayed by the workers, the issue of
unionization in the traditional anti—union strongholds in the basic
industries is still unresolved, the old A. F. of L. machine continues
in the saddle.‘ The fact that the workers continue to‘ organize in
the A. F. of L. does not mean that they have a naive conﬁdence in
the present leadership. On the contrary, textile, steel, automobile,
marine workers, to mention but a few instances, know that this
leadership cannot be trusted. They are ready to welcome a new
leadership which will display vigor and a sense of reality. Wher~
ever the idea of building an organization of Left-progressives has
been broached, it has met with an instant response. In fact, the
movement is already under way independently in many sections of
the country. ’ _ ,

No organization except the Vv'orkers party is in a position to
take ‘advantage of. the opportunity and to give leadership to the
movement. The C. P. is in this ﬁeld hopelessly discredited and at
sea. The S. P., apart from all other considerations, is so torn
with conflict and confusion that it cannot devote attention to this
crying need of the workers. In Toledo and Minneapolis the forces
that by merging have constituted the Workers party have already
demonstrated their ability and gained the attention of the masses.

Thus with confidence and determination we address ourselves to
the task of building the Left-progressive wing in the unions-—
building the Workers party of the U. S.--building the new, the
Fourth, International!

December 1934

“W HILE one may count upon the vertebral ﬁrmness of the
Right wing,” we wrote in our last issue about the situation
in the socialist party, “the same cannot be said of its opponents.
Properly speaking, the question is not so much ‘Will the Right
-wing split?’ as it is ‘Will the Militants’ retreat before the. Right
‘Wing threat of split?’ ” " ” ‘ I "

The Boston meeting of the National Executive Committee of C

the socialist party has replied with a thumping affirmative to the
latter question, in exactly the manner we indicated last month.
The decisions made at Boston not only register a victory for the
Right wing all along the line, but mark a decisive turn-about-face
for the party. The swing to the Left has been brought to an
abrupt.halt and given way to an equally unmistakable swing to
the Right. ~

T The Detroit convention was the culminating point of the Left-
ward development in thesocialist party. The explosion "of the
prosperity myth in the United States by the unrelieved crisis, the
succession of strike waves, helped to undermine the position of

traditional reformism in the party. The catastrophes produced by,

classic social democratic policies in Europe also impelled thousands
to reconsider the fundamental questions of the movement and to
conclude that a thorough revision was needed. The inﬂux of new
elements, including many radical working class forces, served to
give the Leftward current greater bulk and speed. The shrewder
sections of the party ofﬁcialdom, could not afford. the complete
contempt for events and popular moods that characterizes the
extreme Right wing whose position is assured by the institutions
it bureaucratically controls. They saw the need of mixing a
harmless dash or two of scarlet into the party’s colors so as to
make them more attractive to those restless elements seeking a
revolutionary party of action. ' '

This singular combination of forces operated to inflict the ﬁrst
serious defeat suffered by the Right wing of the socialist party
since 1919. A new declaration of principles was adopted which,
while it did not meet any of the requirements of a Marxian docu-
ment, was nevertheless enough of a departure from the straitlaced
reformism of yesterday to provoke angry screams from the Right
wing statesmen who promptly predicted eternal perdition for the
party if the document was ever ratiﬁed. Worst of all for the
Right wing was the election to the National Executive Committee
of the “Militant” slate of candidates.

Especially after the declaration of principles was endorsed in
party referendum, and the Right wing launched an ominous cru-
sade against the usurping inﬁdels, a growing chorus of voices was
raised to proclaim that the socialist party was now deﬁnitely on
the high road to becoming the revolutionary working class party
in the United States, and that in a very brief period of time.

‘ In the ﬁrst place, however, a genuine Left wing did not exist.

In its stead was to be found one of the most motley‘coll.ections of

heterogeneous elements that ever composed a convention majority
or took over the leadership of a party. The majority which domi-
nated the Detroit convention and carried the declaration of
principles on the ﬂoor and in the referendum, included conservative
labor bureaucrats like James Graham; Right wing municipal poli-
ticians like Daniel Hoan who sided with the “Militants” because
the practical politicians in sWisconsin chafed under the party
domination of the “orthodox” and “un—American” (Yes!) New
Yorkers; astute Centrists like Krueger and Sullivan who con-

sciously advocate greater (but not too great) radicalism in the ,

party so as to prevent a flow to connnunism; Norman ‘Thomas,
who is a radical in the French sense of the term, that is, a liberal
in the American sense of the term; real militants who genuinely
sought a revolutionary program but who were hampered by. con-
‘ fusion and general lack of development; supporters of the‘Revolu-

tionary Policy Committee who, under Lovestone’s guidance, exe—-

cuted the grand manoeuvre of holding the stirrup-cups for Krueger
in exchange for one seat on the N.E.C.; plus a variety of odds and
‘ends who defy political description.

The first card of the Right wing in its campaign to regain power

was not a split, but the threat of a ‘split. Contrary to all the rules

THE NEW INTERNATIONAL

of Hoyle, but in harmony with the relationship of forces, this one
card has taken all the tricks up to now. -\Vith this single card,
the Right wing came to the Boston meeting, after several months
of systematic sluggingiin the party ranks, pressed the “Militant”
leaders right, into the corner and extorted from them one conces-
sion after‘ anotl1er—-to such a point, indeed, that the distinction
between Thomas and" VValclman is now more theoretical than prac-
tical.‘

It is true that the Right wing did not get everything it formally
demanded. But then again, it did not expect to get that much.
Here too, however, it showed itself vastly superior to its “Militant”
opponents—if. one may still use the word. It very impudently
demanded, for instance, a constitutional amendment providing that
the declaration of principles be inoperative in those states where
the party had voted against it. It demanded that a number of its
partisans be added to the National Executive Committee by the
method of coiiptation. It demanded a number of other things
which it had no reason at all to believe would be granted it. But
these demands were all part of the aggressive strategy of the Right
wing, one element of which was to demand 150% in order ﬁnally
to get Ioo%. This tactic of over-bidding on one’s hand is, to be
sure, a tactic of bluff. But in dealing with timid people and
cowards, bluff is often highly "effective and, one is almost tempted
‘to say, justiﬁerl. At all events, it worked wonders in Boston.

The Right wing came to Boston in full force and in many dis-

guises: delegations from the New York Committee, from the

“Socialist Unity Conference”, from the “Interstate Conference”,
from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan.
and from wherever else the Right wing could scare up some repre-
sentatives who would come to Boston to scare the N.E.C. The
sessions of the latter were a ﬁeld (lay for the Right wing. On
ﬁve distinct points, the Right wing scored a victory.

I. The united front with the communist party or the “splinter
groups” was pigeon-holed.

2. The N.E.C. opened the way for a drastic revision of the
declaration of principles.

3. The Revolutionary Policy Committee was condemned and
an investigating committee established to track it clown.

4.” A committee was established to investigate the Oklahoma
party organization’s misconduct, an investigation demanded by
Oneal and the Right wing primarily because the state voted 7 to I
for the “Militants". »

5. The “Militants” had to undergo the mortifying experience of
having one of their partisans resign from the N.E.C. under ﬁre
hccauseitliis particular “iVlilitant” leader. Dr. M. Shadidof Okla-
homa, could not distinguish between Upton Sinclair, whom he
con—gratulated'by telegraph, and the socialist party.

The complete r.ight—about-face on the question of the united front
with communists is easily one of the shabbiest capitulations of
recent times. Only a few weeks ago, the “Militant” leadership,
headed by Norman Thomas, voted exactly the other way. The
records of the N.E.C., as late as October of this year, show that
“James Oneal moved that negotiations with Communist organiza-
tions should not be undertaken by the N.E.C. Motion lost by vote
of seven to four, Favoring the. motion were Graham, Hoan,
Hoopes and Oneal. Opposed, Krzycki, Daniel, lg-lapgood, Krueger,
Shadid, Thomas and Coolidge". \Vith no change in the objective
situation, the Boston meeting of the  reversed itself com-
pletely -on the question. The Hapgood motion which was un-
equivocally ‘for‘the’11nite‘d front, received only the support ‘of
lflaniel, an R.P.'C. man, whereas eight voted against. The Graham
motion, just as unequivocally against the united front, was lost by
the tie-vote of Hoan, Hoopes, Coolidge, Graham and Oneal in favor
and Thomas, Hapgood, Daniel, Krzycki and Krueger opposed.
One representative from each side—-Krueger and Hoopes-—then
retired, and with the blessing of Norman Thomas, brought back
the miserable “compromise motion”, which compromises and dis-
credits only ‘those who supported it. The “coniproniise” gives the
Right wing justvabout 90% of what it wanted.‘

tions for a, united front with the C. P. or with “the socalled splinter
groups” (how tall they talk!) until the next convention. That is,
the ‘class struggle and the interests of the American working class
must wait two years, until 1936, to be satisﬁed, just because the
“Militant" leaders of the socialist party buckled up under the
assault of their’Right wing.

Second, even local united fronts on urgent. speciﬁc issues, are

now prohibited. In organized states, a local of the S. P. must first

getthe permission of the State Executive Committee; in unorgan-
ized states, of the National Executive Committee. This automati-
cally means no united front in New York, Connecticut, Massa-
chusetts, Pennsylvania, New jersey (which the Right wing has
just recaptured), Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Wisconsin, California—that is, in all those states, with the possible
exception of Illinois, where the socialist party, and consequently
the united front itself, has any signiﬁcance and importance. As
for localities under the direct jurisdiction of the N.E.C., it is
highly doubtful that they will get permission for a united front in
view of the frame of mind into which the Right wing has intimi-
dated the"‘Militants”. r

The “compromise” motion was adopted by a vote of 7 to 3,
Daniel and Hapgood voting against it because it rejected the united
front, and the intransigeant Oneal voting against it because it
“1'.‘»ern'1'itte<.l" local united fronts. In the course of the discussion on
the motion, Thomas expressed his position in such a manner as
made his position indistinguishable from that for which, in the
past, the socialists have condemned the communists, namely, that
they want the united front “only in order to expose us”. The
report of the New Leader reads: “Norman Thomas said he wanted

. to negotiate with the communists only to get the communist party

on record, black on white. ‘I believe we want a united front

I _[What a singular way the N.E.C. has of showing it l——S.] and that

it is the communists who make it impossible.’ ” Which means, it
appears, that “we” have advocated a united front only in order
to prove that it cannot be realized. Vl/hen did Thomas make the
sudden discovery that it is impossible? The resolution of the
N.E.C. virtuously declares that

“Before proceeding with any negotiations with the communist
party or the socalled splinter groups on the question of united ac-
tion, the socialist party must be convinced by their actions that
such policies and practises, particularly the theory of ‘social-
Fascism’, the use of splitting tactics and disruptive methods in
the labor organizations, are no longer in use and will not operate
to discredit the cause for which united action is proposed.”

S We leave aside for the moment the question of which of the
“socalled splinter groups” is supposed to be a defender of the
theory of social—Fascism and the use of splitting tactics and dis-

hruptive methods, in order to ask another question: What has hap-
vpened between the October meeting of the N.E.C., at which the
Onegl motion to drop united front negotiations was voted down by

the Thomas majority, and the December 2 meeting of the N.E.C.,
at which a similar motion was carried by the same Thomas
majority? We at least, are aware of no particularly new variation
on the theme of social-Fascism advanced by the Stalinist party in
these brief ﬁve weeks, or of anything out of the ordinary (for
Stalinism!) in the realm of splitting tactics and disruptive methods
in the same period of time. In order to produce this Thomasian
somersault, we ask, just what new thing happened in the camp of
Stalinism that wasn't there several weeks ago? Or just what is
new in the objective situation? In all fairness to Mr. Thomas,
let us quote at length from his explanatory letter to the New York

S _Times_ of. December 8:

“Since that time [the l\lilwaul<ee meeting of the N.E.C.], how-
',ever,- events have not moved auspiciously. The communists here
and in other countries, for example Poland, gave new evidence
bo_th by word and by deed that they had not abandoned their inten-
tion of using the united front as a manoeuvre not only, or perhaps
chieﬂy, to ﬁght Fascism but to destroy the socialist party. At some
points. they seemed to intensify rather than abate their disruptive

tactics in the American labor movement. Sentiment in the

socialist party. was clearly in large majority opposed, therefore,
even to negotiations until such time at least as communist tactics
might change [the 1936 convention of the S. P., perhaps?--5.]
and until the party as a whole could pass on this important matter

December. 1934

through the regular machinery of the convention. For this reason
the N. E.C. at its last meeting deﬁnitely ended all talk of united
front negotiations with the communist party.”

A marvelous counry--Poland! The Jewish Khazars used her
as a land to settle on when they were expelled from Constantinople
a thousand years ago; the Mongols used her as a gateway to
Hungary; for centuries she was the eastern outpost of true Chris-
tendom ; her cavalry was used to save Vienna from the last Turk-
ish attack; even the Swedes used her——or rather her later king,
John III-—-to ﬁght against Poland herself; Frederick the Great,
Catherine the Second and Maria Theresa of Austria. used her for
territorial aggrandizement; in turn she gave Kosciusko to the
American revolution, Dombrowski to the Paris Commune, Lux-
emburg to Spartacus, Pilsudski to Austria, and Karl Radek to
Stalin; France used her as a vassal state from 1919 onward, and
Hitler is now using her in his bloc. But never, never before has
long-suffering and innocent Poland been used by anyone as a cover
behind which to crawl out of a diiﬁculty created by an internal
party dispute, as a bridge between an October pro-united front
position and a December anti-united front position!

The feeling of friendship which all liberty-loving persons, from
Karl Marx’s time down to the present, have felt for the integrity
of Poland, rises in us, too, and prevents us from accepting her as
a dens 6.1’ maclzénft to help Mr. Thomas out of his unenviable
plight. And indeed, there is no need to go abroad, or to import an
explanation for the change of front by the socialist N.E.C. It is
to be found right here, and it is a simple one. The Right wing,
whom the paladins of the “Militant” group set out a year ago to
challenge so recklessly, swooped down in full fo-rce, made a few
menacing gestures, threatened to split away and deprive the party
of its institutions, its wealth and its respectabiliiy——and the paladins
crumpled up pitifully. The explanation for the change lies in the
fact that the “Militant” leaders have a string of gelatine where
their spine ought to be and an oil-drenched knee-hinge where a
brace ought to be, that is, they have the physical as well as the
political characteristics of Centrism.

How else explain the head-over-heels speed with which the
l.')ecember N.E.C. made so many changes in policy? How explain
the New Leader report from Boston that “On Sunday, the com-
mittee voted to set up a committee to receive suggestions and
recommendations in the matters of rendering the declaration of
principles satisfactory to all sections of the party”. Surely, not to
all sections. Not, for example, to the Revolutionary Policy Com-
mittee. Not, for example, to the “Militants? themselves, for as
we understood it they wrote it, adopted it in Detroit, and endorsed
it in the national referendum. If we may venture a bold guess,
the declaration of principles is to be made satisfactory to Mr.
Louis Waldman, or Mr. James Oneal, who represent the only
remaining section of the party that we know of. :Why has it be-
come necessary to satisfy them now, when their feelings in the
matter were so impolitely ignored a few months ago ?— Knowing
the integrity and ﬁrmness in questions of principle which is so
characteristic ofthe “Militant” spokesmen, we would not even
presume to think that their re-awakened sensitiveness to the in-
jured feelings of the Right wing was evoked by the latter’s rude
prodding. It is probably attributable, let us say, in the words of
Mr. Thomas, to the fact that “events have not moved auspiciously”,
and that the Trotskyists in Transylvania “have given new evidence
both by word and by deed” that the declaration of principles
requires a new rendering.

And the official condemnation of the R.P.C., and the decision to
“investigate” it, which Mr. Thomas insisted upon—how explain
that? The latter is reported to have said that he was “shocked
beyond words” when parts of the R.P.C. program were read at
the Boston meeting. It is difﬁcult to add understanding to the
sympathy that is elicited by such a reaction. The R.P.C. has made
no particular secret of its point of view. Its program has been
public property for months and those ready to be shocked could
purchase it any‘ day at the Rand School bookstore. Its position on
the fundamental problems, as we thought was generally known
inside the S. P.and out, is that of the communists, deeply discolored
by Lovestone. Nor has there ever been much difficulty in esta-
blishing its——shal1 we say, intellectual ?——kinship with the Lovestone

group. Evidently, the “Militant” section of the N.E.C. is very

slow inlearning what is happening under its very nose, and in
broad daylight, inside the socialist party. The same perplexing
conclusion must be drawn from Mr. ‘Thomas’ speech at the New
Jersey state convention banquet, a week after the Boston meeting.
Addressing himself anonymously to Francis Henson and Irving
Brown, the R.P.C. leaders present as delegates to t.he convention
(New Jersey seems to serve certain “revolutionists” either as a
purgatory before entering the heavens of the S. P._, or as temporary
shelter from which, unlike other states, they cannot be expelled to
the outer regions), Thomas launched a bitter attack, according to
the New Leader account, “holding that there was no room in the
‘party for any who as delegates, oﬂicers of the party, etc., acted on
orders of any caucus or group within or without the party”.
Surely, it was wrong to conceal the fact from Mr. Thomas for
such a long time that in all important sections of his party, dele-
gates and officers, including some of his very closest political
friends, have been acting on the orders of either the “Militant”,
the Right wing, the “Unity”, or the R.P.C. caucuses and groups.
In general, it may be said that had -the N.E.C. been informed

, somewhat earlier of what it always knew, it would not now be

confronted with the diﬂiculty of explaining away its political con-
tortions and capitulations by the rather’ obscure assertion that
“events have not moved auspiciously”, or that the Lovestoneites in
Latvia “have given new evidence both by word and by deed” to
prove that all R.P.C. supporters should be expelled, or any other
explanation except the one that the “Militant” N.E.C. sank whim-
peringly to its knees at the ﬁrst stiff blow dealt it by the-Right
wing gang.

In his reports to the New Leader, its reporter, W. M Feigen-
baum, calls the Boston sessions “the longest, most exciting, and in
many ways the most dramatic meetings of the party’s highest
governing body in over ﬁfteen years”. In essence, the time-spacing
is correct and signiﬁcant. Almost exactly ﬁfteen years ago, the
socialist party, faced with fundamental problems of the working
class movement, split in two, and lost more than half its member-
ship to the communist movement. From that moment began its
political and organizational decline and its swing to the Right,
interrupted only a couple of years ago. The new radical wing
which came to the top in recent times—-by far the most woeful the
party has ever seen—did not take long to exhaust its radicalism.
It has now inaugurated its period of capitulation to the Right
wing, of conservatism, and according to present indications, it will
even seek to outbid its reformist adversary of yesterday in the zeal
with which the Left wing elements and tendencies are to be
hounded.“ To be sure, all this is done under the hallowing cloak of
“unity”, which is, asa rule, an excellent thing in the working class
movement. “It was felt by everyone present that nothing mattered
more than ﬁnding some basis of unity and harmony,” writes F eig-
enbaum. The situation could not be more admirably stated. Noth-
ing matters now except unity between Waldman and Thomas,
Krueger and Oneal. Nothing——not even the “Militant” position
on the united front (thrown overboard), on the declaration of
principles (on the rail and ready for the last shove), on the ﬁght
against reformism (thrown overboard), on the democratic right of
expression for Left wing opinions (thrown overboard). Unity
with Waldman, Oneal, Cahan and Lee is always possible, any time
of the day or night, on such a basis, and that is the unity which
is being established. ‘

Here aresome of the new signs of; the times in the S. P.:

In Missouri, which voted six to one for the declaration of
principles, the State Executive Committee has just defeated a
motion to “consider a united front with the" C. P. on speciﬁc issues”.
At the same time it adopted a motion to “support any consolation
with Farmer-Labor, Sinclair Epic, Progressive and other parties
only if the principles and aims of socialism are not compromised”.
The picture of such a consolidation is really too excruciating to
contemplate.

The .last meeting of the California State Executive Committee
had before it two resolutions, one asking that the declaration of
principles be revised by the N.E.C. and another proposing that
California withdraw from the party. After the jabberwocky of
the “Militants”, the‘ blunt English of the Right wing "is like a
cooling. draught, - ‘

The post-Boston state convention in New Jersey, a state in which I I
the Detroit declaration got 57% of the vote, defeated a motion to .

reaffirm the declaration and make loyalty to it the first test. By 
clever Right wing motion, it prohibited the incoming state com-_
mittee from taking any united front actions or from using the
state paper, 1Vt-"w View, for “factional” purposes, thus smashing
another Left wing white hope. ‘ .

The post-Boston Philadelphia city convention of the party urged _l _

the N.E.C. not to engage in any united front activity with com.-
munists, and called upon the national and state committees to expel

members or supporters of the R.P.C. The immediate result of this 7

resolution was that nine local leaders of the Revolutionary Policy
Committee, including Felix, Hanson, van Gelder, Lee and Riemen-
Snyder, resigned from that body.

In New York City, the “Militants” and the Right wing are now
working in tender solidarity. The last meeting of the local Cen-
tral Committee “was the most peaceful held in New York in many
moons . . . [it] . . . unanimously accepted the report, of a special
executive meeting which had elected a ‘harmony committee’ of ﬁve
consisting of Alex Kahn, Emil Bromberg, Issay Minkoff, Jack
Altman and Max Delson”. At the same meeting, “action was taken
-in the appointment of a ‘harmony committee’-——which bids fair
to begin a new era”. A new era, indeed! _ __

“(hat the new era will look like, beginning with New York, is
visible from the decisions of the State Executive Committee. All
party and Y.P.S.L. branches are strictly forbidden to enter united
fronts with the C. P. “or any of the communist splinter parties or
groups”. In addition, the Committee has formally launched the

ﬁrst expulsion drive-—not for violations of party discipline, but for A

political opinions—that the S. P. has known since 1919! “The
State Committee voted unanimously to condemn all organized
factions in the party and to prohibit party oﬁicials and delegates
to be bound by instructions emanating from factions and caucuses.
The S. C. also condemned the socalled R.P.C. and ordered} the

expulsion fronzgthe party of all members belonging to that organ-I N

-ization or holding views of that faction condemned in the resolu-
tion of the N.E.C.” (New Leader, December 15, 1934. My em-
phasis.—-S.) I

“Or holding views” !——that’s as good as the Stalinist bureaucracy
any day. In the words of a noted attorney-at-law, Albert Goldman,
who recently announced his conversion from communism to social-
ism in a speech delivered at a Chicago S. P‘. branch forum: “A
party that demands of its intelligent members not revolutionary
discipline but silence on the pain of expulsion, is not a Marxian
party but a caricature of such a party and represents a grave
danger to the revoutionary movement.” His legal skill is already
urgently required to combat this grave danger, for his Marxian
party in New York has just brought up several party and Y.P.S.L.
members on charges of expulsion for “holding views” in favor of

a Fourth International.

Do the latest events in the socialist party mean that the whole
organization will swing solidly to the Right? There is no reason
to draw such a sweeping conclusion. Waldman and Co., it is true,
will not be content until they have drawn everybody and every-
thing to their position of extreme reformism, The .“Militant”
leaders, once started down the incline, will not be able, even if the
will were there, to come to many halts before they reach bottom.
Once they have shifted their ﬁght from the realm. of principles and
tactics to the ﬁeld of unity-at-all-costs, they are doomed to extinc-

tion in the strangulating embrace of the Right wing. As for the . p. I

R.P.C., it has compromised itself hopelessly with the Lovestone
group, forfeiting its right to lead a struggle for revolutionary
policy by defending a Centrist group outside the party against a
Centrist group inside the party. One has but to read the brackish
articles in the ﬁrst (and last?) issue of its quarterly, to see that
its two outstanding leaders are" drenched with Lovestoneism.
Brown’s exercizes are poorly if elaborately re-written copy from
the Workers Age. Henson, author of the recent statement—-“I am
a Marxist. I, also, am a catholic Christian” (which makes him
the only living joint representative of Jesus Christ and Jay Love-
stone)--seeks to break a lance with “Trotskyism” and ﬁnds that
its “attitude toward the Soviet Union isperhaps the most repre-
hensible in‘ the whole international radical movement”, neither

more nor less. After its conduct in the past, what else is left to

this group but for members to resign from it or to ﬂee for safety

across the river to New Jersey?

But besides the leaders of the various groups, there are still
hundreds of workers and youth in the socialist camp who ' are
seriously concerned with the revolutionary movement. They have
been ﬁghting for a revolutionary Marxian position. They will not
easily retire from the ﬁght because leaders about whom they enter-
tained illusions have surrendered everything they stood for. The
Cassandra of the Right wing, Oneal, lamenting the Boston deci-
sion, writes: “In every state where majority opinion‘ is against the
united front there will be a drive in some locals and branches for
it, resulting in disputes and increasing bitterness. In sta.tes that

negotiate, those who are opposed will light it--and with the same
re_sult.” Oneal would, of course, prefer a papal bull prohibiting
any member from opening his mouth to say anything about the
united front or any other problem which conﬂicts with the petriﬁed
views of the Right wing. The hope for the progress of the revo-
lutionary trend in the socialist party, however, lies in ignoring the
preferences of Mr. Oneal and his associates. Ignoring them-and
carrying on a vigorous, systematic ﬁght against them. The royal
road to unity, to revolutionary unity, cannot be found by making‘
a truce with reformism, or by cowering before it. It lies in the
direction of an unremitting struggle against the Right wing and
the cowardly Centrists who have capitulated to it.

The Second Roosevelt Election

ll:?.WEI) superﬁcially the November 6 election returns would

indicate a glorious victory for bourgeois democracy. Appar-
ently President Roosevelt sits on the top of the world. Certainly
his administration is strengthened by the verdict of this national
plebiscite on his popularity. His party has had its face lifted and
many of its representatives who held ﬁrm to the President’s coat-
tails were carried along by the side.

With sixty-nine seats in the Senate, a gain of nine, and a repre-
sentation in the I-louse of 322, an increase of thirteen, with several
new governorsliips, numerous conquests of minor offices and ex-
tended means of patronage, it is conﬁrmed in power. But this
does not at all reveal the real signiﬁcance of the elections. The
trends that are still lii.d<l«::n below these surface indications are of
far greater importance.

These elections were proclaimed far and wide as a test of the
“New Deal”. it was taken -to the country, so it was said, and it
found an overwhelming approval. Is that really the case? Can
the outcome of a parliamentary election be considered a sufficient
verdict of a set of policies affecting in a fundamental sense the
future courscof American capitalism? Hardly. For a real test
of the “New Deal" policies it is necessary to view the whole of the
economic and political relationships existing since these policies
were inaugurated. In the first instance must be noted the disputes
over code regulations and collective bargaining agreements, the
conflicts of company unions versus trade unions and the widely
extended strike movements in a word, the issues of the class
struggie. .4‘ nd there need be little doubt that when taken as a
whole,’ the test does not at all signify the overwhehning approval
indicated on the surface of the election returns. It is this apparent
contradiction that needs be explained. , A V

The fact that these were the first national elections held since the
recent changes in the national economic structure and its new
relationship to the political state began, invests them. with unusual
importance. At the economic base these changes took shape in
rapid form. The sweeping reorganization climaxed by the N.R.A..,
the strengthening of the niainpillars of the structure to prepare
American capitalism for new world conquests stimulatedathe pro-
cess of transition. But the ideological regroupments that were
bound to follow came at a much slower tempo. On the working
class side they are manifested so far chieﬂy in the growing con-
sciousness of union organization and the great, militantly fought
strikes; but this has not yet crystallized into political consciousness

_or form. Due to this situation a political equilibrium was still
possible in .which, niotivated by different and in some respects
opposite reasons, the decisive sections of the big bourgeoisie, the
petty bourgeoisie an-tl the working class found tliemselves united in
the elections. bchiml the Roosevelt. administration. In this is summed
up the c.iioi‘motis contrailictions of the highly advanced technology
and political bacl<wz:_rdiw«c:< of the masses still existing within this
mighty empire. ‘

H.owc=.'e:', wiiliin its I-.‘::une\.\'orl< the process of class tl.i.tIerentia~
tion is al1'eai.ly expressed in the trends hidden below the surface of
this tl'll:.‘tlliﬁ!(.':U.'~; election verdict. lt is"possible',to deuionstrate on
the basis of the returns: firstly,’ Lliatvmoiiopoly capitalism i's?-'en-

that ths- l’l’!‘li'l-~:_ll(3 Cl;‘ii}5.i, the largest single voting" bloc, is moving

Leftward and only partly adhering to the political leadership of
the big bourgeoisie; thirdly that the working class has entered a
process of radicalization leading it toward a separate identity as a
class. In other words, behind this apparent election unanimity the
real process of ideological regroupments and class differentiation
is beginning to take form. I

We do not propose to dismiss the Republican party from consid-
eration. But for the purpose of this analysis it is of less conse-
quence inasmuch as from a fundamental class point of view it
offers no distinction from the Democratic party. Its defeat un-
doubtedly became so much more smashing due to its present posi-
tion of negative criticism when action is expected. The proposed
overhauling or liberalization of the GOP. is not due to give any
further stability to the traditional two-party system. It is much
more likely that this tradition will be broken up into new third
party formations, or labor party formations,.or both, not to speak
of a coming Fascist crystallization. However, it is not the purpose
of this article to make an attempt to delve into the future prospects
of political constellations nor to probe into the possibilities of
social reformism as such.

Owing to the past uninterrupted advance of the forces of produc-
tion and the widening sphere of capitalist exploitation, capitalism,
and together with it the parliamentary state, acquired a lasting
stability. In -the United States the institutions of parliament
enjoyed an unusual prestige due to the widely extended right of
franchise’ and the generally accepted idea that the son of the
humblest citizen can become president and that this sovereign
citizen can change conditions to suit himself by his power to cast
a ballot on election day. Parliamentarism as a state system became
the “democratic” form of the rule of the bourgeoisie which needed
the ﬁction of a national representation to represent outwardly an
organization of a “national will” standing outside of classes, but
in reality functioning as an instrument of oppression and suppres-
sion in the handsof the ruling capitalists. It performed a certain
progressive function as the weapon of developing capitalism. The
American workers would ﬁght their exploiters militantly on the
industrial ﬁeld but politically they would support, except for cer-
tain temporary interruptions, the perpetuation of the capitalist
two-party system and remain ‘under the sway of bourgeois ideology.
The bourgeois politician set himself the task of balancing the
various forces against one another. It may be said about President
Roosevelt that he has raised the bourgeois parliamentary system
to its highest point of perfection and accomplished this under new
and more difficult conditions than heretofore. Today it appears as
if the political state stands out more distinctly as the arbiter be-
tween the classes. In reality, it is, if anything, more completely
an instrument in the hands of capitalist economy, which has as-
sumed ‘new functions in support of monopoly capital, and supervi-
s:,2«.m of industry and class relations. In other words it is more
d§stiiictly an instrument of oppression and suppression in the hands
of the ruling class. But .»\mei‘ican capitalism does not e'xistlsepar-
ately and indepenclently. It is inextricably bound up with world
capitalism as a system and the decay of this world system shows
its disintegrating tendencies also in the American structure.
American capitalism faces today the problem of emerging from its
crisis at the expense of the other competitors in the world market

and__at the expense of its own working class. It does not yet need
to resort to Fascism as a form of state, but it needs. a government
that can resort to strong measures to overcome the dislocations in
its economy and resort to certain reform measures to appease the
brewing mass discontent. It needs a strong government in the
sense of one able by demagogic means at its disposal to rally the
necessary popular mass support. A

Roosevelt, or the Roosevelt system, has been characterized openly
as the savior of American capitalism, as the lone barrier against
radicalism. Before the November 6 elections many of his liberal
friends and advisers put the question in voices of anxiety: W’ill he
go to the Right, or will he go to the Left? It is now reported that
he himself thinks he is still a 1ittle_Left or Center—-that is, the
bourgeois Center. Vl/here he actually stands, in the opinion of the
bankers and the industrialists, they have demonstrated by the conﬁ-
dence bestowed on his régime by the election of his supporters.

The Roosevelt program resorted at ﬁrst to measures of the con-
templated cconomic recovery and secondly to measures of social
reform legislation. In governmental circles the terminology of the
past of inspired lofty principles of abstract bourgeois democracy
has become replaced by a terminology of economics. The “New
Deal” is called planned economy. But it is an attempt at planned
economy under capitalism, not based upon the supplying of the
needs of the masses of the people in particular, but based upon
capital investments in the branches of industry where the rate of
proﬁt is the highest. The enormous government expenditures,
while aiming at the desired stability of purchasing power of the
masses, had for its primary purpose the objective of lifting the
loads of the crisis sufficiently to forestall a collapse of capitalist
economy and set the wheels of industry into motion so that the
ﬂow of capital and the increase in the total aggregate capital, under
new form.s of intensiﬁed exploitation and an already vastly reduced
standard of living of the masses might serve to check the tendency
of the falling rate of proﬁt. The increase of commodity prices
was designed to help restore the proﬁt inducement and together
with the code regulations to safeguard “fair competition” and
strengthen monopoly capital. Thus the program as a whole had
for its primary purpose the restoration of the conﬁdence of capi-
talism in the process of capitalist reproduction. The collective
bargaining clause, which was made a part of the N.R.A., was
thrown in for good measure to create a complete equilibrium, or
to create the conditions for an “All American Team”, as President
Roosevelt expressed himself before the American bankers’ con-
vention.

Second in order followed the Roosevelt program of social reform

legislation. For -the present, however, this is to be limited, in.

addition to the already accomplished relief expenditures, to a state-
controlled system of unemployment insurance to be ﬁnanced by
local contributions and not out of taxes. It is a social reform
program inaugurated by capitalism without the assistance of a
social reformist party. It cannot be denied that this is one of the
unique American ways made possible by the strength still possessed
by American capitalism and expressing as well the political back-
wardness of its working class.

In his recent interview with Stalin, H. G. lVVells—. called the
Roosevelt program socialism in the Anglo-Saxon sense. He said:
“The effect of the ideas of Roosevelt’s ‘New Deal’ is most power-
ful and in my opinion they are socialist ideas.” Sure it is that this
program has served to put the socialist party in a pathetic position
and condemned it to a pitiful showing in these elections. Lacking
any real semblance of a revolutionary program, the reform plat-
form it advanced for the elections could be very easily and effec-
tively outdistanced by the Rooseveltian politicians. Any further
development of the latter’s social reform legislation, taken together
with the growing working class radicalization, will play its part in
intensifying the internal contradictions of thesocialist party. No
lesspitiful was the position of the Stalinist party in the election
returns. In the general process of radicalization of the masses is
discernible a trend towards communism. But this trend is not as-
similated by the Stalinist party, neither in the sense of thenew
members who join its ranks and leave as rapidly as they enter,
nor in the sense of furnishing a crystallizing pole of attraction’ in
political events and least of all in inﬂuencing the trade union or
strike movements. The Stalinist party lacks a realistic revolution-

ary policy. It repels the trend toward cornmun.ism, and heaps dio-
credit upon the name communism. The “self-criticism” applied to

elections by the party’s Political Committee, published inthe De/cw

cmber Covmmumkt, will in no way serve to cover its disgraceful
debacle. In sum and substance this “self-criticism” once more
asserts the infallibility of the line, but the unit organizers, the
section organizers and the district organizers failed to do this or
that sufficiently. As far as the official A. F. of L. leadership is
concerned, it accepted its place on the “All-American Team” and
pinned its hopes on the present capitalist controlled equilibrium. It

supported, of course, the Rooseveltians in the elections and it is.

now attempting to make this support more real by carrying out its
secret pledges to the no-strike-truce. '

The banking fraternity, the directors of the Chambers of Coin-
merce and the manufacturers’ associations accepted their place on
the “All-American Team” and went to bat in the elections in a big
way. President Roosevelt started his régime by chastizing the
bankers, digging up the old epithet of ~“n10ney-changers” who knew
only the “rules of a. generation of self-seekers”. Heprocceded to
pillorying them by the investigationsof VV all Street and sponsored
restrictive banking legislation. This became popular with the mass
of the voters. And, as is now clear since President Roosevelt
appeared before the bankers’ convention shortly before the elec-
tions, it helped to execute the grand manoeuvre of whipping the
numerous clans of small town bankers (those left over from the
terriﬁc slaughter of the crisis) into line behind the directors of the
great metropolitan ﬁnancial institutions. The whole fraternity is
now more ﬁrmly com.m-itted to the “New Deal” policies and: the
Roosevelt régime sits more ﬁrmly in the saddle. But it sits there
on the deﬁnite promise of recasting the N.R.A. along lines favored
by the owners of industry with less restrictions, less price-ﬁxing
and more emphasis on codes to strangle the small competitor; .a
treasury reﬁnancing plan along conservative lines; a balanced
budget, less government spending, lifting ofibars against export of
currencies and prospects of a return to the gold standard, together
with just enough social reform legislation to preserve the capitalist
class rule. In so far as the attitude to the working class is con-
cerned, the directors of monopoly capital have already received
their assurances in the various labor settlements, notably the. auto;
mobile settlement, and the government’s appearance in its real and
authoritative expression in strikes, in the form of policemen’s
clubs, gas and guns and steel-helmeted soldiers. There need be no
doubt that monopoly capital has become further entrenched. , ,l

The popular mass of the citizenry declared in these elections. in
unmistakable terms for the system of government spending. The
large middle class bloc of voters showed its Leftward t,re_nd4.not
only by this token but much more so by the examples of California,
Vlisconsin and Minnesota. Upton Sinclair rolled up over 8oo,ooo
votes for his diluted EPIC program. The La Follette new “Bro-
gressive” party swept the state of VVisconsin. Governor Olson,
despite his abominable record in the Minneapolis»_,.str_ike, over-
whelmingly defeated both Republican and Democratic o1)ponents.

What of the working class radicalization? It is not yet crystal-
lized into political consciousness. Certainly the workers did not
vote for all of the implications of the “New Deal” policies. ..That
is too clearly shown in the militant clashes with the armed forces
of the state during the recent second strike wave. But the working
class stillfollows in the main the capitalist political demagogue.
It has not yet been offered the attraction of a decisive revolutionary
force. It has not yet really tested its power. What will happen
when the “New Deal” begins to show its t.eeth more sharply and
the contradictions growing out of the present efforts to save capi-
talism come much more to the fore to upset the present equilibrium,
as they inevitably will in the very nearfuture?» New big_struggles
are now looming on the horizon and the American working class
can be expected to begin the writing of a new page i11.its..histo;¥'y_
