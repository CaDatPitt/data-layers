because of a reckless attempt to crush the liberation movement there, was
fresh enough in the minds of the Belgian rulers to force them to make con-
cessions to the leaders of the Congo ese nationalist parties, and, with the
threat of a national u rising hanging over their heads, to promise the
country independence is summer.

Thus, the urpose of this move was not to surrender but to
retain the rich Belgian holdings in the Congo. The idea was to
grant political independence but to seek out “reliable” Congolese
leaders with whom they could form a “partnership” which would
leave them in economic control. »

Of course, this is scarcely an original idea. VVhat is important,
however, is that such a policy of neo-colonialism -.—\ of granting
formal independence in order to perpetuate the economic strangle-
hold of imperialism — has become widespread among colonial
powers in recent times. ,

This is a game at which US. imperialism has been especially
adept. Having few outright colonies, it has traditionally carried
on its imperialist exploitation under cover of ardent professions of
support for the independence of oppressed nations whﬂe actually
reducing their independence to a mere formality — the most notable
example being Latin America. To be sure, its looting of these
countries has been no less rapacious on that score. Nevertheless,
it has sought to trade on this feature of its rule, hypocritically parad-
ing as “anti-colonial” and as a friend of oppressed peoples dealing
with all nations as equals.

At the same time, U.S. imperialism has utilized its dominant
position in the postwar capitalist world to take advantage of the
diﬂiculties of its rivals, stepping in to “assist” them under the
pretense of altruistic support of human rights, and emerging with
much of their investments in its possession. And this is, as will be
seen, the essence of its tactics in the Congo today.

Tshombe-—Imperialist Puppet

The Congolese people, however, had ideas other than that of
keeping their country under bondage. They were perverse enough
instead to choose in 1960 an “unreliable” leader — Patrice Lumumba,
a man dedicated to the genuine liberation of his people. Thereupon
using a rebellion of Congolese troops against their white oﬂicers

10

 

 

 

as a pretext, some 10,000 Belgian troops were sent into the country,
allegedly to “protect Belgian citizens.”

The real Belgian aim, as it became clear, was to attempt to regain
their rule over all the Congo or else to emasculate the Republic of
Congo by detaching the rich Katanga province. And for this game
a reliable tool was found in the wealthy Moise Tshombe in Katanga,
who promptly demanded the entrance of Belgian troops and an-
nounced the secession of Katanga from the Republic of Congo.

In fact, schemes for the s litting off of Katanga were already
afoot before the granting ofp independence. From London there
came proposals for uniting Katanga with Northern Rhodesia. At
the same time, schemes arose for the establishment of Katanga
as an independent state, and there is evidence that these were at
that time propagated from Washington. Thus, shortly before the
proclamation of independence Tshombe paid a rather mysterious
visit to Washington, returning to sing the praises of the Americans
as saviors of the Congo. And shortly afterward, U. S. News and
World Report (June 25, 1960) predicted that soon after the Repub-
lie of Congo was established, Katanga would declare its independ-
ence. ’

U.S. imperialism was in the picture from the outset, giving its
full assistance to the Belgian aggression. The American air base
in Libya was used as a shuttling center for the transport of Belgian
troops; other American facilities were also used as were the NATO
facilities based in West Germany. On more than one occasion,
American forces were smuggled into the Congo. Thus, on ]uly 20,
1960, the Soviet Union protested the appearance of a U.S. detach-
ment in Leopoldville under the guise of helping to evacuate
refugees.

If American troops were not sent into the Congo in force during
this period, it was for purely tactical reasons. When a request
from a group of Congolese cabinet ministers for 3,000 American
troops was turned down, for example, the reason, as reported by
the Wall Street Iournal on July 13, 1960, was the following:

Behind the U.S. decision to reject the appeal for direct intervention by
U.S. troops lay the fear U.S. intervention would link this country in the
minds of Africans to the old colonial powers. Many officials here fear the
U.S. is already too closely identiﬁed in Africa with Belgium, ‘Britain and

France. They are trying to avoid having the U.S. pictured as a fee of African
nationalism.

At the same time, however, preparations for direct intervention
had been made. A New York Times story of July 13 relates: “Units
of the United States Twenty-Fourth Infantry Division based in
West Germany have been on a standby basis for several days,
poised for a quick airlift to the Congo.” Somewhat later (August 1,
1960), Marguerite Higgins wrote in the New York Herald Tribune
that the United States was prepared “to send American soldiers
under some sort of U.N. umbrella if the U.N. forces proved
inadequate to do the job with suﬂicient speed.”

But if it was decided not to use American troops because the
crude, open intervention of the past appeared no longer advisable,
this decision was based also on the ability of American ruling
circles to ﬁnd other means of pursuing their aims. As against the
Belgian puppet Tshombe, they succeeded in ﬁnding their own
willing “partners” in the persons of ]'oseph Kasavubu, Cyrille Adoula
and others around them in Leopoldville. There ensued a strange
combination of opposition to Tshombe’s secessionist moves and
collaboration with 

Misusing UN

The first step was to remove the “complication” caused by the
presence of Lumumba as head of the Congolese government. This
was accomplished by bringing about the foul murder of Lumumba
and his colleagues Okita and Mpolo, an infamous act for which
Kasavubu and Tshombe share the guilt. The three men were ﬁrst
placed under arrest and then taken to Kantanga, where they met
their deaths at the hands of Tshombe’s henchmen.

A UN commission which investigated these deaths wrote:
“President Kasavubu and his aides on the one hand, and the
provincial Government of Katanga headed by M. Tshombe on
the other, should not escape responsibility for the deaths of Messrs.
Lumumba, 0l<ita and Mpolo. For M. Kasavubu and his aides had
handed over M. Lumumba and his colleagues to the Katanga
authorities knowing full well, in doing so, that they were throwing
them into the hands of their bitterest political enemies.” Nor

V7 u— -— u-v-w

should the U.S. authorities, who backed the Kasavubas, escape
responsibility. .

Then the United States, under the Kennedy Administration,
proceeded to pervert the UN by using its troops in the Congo as
a vehicle for its own aggressive schemes. The request for UN
troops had been made by Lumumba for the simple purpose of
removing the Belgian forces and assuring the sovereignty of the
duly constituted Congo government. But the directive given to
these troops by UN Under Secretary Ralph ]. Bunche was quite
diiferent: “You are here to pacify the Congo and then to administer
it,” he told them (New York Times, ]uly 31, 1960).

Instead of “assuring the sovereignty of the duly constituted
Congolese government,” the UN troops under the direction of
Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold served rather the purpose of
protecting the position of Tshombe. The Belgian troops were to
leave, but the timing was up to them. The UN troops were instruct-
ed to “avoid any involvement in the domestic political conflicts”
in the Congo — including Tshombe’s deﬁance of the legitimate
government. Congolese soldiers were disarmed by the UN troops,
but the Belgian troops were allowed to keep their arms. UN troops
were sent into Katanga only reluctantly, and then only by agree-
ment with Tshombe and on his terms. .

It was only some time after the murder of Lumumba, when
Kasavubu and his cohorts were ﬁrmly established as the Leopold-
ville government, by the activities of US. imperialism, that the
approach to Tshombe seriously changed. Finally, at the beginning
of 1963, the UN troops at last entered Katanga in force and the
Tshombe regime collapsed. Some time later, Tshombe himself left
the country to ﬁnd a haven in Franco Spain. At the same time, the
Lumumba forces had presumably been dispersed. Antoine Gizenga,
Lumumba’s successor, had been placed under house arrest. Seem-
ingly the Leopoldville government, now headed by Cyrille Adoula,
was in full control and U.S. imperialism "was triumphant.’ But
the appearance was deceptive.

 

‘ The cost of this adventure was charged to member nations of the UN.
This charge the Soviet Union has to this day refused to pay, considering the
UN action to have been an improper use of UN forces and funds and a vio-
lation of the mandate given by the Security Council when it agreed to Lu-
mumba’s request for troops.

The Forces of National Liberation

Despite independence, the lot of the average Congolese remained
the same as before. Charles P. Howard, UN correspondent of the
Afro-American, wrote (December 26, 1964):

In the Congo, since independence (P), I have seen African women com-
ing down the sidewalk with huge bundles on their heads. Meeting young
‘ white men, these women in their own country, had to get off the sidewalk;
move out into the street and remain in the street until the whites had
passed. . . .

Independence or no independence, life went on for the ordinary Congo-
lese as in colonial times. He was still paid slave labor wages. The natural
resources of his country remained in the same hands as before and under
the same conditions. There was no change in his social or economic status.

For Union Miniére, it was “business as usual.” An account of a
special stockholders’ meeting in December, 1963, published as a
paid ad in the Wall Street Journal (December 27, 1963), reported:
“In summary, Mr. V-an der Straeten (chairman of the Board) con-
cluded, the company is solid, its activities are proceeding normally
despite diﬁculties, its production remains satisfactory and is con-
tinuing. All efforts are being multiplied to stick it out and to provide
for the future while waiting for the recovery in the general situation
that will permit the Company to harvest the fruits of its efforts.”
The fruits, that is, of the continued superexploitation of Congolese
workers.

The corrupt, venal government of Adoula could solve none of
the problems of the Congolese people. It could only lead the coun-
try, already disunited and despoiled, to economic and political
disaster — an outcome which not even lavish ﬁnancial aid could
prevent. John Hatch, in an article in The Nation (“Hostages, Mer-
cenaries and the CIA,” December 14, 1964) states:

For the past two years the CIA had been pouring money out to sustain
Cyrille Adoula as its protege prime minister. Yet Adoula, despite American
and UN aid, had proved himself entirely inca able of building either an
administrative or a military organization capa 1c of holding the country
together. Thus when Tshombe returned to Leopoldville last June, just as the
last of the UN forces were leaving, the authority of the central government
had almost disappeared._ Several armed revolts were already in progress.
. . . Anarchy was blazing across the whole country. .

14

The most eloquent testimony to the character of the Adoula gov-
ernment is the fact that it was none other than the despised
Tshombe that it looked to as its savior. Tshombe thus re-entered
the picture in mid-1964 as the tool of the imperialist forces, this
time with U.S. imperialism in the driver’s seat.

Following the murder of Lumumba, the patriotic forces of the
Congolese people continued to wage an unceasing ﬁght for an end
to colonialism and for genuine freedom. For a time, under Gizenga,
they retained control of considerable areas in the Northeast.

In Leopoldville, the year preceding Tshombe’s return witnessed
a mounting anti-Adoula tide. The Parliament voted repeatedly
against him, and especially on the question of Gizenga’s release.
Strikes took place in Leopoldville and elsewhere. Demonstrations
were organized by the National Congolese Movement, originally
formed by Lumumba, and by the Gizenga—led African Solidarity
Party. These developments led, in September, 1963, to banning
these parties and to wholesale arrests. On September 30, Parliament
was dissolved and subsequently a state of emergency was declared,
with further arrests.

Meanwhile, a number of leaders had ﬂed the country. In October,
1963 a National Committee of Liberation was set up in Brazzaville
in the former French Congo, now liberated. Finally, in January,
1964 full-scale revolts broke out in Kwilu Province and later in
Kivu Province, spreading to North Katanga. After the departure of
the UN. troops in ]une, 1964, the national liberation forces, led by
men like Christophe'Gbenye, Gaston Soumialot and Thomas Kan-
za, advanced swiftly and occupied large areas, including ultimately
the city of Stanleyville. At this point the Adoula regime collapsed
and Tshombe was brought in- V

New Brutwlities

In characteristic fashion, Tshombeproceeded to meet the threat
posed by the liberation forces through the hiring of several hundred
white mercenaries. Coming chieﬂy from South Africa and Southern
Rhodesia, these consisted in the main of the worst kind of racist
and criminal scum. And they have operated true to form, indiscrim-
ately slaughtering every individual with a black skin who crossed
their path. ’

15

 

Peter Schmid, writin from Leopoldville in The Reporter
(“Tshombe’s Four Hun ed,” December 17, 1964), gives this
account: .

The green hands soon learned not to be squeamish about killing and loot-
ing. “When we attack a villa e, we have no time to ask who is a rebel and
who is not. We come in wt our guns up and we blast everything,” one
South African braggart told me.

It is to this indiscriminate slaughter that the Congolese liberation
forces responded b holding white hostages. One may have valid
objections to the ho ding of civilian hostages, but it must be said that
the patriotic forces conducted themselves in a far more civilized
manner than did the white mercenaries and the paratroopers. Less
than 100 whites were killed, at various times and places, but the
number of Africans brutally exterrninated rims into countless
thousands.

Edward  Bustin, a former faculty member of the University of
the Congo, now in this country, writes:

We cannot be blind to the fact that the lives of dozens of Congolese
citizens conveniently dubbed “rebels” have been exactedby government
troops in retaliation for the life of every murdered white. In fact, indis-
criminate reprisals against the civilian opulation have been common since
the rebellion broke out almost exactly! a year ago. The recent case of
Kindu, where bound and gagged Congolese were tossed into the river and
used as ﬂoating targets by government troops, is only one example among
many. (“Alternatives in the Congo," New Leader, December 21, 1964.)

Nor was the conduct of the Belgian paratroops any better, as
UPI correspondent Ed Van Kan discloses in his dispatch of Novem-
ber 26, 1964:

In the moment it would take me to snap my ﬁngers I saw a squad of
Belgian paratroopers kill three Africans who came under their guns.

And in another incident, the Belgians, riﬂes at the ready, stopped an
African riding a bi cle through a dusty side street, a bunch of bananas
balanced on his heail, ,

“Are you a Mulelist?” the soldiers demanded. (Pierre Mulele is a Com-
munist-backed rebel leader recently‘ rumored dead.)

"No," the African replied. '

“You're lying,” one of the Belgians said and shot the man dead.

And when the paratroops had gone, the mercenaries picked up
where they had left off. The New York Times of january 10, 1965
reports from Stanleyville that more than 500 persons suspected of
being rebels had been executed. “The executions have been canied
out without trial and without publicity,” the story relates. “Govem-
ment oﬁicials are reluctant to discuss the matter. News men have
been banned from the city during most of this period.” The dispatch
concludes with the following: “About 3,000 Congolese are believed
to have been killed during the ﬁghting on Nov. 24 and 25. An unde-
termined number have been killed since then by mercenaries in and
around the city.”

The crimes of the mercenaries were not conﬁned to mass murder;
they engaged with equal zest in mass looting. Ferdinand Scheller,
the Swiss UN representative in Stanleyville, declared (New York
Times, January 7, 1965): “They’ve looted everywhere‘ they can. The
mercenaries have broken 0 en every safe in town except two and
stolen millions of francs. ey’ve looted stores, taken refrigerators,
typewriters and every piece of equipment they could get their
hands on.”

Such is the gang of sadistic thugs turned loose on the Congolese
people by the imperialists and their “partner” Tshombe. Small
wonder that the people have reacted with such ﬁerce anger and
violence on their part. Such brutalities as these, moreover, are but
a fresh exam le of the systematic bestiality characteristic of imperi-
alism throug out its. history. It is the “civilized” colonialists, not
their victims, who have been the perpetrators of organized mass
barbarism and genocide. No colonial peoples have ever committed
anything remotely approachin such inhuman crimes; if they have
resorted‘ to violence it has on y been inhself-defense against their
persecutors. The picture of Africans as inherently given to violence
and brutality, so widely propagated in this country, is but another
aspect of the chauvinist stereotype of the “savage Africans” invented
to “justify” colonialist brutality.‘

Certainly, those guilty of such monstrous inhumanity have for-

' This myth is exploded by Robert A. LeVine, associate professor of an-
thropology and head of the Committee on African Studies at the University
of C%cagg,65in)an arﬁcle entitled “Africa in Perspective” (New Leader, ]anu-

feited all right to preach morality to others or to make pious pre-
tenses to humanitarianism. The hollowness of such “humanitarian-
ism” is particularly exposed by the fact that while great concern
is displayed over the death of even one white in the Congo, none
whatever is expressed over the wanton killing of tens of thousands
of Africans. Is the African any less human than the European or
American or his life any less precious? In the eyes of the greedy
seekers of superproﬁts, the answer is obviously “yes.”

Rescue Mission or Invasion?
Nor was the airdrop of November 24 undertaken as a mission of

 

mercy. On the contrary, the evidence bears out the contention that

it was an act of military intervention.

In the ﬁrst place, one may ask why the Americans and Belgians
were not evacuated much earlier. In a letter to the New York Times
(December 8, 1964), Professor I. Reid of State University College
of New York, points out: '

That the rebels were undertaking lans to control Stanleyville became
clear in May or ]une of 1964. One is ed to wonder wh all United States
and Belgian citizens were not evacuated at that point rather than staying on
and becoming entangled within a purely Congolese problem.

VVhy not, indeed?

Second, negotiations for the release of the hostages were in
progress when the paratroop drop was ordered. The Organization
of African Unity had set up a conciliation commission, headed‘ by
Kenya's President ]omo Kenyatta, for the purpose of seeking a
resolution of the Congo crisis. The commission took up the question
of the hostages and sponsored negotiations in Nairobi for their
release, in which Thomas Kanza of the liberation forces and U.S.
Ambassador to Kenya William Attwood took part.

Kanza stated that if the column of mercenaries advancing on
Stanleyville were halted, the safety of the hostages could be guaran~
teed and their repatriation worked out. Attwood presumably reject-
ed this proposal as “unreasonable,” as well as a proposal by Ken-
yatta to bring the International Red Cross into the picture, and so
notiﬁed Washington. Thereupon the paratroop drop was set in
motion without a word to the commission.

18

 

Nrlvdkyﬁu

D-FVIIU

Joseph Murumbi, foreign minister of Kenya, speaking at the UN
Security Council on December 15, 1964, expressed sharp indigna-
tion at this action. He stated that as head of the Commission,
Kenyatta had “immediately issued an appeal for the cessation of
hostilities to all the combatants in the Congo. The American-Belgian
intervention, with British collaboration, in view of the . foregoing
facts, was an insult to my President, an attempt to humiliate the
O.A.U., and to disregard the African interests.”

Thus were the efforts of the commission ignored. Instead, the
Iohnson Administration plunged ahead, with the Belgians and
British, to settle matters in its own way. A column of mercenaries
was advancing on Stanleyville, and apparently seeing in this the
possibility of crushing the patriotic forces, the imperialist powers
timed the airdrop to coincide with it. The airdrop was thus part of
a military operation, undertaken without consultation with the
OAU and designed to circumvent its efforts.

This conclusion is reinforced, ﬁnally by the fact that not one
hostage was killed until after the paratroops appeared, and even
then not so much by design as in the intense confusion which
ensued. It seems clear that the lives of the Europeans and Americans
could have been saved, but were instead subordinated to military
considerations.

Which Way Out?

With this act, our government fully associated itself with Tshom-
be and his mercenaries. It had already been giving him substantial
military aid since the time of his return. The New York Times
reports (Ianuary 18, 1965):

The United States has been equipping the Congolese Army under an
assistance pact and providing for the Government troops.

It gave the Congo six T-28 aircraft and five B-26 bombers, providing
Cuban pilots to ﬂy them. In addition, four C-130 transports and three H-34
helicopters, ﬂown by United States crews, are used to support Congolese
and white mercenary operations.

Less openly, the United States has been assigning individual military
advisers and mobile training teams to Congolese units. The advisers belong
to the United States Strike Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida.

The Cuban pilots, it should be added, are on CIA contracts. Thus

the United States has brought its own mercenaries into the fray.
And thus the CIA is involved in the invasion of still another country.

The pattern is a familiar one. As it has in Vietnam, U.S. irnperi-
alism is now, step by step, becoming embroiled in a war of exter-
mination against the people of the Congo. And here again, as in
Vietnam, it is already clear that no military victory can be won. As
Bustin points out, “the resilience of the rebels, who are now en-
trenching themselves in the bush and even reoccupying towns
previously captured by the Army, tends to conﬁrm that no purely
military solution is possible in the Congo.”

Not only do the national liberation forces have wide popular
support, but since the airdrop several African countries have

ublicly announced their intention of assisting them. They are
ecoming better armed, better trained and more ﬁrmly entrenched
as time goes on.

U.S. imperialism can no more win such a war in the Congo than it
has been able to do so in Vietnam. Its growing involvement (and
as this is written the Johnson Administration is considering more
arms for Tshombe) can only create another Vietnam — an imperi-
alist adventure costing countless lives, creating the danger of
escalation into a major war, and arousing growing opposition and
hostility throughout the world.

The situation in Africa has greatly changed since 1960, and not
in favor of imperialism. There now exists a powerful bloc of liber-
ated countries, joined together in the OAU. The Johnson Adminis-
tration, in ali Hing itself with Belgian and Portuguese colonialism
and with the ascist-minded rulers of South Africa, has placed itself
squarely in the camp of neo-colonialism and racism in Africa, and
squarely in opposition to these liberated nations. Thus putting at

issue the free om not merely of the Congo, but of all of Africa.

The counterpart in this coun is an outburst of the most vicious
white supremacism. The Congo ese people are described as “half-
civilized blacks” and “cannibalistic savages” quite incapable of
ruling themselves. ‘‘Black African civilization,” says Time (Decem-
ber 4, 1964), “with all its elaborate trappings of half a hundred
sovereignties, governments and ‘UN delegations — is largely a
pretense. The rebels were, after all, for the most part, only a rabble

of dazed, ignorant savages. . . .” Thus, in the racist apologetics of
colonialism, is the bloody U.S. intervention justiﬁed.

The American peo le have no stake in such imperialist adventures.
For a handful of ﬁnancial giants — the Rockefellers, Morgans,
Mellons and others - such -aggression , holds the lure of greater
superproﬁts. But for -the working people it holds only prospects of
paying the mounting costs entailed and of being dragged ultimately
into a nuclear catastrophe, as well as becoming associated again
with the brutal massacre of a people seeking only its own freedom.

More than half -a billion dollars in cash has been poured into
the Congo during the past four years, for the purpose of suppress-
ing the Congolese people. This is in addition to the billions poured
into the support of corrupt, gangster regimes in South Vietnam,
South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere. These costs are paid by the
workin people — in high taxes, high prices, inadequate schools,
hospita s and other public services —while the ﬁnanciers clip the
coupons. It is the working people who must provide the soldiers
to be killed in these far-oil wars - ﬁrst in Korea, then in Vietnam
and now, presumably, in the Congo. And it is the working people
who will pay with their lives if any of these’ wars of suppression
should be escalated to a nuclear conﬂict. '

For the Negro people, the implications of U.S. intervention in the
Congo are especially clear; hence it is not surprising that they have
most readily seen through the pretensions of humanitarianism. The
Negro people recognize their fate as bein -closely bound with that
of the African peoples, and are increasing y coming to see that the
oppressors of the latter and their own oppressors are the same
people.

Thus, Charles P. Howard, speaking of the ]ohnson Adminis-
tration’s failure to move against racist violence and murder in the
South, asks: “How can the leaders of this government criticize or
punish Mississippi sheriffs, deputy sheriﬁs, olicemen and Ku Klux
Klanners for murdering ‘black people’ in t eir own country while
President Johnson, Dean Rusk and Adlai Stevenson hire mercenaries
to kill blacks in Africa?” (Afro-American, january 2, 1965.) To ﬁght
for Negro freedom in this country, it is plain, is to ﬁght for the right
of the Congolese people to their freedom.

Get Out of the Congo!

President Johnson, in his 1965 State of the Union Message, said:
“We were never meant to be an oasis of libertyiand abundance in a
worldwide desert of disappointed dreams. Our nation was created to
help strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny
wherever they keep man less than God meant him to be.” These
are ﬁne-sounding words. But they are completely belied by a policy
which seeks to preserve tyranny, which see s to deprive the Congo-
lese people of their freedom for the sake of big business’s proﬁts.

Such a policy menaces also the freedom and well-being of the
American people. It must be relentlessly opposed, not only by the

Negro people’s movement but by organized labor and all other

bodies representing the popular interest.

For the people, therefore, there is only one solution in the Congo.
U.S. and Belgian forces must get out immediately and their instru-
ment Tshombe and his mercenaries with them. The task of effecting
a reconciliation of contending forces and establishing a truly repre-
sentative government of the Congolese people should be left com-
pletely to the Organization of African Unity, which should be
given the fullest support toward the accomplishment of this task.
Financial, technical and other assistance should be given unstint—
ingly to such a democratic government for the economic reconstruc-
tion and advancement of the country.

Above all, the key to full and lasting independence for the
Congolese people, as for all other liberated countries, is economic
independence from imperialism. The real issue is who will
control the resources and industry of the country. If these remain
in the hands of foreign monopolies, whether Belgian, British or
American, to continue to exploit them as in the past, the result
will be to perpetuate the existing backwardness and in the end to
render independence meaningless. Hence what must be defended
in the first place is the right of the Congolese people to control their
own political and economic life. More than that, the present use of
American trade and investment as instruments for robbing the
Congolese people must be supplanted by trade and economic aid
genuinely designed to help them develop their economy and raise
their living standards.

The UN Security Council, on December 30, 1964, adopted a

resolution callin for an end of all foreign intervention in the Congo,
a cease—ﬁre an the withdrawal of all foreign mercenaries. The
resolution also asked the OAU to continue its efforts for national
reconciliation and requested all counhfies -to assist it in seeking this
objective. '

This resolution offers a basis for moving in the right direction -
if it is carried out. Only intense, sustained pressure by the American
people, however, offers any assurance of this. All who cherish peace
and freedom are called upon to demand of the ]ohnson Adminis-

slogan “Get Out of Vietnam,” which is gaining ever wider support
in our country, must be -added, the slogan “Get Out of the Congo.”

WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
THE CONGO?

by Hyman Lumer

“Humanitarian Mission”

Since its formation in 1960, the Republic of Congo has been
thrust into 'a state of continual conﬂict and turmoil. In the fall
of 1964, this came to a head with a series of events culminating
in the direct intervention of U.S., Belgian and British forces, which
precipitated a crisis that has placed the question of the Congo
squarely in the center of the international stage.

On November 24, 1964, some 600 Belgian paratroopers were
dropped in Stanleyville. They had been ferried in American planes
from British-ruled Ascension Island. They were there, the world
was told, on a "humanitarian mission” — the rescue of white
hostages held by so-called Congolese rebel forces and threatened
with mass slaughter.

But despite the most strenuous‘ efforts of U.S., Belgian and
British ruling circles to sell the world this version of what happened,
it was very widely rejected. The African countries overwhelmingly
condemned the action in the sharpest terms as an act of military
intervention. In the words of Ousmane Ba, Foreign Minister of
Mali, speaking before the UN Security Council on December 10,
1964, “the United States and Belgian Governments carried out
against the innocent population of Stanleyville and the surrounding
region one of the most murderous operations carried out in the
country since the beginning of the Congolese crisis, in 1960. It was,
in fact, a premeditated and cold-blooded act.” In many cities
throughout the capitalist world, angry demonstrations took place.

The socialist countries reacted with equal indignation. The
Soviet Union branded it “a gross new act of armed intervention
in the internal affairs of the Congo by Belgium, the U.S. and
Britain.”

In this country, protests were numerous, and particularly on the
art of spokesmen of the Negro people. A grou of six top Negro
leaders headed by the Reverend Dr. Martin Lu er King called on
President Johnson to halt intervention in the Congo and to abandon
present American policies in Africa. Ioining Dr. King were A. Philip
Randolph, president of the Negro American -Labor Council; Roy A.
Wilkins, executive secretary of the NAACP; James Farmer, national
director of the Congress of Racial Equality; Whitney M. Young,
]r., executive director of the Urban League; and Dorothy Height,
president of the National Council of Negro Women. An editorial
in the Baltimore Afro-American (December 5, 1964) opened with
these words: “The joint Belgian-American military invasion of the
supposedly independent nation of The Congo is explained away
as a humanitarian mission.”

Among other oups in the United States, and in countries all
over the world, as reaction was equally sharp. And —- as we shall
demonstrate - correctly so.

We shall see,‘ too, that this shameful act of military invasion
falsely portrayed as “humanitarianism,” is but the latest step in
a long process of intervention designed to restore colonial rule
in the Congo. The fact is that although the Congo was gran-ted
independence in June, 1960, the Congolese people are still ﬁghting
for that independence against the combined onslaught of U.S.,
Belgian and British im rialism, with French imperialism hovering
in e background. An the leader of that onslaught is U.S. imperi-
alism, whose policies the Kermedy and Johnson administrations
have zealously executed.

Wall Street and Africa

In the schemes of Wall Street, Africa has held a very important
place as a potential source of enormous proﬁts to be wrested from
its imperialist rivals. For American ﬁnance capital is a latecomer
on the African scene; by the time it emerged as a leading world
force, Africa had long been divided up among other imperialist

wers.

Prior to World War II, American investment and inﬂuence on
that continent were very small In 1929, direct 'vate investment
in Africa came to only $92.4 million, about 1% 0 total U.S. foreign

investment. In 1943, the proportion was no higher. But after the
war these holdings were greatly expanded. By 1955, direct invest-
ment amounted to $657 million, or 3.5% of the total, and since then
it has grown to nearly $1.5 billion. The United States has also
greatly increased its imports from Africa, which have multiplied
more than eleven times since 1938. Signiﬁcantly, much of the
increase has been in strategic materials, chieﬂy uranium.

At the same time, Africa was developed as a base of cold war
operations through the construction of major air bases in Morocco,

5

 

 

  

Algeria and Libya, as well as the securing of rights to use similar
bases in other parts of Africa. Among these is the huge base at
Kamina in the Congo, which the United States’ is reported to have
had a hand in building.

All in all, U.S. penetration of Africa has been substantial. “The
Wall Street bankers,” wrote James S. Allen as far back as 1952,
“now have a powerful vested interest in preserving the entire
colonial structure of Africa, favoring only those changes which
will increase their share of the spoils.” (Atomic Imperialism, Inter-
national Publishers, New York, 1952, p. 215.) Today, Wall Street
is the chief bulwark of colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa,
striving ceaselessly to take over the preserves -of its imperialist rivals.

Battle for the Congo

The fabulous mineral wealth of the Congo, most of it concentrated
in Katanga province, has made this country an especially tempting
prize in the eyes of American Big Business. The Congo accounts
for about 75% of the capitalist world’s output of cobalt, more than
60% of its industrial diamonds, 9% of its copper, and substantial
proportions of a host of other important minerals. It is the richest
source of uranium available to the capitalist world, and produces
practically all its radium. In addition, it is an important producer
of a variety of agricultural products.

For the Belgian ﬁnanciers, the exploitation of these vast resources
has been a source of enormous enrichment, and this bonanza they
have zealously guarded from the very outset against foreign intru-
sion. This has been accomplished through the formation of an in-
tricate, close-knit state-monopoly combine, headed by the Société
Général de Belgique.

As Allen sums it up: “In their efforts to dominate the Congo
mines, the American atomic trusts confront one of the most thorough-
going monopolies ever established over a colony. Monopoly control
over the resources and labor of mineral-rich Katanga province is
complete.” (Atomic Imperialism, p. 194.) Kingpin in Katanga is
the giant Union Miniére due Haut-Katanga, which controls not only
its mineral resources but also all other aspects of its economic life.
In fact, the entire province has been very aptly described as one
huge company town.

The U.S. ﬁnanciers have striven from the outset to break the
tight grip of the Belgian combine and to gain control of the Congo’s
mineral wealth. As early as 1906, the Morgan group sought unsuc-
cessfully to buy Katanga outright from King Leopold 11. At about
the same time, however, the door was ﬁrst opened with a loan made
by the Rockefellers, followed by similar indirect investments in the
key Congo industries, -as well -as direct investment in a number of
peripheral industries. But the ﬁrst opening for direct investment
within the sacred precincts of Union Miniére came only in 1950,
when the Rockefeller and Morgan interests succeeded in securing a
substantial block of stock in Tanganyika Concessions, a British ﬁrm
holding a 21% interest in Union Miniére. With this transaction,
American Big Business ﬁrst acquired a signiﬁcant stake in the
exploitation of the Congo.

A number of American ﬁrms, connected with different ﬁnancial
groups, have acquired investments in a variety of Congo industries,
among them Socony Mobil Oil, Texas Company, Shell Oil Company,
Armco Steel, U.S. Plywood Company, International Business
Machines and others. The Bank of America, keystone of the Cali-
fornia group, and the biggest bank in the world holds 15% of the
stock of Société Congolese du Banque. By 1960, U.S. investment
ranked second only to that of Belgium. Britain was third, and France
and West Germany helrd: lesser shares.

Since 1960, American ﬁnance capital has made further inroads. In
that year, the Société Cenérale sold the Rockefeller group about
8% -of the shares of the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce
et l’Industrie. This gave the Rockefellers a werful position, cap-
ping a complex of investments in mining, c emicals, food, textiles,
cement, woodworking, banking, transport and trade.

In 1962 the Mellon interests extended their foothold when Gulf
Oil Company was given a concession by the Société Cenérale to
prospect for oil in the Lower Congo. And in 1963, the Morgan
group bought a considerable share of the stock of the Banque du
Congo, which handles the Union Miniére’s ﬁnancial -operations.

This is still not the whole story. But it is enough to show how
extensive has been the invasion of the Congo by U.S. capital. If
we add the holdings of British and other capital, it can be said
that although the Congo was formally under Belgian rule, it had

7

become in" fact a colony not of Belgium alone but of the big
imperialist powers collectively. It is scarcely surprising, therefore,
that these powers have joined hands in an assault on the Congo’s
independence, for while they may ﬁght among themselves over the
division of the spoils, they are as one in their determination that
there shall continue to be spoils. At the same time, the American
ﬁnanciers have not hesitated to take advantage of Belgian diﬂiculties
to take a growing share of the Congo’s wealth into their own hands.

To U.S. investments must be added the fact that nearly all of
the Congo’s output of uranium and cobalt (both used in the manu-
facture of nuclear weapons) has been going to the United States,
providing another big incentive to intervene. “Because of the
contribution the mineral resources of the Congo make to the
industrial and military requirements of the United States,” says a
report of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, “it is essential
that our future relations with it be such that the continuation of
these supplies be assured.” (United States Foreign Policy, No. 4,
Africa, Washington, 1959.) And of course there is no better way of
assuring this than to gain control of their source.

Colonial Exploitation

Despite foreign inroads, the lion’s share of investment in the
Congo remains in Belgian hands. Belgian investments, which now
total roughly $3 billion, have been tri led during seventy years of
colonial rule through reinvestment of) proﬁts. These proﬁts have
poured a golden stream into the pockets of Belgian big business,
and in addition growing sums have gone into the coffers of the
Roclcefellers, Morgans and Mellons in this country, and of the
British, French and West German monopolies as well.

These superproﬁts have been literally wrung out of the blood of
the Congolese people. In the days of King Leopold II, some 5 to 8
mﬂlion Congolese were slaughtered, and countless others had hands
or feet out off, or were otherwise maimed, for failing to meet
production quotas imposed on them. An official inquiry revealed
that fully half the population died as a result of ill-treatment at
the hands of the Belgian colonialists. Such wholesale murder
outstrips even the Nazi slaughter of Jews.

Economically, the people of the Congo have been ruthlessly

8

 

 

plundered. Their traditional agriculture was destroyed and they
were forced into wage labor for the colonial masters at starvation
earnings. A UN economic survey in 1959 disclosed an average per
capita income of $75 a year. Hunger has been widespread, articul-
arly in urban areas. Citing a UNESCO study, the Britis writer
Jack Woddis states:

Even of Leo oldville in the Belgian Congo, which many superﬁcial com-
mentators . . . eld up as a model of an enlightened colonial policy and of
African progress, it has been said: “Many children know hunger very early."
At the age of six the African child in Leopoldville is reckoned to have
learned to fend for himself, and probably to “have learned to fast for up to
twenty-four hours.” Such a child, we are told, “will have an advantage over
his comrades because it is at this age that ‘hunger-training’ starts in most
poorer families. . . . On a conservative estimate, the proportion of under-
nourished children is about half.” (Africa: The Roots of Revolt, Citadel,
New York, 1962, p. 137.) A

The fabulous wealth of the Congo has been systematically
siphoned oif in raw materials and profits," and little indeed of it
has ever been spent for the people's benefit. From 60-65% are
totally illiterate. In the entire country, there were in 1959 only
twenty Congolese with university educations. For a population of
14 million, there were only 700 doctors, not one of them Congolese.

Such have been the inevitable fruits of imperialist robbery. Such
has been the source of the colossal proﬁts for whose perpetuation
the imperialist powers have indicated they will sto at nothing.
Such is the “humanitarianism” of the trusts towar the African
people.

N ea-Colonialism

When the Belgian ruling circles agreed to grant political inde-
pendence to the Congo, they were by no means abandoning coloni-
alism. Rather, they did so only because they were compelled to
beat a retreat in the face of the tremendous force of the colonial
liberation movement — a tide which could no longer be held back.
Says E. Arab-Ogly, writing in World Marxist Review of. May, 1960:

Today the colonial powers are acting cautiously, preferring as a rule to
avoid the danger of armed uprising from which they would risk losing both
their political inﬂuence and their economic interests. The instructive ex-
ample of Holland, which forfeited her economic positions in Indonesia
