Executive Board

On the 1964 Election

p ‘ ELDOM in the history of this union have the international officers recommended

or endorsed a political party or candidates for President and Vice-President of the
United Sates. Through the overwhelming majority of our members are voting Demo-
crats, we respect the right of all members to think and vote as they choose. We shall
continue to protect this traditional policy in Mine-Mill. -

We believe, however, that the 1964 presidential election confronts all of -us not only
with a clear and unmistakable choice, but also with a clear and unmistakable obliga-

tion to speak out-—to recommend and to work for the election of President Johnson-

and Hubert Humphrey and for all candidates who support the policies and program of
the Johnson administration.

The American people were not responsible for the decision of the Republican con-
vention to nominate Goldwater and Miller. Not even a majority of Republican voters
are responsible for this calamity . . . but they permitted it to happen. A well-organized,
Vnoisy, and well-heeled minority of right wing extremists now have control of the Re-
publican party. Their battle cry was, “Give the American people a choice.” The Amer-
ican people now have that choice. We hope everyone exercises this choice at the polls
on November_3rd. * ~ * I . A

. ‘A’

TO US as working men and women, as trade unionists, and as Americans, the choice
* should be very clear indeed. ‘ . ' V
_ On the one hand, President Johnson’s 10 months in the White House have pro-
-duced more constructive legislation" beneficial to the American people than any similar
{period since theearly days of Franklin.Roosevelt in the'1930’s. This record includes
. ‘such legislation as the ‘tax cut, the Civil Rights Law, extension of Social Security, the
:Youth Employment Act, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Anti-Poverty Act. The cur-
rent struggle to. pass the important medicare bill is being actively pushed by President
J ohnson. It is obvious to anyone who cares enough to inquire and reason for himself
-that both the record and program of the Democratic administration under President
 Johnson is -devoted to and concerned with the welfare and the hopes of allthinking
\_ _.,AInericans. ' ‘ - ‘
  , On the other hand, we have all witnessed Senator Goldwater’s vote againstall
 '_th'e_se,_pro,gressi_ve measures. He, has proven by hi .record as a Senatorand in his book,

I ~..Co‘nscience_. of a,:.C(in‘”servative, that he is against lrnost everything.that.is beneficial to"

 ’-the jfa’verage'rank}'and-file working American.»
. ; "Wat‘er"ph-ilosophyis in his own words. The S
 as saying, “I do not undertake, to promote oz/elfare, for I~proposeto_'extend freedom.
 ‘_My aim, is not to ‘pass laws, but to ‘repeal them. It isnot to inaugurate newprograms,
fjbut ‘to cancelold ones.” Can any American still‘ doubt that Goldwater wants .to turn
~,the clock back? Can anyone believe that a Republican administration’under’Goldwater
A j:and'-Miller would be understanding or considerate of the peaceful aspirations and pro-
 "found ‘domestic’ problems of the American people‘? .
‘ ‘ ~YES, -THERE is a choice before the,American people on the first Tuesday in No-
5 v c vember. Any elementarylreview of the record, the program, and the statements of
1-Goldwater as the head of the Republican party and Johnson as leader of the Demo-
jcratic party can lead us to only one conclusion.’ . ’ ‘ ‘ - .-
, Therefore, your international executive board feels the necessity and obligationto
- :make, our choice and our obligation clear. We not only recommend and endorse
‘Lyndon Johnson for President and Hubert Humphrey for.Vice-President, but we also

erhaps the best insight into the Gold-.

  

Qurge our members and our local unions to work for and: support themiand’ all other .-

 candidates who pledge themselves to the Johnson. platform. We are convinced this
3 recommendation is in the interest of a better world for usall. ' . ’

WIIII Industrys Bag Five Companies
1 An exceptional display of unity in Superior and San
Manuel, Ariz., produced handsome three-year contracts
for 12 local unions of seven different internationals, when
the Magma Copper Company came to terms last month.
Formed in January after many preliminary discus-
sions, the Magma Unity Council pushed through to agree-
ment on’Sept. 11, getting a contract which provides an

8-cent across-the-board wage increase the first year and
61/2-cent general wage hikes plus 1/4-cent increments in

each of the next two years.

The Magma settlement, which covers Mine-Mill Local
937 in San Manuel and Local 938 in Superior, concludes
this year’s bargaining with the big five——Kennecott,
AS&R, Anaconda, Phelps Dodge, and Magma—all of
which have come across with substantial packages.

In addition to the wage gains, the Magma contract
contains great advances in health and welfare and se-

curity measures. It was over-
whelmingly ratified by the two
Mine-Mill locals on Sept. 19 and
20.

The security-severance plan
adopted by the Unity Council is
that achieved earlier at other
Mine-Mill properties -— $80 per
year of service, which goes to
the worker in weekly install-
ments in the event of layoff, or,
if unused, goes to him in a lump
sum at retirement. In case of
death, the money goes to the
worker’s beneficiary.

Health and Welfare

Health and welfare gains in-
clude a hike to $60 in the weekly
sickness and accident benefits,
a reduction in the employee
contribution, and increased pay-
ments for hospital room and
board, maternity benefits, and
major medical coverage. An in-
crease in the shift differentials
to 8, 12, and 16 cents will be-
come effective on July 1, 1966.

Workers will begin getting

three weeks of vacation after

12 years of service on July 1,
1965. The 8c per hour wage in-
crease is retroactive to July 1
of this year.

In addition, the contract pro-
vides many job reclassifica-
tions,- and improvements in such

-matters. as seniority, overtime,

and safety. _ ._

Other ‘unions covered by the
settlement are the -International
Association of Machinists, AFL-
CIO, Lodges No. 2181 and 1811;
the International Brotherhood of
Electrical -Workers, AFL- CIO,
Locals 570 and 518; Teamsters,

coordinated Bargaining Produces Wage
Hike of 18° in Harbison-Walker Gontraots

A weeklong strike against the Harbison-Walker Refractories Company at the be-
ginning of August produced across-the-board‘ wage- hikes of 9 cents in each year of new
two-year contracts for members. of Mine.-Mill Locals 531 and 553 in Bessemer and Fair-

A field, Ala. ‘

The major gains in the settlement also were applied to other properties of the com-
pany throughout the country, as, for the first time, the coordination of bargaining
objectives of various unions representing Harbison-Walker employees paid off in con-
tracts whose major features were common throughout the chain. Meeting under the
auspices of the Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO, representatives of five

' international unions agreed to hold out for certain common demands.

Other unions involved in the cooperative bargaining were the Stone Workers, the United Steel-
workers of America, the Brick and Clay Workers, and the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers.

Security. Vacations

The new contract also pro-
vides 2 cents per hour additional
company contribution to a sup-
plemental unemployment benefit
fund—SUB. The vacation sched-
tile is substantially improved,
with workers getting two weeks
after three years of service,
three weeks after 10 years, and
additional one-half week’s pay
after 15 years, and four weeks
of vacation after 25 years. Previ-
ously, the workers got two
weeks after five years of ser-
vice, an additional one-half
week’s pay after 10, three weeks
after 15 years, and an addi-
tional one-half week’s pay after
25.

Several health and welfare
gains were achieved. At the two
Mine-Mill properties in Ala-
bama, many jobs were reclassi-
fied and many improvements
were made in contract language.

Settlement on local issues
came after the broad pattern
set by the IUD and cooperating
unions had been established.

The new two-year contract
was signed by William Thomas,
president of Local 531 in Bes-
semer; James R. Smith, presi-
dent of Local 553 in Fairfield;
and M. C. Anderson, interna-
tional representative.

Harbison-Walker, which spe-
cializes in producing bricks. for

ations located east of the Missis-

Big Companies Hike
Price by Two Cents 

The long-anticipated boost in U. S. producers’ price of cop.-
per went into effect last month close on the heels of labor-man-
agement settlements between Mine-Mill and major U. S. copper
companies. Phelps Dodge and Anaconda posted 2* cents per pound

increases on Sept. 21, making the price 34 cents per pound, and

were followed by American Smelting & Refining and Kennecott.
Brass mills promptly fell in line, boosting brass mill‘ product

prices correspondingly. - »~
Anaconda President C. Jay Parkinson predicted the price hike ’ l
a week before it happened. He said it would come “as a result ~

of labor settlements.” A spokesman for Phelps Dodge, on the
otherhand, said the increase was to match an August price*in-
crease of 2 cents a pound in the U. S. producers’ price in»tl1“e=
European markets. 

Whoever is right, it is obvious that the move was heldllofff
until labor settlements were reached. This strategy was outlined’

in the Wall Street Journal two months before, when it quoted
copper trade authorities as saying an earlier hike would be .“in-

opportune and could be harmful” while contract renewals were:

being negotiated.
Profit Increases Summarized

The two-cent hike, coupled with the one-cent boost last March, ,

means a tremendous increase in profits for all U. S. copperpro;

ducers in the year ahead. Many additional factors will also opera ;
ate to increase profits, such as increased production per man- '
hour. fighe-r profit margins in captive brass mills, and increased’

copper production. -

But the three-cent price increase, alone, means well over.$100 :_
million in increased profits before taxes for seven big U. S. copper _ ,-
companies over a year’s time. This breaks down as follows, based V}-

on 1963 production (current production is higher):

Magma

American Smelting & Refining._--___.--_-__.__.-_-.____-- 10,000,000 _ 
Phelphs Dodge 16,000,000 . 
Anaconda 35,000,000 5
Kennecott 35,000,000 
Inspiration V 3,000,000 r “
American Metal Climax 7,500,000 __ ..

$112,500,000

Further increases in U. S. producers’ prices may or may not

be in the cards. Anaconda President Parkinson predicts a period

of “stability,” with producers’ copper prices no higher than 3 . 

cents a pound. -

Arguing against this theory, however, is the continued tight-l
ness in the copper market, reflected by dealer prices in New York Y
and by London Metal Exchange quotations. Last month dealers, 
in New York were quoting 53 cents a pound, while prices on they:
London Metal Exchange reached the highest level in this century"
when copper went to over 551/2 cents a pound late in the month. .\

THE MONTANA MINE-MILL IOINT BARGAINING COUNCIL recently reached a new three-year settlement with the

Anaconda Company——the biggest package ever won by any union from that company. In addition to across-the—board
wage hikes of 23c an hour over the three years for some 3,700 workers at Butte, Great Falls, and East Helena, the
agreement provides improved vacations, increased shift differentials, pay for time lost due to jury duty, and, for
the first time in nonferrous metals mining, 25¢ per hour premium pay for Sunday work as such. One error, however,
appeared in the September issue of Mine-Mill Union. This newspaper saidvthat in the first year. of the Anaconda
contract there would be a reduction of $3.60 per month in the employee contribution to the health, andwelfare
program. Rather than a reduction in premium, there "will be $3.60 worth of new health __.and welfare _benefits....»'-l"he
reported reductions in premiums of $1.40 per month in the second Year of the contract and of $2. per month in the
third are correct. Participating for the union in this year's negotiations were, front row, L. to R.: Gabriel Kuntz,

..—-—.-.-.

The huge stake that all of labor feels it has in this November’s election -is indicated by the unanimous endorse-

.ment of President Johnson on Sept. 1 by the 166-member general board of the AFL-CIO, which includes several Re-

publicans. Although the nation’s attention is focused primarily on the Presidential race, at least 20 Senate races
throughout the country are now rated as being extremely close and one or more critical House contests are being
fought in about half of the 50 states.

Mine-Mill has a concentration of membership in the Rocky Mountain West—the very states that Goldwater

considers key to his campaign. It is also in this area that many of the sponsors of proposed federal mine safety

legislation are involved in what figure to be tight races for Congressional and Senatorial seats.
U.S. Sen. Lee Metcalf, Democrat of Montana, is one exception. A sponsor of the Metcalf-Montoya bill, which

would set up federal safety
codes and enforcement proce-

dures for mines, smelters, and‘
‘. refineries, he does not have to
run until 1966 when his term ex-
- pires. The other Montana Sen-
' /ator, majority leader Mike
" Mansfield, is expected to have

little trouble in disposing of Alex
Blewett, an attorney from Great

‘Falls and former Republican

state legislator.

All other sponsors of Metcalf-
Montoya, however, are in cam-
paigns.—and some of them, ‘at
this point at any rate, are con-

- sidered very rough ones indeed.

In Montana’s First Congres-

V sional District, Arnold Olsen is

once again facing the Repub-

. lican opposition of Wayne Mont-

gomery. Two years ago, Olsen
was the winner by 5851 votes of
the more than 105,000 cast.
Olsen, Mansfield, and Dr. Ro-
_land Renne, who hopes to knock

-off the incumbent Republican
-Governor Tim Babcock, all have

the endorsement of the Montana
Mine-Mill Legislative Council.
Utah Key
In another key western state

’ in which Goldwater forces are

concentrating, U.S. Sen. Frank
Moss of Utah, seeking re-elec-
tion for a second term, is in for

V c a rough fight from the ultra-con

servative Ernest Wilkinson, a
former president of Brigham
Young University. Although re-
cent polls show Moss with a
slight edge, the pollsters have
missed several times so far this
year._

Another man friendly to labor
legislation of particular interest
to miners is running in Utah.
David King, a former Congress-
ma-n,_who lost in a bid togstep
up to the Senate two years ago,
is again the Democratic candi-
date for_ Congress in the state’s
Second District, which includes
Salt Lake City and the'surround-

Mine-Mill-backed bill for early
retirement for ‘miners and oth-
ers in hazardous occupations
which was introduced in the sec-
ond session of the 87th Congress
and reintroduced again last year.
Montoya Seeks Senate

U.S. Rep. Montoya, who is
supported by Mine-Mill Local
890 in Bayard, is running for the
Senate this year, in which prom-
ises to be a close race. He is
going against the Republican in-
cumbent Edwin L. Mechem, who
as governor in 1962 appointed
himself to fill out the term of
the late Sen. Dennis Chavez, a
Democrat. 1

In Arizona, two other spon-
sors of Metcalf-Montoya, both

. Democrats, Morris Udall and‘

George (Duke) Senner, are up
for . .re-election.. Udall in the
Second Congressional District

7 wi_ll;,b,ej opposed by William E.‘

Kimble’ of Tucson, while State
Sen. Sam Steiger of Prescott
provides the opposition for Sen-
ner. The presidential race, ac-
cording to polls, looks like a

toss-up in the‘ state. Many of the .

newspapers thr’ou_ghout the state
(The Arizona Daily Star is at

 

least one exception) can be‘ex-
pected to endorse and thump
hard for the local candidate,
Barry Goldwater.

Henry Gonzalez and Edward
R. Roybal, two other sponsors of
the Metcalf-Montoya bill, are up
for_ re-election. Gonzalez is the
incumbent in ‘Texas’ 20th Dis-
trict, while Roybal hails from
California’s 30th District.

The mine safety and early re-
tirement bills may come up for
Congressional hearings next
year, but their fate can be criti-
cally dependent on the outcome
of the Congressional and Sena-
torial campaigns now in prog-
ress. The sponsors of Metcalf-
Montoya are all Democrats, and
will_certainly stand to benefit
from Democratic majorities in
the presidential race. Many ob-
servers see a tide of conserva-
tism in -the Rocky Mountain
states; Whether they are right
or not will be seen on Nov. 3. '

Fate of Mine Safety Legislation Coud Local 863 signs
Rest With Several Congressional Races

2-Year Contract  

CHARLESTON, S. C. —- The
Charleston Fertilizer and Chem-
ical Workers, Local 863, and the
Virginia-Carolina Chemical Com-
pany reached agreement on a
new two-year contract last
month, ending a long round of
tough bargaining sessions.

A 31/2 percent across-the-board.

wage increase, or from 6 to 8
cents an hour, was won for
workers in the Chemical Divi-
sion in the first year of the con-
tract. The second year provides
a 21/2 percent hike—from 5 to 7
cents per hour. —

In addition, six job classifica-
tions were adjusted upwards,
which will mean an extra 4 to 6
cents an hour for the workers
affected, retroactive to Nov. 26,
1963. ‘Another contract change
provides that if an employee
works at a higher classified job
for two hours, he be paid at the
higher rate for the entire shift.

Funeral leave may now be taken

in the event of the death of a
grandparent. .

In the Fertilizer Division, five
job classifications were adjusted
upwards from 3 to 4 cents per
hour. The first year of the
agreement calls for an across-
the-board wage increase of 5
cents an hour; the second year,
4 cents an hour. R

The company dropped, after
rejection by the union, many

’ proposed changes in the “Man-

agement Functions” section of
the contract, which would have
reduced the effectiveness of the
grievance and arbitration pro-
cedures. ,
R. N. Wagner and W.’ C.
Funches were the chief union
negotiators for the Chemical
and‘Fertilizer Divisions respec-
tively. Others on the committee
were‘ Rev. J. S. Gailliard,
C. Thoma_s, B. Dinnes, F. R.
Burke, G. B. Patrick, B. J.
Combee, B. Singletary, .R. L.
Hughes, H. Jenkins, W. H. De-
witt, Jr,., and J. Wierman.
Several grievances at the plant
also have been settled, accord-
ing to International Representa-
tive Jesse Doster. These include
overtime pay for a number of
workers and an additional half

time pay for employees who did. i

not work on Memorial Day and
the Fourth of July, holidays
which fell on Saturday this year.
The workers had already re-
ceived straight time pay for the

Chile's New President Seeks
Changesin Copper Industry

Senator Eduardo Frei, candidate of the Christian Democratic party, which has a
program of sweeping economic and social reform, scored an impressive victory in a
three-way race for the presidency of Chile on Sept. 4, picking up 56 percent of the
more than 2,500,000 votes cast.

In an election that had been rated a to ssu-p until the closing days of the campaign,
Frei clobbered his closest opponent, Senator Salvador Allende, a socialist and candidate
of the coalition known as the Revolutionary Front of Popular Action. Allende received
39 percent of the votes, while Julio Duran, a conservative, ran a poor third with five

percent.

Frei, 53, who will be inaugurated Nov. 4 for a six-year term, succeeds President
Jorge Alessandri, a conservative, who was prevented by the constitution from seeking
r -election. In 1958, Alessandri defeated Allende by a slim 30,000-vote majority in what

was Al1ende’s second bid for the
presidency.

Although Frei proposes to
“Chileanize” the U.S.-o W n e d
mining and smelting enter-
prises, he apparently received
the votes of many conservatives
who saw in him a lesser evil
than-Allende, who advocated
even stronger measures, includ-
ing nationalization of the Ana-
conda and Kennecott properties
in the country.

More S'l'o'l'e Con'l'rol

On record as favoring more
U.S. investment in Chile, Frei
also favors more state control
over foreign-owned companies.
If he is true to his campaign
promises, he will require Ana-
conda and Kennecott, which
have $2 billion invested in Chile,

.to substantially expand mine

production, to refine all blister
copper in Chile, and to inaugu-
rate a copper fabricating indus-
try there.

However, he is expected to
face the opposition of his con-
servative supporters in achiev-

- ing these goals, as well as con-

siderable opposition from the
Chilean Congress, which was
not up for election last month.
A new Congress will be elected
next March, and Frei’s chances
of success will be largely deter-
mined by the outcome at that
time.

His other objectives include a
sweeping land reform, slum
clearance, improved education,

   

   
   

   

Eduardo Frei

and a more progressive tax
structure. He has promised so-
cial and economic reforms
“much on the lines of Den-
mark’s limited socialism.” He
must face, however, in taking
office, the tremendous problem
of rampant inﬂation, which saw
prices rise by an average of
45 percent in Chile last year.
Johnson Hails Win

President Johnson warmly
greeted Frei’s victory, saying
the election reinforces “our
hopes for a very bright future
in the Americas.” ‘A spokesman
for the U. S. Department of
State in Washington said in
part, “The Chilean people have
selected a leader who . . . has
expressed his dedication to
economic and social develop-
ment within the democratic
framework.”

Chile, the biggest per capita
recipient of Alliance for Prog-
ress aid in Latin America, pro-
duces about one seventh of the
world’s copper, with U. S. in-
vestors producing 83 percent of
it. Officials of Kennecott and
Anaconda were said by the New
York Times to have “privately
cheered” the Sept. 4 election

results, but to have declined‘
comment on how their interests ‘

might be affected.

24: in Wages in 3-Year

Metal and Thermif Pad

CARTERET, N. J.—A new three-year agreement between the
Metal and Thermit Corporation and the New Jersey Detinning
Workers Union, Local 521- has been negotiated, providing across.-
the-board wage increases over that period of 24 cents per hour.
Each year’s hike will be 8 cents an hour, with the first raise retro-
active to July 1.

Several changes in the pension plan and the termination pay
‘provisions were made-—important because the Carteret plant, pur-
chased by the American Can Company late in 1962, will be closed
down when the company completes a new plant in Elizabethpo-rt,
probably in about a year. The new contract will give workers aged

if ._-he

   
 

62 or over the option to retire
with full pension benefits and
termination pay.

Vesting provisions are also
modified to provide for vesting
at age 45 after 15 years of ser-
vice. The monthly benefits is in-
creased to $2.60 for years of
service after July 1, 1964, and
the maximum period for com-
puting pensions is extended to
35 years.

Termination pay of $100 for
each year ofservice up to a
maximum of 20 years also-will

to $65 for 26 weeks, major medi-
cal coverage to $7,500, and ex-

‘panded Blue Cross coverage for

employees and dependents. The
company will supplement work-
men’s compensation benefits, so
that the worker will receive $50
a week for 26 weeks.

Grandview
Mine & Mill

Closes Down

The Grandview mine and mill,
a property of the American
Zinc, Lead, and Smelting Com-
pany, located in northeastern
Washington, ceased operations
on Sept. 4. Opened in 1939, the
property employed about 250
men during its peak in the late
1940’s and early 1950’s.

Due to automation and de-
creasing‘ ore reserves, there
were only 37 employees at the
time of the shutdown.

The property was organized
by Mine-Mill in 1940, with a
charter‘ being issued to Local
515 on Aug. 24 of that year. The
local has an enviable record of
struggle with the. company, at-
taining" over the years. outstand-
ing conditions and top Wages for
the Grandview workers. Not an
easy outfit to deal with, the
company at one time» took a
strike of 15 months before the
employees won a good settle-
ment. ,

The mine is being completely
abandoned and will never open
again. The workers for the most
part, live in the small towns of
Metaline Falls. ‘and lone.
Boundry Dam is being built
nearby, providing some employ-
ment opportunities, and there
a-re other mines in the area. The
shock of closure may, therefore,
be at least temporarily allevi-
ated.

In Amer. Zinc Pact

EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.-—The first full three-year con-
tract ‘ever reached between Mine-Mill Local 82 and the
American Zinc Company, signed on Sept. 14, provides
34 cents per hour in hard cash _over that period to the

175 workers at the smelter.

An across-the-board wage increase of.1O cents per
hour for the first year of the new contract is retroactive
to July 1. General wage hikes of 12 cents per hour will

take effect on July 1, 1965, and
again on July 1, 1966. The con-
tract also calls for 31/2 cents in
health and welfare, effective the
first year. '

Huge Strike Vote

The negotiating and strike
committee and the entire mem-
bership of the Fairmont Smelter

a caucus of labor groups just
prior to the opening of the con-

Bay Area PAC Organized;
Out to Smash Proposition 14

SELBY, Calif.—A Bay Area Mine-Mill political action committee representing 10-
cals at San Francisco, Richmond, and Selby, organized at a daylong meeting here on
Sept. 19, has recommended support for the Johnson-Humphrey ticket in the Nov. 3

election.

Thomas McGuire, international representative, was elected chairman of the group,
which will also wage an all-out campaign against the passage of Proposition 14,, which
would nullify the state’s fair housing laws.

Both drives—to help elect Lyndon Johnson and to defeat the “bigotry amendment” '

—-will be coordinated with other politically active unions iii the area, which include the
Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union, the International Longshoremen and Ware-
housemen’s Union, and many AFL-CIO craft unions.

Michael Johnson, secretary of the ILWU Northern California District Council,
who has been namedfull-time political action director for that union, attended the

Mine-Mill conference and intro-
duced George Miller Jr., state
senator from the Selby area,
calling him “the best senator in
California in the eyes of the
labor movement.” .-
Running for re-election again

the opposition of an ultra-con-
servative Republican, M i 1 l e r
stressed the importance of a
well-organized get - out - the - vote
drive on Nov. 3. Saying that

this year voters have a clear '

choice between candidates, he
told the group that it had a re-
sponsibility to make sure that
the citizens had correct and ac-
curate information on the posi-
tions held by various candi-
dates. He also talked about
"state legislative matters and at-
,ta_cked'Proposition 14, which is
being pushed by the state’s real
estate agents and also is backed
by many of the same moneyed-
interests which several years

ago financed the attempt to.

pass Proposition 18, the so-
called “right-to-work” law.

Oct. Meeting Set

Another meeting is scheduled
for Oct. 3 in Richmond at ‘the
Local 266 hall, at which time
the political action committee
will endorse Congressional can-
didates and those running for
the state legislature. Candidates
will be _invited to the conference
and have the chance toexpress
their views. 1

Prior to that meeting, a leaf-
let will be distributed urging
local union members and their
wives to participate in the
group’s activities, which will in-
clude distributing Johnson-
Humphrey bumper stickers and
stickers opposing Proposition 14.

The fight against the pro-
posed amendment is being led
‘across the‘ state by Democratic
Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown",
-but early polls indicate that his
-camp may have an uphill bat-

President Johnson last month

wilderness bill, ending a ten-year
battlein Congress between advo-
cates of preserving the country’s
remaining wilderness areas and
those who favor exploiting their
mineral, timber, grazing, and
commercial recreational poten-
tial. ’ ‘ ’ I ' ~

The bill sets aside 9,120,941
acres of land now in the national
forests as wilderness areas,
within which are prohibited any
kind of commercial enterprise,
roads, or use of any motorized
including motor-
bo-ats and aircraft. The filing of
mining claims, however, is per-
mitted until December 31, 1983,
and livestock grazing and use of
motorboats and aircraft, where
already established, may con-
tinue indefinitely. The lands_ are
reserved permanently for recre-
ational, scenic, scientific, educa-

The complexity of the prob- .

President J ohnson, in his short

shown that he ha_s the power

clearly shown in his unwavering ,

desire to see the civil rights bill

I am against Goldwater for

Our U.S.A. is one very strong

against unions, rights of citi-'

help any of the general public-
young or old alike.

In my opinion, he is against
anything and everything that
would help America. But he is

lish a program for the youth of
our country, to help extend the

.We cannot allow the windows,

cannot cancel programs of
peace, cultural exchange, and

union gains, but we will surely

see them destroyed if we do not
vote overwhelmingly for J ohn-

The platform of the Demo-

ments of the population will con-
tinue to make social .and eco-
nomic gains. The ' opposition
party shows no concern,’ and is
virtually silent on any legisla-
tion to benefit the people of our
great country.

The election of Johnson and
Humphrey is a matter‘of the
most vital concern to the labor
movement. We must not permit
the destiny and direction of the
nation to fall into the hand-s'= of
those who seek our downfall.

' . American workers cannot en-

Barry Goldwater is opposed

have pro-spered-‘more and have

felt more security under the

parts, and this is why we should
all feel very concerned about
political representation and our
choice of leaders who will up-
hold the best interests of our

their willingness to confront the

. problems of the people and to

try to resolve them in a manner
acceptable to all parties.
Finally, I wish to urge, for

I am supporting Lyndon B.
Johnson for President and Hu-
bert H. Humphrey for Vice-
President because of their con-
tinuing work on behalf of the
nation and its working people,
and also because they are car-
rying on the work of the late
President John F. Kennedy. A
person would have to be out of
his mind to support Senator

. Goldwater and his teammate.

Senator Goldwater’s program is
to smash the labor movement
as well as to oppose civil rights,

‘medicare, and Social Security.

In other words, if Senator Gold-
water were elected President of

The President of these United
States must be a man equal to

. the task of dealing with a multi-

tude of problems, both national

and international. He must be
a man with a responsible char-
acter and with sufficient wis-
dom to guide our land safely
through these years of crises.
Lyndon B. Johnson is the man
for the job. He is dedicated to
the welfare of all Americans,
regardless of race, creed, color,
or social status. He has led the

_g ﬁght for the cause of labor,

welfare, educational opportuni-

- ties, and expanded economic op-

portunities. He represents and
reflects the spirit of our de-

amocracy. He has brought to
-Congress and urged passage of ’

 r ‘the’ FEPC bill, the medicare"
I ,-b11l,fthe Civil Rights ‘Act, the

  
  
 

bills 'that,».when?:made, ‘law, , 

iaclrninistrationa years ‘-ago.  

  

benefit all Americans, not just
one segment of our society.

On the other hand, Barry
Goldwater has voted NO on all
of these bills. You cannot have
a man for President who will
not face reality, who wishes to
live in the good old days. We
need a progressive person, not
a man ‘who believes in the
status quo.

Would you trust the authoriza-
tion of nuclear bomb usage to
a general——one who might be
impetuous and cause a nuclear
holocaust? Goldwater is a wishy-
washy conservative who would
embrace extremists, i.e. the
Ku-Klux Klan and the Birchers,
into his party, and more re-
cently, the chameleon Thur-
mond of the deep South. Would
you vote for a man who at the
Republican convention In a d e
rash statements and then the
next day tried to change them,
using the excuse of misinter-
pretation?

Use your vote wisely this No-
vember; Vote for L.B.J. for a
brighter day.

If Senator Barry Goldwater
should be elected President of
the United States, our country
would become a closed society
to the rest of the world. He is
a man who believes in the rich
getting richer and the poor get-
ting poorer. ‘ V

With Goldwater holding the
highest office of our land, there
would be no human dignity found
in the U. S. in the North, South,
East, or West. He voted against
the civil rights bill that was sub-
mitted to Congress by the late
President Kennedy—-a bill that
gives each citizen his consti-
tutional rights r e g a r d 1 e s s of
race, color, or creed. Sure, Gold-
water would make a good leader
for those Americans who would
like to re-live the period of re-
construction and for those citi-
zens who have no self-respect
or respect for their brothers.

No self-respecting, hard-1abor-
ing citizen can stand idle and
neglect his duty to see that Lyn-
don B. Johnson is elected Presi-
dent. Johnson, a man with love
and respect for all Americans,
has fought for the homeless, the
clothesless, the sick, ' and the
poor.

Since Goldwater has been in
Congress, he has objected to
everything that the Congress
has had to offer, and I have
come to believe he was born in
the objective case.

Therefore, let us hold to what '

we have—-thje best President of
this day and time, President
Johnson, a man with the leader-
ship ability to lead our country
towards prosperity. With God
to help us, let us vote for John-

A Sometime, somehow, we in the

,U.S.A. must realize that we are

only one country in this world,
and that we do not hold the
prestige or respect that we once
held.

I remember a stirring song
that many ‘years ago was sung
all over. the wo-rld—“The Yanks
Are Coming Over There.” But
now, “over there” says “Yankee
go home.”

It is a known fact that, in
some sections of our country,
telling people what they don’t
want to hear may get you shot
in the head or your children
bombed. Still it seems to me

- that the Johnson—Humphrey

team, just as the Kennedy-J0hn«-
son team was, is willing to tell
us that in order to gain and hold
prestige, respect, friends and
confidence on the outside, we
must first strengthen the inside
of this country.

And the first step is to accord
equal and all protections and
benefits of America to all Amer-
icans who respect themselves
and conduct themselves as
A-mericans.

-Does water really seek its
level? If so, this is another
reason that I like the Johnson-
l-Iumphrey ticket. But, you see,

I cai1’t vote for this ticket in my
state.

Is there one bright star in a
field of 50, with 49 being wrong?
Is this the level——Alabama—that
the water seeks?

I don’t care if the water is
Gold. Past records stacked
against the present rattling
should say to labor that the
Johnson-Humphrey card is the
one to hold.

Appeal Made for B. C. Strikers

BRITANNIA BEACH, B.C.——The Canadian government
has been asked to investigate Anaconda Company claims
that it may not continue to operate its Britannia Beach prop-
erty, as a strike by its 350 employees enters its eighth week.

Anaconda, which purchased the property 18 months ago
from the Howe Sound Mining Company for $4 million, has
been ‘saying that the timber and other assets on the land will
cover the purchase cost even if the property is not operated.
Until this question is settled, Local 663 officials feel, there
is no chance for serious bargaining.

Although the strike continues to be 100 percent effective,
the workers. are in need of strike assistance. The Anaconda
Council recently voted a $500 donation to the Britannia Beach
workers. . . D

An appeal also has been sent out by the international
officers. “The men and Women of Britannia are determined to
win and with your assistance can be counted upon to stand
up to the Anaconda giant in a struggle that, when successful,
will benefit workers everywhere,” the officers said.

Contributions, earmarked for Local 663, should be sent to
the international office in Denver.

96 Percent Vote

A strike vote taken on July 1

majority in favor of such action,
if necessary to achieve the
unions’ demands, but no strike
was needed, as employees con-
tinued to work while the talks
continued.

“The purpose of the Magma
Unity Council,” Wilt explained
when it was formed eight months
ago, “is to establish and main-

tain closer relationships be-
tween all unions in the Magma
Copper Company and its sub-
sidiaries, and to provide a means
whereby such local unions may
confer on matters of mutual
concern. regarding wages and
conditions of work, health and
welfare, pensions, and insurance
—all in accordance with the law
and the policies of their respec-
tive organizations.”

Regular meetings of the coun-
cil were alternated between the
two Aiizona towns.

Even in dragging out the nego-
tiations almost two and a half

months past the contract ex-_
piration date of June 30, the

company could not crack the-_

‘HAYDEN, Ariz. _ James G.
Hanley, a converter skimmer at
the AS&R smelter here, won
back his job on August 13, when
Arbitrator Leo Kotin ruled that
he had been discharged by the
company without cause.

 ‘After sustaining an injury on

the job on Feb. 5, Hanley did
not return to work until Feb. 13,
at which time he was -informed
that he had been fired. The
company maintained that he
did not report back to Dr. Har-
old M. Law on Feb. 8, although
Dr. Law, the company doctor,
had instructed him to do so when
he first examined Hanley on
Feb. 6..

The case of the Hayden Smelt-

showed that the doctor had not
specifically instructed Hanley to
report back on that day, that
Dr. Law had not notified the
company that Hanley was physi-
cally unable to return to work,
that Hanley himself had attempt-
ed to telephone his foreman,
James S. Hagin, several times
at home during his period of
absence.

The union contended that the

company’s discharge of Hanley,
as soon as he failed to show up

, for work on Feb. 8, his first

regularly scheduled shift after

his accident, was a .“malicious

“Let me make one principle of this administration abundantly
clear: All of these increased opportunities—in employment, edu-

every color. As far as the writ of federal law will run, we must
abolish not some but all racial discrimination. For this is not
merely an economic issue—or a social, political, or international
issue. It is a moral issue-—and it must be met by the passage
this session of the bill now pending in the House.” State of the

Mine Operators Lunch Campaign to Kill

Metcalt

 

 o;toya

 

A-_-'
I .

 

 t    regon  eeting

Lashing out at any and all proposals for federal mine safety legislation, most of the speakers at the annual
convention of the American Mining -Congress, held in-Portland, Ore. from Sept. 13 to 16, picked the,Mine-Mill-
backed Metcalf-Montoya bill as the focus of their attacks. An afternoon panel session was devoted completely
to a discussion of mine safety.

The only speaker favoring federal legislation in this area was Paul A. Boyajian of the Interior ‘Department, for-
mer chairman of the Interior Department Mine Safety Board, who was not listed on the printed program, but who
did address the panel. His remarks were not well received by the audience.

While most of the other speakers repeated the discredited arguments and slogans that have been advanced over

4 the years by the mining industry in opposition to federal safety legislation, Langan W. Swent, vice-president of the

Homestake Mining Company, revealed the true alarm with which mine operators View the efforts of Mine-Mill and
Congressional supporters of mine safety to secure enactment of the Metcalf-Montoya bill. “if the American non-coal

mining industry wished to avoid
adoption of federal legislation,”
Swent said," “it must do ‘some-
thing more concrete than adopt-
ing annual policy statements.”

He pointed outthat the Ameri-
can Mining Congress last Jan-
uary had established a Non-Coal
Mine Safety Committee, and
listed as its objectives:

L 1) To retain local control over
safety matters. ’

2) To select competent, ade-
quately-paid mine inspectors.

3) To improv e state mining
codes and laws.

Swent said establishment of
local mine operators safety com-
mittees, support by the industry
for improved state safety codes,
more emphasis on safety and
education programs, were “ex-
amples of the type of action

- which our committee believes

must be undertaken in the min-
ing states if federal policing is

to be avoided. The argument
' that this is a field for the states

to police isionly valid as long
as the states are doing a good
job. The states can do a good
job only if the mining industry
aids them and cooperates with
in developing adequate

ment agencies, staffed with ade-
quately paid individuals who
have tenure in their jobs .
an-C‘: ".»:.r.?.i-;i.-
jeci. to changes or pressures re-
sulting from changes in the poli-
tical parties controlling the vari-
ous state capitols.”

Local Mess Admitted

In other words, Swent was
saying that the mining industry
has to put on a show of trying
to clean up the mess that he
admits exists in state mine
safety codes, inspection, and en-
forcement if it is to effectively
counter the drive for federal
legislation. South Dakota, in
which the Homestake Mine is
located, has only one mine in-
spector, who as the “head” of
mine safety work in the state
is paid $3,600 a year.

But, in calling for improve-

are’ therefore not sub-_

ment in the state codes, the
Homestake vice-president of
Grants, N. M. went farther than
many of the other speakers, who
included Frank P. Knight, di-
rector’ of the Arizona Depart-
ment of Mineral Resources;
Miles P. Romney, manager of
the. Utah Mining Association;
and Laurence J. Burton, fresh-

man Republican Congressman,

from Utal1’s 1st District, which
includes the coal, potash, and
uranium mining properties in
Utah as well as some of the
lead-zinc mines.

Propaganda Campaign.
The AMC convention pushed
into full swing the campaign of

the mine operators to defeat
Metcalf-Montoya, which will

«probably come up for Congres-

sional hearings next year. In
addition to the program of the
Non-Coal Mine Safety Commit-
'tee, a campaign of propaganda

is underway, shaping up as
follows:

1) Attack the competence of
the Interior Department Mine
Safety Study Board. Romney of
the Utah Mining Association did
just this in Portland last month
when he charged that the chair-
man and one other member of
the board had no “mine safety
experience.”

2) Attack union motives as
stemming from a desire to get
around state authority andto in-
fluence mine safety codes and
inspection on the national level
through increasing their political
power. Romney also made-this
charge in Portland.

3) Cover up the scandalous
safety conditions in American
metal and non-metallic mines
with phony statistics and planted
articles about what a good job
the state mine inspectors are
doing. "

. . Big land deals have been concluded recently by major U.S.
non-ferrous producers. Kennecott Copper and the Anaconda Com-
pany between them have purchased or leased nearly 30,000 acres
in northwestern Lewis and Clark County,,Montana for mineral ex-
ploration. American Smelting and Reﬁning Company has recently
leased 12,000 acres south of American Zinc, Lead & Smelting
Company’s zinc mines in eastern Tennessee. AS&R will explore
for zinc on the leases, for which it paid $125 per acre for three-

Sharing Profits in Mexico

Mexico’s profit sharing law became effective earlier this year,
with the first distribution of profits to company employees. Included
in the program were employees of American Smelting and Refin-

ing Company in Mexico and at properties formerly entirely owned-

by American Metals Climax, but in which that company now holds
only a 49 percent interest. One half of the profits distributed were
shared equally by all employees, based on number of days_worked
in the previous year; the other half was distributed in proportion
to employees’ straight time annual earnings. Mexican authorities
have estimated that the profits distributed to workers will range
from 2.8 percent to 12.6 percent of total company net profits, on
top of the workers’. other pay.

Buffalo Worker.

Awarded New  
Job, Back Pay

BUFFALO, N.Y.—Fred Roth,
formerly a janitor in the ma-
chine shop at the Anaconda
American Brass Company plant
here, was awarded a position as
saw grinder and conditioner,
Class D and back pay to May 8,
1963, when Arbitrator I. Robert
Feinberg handed down his de-

cision on the case late in Au?,

gust.

pany did not comply with the
correct job posting procedure
when it refused to grant Roth a
10-day training period for the

job which he bid for almost a_

year and a half ago. Although
the job posting procedure was
never signed by representatives

of the company and union, Fein- —

berg said that it is indeed part
of the contract.

International Representative: -
Joseph 'Scioli, who, along with  if

Stanley Wenham, president ‘of
Mine-Mill Local 593, presented
the case for the union, said that
the arbitration victory
significance in all Anaconda, es-

pecially ABC, plants throughout,

the country.”

The back pay Roth will re-
ceive will be the difference be.-
tween the rate for janitor and
that for saw grinder.

The company originally denied
the job to Roth, saying that vo-
cational school education or_ its
equivalent in experience was
necessary for any job in the
machine shop other than janitor.‘
The job posting procedure, how-

ever, states that prior experi—,;.‘..-.

ence shall have value in deter-
mining the qualifications of a
job applicant “in jobs higher
than ‘E’ class.”

The arbitration decision di-A

rects the company to give Roth
a “reasonable training period”
for the new job, not to exceed

. 10 working days.

The job posting procedure was
negotiated between the com-
pany and union in 1950, and has
been in effect since that time.

Roth, at the time of the dis-
pute, had only a total of 91/2
months of seniority with the
company-—seven months as a
production laborer, two months
as a yard laborer, and two
weeks as a janitor. He was the
only bidder for the saw grinder
job back in May, 1963.

 Baitlefor Safely Reviewed llMWA Convention

 

 

 

 

Marling J . Ankeny, director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, addressing the-constitutional conven-
tion of -the United Mine Workers of America on Sept. 10‘, paid tribute to “the one and only John
L. Lewis, the greatest labor leader of our times” and to his “former assistant, loyal disciple, and

capable successor———your present great leader—Tony Boyle.”

Harbor, Florida.

The convention washeld at Bal

Ankeny, who was a featured speaker at Mine-lVlill’s 70th anniversary convention last year in
Denver, devoted the major portion of his speech to the struggle of the coal miners union to estab-
lish safety standards in the industry—first by helping to get the Bureau of Mines established in
1910, and then by obtaining Congressional passage of the two basic federal coal mine safety laws
now on the books. He concluded his address on the note that the struggle for improvements in

these laws still continues.

The-‘record of this struggle will be of interest to members of Mine-Mill, who have waged a

15-year battle for similar legis-
lation applicable to metal and
non-metallic mines.
Quote_d.._-‘below are eascerpts

“. . . the great Monongsh dis-

on December 66, i1907,"killing
-more than 362 miners, and the
'- great Barr disaster in]Pennsyl-
Vania on December 19, 1907, in
which 239 were killed. More

. than 600 American coal miners

r lost their lives in fourteendays!
“This terrible slaughter led to

your union’s officers that culmi-
-"nated in the enactment of the

, t ‘- law that established the United

_States]Bureau "of Mines in-"1910.
“The first mission of our
Bureau was to find what was
_causing the terrible widespread
-disasters in coal -mines and to
develop means for their preven-
-' tion. In those days, miners knew
‘ about the explosive character of
methane gas, but virtually none
was aware of the now well-
known fact that coal dust also
was explosive and capable of
propagating an explosion
throughout a mine even though
no methane was present in the
mine atmosphere, and that rock
dust properly applied, could
eliminate the explosive effect of
coal dust. . . .

Dishearfening Task
“During the decade 1911-1920,
105. disasters occurred, causing
-the loss of.2,486 lives. It must
have been a disheartening, if

.vr;z;.v2e-anot ‘ impossible, task in those

days to convince the coal-mining

industry that it should rock dust

its mines and provide better
ventilation.

ress in combating the menace
of coal-mine disasters. This was
a period of great growth in mine
electrification and the beginning
of mine mechanization, resulting
in increasing the gas-ignition
hazard. During this decade 113
coal-mine-explosion disasters
occurred, causing the death of
2,568 miners. . . ,

“The next decade, 1931-1940,
saw the restoration of relative
prosperity, governmental recog-
nition of the rights of labor to

organize and bargain collec-

tively, the resurgence of" the
United Mine Workers of Amer-
ica, stronger than ever under

I the leadership of a great man,

John L. Lewis, and the first real
significant reduction in the num-
ber of mine disasters and deaths
therefrom. During this period
43 explosion disasters. occurred
with a total loss of life of 791
miners. ‘

“Despite the substantial_ im-
provement-in-the death toll of
this ten-year period -over the
previous ones, the last ylar of
the decade, 1940, ‘came up with
a very bad record . . . a total of
276 killed in major explosion
disasters in just one year. .
Our reports on these disasters

or to the public in gene-ral.

Copies were given only to the -
operator‘ of the mine at which’

an investigation was conducted.
Reports Made Public

‘ -“On the occasion of the Pond-

Creek No. 1 disaster, Bartley,
W. Va. .  John L. Lewis . . .
demanded of the Hon. Harold L.

lckes, then Secretary of the In-

terior, that the Bartley report
be made public. . . . Mr. Ickes
acceded and the Bureau, as the
investigator, received instruc-
tions that the Bartley report . . .
and . . . all future reports of
mine-disaster investigations
must be published. . . .

“The result was enactment by
the 77th Congress of Public Law
49, which became effective May
7, 1941 . .It established a
definite procedure for federal
coal-mine inspections and inves-
tigations. . . . However, the first
law lacked ‘teeth’ because it
did not give the federal inspec-
tors power to enforce safety
regulations. . . .

“During the period 1941-1950,
there were 46 major coal-mine
disasters with a total loss of life
of 796 persons--,a record no
better than the preceding decade
—but the encouraging factor
was that during the last two
years of the decade—1949 and
1950—no major disasters oc-
curred. . . . , ‘

“One can hardly speak of
that period of 1946-1947 without

mentioning the terrible disaster .

at No. 3 mine, Centralia, Illi-
nois, which occurred on March
25, 1947, killing 111 miners,
while the mine was being oper-
ated under government control.

“. . . The Coal Mines Admin-
istrator directed that 518 gov-
ernment-operated soft-coal
mines be closed and remain

‘closed indefinitely; because a

review of federal inspection re-
ports disclosed that, out of .a
total of 520 coal mines, which

were federally inspected, only’

two were free of violation of the
Federal’ Mine Safety Code. No
mine was permitted to reopen
until it was inspected by a fed-
eral inspector and found to be
free of code violations.

new legislation, giving the fed-.

eral in s p e c to r s enforcement

powers. Nevertheless it took an-

other widespread disaster with
large loss of life to spur pos-
itive Congressional action. -

“The decade. 1951-1960 brought

another substantial drop in the -
“number of major coal-mine dis-
.asters T and saw another long
-step forward taken in the field
' of safety legislation. During this
. periodthere were 20 major Qmine’
disasters--with a l'osso_fi334 lives.
.What a contrast with the first

decade of the 20th century when

‘ there’ were 113 major explosion
disasters with a loss of 3,321‘

lives! . . .- But the sixth decade

of the 20th century saw the

great Orient No. 2 disaster at

-West Frankfort, Illinois. On De-

cember 21, 1951, at about 7:40
p.m., a general gas and dust
explosion occurred in the Orient
No. 2 mine, causing the death

of 119 men.

Enforcement Powers‘

“The great loss of life result-
ing from the Orient No. 2 dis-

‘aster brought forth a "storm of '

public indignation, resulting in
another series of Congressional
hearings on coal-m in e-safety

' legislation .  The result of the

hearings was the enactment of
the present Federal Coal Mine
Safety Act. ‘This Act incorpo-
