1969

SPRING — Angela Davis, graduate student
of the University of California, San Diego, ac-
cepts a two-year contract as Assistant Profes-
sor of Philosophy at UCLA. The question of her
being a Communist arises because of state-
ments made by an FBI agent. In response to
inquiries by the university chancellor she
states publicly she is a member of the Che-
Lumumba Club of the Communist Party of
Southern California.

SEPTEMBER 19 — University of California
Regents vote to fire Miss Davis under a 29-
year-old university rule barring employment
of Communists. The academic community
of UCLA sees this move as part of a continuing
attack by the Regents against the university
as well as an attack on movements on Blacks,
women, youth, workers and progressives.

OCTOBER 3 — The faculty votes 539-12
to condemn the Regents’ ruling, and 551 - 4
to rescind its own 1950 resolution against hir-
ing Communists.

OCTOBER 6 —- Over 2,000 students show
up for the first lecture of Miss Davis’ course,
“Recurring Philosophical Themes in Black Lit-
erature.”

Outrage at her firing grows on a national

scale with even large portions of the Establish-.

ment considering it, for various reasons, to be
a bad move.

OCTOBER 20 — A Superior Court judge
rules that the firing was unconstitutional and
orders Miss Davis reinstated. For the rest of
the school year she becomes the target of
harassment by right-wingers, racists and
kooks. Threats are made against her life and
it is necessary for her to be accompanied by
bodyguards wherever she goes. Nonetheless,
she actively engages in the struggles of the
Black community, particularly the defense of
the Black Panther Party and the Soledad
Brothers, three Black inmates at Soledad State
Prison being framed for murder of a white
guard.

Jonathan Jackson, brother of one of the
accused inmates, works closely with Angela
Davis in the movement to free the Soledad
Brothers and becomes one of her bodyguards.

JUNE 8 — The Regents, waiting until the
school year is over, vote again not to renew
her contract for the coming year, this time
citing her “extramural activities" on behalf of
the Soledad Brothers and the Black Panther
Party. '

JUNE 11 — The UCLA faculty again votes
to support her and even to pay her salary out
of their own.

By the end of July there are published re-
ports that Soledad Prison authorities are hu-
miliating accused inmates and their families,
preventing their lawyers from access to vital
information, remodeling the scene of the
crime and transferring potential defense wit-
nesses to other prisons.

AUGUST 7 — Jonathan Jackson enters a
courtroom in San Rafael where a Black San
Quentin prisoner in on trial for his life on char-
ges of assaulting a guard. He hands weapons
to the defendant and two other inmates pres-
ent as witnesses. Five hostages are seized, in-
cluding the judge. According to the LOS AN-
GELES TIMES, someone shouts, “We want the
Soledad Brothers freed by 12:30 today!”

ANGELA!

As the group attempts to escape, San
Quentin guards and police open fire. Jackson,
the defendant, one of the other inmates and
the judge are killed. Police say the judge was
killed by a blast from the shotgun Jackson
brought into the courtroom.

Within a few days the police state that all
four weapons brought in by Jackson are regis-
tered in the name of Angela Davis.

AUGUST 1 1 — A warrant is issued for Miss
Davis’ arrest, stating that she provided the
guns for the break-out and is therefore an ac-
complice to kidnapping and murder — charges
which in California carry the death penalty.

AUGUST 16 — Miss Davis avoids being
served the arrest warrant and a federal fugi-
tive warrant is issued, bringing the FBI into
the case.

AUGUST 17 — Affidavits are filed by
Marin County District Attorney Bruce Bales
that the guns were purchased in 1968, 1969
and 1970 by Angela Davis.

AUGUST 19 — Miss Davis is placed on the
10 most-wanted list of the FBI — the third
woman in history to be so placed. She is de-
scribed by the FBI as “possibly armed and
dangerous.”

OCTOBER 13 — Following a nationwide
manhunt, Miss Davis is arrested in a midtown
Manhattan motel with a companion, David
Poindexter, who is charged with “harboring a
fugitive.” She is held without bail at the Wo-
men's House of Detention. Poindexter is re-
leased on $100,000 bail.

OCTOBER 21 —- Governor Rockefeller
signs an order to extradite Miss Davis to
California.

OCTOBER 23 — She is transferred from a
normal cell to solitary confinement where she
is subjected to 24-hour guard, searches every
three hours and complete isolation from other
inmates. The following day she begins a hun-
ger strike to protest this treatment.

NOVEMBER 4 — A Federal judge rules
there has been no justification for placing her
in solitary and orders that she be given the
same treatment as other inmates.

NOVEMBER 5 — Attorneys John J. Abt
and Margaret Burnham file a petition of ha-
beas corpus, exposing “hopeless deficiencies”
in the affidavit forming the basis of Miss
Davis’ arrest. A hearing on petition was set
for November 20.

NOVEMBER 10 -— A Marin County Grand
Jury returns an indictment against Miss Davis
charging her with conspiracy, kidnapping and
murder. This takes precedence over the pre-
vious affidavit and extradition order.

NOVEMBER 16 — Gov. Rockefeller signs a
new extradition order based on the grand jury
indictment.

NOVEMBER 17 — At arraignment, Decem-
ber 1 is set as the date for filing a habeas cor-
pus petition, and December 3 for a hearing on
the extradition order.

Dec. 3 - New York State Supreme Court
Justice Thomas Dickens denies the petition for
the habeas corpus writ, and grants Angela's
attorneys 5 days in which to appeal the denial
to the Appellate Division of the New York
State Supreme Court.
