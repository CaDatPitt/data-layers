THIS ADMINISTRATION

HAS IIEED WAR  

The proposed Federal budget is
a direct attack on millions of
Americans and a threat to
peace.

The administration is cutting
and gutting 83 people's programs
to bloat the Pentagon with
billions of additional dollars.

If you’re poor; you’ve had it. If
_vou‘re middle class.‘ you suffer.

This one third of American fami-
lies who receive somcionn of

-ll Allll MAROH T0 WASHINGWN MAY 38!) TO SAY: --

Thc Pentagon-Administration
budget means.
MORE IN F LATlON

The Pentagon war build-up will almost double
the previous budgct.dct'icit. Mort deﬁcit
spending means higher inﬂation rates. higher
iritercst rates-had ncivs for you, and for Civil-
ian ltusincss. We can‘t afford an inflationary
arms’ race. Neither can the l-tussi.-ins.

Most cconomists agree that defense outlays are
more inﬂationary than private spending he-
causc defense compctcs with civilian mduRlT_\’
for skilled labor. metals and materials. This
drives up costs for consumer goods.

The Pcntagon~Administration
budget means
LESS JOBS

The US. Labor Dcpartnient reports that mtli
tary spending creates fewer jobs than civilian
spending. One billion dollars spent in the
military sector creates 45,800 jobs. Spent on
mass transit it would mean 65,000 jobs. On
solar cncrgy and conservation. 65,000 jobs.

Japan and our European competitors spend
two to three times less of their GTOSS National
Product on defense than docs the U.S.A. This
diversion of invcstmcnt dollars wcalicns
the competitive position of US. business.
Result’? Unemployment.

Th: May 3rd March on
Washington is endorsed by
hundmls of religious. peace.
union. black. environmental
and women's groups.

The l’en.tag'on-Administration
budget means
LESS SECURITY

A nuclear war mcans death for-iintold millions
and a cancerous planet for those who survive.
Our generation has no moral right to contami~
nan: this planet for those who follow.

For true security we must seek disarmament
agrccmcms, not more weapons. Nuclear con-
frontation politics of this administration lessen
world st-curity, as many ofour European allies
are saying.

The Pentagon~Administration
Budget means

LESS APPROVAL FOR
REAGAN

The Gallup Poll shows that Reagan's handling
of his job has 1955 public support than any
newly clccicd Presidcnt in 28 years. l5? na-
tional org.anizations have come out in opposi~
lion in his budget; educators, womi.-n’s groups.
students. environmentalists. civil rights and
civil liberties groups. lawyers. Catholic and
other church groups. Count them all up and
you have the real American majority.

Together, Americans have changed the course
of other administrations. Let's make the May
3rd dcmonstrationa push for peace and
people.
