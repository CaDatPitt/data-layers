one third of the whole day forhimself, the

L capitalist will get four shillings, and the rate

of proﬁt will be 200 per cent. If the work-

ing man receives four shillings. the capit_al- i

ist will only receive two, and the rate of
proﬁt would sink to 50 per cent., but all
these variations will not affect the value of
the commodity. A general rise of wages
would, -therefore, result in a fall of the gen-
eral rate of proﬁt, but not affect values.
But although the values of commodities,
which must ultimately regulate their mar-
ket prices, are exclusively determined by
the total quantities of labor ﬁxed in them,
and not by the division of that quantity
into paid and unpaid labor, it by no means
follows that the values of the single com-
modities, or lots of commodities, produced
during twelve hours, for example, will re-
main constant. The number or mass of
commodities produced in a given time of la-
bor, or bya given qu=.1ntity of labor, depends
upon the productive [mwer of the labor em-
ployed, and not upon its extent or length.
With one degree of the productive power

day of twelve hours may produce twelve
pounds of yarn, with a lesser degree of pro-
ductiv'e power only two pounds. If then
twelve hours’ average labor were realized in
the value of six shillings in the one case,
the twelve pounds of yarn would cost six
shillings, in the other case the two {pounds
of yarn would also cost six shillings. One
pound of yarn would, therefore, cost six-
pence in the one. case, and three shillings in
the other. The difference of price would
result from the difference in the productive
powers of labor employed. ‘One hour of
labor would be realized in one pound of
yarn with the greater productive power,

,while with the smaller productive power,‘

six hours of labor would be realized in one
pound of yarn. The price of a pound of
yarn would, in the one instance, be only six-
pcnce, although wages were relatively high
and the rate of proﬁt low ;-it would be three
shillings in the other instance, although
wages were low and the rate of proﬁt high.
This would be so because the price of the
pound of yarn is regulated by the total
amount of labor worked up -in it, and ‘not by

mo ‘VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT”

the iproportional division of that total
a*m0imt— into’ paid and unpaid labor.» The
fact I have “ before mentioned that high-
pr_iced\labor may produce cheap, and- low—,
priced labor may produceﬂdear commodities,
loses, therefore, its paradoxical appearance.
It is only the expression of the general law’
1 that the value of a commodity is regulated
by the quantity of labor worked up in it,
and that the quantity of labor worked up in-
it dependsyaltogether upon the productive

MAIN CASES or ATTEMPTS_ AT RAISING
WAGES on RESISTING THEIR FALL

_ Let us now seriously consider the main
cases in which a rise of wages is attempted

_or a reduction of wages resisted.

I. We have seen that the value of the

laboring power, or in moreupopular parlance. ,

the value of labor, is determined by the value
of necessaries, or the quantity of labor re-
quired to produce them. If, then, in a

. givencountry the value of the daily average

necessaries of the laborer represented six
hours of labor expressed in three shillings,
the laborer would have to work six hours
daily to produce an equivalent for his daily
maintenance. ‘If the whole working day
was twelve hours, the capitalist would pay

‘him the value of his labor by paying him

three shillings. Half the working’. day

‘ u would be unpaid labor, and the rate of proﬁt

IQI

/102‘ VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

would amount to Iooiper cent. But now
suppose that, consequent upon a decrease of
productivity, .more labor should’ be wanted
to produce, say, the same amount of agri-
cultural produce, so that the price of the
average daily necessaries should rise from
three to four shillings, In that case the
value of labor would rise by one third, or
33% per cent; Eight hours of the working
day would be required toproduce an equiva-
lent for the daily maintenance of the laborer,
according to his ’old standard of living.
The surplus labor would therefore sink
fromsix hours to four, and the rate of proﬁt

‘from Ioo to 50 per cent. But in insisting

upon a rise of wages, the laborer would
only insist upon getting the urcreased value
of his lab0r,'like every other‘ seller of a
commo_dity, who, the costs of his commodi-
ties having increased, tries to get its in.—
creased value paid. If wages did not rise,
or not sufﬁciently rise, to compensate for
the increased values of necessaries, the price
of labor would sink below the value of la-
bor, and the labor_er’s standard of life would
deteriorate. ‘

 

 

  

ATTEMPTS AT RAISING WAGES $63

But‘ a change might also take place in an
opposite direction. By, virtue of the in-
creased productivity of labor, the same
amount of the average -daily necessaries
might sink from three to two shillings, or
only four hours out of the working day, in-
stead of six, be wanted to reproduce an
equivalent for the value of the daily neces-
saries. The working man would now be
able to buy with two shillings as many nec-
essaries as he did before with three shillings.
Indeed, the value of labor would have sunk,
but that diminished value would command
the same amount of commodities as before.
Then proﬁts would rise from ‘three to four
shillings, and the rate of proﬁt from I00 to
zooeper cent; Although the laborer’s abso-
lute standard of life would have remained
the same, his relative wages, and therewith
his relative social position, as compared with
that of the capitalist, would have been low-
ered. If the working man should resist
that reduction of relative wages, he would

only try to get some share in the increased ,

productive powers of his own labor, and to
maintain his-‘former relative position in the

  

I04’, VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

social scale. -Thus, after the abolition of
the.CornLaws, and in ﬂagrant violation of
the most solemn pledges given during the
anti—corn law agitation, the English ‘factory’
lords -generally reduced wages ten per cent.

, The resistance of the workmen was at ﬁrst

bafﬂed, but, consequent upon circumstances
I cannot now entertupon, the ten per cent.
lost were afterwards regained.

2. The values of necessaries, and conse«
quently the value of labor, might remain
the same, but a change might occurin their
money prices, consequent upon a previous
change in the value of money.

By the discovery of more fertile mines
and so forth, two ounces of gold might, for
example, cost no more labor. to produce
than one ounce did before.“ The value of
gold would then be depreciated by one half,
or ﬁfty per cent. As the values of all other

commodities would then be expressed in

twice their former money prices, so also

the same with the value of labor. Twelve _

hours of‘ labor, formerly expressed in six

‘shillings, would now be expressed in twelve

shillings. If the working man’s wages

\

ATTEMPTS AT RAISING WAGES 

should remain three shillings, instead of ris-
ing to six shillings, the money price of his
labor would only be equal to half the value
of his labor, and his standard of life would
fearfully deteriorate. This would also hap-
pen in a greater or lesser degree if his

' wages should rise, but not proportionately

to the fall in. the value of gold. In such a
case nothing would have been changed,
either in the productive powers of labor, or
in supply and demand, or invalues. Noth-

ing could have changed except the money

names of those values. To say that in such
a case the workman ought not to insist upon
a proportionate rise of wages, is to say that
he must be content to be paid with names,
instead of with things. All past history
proves that whenever such a depreciation of
money occurs, the capitalists are on the alert
to seize this opportunity for defrauding the
workman. A very large school of political
economists assert that, consequent upon the
new discoveries of gold lands, the better
working of silver mines, and the cheaper

supply of quicksilver, the value of precious-

metals -has been again depreciated. This

 VALUE, PRICE AND. PROFIT

would explain the general and simultaneous
attempts on the Continent at a rise of wages.

.3. We have till now supposed that the
working day has given limits. The work-
ing day, however, has, by itself, no constant
limits. Itpis the constant tendency‘ of capi-
tal to stretch it to its utmost physically pos-
siblelength, because in the same degree sur-
plus labor, and consequently the proﬁt re-
sulting therefrom, will be increased. The
more capita-1 succeeds in prolonging the
working day, the greater the amount of
other peoples’ labor it will appropriate.
During the seventeenth and even ‘the ﬁrst
two thirds of the eighteenth century a ten
hours working day was the normal working
day allover England. During the anti-
Jacobin war, which was in fact a war waged
by. the British barons; against the British
working masses, capital celebrated i_ts abac-

pchanalia, and prolonged the worki_ng day

fromten to twelve. fourteen, eighteen hours.
Malthus,' by no means a man whom you

would" suspect of a‘ maudlin sentimentalism, '

declared ‘in a pamphlet, published about

.I.8I5,.that if this sort of thing was to go on

    

    

A'rmMM-s .4"-r RAISING WAGES 107

the life. of the nation would be attacked at
its very source. a A few years before the
general introduc_tion of the newly-invented
machinery, about 1765, at pamphlet appeared
in England under the title, An Essay on
Trade. The anonymous author, an avowed
enemy of the working classes, declaims on
the necessity of expanding the limits of the
working day. Amongst other means to

this ends, he proposes working houses,
lwhich, he says, ought to be “Housesof
Terror.” And what is the length of the

working day he /prescribes for these
" Houses of Terror”? . Twelve hours, the
very same time which in 1832 was declared
by capitalists, political economists, and min-
isters_to be not only the existing but the
necessary time of labor for a child under
twelve years. .

By selling his laboring power, and he
must do so under the present system, the
working man makes over to the capitalist
the consumption of that power, but within
certain rational limits. He sells his labor-
ing power in order to maintain it, apart
from its natural wear and tear, but not to

PizoDUc'rIoN AND WAGES

Citizen Weston’s argument rested, in.fact,
upon two premises: firstly, that the amount
of national production is a fixed thing, a
constant quantity or magnitude, as the math-
ematicians would say; secondly, that the
amount of real wages, that is to say, of
wages as measured by the quantity of the

- commodities they can buy, is a fixed amount,

a constant magnitude. ,
Now, his ﬁrst assertion is evidently er-
roneous.‘ Year after year you will ﬁnd that

the value and mass of production increase, ‘

that the productive powers of the national
labor increase, and that the amount of
money necessary to circulate this increasing

destroy it. In selling his laboring power at
its daily or weekly value, it is understood
that in one day or one week that laboring
power shall not be submitted to two days’
or two weeks’ waste or ‘wear, and tear.

_ Take a machine worth £1000. If it is used

 
  
  

up in ten years it will add to the value of the
commodities in whose production it assists
£100 yearly. If it is used up in ﬁve years

_ ‘it. will add £200 yearly, or the value of its

  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

annual wear and tear is in inverse ratio to
the quickness with which it is consumed.
But this distinguishes the working man
from the machine. Machinery does not

i wear out exactly in the same, ratio in which

it is used. Man, on the contrary, decays
in a greater ratio than would be visible from
the mere numerical addition of work.

In their attempts at reducing the working
day to its former rational dimensions, or,
where they cannot enforce a legal ﬁxation
of a normal working day, at checking over-
work by a rise ofwages, a rise not only ~in

‘proportion to the surplus time exacted, but

 
 
   

in a‘ greater proportion, working men fulﬁl
only a duty to themselvesand their race.

They only set limits to the tyrannical usur-
pations of capital. Time is the room of hu-
man development. A man who has no free
time to dispose of, whose whole lifetime,
apart from the mere physical interruptions
by sleep, meals, and so forth, is absorbed by
his labor for the capitalist, is less than a
beast of burden. He isa mere machine for
producing Foreign Wealth, broken in body
and brutalized in mind. Yet the whole his-
tory of modern industry shows that capital,
if not checked, will recklessly and ruthlessly
work to cast down the whole working class
to this utmost state of degradation.

In prolonging the working day the.capi-
talist may pay higher wages and still lower
the value of labor, if the rise of wages does
not correspond to .the greater amount of la-
bor extracted,~and the quicker decay of the
laboring power thus caused. This may be
done" in another way. Your middle—class
statisticians will tell you, for instance. that
the average wages of factory families in
Lancashire has risen. They forget that in-
stead of the labor of the man, the head -of

the family, his wife and perhaps three or _

‘IIO / VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

  

four children are now thrown under the Jug»
gernaut wheels of capital, and that the rise
of the aggregate wages does not correspond

 

 

 

to the aggregate surplus labor extracted

fromthe family. .

: Even with given limits of the ‘working
day, such as they now exist in all branches
of industry subjected to the factory laws,

_ a rise of wages may become necessary, if

 

only to keep up the old standard value of
labor. By increasing the intensity of la-
bor, a man may be made to expend as much
vital force in one hour as he formerly did in
two. This has, to a certain degree, been
effected in the trades, placed under theMFac~
tory Acts, by the acceleration of machinery,

V and the greater number of working ma-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

chines which a single individual has now to
superintend. _If the increase in the intens-
ity of labor or the mass of labor spent inan
hour keeps some fair proportion to the de-

 

crease in the extent of the working day, the ‘

working man will still be_the winner, If

 

this limit is overshot, he loses in one form _

What he has gainedtin another, and ten
hours‘ of labor may then become asruinous

as twelve hours were before. In checking
this tendency of capital, by ‘struggling for
a rise of wages corresponding to the rising
intensity of labor, the working man only re-
sists the depreciation of histlabor and the
deterioration of his race.

4. All of you know that, from reasons I
have not now to explain, capitalistic pro-

v duction moves through certain periodical

cycles. It moves through a state of quies-
cence, growing animation, prosperity, over-
trade, crisis, and stagnation. The, market
prices of commodities, and the market rates
of proﬁt, follow these phases, now sinking
below their averages, now rising above
them. Considering the whole, cycle, you
will ﬁnd that one deviation of the market

. price’ is being compensated by the other,

and that, taking the average of the cycle,
the market prices of commodities are regu-
lated by their values. Well! During the
phases of sinking market prices and the
phases of crisis and stagnation, the working
man, if not thrown out of employment alto-
gether, is sure to have his wages lowered.
Not to be defrauded, he must, even with

‘ such a fall of market prices, debate with the

capitalist in what proportional degree a fall
of wages has become necessary. If, (hiring
thephases of prosperity, when extra proﬁts
are made, he did not battle for a rise of
wages, he would, taking the average of one
industrial cycle, not even receive his average
wages, or the value of his labor. It is the
utmost height of folly to demand, that while
his wages are necessarily affected by the ad-
verse phases of the cycle, he should ex-
clude himself from compensation during the
prosperous phases of the cycle. Generally,
the values of all commodities are only real-
ized by the. compensation of the continu-
ously changing market prices, springing
from the continuous ﬁuctuations of demand
and supply. On the basis of the present
system labor is only a commodity like oth-
ers. It must, therefore, pass through the
same ‘ﬂuctuations to fetch an average price
corresponding to its value. It would be ab-
surd to treat it on the one hand as a com-
modity, and to want on the other hand_to

‘exempt it from the laws.which regulate the

prices of commodities. The slave receives

ATTEMPTS AT RAISING WAGES 1: 3

a permanent and ﬁxed amount of mainte-

nance; the wages laborer does not. He_

must try to get a rise of wages in the one
instance, if only to compensate for a fall of
wages in the other. If he resigned himself
to accept the will, the dictates of the capital-
ist as a permanent economical law, he would
share in all the miseries of the slave, with-
out the security of_the slave. '

5. In all the cases I have considered, and
they "form ninety-nine out of a hundred,‘ you

. have seen that a struggle for a rise of wages

follows only in the track of previous
changes, and is the necessary offspring of
previous changes in the amount of produc-
tion, the productive powers of labor,‘ the
value of labor, the value of money, the ex-
tent or the intensity of labor extracted, the
fluctuations of market prices, dependent

.upon the ﬂuctuations of demand and supply,

and cpnsistent with the different phases of
the industrial cycle; in one word, as reac-
tions of labor against the previous action of
capital. By treating the struggle for a rise

THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN CAPITAL AND
“LABOR AND ITS RESULTS

I. Having shown that the periodical re-
sistance on the part of the working men
against a reduction of wages, and their peri-
odical attempts at getting a rise of, wages,
are inseparable from the wages system, and
dictated by the very fact of labor being as‘-

similated “to commodities, and therefore sub-
ject to the laws regulating the general
movement of prices; having, furthermore,
shown that a general’ rise of wages would
result in a fall in. the general rate of proﬁt,
but not affect the average prices’ of com-

lmodities, or their values, the question now

ultimately arises, how far, in this incessant
struggle between capital and labor, the lat-
ter is likely to prove successful.

I might answer by a generalization, and

 say that, as with all other commodities, so

115

I16 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

, with labor, its market price will, in the long,

run, adapt itself to its value; that, therefore, .

despite all the ups and dowhs, and do
what he may, the working man will, on an
average, only receive the value of his la-
bor, which resolves into the value of his
laboring power, which is determined by’ the
value of the necessaries required for its
maintenance and reproduction, which value
of necessaries H ﬁnally is regulated by the
quantity of labor, wanted to produce them.

But there are some peculiar features
which distinguish the value of the laboring
power, or the value of labor, from the values
of all other commodities. The value of the
laboring power is formed by two elements
——the one merely physical, the other his-
torical or social. ' Its ultimate limit is de-
termined-by the physical element, that is to
say, to maintain and reproduce itself, to per-
petuate its physical» existence, the working

class must receive the necessaries absolutely a

indispensable for living and multiplying.
The value of those indispensable necessaries
forms, therefore, the ultimate limit of the
value of labor. On the other hand, the

«

THE STRUGGLE I I 7

length of the working day is also limited/bye

ultimate, although very elastic boundaries.
Its ultimate limit is given by the physical
force of the. laboring man. If the daily
exhaustion of his vital forces exceeds a
certain degree, it cannot be exerted anew,
day by day; V» However, as I said, this limit
is very‘ elastic. A quick succession of un-
healthy and short-lived generations will
keep the labor market as well supplied as a

‘series of vigorous and long—lived genera-

tions. A
Besides this mere physical element, the
value of labor is in every country deter-
mined by a traditional standard of ‘life. It
is not mere physical life, but it is the satis-
faction of certain wants springing from the
social conditions in which people are placed
and reared up. The English standard of

life may be reduced to the Irish standard;

the standard of life of a German peasant to
that of a Livonian peasant. The important
part which historical tradition and ‘social
habitude play in this respect, you may learn

from Mr. Thornton's work on Over—p0pu—'.

Iaz‘z°01z_, where he shows that the average

IO VALUE, PRICE~AND PROFIT

 

production continuously changes; What is.

true at the end of the year, and for different
years compared with each other, is true for
every average day of the year. The
amount or magnitude of national produc-
tion changes continuously. It is not a con.-

staut but a variable magnitude, and apart

from I changes in population it must be so,
because of the continuous change in the ac-
cumulation of capital and the productive
powers of labor. It is perfectly true that
if:a' rise in the general rate of wages should

‘v:ta.ﬂl§e,place to—day, that rise,‘ whatever‘ its

ii H‘-uiltieprior effects might be, would, by itself, ‘

  1-;:j,,.;nQt immediately change the amount of pro-
 duction. It would, in the ﬁrst instance, pro-

ceed from the existing state of things. But
if before the rise of_ wages the national pro—

duction was variable, and not fixed, it will i

continue to be variable and not ﬁxed after
the rise of wages.
V But suppose the amount of national pro—

duction to be constant instead of variable. ‘

Even then, what our friend Weston consid-
ers a logical conclusion would still remain
a gratuitous assertion. If I have a given

‘I18 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

‘Wages in different agricultural districts. of

England still nowadays differ more or xess
according to the more or less favorable cirx
cumstances under which the districts have
emerged from the state of serfdom. '

This historical or social element, entering

i into the value of labor, may be expanded,

or contracted, or altogether‘ extinguished, r

so that nothingiremains but the physical
limit. During the time of the anti—_Iaeobin
war, undertaken, as the incorrigible tax-

‘ eater and sinecurist, old George Rose, used

to say, to save the comforts of our holy re»

A ligion from the inroads of the French inﬁ-

dels, the honest English farmers, so tenderly
handled‘ -in a former chapter of ’ ours, de-

pressed the wages of the agricultural la-_
borers even beneath that mere physirayl minia

mumgbutiimadeyup by Poor Laws the re»

.mainder necessary for the physical pepetu-

ation of the race. a This was a glorious way
to convert the wages laborer into a slave,
and Shakespeare’s proud yeoman into a
pauper. '

By comparing the standard wagesor va1- —

ues of labor in different countries, and by

  

/

THE STRUGGLE

 

119

comparing them in different historical epochs
of the same country, you will ﬁnd that the
value of labor itself is not a ﬁxed but avari-
able magnitude, even supposing the values
of all other commodities to remain constant.

A similar comparison would prove that
not only the market rates of proﬁt change,
but its average rates. '

"But as to proﬁts, there exists no law
which determines their minimum. We can-
not say what is the ultimate limit of their
decrease. And why cannot we ﬁx that
limit? Because, although we can ﬁx the
minimum of wages. we cannot ﬁx their
maximum. We can only say that, the lim-
itsiof the working day being given, the
maximum of proﬁt corresponds to the phys-
ical minimum of wages; and that wages be-
ing given, the maximum of pro/it corre-

sponds to such a prolongation of the work-

 

in_g_dayas is compatible with thefphysical
forces of the laborer. The maximum of

   

  

proﬁt is therefore limited by the physical

minimum of wages and the physical maxi-

mum of the worki_ng day. It is evident that e

rate of profit“ an immense scale of variations
is possible. The ﬁxation of -its actual d-e-

gree is only settled by the continuous strug- ‘

gle between capital and labor, thecapitalist
constantly tending to reduce wages to their
physical minimum, and to extend the work-,
ing day to its physical maximum, while the
Working man constantly presses in the op-
posite direction.

The matter resolves itself into a‘ question
of the respective powers of the combatants.

2., As to the limitation of the working

day in England, as in all other countries, it

 

has never been settled except by legislative
interference. Without the working men’s
continuous pressure from without that in-
terference would never have taken place.
But at" all events, the result was not to be
attained by private settlement between the
working men and the capitalists. This very
necessity‘ of general political action. ‘affords

 

 

the proof that in its merely economic ac-‘ 7

tion capital is the stronger side. ,

As to the Limits of the ralne of labor, its
actual settlement always depends upon sup-
ply and demand, I mean the demand for la-

  

  

THE STRUGGLE V 121

V bor on the part. of capital, and the supply of

labor by the working men. In colonial
countries the law of supply and demand fa+
vors the working man. Hence the rela-

‘ tively high standard of wages in the United

States. Capital may t-here try its utmost.
It cannot prevent the labor market from be-
ing continuously emptied by the continuous
conversion of wages laborers, into inde-
pendent, self-sustaining peasants. The posi-

 

tion of wages laborer is for a very’ large -

part of the American people but a proba-

tional state, which they are sure to leave

    

within a longer or shorter term. To mend
this colonial state of things, the paternal
British Government acceptedfor some time
what is ‘called the. modern colonization
theory, which consists in putting an artiﬁ-s
cial high price upon colonial land, in order
to prevent the too quick conversion of the
Wages laborerinto the independent peasant.

But let us now eometo old civilized
countries, in which capital domineerspover
the whole process of production. Take, for
example, therise in England of agricul-
tural wages from 1849 to 1859.’ What

was its consequence? The farmers could.
not, as our friend Weston would have ad-
vised them, raise the value of wheat, nor
even its market prices. They had, on the

contrary, to submit to their fall. But dur-_

ing theseeleven years they introduced ma-
chinery of all sorts, adopted more scientiﬁc
methods, converted part of arable land into
pasture, ‘increased the sizeof farms, and
with this the scale of production, and by
these and other processes diminishing the
demand for labor by increasing its produc-
tive power, made the agricultural population
again relatively redundant. This is the

general method in which a reaction, quicker

or slower, of. capital against arise of wages
takes place, in old, settled countries. Ri-
cardo has justly remarked that machinery is
in constant competition with labor, and can
often be only introduced when the price of
labor has reached a éertain height, but the
appliance of machinery is but one of the
many methods for increasing the produc-
tive powers of labor, This very same de-

velopment which makes common rela-
tively redundant simpliﬁes, on the other ‘

‘hand, skilled labor, and thus depreciates

it.

The same law obtains in another form.
With the development of the productive
powers of labor the accumulation of capital

will be accelerated. even despite a relatively

high rate of wages. Hence, one might in-

fer, as Adam Smith, in whose days modern -

industry was still in its infancy, did infer,
that the accelerated accumulation of capital

must turn the balance in favor of the work- L

ing man, by securing a growing demand for
his labor. From this .same standpoint

' many contemporary writers have wondered

that English capital having grown in the
last twenty years so much quicker than Eng-
lish population, wages should not have been
more enhanced. But simultaneouly with the
progress of accumulation there takes place a
progressive change in the composition, of
capital. That part of the aggregate capital
which consists of ﬁxed capital, machinery,

raw materials, means of production in all-

possible forms, progressively increases’ as
compared with the other part of capital,
which is laid out in wages or in the purchase

      
 

  

 

I24 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

of labor. Thislaw has been stated in a

moreor less accurate manner by Mr. Bar-
ton, Ricardo, Sismondi, Professor Richard
Jones, Professor Ramsey, Cherbulliez, and
others. '

If the proportion of these two elementsof
capita_l was originally one to one, it will, in
the progress of industry, become ﬁve to one,
and so forth. If’ of a total capital of 600,
300 is laid out in instruments, raw materials,
and so forth, and 300 in wages, the total

capital wants only to be doubled to create

 

a demand for 6oo working men instead of
-for 300. But if of a capital of 600, 500 is
laid out in machinery, materials, and so
forth, and I00 only in wages, the same capi-
tal must increase from 600 to 36oo in order
to create‘ a demand for 600 workmen instead
of 300. In the progress of industry the de-
mand for labor keeps, therefore, no pace
with the accumulation of capital. It will
still increase, but increase in a constantly
diminishing ratio‘ as compared with the in-
crease of capital,»

These few hints will sufﬁce to show‘ that
the very development of modern industry

 

 

 

 

  

THE STRUGGLE I25

must progressively turn the scale in favor
of the capitalist against the working man,
and that consequently the general tendency
of capitalistic production is not to raise, but
to sink the average standard of wages, or to
push the value -of labor more or less to its
minimum limit. Such being the tendency
of things in this system, is this saying that
the working class ought to renounce their
‘resistance against the encroachments of
capital, and abandon their attempts at mak-

ing the best of the occasional chances for

their temporary improvement? If they did,
they would be degraded to one level mass
of broken wretches past salvation.‘ I think
I have shown that their struggles for the
standard of wages are incidents inseparable
from the whole wages system, that in 99
cases out of I00 their efforts at raising
wages are only efforts at maintaining the
given value of labor, and that the necessity
of debating their price with the capitalist is
inherent to their condition of having to sell

themselves as commodities. By cowardly ‘

giving way in their every—clay conflict with
capital, they would certainly disclualifv

‘themselves for the initiating "of any larger

movement. A

At the same time, and quite apart from
the general servitude involved in the wages
system, the working class ought not to ex-
aggerate to themselves the ultimate work-
ing of these every-day struggles. They
ought not to forget that they are ﬁghting
with effects, but not with the causes of those
effects; that they are retarding the down-
ward movement, but not changing its direc-
tion; that they are applying palliatives, not
curing the malady. They ought, therefore,
not to be exclusively absorbed in these una-
voidable guerilla ﬁghts incessantly springing

« up from the ever-ceasing encroachments of

capital or changes of the market. They
ought to understand that, with all the mis-
eries itimposes upon them, the ‘present sys-
tem simultaneously engenders thermaterial
conditions and ,the social forms necessary
for an economical reconstruction ' of so-
ciety. Instead of" the cr0nserz'ative' motto,

’ After this very long and, Ilfear, tedious
exposition which I was obliged to enter into
to do some justice to the subject-matter, I

shall conclude by proposing the following
_ resolutions :— - V

Firstly. A general rise in the rate ‘of
wages would result in a fall of the general
rate of proﬁt, but, broadly speaking; not af-
fect the prices of commodities.

Secondly. The general tendency of capi-
talist production is not to raise, but to sink
the average standard of wages.

Thirdly. Trades Unions work well as
centers of resistance against the encroach-
ments of capital. They fail partially from
an injudicious use of their power. They
fail generally from limiting themselves to a
guerilla war against the effects of the exist-
ing system, instead of simultaneously trying
to change it, instead of using their organ-

crease to six and proﬁts decrease to two,
and still the total amount remain eight.
Thus the ﬁxed amount of production would
by no means prove the ﬁxed amount of
wages. How then does our friend Weston
prove this ﬁxity? By asserting it.

But even conceding‘ him his assertion, it
would cut both ways, while he presses it
only in one direction. If the amount of
wages is a constant magnitude, thenﬂit can 
be neither increased nor diminished.

the working men act foolishly, the’?-_'c;apita{l{<
ists, in enforcing a temporary fall of ‘wages,  p p ,
would act not less foolishly. Our friend 
Weston does not deny that, under certain
circumstances, the working men can enforce
a rise of Wages, but their amount being nat-
urally ﬁxed, there must follow a reaction.

On the other hand, he knows also that the
capitalists can enforce a fall of wages, and,
indeed, continuously try to enforce it. Ac-

cording to the principle of the constancy of
wages, a reaction ought to follow in this
case not less than in the former. The
working men, therefore, reacting against
the attempt at, or the act of, lowering
wages, would act rightly. They would,
therefore, act rightly in enforcing a rise -of
wages, because every reaction against the
lowering of wages is an action for raising
wages. According to citizen Weston’s own
principle of the constancy of wages, the

. working men ought, therefore, under certain

circumstances, to combine and struggle for
a rise of wages.

If he denies this conclusion, he must give
up the premise from which it ﬂows. He
must not say that the amount of wages is a
constant quantity, but that, although it can-
not and must not rise, it can and must fall,

whenever capital pleases to lower it. If the V

capitalist pleases to feed you upon potatoes
instead of upon meat; and upon oats instead
of upon wheat, you must accept his will as
a law of political economy, and submit to it.
If in one country the rate of wages is higher

example, than in England, you must ex-
plain this difference in_ the rate of wages
by, difference between the will of the Ameri-
can capitalist and the will of the English
capitalist, a method which would certainly
very much simplify, not only the study of
economic‘ phenomena, but of all other phe-
nomena.

But even then, we might ask, why the will
of the American capitalist differs from the
will of the English capitalist? And to an-
swer the question you must go beyond the
domain of will. A person may tell me that
God wills one thing in France, and another
thing in England. If I summon him to

explain this duality of will, he might have
A the brass to answer me that God wills to

have one will in France and another will in
England. But our friend Weston is cer-
tainly the last man to make an argument of
such a complete negation of all reasoning.

The will. of the capitalist is certainly to

take as much as possible. What we have to
do is not to talk about his will, but to en-

‘quire into his power, the limits of that

-power, and the character of those limits.

 

 

rII

PRODUCTION, WAGES, PROFITS

The address Citizen Weston read to us
might have been compressed into a nutshell.

All his reasoning amounted to this:'If
the working class forces the capitalist class
to pay ﬁve shillings instead of four shillings
in the shape of money wages, the capitalist
will return in the shape of commodities
four shillings’ worth instead of ﬁve shillings’
worth. The working class would have to
pay ﬁve shillings for what, before the riseof
wages, they bought with four shillings.

_But why is this the case? Why does the

capitalist only return four shillings’ worth

"for ﬁve shillings? Because the amount of

wages is ﬁxed. But why is it ﬁxed at four
shillings’ worth of commodities»? Why not
at three, or two, or any other sum? If the
limit of the amount of wages is settled by
an economic law, independent alike of the
* I4

 

PRODUCTION, WAGES, PROFITS I 5

will of the capitalist and the will of the

_ workingman, the first thing Citizen Weston

had to do was to state that law and prove it.
He ought then, moreover, to have proved

that the amount of wages actually paid at _

every given moment always corresponds ex-

actly to the necessary amount of wages, and

never deviates from it. If, on the other

hand, the given limit of the amount of

Wages is founded on the mere will of the
capitalist, or the limits of his avarice, it is
an arbitrary limit. There is nothing neces-
sary in it. It may be changed by the will of

I the capitalist, and may, therefore, be‘

changed against his will.

Citiien Weston illustrated his theory by
telling you that when a bowl contains a cer-
tain quantity of soup, to be eaten by a cer-
tain number of persons, an increase in the
broadness of the spoons would not produce
an increase in the amount of soup. He

must allow me topﬁnd this illustration rather .

spoony. , It reminded me somewhat of-the
simile employed by Menenius Agrippa.
When the Roman plebeians struck against
the Roman patricians, the patrician Agrippa

 

,-._-»,..'‘_.Z...... ‘' - ‘.._.. " ; . _ ;,,_",“‘~'*'~'--e~~.w 2 <~:4

e 16 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT‘

told them that the patrician belly fed the
plebeian members of the body politic.
Agrippa failed to show that you feed the
members of one man by ﬁlling the belly of 
another. Citizen Weston, on his part, has i
forgotten that the bowl from which the
workmen eat is ﬁlled with the whole produce

of the national labor, and that what prevents

them fetching more out of it is neither the
narrowness of the bowl nor the scantiness

of its contents, but only the smallness of

their spoons.

By what contrivance is the capitalist en-
abled to return four shillings’ worth for ﬁve
shillings? By raising the price of the com-
modity he sells. Now, does a rise and
more generally a change in the prices of
commodities, do the prices of commodities
themselves, depend on the mere will of the
capitalist? Or are, on the contrary, certain
circumstances wanted to give effect to that
a will? If not, the ups and downs, the in«
cessant' ﬂuctuations of market prices, be-
come an insoluble riddle.

As we suppose that no change whatever
has taken place either in the productive

 

PRODUCTION. VVAGES, PROFITS 

powers of labor, or in the amount of capi-
tal and labor employed, or in the value of
the money wherein the values of products
are estimated, but only a change in the rate

of wages, how could that rise of wages af- i ’

feet the prices of commodities? Only by
affecting the actual proportion between the
demand for, and the supply of, these com-
modities.

It is perfectly true that, considered as a
whole, the working class spends, and must
spend, its income upon necessaries. A gen-
eral rise in the rate of wages would, there-
fore, produce a rise in the demand for, and
consequently in the market prices of, neces-
saries.‘ The capitalists who produce these
necessaries would be compensated for the
risen wages by the rising market prices of
their commodities. But how with the other
capitalists who do not produce necessaries?
And you must not fancy them a small body.
If you consider that two-thirds of the na-
tional produce are consumed by one-ﬁfth
of the population —— a member of the House
of Commons stated it recentlyvto. be but one»
seventh of the population——— you will under-

stand what an immense proportion of the
national produce must be produced in the
shape of luxuries, or be exchanged for lux-
uries, and what an immense amount of the
necessaries themselves must be wastedupon
ﬁunkeys, horses,‘ cats, and so forth, a waste
we know from experience to become always
much limited with the rising prices of neces-
saries.

VVel1, what would be the position of those
capitalists who do not produce necessaries?
For the fall in the rate of profit, consequent
upon the general rise of wages, they could
not compensate themselves by a rise in the
price of their c0mmodities,'because the de-
mand for those commodities would not have
increased. Their income would have de-
creased, and from this decreased income
they would have to.pay more for the same
amount of higher4priced necessaries. But
thiswould not be all. As their income had
diminished they would have less to spend

upon luxuries, and thereforetheir mutual ,

demand for their respective commodities
would diminish. Consequent upon this di—"
minished demand the prices of their com-

modities would fall. In these branches of
industry, therefore, the rate of proﬁt would
fall, not only in simple proportion to the
general rise in the rate of wages, but in the
compound ratio of the general rise of wages,
the rise in the prices of necessaries, and the
fall in the prices of luxuries. ’
What would be the consequence of this
difference in therates of proﬁt for capitals
employed in the different branches of in-
dustry? Why, the consequence that gen-
erally obtains whenever, from whatever rea-
son, the average rate of 'profit comes to
differ in the different spheres of production.
Capital and labor would be transferred from
the less remunerative to the more remunera-
tive branches; and this process of transfer

would go on until the supply in the one de- *

partment of industry would have risen pro-
portionately to the increased demand, and
would have sunk in the other departments

‘ according to the decreased demand. This

change effected, the general rate of proﬁt
would again be equalized in the different
branches. As the whole derangement orig-
inally arose from a mere change in the pro-

gnu.-nu-——.........». ......l.,..,“

portion of the demand for, and supply of,
different commodities, the -cause ceasing,
the effect would cease, and prices would re-
turn to their former level and equilibrium.
Instead of being limited to so/me branches of
industry, the fall in the rate of profit con-
sequent upon the rise of wages would have
becoine general. According to our suppo-
sition, there would have taken place no
change in the productive powers of labor,

nor in the aggregate amount of production,’

but that given amonntiof production would
have changed its form. A greater part of
the produce would exist in the shape of nec-
essaries, a lesser part in the shape of lux-
uries, or what comes to the same, a lesser

part would be exchanged for foreign lux-

uries, and be consumed in its original form,
or, what again comes to the same, a greater
part of the native’ produce would be.ex-
changed for foreign necessaries instead of

‘ for luxuries. The general rise in the rate

of wages would, therefore, after a tempo-
rary disturbance of market prices, only re-
sult in! a general fall of the rate of proﬁt

an =- -~—>~m: -..-..x~.-sv...w.-.-i.--a\,~,.“_ ,.._.,_ _ I

without any permanent change in the prices
of commodities. I

If I am told that in the previous argu-
ment I, assume the whole.surplus wages to
be spent upon necessaries, I answer that I
have made the supposition most advan-
tageous to the opinion of Citizen Weston.

If the surplus wages were spent upon ar- .

ticles formerly not entering into the con-
sumption of the working men, the real in-
crease of their purchasing power would need
no proof. Being, however, only derived
from an advance of wages, that increase of
their purchasing power must exactly cor-
respond to the, decrease of the purchasing
power. of the capitalists. AThe aggregate
demand for commodities would, therefore,
not increase, but the constituent parts of
that demand would change. The increas-
ing demand on the one side would be coun-
terbalanced by the decreasing demand on the
other side. Thus the aggregate demand, re-
maining stationary, no change whatever
could take‘ place in the market prices of
commodities. »

 

22 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT ‘

You arrive, therefore, at this dilemma:
Either the surplus wages are equally spent
upon all articles of consumption — then the
expansion of demand on the part of the
working class must be compensated by the
contraction of demand on the part of the
capitalist class—or the surplus _wages are
only spent upon some articles whose market
prices will temporarily rise. Then the con-
sequent rise in the rate of proﬁt in some,
andthe consequent fall in the rate of proﬁt
in other branches of industry will produce
a change in the distribution of capital and
labor, going on until the supply is brought
up to the increased demand in the one de-
partment of industry, and brought down to
the diminished demand in the other de-
partments of industry. O On the one suppo-
sition there will occur no change in the
prices of commodities. On the other sup‘-
position, after some ﬂuctuations of market
prices, the exchangeable values of commodi-
ties will subside to the former level. On
both suppositions the general rise in the ‘rate
of wages will ultimately result in nothing
else but a general fall in the rate of proﬁt.

 

 

PRODUCTION, WAGES, PROFITS 23

To stir up your powers of imagination
Citizen VVeston requested you to think of
the difficulties which a general rise of Eng-
lish agricultural wages from nine shillings
to eighteen shillings would produce. Think,
he exclaimed, of the immense rise in the de-
mand for necessaries, and the consequent
fearful rise in their prices! Now, all of you
know that the average wages of the Ameri-
can agricultural laborer amount to more than

double that of the English agricultural la-

borer, ‘although the prices of agricultural
produce are lower in the United States than
in the United Kingdom, although the gen-
eral relations of capital and labor obtain in
the United States the same as in England,
andalthough the annual amount of produc-
tion is much smaller in the United States
than in England. VVhy, then, does our
friend ring this alarum bell? Simply to shift

the real question before us. A sudden rise .
of wages from nine shillings to eighteen ‘

shillings would be a sudden rise to t-he
amount of I00 per cent. Now, we are not
at all discussing the question -whether the
general rate of wages in England could be

 

24 VAILUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

suddenly increased by 100 per cent. We
have nothing at all to do with the magnitude
of the rise, which in every practical instance
must depend on, and be suited to, given
circumstances» We have only, to inquire
how a general rise in the rate of wages, even
if restricted to one per cent., will act.
Dismissing friend Weston’s fancy rise of
100 per cent.,' I propose calling your atten-
tion to the real rise of wages that took place
in Great Britain from 1849 to 1859. '
You are all aware of the Ten Hours‘ Bill,
or rather Ten-and-a-half Hours Bill, intro-
duced since I848. This was one of the
greatest economic changes we_ have wit-
nessed. It was a sudden and compulsory
rise of wages, not in some local trades, but
in the leading industrial branches by which
England sways the markets of the‘world.

, It was a rise of wages under circumstances

singularly unpropitious. Dr. Ure, Profes-
sor Senior, and all the other official eco-
nomical mouthpieces of the middle class,
proved, and I must say upon much stronger
grounds than those of our friend Weston,

that it would sound the death-knell of Eng-

/-

.y~.w,.—..V-¢»....,...._..-,~...,~se-ua»««:s—-x—..,.E..,_,_, ,.

lish industry. They proved that it not only

amounted to a simple rise of wages, but to

a rise of wages initiated by, and based upon,
a diminution of the quantity, of labor em-

"ployed.» They asserted that the twelfth

hour you wanted to take from the capitalist
was exactly the only hour from which he
derived his proﬁt. They threatened a de-
crease of accumulation, rise of prices, loss

of markets, stinting of production,’ conse-'

quent reaction upon wages, ultimate ruin.

In fact, they declared Maximilian Robes- '

pierre’s Maximum Laws to be a small affair
compared to it; and they were right in a cer-
tain sense. Well, what was the result? A
rise in" the money wages of the factory
operatives, despite the curtailing of the
working day,, a great increase in the number
of factory hands employed, a continuous
fall in thehprices of their products, a marvel-

,ous development in the productive powers

of their labor, an unheard-of progressive ex-
pansion of the markets for their commodi-
ties. In Manchester, at the meeting, in

' 1860, of the Society for the Advancement of

Science, I myself heard Mr. Newman con-

26 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

I fess that he, Dr. Ure, Senior, and all other

ofﬁcial propounders of economic science
had been wrong, while the instinct of the
people had been right. I mention Mr. W.
Newman, not Professor Francis Newman,
because he occupies an eminent position in
economic science, as the contributor to,
and editor of, Mr. Thomas Tooke’s History
of Prices, that magniﬁcent work‘ which
traces the history of prices from 1793 to
1856. .If our friend Weston’s ﬁxed idea of
a ﬁxed amount of wages, a ﬁxed amount of
production, a ﬁxed degree of the productive
power of labor, a ﬁxed and permanent will
ofithe capitalists, and all his other ﬁxedness
and ﬁnality were correct, Professor Senior’s
woeful forebodings would have been right,
and Robert Owen, who already in 1816 pro-
claimed a general limitation of the working
day the ﬁrst preparatory step to the eman-
cipation of the working class, and actually
in the teeth of the‘ general prejudice inaugu-
rated it on his own hook in his cotton fac-
tory at New Lanark, would have been
wrong. '

In the very same period during which the

introduction of the Ten Hours Bill, and the
rise of wages consequent upon it, occurred,
there took place in Great Britain, for rea-
sons which it would be out of place to
enumerate here, a general rise in agricul-
tural wages. , ‘

Although it is not required for my imme-
diate purpose, in order not to mislead you, I
shall make some preliminary remarks.

If a man got two shillings weekly wages,
and if his wages rose to four shillings, the

rate of wages would have risen by 100 per .

cent.‘ This would seem a very magniﬁcent
thing if expressed as a rise in the rate of
wages, although the actual amount of wages,
four shillings weekly, would still remain a
wretchedly small,\ a starvation‘ pittance.
You must not, therefore, allow yourselves
to be carried away by the high-sounding
per cents. in the rate of wages. You must
always ask. What was the original amount?

Moreover, you will understand, that if
there were ten men receiving each 2s. per
week, ﬁve men receiving each 53., and ﬁve
men receiving IIs. weekly, the twenty men
together would receive Ioos., or £5. weekly.

If then a rise, say by 20 per cent., upon the
aggregate sum of their weekly wages took
place. there would be an advance from £5 to
£6. Taking the average, we might say that
the general rate of wages had risen by 20
per cent., although, in fact, the wages of the
ten men had remained stationary, the wages
of the one lot of ﬁve men had risen from 53.
to 63. only, and the wages of the other lot
of five men from 5 53. to 703. One half of
the men would not have improved at all
their ‘position, one quarter would have im-
proved it in an imperceptible degree, and
only one quarter would have bettered it
really. Still, reckoning by the average, the

 

total amount of the wages of those twenty-
men would have increased by 20 per cent., -

and as far as the aggregate capital that em-
ploys them, and the prices of the commodi-
ties they produce, are concerned, it would be
exactly the same as if all of them had
equally shared in the average rise of wages.
In the case of agricultural labor, the stand-
ard wages being very different in the differ-
ent counties of England and Scotland, the
rise affected them very unequally.

Lastly, during the period when that rise

of wages took place counteracting inﬂuences -

were at work, such as the new taxes conse-

demolition of the dwelling-houses of the ag-
ricultural- laborers. and so forth.

Having premised so much, I proceed to
state that from 18219 to 1859 there took
place a rise of about 40 per cent. in the
average rate of the agricultural wages of
Great Britain. I could give you ample de-
tails in proof of my assertion. but for the
present purpose think it sufficient to refer
you to the conscientious and critical paper
read in 1860 by the late Mr. John C. Mor-
ton at the London Society of Arts on “ The
Forces used in Aggiculture.” Mr. Morton
gives the returns, from bills and other au-
thentic documents.‘ which he had collected
from about one hundred farmers,- residing
in twelve Scotch and thirty-ﬁve English
counties.

According to our friend Weston’s opin-
ion", and taken together with the simultane-
ous rise in the wages of the factory opera-
tives, there ought to have occurred a tre-

30 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

mendous rise in the prices of agricultural
produce during the period 1849 to 1859.
But what,is the fact? Despite the Russian
war, and the consecutive unfavorable har-
vests from 1854 to 1856, the average price
of wheat, which is the leading agricultural
produce of England, fell from about £3 per
quarter for the years 1838 to 1848 to about
£2 10.9. per quarter for the years 1849 to
1859. This constitutes a fall in the price of
wheat of more than 16 per cent. simultanee
ously with an average rise of agricultural
wages of 40 per cent. During the same
period, if we compare its end with its be-
ginning, 1859 with 1849, there was a de-
crease of official pauperism from 934,419
to 860,470, the difference being 73,g49;‘a
very small decrease, I grant, and which in
the following years was again lost, but still
a decrease.

It might be said that, consequent upon the
abolition of the Corn Laws, the import of
foreign corn was more than doubled during
the period from 1849 to 1859, as compared
with the period from 1838 to 1848. And
what of that? From Citizen Weston’s

PRODUCTION, WAGES, PROFITS 31

standpoint one would have expected that
this sudden, immense, and continuously in-
creasing demand upon foreign markets must
have sent up the prices of agricultural prod-
uce there to a frightful height, the effect of
increased-1 demand remaining the same.
whether? it comes from without or from
within. What was the fact? Apart from
some years of failing harvests, during all

. that period the ruinous fall in the price of V
 formed a standing theme of declama-

tion in France; the Americans were again
and again compelled to burn their surplus of
produce; and Russia, if we are to believe
Mr. Urquhart, prompted the Civil War
in the United States because her agricul-
tural exports were\crippled by the Yankee
competition in the markets of Europe.
Reduced to its abstract form, Citizen
Weston’s argument would come‘ to this:
Every rise in demand occurs always on the
,basis of a given amount of production. It
can, therefore, ne'ver‘increase the supply of
the articles demanded, but can only enhance
their money prices. Now the most com-
mon observation shows that an increased de-

32 V VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

mand will, in someinstances, leave the mar-
ket prices of commodities altogether un-
changed, and will, in other instances, cause
a temporary rise of market prices followed
by an increased supply, followed by a reduc-
tion of the prices to their original level, and
in’ many cases below their original level.
Whether the rise of demand springs from
surplus wages, or from any other cause,
does not at all change the conditions of the
problem. From i Citizen Weston’s stand-
point the general phenomenon was as clifﬁ¥
cult to explain as ‘the phenomenon occurring
under the exceptional circumstances of a
rise of wages. His argument had, there-
fore, no peculiar bearing whatever upon the
subject we treat. It only expressed his per.-

pplexity at accounting for the laws lay which

an increase of demand produces an increase
of supply, instead of an ultimate rise of
market prices.

WAGES AND CURRENCY

\

On the second day of the debate our
friend Weston clothed his old assertions in
new forms. He said: Consequent upon a
general rise in money wages, more currency
will ‘he wanted to pay the same wages. The
currency being ﬁxed, how can you pay with
this ﬁxed currency increased money wages?

First the difficulty arose from the ﬁxed »

amount of commodities accruing to the
working man despite his increase of money
wages; now it arises from the increased
money wages, despite\ the ﬁxed amount of
commodities. Of course, if you reject his
original dogma, his secondary grievance will
disappear. ~

However, I shall show that this currency
question has nothing at all to do with the
subject before us. I r

In your country the mechanism of pay-

‘33

 

34 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

ments is much more perfected than in any f

other country of Europe. Thanks to the

extent and concentration of the banking sys- ii

tern, much less currency is wanted to circu-

late the same amount of values, and to 

transact the same or a greater amount of
business. For example, as far as wages are
concerned, the English factory operative
pays his wages weekly to the shopkeeper,
who sends them weekly to the banker, who

‘ returns them weekly. to the manufacturer,
‘who again pays them away to his working‘

men, and so forth. By this contrivance the
yearly wages of an operative, say of £52,
may be paid by one single sovereign turning
round every week in the same circle. Even
in England the mechanism is lessperfect

than in Scotland, and is not everywhere ’

equally perfect; and therefore we ﬁnd, for
example, that in some agricultural districts,
as compared with the mere factory districts,
much more currency is wanted to circulate
a much, smaller amount of values.

If you cross the Channel you will ﬁnd
that the money wages are much lowerithan
in England, but that they are circulated in

1

 

WAGES AND CURRENCY 

Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France
by a much larger amount of currency. The
same sovereign will not be so quickly inter-
cepted by the banker or returned to the in-
dustrial capitalist; and, therefore, instead of
one sovereign circulating £52 yearly, you
want, perhaps, three sovereigns to circulate
yearly wages to the amount of £25. Thus,
by comparing continental countries with
England, you will see at once that low money
wages may require a much larger currency
for their circulation than high money wages,
and that this is, in fact, a merely technical
point, quite foreign to our subject.
According to the best calculations I know,
the yearly income of the working class of
this country may be estimated at £250,000,-
ooo.» This immense sum is circulated by
about three million pounds. Suppose a rise
of wages of ﬁfty per cent. to take place.

Then, instead of three millions of currency, »

four and a half millions would be wanted.

As a very considerable part of the working- .

man’s daily expenses is laid out in silver and
copper, that is to say, in mere tokens, whose
relative value _to gold is arbitrarily ﬁxed by

law, like that of inconvertible money paper,
a rise of money wages by ﬁfty per cent.
would, in the extreme case, require an addi¥
tional circulation of sovereigns, say,to the
amount of one million. One million, now
i r ‘ 3 V; dormant, in the shape of bullion or coin, in
; hi the cellars of the Bank of England, or of
i  private bankers, would circulate. But even
: the triﬂing expense resulting from the addi-
 1 tional minting or the additional, wear and
 2, ) tear of that million might be spared, and
, would actually be spared, if any friction
§ 3 should arise from the want of the addi-
i » tional currency. All of you know that the
‘ E currency of this country is divided into two
E \ great departments. One sort, supplied by
bank-notes of different descriptions, is used
in the transactions between dealers and
dealers, and the larger payments from con-
sumers to dealers, while another sort of cur-
lq rency, metallic coin, circulates in the retail
r trade. Although distinct, these two sorts
i of currency interwork with each other.
i ; » Thus gold coin, to a very great extent, cir-
‘ ‘ culates even in larger payments for all the p
‘ odd sums under £5. If to-morrow £4 notes,

or :E ,' notes, or £2 notes were issued. the
gold ﬁlling these channels of circulation
would at once be driven out of them, and
ﬂow into those channels where they would be
needed from the increase of money wages.
Thus the additional million‘ required by an
advance of wages by ﬁfty per cent. would
be supplied without the addition of one sin-
gle sovereign. The» same effect might be
produced, without one additional bank-note,
by an additional bill circulation, as was the
casein Lancashire for a very considerable
time’.

If a general rise in the rate of wages, for
example, of Ioo per cent., as Citizen Wes-
ton supposed ‘it to take place in agricultural
wages, would produce a great rise in the
prices of necessaries, and, according to his
views, require an additional amount of cur-
rency not to be procured. a general -fall in
wages must produce the same effect, on the
same scale, in an opposite direction. Well!
All of you know that the years 1858 to 1860
were the most prosperous years for the cot-
ton industry, and that peculiarly the year
1860 stands in that respect unrivaled in the

annals of commerce, while at the same time
all other branches of industry were most
ﬂourishing. The wages of the cotton op-
eratives and of all the other working men
connected with their trade stood, in 1860,
higher than ever before. The American
crisis came, and those aggregate wages
were suddenly reduced to about one-fourth
of their former amount. This would have
been in the opposite direction a rise of 400
per cent. If wages rise from ﬁve to twenty,
we say that they rise by 300 per cent.; if
they fall from twenty to ﬁve, we say that
they fall by seventy-ﬁve per cent.; but‘ the
amount of rise in the one and the amount
of fall in the other case would be the same,
namely, ﬁfteen shillings. This, then, was a
sudden change in the rate of wages un-
precedented, and at the same time extending
over a number of operatives which, if we
count all the operatives not only directly
engaged in but indirectly dependent upon the
cotton trade, was larger by one—half than
the number of agricultural laborers; Did

ing the three years of 1858-1860 to the an-
nual average of 5 5:. 10d. per quarter during
the three years 1861-1863. As to the cur-
rency, there were coined in the mint in 1861
£8,673,232, against £3,378,792 in 1860.
That is to say, there were coined £5,294,440
more in 1861 than in 1860. It is true the
bank-note circulation was in 1861 less by
£1,319,000 than in 1860. Take this off.
There remains still an overplus of currency
for the year 1861, as compared with the
prosperity year, 1860, to the amount of
£3,975,440, or about £4,ooo,ooo; but the
bullion reserve in the Bank of England had
simultaneously decreased, not quite to the
same, but in an approximating proportion.

Compare the year I86\2 with 1842. Apart '

from the immense increase in the value and
amount of commodities circulated, in 1862
the capital paid in regular transactions for
shares, loans, etc., for the railways in Eng-
land and ‘Wales amounted alone to £320,-
00o,000, a sum that would have appeared
fabulous in 1842. Still, the aggregate
amounts in currency in 1862 and 1842 were
pretty nearly equal, and generally you will

ﬁnd a tendency to a progressive diminution
of currency in the face of an enormously
increasing value, not only of commodities,
but of monetary transactions generally.
From our friend VVeston’s standpoint this
is an unsolvable riddle. -
Looking somewhat deeper into this mat-9
ter, he would have found that, quite apart
from wages, and supposing them to be ﬁxed,
the value and _mass of the commodities to
be circulated, and generally the amount of
monetary transactions to be settled, vary
daily; that the amount of bank-notes issued
varies daily; that the amount of payments
realized without the intervention of .any
money, by the instrumentality of bills,
checks, book-credits, clearing houses, varies

~ daily; that, as far as actual metallic cur-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

rency is required, the proportion between
the coin in circulation and.the coin and bul-
lion in reserve or sleeping in the cellars of
banks varies daily; that the amount of bul-
lion absorbed by the national circulation and
the amount being sent abroad for inter-
national circulation vary daily. He would
have found that this dogma of a ﬁxed cur-

rency is a monstrous error, incompatible
with our every-day movement. He would
have inquired into the laws which enable a
currency to adapt itself to circumstances so
continually changing, instead of turning his

misconception of the laws of currency into.

an argument against a rise of wages.

‘ SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Our friend Weston accepts the.Latin prov- '

erb that “repetitio est mater studiorum,”
that is to say, that repetition is the mother

‘of study, and consequently he repeated his
original dogma again under the new form,

that the contraction of currency, resulting
froman enhancement of wages, would/pro-
duce a diminution of capital, and so forth.
Having already dealt with his currency
crotchet, I consider it quite useless to /enter
upon the imaginary consequences he fancies
to ﬂow from his imaginary currency mis-
hap. I shall proceed to at oncereduce his
one and the same dogma, repeated‘ in so
many different shapes, to its simplest the-
oretical form.

The uncritical way in which he has
treated his subject will become evident from

42

1

a}‘_ ;,m~m:».«

SUPPLY AND DEMAND 

one single remark. He pleads against a
rise of wages or against high wages as the
result of such a rise. Now, I ask him,
What are high wages and what are low
wages? Why constitute, for example, ﬁve
shillings weekly low, and twenty shillings
weekly high wages? If ﬁve is low as com-
pared with twenty, twenty is still lower as
compared with two hundred. If a man was
to lecture on the thermometer, .and com-
menced by declaiming on high and low de-
grees, he would impart no knowledge what-

ever. He must ﬁrst tell me how the freez-
, ing-point is found out, and how the boiling-

point, and how these standard points are
settled by natural laws, not by the fancy-of
the sellers or makers of thermometers.
Now, in regard to wages and proﬁts, Citi-
zen Weston has not only failed to deduce

such standard ‘points from economical laws,

but he has not even felt the necessity to look
after them. He satisﬁed himself with the
acceptance of the popular slang terms of low
and high as something having a ﬁxed mean-
ing, although it is self-evident that wages
can only be said to be high or low as com-

44 VALUE, PRICE A1".,D PROFIT

pared with a standard by which to measure

their magnitudes.

He will be unable to tell me why a cer- A

tain amount of money is given for a certain
amount of labor. If he should answer me,
“ This was settled by the law of supply and

' demand,” I should ask him, in the ﬁrst in-

stance, by what la.w supply and. demand are
themselves‘ regulated. And such an an?
swer ‘would at once put him out of court.
The relations between the supply and de-
mand of labor undergo perpetual change,
and with them the market prices of labor.
If the demand ‘overshoots the supply wages
rise; if the supply overshoots the demand
wages sink, although it might in such cir-
cumstances be necessary to test the. real
state of demand and supply by a strike, for
example, or any other method. ,But if you
accept supply and demand as the law reg-
ulating wages, it would be as childish as
useless to declaim against a rise of wages,
because, according to the supreme law you
appeal to, a periodical rise of wages is quite
as necessary and legitimate as a periodical
fall of wages. If you do not accept supply

 

SUPPLY AND DEMAND~ 

/and demand as the law regulating wages, I

again repeat the question, why a certain
amount of money is given for a certain
amount of labor?

But to consider matters more broadly:
You would be altogether mistaken in fancy-
ing that the value of labor or any other com-
modity whatever is ultimatelyirﬁxed by sup-
ply and demand. Supply and demand reg-
ulate nothing but the-temporary ﬂuctuations

of market prices. They will explain to you —
~ why the market price of a commodity rises

above or sinks below its ‘value, but they can
never account for that value itself. Sup-
pose supply and demand to equilibrate, or,
as the economists call it, to cover each other.
Why, the very moment these opposite forces
become equal they paralyze each other, and
cease to work in the one or the other direc-

tion. At the moment when supply and de- '

mand equilibrate each other, and therefore
cease to act, the market price of a commod-
ity ‘coincides with its real value, with the
standard price round which its market
prices oscillate. In inquiring into the na-
ture of that value, we have therefore noth-

WAGES AND PRICES

Reduced to their simplest theoretical ex- .

pression, all.our friend’s arguments resolve
themselves into this one single dogma:
“ The" prices of commodities are determined

I might appeal to \practical observation
to bear witness against this antiquated and
exploded fallacy. I might tell you that the
English factory operatives, miners,’ ship-
builders, and so‘ forth, whose labor is rela-
tively high-priced, undersell by the cheap-
ness of their produce all other nations; while
the English agricultural laborer, for exam-
ple, whose labor is relatively low-priced, is
undersold by almost every other nation be-
cause of the dearness of his produce. By
comparing article with article in the same
country, and the commodities of different
countries, I might show, apartfrom some

PREFACE

THE circumstances under which this paper
was read are narrated at the beginning of
the work. ‘The paper was never published
during the lifetime of Marx. It was found
amongst his papers after the death of En-
gels.‘ ’

Among many other characteristics of
Marx, this paper shows two especially.
These are his patient willingness to make
the meaning of his ideas plain’ to the hum-
blest student, and the extraordinary clear-
ness of those ideas.

In a partial sense the present volume is an
epitome of the ﬁrst volume of Capital.
More than one of us have attempted to ana-
lyze and simplify that volume, with not too

pmuch success perhaps. In fact, a witty

friend and commentator has suggested that
what is now required is an explanation by
Marx of our explanations of him.

exceptions more apparent than real, that on
an average the high-priced labor produces
the 1ow—priced, and the low-priced labor pro-
duces the high-priced commodities. This,
of course, would not prove that the high
price of labor in the one, and its low price
in the other instance_, are the respective
causes of those diametrically opposed effects,
but at all events it would prove that the
prices of commodities are not ruled by the
prices of labor. However, it is quite super-
ﬂuous for us to employ this empirical
method. . '

It might, perhaps,,be denied that Citizen
Weston has put forward the dogma: “ The
prices of commodities are determined or
regulated by wages.” In point of fact, he
has never formulated it. He.said, on the
contrary, that proﬁt and rent form also

constituent parts of the prices of commod— i

ities, because it is out of the prices of com-
modities that not only the working man's
wages, but also the capitalist’s proﬁts and
the landlord’s rents must be paid. But how
in his idea are prices formed? First by
wages. Then an additional percentage is

V -,.-»>=esu'u:=-

 

WAGES AND PRICES 

joined to the price on behalf of the capital-
ist, and another additional percentage on
behalf of the landlord. Suppose the wages
of the labor employed in the production of
a commodity to be ten. If the rate of
proﬁt was 100 per e nt., to the wages ad-
vanced the capitalist would add ten, and if
the rate of rent was also 100 per cent. upon
the wages, there would be added ten more,
and the aggregate price of the commod-
ity would amount to thirty. But such a
determination of prices would be simply
their determination by wages. If wages in
the above case rose to twenty, the price of
the commodity would rise to sixty,- and so
forth. Consequently all the superannu-
ated writers on political economy who pro-
pounded the dogma that wages regulate
prices, have tried to prove it by treating
proﬁt and rent as mere additional percent-
ages upon wages. None of them were, of
course, able to reduce the limits of those
percentages to any economic law. They
seem, on the contrary, to thinle proﬁts set-
tled by tradition, custom, the will of the cap-
italist, or by some other equally arbitrary

and inexplicable method. If‘ they assert
that they are settled by the competition be-
tween the capitalists, they say nothing.
That competition is sure to equalize the
different rates of proﬁt in different trades,
or reduce them to one average level, but it
can never determine the level itself, or the
general rate of proﬁt._

Whatdo we mean by saying that the
prices of the commodities are determined
by wages? , Wages being but a name for
the price of labor, we mean that the prices
of commodities are regulated by the price
of labor. As “price” is exchangeable
value—and in speaking of value I speak

‘always of exchangeable va1ue—is ex-

changeable value expressed in money, the
proposition comes to this, that “the value
of commodities is determined by the value
of labor," orthat “ the value of labor is the
general measure of value.”

But how, then, is the “value of labor”
itself determined? Here we come to a
standstill. Of course, to a standstill‘ if we
try reasoning logically. Yet the propound-
ers of that doctrine make short work of

I

-..«. .. .4,‘ ...~

WAGES AND PRICES 51

logical scruples. Take our friend Weston,
for example. First he told us that wages
regulate the price of commodities, and that
consequently when wages rise prices must
rise. Then he turned round to show us that
a rise of wages will be no good because the
prices of commodities had risen, and be-
cause wages were indeed measured by the
prices of the commodities upon which they
are spent. Thus we begin by saying that
the value of labor determines the value of
commodities, and we wind up by saying
that the value of commodities determines
the value of labor. Thus we move to and
fro in the most vicious circle, and arrive at

A no conclusion at all.

On the whole it is evident that by making
the value of one commodity, say labor,
corn, or any other commodity, the general
measure and regulator of value," we only
shift the difficulty, since we determine one
value by another, which on its side wants
to be determined.

The dogma that “wages determine the
price of commodities,” expressed in its

. most abstract terms, comes to this, that

52 VALUE, PRICE, AND PROFIT
“value is determined by value,” and Chi-5
tautology means that. in fact, we ’:','..1ow
nothing at all about value. Accepting this
premise, all reasoning about the general
laws ofpolitical "economy turns into mere
twaddle. 'It was, therefore, the great merit
of Ricardo that in his work on The Princi-

ples of Political Economy, published in

1817, he fundamentally destroyed the old,
popular, and worn-out fallacy that “ wages

' determine prices,” a fallacy which Adam

Smith and his French predecessors had
spurned in the really scientiﬁc parts of their
researches; but which they reproduced in
their more exoterical and vulgarizing chap-
ters.

 

VI

VALUE AND LABOR
\

Citizens, I have now arrived at a point
where I must enter upon the real develop-
ment of the question. I cannot promise to
do this in a very satisfactory way, because
to do so I should be obliged to go over the
whole ﬁeld of political economy. I can, as
the French would say,‘ but “ eﬁleurer la
question,” touch upon the main points.

The ﬁrst question we have to put is:
What is the value of a commodity? How
is it determined? '

_At ﬁrst sight it would seem that the value
of a commodity is a thing quite relative,

and not to be settled without considering.

one commodity in its relations to all other
commodities. In fact, in speaking of the
value. the value in exchange of a com-
modity, we mean the proportional quanti-
ties in which it exchanges with all other

53

54 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

commodities. But then arises the question:
How are the proportions in which com-

Rmodities exchange with each other regu-
lated?

We know from experience that these pro-
portions vary inﬁnitely. Taking one single
commodity, wheat, for instance, we shall
ﬁnd that a quarter of wheat exchanges in
almost countless variations of proportion

with»,different commodities. Yet, its value

remaining always the same, whether ex-
pressed in silk, gold, or any other commod-
ity, it must be something distinct from, and

‘independent of these di/fererzt rates of ex-

change with different articles. _It must be
possible to express, in a very different form,
these various equations with various com-
modities. \ — ' '
Besides, if I say a quarter of wheat ex-
changes with iron in a certain proportion,
or the value of a quarter of wheat is ex-
pressed in a certain amount of iron, I say
that the value of’ wheat and its equivalent
in iron are equal tosome third ‘tlzing, which
is neither wheat nor iron, because I suppose
them to express the same magnitude in two

I

 

VALUE AND LABOR 55

different shapes. Either of them, the wheat

' or the iron, must, therefore, independently

of the other, be reducible to this third thing
which is their common measure.

To elucidate this point I shall recur to a
very simple geometrical illustration. In
comparing the areas of triangles of all pos-
sible forms and magnitudes, or comparing
triangles with rectangles, or any other rec-
tilinear ﬁgure, how do we proceed? We
reduce the area of any triangle whatever to
an expression quite different from its visi-
ble form. Having found from the nature
of the triangle that its area is equal to half
the product of its base by its height, we can
then compare the different values of all sorts
of triangles, and of all rectilinear ﬁgures
whatever, because all of them may be re-
solved into a certain number of triangles.

"The same mode of procedure must obtain
with the values of commodities. We must
be able to reduce all of them to an expres-
sion common to all. and distinguishing them
only by the proportions in which they con-
tain that identical measure.

As the exchangeable values of commodi-

56 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

ties are only social functions of those things,
and have nothing at all to do with the nat-
ural qualities, we must ﬁrst ask, What is
the common social substance of all com-
modit/ies? It is Labor. To produce a com-
modity a certain amount of labor must be
bestowed upon it, or worked up in it. And
I say not only Labor, but Social Labor. A
man who produces an article for his own
immediate use, to consume it himself,
creates a product, but not a commodity.
As a self-sustaining producer he has nothing
to do with society. But to produce a com-
modity, a man must not only produce an
article satisfying some social want, but his
labor itself must form part and parcel of the
total sum of labor expended by society. It
must be subordinate to the Division of Labor

\within Society. It is nothing without the

other divisions of labor, and on its part is
required to integrate them.

If we consider commodities as values, we
consider them exclusively under the single
aspect of realized, fixed, or, if you like,
crystallized social labor. In this respect they
can differ only by representing greater or

 

VALUE AND LABOR 57

smaller quantities of labor, as, for exam-
ple, a greater amount of labor may be
worked up in a silken handkerchief than in
a brick. But how does one measure quan-
tities of labor? By the time the labor lasts,

. in measuring the labor by the hour. the day,

etc. Of course, to apply this measure, all
sorts of labor are reduced to average or
simple labor as their unit.

We arrive, therefore, at this conclusion.
A commodity has\a value, because it is a
crystallization of social labor. a‘ The greatness
of its yalue, or its relative value, depends
upon the greater or less amount of that so-
cial substance contained in it; that is to‘say,
on the relative mass of labor necessary for
its production. The relative values of com-

"modities are, therefore, determined by the

respective quantities or amounts of labor,
worked up, realized, fixed in them. The

"correlative quantities of commodities which

can be produced in the same time of labor
are equal. ' Or the value of one commodity
is to the value of another commodity as the
quantity of labor ﬁxed in the one is to the
quantity of labor ﬁxed in the other.

58 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

I suspect that many of you will ask, Does
then, indeed, there exist, such a vast, or any
diﬁerence whatever, between determining
the values of commodities by wages, and de-
termining them by the relative quantities of
labor necessary for their production? ‘You
must, however, be aware that the reward
for labor, and quantity of labor, are quite
disparate things. Suppose, for example,
equal quantities of labor to be ﬁxed in one
quarter of wheat and one ounce of gold. I
resort to the example because it was used

 

by Benjamin -Franklin in his ﬁrst Essay,

published in 1721, and entitled, A Modest
Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a
Paper Currency, where he, one of the ﬁrst,
hit upon the true nature of value. Well.
We suppose, then, that one quarter of wheat
and one ounce of gold are equal values‘ or
equivalents, because they are crystallizations
of equal amounts of average labor, of so
many days’ or so many weeks’ labor respec-
tively ﬁxed in them. In thus determining
the relative values of gold and corn, do we
refer in any way whatever to the wages of
the agricultural laborer and the miner?

  

VALUE AND LABOR 

Not a bit. VV e leave it quite indeterminate
how their day's or their week’s labor was
paid, or even whether wages labor was em-
ployed at all. If it was, wages may have
been very unequal. The laborer whose la-
bor is realized in the quarter of wheat may
receive two bushels only, and the laborer
employed in mining may receive one-half of
the ounce of gold. Or, supposing their
wages to be equal,\they may deviate in all
possible proportions from the values of the
commodities produced by them. They may
amount to one-half, one-third, one-fourth,
one-ﬁfth, or any other proportional part of
the one quarter of corn or the one ounce of
gold. Their wages can, of course, not ex-
ceed, not be more than the values of the
commodities they produced, but they can be
less in every possible degree. Their wages
will be limited by the values of the products,
but the values of their products will not be
limited by the wages. And above all, the
values, the relative values of corn and gold,
for example, will have been settled without
any regard whatever to the value of the
labor employed, that is to say, to wages.

6o VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

To determine the values of commodities by
the relative quantities of labor fixed in them,
is, therefore, a thing quite different from the

tautological method of determining the val- 

ues of commodities by the value of labor,
or by wages. This point, however, will be
further elucidated in the progress of our
inquiry. '

In calculating the exchangeable value of ‘V

a commodity we must add to the quantity
of labor last employed the quantity of labor
previously worked up in the raw material
of the commodity, and the labor bestowed
on the implements, tools, machinery, and
buildings, with which such labor is assisted.
For example, the value of a certain amount
of cotton—yarn is the crystallization of the
quantity of labor added to the cotton dur-
ing the ‘spinning process, the quantity of
labor previously realized in the cotton it-
self, the quantity of labor realized in the
coal, oil, and other auxiliary substances
used, the quantity of labor ﬁxed in the
steam-engine, , the spindles, the factory
building, and so forth. Instruments of
production properly so—called, such as tools,

 

  

_ VALUE, AND LABOR 61

machinery, buildings, serve again and again
for a longer or shorter period during re-
peated processes of production. If they
were used up at once, like the raw material,
their whole value would at once be trans-

ferred to the commodities they assist in pro-‘

ducing. But as a spindle, for example, is

, but gradually used up, an average calcula-

tion is made, based upon the average time
it lasts, and its average waste or wear and
tear during a certain period, say a day. In

‘ this way we calculate how much of the value

of the spindle is transferred to the yarn
daily spun, and how much. therefore, of the
total amount of labor realized in a pound of
yarn, for example, is due to the quantity of
labor previously realized in the spindle.
For our present purpose it is not necessary
to dwell any longer upon this point.

It might seem that if the value of a com-
modity is determined by the quantity of la-
bor bestowed upon its production, the lazier
a man, or the clumsier a man, the more val-
uable his commodity, because the greater
the time of labor required for ﬁnishing the
commodity. This, however, would be a sad

 

62 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

mistake. You will recollect that I used the
word “Social labor,” and many points are
involved in this qualiﬁcation of “Social.”
In saying that the. value of a commodity is
determined by the,» quantity of labor worked
up or crystallized in it, we mean the quan-
tity of labor necessary for its production in
a given state of society, under certain social
average conditions of production, with a
given social average intensity, and average

skill of the labor employed. When, in Eng— —

land, the power—loom came to compete with

the hand-loom, only one—half the former time ,

of labor was wanted to convert a given
amount of yarn into a yard of cotton or
cloth. The poor hand-loom weaver now
worked seventeen or eighteen hours daily,
instead of the nine or ten hours he had
worked before. Still the product of twenty
hours of his labor represented now only ten
social hours of labor, or ten hours of labor
socially necessary for the conversion of a
certain amount of yarn into textile stuffs.
His product of twenty hours had, therefore,
no more value than his former product of
ten hours.

VALUE AND LABOR 63

If then the quantity of socially necessary
labor realized in commodities regulates
their exchangeable values, every increase in
the quantity of labor wanted for the produc-
tion of a commodity must augment its value,
as every diminution must lower it.

If the respective quantities of labor.neces-
sary for the production of the respective
commodities remained constant, their rela-

tive values also w\ould be constant. But

such is not the case. The quantity of labor
necessary for the production of a commod-
ity'changes continuously with the changes

in theproductive powers of the labor em—_

ployed. The greater the productive powers
of labor, the more produce is ﬁnished in a
given time of labor; and the smaller the pro-
ductive powers of labor, the less produce is
ﬁnished in the same time. If, for example,
in the progress of population it should be-
come necessary to cultivate less fertile soils,
the same amount of produce would be only
attainable by a greater. amount of labor
spent. and the value of agricultural produce
would consequently rise. On the other
hand, if with the modern means of produc-

 

 

 

64 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

tion, a single spinner converts into yarn,
during one working day, many thousand
times the amount of cotton which he could
have spun during the same time with the
spinning wheel, it is evident that every single
pound of cotton will absorb many thousand
times less of spinning laor than it did be-
fore, and, consequently, the value added by
spinning -to every single pound of cotton will
be a thousand times less than before. The
value of yarn will slink‘ accordingly.

Apart from the different natural energies
and acquired working abilities of different
peoples, the productive powers of labor must
principally depend :—

Firstly. Upon the natural conditions of
labor, such as fertility of soil, mines, and so
forth. ,

Secondly. Upon the progressive im-
provement of the Social Powers of Labor,
such as are derived from production on a
grand scale, concentration of capital and
combination of labor, subdivision of labor,
machinery, improved methods, appliance of
chemical and other natural agencies, short-
ening of time and space by means of com»

 

  

VALUE AND LABOR . 65

munication and transport, and every other
contrivance by which science presses natural
agencies into the service of labor, and by
which the social or co-operative character of
labor is developed. The greater the produc-
tiverpowers of labor, the less labor is be-
stowed upon a givenamount of produce;
hence the smaller the value of the produce.
The smaller the productive powers of labor.
the more labor is bestowed upon the same
amount of produce; hence the greater its
value. As a general law we may, therefore.
set it down that :— ' _ '

The values of commodities are directly as
the times of labor employed in their produc-
tion, and are inversely as the productive
powers of the labor employed. '

Having till now only spoken of Value, I
shall add a few words about Price, which is
a peculiar form assumed by value. _

Price, taken by itself, is nothing but the
monetaryexpression of value. The values
of all commodities of this country, for ex-
ample, are expressed in gold prices, while
on the Continent they are mainly expressed
in silver prices. The value of gold or silver,

   

 

 

66 i VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

like that of all other commodities, is regu- A
lated by the quantity of labor necessary for 7
getting them. You exchange a \certain 
amount of your national products,‘ in which {
a certain amount of your national labor is ;
crystallized", for the produce of the gold and a
silver producing countries, in which a cerp
tain quantity of their labor is crystallized. ’

It is in this way, in fact by barter, that you

learn to express in gold and silver the values ‘
of all commodities, that is the respective 
quantities of ‘labor bestowed upon them.’ .

Looking somewhat closer into the monetary
expression of value, ‘or what comes to the
same, the conversion of value into price, you

will ﬁnd that it is _a process by which you ~

give to the values of all commodities an in-
dependent and homogeneous form, or by

which you express them as quantities of .

equal social labor. So far as it is but the
monetary expression of value, price has been

called natural price by Adam Smith,’ “ pr-ix‘

nécessaire’ by the French physiocrats.
iWhat then is the relation between value

and market prices, or between natural prices .

VALUE AND LABOR 67

and market prices? You all know that the
market price is the same for all commodities
of the same kind, hoeweivieir the conditions of
production may differ for the individual
producers. The market price expresses only
the average amount of ‘social labor neces-
sary, under the average conditions of pro-
duction, to supply the market with a certain
mass of a certain article. It is calculated
upon the whole lot of a commodity of a cer-
tain description. ' T

So far the market price of a commodity
coincides with its value. On the other hand,
the oscillations of market prices, rising now
over, sinking now under the value or nat-
ural price, depend upon the ﬂuctuations of
supply and demand; The deviations of

~market prices from values are continual,

but as Adam Smith says: “The natural
price is the central price to which the prices
of commodities are continually gravitating.
Different accidents may ‘sometimes keep
them suspended at good deal above it, and
sometimes force them down even somewhat

below it. . But whatever may be the obsta—e

cles which hinder them from settling in this
center of repose and continuancethey are
constantly tending‘ towards it.” _

I cannot now sift this matter. It suffices
to say that if supply and demandequilibrate
each other, the market prices of commodi-
ties will correspond with their natural prices,
that is to say with their values, as deter-
mined by the respective quantities of labor
required for their production. But. supply
and demand must constantly tend to equi-
librate each other, although they do so only
by compensating one fluctuation by another,
a rise by a fall, and vice versd. If instead
of considering only the daily fluctuations
you analyze the movement of market prices
for longer periods, as Mr. Tooke. for exam-
ple, has done in his History of Prices, you
will ﬁnd that the ﬂuctuations of market
prices, their deviations ‘from values, their
ups and downs, paralyze and compensate
each other; so that apart from the effect of
monopolies and some other modiﬁcations I
must now pass by, all descriptions of com-
modities are, on the average, sold at their
respective values or natural prices. The

average periods during which the fluctua-
tions of market prices compensate each other
are different for different kinds of commod-
ities, because with one kind it is easier to
adapt supply to demand than with the other.

If then, speaking broadly, and embrac-
ing somewhat longer periods, all descrip-
tions of commodities sell at their respec-
tive values, it is nonsense to suppose that
proﬁt, not in individual cases, but that the
constant and usual proﬁts of different
trades spring from the prices of commodi-
ties, or selling them at a price over and
above their value. The absurdity of this
notion becomes evident if it is generalized.
What a_ man would constantly win as a seller
he would as constantly lose as a purchaser.
It would not do to say that there are men
who are buyers without being sellers, or
consumers without being producers. ‘ What
these people pay to the producers, they must
ﬁrst get from them for nothing. If a man
first takes your money and afterwards re-
turns that money in buying your commodi-
ties, you will never enrich yourselves by
selling your commodities too dear to "that

To explain, therefore, the general nature,
of profits, you must start from the theoremid
that, on an average, commodities are sold

, at their real ‘values, and that profits are ale'C_

r-iued from selling them at, their values, that
is, in proportion to the quantity \of labor;
realized in them, If you cannot explain;_

LABORIVNG POWER 1

Having now, as far as it could be done in
such a cursory manner, analyzed the nature
of Value, of the Value of any commodity
whatever, we must turn our attention to the
speciﬁc Value of Labor. _And here, again,

I must startle you by a seeming paradox. '

All of you feel‘ sure that What they daily
sell is their Labor; that, therefore, Labor
has a" Price, and that, the price of a'com-
modity being only the monetary expres-
sion of its value, there must certainly exist
such a thing as the Value of Labor. How~
ever‘; there exists no such, thing as the Value
ofLabor in -the common -acceptance of the
word." We have seen that the amount of

necessary labor crystallized in a commodity V I

constitutes its value. Now, applying this

1“ Labor Power” in the English translation of
Das Kapital. V

.71

 

72 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

notion of value, how could we deﬁne, say, 

the value of a ten hours "working day?

How much labor is contained in that day? ».
Ten hours’ labor. To say that the value of 
a ten hours working «day is equal to ten

‘hours’ labor, or the quantity of labor con- 

tained in it, would be a tautological and, i
moreover, a nonsensical expression. Of 
course, having once found. out the true but 
hidden sense of the expression “ Value of ",
Labor,” we shall be able to interpret this 

» irrational, and seemingly impossible appli- 

cation of value, in the same way that, hav- 

ing once made, sure of the real movement

of the celestial bodies; we shall be able to -i
explain‘ their apparent or merely phenome~. l_

na] movements. ’

.What the working man sells is not di~ 1
rectly his Labor, but his Laboring Power, i

the temporary disposal of which he makes to

over to the capitalist. This is so much the ,1
case that I do’ not know whether by the ,

English Laws, but certainly by some Con-;

tinental Laws, the maximum time is fixed T
for which ‘a man is allowed to sell his la-5

indeﬁnite- period whatever, slavery would be
immediately restored. Such a sale, if it
comprised his lifetime,‘ for example, would
make him at once the lifelong slave of his
employer. ‘ ‘
One of the oldest economists and most
original philosophersvof England — Thomas
Hobbes———has already, in his Leviathan,
instinctively hit upon this point overlooked
by all his successors. He says: “The
value’ or worth of :a man is, as in all other
things, his price: that is _so much as would
be given for the Use aﬁhis Power.”
-Proceeding from this basis, we shall be
able to determine the Value of Labor as
that of all other commodities._ ' L
But before doingso, we might ask, how
does this strange phenomenon arise, that
we ﬁnd onithe marketa set of buyers, pos-
sessed of land, machinery,‘ raw material.
and the means of subsistence, all of ‘them,
save land in" its crude stategthe ‘products of
labor, and on the other hand, a set of sellers
who have nothing to sell except their la-
boring power, their working arms. and
brains? That the one set buys continually

in order to make a proﬁt and enrich them- 
selves, whi1e~the other set continually sells’ 
in order to earn their livelihood? The in-
quiry into this question would be an inquiry
into what the economists call “Previous, 
or Original Accumulation,” but which 5
ought to be called Original Expropriation. ,_
We should ﬁnd that this so-called Original 
Accumulation means nothing but a series I A
of historical processes, resultingin a De- -
composition of the Original Union existing
between the-Laboring Man and his Instru-
ments of Labor. _Such an inquiry, however,
lies beyond the pale of my present subject. '

Power? ‘ - ,-
Like that of every other commodity, its‘

LABORING POWER 

bor necessary to produce it. p The laboring
power of a man exists only in his 1-iving
individuality. _A certain mass of necessa-
ries must be consumed by a man to grow up

 

and maintain his life. But the man, like i

the machine, will wear out, and must be re-
placed by another man. Beside the mass of
necessaries required for his own mainte-
nance, he wants another amount of neces-
saries to bring up a certain quota of children
that are to replace him on the labor market
and to perpetuate the,race ‘of-. laborers.

Moreover, to develop" his laboring power, -

and acquire a given -skill, another amount of
values must be spent.. For our purpose it
suﬂices to consider only average labor. the
costs of whose education and development
are vanishing magnitudes. Still I must
seize upon this occasion to state that, as-the
costs of producing laboring powers of dif-
ferent quality differ, so‘ must differ the
values of the laboring powers employed in
different trades.‘ The cry for an equality

of wages rests, therefore, upon a mistake,

 

is an insane wish never to be ‘fulﬁlled. It is
an offspring of that false and superﬁcial

  

 

76 VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

radicalism that accepts premises and ‘tries

to evade conclusions. ‘ Upon the basis ‘of

the wages system the value of laboring
power is "settled like that of every other
commodity: and as different kinds of la:
boring power have in different values, or". tie-

'quire different quantities of labor for their

production, they must fetch different prices
i.n the labor market. To clamor for equal
or even equitable retribution on the basis of
the wages system is the same as to clamor
for freedom on the basis of the slavery sys~
tern. What youithink just or equitable is
out of the question. The question is: VVhat

 

is necessary and unavoidable with a given _ on

system of production?

Aftjerwhat has been said, it will be seen
that the value of laboring power is deter-
mined by theivalne of the necessaries‘re—
quired to produce, develop, maintain, and

’ perpetuate the laboring‘ power."

 

VIII

’ PRODUCTION OF SURPLUS VALUE

Now suppose that the average amount of

the daily necessaries of a laboring man re~

quire six hours of average labor for their
production. Suppose, moreover, six hours
of average labor to be also realized in a
quantity of gold equal to 35. Then 33.
would be the Price, or the monetary ex-
pression of the Daily. Value of that man’s
Laboring Power. If he worked daily six
hours he would daily produce a value suffi-
cient to buy the average amount of his daily

‘necessaries, or to maintain himself as a la-

boring man.

’But our man is a wages laborer. He
must, therefore, sell his laboring powerto
a capitalist. If he sells it at 33. daily, or
18s. weekly, he sells it at its value. Sup-
pose him «to be a spinner. If he works six

hours daily he will add to the cotton a value

of 33. daily. This value, daily added by

him, would be an exact equivalent for the
wages, or the price of his laboring power,
received daily. But in that case 120 surplus
value or surplus produce whatever would go
to the capitalist. Here, then, we ‘come to the
rub. , ,
In buying the laboring power of the

-V workman, and paying its value, the capital- ’

ist, like every other purchaser, has acquired
the right to consume or use the commodity
bought. You consume or use the laboring
power of a man by making him work, as
you consume or use a machine by making it
run. By buying the daily or weekly value

«of the laboring power of the workman, the

capitalist has, therefore, acquired the right
to use or make that laboring power work
during the whole day or week. The work»
ing day or the working week has, of course,
certain limits, but those we shall afterwards
look more closely at. i

For the present Iwant to turn your at-
tention to one decisive point. .

 

,The value of the laboring power is de-/

termined by the quantity of labor necessary

‘‘,<‘'‘\f

‘  vi. ~ ' -\ a, v ‘;_ ‘

PRODUCTION OF SURPLUS VALUE 

to maintain or reproduce it, but the use of

that laboring power is only limited by the '

active energies and physical strength of the
laborer. The daily or weekly value of the
laboring power is quite distinct from the
daily or weekly exercise of that power, the
same as the food a horse wants and the time
it can ‘carry the horseman are quite distinct.
The quantity of labor by which the value of
the worl<man’s laboring power is limited
forms by no means a limit to the quantity of
labor ,which his laboring power is apt to

’ perform. Take the example of our spin-
ner. We have/seen that. to daily repro-
, duce his laboring power, he must daily re-i

produce a value of three shillings‘, which he
Will do by working six hours daily- But
this"does not disable him from working ten
or twelve or more hours a day. But by
paying the daily or weekly value of the spin-
ner’s laboring power the capitalist has ac-
quired the right of using that laboring
power during the whole day or week. He
will. therefore, make him work say, daily,

twelve hours. Over and above the six _

hours required to replace his wages, or the

 

So i VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

value of his laboring power, he will, there»

fore, have to work six other hours, which
I’ shall call hours of surplus labor, which
surplus labor will realize itself in a surplus
value and a surplus produce. If our spin—
her, for example, by his daily labor of six

hours, added threeshillings’ value to the,

cotton, a value forming an exactequivalent
to his wages, ‘he will,’in twelve hours, add
six shillings’ worth to the cotton, and pro-
duce a proportional surplus of yarn. As
he has sold his laboring power to the capi-
talist, the whole value or produce created ‘by
him belongs to the capitalist, the owner pro
tem.. of his laboring power-. By "advancing
three shillings, the capitalist will, therefore,
realizea value of six shillings, because, ad-
vancing a value in which six hours of labor

are crystallized, he will receive in return‘ a[

value in which twelve hours of labor are

crystallized. By repeating this same process ,

daily, the capitalist will c-lailyadvance three
shillings and daily pocketsix shillings, one
half of which will go to pay wages anew,
and the otherhalf of which will form sur-

tween capital and labor upon which capital-
istic production, or the wages systemj. is
founded, and which must constantly result
in reproducing the working man as a work-
ing-. man, and the capitalist as a capitalist.
The rate of surplus value, all other circum-
stances remaining the same, will depend on
the ‘proportion between that part of the

italist. It will, therefore, depend on the

VALUE OF LABOR

We must now return to the expression,
“ Value, or Price of Labor.” '

We have seen that, in fact, it is onlythe
value of the laboring power,’ measured by
the values of comngodities necessat y for ‘its
maintenance. But since the workman re-
ceives his wages after his labor is per-
formed, and knows, moreover, that what he
actually gives to the capitalist is his labor,

the value or price of ‘his laboring power nec- N

essarily appears to him as the price or value .
of his labor itself. If the price of his la-
boring poweris three shillings, in which six‘

hours of labor are realized, and if he works
twelve hours, he necessarily considers these

three shillings as the value or price of twelve -

hours of labor, although these twelve hours
Of: labor realize themselves in a value of six

shillings. A double consequence flows from
this. i

Firstly. The value or price of the lqb0r- ‘

ing power takes the semblance of the price or
value of labor itself, although, strictly speak-

ring, value and price of labor are senseless

terms.

_ . Secondly. Although one part only of the

Workman’s daily "labor is paid, while the
other part is unpaid, and while that unpaid
or surplus labor constitutes exactly the fund
out of whichl surplus value or profit is
formed, it seems as if the aggregate labor
waspaid labor. ‘

V This false appearance distinguishes wages
labor. from other historical forms of labor.

On the basis of the wages system even the ,

unpaid labor seems to be paid labor. .VVith
the slave, on the contrary, even that part of
his labor which is paid appears to be unpaid.
Of course, in order to work the slave must
live, and one part of his working day goes
to replace the value of his own maintenance.
But since no bargain is struck between him
and his master, and no acts of selling and

buying are going on between the two parties,

all his labor seems to be given away for
nothing. ‘V K , _~

., Take, on the other hand, the peasant serf,
such as he, I might say, until yesterday ex-
isted in the whole East of Europe. This
peasant worked, for example, three days for
himself on his own ﬁeld or the ﬁeld allotted
to him, and the three subsequent days he
performed compulsory and gratuitous la-

bor on the estate of his lord. Here, then,  .

thepaid and unpaid parts of laborpwere sen-
sibly separated, separatedin time and space;
and our Liberals overﬂowed with moral in-
dignation at the preposterous notion ’ of
making a man work for nothing,

In point of fact, however, whether a man
works three days of the‘ week for himself
on his own ﬁeld and three days fornothing
on the estate of his lord, or whether he
works in the factory or the workshop. six
hours daily for himself and six for his em-

ployer, comes to the same, although in the ,

PROFIT IS MADE BY SELLING A COMMODITY
AT ITS VALUE ’

Suppose an average hour of labor to be‘

realized in a value equal to sixpence, or
twelve average hours of labor to betrealized
in six shillings. Suppose, further, the
value of labor to be three shillings or the
produce of six hours’ labor. If, then, in
the raw material, machinery, and so forth,
used up in a commodity, twenty-four hours
of average labor were realized,’ its value
would amount to twelve shillings. If,

moreover, the workman employed by the A

capitalist added twelve hours of labor to
those means of production, these twelve
hours*would be realized in an additional
value of six shillings. The total value

of the product would, therefore,» amount

to thirty-six hours of realized labor, and
be equal to _ eighteen shillings. But as
‘ 86 ’

 

    

PROFIT MADE 1: -3ELL.ING COMMODITY 8;

the value of labor, or the wages pa’... in
the workman, would be three shillings only,
no equivalent would have been paid by the

capitalist for the six hours of surplus la-~

bor worked by the workman, and realized
in the value of the commodity. By selling
this commodity at its value for eighteen
shillings, the capitalist would, therefore,
realize a value of three shillings, for which
he; had paid no equivalent. These three
shillings would constitute the surplus value
or proﬁt pocketed by him. The capitalist
would consequently realize the proﬁt of
three shillings, not by selling his commodity
at a price over and above its value, but by
selling it at its real value. T

The value of a commodity is determined ‘
,by the total quantity of labor contained in

it. But part of that quantity of labor is
realized in a value, for which an equivalent
has been paid in the form of wages; part
- ’ it is realized in a value‘ for which no
equivalent has been paid. Part of the la-
bor contained in the commodity is pai ' la

part of that surplusvalue, so that there re-
mains to the employing capitalist as such
only what is called industrial or commer-
cial proﬁt. _

-By what laws this division of the total
amount of surplus value amongst the three
categories of people .is regulated is a ques-
tion quite foreign to our subject. This
much, however, results from what has been
stated. l I

Rent, Interest, and Industrial Proﬁt are
only different names for different parts of
the surplus value of the commodity, or the
unpaid "labor enclosed in it, and they are
equally derived from this source, and from

this source alone. They are not derived '

from land as such or from capital as such,
but land and capital enable their owners to
get their respective shares out of the sur-
plus value extracted by the employing capi-
talist from the laborer. For the laborer
himself it is a matter of subordinate im-
portance whether that surplus value, the re-

own capital and to be his own landlord, then
the whole surplus value would go‘ into his
pocket. _

It is the employing capitalist who imme-

T diately ¢xtracts from the laborer this sur-

plus value, whatever part of it he -may ulti-
mately be able to keep for himself. Upon

this relation, therefore, between the em-~

ploying capitalist and the wages laborer the
whole wages system and the whole present
system of production hinge. Some of the
citizens who took part in our debate were,
therefore, wrong in trying to mince matters,

and to treat this fundamental relation be-‘

tween the employing capitalist and the

/

working man as a secondary question, 211- '

though, they were right in stating that, un-
-der given t circumstances, _a. rise of prices
might affect in very unequal degrees the

eyed capitalist, and», if you please, the tax-
gatherer. ' . V

Another consequence follows from what
has been stated.

That part of the value of the commodity
which represents only the value of the raw
materials, the machinery, in one word, the
value of the means of production used up,
forms no revenue at all, but replaces only
capitaf. ‘But, apart from this, it is false
that theiother part of the value of the__ com-
modity which forms revenue, or may be

 

spent in the form of wages, proﬁts, rent, in-'

terest, is constituted bythevalue of wages,
the ..value of rent, the-value of proﬁts, and

so forth. We shall, in the ﬁrst instance,

discard wages, and only treat industrial
proﬁts, interest, and rent. We have just
seen that the surplusvalue contained in the
commodity or that part of its value in which
unpaid labor is realized, resolves itself into
different fractions, bearing three different
names. But it would be quite the reverse
of the truth to say that its value is composed
of, or formed by, the addition of the inde-
pendent values of these three constituents. .

 

SURPLUS VALUE DECOMPOSED 

If one hour of labor realizes itself in a
value of sixpence, if the wor.king day of
the laborer comprises twelve hours, if half
of this time is unpaid labor, that surplus
labor will add to the commodity a surplus
value of three shillings, that is of value for
which no equivalent has been paid. This
surplus valueofthree shillings constitutes
the whole fund which the employing capi-

“talist may divide, in whatever proportions,

with the landlord and the money—lender.

The value of these three shillings constitutes‘

the limit of the value they have to divide
amongst them. But it is not the employ-
ing capitalist who addsto the value of the

, commodity an arbitrary value for his proﬁt,

to which another value is added for the
landlord, and so forth, so that the addition
of these arbitrarily ﬁxed values would.con—
stitute the total value. You see, therefore,

the fallacy of the popular notion, which con-.

founds the decomposition of a given value
into threeparts, with the formation of that

value by the addition of three independent-
values, thus converting the aggregate value, p

94 / VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT

from which rent, proﬁt, and interest are
derived, into an arbitrary magnitude.

If the total proﬁt realized by a capitalist
is equal~to £100, we call this sum, consid-
ered as absolnte magnitude, the amount of
profit. But if we calculate the ratio which
those £100 bear to the capital advanced, we
call this relative magnitude, the rate of
profit. It is evident that this rate of proﬁt
may be expressed in a double way.

‘Suppose £100 to be the capital advanced
in wages. If the surplus value created is
also £Ioo——and this would show us that
half the working day of the laborer consists

 

of unpaid labor—-and if ‘we measured this,

proﬁt by the value of the capital advanced
in wages, we should say that the rate of
profit amounted to one hundred per cent.,
because the value advanced would be one
hundred and the value realized would be
two hundred. ,

If, on the other hand, we should not only
consider the capital advanced in wages, but
the total capital advanced, say, for ex-
ample, £500, of which £400 represented the
value of raw materials, machinery, and so

 

 

1

SURPLUS ’ VALUE DECOMPOSED 

forth, we should say that the rate of profit
amounted only to twenty per cent., because

the proﬁt of one hundred would be but the V

ﬁfth part of the total capital advanced.
The ﬁrst mode of expressing the rate of
proﬁt is the only one which shows you the

-real ratio ‘between paid and unpaid labor,

the real _degree of the exploitation (you
must allow me this French word) of labor.
The other modepof expression is that in
common use, and is, indeed, appropriate for
certain purposes. At all events, it is very
useful for concealing the degree in which
the capitalist extracts gratuitous labor from
the workman. »

[In the remarks I‘ have still to make I
shall use the word Profit for the whole
amount of the surplus value extracted by the
capitalist without any regard to the division
of that surplus value between different

. parties, and in ‘using the words Rate of

 

Proﬁt, I shall always measure proﬁts by the

_ value. of the capital advanced in wages.

GENERAL RELATION OF PROFITS, WAGES AND
PRICES

Deduct from the value of a commodity
the value replacing the value of the raw ma-

terials and other means’ of production used. .

upon it, that is to say, deduct the value rep-
resenting the past labor contained in it, and
the remainder of its value will resolve into
the quantity of labor added by the working
man last employed. If that working man
works twelve hours daily, if twelve hours of
average labor crystallize themselves in an
amount of gold equal to six shillings, this
additional value of six shillings is the only
value his labor will have created. This
given value, determined by the time of his
labor, is the only fund from which both he
and the capitalist have to draw their ‘respec-

- tive shares or dividends, the only value to

evident that this value itself will not be al-

may be divided amongst the two parties.
There will also be nothing changed if in /the
