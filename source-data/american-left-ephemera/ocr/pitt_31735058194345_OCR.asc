II. POWER AND SISTER]-IOOD

As socialist feminists we have a-n analysis of who has power and who does not, the
basis for that power and our potential as women to gain power. Sisterhood is powerful in
our personal lives, in our relationships with other women, in providing personal energy and
maintaining warmth and love. But sisterhood is revolutionary because it can provide a
basis on which we can unite to seize power.

The focus on power is an institutional focus, one that examines the structure of existing in-
stiutions and determines who, specifically, has power and how that power is used to oppress
women. This includes understanding the interrelation between the economic sector and the
social institutions which reinforce ruling class control. The family, church, schools and govern-
ment priorities which oppress us reflect and reinforce this control. These are reflected in and
are served by the dominant ideology, a cultural dominance which controls our everyday private
lives. '

In America, our culture so reflects the ideas of those in power that it is often difficult to iden-

tify who the enemy is. The opposition seems to be all encompassing and everywhere, hard
-to pinpoint in origins or basics.  ruling class, so reinforced, often appears as a monolith

of control. ‘However, as feminists and as socialists we are able to analyze the basic’ structures

of society and how these are used to oppress women. This focus on power provides a frame-

work for analyzing how power relations can be altered. A *

In this section, we focus on a strategy for developing mass women’s organizations by focusing
on the relationship that we see between reforms and power. There are three questions crucial
to our conception of this relationship: 1) Will the reform materially improve women’s lives?
2) Will the reform give women a sense of their own power? 3) Will the reform alter existing
relations of power? *

The Self-Interest of Women

Women are for liberation not just for abstract reasons and a sense of what is “correct” for
women, or because they will be the “wave of the future.” They are attracted because we pre-

sent a picture of reality that they also know, as well as hold out a vision that they wish to share.

But talking of such a reality is not sufficient. If we are going to be a movement of all women,
we must be able to serve our own self-interest. Unable to fully offer alternatives for women

« ourselves, we must beable to hold out the realistic promise of obtaining some of these alter-
‘ natives through struggles which can be won.

We emphasize self-interest because we feel that recently the movement has gotten far away
from thinking about it or what moves women to act, or what moves us to act. Idealism alone
now guides us abstractly. We argue it, we live it, we see it. But we cannot always count on
it. We raise the subject of self-interest to insure that we really are speaking to women’s needs.

However, we do not emphasize self-interest in any narrow sense. Self-interest is not just the
accumulation of all physical and concrete needs. We know women do not live by bread alone
and want deeply for themselves and others the enjoyment of culture and relationships that
express their hopes and accomplishments. Self-interest is the interest of our sisters and our
_c_l§__ss. It means bringing into‘ being and recognizing our consciousness, culture and control

of the society.

10

We must develop ways to transform women’s currently felt interests in line with our vision. Real
sisterhood changes concern from individual needs into concern for one’s group, organizational and
class needs. With strategy and struggle for short-term goals, women can come to perceive a
long-term self-interest. Abstract social goals are defined and given concrete form in program.

We should choose issues for our direct action campaigns around which women will unite, can

win, and on which their views of what is advantageous to them will change.

For ‘example, while destroying racism is a deep concern of ours, we would not organize white
women around racism as an issue. Stated as such, it is not concrete enough to do something
about; and it is not a concern for most white women. However, uniting white and black groups-
around common concerns would be a concrete way to objectively also fight racism. We also
can develop means to discuss and make explicit these ideas. But direct action for concrete re-
forms makes our ideology have real content.

Winning

If we want to speak to most women, we have to be serious about winning. Women have been
loserstoo long. Women will only ﬂock to women’s- liberation ideas when they know that it

A will help them and others become winners, gain something that they want for themselves and

their daughters and others. This differentiates us from many groups such as PL, IS, and purist
sects more concerned with the correctness of political principles than in converting a simple,
true ideainto a means for winning something for the people involved. -

We want better lives for ourselves and others now. We would not want success for some at the
expense of others, but we want to fight to win for success. Out of this commitment to our
sisters, we have challenged our own thinking, our own sense of weakness, and our own inability
to push ahead, so we may solidify the gains our movement is making and move to greater gains.

We know this treads on our fear of success (often. greater than our fears of failure). “If you win,
do you really lose‘? ” Women have been losers so long, we often resist any chance at material
victories. It is important to consider how we define victories to avoid co-optation. This goes
back to our original criteria forstrategy. Wefight for reforms that will improve women’s lives
but we place priority on developing struggles which will also give women a sense of their own
power and limit the arbitrary power of those incontrol.

We do not believe that reform built on reform will eventually lead to socialism or women’s
liberation. We anticipate a severe rift in social relations or many such breaks prior to full
alterations in power. But we think that the increased demands for real benefits created by
this strategy will heighten contradictions and prepare us for struggles leading to the rift. The
nature of this revolution and the future that follows it will :l;fédefined by the struggles leading
up to it. - i

As long as we are not effective, winning, feeling our strength, sometimes there is a danger of
resentment toward our sisters with statements like, “why is it they can’t see and they won’t

join us? ”~ This will happen to an extent as long as we’re not effective. The main burden is

on us to provide activity that women will want to join. If women do not join us, our first

thought must be: what are we doing that is not clear enough, not related sufficiently to the

specific problems women are facing that they are not joining us? . Of course, there are many

reasons women may not join us at certain times, for example, threats from their husbands, fear

of social identification, lack of babysitters or real disagreements. Our task is finding ways to develop

‘ and build our strength as a movement. To this end we propose this strategy.

11

Power and Reform .

The socialist feminist strategy aims at realigning power relations through the process of building’ a

base of power for women through a mass movement united around struggling for our self-interest.

Our goal is to build this movement. We oppose the -utopian position which argues against any
change until the perfect solution is possible. On the other hand, we also are not for working
on any and every reform’ action that presents itself._ Our strategy allows us to define priorities
and timetables to lend structure to.issues in. terms of particular situations.

Decisions about what reforms to fight for and howgmust be made on the basis of the following
three criteria:

I. WILL THE REFORM MATERIALLY IMPROVE WOMEN’S LIVES? Our lives as women
are oppressivein many ways; therefore we want to work to improve our lives now. Whatever
our priorities, we must focus on meeting our immediate needs. When we can show that we can
meet women’s needs they will want to join us. While we believe that sexist capitalism’ cannot
implement all of the reforms we are for, it is possible to use its own rules against itself. That
is, we can force change through pressure. Thus, our strategy is quite different from that of ‘
raising maximalist demands —'-- demanding something that can’t be done under capitalism

in order to prove that capitalism is bad. Many reforms are really beneficial to us, can be won
and build our confidence. Nevertheless, the reform itself is not the only end. We also are
oppressed by our real (and felt) lack of power to control that reform.

2. WILL THE STRUGGLE FOR THE REFORM GIVE WOMEN A SENSE OF THEIR" OWN
POWER? We need to struggle around issues where success is obviously o_1_1_r victory rather. than
a gift from those in power. Ourstruggle for reforms mustfbuild our movement. _Our move-
ment’s strength can only be sustained through organizations. Through organizations, individ-
ual women can collectively have a sense of their power. Otherwise, even when we win, we -don’t
know it or can’t claim it. (Who forced troop withdrawals in Indochina —— the President or the
movement? Who forced abortion law reform in New York —— the state legislature or the
women’s movement? ) Through organizations, one victory builds ‘on another. They, have ‘a
life longer than the individual participants and strength greater than their parts.

3. WILL THE REFORM ALTER EXISTING RELATIONS OF POWER? vW‘omen*in American I '

society have’ little control over any aspect‘. of our lives. We want not only concrete improve-
ments but the right to decide on those improvements and priorities. We want power restruc-
tured, wealth redistributed, and an end to exploitation. Those most closely affected by insti-
tutions have the right to decide what those institutions do. (This means councils of workers,
consumers of an institution’s services, parents in childcare centers, etc.)

Most projects now, of great value to our movement, work on only one or two of the above
points. The third is the most difficult and least developed in our movement. Specific battles
may not win or even try" to work on all three levels. But our lasting success will’ depend on
interrelating the three points on and among projects. I

12

Toleration and Priorities

We want to emphasize the need for a multi-level approach to women’s liberation. Having" such an
approach, we can avoid some of the pitfalls of dogmatic sectarianism about the correctness of a
single issue or program. We must be open and encourage alternatives. The need for a coherent
strategy which encompasses education, service and action —- but mixes them consciously --
cannot be emphasized too much. There aresome moments when an issue is ripe and other times
when it is important, but will not move women, cannot be won and does not speak to women’s
felt needs. ‘

But we cannot degenerate into a vague pluralism that says any effort is as good as any other ef-
fort. We can be anti-sectarian, encourage a variety of approaches and know that we must move

' to many approaches and reach the many aspects of our lives as women. At the same time, we

can follow a coherent strategy to set priorities for immediate work that we think are important.
Of course, the test of tolerance and sectarianism is in reality. We must see how we are perceived,
received and grow. Reality is a good cure.

Applying the Three Criteria _

We welcome almost any activity that works for women. At this time, however, we wish to em-
phasize the importance of all three criteria mentioned earlier: improving women’s lives, giving

women a sense of their power, and altering relations of power. The three criteria should be applied
to any proposed activity. ’ .

On the abortion issue, for example, the socialist feminist approach is different from seeking only
legislative change by working through closed channels and thereby maintaining the right of those
in power to make the rules. Victories on the abortion issue must be WON by women actively
fighting for their rights. During the struggle it is important to focus on who is making and in-
ﬂuencing decisions about abortion and to identify these individuals and institutions to women.

This approachis broader than a “write your senator” campaign. It means, for example, finding
out and publicizing the church groups lobbying against abortion and challenging their tax-exampt
status for lobbying. It also means finding out what corporate executives are on those church

‘boards and launching consumer action against them and their businesses for their support

of the church’s lobby. Anyicampaign undertaken should identify such interconnections. We
must unite women in direct, political action to’ change such repressive measures as the abortion
law and at the same time focus on the power relations of those involved. Victories can be
achieved and our campaigns are specific enough so that we can-measure our success or failures.

Positive action may include a variety of activities, such as:

- Confrontation with specific demands

— Negotiation
— Forcing an issue at a public hearing
_ Embarrassment pressure —— picketing, for example

_ Public expose in the press or in a hearing

-4 Mass public protest meeting A

— Mass demonstration tied to a specific campaign

_ Guerilla and dramatic activities (WITCH, etc.)

_ Legal, disruptive actions —— strikes, boycotts, stockholders meetings, for example.

Civil disobedience ——This may be useful on_occasion, but we think.at many times other
tactics may be just as effective, less alienating to potential allies, and less costly.

13

Thetpoint is activity selected should be related to an overall strategy around a particular issue
and with an eye toward what will achieve the reform and build the movement.

The political action approaﬂl described above is different from many activities of such groups
as Moratorium which organized direct actions withouta permanent mass organizational frame-
work. Such groups do not involve a mass of women in continuing, persistent work and do not
focus on targets that can result both in reform victories and a shift of power relations. Large
demonstrations are fine to focus attention on an abstract issue of a generalized principle (such
as free abortion on demand, no forced sterilization, free 24«-hour client-controlled childcare,
etc.). However, to win in both the above senses, the demand must be directed toward some

individual in the institution from whom a response is demanded and who actually has the power _

to do something.

Groups such as SWP-YSA do not acknowledge the importance of these power demands in mass
struggles. They have no intermediate strategyto move from reform‘ to revolution such as this
workers’ or client control strategy provides. As a result, they fluctuate between ultimate de-
mands with no possibility of winning (free, 24-hour child-care, for example) and "minimal re-V _
form demands (the right to leaflet, for example) unable to build "a challenge to existing power
relations. —

Issues for further consideration

No strategy is without difficulties, or right‘ for every circumstance. This strategy we have
found most useful for a great variety of current situations. We need to further develop the _
ideas, learning from action, so that we not only win, but win what we want. As we develop,
we need to keep in min-d issues such as the following: '

._ This is an intermediate strategy. We must re-evaluate our work to insure that we
move along a revolutionary trajectory. A

— We must provide ways that people can move from an understanding of specific
issues, to an understanding of inter-related social reactions.

— We need keep both ultimate and immediate concerns in mind. We must be con-
scious of ways in which our ideology is defined and implied in specific struggles.
Doing so, we must take into account the needs and strengths of the individuals,
their understanding of what is possible and the nature of the opposition.

To help do all these things, we need reference groups which can put our organizing efforts

into context. Such groups help us choose priorities between struggles and develop strategy
for revolutionary struggles. /

14

Role of Cou nter-institu tions

A major trend in the current women’s movement is to organize counter-institutional projects to
directly meet the needs of women. This work is important for the women’s movement but must
occur in the context of a movement which has other foci as well.

Counter-institutions can do a number of things. They can help to raise the expectations of women
who use and staff the institutions as to what is possible. They can provide services which meet the
needs of women now. They can demonstrate that the problems addressed are social in nature and
in solution. They convey to the broad constituencies we seek to address that we have positive

' programs to offer for solving the problems we draw attention to, and that we are not simply nega-

tive in orientation. In contrast to consciou sness-raising, such programs dispel the specter of end-
less problems without apparent solutions. . ' -

For example, a feminist-sponsored health center provides a needed service that materially improves
our immediate condition. It demonstrates that women acting together can change some of their
circumstances. It can contribute to building an organized base of power among women ready to
fight on an ongoing basis for their rights. ‘

However, counter-institutions have some limitations. They may foster false optimism about change
by indicating that problems can be solved in the spaces between existing institutions. Such programs
could take up all the time of more than all of us involved in the present movement and never meet —
all the needs. Such activities cannot alter the power relations if they make no demands on those '

in power. '

We argue the importance of combining counter-institutions with direct action‘ organizing to build-

on the strengths of each. Such organizing focuses demands on social institutions, thus countering

the conclusion that society is unchangeable. It also counters an over—optimism about the potential
of self—help to change womcn’s lives by pressing the point that significant changes can be made for

all women only through far-reaching changes in power relations. The most useful role of the counter-
institutional projects is providing a vision for an alternative and at the sametime demonstrating

the need for demanding change from those in power.

How Do We Get Power? (Or Building and Maintaining Real Sisterhood)

Focusing specifically on political or direct action, how do we incorporate this appraoch into our
movement? We believe that many women would join us if we had the structures and activities
so they could become involved in struggles on concrete issues. We need a perspective which will
allow us to undertake both short and long term struggles and campaigns which have a focus on
winning. Following is a partial summary of the criteria we feel must be considered in selecting
and planning a program for direct action:

The goals of the movement should be ones which can:

"— broaden and relate to many aspects of women’s lives

—— convert a vision into specific activity

- help women gain self-respect 9

— unite women and build a mass organization because it focuses on women’s needs
— identify the felt needs that would move women to fight on the issue

15

A project should be chosen so that it:

—— moves women into direct action and groups where they can evaluate their efforts , '
_(e.g. ongoing organizations) -
— can identify specifically what institutions and who within those institutions cxer- .
cises control over the issue and has the power to make reforms in response to pressure

— identifies -what a victory would be

The project should: D _
e be broken into parts and fought as reforms that can conceivably be won

i— provide step-by-step activity for involvement‘

Application of the Strategy: An Example

In developing a concrete strategy, it is necessary to plan full campaigns having. many aspects which
translate a general issue into an implementable program. Here is an example of how some of us

. developed one project —— fighting for child care with the Action Committee for Decent Childcare.

We based this project on the kinds of ideas offered in this paper.

Ideology. We had decided that a struggle for free, 24-hour, client-controlled childcare would meet
"our" ideological criteria. However, this position, as an initial statement of our goals, had an immediate
weakness. Raising this demand before we had an organization alienated us from even the women
who later became our strongest allies. Our vision seemed so wild-eyed, so far from the existing"
situation, that it appeared completely unrealistic. Once we won some specific demands, raising

these same ideals became more rational and acceptable because the possibility was real —— women
began to gain a sense of their own power. ’ ‘

It should be pointed out that we had decided to form a mass organization. We were attempting

to reach a different group of women from those already in the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union,
an anti"-capitalist feminist organization. We felt that women who worked with the Action Com-
mittee for Decent Childcare would, at some point, become interested in joining CWLU. Such
women would probably never join a women’s liberation organization without some intermediate
alternative. But whether or not they joined CWLU, the movement’s ideas and strength would grow
with this mass form. -

This is not to say that it is necessary to have an organization like CWLU before a more mass based
organization can be built. Rather, in individual cities, women will need to determine who they
are attempting to reach, and the specific political context of their situation.

We are also not opposed to raising our vision as a demand; and in fact, there are some instances
where that may be very important. Out of our experience, however, we learned the significance

of-fully understanding who the constituency is, and what the organization is attempting to accomplish.

A second problem we faced was in our understanding of our oppression as women. We knew that
childcare was an issue for many women,but failed to take into consideration the problems such
womenface. The very women we hoped to involve (those with young children) were among the
least likely to ever be active in any kind of social movement. They simply don’t have the time
(because they don’t have childcare), are less mobile, and don’t think of themselves as active com-
munity members. The prevailing notion that women need something to do after their children
are in school also makes these women less likely to consider becoming involved.

16

Development of a strategy: We spent three months gathering information about every aspect of
the issue of childcare and considering all of the alternatives for vying for power. After the initial
period, research was used to __serve actions. We immediately eliminated the federal level since it

is too remote to attack without a national organization to force some change. However, in in-
stances where local offices really have power they might be‘ appropriate targets. State and local
agencies (and perhaps a few federal branches with responsibility for implementing guidelines or
overseeing state and local programs) appeared to be easier and more aiccessful targets. With the
state level dominated by Republicans and the local level by Democrats (as is often the case) we

‘ also considered ways to play one off against the other.

In carrying out this research we attempted to determine the real sources of power versus the win-

. dow dressing or public relations functions. With childcare, a problem exists, because there really"

is no money allocated. Therefore there is little real power that can be fought for. It is much
more ambitious to demand that childcare be a priority (which necessitates an appropriation of
funds) than to redirect existing funding, increase, or control it.

The specific focus for our initial work included consideration of:

1. Whose Problem Is It? Who is our possible constituency? How do they see the problem?
Each aspect should be considered, and specific appeals and actions developed for each.
For example, women who need child care are those who:

work days or nights V

are in schools or training programs

‘can't afford child care — poor, middle-class

are accused of child abuse or are in rehabilitation programs (i.e., drug abuse programs
often have large budgets)

want to go off welfare or are being pushed off

want to inﬂuence the type of care available for their children (including part-time
and nursery school users, who often see themselves separately from full child care
users.)

g. need child care to go shopping or on other errands

h. need it for social service work or civic responsibilities (i.e., churches, hospitals and

shopping centers could be made responsible to their constituencies and supporters
and people who keep them in business)
i. -are single parents and must work
j. want a few hours away from their children (Setting up tot lots where housewives can
socialize might bring such women together, breaking down their isolation doing private
work in the home.)

2. What are the Sources of the Problem?
This included research into the various pu blic and private interests involved, such as:

— State level: Department of Children and Family Services
Community Coordinated Childcare (4C’s)
Department of Public Aid
State Legislature

— Local level: Department of Human Resources
City Council
City departments with responsibility for licensing

—- Private sector: Industry Hospitals Unions
Colleges Department Stores Building Contractors
Churches Shopping Centers (Also federal guidelines

‘ for contractors, e.g. HUD codes)
3. Who has Information About the Problem? ‘ . .. - .

Here we talked with various bureaucrats, researchers, lobbying groups, social service agencies,
local community organizations, social service groups and groups of women working to open
childcare centers.

The Initial Strategy Undertaken. We considered institutional targets such as: colleges —— stu-
dents and staff; churches —— parishoners and local communities; indu stry—_— employees. Each
had some limitations as an initial project. For colleges, this seemed to be a more localized

struggle where we would need to engage in campus organizing from the beginning and where we
did not have an initial base. For churches there seemed to be some interest but most could not
move ahead because of licensing laws in the city. For industry, we focused on developing contacts
within unionized plants, for the union is the agent of the employees and had no reason

to trust us before we had developed a real organization. We also considered welfare but here,

.too, we did not have the initial base for our first project.

After examining each of the above areas with the continual question of what we could do to
meet women’s real needs, give women a sense of their power and alter power relations, we de-
cided on an initial strategy. Given the funding situation, we focused on licensing, an equally
great problem, but one that was more manageable. Existing licensing laws prevented centers
from opening rather than encouraging new centers.

Women became involved because of their need for childcare. Day care operators joined because
we could provide services, communication and expose their problems with the city government
in order to win real changes. This meant they took risks of retaliation by the city "(any center
can be closed down by using the arbitrary licensing laws against them)

When enough operators were involved and singling out any one individual became difficult.
Those who were vulnerable had parents organized for protection (with community hearings,
tours for the press of beautiful centers about to be closed down for lack of political pull).

18

Another important aspect in this issue is women’s concern as taxpayers that their taxes are being
used against their interests. This also broadened who joined us ———, womenwho were not
mothers, but concerned about women and as taxpayers felt they had a right to speak up.

Although initially we believed our constituency would be all white (this was our base in the beg: 3.
ginniﬂg)» we ve1'Y Successfull)’ developed a black and white organiz ation on the basis of selfiirrft-'-'7‘i

terest. In a black area, women demanded the creation of child care centers, because there were none. I

In an adjoining white area, women demanded that the few existing centers not be_:close_.dTdown. O_nce
united, other common issues were raised.  i " ‘

We discovered that a few initial victories are extremely important for self-confidence. A reputa-
tion that you can win brings others into the organization. In one year, the Action Committee
for Decent Childcare:

I-‘

. forced the city to undertake a complete review of all licensing procedures.
2. forced the Department of Human Resources to end closed-door meetings on childcare.

3. sponsored the first pi blic meeting with the Department of Human Resources in August
1971 on day care licensing problems.

4. forced the city to setup a committee under Murrell Syler, Director of Childcare Services

in the Mayor's Office, to review licensing (ACDC had half of the members on that committee). ,

5. written an analysis of the current codes, with recommendations for change that were used
as the basis for the new licensing codes.

6. sponsored a series of community meetings in Hyde Park, the Southwest side, and the
North side areas to which state representatives, senators,-and aldermen were invited to
present their positions on day care and to pledge support for specific proposals.

7. started moving toward community control of childcare.

8. made existing childcare groups more active in pressing for changes.

The next struggles will be to win changes, institution by institution, while other struggles are .
going on for women’s community decision-making over licensing and funding in the city (which
we have won partial victories on). ’

Orggnization. Our initial work focused on how to build an organization that could implement
our strategy. Locally-based community groups working both on their own local issues and on
concerns which required city-wide action seemed (and were) the best alternative. Such groups
are particularly important when working with a group of women who are not very mobile and

at the same time heighten the democracy of the organization and provide for the development

of skills among the women involved. We also found it necessary to develop different structures
for the many different roles women wanted and could play —— local chapters, forums, day care .
operator councils, plus a steering committee for coordination and decision-making in the organ-
ization.

-INTRODIUCTION

We have written this paper to express and share with other women ideas for a new strategy

’ for the women’s movement. Currently there are two ideological poles, representing the pre-

vailing tendencies within the movement. One is the direction toward new lifestyles within
a women’s culture,-emphasizing personal liberation and growth, and the relationship of

‘women to women. Given our real need to break loose from the old patterns —.— socially,

psychologically, and economically —— and given the necessity for new patterns in the post-

- revolutionary society, we understand, supportand enjoy this tendency. However, when
V it is the sole emphasis, we see it leading more towardia kind of formless insolation rather
. than to a condition in which we can fight for and win ‘power over our own lives.

The other direction is onerwhich emphasizes a structural analysis of our society and its

economic -base. It focuses on the ways in which productive relations oppress us. This
analysis is also correct, but its strategy, taken alone, can easily become, or appear to be,
insensitive to the total lives of women. ‘ V

As socialist feminists, we share both the personal and the structural analysis. We see a
combination of the two as essential if we are to become a lasting mass movement. We‘
think that it is important to define ourselves as socialist feminists, and to start conscious
organizing around this strategy. This must be done now because of the current state of .
our movement. We have reached a crucial point in our history.

On the one hand, the strengths of our movement are obvious: it has become an impor-

tant force of our time, and it has also succeeded in providing services and support for
some'women’s immediate needs. Thousands of women see themselves as part of the move-
ment; a vaguely defined “women’s consciousness” has been widely diffused through rap
groups, demonstrations, action projects, counter-institutional activity, and through ‘the

mass media. Women in the movement have a growing understanding of common oppression
and the imperative of collective solutions. With the realization that what we saw as personal
problems were in fact social ones, we have come to understand that the solutions must also
be social ones. With the realization that all women lack control over their lives, we have

Out of our experience, we believe that it is important to continually assess how the activities of
the organization build its base and its power. All actions should be geared toward building the
organization as well as the importance of the issue. When a decision is made to do an action
because it is abstractly worthwhile, ways should be built in to expand the organization —— in
resources, finances, new constituencies, prestige, publicity (that will later add to our strength).

We also discovered that it is crucial to have full-time organizers for aistained activity. Initial
funding is also necessary to ensure the maintenance of the day-to-day operations of the organiza-
tion. Once off the grou nd, an organization can raise its own funds but the initial period is most
difficult. Lacking funds, the Action Committee has been forced to suspend operation.

NOTE: We offer training sessions for women interested in organizations such as the one described above.

III. CONSCIOUSNESS

Consciou sness-raising is a process by which women come to understand the nature of reality so

A that they may change it. One’s consciousness is related to one’s objective conditions. It is the
subtle interplay between the two (consciousness and conditions) which we emphasize in this section.

Consciousness is a word that has been used very loosely and has meant many things: the develop-
ment of a positive self-image, individual change and growth, new emotional and sexual relation-
ships with other women, or any of these coupled with the more general notion of a women’s
culture. It also means an understanding of how power is used in society and the experience of
changing that society. ‘

The conception of consciou sness-raising has been an extremely significant contribution of the
women’s movement. The whole notion of support and sisterhood has arisen as a result of women’s
realization of their prescribed roles and attitudes toward one another. Women have come both

to feel less isolated through consciousness-raising and to learn that women’s isolation is a

social phenomenon. We have come to understand more about the incredible problems which
women confront in daily life and to respect the solutions we have been forced to make for
axrvival. Consciousness has therefore been both a source of strength to women and a..source of
personal analysis. We have learned, for example, some sense of how power is used because we .
can see how it functions in individual relationships.

4 Consciousness and Objective Conditions

Consciousness is one’s awareness of her own ideas about ‘her situation and how the world functions.
What excites us about women’s liberation consciousness is that we think it is the most useful
description of reality for most women. ‘This is the key to a socialist feminist understanding of
consciou sness. We believe that we see a basic reality, and it is this true picture of how things

are and how they got that way that, primarily, we have to offer. We are not 81 ggesting one of
many ways that things might be working now —— we offer a description of the underlying rela-
tionships. This understanding makes us more effective. It is useful to women so that they can

act and change what they understand. Socialist feminist consciousness is of such value be-

causeit is useful, it istrue.

Of course there is a great interplay between objective conditions —- the various material and
social arrangements of our lives —— and consciou sness. With material changes such as children,
a mate, a home, one often becomes more circumspect because such a person mu st be able to

V provide for others (by law and social press: re). Or, a sister is not treated equitably (in job,

school, social situations) or denied rights she had come to expect and aiddenly the women’s
movement is no longer just “them.” In everyday ways, objective conditions affect our minds.

Change may also come through receiving information which touches our crucial values,(values
which may ordinarily function to maintain us where we are) and jolts us. It may be of women
dying_ from illegal abortions or of My Lai massacres. Information changes our consciousness
(somewhat ahead of our conditions) by putting our lives into a new context. Usually, we think,
this change happens in ways consistent with women’s pasts rather than through absolute, -abrupt
breaks from it. - ‘

21

Most often, a change in specific conditions and consciousness occur simultaneou sly, part of a
process developing over months, if not a lifetime. Our material lives change a_n_<_i our thoughts
about it and ourselves change. (Thus, Freud is so popular in relating ..all events to childhood be-
cause we are, of course, the same people or had the same origins as our ”old” self). One situa-
tion or series of situ ations may be a catalyst to a new perception of reality, but this is often a
culmination of other events. I

In our movement we think it is important to emphasize the obvious about consciousness. We
all have consciousness. We all have contradictions in our own “level” or “levels” of conscious-
ness. Certain factors of our lives may mean that we emphasize certain things we see to be true;
and- ignore, or deny, or just agree to live with others. Our movement needs to offer women
feasible alternatives. These new alternatives can help close the contradictions with which they
live. (The same may be said about ourselves).

Here it is important that what we offer is a view of reality. For example, women often cannot
see_ who their enemy is because he is not right on the scene. So, often people vent their anger on
a relatively powerless agent who is carrying out another’s will (e.g., the waitress) or cannot
function well in the conditions but who does not have the power (alone) to change (teacher,
mother). What we havethat makes us attractive, is that we see the roots. That is the meaning
of the word “radical.” — '

What Our Consciousness Has To Offer

So what does our conception of consciousness have to offer?It allows women to generalize from
their specific situation or series of situations to see patterns. This provides a picture of reality
that will allow them to function better because the pieces fit. But we can provide more than a
pattern: we identify causes for events. Only if we understand these causes will we know how

to change those" events (not repeat or be overwhelmed by them). It provides a systematic way to ,

develop our ideas from ideology to strategy, to program and tactics, because it identifies things
in relationto their importance in reaching our goals.

We must understand consciousness raising in relation to objective conditions. Women cannot have
“higher consciousness” by trying harder. There are real limitations on women. Just presenting

altematives does not often make them adequate or real to women. We mu st always relate to

the lives of women, in the concrete form. .. '

The most wonderful thing that a consciou sness-raising groupdoes is to help us seeethat problems
we once felt were personal are social. We must continue to see how-we are not so different from
most women. , We react to so many of the same, objective conditions (from the pill, economic job
scarcity, more youth in college, etc). This helps to keep things in perspective. For example,

it is not women’s liberation that is making problems for the nuclear family. In part, we are an
outgrowth of many of its problems. In part, we affect its future and the alternatives offered. So
there is the constant interplay of objective and subjective forces. Popularized women’s liberation
consciousness itself (as we all know) is not what causes social change.

22

Implications of Socialist Feminist Consciousness

We began our paper with a three-point guideline to strategy: 1) win real concrete reforms that
meet women’s needs; .2) give women a sense of their own power; 3) alter the relations of power. ‘
Our understanding of consciousness allows us to understand the real (root) needs of women,

and the ways in which our powerlessness affects us and gives us the desire to alter relations of
power.

It unites talk and action, constantly, describing a place for emphasizing each. It helps us set
priorities in terms of a concrete situ ation. (Thus we move away from abstractly “pure” issues,
but see each issue in a specific situation as one that may or may not demand our attention,
depending on how it relates to the lives of the women we are able to address and other strategic
considerations.) '

It also makes us fairly tolerant of what choices women make with their lives because we see how
bound up conscious decisions are with immediate situations. We have a great belief in ‘the al-
most infinite perfectability of people (given changes in social institutions and generations of
change in consciou sness)’. But we are cautious about the extent of personal perfection. We ‘
know no one can be liberated in this society, no matter what their consciousness. We are bound
in networks of limitations, immediate, specific and affecting our whole lives. '

Thus, consciousness is not abstract (though it may at any one point be unclear). It does not come
from an individual’s mind (though intellectual focus develops it). It is not necessarily reflected

in all personal actions of an individual, but is in social actions. A socialist feminist consciousness
is certainly not a natural or spontaneous process that will always happen when a group of women

. come together. As events move quickly to clarify social forces (as declarations of war, arrests,

economic hard -times, increased divorce rate, etc. often move events), so our consciousness is
clarified. Consciousness is a key to power, not only in our individual lives, but asaa social force
coming into its own and able to work on its own behalf. -

Many things have moved us to believe in women’s liberation. Talking to other women, we came
to realize our oppression by understanding the nature of our upbringing and of our lives as .
women. However, the changes we think will be most permanent in us are those made by par-
ticipating in a variety of activities, which, through our involvement, lead us to further under- _
standing and change. In the process of struggling to change our oppression, we begin to under-
stand both the specific forms of oppression and how they are related to one another.

We find that ideology guided only by reflection and discussion loses touch with reality ‘andis
not accepted by most women. Further, if our movement is to continue to expand and to move
forward to change our oppression as women, we mu st unite in a variety of activities Which will
build our power base. This in turn further develops our ideology and our understanding of the

"oppression of women.

23

Rap Groups

The method of consciou sness-raising used most frequently in the women’s movement has been the
rap group. The fact of group participation has been very important in changing women’s feelings
of isolation andvindividu ality. It has made it easier for us to understand the commonality of
interest among all women and what is necessary for change. The rap group format is one in which
everyone can contribute. Women can develop skills through understanding one another’s exper-
ience and dealing with the feelings that experience has created. But because consciousness and
conditions are intertwined, rap groups by themselves may be a dead end.

They can lead to a concentration on the improvement of ideas or one’s self with no eye toward
action. The purism of endless refining and redefining should not be mistaken for success. A good
analysis is not equal to action. Consciousness mu st not become an end in itself andan inhibitor

to seizing power. We are arguing neither for an uncritical turn of mind nor for the blissful ignorance
of all but the most narrow issues for the many. We are arguing that ideology mu st be integrated _
into the on-going lifeof the movement, and that this is best done in relation to and with testing,

by concrete changes resulting from actions. -

The rap group format may present another obstacle to the full development of the movement.
Discovering more and more examples of the effects of oppression’ on personal life can make the
task of social and personal change seem impossible. It is not difficult to reach the stage where
any work toward liberation seems irrelevant because early socialization practices cannot be
changed at once. Direct action aipplements rap groups. It provides opportunities to develop
and use new skills while‘ bringing about change. In this context, both rap groups and the develop-
ment of a socialist feminist analysis can proceed without the dangers of pu rism, or hopelessness.

The full development of women’s capabilities may be hampered by the very things in conscious-
ness-raising which at first seem to stimulate so mu ch growth. Women come together as sisters
on the basis of shared weakness and common problems. As women grow stronger, they them- '
selves may become frightened; sometimes the strength of one may divide the others from her.
Thus sisterhood may be lost as strength is gained.

24

IV. ISSUES

To make more concrete what we mean by socialist feminism, in this section we address a few
issues currently facing the women’s movement. For each of these issies we sketch what we
see as a socialist feminist context. The issues include independent women’s organizations,-
separatism, class organizing, cou nter-cu ltu re, lesbianism and vangu ards.

Independent Women’s Organizations

With the isolation and unorganized state of the women’s movement in a number of areas of the
country, many women who ‘might agree with ideas presented here are not presently working
as part of the independent women’s movement. Many women have filtered back into mixed
organizations or left the women’s movement, feeling that it rejected their skills.

Many women in mixed organizations who know they are for women’s liberation are caught in

I A the bind of either feeling guilty or hostile to the independent women’s movement (because

they feel that the movement condemns them for the choice they made). Our concerns, we expect,
areshared by many women in mixed organizations. We hope emphasizing the need for an in-
dependent women?s movement also helps develop ways for working with women and men in
mixed’ organh ations. '

We argue for developing organh ations and having organizational pride. This is a point many act
as if we had “overcome.” We argue for developing leaders and organizers responsible to such
organizations and through them to us in the movement. A few years ago it was not “in” to be
for organizers. Now leaders are “out.” We argue for a leadership that is responsible (again,

not so obvious to some) and useful to all of us. There areso many more points, but these
should provide some for argument and discussion.

All women’s fates are bound with that of the independent women’s movement. The movement’s
advances will concretely affect the lives of all other women. So too, individual women’s advances
and defeats, multiplied, will help shape the movement.

Women

Other reasons for women working with women have been said often, and still are true. .‘-'/'As with
any group with common interests, once those interests are identified, mu ch is shared and a
common perspective can be developed more readily. -It is easier to follow our own agenda. (At
least it lessens the likelihood of forgetting our own self-interest, which is so often submerged '
in other organizations and institutions). Of course, there are situations in which organizational
problems develop among women. We find women are just nicer to work with than men.

But the most basic argument for the independent women’s movement and organizations is that
the relations of power are unequal between women and men. As long as this is true, men will '
maintain control unless we have separate organizations to identify our needs and strengths.
Unequals, treated superficially as equals, will remain unequ als. This will be true unless women
come together on the basis of self -respect and separate organizations or caucuses.

25

We argue this partly in the interest of ever maintaining democratic and effective mixed organ-
izations. Women mu st be united. (in caucuses or separate women’s groups) to act on our own.
program. Otherwise, feeling our ineffectiveness, we will focus solely on attacking chauvinism
in organizations in a more and more personalized form. Without a strong caucus through which
women can be strong, they suffer ——- for example, being told they are “not political” or to
submerge their desire to fight on women’s concerns. Organizations also suffer, unable to pro-
ceed, havingto deal with internal problems of chau vinism at every step. Alternatively, they
will not deal with chau vinism at’ all. - - -

As socialist feminists, we argue for using the principles of power realities to guide democracy in
the organization. Women, in mixed organizations, would fight for and win the program they

wanted and know they had won it. This would begin to alter stru cmrally the relations of power -

in the mixed organization through common struggles in action. At the same time, we must re-
member our greatest enemies are those in or serving the. ruling class. ’

Working With Men

Objectively, men as’a group have vested interests opposed to those of women as a group. We
will, for example, cut into their jobs,challenge their position of comfort in the family, and take
personal power away from them. In the short-run, and in some ways, men are an enemy.

Why work with men at all? At many points, our interests and the interests of men are shared.
We commonly are united in our class position against such things as bad health care, insufficient
jobs, long hours and a powerlessness to affect priority decisions of our society.

Also, at points, sexism oppresses men. At these points, we can join in common struggle (e.g.,

they are trained to kill and ‘be killed, have tenderness drilled " out of them). E xen then, we must '

be able to organize separately so that we may come together.

In addition, women have historic and emotional bonds to men. When men and women come
together, it is out of the forces of social reality. Those social bonds are not destroyed by ideol-
ogical argument alone, but only when that social reality changes. In many cases, women have I
no real choice but marriage for survival, self-respect and warmth or love. We must look at the
lives of most women with fewer assumptions to discover what their real alternatives are and in
what is their happiness. Our perspective for our stmggle mu st_ not deny to these women the
sources of support they have found in the past (possibly through men or children).

There has sometimes been a weakening of the skills men have to offer to the movement, by
excessive guilt-tripping when men were told to give up their chauvinism. V True, the struggle
against chau vinism is a constant one. But chau vinism is all around us, constantly conditioning

us, and will be most effectively overcome through attacking its institutional roots, through

women united against it. We assume men (and we) will reflect chauvinism.

Too often our actions contradict our knowledge that originally brought-us together —— you
cannot overcome social problems with personal solutions. Thus a “position” on men should be
tactical: it varies with the real circumstances. A position on men is not our program. Sexism,
not men, is our politcal enemy. '

26

Separatism

Separatism has two meanings now in the movement. One is an ideological position arguing for
the separate development of men and women as fully as possible. Another is a tactical position,
arguing for separate organizations or life alternatives. We too argue for separate organizations
as a tactical decision. However, we argue against an ideological stance of separatism.

It is easy to see how the argument for the independent women’s movement couldglead to an
ideological argument for separatism (or how the two arguments are related). We do find strength

in separatist models. They show us concretely, how much we can gain from each other as women.

But for reasons previously said we do not believe separatism will solve our problems. Also, be-
cause ideological separatism does not have the social basis for attraction to the majority of
women, it has turned the struggle to one only within the movement. It moves toward more and

more purity, dividing us from our allies rather than uniting us on common ground and developing _

new common ground on which we can unite.

Ironically, this is much the same position that women in mixed organizations, without strong
caucuses, find themselves in. (That is, they turn their struggle to one within the organization --
fighting chau vinism —— not to program.) '

More basically, under certain circumstances, working with men is feasible, desirable and -
necessary to achieve our vision. Separatism as personal practice is a matter of choice‘, as

‘political position is illusory.

In the Name of Socialism

In the name of socialism, arguments have been made against the independent w_om,en’s move-
ment that did justice neither to feminism ._ nor to.socialism. Such arguments were oftenpart
of attempts to develop a class anlaysis of American society and saw women’s liberation as

a way to bring women into “the movement.” Many in the women’s movement have responded
negatively to the opportu nism implied in this using of women’s liberation. Although it is now
generally accepted that the fight against sexism is a main goal, there are still times when the
perspective of women’s liberation is challenged for legitimacy from this quarter.

Sometimes the challenge comes in the form that our primary fight must be against racism. '
Since the women’s movement is primarily white, this would mean we need to change struggles.
Raising the need to fight racism abstractly only reaffirms the “purity” of those who raise it.
We argue that struggles against racism will be meaningful on the basis of common self-interest
between black and white groups.

On many issies, whites and blacks may not be able to unite because our relations of power
are unequal. However, when social forces touch us commonly in some ways, we can build

programs to overcome social divisions. We must not deride the support we do have because
it does not inclu de all women right now.

At other times the argument is one of “giving up privilege.” To some extent this is another

‘ abstract purism. More importantly, this is not the image we want to project, nor will it be

successful. Women will join us because we win rights for them. No one joins in order to lose
something that they need. Rights will be established as they are fought for and won, not be-
cause those with privileges and power give them up. ‘

27

A third challenge to women’s liberation has postulated that only productive, paid working
(or, more narrowly, industrial working) women are a revolutionary force. There have been
some interesting but defensive responses to this showing that housework is productive. But

- we feel the argumentiand the defense have been too narrow. There are many contradictions

in society. Many different kinds of efforts, directed at many different targets, have included
so many more women in our movement. Of course, only employed workers can withhold
labor necessary for corporations to continue. But the general strike has never won any vic-
tories when it wasn’t combined with the general political mobilizationof all exploited classes.
While working for it, organizations of unpaid female labor and community organizing efforts
are building the social force we will need for that ‘revolution and revolutionizing future social
relations. '

Cou nter-cultu re

The women’s movement has brought forth a women’s culture with the development of women’s
poetry,»mu sic, art, history, women’s centers in the cu liural realm, and more practically oriented 4
skills such as auto repair and karate. This culture has provided a place for our creativity to be
expressed and enabled us to have more independence and self-confidence in areas where we have
been denied knowledge and opportu nity for expression in the past. ;

In addition, it has helped change many women’s lives. By providing an example of our vision,
women’s culture has helped develop a consciousness of how things could and should be better
(which helps us understand how we are oppressed now). ' ‘

At, the same time, feelings of frustration and isolation among other things have led many women
to seek only cultural alternatives —— personal lifestyles of liberation. Many women have chosen
to commit themselves entirely to development of a counter culture, dissociating themselves from
any action or organizations and frequently moving from the city to the country. For its personal
usefulness, we do not argue against it for those who can. But because of its limitation, we chal-

. lenge this as a political program.

As socialist feminists, we are helping build an extended women’s cultu re but also believe that it
should be available for all women. This will fully be possible only if we challenge institutions
which have power over us so that we might make it available to all. Our culture should be built
into the kind of society for which we are fighting. Currently, our culture is only available to a
small minority of women. Women must join together to struggle for power in order to bring
about our vision for all women.

Lesbianism

As the women’s movement developed, the gay movement, too, has grown. The gay movement
has moreforcefu lly brought the iswe of sexuality into the political arena with an analysis of the
oppression suffered by gay people in our society. Hating the conditions that stunt us and loving
women with whom we find new strength and new room to be weak, many of us come into lesbian
relationships. The gay liberation movement has brought people together collectively to bring an
end to‘ that oppression.’ Gay or straight lives are joined in that these struggles affect us as women.

28

Lesbians, as outcasts in society because they have stepped out of the prescribed roles for women,
have long been persecuted. In lesbians’ fights against sexism, all feminists stand to gain. Similarly,
since all lesbians are women, lesbians stand to gain from the struggles of feminists. We must join
together since our interests are intertwined.

This is not to deny the need for separatelesbian‘ groups or caucuses. Heterosexual bias is so strong
that it persists unless lesbians are organized separately to argue for a lesbian perspective. The
organizational form may be-caucuses or entirely separate groups; but where our interests are ulti-
mately the same, we should fight together for we can then be stronger and gain more power.

In some places, it appears that to be in the women’s movement, one mu st be gay. Sometimes, in
fact, it is argued that lesbians should be the vanguard of the women’s movement. We do not be-
lieve that power for women will be won by a primary focus (for the whole movement) on gayness.
We do not believe that a primary focus on any particular contradiction will lead to revolution.

Vangu ards

A vanguard has two common meanings. One. is a social force in the front of political struggle.
The other is a conscious leadership such as a political party provides for certain movements. At
different moments, strong forces in the movement have argued that certain groups should be the
vanguard (black, working, gay, etc.). Many of these arguments have been so oppressive that some
women have reacted against any idea of vanguard.

Yet-both functions for vangu ards are important at certain points. At times, our movement maybe
able to use and will need a vanguard, a leading and integrating force. Out of respect developed
through past leadership in struggles, a vanguard can synthesize a movement’s energies and help

to focus it. ‘ 4-

A vanguard of conscious, responsible leadership can help us develop the best use of the -resou rces
and the varying interests that we will attract. It does not further and fu.rther define the pure line
so that we attract fewer and fewer women. It does not win its respect by merely identifying it-
self as a leader. Many previous attempts at vanguard leadership failed, resting on guilt, rhetoric,
and self-imposition. ’

When we are truly strong enough, able to develop program from our independent sectors -—— in
women’s, gay, black, medical, educational, along geographic and work lines, overlapping and also
leaving spaces -—— then we will especially need an integrating force, a political party. It will in-
corporate and build on our priorities of socialist feminism because we will have shaped this van-
guard of the people’s liberation movement.

come to understand that that control can only be gained if we acttogether. We have come to
understand the specific needs of various groups of women and that different groups of women
have different ways in which they will fight for control over their own lives.

On the other hand, the women’s movement is currently divided. In most places it is broken
into small groups which are hard to find, hard to join, and hard to understand politically. At
the same time, conservative but organizationally clever entrepreneurs are attaching themselves
to the movement, and are beginning to determine the politics of large numbers of people. If
our movement is to survive, let alone ﬂourish, it is time to begin to organize for power. We
need to turn consciousness into action, choose priorities for our struggles and win. To do this
we need a strategy.

Our movement’s strategy must ‘grow from an understanding of the dynamics of power, with
the realization that those who have power have a vested interest in preserving it and the insti-
tutional forms which maintain it. Wresting control of the institutions which now oppress us
must be our central effort if women’s liberation is to achieve its goals. To reach out to most
women we must address their real needs and self-interests.

At this moment we think that it is important to argue for a strategy which will achieve the
following three things: 1) it must win reforms that will objectively improve women’s lives;

2) it must give women a sense of their own power, both. potentially and in reality; and 3) it
must alter existing relations of power. We argue here for socialist feminist organizations. We
are not arguing for any one specific organization but for the successful development of organ-
izations so that we may be able to learn from experience and bring our movement to its poten-
tial strength.

To make this argument we have written this paper. It has been designed as follows:

I. Socialist Feminism —— the concept and what it draws from each parent tradition. (pgs. 3-8)

II. Power —— the basis for power in this society, and our potential as women to gain power." (pgs.'9-14-)
An applied example of our strategy (pgs. 15-19)

III. Consciousness —— the importance of consciousness for the development of the women’s
movement, its limitations, and its place in a socialist feminist ideology. (pgs. 20-23)

IV. Current issues and questions facing our movement —— A socialist feminist apprcoach to
respond to and develop a context for our programs and concerns. (pgs. 24-28)

V. Organization -— the importance of building organizations for the women’s liberation move-
ment and some thoughts on organizationalforms. (pgs. 29-31)

The ideas that we are presenting are probably shared by many women in the movement, but
so far they have not been articulated or identified nationally. We are not organized partly
because our tolerance for different approaches, which our ideology encourages, makes it hard
to present a new or contrary position. Furthermore, certain factors in our movement work
against any kind of organization. Fears of elitism, the emphasis on personal alternatives and
strengths, fear of failure, disbelief in the possibility of winning, and even fear of winning, have
all played a role in our hesitancy_ '

We are addressing the paper now to women who share our ideas of socialist feminism, whether
they are women working in the movement, women who have never been active, women who

' have dropped out of the movement, or women working in mixed organizations. We hope that

it may provide a common language in which we can begin to talk, a context in which we can
meet to plan how to move. ‘

29

V. ORGANIZATIONAL NEEDS

In order to implement the strategy outlined in this paper, women’s liberation organizations are
needed. Through the strength of organizations, power can be won and the women who partici-

pate in them can gain a sense of their own power, a new self-respect, and a form for ensuring the
continuation of our movement. Only organizations can be the carrier of victories and the repository
of past successes.

Currently, the women’s liberation movement is broken into small groups in most places and thus
is hard to find, hard to join. Women’s liberation has not received recognition for even the few

victories we have won up to now, because there is no organized form to articulate our successes.
With organiz ation, women’s liberation can be in the arena along with other groups, struggling for

'..:ou_r own victories.

A$.15"};i.;:Wé.:fear that the women’s liberation movement may die. How can we survive -struggling for five,

tenor more years without organizations larger than ourselves to carry on’? More conservative
efforts will be able tovclaim our victories and attract women and resources unless we offer our
own organizational alternative. They will set the tone and the agenda for the movement and it
will no longer be ours.

As a movement, we have tried to understand why early feminists died out, sold out, or ‘lost out

in history. Concerned lest we repeat their mistakes, we have spent much time saying we should

expand our class and racial base. But perhaps a fate similar to the early feminists awaits us be-

- cause 1) we ha \e not concretely identified the interests of women and fought in common for real

gains on that interest; and 2) we have not developed organizations that would fight around that
interest. If we can do these things, we should be able to overcome the limitations of the earlier ’

'. women’s movement and actively recruit women to our movement.

A  i}5.»'

In this paper we are n_o_t arguing for any one specific organization, although in the future we would
hope a socialist feminist organization might be possible. Rather, we are arguing for an organizational
conception which would provide a f.-orm for working on the range of problems women face --
abortion, child care, health, job discrimination (i.e. “women’s issues”) as well as all issues which
affect our lives as women: taxes, housing, the war, welfare, etc. As those issues affect us, we

need forms that belong to us, through which we can respond and reach other women, and which

will inane that the solutions won reﬂect our interests.

The kind of organization we propose reflects our confidence in this strategy, with alliances
made on the basis of mutual self-interest and equal power among groups. Sometimes we have
participated in coalitions out of a sense of guilt or because we did not have our own work.

' Often in the women’s movement we face requests for our participation in everyone-else’s

program. In a socialist feminist organization, such alliances would only be made as they fit
into our own strategy. '

Structures Appropriate to Goals and Constituency

As women, we have had many bad experiences with organizations which impeded our personal
growth and political progress. Many women, reacting to the way they have been oppressed

by such structures, reject all explicit structures. We have found this unrealistic because the
structures survive implicitly and continue to affect us while we try to ignore them or live in
the spaces allowed us.

30

The form and structures for organization will vary depending on the type of group being formed.
For large, mass organizations, more structure is necessary in order to be able to integrate new
members, and provide varying levels of responsibility so that those with less time can also parti-
cipate. Such organizations, which are designed to achieve specific goals, need structures also in
order to facilitate the development of strategy and the implementation of decisions.

A reason for flexibility in organizational form is that women of different styles may feel com-
fortable in different situations. For example, those with a college background may see more
need for philosophical discussion. Some with jobs, family and other commitments may feel
greatest priority on starting and ending meetings on time. At times the decision may have to be
for the medium amount of comfort for everyone rather than the perfect atmosphere for any.

Within this context, there are several specific organizational ideas that we _
think are important in building organizations that serve us. We need specific forms clearly stated
through which women can see where leadership lies and how to develop it and make it accountable

‘to them. Below are structural elements we think are necessary for developing a mass organization:

spread our movement.

1. explicit structure and decision-making vehicle

2. levels of involvement to allow women to make more or less of a commitment depending
on interest and/ or time.

. leadership responsible to the organization

. work and involvement having some relationship to decisionmaking

C‘-U10-CD

. information dissemination throughout the organization.

Lea-dership,Elitism' and Democracy

There has been much discussion in the women’s movement about elitism and leadership. We have
been innovative and learned from experiments tried in different parts of the country. The prin-
ciple of “if you don’t know, learn; if you do know, teach” has helped many of us develop and

However, we have seen leadership patterns emerge in every situation. The solu tion is not to destroy
leadership. Rather, we mu st ‘make leaders responsible to organizations and to the members. In
addition, leadership can be an effective catalyst, a stimulator to advance the movement. Elitism
can be perpetuated only when we do not train each other in what we know.

We believe in political debate and in voting as a means of distinguishing between alternatives and
deciding how to proceed. Operating on the basis of consensus means necessarily that we cannot
move beyond the lowest common denominator of agreement. Our movement would never have
existed if we really followed notions of consensus in American society.- Moreover", consensus
often hides real disagreement because there is no structured way for opposition to have a voice,
as in a vote. Further, women in the minority on a particular issue can be oppressed by a con-
senais appraoch because their views cannot be seen as a clear, different position or alternat «lye.
Such a minority position may be forced into agreement with the majority.

’ We believe political debate is cnicial for maintaining the viability of our movement. We can have

political debate without endangering our strong feeling of sisterhood for each other. Sometimes
we will win and at other times we will lose; but political debate and struggle provides stimulation
and challenges us to develop our ideas and positions.

Conflicting viewpoints, in fact, are healthy in any organization and should not be submerged be-
cause of a fear of difference. But for debate to be worthwhile, it needs to be tied to clear function
within the organization. While engaging in that debate, we mu st continue to be clear in identifying
the real enemy we are fighting. We can structure debate within the organization so it helps

us learn, but it is not our sole function. i ‘

CONCLUSION

To summarize, we have argued for a strategy toward building socialism and feminism for this
specific time in history when we have strength in our sense of responsibility to women and yet
weakness in our isolated situations. This strategy assumes we want to reach most women and‘
to do that we mu st understand and build on their real self-interests. We mu st develop winning
programs and now emphasize direct action. We have argued three points in each part of this
paper, which define our strategy: 1) win reforms which really improve women’s lives, 2) give
women a sense of their own power through organization,«3) alter the relations of ‘power. The
issie of building and seizing power is the crucial one in our real situation now. Ounconscious-'
ness of reality and our vision of what relations we would like to see between people is what

, guides efforts, attracts people to us and helps define what we mean by winning.

So much of this is obvious, many may ask, “so what’s new‘? ” To this we have -two kinds of
answers. One answer is that precisely because we think it obvious, we wrote the paper. We
do believe, as we said, that we are a majority of the movement, and that as our strategy re‘;

‘fleets reality, we will (in the course of time) attract a majority of women to our po‘si,t_ion. Still

restating the obvious clarifies where we are, where we have come from and how far we have yet
to go. Without a strategic conception, the women’s movement has become less clear in its
mission and fervor. We hope to reinforce and help each other identify what may have once’
appeared as common sense (before so many splits and diversions altered our common sense of
relating to the needs of women).

But there is another answer to thecommon senseness of what we have done. Common sense is
not always too common. We draw attention to some few points of significance. We hope our
ideas will not be just accepted or rejected but discussed for how they challenge common. past
practice. We argue for the primacy of self-interest, so often lost in discussion of idlology. Our
ideology mu st guide us,- but also must be guided.by the realities shaping_our lives.

We have learned a great deal in the last few years, but because we had» no. structure on which to’?
build, we have lost where we could have gained in experience and power. This paper reflects
both ou r frustration and our commitment to the development of a women’s movement struggling
toward the realization of a socialist feminist vision. We have written this paper so sisters

who belicrve as we do may come forward and join us. '

Primarily, we argue for an aggressive and audacious perspective. It is one that our movement
began with when we thought we were the newest and hottest thing going. Now,’ we have _
found roots. We will need strategy, organization and so many steps along the way. But we
must take the offensive again, and this time fight a long battle — — worth it because we
believe we can win.

I. SOCIALIST FEMINISM

We choose to identify ourselves with the heritage and future of feminism and socialism in

our struggle for revolution. From feminism we have learned the fullness of our own potential
as women, the strength of women. We have seen our common self-interest with other women
and our common oppression. Having found these real bonds as women, we realize we can rely
on eachother as we fight for liberation. Feminism has moved us to see more concretely what
becomes of people shaped by social conditions they do not control. We find our love and hate
focused through our feminism —— love for other wornenbound by the same conditions, hate
for the oppression that binds us. A great strength we find in feminism is the reaffirmation of
human values, ideals of sisterhood: taking care of people, being sensitive to people’s needs and
developing potential.

From feminism we have come to understand an institutionalized system of oppression based on
the domination of men.over women: sexism. Its contradictions are based on the hostile social
relations set into force by this domination. This antagonism can be mediated by the culture
and the ﬂexibility of the social institutions so that in certain times and places it seems to be a"
stable relationship. But the antagonisms cannot be eliminated and will break out to the surface
until there is no longer a system of domination.

But we share a particular conception of feminism that is socialist. It is one that focuses on how
power has been denied women because of their class position. We see capitalism as an institu-
tionalized form of oppression based on _profit for private owners of publicly-worked-for
wealth." It sets into motion hostile social relations in classes. Those classes too have their re-
lations mediated through the culture and institutions. Thus alliances and divisions appear with-
in and between classes at times clouding theintensity or clarity of their contradiction. But

the basic hostile nature of class relations will be presentuntil there is no longer a minority.

owning the productive resources and getting wealthyfrom the paid and unpaid labor of the rest.

We share the socialist vision of a humanist world made possible through a redistribution of
wealth and an end to the distinction between the ruling class and those who are ruled.

We have come to understand that only through an organized collective response -can we fight
such a system. Sisterhood thus also means to us a struggle for real power over our own lives
and the lives of our sisters. “Our personal relations and our political fight merge together and
create our sense of feminism. Through the concept of sisterhood, women have tried to be
responsive to the needs of all women rather than a selected few, and to support, criticize and
encourage other women rather than competing with them. -

Our-Vision -— Socialist Feminism is Desirable and Not Possible Under the Existing System

The following would be among the things we envision in the new order, part
of everyday life for all people:

— free, humane, competent medical care with an emphasis on preventive medicine,-under
the service of community organizations V

— peoples’ control over their own bodies —— i.e., access to safe, free birth control, abor-
tion sterilization, free from coercion or social sti ma '
9

— attractive, comfortable housing designed to allow for private and collective living

— varied, nutritious, abundant diet

— social respect for the work people do, understanding that all jobs can be made socially necessary

and important

— democratic councils through which all people control the decisions which most directly
affect their lives on the job, inthe home, and community

— scientific resources geared toward the improvement of life for all, rather than conquest
and destruction through military and police aggression

— varied, quality consumer products to meet our needs

— an end of housework as private, unpaid labor

— redefinition of jobs, with adequate training to prepare people for jobsof their choice;

rotation of jobs to meet the life cycle needs of those working at them, as well as those ‘
receiving the services. ' A

+ political and civil liberties which would encourage the participation of all people in the
political life of the country

— disarming of and community control of police

—— social responsibility for the raising of children and free client-controlled childcare avail-
able on a 24-hour basis” to accommodate the needs of those who use it and work in it

— free, public quality education integrated with work and community activitiesifor people
of all ages '

—— freedom to define social and sexual relationships

— a popular culture which enhances rather than degrades one’s self respect and respect for
others '

— support for internal development and self-determination for countries around the world

We outline this vision to be more concrete about what a socialist feminist society might mean
or try to be. This vision of society is in direct opposition to the present one which is based on
the domination of the few over the many through sex, race and class. While there are con-
cessions that it can make, the present form would not or could not adjust to the kind of people-
oriented society outlined above.

' Contradictions‘ —— An Alternative Is Necessary

Socialist feminism is not only desirable but it is also necessary because the current system of
capitalism is not stable and cannot last in its present form. However, this does not mean that C
the society will inevitably become socialist. A fascist or barbaric form is also an alternative.-
The system that will replace capitalism will be determined by the orientation and power of

_ groups fighting for alternatives. Hence, we must struggle to bring our vision of socialist femv

inism to fruition.

Contradictions are phenomena necessary to maintain the system but by their own internal

logic produce forces destructive to it. A knowledge of them helps explain the chaos around us,
giving a stable context to understand the historically changing process we are in. Such an under-
standing also helps us pick out weak spots of the process, points for defense and attack. Examples
of these contradictions are all around us in varying degrees of severity. Sexism and capitalism
reinforce one another, shape each other and have shaped us.

Contradictions in Our Power

" Any analysis of the distribution of power and its effect on society’s institutions must recognize

the historical context of our oppression. Our oppression is different from that of our sisters

at the turn of the century who had no legal rights, were confined to the home, and ,_bore children
from maturity to death. Thus, what is liberating at one time may be a factor of oppression at
another. For example, women were denied their own sexuality because of social attitudes,
inadequate birth oontrol, the shelter of the family, women’s private role in the economy, and
the lack .of knowledge about their bodies. The development of a more advanced technology
(the pill and machines) and education objectively gave more freedom to "our sisters. At the
same time, these developments also made possible new forms for the oppression of women, in-
creased sexual objectification and abuse.

In the realm of women and work, legislation which protected women was of great benefit in
easing their burden. Currently, however, in the name of easing our burden, such legislation is
used to deny women equal" opportunity. Of course, women and all people have a right to safe
and good working conditions; but these need to be fought for all workers.

Understanding our changing history helps us to avoid stereotyping our opposition or own own
notions of what liberation means. The development of a strategy makes it clear that technologi-
cal advances, legislative changes or educational developments are not good or bad in themselves.
When we know the context in which any specific change occurs, we can judge the value of that
change for our goals. ‘

We have learned from history that, in fact, what is progressive for the system as a whole is also
the seeds for its destruction. For example, increasing the availability of jobs for women and
encouraging talented women to enter the labor__force helps employers and strengthens capital-’
ism but at the same time gives women an opportunity to come together physically'and unionize
as a collective force for change. Other women, seeing this, will raise their expectations and
demands on the system for a larger share than it can offer all.

Knowing that these contradictions are the reality in which we live, we can fight that other- V
wise supposed “monolith” of control at its weak points and gain strength for ourselves. If our
analysis is correct, on the basis of those contradictions, women and other powerless people will
find concrete bases for unity to struggle in their self-interest. Now we see severe contradictions
andpossibilities for fights for structural changes on isares of childcare (for adequate care and com-
mu nity control), inclusion in the political system, jobs and working conditionsfor workers’ con-
trol, etc. ‘ ‘

Multi-Level Contradictions

Many analyses_ have identified various institutions (e.g., the family or sexual relations) as the
crucial contradiction of sexism. However, these contradictions reflect the social relations of a
sexist society, or institutions in which sexism occurs. Eliminating these “prime factors” would
neither eliminate sexism nor necessarily create supportive alternatives for women. As the factory A
may be the locus for capitalist exploitation, it is not the basis of that exploitation. Private
ownership and profit is the basis, giving rise to the class relations. Similarly, the family is a
crucial locus of sexist oppression but it is not the basis of that exploitation. Control by men

over women and the relegation of women to secondary roles is the basis of sexism, giving rise

to a sexist society.

We do not find helpful the constant cry that before we organize, we need to develop a complete
theory of the nature of our oppression or find the prime’ contradiction of our oppression (as if

there is just one). Some analyses, in fact, have led us only to further’ inaction with the rationale
of not having the total picture. _ ’ C

Every ‘institution oppresses women as long as the society is based on the oppression of women.
Our struggle against sexism is against those institutions, social relations and ideas which divide
women and keep them powerless, and subservient to men. At different periods our oppression,
may be greater in one area than another, and this should direct our struggle.

The social relations of society —— its institutions, culture and ideology —— grow out of this system.
But these ideas take on a life of their own, no longer dependent onior necessary to the economic ,
base. In fact, they can develop in contradiction to that base. So, for example, racism or sexism
serve much more than narrow economic function. Thus, what is important is not just redistri- A
bution of goods but a change in authority, control and ideas. Clearly, all elements of a class
society are not reflections of the economic relations; however, in the last instance (at the point.
where contradictions become revolutionary in dimension) economic relations are the crucial

link.

Contradictions at every level of society inﬂuence each other and within each level (economic,

social, ideological) they are mirrored and overdetermined. That is, the pace at which contra-

dictions develop is complex, sometimes reinforcing, sometimes cancelling each other. Thus,

long range planning and a carefully worked out strategy are needed to continually respond to

the complexity of the contradictions in American society. But we reflect in our theory that there

are contradictions and that an alternative system is 1) desirable and not possible now, and 2) necessary
to provide a true end to hostilities (between classes, sexes, races, nations).

We find it futile to argue which is more primary —_-—- capitalism or sexism. We are oppressed by
both. As they are systems united against our interests, so our struggle is against both. This
understanding implies more than women’s caucuses in a “movement” organization. What we

as socialist feminists need are organizations which can work for our particular vision, our self-
interest in a way thatlwill guarantee the combined fight against sexism and capitalism. At

times thiswill mean independent organizations, at other times joint activity recognizing specific
situations and general conditions.

The American Context of the Contradictions

The forms of oppression we face are filtered through the unique conditions of the American
situation. We have a very heterogeneous working class, more diversified by ethnic background,
race and job status than most other countries. This gives us many different strengths but also
many internal divisions. Also, we have a heritage of slavery with an oppressed black and min-
ority population. This now is as basicto the society as is sexism and is linked with it.

In addition, the power of the ruling class is widespread and disseminated through every aspect

of the society. This makes for a difficult enemy —— hard to isolate, focus on_ at its root, and

hold accountable while its ideas filter into our minds. As the leading world imperialist power,

our national struggle must consider. strategic relationships linking our struggle with those around
the world. Also, we live in a society with relative material comfort. This means that what we have
to offer must not be just economic solutions. The question of quality‘ of life is not only to be

- _ raised but also ideas for a new social order.

We also are ‘cut off from our history of left struggle since the destruction of the left in_ the fifties.
To our great lack this has sometimes denied us a sense of long-term struggle and strategy develop-
ment. One of our overriding responsibilities at this particular historical period is to develop

a strategy which will both call into question the validity of current economic and social relations
and at .the same time make socialist feminism a meaningful possibility. This will hot occur except

as more and more people gain the political experience necessary to develop a concrete under-
standingof the viability of our vision.

Allele of Ideology in the Development of Strategy

 

a'l'he'preceding section outlines our ideology —— socialist feminism. It is this ideology which
guides the development of our strategy and tactics, sets our priorities, and gives us an overall
focus for our work. The key ideological understanding is that all issues are political, are based
on power, and that our actions have political implications. A

We develop thisideology both out of practice and in reading and discussion -—- matching
theory to the real world. To an extent ideology plays the role of consciousness —— it is a
clear picture of reality which strengthens our ability to communicate and argue for our posi-
tion. Stated explicitly, ideology helps provide links for women, in seeing how one struggle is
related to others. Some individuals, aware of many social contradictions, may make an in-
tellectual leap —— understand the parts as a whole through a socialist feminist ideology.

Most people are guided by an ideology. Our own particular relationship to ideology has

two special functions. First, it provides ideas which guide us, defining the framework and
reason for our actions. Second, it defines our view of the world concretely, thus providing

a system of analysis through which women can understand socialist feminism as a world view.

The ideological underpinnings for a socialist feminist strategy are laid out here and should be
evident in the paper. But this paper is designed primarily to propose a strategy. It flows from
and should help us -define our ideology evenvbetter in the future; but it is a different under-
taking -——— determining what we shouldido NOW. —

This is one reason we feel confident in describing a strategy when we do not have the full
blueprint for how revolution will occur. One is not developed full blown and then the other ‘
becomes possible. - - « W '

Neither is this an attempt at overall strategy. Overall strategy helps us tosee the way to seizure
of state power and the critical break from the past, developing new institutions and a new social
order based on equality of-people and redistribution of wealth and resources. We can only-- de-
velop an understanding of exactly how.this will occur as we gain experience in building our’ .
movement. Continually moving from political work to further theoretical development and
back to political work is a necessity. Revolution has several stages and it" is important to have
an understanding of the historical period we are in. W

Therefore, given the ideology presented here, we have developed the following priorities for
this particular point in time: i y ' ‘V _ A
1) Weumust reach most women. We must work toward building a majority movement.

Our analysis tells us this is possible if we proceed in the right way. ’ ’

W 2) We must present intermediate goals that are realizable as well as
desirable to show the necessity and possibility of organizing

3) We must develop‘ collective actions. , D
Now the crucial need is to weaken‘ the power of the ruling class, give women a sense of their own A
power, and improve our lives so that we are welded together as a force prepared tostruggle together.

Concern with these issues is the basis for the socialist feminist strategy we outline in the next sections.
