Henry Winston, National Chairman of the
Communist Party, visited Angela Davis in the
New York Women’s House of Detention the
evening of Dec. 7, 1970. It was the first time
that the two Communists had met face to
face. Winston, a victim of the Smith Act
frameup of Communist leaders, had also
been a political prisoner in U.S. jails. He
lost his sight as a result of medical neglect
while in prison. My interview with h.im fol-
lows.

Q. How would you describe this ﬁrst meeting you
had with Angela Davis?

A. I think it is signiﬁcant that a Black woman from
Birmingham, Alabama, whose ﬁght against racism led
her to the Communist party, and myself, a Bl-ack man
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, whose search also led

/ ~»' . y.~.:.«d;1n':2&.4lyZ2'm2x&ﬁWimAA1s.a..rz.. , _ 

to the Communist Party, should meet for the ﬁrst time
in an American jail.

Despite the bitter cold of the night, my heart was
warm in anticipation of meeting this courageous wo-
man. I had just returned from a journey to North
Korea, where the ﬁght to free Angela Davis had al-
ready spread. I

A metal gate clanked open as I and the crowd of
people around me were us-hered into an area divided
into individual telephone-booth-like compartments. (1
was to communicate with Angela by means of a tele-

phone that connected us with each other through a

solid glass partition. I waited eagerly against the
cold glass divider and listened for the voice of Angela
over the telephone.

Twenty minutes passed before her voice greeted me
over the connecting telephone. She explained the reason
for her delay. She had been embroiled with her guards
over the issue of equal treatment. While every other
prisoner‘ came to the visiting sector wearing their
street clothes, the guards demanded that she wear her
prison uniform. She told me that this was just another
of the countless ways that the prison olﬁcials used

 

/

to se-parate her A from the other prisoners, trying to
isolate and segregate her from the others.

“They do everything to harass me and make me
uncomfortable. They refuse anything I ask for,” she
told me.

A I heartily endorsed her efforts to beat back their
attempts to segregate and stigmatize her.

A Q. Did she describe her relations with other prison-
ers?

A. Yes, ,indeed. She told me that every measure
‘taken by the prison authorities to drive a wedge be-
tween her and the other prisoners had failed. Even

when she was kept in solitary conﬁnement ways were

devised to maintain communication with the ‘other
prisoners. She related that those prisoners with whom

_ she struck up an especially close relationship were

‘quickly removed to other parts of the prison. Despite
this kind of separation messages were passed back
‘and forth between Angela and her fellow prisoners.

 Q. How did her morale appear to you?

A. It couldn’t have been higher. She said that she
received at least 100 letters a day. Some days the

number was as l-arge as 400 letters. She said the let-
ters not only came from all sections of t-he U.S. but

from all the socialist countries, from Asia, Europe,
Africa and Latin America.

‘In my lifetime I can remember no case of a political
prisoner receiving the support that Angela Davis has
received. A

Angela was especially uplifted by the reception given
her mother, who lives in Birmingham, when she was
brought to the Harlem Y.W.C.A. by Black Women
for the Freedom of Angela Davis. She said that the
hundreds of women who greeted her mother had im-
parted such a sense of solidarity and determination
that the worry and apprehension that had burdened
her mother was lifted. A

She said that her mother reports the same kind of

support from every section of the Black community
in city after city that she has -had occasion to visit
since her reception in Harlem.

Angela was especially moved by the demonstrations‘

of support for her and other political prisoners in
communities across the south, and especially in Birm-
ingham, where Black -and white were brought together

’ in common cause.

She paused a moment before stating in an emotion-
charged voi-ce, “T-he pigs will rue the day they ever
attempted this.” Every day, she said, she becomes
more‘ steeled against the attempts to harass and isolate
her. Her belief that this frame-up will be exposed and
defeated is unshakeable.

Suddenly, Angela told me that the lights were
ﬂickering off and on to signal‘ the end of the time
we could have toget-her. However, she insisted that I
return to visit her the next evening.

Before leaving, I pressed a book opened to the ﬂy-
leaf to the glass for Angela to read. It was a personal
dedication that I had written to Angela expressing my
warm affection for her and my profound respect for
the commitment she had made to the people and to
Marxism-Leninism. The inscription read through the
prison window had to suﬂice forthe time. being until

I could place the book in her hands. It was a copy

\

of Howard Selsam’s “Dynamics of Social Change: a V
Reader in Marxist Social Science.”

Angela said she eagerly looked forward to reading
the book. i

I parted in anticipation of our next visit that was
to come the following night. i

Q. How did Angela Davis describe conditions in
the prison?

A. During my next visit with her she told me how
ﬁlthy the place was._ One woman found a mouse tail
in her oatmeal. Angela found a roach in her coffee
one morning at breakfast. She is kept awake at night
by the sounds of mice crawling in the walls. Fre-
quently she ﬁnds roaches caught in her comb after
she h-as run the comb through her hair. Medical
service is atrocious, she reported. She said, “You know

about that since you were blinded in prison for lack

of -medical treatment.”

Aside from the general unsanitary and vermin—ridden
conditions, she said what bothered her the most was

  

 

 

 

the so-called economy measure which caused the lights
to be shut oﬂ? at 9 p.m. Always a voracious reader, she
keenly misses the opportunity to read. She even asked
for a ﬂashlight to read by. That request was denied
repeatedly.

Her knowledge of the special way the U.S. penal

system oppresses Black and Puerto Rican people has
been reinforced over and ..,over again by the situation

in the Women’s House of Detention. Most of the in-
mates there are Black and Puerto Rican. They have
been denied both bail and the opportunity to speedy
court appearances in addition to the main fact that
most of their so-called offenses are acts of survival
taken to break the cages of poverty and discrimina-
tion that this society has put them in. T

Q. How has the attempted frame-up affected her
family and friends?

A. She told me -that friends and neighbors she
hasn’t seen since she was a child have been visited
by the F.B.l. “While they were hunting me down,”
she said, “they would show my picture around, saying

that I was wanted for all sorts of crimes. All this
harassment of my family and friends, including the
dragnet and the lies of Nixon, Hoover, Reagan, and
Mitchell have not shaken their faith in my innocence.”

She recalled how as a little girl in Birmingham she
had known that the family and friends of hunted Com-
munists, like James Jackson, had fended off the fed-
eral bloodhounds as they roamed the south in the
1950’s searching for victims of the Smith Act hysteria.

We ended our visit on the note that just as the
big frame—ups of the 1950’s were exposed and broken
———so today the frame—up of Angela Davis and other
political prisoners -would be defeated by an even
stronger movement of the people.

As I made ‘my way out of the prison that night
Ange1a’s parting words, “Right on!” found an echo
inside me.

Q. Was that your last visit with Angela Davis?

A. Yes it was. I was scheduled to visit her again

,on Tuesday evening, Dec. 22. However we never met

that evening since Angela was extradited to California
the night before.

I am anxious to see her again and I will visit with
her in California to bring her news of the struggle
to win her freedom.

Q. How do you view the frame-up of Angela Davis
in the long history of political persecution in the U.S.?

A. In the case of the Rosenbergs this country saw
an example of courage and dedication to principle rare
in U.S. history. They were the victims of rampant
McCarthyism. The guiding spirit of that wave of re-
pression was -anti-Sovietism and anti—Communism. The
show trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg saw the high-
water mark of the drive of the U.S. ruling class to
whip up cold war hysteria and to dismantle the Black
Liberation movement, the 1-abor movement and the
Communist Party. They sought to behead every form
of struggle by the American people for a better and
more human society. During )that period both the
Black Liberation movement and the 1-abor movement
were put on the defensive.

 

Today the attem-pt to “get Angela Davis” by the
Nixon-Reagan-Rockefeller forces in this country is a
foredoomed plan to push the mass movements of the
people back into the d-ark night of MoCart-hyism. This
plan will not work.

Every day we see new signs that the leading sections
of the Black Liberation movement, the labor move-
ment, the peace movement, the student movement see
the "attack on Angela Davis as an attack on them.

Angela Davis was chosen for this frame-up because

in this one courageous woman they had the chance to
strike -at the upsurge of Black Americans in the com-

munity and in the ranks of labor, the rising tide of
dissent on the campuses, the growing outcry for peace
and radical social change.

However, as Angela put it, “they will rue the day
th-at‘ they attempted this.” For the American people
will not let Angela Davis be isolated and sacriﬁced.

We will turn into its ‘opposite this campaign to
silence and crush Angela and the causes which she
represents.

T-he ﬁght for freedom is a new rallying cry of pro-
gressive America, Black and white, in motion. 4 Out of

 

 

this successful struggle will come a new level of unity

between the various sectors of struggling America such

as the country has never seen.

Not only will we return Angela safely to our ranks,
but she shall resume a place of leadership in a move-
ment that she will ﬁnd transformed in the crucible of
the struggle to free her and other political prisoners.

For in freeing Angela the new-found strength of
progressive America won’t be relaxed until every po-
litical prisoner is free. The prison doors will also be
opened for Bobby Seale, Ericka Huggins and all the
others who today are held in political captivity.
