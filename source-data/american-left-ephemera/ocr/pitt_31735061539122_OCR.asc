though a small group was active in Vienna. In the April local
elections the Communists polled only 16,119 votes, which showed
it to be an insigniﬁcant faction.

"Austrian Anti-Semiﬁsm _
The anti-Semitism of many of the old aristocrats emerged

' in a dramatic way nine years ago. A Zionist World Congress

met in Vienna late in August, 1925, and for two days before
the opening session the anti-Semitic Fascists attacked Jews and
destroyed Jewish shops. Cafes, hotels and shops owned by Jews
on the Ringstrasse were barricaded and 273 rioters were ar-
rested. It was estimated that the damage exceeded $4,000,000.
It required a small army of police to protect the congress
against assault. Similar riots took place in the summer of 1927.
The Nationalist organization composed of university students
and professors introduced a number of regulations against
Jewish students. Socialist students protested against the dis-
criminations and there were conﬂicts on the university grounds.
Scores were injured. The Socialist Mayor ordered the police to
enter the university grounds to protect the Jewish students. It
was the ﬁrst time that police ‘had ever been ordered to enter
the grounds, as the students were expected. to enforce their own
discipline. ' .

Again in November, 1928, anti—Jewish demonstrations
occurred at the University of Vienna -on the tenth anniversary
of the founding of the republic. Groups of Clerical students,
favoring the return of the monarchy, attacked Jewish students,
shouting “Down with the Jews! Down with the Jewish Repub-
lic! Down with the Socialist Republic!”

When Dollfuss became Chancellor in May, 1932, he was
supported by a bloc in which the Fascists had a majority of
one vote, and he was frankly anti-Semitic at that time. He told
the Christian Socials that “anti-Semitism is a most popular
slogan,” but after the rise of Hitler and the outrages against
Jews in Germany Dollfuss refrained from expressing his anti-
Semitic views.

The Lackey: of Fascism

The Heimwehr Fascists -became more active and numerous
late in 1928 and early in 1929. In May of the latter year Chan-
cellor Streeruwitz formed a ministry and presented his pro-
-gram to a crowded Chamber. Karl Renner, former Socialist
Chancellor, attacked Mgr. Seipel, Clerical Chancellor who had
resignedrin April, for having rejected the Socialist offer to dis-

arm all the irregular armed forces of both parties. A deputation
of Socialist members of Parliament urged the Government to ‘

prohibit further Heimwehr parades, which had brought con-
10 ‘

 

ﬂicts in Lower Austria, while workers in this region warned
that they would barricade the roads against any more Fascist
marches.

The Socialist efforts to disband the armed organizations were
without results, but on May 6 Karl Seitz, Socialist Mayor of
Vienna, and Governor of Vienna Province, ordered the police
to prevent parades of uniformed private armies until further
notice. Vice Chancellor Schumy, however, -informed Mayor
Seitz that his order was without effect ‘_‘if the police had previ-
ously been notiﬁed.” The. “Arbeiter Zeitung,” Socialist daily,

’ denounced the Chancellor and the Government as “lackeys of

Fascism.” It was obvious that the Federal Goverment would
agree to no proposal that involved the disarming of the Fascists.

‘Despite a heavy rain on May 12, sixteen parades of Socialists
in uniform, one of the Heimwehr, and three of Christian So-
cials, without uniforms, took place in Vienna. .No less than
50,000 Socialists and 2,000 of the Heimwehr were in these
demonstrations.

Meantime the War Minister, Karl Vaugoin, had for eight
years been slowly changing the personnel of the army. Socialists
in Parliament demanded the resignation of Vaugoin, who was
replacing Socialist soldiers by conservatives and depriving the
soldiers of the right of electing their officers. By the year 1929
the councils had been transformed into what was called “sol-
diers’ trustees” and in that year 70 per cent of the vote was
polled for trustees ‘satisfactory to Vaugoin. The Socialists ac-
cused Vaugoin of creating a reactionary army, adding that
recruits were not accepted unless they had letters from parish
priests. It was announced that soldiers in active service would
be deprived of the sufrage. The transformation of the army and
the refusal of the Government to consider disbanding private
armed forces showed the trend of reaction. The Socialists were
becoming aware of the fact that the workers would eventually
have to face the reaction in a “ﬁnal conﬂict.”

Political Parties
The political parties in recent years have included the Chris-

tian (Catholic) “Socials,” who represent the big capitalists and

have a large following among the ‘Catholic peasants. It, of
course, is not a Socialist party. The Heimatbund is the party
organization of the Heimwehr Fascists, which also has big busi-
ness and banking backers. The National Socialist, or Nazi, party
is the Fascist organization that seeks to bring Austria under
the yoke of Hitler Fascism. The Social Democratic Party rep-
resented the working masses and was by far the strongest single

party in Austria.
A word regarding Prince Ernest Ruediger von Starhemberg,
ll

leader of the Fascist terrorists. He was an officer in the Aus-

trian army in the World War, although only 19 years old when

 

it ended. He took part in the Hitler beer saloon “put-sch” in

Munich in November, 1923, but later broke with the German
Nazi chief. He organized the Heimwehr Fascists several years
ago, together with other clerical reactionaries, and made one
of his numerous family castles its munition and arms center.
On a number of occasions he was censure-d by the authorities
for his violent activities, and in 1929 his castle was raided and
arms were seized. In 1931, he was ﬁned for slandering Vice
Chancellor Schober, and in September of that year he par-
ticipated in the attempted Fascist revolution with Walter Pfrie-
mer in Styria and was jailed for a time. It was reported in 1932
that he was a bankrupt from ﬁnancing the Heimwehr, and an-
other report declared that he had been ﬁnanced by Hungarian
aristocrats who obtained «money from German capitalists. He
is a blatant and insufferable egoist strutting with the pomp and
arrogance of his aristocratic elders, a ﬁt tool to do the dirty
work of -Chancellor Dollfuss.

The Last General Election

The crisis of capitalism and the need of the workers day and
night to be ready for attacks of the Heimwehr would have
worn out a Labor movement less informed and disciplined than
the Austrian. Vienna was a center of Heimwehr intrigue and
the Socialist cities in other provinces were also apprehensive of
a conﬂict that would put the movement to the supreme test.
Another election showed the masses holding their ground.

In the-—la‘st general election in November, 1930, the Socialists
polled a slight increase and won one additional seat in Parlia-
ment. The Christian Social Party’s representation fell from
73 to 66. This is the party of Chancellor Dollfuss. As Dollfuss
on the eve of the February rising for the ﬁrst time began to
refer to the Socialists as “Bolshevists” it is worth while to cite
the ﬁgures of the Communist vote in this last election held in
the republic. The Communists polled 21,004 votes in the whole
of Austria, or 0.5.7 per cent of the total. They did not have a
single seat in Parliament, in any Provincial Diet, or in the
Municipal Council of Vienna! So much for the “Bolshevist
menace” in Austria.

However, some of the Austrian reactionaries asserted that
official Communism was weak in Austria because the Social
Democratic Party was practically’ a Bolshevist party. The fact
is that Stalin and his associates in Moscow placed the Austrian
Social Democratic Party in the same sack with all other Social-
ist parties as an “agent of the bourgeoisie.” Not even Dollfuss
l2

 

ever tarred the Austrian Socialists with the Bolshevik pitch till
he found it necessary to use this phrase for export purposes,
that is, to inﬂuence opinion in other countries.

The Fourth Congress of the Labor and Socialist Interna-
tioal was held in Vienna in July, 1931, and the report of the
party, besides citing the results of the election in November,
1930, gave some idea of the increasing dangers that faced the
Austrian workers.

“The massacre of July 15, 1927, it said, “proved to the
bourgeoisie that even the new republican machinery of the State
functioned against the working class. Thanks to this their self-
conﬁdence increased enormously. In the country where capital
was ‘made of the events of July without reserve, the Fascist
Heimwehr movement grew. This movement openly enjoyed
the support of the state machinery, and: thanks ot the patronage
of the leader of the reaction, the Federal Chancellor Dr. Seipel
of the Christian Social Party, it was well supplied ﬁnancially
by the employers’ organizations. In the works of the Alpine
Mining Company in upper Styria, the largest industrial concern
in Austria, ‘yellow’ Heimwehr trade unions were created by
moral corruption and by all methods of victimization known
to the employers.” '

In September, 1931, occurred the attempt by Walter Pfrei-
mer, a Heimwehr leader, at a Fascist revolution in Styria. He
proclaimed himself dictator of Austria and seized public ofﬁces
in that province. Karl Buresch, Clerical, had succeeded Ender
as Chancellor, and he remained inactive, whereupon the Social-
ists informed him that if the Government did not suppress
the revolt the Socialist Schutzbund would. Regular troops were

then sent, and the revolt collapsed.

Pfreimer ﬂed to Yugoslavia, where he remained some weeks
and then returned to Austria. When he was placed on trial with
seven others in the city of Graz on a charge of treason he was
acquitted despite the warning of the prosecutor that an acquittal
would lea-d to more Fascist attempts. The workers were con-
ﬁrmed in the belief that no Austrian court would convict any
Heimwehr -man no matter how clear his guilt might be.

Although the fearful economic crisis that gripped the nation
brought a decline in the membership of the Austrian trade
unions the membership of the Social Democratic Party had

. steadily increased since 1927. In that year it was 669,586 and

on January 1, 1931, it was 698,181. Both the trade unions and
the party held their annual congresses that year and the dele-
gates listened to reports citing various phases of the struggle
with the government and the Fascists.

The Vienna Administration

We -may now break the continuity of our narrative by con-
sidering the remarkable administration of the capital city of
Austria by the workers through their party. The kind of re-
action that ﬁnally conquered the city and the country may be
imagined by brieﬂy considering what this reaction hated.

Vienna was the only city in the world with over a million
population that was governed ‘by an absolute majority of Social-
ists. The first majority was obtained in 1919, the year of the
revolution, and the Socialists fell heir to a reactionary constitu-
tion that gave the minority of landlords and privileged rich a
representation out of proportion to their numbers. As early as

1911 the Socialists had polled nearly 43 per cent of the vote of»

the city in the parliamentary elections, and yet they obtained
only eight seats out of 165 in the city council.

A new constitution was adopted which granted all men and
women over the age of 20 the vote, proportional representation
was introduced and the administration was reorganized on mod-
ern democratic lines. With the collapse of the old empire and
the frightful economic decay of the country at the end of the
war, it was freely predicted by Austrians and foreigners who
visited Vienna that the city was doomed to decline to an unim-
portant town. The Socialists faced a herculean task.

However, they worked out a unique ﬁscal policy and obtained
the revenues required to institute the remarkable social services
which have attracted the attention of -municipal experts all
over the world. The -Christian Social Party, which had. con-
trolled the city, left an empty treasury, the old revenue from
taxation was not adequate and the depreciation of the currency
added to the diﬂiculties.

The Socialists enacted a series of luxury taxes, graduating
the levies in proportion to ability to pay. There were taxes on
entertainments, balls and festivals; on restaurants, drinks and
motor cars; on servants, horses, concessions and advertisements.
For example, all persons employing two or more servants were
taxed for each servant in excess of the ﬁrst one, the tax for
each being higher for men than for women servants. The an-
nual tax for a second female servant was about $5; for the
third one, $45; for the fourth, $80. Men servants were taxed

' twice as high. It was a new form of ﬁscal equity in taxation

based on the conception that in proportion to the increased
enjoyment of luxuries by the rich they should be assessed in
accord with their ability to pay. ‘ ‘
Another course was followed in the case of various private
enterprises that were designed for eventual socialization. This
14

 

  

 

is best described by Robert.Dannenberg in his “Vienna Under
Socialist Rule,” published in 1928.

“The socialization legislation passed during the revolutionary
years,’.’ he wrote, “permitted the municipality to become a share-
holder in a number of large industrial undertakings. Clause 37
of the Act which governs the operation of jointly-conducted
enterprises entitles the State or other public bodies to subscribe
for one-half of the capital of any companies formed under the
most favorable terms that are offered. The Vienna municipality
has frequently exercised this right when companies have in-

creased their capital, and today it is interested in 66 enterprises,

chieﬂy of the engineering and building type. Its share in some
of these enterprises is insigniﬁcant, while in others it partici-
pates up to one-half of the capital. It has completely acquired
a number of enterprises, but continues to operate_them in their
previous legal form. «

“By virtue of its holding in various enterprises, the munici-
pality appoints numerous ofﬁcials to the directorates of com-
panies, and strict measures are adopted to prevent any irregu-
larities from taking place at the outset. These measures are
reinforced by the legal provisions which govern the participa-
tion in private enterprise of a member of the Vienna Court of
Aldermen or of the Vienna Municipality sitting as the Diet.
This law prescribes that members of the Vienna Diet or of the
Court of Aldermen, who are appointed to administrative posi-

. tions in various undertakings, must announce the fact within

one month of their election. A committee of the Diet decides

as to the eligibility of any candidate for these positions.”

Other aspects of the Socialist administration’s ﬁscal policy
are interesting, but these two were basic to the building of the
remarkable social services that made Socialist Vienna famous.
The whole program is quite in contrast with the vulgarian rule
of American cities by their rings of bourgeois politicians.

Out of decaying Vienna arose the Child Welfare Department .

with its variety of -services, the provisions for expectant
mothers, the clinics and baths and tuberculosis centers, the

school and educational reforms. All this brought new life and ~

hope to the masses who but a few years before had lived in
“The City of Dreadful Night.” Those who lived on workless
incomes hardly relished the new ﬁscal equity that made this
possible. .

But it was Vienna’s municipal housing that attracted world
attention. When the Christian Social Party ruled at the Town
Hall the interests of the landlords were dominant; in the So-
cialist administration the welfare of the masses became the first
consideration. If the old Vienna was noted for its beauty, it
also had some of the f-oulest slums in Europe in which human

15

 

 

beings festered in revolting surroundings. The Socialists set
for themselves a task in housing that has been unsurpassed by
any other city in the world. They proposed_ to have the city
erect apartment dwellings of the most modern type, homes
that for comfort, convenience and health were to equal those
enjoyed by people with ample middle class incomes and to do
this without burdening the city with an excessive debt.

“The chief aim in view,” wrote Robert Dannenberg, “is to
build houses and ﬂats which shall be healthy and convenient
in every way. The large buildings, which frequently comprise
several hundreds of ﬂats, do not give the impression of bar-
racks. They are tastefully designed and form impressive objects
for the sightseer, imparting a new architectural beauty to the
aspect -of the city. . . . The large blocks of ﬂats are provided
with play rooms for children, courtpards and gardens. A
steam laundry, installed in the larger buildings, with drying
apparatus and electrically-driven mangles, enables the washing
of a family of four or ﬁve to be done in half a day. Most of
the blocks of ﬂats contain shower baths and bath tubs, for
the use of which small charges are made to cover the cost of
maintenance.” '

This task was carried through, and it brought hope and joy
to many thousands of Vienna workers who, under the old Dual
Monarchy had lived in foul habitations that bred disease and
brought a heavy toll of -death. These beautiful, sanitary and
impressive dwellings were -monuments to the creative genius
of an informed working class conscious of its power. They gave
the masses an increasing sense of human solidarity and fore-
cast what would be possible throughout the worl-d with the com-
plete abolition of a form of production that mainly served a
minority of owners and proﬁteers. Is it surprising that the
Fascist barbarians armed by Chancellor Dollfuss shelled these
apartments of the proletariat in the February insurrection?

Parliament Is Suppressed

Events drifted from bad to worse in the Spring of 1933 and
Dollfuss began to reveal his reactionary intentions by drawing
closer to the Heimwehr and refusing to summon Parliament.

By April the reactionary aims of the Government became
more pronounced. The Dollfuss Cabinet -o~rd'ered the dis-
solution of the Socialist Schutzbund, the armed organization of
the workers with 80,000 members. No -order was given to dis-
arm the Heimwehr Fascists. The Socialists concealed their
arms and weapons. Hitler came into power in March and the
Austrian Nazis, composed of Hitler’s followers, demanded the
resignation of" the Dollfuss Cabinet and the union of Germany
and Austria.

16

 

Parliament was not in session and Dollfuss decided not to
call it together. President Miklas invested Dollfuss and his
Ministers with dictatorial powers to issue emergency decrees,
prohibit public meetings and censor or suppress newspapers,
and judges were vested with the authority to set aside verdicts
of juries. He outlawed the Nazis but permitted the Heimwehr
freedom of action and placed the State Governments under
Commissioners responsible to him.

With Parliament practically under the heel of Dollfuss, the
Socialists began in 1933 to circulate a petition to have it called
into session, but this was conﬁscated by a Vienna Court on the
ground of an objectionable statement the court claimed it con-
tained. A revised draft was prepared leaving out this statement,
but this petition was also conﬁscated. Nevertheless, the workers
succeeded in circulating a third one and obtained the signatures
of 1,216,327 men and women voters. The Dollfuss Govern-
ment ignored it.

A Chancellor Dollfuss began to call upon the dictators in Rome
and Budapest. To both of these a dictatorship in Austria would
be satisfactory if it is not of the Hitler type. Each of them
wants a fascist Austria which will cooperate with him, not one
which will strengthen Germany. Shortly after Chancellor Doll-
fuss visited Mussolini in August, 1933, he declared that the
solution of Austria’s problems could only be found in a Fascist
regime organized upon the Italian model. Parliament would be
wiped out, a corporate, authoritarian and Christian State would
replace it with a lower chamber elected by plural voting and
the upper chamber representing professions -and provincial
chambers. Under such a state the Labor and Socialist move-
ment would be doomed. The candid support of Fascism by
Dollfuss brought a conﬂict in his Cabinet while the -Heimwehr
Fascists came into conﬂict with the Socialists over this reac-
tionary proposal. Dollfuss then created a non—parliamentary
government, he remaining "Chancellor and taking over four,
cabinet “posts. Major Emil Fey, Heimwehr leader, became Vice
Chancellor and the drift to oligarchy became marked. General
Vaugoin, who had been reorganizing the army on a reactionary
basis, became director of the state railways. Railway workers
were ordered to join Dollfuss’ Patriotic Front, which meant
the eventual destruction of the union an-d that the railway work-
ers were to become militarized or fascized. Dollfuss from Sep-
tember on ‘became virtually a dictator, and with Fey as Vice
Chancellor the Heimwehr practically became a private ar-my
under the direction of Dollfuss and Fey.

There are two fatal dates for the Austrian workers in August
of last year, August 10 and August 19. After more than a year
of delays Dollfuss managed to get an international loan of

17

 

$43,000,000 which strengthened him at home and abroad. On

August 19 Dollfuss was in Rome conferring with Mussolini,
and it was shortly after his return to Vienna that he declared
for an Italian type of Fascism. Great Britain and other powers
had provided Dollfuss with money to support his precarious
dictatorship just as France once bolstered a tottering Czarism
in Russia with loans. That Dollfuss received some kind of
promise of support from Mussolini is evident from the fact
that Mussolini mobilized troops on the Austrian frontier dur-
ing the February rising in Austria.

By the middle of October the Heimwehr Fascists became
bolder and were boasting of marching on the Vienna Town Hall,
seizing it, and throwing out the Socialist administration. The
Austrian Social Democratic Congress was held on October 14-
16 in Vienna and there were also threats of arresting the dele-
gates, including the foreign guests. The Fascists were following
the tactics of wearing down the workers.

Bauer at the ' Paris 'Congress

Economic conditions in Austria were becoming so desperate
that there was danger of the workers losing hope. They were
compelled to ﬁght on two fronts against Fascism while the gov-
ernment through emergency decrees attacked the legislative
structure built for their protection. The enslavement of the
masses by Hitler’s bands in Germany also brought a fourth
menace of an Austria brought under the dictatorship of the

German Nazi terror. -Otto Bauer, leader of the Austrian Social ,

Democracy who fought by the side of his comrades in the
February rising, speaking at the Paris Congress of the Labor
and Socialist International in August, 1933, presented to the
delegates the tragic and dangerous situation facing the Austrian
workers in the following words:

“In Austria I see a working class of whom more than a third
are unemployed, and unemployed not merely for today or yes-
terday, not for a year or two years, but unemployed for three,
four and ﬁve years past. I see the workers in the industrial cen-
ters of Austria where before the eyes of the unemployed masses
machines are dismantled and scrapped as old iron, so that the
misery of unemployment is aggravated by the far worse evil
of hopelessness. I see the workers in factories who are still in
employment and who are well organized, but who, despite their
strong trade union organization, are so weighed down by the
appalling economic crisis from which practically the whole of
the big industries of Austria are suffering that they are unable
to resist the most drastic reductions in wages. And these work-
ers ,suﬁering all the tortures of hunger, bitter misery and hope-
lessness, are now feeling the terrible defeat of German Social
18

 

Democracy, with which they have been so intimately associated
and on which they had built such high hopes. And while the
impression of the ‘German collapse is still fresh, these workers
ﬁnd the wave of Fascist reaction ﬂooding into Austria too.
“The working class of Austria is menaced simultaneously by
two competing brands of Fascism, the Fascism of Germany on
the one side, stretching out its mailed ﬁst to grasp Austria, and
on the other side an ostensibly Austrian Fascism that is in
reality nothing but the pliant tool of Italian Fascist Imperialism,
the triumph of which would be merely a preliminary to the

restoration of the Hapsburgs in both Austria and Hungary.

Those workers, threatened with this double danger, see their
party, but yesterday so strong and eager to advance, in one
tragic moment driven to ﬁght their battles on two fronts. If
they venture to launch a decisive attack upon the enemy before

them, the government, their other enemy, German Fascism,‘

will be able to utilize the opportunity to seize control. That is
the tragedy of ﬁghting on two fronts, that if troops are massed
on one front the enemy on the other threatens to attack.”

Surrounded by Four Dictatorship:

The arrogance of the Dollfuss-Fey Government for several
months before the proletarian rising more and more irritated
the workers. The ruling cliques followed a persistent policy of
wearing down the workers by Heimwehr provocations and by
decrees that had for their purpose the destruction of the trade
unions and the eventual destruction of the Social Democratic
Party. The balance of class forces in the Republic was such
that the Socialists, although the strongest single party, did not
represent a majority in the nation. The conservative and reac-
tionary groups, Heimwehr, Nazis, Pan-Germans and Christian
Socials, while united against the Socialists, found it difficult to
agree among themselves. These groups divided according to
their attitude toward large and small industry, the peasantry,
Protestantism and Catholicism, the return of the Hapsburgs,
Fascism. It was the proletariat, with some adherents from the
professional and lower middle classes, arrayed against the
whole upper range of big business magnates, the old aristocracy
of clerical and military parasitism and the Fascist mercenaries
who included some criminal elements. '

The ascension to power of Hitler in Germany in. March,
1933, also added to the difficulties of the Austrian workers.
The German Nazis and their allies, the Nationalists, had ob-
tained an absolute majority as a result of the hysteria over the

«ﬁring of the Reichstag building and the terrorist acts of Hitler’s

storm troops. The Fascistajunker alliance in Germany had a
“popular” mandate to support it and in the next few months

The Rand School of Social Science L

“Adult Education for a new Social Order-——A School or College
in whch the teaching is free from accepted dogmas, giving emphasis
to the teachingvof the Social Sciences—-a school which shall be open ‘
to the workers, and from which they shall not be barred by the
inadequacy of their earlier training, or lack: of ﬁnancial resources.”

Function——Purpose-Methods

The school takes to itself a two-fold function—First, to give
all ‘who are interested in Socialism an opportunity to inform them-

 

selves about its principles, program, history, and achievements; »

second, to provide Socialists with facilities for such study as will
make‘ them more effective workers in and for the movement.‘Social_-

ism, as conceived by the Rand School, implies also Trade Unionism -

and other forms of working-class action.

History, Sociology. Economics-—the theoretical and practical

‘aspects of the Socalist and Labor Move1nent——together with English

and Public Speaking, have always formed the basis of the curricu-

lum. Psychology and Philosophyhave been added, and beyond

this the school's work has been extended into the ﬁeld of Literature,
Drama and cultural expression.

Since Socialism is essentially democratic in its aim and method,
dogmatic teaching does not best serve its purpose. Not to instill
doctrines into the students’ minds, but to place knowledge within
their reach and incite them to think for themselves, is the ideal by
which the teaching staff of the school are guided. Not only is the
instructor's own attitude scientiﬁc rather than theological, but the

classroom methods are such as to call for active participation by
the students.

it proceeded to destroy all organizations of the Workers. The
sadist persecution of the Jews, exceeding in extent the Jewish
pogroms under the reign of the last Czar of Russia, revealed
the reversion to barbarism in Germany. The arrests of Social-
ists and trade union leaders, the tortures in the concentration
camps, and the general wild orgy of the Fascist bands en-
couraged by Hitler, the dope addict Goering, and the malign
Goebbels, all forecast what might come to the Austrian workers
if the same reactionary cliques destroyed the Republic.

With the creation of a Fascist Germany Austria became a
small island with a large ‘measure of Labor and Socialist power
in a sea of dictatorships. To the South was Fascist Italy where
Mussolini had swined into a -dictatorship at the head of Fascist
bands that had put Labor, Cooperative and Socialist institutions
to the torch; bands that had roamed at will armed with clubs
and riﬂes, murdered workers in the streets and in their homes,
and forced thousands of victims to drink large quantities of
castor oil. Not a trace of a labor movement was left in Italy
and the Fascist criminals became a subsidized armed force to
do the will of Mussolini.

East of the Austrian border is Hungary, ruled by the rem-
nants of the old semi-feudal landlords with Admiral Horthy
dictator and holding power as _“regent” for the return of the
Hapsburgs. The Hungarian revolution of soldiers and workers
in 1918 destroyed over night the dominance of the semi-feudal
cliques andestablishe-d a Workers’ Republic. The Allies con-
tinued the blockade of Hungary so that needed material and
foodstuffs could not be obtained and after a number of changes,
including a brief regime of Socialists and Communists who
for the time acted sincerely in a “united front,” the republic
perished. Rumanian forces, aided by Herbert Hoover’s “bread
basket,” invaded Hungary, and the old ruling classes were re-
stored. This was followed by bestial tortures of workers that

, are unspeakable and unprintable. While the Labor and Socialist

movement was later revived it has functioned under extra-
ordinary difficulties and this Hungarian «dictatorship is the ally
of Dollfuss and the Heimwehr in Austria.

Yugoslavia, to the South of Hungary and Austria, has a
similar history of terror and dictatorship. In 1921 Socialist
organizations were declared illegal and strikes were forbidden
and penalized by ﬁnes and imprisonment from two to twenty
years. King Alexander became -dictator in 1929 and the jails
were soon ﬁlled' with workers, but the labor movement continued
largely as secret societies. The dictatorship went through the
farce of restoring Parliament and called for elections in Novem-
ber, 1931, which the workers boycotted because of the terror.
20

 

Here also the government has favored Fascist trade unions and
a small number of Christian unions of the clerical type.

VVith a Fascist Germany created by Hitler and his bands,
Austrian workers were surrounded by four dictatorships with
only Czechoslovakia to the North with a powerful Labor and
Socialist movement functioning under a republic and capable
of rendering aid. Communism was also strong in this country,
but its unions and political movement have heavily declined in
recent years by large desertions to the Socialist organizations.

A small Fascist movement developed in Czechoslovakia, but it

has been suppressed by the government.

._ Dollfuss, the Heimwehr and one section of the Clericals,
representing the minority groups of capitalists and landlords
in general, while aiming at the destruction of the Labor and
Socialist “movement in Austria before the rise of Hitler, were
not conﬁdent of their power. In Germany there was a power-
ful trade union and Socialist movement which served as a check
on Austrian reaction. After Hitler destroyed this movement
the Austrian reaction beca-me more conﬁdent. The rise -of -Hitler
marked a _turning point in Austrian history both for the re-

action and the workers, and both sides were aware of it.

Practically the whole population, including the Socialists, had

favored a union of Austria and Germany, but German Fascism
changed this. The workers favored a Republic Independent
of Hitler’s regime while the reaction desire-d an Austrian Fas-
cism independent of Fascist Germany but in close alliance with
Hungary and Italy, especially Italy. Hitler’s Fascists in Austria
were suppressed by Dollfhss, but the Heimwehr Fascists were
left free to organize and act. The negotiations by Dollfuss in
foreign capitals to obtain support of an “independent Austria”
that was being attacked by Hitler’s propagandists were carried
on at the same time that he looked‘ forward to the creation of
an Austrian Fascism that meant the same thing for the Aus-
trian Workers that German Fascism meant for the German
workers.
V The reader who tries to vision himself in the position of an
Austrian worker with these backgrounds in view can under-
stand something of the heroism of the Austrian masses who
fought four days behind barricades and in their homes. They
were ﬁghting not only for the preservation of their own con-
quests won by much sacriﬁce and suffering; they fought for the
freedom of those masses in Europe who are lying prostrate
under barbarous regimes of terror and dictatorship.

Last Days of the Republic

A leader of Austrian Socialism, writing after the end of the
insurrection to the Labor and Socialist International, presents

21

 

 

some additional facts regarding the Dollfuss’ and Heimwehr
provocations that brought on‘ the struggle. The writer of this
report still remains in Austria and, naturally, his name is not
disclosed. His narrative shows that when the ﬁghting» began
the Dollfuss Government was already at work destroying the
free trade unions. This narrative is summarized in the following
paragraphs. "

The bitter feeling of the workers was “intensiﬁed to a high"

pitch by a degree of Minister Schmitz under which all workers
organized in free trade unions were to be excluded from em-
ployment in connection with works and building operations car-
ried on by the State and also from employment by private ﬁrms,
in so far as these were fulﬁlling contracts for the state,” he
writes. “According to the regulations made by the Minister the
only workers who could be employed in connection with such
works were those who were recommended by the employment
agencies of the Christian Social trade unions and the -Heimwehr.
The workers rightly regarded this measure as an attempt to com-
pel the unemployed to join the Christian Social trade unions,
which have only organized an insigniﬁcant farction of the
workers of Austria.”

The membership of the Christian Social trade unions in 1930,
the last ﬁgures that are available, was only 107,000, while the
Heimwehr unions had only 50,000. How servile these unions
were to the reaction is evident from the fact that when the

Anti-Terror Law against the trade unions was enacted in 1930 .

these unions did not join in the campaign against it. If the
government of the United States were to issue an order of the
kind issued by Minister Schmitz in favor of company unions we
would have a parallelto it. '

One week before the rising Dr. Ender, Minister for the Con-
stitution, also made a signiﬁcant statement that further embit-
tered the workers. He “announced that Austria must very shortly
receive a ‘transitional constitution’ which would be ‘almost a
dictatorship.’ Under this constitution there was no longer to
be a. Parliament elected on the basis of universal suffrage.”

The voting power of the Austrian proletariat was to be sabo-
taged and made useless! And Chancellor Dollfuss declared after
the end of the rising that the working masses were led by a
“few fanatics” who really had no grievances!

Simultaneously with this statement by Dr. Ender, Social
Minister Schmitz “announced that there could not be any free
trade unions in the ‘new Austria’ but only ‘semi—State
organizaions,’ and no right to strike -for the workers but the
right of the State to decide in all wage disputes.”

Thus a two-fold coercion was employed to destroy the trade
22

 

 

unions. The members were to be denied employment in any
public works of the government unless they joined Heimwehr
or Christian Social unions while Minister Schmitz expected to
transform the free trade unions into Fascist unions under gov-
ernment control as in Germany and a Fascist government was
to prohibit strikes and decide all disputes between workers and

' employers. This would reduce the whole working class of Aus-

tria to helpless servitude. Dollfuss was playing the role of a
policeman in the service of the owners of industry.

Bauer and Deutsch in Czechoslovakia

Otto Bauer ,leading theoretician of the Austrian Socialists,
and Julius Deutsch, who was Minister of War in the ﬁrst
Cabinet of the Republic, escaped to Czechoslovakia. Deutsch
had commanded the armed workers and Bauer fought with
them in Vienna till it was decided that the struggle was lost
and it was agreed that the leaders should leave the country to
escape the Fascist hangmen while the workers should take ad-
vantage of the amnesty offered.

A correspondent of the New York Times interviewed the
two Socialist leaders in Czechoslovakia and their statements
may be summarized here. Bauer stated that in the days preced-
ing the struggle many leaders of the Schutz—bund were arrested,
that the party headquarters were searched. and even the parlia-
fnentary immunity of Socialist Deputies was violated by break-
ing open their desks. The leaders decided not to sleep at home
for fear of capture before the conﬂict began. “The only leaders
who were not in the ﬁghting front were those who were in
prison,” said Bauer

Dressed as a worker in overal1s,‘he remained at communica-
tion headquarters organizing a news service and sending out
propaganda to the workers. But one messenger after another did
not return, being either killed or captured, until only one man
was left with Bauer.

His account of events leading up to "the rising agrees with
what I have written. The rise of Hitler to power early in March
made a marked change in the situation for the Austrian work-
ers. Some agreement with the government was necessary or
the Nazis would triumph in Austria and bloodshed would be
inevitable. Dollfuss promised that early in April he would open
negotiations, but when this period arrived he had secretly gone
over to the Heimwehr and declined even to speak to the Social-
ists. They then tried to negotiate through others without result.
They approached the Clerical leaders, who were favorable to
an understanding, but Dollfuss continued his stubborn re-
sistance. Cardinal Innitzer was friendly but could do nothing,
while the Bishop of Linz and the Papal Nuncio, Mgr. Sibylla,

23

 

 

took the position that the time had come to destroy Socialism
forever. « -

To keep the peace, preserve the republic and the freedom
of action of the workers and to retain their institutions the
Socialists offered Dollfuss concessions. ‘fWe let Dollfuss know,”
said Bauer, “that if he would only pass a bill through Parlia-
ment we would accept a measure authorizing the government
to govern by decree without Parliament for two years, on two
conditions only——that a small Parliamentary committee, in which
the Government had a majority, should be able to criticise
decrees and that a constitutional court, the only protection
against breaches of the Constitution, should be restored. Doll-
fuss refused.”

This statement has been distorted by the Communists, who
in the German Diets of Prussia and Saxony and on quite a
number of measures in the Reichstag cooperated with the
Fascists. They also formed a united front with Hitler’s Fascists
in a Berlin strike. The Communists, who now traduce the
Austrian workers and their leaders who fought side by side,
who excuse the cowardice of the German Communists who re-
fused to ﬁght after years of boasting, now turn their verbal
guns upon Bauer.

The fact is that since March, 1933, the Dollfuss Government
had been exercising the emergency powers described by Bauer
in the absence of Parliament. The proposal made by the
Socialist leaders which Bauer outlines was to have represen-
tatives of the parties vested with power to criticise the
decrees and to restore the powers of a constitutional court to
pass upon them. The proposal would have checked the arbitrary
powers exercised by the Dollfuss Cabinet rather than extend
them. So much for the Communist criticism.

But the Socialist leaders also took action to guard against
any miscarriage of their hopes even if this proposal had been
accepted. This is seen in the following statement made by Bauer
to the Times correspondent:

“In our Parliamentary committee in October. we announced
that a general strike would take place if any of four things,
but only these things, should occur. You know these conditions.
They were that if the Government imposed a Fascist constitu-
tion on the country, if a government commissar were appointed
in Vienna, or if our party or the trade unions were dissolved
we would strike. Our party stuck to the last to these four
points.”

The Communist critics ignore this precaution. The proposal
to Dollfuss was not to increase his power but to decrease it;
:1: program of the Socialist Parliamentary committee was to

 

 

strike in the event any one of four things was done by the
Government or the Fascists.

At the same time, Bauer relates, the workers complained
that the government was wearing down their spirit and was
choosing its time to attack. “Then came the Heimwehr revolu-
tion in the provinces, when the armed Heimwehr arose and
demanded from the governors of the provinces a whole series
of breaches of the Constitution.

“How illegal it was for the Heimwehr to have arms you will
understand when I reveal to you that the only reason General
Vaugoin, a great anti-Socialist and Minister of War almost
since the foundation of the Republic, had to resign his position
in September was that he refused to yield to Dollfuss’ demand
to give 16,000 riﬂes to the Heimwehr. As soon as Vaugoin was
gone Dollfuss had the riﬂes issued.”

The Heimwehr armed by Dollfuss while the Schutzbund
months before were ordered to disarm! The workers did wisely

not to trust the treacherous Dollfuss and surrender their arms. ,

This same Heimwehr raided the workers in Linz to deprive
them of their arms, and the strike broke out in that city. This
was followed by the general strike in Vienna. Armed men were
sent into the homes of Vienna workers “to sarch for arms which

» they had retained since the war to defend the republic in an

emergency.” The strike became a civil war. The guilt of Dollfuss
is evident. He and the Heimwehr leaders provoked the con-
ﬂict.

One other statement of Bauer is interesting. He cautioned
the workers in Linz to remain cool, said to them that “if we in
Vienna could submit patiently to an arms search in party head-
quarters they must try to do the same.”

There had been searches in previous months and the workers
had remained cool in the face of these provocations. Months
before the ﬁnal conﬂict workers and leaders had‘ agreed not to
be provoked by the Heimwehr. However, the masses in Linz
decided that the hour to strike back had come and their action
was communicatd to Vienna, the workers of Vienna ordered
a strike, and the uprising became general in Austria.

Dollfuss and his agents over the radio endeavored to defame
Bauer and Deutsch by broadcasting the falsehood that the lead-
ers ‘had deserted their comrades and taken funds with them.
Deutsch did not have enough money to buy a shirt when he
reached Czechosolvakia, while Bauer had a total of 105 shillings
in his pocket.

The Attack

The battle between the Dollfuss-Fascist reaction and‘ the
workers of Austria began on Lincoln’s birthday, February .12.

25

 

From Linz it spread to Vienna where “trusted patriots” two
days later made a house-to-house canvass in the bourgeois dis-
tricts to enroll volunteers. In Linz the workers resisted the
troops with hand grenades and riﬂes, the police and ‘Heimwehr
ﬁghting side by side. In Vienna the Socialist leaders proclaimed
a general strike throughout Austria at noon when word was
received of the ﬁghting at Linz. Workers in the gas and electric
light. plants, the street car service and other industries in Vienna

walked out and the Heimwehr marched with machine guns into i

the working class disthricts. Martial law was declared and a

‘state of civil war was recognized. Death was ordered for all

caught with arms—except the Heimwehr—and the Social Dem-
ocratic Party was outlawed.

On Monday, February 12, the green and white ﬂag of the
Heimwehr was raised over the Vienna City Hall and the- So-
cialist printing plant was in the hands of the Fascists. The
Schutzbund distributed a secret leaﬂet among the workers say-
ing, “Every comrade must stand at his post until he falls in
this struggle to the death for Austrian liberty.” The Dollfuss
Cabinet dissolved the Vienna Diet and Karl Seitz, Socialist
Mayor, was dismissed. He was replaced in Social Welfare Min-
ister Schmitz, the same minister _who had the week before
issued the decrees intended to destroy the trade unions. The
Provincial Diets were also dissolved and commissars represent-
ing Dollfuss were placed in charge. Karl Renner, ﬁrst Chancel-
lor of the Austrian Republic and president of the Austrian
Chamber, was arrested. A Dr. Schussnig in a radio boadcast
referred to the Social Democrats as ““hyenas who must be
hunted out of the country.”

On this day certain anti-Fascist leaders of Dollfuss’ Christian
Social Party made efforts to restore peace. Led by the Christian
Social Mayor of the city of Baden, they called upon Dollfuss
and asked him to remove Vice Chancellor Fey, declaring that
Fey and the Heimwehr were responsible for the bloodshed,
but Dollfuss had embarked upon his bloody enterprise and the
Republic was already in part destroyed by orders of himself
and his Cabinet. Workers were ﬁghting in Vienna and Linz
and other cities, in part behind barricades, sometimes in workers
buildings, and in a few cities strategic positions were won from
the Hemwehr and then lost. Schutzbund ﬁghters occupied the
roofs of some of Vienna’s apartment dwellings with machine
guns and ﬁred upon Heimwehr troops. In the suburb of Ottak-
ring overturned trucks and stones served them as barricades
in the streets.

By Tuesday, February 13, the resistance of the workers was
evoking admiration and sympathy in many countries and‘ the
Fascists began to shell the apartments with artillery, pouring a
26

 

ﬁre into rooms occupied by men, women and children. In Vienna

if the workers were holding the gas works and a railway station

in Floridsdorf as well as their apartment homes. In the pro-
vinces the workers oﬁered stout resistance throughout the day
and retained control of Steyr, center of the Austrian armament
industry. Fighting continued all day in Graz, and in Linz the
Socialists recaptured a number of buildings but lost them later.
At 10 o'clock Tuesday morning one section of the Karl Marx
Hof, one of the largest of the -municipal apartments, was cap-
tured. Workingmen clad in blue overalls and leather jackets
walked out with hands raised in the company of Heimwehr
youths. . I 4.

In Ottakring, a strong working class suburb, the workers
held out in several apartment homes despite a night of with-
ering artillery ﬁre. A steady rainiof shells that began at dawn
was believed to have broken the workers’ resistance, but when

the enemy forces approached in armored cars the proletariat"

drove them back. However, the workers club and Socialist
headquarters had at 9 A. M. been taken at the point of the
bayonet. Some thirty workers, including ‘Herr Sever, Socialist
member of Parliament, had defended the building which was
a mass of ruins. High on the crossbeam of a window hung the
body -of a workman who preferred suicide to capture by the
Heimwehr. A New York Times correspondent described the
ruins of the workers’ headquarters.

“For a parallel to the picture that the ruins of this building
and the movie theatre next door presented one would have to
turn to photographs of -Chateuau-Thierry or some other well-
shelled town in the World War. The front was shot to pieces,
all the windows were gone and the roof was badly damaged.
Pieces of the building cumbered’ the road, together with masses
of broken glass, thousands and thousands of cartridge cases and
clips, both exploded and ‘bad’ minnenwefers, and every kind.
of debris.”

The forces of “order” had triumphed in Ottakring. In Wiener
Neustadt, the largest Socialist suburb, the workers held their
positions through the day and into the night an-d in Floridsdorf
two other blocks being besieged returned ﬁre behind window
curtains. In the suburb of Meidling the workers were sur-
rounded in a cemetery where they ﬁred from behind tombstones.

The provinces hold out even better, for at Bruck-am-Mur the
railway station and surrounding hills were in possession of the
workers under the direction of the Socialist Mayor. In Styr
the Heimwehr required reinforcements and they went there
under the command of Starhemberg. In Graz the ﬁghters for

27

freedom held the printing house against a determined ‘storming
party, and in Linz the workers still fought on.

In Vienna the Schutzbund actually occupies the cattle market
where 16,000 slaughtered‘ swine are stored. They hope to hold
it and starve the reaction into submission but the workers are
driven out. Hearses begin to move slowly through the streets
with their dead, the number of which no -one knows with cer-
tainty. One of twenty—four workers holding a barricade pause
long en-ough to tell a newspaper correspondent, “We realize our
position looks hopeless, but there is only one death ahead of us

anyway—-it is starvation, or a bullet, or a rope.” In some apart- .

ments shelled by the Fascists, workers leave to ﬁght in the
streets to draw the ﬁre away from the women and children in
their homes.

Before the day ended Dollfuss -scored a victory for “order.”
Karl Muenichreiter, a 43-year old shoemaker, had‘ been taken
prisoner during- the- ﬁghting the day before. The shoemaker
was seriously wounded and was almost carried from the hos-
pital to the court room where he was sentenced to be hanged.
He was executed in the afternoon. Society is saved! A press
correspondent wired his paper, “Bourgeois Viennese were clam-
oring for the ruthless punishment of Socialist Burgomaster
Seitz and other leaders of the Socialist movement who are now
under arrest.” Vice Chancellor Fey offers a reward of a
thousand shillings for the head of Kolman Wallisch, Socialist
Mayor of a town in Styria. Dollfuss outaws 36 societies and
associations on the ground that they contained‘ Socialist merri-
bers.

The od-ds are against the workers and by Thursday the main
ﬁghting is over. Fascism, smeared with blood and dirt, brings a
victory for Dollfuss and “order.” But not without a startling
ﬁnal ﬂare-up by the defeated ﬁghters for freedom. From the
very sewers of Vienna came riﬂe shots of workmen determined
to ﬁght on to the end. In all the annals of the long struggle of
the masses for emancipation there never had been such a dra-
matic ending of a battle for human freedom. An Associated
Press dispatch from Vienna on February 16 tells the story.

“Driven underground into the sewers of Vienna, the scattered
forces of the ﬂeeing Socialist Republican Guard are ﬁghting
desperate guerilla warfare today, still disputing the authority
of the Austrian Government.

“The secret passages into the roomy sewers, which honey-
comb the ground under Vienna, were ways of escape for de-
feated garrisons of the municipal apartment blocks shelled by
government artillery Tuesday, Wednesday and yesterday. Now
the sewers themselves have become a last stronghold for these
ﬁghters.

“Last night Socialist riﬂemen emerged from manholes in the
Stadt-Park district—though it was -ofﬁcially said that there had
been no ﬁghting in Vienna since yesterday noon—and terriﬁed
foreign residents who were kept awake by the clamor and the
gunﬁre as the Socialists skirmished with the police.

“This morning, all seemed quiet, but the underground army
—no one knows how large it is—.still was lurking in the sewers.”

These workmen displayed a sublime heroism rarely paralleled
in the history of the race. Such courage is not evoked by a
trivial cause. The sewer ﬁghters of Vienna, together with the
brave men and women who passed through the four bloody
days prepared by Dollfuss and the Heimwehr, will never be
forgotten.

A little comedy emerged out of the tragedy when the Fascist
mercenaries declared that Vienna’s apartment homes had been
built with the view to their future use as fortresses in a class
struggle. The Fascist leaders and Fascist press had forgotten
that in recent years they had charged that the great buildings
were cheaply built because Socialist leaders had‘ proﬁted in
awarding contracts. Their solid construction was revealed by
the shells which they had withstood.

Press accounts of the ﬁghting indicate that the women fought
heroically with the ‘men. At Floridsdorf and at many other
places, women carried munitions from the basements to the
ﬁghters upstairs. Defenders who escaped from their houses,
said it would have been impossible for them to defend their
positions so long had it not been for the encouragement of the
women. They urged the men to ﬁght to the last.

The Republic ﬁfteen years ago abolished the hangman, but
Dollfuss recalled that worthy relic about seven weeks before
the insurrection. On February 16 three workers were hanged
and six -others were sentenced to death. Other sentences and
hangings were reported the following days. Kaloman Wallisch,
Socialist Mayor and leader of the forces at Bruck—am-Mur, was
captured Wednesday and was hanged on the following Monday.
Wallisch bore the head for which Vice Chancellor Fey offered
a thousand shillings. The betrayer of Wallisch to the Heimwehr
was later found and executed by the workers.

And the death toll? Chancellor Dollfuss put it at 240, but
foreign newspaper correspondents agreed that the deaths totaled
1,000 to 1,200 throughout Austria, including 600 Socialists in
Vienna, and about 5,000 injured.

A storm of foreign criticism, not conﬁned to Socialists and
Labor men, beat about the head of Dollfuss and the Heimwehr
leaders for their conduct in the bloody week, and were it not
for this the number of executions would have been greater.
Dollfuss announced that he would follow a policy of reconcilia-

The Dollfuss Version

“Austrians killed in Civil War; Socialists Declare General
Strike; Dollfuss Bans Party; Nazis Lie Low.”

“Slay Scores of Austrian Women; Many Children also killed
in New Fighting.” '

. These were typical headlines in New York papers for several
days beginning Monday, February 12. For four days the civil
war continued, a contest between Fascism and the working
people of Austria. When the last shot was ﬁred and the hang-
man of triumphant reaction had done his work many of Vienna’.s
wonderful municipal apartment houses were ruined. The labor
movement was destroyed. Its property had been stolen, its
organizations wiped out.‘ The Social Democratic Party, the
cooperatives, the labor buildings, the publishing houses, news-
papers and magazines, the institutions for sport, music and
education—all were the booty of the Fascist conquerors. Over
a thousand had been killed, and the wounded numbered at least
5000. Other thousands of Austrian working men and women
were in jail; the leaders of the movement, except for a few who
escaped after the ﬁghting, were under arrest.

What was the cause of the upheaval? Had the working class
of Austria suddenly turned barbarians, beginning an insurrec-
tion without justiﬁcation? Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss of
Austria endeavored to answer these questions in a redio ad-
dress broadcast in the United States on Sunday, February 18.
He spoke for the clerical aristocracy, the bourgeois who ﬁnanced
the Heimwehr Fascists, and the monarchists, all of whom
hated the democratic republic which the workers of Austria
created. The important paragraphs of the Dollfuss radio ad-
dress are here quoted. The Chancellor said:

“The Austrian people and the government have formally _

repulsed this attack which was made against them in this fight
which we did not seek. ' _

“I want to stress one point here most emphatically, and that
is that this was not a battle of the working classes against the
Federal Government that took place in these days of national
distress. It was the attack of a small group of fanatics against
the State and society. Everybody knows what a general strike
would have -meant for a people in such economic plight as we
are, but the strike order was obeyed, fortuately, by not much
more than 10 per cent of the workers at most.

tion after what one press correspondent called “a massacre
withouta Reichstag ﬁre.” The Chancellor is dependent upon
foreign loans and he must satisfy the Heimwehr and his bour-
geois backers who in Vienna are demanding the liquidation of
the social legislation which cost this class high taxation.

As the month of February closed the Dollfuss Government
announced that former Mayor Seitz of Vienna, Karl Renner,
ﬁrst Chanceller of the Republic, and Hugh Breitner, who created
the Arbeiter Bank, were to be tried on charges of high treason.
All members of the party executive under arrest will also go
to trial, which indicates that the period of reprisals had not
ended. ‘

The transformation of Austria into a Fascist State is also
going on. Young people between the ages of 14 and 18 are being
registered by the police into a “patriotic organization” on the
lines of Hitler Youth or Mussolini’s Fascist Ballila. Oﬁice hold-
ers will wear Dollfuss’ Patriotic Front uniforms and the green
shirt will be the emblem of Austrian Fascism. The Patriotic
Front arranged for the ﬁrst anniversary of the suppression of
Parliament by Dollfuss on March 4 as a great national festival.
The Provincial Diets are being coordinated by Dollfuss, who
nominates the representatives, and provincial government heads
are empowered to rule by decrees that must receive the approval
of the Dollfuss Government. '

Thus the old parasitic cliques destroy the Republic and pro-
ceed to transform the national into a Fascist prison. Meantime
the Socialist workers watch and wait and’ have the affection of
millions all over the world. Their insurrection against measure-
less provocation stirred the workers all over the world and gave
warning that the masses will ﬁght to the death against servitude.
A tremendous upheaval like that in Austria, despite all censor-
ships, became known in the other Fascist nations bordering on
Austria and it will encourage workers there to watch and wait
for the hour when Fascist despotisms will perish by their inner
contradictions, their inability to solve the absurd contradictions
of capitalistic production. “Shod in the iron sandals of Revolu-
tion,” as Lassalle once said, the masses will yet march to victory

‘over Fascist bondage and free mankind from economic exploita-

tion and political servitude.

In Retrospect

Our all too brief story of this great struggle of the Austrian
masses vindicates the ﬁghters for freedom now in Fascist
prisons and those who gave their lives for their class and their
cause. It indicts Chancellor Dollfuss and shows that he adds
falsehood to infamy in declaring that the insurrection was due
30

 

 

 

to a “few fanatics.” It shows him the willing accomplice of
Starhemberg, the leader of the Heimwehr Fascists.

Step by step for nearly a decade the old ruling cliques more
and more sabotaged the Republic and by force and arbitrary
decrees end'eavored to destroy every phase of the Austrian
Labor movement. The Government made the Heimwehr an
auxiliary of the police and ﬁnanced the Heimwehr while it
raided the Schutzbund with the intention of disarming it. The
Government undermined the Soldiers’ Councils, the Workers’
Councils and Chambers of Labor and then, on the eve of the
insurrection, the decrees of Minister Schmitz practically out-
lawed the trade unions and looked forward to making con-

scripts of the members of Fascist unions under the direction

of‘ government agents.

The Corporative State of Dollfuss was an export of Italy
and there is little doubt that Dollfuss struck a bargain with
Mussolini in the Fall of 1933 to destroy all workers organiza-
tions in Austria. Dolluss refused to call Parliament despite the
fact that a million and a quarter signatures were gathered to a
petition urging this course. A servile court even suppressed
the drafts of two petitions. When a petition becomes an offense
in any country the masses owe no allegiance to that Govern-
ment.

Universal suffrage will be restricted and rendered largely a
farce in the Austrian Corporative State of Dollfuss. As for the
City Councils, Diets, and Provincial Governments, they have
already become vassals of the Dollfuss Government, while the
former free Parliament is to become a‘ Council ﬁlled with Doll-
fuss’ creatures.

Proletarian Vienna hated by anti—Semites, the Fascists, the
old landlords, ' the monarchists and the bourgeois class, was

undermined by sabotaging its ﬁnances. The Vienna that was-

saved from being reduced to a second—class city by the genius
of its Socialist administrators, was ﬁrst sabotaged and then
ﬁred upon by Fascist artillery. Against this attack the Socialist
working men and women fought to the death.

The Socialists and workers of Austria made the ﬁnal sacriﬁce
for the right of workers to organize and go on with their labors
for. the rebuilding of society. They fought and died, not just
for Austria, but for the working class movement everywhere.

“Nearly 20,000 armed men out of a population of 7,000,000
were incited to think that they could hope‘ to realize their in—
sane ideas in Austria by a leader who left them to their fate
when the tide turned against them.” (The Government and
Heimwehr leaders were still repeating this falsehood regarding
Otto Bauer, who had fought to the end’ in Vienna and then
escaped to Czechoslovakia).

“The Austrian Federal Government has waged this battle
that was forced upon it with the utmost consideration in order
to avoid unnecessary casualties.”

So runs the oﬂicial version of what happened in the four»

Bloody Days. I shall speak for the working men, women and
children who died in defense of their homes; for those who
fo-ught against the extermination of their Labor institutions
and organizations; for those who fought for the democratic
republic through which they hoped to achieve complete indus-
trial demcoracy and social equity. We shall together brieﬂy
review the ﬁfteen years struggle of the Austrian working class,
their sacriﬁces, their achievements, the dangers they faced, the
sabotaging of the Republic by the black elements of theold
parasitism that once ruled the Dual Monarchy, and the series
of provocations by these cliques that induced the workers to
rise in insurrection. We shall unfold a story of remarkable

. discipline and patience maintained till longer endurance of

provocations would have been to submit to a yoke as galling
as any that the workers have borne in the long annals of the
struggle for human emancipation.

"The City of Dreadful Night"

Our story begins with the end of the World War. The old
Dual Monarchy had collapsed (in the last days of October,
1918), a revolution of the soldiers, workers and students fol-
lowed vast demonstrations before the Parliament building in
Vienna. A Socialist, Karl Renner, now prisoner of Dollfuss
and the Hei-mwehr to be» tried for “high treason,” became
Chancellor of the Republic. Otto Bauer, who fought with the
workmen in the Bloody Days of February, became Foreign
Minister. Karl Seitz, recent Socialist Mayor of Vienna, be-
came President.

However, Austria became a bleeding remnant of what had
been the ‘Dual Monarchy. The Allied victors had torn from
Austria some of her most important provinces, including Hun-
gary. In Vienna the terms of the Austrian Peace Treaty
handed to Karl Renner at St. Germain were declared a “sen—
tence of death.” Austria was cut oﬁ’ from some of her impor-
tant industries and raw materials and was dependent upon
4

 

 

 

Allied countries for industrial and ﬁnancial aid. Insufﬁcient
food took a heavy toll of working men, women and children,
especially in Vienna and other cities. Austria becam-e a helpless
ward dependent upon the charity of her conquerors.

The Allied guardians with their armies stood as a constant
threat against any full program of socialization, and only a few
industries were socialized. Currency depreciated, prices soared,
and proﬁteering by capitalists and gamblers added to the misery
of the masses.

Philip Gibbs visited Vienna in November, 1919, and wrote
in Current History, January, 1920, of the frightful distress.
Of the 6,000,000 people in Austria, Vienna had 2,000,000. “The
City of Dreadful Night,” he called it. Only a few lights glim-
mered, and at 6 o’clock all shops were closed‘. Masses of people
lived in semi-starvation. Austria was hemmed in by hostile
neighbors. Transportation was terribly crippled for lack of
coal. '

From May 16 to September 30, 1919, the American Relief
Committee provided 20,000,000 meals to starving children and
the British helped. The palace of Archduke Ferdinand, whose
murder brought on the war, was transformed into a soup
kitchen. Vienna proﬁteers speculated in foodstuﬁfs and paper
money while the old empire was dying. In the streets and in
the homes of workers and the small middle class poverty stalked
“naked and cold, and hunger which is just less than starvation,
and disease just this side of death, and the certain knowledge
that, unless ‘something happens’ quickly, they will be in the
hands of Famine.”

Babies were emaciated from lack of milk. There were 6,000
homeless families in Vienna and 100,000 jobless workers re-
ceiving from 5 to 15 cents a day to keep alive. Children over
one year of age received no milk. The bread ration for each
person was two pounds each week. Eightydthree per cent of
the children suffered from rickets, “so badly bulbous-headed
that many are deformed.” Two million people lived without
meat, butter, milk or any kind of fat. Chancellor Renner
begged for aid of the Allied Supreme Council in Paris while
starving people in Austria were invading hotels, restaurants
and shops. THIS WAS THE AUSTRIA THAT CAME
INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS AT THE END
OF THE WAR.

The Austrian workers, through their political. trade union
and cooperative organizations proceeded to bring some order
out of the bloody -mess into which the old ruling classes had
plunged it. In the ensuing years they built the most powerful
labor movement, in proportion to the population, in the world.
They retained their arms to be prepared against any conspiracy

of reaction when it came out of hiding. Later, Vienna was
transformed into a ﬂower garden in its social legislation for
the masses. Its municipal apartments became a Mecca for the
social engineers of the world. All this was accomplished de-
spite a terrible depression that never ended and that became

even more acute following the economic crisis in 1929.

The Austrian Labor Movement

The history of Austrian labor is one of great sacriﬁces to
win the suﬁrage and to establish trade union, cooperative and
cultural organizations. Thirty-ﬁve years ago suffrage was
restricted by various qualiﬁcations that excluded many work-

ingmen, and yet in 1901 the Socialists polled 780,000 votes and

elected ten members to Parliament. Encouraged by this ad-
vance, the party and the unions decided on an intensive agita-
tion for -manhood suffrage. V

The events in Russia following the ‘war with Japan, which
forced the Czar to establish the Duma, encouraged the Austrian
workers in 1905 to renew the struggle. Some 30,000 working-
men and women demonstrated before the Parliament building.
When Parliament assembled in November the workers de-
clared a ‘holiday throughout Austria-Hungary and this was
followed by a demonstration in Vienna participated in by a
quarter_ of a million workers. But not till February, 1906, did
the government take steps to extend the suffrage. Early in
1907 manhood suffrage was gained and the following May the
Socialists won 87 seats, and their voteincreased to more than
a million.

-The trade union movement developed parallel with the politi-
cal movement of the workers. A big demonstration of "workers
in Vienna in 1869 won the right of organization. The unions
slowly developed from over 70,000 members in 1892 to nearly
178,000 in 1903. By 1929 the free trade unions had a member-
ship of over 766,000, of which nearly 168,000 were working
women. The trade union movement owned 18 buildings, not
counting various holiday ho-mes, and held shares in seven
cooperative enterprises and published 52 periodicals. The unions,
the Social Democratic Party, and the cooperative movement
worked in harmony.

In the cultural sphere the unions established study classes
and lectures, maintained a Labor College in Vienna, and voted
funds to sport and physical culture organizations, singing so-
cieties and schools. No phase of working class life was neg-
lected by the Austrian trade unions. _

Austrian workers had also developed an imposing cooperative
movement, the Arbeiter Bank and a number of smaller banks.
There were over 100 cooperatives with more than 1,000

6

 

branches. They inculded bakeries, shops and coﬁee roasteries, I

had a membership of nearly 300,000 and employed 2,500 work-
ers. In 1932 their turnover was 160,000,000 shillings, while the
small banks of the ‘workers carried deposits of 19,700,000
shillings. The Arbeiter Bank had a capital of 8,000,000 shillings

and 54,000,000 in deposits and current accounts.

5. D. P. Congress. I926

‘ The Austrian Social Democratic Congress met early in
November, 1926, and adopted a new program in anticipation
of the emergencies that faced the workers. It declared ﬁrmly
for the preservation of the Republic against all attacks and
opposed violence and dictatorship. Should a counter-revolution
be attempted, however, they declared for a dictatorship of the
workers—not a party dictatorship—and were prepared to act
with arms if necessary. The party declared that complete social-
ization could not be achieved in Austria alone but only in co-
operation With the labor movement in other countries. It recog-
nized, too, the fact that the ‘help of substantial sections of the
peasants, the lower middle class and intellectuals was essential.
As neither the Socialists nor the conservative parties were
strong enough to govern alone the S. D. P. were willing to
cooperate with those parties that supported the Republic.

Elections to the Soldiers’ -Councils of the Austrian Army
occurred in October, 1926 with a slight gain for the Christian
Social Party, However, four ﬁfths of the delegates were Social-
ists. In the whole army the Socialists had 11,130 delegates,
3,650 were Christian Socials, 203 ‘Communists and 49 Reac-

tionaries, known as “Yellow.”

The July (I927) Riots

Vienna was rocked to its foundations in July, 1927. The
conﬂict grew out of the acquittal of three Fascists who had
murdered two Socialists, a war cripple and his young son. The
workers called a general strike which paralyzed industry, riots
broke out, scores were killed in the streets, the Ministry of
Justice. Building was burned, and the property damage was
estimated at $35,000,000.

In the previous April the Social Democrats had polled nearly
43 percent of the vote, an increase of 225,000 over the vote
in 1923. In Vienna they had polled more than 62 per cent of the
total vote. In the previous ﬁve years they had built the wonder-
ful apartment houses for the workers and enacted the social
legislation which evoked admiration throughout the world.
Heavy taxation of the wealthy made this possible.

Harry J. Carman, writing in Current History, September,

1927, of this period. declared, “many of the bourgeois leaders
have turned to Fascism as a possible way out of their difﬁculty..
Throughout the country Fascist militaristic organizations, such
as the Heimwehr, have accordingly been organized. The Social-
ists allege that Fascist terrorists and the old imperial bureau-
cracy, which is still ﬁrmly entrenched in the Austrian judiciary,
are "working hand in hand. The acquittal which precipitated
the recent riots, they assert, was only one of a long series of
cases where -guilty Fascist terrorists were white—washed by
a reactionary judiciary.”

These July Days marked a deﬁnite turning in the direction
of Fascism by ‘wealthy bourgeois, old monarchists, army aristo-
crats and reactionary elements in general. Austrian elections
revealed a slow but constant and peaceful acquire-ment of power
by the workers. The Soldiers’ Councils, the Chambers of Labor,
the Workers’ councils and the Trade Unions were deﬁnitely
against the old order. But_ the Social Democratic Party had a
majority in the nation against it. The conservative elements
were recruited largely among the peasants of the provinces.

Otto Bauer, lea-der of the Social Democratic Party, who
fought with the workers in the recent February battle against
Dollfuss’ mercenaries, wrote an account of the July conﬂict in
which he said: . -

“If the Austrian working class had replied to the bloodshed
of July 15 by revolution, by an open struggle for mastery of
the State, this revolution would have taken the following course:
In Vienna, perhaps, the attempt would have succeeded, though
only after very hard ﬁghting and at the cost of very heavy
casualties and terrible destruction, in compelling the Govern-
ment to capitulate an-d in setting up a dictatorship of the work-
ers. But the‘ rule of this workers’ dictatorship would have
extended only to Vienna and the neighboring districts of Lower
Austria. In the provinces, where hardly anybody but the rail-
roa-d men along the railway lines and the workers in a few
industrial centers would have backed up the movement, unques-
tionably the workers would have been suppressed. The provinces
would have separated themselves from Vienna and would have
set up a rival Government.

“Open warfare between Vienna and the provinces would
have been inevitable. This certainly would have led to an eco-
nomic blockade of Vienna and almost as certainly to foreign
intervention—invasion of the burgenland by Hungary and of
Tyrol and Carinthia by Italy. The Viennese workers would
have fought heroically, but it is as sure as fate that they would
have been beaten. All the potentialities for the future which
are contained in the formidable power of the Austrian Socialist
Party and of the Austrian unions wohld have been scattered
8

 

to the winds at one stroke. Such are the fundamental facts, such
is the determining distribution of power, which must be known
in order to grasp the course of events in Vienna.”

The Vienna police had possessed only comparatively harmless
swords, but after July they were armed with revolvers an-d 25
rounds of ammunition by the National Government. They were
also equipped with short daggers and two armored tanks, and
for the time being parades and street demonstrations were for-
bidden. Nevertheless, on September 12 twenty—four great mass
meetings were held by the workers in Vienna and Mayor Seitz
declared that Herr Schober, Vienna police hea-d, was responsible
for the violence of July.

How strong the Social Democrats were becoming is evident
from the votes cast for President of Austria on December 5,

0 1928. The selection is made by an electorial college composed of

two houses of the Austrian Parliament. uilhelm Miklas was
elected on the third ballot. The following was the vote: First
ballot, Miklas, Clerical, 94; Karl Renner, Socialist,; 91 Scho-
ber, Pan—German, 25. Second ballot, Miklas, 94; Renner, 91;
Schober, 26. Parliament adjourned to permit each party group
to confer. In the evening the college again met and took a third
ballot with the following result: Miklas, 94; Schober, 26;
blanks, 91. The Socialists cast the blank ballots which broke
the deadlock and made Miklas President.

Mkilas ‘became President on December 10. In his farewell

address the retiring President, Michael Hainisch, urged that

Communism had scarcely obtained a foothold in Austria, al-

more power be lodged in the hands of the President, who should
appoint and remove members of his Ministry, which would
deprive Parliament of its control of the ministers.

The Social Democratic Party made an interesting report of
its progress to the Congress of the Labor and Socialist Inter-
national which met in Brussels in August, 1928. The report
showed that the party had 669,586 members and that the wom-
en’s organization had 201,064 members. In Vienna alone the
party had 387,677 members of whom 259,019 were men and
128,658 women. In the whole of Austria 16.59 per cent of the
adult population were members of the party and in Vienna
29.52 per cent of the a-dult population were members.

Of course, the Socialist vote was even larger than the party
membership. In the elections in April, 1927, the Socialists in-
creased their number of seats in Parliament from 68 to 71
while the vote increased from 1,311,870 to 1,539,635 and the
percentage of their votes increased from 39.6 per cent to 42.3
per cent. In Vienna alone the party received 693,621 votes,
59.87 per cent of the total vote cast. Local elections early in
1928 also showed substantial increases in the Socialist vote.
