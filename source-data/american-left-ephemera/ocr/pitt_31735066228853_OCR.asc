VIII. SCHOOL

The demand for school education has grown immeasurably in
the U..S. S. ‘R. in comparison with the pre-revolutianary period;
The _int"rodu’ction‘ of universal compulsory education cal_-
led for a proportionate ‘spreading of the ‘networkof schools. ‘ 2
The ‘fundamental statutes and p_rinci"ples of the 'new”social
order created by the Revolution determined "the new principles of
postrevolutionary‘ pedagogy, which differs’ utterlyfrom that of
former days. Thefbasic task set by the Soviet Government‘ in the
domain of school activities is':' ' ‘T ' ' V ' '

«T-he carrying out of universal free of charge co‘mpul- V

' sory general and polytec‘hnical'education for all children of
both sexes up to the page of 17»; j A

Polytechnism, which is put into practice from the first grades
-of public education seeks to promote an-allround development
«of. the child and finally to accelerate the cancelling of the contrast
betweenphysical and mental toil. Soviet pedagogy demands
simultaneous and harmonic development of three principles of
public education viz: of 1) mental “education, 2) physical training
and 3) polytechnical instruction. ‘

Universal school education was carried out by stages.

Universal primary education was first of all introduced
(The first four school years for children from 8 to 12 years). Later
on, by the end of the'first Five Year Plan (1932) uni_versal
education in cities and towns comprised 7 classes (age from 12
to 15). At present, the task to be accomplished by the end of the
second Five Year Plan (1937) is the following one: a seven
years’ course of education must be introduced in villages, and
a 10 years’ course of education (age 15-18) in industrial
centers; up to 85-90% of the child population of the country
must be enrolled in schools, with a tuition of 7 or 10- years.

SCHOOL 

This means accomplishing, in a very considerable measure, the

basic task of school education in the U. S. S. R., as stated above.
The growth of universal education will be seen in the fol-'

lowing figures: ' 7

The number of pupils in primary and secondary schools
only in the R.S.F.S.R. willreachafigure of 17 millionsby the sum-
merof 1933 (about 13 millions of these learn. at primary schools
and about 4 millions at secondary schools). About 22 millions of
children must be enrolled in primary and secondary schools in the
R.S.F.S.R. by the end of the second Five Year Plan period.

The growth of universal education was reflected in the growth
of school buildings.

In the R. S. F. S. R., in 1932 alone, 2.338 new school buildings
for primary and secondary schools began to function; 219 of
these belonged to districts withunational minorities. In 1933-
2.927 new school buildings will begin to function, 359 of which
are situated in districts inhabited by national minorities. ’

Hygienic norms are strictly adhered to when erecting new
-school buildings. . '

Besides schools for general education, there are also schools
for professional technical education; their basic type being the
factory and works’ schools for pupils, specializing in different
branches of industry. , 9

The age of pupils in these schools of the Fabzavoutch (factory

workshop schools) is from 15 to 18; they receive pupils out of the
, number of those that have finished their studies in secondary

schools with 7 classes. The number of students in these schools
reached a figure of 1,5 millions in 1932.

A special «professional selection» for admittance to the fac-»-
tory workshop schools (physician’s participation in it being
obligatory) has been instituted with the purpose of aiding juve-
niles in the choice of a profession. This selection should insure ade-
quacy of health and capacity in the pupils of different speciali-
ties admitted in these schools. A medical examination, as well as.
psycho-technical and a social one of each individual pupil is
carried out, with a view to «professional selection».

In order to insure the juveniles being prepared beforehand:
for the choice of a profession, professional consultations, in which.
school physicians play the principal part, are resorted to in secon-
dary schools. (Letter of the Peopl’s Commissar of Health from
27, VIII. 1932).

The number of school physicians grew proportianately to’

the extension of the network of schools and to the increase in
the number of students. From an insignificant figure of about
150 physicians for the whole of the country in pre-revolutionary
times, their number is rapidly rising, reaching in R. S. F. S. R.
alone (railway school physicians included), a figure of 7.044 in
1922, of 7.256 in 1923, 7.875 in 1927, 7.928 in 1929, 2.400 in 1930
and 2.650 in 1932. In the whole of the U. S. S. R., by the end of
the first Five Year Plan, i. e. 1932, there were 4.300 school
physicians, 400 of whom were in villages and about 500 on
railways.

The work of school physicians is helped out by that of their
aids—the nursing ‘sisters belonging to children’s health protec-
tion, whose activity is exercised in schools, as well as in medico-
prophylactic institutions for children.

The amount of work to be got through by school physicians

Sanitary-hygienic and medico-pedological measures in conjun-
ction with the physical culture of children and their p o l y t e c h-

well as in school-workshops), special kinds of work with p h y-
sically weak chidren (teaching in the open
particularly) and likewise various kinds of sanitary education
and sanitary enlightenment work have acquired a greater develop-
ment in schools.

In conformity with the regulations for school sanitary inspec-
tion, physicians belonging to other specialities—pediatrists,
sanitary, district and other doctors——also take‘ part in the sanitary
pervision of schools; definite duties and the responsibility for

the sanitary state of the school devolve also on the educators and
principally on the manager of the school. ’

«The responsibility for the sanitary condition of schools
and other institutions for children rests with -the admini-
stration of the same, i. e. with ‘the manager of the school
or ch.ildren’s institution; the sanitary school inspector
is answerable for the timely taking of all necessary mea-
sures towards keeping schools and children’s institutions
in due sanitary and hygienic condition‘; he is also respon-
sible for the organization of social activities, for the
sanitary state of the kitchens, for the children’s food
being of good quality and for the carrying out of measures
for combating the illnesses of children».

(From the «Statutes on school sanitary
inspection». _ 1931).

In conformity to a Governmental decree of 15, II, 1932
the People’s Commissariat of Health and that of Education
elaborated and published a typical order of school studies and
of the amount of normal work to be required of school-children
in accordance with the typical order (obligatory for all schools).
Consistently with this order:

Lessons in schools for children of'the first grade1 do
not begin till 8,30 a. m., for those of the second grade not
before 8 a. m. (§ 1). Lessons last 45 minutes. School-childre_n
of the first, second and third groups have not more than 32
lessons per decade (ten days), those of the fourth group not
more than 40. The second grade has not more than 48 les-
sons per decade, including all training and industrial les-
sons (§ 2). Home tasks for the first and second groups are
limited to an amount that should not take up more than
30-45 minutes, or 1 hour for the third and fourth groups,
and l1/2-2 hours for the second grade (§ 4). As regards the

kinds of social work available for children such only should
be chosen as are of any instructive or educational value
and are in conformity with the age, capacity and interests
of the children (§ 6).

The children’s feeding, the work of school-children’s organi-
zations etc. is regulated in a similar way by typical order. \

The Central Institute for the Protection of Children’s and
Juveniles’ Health has elaborated a detailed regime for schools of
different types, with the age and health of children taken into
account.

Solicitude for children in the U. S. S. R. is not confined to
measures put in effect in the school itself, it purposes to embrace
the life of the child in its entirety. Great heed is therefore paid to
the carrying out of extra-mural measures of education and sani-
tation. Of such are the following:

school-hours, the admittance of_children to physical culture

zation of children’s tourism and excursions under medical
supervision, the sanitary ordering of extra-mura1children’s
resorts (playgrounds, clubs, stadiums, «children’s towns»,
attached to parks and boulevards, skistations, etc.); the
obligatory setting apart of playgrounds for children, of
children’s towns and rooms, when new parks of culture and
rest are being laid out, or stadiums, clubs and other cultural
institutions organized; the carrying out of extensive sani-
tary-‘instructive work among children and parents.
(From the letter of the People’s Com-
missariat of Health concerning extra-

mural sanitating measures. August
20-th 1932).

The work of self-helpful organizations of school-children,
including organizations for sanitary selfhelp has grown extensively
in the schools of the U. S. S. R. Every school has its children’s
sanitary commission (or brigade), in each class there are class
.orderlies, who see to everything being clean, as well as to the

observance of all established sanitary rules. They disseminate‘
sanitary instruction through the medium of the school newspaper,.
the issuing of special sanitary bulletins and the propagation of
sanitary literature. They keep up a connection with the house of
sanitaryenlightenment, belonging to their district and help in the.-
arrangement of excursions and of travelling health protection
exhibitions in schools. In a series of places, villages especially,.
school-children have been initiators and active agitators for the
achievement of a sanitation work, and outside of the school they
have stimulated the population to clean streets, yards, public’
buildings and dwellings, instituting monthly cleaning up and
other mass sanitating measures, and setting a good example if
needed.

Selfhelpful organizations of school-children are headed and
guided by the organization of the young pioneers, in which.

We have seen above the growth of the number of physicians,
specializing in children’s health protection. The growth of basic
institutions for children’s health protection (in the R. S. F. S. R.);
may be seen from the following table: -

There is also an increase in the number of medical institu-—
tions for the treatment of child tuberculosis (both pulmonary
and osseous) and in the number of sanatoriums and health resorts»
for children, as well as regular places for children in common
health resorts etc. . 3

Children’s health protection, as a special system~having
numerous institutions at its disposal and purposing to embrace
all the children of the country in its entirety, is a creation

The increasing use‘. of. -woman’s? labour in tsarist Russia is
also to be explained by the fact that: .  A

of‘ that of a man-, which made it /possible to obtain-considerably
greater profit and  ‘ -  ~ ~ ~

2) the servile condition of women generally made it easier
for employers to exploit them. '

The povertyof workers and peasants in old Russia com-
spelled parents at the first opportunity to send their children to
factories or to hire them out to work. A child’s working day was
the same as that of an adult, but the wages of children and juve-
-nile workers were considerably less than those of adults. The
"few laws existing in the old days for the limitation of child-
.labour were not observed in actuality.

These hard conditions of life naturally affected the health
of the working woman and resulted in the premature loss of her
youth and strength. In peasant life a woman was often old at
:thirty years of age. .

«Small wonder that thou fadest untimely» as the poet Ne-
krasov truly noted.

A severe undermining of the health of women and a terrible
‘increase of women’s illnesses were caused by frequent child-
"bearing under antihygienic conditions. _ ' ;

Medical help was rarely available and there was only the
.-assistance of an- ignorant midwife or none at all, the woman
being delivered of child simply out in the fields, during the
“field-work. g

These conditions told even more severely on the health of
the children and were reflected in the appalling rate of their

‘mortality. Russia occupied the foremost place among other coun-
tries in regard to infant mortality, one of every three newborn
infants perishing in the first year of life, and approximately
only a half of all newborn children surviving childhood.

During the tsarist regime a half of the population was in

of the _October Revolution. The great majority of children’s
sanitating institutions of all types, mentioned above, did not
exist before the Revolution.There were, for instance, no institutions
for giving special neuro-psychiatric help to children, whereas
at present, besides the above named schools-sanatoriums for psycho-
neurotic patients, there are also special children’s psychiatrics
hospitals, stationary institutions for problem children, supple-
mentary schools for backward ones and children’s homes for
boarders, likewise for them, etc. Before the Revolution there did
not exist any day and night sanatoriums, attached to dispensaries.
Medical institutions for the treatment of child tuberculosis,

 

sanitating playgrounds and forest schools were to be found lite- .

rally only as separate units. This was also the case with special
institutions for disabled children (cripples). After the Revolution
institutions of this type came [into existence in the shape of
independent «Homes for disabled children» as well as in that
of special sections, attached to institutes, hospitals and clinics.
There are also specialschools for blind and deaf and dumb children.

Special commissions (Komoness), of which physicians, psy-
cho-neurologists principally, must unfailingly form part, are at-
tached to boards of the People’s Commissariat of Education.
‘Their functions consist in obviating the lack of supervision of
children, in examining cases of infraction of the law by minors
and in the defence of the rights and interests of children under age.

So called «Children’_s Commissions» are also most active in
-combating the lack of supervision of children. These commissions
are attached to all town councils (Soviet) of any importance, they
exercise the business of state supervision over the activity of all
organizations belonging to the domain of the social and legal
protection. of children. The Children’s Commission attached to
the Central Executive Committee (i. e. to the supreme organ of the
Government) is at the head of Chi_ldren’s Commissions.

The children’s dispensary (children’s prophylactic polyclinic
or a children’s section of a general polyclinic) is the center of all
medical help for children as well as of prophylactic exami-
nation. '

In industrial centers it has, besides, been instituted, that
every school-child should be submitted to a medical examination

period, namely, in the first, fourth and seventh school year, the
result of the examination being taken down in special sanitary
registers. (Letter of the. People’s Commissariat of Heaeth on the.
«dispensarization» of school-children, of March 21-st 1932). A clear
notion of the changes of children’s health is thus obtained.

The sending of school-children to some sanitating institutions,
especially during the summer sanitating campaign, is based on
the results of their medical examination, the conditions of the
child’s environment and the data of the teacher and school physi-
cian concerning it being taken into consideration.

The work of children’s dispensaries is closely connected
with that of all -the medical institutions of the district, with
the Commission for cases of‘ minor offenders, attached to
boards of the People’s Commissariat of Education, especially as
regards psycho-neurologic help and examination. The children’s.

dispensaries are also closely connected with the young pioneers ’\ of- ‘
, fice and other organizations of the district.

Supplementary sanitating institutions, which give the pos-
sibility of rendering practical help to sick and enfeebled
children who need it, are usually to be found attached to dis-

cian’s room for medicalgymn tics form part of these institutions.

School sanatoriums for psychogneurotic children, summer sanatory
camps—-permanent and temporary ones—are also closely connected
with children’s dispensaries.§ ’

Summer sanitating measures comprehend great masses of
children of school and preschool age and play an important part
in fortifying their health. In ‘I931, in the R. S. F. S. R. alone,
more than a million of children and in ,1932 about two millions
benefited by different kinds of summer sanitating institutions——
mass camps and sanatory camps, colonies etc.

The sums, needed for carrying out summer-sanitating mea-
sures, are composed of assignments made by numerous social organi-'
zations: the above named Children’s Commissions attached to
Soviets, sections of the Red Cross and the Red Half-Moon, of
«The Children’s Friend» and others, cooperative societies, facto-

IX. RESEARCH WORK ANDTRAINING
OF PERSONNEL

The swing of socialist construction has required .a correspon-

I ding growth of science in the U. S. S. R.

_ From the All-Union Academy of Sciences in Leningrad to
the local Research Institutions an important research work is
going on. New scientific institutions appear even in remote districts
where before the October Revolution most of the population was
illiterate.

Even in the most difficult days of blockade and intervention
the Soviet Government carefully protected the existing scientific
institutions and gave much attention to the creating of new ones.

_ The number of Scientific Institutes in the U. S. S. R. in 1932 ‘

amounted to 700 with more than 20.000 scientific workers, among
them 5.000 young scientists or aspirants.

All practical steps in the construction of the Soviet State were
accompanied by strenuous work in corresponding field of scientific
investigation. .

The widespread work of health protection in the U. S. S. R.
described~in the preceding chapters also required a scientific
foundation. 35 Central Scientific Institutes of'the People’s Com-
missariat of Health have been newly organized; besides there
are over 120 local institutes in the R.S.F.S.R. alcne. In 1933 a
large Institute of Experimental Medicine in Leningrad has been
newly organized. It includes laboratories of such famous scien-
tists as the physiologist Pavlov and the physicist Ioffe and
many others. The budget of the Institute is over 50' million
roubles a year. The organization of the All-Union Institute of
Experimenta1Medicine for the study of humain nature has been
carried out with the active voluntary help of social workers
under the leadership of the famous "writer Maxime Gorky.

In the field of ‘motherhood and childhood protection a great
number of special institutes has also appeared after the Revolution.

 

112 RESEARCH WORK AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL

The Institutes for the Protection of Motherhood and Infancy
:are located: the Central Institute in Moscow and the local insti-
tutes in Leningrad, Ivanovo, Gorky, formerly Nizhni-Novgorod,
Rostov on Don, Sverdlovsk, in Saratov, in Samara, at Alma- Ata in
Kazakstan. Besides in the Ukraine——in Kharkof,'Kiev and Dnepro-
petrovsk; in White Russia at Minsk, in the Transcaucasus in Baku.
. The Institutes for the Protection of Children’s and juveniles’
Health are to be found: the Central in Moscow and the local
«ones in Leningrad, Gorky, Rostov on Don, Ivanovo and Novo-
sibirsk. Besides in the Ukraine——in Kharkof and Kiev; in White
Russia at Minsk; in the Transcaucasus in Baku and in Tiflis.
I Besides in all Institutes of Health Protection in region cen-
‘ters there are departments for the protection of children’s and
juveniles’ health.
According to the general organization of scientific insti-
tutes of the Commissariat of Health each central institute is
:the methodical center for the local scientific institutes in the

wcorrespuonding line of work, thus providing coordination and

.unity of work.

The local scientific institutes in their turn represent the
‘methodical and instructing consultation centers for all the prac-
-ctical institutions in their line. They study and generalize the
practical experience of practical workers, they build theory on
the basis of local practice, thus they put into practice one of the
fundamental principles of the scientific work of the U. S. S. R.
in regard to the intimate connection of theory and practice.

The central scientific institutes besides their guidance work
:in regard to local scientific institutes are also working on their
practical bases in industrial enterprises, collective farms and
in the national minorities regions. I

«Theory, says Stalin, must furnish arms to practice,
must give to the practical workers power in orientation,
clear vision of perspective, assurance in their work, faith
in the victory of our cause».

The Central Institute for the Protection of Motherhood and
Infancy has investigated the following themes: the standards
and plans for the building of creches and obstetrical hospitals,

thedaily routine, equipment of creches, children’s clothing
standards. Experimental scientific work has greatly improved
the artificial feeding of children. Prophylactic methods in regard

to contagious diseases in children’s groups have been worked out '

as well as anumber of ‘mass measures of health protection of
children. An important study of the brain and nervous system

..of infants is conducted in laboratories, in connection with the

study of early childhood. ’
Of the themes of research which are being investigated by

the Central ,Institute for the Protection of Children’s and _]uveni--

les’ Health the following are to be pointed out:
Hygiene norms for school and preschool buildings. Hygiene‘
rationalization of theschool and preschool equipment (furniture,

- materials etc.). Carrying on of sanitary rules in the different

types of child institutions. Organization of groups for weak
-children in the mass schools. Methods of physical education in

school and preschool institutions. The age characteristics of A

the higher nervous activity of the child (study of the conditioned
responses according to the system of Pavlov). Children’s psycho-
motoric behaviour. - '

An important place in the work of the scientific institutes,
especially of central ones, is occupied by the work of perfecting
the training of doctors and of the secondary medical personnel..

The problems of medical work in the conditions of life of
Soviet Republics are rapidly changing and growing more compli-
cated. There appear new types of institutions which create the
necessity of a new type of workers, the existing types of workers
are being differentiated. These conditions call for regular perio-
dical courses of additional training. _

‘In the years 1931-1933 three hundred doctors, 120 nurses
(sisters educators) and 90 instructors and organizers of creche
sections went through the courses of improvement in proficiency
organized by the Central Institute for the Protection of Motherhood
and Infancy. _

In the same time 450 doctors went through the «courses of
improvementin proficiency organized by the Central Institute

114 ‘RESEARCH "worm AND TRAINING o1=’i=ERsoNNEL

6 ‘As to the training of ‘new medical workers there aremedical
inst_itutes that give training to physicians, medical technical
schools (medical technicums) and special courses that give trai-
ning to assistant-doctors and to trained nurses.

Before the reform of 1929 the higher medical institutes when-

giving training to doctors had but one general program for all
and specialization took place in the course of their practical
or scientific work, but at present specialization is entered
upon, when still Studying at the medical institute.

The medical institutes are divided into three sections (facul-
ties): medical, sanitary and the faculty for the protection of
"motherhood and childhood. V g

The purpose of the faculty for the protection of motherhood

and childhood is to train doctors for the field of their work with‘

women, infants and children of preschool and school age.
The students of the faculty for the protection of motherhood
and childhood’ are graduated after they have .. completed the

6 five years of study. During the course of execution of the second

Five Year Plan the faculties for the protection of motherhood and
childhood of the R. S. F. S. R. propose to graduate 6.356 doc-

tors, 3.622 of this number are to be specialists for early childhood '

and school age children and 2.734 are to specialize as accoucheurs
gynaecologists. ’

The medical helpVpersonnel—assistant-pediatrists.and ac-
coucheuses-—are trainedrby‘ medical technicums in their special
departments of pediatrics and obstetrics. During the period of
execution'of the second Five Year Plan it is expected to train
at medical technicums in the R. S. F. S. R. 12.300 assi-
stant-pediatrists and accoucheuses as well as 21.600 nurses at
courses of one year duration. An assistant doctor gets’ his dip-
loma after he has accomplished a three years.’ program of the
medical technicum. '

The role of the. workers’ social help

"One of the important characteristics of the soviet work for
health protection is that besides the medical personnel (specially

trainedpersons) an intimate participation in the work of all

RESEARCH WORK AND‘ TRAINING OF PERSONNEL 115

medical institutions is.taken by a great number of working people
who consider their work in the light of a social duty. Each medi-
cal institution as a rule has a social organization of this kind
of which different representatives of the working population,
directly interested in the work ofthe special institution form
part. Thus the work of the health center of a plant is intimately
connected with and finds every day social support in the group
for sanitary help, which exists at every factory and plant, as
well as at every section of a large factory. The members of these
groups are selected by the plant. committees of workers.

Creche councils are attached to creches, and councils of
voluntary assistance to consultations. Similar organizations
exist at hospitals and dispensaries. ‘

The activity of these social organizations is limited not

‘only to financial help and to participation in the organization‘

of wide sanitary measures, nor to participation in technical
help—-it is’ of much greater-significance.

All these nuclei are closely connected with voluntary social
organisations of plants, to which health institutions are atta-
ched, ‘and hence with the social work of the whole district.
Their work as their voluntary social duty is unified and directed

by ‘the section of health protection of the local council of

workmen’s and peasant’s deputies (Soviet).

’ Thus the intimate participation of these representatives
of the social labour organization inythe work of medical insti-
tutions secure them the help not only of the separate interested
groups of the population, but the authoritative, powerful support
of the main leading center of the whole local activity and simul-
taneously of the administrative power as represented by_ the
S o v i e t. ‘

Not of minor importance are those educational functions
which are "carried out by the numerous socialorganizations
connected with the work of medical institutions.

Medical institutions involve in their work working men
and women, and give them‘ the Opportunity through the
experience of their practical work to get intimately acquainted
with the work of corresponding institutions and by and by to

play a more important part in it. Medical institutions are thus.

training future workers for their field who specially devote
themselves to the work of health protection in one or another
line. Thus in the system of sanitary organizations there are at
present about 20.000 factory workers acting as voluntary sanitary
inspectors who are accomplishing a great responsible piece of sani-
tation work at factories, dining-rooms, dwellings etc. _

Precisely in this manner is obtained a number of excellent

I leaders in the field of protection of motherhood and_ infancy,

working on a district scale and even in central institutions.
They come from the broad mass of workers involved _in the cre-
ches and consultations work. Practically nearly all the leaders of
former,Department of Protection. of Motherhood and Infancy
who are now at the head of creche administrative centers in
the system of the Health Commissariat have come from the indu-

1 strial and rural enterprises, starting their work as delegates of,
the separate minor institutions of the system for the protection

of motherhood and infancy.
All larger medical institutions have special courses for

' the workers’ representatives and help them to acquire a certain

amount of special knowledge.

The medical institutions are thus not only practical school
but many of them give school training in the real sense ofthe
word. '

Often, after the first acquaintance with medicine given
by these courses, this promoted student pursues his studies further
and sometimes reaches the highest grade, i. e. the medical insti-
tute. -

The possibility of completing education without any links
missing is secured by the fact that throughout'the U S. S. R.
a system of education for working people that does not take them
from their work is widely spread. A woman may continue to work
during the day in creches, consultations, hospitals and dispen-
saries and in the evening she can study. Witha view to this
purpose the so called Evening Workers’ Faculties and Evening
Universities are being organized. ' »

The system of an extensively‘ practiced promotion of working
people to the leading work in the government and thesecuring
to them not only of the right but of the practical possibility of

RESEARCHWORIK AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL 117

acquiring the needed knowledge is a peculiar characteristic of
the entire system of Soviet government. Giving the working mas-
ses a share in ruling the state isan essential feature of Soviet
democracy. It is precisely in the work of the protection of mother-
hood and childhood which is based on the general drawing "into
it of workinggwomen that this system of the Soviet state finds
one of its most striking and convincing illustrations.

The work for‘ the protection of mother‘ and child, in the
U. S. S. R. is one of the most characteristic and brilliant pages
of the Soviet work for health protection. Much has been done
and still more has _to be done because of the enormous growth
of demands called forth by the building up of socialism.

Looking back at the road covered from the first days of
the Revolution to the second Five Year Plan the Soviet Health

Protection may with satisfaction summarize its work in the‘
‘line of protection of motherhood and childhood- as well as in

others. The health‘ of all working people as well as that of the
new generation of children reposes on a strong foundation.

By the end’ of the first Five Year Plan period the U.S.S.R.,

has achieved,. as Stalin says,

«such a life environment of the working class which «

gives us the possibility of bringing up a new generation
of healthy and cheerful workmen capable of raising the
‘ might of the Soviet Country to the due height.»

II. FAMILY AND»MAR'RIAGE* IN THE U.S.S.R- ~

The new social order created by the October Revolution
has radically changed the woman’s.position in her family and.
marriage relationship. ' r

«We have literally razed to the ground all the foul.
laws regarding the inequality of women, the obstacles
to divorce, the odious formalities connected with it, the
refusal to recognize children born out of wedlock and so
on, those laws the survival of which is still often to be

’ found in‘ all civilized countries. We have the right thou-
sand times "over to be proud of our achievements in this
field».

L e n i n. («The great start»).

The wife enjoys the same rights as her husband does. The
marriage and divorce is considered in the U. S. S. R. as a purely
personal, private affair, not connected with any juridical or
bureaucratic procrastinations. The government registers the:
marriage and the divorce. ' c

The very point of the Soviet _laws concerning the family‘
and marriage is directed towards every possible protection and
security of the children’s interests.

All the Soviet laws regarding marriage and family are based
on a recognition of the complete equality of rights, both juridical
and economicaliof the married couple. The law abstains from
petty interference in the personal mutual relations of husband.
and wife, at the same time keeping a sharp look out for the inte-
rests of the weaker party, i. e. women and children.

The p1'i‘n,c-ipial points which characterize the Soviet Code of

Laws regarding family and marriage are as.follows.

 

 

 

«roe p 1 _ V V 1 FAMILY AND MARRIAGE‘IN THE U. s.s. R.

Marriage

\

In order to get married in the U. S. S. R. no complex forma-
lities are required. Marriage and divorce are simplified.

With a view to protecting the interests of health of the per-
sons to be married and of their offspring the following wise re-
quirements have to be satisfied in order to get married:

’ 1; The persons of both sexesmust have attained the age

of 18 years. As an exception, considering the local life -con-ditions,
the Presidiumof the Central Executive Committee of the natio-
;nal_ republics has_ the_right t_o lower_ this slimitgition age for the
"women but not morethan by one year. ‘ ” V .
A"  2. The persons to be married must be mutually informed
-in 7re‘gard to the health of one another. A‘ ’

‘According to’ the, Soviet Code‘ of Laws contaminating ano-
:1.-her person’ wi_th‘a‘ venereal ‘disease’ and even «a risking "the dan-
get of: contamination for ‘another personfof a 've'n_1ere_al disease
through “sexual intercourse» is considered ‘a heavy penalcrime
which is punished by 3 years of imprisonment (Penalcode. Sec-

«tmnimm e  A»-

3. The persons to be married before registering their mar-

:riage must inform each other how many times they were mar- ‘

-ried,..whether their former marriage has‘ been dissolved, whether
“they have children remaining: from it, as the forming of new
family though ‘creating new obligations does not liberate from
previous obligations. in regard to themaintenance of children
under age and of a sick disabled wife»..— ’ 7 -
..Marriages are registered by ‘the «Zags» (the Registry-Office
of.Civil Acts), . ~ ' l - V T ’
T When registering their..nia'rriage- both the persons to —be

- married must declare which surname he wishes to bear——the

‘wife’ ‘has.the right :.to take her husband’s name-, thehusband

keeps his..own name. —  » -7 -

FAMILY. ‘AND MARRIAGE IN THE U.'S."S-. R; 11

at the request of. the married couple. In orderto: dissolve a mar-
riage it is sufficient that one of the parties should apply to the

«lags» for the divorce. If the «Zags» has received‘ an application

from one of the parties demanding a divorce, the other party is
simply informed that. a divorce have been pronounced. ‘

The personal. rights and the rightssof property ‘of both par—
ties, in marriage are based on entire equality. According to'So-
viet laws. the husband has.no privileges or licences as compared
to his wife. In case of any property conflicts the question is set-
tled in the following way;.all.the. prope"rty'which.was in the pos-
session of eitherj-of.the parties before marriage is left them as
their: personal. propertyi.*.. But the propertywhich was acquired
during-their married. life.must be considered as their common
property, even in the case, when the wife does not work and only
keeps h’ouse..  . I F  . I  ‘- I “I?

in case; of division of property the court always takes the
essence of the_matte.r.into account. If the main» part of. the lexpen1—
ses in acquiring the property was made byxthe wife, if she is -left
with children, the court'adjudgés her the mainpart and» in some
cas.es~the whole property‘    V

12 FAMILY AND MARRIAGE IN THE U. S. S. R.

The maintenance of the child is obligatory for the parents
till he is 18 years old, at which age he is supposed to be able to
earn hisnliving by himself.

The obligations towards the support of a child concern both
the parents in an equal degree. If after the divorce thechild is
left with his mother, the court in discussing the question of ali-
mony takes into consideration the mother’s work in taking care
of her child, the time that she spends on him as well as her finan-
cial state of affairs etc. ’

The.1aw of alimony is a great conquest of the October Revo-
lution. It gives the right to every mother to get the benefit of
the father’s support for the education of her child. This law pro-
tects from dereliction not only children born in wedlock but
also love children. A I g

It is not only the child that has already been born but also
the pregnant woman who has the right to alimony. She has the
right to alimony during the entire period of her pregnancy and
has besides the right to getthe expenses in connection with
childbirth paid by the child’s father. ‘ i "

With a. view to a maximum of protection of mother and
child the Soviet law gives the right to the mother to declare even
before the birth of the child who is the father of her child. A preg-

lnant woman may hand an application to the «Zags» or to the

village council giving the name of the author of her pregnancy
and indicating hisaddress. TheV«Zags» immediately sends,an
announcement to the indicated person informing him concerning
the application. In the course of a month the father may send
his protest to the «Zags». In those cases the pregnant woman may
apply to the court in order to settle the question concerning the
fatherhood. . ~ '

In the case when the supposed father does not_ send his protest
to the «Zags» he is registered as the father of the future child and
on the basis of this register the pregnant woman asks the court to-
fix her alimony. . ,

_*The Soviet laws take into consideration all‘ the difficulties
connected with obtainingthe alimony and therefore they give
the woman a number of privileges in connection withit.

In alimony cases the court does nottake any duties.

 

 

FAMILY AND MARRIAGE IN THE U..S. S. R. 13

The claims for alimony are handed in at the «lags» of the district
inhabited by the mother and not of that ofthe district inhabited
by the‘ defendant as is the case with other claims. For example,
if the residence of the defendant is in Leningrad and that of
the plaintiff in Moscow the claim might be handed in in,Moscow.

Should the defendant in an alimonycase not appear be-
fore court when cited, he may be forced to appear. ,

The sentence of the court in an alimony case must be. put
intoforce immediately. Usually, the defendant if protesting
against the sentence may lodge a complaint within ten days,
duringowhich period it is not permitted to put the sentence into
effect, but in an alimony case immediately afterthe sentence
the plaintiff may get the writ for carrying it out.

Persons who are ‘obliged to pay alimony are required to send ‘

a notice concerning the increase of their earnings or the change
of their work to the person to whom they are paying alimony.

According to_the Sovietlaws a fraudulent. evading to pay
alimony is considered as criminal and punished either by impri-
sonment for a period to 6 months or by a fine of 300 roubles
(Penal Code, from Section 158).

The decision of the court concerning alimony is sent over
directly to the institution, factory or plant where the defendant
works. The institution is obliged toretain the sum fixed by the
court at each‘ pay-day. _, V p _

The payment for alimony must not exceed 30% of the father’s
«earnings: in each case however thesum ofthe alimony is_fixed
according to the financial state of affairs of the mother, father
._etc, (Civil Code, from section 289). . ’ 

The relationship of parents and.children according to Soviet
laws is based only onthe interests of children." There is no trace

left of the old laws, concerning the parental power over children,-

.according,'to which the father is The powerful-; executor of his
.child_’»s destiny. *  
The Soviet Code of laws points out directly: , _ V
«The parental rights areﬂputf into effect in‘ the inte-
rests of the -children exclusively». , .

, (Code of laws on marriage and family,
section 33).

protect the chi.ldren.“lf the‘parents are cruel towards their chil-
dren they are deprived of. their parental rightsand the child is.
taken away from them‘ and is placed in a government institution
and the parents are required to- pay alimony.~ » ~ T

In disputable cases in divorces. when the question arises:
with which of the divorcing parents the children should be left,.
the court considers only the interests ofrthe children. The whole’;
situation of the child’s life with each of parents is taken into
consideration and the ‘preference is given to the one’, w-ithwhich.
the child will be better off, where he will-be- better and more.-

anxiously cared for and. get a ‘better education.”jlniipracticei when.

g If at the divorce the child is adjudged to one of the parents.
and the other is-not deprived of right to seevthe child, he may
meet him -and visit~him with thei'exception of _-cases when the
court considers such meetings to be harmful to the ‘child.

* * *

It is peculiar towthe Soviet power, that from the first days.
of its existance it attempted to put all its: principles into practice:
and endeavoured toaltver life factors rather than juridical norms.
The foundation for-wom'an’s emancipationlfin the U. S. S. R..
was the abolition of the basis of private property giving her a:
participation in industry and thus strengthening her economical.
independence.‘  ’

A guarantee for the efficacious execution of laws concerning;

‘woman’s rights is the widewinformation of women concerning;

the rights they possess. The Soviet -laws are published not only‘
with a view to meet the interests of the working people,- but.
are also expressed in a manner, which makes them easy to be
understood by all working people. ’ .

The need for a special agent between the lawiand its exe-~
cutors on the one side and the masses of working people on the:
other is brought-to a minimum.

 

 

 

_ FAMILY, AND MJARRIAGE IN THE’ U, S. SLR; _  , .;l5

For example in the majority of cases brought before Soviet
courts, as is known,there is no need of a counsel for the defence.
and the working people may defend their rights before the court.

In particular in regard to all which concernsthe family and
marriage laws all that is possible is done in order that every
woman should be well informed. Besides the everyday press,
popular, literature, posters and so on, this mission is carried out
by special «judicial Consultation Rooms» whichare introduced.

The woman who gets advice here concerningeher pregnancy’
and thecare of her baby may at the same time get all the needed
information with regard‘ to her rights and tothe manner of real"

The basicvdifference of these special judicial consultation
ro.orn's.:. as" compared to legal consultations is that they do not
work separately, but-_ are included in sthesystem of iinstitutions
for the protection‘ of motherhood and infaLnciy(and“areiintimately
connected with them. ' c o  ' 7 .

HILWOMAN IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL" LIFE

The fundamental inequality of women proceeded from their
participating unequally in social work. Women in the past only
did work which demanded no qualification and was _at the same
time both particularly hard and badly renumerated.

The actual liberation of woman (not in words but as a fact)
is possible only under the condition of her economic independence
and her complete participation in social and industrial work.

Hundreds of thousands, of new working hands were required
‘by the new socialist republic, when it entered on peaceful construc—
tion after the heavy years of civil war- . t
» The tremendous growth of socialist ‘construction in the

In the U.S.S.R. women take part on a large scale in all kinds
-of work. The total number of women employed in hired work is

5.859.100, forming approximately a third of the whole working '

class in the Soviet-State.

1) A series of laws for the protection of woman’s labour.

2) The rationalization of woman’s labour, its adaptation to
the conditions and requirements of the female constitution.

3) A widespread extension of the institutions forthe protec-
tion of children and extension also of public kitchens.

We shall enumerate the principle points which characterize
the Soviet Code of Laws for,the'protection of woman’s labour:

«The woman working in a factory who is engaged in phy-
sical labour is released from all work for a period of 8 weeks
before and 8 weeks after her confinement with full wages. If
she is an employee or worker in a mental profession her
leave is 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after her confinement».

(Code of Labour Laws," section 132).

The list of workers in mental occupations and professions who

are put on a par with manual workers in this respect (the so cal-

led leave by decree) increases every year. Typists, for instance, ste-
nographers, cashiers, saleswomen, packers, physicians, engineers,
actresses, country-school and kindergarten teachers and many
others are according to the rules laid down by the Commissariat of
Labour from the 30 of August 1930 as regards their leave by rea-
son of pregnancy and motherhood put on a par with the women en-
gaged in physical labour. ,

The pregnant and the nursing mother according to Soviet laws
has many privileges which on the one hand make it easier for the
mother to bring up the child land on the other hand increase her
economic independence during this difficult period of her pregnan-
cy and nursing of the child. '

«A woman cannot be discharged during her pregnancy
and motherhood leave. She must be reaccepted to her work.

after her leave». _
(Code of Labour Laws, section 92).

The normal growth of a child requires that he should be fed.
at the breast. Thus,

«The nursing mother in addition to the usual intervals.
of rest during work is entitled to no less than a half hour af-..

 

 

WOMAN IN ECCJNOMIC ANDSOCIAL LIFE 19

ter every 31/2 ‘hours of work. These periods of interruption‘ in
her work are counted as working time».

1 (Code of Labour Laws, section'134).:

The pregnant and nursing women have many prerogatives at“;
their service as well as in public life. For example, the pregnant or
nursing mother cannot be sent on missions (Code of Labour Laws,
section 133). No overtime work or night work is allowed for preg-
nant and nursing mothers (Code of Labour Laws, section 131). The
pregnant woman has the right to receive a railway ticket or neces-
saryinformation in Soviet offices out of turn. .

In U.S.S.R.1the mother is made economically independent by
being insured in the State Social Insurance Organization. It is '
the state organization and not the working woman that pays this
fee in its entirety.

The State protection of labour in industry sees to it that the

king woman’s health should be avoided; especially ifthe woman

is pregnant or is a nursing mother.

The executives officers in the Department for the Protection
of Labour do not exclude women from such enterprises under the
pretext of care for their health. T-hey try to make the woman’s la-
bour safe by carrying out all necessary measures for eliminating all
harm and making the work safer for women. Hence the limiting of
the application of women’s labour is reduced to a minimum, essen-
tially inevitable.

Many supervisors of state labour.protection as well as many
workers who assist them are women. This especially guarantees the
actual realization of woman’s rights in industry. .

The education of working women is‘ accomplished on a
large scale. We have here different forms of education from the ele-.
mentary liquidation of illiteracy (in factories where there are ma-

ny illiterate women from backward localities) to technical educa- '

tion from the lowest to the highest grades. .

The percentage of women students is very high everywhere:
in groups for technical education, at numerous lectures on technics,
in the workers"clubs, at the evening «Workers’ Faculties» (Rab-
facs), at Technicums and Universities. «

The raising of qualification by the supplementing of previous
training without interrupting work is the main principle of this
s stem. .

The working woman thus has the opportunity, without lea-
ving her normal work-, to become a master worker and to attain
the highest degree of technical knowledge.

 

22 WOMAN lN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE

Many women directors, many women managing great enter-
prises, many women, who have graduated as engineers, without
ceasing their regular work, bear witnessto the rightness and
the v_itality of the system adopted by the Soviet Government in
solving the problem of woman’s-labour.

* *
*

A particularly sharp change has taken place in the condition
of women in villages.

The description‘ given in the first chapter of the hard life of
women in pre-revolutionary Russia in a great measure refers to
country life. I‘

A new era has opened for the peasant woman and her child‘ '

with the reconstruction of rural economy in the U.S.S.R., and with
the organization of powerful cooperative associations (artels), uni-
fied collective farms out of the former petty parcelled out peasants’
households; with the introduction into rural economy of «sovho-
zes» (state farms), i. e. of agricultural and cattle-breeding soviet
economies (analogous to state factories in industry) and with the
mechanizing of rural economy.

During the period of the first Five Year Plan, there sprang up,
in the Soviet Union 200.000 large collective farms'(«kolhozes») and
5.000 state farms («sovhozes»), instead of the l4.000.000 petty pea-
sants’households, which had tilled the soil with wooden ploughs
and harrows.

These modern economies have been established ona solid foun-
dation of 120.000 tractors, 2.446 machine-tractor stations, agricul-
tural machines-combines and chemical manures. It is on these
lines that the U.S.S.R. is reconstructing agriculture.

Rural economy is armed with technics of a higher order. Thou- .

sands of new machines constantly appear in the fields, of which
wooden ploughs have for centuries painfully torn up the sods. Wa-
sting human labour is being replaced by collective mechanized
work. _ r - .

In rural economy machines alter the conditions of female la-
bour as thoroughly as the weaving-loom altered them in industry

in by-gone days. Awiderapplication of the kolhoz woman ’.s labour L

to all the branches of economy is thereby rendered possible.

 

‘/

.WOMAN IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE 23

Stations equipped with machines and tractors are employing
great masses of women and have considerably-raised their ‘level,
both in the sense of culture and in that of industry. The exploita-
tion of woman and her general -defencelessness in the matter of
rights in peasant economy has been done away with. As a member
of the kolhoz, a peasant woman has equal rights with her husband—_
wages being in proportion to the personal toilcontributed by
each to the common work. This toil is no longer evaluated diffe-
rently, according to sex, as was the case in old-time villages, but
according to skill in work exclusively. All available means are
being taken at the same time to improve the qu-ality of woman’s

work. There are nowadays many peasant-women who drive trac- V

tors and combines. Women are beginning to attain a-highqua1ifi-
cation in the domain of mechanized work in rural economy. Thus,
in the Ukraine, this year for instance, by the time of the spring so-
wing campaign, 16.898 kolhoz women workers had been trained as
instructresses of_brigades and as other qualified workers at cour-
ses of 3 months’duration——6. 136 of the number were tractor-dri-

vers. At the present moment, in the Northern Caucasus’, 4.000 wo-
. men are being trained to be tractor-drivers. 2.596 women have

been taught tobacco-growing and at kolhoz courses, women briga-
diers are being taught bird-rearing and cattle-breading and are
being instructed in the raising oftechnical crops. Women constitute
on an average 40% of the man-power at kolhozes and sovhozes.

0 The-reconstruction of rural economy hasunavoidably led to a
radical reconstruction of peasant-woman’s life conditions. During
working—time in brigades, in kolhozes and sovhozes public kitchens
are organized, thereby liberating peasant-women from housekee-
ping cares. «

Creches, which have spread tremendously in villages, play a
most important part in the emancipation of the peasant woman and
in the building up of her life on new lines (see chapter «Creches»).
In the new Soviet country-side woman has taken the position of one
not‘ only of equal rights with man, hers is now an honourable posi-
tion. '

«The kolhoz movement has brought to the fore a series

of remarkable and capable women, who occupy posts of lea- -

dership. »

Women have long ceased being backward and have be
come progressive. At kolhozes, women are a great power. It
is our duty to place woman_ in the foremost ranks at kolho-
zes and to utilize this power».

Stalin. (From his speech at the
All-Union Conference of kolhoz workers
1933).

The condition of woman in national minorities was a parti-
cularly hard one. » .

Regions inhabited by national minorities felt the oppression V
of the tsarist regime with peculiar severity. Before the- revolution,
they were deprived of every possibility of freely developing their
national culture and were mercilessly exploited by the Russian go-
vernment. Nearly the whole population of the national minori-
ties’ regions was illiterate; there were no schools giving instruction
in their native tongues. Proficient medical help'was almost enti-

’ rely lacking. All this lead, as a result, to great backwardness in
culture, to poverty and to an overwhelming spreading of various cu- .
taneous diseases, to eye illnesses, to syphilis and to the tremen-
dous mortality of children. _

National minorities had no rights in tsarist Russia, but the po-
sition of their women was made still more unbearable by a quan-
tity ofprohibitions, inherent to their national customs and religi-
ons which condemned woman to reclusion and made her the slave ,
of her husband, ofthe bai, the shaman (heathen priests) etc. ‘

For ages, the woman of the East‘ had appeared in the street i
only with her face covered. The tchadra (an opaque veil) and the
parandja had for centuries concealed the face of the Eastern
woman. She was a real slave. She was sold, bought and made to
work like a beast of burden. -

She was not looked upon as a human being. On her husband’s
death, a woman became the property of his nearest‘ relative, toge-

 ther with his domestic utensils and all his belongings, and her new
owner could sell her toanyone he wished to.

The law permitted a little girl of lOto be given in marriage
and naturally thereby to be maimed for life. Moreover in

were. i: r i

The October Revolution brought with it a share in  rights‘

of man to the women, belonging to national minorities and summo-
ned her to a new undreamt of life. » I

An immense work for the emancipation of woman was underta-
ken from the first years of the Revolution in the provinces with na-
tional minorities. , ” g

Hundreds of women’s clubs, kitchens, creches, obstetric
stations, etc. have been organized in these provinces.‘

All these institutions "drew the women of national minorities
in great numbers into social life. Woman has learnt to fight for the
abolition of the old laws and customs, which made a slave
of her. ‘

Tens of thousands of women Ouzbek, Turkoman, Bouriat,
Tartar, Cossack—have now been drawn into the common building up
of socialism and have taken it up with tremendous enthusiasm.

28 WOMAN IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE

The Revolution has causedaradical upheaval in the attitude
of theiworkers in general asregards labour and -in.the_ attitude of
womenin particular. _

The principle,‘ formulated by S t a l i n is quite applicable
to wom-an’s labour: ' ‘

We «Work in the U.S.S.R. is being transformped from the
dishonouring heavy burden it was considered formerly into
a matter of honour, of glory, of prowess and of pride».

Womenstand on a level with men, and, in many cases, even
occupy the foremost place among the ranks of shock-brigadeers in
industry and of the initiators and heroes of socialist competition.

L e n i n’s principle, that _ .

«Every woman cook should know how to rule the state»-
has been reflected in the U.S.S.R. in the extensive drawing in of
women into all the branches of State activity. At the present mo-
ment there are in the U.S.S.R. 113 thousand women who are juri-
men (representatives of the people at courts of law), 20 thousand of
whom are in towns and 93 thousand in villages. Women form 31%
out of the total number of jurimen; 36.220 women are members of
town councils, i. e. 25% of the total number of members; 309thou-
sand women or 20% of the total number are members of village
councils in the U.S.S.R. * 1 '

In the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, which is
the supreme governing organ, there are 185 women. There are seve-
ral women among the People’s Commissars and the Substitutes of
the People’s Commissars. "

We find more than hundred women among those who have
been rewarded with the highest insignia: the Order of Lenin or of
the Red Banner. ~ ' ' e

The life story of each of these women gives a vivid idea of the
way covered bythe working woman in the U.S.S.R. from her for-
mer defencelessness and servitude to full equality of participa-
tion in social life and public work and even in the government of
the state, according to the words of Lenin. l W

V. MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR WOMEN

I ‘ ‘

The economical and cultural upheavals which have changed
the face of the country have also lead to an important improvement

' in the health of the large masses of the population. The whole sy-

stem of health protection, organized in the U.S.S.R. on thebasis
of accessibility and gratuitous assistance has directed the health
work on the same lines. The high level of the population’s health
in the U.S.S.R. is attested by thefact that three millions of
children are born yearly in the Soviet Union, i. e. a number equal
to that in all the countries of Western Europe taken together,
although the population there is twice greater than in the U.S.S.R.

In comparison to pre-revolutionary times the general and es-
pecially the child mortality’ has markedly decreased. In Russia
before the Revolution one of every three newborn infants died in the
first year of life and approximately only a half of all new born chil-
dren survived childhood. The mortality of children under one year
of age has decreased in the U.S.S.R. in a proportion on an average
30% and in some cities it has even fallen to less than half what
it was formerly. _

Among other numerous medical institutions (hospitals, dis-
pensaries, health resorts etc.) health centers at factories and works
play an important part in strengthening the health of workers and
in particular that of women. ‘

The health center carries into effect the sanitary supervision
of the conditions of work. The necessary measures for improvement
are here elaborated and put into practice.

The health center organizes first aid at the plant and se-
cures all necessary general and special medical assistance for the

workers by agreement with hospitals, dispensaries, institutions '

and health resorts. ,
The health centers serve the working woman as well as the
working man.

 

30 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR WOMEN

The center records the women workers’ illnesses and defines
their causes. 3 ‘ '

It works out and participates in the putting into practice of
all measures directed to the improvement of the sanitary condi-

’tions of woman’s work at the enterprise.

It supervises the exact application of all laws and regulations
concerning woman’s labour.‘ ‘ S

It participates in the assignement of work to women in accor-
dance with their working powers and _in the shifting of women to
other sections of the factory if necessary as well as in giving them
easier work etc.

The health center is in contact with the consultations for wo-
men, with obstetrical hospitals, with women’s departments in
hospitals; it sends the working women there and takes- part in
assisting them.

Besides thehealtn center, the first place in the medical assi-
stance of women belongs to the consultation for women;

The consultations for women which exist both as independent
institutions and as a part of the system of dispensaries and poly-
clinics form an important item in the institutions for the medical
assistance of women. S

The consultation for women

«The consultation for women is a medical and prophy-
' lactic institution with the following objects in view:

1') medical and prophylactic assistance during pregnancy
and after confinement, as well as during gynaecolo-
gical diseases; ‘

2) advice, prophylactic information, medical measures,
with the purpose of protection the future infant;

3) participation in the work of health centers in the plan-
ning of measures protecting the working woman’s
health at the enterprise and -in the application of these
measures at consultations».

(Resolution of the Commissariat of L
Health of March l5, 1933).

The consultation for women includes the following subdivi-
sions: g

The consultation is‘i‘n permanent contact withthe obstetrical

A very important and interesting work is carried out in
rooms for sexual hygiene connected with every city consultation.
The functions of such a roomare instruction in sanitation and the
hygiene of marriage, the campaign against underhand abortion and
birth control. These «rooms» are most popular with working women
and have achieved a great success.

The consultation for women is closely connected in its
work with obstetrical hospitals, the consultation for children, the
tubercular and venereal dispensaries as well as with workers’ repre-
sentatives at pl-ants.

A part of this work, i. e. prophylactic and propaganda work is
sometimes transfered to such a health center especially at plants
where women’s labour predominates.

Obstetrical» assistance

In cities and towns of the U.S.S.R, all women are served by
permanent. special obstetrical homes (hospitals). The number of
cots in these institutions is continually increasing.

In 1914 there were on the area of the present U.S.S.R. 4.709
cots for lying-in women. In 1925, in the R.S.F.S.R. only, there

were 13.050 such cots, 7.887 in cities and towns and 5.163 in the
country. At present in the R.S.F.S.R. alone there exist 31.330 cots
for lying-in women, 18.620 in cities and towns and 12.710 in the
country. Compared to the year 1925 this represents an increase of
136% in cities and towns and of 146% in the country.

Special attention is paid in the U.S.S.R. ‘to obstetrical assistan-
ce. For the guidance of this work at the People’s Commissariat of
Health and at all regional and town (city) health departments there
have been organized specialstate boards of obstetrics with an in-
dependent budget, a staff of specialists and special instructors.

Of late in the field of obstetrical assistance not only quantita-
tive but also qualitative growth is to.be noted. Many new obste-
trical hospitals have been built and the equipment as well as the
training of the personnel has been improved.

The obstetrical hospital includes the following sections: 1) the
obstetrical, 2) the gynaecological, 3) wards for abortion, 4) wards
for pregnant women, 5) wards for children.

During her stay at the obstetrical hospital the woman is instru-
ccted in the care of newborn infants, in breast feeding and in the
post confinement care of herself. For this purpose the physician,
‘the midwife and the nurse have talks with women in the wards.They
teach them how to swaddle the infant, how to bathe him and so on.

At the mother’s dismissal from the hospital she receives the
address of the consultation for infants nearest to her home and the
advice to bring her child there in the immediate future in order
‘to show him to the doctor.

The obstetrical hospital informs the consultation about all
mothers leaving the hospital and gives their addresses’and the
«consultation sends visiting nurses («patronage sisters») to call
‘on them.

In such a way the institutions for the protection of motherhood
and infancy constantly watch with a vigilant eye over the mother
and child in order to be always at hand to assist her.

The woman is directed from one institution to another, from
the consultation for women to the obstetrical hospital, from obste-
trical hospital to the consultation for infants, from the consulta-
tion to the creche. _

Priorto the Revolution peasant-women were most unfavorably
situated as regards obstetrics. The overwhelming majority of pea»
sant women were deprived -»:of any medical help when giving birth.
They were left to the care of.ignorant midwives («babkas»). The

result of such conditions were wide spread ’women”’s illnesses of‘.

various kinds; ' _

In addition to the net of permanent obstetrical "hospitals in
villages and remote districts assistance is also carried out by ob--
stetrical centers and by travelling midwives. .

Their duties comprise the registering of all thefpregnant wo~
men in villages», -the supervising of these women “(«patron‘age») ‘as,
well as «consuvltation -and obstetrical help.

Midwivesin villages are furnished with obstetrical Tbags con--
taining all that is needed for rendering assistance to women confi-—
ned at home-. A ; p

The midwife assists personally at confinements but if there
are any complications she immediately calls in the physician from
the neighbouring hospital.

‘These measures for the protection of motherhood together with
all the other measures carried out by the Soviet Government have

considerably lowered the rate -of women’s illnesses.

Abortions in the u.s.s.R.

The policy of the Soviet Government as regards abortions is \

clearly expressed in the decree of the Government from October 18,.
1920, which we quote in full: ' '

«During the last decade the number of women who ter-
minate their pregnancy prematurely increases both with us.
and abroad.

The legislation of all countries struggles against this evil
by punishing both the woman who is guilty of abortion ‘and.
the operating physician.

 

‘i an artificial termination of pregnancy by physicians in a hospi-
tal environment. The principal aim of the above mentioned decree

MEIMCAL ASSISTANCE FOR WOMEN 35

This method of struggle has been ineffectual. Abortions
were necessarily made in secret and the women ‘very’ often
became the victim ofmercenary ignorant persons who traded
in this secret operations.

As a result 50% of womenfell ill of infections after abor-
tion and 4% of them died. , ‘ T

The workers’ and peasants’ Government realizing the
dangers of such a situation has undertaken a campaign aga-
inst secret abortions among working women.

It foresees that this phenomenon will gradually disap-
pear with the building up of socialism. '

But until now the surviving traditions of the past and the
heavy economic conditions of the present compel a good many
women to have recourse to this operation. The People’s Com-
missariat of Health and the People’s Commissariat of jus-
tice are convinced that methods of repression are completely
useless in this case. -

In order to preserve the health of women and the inte-
rests of the race from ignorant and greedy quacks these two
Commissariats decree: ‘ ‘ ,

A 1) The operation known as abortion'may be lawfully
performed free of charge in Soviet hospitals where the con-
ditions guarantee a maximum of insury.

.2) All persons who are not licensed doctors are strictly
prohibited from performing abortions. ‘ y
, 3) The midwife guilty of performing this operation is
deprived of the right of practice and is liable to punishment
by the People’s Courts of justice.

4) The physician performing abortion in the course of his
private practice with a mercenary purpose is liable to punish-
ment by the’ People’s Courts of justice». ' .

their consequences which every year gave rise to tens of thousands
of women’s deceases and crippled a countless number of women.

The decree on abortion was, supplemented by the section 140
‘of the Penal Code of Laws.

«The performance of abortion with the consent of the
mother but by persons without medical training or by per-
sonswith this training but in unsanitary surroundings is pu-
nished by a forfeiting of liberty or by compulsory labour of

— a year or by a fine up to a sum of 600 roubles.

If this operation was performed under the. above men-
tioned conditions but as a trade or without the consent of
the mother or has caused her death it is punished by forfei-
ting of liberty for a term of not more than five years».

(Penal Code of Laws. Section 140).
The Penal Code of Laws allows every woman to resort to abor-

tion but she must first pass through a consultation for women where
she is told whether there is any contraindication to abortion for her.

-The physician of the consultation having taken into consideration

the social and household conditions of the applicant tries to per-
suade her to give- up abortion and he frequently succeeds ‘in doing
so.

Abortion is permitted only during the first three months of
pregnancy.

The legislation of artificial abortion deprived it of its un-
derhand character, considerably diminishing thereby the dangers
connected with it.

The legislation controlling abortion made it possible to study .

this important phenomenon openly and thoroughly as well from the
medical as the social point of view. An obligatory registration on
special cards of the cases of abortion of all such women as had re-
ceived due permission (introduced in 1924) was useful in this re-
spect. The women entering into hospitals with symptoms of miscar-
riage (abortion out of hospital) are also registered.

An extensive statistical study of materials concerning abor-
tion in the U.S.S.R. was undertaken by the People’s Commissariat
of Health in connection with this legalisation. It led to the follo-

wing conclusions:

Free and legal abortion performed in special gynaecological
hospitals by experienced physicians has made it possible to conside-
rably reduce the complications after abortions and to liquidate al-
most entirely the mortality after abortions.

In the U.S.S.R. there is one case of death to 20.000 abortions.

In Moscow where the statistics on abortions are very exact the
proportion is of one case of death to 23.000 abortions.

The legalisation of abortion has not affected the birth-rate in

the U.S.S.R.. The number of births is constantly on a high level

of 40 pro 1.000 of population.

In other countriesiwhere a penal system as regards abortion
is applied this -system has been powerless to stop the rapid fall
of the birth-rate. ,

The annual growth of the population in U.S.S.R. is of 3 mil-
lions. '

At the same time an extensive work of enlightenment on the
question of abortion is being carried on with the purpose of ren-
dering clear the harm of abortions. Pamphlets are published on
this subject, conferences are held. Some good films have been
made and widely ‘circulated throughout the U.S.S.R. Prevention
of abortions and birth-control is carried out in the U.S.S.R. prin-
cipally at rooms for sexual hygiene at consultations. '

In this way the prescription of contraceptive means is indivi-

' dualized through being adapted to every given case. It is perfor-

med under regular medical supervision and control and thus it
has become an important agent in women’s health and in the
prevention of abortions.

V. -CVRECI-IES

The net of institutions for the protection of motherhood
and childhood began to develop from the very first days of the
;October Revolution. .

«Public dining-rooms, creches, kindergartens are the

simple means which can in reality liberate woman, dimi-

nish and make away with her inequality with man in regard
to her part in the social. production and in social life».

Lenin.

The world war, then the civil war, the blockade, the inter-
vention and the years of collapse have left a great number of
orphans and homeless children in the U.S.S.R. Thus it will be
easy to .understand why the Department for the Protection of
Motherhood and Infancy of the Commissariat of Health had to
direct its work chiefly to the organizing of the shelter (boarding)

« type of institutions such as -orphan asylums, infant homes and

:50 on. .,

But already from l922———23 a net of institutions of the part
~day type such as creches (day-nurseries) etc. began to grow rapidly.
‘The fact of the involving of millions of women in the industrial
"work of the country, especially in the course of recent years
produced a tremendous growth of the nursery type of institu-
tions.

Starting with 14 creches inherited from the pre-revolution-ary
period the Commissariat of Health at the present moment counts
creches by tens of thousands and has the care of millions of chil-
dren in‘ itscreches.

cipate more and more in production and socialist con-
struction—such is the problem at present which faces the

\

The nursery work in the U.‘S.S.R.’ recently has become
an enormous problem for the Government." It involves not
only organization of proper educational and medical care-
but the building of creches, their equipment and supply as
well. —

A special regulation of the Government from 28, V11, 1932

-in regard to the creches expresses the enormous role of creches

in the economical plan of the country and points out to the econo-
mical institutions their duties in regard to the development of
the net of creches;  . ‘
‘According to this regulation all new projects of plants and
dwelling houses must include nursery accommodations for the-
necessary number of cots. V
The financial support of the new creches as well“ as the buil-r
ding of new ones must be furnished by'the new plants or by
plants being reconstructed from their buildingfunds. ‘.

The Government regulation emphasizes the problem of sup-
ply. It makes the Central Supply Organization take the responsi-
bility for the proper supply of creches; special reserve funds must
exist for this special purpose. _

This regulation requires of the directors of plants and fac-
tories to give all possible help to the boards of creches.

The growth and improvement of the creche service rende-
red to the working women must appear as a special item in the
‘industrial financial plan of each plant and directors are respon-
*sible_for its neglect. _

Thus the nursery work in t-he U.S.S.R. has become an obliga-
-tory part of the work of each factory and plant and an indefea-
rsible part of the life of each working woman.

In order to obtain a proper differentiated guidance in this
enormous section of work the above mentioned regulation in-
troduces substantial changes in the organization of work in the
line of protection of motherhood and infancy.

Instead of the formerly Department existing for the Protec-
tion of Motherhood and Infancy, connected with all the bodies

 

 

 

   

CRECHES 43

A creche for hundred children at cotton-millat Orehovo-Zuevo.

of the health protection system two independent Departments——
the Creche Department and the Obstetrical Department--have
been established.

The Creche Department has its own budget, a power-
ful economic apparatus, the necessary number of organizers
and methodical workers, who master the technics of their
work.

The financial means for the organization and building of
creches are provided in the main by the Government.

Thus for the year 1932 alone 150 millions roubles are alloted
by the State for the nursery work in the R.S.,F.S,R, Considerame
sums were also provided by the insurance fees which every enter-
prise has to pay for its workers. . '

Besides, according to the law of the Council of the People’s
Commissars of 1927 all enterprises have to make allotments for
the support of creches, equal to 1/4% of their funds of workers

“wages. Trade-Unions give for the organization work and the

maintenance of the creches 10%‘fr.om their funds of improvement
of workers’ life conditions.

 

 

 

 

 

44 ' CRECHES

Besides ,the State, many social organizations—Cooperative so-
cieties,_«Children’s Friend»,.«The Red Cross», «The Commit-
tee of the peasants mutual help»—participate in the financial
support of the work for the protection of motherhood and
childhood. -

Only a small amount of the expenses for creches is covered
by the parents. The fees for the nursery service are established

- individually in each case depending from thebudget of the working

family. Thus according to the rates accepted by the Commissa-
riat of Health -the worker has to pay 5—— 10 roubles monthlyfor
each child fornursery service in cases where the total sum of his
month’s earnings is ‘lOO—l5O roubles. '

V In those cases when the wages of the working woman are
very low she is ‘freed from any financial obligations in regard to
the creche. p v '

«Creches have two chief problems:
1. To liberate woman from the care for her child while she
is working or studying;

2. To bring up a «healthy and strong generation with nerves-

of steel and iron muscles». (Lenin).

The entire work of the creches is built up in such a man-
ner as-to satisfy the interests of the child and his working
mother. -

The hours of the child’s stay in the creche in former -years
was determined by the length of the working day of his mother,
i. e. 8 hours. '

At present reflecting the problems of the industrial life of
the country the creches have started to offer still greater service
to the working woman. Thus in most of the creches in the U.S.S.R.
thechild can stay from morning till evening which makes from
10 to ll hours a day. V

Experience has shown that the long-day creches give bet-
ter results in the physical development of the -children.

But for some categories of working women, for example for
those in the transport and telegraph service, conductors and others
in the U.S.S.R. areorganized special twenty four hour creches

where the child spends both day and night and it is only on her
days of rest that the mother takes him home. I 

 

CRECHES - 

Under these circumstances the mother is allowed not only
to work but to study as well as to rest after her working day which
certainly is very important.

The creche is an institution of a day type. The Soviet system
for the protection of motherhood and infancy has no intention
whatever of separating the child from his family. On the contrary
the intimate relationship with his parents is considered as an impor-

tant element in the right education of the child.

Till 1928 the development of the nursery movement was based
principally on the utilisation of already existing buildings and
their accommodation to ‘nursery work._ _

Of late years the construction of new special buildings for
-creches has spread widely. For example 78 creches were built
from 1931 to 1932 in Moscow and the Moscow region. ' ’

The Research Institutes are performing a great work in con-. '

-nection with the projecting of new special buildings for creches.
«Creches are built usually for 60 or 100 children. Creche construction
“work has hygienic and pedological -principles as its foundation.

It is ,well known fact that children during the fisrt three

years of their life are frequently subject to different infectious

diseases which usually at that age take a very severe form. §pecial

-consideration when erecting nursery buildings is given to this
fact. All possible measures are made for avoiding the spreading
of infections. For this ‘puprose children are divided into small
groups of 12— 15 children in each and for each of these groups spe-
»cial isolated flats within the nursery building are projected.

The creches for 60 cots are in fact four independent creche‘
:nuclei; those for 100 cots—six of these nuclei, which are united

under one roof by having one economical management and medi-

-cal guidance.

The appartment for each group of children has a separate

jg-entrance door and has the following arrangements: the reception
room with a cloak room for mothers and a toilet for the person-
nel, the play room,*the bed room, the children’s toilet room.
.A verandah adjoins the play room.

48 " CRECHES

Daily shower-bath after the child’s arrival at the creche.

In some of creches the reception room and the toilet room are
planned for two neighbouring groups as experience has shown
that this facilitates the work of the personnel especially during
the hours of reception and departure.

The above described appartemnet represents a fundamental
"item of a creche which may be repeated according to the number
of cots of the given creche.

Each group has also its playground.

According to the accepted plan each nursery item has a sepa-
rate entrance door, but the rooms of each group are connected by

 

 

CRECHES 49

means of an inner communication with the kitchen, laundry and
-other household departments. - .

‘ Large creches are always built with a special isolator for sick
children planned approximately for 10 cots -if the total number
‘of children is one hundred. An isolator is a specially equipped buil-
iding adjoiningthe main nursery building. It has a separate entran-
ce door from the street. It is built in order to take care of the
V-children with light contagious diseases such as skin diseases,
bronchitis etc. '

In cases when a serious infection appears in one of the groups
the sick child is ‘immediately sent home or to the hospital. The
rest of the children of the group may be entirely isolated in their
separate nursery appartment if they arein. a modern creche. In
such cases the meals are brought from the kitchen through the
entrance door and the inner doors connected with the household
‘rooms are completely closed. .

With,the same purpose in View it is proposed that each group
should have its own plates and cups etc. which are kept in the

- 4

 

 

 

50 CRECHES

cupboards of the group and are washed up after each meal im
the group room.

Besides these separate nursery appartments each nursery buil--
ding has a doctor’s reception room, an office, a room for clean
linen and a room for dirty clothes, a kitchen, store room etc.

In planning a city block with a population of 2500———3000-

people a creche for one hundred children must always be included
in this plan. Every effort is made to locate the nursery building
in the best place so that the verandah and the children’s rooms,
should have a southern exposure.

The best plan is to construct nursery buildings of one storey..
But such a plan is more expensive. This is the reason why large:
creches (for 100 children) are being built to a twogstories plan in
which the older children occupy the top floor and the small ba-~
bies the lower floor.

Each morning the child is examined by the trained nurse
——she measures his temperature, examines his throat, his skin
and asks his mother whether there are any sick children at home..

 

 

 

CRECHES 51

I

Working mothers comingfto suckle their infants at the creche every

three hours. The mother sitting to the left is affected with a

cold; therefore her face in order to preserve the child is covered
with a veil.

The child’s underclothes and dress are taken off and put in
an individual locker. A wrap is“put arround the child and he is
taken to the toilet room where the older children get the shower-
bath and the babies are bathed. ‘

After that the children are dressed in the nursery underwear
and dresses they are taken to their groups. Meals, afternoon sleep,
and walks are items of a creche program. A

The child takes his afternoon nap in the fresh air in the
garden, the yard or on the verandah. The children sleep out
of doors not only in summer but in winter as well, in warm
sleeping bags.

The regime of the children’s life in creches tries to be as
near possible to the regime of open air institutions.

For the summer some of the creches take their children to the
country so that they may rest from the city noise.

In summer the children are given sun-baths and shower-baths
in the open air.

ples inoculations according to Deckwitz).

Great attention is paid in creches to the educational work,
to the children’s acquiring from an early age a cheerful, collective,
materialistic attitude towards the surrounding world.

Creches are trying to bring up active independent children
cacustomed to work and to respect the work of others. The nurse

do not help the child when he is able to do anything himself and
in every way they try to develop his independence.

Besides participation in organized games children are allowed
to play freely,,their creative activities are emphasized, The mate-
rials of creches are: different toys, blocks, equipment for out doors
play such as wheel-barrows, shovels etc., drawing ‘materials,
paper, crayons etc. =

Creches give children a collective social education in order
to teach the child how to act conjointly in the interests of their
little society. The children are taught to help each other, the older
children help the younger ones as well as each other during the
undressing period, at play and so on.

The creche tries to give children materialistic attitude with
regard to their surroundings and natural phenomena. Children
do not hear any fantastic stories in creches. The nursery teacher
tries to make them better acquainted by direct observation with
the sequence of natural phenomena. ‘

56 CRECHES

First steps of education in art. Music period at creche.

Nursery education tries to lay a basis for a future materiali—-

stic conception of life in the period of early childhood.

Creches train the children to acquire the necessary hygienic"
habits (health habits)—-to wash their hands before their meals,
to clean their teeth, to say when they need to go to the toilet etc...

The managers ‘of the Qreches usually come from the field of

industry and are working women who have the entire confidence»

and respect of the workers. They are responsible for the organi-
zation and the economical side of the work in the creches.

Each creche has besides a pediatrist who is responsible for
the medical and educational work with the children. At the large-
creches the physician has two assistants——the medical nurse and’
the teacher (instructor). Trained nurses are responsible for the:
physical care of the children. These nurses get assistance in their
work from the maid nurses who also do cleaning up work in the

building.

The sanitary educational work of the creches could not be:
considered complete if it was only limited to the influence to which
the child is subjected during the hours that he spends in the creche._

68 A CRECHES

Children’s acquaintance with the labour of adults stimulates their
active interest invvit.

Creches therefore feel it their duty to improve home environ-
ment so that family could bring up the child in the right way.
‘The ways of attaining this_aim are not very complicated.

First of all the nurse (educator sister) visits the home of the
child. In her talks with the child’s relatives she points out what
is lacking in their education of the child and gives advice how to
‘improve environment and what to do in the existing surroundings
-for favourable development of the child.

Secondly, the creches are carrying out a great work of parental
~education——meetings in creches take place regularly. At these
‘meetings reports are made by the physician or by the creche ma-
nager. Education, care of children or an account of the creche work
are usually the topics of these reports; the problems of the nursery
work are discussed with parents and decisions are made with
regard to the measures for improvement.

Creches organize mothers’ help in taking turns for duty,
«during which a mother gets well acquainted with the work which
is going on in the creche and usually offers her possible help.

 

 

 

 

CRECHES   59

of a nurse.

The parents elect representatives for the creche council.
The representatives from the plant committee of factories and
works directly connected with the creches and benefiting by their
:service are also sent to this council.

In this way the intimate relationship of the creches with the
producing and social organizations is effected and these in their
turn give their attention and care to the creches.

Creches on state and collective farms.

It is but a short time ago that the institution of creches hadto
aloe zealously advocated in the country, but at present kolhoz wor-
king women understand of themselves that without creches work is
‘very difficult for women. The need of creches is felt most acutely
«during the field work incident on sowing, weeding and gathering
in the harvest etc. It is not without reason that the network of
creches is so rapidly extending in kolhozes and sovhozes (collective
and state farms).

60 C R ECHES

Children watering their flowerbeds.

In 1928,there were 251.000 cots at temporary summer creches,
in 1932——4.529.000, and in 1933 it is proposed to have 5.000.000
creches in villages. ‘ 

The network of permanent creches is relatively insignificant
at kolhozes and sovhozes: 3217.674 cots in 1932. This kind of creches
increases in number principally at sovhozes, whereas at kolhozes,
there is a violent growth of the network of temporary creches,
functioning approximately 6 months, during the entire cycle of"
field-work. ' r

In the future an extensive organization of permanent creches.
at kolhozes will doubtless take place.

The best houses in kolhozes are usually allotted to creches and:
pains are taken to adapt them to the purpose proposed; the
adjoining garden is tidied up, and the premises and playgro~

und arranged with a view to children’s comfort. Village schools,
closed for summer vacations are often used for creches in
summer. ‘ »
The functioning of creches is closely connected with the-
period of kolhoz work: temporary creches begin functioning dawn
and close when field-work is over. ' ‘ _ V '

At village-creches as well as at those of towns, "a proper re--
gime for children is established and educational work carried out
with them. ’ . . r

Even long before a creche is opened considerable selfhelpful
public activity makes itself felt around it. The kolhoz women them-
selves organize a creche commission, attached to the village soviet.

Harvest. Travelling field creche of a collective farm.

Of late years, simultaneously with ordinary creches, a new
;and very useful kind of creches has appeared at kolhozes and sov-
hozes, i. e. transportable field creches for the service of the mo-
ither in fields, on the very spot of her work. During harvest‘ and
in some kolhozes, during the weedipg campaign, mothers have
-to work at a considerable distance from their homes and some-
timesto remain in the fields for several days running. During this
period a nursing mother. cannot come to the creche several times
.a day to suckle’ her child and at the same time, it is during the

hot summer months, that it is most important to keep the child.

‘to a diet of breast-milk.

Feeding at the breast is one of the principal means of com-
bating children’s summer diarrhea and the mortality of children.
_A childfs being deprived of milk at the breast in summer may
lead to his falling severely ill and his mother can have no peace
of mind at her work, when she knows that her» child is suffering
from not. having suitable feeding.

In order to give a nursing mother the possibility of devoting

The protection of motherhood and childhood is one of the ‘

consequences resulting for the child, creches are brought up to
the spot where the mother is working. Travelling creches, follo-W
wing the mother as she moves from one plot of land to another are
organized. The service of the nursing mother, as she worked on her‘
own strip of land in an individual peasant household—was.

state and collective farms.

Thanks to travelling creches, women’s labour is being fully‘
and widely utilized in kolhozes and sovhozes. These travelling;
creches are arranged in small vans 011 wheels (like railway carria--
ges or luggage vans) and are drawn by horses or tractors.

When mothers work on the same spot for IO——- 15 days or"
more, summer buildings, wihich are to be found in many places
in fields, are used for creches. in the absence of a van.

CRECHES

 

 

68 CRECHES

In the central region_ of the R.S.F.S.R. tarpaulin tents for
field creches-are used for this purpose. They are less suitable"-for
the south, as the air in them is sometimes apt to be very stifling,
which is pernicious for nurselings’ health.Tents in the south are
replaced by movable awnings. 3 

Travelling creches accommodate only 10-15 nurselings and
older children are not admitted tothem. Creche commissions; at
kolhozes carefully register all nursing mothers and try to enroll
them in the same brigade and to appoint them for work to the
same spot in order to make accommodating them easier.

, Field creches are not independent institutions. They‘ are affi-
liated to permanent or temporary kolhoz creches, from which
they get their training and under whose guidance they remain.

The kolhoz creches are the medical and economical headquar-

ters of the field-creches—-it is here that their linen is washed and
it is from here that they get their food supplies etc. '
Field creches, during the period when they function, become
the center of all the work of motherhood and infancy protection
in the kolhoz brigade. The matrons of the creches endeavouri to
obtain better working conditions for nursing mothers and impro-
ved nutrition for them. The dinner interval and time of evening
rest are sometimes utilized by the sisters of the creche for talks

with mothers on the care of motherhood and infancy. Creches are ,

provided with exhibitions and popular literature, concerning the
‘protection of motherhood and childhood.

The table shown below illustrate the immense spreading of
the network of creches in national minority regions during recent
years. At the outset the women of these provinces had a deep mis-

trust of creches and would have nothing to do with russian pedia-

trists, but this has now been almost entirely overcome.

It is mostly their own women who work in creches as nurses
and sisters, after having been trained at short term courses
and medical technicums. Of late years, a considerable number
of women-doctors, natives of provinces of national minorities

'have graduated from the higher medical schools and have been

sent to work for the protection of motherhood a_nd infancy in
their native countries. -

U.S.S.R. They play an important part in the struggle with
" child mortality and” in "reducing the rate of children’s illnesses.
They have become the main centers of instruction on breast feeding
and on the’ practical teaching of mothers how to nurse their chil-
dren. ‘
T Inthe pre-revolutionary days Russia had the highest infant
death rate in any civilized country. An exceptionally low ‘level
of culture among women, their living under heavy handicaps,
the prevalence of prejudices and superstitions of an order very
harmful for infants’ health, as well as insanitary conditions and
customs—-such were the reasons of this appalling death rate.
\ After the civil war, the intervention and the blockade economi-

dard oflife among workers, especially as regards women and chil-

This decrease attained 30% in the whole Union. In some towns

But an important part was also played by the consultations
’:for children. Their purpose was to improve and to make more hygie-
.nic the feeding_and nursing of infants.

At the outset the‘ consultations were organized for the prophy-
lactic treatment of healthy children. Subsequently their functions
‘were extended. At present the consultations have become centers
of every kind of medical and prophylactic assistance for young
children.

Consultations are under the direction of the Board of creches - 
‘of the district Health Section. The activities of a consultation are 
limited to a given territorial quarter. All the children of the dis-
trict under four years of age are registered. The district is divided

into sections with 400——500 children. A physician (a pediatrist)
with a nurse as his aid is at the head of each section. They are
responsible for all prophylactic and_medical assistance to these:
children. The physician of a given section receives children at the-
consultation.» He also renders assistance at home when needed.
The consultation strives to ensure assistance for the child con-
stantly from the same doctor who has known him at all stages of
age, development and health.

Consultations are very popular in the U.S.S.R. Usually
mothers with newborn infants come of themselves to the consul-
tation. If not, the visiting nurses («patronage sisters») after the
visit to the home of the infant request the mother to come to the
consultations and here these infants are taken under medical
supervision. ’ « ’

The consultations in addition to the medical history and;
development of the child has a card-index of all the children of
its district. The district registry office (ZAGS) informs the consul-

of children’s illnesses and mortality.

Special attention is paid at the consultation to the recordingj:

Of late years an aurist, a throat and nose specialist, an ocu—~
list, a neuropathologist, and sometimes also a surgeon and a.
specialist in skin-diseases besides the pediatrist of the quarter‘
are added to the staff of the consultation. The consultations thus:
gradually are transformed into real district polyclinics for young;

children.

Many consultations have also rooms for physiotherapeutics.

where children receive systematic physio-electro-hydro-treatment,
gymnastics, massage and so on.

The greater number of consultations occupy old buildings
and it is obvious that they are quite inadequate for their new
purpose. It is too difficult to adjust them to the complicated prob-
lems of the new dispensaries for children. It is only in these lat-
ter years that the construction of special buildings for children’s
consultations has begun. They are sometimes in special separate
buildings and sometimes they form part of a large polyclinic.

The outstanding feature of these newly erected buildings
is the providing of a separate service for healthy and sick children.
Each department has separate. entrance with a so called «filter»,
i. e. a selection room.

The prophylactic and polyclinic departments have only an
‘interior communication with each other; every child which is
‘beingtaken to the consultation must pass through the «filter»
where a medical nurse examines the child from the standpoint of
infection. .

I. WOMAN AND CHILD IN PRE-REVOLUTIO-
NARY RUSSIA

In order to understand the extent of. the upheaval brought

about in the position of thewoman by the October Revolution,
a knowledge of the facts, connected with the position of wor-
king woman prior to thexrevolution must first be obtained.
A L e o T o 1 st o i,- the great Russian writer, in his celebra-
ted play of «The Power of Darkness», thus characterizes the
condition of a Russian woman in theend of XIX-th century in
the words of the peasant Mitritch:

«What is a peasant woman? Nothing but trash. They
are all as blind as moles. They know nothing. A peasant
woman_(a baba) has neither seen nor heard anything.
A man may'learn as he meets others casually in a tavern
or perchance, in jail or if he serves in the army. But what
can you expect of_ a woman? Does anyone teach her? The
only one who ever teaches her is a drunken moujik, when
he lashes her with the reins—that is all the teaching she
gets». .

The Russian poet N eik r a s o v speaks of_ the fate‘ of
a peasant woman as follows: , V »

«Oh, thou russian fate,

Oh,- the fate of woman!

Can a harder be found?

Small wonder thou fadest untimely,
Thou long suffering mother

Of the all enduring Russian race».

The defenceless position of woman in the eye of the law
in tsarist Russia was eloquently expressed in; the -entire legis-
lation, as well as in the manner in which justice and’ admini-
stration were exercised-in the empire of the tsars.

On the _‘‘contrary, boxes do not exist ‘in departments for the
healthy children. The work here is mostly that of an infant wel-‘
fare center. or of an exhibition in the care of children. Its program
of regular supervision“ includes instructing mothers in. infant
hygiene, breast feeding;__ nursing and up bringing. I

The consultation in the U.S.S.R. is closely connected with the
creches of the given >distr"ict. First and foremost of all it provides
creches with medical assistance. The specialists of the consulta-
tion systematically supervise affiliated to a given consultation cre-
ches. In special cases "these physicians visit sick children at the
creche or at home. The creche and the district consultation inform
each other reciprocally with the greatest speed of every case of
contagious illness in order to take necessary measures.

All children at creches as well as at consultations are subjec-
ted to obligatoryvaccination and to antidiphtheria inoculations.
Antimeasles inoculations are also used on a large scale. They are
carried out according to the Deckwitz method, by the use of the
blood serum of adults. This method has won full recognition in the
U.S.S.R. When rightly used the results ‘are very good.

As mentioned above (see chapter II on marriage) the consul-
tation for children i_n the U.S.S.R. often has a legal department
for mothers known as «a Judicial Consultation Room» atta-'
ched to it. , . i

Mass health measures for the protection of
childhood in the work of the consultation

The consultations not only serve children by medical assi-
-stance, their purpose is also to reform the way of life in their dist-
rict, to carry out extensive sanitary measures among children not
yet enrolled in creches.

One of these widespread measures is the organization of nurse-
try groupsfor walks; as well as that of children’s playgrounds in
courtyards, green squares and boulevards. From eight to ten
.-children form a group under the supervision of a mother on duty

The experience of consultations in Moscow has proved that

such groups for walks are easily arranged ‘and very useful measures-
They are of great health and education value. Children are taken

out into open regularly. They have the opportunity of playing coo—-

peratively. Thus the mothers are free for some hours which they
may spend for their housekeeping, their studies or their participa-
tion in social life and so on.

The groups for walks are only the first link in the matter of

cooperation of the population. They providethe opportunity of"

children’s cooperative education. With the aid of the consultation

these groups are easily transformed into nursery playgrounds, where»

children remain all day. These playgrounds are under the direc-
tion of nursery teachers, sent by the Board of Creches. They are
attached to a creche or to a kitchen station which supplies them
with food.

All day long the children remain out of doors in the
courtyard, garden or green square. They dine in some room
of the house committee or in the room of the mother who is
on duty. _

After such an experience the benefit of such institutions is'ob--
vious to the mothers. They thus become active partisans for the
organization of temporary playgrounds and permanent creches at-
tached to the houses they live in. ' ‘

Consultations by drawing housewives into the organization
of groups for walks and of playgrounds contribute to making
women cooperate in organizing permanent infancy institutions
under the control of the Board of Creches of the District Health

Department. A

Thus the consultation not only achieves the important pur-
pose of the medical care of children and the fortifying of their
‘health but it has also become a powerful weapon in the organizing
«of children’s collective education.

A great number of mothers who are interested in the work of
consultation gather around it. Systematic work is carried out with
them; they are instructed in the rearing of children. The consulta-
tion aims at forming a special public body of these mothers—a coun-
.ci1 of assistance to the consu1tation.This council of assistance is
of great value because it connects the consultation with the workers
of the plants served by it and with the various social organizations
of the district. Apart of these mothers became students of courses
of short duration, organized by the consultation in order to
train teachers for playgrounds and so on. *

In this way a permanent influx of new workers for mass sani-
tating activity is secured and they are trained theoretically and
practically by the consultation itself.

The struggle for children’s health is no longer limited to the
institutions for children or even to the home. It has been transferred
to courtyards, boulevards and green squares, where children not yet
enrolled in creches very often remain for many hours without su-
pervision. '

Last spring educational work with children not enrolled in cre-
ches was done on many Moscow boulevards. This year a radical reor-

ganization of this work has been carried out. Special wading pools,

shower baths, children’s toilets and gymnastic apparati are to

Assistance for women and children on
roads and ways of communication

' The sanitary assistance of women and children when travel-
ling is an important problem especially under the conditions of
the U.S.S.R., where the area is so immense and where the journey
sometimes lasts many days and evenweeks. Such a long journey is
harmful for the child.

Of late with the increase of traffic connected with the huge:
amount of new construction going on on the outskirts of the Union
the problem of serving the travelling work-people has acquired im-
portance. The attention of the central organizations of the govern-
ment is constantly drawn to this problem.

The old railway stations and landing places are being repai-
red, new ones arebeing built. Last year at all the Moscow rail-
way stations special waiting rooms for mothers with children"‘have
been organized.. Their area is approximately equal from" a fourth
to a fifth of the whole" area of the station. Th_ese rooms are under
the control of the Protection of Motherhood and Infancy. A ‘peculi-
ar kind of institutionsifor the care of travelling women and "child-
ren have been organized here. _ I  '_ 

Every passenger with a child may enter such a «R.00..m f01’

consultation through a «Filter», ’i.- e. a selection room. Here me-

'dical nurses examine children before. their entrance into the wai-

ting room in order to prevent‘ the spreading of contagion».

’ Sick children remain in special isolation rooms, in so called
'«boxes»‘ with their mothers and necessary assistance is provided
for them. Healthy children enter into reading rooms, children’s
bedrooms etc. The mother and the child may wash themselves,
have a bath (special toilets and shower baths for children have
been organized at all Moscow ‘railway stations).

They have the opportunity of having rest or of usefully spen-
ding the time they are obliged to pass at the railway station,
because of a change. These institutions also serve the mothers with
children by giving them possibility of buying a ticket without
waiting for their turn and by making them travel more comfortably.

Recently at all the Moscow railway stations their buffets have
‘organized special feeding for children. Babies receive cereal, milk,
kissel (a jelly-like dish made of farina, fruit-juice and sugar) and
other dishes, which they consume in the «Room for the mother and
the child» or afterwards in the car (railway carriage).

Older children may have a dinner at a reduced price.

The Moscow experience served as a model for other cities and
towns. At present such institutions for the protection of motherhood
and childhood exist at a hundred and twenty large railway sta-
tions in the U.S.S.R. .

The waiting rooms for mothers with children are under the
direct control of the creche administration attached to Railway

~ Health Department. These institutions are open during twenty

four hours. Physicians, nurses and educators are on service there.

are such statements as the following:

«A wife is boundwto obey her husband in’ all things and
in no wise to be insubordinate to his authority».

(Section 107, Civil Code, vol. X).

A woman could not take any working situation without
her husband’s leave. _
«Wives cannot be hired for work anywhere without

their husband’s permission».

(Section 2202, Civil Code, vol. X).

According to the law on, passports, a woman could have
no separate passport her name being inscribed on that of her

special application and with her husband’s permission. A wife
who had escaped might be brought back by her husband with

the help of the police as a transported convict (Code of Laws.

From the chapter on passports).

Marriage was thus for a woman a heavy joke, making her
entirely subservient to her husband’s will.

To crown all, the law on divorce in tsarist Russia left to
women almost no outlet of escape from the control of even -an
unloved, odious husband. V A

According. to tsarist laws an arbitrary dissolution of mar-
riage by common consent was in no case allowed. ,

Even though one of the parties, should confess to having
infringed «the holiness of wedlock», this was not considered suf..
ficient evidence. Eyewitnesses were required to confirm the fact

 that conjugal fidelity had been violated and only after this could

either party begin a tedious and humiliating suit for divorce.

CONSULTATIONS FOR CHILDREN 87

Children’s dinner in the room of the mother and the child at the Briansk-
railway station in Moscow.

Such a car provides the following facilities: the toilet has been
enlarged—two passenger places being reduced; there is a shower
bath for children, a basin for washing swaddling clothes, an elec-
tric special cupboard for dryingchil’dren’s linen in. An ice chest
for milk and children’s food is also a part of the equipment of
such a car.

In trains covering long distance, as, for example, from
Leningrad to Vladivostock» (twelve—fifteen days) one com-
partment is used as the children’s nursery for their play and
occupations.

The most important convenience of such a car is a special

/accommodation for children’s sleep——a hanging cot which is
adjusted for the night beside the sleeping place of the adult.
Thus the mother has the possibility of rest and the baby of
quiet sleep.

These cars for mothers and children are closely connected with V

the railway s-tation’s rooms’ for mothers with children which fur-

VII. PRESCHOOL INSTITUTIONS
(For children from 4 to 7 years of age)

:Although the institutionsfor children of 4 years and upwards I‘
are not like creches and other institutions _for early infancy under’
the control of: the Commissariat of Health but of that of People’s.

Education,the organization of the medico-sanitary part in preschool.
institutions and in schools, direction and ordering of all their‘
educational work in this respect still wholly belongs to the Com»
missariat of Health.

and’ schools is also under the control of the Comlmissariat of Pu--

Preschool education in Russia was one of the weakest links in.
public education before the Revolution. In 1913 there were only’
about 200 institutions for it in the whole country.

Immediately after the Revolution, a rapid growth of kinder--
gartens and other preschool institutions set in; they numbered
thousands even in the first years of Soviet power, which were-.

‘ those of civil war. But the growth of national economy in town.

and country, the entering upon the reconstructive period called‘.

for a still greater extension of the -preschool net as well as of‘

that of creches.
The growth of the number of children enrolled into the preschool.
institutions of the U.S.S. R. is given in the following figures:

The growth of preschool educationiwhich the first Five Year 0

Plan had in view has not on-ly been achieved, but has been carried
«out in an eight or nine fold measure—thus, by the end of thefirst
_Five Year Plan (1932), 500.000 children were to have been enrol-
-led in the R. S. F. S. R., whereas in reality their number exceeded
four millions. _ _ '

By the end of the second Five Year Plan period in 1937, the
-number of children benefiting bythe service of educational institu-
-tions must reach in the R. S. F. S. R. a figure of 10,5 millions.

In progressive districts of the Union an enrollment of all
preschool children has nearly been completed. In Moscow even
‘by the end of the year 1932 preschool institutions had absorbed
90% of all the children of workers, and in the Ural "industrial
?centers—.—75%. . r * , .

Among the public organizations rendering help in the work
«of education and of improvement of sanitary conditions for pre-
rscool children a prominent place has been taken bythe preschool
ucooperation, which has considerably grown of late. Many mil-

"lions of parents have been drawn into the work of preschool educa- .

tion, especially mothers, who take this task to heart and consider
it to be of the greatest importance. It is to public assistance and
:.support that the rapid growth of preschool education is due.
In the year 1932 upwards of 70.000 kindergarten teachers were
‘trained at courses of short duration and in 1933 upwards of 80.000
“will be trained in the R. S. F; S. R. alone. '

For all this, the following well—tested methods in use for
public work in masses in the U. S. S. R. have been extensively
.-applied: that of socialist competition among
«different enterprises, towns, regions and districts, of a p re -
rschool campaign-——asapartofthegeneral cultural

»c a m p a i g n and finally that of the All-Union p r e s c h o o l

estafette

These methods have made it possible to extend the network
of preschool institutions considerably and to involve large masses
of the urban and rural working population in social work for the
improvement of preschool education.

Preschool institutions are of varied types including:

a) the kindergartens without boarders;

ren’s institutions in the foreground. Children’s playground on the roof.

b) the kindergartens with boarding section;

c) the children’s rooms attached to clubs;

(1) the children’s rooms attached to the schools for adults
(for the mothers who are studying);

e) children’s playgrounds out of town and in town: in court-
yards, on boulevards, in green squares, in parks; T

f) children’s homes for orphan preschool children.

The rapid growth of preschool institutions and the trans-
ition to general preschool education called for greater care for
them on the part of the Commissariat of Health, and first and
foremost, for an increase in the number of physicians enrolled in
their service.

The business of a doctor serving in a preschool institution
comprises:

In case there is not a sufficient number of doctors, attached
to preschool institutions for the fulfilment of the more important
functions and in particular for the supervision of the institution’s
sanitary state, other physicians such as pediatrists, sanitary and
district physicians are drawn into the work. Besides the imme-
diate assistance rendered by physicians on the spot sick children
can be sent for treatment to medical institutions——polyclinics and
hospitals or to specialchildren’sdispensaries if such are available.

The rules elaborated by the Commissariat of Public Health
for the life of permanent preschool institutions and introduced as
obligatory ones by the People’s Commissariat of Education contain,
among others, the following regulations:

PRESCHOOL INSTITUTIONS

Children’s playground in the park of culture and rest.

The time of the child_ren’s coming to kindergartens
should correspond, as far as possible, to the time at which
their parents_ leave home for their work. One of the teachers
should be early on duty for the reception of children. '

In cases when the family cannot insure the children’s-
coming punctually to the kindergarten, night groups should.
be organized so as to ensure the child’s having its normal.
night sleep. - V

The length of time fixed for each organized occupation
depends on the character of the work and on what it consists
and lasts: A

For the eldest group~(6—-7 years old) not n1ore as 30—35 min.
For the middle (5-6 years old) not more as 20—25 min.
For the youngest (4——5 years old) not more as l5——20 min.

The duration of conversation periods (10—l5 minutes),
excursions, self-help, etc. are also regulated. The intervals

between meals should not exceed 3-4 hours. After dinner‘

rest ‘is obligatory, i. e. sleep during 11/2-2 hours including

the getting ready for sleep and the getting up. V
