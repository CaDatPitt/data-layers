MIAMI, Ariz.—Hopes of the
Steel rai-ders to establish a foot-
hold in the Southwest were

V-blasted here last week in two

election victories by Miami
Miners Union, Local 586, Mine-
Mill. f -

At Mia-mi Copper Company, Steel
was“ defeated by 343 to 175. At Int’l
Smelting & Refining Company (Ana-
conda), the raiders were beaten 68
to 21. .

Agents of Phil Murray’s “Steal”
union, as it was known here, had been
in Miami for more than a year. They
spent many thousands of dollars on
publicity, payrollers and beer.- They op-
erated on the assumption that workers
could not resist the cry of “red!” As a
result of the raiding campaign, most of
the workers in Miami now understand
the anti-union nature of red-baiting.

President Leo Terrill of Local 586

expressed the conviction that “Steal”

is washed up in the Southwest. “Now

. that we won these elections by good

majorities," Terrill said, “we are in a
strong position as we go into negotia-
tions.”

The Mine-Mill locals here and in
nearby Hayden had the assistance of
vice-president Orville Larson, whose
home is in Miami, as well as board
member C. D. Smothermon, regional di-
rector Bill Gately, Int’l Reps. Bob Bar-
con and Howard Mooney and Morry
Wright of the Press and Education
dept. ' .

HAYDEN, Ariz.—-Raiders of

the AFL were snowed under here -

last week by a vote of 106 to 6.
This was the result of an NLRB
vote by workers at the AS&P.
smelter, organized in Mine-Mill
Local 886. .

.“We don’t know what made
AFL disrupters think they could
divide the members of this local
union,” said ‘President Ben Alba.
“We know how we have im-
proved our lives with Mine-Mill,
and we know that the AFL is no
good for us.” _

Less than a week before the
election date, May 28, the AFL
tried to withdraw from the elec-
tion. Mine-Mill refused to permit
the withdrawal, because this
would have left the AFL free to
renew its disruption during con-
tract negotiations.

Int’l rep. Art Flores assisted
the local union in the pre-election
period.

CONTINENTAL OIL

BUTTE, Mont.—Workers at the Con-
tinental Oil Go. here have accepted a
voluntary wage increase offer from
the company amounting to 5 cents an
hour. The Conoco workers are members
of Butte Stationary Engineers Union

West coast NMU raid

falls flat on its face

SAN FRANCISCO —- The raid of
Joseph Curran’s National Maritime
Union against the Marine Cooks -&
Stewards has fallen flat on its face
here. '

The National Labor Relations Board
has thrown out the NMU petition for
an election, holding that NMU failed
to obtain enough signed cards to war-
rant scheduling an election.

The decision came as members of the
Marine Cooks union walked off an
estimated 130 ships here and in other
ports to protest the NLRB’s delay in
acting on the NMU-CIO petition. MCS
had charged the NLRB “with deliber-
ately stalling to hinder pending ne-
gotiations.”

  After more than seven months,
E-Z strikersstill out to win

HANOVER, N. M. — More than a
half-year on the picketlines and still out
to win. That’s the story of the 90 fami-
lies on strike here since Oct. 17 at the

" lead-zinc mine and mill of the New Jer-

sey (Empire) Zinc Co.

Years of inferior working conditions
and’ company slavedriving led the work-
ers_ to press for a new deal last fall. A
dozen meetings between the union,
Local 890, and management resulted in
zero. New Jersey Zinc, one of the big-
gest outfits in the‘U.S., offered only the
routine raise but refused to discuss con-
tract improvements already‘ set in the
district at other properties.-

A major demand of the workers ‘was

-for portal-to‘-portal pay and paid holi-
days, standards already won by other-

Local 890 members. But not only did
the company say “No,” it also‘ claimed
unions have no right to raise such ques-
tions, pointed out Clint J encks, who re-

cently retired as Local 890 president in

order to join the International union
staff.

quez, a young veteran with three de-
pendents and another child on the
way put it this way: .‘‘I f Empire Zinz
thinks its workers have nothing to say

.. about their working conditions, theg/ll

wait,a hell of a longtime to have us
produce their are.” ,

Despite all the company efforts to
break the strike, the workers are stick-

ing to their union. Until Mine-Mill or- T

ganized the Silver City mining district,
the majority of the workers, who are
Mexican-Americans, -had little to live
for. The area is still known as "the
“meanest for discrimination in New
Mexico,” a reputation established by the
giant mining corporations, which ex-
tract fortunes from the earth in copper,

’ lead and zinc.

Kennecott, ‘Phelps-Dodge, Illinois Zinc,
American Smelting & Refining, U.S.
Smelting & Refining and ‘New Jersey

' Zinc dominate the landscape, but not“

the union. Local 890 has a reputation,

‘too. It is known as among the most vig-
orous and progressive organizations in
the southwest, as a fighter for equality

for Mexican-American workers.
,The determination to win is even

‘stronger among the strikers than last
i October when the walkout started. They

realize that New Jersey Zinc is out to

break. their union and theit strike; just
as it has broken every strike that tried
to challenge management’s theory of
“we know what is best for our workers.”

However, this policy crossed itself up
when a new superintendent was in-
stalled two years ago to put the heat on
the men. Now the strikers say: “Old
man Huyett is the best union organizer
we ever had.” New Jersey_,Zinc cleared
a profit of $10,024,294 last year, while

_the Hanover men get the works from

Huyett, saw their grievances ignored
and their contract constantly violated.

sonally addressed to the strikers. The
union doesn’t have the money to fight
the strike in the daily press, but the
company letters provide some laughs.
The workers are particularly touched
by being addressed as “Mr. ............... ..”
“They don’t. call you; mister when
you’re down in the hole, brcakin’ your
back,” one striker said.

More and. more women have become
involved in the work of the strike. They
are on the union’s biweekly radio pro-
gram, write leaflets, visit strikers’ ‘fam-
ilies, give parties to pep up morale.

“Yes, we’re all a little worn down,”

Steel members help-
Mine-Mill strikers

LOS ANGELES——CIO Steel-
workers Union officials have
handed down an “order” to wipe
out the Mine, Mill & Smelter
Workers Union. But rank-and-
file steelworkers at the Consoli-
dated plant in Maywood here
don’t feel that way about it. '

When they were asked to chip
in with food, clothing and money
for the Empire Zinc strikers in
Bayard, someone suggested a $50
donation from the treasury of
Steel Local 2058. But the rank-
snd-filers insisted on a plant gate
collection instead. .

Cash contributions at the gate
collection came to $202.'75———more
than four times the amount pro-
posed earlier. And there was lots
of food and clothing tossed in,
to boot. The Consolidated work-
ers, many of them Mexican-
Americans, thus showed their
solidarity and friendship for their
brothers who belong to another
unio_n-—-and live hundreds of miles
away in New Mexico.

Local 700 helps

Bayard strikers

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—Officers and
members of Weste1'n Mechanics Local
700 here are determined to do every-

thing they can to make sure their union
brothers in Bayard, New Mexico, win
the 8-month strike against Empire Zine
Co.

With that in mind, they are not only
raising money and collecting food and
clothing in various Mine-Mill shops,
they have also enlisted‘ a number of
other Los Angeles unions in the cause.

The drive for strike relief was‘
sparked recently by a visit from" striker

Antonio Rivera and his wife, Elisa, who .‘

is a,member of the Ladies Auxiliary
and chairman of the recreation com-
mittee. . \ A
Inrcsponse to the pleas of Brother
and Sister'Rivera, the Eldon unit un-
der the leadership of chief steward Joe
Weiter madea shop collection of $35
plus clothing and food. Similarly at
Phelps-Dodge, Local 700 president Ed-
ward Parker and other members of the

. shop committee including Carlos Quiroz

helped spark a substantial collecti.on. ,

V ‘funds have also,been raised to help
the Bayard strikers at Universal Brass,
Harvill Corporation, Century Metal-
craft, American Brakeshoe, and Repeal
Brass.

Int’l. Rep. Warren Horie is heading
up the Bayard relief activities in this
area, assisted by Bob Enes, Roger Boyd

 SUDBURY, Ont. —- Mine-Mill
«members here and in Port Col-
:borne have voted nine-to-one to
"approve a new contract with
zlnternational Nickel Co., calling
«for the 40-hour week and a gen-
eral wage increase ranging from
22 to 27 cents an hour plus com-
plete medical, surgical and hos-
pital coverage.

The victorious agreement, cov-
Tering 14,500 Inco employees, was
:negotiated jointly by Mine-Mill
Locals 598 and 637 in Sudbury
and Port Colborne, ' and was
signed May 26 after a record referen-
dum vote had approved it in both cities.

The one-year contract cuts working
hours from 44 to 40 hours a week, with-
out cutting take-home pay. The cut-

back in hours cost the company from
12 to 17 cents an hour. In addition, a
general wage increase of 10 cents an
hour was won.

The standard work—week in Canadian
industry is 48 hours.

THE 10-CENT INCREASE went in-
to effect on June 1, while the conver-
_sion increase becomes effective on July
1. The company has until September
1 to put the 40-hour week into opera-
tion. Thus the miner who was earning,
$1.42 an hour in May had his wages.
hiked to $1.52 on June 1, and-' will be
getting $1.66 hourly starting, July 1.

-A major gain was the rounding
out of medical, surgical and hospital
coverage for employees and all their
dependents. Before the new agreement,
the dependents of employees in Sud-
bury had no hospitalization, while in-
Port Colborne there was nothing- -“but
hospitalization for employees. or de.
pendents. With the new agreement, the
employee and his entire family is: cov-

ered fully, withhalf the cost of the.

additional coverage in each case met
by the company.

In addition to these general gains,
some 400 tradesmen orcraft workers,
 upgraded to a higher classifica-

_tion bringing them an extra- six to-

-ninecents. an hour, while some reclassi-

fications brought other employees wage

increases ranging as high as 40 cents

an hour.

The entire contract cost the Interna-
tionalivNickel Company an estimated
30 cents an hour, which added to the
interim wage increase won by the un-
ion in December, means an increase of
some 37 cents an hour since the sign-
ing of the last agreement in June,
1950.- ‘

The new wage gains now bring the
lowest paid man in the Sudbury opera-
tion to $1.43 an hour, ranging to a
high of $1.961/2. Added to the shift
premium the new wage rates in Sud-
bury now show a top of more than
$2.00 an hour.

Included in the contract is improved
union security with the dues check-off
increased by 50 cents a month. The
referendum showed a nine-to-one vote
in favor of accepting the contract and
an eight-to-one vote in favor of the
increase in dues.

Sample wage rates under the old
agreement and under the new agree-
ment are: Surface labor, old, $1.21,
new $1.43. Beginners underground,
$1.33, new $1.56‘/2. Miners, $1.43, new

, $1.66. Journeymen, $1.57, new $1.82%.

Shaft leaders, $1.691/2, new $1.96‘,é.
These are the highest mining rates in
Canada.

Co-he-ur d'Alenes

Bunker Hill and
Sunshine accused

KELLOGG, Idaho—C h a r g e s have
been filed with the National Labor
Relations Board against the Bunker
Hill &‘ Sullivan Mining Co. and the
Sunshine Mining Co. for refusing to
bargain in good faith. The charges
were brought by the International union
of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers and
the local’ Mine-Mill unions in this dis-
trict.

The dispute arises out of’ refusal of
these’ operators ‘to negotiate on a dis-
trict-wide basis, in accordance with past
custom. Most of the operators in the
district haveindicated a willingness to
join. together and’ bargain as in the

Spokesmen for the union pointed out
that “this: company demand for indi-
vidual bargaining is simply a device to
weaken the-bargaining position of the

Coeur cl.-'-Alene miners and smeltermen, L

and-thereby reduce our organization to
their desired brand of company-union-
ism. This is an old trick that Mine-Mill
membershave defeated in other mining
camps—and we shall defeat it here.”

The new charges were in addition to
previous complaints against Sunshine
and‘ Bunker Hill for unfair labor prac-
tices; An NLRB examiner was expected
in the Coeur d'Alene district last week
to investigate the charges.

Un-ion raids against Mine-Mi-ll,
the Auto Workers relied heavily on red"-
baiting as their chief campaign weapon;
However, the weapon again proved:
powerless when used with workers.
deeply concerned with falling living
standards and the threat of war.

ABC WORKERS here were particu-
larly impressed when they learned;
about the Mine--Mill settlement at Inco
operations in Canada. Whereas Mine-
Mill won a- cutback from the 44 to. 40
hour week PLUS a 10 cent hourly wage

increase, UA-W settled a strike at Near .

Toronto in which they took a 9~eent out
in take-home pay in return for reduc-

tion of the work.-week from 44; tm 

hours.

The ABC plant in. New- Torontmwas
organized by Mine-Mill, but UAW— con-

ducted a.-successful raid there-.two.ysears

ago. As a result of the new UAW con-
tract, New Toronto workers are now
earning, 9- cents: LESS than they earned
under the 1948-49 Mine-Mill contract.

The Mine-Mill campaigners kept the-

UA-W on the defensive up to the mo-
ment that balloting began. With some
11 International representatives. work-
inggfull-timeon the -drive, UAW poimedé
thousands. of‘ dollars down the raiding
drain-pipe in an unusually costly cam-

paign. .

Mine-Mill’ hammered at the fact that
12‘ of the 16 Anaconda Copper Co. prop-
erties. in the United States are covered
by Mine-Mill contracts. Local 593 rank-
and-filers took an active part in the
campaign to defeat the raiders.

The UAW attempted to inject theore-
Iigious issue into the campaign by-
printing an article by Father Healy in
their campaign paper. Despite the fact
that a, large majority of the ABC work-
ers here belong to the Catholic Church,
the UAW attempt failed to influence
them.

The Mine-Mill campaign was directed
by Int’l rep. Joseph Scioli, with Int’l
rep. Herman Clott, board member A!
Pezzati and Graham Dolan of the Press

this week as the result of a bar-
gaining time-table worked out by
24 rank—and-file MMSW Kenne-
cott Council delegates meeting
here May 22nd. Six properties,
with Mine-Mill bargaining units repre-

senting 6,000 workers, are covered by

the counci1—wide bargaining program.
Management maneuvers to split the
Kennecott locals away from their coun-

‘cil-wide coordination met a dead-end

at the session when all locals agreed
to withhold the opening of negotia-
tions at any one property until manage-
ment of the Utah division was ready to

negotiate with the Arthur-Magna Mill-
- men of Local 392.

Management here had been using a
pending CIO—Steel petition as an ex-
cuse for refusing to negotiate, and its
lead was apparently being followed by
management at the other five proper-
ties with stalling answers to local de-

V mands for negotiations.

A SUDDEN SWITCH in manage-
ment’s approach, however, sought to
“con” the other locals into entering
negotiations at divergent dates and
before the representation issue had
been settled at the Arthur-Magna
mills. It was at this point that Coun-

- cil officers called the May 22nd meet-

ing at. which the delegates were unani-
mous in their refusal to bargain at any

- one property until all_ properties were

ready to bargain.

High spots of the council session
came when delegate after delegate took

‘ the floor to re-affirm his local’s un-

divided support of both the MMSW

NEW YORK (FP)-—A 13-cents hour-

has been won by cable division em-

Raiders brushed off, A“
bargaining stepped up

Having brushed aside most of the
raiders—-Steel, UAW, AFL and others
——who have tried to disrupt our nego-
tiations, most Mine-Mill locals were
able last week to devote their full at-
tention to bargaining with employer!
on contract terms. *

The great victory of Sudbury Local
598, with an increase of 27 cents in
hourly wage rates at International
Nickel, has encouraged local unions
throughout the United States and
Canada in the belief that they can make

substantial gains. (See story on
page 3.)
Anaconda

Meeting last week in Butte, Mont.
the Anaconda Council heard reports of
bargaining in Montana, in the brass
plants of Connecticut and New York
and other properties. Plans were made
for developing community support, for
continued coordination and for stepped-
up pressure on the ACM company as
contract expiration approaches.

The victory of Buffalo Local 593
over UAW raiders freed that local
union to concentrate on bargaining.
Another raid will be disposed of by
Torrington (Conn.) Local 423 on June
12.

AS&II

Initial meetings have been held be-.

tween all local unions and AS&R man-
agement. Reports indicate that the
company is willing to discuss a wage
increase. In some places AS&R has
proposed stiff “management” clauses
which the unidn will not accept.

Defeat of an AFL raid at the Hay-
den (Ariz._) smelter frees that local
to devote full attention to bargaining.

Couer d’Alene

Notices for district-wide bargaining
were sent to all operators last month.
Bunker Hill and Sunshine have replied

' that they would not meet jointly with

the other operators as in previous
years. Coeur d’Alene locals are develop-
ing a campaign to compel joint bar-
gaining and have filed unfair prac-
tices charges with the NLRB.

Colninco

Three Mine-Mill locals dealing with
the giant Consolidated Mining & Smelt-
ing Co. in Canada are bargaining joint-
ly. A company wage offer of 12 cents
an hour has beenrejected.

A vote by membership of the three
locals on continuation of the Rand For-
mula showed results of 3,143 in favor
and only 231 against. This is the check-
off device under ‘which all people Work-
ing in the union’s- jurisdiction are re-
quired to pay dues. This issue now has
gone to mediation. '

TRENTON, N.J. (FP)—Mrs. Emma brother of the detective chief who ex-

 ' heard reports on the status of bargaining from all local unions
under contract with the Anaconda Company, wish to state the

One of the defendants, Horace Wil-

duced a fresh piece of evidence which
he received in the mail while he was

3- The Anaconda workers cannot accept restrictions of any
sort on their negotiations. The Anaconda Council therefore
recommends that all local unions make it clear to the company
that we are adhering to our original demands, which repre-
sent the just needs of the Anaconda workers.

All locals affiliated to the Anaconda Council are united in
their determination to .win these demands.

To the Editor:

I’ve just read" a pamphlet put out
by the World Federation of Trade

Unions on “Conditions of" British
Miners.” . '

The working conditions and "real .

wages of the English miners get worse

all the time. Their last wage increase“

was in 1947. Since then prices have_
gone up 13 per cent there, in spite of-

»a price control setup that is some-

what more effective than ours. Pro-
ductivity is up 10 per ,cent,'.ithanks to
speed~up. Wages right now for_un-
derground work are’ less than $20 a

iv Week:

The funny thingis that these Brit-
ish minesare supposed to be “nation-
alized”-—run by a “socialist” or “labor”
government. This confuses some peo-
ple.. They think maybe it proves that
our big corporations in the _American
mining industry are better bosses than

— a “labor” ‘or workers’ '-government

wouldbe. \ . .-

‘The truth is—British’ “socialism” is
just a fake. The present English gov-
ernment is run from WalliStreet. You
can bet that Washington would cut

3 England right off at the ,Marshall

Plan pockets the minute any move was
made to have the workers really own
or run anything. ‘

‘ The truth is—British mines were
taken over because they were4u-nprofit-
able. If prices for the product were
raised, it would cut into the profits of
English industrial users of coal, tin
and iron. This would hurt the Wall
Street boys too. They now own a big‘
share of British industry.

The former owners were guaranteed
compensation and, interest when the
mines were nationalized. The job of
driving" the miners, of making a profit
from theemines -to pay the owners off
,-—this job was turned overto the labor
fakers. They could tell the miners:

.“You can’t kick. now. You are work-

ing for the government. You are the
What a

racket! Just like Truman’s seizure of

. the U. S. railroads.‘ .

The fakers did the job ‘allright- Al-
ready in 1949 profits in the mines
were two and one-half times the pre-
war rate, and still going up. All for
the benefit ‘of the ‘former owners, and
the owners of other sectionsof indus-

'try who benefit from lower. prices.

And all at.the expense of the _miners.
All this proves somethingsto me:

1) The Marshall Plan and American
foreign policy makes the conditions of
workers in other countries worse, even
though a few business men and stoog-
ing labor fakers might get. something
out of it. ' "

_ 2) This is true no matter what label
18 put on the set-up in those countries.

They can call themselves “socialist”
nor labor” or eyen “communist” like
Tito in Jugoslavia; but you know they

/

./

 

  PEN  F R   

;

are going to dance to the Wall Street
tu11e or they will get no dough.

3) I "am convinced that the people
in those countries understand this. We
will get _an awful dumping if we think
they are going to be “grateful” for all
this and come to our rescue if the
MacArthur gang or the Truman gang
get us into a war. ‘

4) The phoney labels used to cover
up big business control in England and
other places teaches us that even if
they call it a “government” or a “U.
S.’-’ Wage Stabilization Board, it is
still only a BIG BUSINESS WAGE
DESTRUCTION BOARD.

Workers want peace
To the Editor:

I think there is one thing that is i

sure today, that is that the workers
want peace. It is true that the press
has confused‘ the issue so that the
question of peace has been obscured
by many side issues. ‘ '

However, we in the ‘trade unions
with experience in dealing with bosses
know that every time we ask for bet-
ter wages and conditions, the bosses
try to create lots-of side issues; they
try to divide the workers on these
other questions, so ‘as ‘to take our
minds off the real thing, wages and
conditions. - .

The same on the question of peace.
If we, .the workers, are able to bargain
and reach agreements with our bosses,
then why can’t the great powers bar-
gain and reach an agreement for
peace?_ 7 —

They all say they want peace, that
the other guy wants war.. Well, I
think the people of the ‘world should

‘ say to their governments: “Sit down

and sign a bargain for peace.” The
meeting of the heads“ of the great
powers, U.S.A., U_.S.S.R., Great Brit-
ain, France, and the People’s§Republic
of China should beheld immediately,
for the purpose of signing a Peace
Pact. If agreement canjbe reached on
that, then‘all the other differences can
be settled later. i ’,

Another thing, make it compulsory
for the complete proceeding of that
bargain-making, to be made public
word for word to all the people of the

“world; no half-baked, half—truth, biased

stories in the press. Then under the_
spotlight .of the people, I am‘ certain
that a peace pact can be signed, for
woe betide any government which
would refuse to sign-such an, agree-

MacAr'l-hdu-r's‘ stale beer
.To the Editor:

When Mine-Mill, and other militant
unions, opposed our government's ac-
tion in Korea, they were condemned
in every sense of the, word; yet now
this same issue is the subject of ‘a na-
tional debate. ‘

Less than a year ago, ‘on ourown
Union floor, many members were con-
demned for either opposing or criti-
cizing our government’s action in Ko-
rea. Motions "were made to stifle all
discussion on the Korean situation‘.
However, the democracy of our Mine-
Mill constitution prevailed, and now‘.
we find that all over the nation and
the world, the Korean question is be-
ing debated. -  ' 1.

It is beginning to dawn upon work-
ing men and women everywhere that
this is not a war of aggression; but 9. ,
war against higher standards ofrliving,‘
a war to further the interests of the‘
‘international cartels, at the same time
giving excuse to pass legislation throt- »
tling labor unions or any organization
seeking to promoteithe welfare of the
lower income groups.

To many of us’ veterans who drank
MacArthur’s beer in Manila, his dis-
missal was something that should have
occurred long before now. His fourteen
years of overseas service without re-
turn to the States, is loudly proclaimed
by our press, but why should he re-
turn to the States, when his holdings‘, , .
in the Pacific and Far East make him _ _.- ; I

wealthy in his own right? * _
I laud Truman’s dismissal of Mac-
Arthur, but that is but a minor inci-
dent in our present situation. I believe-
the present government of China.’
should receive full recognition. From
what -I have seen in the Philippines,
the Huks have every right to rebel.
against their government, and from .. __
-what I have heard from those who".',: 5;

‘The five blmd men
To the Editor:

I am deeply grateful for the oppor-
tunity to express my views on the‘
“Korean Situation.”

As I read the several..letters pub-
lished in the “Union” forum on this
and allied subjects I am reminded of
the five blind men of Hindustan who
went to “see” an elephant. Each of
these self-elected wise men grasped a.
different part of the beast, then voiced
their conclusion; a wall, a tree, a snake,
a rope,’a fan; but not even the collec-
tive wisdom of these men could en-‘
vision such a colossus as an elephant.

’ ~ I think the “Korean situation” is just
one small part of something far more
vast. Its political implications are as
great andvas farreaching as when, on
June the fifteenth in 1215, the king of-
England was forced to sign the Magna
Carta;_thereby dooming absolute’ mon-
archy. Not all ,of the Princes,‘ Lords,
Dukes and Earls _were' in favor of thus
offending the King. Oh no! Some were

“scared. Some wanted peace, at ‘any

‘price. Now the v_United Nations was
conceived for the same purpose,_
nourished with the same yearning for

‘peace and security, -and clothed with

the same desire for -lighter taxes that

‘ raised the Magna Carta from a dream

in a man's heart to our own great
American Bill of Rights and on to the
United -Nations and President Roose-
velt's “Four _Freedoms.” So, when I
think of the United Nation's action in

‘Korea I am filled with the‘ hope that,

out of this conflict between the col-
lective will of ,_-__fi£ty.odd nations and a
couple of dissidents, there will come
the realization of mankin-ds ,dreams' of
peace. That fear of the wrdth of the
combined armies of a large share of

I the world will deter forever the ag-

gressive bullying of one group of peo-
ple by another. It _1;ook_a small war’ in
England to make King John honor his_
signature on the M:-.gna:iCarta. It cost.‘
the United States two bloody" conflicts
to‘ write and preserve‘ its Constitution
and Bill of,Rights. Will any man dare
say that these battles were a senseless
waste of human blood? I 

. Now I have no doubt. but that some
_blacksmith made -_a pile of shillings .
forging battle-axes for killing King

i John’s loyal retainers.‘ History tells us
,that we had pacifists and Iprofiteers
_ during the Revolutionary War..’Lincoln

was "driven to _.distractio'n by, both of
these groups. Kings still exist, so, is

l the Magna Carta_worth_less? Would it

have been better that George Washing-
ton sued for peace ?_ Or._"that Lincoln re-
tracted his Emancipation "Proclama-
tion? I think not...  I 

I think that it is; good_ for workers
to organize in local. organizations, af-_

’ ifiliated with _international' organiza- _

tions. T take ‘concerted action to en-'
force -just demands. "To fdemocrati. zlly

f enact ordinanc_es:‘ by which.'its"c_ompo-
.nent parts’ shall be__governed; and to

coin words, such as finl‘ wtooge, scab

that it is good that_our:country. is or-
ganized into the United Nations for the
purpose of bringing pe§1ce_tO the world.
I ‘think the charter and aims. of that

I : organization. are such that peace-loving

mengthroughout the world should be
willing to fight to sustain them. And‘,' I
‘think it deplorable ‘-that North —»Korea,
the U.S.S.R.
should, in union parlance, ape the tac-
tics of disruptionists and secessionists.

, We do not hesitate in the name‘. of peace,

to deal with that type"of character‘ in

. our union. Why do we disagree about

‘action -in Korea; the .__North Koreans
are finks andthe Chinese and Soviet
Union are their partners in crime. They
are working against the union we be-
long to, the Union of Nations.

I think that in this country theréare '

three groups who would scuttle the
United Nations. There’s the Hermits,

barbed-wire fenceoaround our borders.
There’s the bloodthirsty Republicans,
(some oWn- newspapers, all ‘are too old
for the draft),-who want to fight “for
the Hell of it.” (The Hell is for the sol-
diers; they want lots of “it,” meaning
profits.) Then there’s the “Red Re-

publicans" who, like the Hermits, want I '
. us'to stay at home and like the blood-

thirsty Taft, propose to. educate work-
ers; their brand of education, if you

- please. This ‘species of alley cat is con-

stantly delving into the political garb-
age can and salvaging selected bits of
stinking refuse and holding it high for
all the world to see. as an example of

the American diet. They would have

_you know that our Ship of State is a
leaky old tub with a mutinous crew and
a’ drunken captain. They yell that it is

time to leave the fleet; min the life- ’

boats; and they point out some rust,
tarnished brass and barnacles to. prove
their point; Yet they fail to mention,
that with all its flaws, this ship, the
U. S. Constitution is the fastest, clean-
.est, most seaworthy vessel that ever
weathered the storms of earth’s po-
litical oceans.

I‘ think that the enemies of Mine-Mill
have used these same tactics. Steel_cer-
tainly did. So did‘..1)riscoll.

‘War is Devil himself‘

' To the Editor:

June, for most Mine-Mill members,
means we're near contract negotiations

' time, and time once again to ‘try to

bring pay checks into line with liying
expenses. _This "has .prompted me, a
housewife and mother _of two children,
and a member of Mine-Mill Auxiliary,
to sit down andwrite in order to let
my union know how I feel about this
business of Wages, prices,.taxes, etc.

Our local won’t be nogotiating this —i

’ year, but I am watching with keen in-
‘ terestthe. happenings in other locals.

I believe that what happens in other _ .’

locals in other sections of the country
affects me as much as it does members
in those locals who are actively parti-
cipating in negotiations.

.I think the bargaining demands of
our union are excellent, ‘but I also
think that the fight against the com-
panies for’ wage increases won’t solve
our problems completely. Just as work
in other locals affects the living stand-
ards of themembership in our locals-,
so the foreign policy of our country af-
fects thelife of each and every person
in this country. Some few families may

profit from -' the. p;esent foreign policy,_ ,

 - but most ‘of us are “taxed ’tilit’ hurts.” "

I’m for eliminating both, the huge prof- I

I its and the high_taxes. I feel that both.

one ...clear swing of the axe against

“I heartily agree with Senator ohn- . I

son’s resolution calling for a cease-fire

every ‘true American to see that his
resolution receives ' recognition

By Chose Powers
Board Member, District 7

The longest case in the history
of the National Labor Relations
Board——1937 to 1951—finally has
been wound up with back pay of
$185,000 going to 108 Mine-Mill
members. ' A

This is not a victory, coming
13 1/; years after the start of a
lockout. and with an award less
than a third what it should have
been. Neither is it a defeat for,
the union; one of the most bit-
terly anti-union companies in the
country finally was forcedlo pay
out part of what it owed to its
former employees.

The employer involved, Cowell
Cement Company, was able to
stall through procedures of the
courts and the NLRB, under both
the Warner and Taft-Hartley
acts. For this stalling it was rewarded
by a saving of more than $350,000-
the difference between a just settle-
ment and’ the one that was finally
made. A

THE WORKERS involved know that
they need a union strong enough and
militant enough to fight their, battles.
They know that courts and boards will
serve the cause of justice for working
people only to the extent that the work-.
ers are organized and active enough to
obtain justice. ' ' .

It was in June, 1937, that a group of
Cowell workers, near Concord, Calif.,

-strike ‘riot’ oases

NEWARK, N. J., (FP)—Court dis-
missal of an indictment for inciting to
riot against unionists James Lustig and
John Paradise was hailed as a free
speech victory by Dist. 4, United Elec-
trical Radio & Machine Workers. The

two men were indicted for inciting to

riot during the 1946 Phelps-Dodge
strike.
After finding the indictment insuf-

Zficient, Judge John Bigelow said:

“A studylof cases dealing with riot
discloses that generally the indictment
arises from a gathering of persons in-
tent on promoting some political, re-
ligious or economic cause——in most in-
stances an unpopular one. We must be
on our guard not to approve a prece-
dent that might be cited to undermine

our constitutional rights’ of free as-
sembly and free speech.” =
UE Dist. 4 president, James Mc-

Leish, said, “It is now a." matter of
public knowledge that an-wholesome

. gangster elements imported by Anas-

tasia of Murder Inc. were used by
the Phelps-Dodpe_ Co. during the 19156
strike. Some of the indictments now

outstanding were the -result of resist-

cmce by honest workingmen to the
operation of these gangster elements."

contacted me to ask for organization.
Their wages were among the lowest in
the state. Without even a leaflet, more
than 80 percent turned out for our first
meeting and joined the union. We
asked immediately for recognition. Af-
ter some stalling, the company presi-
dent, Henry George, referred us to a
group of high-priced corporation law-
yers in San Francisco.» George was
president of the “Employers’ Council,”
fouutainhead of reaction in the Bay
area. and was opposed to recognition.
However, we were able to show that 95
per cent of the Cowell workers were

paid-up members of Mine-Mill and the
lawyers agreed to recognition.

We held two “negotiating” sessions,
but it_ was obvious that the company
was prepared to concede nothing. We
warned that unless they made up their

‘minds to really bargain there would be

trouble. . -‘
Next morning when the workers
-showed up at the usual tilne there were

' no time cards.

THE LOCKOUT continued for 5

days, at the end of which the company,
through advertisements and letters ad-
dressed to their employees, stated that
they had signed a closed shop agree-
ment withthe AFL, and that all em-
ployees wishing to return to work
would have to become members of the
AFL.

We immediately contacted the NLRB
and filed charges. The board found out
that the company was offering no de-
fense‘ other than the fact that Mr.
George didnot want “A CIO COMMU-
NIST UNION” (in those days, Philip
Murray, John L. Lewis and all of the
CIO were called Communists). This
lockout was on July 17, 1937.

We were unable to get a hearing un-
til April, 1938, and after 55 days of!
hearing, one mystery’ was cleared up,
to whom had the AFL issued the Char-
ter? To the General Superintendent,
three foremen, the chief chemist, a man
in charge of the company’s bars, and
two special deputy sheriffs.

We received a favorable interim re-
-port from the trial examiner but de-
spite the above evidence, our entire
case was thrown out because the AFL
was not given their day in court. It
took six months to get another hearing,
which lasted 51 days and at the second

I

ave” -y,ou'§diI’ler   lg  .

hearing the AFL refused to heed a
summons. Their only witness was a
chief chemist for the company, A man
on a yearly salary, who was posing as
secretary of the AFL union. ,

From that time on, the case ground
through the courts. Finally, towards
the end of 1942, we received the Su-
preme Court decision, only to have
these high-priced lawyers ask for re-
view on top of review, throwing every-
thing they, possibly could in the way
of having to settle.

EVEN THOUGH we had the U. S.
Supreme Court decision, it took us four

years to force the company into ne-
gotiations. 0

In 1946 we met with the company to
negotiate a contract that started nine
years before and to arrange fo_r rein-
statement of those employees who
wanted it. After two meetings with the

company, they closed the plant again,
saying they were out of business for-
ever. This turned out to be true.

However, this company is wholly
owned by a mother company which had
plenty of money to pay the board's
award to theemployees. Not until Jan-
uary 11, 1951, were we able to get an
enforcement order. They were locked

out in 1937—172 men, 15 of whom we"

haven't been able to locate, though
there are rumors that many of them

.have long since died. Of the balance

there were 13 -known to have died.

The company was able to get the
present Board to agree to a phony
formula which meant reimbursement
for all time lost between July 17, 1937,
and October 25, 1945, LESS any earn-
ings the employee had during this
period. This meant that most of them
—those who had held jobs in war in-
dustries earned enough‘ in one year to
wipe out what they would have made
working for Cowell for 3 or 4 years.

The unfair method granted to the
company by the Board actually reward-
ed the company for defying the Board’s
order all through the war years. Be-
cause of their defiance they saved over
$350,000. The courts of this country
are rigged to benefit corporations
against the man who works.

- (From the report of P«resz'cle7zt
Boyce to the Ninth Anmlal Conven-
 , jtion of the Western Fecleraﬂon of
 e ‘Miners in June, 1901, at Denver).

The first attempt at forming an as-
sociation of unions in the western
states of which we have any knowledge
was made in the Coeur d’Alenes in
1889,'when Burke, Gem, Mullan and
Wardner Miners Unions organized
what was known as the Coeur d’Alene
Executive Miners’ Union.

Between this Executive Union and

.1 the ‘unions in Colorado, Montana and
3‘ South ‘Dakota there was some cor-
»l.;~; -  esipondence relative to the advisabil-
i.' ity of forming a central body, but no
 definite action was taken until the
early spring of 1893, when, through

an agreement with other unions, Butte
Miners’ Union issued a call for a
convention composed of represenatives

El‘ from the miners’ Unions of the West.

IT MAY BE truly said that the min-
7ers of the West made no attempt at
forming a central body until the Mine
Owners’ Association, under the guiding
hand‘ of John Hayes Hammond and his
 associates, forced the issue upon them
‘ '. in the Coeur d’Alenes in 1892 in their

~ ‘attempt to form a universal wage
schedule of $2.50 per day for the min-
ers throughout the mining regions of
the West.

In 1892 this Mine Owners’ Associa-
tion obtained an injunction from Judge
Beatty‘ restraining members of the

_ Coeur‘ d’Alene Miners’ unions from

 the mining companies or advising men

 Twelve men in Idaho jail L

troit, where they were held until or-
dered released by the United States
Supreme Court.

It was while those men were impris-

oned in Ada county jail that the bene-
fits of a central organization dawned
upon them.

THEY FREQUENTLY discussed the
question in all its phases and agreed
that, upon their liberation, each would
use his influence with his respective
union to assist in formulating plans
that would bring all _the unions of the
West into one central body.

This agitation began in the month of
March, 1893, and in accordance with an
agreement with the unions that signi-
fied their willingness to co-operate with
such a movement, Butte Miners’ Union
issued a call to all unions in the West
to send delegates to Butte, Montana,
May 15, 1893, for the purpose of organ-
izing this proposed central body.

The following unions were repre-
sented: Aspen, Barker, Bannock, Belt
Mountain, Butte, Burke, Central City,
Creede, Eureka, Gem, Granite, Lead,
Mullan, Ouray and Rico.

Apology

The more years a man acquires, the
fewer mistakes he is supposed to
make. Here's hoping the old—timer
makes no more mistakes such as pick-
ing out the bit from the Miners’
Magazine published in the last issue
of THE UNION.

As pointed out in a letter from
Brother Fred Pruitt of Local 18, Kel-
logg, “it is better to let bygones be
bygones.” Having been a member of
the Western Federation of Miners in
the years immediately following the
Coeur d’Alene évents of 1899 the old-
timer’s thoughts reverted to that fight
when he read again Ed Boyce’s scath-
ing editorial. We regret the mis-
takes and will be more careful in the
future.-—-Sam Embree, Mine-Mill his-
torian.

IN BED TOGETHER

ered this miner because of its two-year
retroactive feature. By that time, the
miner had begun to receive old age pen-
sion benefits, since ‘he was past 65
years of age.

Normally, the Company would have
to make up the difference between his
social security payments and a $100

-monthly pension. But even this small

amount is denied him under a. trick
paragraph which the Steelworkers per-

_mitted to be included in their pension“?

The paragraph allows the company
to deduct from pension payments not

any compensation-’rer-claimsffpaid to an _ V '

All men are brothers
To the Editor:

In the beginning there was God.
(Genesis 1-1.) He created all things,
Great and Small, among these things
were all men, White, Black, Red and
Yellow. He gave them all the breath
of life and a soul. Now the saving of
this soul of all men regardless of the
color of their skin is the primary pur-
pose of this creator of all men, but in
order that this purpose might be real-
ized all men must live a short span
of life on this earth and live it ac-
cording to the pattern set before us by
the son of_ God.

First, we must believe, then we must
love one another (as he loved all of
mankind) and‘ treat all men as if they
were at least a brother human being.
Now if you believe this tell me why
in this great free Christian country of
ours that some of the men (especially
in the South and Southwest) that this
great God created does everything pos-
sible to keep from following this pat-
tern and also try to keep others from
following it. I have noticed that even

the Ministers who are supposed to live.

and teach this great truth shy away

.if the color question is put to them.

Brothers, as long as this goes on
there is nothing for you to expect in
this life except wars, wage freezes,
taxes, hunger, waste and destruction.
As to the life to follow 1 just don’t
know what will become of you. You
can’t go to heaven or hell because
segregation is not practiced in either
place. ’

I live in the south, Alabama,‘ if you
please, and also have a white skin, but
I believe in the teaching of the Son
of Man. I read a story in the Ladies
Home Journal by a negro school teach-
er from Montgomery, Ala. In one place
she said in talking about as poor,
starved, ragged and unlearned pupil
“Lord have mercy on this child created
in Thy image but born with a black
skin.”

But I am inclined to disagree with
this. I believe that the Lord should
have mercy on the people who are to
blame for this child being in this con-
dition by discriminating against his
parents and their parents before them.
If all the people‘ of the world would

only try to love one another instead n
of cheating and degrading every one‘

else because of their race, creed or
color this will be 82‘ peaceful place to
live this short life and then there would

.be a place prepared for them after this

life. -

But first, all the people (especially
in the South) have to learn that if
the white man deprives the Negro of
his just rights he also is depriving
himself, and if both white and colored
in the South are depriving themselves,
they are also depriving the ones in the
North from getting their just dues and
no one benefits except the Corpora-
tions. .

God set the pattern. Who is mere
man to change it? Brother, I, would
like your questions andanswers‘ to this
letter. Address them to the Open
Forum or direct to W. O. Colwell, 420

out of his pension -benefits every cent
of the $3,500 which the courts ordered
the company to pay him for the silicosis
disability before he receives a penny
in contribution from TCI.

In other words, if he ‘doesn’t die
meantime of the silicosis contracted in
42 years of service with the company,
he may begin to draw some of that
Steelworkers pension plan money in
1959 or 1960. I ‘ .

Such is Murray’: formula for pen-
sions. It should'be noted that the Ala-
bama iron ore locals under Mine-Mill
jurisdiction were forced to accept this
same plan because of their tie-in with
the steel industry. However, Mine-Mill
representatives and leaders denounced
the plan for the fraud it is from the

 beginning.  , 

O 0
Fave POIIII‘ plan
To the Eclitorzi
There has been much said about

peace and I would like to suggest a

five point plan that I think would in»-

sure peace for the whole world.

1. Let each country choose its own
form of government. Let them de-
cide by vote the form of‘ govern-
ment they want.

. 2. Outlaw the Atomic bomb and the

machinery that makes it. Use
Atomic energy for scientific pur-
poses only. Set up a commission to
see that this law is carried out.
Have a penalty of death if anyone
group uses atomic energy for wax:
purposes.

3. Have free trade with all countries.
No more trade pacts or alliances.
Make it possible for all people to
buy the products that are made
today.

4. Do away with the many unions we
have today. Have a National Union
in each country. Use it for the
things that unions were founded
and intended for. This way the peo-
ple of the world would all have the
same standard of living, working‘
conditions and rights, wherever he
lives.

5. Make a law that is mandatory that
people be able to vote if a war is
declared. People should have the
right to say if they are to die or
shed their blood in a war.

I believe that these things are pos-
sible and I think our International
Union should try to work out a pro-
gram along these lines, because we all
believe in peace and free peoples.

Steers Weakness

The revelation that CIO-Steel
propaganda doesn’t even convince
the men handing it out came last
week during the NLRB election
campaign at the Arthur-Magna
(Utah) Kennecott copper mills.

- A leaflet handed out by the
Steelworkers two days before the
voting carried an appeal to Mill-
men to vote Steel so they could
“enjoy the added bargaining
strength” of being allied with the
nearby Garfield AS&R smelter
(which seceded from Mine-Mill in
1948 and was picked up by Steel
last year). .

But a Garfield local officer,

~ handing out the very Steel leaflet
containing this propaganda line,
told several millmen to whom he
was giving the sheet:

“If you fellows decide to stay
Mine-Mz'll instead of coming
along with us, 'we’re going to be
in one h--- of a shape at the
smelter when we go in to negoti-
ate this year!”

Truman admits it
“Corporate profits are now running
at the all-time record rate of $48 bil-

ing costs. —

pearance before the Steed—sub-c_ommit-

tee» of the House Labor Committee:

were Presiilent Thomas Lane‘-of Local

‘-423. The committee has been taking.~ex-

tens-ive testimony on the weaknesses,

of the so-called “cost-of-living; -index,”

of the» Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“Our job,” saidPezzati, “is to- pro-

tect and advance the living standards

of our members, and we think the—com- ».

mittee has a duty in seeing to- it that a

much larger amount of meat”. is needed-

than the BLS Index allows. Whilethe
BLS. says 33% of the worker's. budget
goes for food, he said, our workers
actually spend closer to 56%. of their
earnings just on that budget item.

’ The Distri_ct.6 board member showed
clippings from current Jersey newspa-

persvs-howing an 80% increase in food-

prices since 1916, as contrasted to» only
55% admitted by BLS.
Lane showed that prices have risen

tial food. Th total, he showed, came
to more than he earns in wages at the
Perth Amboy AS&R smelter.

Similarly Dowd gave figures on liv-
ing costs for his family of nine chil-
dren, and demonstrated that living
costs have risen just as steeply in

A Connecticut as- they have in Jersey.

Summing up the Mine-Mill testi-
mony, Pezzati argued that “prosper-..

came down the government pipe” for
big business.

Thecommittee revealed the following
sensational tax hauls:

1. In five months of the present na-
tional emergency, tax amortization cer-

Jtificates for $5 billion have been hand-
ed out to industrial giants almost with-
-'out investigation. This compares with

a total of only $7.5 billion‘ during all of

.World War II. Applications for many

more billions are pending and Wilson’s

iunderlings show no great concern over
— congressional criticism. =

2. Under present lax policies and lax-

-eradministration, the same compan-
. ies which get their plants free through

amortization certificates are able to
double their haul by using the same

amortization figures in boosting prices

of military items sold to the govern-
ment. Many companies, after getting
the amortization certificates, then ob-
tain direct loans from the government
to build the plants.

The Hardy subcommittee highlighted
lavishness of mobilization officials in

gifts to the profiteers with the case of _

the very first direct loan under the
present emergency program. Three men
with $800 and an idea, the committee
reported, were able to borrow $8 mil-
lion from the government to build a
steel plant after they had formed the
Hazleton Steel & Tube Co. The grant
was made despite technical reports op-
posing it. Only security was the pro-
jected plan. After the subcommittee
exposed the deal, it was reviewed on
orders of former production adminis-
trator William Henry Harrison, but
still approved.

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Two actions
were taken last "week which have the
effect of raising the “take” of giant
American copper corporations from
their Chilean holdings:

O‘ The House passed and sent to the
White House a bill to suspend the 2-

cent-a-poundlcopper import duty until

February, 1953. It will now cost 2
-cents less to market Chile-’s copper in
this country; and sales are expected to
increase as a result.

DA-gzreement was reached between
the U. S. and Chilean governments for
a 3‘-cent-a-pound increase in the price
of imported copper. The hike means.
that Chilean copper will now sell at
27% cents a pound—151/2 cents above
the top price paid during World
War II. __.- ,

Q

Who does .NAM think
it’s kitldillg, anyhow?

By Marty Solow

federated Pros:

In our survey of National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers activities, we’d
like to discuss some of the views of
our way of life which the big business
organization wants everyone to ado‘pt.
,These views were contained again and
again in various publications available
at the NAM’s 1950 convention in New
.York. The NAM says:

“Soapboxers charge that free enter-
prise has resulted in a maldistribution
of income and that most of -America’s
income goes to a handful of people.
Not only is that not true; it is silly.”

  Silly, -indeed!

The Census Bureau in a recent study
revealed that 10 million families (two

‘ or more persons) had incomes of less

than $2,000 yearly.

OTHER STUDIES show that one-
tenth of America’s 39 million families
take in 35 percent of total money in-
come annually. The equivalent of the
income which goes to the 3.9 million

Trainmen accept
3-year wage freeze

WASHINGTON (FP)——The Brother-
hood of Railroad Trainmen has settled
its 26-month dispute with the railroads
on terms patte1‘ned on those reached at
the White House conference last win-
ter.

The settlement memorandum, cov-
ering a 3-year period, agrees to ap-

: pointment of an arbiter by President

Truman to rule on two unsettled rules
changes. The roads had demanded that
John R. Steelman be named, but the
union held out against him.

Wage and working rules provisions
are similar to those rank-and-file lead-
ers rejected in January after the tenta-
tive agreement reached at the White
House. They provide the following in-
creases: Yardmen get a, boost of 23c
an hour, effective Jan. 1, 1951; another
boost of 2c an hour, effective March 1,
1951; and increases of 2c an hour plus
6c‘ an hour effective April 1, 1951.
Roadmen get increases totaling 18‘,éc.

Wages‘ are covered by an escalator

- clause which provides a rise or fall of

1c an hour for every 1-point change in
the Bureau of Labor Statistics con-
sumer price index from a base of 178.

The 40-hour week is established in
principle for yardmen but the memo-
randum provides that it be set aside
until Jan. 1, 1952. After Oct. 1, 1951,
three months notice must be given of
desire to put it into effect.

The agreement provides a 3-year

moratorium on further wage and rules ,

changes starting Oct. 1, 1951.

families is -earned by the bottom 24
million families.

The data on savings further empha-
sizes the disparities among income
groups. The top tenth hold close to
80 percent of the nation’s savings while
at the bottom, 35 percent hold exactly
zero in savings.

The NAM also likes to emphasize
that every American is a “capitalist.”
To prove this it invariably comes up
with the fact that some 14 million of
us fortunate Americans owns stocks—
therefore American industry has "14
million owners.” '

This tomfoolery about stocks is one
of the biggest frauds peddled by the
NAM. It knows very well that a ‘Se-
curities & Exchange Commission study
revealed that:

0 Only 10,000 people own 25 percent
-of all corporate stock. .

0 Only 75,000 people own 50 percent
of all corporate stock. ,

I Only 61,000 people receive half the
income from stock dividends.

Part of the great NAM crusade is
its pitch for free enterprise and free
competition—-as opposed to socialism.
Attacking socialism, the NAM charged,
that “there is no competition (under
it). There is only monopoly, and since
monopoly inevitably becomes lazy and
inefficient’, the people must pay too
much for what they buy.”

THERE IS NO MONOPOLY in
America, the NAM insists over and
over and over."

BUT: “The monopoly problem in
American industry today is more

Was your mail
late? llere’s why

WASHINGTON—President William
Doherty of the National Assn. of Let-
ter Carriers (AFL) places the entire
blame for lowering of U. S. mail ser-
vice to the worst point in history upon
Postmaster General Jesse Donaldson.

“The present crisis is the direct re-
sult of an arbitrary act of one man,”
Doherty says, “namely, Postmaster
Gen. Jesse M. Donaldson.” He says
Donaldson, operating entirely on his
own, decided April 17, 1950, to reduce
or eliminate “phases of almost every
function of the postal service.”

Home mail deliveries were cut to one
a day, postoffice window hours were
drastically cut, the readdressing ser-

vice for mis—directed letters was en-

save money, Doherty says; adding: “He

ritation while soaking them with the
biggest postal cost in the history of

serious and widespread than at any
time since the passage of the Sherman
act in 1890 . . . The largest corpora-
tions in this country now hold apprai-
mately two-thirds of the nation’s us-
able manufacturing facilities.” (State-
ment from report by the Justice De-
partment anti-trust division.)

BUT: “This growing concentration
of economic power through merger:
is today's greatest challenge to the
American theory of competitive en-
terprise and to the American -200.11 of
life.” (Federal Trade Commission.)

BUT: “The relatively few giant
corporations of the country which have
come to dominate our economy are
themselves largely owned by a few
thousand stockholders and by a mere
handful of financial interests.” (Sen-
ate report on Economic Concentration
and World War II.)

And, incidentally, what’s this about
free enterprise—like the NAM says we
havelkeeping prices down?

The NAM brightly asserts that “the
four million business firms in opera-
tion in America know only one boss:
THE CUSTOMER. Thus, the Ameri-
can system of free enterprise may
truthfully and accurately be defined as
the economic system under which the
worker exploits management.”

Warning:
beer may vanish

WASHINGTON, D. C.—A warning
that beer may vanish from the Ameri-
can scene entirely if the proposed heavy
new tax on it is imposed has been
given the House ways and means com-
mittee. ’

The warning came from president
Karl Feller of the United Brewery
Workers who said: _“To place this
burden on an already overburdened
beverage may well place it beyond the
reach of the public and dest-roythe
industry. It is commonly said that
beer is the 'u;orkingma.n’s drink. But
the size of the beer glass is shrinking
and its price has been rising. The tax
burden on beer is fantastically heavy."

Chapman warns of danger

to Columbia River pian

WASHINGTON (FP)—-Secretary of
the Interior Oscar Chapman has
warned the Federal Power Commission
of a quiet move by western private
power interests to grab for themselves
huge facilities along. the Snake river
in Idaho. If the commission grants ap-
plication for construction of private
dams, Chapman warned, the entire
Columbia river basin development
planned by the government will be
thwarted.

Occasion of the secretary’s warning
was an application by the Idaho Power
Co. of Boise for the right to build a
power plant at the Oxbow site on the
Snake river deep in Hells Canyon.

Chapman said he was against hap-
hazard construction of plants by pri-
vate companies along the river be-
cause it would rob the nation of a.
great resource and would not produce
as much power as projects now planned
by the government.

Textile strike ends,

mecltnors take over

NEW YORK——The 5-week southern
textile strike was over last week, as
40,000 strikers returned to work. The
union ordered its members back to
work after receipt of a wire from fed-
eral mediation chief Cyrus Ching, who
asked that the strike be called off in
the interest of “national safety and
welfare.”

Ching said he would name a 3-man
mediation panel to consider the wage
issue involved in the strike. he medi-
ators, one each from the union. em-
ployers and public, would have no fact-
finding or arbitration powers. Ching
said, but would merely ask to help the
parties arrive at a settlement.

Possibility that the Textile Union,
of which Emil Reive is president, had
sold out its southern members was in-
dicated by textile employers’ reaction
to Ching’s announcement. They indi-
cated they would not accept any medi-
ation panel recommendations, and said
the “strike has been smashed.”

All of t_he usual trappings of a C10-

’ Steel raid marked‘ this campaign, which
.will probably prove to be one of. the

costliest of» Murray’s forays: against
Mine-Mill. In" addition to the now-
familiar importation of outside rack-
eteers and payrollers, Steel spent

thousands of dollars" a day to flood the. .

millmen’s communities with rank-and-
filers from the “Utah locals under its
control. . ’ ' ' ‘ ’
Every one of these »-Steel ‘stooges,
however, came from a‘ plant or mine
where‘ details 'of- losses and sellouts suf-
fered ‘under the. Murray regime were

‘matters of public record, known‘ to vir-

tually every Kennecott worker at the
mills. And so the Steel “powerhouse”
was ~sh_ort-circuited time\ and again
when Local 392 members confronted «
the “visitors” with embarrassing" qu_e_s-.
tions to which they had no answers.
The defeat of‘Steel at the Kennecott
mills isespecially significant in view

-of the fact that Utah is one of the few

Western states where Murray’s ma-
chine has any appreciable operating
base. The huge Geneva Steel plant at
nearby Provo, and" a string of locals

cession movement could reasonably
have been expected to give Steel the
talking-points it needed to sell itself
to the Millmen. *

W The record, however, was something
that Steel just couldn’t defeat. Stacked

against the losses sustained by work-

ers under Steel company-unionism, the
Mine-Mill Kennecott Council’s record
