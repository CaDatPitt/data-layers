Organize and Fight Against Lynching!

The brutal and bloody lynchings of John H. Wilkins, Negro pullman

porter, at Locust Grove, Georgia, Dave Harris of Mississippi, and Allen

Green at Walhalla, South Carolina, show Very sharply the Vicious terror,
and the whole system of lynch law of the bosses against Negro and white
workers in the United States. These dastardly and barbarous crimes, fol-
lowing Very closely the lynching of Jimmie Levine at Ocilla, Georgia, and
Laura Wood, 65 year old Negro woman worker of North Carolina, dem-
onstrate very clearly the increasing attacks of the exploiters of labor upon
the Negro masses, andare part and parcel of the wholesale campaign of

‘terror against the entire working class. Against these brutal and vicious

attacks the whole working class must rally to wage a ﬁerce struggle.
While these cases of lynchings have been exposed to light, there are
many more cases which the bosses’ newspapers have deliberately sup-
pressed. This was shown very clearly in the Wilkin’s case. Every ef-
fort was made by these papers of the bosses to suppress the news,
and when ﬁnally forced to print the news owing to mass pressure of the
Workers, they threw an air _ _ -

of mystery around this -

The attack upon
the workers by lynching
is part of the campaign of
persecution and terror
conducted against the
A Lymhmg__,,Jusﬂce,, workmgclass by the capi-
for the Negro worker tahst class. And especi-
ally is this persecution
vicious in this period of
growing mass unemploy-
ment and increasing unity
of Negro and white work-
ers. Throughout the en-
tire country workers
meetings and demonstra-
tions are broken up, job-
less workers’ leaders are
sent to jail without the

other workers on the
train, in order to prevent
them from exposing the
names of the lynchers to
the eyes of the toiling
masses.

Lynching is one of_ the

pression used by the boss
class of the United States
and its agents against the
workers. Formerly used
predominantly a g a i n s t
Negro workers, today, it
is used with increasing
sharpness against white
workers. The lynching of

Only the Organized and United Might and Power of the War

A the necessity of organizing together to better their conditions. Negro and

white Workers are sentenced to chain gangs in the South, (George Saul in
North Carolina, 6 months, Gilbert Lewis in Chattanooga, Tenn., 112 days.)

Frustrated at times in carrying out their barbarous crime of lynching,
the lynchers——the bosses‘ and their agents——resort to the means of legal
lynching. In Crescent Springs, Kentucky, McPherson Anderson, a Negro
Worker, faces the gallows on a most vicious frame-up charge of “attacking
Anderson was arrested by the sheriff who was among
the lynchers when their plan to lynch him miscarried.

At the same time, H. M. Powers and Joe Carr, organizers of the Com-
munist Party and the Young Communist‘League, respectively face death
sentences in Atlanta, Georgia, charged with “inciting to insurrection,” an
old 1860 carpet-bagger law, which the bosses revived, because these two
Workersorganized both Negro and white workers together and led them
in struggle against the extreme exploitation under which they worked.

The Seven Gastonia prisoners, who were sentenced to 117 years in
prison last October, because of their leadership in the famous Gastonia
strike, and for having organized Negro and white work-
ers into the Trade Union Unity League and the National
Textile Workers Union, are now appealing their caselto
the State Supreme Court of North Carolina. The argu-
ments have already been heard by the State Supreme
Court and it is expected that they, as tools of the-textile
interests of this State, will uphold the decision of the
lower court and sentence these courageous ﬁghters to a
living death. Millions more must join the protest against
their incarceration and must unite in the movement to
free them.

Against the foreign-born Workers, this campaign of
murderous terror of the bosses is being intensiﬁed. Not
contented with the outright murder of foreign-born work- ,
ers, Steve Katovis and Gino Mazolla in New York City,
the bosses also resort to the merciless weapon of deporta-
tion , which means sending to instant death at the hands
of the brutal fascist dictatorships
of Europe and other countries,
workers of foreign birth who are every day carrying
on a militant struggle in the interest of the toiling,
oppressed masses of this country. In Norfolk, Va.,
Stephen Graham is on $1,000 bail facing deportation
to Jugo-Slavia, for holding a meeting of Negro and
white Workers in the same hall, while in other sec-
tions of the country scores of workers are being held
for deportation to fascist countries and to death.

The increasing use of the lynch law and the gen-
eral ﬁendish terror of the bosses against the workers
are not conﬁned to the United States, but extends
 into other lands under the brutal, iron heel of Ameri-
 " can Imperialism. The masses of workers and peas-
