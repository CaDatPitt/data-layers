All this reactionary legislation has been fought bythe Kenya Trade a . J V ~-‘ ;.,_'. ’ \

truction of Trade'Unionism. A * T V A  y  '0 ‘ "

An extremely important stage ‘in’ thedevelopment‘ of the_-Kenya . g    
Trade Union movement was reached on May 1st, 1949_,vbwiths the-A ‘ C_.j 
formation of the East African Trade Union Congress under the w ‘ 
leadership of Makhan Singh. Because this was a major step forward,‘ ,_ _ _
in the struggle to build working class unity—.—unity of the different  F  
sectionsof workers and unity of‘the African and Asian 7workers——— ,' ‘E T   \
the imperialists have done everything possible to destroy it. A . ’ A . 1 , 5  , ” 

They noted with alarm the" rapid growth of the E.A.T.U.C. from  E’ A
_5,000 members at its inception to 10,000 by the end of’ 1949, and they ~  A i
knew only too well that the strike struggles of 1949, especially the‘ . g ‘T 7
successful lv6.day strike of. 2,000 transport workers, were a sign of» pr  f
bigger strike struggles to come in 1950. ' 0 » ' J ‘

Throughout 1950, backed by their new ﬂood of anti-Trade Union
legislation, the imperialists intensiﬁed their drive against Tra_devUnio,n-
ism. In February, 1950, the police banned all meetings organised by ,0 A  ;
the East African Workers’ Federation. At the same time Daudi Urida,ﬁ  e 
Acting President, and Japhet Banks, General Secretary of the East, _ g 
African Workers’ Federation, were arrested and chargedrwithpbeing‘   e
“rogues and vagabonds.” They were later sentenced toi4 and 6:mon‘thse  it ~ 0‘
hard labour respectively. The Mombassa police also raided the ofﬁce \ A A
of the Federation and seized all account books and membership lists.

a passport to visit Europe for the purposes of studying’ Trade ~, ‘

E.A.T.U.C., which maintained relations with both the British T.U.C. . ‘ e if; !
and the W.F.T.U., was not a Trade Union but an organisation of I 5 e  ""

H    UIMPERIALIST POLICY‘

 by  these repressive acts and laws aimed at smashing the Trade ,

 Union‘ movement have been accompanied by Government action
In September, ‘I950, a new Bill was
introduced, providing for, the “establishment of Wages Councils.” The

. function of these was made clear by the Acting Labour Commissioner,

Mr. Carpenter, who stated that it was the intention of the Bill to

i provide '‘‘alternative machinery” to the trade unions. He added that

hisldepartment, was encouraging the setting up of staﬁ associations

within individual concerns in place of trade unions, and that it was
hoped to amend the Trade Union Ordinance in order to include"

recognition of such associations. In view of all the preceding repres-
sive " actions by the Government against‘ the Trade Unions, the dis-

, ruptive object of this new legislation and of the “staff associations”

‘ B isclear. * r

The workers of Kenya are well aware of the disruptive role of the
British right-wing Trade Union leaders who since 1945 ‘have con-

pi .~ tinued ‘to support the imperialist policy of oppression carried out by
‘ the Labour Government. The British Trade Union leaders boast that

  they have senta Trade Union ofﬁcial to advise and help the develop-
L ment of Trade Union organisation. In fact, however, therole of this

' “ad_vilsi.er" has been tu discourage Trade Union,ism= and to’ attempt to -- "

turn what Trade Unions exist into agents of the employers and the

Government. Today only 2 per cent of the workers of ‘Kenya are,
organised into Trade Unions, but"this they have achieved in the face

ofbitter opposition. * \ V ._
Big efforts are,-ofAcourse, being» made by the Scab International
with the aid of the right-wing leaders of the British T.U.C. to win the

support of the Kenya workers. But the real character ‘of? the ‘
‘‘1;C.F.T.U.” is well unders‘tood,»as witness this exposure by the’
‘ I Kenya Daily Chronicle of November 24, 1950. ’ ’

“The character of the I.C.F;T.U. " doubtful: from the start; its

domination by the A.F.L.t has only deepened the doubts, and‘it— is‘

no guarantee to the workers to ‘know that Mr. Irving Brown of the

A.F.L. is going to Turkey to establish “free” trade unions there".
' M The East Africa Trade Union Congress fully appreciates the con- ‘

nection between its struggle for living” standards and th"est'ruggle for
national independence. In the course of 1950 they associated’ them-

‘selves -with the Kenya African Union and the East African Indian
‘ National Congress, two mass organisations which defend the interests 1 g
of the African and Indian population. A huge meeting of over 20,000, — - ”

African and Asian workers in March, _1950, passed‘ at resolution de-

claring that the complete independence and sovereignty of the East 

African territories was the real solution. to their problems. Thus,

I despite‘ the most savage oppression, the workers and peasants of
Kenya are forging unity in the struggle for national independence. a
democracy and improved living standardsjln this they have common g_ ’
- ground with the working class and people of Britain whose interests‘

also lie in struggling against Anglo-American imperialism. ' 2 I

These words were spoken‘ by an aged_ African chief in Kenya to a

L ‘his property but which is ‘now occupied by a/ European settler. The

Having done its pioneering work, the Imperial British East Africa
Company SUI rendered its Charter and in 1895 Kenya passed under the
administration of the British Imperial Government.

To link up the westernmost of the East African territories, Uganda,
with the coast, a railway was constructed from Mombassa, on the

east coast to Kampala, in Uganda. Europeans were encouraged to '

settle on land on both sides of the railway. Thus began the process
of squeezing out of their lands the Kikuyu, Mtkamba, Kavirondo and
other tribes of Kenya, a process which is still going on to_day.

Before the coming of the Europeans, the Africans, who were en-
gaged in agricultural and pastoral’ pursuits, had no notion of private
ownership of land. All land on which the particular tribe lived
belonged to the tribe as a whole and the individual was given land
only for the purpose of maintaining himself and his family.

The British Government, in assuming protectorate rights» over
Kenya, declared that the communal ownership, of land had_passed
from the indigenous inhabitants to the Protectorate government and ‘
that the latter now had the right to share out the land as it thought
best. The principle it adopted was simply that the best land should;
go to the white settlers, while the Africans were to be restricted to

inferior land. Dr. Norman Leys, a European expert on Kenya, who 1
himself settled there, has estimated that “about half the land in Kenya .

that is worth cultivating” lies within the area that has been already
transferred to Europeans. _ .
From 1901, when there were just 13 white settlers in Kenya, their-
number has grown until today it is 29,660 of whom only some 3,000,
including families, are actually engaged in farming. .5
\ It is therefore this 3,000 that monopolise 50 per cent. of the culti-
vable land, while 5,500,000 Africans retain uncertain possession of
the remainder. ‘
There are also 90,528 Indians, mostly engaged in trade, and 24,174
Arabs. ’ 1'

The sort of people who constitute the white population of Kenya I

amply justify the comment of Negley Farson, the traveller, when in
his book Behind God's Back he says of the colony that, “It has the
greatest proportion among its inhabitants of ex-soldiers, generals,
colonels, majors, of any count-ry in the World.”

The leader of the ﬁrst settlers, Lord Delamere, was appointed
chairman of the Kenya Lands Board which the government estab-
lished to review the effect of the sudden and extensive expropriation
of their lands upon the Africans. In the original share-out he him-
self acquired over 100,000 acres of the best land. Others who thus
beneﬁted individually included Lord Francis Scott, who through the
marriage of his niece to the Duke of Gloucester became connectedf
with the British royal family. Huge tracts were‘ alienated in favour
The East African Syndicate was given

320,000 acres, the Uplandsiof East Africa Syndicate 350,000 acres
and the Grogan Forest Concession 200,000 acres.
, In‘ order to “legalise” the position, the government passed the

Crown Lands Ordinance by which all lands, which have not been

speciﬁcally declared to be native lands by the Native Lands Trust
Ordinance, became vested in the British Crown ass“ Crown Lands.”

The Crown Lands Ordinance, moreover, gave the government the

right to grant on 99-year leases to European settlers estates of up
to 7,500 acres, some of them at a price as low as one penny per acre.

The prime purpose of the Crown Lands Ordinance was to exclude

. the non-European for all time from the Highlands, the plateaux lying

< in the shadow of Mount Kenya, where is found some of the most

fertile land and the healthiest climate in all Africa.
' So determined were the white settlers to monopolise this country

that when the Colonial Office in London proposed granting to Indians
who had been engaged on railway construction the right to acquire V

land, a group of ex—army olﬁcers, including generals, colonels, majors
and captains, formed a Vigilance Committeeand began to agitate
furiously for the expulsion of ‘all Indians from Kenya.

The issue ‘almost led to an insurrection and the threat of a rebel-
lion by white, men in a country whose population was overwhelmingly
composed of black men brought about the promulgation of the

, Kenya Order, by which the Highlands are exclusively reserved for the

enjoyment of Europeans settlers. It is illegal for any other racial
group to own or to attempt to acquire land there.

Three months after the Order came into force in 19,39, the Wataita
tribe, "the last Africans remaining in the Highlands, were forcibly
evicted from their lands in the Taita Hills. Two years before this
event a similar fate had befallen one of the largest and most influen-
tial of the Kenya tribes, the Kikuyu. And the Wakamba, who had
been living ina reserve a few miles to the east of Nairobi, the capital,
were also turned out of their ancestral home. Largenumbers of
their cattle were rounded up, moreover, and sold at very low prices
to.a representative of the American meat-packing ﬁrm of Liebig, who
happened very conveniently to be in Kenya at the time.

. For the past thirty years the cry of the Kenya Africans for land
has been consistently raised. And when it becomes too embarrassing,
a Royal Commission is sent out to Kenya to “investigate.” Indeed,

' so many of these Commissions have been sent that Kenya has become

known as the “ Land of Royal Commissions.”
A-Consequent upon the Hilton Young Commission report of 1930,
the British Labour government of the time issued a memorandum

on Native Policy in East Africa, which solemnly pledged the imperial‘ .
government to stop all further alienation of land from-the Africans.

The memorandum declared that the lands within the boundaries as _

ﬁnally gazetted for Native Reserves “ are reserved for/the use and

‘beneﬁt of the natives iforever.“ It went -on -to. say that “ any deroga-  V_ l, "
~ ‘tion from this ‘solemn pledge would, in the View of His Majesty‘s_, A “ ~’
; A government, be not only a ﬂagrantbreach of trust, but also, in ‘view, -* ' ‘

l. of the inevitable effect upon the natives, a serious-calafnity, from’
A A which the whole colony wouldpnot fail‘ to suffer.’.’ ’ _

This did not mean, however,‘ that any part of the vast area already . 
taken from the Africans would be returned to them. Indeed, the 1 H \ ‘_\‘ v,

He might well have added that there was no-reason for the Africans A . ‘ V
to believe that the “ solemn pledge " would be honoured. ~ »  ‘ ‘ \- ‘ _,-  - ‘

Within a few yearsof the making ofsthe pledge, it, was put to the A
test by the discovery of gold on land set aside at Kakamega for‘ the  . _ 3
exclusive use of the Kavirondo tribe. The land was largely a malarial‘~ ‘ 9’ 5, 1'“

tribe and proposed its removal to more healthy surroundings.  l " A
The tribal leaders, however, pointing out that they had been already
evicted from one such healthy district to which there‘ was no pros-.
pect of a return, elected to stay at Kakamega‘ andrto drain the swamp, ‘V
making the land habitable. _ - ~ * _ p
The Kenya government was in no moo-d to appreciate such" argu- ‘ ’
ments. The Kavirondo tribe was forcibly moved off the land and the A 1 ~ 
Kenya Legislative Council passed a new law granting concessions‘
there to European gold mining companies. » . ‘ V‘ i , A _ , -
Thus was demonstrated the fact that there is no securityof tenure *  7.,  f‘ »

New Attack on Kenya A
  Trade Unions

By RALPH MILNER

NEW anti-trade union law has been introduced by the govern- '

ment of Kenya, British colony in East Africa.
Africa is in a ferment. With trade unionists playing an active
part, the peoples in every part of that huge continent are struggling

’ against oppression, while the imperialists make ever more frantic

efforts to hold their positions and beat back the movement, for liber-
ation. East Africa is no exception to the general picture. "
The government of Kenya has distinguished itself in recent years
by its cynical and ruthless attacks against the trade unions, and has
now armed itself with a Trade Unions Ordinance which giveslit even_
greater powers than those which it already had. i
The new Bill became law on 25th» April, 1952, and was published
in full in the Otﬁcial Gazette Supplement, Ordinances 1952, on 20t
May,“1952. A t

«The most insolent proposal contained in the Act is that of unions_

“on probation.” \
Probation is a system well—known to English law and is normally

used by criminal courts, which have power to place criminals and .. O

other persons under strict supervision, in order that their every-day

conduct can be observed and guided. ‘ 
Ken'ya’s newlaw will not bring the trade unions underithe system.

operated by the criminal. courts, but will place certain trade unions

under the supervision of the Registrar of Trade Unions, appointed by. -

the governor. ‘
In Kenya, even under the existing law, registration of a trade union

is compulsory. Every trade union must apply to be registered and if -A

registration is refused it must be dissolved.

The grounds upon which the Registrar may refuse registration are
speciﬁed in the new Act, but they are so wide as- to give him almost
unlimited power in this respect. .

One of the many reasons for which the Registrar may refuse regis-
tration is that the secretary or treasurer of the union is, in his opinion,

ptremely weak and ineffective. ‘

"Labour matters. ‘ . ~

S“ incapable, by reason of not being suﬁiciently liter-ate in the English

, for Swahilié language, of carryingpout adequately . . . . (his) d_uties.»”v
' It is in connection with applications for registration that the pro--'

posal for “probation ” is brought in. When a trade union applies
to be registered, the Registrar is to have an absolute discretion to

_defer registration for three months; if he does so, the union is a

\“ probationary trade union ” during the three-month period.
3At‘the end of the three months, the Regis-trar has power either to

I grant or refuse registration. ,
' The inspiration, for this arrogant piece of legislation seems to have '
come f-rom Malan’s South Africa, where the idea of “ probationary’? E
v unions has already b'een,-mooted. - , V V ’
_ Q The other outstanding proposal in this’ new Act amounts to a .

serious attack against the unions on a broadfront. p -
There are to be created new organisations, distinct and separate

.from the trade unions, which are intended to be weak, anaemic imita-

tions of trade unions, the purpose being to offer to: the workers an
alternative to trade unionism and thereby weaken the unions andgsplit

-the workers up into numerous small -groupings. .» «

“‘—.Employees’ Associations” -will consist of workers employed by

- one employer; “ Employees’ Organisations ” will consist of workers
employed by different employers, or the same employer in different "

trades or industries. The third type, “Staff Associations ”‘ will be

_ combinations of workers‘ employed by the central and local organs»
‘ of government.  - V ‘ ’ ’

; Two methods will be used to try to keep these organisations ex-
, First, they’ will not be allowed to
collect conjtributions from their members or have any funds, except
an “office expense fund ” and a ‘_‘ welfare fund.” ~ g
A The oﬂice expense fund is very carefully deﬁned in the Bill and
it is obvious that it is to be kept down to a bare minimum, and ‘it
may not even include "the salary of an executive oﬂicer or secretary.
~ The welfare fund will be administered.under ‘government super-
vision. ‘ r - v -
p Secondly, each organisation must register with the Labour Commis-
sioner and‘ will be under his “ general’ supervision,?’ while special
rules governing the activities and functioning of these bodieswill be
introduced. "by the member of the Legislative Council responsible for

‘ON 20TH OCTOBER, 1952, the Kenya Government declared a state
‘i of emergency and on the instructions of the Churchill Government,
and with the vociferous support of the white settlers in Kenya,
launched an attack against the Kenya people’s democratic
_ Koirganisations. - C
_ .Against a defenceless people, with a population of less than 5f
million, the Government is using Lancashire Fusiliers from the Suez
Canal Zone, additional troops from Tanganyika and Uganda, naval
 I and air forces, policej dogs, armed European settlers and armoured
i /*0 ‘ cars Already 5,000 innocent people have been rounded up and
\ placed behindbarbed wire, without charge or trial. In addition,
' 108” political "leaders have been banished to the remote northern
frontier. The independent schools, catering for 62,000 pupils, which
the people of the Kikuyu ‘tribe had patiently built up at the cost of
great self-sacriﬁce to make up for the Govemment’s neglect of edu-
cation, are to be closed as a source of “ evil inﬂuence ” because they -
0 taught their pupils that they had a right to national independence.
- The people’s livelihood—their cattle, sheep and goats—~—are being
rounded up by the troops and armed settlers, and the people hunted

dom, independence, land, trade union rights and decent wages.
Fascist laws have been introduced, nine newspapers suppressed, and
~ meetings of more than three people banned. A reign of terror has
thus. been introduced. 4
. This attack has been launched under the old, old excuse of sup-
. pressing alleged terrorism practised by a secret society. But the in-
cidence of violent crime in Kenya is no greater than in the neigh-
bouring territory of Uganda. It is certainly less than in most major
. j cities of the United States. The Kenya Commissioner of Police
‘_ ' - , himself has stated: “ We believe the robberies and assaults which
, take place are the work» of ordinary gangs which have no connection
whatever with any secret society.” -
T The real target of the Govemment’s attack is indicated by the
nature of the arrested leaders. They constitute the entire leadership /-

a target of the Kenya Government and the white settlers, because  4

district of the Kikuyu Reserve said that 40 percent of its population

was landless, and gave warning that some 90,000 persons in Kiambu T

‘ might become without means of supportwithin _a short time ’. .~ . . .

Landlessness has the further effect of_ driving Africans ‘into ‘the towns.\

statedthat in and around Nairobi there are 10,000 African families‘

living without proper shelter. And

many receive wages on which they
cannot live.” \ . = * t

Inaddition to these abysmally low wages, full details‘ of which E

Against Oppression I

By SAM wooos

THE British Colony of Kenya is a police state in which the over-
whelming majority’ of the peoplelive in terrible poverty and are
deprived of democratic rights.

The land has been taken away from the Africans. Almost 5 million" .

of them are compelled to live in 52,000 square miles of reserves.’ But
less than 3,000 white settlers own 16,700 square miles of the very best
land in the country. . . I  i I I ‘ I ‘ ' ‘

By squeezing the Africans into these reserves and imposing. arpoll
tax to be paid in cash, the. imperialists have succeeded in turning a
large_ part of the population into wage labour for white settlers and
British monopoly ﬁrms. ‘ '

Within the reserves, there is no democratic local government; real
power resides in the hands of the District Commissioner. In these-
called “White Highlands,” the African workers have practically no
democratic rights whatsoever. Freedom of assembly has in fact ceased
to exist. Local Headmen, appointed by the Government and District

Commissioners, have the power to give or refuse permission for ad .

meeting to, be held and canpdirect where it is to be held.

Organisations of the people are driven underground and daily
arrests, ﬁnes and imprisonments are taking place for meetings that
have not been approved by the headman. . e

In 1950, in this small colony, the police budget was more than
three quarters of a million pounds, and in 1951 will be about £1 mil- ‘
lion. Mass raids on African localities have been organised; progressive, : _ I

Africans are intimidated by midnight raids by police as, for instance,
happened in November 1949, when Kenya Government officers burnt
down 34 huts in the Ndeya reserve rendering scores of men, women
and children homeless. And this is but one small illustration.

On a national political level, in the Legislative Council, 11 members
represent 30,000 Europeans, 5 members 90,000 Indians, 2 members
24,000 Arabs and 4 members 5 million Africans. Moreover these
African members are nominated by the Governor, not elected.

The colour bar and the Pass law pervade all aspects of life. -

 ‘ » APPALLING CONDITIONS OF

AFRICAN WORKERS

HERE -are 385,000 in employment out of a total African popula-
tion of‘ ﬁve millions. Of workers employed in commerce and

‘ industry, over 93 per cent get less than £1 per week; the average

is nearer. £2.88. per month. Agricultural workers are in even a worse
situation. More than three-quarters of them get less than 2l/- per
month. Over 40,000 children are employed who, get on an average»
less than half the wage of an adult male. There are no laws against
employing children, but those under 10 years who are employed are

i supposed to be ‘accompanied by an adult.

The rise, even in the oﬂicial cost of living index, exceeds by 15
points the rise in wages; and as inﬂation gathers speed, the plight of

., the African workers becomes daily more desperate.

The imperialists deny education to the overwhelming majority of
the African people. Whereas £110 per year is spent on -the education

STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION

. / . ,//
FACED with this appalling poverty, intense exploitation, an almost

complete absence of social services, and ‘__a denial of the most

elementary democratic rights, the workers of Kenya, despite the most —
ﬁerce repression by the Government, are struggling valiantly to build. j
a‘ united militant Trade Union‘ movement which will ﬁght to raise 

‘theinstandards ‘oftliving, organise a struggle for democratic rights

and end the domination of the Britishgmonopolies. ‘

The workers of Kenya have considerable traditions ‘of struggle.  

especially during the past few‘ years which have witnessed an un»

precedented spate of anti-Trade Unidn legislation and police violence:  ‘

General strikes took place in_ the port of Mombasa in 1939»; 1944 and

1947. The 1947 strike was in demand forhigher wages and leowe‘r__;:r
house rents. The strike was called by the African Workers‘ _Federa- » 
tion and the Railway African Staff Union, and was joined by hotel,  ‘

shop and domestic workers. Police and troops were used to intimidate
the strikers. a After ‘the strike, Chege Kibachia, ~President _of";_the

‘ African Workers’ Federation,‘ was banished without trial to “a village‘
in North Kenya. where he still remains. Despite the repress’ion,’the'

solidarity and militancy of the workers won certain concessions.
‘In September, 1947; a strike tookvplace at V -the Uplands"JBaco'n

factory. .Again police violence was used against the workers, 522 Sf

them being_ arrested. Of these,~20 were sentenced to two years"hard

labour. During the strike police ﬁred on the workers, killing three * A 

‘of‘ them. »

The rapid development of the “Trade Union ,movement that fol-‘
lowed in the next few years made the irnperialists extremely nervous. .; "
Bill after Bill was rushed through the Legislative Council to limit the .0 *~

’ possibilities of Trade Union organisation and activity. Arres'ts,_sen-
 “tences, banishment, “ frame-ups,’y’. and the employment of every form f ;
"of .armed force‘, was utilised by the imperialists in~a’vain' attempt} to
.crush;;the spirit of the workers‘ of Kenya. 1 ‘ ‘ - '

The Acting‘ Labour Commissioner, Mr. Carpenter . Whose function

‘by..support'in‘g, the Government’s repressive. actions and byhis at-tempts
to split the workers’ ranks and establish tame workers? organisations

’ K that would renounce the struggle. against the employers. . I _ . _
 “In l948 the/Government introduced a Trades Union and Trades
--Disputes Amendment Bill, which gave new possibilities for refusing

to. register“‘ unsuitable unions,” and increased the power of super-
vision over the ﬁnances of the unions by the Government Registrar.
In “September, c1948, Makhan Singh,/the Secretary of the Labour

- Trade Union of East Africa, organised ‘a Cost- of Living and Wages

Conference, the first of—..its kind ever Held’ in Kenya. Delegatesfrom

but his certiﬁcate of permanent residence was refused, after new

. legislation had been introduced in 1949.“

‘ 1111 January‘, 1949, the Government and Railway Administration

workers were banned from taking part. in “political activity” or join-

ing “political associations”ewhich, in effect, ‘seriously hampered their
participation in trade union activity and organisation. Importing of

Unions;‘a “Slave Labour” Bill, introducing forced" labour at starva-
tion rates of pay; and a Deportation Ordinance giving new powers
_to the Government to deport militant Trade Unionists. , '

“ ‘In. January, 1950,‘, further legislation was introduced, outlawing

strikes in “essential, services” (water, electricity, health, hospital, sani-

3 tary, transport), and giving the Governor power to declare any strike-
‘ illegal by adding to the list of “essential services.”. This Bill was
accompanied by an Ordinance Amending the Emergency Powers, Or— ’
