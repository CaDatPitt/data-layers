 

TOWARD A MEANINGFUL PEACE CORPS

. . . A STUDENT PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT

 
  
 
  
  

We support the concept of‘ a Youth Peace N 35 similar to the
proposal by’ President Kennedy. As studené; we are convinced
that this can become an opportunity for yo ;T*adults to feel a
sense of participation in solving the probl‘ s which face the
peoples of the world today. It is a step to ard establishing a
constructive foreign policy which. recognizes America's need to
help underdeveloped countries improve their present economy as
well as our need to preserve and strengthen democratic ideals.
we believe that the implementation.of' a Youthf Peace Corps of
significant size can be a vital part of such a policy's program.

In order for the Youth Peace Corps to be effective and in order to

clearly separate it from the military policiesof the United States,
we urge the following specificsuggestionsiRn*itsimplementation:

1. That ideally the Youth Peace Corps should be set up
through the United Nations and that all countries be
invited to join in its staffing and equipping.

2. That skilled youth without a collegeeducation,as well
as college students and graduates, be included in the
Peace Corps."

3. That there be no political discrimination in selection
of participants.

We urge Congressand the Administration to doeverything possible

to speed the adoption of‘ a meaningful and ‘adequate Youth Peace
Corps program.
