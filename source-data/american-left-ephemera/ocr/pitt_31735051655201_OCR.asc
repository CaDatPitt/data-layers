PRINCIPLES OF UNITY

At the first Thursday night
meeting, initial discussion
took place on the group's pol-
itical perspective. In this
article, our hope is to briefly
summarize three main principles
of unity that we felt came outl
of the meeting. An important
point to consider is that this
attempt is just the beginning
of a continual process to de—
fine the perspective of the
group as a whole. It is our
feeling that detailed political
theory will follow from and

develop through actual political :

practice.

Three main ideas that came
out of the meeting were:
1) Our understanding of_thep
Indo~Chinese war must assume an
anti-imperialist perspective.
The war is not a mistake or a
policy blunder on the part of
higher~echelon officials but
rather a direct result of a
system that seeks to maintain
its socio-economic domination
over the rest of the world.
we must develop understanding‘
and support in_the U.S. for the

Indo—Chinese liberation struggles’
*specifically for the NLF, PEG,

and the Seven Point Peace Program

2) we feel that an active stu-
dent movement has and must

pcontinue to play a crucial role

In the pasty students
have acted as catalysts in
developing support for the anti-
war movement among the masses

of American people. our task
now is to continue the process
of exposing the imperialist na-
ture of the war, especially in ‘
its present mystifying form ~
intensification of the highly-
technological air war and rela-
tive de~emphasis upon the ground
troop war. _

3) We see a need for an on~going
organization that is capable of
educating, organizing and mobil-V
izing students and others in the
struggle against imperialism.

To systematize and forcefully
direct our struggle. mass-based
collective action is a necessity.

MARC" 3.3, RALLY

A march to be held in San,
Francisco has been called for
this Saturday, January 22, by
the Anti-Inperialist Coalition
(AIC). The march has two focus-
es, and represents a new step

for the movement in the Bay Area.,

First, the march is intend-
ed to educate the American people
as to the changing nature of the
war; that despite troop with- ,
drawls, the Nixon admini$ration's
goal in Indochina is still mili-
tary vietory thaough increased
bonping. Second, the march is
intended to focus, as a part of

the growing anti-imperialist move-

ment, on theimperialistie nature
of U.S. foretgn policy and its
goal of world economic-domina-
13101’). ‘
A The A10 is a coalition of.

Bay Area radical and revolution--
ary organizations who have united
in building a strong anti-imper-
ialist movement. The AIC.recog-
nizes the powerful role that has
ibeen played by the anti-war move-
ment, but due to a lack of poli-
tical analysis and leadership,
the anti~war movement has some to
a virtual standstill. What the
AIC proposes is to present an an-

tienmperialist framework with *Hfv.

A

which to educate the 73% or Amer-i
loans now opposed to the war.’
This education will attempt tot‘
provide a clear understanding as
to the nature of the war and the
economic system which necessi-
tates such wars. , T ;A.‘
The coalition is still grow-,
ing. _So far, active groups from-
Berkeley are the Revolutionary ~

ftion, realizing that people are
tired of marching, faces a dil-
emna.. Either marches are a use-
less tactic or, in recent years,
they have lacked tone, politics‘
and leadership. AIC believes
that the latter is the fault.
Thus, a well-planned and execute
rally and march can be a useful
tool for education and nobilizin
the masses of American people.
The march and rallm'which
will begin at noon on Saturday,
January 22 in Union Square, has
three immediate ains: opposition
to the air war in S.E. asia, sup-
port of the G.E. movement, and
implementation of the seven-point

march will be hold through speak-
ers, chants, signs, flags, etc.

AIR FORCE RECRUITERS

The United States Air Force
is coming to Berkeley._ Interviews
will be held on Wednesday, Jan.

26 and Thursday; Jan. 27 from
9 to U in buiidigg T-6 (the plaew

The air Force, as a result

of the Nixon Doctrine, needs more

death machine. aspparently, the
campus is the source. The place-
ment center’8_listing puts it
simply:l "A representative will
interview men for pilot, naviga-

ments, and women for executive

»and technical positions.”

,when a college student signs’

Aup with the Air Force he goes to

Officer Training School at Lack-_
land Air Force Base in San Anton-
ie, where "the OTS course is de-

vsigned to indoctrinate the stu-

&ul

édent on the duties and responsi-
bilities of an officer in a short
period of time." He learns to fly
and navigate (students who can't
even get a $1,000 lon may be in-
terested to know it costs $87,000
to train a pilot and $43,000 to
train a navigator). These men,
will be trained to fly by "exper-
ienced combat veterans; all are
well—qualified and hand-picked
for the job.” T ‘

Recruiter Bill Stephans is
interviewing for navigators, who
in "tedays Air Force," do much
more that guide planes. Included
in the Air Force's description of
his duties are electronic warfare
and radar bombardment. Electron-
ic warfare is described as the na-
vigators’ ability to "ferret out
the enemies radar and communica-
tions systems. to make enemy sys-
tems iroffectrvejand to protect
his own electronic systems from
enemy janning." The navigator
trainees will also learn radar
bombardment: "This course trains
the experienced navigator for

Air Command. The student learns
navigation and bombing techniques,

ment. Problems of reconaissance

PRISON WOBK~

’In the last few years, acti-
vities within this country's pri—
sons have brought increasing at~
tention to the repressive nature
of the criminal justice systen.p.
Repression in the streets is guB~
ed in many forms: in the prisons
this repression has assumed its
clearest form. Unmasked ruling
class violence and new brutality
are employed when "humanitarian"
efforts at psychological control
of prisoners fail. Outright
murder and obvious political fra-
meups are a response to the mili-
tance and proud determination
that this potentially revolution-
ary prison movement represents.

The distance that separates
the prison community from the
outside world is being utilized
by prison officials to maintain
secrecy in their attempts to si-
lence revolutionary voices.
political railroadings are design-
ed to keep notorious prisoners
isolated from the general prison
population. It is within this
context that we must understand
upcoming prison activitees and or

pgoing projects that involve the

prisons. Currently the Solidad
Brothers trial is taking place 11
the 3.F. Hill of Justice, Tues-
day through Fridays. The San
Quentin Sir are heﬁng tried at the
Marin Coun y Covrukousev and An—

gela Davis‘ trial is sch guied b
begin on January 51.’ A17—of these
ipeople are being tvied for their
lives, and it is oxuciul for us
to work for these 1u7ol‘tionariesv
in every possible way.

in mind it is essential for us.b 1
do educational and practical work

to close the gap between the pris-V

oners and the communities. .It B_
vital for us to understand the
workings of the penal system-in
general and also in a systematic
way. The prison Action Confer-
ence, January 28-3O in Pauley

tBallroon, is designed with these

considerations. Action workshops
and educational forums are sched-
uled to lend immediate as well as
long'range community aid to the
prison struggle. The prisoners
are dealing with an arbitrary

and brutal prison systen, which

we must see as the ruling classes’
mechanism to stop any actual or
potential disruption to the social
order. The urgency that the pri~
son novenont denands is real, an.
our active support is vital ~-

is not prison reform but an end‘
