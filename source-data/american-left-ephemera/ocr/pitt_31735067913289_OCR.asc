Vol. XXV. No. 3

March.‘ 1966

Senate Mine Safety Hearings
Slated for March 21 and 2.2 

WASHINGTON, D.C.—-Senate hearings on three federal mine safety legislative
p.roposals for the non-ferrous metals industry will be held on March 21 and 22 before
the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.
Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-Wise.) will chair the hearings, in place of Sen. Pat McNamara
(D-Mich.) who is seriously ill.

International President Al Skinner will represent Mine-Mill before the subcom-
mittee. Supporters of such federal legislation—labor and governmental agencies——will

testify on the first day, with
spokesmen for the American
Mining Congress and other in-
dustry opponents of the bills
scheduled to appear_ on March
22.

In addition to the mine safety
bill passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives by Voice vote on
Sept. 2 last year, the original
version of the Johnson adminis-
tration bill on the subject as
well as the Metcalf-Montoya
mine safety bill will be consid-
ered. Both of the latter are
stronger proposals.

Other Bills

Metcalf-Montoya, for example,
would cover integrated smelters
and refineries and would provide
more s t r i n g e n t enforcement
powers. The original administra-
tion bill, which was amended in
the House of Representatives,
calls for federal inspection and
enforcement rather than allow-
ing states to submit safety pro-
grams of their own, which, if
they meet Department of the In-
terior standards, would be ad-
ministered on the state level.

Mine-Mill and the several oth-
er labor unions which last year
spoke with a unified voice in
support of a strong mine safety
bill are again expected to urge
that the broadest possible bill
r e c e i v e th e subcommittee’s
backing. The unions, for exam-
ple, are. expected to call for the
removal of the state option fea-

Labor’s Political Independence Stressygdd
After Filibuster Death of 14(b) Repe-all

_ ‘Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen was the chief villain in the death last month of the bill to repeal
sect1(_)n'14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, but the losing battle to outlaw state “right-to-work” laws strained labor’s
relations, too, with President Johnson and the Democratic part

CIO executive council met in Bal Harbour, Fla.

Not only did the presidents of 18 AFL-CIO building trades unions unanimously maintain that they would 
regard the administration’s 3.2 percent wage “guidelines” in this year's bargaining, but, additionally, the executive;

council indicated its extreme displeasure with the apparent paring down by the administration in what it ‘Will.

recommend in minimum wage
increases in this session of Con-
gress. _ “ ‘
Repeal of 14(b‘)—the top pri-
ority goal of the American labor
movement in the 89th Congress
—passed_by the House in 1965 by

a 221 to -203 vote, died in the.

Senate without ev-er receiving a
vote on its merits.
Favored by Majority

Although a majority of the
Senators were known to favor
repeal, probably 55 of the 100,
the issue could never be brought
to a vote. Sen. Dirksen (R-Ill.)
led a filibuster against the re-
pealer bill, and a two-thirds ma-
jority (67 Senators if all are
present) is required _to end a
filibuster.

Majority Leader Mike Mans-

A field on Feb. 8 called for cloture

to put a stop to the talkathon
after several weeks, but was
able to muster only a 51 to 48

. favorable vote —-— not the two-

thirds necessary. When, two
days later, another cloture vote
showed little change, the fight
for repeal of 14(b) was called

off for this session.

Party Splits

Republicans split six to 26'

against cloture, which was sup-
ported by the Democrats by a
45 to 23 margin. At the same
time however, labor leaders feel
that neither President Johnson
nor the party leadership in the
Senate fought hard enough for
the repealer bill. Although
Wayne -Morse (D-Ore.) and sev-
en other Senators urged around-

; the-clock sessions “for as many

weeks as it takes to break the
filibuster,” Mansfield did not ex-

tend the length of the daily ses-

sions substantially. ,

Several Democrats .other than
Southerners voted against clo-
ture —»Monroney of Oklahoma,
Lausche of Ohio, Hayden of Ari-
zona, McGovern of South Da-
kota (for. cloture on the first_

I vote, but against-it the second
, time to show his _opposit_ion' to _,
the. repealerbill), and Bible and-

Cannon of Nevada. The latter
two Senators joined Robert Byrd
(D-W. Va.) instating; they would
support repeal if the .bill came

.to a vote, but voting against clo-

ture. ._ .

tee on Political Education—- the
executive council plus 40 other
union officials -— intimated that
candidates will be more closely
examined before financial or
other support will be offered.
Even AFL-CIO President
George Meany, who over the
past many months consistently
has pursued a line of support
for the Democrats, stressed that
labor doesn’t have to
along behind” any political par-
ty. “I don’t buy the idea that we
have no place to go,” main-
tained Meany, saying, “We can
do without the Democrats and
without the Republicans.” He
added that he saw iio need at

‘this time for the organization of

an American labor party.

Minimum Wage Bill

The labor concern over the
loss on the 14(b) repealer un-
doubtedly will be considerably
enlarged if President Johnson
goes along with the proposal of
his Council of Economic Ad-
visors to increase the present
minimum wage of $1.25 an hour
to no more than $1.40 this year
and $1.60 in 1970. Having advo-
cated a $2 minimum, the AFL-
CIO indicates that no compro-
mise would be acceptable that
would provide less than $1.40
now, $1.60 next year, and $1.75
in 1968.

It is no secret that organized
labor was a major factor in the
overwhelming sweeps for Presi-
dent Johnson and the Demo-

cratic party in 1964. A serious-

rupture with labor now-—on min-
imum wage, on the unemploy-
ment compensation bill, on wage
“guidelines”—could have wide-
rangingeffects in the C'ongres-
sional elections this year. Tra-
ditionally, the party in power
can be expected to lose some
seats in such a non-presidential
election year.

Supporters of Repeal

In urging the around-the-clock
sessions to break the _filibuster

“on the 14(b) repealer, Sen,

Morsemaintained that such a
move would alert the nation to

the « little-recognized, fact that the

Senate was -b ein g prevented
from considering a "bill on its
merits. An “aroused public opin-

ion,”_he declared, would insist ‘
on a vote. . I . ' ,

“toady '

thehealth of elder members. He
felt, he said, “at least 4_0 years
younger than some who oppose
the repeal of 14(b) -and yearn
for the era of William McKin-
ley.”

The filibuster against the bill
actually became a" sharply-fo-

cused debate as Morse charged

that the real story on “right-to
work” laws had been “distorted,
misrepresented, and lied about
in the public press, on television
andradio.” “I can see no pos-
sible way,” he said, “in which
the national interest is served
when a factory in one state, op-
erating under union contract and
paying good wages, moves’ to
another state in order to pay low
wages.” '

Head Meets Union

DENVER, Colo.—Dr. Wal-
ter R, Hibbard, Jr., ap-
pointed late last year as the
new director of the U. S.
Bureau of Mines, dropped in
at the Mine-Mill board meet-
ing while in this city last
month to introduce himself
to the union’s leaders and to
stress his concern with’ the
continuing health and safety
functions of the bureau.

Pointingout that he only
had held the directorship for
two months and admitting
that he didn’t yet know all
the ins and outs of the posi-
tion, he pledged “to do the
best job _I can.”

Asking for the union’s
cooperation in helping him
fulfill his responsibilities, he
stated his “personal policy”
that his. door was always
open to those wishing to dis-
cuss problems with him. Dr.
Hibbard -said he Was working
closely with Interior Secre-
jtary Stewart Udall.on the
Mine Safety Bill, and with
Deputy Director Frank Mem-
mott, who had’ served [for
about a’ year as acting direc-

Labor Loses Great Leader;
P TWU’s Michael Quill Dies

NEW YORK, N. Y.——Michael J. Quill, a founder of the Transport Workers Union
and its president throughout its 30-year history, died at his Manhattan apartment on
Jan. 28, only two weeks after the settlement of the New York City transit strike
which achieved a stunning labor victory in the form of a 15 percent gain in wages and

other important contract improvements. .
The fiery, witty, 60-year-old leader of some 135

,0OO TWU members, who had a

long history of cardiac trouble, succumbed to a heart attack. He had suffered an
earlier attack in City Jail shortly after having been-arrested for his refusal to obey
a court order to hal-t the walkout by 36,000 transit workers. He wasttaken to Bellevue

Hospital, remaining there until ,

the strike was settled. Quill was
then transferred to Mt. Sinai
Hospital, from where he was re-
leased on Jan. 24.

The prime target of anti-labor
attacks by mass media and poli-
ticians during the course of the
strike, Quill r e c e i v e (1 high
praise from TWU rank-and-
filers and le a d e r s of other
unions on the two-year contract
package achieved. Following his
death, tributes to the eloquent,

Irish-born unionist filled New
York newspapers.

4000 at Funeral
Over 4,000 persons, including
many labor leaders, attended
the funeral mass for Quill at St.
Patrick’s Cathedral on Feb. 1.
Burial was in the Gate of
Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne,

N. Y. . r
Born in Gourtloughera, Coun-
ty Kerry, Ireland on Sept-. 18,
1905, Quill quit school at age

10 and only a few years later
fought against the British in the
Irish rebellion.

Landing in America on St.
Patrick’s Day in 1926, he got a

job as a laborer in the construc- ‘

tion of a subway station here.
The -following year he sold re-
ligious articles door-to-door in
mining towns in western Penn-
sylvania.

Senate Hesaring-s,e-Kennedy r 

March. ‘I966

Stand Deepen Viet Debate

WASHINGTON, D. C. —— Despite the overwhelming Congressional approval last
week of a $4.8 billion Viet Nam military authorization bill, the deepening debate on
U. S. policy in that country and, for that matter, Asia in general is expected to con-

tinue.

There is wide variation in opinion, for example, in. what the vote on the money
means. While the Johnson administration sees it as an endorsement of the President’s
policy in Viet Nam, a significant number of Senators and Congressmen believe it car-
ries no such implication of blanket approval. Several have indicated they felt they
had little choice but to vote for the bill authorizing purchase of military equipment
for American men fighting in Viet Nam.

The announcement by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara two days later that

. an additional 20,000 U. S. troops were being sent to the Southeast Asian country,

bringing the total to 235,000, al-
most certainly will increase the
concern expressed by an in-
creasing number in the Con-
gress about the danger of con-
tinued military escalation.

Hearings Televised

That concern, which has been
stated o-ver the months by many
church groups, academic lead-
ers, and others, certainly is felt
by a number of the Senators
serving on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, which last
month held nationally televised

..hearings on Viet Nam. Ex-

pressing varying degrees of

. doubt about the present course

of action in Viet Nam were Wil-
liam Fulbright (D-Ark.), chair-

. man .of the committee, Wayne

.Morse (D-Ore.), chief critic of
the present U. S. policy, Frank
Church (D-Idaho), Albert Gore
(D-Tenn.), Eugene McCarthy
(D—MiIm.), Claiborne Pell (D-
R. I.), Joseph Clark (D-Pa.),
George Aiken (R-Vt.), and Clif-
ford Case (R-N. J.). 

Fulbright, McCarthy, Stephen
Young (D-Ohio), and Ernest
Gruening (D-Alaska) join e d
Morse on March 1 in supporting
an amendment to the military
appropriations bill which would
have rescinded the 1964 Gulf of
Tonkin resolution approving the
administration’s use of military
force in Viet Nam.

The historic hearings pro-
duced, too, a casualty in the
television world. Fred Friendly,
head of the news division for
CBS, resigned on Feb. 15 over
the network’s decision to carry
a fifth rerun of an “I Love
Lucy” show rather than the live
coverage of the .app.earance of
George W. Kennan, a former

- « diplomat‘ and .a critic .of:ad.min-

'istration policy, before the For-

t -eign’Relations Committee. CBS-

came back later in the week
with coverage of the appear-

ances of Gen. Maxwell Taylor
and Secretary of State Dean
Rusk. '

Emphasis on Talks

Another bombshell was
dropped on Feb. 19, when Sen.
Robert F‘. Kennedy (D-N. Y.)
released a statement calling for
increased emphasis on attempt-
ing to settle the Viet Nam situa-
tion at the conference table. A
huge hassle quickly erupted
over the Kennedy release,
which has been modified and
"expanded, upon since that time.

The chief explicit difference
between the Kennedy position
and that of the administration
is that the brother of the late
President believes that the Na-

tional Liberation .Front,..politica~l.

arm of the Viet Cong, should be
represented as an “independent
entity” in any negotiations that
are brought about. The Johnson
administration, on the other
hand, takes the view that the
front must be represented at
the conference table by the
North Vietnamese government
in Hanoi.

“A negotiated settlement,”
maintained Kennedy, “means
that each side must concede
matters that are important in
order to preserve positions that
are essential.” This could re-
sult, he added, in “a compre-
mise government fully accept-
able to neither side.”

Strongly defending the duty of
the Senate to fully debate U. S.
foreign policy, Kennedy con-
cluded, “. . . if we now can
clearly define our ‘ends in South
Viet Nam, if we can at least
begin .discussing .what our fu-

ture relations with mainland‘ ‘
. Chinaare to~.be,:if‘?we‘can adapt

our ‘meansrto these ends, and,
mostvimportant, if wercan use
only that force~—and no more-
that is needed to accomplish

 ~-M—M, ILWU C ooperaﬁng J
In Calif. PoIiﬁcalAcfion

.. SACRAMENTO, Calif.——With-. the. California legislature meet-

" ing in short session, the bills that may be introduced are limited.
Yet, since the budget is the major issue to be discussed, certain
proposals involving finances may be acted upon this Year.

Bearing this in mind, legislative proposals on automobile in-
surance, taxes, welfare, and housing were discussed at a Jan. 22
meeting here of the International Longshoremen’s and Warehouse-
men’s Union’s Legislative Council, which was attended by repre-

sentatives from Mine-Mill Lo-
. cals 50, 51, and 266, -all located
in the San Francisco Bay area.
As in previous years, Mine-
Mill is working with the ILWU
on the legislative level, contrib-
uting to help sustain lobbyists
in Sacramento. Another meeting
of the legislative council was
held on Feb. 26 in Oakland.
Shelley. Morse Parleys
‘On the following day, Feb. 27,
Mine-Mill International Repre-
sentative Thomas McGuire and
other representatives from the
union attended a brunch and

'9‘ meeting with San Francisco

Mayor John F. Shelley——one of
a series of discussions spon-
so1'ed by a wide range of labor
leaders in the Bay area. An ear-
. lier such meeting on Jan. 9, at-
tended by some 250 labor rep-
resentatives, f e a t u r e d U. S.
Senator Wayne Morse (D-Ore.),
who discussed prospects for la-
bor legislation in 1966 as well
as the situations in Viet Nam
and-Latin America.
Shelley, a former labor leader

himself, has been receiving of
late some rough treatment from
the labor movement here, which
has charged that the mayor has
turned his back on labor. At
a meeting of the San Francisco
Labor Council in January, dele-
gates openly attacked Shelley,
and later union members pick-
eted City Hall in attempting to
win pay raises for city em-
ployees.

George Johns, secretary of
the San Francisco Labor Coun-
cil, is among the sponsors of the
series of labor meetings at the
Townehouse in San Francisco.
Others include Harry Bridges,
president of the ILWU; Daniel
F. Del Carlo, secretary of the
San Francisco Building and
Construction Trades Council;
Joseph J. Diviny, president of
Teamsters Local '85; Wendell
Phillips, secretary of the Bak-
ery Drivers Union; and Thomas
A. Rotell, ‘secretary of the
Pacific Coast Metal Trades
Council. '

these objectives, then there is
hope that they may be achieved
without prohibitive cost to our-
selves, to the people of Viet
Nam, or to the peace of the
world.”
China Policy Probe

Fulbright, meanwhile, has in-
dicated that his committee hopes
to hold hearings in the near fu-
ture on the broad issue of U. S.
policy concerning China.

Speaking for the House Re-
publican Policy Committee, on
the other hand, Rep.-John J.
Rhodes (R-Ariz.) called upon
President Johnson to stifle the
“divisive” foreign policy de-
bate a-nd “to disavow those
within his party who would di-
ivide:this.-country as they have

. divided the -Democratic party."

7"l'l'he Fallacy of Guidelines-
-For -Wages? Yes--For Profits? llo

By Al Skinner ,
, International President

 , AST MONTH’S MEETING of the AFL-CIO executive
'  council opened up a barrageof criticism against the
':_,,-Administration’s 3.2 percent “wage guidelines” theory.
’ Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz had the _unpleasant task
 of defending to the labor leaders this ‘fholol-wages-down”
theory. Members of. the council asked Secretary W1rtz
 when the Johnson administration was going to apply
if-‘giiidelines for profits,” and numerous other embarrass-
 ingg, questions.
r, f ‘ -In case you don’t remember, the “wage guidelines”

thedry was first advanced in 1962 by President Kennedy’s
- -council of economic advisors. They “estimated” at that
time that production per man-hour -was increasing at
2" the rate of 3.2 percent per year. Therefore, if wage in-
 gcreases were held to that level each year, such increases
_..-[would not be “inflationary.” Workers’ pay would only
*be increased for increased production.

Why Not Guidelines "for Profits?

.  ‘F COURSE, _nothing was ever said about controlling
-1 _ ‘profits or the salaries of . management _.,people, etc.
:'.*'=Inr 1965 alone, " management salaries and fringe benefits
increasetf by 11 percent, while, using the "council"-of} eco-
‘ .. iomic ‘advisers’ figures, profits have increasedby 67- per-

   
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
   
  
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
    
  
  
  
    
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
   
 
  
    
   
   
   
 
  
   
     
   

'. ‘cent in the past five years. Last
:5; year -Congress passed and the
‘President signed a bill increasing
'-r‘nilitary:-fpay by 10 percent.

 :No -one at any time has raised
§the"q.uest-ion of the 3.2 percent
eiguideline theory in any of these
'1.i':.‘d’e\/‘elopments. But when the New
(York subway strike resulted in a
~-3-fvery ‘substantial wage settlement,
ievegrybody in the Administration
axfrom the. President on down got
‘every concerned. Mike Quill was
  publicly attacked for the “exor-
 bitant demands" advanced by him for the New York
.-gtransit workers. According to several Administration
.'spokesmen, this wage settlement was “blackmail.” It
broke through the “guidelines.”

1.  As.» far as I am personally concerned, Mike Quill
knew -what he was doing. He did what every honest trade
tunion leader should be doing—that’s putting the welfare
oflhis membership first. Even in death, he shamed some
ee':labor.~leaders who still think the membership and their
'T7_ families come second to other considerations. Mike was
 not a ‘.‘labor statesman”—he was a labor leader!

THHE MINE-MILL UNION

Present Board Members
Acclaimed by Delegates

. , TRAIL, B.C.——Rejecting the “invitation” by District
6 Director Larry Sefton of the United Steelworkers of
,America for “merger” with his union and the abandon-
ment of their Canadian autonomy, some 125 delegates
to Mine-Mil1’s 14th- Canadian convention countered with
proposals that the Steelworkersremove barriers to labor
unity by making the Canadian Labor Congress repre-
sentative of every union in the country and-_allow the
Steel rank-and-file to debate their union’s -raiding policy
at aconvention. . _ I . .

Meeting at_ the Trail Labor Center here,‘ the l1ead-
quarters. of Mine-Mill Local 480, from Jan. 17-20, the
delegates concentrated on negotiations in this favorable
bargaining year of skyrocketing company profits. Mine-
Mill contracts with such industry giants as Cominco open
this year.

Delegates expressed support for a policy of active
bargaining cooperation with Steel and other unions, so
long as needs of the workers were placed before “any
jurisdictional ambitions.” Also
endorsed was an aggressive
program of expansion in the
organization of the unorganized.

.On Jan. 19, all of the present
members of the national execu-
tive board were nominated for
re-election without opposition-
receiving standing ovations upon
their acceptance speeches. The
Canadian board is comprised of
Ken Smith, president; Harvey
Murphy, vice-president; William
Longridge, secretary - treasurer;
and William Kennedy and A1
King, board members from the
eastern" ' and western districts
respectively.‘ A  _ i

' Address by Skinner

Soundingthe positive keynote
for the convention was Interna-
tional ‘President Al Skinner in
h_is Tuesday address to the dele-
gates, when he maintained, “We
are going to push in both Can-'
ada and the‘ United States for
the biggest and best contract
settlements in the history of
this industry.”

Murphy chaired the conven-
tion’s wage. policy and bargain-
ing committee, which recom-
mended as the objective of all
local unions the immediate
opening of all contracts for
interim increases flowing from
the accelerating cost of living.
In a -number of instances, the
committee reported, this al-
ready’ has been done. At other
properties, such as Falcon-
bridge, the demand is before
the company, with the workers
actively pressuring that the con-
tract be opened for immediate
wage relief. . »

r Robin McArthur,a business

effects of automation,” said
that all future contracts must
pay “the utmost attention” to
this problem.

Touching upon the subject of
technological change in the in-
dustry, Donald Brothers, min-
ister of mines for British
Columbia, declared that it
“might mean fewer jobs at
individual mines, but there is
eve-ry possibility that the more
efficient mines will be able to
survive in" "a competitive world
and thus the over-all demand
for labor will not decrease.”
Addressing the convention on
Monday ‘afternoon, he predicted
that mineral production in the
province this year will exceed
that of record-breaking 1965.

‘Responsible Leadership‘

Noting. that Mine-Mill has the
largest membership in the-Far
North, Arthur Laing, a federal
cabinet member, who spoke to
the delegates by tape since he
was unable to attend in person
due to 'the opening of Parlia-
ment, said that a “tremendous
amount” of exploration is going
on in the Yukon and the North-
west Territories. “Quite a num-
ber” of new mines, he declared,
will be brought in over the next
few years. ,

“Responsible union leader-
ship” in the Far North at this
time is vital to the Canadian
government, Laing said, stating
that Mine-Mill has fulfilled that
role. The union, he said, had
shown great, cooperation in the
work of a commission set up by
the ‘government to study labor

TRAIL LABOR CENTER, HEADQUARTERS OF MINE-MILL LOCAL 480. in Trail, British
Columbia was the site of the 14th Canadian Mine-Mill convention from Ian. 17 to 20.
The present national . executive board members, all of whom were nominated for
re—election without opposition; received standing ovations from the delegates upon their

acceptance speeches.

ganizational expansion, and
more effective research, publi-
city, and servicing work, the
delegates unanimously agreed
as well with a proposed per
capita increase of’ 50 cents per
member per month. The ques-
tion will be decided by a refer-
endum vote of the entire Cana-
dian membership, scheduled for
April 6. '

In rejecting by a wide margin
a resolution proposed by Local
663 in Britannia calling for
Mine-Mill support of the New
Democratic Party, the delegates
were, according to President
Smith, not attacking that party,
but simply reaffirming the
union’s traditional policy of
having no direct political con-
nections with any party. The
resolution had cleared the legis-
lative and political action com-
mittee, chaired by Rod Black
of Bralorne.

_ Peace Resolution

convention approved a resolu-
tion supporting an immediate

THE‘ MINELMILL "UNION"

(“Rosenblum Urges Labor
 “Take Stand for Peace"

DETROIT, Mich.—Calling upon the labor movement to “make
itself heard” in its “deep commitment to peace,” Frank Rosen-
blum, general secretary-treasurer of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America, addressing the ACWA Central States Joint
Board, maintained, “Peaceis the paramount issue today, and the
rly days needs to be rekindled if we are to

courage of labor’s ea
achieve it.”

The principal speaker at the joint board’s 25th anniversary
banquet here in January, Roseblum was sharply critical of U. S.
Viet Nam policies and of the AFL-CIO convention’s support of
those policies. He praised those opposing the war in Viet Nam and

singled out the student groups,
country are doing an excellent
job, but they don’t have enough
support.” I _

“The AFL-CIO convention in
San Francisco,” he stated, “did
not give them the support I am
expressing now.”

“The important thing today,”
stressed Rosenblum, “is to take
our stand for peace and chal-
lenge the forces of reaction.”

Speaking to a crowd of some
450, including many business
and civic leaders as well as
labor leaders, he said, “Our

major concern today should be -

that there is a future worth.
living. . . . The danger of-total
destruction ‘hangs over our
heads.” “. . . there.can be no
more winners -in a waruin the
classical. sense,” - he declared.

Erie UAW Leader Dies;
Was Friend ofLocaI 711

'ERIE,iPa.—Frank J. Anasti, a sub-regional director for the
-United ‘Auto Workers who was appointed to the City ‘Council here
on Jan. 12 to fill'a vacancy, died suddenly on Jan. 30—the victim
of a heart attack.

The officers and members of Mine-Mill Local 711 in nearby
Fairview joined other labor leaders and Democratic party officials
inmourning his death. In addition to helping the local on numerous
occasions in such matters as the selection of arbitrators, Anasti

‘was a strong force for labor unity in Erie County.
An officer of the Erie Central Labor Union, AFL-CIO, Anasti
strongly opposed union raiding and also encouraged the formation

of a unified labor council which
would provide financial and

- manpower. assistance in any

strike in the area. The fourth

‘ , meeting to establish such a

council was held on Feb. 25 at
the IAM hallhere.

Stauffer Group
Conference Held
On Feb. 12 & 13

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -
Representatives of five interna-
tional unions met at the Olympia
Hotel here on Feb. 12 and 13 to
continue discussions on the co-
ordination of bargaining with the
Stauffer Chemical C o m p a n y.
The uniform bargaining pro-
gram adopted by the delegates
includes demands for non-con-
tributory insurance and pension
programs, a sick leave plan sim-
ilar to the one in effect at the
properties represented by Mine-
Mill, improved vacations, nine
paid holidays, and an increase
in shift differentials.

The Mine-Mill locals propose,
additionally, that severance pay
be a demand in negotiations,
which will open for several of
the locals ‘this. summer. Stauffer
contracts with_ Mine-Mill Locals
50 and 266 in San Francisco and

Richmond respectively expire on

June"-A30, as doesfthe agreement
with the Chemical Workers Un-
ion at the Berkeley plant.

Other unions represented at
the meeting were Oil-Chemical,
the International Association of
Machinists, and the Laborers
Union.

-.Deleg.ateswelected D. .E. Stutts

- of the Chemical Workersas the
' new -coordinatoraof. the Stauffer

Conference. Other new officers
are Joel Wilson of the Chemical
Workers Local 571 in Garfield,

honey of Laborers Local 163 in
Butte, Mont., secretary.

Another meeting will be held
on June. 18 and 19 at a place to

' be determined by the coordina-

tor.

Mine-Mill Local 904 in Mel-
rose, Mont. also has a contract
with Stauffer Chemical.

Construction Unions R-eiect "Guidelines"
Building trade unions have ﬂatly rejected a proposal worked
out by the Johnson administration to impose wage restrictions in
the construction industry. The plan would have set up a national
labor-management board to mediate local wage disputes and rec-
ommend settlements. Presidents of 18 construction unions unani-
mously turned down the request for imposition of the “guidelines,”

saying they would be discriminatory unless applied to all sections
of the economy, including profits.

Soft Coal Negotiations
Indications are that bargaining this year for soft coal miners
by the United Mine Workers will stress non-wage issues. The
union’s last settlement gave rise to internal dissension over
failure to improve job security and fringe issues.

New "Fair Labor Standard" Proposed
Congressman Elmer Holland (D-Pa.) has introduced a bill to
amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide for an annual
three-week paid vacation for workers covered by the act. Rep.
Holland said the purpose of the bill is to set up “a new labor.
standard” with the three-week vacation, to add to the already
established standards of the eight-hour day and the 40-hour week.

"University in Exile" 1 Established
The United Federation of College Teachers, which has struck

St. John’s University, has opened a “university in exile” about

three quarters of a mile from the school’s Jamaica, New York
campus. Union spokesmen say the purpose is to keep the students
in touch with their regular professors. The strike is in its third
month and Father Peter 0’Reilly, chairman of the union chapter
at St. John’s, has accused the school administration of bringing in

strikebreakers in violation of a New York City code provision L

prohibiting such importation. ' ‘

Re-election of Hoffa Seems Sure

With the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court to review the
conviction of Teamsters President James R. Hoffa on jury tamper-
ing charges, labor observers figure Hoffa will probably be un-
challenged for the presidency at the Teamsters’ upcoming July
convention. Leading contenders for the office are understood to
have said privately they would not oppose Hoffa, but would run
if the office were vacant at the time of the election. Supreme Court
action on Hoffa’s case will probably not take place until the next
court session opens in the fall of 1966.

Automation in Southern Forests

The Southern Pulpwood Conservation Association reports that
jobs in pulpwood forests in the South dropped from 96,000 in 1960
to about 80,000 in 1964, while production increased from 24 million
to 28.8 million cords during the same period.

The figures were revealed in a New York Times story on a
machine that fells, strips, cuts and stacks timber. The machine
needs one operator and a truck driver, and displaces 12 men using
conventional. power saws and loading equipment. _ _ 0

Southern Negroes have made up 80 to_‘90 percent of the
pulpwoodgatherers, at pay starting around the federal minimum
wage of $1.25 per hour.

British National Severance Pay

British workers are now covered by a national severance pay
plan established by act of Parliament this year following meetings
between the Minister of Labour, the national employers organiza-
tion, and the Trades Union Congress. Although severance pay plans
had previously been=in.-effect as a result of company-union negoti-
ations in some individual plants, only about one-sixth of British

"workers were covered, and many of the plans did not‘ provide

severance pay, but merely detailed layoff procedures.

The national plan now in effect covers employees permanently

dismissed as “redundant”-—workers whose skill is no longer re-
quired or whose jobs have diminished or been done away with. All _
workers over age 18, with two years of service, are covered.
' The amount of severance pay is determined on the basis of age
and service. Workers between 18 and 21 get a half-week’s pay for
each year of service; those -22 to 40 get one week’s pay per year of
service; those between 41 and 64 get one-and-a-half weeks’ pay for
each year of service. Payment tapers off month by month as a
worker nears retirement (age 65 for men and 60 for women).

A permanently laid-off worker is given severance pay in a
lump sum by his employer. The employer, in turn, can get a
rebate of about two-thirds of that amount from the national re-
dundancy fund, into which every employer pays fivepence per week
for every man on his payroll and twopence per week for every
woman. Should a firm go bankrupt, its employee’s benefit comes
directly from the national fund.

An employee receiving redundancy pay is still eligible for
regular unemployment insurance during the time he is jobless.

‘V New Reading for Consumers

The March issue of CONSUMER REPORTS carries mention
of three new publications available from the Superintendent of
Documents, Washington, D.C., 20402, that offer consumers valuable
information.

A new edition of “Consumer Information,” PL 86, contains
two new sections——a list of more than 50 titles now offered in

’ Spanish and a selected list of titles of particular interest to the
elderly, printed in giant-sized type, the Report says. Consumers
Union also calls attention to a leaflet prepared by the U. S. Depart-

'ment of Agriculture that has become a best seller. It is called
_“Consumer’s Quick Credit Guide” and comes in the form of a

billfold-size folder that tells how to compare interest rates. It, too,
is now available in Spanish as well as English. The Department of
Agriculture's experiment with a yearbook focused on consumer
problems and entitled “Consumers All,” struck a great response.
The first printing sold out within eight weeks.

__ CU points out that single copies of the-catalog are available
7 from the Superintendent of Documents without charge, while bulk
' lots can be had at a price of $7.50 per 100. The Quick Credit folder

costs 5c each or $2.50 per 100 copies, and Consumers All will cost

$2.75 when it is again available from Washington.

, * ‘k ‘Ar
Exi'oriion?—Or, Simply Creclii As Usual?

. “Extortion, pure andisimple,” was the way an‘ Army legal
. , officer described what was happening to his men. But technically
speaking, it wasn’t extortion at all, for what the debt collectors
were_ doing was quite legal. Whether it is right, is the question
raised by the March issue of CONSUMER REPORTS. The story
rev.iews the one-sidedness of credit laws as brought to light by
-/steps taken by the Pentagon to curb some collection and reposses-
, sion tactics used against servicemen.
'_ Here are some of the little known facts of how a credit trans-
' " .. actioncan work out: ' - - . _ _
V 1. If a dealerhas gotten cash by selling your contract to a
' finance company, it does you no good to threaten to withhold
‘ payments if theipurchase is unsatisfactory. And in a ma-
jority of’ states, you can’t bring against -the finance company
.many of the’ claims ‘you might have _brought againstthe
dealer. _. ; ‘ ' g ‘ ed '
“'2. Typically, insurance, on a car, finance charges for twoor
-- three years at 30% true annual interest plus. credit life in-
surance may easily double the price of a used car costing,
. say $600. A. (I _ V . -
"3; A ma'n.unable’t‘o“ keep up the payments’ on such a $1200
* -deal -after paying $200, asks the finance company to take
it back. They do, selling it below value to a dummy bidder
for say, $200. The manfinds he still owes $800 and has no
- car (a “hypothetical” but “typical” case). .
4. A civilian may find his salary garnisheed (legally partially
withheld for the lender) or be fired if his employer won't
A‘ 1 permit garnishees. _ ~ , _,
‘5. If a serviceman,_he might be dishonorably discharged as.a
L '1 ‘result _of pressure by the finance company, which the law
at present allows. ’

.,_st,ruck back with Defense Department Directive 1344 7. CONSUMER
 -REPORTS says: “‘The directive represents probably the first at-
 L gtemptby a Federal agency to define standards of fairness in the
J ’ execution of retail credit contracts.” Here are some of its provi-
- sions:
 . 1. Repossession ofsecurity, a -car, for instance, will serve as
. _ g_pay_ment in full. ,. V , ,
2. Ifthe contract calls for an insurance policy, it shall be ‘de-
-- livered within 30 days and reflect the promised coverage.
“)3. Late payment penalties, should. be no more than. 5%," at-
,.  torney’s fees not more than 10%.. _ ‘ ‘
4. Any valid defense that a borrower may be able to use
- against the seller or original,-lender willbe equally valid"
_ "Q against‘ subsequentholders of the debt (‘finance companies).
5. Except when“ a product is being custom made, a serviceman
v . _-. “ 3 "should be free to cancel an order any time before delivery;
' 6.-Finance charges shall be itemized (but unfortunately, the
‘ regulations don’t call for disclosure of the true annual in-
.. ._ _  terest rate). - - , I . ..
 jg-.  Military authority cannot overrule civil law, CONSUMERS
_  TREPORTSI pointsout. Therefore, -the Pen'ta'g,on’s directive is in
 »‘full.f.orce onlywhen applied to companies‘ doing business directly
f  ion" a military post or advertising inunofficial military publications.
,  Despite shortcomings, the directive has put the heat on the finance
 ‘companies and has caused them to mend some ofrtheir abusive
vfways. The .article.says. that consumer groups in Massachusetts feel

 support for a good retail-installment sales bill in the Ba-y state.

joint negotiations have taken

. place with American Zinc, Ana-

- panies.

Some of these efforts have
been coordinated by the Indus-

. Among the pension proposals

‘emerging from the convention.

and board. discussion are‘: An
increase in the basic benefit
amount to $5.50 per month per
year of service plus a, cost-of-

Honored Upon 
His Retirement    

An appreciation dinner honor-
ing James G. Patton, president
of the National Farmers Union,
will be held in Washington, D.C.
on March 28, sponsored by
American labor leaders.

Head of the 750,000-member
NFU for the past quarter of a
century, the 63-year-old farm
leader will retire at the organi-
zation’s 64th annual convention
this month in Denver.

Mill executive board meeting,
President Al Skinner wrote to
Patton to express the board’s __
best wishes for “many years of 0
health in your well-deserved
retirement.” _
Maintaining that Patton’s re- . ’

tirement “leaves a big vacuum
in the leadership of the ‘progres-
sive movement,” the board said,’
“There are not many in the
ranks of the farm movement or»
in the labor movement, for that

inspections of Molana Phosphate Mines

The U. S. Bureau of Mines reinspected late last year two phosphate mines operated in Montana

by Cominco American, Inc.
which were the following:

0 Motor-generator sets should
be installed on a fire-resistant
material.

0 Underground substations
should be installed in fire-resis-
tant rooms.

0Loose rock near the 5017
chute on the 5000 level should be
supported properly.

OA fan with attached vent
tubing should be installed in
the 5002 drift south.

0 The vent tubing should be
extended into the 5971 stope.

O The auxiliary fan in the
4602 drift south should be moved
closer to the working face to
provide adequate ventilation of
the area.

0 The air current on the 5900
level should be directed to the
working sections of the level.

0 The 2,300-volt power cable
in the 5105 service raise should
be mounted where persons can-
not contact or grasp the cable
while traveling in the raise.

. O The electric blasting cable
should be mounted on insulators

The reports of these inspections listed safety recommendations among

and away from power cables,
pipelines, and other possible
sources of stray currents.

O The electric b l a s t i n g
switches in 5201 “C" drift north
and 5201 “B” drift north should
be locked in the “off” position
when not in use.

0 The electric blasting switch
in 5202 “C” drift south should
be identified.

0 The broken ladder rung in
5213 raise should be replaced.

0 The muck lodged behind the
ladder rungs in 5213 raise should
be removed. '

0 Men should not stand on

Petitions Back Kennedy’s

Statement on Viet Nam

BUFFALO, N. Y.—The political action committee of Mine-Mill
Local 593 now is in the process of circulating petitions to be sent
to U. S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N-.Y.) urgingto‘ .“keep.up.

the good work for peace.”

Maintaining that “A ceasefire in Viet Nam and a conference

of all interested parties including the Viet Cong based on the 1954

Geneva Agreement is in the best interests of‘ thenmerican people .-
and an important step toward achieving peace in Asia,” the peti-
tion specifically supports Kennedy’s recommendation for the par-
ticipation of the Viet Cong as a party to negotiations in Viet Nam.

The statement, too, quotes U. S.
Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark.)

. .__on the necessity of including in
fw"‘°“”"peace negotiations all parties

that -are fighting if that fighting
is to be stopped.

The chief c1ear~cut. difference
between Kennedy’s position and
that of the Johnson administra-

tion is that the brother of the.

late President believes the Na-
tional Liberation Front, political
arm of the Viet Cong, should
participate in negotiations as
“an independent entity,” while
the administration maintains
that the front must be repre-
sented by the North Vietnamese

,.e-mw:-egovernment in Hanoi. The Sena-

tor’s initial statement of Feb.‘
19, which caused perhaps even
abigger stir than‘ the lengthy
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee hearings on Viet Nam,
has been expanded upon and
modified somewhat since that
time.

Bill on Unemployment
In other action, the Local 593

committee sent letters to Ken-

nedy, Jacob K. Javits (R), the

. state’s other U. S. Senator, and

Congressmen Thaddeus Dulski,

. Henry P. Smith, and Richard D.

- tion system.

 

McCarthy urging their support

I - for H. R. 8282, a bill for a fed-
‘ eral ‘unemployment

compensa-

~“’l‘he wider coverage,—- the ex-'

tended period for which bene-
fits would be paid, the limited
disqualifications, and the in-
creased weekly benefits result-
ing from this bill,” saidrthel let-
ter, “would benefit unemployed
workers and their families, the
entire economy of our state and
our nation,- including‘ the land.-'
lord, merchant, and grocer who
also would "benefit from the in-
creased purchasing power of
the unemployed."

Edward Mic-halski is the
chairman of the Buffalo Brass
and Copper Workers .Union’s
political action committee. The
letters to the Senators and Con-
gressmen also we1$=‘signed by
Pascal Pacile, pre_sident of the
local, and Joseph Scio1i‘,fsinterna-
tional representative.

Charges Exchanged
In Blast ,,Probe

The methane gas explosion on
Dec. 28 which took the lives of
nine men at the Dutch Creek
Coal Mine in Redstone, Colo-
rado is still reverberating.
UMWA District President Fred
K. Hefferly has charged in a
letter to Colorado Governor
John Love that the Aspen Coun-
ty coroner’s hearing “was a
complete farce” and is demand-
ing that the state legislature
make an investigation.

Workers at Dutch Creek are
not represented by the United
Mine Workers, but are mem-
bers of an independent union.
Hefferly claims, however, that
a fairly good number of the
miners are UMWA members.

Robert Delaney, vice-presi-
dent of Mid-Continent C‘oal &
Coke, operator of the mine, ac-
cuses Hefferly o “consistently
lying” about the company and
about working conditions at the
mine, and is threatening a libel
action.

Meantime, the U. S. Bureau of
Mines has conducted an investi-
gation.

Rail Accidents Up.

ICC Report Shows

H. E. Gilbert, president of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire-
men and Enginemen, charges
that the ICC report of a 10.9 per-

cent increase‘ in rail accidents
for 1964 represents “the impact .
of removal of firemen (helpers)
from freight ' and yard loco-

mo,tives’.’. which began.-in May
of 1964.

The Interstate Commerce
Commission report cites, in ad-
dition, a~12.9 percent’ increase in
train accident fatalities, 5,317
train accidents (495 more than
the previous year), and a con-
tinued rise in safety law viola-
tions. 2,344 persons were killed
in 1964, 267 more than in 1963.

Gilbert added, “We estimate «

conservatively that more than

10 percent of the accidents that ,

should be reported are not,”
and called for tougher enforce-
ment procedures bythe ICC.

In a related development, the , if
U. S. Supreme Court,ruled't.hat.F

the compulsory arbitration law
which" authorized the elimina-
tion of 17,500 locomotive helpers
jobs did not nullify state “full

crew” laws which specify train _

crew makeup. Twelve states had
such laws, but eight of them
were repealed in the past year.

High Court

to Review  5 

James Hoffa Conviction I 7

WASHINGTON, D.C. -—— The
U. S. Supreme Court agreed on
Jan. 31 to review the conviction
of Teamsters President James
R. Hoﬁa on charges of jury-
tampering. With the high court
due to adjourn its current ses-
sion in June, it is doubtful that

oral arguments in the case are ‘

presented before the court’s
next term, which begins in Oc-
tober.

The review is limited toxthe

single issue’ of .-whether Hoffa:’s 5'

constitutional ‘rights were --vio-
lated by the government’s use
as a witness in. thejury-tamper-
ing case of a “secret informer,”
who sat in on some defense
strategy sessions at an earlier

trial.‘ » ’ '

Edward G. Partin, himself
facing a number of criminal
charges, none of which are
currently being prosecuted, was
the key government witness in
Hoffa’s Chattanooga, Tenn. trial
which resulted in his conviction

and a sentence of eight years-

in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Hoffa’s attorneys maintain that
Partin, a member of the defense
