Q§9§gQ§§_§: Eight hundred students move into Sproul Hall after a rally. They
regard the action as a last resort in the face of the Administration's refusal to
negotiate the student grievances and its "arbitrary singling out students for punish:
ment." The fourth floor becomes a quiet study hll, while movies are shown and
classes are held on the second floor. Strict discipline is maintained; orders to
stay out of offices are given and obeyed.

December g: Governor Brown dispatches more than six hundred policemen to arrest
the eight hundred students. The arrests go on for about twelve hours. Faculty are
barred from the building during arrests. Meanwhile, a spontaneous strike is called
and most classes are not held. Lawyets and faculty meet with the judge and the
district attorney all day and finally, late at night, work out a bail arrangement.
Nine hundred faculty members meet and call for amnesty and complete political free»

idem, including unrestricted advocacy. All day-department chairmen try to contact

Administration, to no avail; apparently, Administration has orders not to talk to
faculty members.

December 5: The final busload of released students arrives on campus shortly
before noon. Meanwhile, the campus is being struck. Sixty to seventy percent of

vthe students stay away from class. Two departments cancel classes and many pro-

fessors honor the picket lines. The chairmen of all the departments constitute

ithemselves as a Council of Chairmen to fill the.vacuum.of authority on campus.

December §—6: All weekend the Chairmen meet to work out a compromise to save
the University. Sunday, Professor Scalapino, head of the Council of Chairmen, meets
with President Kerr and works out an agreement which is approved by chairmen and is
presented to an informal Regents meeting in a motel near the San Francisco Airport.
On Sunday, two hundred professors meet to plan strategy to get the Academic Senate
to endorse complete political freedom and amnesty. The FSM and the GCC (Graduate

‘Coordinating Committee) agree to call off the strike as of Monday midnight.

December I: The departmental chairmen call off all classes between 9:00 and
noon and hold departmental meetings to discuss the chairman's agreement with the
President: complete campus amnesty for acts through today is granted. No position
on the advocacy question is taken.

Professor Robert Scalapino, Chairman of the oPolitical Science Department, and
President Kerr address l8,000 students at an "extraordinary convocation" in the,
Hearst Greek Theatre. Many faculty members express their reluctance to support
President Kerr by their cool reception of his speech.

Mr. Savio walks to the podium after the adjournment of the meeting, but is
grabbed from behind by two policemen and detained in a dressing room. Finally,
he is brought out and allowed to speak. He says that he had only intended to
announce a rally at noon on the Sproul Hall steps.

At the rally, several departmental chairmen speak along with the FSM leaders,
who explain that the strike will be called off so that the Academic Senate may
deliberate in peace the proposals on political freedom of the two hundred profes~
sors. Meanwhile President Kerr meets with the professors who drafted these resolu-
tions; word is spread that he has endorsed the resolutions. Later that afternoon,
the Academic Freedom Committee and the Chairman's Council endorses the proposals with
little change. The students call off the strike. .

December 8: A tense campus focusses quietly on the meeting of the Academic
senate. After an hour and a half of debate, the Senate endorses 824 to ll5 the ; _
the resolutions of the Academic Freedom Comittee. The FSM applauds the move as
victory for the entire university. Faculty and students voice hope that the Regents
will heed this 7-1 mandate. .

 

 

 

December 10: Academic Senate tables motion aimed at thwarting future student
strikes. ‘

 

December 18: The Regents decides unanimously to submit proposed rules change
to a threeeman comittee. They reaffirm the necessity to enforce existing rules
and to retain disciplinary power in the hands of the administration. The faculty
demand for jurisdiction over rules and adjudication is thereby rebuffed.

II.
PRINCIPLES AND BUREAUCRACIES
A. Student Grievances in the Free Speech Controversy

In 1934 President Robert G. Sproul banned all political and religious activity
from the campus. In 1956 a group of students formed a committee to revise Rule l7
(the regulation barring political activity) and with substantial faculty support
managed to convince the President to change the rules. A series of clarifications
and modifications of Rule 17 followed after 1959 during the tenure of President
Clark Kerr. These established the category of "off-campus" organization for
student groups with no direct academic purpose, but allowed them privileges under
rules set up on each campus by the Chancellor.

On the Berkeley campus, these rules were often protested. But there was no

concerted effort to change them.because areas existed on campus where groups could

do as they pleased, subject only to the_regulations of the city authorities. Until
1959 Telegraph Avenue extended through the campus up to Sather Gate. Tables were -
stationed there, rallies assembled, and all types of literature sold and distributed -
With the construction of the Student Union building, however, Telegraph Avenue ended
at Bancroft Way. At this new gate to the campus, the traditional activities con-
tinued. I

The Bancroft and Telegraph sidewalk was generally regarded as being city
property. Groups received table permits from the city of Berkeley authorities.
In fact, the Dean's Office referred questions on the use of the area to the city
police department.

On September lh, 1964, Dean of Students Katherine Tbwle infonned the heads of
all student organizations that the Bancroft and Telegraph sidewalk was in fact
University property and that all University rules would henceforth be enforced
there. No tables or speeches would be allowed. Only informational literature
could be distributed; no advocacy was allowed. '

From the first, the students asked essentially two things: a return to the
status ggg at Bancroft and Telegraph, i.e. the restoration of tables with the
traditional practices; and liberalization of Rule 17 with student consultation.

The students asked changes in four areas. (1) They opposed the University ban
on fund-raising and selling literature. They pointed out that collection was
allowed for the United Crusade, and for the World University Service for schools
in Asia, while, for instance, SNCC was prevented from collecting for "freedom
schools" in Mississippi and CORE from receiving money for tutorials in Oakland.

(2) The students opposed the ban on recruiting members on campus and holding mem-
bership meetings. Especially since the University rules restricted membership in
groups to students, they asked that they be allowed to enroll new members on

campus. (3) They asked the University to rescind rules which "harassed" the flow

.9-

 

 

of ideas: the rule requiring 72-hour notification if an off-campus speaker is to
speak on campus, the rule requiring a tenured faculty member to moderate all poli-
tical and all "controversial" meetings; and the practice of billing groups for
police protection if the University decided it wanted policemen at the meeting.‘
(4) The students regarded the ban on "advocacy" as a direct infringement of their
Constitutional guarantees of free speech. They opposed any restriction on advocacy
but the details of the student position took different forms as the administration
changed its position. At first, the deans told the students that only informa-
tional literature and speech was allowed. The students tried to find out when
inferming became advocating and Dean Towle admitted that no hard and fast rules
could be drawn. But she offered the interpretation that information about a
scheduled picket was considered advocating. A.week later, on September 23, the
Chancellor announced that a new distinction would be made. Advocating a stand in .
the uncaring elections would now be allowed (the University itself was supporting
Propnelfion 2}, has n: other Lines cf advocacy would he allowed. when asked for a
clarifuragion of this new distinction, Pcesident Kerr said that the University

could not allow itself to be used as a fortress from.which social action in the

outside community could be mounted. The students regarded this position as

uhtcnable and continued to work for no restrictions on advocacy. During the

meetings of the CCPA, the Administration changed its position once.again. Now

advecacy would be permitted, but the University reser'ed the right to discipline
students if speech on campus led to iljegsl acts committed off the campus. (See
Appendix A.4.) The Administration reserved the right to decide whctuer the speech

on campus led to the illegal act off the campus. The students argued that the

courts were the only ones who could decide whether the speech itself was illegal;

if it were, the civil authorities were justified in taking action; if the speech

itself were not found to be illegal, then the University would not be justified

in disciplining a student. (See Appendix A.5.) The students feared that the
Uriversity would press charges against speakers on far less substantial grounds

than would a court of law; they believed that even with a full measure of due

 

. process written into administrative hearings the full range of case law as applied

in the courts would not be applicable. At no time did the students demand the
right of illegal speech as the administration at times charged. -They rather
demanded that the courts alone be left to judge whether speech was or was not
protected under the Constitution.

The only major demand added after the beginning of the controversy came as a
direct response to student confrontation with the disciplinary machinery of the
administration. With the suspension of the sight, the students saw that the
Chancellor made the rules, charged students with violations, submitted the cases
to a Chancellor-appointed advisory committee, and decided what judgment to render.
Therefore, the students asked that the police and judicial powers be separated--
that the faculty be given jurisdiction over disciplinary matters in disputes
arising over the rules on political activity. "

B. The Evolution of the Free Speech Movement

The Free Speech Movement grew out of the "united front" of nineteen "off- ‘
campus" organizati6ns which made a_joint protest of theHBancroft and‘Telegraph
E§bl§_héQ_Qn_§ﬁDtsmber_lz. These groups included the Young Republicans, University
Society of Individualistsg Cal Students for Goldwater, California College Republi~
cans, farticle Berkeley (student magazine), the Young Democrats, Student Civil
Liberties Union (SCLU), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Friends of the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Slate (campus political party),
ifidents for a Democratic Society (SDS), W.E.B. DuBois Club, Young Socialist
wbmggngg; ggggg Pe°P1? 5 3°°13l3t League (YPS@), Independent Socialist Club (ISC),

. tee. e a r uate student was added.

and Students for Fair Housing. Additional groups later sending delegates included
the Interfaith Council, Democratic Socialist Club, and University Society of
Libertarians.

Until October 3, the United Front operated with two representatives from each
of the nineteen organizations meeting together to make organizational policy.

On October 1, during the demonstration protesting the suspensions and arrest,
the United Front chose sIE'§tudents to attempt to negotiate a settlem§ﬁt‘6T”tﬁe'

student representatives signed the October 2 agreement_with President Kerr. Their
personal affiliations included SNCC, ISC, CORE,Women for Peace, Slate, Young
Republicans, Young Democrats, and SDS. A representative of YPSL also signed the
agreement. a .

The weekend of October 3, the United Front constituted itself as the Free
Speech‘ﬁ3V€meﬁt'(FSM).__It decided to keep an executive committee representative
of’gF5ﬁps in the United Front, though opening places for independents; graduate
students, and members of religious_groups, and to create a nine-man steering

most well—known Republican, a law student, was not present and informed the execu-
tive committee that he was not able to serve on.the steering comittee. Three
were members of campus CORE; two were from SNCC. The other four belonged to
Women for Peace, DuBois Club, YSA, and Slate. One of the CORE members, Jack
Weinberg, was a recent graduate not currently_§nrQll§d_a&_ihe_Hnixer§ity. He had

After the continued failure to come up with an agreement in the Study Com-

changed, and the need to repair the breach was evident. As a result. a ggnserv —

in FSM'counciI§._ This assumption was borne out.

 
 

The entry of the graduate students into the Executive Committee of the FSM
paralleled an increasing amount of graduate participation in rallies and in the
administrative running of the movement, expecially in writing literature and
handling informal faculty and Administration contacts. Thongb.nmmﬁLJn:gy§z§§_§§g¢

pathies among graduate students grew, the tactic of a strike became feasible and
the possibility was frequently discussed. * '

       

2. General Campus Support

From the beginning, the politically interested, who constitute a minority on
the Berkeley campus, as they do in any population, were deeply disturbed by the
Administration action restricting political expression. Berkeley has a larger
share than most campuses of politically active students, which helps explain.why
so many students -— over a thousand —- were ready to devote the better part of
their time sitting inside and outside Sproul Hall during the 32-hour demonstration,
October 1 and 2.

.12-

 

 

 

who were these students? A questionnaire (Survey B—-See Appendix D) returned "

démopstrations. Though only l5% were willing to risk arrest and expﬁIsibn,§§:
fEe'be ' ‘ , emonstration 56 them ves so willing
"if negotiations broke down and similar demonstrations were necessapy." '

   

   
    

At the height of the demonstrations, over 5,000 students gathered in the
Sproul Hall plaza; at least 3500 were sympathetic to the aims of the United Front.

when the Chancellor moved against four FSM leaders on November 28 for actions

.allegedly committed on October 1 and 2, the active support for the FSM expanded

greatly, expecially among the graduate students. The GCC and the departmental
meetings of teaching assistants called for a strike Friday, December A. Mean~
while, the FSM called for a sit—in in Sproul Hall. Over eight hundred students
were willing to act as front—line troops in the dispute. A survey of those who‘
were arrested for sitting in revealed that the students as a whole had better
than average scholastic standing.

Approzimately 15,000 students stayed out of classes from Thursday through

Monday to~protest the use of police on campus and to support the FSP cause.

It is hand to over-estimate the depth of the impact of the free speech con-
troversy on the Berkeley campus. It seems clear that over half of the entipe
stpdent body hes played a role in suppgpt 9f the ESM et Qne time Q; another, from
attendin rallies strikin and signing petitions to leafletting and other chores.

A telé hone surve of 5000 students randoml selected durin th weekend follow-
ing the arrests of the 50, showed 55% of the students pro-FSM and willing to .

strike. ”

w’ e ' ‘ 4 o rallied to the FSM banner came evidence
of deep commitment from a smaller circle of over a thousand students.‘ Arranging
meetingg, writing and‘Ei§tributing leaflets, and manning telephones absorbed the
attentions of an army of students, mostly independents; at crucial times, several
sgpe§;tie§_pitehed_in_with needed womanpower. ‘ .

After the independents‘ meeting of Octoper 6, e yept work force was organ-
ized. Student apartments were set up as "centrals." As ’ the number

of Centrals grew to include work Central, Legal Central, Exes: Central, Command

Ceptral, and Information Central. The proliferation of the FSM bureaucracy e-
came a standing joke among FSM supporters: but the system.worked surprisingLy

well to keep information flowing and needed chores prpyided,_;Lt_geulg_ppt_p§ye
continued without many, manv students contributing substantial time and effopt.

uAnother indieetion of student sppport is the vast amount of money raised
during rallies. These funds enabled the FSM to publicize its position in leaf-
lets and newsletters, to rent loud speakers, and to hire meeting halls. Several
hupdred dollars were raised at various benefit performances. Butithe bulk of the
money raised directly from among students, faculty, and University employees.
At the October 1-2 demonstration, following the suspensions of the eight and the
arrest of Jack Weinberg, over $800 was collected. Money was also sent from other
college campuses; $300 was raised, for instance, at San Francisco State College.
In all, over $2,000 was contributed by students.

,$everal factors contributed to the broad student support for the FSM. First,
the free speech issue itself aroused sympathy; the Administration was unable_to

.13 ..

 

 

 

present a coherent justification for its regulations and the FSM posiLion_mas_a

clean.libertarian one which cogd be easily grasped. Press coverage, which tended

     
 

to paint a picture of a small group of rebels challenging authority, muddied the
issues in the public mind; but it only reinforced the commitment of students who
attended rallies and saw for themselves the disparities between the press and
Administration viewpoints and the actual course of events

A major factor drawing student support was the repeated Administration res-
ponse to the student protest: disciplining ea ers. .othing united the students ,
more than t e actions of the Administration -- suspending the eight students, '
ordering arrests, and then after explicit and official faculty repudiation of

this course, preferring new charges against leaders for acts allegedly committed »
two months earlier. w

Given all these factors, however, the FSM wogld neveg have sustained and
enlarged the base of its supper were it not for the dedication of the leaders
to'keep the campus informed of FSM policv and to reach policy decisions by as
democratic a procedure as possible. ‘ V

Q_Eontinuous stream of FSM literature outlined the demands and tactics plan-
ned. It was,;furthermore, comon knowledge, that the FSM was making frequent %%
overtures to important administrators fcmﬁrdq setting up talks on the issue, gﬁﬁ
t t, , attem ts were not ettin ve far. Hardly a week assed without ev-
er3J_inIQ3Qﬁg_g§§§;gg§_§ng_§§l§phgp§;conversations wit important members of the
Administration - in each case initiated”by members of the ESM. At one point,
several "moderate" FSM members actually met with President Kerr and thought they
had reached a compromise agreement, only to learn the following day that the Pres-
ident had changed his mind. ~

During several major rallies, the FSM's comitment to democratic procedure
was evident. On these occasions, extensive discussion about options open to the
FSM took place right at the rally and a voice vote decided the issue. For ins-
tance, on November 20, several thousand students, assembled across the street from
the Regents meeting, learned of the Regents‘ decision: the rules would be some-
what liberalized, but the Administration would still judge whether speech were
"legal" and there would be further disciplinary action against the FSM. A seg-
ment of the leadership favored an immediate sit-in. The majority of the students
agreed with the position of Mario Savio, that such a move was inappropriate at
that time; and the meeting adjgurned for the weekend.

. gigce the press has often minimized the student support for the FSM cause,

it should be pointed out here that for a long while, faculty and administration
also failed to see how_§§tensive and intensive the student feelings were. _g
major turning point for the faculty came when hundreds of their brightest students
were arrested on December 3-4, and when a majority Q: their teaching assistants A
(§5% in the_Humanities and Social Sciences) went on_strike over the issue. _At
this writing, however, some members of the Administration continue to believe
thatlthe free speech contrgggrsy involves only a handful of "disruptive elements,"

_ang trust that the dispute will end if these people are eliminated from the schogl.

e United Front was a catch-all or ' -

e ear y participants thought that the fight for free speech
could be sustained for long by such a diverse set of allies. The first disagree-
ments over tactics came as soon as the conservative groups announce a _J_ey'

-lh-.

 

 

i could not, on principle, break University regulations ‘ ‘oh the disa reed.

 

The*major1ty or the United Front argued that all attempts would be made to seeﬁre
a quick change in the rules barring fund-raising, advocacy, and recruitment of
members, but that if the changes were not prompt, the rules would have to be
broken. They reasoned that the restrictions themselves threatened the very
existence of the groups; they hindered access to fellow students.

~wm1sr- M

The conservative grougs agreed tg ge—e1gng with the demegds of the United’
Front. while making public their adherence to the regulations as they stood. At
the same time, they would fight to change the rules by picketing and speaking out

against them. ‘

During the week of Seutember 28. several changes occurred which affected
the ﬁositibn of the conservatives. First, Chancellor Strong threw out the earlier
distinction between advocating and :’mformi_ng_. On Monday, he announced that a
stand in the upcoming.n§ti6naI and state.elections would be allowed, but that any _
other kind of advocacy would be prohibited. This'§artI§IIv.§atisTieH'fﬁe"Immed—

C0uld_9Ql1;EE.§§LLi§d_LhIQngh_negQtiatione with those who made the deciSions;,
and there was general despair over administrative unwillingness to talk over the
issues or even admit that issues existed. Two divergent attitudes existed among
the leaders. Some completely distrusted the Administratién. These "militaﬁﬁs"
saw each administrative move as a further attempt to avoid the issue, undercut
those ighting for better-rules, and reinforce the right of administrative fiat

in these areas.

- ' al and sophisticated observers, one of the most puzzling and inter-
esting asgects of the meetings was the way organizations spli among themeelves
on these attitudinal linee. While the press and President Kerr were making alle-
gations or“Commnn1st influence in the organization, the various socialist students
were as divided among themselves as the rest of the Executive Committee. For
instance, members of the DuBois Club -~ not to mention the non—Socialists such as
SDS and SNCC —- were in both the militant and moderate camps. Members of the

~.Xbung«PBOpl3'S Socialist League (YPSL) were the only consistent moderates.

espggially during the talks in the CC A, the differences oamn_hack.tolthewsnI£§§§.

 

The disagreement with the Administration over the interpretationrof*the Kerr
agreement of October 2 was uniformly regarded within_FSM as evidence of bad faith.
Even after President Kerr finally agreed to reconstitute the CCPA, the distrust

contention. During the course of the CCPA meetings, the Administration declared
its position on advocacy final; it demanded the right to discipline students whose
speech was judged to be illegal by the Administration,

The FSM, by this time, believed the Administration was arbitrary in its
interpretation and enforcement of rules; it also saw evidence that the University
acted sometimes as a transmission belt for anti—civil rights pressures from the
outside community. For these reasons the FSM opposed.the.pQwer_Qfwth£~Administra—.
tion to interpret the content of speech, and consistently demanded that the Courts
be the sole arbiters of the legality of speech. ‘

Once the Administration had declared its position to be final, most of the
members of the FSM Executive Committee felt the viability of the CCPA was com-
promised. After much debate, the Executive Committee decided to continue to work
in the CCAP to re-open the advocacy issue. Meanwhile, tables, under "ideal"
rules would be manned once again--this time mostly by graduate students. Most
of the Executive Committee did not count on the Chancellor’s reaction: he dissolved
the CCPA. Apparently he also directed the Dean's Office to discipline violators
of University rules but to disregard violations by graduate students and teaching
assistants. A ’ . ‘

A The most serious split in the FSM occurred after the Regents endorsed some
liberalization of the rules, allowing fund-raising and recruiting members, but
calling for University discipline if the Administration concluded that a speech
was "unlawful." The FSM agreed that the new rules were unacceptable but divided
over what to do about it. This division had slightly different dimensions; On
one side there were those (usually among the moderates, but here joined by '
several socialists and radicals) who felt that the suggested Monday sit—in could
have no political benefit; and that it constituted a gesture of anger and
futility which could only be used against the movement. The militants argued on
moral rather than political grounds: the Regents had given their final answer—-
an answer which left the Constitutional rights of students in question; therefore,
the students saw no alternative but to publicly and dramatically express their
opposition and despair. The militants won a close victory in both the Executive
Committee and the Steering Committee. Both sides were represented to the thousand
students attending the Monday meeting. Only three hundred of them chose to sit—in,
however, and of these, many acted in order that the~split.might_not_he~maximized
inhthe eyes of the public. ;In these circumstances, the Steering Committee decided
to clear the building at 5:00 P.M. and to call off further sit-in plans. The
split indicated that Administration concessions might destroy the FSM if the
leadership did not work to reach a consensus before planning action. As the lesson
of the abortive sit—in was sinking in, however, the Administration, over_the
Thanksgiving weekend, took new action against the leadership. The split healed
over night. »

The Executive Committee united in a call for an immediate amnesty and opening
of discussions on the advocacy issue. They contacted the.Administration about
these points and learned that some members of the Administration had opposed the

timing of the new disciplinary action but said they could not have the action
rescinded. It seemed the pattern preceding the October 1-2 demonstration was
being repeated. The students again were told that there was no free speech‘
issue and that, in any case, there was no way to discuss their demands; they
were again faced with disciplinary action against a few of their leaders.,
Pressure to take strong,unequivocal action came this time not only from the
militants, but from the moderates, both undergraduate-and graduate.»

A final ultimatum was issued by the FSM to P¥%§E33ht Kerr to sit down and
talk or to face renewed direct action and a student strike. The Administration
once again reacted by stating it would not be moved by a small number of
dissatisfied and unreasonable "rebels." On Wednesday,_December 3, Mario Savio
expressed the despair of the students by calling on FSM supporters to begin a.
peaceful and disciplined sit-in in Sproul Hall. A

campus support than ever before.

During the ensuing weekend, the Steering Committee made it clear in the
flurry of behind—the-scenes talks, among Administration, faculty and student

Fcontingents, that the FSM had a very specific set of goals: essentially,

amnesty for all students, faculty-student say in rules and adjudication, and

- court jurisdiction over content of speech. Moderate and militant alike stressed

to faculty chairmen and to available administrators, that from the beginning.
the issue was free speech and that with amnesty and a solution of the advocacy
problem, the controversy would end. In fact, Mario Savio made it clear to the

«vExecutive Committee after the Faculty Chairmen had met with President Kerr

that if the Regents accepted the resolutions of the Academic Freedom Committee
(which_were later endorsed 7-1 by the Academic Senate) the Free Speech Movement
would become primarily a "defendants" committee" which would lobby for amnesty
for the eight hundred arrested in Sproul Hall. But without a resolution of
the issues, the students expressed readiness to continue the fight by whatever
means were left open to them. ' ’ ‘

‘ Just before the winter vacation, the Regents rebuffed faculty attempts to
get jurisdiction over discipline and ruleemaking. The entire nature of deci-
sionemaking was thereby called into question and opened FSM strategists to
the difficult problem of keeping a movement going while broadening the demand
to an entire overhaul of University policy-making structure.

D. The Limitations of Liberalszt Faculty Actions and Attitudes_

.Frdm the onset of the dispute the studentsfrecognized the need to *”“"“““'
persuade other parts of the academic community that their demands were just.
They knew that no matter what other tactics mightohayewto be employed, the $7
dispute could only ultimately be resolved around a table, where different
points of view could be aired and a meeting of the minds reached.

"'1!-

From the first, the students faced an administration reluctant to discuss
the issues, so the protesters attempted to extend their support among the
students and faculty by holding a series of rallies, passing out leaflets, and
circulating petitions. The petitions were hastily drawn and numerous; yet they
amassed hundreds-of signatures. Most professors, however, expressed a wish to

wait and see, and advised students to seek redress through normal administrative
channels. "A ‘ ‘

_-l7—«

 

 

 
   

 

ﬂDean Towle made a new pronouncement but indicated that changes in the rules

In practice, however, there were no channels. On the first day of classes

were out.of her hands., The following week Chancellor Strong modified his
interpretation of the advocacy ban in a public meeting, but continued to refuse
to meet with students. A meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, September 30,

by Dean Towle with the united front to "clarify" the rules. This meeting was
cancelled by the deans_office because of "unfavorable conditions": three hundred
students were waiting in the hallway demanding the same treatment as five
students cited that day for sitting at tables.

The first direct faculty involvement came the follewing day, October l,’" ” '
after the arrest of Jack'Weinberg had touched ogf a major rally around the
police car. Given the crisis, about fifteen professors, largely from the
sociology department began ad hoc meetings to attempt to reach the administra-
tion and mediate. They expressed their neutrality in the issue, and their
criticism of both sides in the dispute, and announced their major aim was to

,,work out an agreement in which the students would call off the demonstration

and means for settlinglthe dispute would be set up.

The adminstration told the faculty the same th1ﬁg7It*toIn%the studentsr”"‘*M
that is, two things were non-negotiable: one was the disciplinary action taken
against the eight students, the other was University regulations.

The faculty mediators got nowhere on the first day. Pressure for talks
mounted on the second. The campus clergymen, supported by student religious
leaders——both groups privately sympathetic to the students’ cause—-stepped in
to mediate (they too were unsuccessful but their presence helped); meanwhile,
behind the scenes, the Democratic payty applied pressure for talks. As a
result, President Kerr agreed to a four—point faculty proposal, drafted by
several professors from the social sciences, and, after having called over

_five hundred policemen onto the campus, notified the united front that he was

ready to offer the students a package agreement.

During the debates with President Kerr, the students made it clear that
they wanted the faculty to have a larger role in the dispute. They wished all
administrative charges to be dropped; but they were willing, in the end, to
have a committee chosen by the Academic Senate take up the cases of the eight.
Similarly they were willing to enter into a tripartite Study Comittee, on
the understanding that the faculty would choose their contingent, the students_
theirs and the administration theirs. with the end of the weekend, however, the
students learned that the Study Comittee had already been selected by the
Chancellor without any consultation, and that he was submitting the cases of
the eight tola comittee of his own appointees. Meanwhile, a number of
mathematics and statistics professors deplored the administration's tactic
of calling in the police. ' is

The-dispute over the fulfilbment of the agreement raged for nearly two
weeks. The faculty members chosen to serve on the Study Comittee (the CCPA)
defended the legitimacy of the body but the group decided'to'h5ld it§”first”“”””" *
hearings on the question of how it could be better constituted. At this meeting
the first formal confrontation of students and faculty took place: all fifty
students were critical of the administration and all but two called for the
immediate suspension of_the comittee as constituted.

Meanwhile, the Academic Senate met and tabled several motions supporting
student free speech. It passed a resolution urging "cooperation of all parties".
A professor of industrial relations, who later turned out to be a close friend
of President Kerr, came away frdm the meeting dissatisfied, and offered his
services to mediate the differences between the President and the students.

-185

 

 

 

An agreement resulted giving the Free Speech Movement four seats on an expanded
Study Comittee, and remanding the cases of the eight to a panel to be chosen

a by the Academic Senate. -

After lengthy hearings, this disciplinary panel sharply criticized the
administration and recommended suspending two of the students for six weeks
(a period elapsed by_that time) and expunging the records and reinstating the
remaining six students. Weeks later, the Regents reinstated all eight as of
November 20 and refused to expunge any records. ’Many professors then
publically decried the Regents’ failure to heed the recommendations of the
faculty panel. The chairman of the group however later declared his satisfac-
tion with the Regents' action, and requested the matter be closed. “

, The reconstituted CCPA met for several weeks. Many issues seemed resolved.
‘But the administration so stood firm on demanding the right to discipline
students for speech which it considered illegal. It also insisted that the
Sproul Hall steps no longer be used as a Hyde Park area. Faced with administra-.
tion intransigence on these issues, the faculty contingent.told.the students
to go along. In other words, on those issues where there was an important
difference between the student and administration position, the faculty saw
itself as the reasonable mediator, convincing the students that it was_fruitless
and irrational to oppose the administration. ~

The CCPA declared the issue of advocacy deadlocked and the students went
back to setting up tables. The study committee was then dissolved by the
Chancellor. But the "rump" faculty contingent continued to meet and made
public a ten-point package which included essentially the points made
during the meetings: the legality of student speech would be decided by the
school (the faculty asked that it have an advisory role in determining this),
’but fund—raising and recruiting members would be allowed.

This position was set forth in some detail at a special meeting called
by the Dean of the Graduate Division for teaching assistants after several
graduate meetings had brought up the possibility ofva TA strike if the University
refused to change its restrictions. Several hundred teaching assistants
attended and made their nearly unanimous opposition clear.

There was considerable confusion after-the November 20 Regents meeting.,
Many professors felt that the faculty position had been completely ignored in
the deliberations. Actually, many of the faculty proposals had been put into
effect, and others tabled to a future meeting. However, the parts put into
effect were only those that the administration was already willing to grant
when it came into the Study Committee meetings. The faculty demand that it
be given jurisdiction over the advocacy cases, for instance, was ignored.

In the wake of the Regents meeting some of the younger history professors
sought faculty support for a proposal that the AcademierSenate-should not
only hear cases concerning the content of speech but that they should have
final jurisdiction, not simply advise the Chancellor. Meanwhile several
science professors issued a statement endorsing the use of direct action not
only in Mississippi but in the north. _I ‘

General faculty mobilization, however, began only after the Chancellor
re—opened disciplinary action against four FSM leaders. There was widespread
concern over this action among the faculty, though nothing was done to head off
the imminent crisis. a .

The arrests Thursday morning and afternoon of the eight hundred wrenched
the faculty out of the seat of routine and brought a large portion of them in

-19..

 

 

 

"direct involvement. Over $8000 in bail money was raised among them during the

 

first day. Several hundred professors were involved all day and night arranging

bail, negotiating for the release of the prisoners and, ultimately, transporting
the students from the Santa Rita prison facility, 37 miles from Berkeley.

Nine hundred professors, double the number usually at Academic Senate
meetings, met on their own initiative the day of the arrests and overwhelmingly
endorsed a series of proposals including one to make the courts the sole arbiter
of the content of speech. A ‘

Meanwhile, the departmental chairmen constituted themselves as’a Council
and played a slightly different role. ‘With Chancellor Strong ill and in the
hospital and with the Academic Senate out of session, the chairmen agreed to -\
run the-school and-try to breach the cleavage in the University community.

They worked out a series hf points which they modified during weekend meetings

with President Kerr and ultimately came up with a package ensuring no campus

discipline for acts comitted before December 7 (the Monday the agreement was

unveiled) and calling for discussion of the rules by the Academic Freedom
Committee of the Academic Senate. Pending liberalization of the rules,
furthermore, existing rules would be put imediately into effect. The last
part was to answer the charge that the new Regents rules had not been implemented.
But the agreement could not bring further implementation for the rules stipulated
that the Chancellor would designate areas, and the Chancellor gave no indica-
tion then or later of planning to designate any area save the Bancroft and
Telegraph sidewalk area.

.— --C

The liberal faculty members, spurred on mostly by non-tenured members,‘
but including among their ranks many of the top men in the social sciences
and huanities, went ahead and drafted a series of resolutions which were
then adopted by the Academic Freedom Committee and, after a long debate, by
the Academic Senate by 824-115.

In the following days, the professors were very busy printing up thousands
of leaflets and pamphlets explaining their position to the community and
especially to fellow professors on other campuses. They managed to win
endorsement from professors at U.C. at San Diego and_Santa Barbara and from
professors at other schools throughout the state and country. They failed to
get the support of the UCLA faculty largely because of long—standing rivalries
between the two campuses. f ‘

Many professors, stunned by the involvement of so many of their best :
students in the arrests, invested a great deal of energy and time in fighting
for their resolutions.. They suddenly remembered old disputes and unresolved
issues, still outstanding, and credited the students with clarifying both the
free speech issue by their uncompromising position, and the nature of University
decision-making., ‘ -

.Out.of the dispute came a union, affiliated with the American Federation
of Teachers, of teaching assistants, a new graduate student government, a new
independent undergraduate association, and, finally, plans for reorganizing the
Academic Senate to strengthen its hand in dealings with the administration. .

In letters, speeches and informal discussions, one theme arose continually
among professors: why did it take us so long? The answer lies in the con»
servative consequences of the liberal myths with which nearly all of the
"liberal" professors clothe themselves. They have faith'in the community, in
the wisdom and good will of the administrators whom the Regents (wealthy
businessmen chosen by the Legislature) have entrusted with running the school,
with the accessibility of the administration to grievances and divergent"

 

  

zinterests within the academic comunity; they stress the complexity and difficulty
of running a large university and the many pressures from outside which must be
neutralized if the University is to survive and thrive. They tend to see conflicts
as administrative not political problems, automatically resolved in the best prac~
ticable way through set procedures. They deny, on principle, that interests within
the academic community significantly diverge: disputes are within the family and .
are better not pursued than risk offending or disturbing the routine. They presume
;current procedures are adequate, that disputes only arise through misunderstanding
2and:failure to communicate. They argue that, in the last analysis, the administra-
tion must be obeyed for it has had power delegated ultimately by the legislature.
The power of the administration is legitimate and therefore must be just. To call
it unjust, or-to call for a redistribution of decision-making authority where un-
checked injustice is manifest, is to challenge the legitimacy of the system: it is
anarchy. . 4

‘ Now, most of the faculty modified this position with examples of exceptions and
problems and grievances of their own. But they saw these as necessary evils, ex-

~ceptions to a basically sound system; furthermore they identified with the system

;even by seeing the administration as their "servants? (while conceding this did not
Ausually work out in practice). Thus criticism of the system was criticism of their
system. They saw the problem as one of letting the system work out the problems by
its own machinery, to intervene risked destroying it.. ' 1 " h

Only when the system was threatened overtly and unquestionably-— that is in
times of crisis, when the mechanism of student protest and administration repression
.had led to a clear breakdown-— did the faculty feel compelled to enter. Only during
prises, in fact, were a significant number of professors ready to see that simple
administrative matters were.not the story~— rather that some profound moral and
:political issues were at'stake and that the faculty had'to take sides, even if only
to end the disruption of the routine._ Even the "equi—liberals" who agreed with
President Kerr that modern industrial society is only a matter of administrative

obalancing off of competing interests, then were forced to take practical steps to‘

forestall further fracturing of the community. But the limitation of their vision
continues to keep them from seeing the moral and political foundations of the

Student demands, and they continue to oppose the students’ militancy as subversive
to the University. ‘

The main consequence of faculty attitudes and actions until the arrests was to
muddy the issues and to strengthen the hand of the administration, by legitimating
extraneous issues, expressing their own confusion about the issues, and supporting
the administration position because of "power realities" on specific points where
the Chancellor refused to budge. Only a handful of professors gave public support
to the FSM from the early days. i

The bulk of the faculty remain more committed to the smooth running of the
University than to effective measures to change the educational experience and
guarantee all members of the academic community their Constitutional rights on

Since the arrests, however, a large contingent, mostly younger professors, are
deeply comitted to the FSM position.

Others have moved back into the background and can be called on to come out if
there is more trouble: these will likely resign, for they moved from liberal faith
to disillusionment and despair.

-21- T

 

 

 

The FSM has stressed often its hope that no professors will actually resign
over the issue, but will stay and continue the fight in Berkeley. S

The reaction of the moderate Academic Senate Executive Committee to the Regents
decisions of December 18 was typical of the behavior of most faculty liberals. The
group endorsed the Regents moves, though the latter repudiated the faculty mandate
to hold jurisdiction over rule-making and adjudication. However, many other pro-
fessors expressed their opposition to this yeseman attitude and brought pressure on

gthe Committee. As a result of this pressure and of student insistence on the right

to use the steps of Sproul Hall for meetings the Committee is expected at this ‘
writing to endorse the use of this area, at least for the time being, as a tradi-
tional Hyde Park area and one which meets the free speech requirement for effective
communication. U - .'- ‘ ’- ‘

This is expected to put the faculty in conflict with Chancellor Strong, who
returned from the hospital more eager than ever to salvage his authority and who
has garnered four members of the Regents in a campaign to oust President Kerr.

It is well understood on campus among both students and faculty that renewed
disciplinary action will create a new "explosion". Whether the faculty this time‘
can forestall a new crisis remains to be seen.

III   p
A FREE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA: .CURRENT PERSPECTIVES FOR CHANGE

The fall 1964 semester of the University of California is generally regarded
as the most exciting and dangerous era in its history. Like the loyalty oath con-

A troversy of the early fifties the danger came when outside pressures were trans-

mitted by the administration into University policy. But the resistance to the ini-
qnities of the policies and the structures generating them has made a difference and
has~opened great perspectives for university reform in the California university
system and elsewhere. '

By any standard, save that of those who say that education does not exist out~
side a classroom setting, the semester was the most educational in the history of
the school. An ever increasing nuber in the University community were involved in
a sophisticated level of dialogue created by a group of students whose main tactic
was to continue to clarify the difference between conditions for educational ex-
cellence and the reality, and the unfolding of events in which the roles played by
various.participants became increasingly clear and the relationship between struc-
tures and patterns of interest and authority emerged for all to see. By the time of
the arrests over 65% of the student body was actively supporting the Free Speech
Movement as a result of this educational process. j

During the course of the dispute, the FSM was able to demonstrate clearly the
inadequacy of the reality and alternatives to it. Over the Christmas vacation, the ‘
cases of eight hundred young people arrested for protesting by a sit—in University ’
policies ominously hung in the air, many liberal professors continued showing signs
of reluctance to confront the issues and to fight the administration, and evidence
was clear of administration and community intimidation—— investigations, renewed
discipline and a threat to close down the school and bring the National Guard.

Thus the students decided to hold a series of informational rallies in January
1965 until finals and the Regents meeting of January 18 to present the University

comnnity with a general critique of the ongoing relationship of the University and
particular parts of the outside community, and their specific demands for structural
and policy changes needed to return the University to its proper role as informed
and autonomous critic of the society in which it is placed and as a place for
distinguished education for citizens and leaders of a new era in America.

 

The Free Speech Movement, with the vital and continuing support of the Students

for a Democratic Society and like-minded citizens, has expressed its intention to
live its ideal of uncompromising dedication to principles of democratic participa~
tion and free expression both on and off the campus. i

Though many rules on the campus had been relaxed since 1957, more restrictions
than exist at comparable universities were retained. Moreover, most of the changes
in rules since 1957 were minor, and application of rules became actually more
limiting in practice as the Berkeley Chancellor made restrictive interpretations
of the rules and as sidewalk areas where University rules did not apply were
gradually eliminated. = —

The present dispute was triggered when the remaining on-campus sidewalk area was
placed under'University restrictions; the rules themselves were then called into
question.

Almost from the beginning a series of problems presented themselves to the
students, problems basic to the issue of responsible and democratic institutions.
The University administration reserved to itself the right to impose and change
rules at will, and had no real channels through which demands for changes could flow.
Similarly, the administration retained the exclusive right to discipline students
under its own rules.

AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY
JUNE 1961.

College administrators must face up to their public function. Gone are the good
old days, when school spirit meant hazing the freshmen; eating the goldfish—-and ;"R ;
raiding the sororities. May I propose that all college administrators help tell our
people what college study really'means-«what we must demand of our students--if we
hope to make them active Americans.

Make our people safe for students with ideas and you will be performing a real
service for America. You.will be halting the epidemic of social hysteria that is w .
spreading across our nation under the libelous labels of secret societies.

Far from discouraging your students‘ social and public interests, I propose that
you positively exploit them. ‘Here is an honorable source of college spirit; here is a
a worthy unifying and organizing principle for your whole campus life. ‘I say: thank
God for the spectacle of students-picketing--even when they are picketing me at
Sacramento and I think they are wrong--for students protesting and freedom-riding,
for students listening to society's dissidents, for students going out into fields
with our migratory Workers, and marching off to join with our segregated Negroes.

At last we're getting somewhere. The colleges have become bootcamps for
citizenship-—and citizen leaders are marching out of them. ~

For awhile, it will be hard on us as administrators. Some students are going to
be wrong and some people will want to deny them the right to make mistakes. ,
Administrators will have to wade through the angry letters and colleges will lose
some donations. we governors will have to face indignant caravans and elected of-
ficians bent on dictating to state college faculties.

But let us stand up for our students and be proud of them. If America is still‘
on the way up, it will welcome this new, impatient, critical group of young gadflies.
It will be fearful only of the complacent and passive.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS, SEPTEMBER 14,- DECEMBER 18.

As political activity increased during the depression, President Robert

Gordon Sproul in 1934 imposed a ban on all political and religious meetings

on campus. With the effects of the McCarthy periods and the catastrophic
loyalty oath controversy lifting, this ban was modified in 1957 after the students
lobbied behind the scenes. The students at that time received support from
Chancellor Kerr and from the Academic Senate in their efforts to convince Pres-
ident Sproul to allow political meetings on campus. In 1959, when the Sather
Gate section of Telegraph Avenue -— long a center of off-campus free speech --
became a campus plaza and walkway, political activities were restricted to the
campus entrance at Bancroft and Telegraph. This entrance strip was considered
city property and as late as the Spring of 196A, the Dean's Office directed or-
ganizations to get permits from the Berkeley police department to set up tables.
In the years following 1959, the Kerr Directives were promulgated and revised.
They provided for the ppen forum policy, but established criteria which made it
easier in most cases for groups to pay fees for rooms outside of the campus.than
to use campus rooms. Tables on campus for soliciting funds and recruiting mem-
bers were prohibited, but this restriction did not hit home so long as the Ban-
croft and Telegraph "safety valve" remained accessible. Complaints about the
inadequacy of Hyde Park areas ---where students could say anything without prior
notification -- were ignored for three years, and again Bancroft and Telegraph"
became a gs facto Hyde Park area, satisfying this need. ‘

During the Spring l9§g semester, University of California students were among

President Kerr answered critics by stressing_that what students did_Qff campus
was their own business. During the sumérj however, representatives of the ’
0a and ribune comp ained that the campus was being used to recruit Scranton
demonstrators at the Republican national convention. The owner of the Tribune
is William.Knowland, a former Senator who was Goldwater's California campaign
manager. During early September the Tribune similarly complained that the campus

was being used to recruit students to picket the newspaper as part of a campaign
against alleged discriminatory hiring practices.

P

organizations to notify them that Bancroft and Telegraph sidewalk is University
property and University rules applythere; henceforth, no tables, fund-raising,
membership recruitment, or speeches will be permitted there.

September 17: Upon receipt of letter, heads of off-campus organizations join
as "united front" to protest the new ruling and submit request to Deanys Office
that Bancroft and Telegraph free speech area be restored, and that various re-
strictions on free expression be "reformed".

 

 

    

\\\\\<\ September 21: First day of classes. Dean Tcwle meets with united front --.i.e.,
the leaders of nineteen student groups, including Young Democrats, Students for
,Goldwater, Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), Friends of Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee (SNCC), Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA), and others -- to clarify rules and announces two modifi-
‘cations in interpretations: Vi) a new Hyde Park area is granted on the steps of
Sproul Hall to replace the three-year-old, but never used, area behind the snackbar
and the gg facto Bancroft and Telegraph area; ii) tables with University permission
will be allowed at Bancroft and Telegraph but only under rules prohibiting fund-
fraising, recruitment, and advocacy of partisan positions. The students refuse to
.accept these pronouncements. when Dean Towle finishes clarifying the rules, dwel-
’ling at length upon the difference between advocating and informing an audience of a
position, the students reject the administration pronouncement as infringing on
:their Constitutional rights. They request a change in the rules. ‘Dean Towle says
Ashe cannot change the rules. The students, with permits from the University,

,set up tables; however, traditional_practices -~ including fund-raising, membership
recruitment, and advocacy, mostly relatedito the upcoming elections -- continue
~\ during this first week of school.

\\\<\ September 28: Since the rules are supposed to be campus-wide, the united front
decides to set up tables at Sather Gate, another traditional table area, and exer-
cises traditional prerogatives of selling literature and advocating positions.

They also decide to demonstrate their point of view by picketing a University meet-
ing at which Chancellor Strong is presenting athletic awards. One thousand pickets
support the call for rules change.. At the meeting, Chancellor Strong makes a sur-
prise change in the rules. Henceforth, advocating a position for or against a
‘candidate or a ballot proposition will be allowed, but no further changes are en-
visaged. The matter is closed. Meanwhile, four organizations - SNCC, SDS, DuBois
‘Club and Slate -- are warned that action will be taken if they continue to break
University regulations. Three organizations are told to make appointments with the

\\\\\*QDean.
September 22: Further warnings are made to groups setting up tables at Sather
Gate. Meanwhile, an appointment is set up with the united front for Wednesday,
September 30, at 4:00 p.m., to further "clarify" the rules.

September 30: Five individuals are cited for violating University rules at
tables and are asked to appear at 3:00 p.m. for a meeting with the deans. Many
other students sitting at tables request to be seen at the same time. Over six-
hundred sign a statement declaring they are equally responsible for manning the
tables. Over three-hundred of these students appear in Sproul Hall for the 3:00 p.m.
appointment but are refused access to the deans. Instead, the five are requested to
appear alone. At 4:00 p.m., three names of leaders are added, and Dean Williams
asks all eight to see him. The three-hundred students again request similar treat-
ment and are rebuffed. Dean Williams then cancels the meeting scheduled with the
leaders of the groups. The students wait outside the Dean's Office until early
morning when ‘Chancellor Strong announces that the eight students have been sus-
pended indefinitely.

\\\\\‘§ October 1: The indefinite suspensions -- a sanction which does not appear in
the University regulations -- cause widespread student resentment. About ten tables
are set up - this time in front of the Administration building -— and a rally is
planned for noon. The united front new demands not only a change in the rules, but
equal treatment for all students under the rules and, specifically, the lifting of
the suspensions. At about ll:A5 a.m., Dean Van Houten and a campus policeman
approach one of the tables (CORE) at which about a dozen persons are sitting. Jack
Weinberg, a recent Cal graduate, is told he is violating University rules and is

 

 

  

 

placed under arrest when he refuses to leave the table. Students spontaneously sit
down around the police car which has arrived on the plaza and block the car from
removing Mr. Weinberg. Mario Savio, head of the Friends of SNCC, removes his
shoes and begins to address a crown of over a thousand; from atop the police car.
He discusses the position of the united front and the injustice of the Administra~
tion's response to their free speech demands. Many others also make speeches. The
protest is extended by sitting—in in Sproul Hall. Meanwhile, a group of faculty
members tries to mediate during the afternoon and evening. The administration
tells them, and tells the students as well, that the issues of the rules and the
disciplinary measures are not negotiable. The protest demonstration grows and
grows. During the late evening, a knot of one-hundred, mostly fraternity men,
assemble and hurl lighted cigarettes and eggs on the hundreds sitting in the plaza;
but after many tense hours, violence is averted when the hecklers leave in response
to the silence of the demonstrators and an appeal from the Catholic chaplain

October 2: Clergymen and student religious leaders who support the goals of the
protestors try to mediate behind the scenes.‘ Meetings with the deans are fruitless.
Meanwhile, a similar group of faculty members works out a compromise and, together
with some legislators, convinces President Kerr to meet with the students during
the late afternoon. President Kerr summons five-hundred policemen to disperse the
crowd of over one-thousand if an agreement is not signed. A long, tense meeting
results in a sixepoint agreement! l) restoring the privileges of student groups
suspended during the week; 2) ending the demonstration; 3) submitting the student
suspensions to a committee of the Academic Senate; A) submittirg rules to a tri-
partite study committee; 5) dropping charges against Mr. Weinberg; and 6) working
to deed Bancroft and Telegraph sidewalk to the City of Berkeley.

October 3-4: The united front constitutes itself as the Free Speech Movement
with an executive Committee representing each of the nineteen "off—campus" groups,
independent students, and religious organizations. A nineeman steering committee
is elected to plan interim.policy and to choose negotiators to serve on the student-
faculty-administration Study Committee. Mr. Savio will speak at the rally planned

for Monday to explain the new developments and FSM strategy to the other interested
students.

October 5: A few minutes before the rally, the Adminitration reverses an earlier
order to arrest Mr. Savio if he tries to address his fellow students. Meanwhile,
the Chancellor chooses ten of the twelve men to serve on the "Campus Comittee on
Political Activity" (CCPA) without waiting for recommendations from the students
or faculty. He also announces that the Chancellor-appointed Faculty Comittee on
Student Conduct—-not an Academic Senate committee—~will hear the cases of the eight
students he has suspended and will recommend to him action to be taken. The FSM
denounces these moves as niolations of the October 2 agreement. Nevertheless, a
moratorium on further demonstrations and tables is declared pending further nego-
tiations on these matters.

October 1: Ignoring the call for revisions in the structure of the CCPA, the
Administration allows it to meet. The CCPA calls for an open meeting Tuesday,
October 13, to discuss its structure.

October 8: Six hundred unaffiliated students (called "independents"), meeting
in a local church, choose five members to serve on the FSM executive committee.

October 10-12: The executive committee expands the steering committee to twelve

adding a representative from the Republican and Democratic Clubs and the religious
organizations.

 

 

October 1;: Academic Senate endorses need for rule liberalization. Three
hundred students in Harmon Gymnasium.meeting of CCPA hear testimony from fifty
students, all but one requesting dissolution of CCPA as presently constituted
pending talks on fair reconstitution of the body. Meanwhile graduate students from
Graduate Co-ordinating Council with delegates from each department choose 7
representatives to FSM Executive Committee.

October 15: FSM denounces refusal of administration to negotiate outstanding
differences in interpretation of October 2 Kerr—united front agreement, and reveals
plans to end moratorium on direct action if administration continues to "refuse to _
sit down and discuss issues." Professor of Industrial Relations, Arthur Ross,
volunteers to mediate.

October 15: President Kerr agrees 1) to remand the cases of the eight suspended
students to an Academic Senate committee and 2) to reconstitute the CCPA with
eighteen members - four from the FSM -- to discuss rule changes.

October 20: Expanded CCPA agrees that all decisions will be by consensus of
students, faculty and administration, each voting as a unit with one vote.

October 28: While the CCPA has been meeting to examine various proposals for
new rules, the panel of five professors, appointed by the Academic Senate and headed
by Professor of Law, Ira Heyman, begins hearing the cases of the eight suspended
students. 7

October 22: Dean Williams testifies that the suspended students were singled
out_frem among many students observed violating the rules to discourage students
from protesting the regulations.

November 3: Though the table moratorium and the dispute itself have hampered
canvassing for the elections, the FSM sticks exclusively with committees as the
way out of the dispute.

November 2: The Administration contingent on the CCPA declares itself unalterably

opposed to the students" position on political advocaqy. The University demands

the right to discipline students and organizations advocating activities that ”?*~~
“directly result" in "unlawful acts" off the campus. The students demand that the
definition of legal speech be left solely to the courts, citing the stand of the
American Civil Liberties Union and that of the American Association of University
Professors: "In the area of the first amendment rights and civil liberties, the
University may impose no disciplinary action against members of the university
community and organizations. In this area, members of the university community

are subject only to the civil authorities." '

November 2: The FSM decides to "exercise our constitutional rights" and
resumes manning tables. Still, it plans strategy aimed at reopening the advocacy
issue at the Wednesday CCPA meeting. But Chancellor Strong disbands the CCPA on the
grounds that the students had broken the October 2 agreements. ‘

November 10: Dean's office sends letters to 70 students citing them for viola-
tions of previous day. Hundreds of graduate students man tables or sign petitions .
of support assuming equal culpability for themselves.

November 11: Three hundred meet to organize a teaching assistants’ union and
voice support for FSM demands. Administration ignores graduate student violations
at this time.

 

 

 

November 12: President Kerr calls the proposals of the faculty contingent "a
basis for constructive solutions to the current and difficult problems." The pro-
posals would allow solicitation of funds and members, and would allow a faculty
committee to recommend action to be taken against illegal advocacy. Tables continue;

; the Administration ignores them. The Heyman Committee criticizes the Administra-

tion's handling of the eight-students. It recommends that six be immediately
re-instated and char ‘s expunged from their records, and that the remaining two

-receive a sixeweek sy ension. This meant immediate reinstatement, for they had

by then been out of school for longer than this period. Chancellor Strong states
he will not act on the cases untl after the December 8 meeting of the Academic

.Senate.

November 16: The FSM collects hundreds of signatures on a petition urging the
regents to leave the question of advocacy to the courts. Tables continue up. The

»Dean's Office announces appointments will be made for the following week for the
’seventy students cited for manning tables. The Dean's Office announces that

graduate students who submitted their names as equally responsible will receive
letters.

November 20: More than three-thousand students rally at Sproul Hall Hyde Park
area for two hours, then snake their way down to the west gate of campus to hear
Joan Baez and await the results of the Regents meeting across the street in University
Hall.l Student representatives are barred from speaking at the meeting. The Regents
adopt President Kerr's version of the CCPA faculty contingent proposal, allowing
fund—raising and recruitment, but banning "illegal advocacy." They also recommend

worganizations and individuals be disciplined for their violations of rules over the,
’past three months. Significantly modifying the report of the five man faculty

panel (Heyman Committee) which asked only censure of the six students, the Regents
reinstate all eight but do not clear the records of the six as the faculty group

tasked. Two students are placed on "probation." The students debate ways
»of expressing.their disappointment. Some graduate students want an immediate sit~in,
.but Mr. Savio convinces the thousands of students to return home for the weekend and

calls a rally for Monday to discuss future action.

November 21-22: The FSM Executive Committee and Steering Comittee both split
on-tactics with a majority of each finally favoring a sit-in in Sproul Hall on
Monday to express their feelings of despair over the Administration's refusal to
meet with them or to permit students full Constitutional rights on campus.

November 2§: Three hundred students sit—in for three hours in Sproul Hall
after hot debate during rally splits the FSM.

November 25: Chancellor Strong says the new rules are in force only at Bancroft
and Telegraph. He says the administration has met the faculty demands almost com»
pletely. The FSM goes back to setting up tables. Thanksgiving intervenes.

November 28: In the midst of the Thanksgiving weekend, Art Goldberg and Mario
Savio receive letters opening new disciplinary action against them for acts allegedly
committed October 1 and 2.

November 30i Jackie Goldberg receives a similar letter. Several professors
offer package proposals close to that of the FSM. FSM appeals again for talks
regarding the advocacy issue and demands the new changes against some of its leaders
be dropped. Plans for a sit-in in Sproul Hall are discussed if President Kerr

_ still refuses to discuss the FSM position.

Q§g§mb§§_l: The Graduate Coordinating Council and the Teaching Assistants
decide to go on strike Friday, December 4.
