THE American people are a merciful people. American sympathies are ever _

awakened -by human suffering. In a thousand ways, among which our vast
benevolences furnish glorious examples, Americans have demonstrated that they
are warm-hearted and not hard-hearted. Brotherhood is our ideal, recurrently
acclaimed within our several religions as well as by our unchurched. All of us
have, at times, fallen short of those ideals. But, deep in our souls, we cherish those
ideals. Rare is the American who does not honor mercy and does not revere

brotherhood.

Also among American ideals is that of loyalty to the United States. Sometimes
religious ideals and national ideals conflict, and devout people occasionally affirm
that there is a law of God which is higher than the law of the state. This is not
our own position. Most of us defer to the laws of the state without reservation.
The laws of the state should be obeyed. To the laws of the state, everyone owes
allegiance.

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have been convicted of a law violation. Large
numbers of people look upon this conviction as unjust, like the conviction of Leo
Frank or Alfred Dreyfus or others who, though pronounced guilty, were subse-
quently proved innocent. Some deem Julius and Ethel Rosenberg innocent. There
are also those who, while non-committal as to the couple’s guilt or innocence, do
nonetheless insist that the trial was unfairly conducted. Persons versed in the
law have pointed out what they regard as improprieties in the proceedings. But
we shall waive all this. Let us concede that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg did com-
mit the crime with which they are charged. Let us grant that the trial entailed
no breach of justice. Still, is it compatible with the finest in the American spirit
that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg be put to death?

It is argued that, through the betrayal of atomic secrets by the Rosenbergs,
Russia gained a military advantage. That the act alleged of the Rosenbergs im-
parted to Russia any military advantage has, by no means, been proved. But
granted that such advantage for Russia might have ensued, others convicted of the
identical crime—Fuch.s, Greenglas.s, Gold, Sobell, Slack, Simons, May, Brothman
—have not been sentenced to die: they have been sentenced to terms of imprison-
ment. If the death penalty was, in those other cases, not requisite for our national
defense, why should it be so regarded in the case of the Rosenbergs?

UNIQUE FACTIDBS

THE misdeed imputed to the Rosenbergs is said to have had its inception in
1944 and 1945. At that time, the United States and Russia were allies. It is
diﬂicult to see why Russia should, at that time, have found espionage at all neces-
sary. The United States was, at that time, sharing its military secrets with Russia
as it was with England and with Canada. As matter of public record, Harry Hop-

kins himself, at that period, mediated the transfer of nuclear materials to the

Soviets. The law against atomic espionage does not, it is true, distinguish between
a friendly power and a hostile power. It forbids the betrayal of atomic secrets
to any foreign power. But must the punishment be made equally severe in both

instances? There is a huge difference between a friendly power and a hostile
power. In the breadth of that difference, is there no room for mercy?

The law violation of which the Rosenbergs are accused is alleged to have
occurred at a time when the atomic bomb was unknown to everyone except a few

highly trained experts; it was prior to Hiroshima. The day after Hiroshima, all

of us knew about the atomic bomb. Previous to Hiroshima, none of us knew.
Even if the Rosenbergs did conspire to betray atomic secrets, they could not
possibly have comprehended the import of what they were doing. Clemency to
the Rosenbergs can, in no way, constitute a precedent against the death sentence
for future infractions. The factors in the case are utterly unique. Never can those
same factors recur.

All of this applies regardless of what might be said about the people by whom
the Rosenbergs are being aided. Among those seeking to save the Rosenbergs are
people of all political parties, several religious cults, and various walks of life. All
of them are people like the reader and the writer of these words, Americans whose
interests lie in America, who have everything to gain if America gains and every-
thing to lose if America loses. By no stretch of the imagination, can any friend
of the Rosenbergs, in any way, proﬁt by anything through which America is
injured. ‘ .

The sinister word “Communism” has entered into the situation. There are
words which, by a kind of fatal spell, dissipate thought and generate fury. Among
such words, “Communism” plays at present a dreadful role. The word conveys
so many different meanings that it has become almost void of meaning but, the
less meaning a word holds, the greater sometimes its potency for passions which
unbalance thinking.

THE 0MINOUS W011!)

ONG before the cold war began, a communist was understood to be someone

who aims to overthrow the United States government “by force and vio-
lence.” Our imbroglio with Russia has, during the last seven years, woefully
intensiﬁed this charge. A communist is now asserted to be someone who promotes
the interests of Russia in opposition to the interests of the United States. Would
it be out of place to ask the reader: Have you ever met anyone who advocated
the overthrow of the United States? Have you ever read any book, article or
pamphlet which urged such overthrow? Have you ever heard any public speaker
recommend such overthrow? It is sometimes maintained that people harbor such
designs but keep them secret, forbearing to express them openly. Yet how can
we possibly know anyone’s unexpressed thoughts? With equal warrant, one might
accuse, of clandestine subversiveness, Dwight Eisenhower, Adlai E. Stevenson,
Harry S. Truman or Robert A. Taft. S-till, let us suppose that the friends of the
Rosenbergs consist only of traitors. How does that touch the merits of the Rosen-
berg case? How does that alter the preciousness of mercy? Must the Rosenbergs
suffer because of the sins of their friends? -

The truth will have to be sought in the sinuosities of the human mind. Every
life is beset with frustrations. All of us suffer vexation and disappointment.
Psychologists have studied the tendency of organisms, whether human or animal,
to retaliate for frustrations by striking back. If the organism can not reach its
real offender, it attacks some substitute, some “displacement,” as the psycholo-
gists call it; like the man who, reprimanded by his employer, yet not daring to
answer his employer, comes homes and vents his spleen on his wife and ‘his chil-
dren: or- like the boy who resented the domination of his father but, powerless
to get even with his father, waited twenty-ﬁve years and shot down “Father”
Abraham. That boy’s name was John Wilkes Booth. This displacement of griev-
ances is a familiar psychological phenomenon. Unable to get at those who are
the‘ real causes of our woes, we wreak vengeance on scapegoats.

mm BASIC T1wUBLE  

FOR some people, the scapegoat is the Jew. For others, it is the Catholic. For

still others, it is the “capitalists” or “Wall Street.” The favorite scapegoat
of the present hour is the “communists.” This does not deny that there really
are people who call themselves communists and who feverishly advance extreme
theories about -the obligations of the privileged toward the under-privileged. Most
of us Americans dissent from those theories, even though the Republican Party
and the Democratic Party to which we belong may count, among their followers,
people holding Views but slightly less radical. The fact is that the opinions pro-
pounded by the communists have little to do with the conﬂict. Communism is, for
us, hardly a vehicle of political or economic ideas. It has grown to be an uncon-
scious symbol of the troubles which embitter our live.s. ’

Regrettably the Rosenberg case has become implicated with that deadly word.
Were the case to be judged on its merits, a great swell of protest would arise against
the sentence of death. Public opinion would encourage and support the President
in commuting the sentence.* The issue has unhappily gotten entangled in clichés
which cause Americans to forget that Americans are merciful.

One is reminded of the adage, “Know thyself.” If we would look deeply into
our souls, we might ﬁnd that our troubles are rooted not in the “communists” but
in the frustrations of our private lives. Once aware of this, we would recall words
spoken more than nine decades ago by the noblest American of them all. Ours
would then be the hope that America’s splendid ideals of mercy and of brother-
hood will yet reign within all hearts “when again touched, .as _surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature.”

funds to ﬁnance an appeal to the Supreme Court and, if granted, a new trial.
