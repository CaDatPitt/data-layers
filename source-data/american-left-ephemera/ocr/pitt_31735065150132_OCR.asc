There was little doubt,
however, that a Republican

it» was here that Mine-Mill’s

political weight was felt in key

congressional races and state

votes down to the county and

local levels; and where the
Mine-Mill areas of member-
ship and political concentra-
tion successfully bucked the
general trend with decisive
victories for most union-en
dorsed candidates. 1

Vote Trend in West...

, DENVER—Political experts are still striving to make heads or tails out of I the“
Nov. 8 general elections which turned out the biggest Vote in the nation’s history and
named the next President by the smallest in argin in modern times. In many areas, the 
returns defied all predictions. In others, th e ’ ' l

  

Mill influence played a key
part: -

MONTANA —— Mine-Mill’s
major ’ concentration in the
three counties of Silver Bow

(Butte Local 1 and Melrose
Local 904), Deer Lodge (Ana-
conda Local 117) and'Powell
(Deer Lodge Local 834) car-
ried substantially for‘ the Dem-
ocratic ticket despite the fact
that Nixon won the state and

Republican Donald Nutter was‘

elected Governor. It‘ was the

first time since 1904 that Mon-

tana went against the national
vote for the Presidency,

AS&R Pensioner
Expresses Thanks

The following letter was ad-
dressed to the Editor of the
Mine-Mill Union:

“I want to express my thanks
and appreciation to the offi-
cers of the International Un-
ion, officers of Local 625, dele-
gates to the AS&R Council
and other members of the
Council from other cities for
persuading the American
Smelting & Refining company
to restore my 21 years of pen-
sion seniority. If I live to col-
lect a pension, it is through
your efforts and unity that I

will collect the full amount or

ice entitle me to receive.

“It gives me a good feeling
to belong to a Union that rec-
ognizes that an ‘injury to one
is an injury to all’ and will go
all out to protect the rights of
its members.

"THE MINE-MILL UNION

Salvas Charges Montana Code
‘Seriously Inadequate in Scope’

. BUTTE, Mont.—Mine-Mill District 1 Board Member Ernest Salvas charged here
Nov. 3 that proposals of the Montana Safety Code Committee are regarded by the

union as “seriously inadequate in scope.” _

The five-man committee rep-

impressed committee m e m b e r s at

the mining, quarry-

Blye of the American Chrome
Mining company.

Salvas’ principal charge lev-
elled at the committee was that
it “has been moved to modify,
to soften and to weaken the
effect of many of the safety
provisions in the draft code

issued by the committee _in

February, 1960.”

He testified that in response
to the committee's invitation,
the Mine-Mill district office in
Butte as well as Butte Local
1, East Helena Local 72 and
Great Falls Local 16 had sub-
mitted more than 30 specific
proposals for strengthening
the draft safety code.

“I NOTE with regret,” Sal-
vas pointed out, “that the com-

which we considered

mittee has incorporated less

than half of these proposals

in its latest revision of the
code. These recommendations

"were designed to strengthen

specific safety code provisions
inade-
quate in the light of our ex-
tensive practical experience in
mining, smelting and refining
operations and of our careful
review of the safety codes of
other states."

Stating that Mine-Mill re-
gards the proposed code as
seriously inadequate in scope,
he noted that the union’s Great
Falls -local last April advised

the committee of the lack of -

adequate code provisions for
safety requirements in the

smelting and refining branches
of the industry.

In this connection, Salvas
told the committee: “One can
easily; think of special hazards,
such as those associated with
the handling, of hot and molten
metal; I work -in . and around

reverberatory furnaces, con-'

verters and kettles"; the opera-
tion of cranes and booms; ex-
posure to noxious acid vapors
and arsenic, lead, cadmium and
other forms of industrial pois-
oning——a.ll peculiar to smelting

and refining. The absence of

any reference whatsoever to
these --problems is notable.”

TO CORRECT the inade-
quacies, Salvas, on behalf of
Montana's miners and smelter-
men, offered nearly fifty rec-
ommendations for strengthen-
ing various provisions of the
proposed code.
. Among these he listed the
deletion of escape clause pro-
visions exempting mines in

THE MINE-MILL board

THE MINE-MILL UNION

’ Dec'ember.- 

j_‘.f.;Vioe-President:
fKey Legislation Still
:. Faces Old Obstacles

A  HE NATIONAL elections are over, and we now have

it _‘ a Democrat in the White House along with Demo-

cratic majorities in the House and Senate. When the new

87th Congress opens next month, it will be up to the

American voters not only to watch what happens in Wash-
ington, but to see that the people they elect-
ed carry out the campaign promises which
put them in office.

One thing you will see for sure: the
Southern Democrats and reactionary Repub-
licans still holding their coalition, working
against the party platform which Kennedy
said would be m11st legislation if he were
elected. *

Democratic leaders like President-elect
Kennedy blamed the defeat of social legis-
lation in the last Congress on the veto or

' threat of veto by President Eisenhower. But

Howard the reasons for the dismal failure of that

Congress to enact laws benefiting the welfare of the people go

A  much deeper than that.

The main blame rests in the halls of Congress itself. ,
' A single committee, for instance, directly or indirectly killed

A  at least five major liberal pieces of legislation as well as block-

ing several others. Making up that committee—-the House Rules

.. ' Committee—were eight Democrats and four Republicans. Its
‘ fchairman: Howard Smith of Virginia.

. i ‘k * *
HE RULES Committee is only one of many roadblocks that
barred progress of liberal proposals in the last Congress.

. ‘Others were the filibuster, the seniority system or committee
 structure, and last but not least, the Democratic-Republican ,
1'  coalition I mentioned above which operated as an actual ma-
_ jority party on rollcall votes.

This combination of practices, procedures and party ma-
neuvering are the real factors that explain the sad record of
the last Democratic Congress on. such ~key -legislation as civil
rights, minimum wages, medical care for the aged, aid to edu-

' cation and housing.

I don’t doubt that Mr. Kennedy is sincere in his search for

new frontiers. But’ there is this old block house right athis “

doorstep that will still be around; and this is aresponsibility
that he, as the occupant of the White House and leader of the
Democratic party, will have to face up to.

../-“S *  

election, Vice-President Nixon and Senator Kennedy both

had a strong Negro vote. However, I think that it can be

 said that many Negro voters did not vote for either one.

Many Negroes in the South voted.Republica.n for "the simple

_ ' , reason that they just couldn’t vote for “White Supremacy” at
, ' a time when they are struggling, so hard for human dignity and
' ‘ equal rights‘. You see,-in Alabama the Democratic emblem is

  

 

 

‘ a game. rooster. The rooster may be alright, but above that
'~-emblem is the state party motto: “White Supremacy.” Nearly

every Negro who did vote under this emblem a.nd motto was so

it sick he could hardly pull_ the lever in the voting machine.

In 1944 the U. S. Supreme Court outlawed the so-called
“White Primary” which had been used so effectively to prevent
Southern Negroes from voting in any significant number from
1890 to 1944. Since then, any Negro who voted a Democratic
ticket had to Vote for “White Supremacy.” I’m afraid that four

years from now he will be too sick to vote under such a motto, '

especially when he has a choice.
' I ’ ‘k ‘k ‘k

HE NUMBER one objective of the new administration should
be to provide full employment and steady growth for the
nation in all fields.

The emphasis should be on more and better housing, edu-

'- cation, hospitals, roads, slum clearance, parks, dams‘ and other

public projects.‘ To the Republicans, that is “socialism” and

-President Eisenhower vetoed many bills for such purposes,

including help for distressed areas. _
What we ‘need is more spending for public purposes, less

' for private interests. The Republican theory of giving it to the

rich and let it trickledown has resulted in there being too little

 H. : trickling down low enough to reach the poor.

Clark Hits Conspiracylailing

Of 8 Textile Union Lea ders L.

._DENVER—‘——Imprisonment of eight AFL-CIO. -Textile. union officers and members . '
on conspiracy charges was blasted by Mine -Mill President John Clark last month as an _
“outrage” and “injustice.” Clark expressed; these sentiments in a letter of unionsoli-‘ 
clarity sent-Nov. 8._'to President William Pollock_of the Textile Workers Union of "

“ America. 1-  :. .

Hearing Gets True Story

‘On Mine-Mill Democracy '

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Hearings on the Mine-Mill
case before the Subversive Activities Control Board con-
tinued last month, marked by the appearance of several
Mine-Mill staff members and a number of rank and file
members from District 5 and 6 as defense witnesses.

‘ Testimony of the rank

and filers filled pages of

the record with the true story
of how their union A really
works, showing that it is the
membership itself which runs
Mine-Mill, and not the officers
or any outside influence.

To a man, their testimony
supported the union argument
that Mine-Mill is the most
democratic union. in America,
and that no policy is adopted,
either by the local unions or
the International, without-full
discussion and vote of the
membership.

OUTSTANDING as impres-
sive witnesses were District 5
Board Member M. C. Ander-
son and Regional Director
Jesse Doster. .

Highlight of A11derson’s tes-
timony was-his account of the
T. C. I.- election at Bessemer,

.Ala. in 1949, when Mine-Mill

was raided by the Steelwork-
ers. He was able to bring out
that George Elliott, the Steel-
workers staff member who at-
tacked former secretary-treas

_ urer Maurice Travis causing

Travis to lose an eye, was the
same George Elliott who beat
up a leader of the opposition
to Steelworkers President Da-
vid M_cDonald at the recent
Steel union ‘convention. ‘_ ,

Doster’s testimony about his

gvwork in,’ District ,5 i- over many “
 years clearly. gave :,additiona1._.

   

  
   

evidence in support of the un-
ion’s case. -
=l< * >3 ’

WHEN the proceedings re-
cessed for _a week on Nov. 18,
Research Director Bernard W.
Stern was still on the witness
stand after giving testimony
lasting over six days of hear-
ings. His testimony covered
the story of Mine-Mill- collec-
tive bargaining during and
since World War II, and the

= facts about the union’s exten-

sive work in the field of health
and safety.

Introduced in s u p p o 1' t of "
Stern’s testimony was" a large ‘

number of exhibits based on
facts from government sources
and files of the Mine-Mill Re-
search, department. Stern was
not only able to show"that the
union has ‘done an ‘outstanding

, job for its membe1°ship during
‘the last. 15. years, but that its
‘achievements compared very

favorably with those of other
and larg,er.'unions._ ,_

On cross-examination, the
government attorney made no
serious effort to shake Stern’s
testimony. His questions, in
fact, only succeeded in bolster-
ing it. C i

More testimony by rank and
file members from “Districts 3
and ,5 was ‘scheduled during

Education Program

TUCSON, Ariz.——Phelps Dodge locals in Arizon“
Texas and California moved ahead last month on another.
phase of their PD Council’s ambitious 5-point prograrnl
educational and training sessions for officers, steward

and committeemen.

A series of classes, sched-
uled to run six weeks with
discussions led by local lead-
ers, has already been launched
in each of the areas. .

The final sessions at Bisbee
and M 0 1' e n c i, Ariz., and El
Paso, Texas, will be led by PD
Council Coordinator Sylvain
Schnaittacher who is directing
the program and who prepared
the instruction outlines for use
by discussion leaders.

Subjects being» covered in.
the series include: the contract
on jo-b security; wage protec-

. tion in the contract; fringe

benefits under the contract;
safety on the job and the com-
pensation law; grievance han-
dling; and grievance men and
stewards on the job. '
Each of the outlines poses
a broad range of detailed ques-
tions designed to stimulate dis-
cussion and equip stewards
and committeemen with full
knowledge of the contract, in-
dustry problems and the func-
tion of the union on the job.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 Closing of Leadville Smelter

'DENVER—Mine-Mill last month called upon the American Smelting & Refining
company to postpone its announced closing of the lead smelter at Leadville, Colo.

A letter Nov. 23 from President John Clark and Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dich-
ter to AS&R Board Chairman J. D. McKenzie urged postponement of the shutdown “to
allow the Kennedy administration and the newly elected 87th Congress an opportunity

,...}*“tract.

 ' mands. -. »
 The, result

 

to develop a constructive
solution to the problems of
the domestic lead-zinc mining
industry.”

At the same time; Colorado’s
Democratic U. S. Senator John
Carroll also wired McKenzie
to -reconsider plans for the
closing at least until June “to

V. mgive‘ new President, new Con-

gress and domestic mining in-
dustry one more opportunity
to provide answer‘ to need for
additional volume at ’Lead-
ville.”

A copy of Carroll's telegram
was sent to Clark who earlier

8 ’ had urged Colorado's congres-

sional delegation and federal
authorities to use their inﬂu-
ence for persuading the com-
pany to halt the shutdown.
IE: bk '1? '

MINE-MILL further called
on President-elect Kennedy
and his advisers, as. well as
Senate and House leaders. of
both" parties, “toadd the

-weight of their inﬂuence in

support of this request for a
postponement."
Directly linking the present

8 -.60-year low in U. S. lead mine

production-- with.. government-
al failure to deal construc-
tively with the industry’s prob‘-
lems, the Mine-Mill officers
said the low lead ore produc-

tion, especially in the Rocky.

Mountain area served by the
Leadville smelter, “is the main

, factor behind the decision to

shut down this important fa-
cility.” -
. ‘.‘B-~_§.,"’. they added, “if the

company proceeds with the
shutdown, this will inevitably
setback efforts to rehabilitate
the lead-zinc. mining industry
in this territory.”

The officers’ letter under-
scored the need for an ade-
quate subsidy program to fos-
ter a strong domestic industry
for the -production of these
critically essential metals, not-
ing that such a program was
considered by the 85th Con-
gress and passed the Senate
in 1958, but failed to pass the
House; .

CALLING for renewed ef-

forts, they asserted:

“The time has now come for
a reassessment of the indus-
try’s problems in the light of
past inaction by the govern-
ment, and in the light of the
important contribution which
a strong domestic industry

could make to a solution of
the country's critical balance-
of-payments problem.”

Pact Clauses

Boomerang (\

Against Steelworkers Pay

Last winter, David J. McDonald, president of the
United Steelworkers, called the settlement reached with
the steel companies “the greatest contract in history.”
The Steel Union's newspaper said the steel workers “wrote
their own triumphant terms” in bringing about “the most

complete rout of the in-
dustry.” .
Now, however, Steelworkers
members are about to discover
painfully the existence of two
little-noticed clauses in the con-
tract signed by McDonald~ last
winter. One of these clauses is
about to wipe out most or all
of the three cent cost-of-living
increase that would have been
payable as of December 1 this
year and‘ which would have
been necessary to adjust pay
to increases in the consumer
price index. .
The loss of the cost-of-living
pay increase is due to a little
publicized concession made by
the union, which agreed that
cost-of-living boosts could be
reduced or eliminated if com-
panies health insurance costs
rose more rapidly than fore-
cast at the time. This has hap-
pened, and U. S. Steel says in-
creased insurance costs are

"8 7’'enough to completely wipe out

the cost-of-living increase.
’!‘v * ¥l=

THE OTHER contract clause
that is causing trouble is the
provision for supplemental un-
employment benefit payments.
In the negotiations last winter
the Steel Union originally
asked that the companies
‘continue contributions to the
S.U.B. trust funds during the
1959 strike. The Union also
asked for a change that would
have postponed the cutting of
S.U.B. benefit payments as
governed by the former‘ con-
In the end the Union;
gave" up oneboth of these‘ de:

  

I has  5-tiiat —_

 

S.U.B. payments to thousands
of unemployed steelworkers
have already been cut, and by
mid-winter, in all probability,
17 of the 18 largest U. S. steel
producers will have cut S.U.B.
payments by 25 per cent or
more.

As the Wall Street Journal
observed recently in a story
headlined “Two little-noticed
Steel Pact Clauses Costly to
Workers,” there's some em-
barrassment in the situation
. . . for the union."

the shoulder. Brother‘ Wenzel
was working"-in 49/018 square
set stopea when the accident oc-
curred.

He had been trapped by
fallen debris for over six hours
before mine rescue teams
reached him. They brought Dr.
Barrie Flather who performed
the operation W i t h o u t- an-
esthetic and with the only in-

strument he had with him——a.

pair of scissors. A dim battery
headlamp provided the only il-
lumination.

THE CONDUCT of" Dr.
Flather earned the everlasting

respect of all members of the

rescue team and the following
telegram was immediately dis-
patched to B. C. Premier Ben-
net by Mine-Mill Canadian Dis-
trict Union 1:

‘fWhile recognizing outstand-
ing valor of mine rescue team
of Britannia we consider ac-
tions of Dr. Barrie Flather in

entering caved workings. there-

after the bump‘ yesterday
should receive highestrecogni-1
tion for civilian, bravery and
on behalf of union "we urge
your government make ap-
plication to the authorities to
award him the ‘George Medal
in recognition of his heroism.”
1 The cave-in had blocked both
entrances to the working area
and desperate rescue workers
were forced to tunnel through
backfill below the rubble for
about 45 feet before the sound
of Wenzel’s voice guided them
upward through broken timber
to the caved area. The fact
that Wenzel himself remained
conscious and able by voice
to guide the workmen to his
exact position, despite his in-
tense pain and suffering, was
a major: factor in, the rescue.

AFTER opening a hole large
enough to c r a wl through,
George Priessler went in to

find Wenzel huddled in an

opening large enough fonhirn

to sit in. Priessler returnedto -»

the rescue tunnel to inform
Dr. _. Flather, who had been

standing by from the start,

,-that Wenzel’s arm was almost
severed.

Dr. F l a t h e r immediately ,

crawled in and, finding the

1 arm beyond saving, performed

the amputation. Brother Wen-
zel stood up bravely and all

the doctor could give him to

try to deaden the pain was
morphine tablets. .

On the doctor’s withdrawal
froin the = cramped opening,
Priessler again went in and,
with words of encouragement,
urged Wenzel to drag himself

through the narrow passage

to the tunnel.

When the rescue party V‘

reached the surface Wenzel
was rushed to the hospital ‘in
Vancouver where he is now
recovering from his ordeal. .

Canada Jobs Brief Stresses ye   
Public Works, More Benefits

TORONTO, Ontario—A brief on unemployment submitted to Prime Minister Dief-
enbaker from the International Union of Mine-Mill and Smelter Workers in Canada
pointed out that funds needed for vast public works projects could be provided if the
current $1,600 million arms budget was reduced.

The brief emphasized that since 1945 Canada has spent 21 billion dollars on arms

and that according to the

experts most of what was

produced is now considered ob-
solete.

Northern Rhodesian copper

mine workers, 30,000 strong,

reached agreement at end of

last August on a new 12-"

month contract calling for a
pay increase equivalent to
about 8 cents per shift.

Other recent developments
in the big, British controlled
African territory promise
more for the colored workers
than this meagre pay hike.-

In September, a new North-
ern Rhodesia anti-discrimina-

tion law went into effect. Pro-
test demonstration by whites
were quelled as police used
tear gas. The law opens res-
taurants, movies, and hotel
dining rooms to all races.

In November, white mine-

workers voted to support the

end of discrimination in em-
ployment in Northern Rho-
desia’s copper mines. Union
leaders before the vote issued
a statement that the only so-
lution to the problems of the
African miners was a system
in which merit was the only
criterion for promotion.

The new plan abolishes sep-
arate categories of jobs, and
pay, for‘ whites and Africans,
and sets up in its place a uni-
fied wage structure.

The anti-discrimination law
and new wage structure in
the copper mines have been
favored by'a British Commis-
sion, and by Rhodesian Selec-
tionl Trust," largest copper pro-
ducer in. the copperbelt.
British Government and the

THE OCTOBER data were
released after the election last
November 8. Democrats and
the AFL-CIO had charged
the Eisenhower administration
with suppressing the informa-
tion in order to avoid hurting
the chances of Vice President
Nixon. ‘

A Labor Department spokes-
man admitted that the ad-
ministration‘ had 1' e 1 e a s e d
October unemployment data in
advance of previous November
elections, but that this had not
been done this time. October

unemployment data released "“ "

in 1956 before the last Presi-
dential election was considered
favorable to the Republicans.

A Wall Street Journal sur-
vey published’ No'verr'1ber '15
concludes that unemployment
in December’ and January will
probably ‘be, higher than the
Labor Department predictions
which are based on seasonal
factors alone. '

The Journal survey is based
on questioning of nearly 200
big companies in major U. S.
cities.
panies said layoffs would be
no more than usual this year.
Of the other half, one-third
said lay offs would be less
than seasonal, while two-thirds
said work forces would be cut
more than seasonally between
now and January 15.

an attempt to bring the com-
pany to the bargaining table,
AS&R’s northwest general
manager Joseph Kieffer again
refused to participate in the
meeting.

SKINNER charged that
Kieffer’s suggestion, instead,
to meet out of state at some
laterdate “constituted stalling
and evasion,” especially since
the last meeting between the
company and union was last

July. ’ .
_ He pointed to the fact that?’

AS&R signed a national agree-
ment with Mine-Mill covering
12 other properties last Decem-
ber, and ‘more recently signed
a year’s extension of the_ con-
tract with additional wage in-
creases and benefits.

,.“We intend to find out in
court,” he said, “why AS&R

refuses to bargain for its

Coeur d’Alene employees but
bargains and signs contracts
with the same union covering
thousands of otherfemployees

throughout the United States.” '

AT THE same time, the
union declared that leaders of
the “blue. card” Northwest
Metal Workers company-union
had saved Bunker Hill from
the same unfair labor practice
charges by filing their decer-
tification petition 24 hours be-
fore the company was sched-
uled to meet with Mine-Mill
under a 3-man Federal Media-
tion panel aimed at resolving
issues in_the prolonged strike.

This move, exposing the true L

WASHINGTON —— D e m o-
cratic Governor Albert D. Ros-
ellini bucked the GOP western
tide by squeaking through to
re-election while Nixon took
the state. Other Democrats
supported by Mine-Mill who

won were: John'A. Cherberg,

Lt. Gov. ; Victor A. Meyers,

The company promptly stated
that under the new situation
it would be illegal for them to
negotiate with Local 18 until
a determination of representa-
tion was made.

Further exposing the “blue
card” outfit was its maneuver
of having a decertification peti-
tion filed and then moving to
get on the election ballot as
an intervening petitioner.

FOR .WEEKS, the blue-card-
ers had been claiming they
had as much as 50 per cent of
the Local 18 members signed.
To petition themselves for an
election, all they needed was
30 per cent. Yet when it came
to filing the cards, all they
could produce was 15 per cent
to intervene through the back
door on a decertification peti-
tion. ' ' :

Proof of the imitation union’s
connection with the company
was disclosed when'Paul
Maness, Local 18 president, re-
ceived one of their cards in the
mail addressed to “Oren ‘P.
Maness.” Paul has never been
known by this name, and the
only place he is so listed is on
the Social Security roll of the
Bunker Hill company!

The blue-carders ,were fur-
ther discredited when their
secretary-treasurer, Lee Al-

weapon ‘and disturbing the
