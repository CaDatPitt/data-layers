HOW TO IDENTIFY A RADICAL

There are many people going around these days
who like to call themselves radicals. And yet,
for all their wonderful ideas, it is very diﬂicult
for their fellow men (or even their friends) to
identify them as such. They may be nice people
in general, trying not to cheat or lie or rob or
chisel except in most extreme circumstances.
They‘ may be willing to lend a helping hand to
friends in time of need. They may have all this
and much more in their personal makeup which
stamps them (to those who know them) as quite
nice people.

And yet there is not much about them to differ-
entiate them from other nice people who are that
way for other reasons — religious, humanitarian,
etc. —— but who are definitely not radicals in their
political and economic ideas. If not this way,
how then should one be able to identify a radi-
cal? ,

The difficulty with most radicals is that they
are content to allow their political, economic
(and sometimes ethical) ideas to be the com-
plete extent of their radicalism. Sometimes they
are active in a political movement and for a few
months, once every four years, can be identified
by the campaign button they are wearing. Just
as likely, however, they are disgusted .with all
existing organizations and are able to do noth-
ing but discuss issues with their friends, while
waiting for the great, new, wonderful organiza-
tion to emerge from somewhere.

Clothes

Very few radicals turn their minds toward new
wayslin the practices of day to day living. From
the way they dress, the way they eat, the way
they house themselves, the ways in which they
get recreation, their attitudes toward sex, there
is nothing which identifies them as creative in-
dividuals, -doing things in strikingly sensible
ways, when such ways depart from the estab-
lished, acceptable standards of respectable
society. '

Of course, some radicals dress shabbily with
an “I don’t care what people think” attitude; but
there is nothing to distinguish them from the
poverty—stricken or from bums.‘ Radicals should
dress sensibly and creatively regardless of popu-
lar fashion. They should initiate new ideas in
design -of clothing. In the summer they should

keep cooler than possible under present usage.
Shorts are legal in most areas.» This is a radical
idea only in the United States; in .Europe, wear-
ing shorts is acceptable for usual daily activities
during the summer. For the upper body, sleeve-
less, collarless, and backless blouses that really
beat the heat (and humidity), that cover the law
but little else, can also be made up quite easily
from old apparel or new material by any one
with an inventive frame of mind. And the sen-
sible radical who wants to live the revolution in
his own lifetime should also practice nudism
during the summer even if only in his own and
friends’ homes and in secluded woods, farms,
mountains and beaches. For colder weather (or

protection from the. blazing sun,) attractivle one -

piece zipper coveralls could be made up, as de-
scribed by Huxley in “Brave New World”, and as
is already worn by some professional night club
dancers. And a few years ago at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, a radical designer ad-
vocated the toga or poncho-style robe as the
most sensible type of clothing for both men and
women ever worn throughout the ages. He didn't
have the ‘guts’ however to go around in such a
garment himself.

Food

Food is a subject on which some radicals tend
toward such frugality and simplicity that they
lose one of the great pleasures of life. I believe
a sensible radical should go more toward the
other extreme and break with the tradition that
people eat only what they know, only those foods
and recipes to which they are accustomed. A
radical should even try to invent new recipes.
Lack of experimental attitude in regard to food
hardly ties in with the radical’s idea of revolu-
tion establishing a completely new way of life.

House and furniture ideas continue along the
same patterns. Most of us know radical artists
who also go in for architecture and furniture:
yet how few of us avail ourselves of these new
ideas for more functional and often more beauti-
ful and sometimes less expensive things of this
sort.

Recreation is a field where so far little of a
radical nature has been attempted, and much re-
mains to be done. The competitive, cutthroat

GARRY DAVIS I

When Garry Davis announced last summer that
he was going into temporary retirement to think
over his Views, it was clear that one of twothings
would happen. .Either the World Citizenship
movement would collapse for want of a concrete
place to go, or else Davis would come to a com-
plete renunciation of war. The decision has now
been made and Davis has become a complete
pacifist. . g L

‘Of course the World Citizenship Movement
could have become (like most World Government
organizations) a paper organization where well-
meaning persons could dream and talk, in the
safety of numbers. But what distinguished Davis,
from the beginning, was that he was interested
in more than talking and writing. He took con-
crete action in accord with his beliefs, even
though he had to act alone. This reverses the
usual policy which is to defer action until some
future, day when large numbers are ready to act.
Interestingly enough it is only those rebels who
act alone, as Davis did, who succeed in the end
in capturing the imagination and support of large
numbers.

Vincent Sheean, another recent convert to
pacifism, has yet to prove himself in action. Per-
haps that is why TIME praises Sheean and ridi-
cules Davis. Talk is‘ respectable, as long as it
does "not threaten to get down to business. That
Davis means business can be seen not only in his
actions but also in the letter he wrote to the
President of France. Here he says:

“To be a true pacifist today requires real cour-
age and self-sacrifice. It is not a refuge for
cowards, a criticism which has been leveled at it
in the past. It means swimming against the gig-
antic and deadly social stream driven by fear-
force, hate, and Violence. It means not only
turning the other check, but also loving the
enemy, for the enemy is also a part of mankind,
however misdirected. I hope I shall always have
the courage to resist the evil of division—though
I am increasingly aware of my failings and weak-
nesses — and be prepared to offer, in what little
measure I am able, those unifying sentiments
which I know fill the core of my being.”

There, are growing potentialities for a strong
non-violent anti-war movement in the United
States. If Garry Davis returns to the United
States, as he intends, he may play a significant
role in its development. The success of the move.
ment will depend, however, not on Garry Davis
or any single personality but rather on the ability
of many others who see the futility of war to
translate their opposition into concrete personal
acts. One person who becomes a world citizen is
worth a hundred who talk and write .about how
nice it will be when everybody does so.

To the Editor:

It is a mystery to me why such liberal periodi-
cals as ALTERNATIVE and THE PROGRESSIVE have
given an unfavorable reception to Vincent
Sheean’s LEAD KINDLY LIGHT’, while a magazine
like TIME gave it a sympathetic review. It would
seem that those interested in non-violence
would welcome the addition to their ranks of a
man who has a wide audience among liberals who
have not heretofore been interested in Gandhian
pacifism.

Because Sheean does not go as far as you
would like — does not advocate a mass movement
for civilhdilsobedience —;c it seems to me childish,
to say t e east, to attac the book on the grounds
of being “poorly organized,” “a hodgepodge,” and
“artificially” written. I am grateful to the author
for an account of Gandhi’s life ond of Hindu
philosophy written in a manner so lucid, under-
standable and compelling to the reader. . . .

I agree with you in that I was let down by the
final chapter of LEAD KINDLY LIGHT. I would

* have liked to see the author advocate a move-

ment of civil disobedience. He does, however,
support individual SA-TYAGRAHA (which some
members of your group are heroically carrying
out), and this is going a long way for someone
who consistently and over a long period sup-
ported a war against F acism. Give him time; he
may go farther. Do you remember how long it
took to go “all the way” in the thinking out of
your pacifist ideas? — it did for me -—— or per-
haps you were born a pacifist. I would never
scorn the sincerity of one who has gone this far,
as you have done.

Dear Friends:
In the special mimeographed issue of ALTER-
NATIVE, containing letters from Sandy Katf there
appears the following editorial comment, intended
to clarify a reference in the text: “This is com-
ment on an article by Paul Goodman in the
March issue of RESISTANCE advocating registra-
tion mainly on the grounds that those from 18
to 26 are too young to make" decisions on such
matters.”
This is a plain mistatement of fact: Goodman
did not advocate registration for the draft.
RESISTANCE would not print an article advo-
cating registration for the draft. We do not do
the work of the government, and ALTERNATIVE
should be aware of this.
——DAVIP WIECK
Paul Goodman did not advocate registration
per se and we regret having said that he did.
Apparently what Goodman did imply in his arti-
cle is that non registrants should not make their
position on the draft public, there should be no
open movement by non registrants, that jails
should not be considered better institutions than
the army.

 

TOTALITARIANISM: VATICAN A STYLE

 

THE VATICAN IN WORLD POLITICS —— Avro
Manhattan, 444 pp., Gaer Associates, $3.75.

AMERICAN FREEDOM ‘AND CATHOLIC
-POWER—Paul Blanshard, 350 pp.,
Beacon Press, $33.50.

These books are a grim reminder _that there
exists in our midst the potent remnant of an
epoch once commonly regarded as the period of
blackest reaction in human history and to which
is inextricably associated the terms “Dark Ages”
and “Inquisition.”

In Manhattan’s book (originally published by
C. A. Watts, in London) the Church which does
not engage in political activities is able to have
over 400 pages devoted to just such activities on
its part. As glaring as any indictment in a long
and grave list would be its support, open and
tacit, to the rise of Nazism. At the very outset in
March, 1933, the Catholic Party in the Reichstag
with the prodding of the Vatican voted for Hitler.
In July, 1933, following instructions from Rome
the Party dissolved itself altogether, declared in
support of Hitler, and thereby assured his en-
sconcement in power. Even after the purges and
the killings, even after Catholic leaders like von
Schleicher and Strasser were murdered and all
Catholic organizations destroyed, the German
Hierarchy and the Vatican continued to support
Hitler. “The ‘authority’ which claims to be the
moral authority of the world was practically the
only one which did not utter a single word in
defense of the persecuted, or 6f reproach to the
Nazis . . . the same ‘authority’ which asked the
Spanish people to disobey their Government.”
Only when the specific interests of the Church
itself were involved were there any signs of pro-
test.

Catholics and Nazism

When the Nazis annexed Austria, Cardinal In-
nitzer welcomed them “with swastikas in the
churches and with the ringing of bells" and
“ordered his priests to do likewise.”

“While the horror of the bombing of Warsaw
was going on, and Catholic people were being
massacred by the Luftwaffe . . . instead of pro-
testing to the world against the German attack,
he (the Pope) remained completely dumb. Not
a single world of condemnation, not a hint that
Nazi Germany should have been, at least mor-
ally, condemned by the Seat of Catholic Mor-
ality.”

Hitler, a Catholic, was never excommunicated.

Only after more than a month following Ger-

A many’s complete defeat did the Pope go on rec-

ord against Nazism.
It might also be of interest in these days to
note that the Church, once while it was ranting

against Bolshevism, tolerated, and even negotiated
with the Bolshevists in order to crush the rival
Orthodox Church; and that it opposed Soviet
measures directed toward religious toleration out
of fear of a resurgence of thispsame rival.

Blanshard’s book, which bears the endorsement
of John Dewey and Henry Sloane Coffin among
others, is a close study heavily documented -—
not always, however, with the help of Catholic
publishing houses, citations from the works of
two of these having to be used without permis-
S1011. ~‘

Here is delineated the diametrical opposite of

the things we stand for, the antithesis of individ- V

ual freedom, conscience and intellectual enlight-
enment. “. . . .let those who live in obedience
allow themselves to be disposed of at the will
of their superior like a corpse which permits one
to turn and handle it any way one pleases.”
(From the mandate of the Constitution of the
Jesuits.)

For (wholesome sexuality, there is the all too

. revealing “sublimation” offered nuns: f‘. . . you

ought to live, breathe and pant for your Celestial
Spouse alone . . . a union with Him, so intimate,
naked, simple, sweet, and so perfect that noth-
ing can be added to it . . . Oh holy inebriation,
which in the holy commerce of prayer transports
a soul into the cellars of divine love . . .”

White ls Black

There is still demanded the intellectual sub-
servance that Loyola once expressed (“. . . if
anything shall appear white to our eyes which
the Church has defined as black, we likewise
must declare it to be black.”). As recently as
April, 1948, the official world Jesuit organ arrog-
antly proclaimed, “The Roman Catholic Church,
convinced, through its divine prerogatives, of be-
ing the only true church, must demand the right
of freedom for herself alone . . .”

And it is perhaps well to be reminded that bar-

baric obscuantism 400 years after the Reforma-
tion still survives in daily practice, that where the
Catholic view prevails even a doomed emhryo
may not be removed from the uterus though that
be the only means to save a woman’s life, that
sterilization may not be rendered even in cases
where pregnancy means certain death.
‘ But the reception that this sober study has been
afforded is possibly the best proof of the validity
of its thesis, a study that New York publishers
could not print, that the general press cannot re-
view, that NewvYork’s largest department store
cannot stock,‘ and for which the publisher’s win-
dows were smashed.

It is almost a moral obligation to read it.

A RADICAL

nature of modern sports reﬂect often to-the most
brutal extent the competitive, cutthroat nature of
modern capitalism. Yet, outside of a few play

cooperatives and folk dancing groups, nothing

much of a constructive nature has been at-
temped. And it is almost amazing, when you
stop to think of it, how many so-called radicals
are as wildly enthusiastic about the private com-
mercial baseball team( that makes its headquar-
ters in their area) as are the non-radicals. The
same spirit as in nationalism pervades them both.

The attitude of the radical towards sex still
needs overhauling. Many radicals are beginning
to talk more about the importance of psychology
along with economics and politics. And of the
various sexual drives and repressions that help
make up present society. But mere verbiage on
the psychology of sex is not enough to distinguish
a radical. The falseness and lack of need for

legal and/ or religious marriage‘ ties was an idea »

once so well accepted by radicals that they could
be easily recognized by their disdain for that in-
stitution and refusal to abide by it. Today, how-
ever, the trend in practice is towards the legal
and respectable; and most “radicals” who want
to share their lives with a member of the other
sex are getting married before (or shortly after)
the relationship starts.
Sexual Taboos

Many other sexual practices and attitudes still
The practice of extra-mari-
tal intercourse is not limited to radicals, as we
all know and as is documented by the Kinsey
report. So radicals cannot be distinguished there
except possibly by their openness in‘regard to it.
And many radicals still shy away from open dis-
cussion of some sexual topics. Many shy away
from nudism because of the sexual taboo. Many

are still not completely open with children about
sex.’ A very common taboo is the avoidance of
using the bathroom while a member of the other
sex is in it. Most bathrooms are set up in such
a way that while toilet, sink, bath or shower is
being used, one of the other facilities could
easily be used at the same time. Outside of the
odor from defecation (which may some day stop
being so objectionable when the taboo is lifted)
there should be no rational objection to such use
of the bathroom. Familiarity with the human
body and its various parts and functions should
no longer be taboo for the radical. Another
foolish sexual habit is the washing of hands after
urinating. Outside of the sexual taboo (or the
rare occurrence where hands are wetted during
urination), there is no good reason for this
practice. The genitals, being covered all the
time, are generally quite clean; whereas the
hands, uncovered, are getting dirty and picking
up germs. So the washing prastice should really
be before instead of after. L

Radicals thus can make themselves known
without preaching economics or politics. -As their
lives are integrated into sensible practice in all
life’s aspects (instead of just some fine charac-
ter traitsione or another of which may also mark
the successful burglar or murderer) so will they
become more easily recognizable as radicals. And
while the public may be slow in allowing _good
sense to replace the usual respectable taboos and
practices, easily identifiable radicals will be con-
stantly planting seeds of good sense which may
win them more converts in time than all the won-

-derful political and economic ideas which gen-

erally lie quite dormant in their heads. Radical
changes in the day-to-day patterns of culture
should certainly prepare the way, if not the day,
for radical changes in the political and economic
spheres.
