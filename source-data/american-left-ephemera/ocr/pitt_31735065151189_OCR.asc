f‘I_3ut McCarthyism is‘ more than the ,

is the McCarran_Inte1'nal Security Act;

 CO talks

SUDBURY, Ont.————Members of ..
Mine-‘Mill Local 598 throughout ”
the Sudbury district are express-
ing enthusiastic endlorsement to
a brief of demands for the
Union’s 1954-55 contract bargain-

V ing with the International Nickel

Company. The current agree-
ment expires on May 31, and
bargaining was expected to be-
gin‘ about“? the middle of this
month.  ‘k . ,

The loca1’s brief of demands
follows through ' on the general
bargaining program -laid down
by the Mine-MiVll Canadian Con-V
vention held early in March.

Includedin the local demands
are a cost package equalling some
15 cents an hour, a group of de-
mands dealing with pensions,
severance pay and job security,
and a small number of demands
calling for changes in the body

' _ of the agreement.

A Local 598 negotiating coin-
mittee recommended by the
Union’s_ executive board is also
receiving the approval’ of the
Inembership. I

TIMMINS,_ Ont.—The end of the

~strike called by the CIO Steelworkers
in the gold fields ,,here has been ac-
companied by a full retreat- of the CIO
_ before subsequent company attacks on.
wages and job security. An announced
5-cent increase ending the strike has
failed to show up in take-home pay‘.
So -great has the CIO retreat been_
before. company pressiire that today
gold mine workers throughout the area
4 are taking’ cuts in pay through down-
‘ ward reclassifications and are filled

I ‘with the fear of insecurity. Stories are

rampant of penalty layoffs and out-
right firings for those who stand up
against‘ speedup or protest pay-cutting
reclassifications.
L At the big McIntyre mine, the bonus
miners (most of the underground men
are on bonus) found that the 5 cents’an
hour they were supposed to have won is
being taken away from their - bonus
earnings. / 
At _the big Hollinger mine a vicious
‘downward reclassification is in full
sway and men who were on a $131 rate
one day find, themselves working for
$1.10 the next. At the same time, Hol- ‘
1iDg€1"‘hoasts of sharp reductions in
manpowerwhile maintaining the same-
»produ_ction as before. i The company
predicts further cuts as well. ‘°” ‘
Under these attacks the CIO Steel-
workers have failed completely to fight
back. Consequently, CIO steward but-
tons have disappeared and no one is
willing to take up grievances__under the

Steel contracts that are still ‘in effect. ‘ ‘

The only sign of action on the part
of the CIO Steelworkers union recently ~
was a delegation to lobby for the check-
off, the major demand in the strike
which they failed to win.

B. Shorter Work Week

The-«Wlage Policy Committee pro-
posesadoption of the following state-

_ment of principles on the shorter work-

week: i
“The recent rapid growth of unem-

’ ployment in the non-ferrousmetals in-
dustry" again brings to the fore. the,

crucial issue of a shorter workweek
without loss of pay.

“This conference reaffirms our Inter-

national Union policy of struggling ‘for P

the six hour day with 8 hours pay.
“We propose to work for the achieve-'
ment of this goal through negotiations,

’ through education of our members, and

through legislative and politicahaction. I

As one means of working’ toward this
objective, We urge full support by all

locals for the Murray Bill (S 2914). A

which proposes to establish a‘ 35 hour

workweek under the Fair Labor Stand-_ 

ards Act within two years. _
“We further propose that the issue
of the six hour day with eight hours
pay be raised as a bargaining demand
wherever appropriate. A
“Also, we propose that all contracts
provide for immediate reopening of all

wageirates in the event of any i'ediictioi1

of hours in the present workweek.”

C. Supporffo Buffe Miners

The Wage Policy Committee pro-
poses adoption of the following reso-
lu,tion:V‘ "'\ H '~

“This, conference pledges its full. sup-

’ port to Butte Miners Union in their ef-

forts to achieve collar-to-collar pay and
adequate contract ‘mining rates. The
elimination of the old corrupt leader-

ship in Butte and the election of the.
new leadership ‘more-responsive to the _ '

demands and needs of the membership,

. *no.w/make it possible for Butte miners

to_ work more vigorously to achieve»

parity of conditions with the rest of the

industry.

“We recognize the need to imp1'o_ve
the ‘contract mining system and collar-
to-collar in other areas of ‘our jurisdic-
tion. Butte, however, remains the larg-
est mining ‘camp suffering from these
abus s. A victory in Butte,’ achieved

through U niorn-wide support there, will ‘

strengthen our fight for improvement,

of conditions in all -sections of the union. _
“The full resources of our Interna-

' tionalorganization mustibe brought to, ’

bear in support of the Butte miners.”-

7 BILL TO AMEND

THE SENATE Committee .on Education &
Labor has just reported a" bill to amend the
Taft-H_artley Act. Among other things, this
bill contains a provision that would give the
states jurisdiction to handle labor disputes
which affect health’ and safety. To this ex-
tent, the N.L.R.B. would lose jurisdiction.
This subject is probably the most impor-
tant which Congress will consider in connec-
tion with Taft-Hartley amendments. To the

workersunder the Taft-Hartley Act is de-
stroyed. ‘This provision would open the door
to all state right-to-work and similar laws,”
to state court injunction, and to all the
forces now operating in the states to destroy
the rights, of labor. — 

THEREFORE, I we oppose any so-called
“states’ rights” amendments to the Taft-

the Taft-Hartley Act as a whole should be

CIVIL moms AND FEPC

WHEN Senator Anderson of New Mexico
fought to change the Senate rules to permit
cloture and was defeated with the aid of the
Republican majority at the opening session
-of the 83rd Congress in 1953, Senator Dirk-
sen, Republican of Illinois, stated on the
floor of the Senate that there _was no need
for the Democrats to le-ad such a fi-ght. He
stated that the national and the Democratic
opposition should give the Republican major-
ity an opportunity to enact an effective
FEPC while the Republicans now’ held.. ad-

ministrative power for the first time in 20.

years. 

-It is now -well over.I4 months’ since the
Republican Senator, one of the leaders of his
party, made the plea on the floor of the
Senate. Yet nothing has been done.

While Senator Ives has gone through the‘

‘motions as Chairman of the Civil Rights
Subcommittee of the Senate Labor Commit-
tee by holding hearings on S 692 providing
-for an enforceable Fair Employment Prac-
tices Commission, neither the Administra-
tion nor the Republican leaders have shown
a willingness to get behind this legislation.
In the House of Representatives, the Powell
Bill, HR 170, introduced by the New York

Congressman, is stalled for either lack of-

hearings or sufficient signatures on a dis-
charge petition. A

The delegates to this Mine,‘ Mill and‘Smel-
ter Workers Conference call upon‘ the ad-'
ministration to take a firm standfor an
enforceable FEPC and for both houses of
Congress to report out within thenext thirty
days such legislation. ' ‘

In addition to FEPC legislation we recom-
mend that a special committee of they Judi-

ciary _Committees of both the House andv

‘Senate make ‘a’ thorough investigation of the

, voting franchises in all those states where
there is reason to believe citizens are being
deprived of their right to register and vote
by subtle evasion of the law. Recommenda-
tions from (such committees should go back
to the House and Senate with suggestions
for correcting legislation.

We further call upon all states who have
not yet done so by sessions of their legis-
latures, to repeal poll’ tax requirements for
voting. .. . y \

We hail thedecision of the,Suprgme Court
of the United States which was aimed at

- eliminating discrimination in restaurants in
the nation’s capitol, as well as the voluntary

actions of theater owners in Washington to
do away with segregation.

We further hope that the Supreme Court
will quickly rule to end segregation in our
school system and that we begin to practice
full democracy by making it a living reality
as we develop and mold the minds of our
children.

We urge all city and state governments
throughout thevnation to accept these leads
of our highest judicial body, toward the end
that discrimination may quickly disappear
in all forms from our American way of life.

THE tragic disunity of organized work-
ers in the United States and Canada can-
not be tolerated longer. It threatens
the existence of every union, the wages,
hours and conditions of every working
man and woman. It threatens consumer

‘ buying power, the mainstay bf our
economy.

The cost of disunity over the 17 years
since the .AFL-CIO division has been
heavy. In the field of economic welfare,

; it has meant gains much smaller than
could have been achieved. by one big
union. In matters of safety, health, job
security and other conditions,-the same is
true; It has meant’ failure to organize

‘ the entire labor-movement, a goal readily

 The resources wasted on raiding would
have organized most of the unorganized

most unorganized-—an open field for low
. wages and run-away shops. . '

f r ’ As for political power, disunity has cost
' the working people their birthright. Not
_ only have we lost the New ‘Deal, but we
, have been shackled‘ by‘ _ATaft-Hartley,
i Smith, McCarran-Walter‘ and the other
| union-busting laws. Taft-Hartley, a time

THE WHOLE world was shocked by the

. reports of the latestghydrogen‘ bomb explo-

- sion. Even‘ those who planned and carried

out the project were surprised by the destruc-
tive power of the bomb. “ A

While the victimwas only a tiny uripeoplednl
island in the Pacific, the same bomb could-

have wiped out an entire ,city of millions.
Now we are told that even this is not the
biggest or most destructive bomb in Amer-
ica’s arsenal. . i _ T 

It is nownearly nine years since the first

atombomb was dropped onﬂiroshima. With ,

every month that‘ passes, .the stockpiles of
these world-smashing weapons becomebigger
and more destructive. With the growth of
these stockpiles, the temptation to use them
'-—not in practice on Pacific atolls but with
deliberate intent to destroy entire cities of
' human beings——gets stronger. Yet long ago
it became clear that no nation could possibly
win an atomic bomb race. ‘ - =
Two years ago there were. those who de-
manded that the atom bomb be used in the
Korean War. We foresee the early possibility
that the same kind of demand will be made
before long in connection with the conflict
now raging in Indo-China. ' '

MINE—MILL’S program callingifor unre- ,

stricted world trade provides the long-range
solution to job security for our members.V
The non-ferrous metal markets of the United
States are glutted with..«imports of metals
from other countries. This surplus has been
a majorifactor in reducing prices of ‘these
metals sothat marginal and high cost mines
are closing down and the industry generally
is laying off workers_. Countries who cannot
sell their own products are "not economically
able to buy the product of the tremendous
capacity of our industry.

The head of the Chrysler corporation states
that he can sell millions of automobiles in
China. All of the machinery, tools, and par-
ticularly the fabricated goods of American

industry have a’ tremendous market if the»

barriers between East and West trade can be
eliminated. V v “
Wprld tensions which. have formed this
 barrier can be eased only by the development‘
of peaceful and friendly relationships.’ Trade
won (1 be a significant medium, therefore,_to
guarantee worldipeace. Ernest T. Weir, the
steel tycoon, recently said in a speechto the
national-industrial conference board that the
exchange of goods between the United States
and the countries of Asia and Eastern Eu-
rope are a vital necessityfto the American
economy. . ,
 More than, that, he said that England,’
France, and other countries must trade with
these areas to avoid’ economic collapse‘ in
-Itheirlown ‘countries. K L.
A We submit sthat the” only alternative to
world-wide peaceful relationships of which
trade is a major component is a hell-bomb
war. 'We’ll’ take trade.‘ Therefore, we recom-
‘mend that this part of’ the Mine-Mill pro-

 a las acci611es ridiculas del Senador de
.Wisconsi11, Joseph McCarthy.’,’

Al mismo tiempo, la resolucion dijo:

~ ‘.‘Pero McCarthyism es mas que el Sen-

poderes ‘de congreso para L-investigar

.Trabajos para derechos civiles y el fin de rnocarthyism. . _ V‘

“McCarthyism es ‘el atentado de la

. _, CUANDO el trabajo de temporada se_ acabé, ‘mileside estos.
trabajadores el aﬁo pasadophfuéron descargados al otro lado de .

la frontera, donde tuvieron que caminar cien millas al través

_ La posicién‘ illegal de estos trabajadores louhace imposible .
que ellos “protesten i_de"_vi_olaci6’nes de ‘acuerdos de sueldo, la
completa falta, de facilidades sanitarias, transporte» en carre- \

unidad de los trabajadores. ' '

Cuando el -gobierno de Mexico el aﬁo pasadohizo esfuerzos

"para ne-gociar unacuerdo para proveerqg rantifas minimasde
sueldos y cond-icionies de exi-stencia, los Esta os Unidos impedio 

negociaciénes Inientras agentes ‘de los irancheros grjandes esta-
ban recogiendo miles de trabaja‘dores\p‘ara pasar la frontera.

Esto resulto en ‘travesias de la frontera illegales de- monténes,

y en peor represién que nunca. _ .

‘ NOSOTROS dendandamos que el gobierno de los Estados
