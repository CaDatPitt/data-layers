' UTOMATION is something you hear azlot about
hese days. You 'can’t find the word in the dictionary‘.
ou”can’t -even find any so—called experts who agree on
 what it is. And yet most people, especially workers
affected by it, have a pretty good
idea what it is about‘: i L ‘V
 They know it means greater

  

automatic control and regulation

it means lossof jolasfielimination
of many classifications and scrap-
ping of skills.

like the Ford foundry where man-
agement boasts that “the mould‘

ing sand used to make castings 1s
 , never touched by human hands.”
'Or:the~automatic engine plant that turns out twice as

power. . L ‘ T ’

.  Theeconomists say that 1955 will be a year of “more

liange ‘that trend——it wants to make sure that the “auto-

ii For “automation” willimean economic chaos unless

‘The kind of mass buying power needed can only be

V. better st

,;in« the immediate future, was projecteii here January 9
by delegates to the Arizona Mine-Mill Council. The meet-
ing was heldin theheadquartersof Miami Miners Union,

      Local 586.    

   an

L The Council also went on record recommending that
Arizona Mine—Mill locals set up political action"com-

»  mittees to drive toward putting as much of ’the.. program

 as possible into, effect during the sessions of ' the’ state-

 uflegislature this year. Key in thesuccess of the program

 

will be unity of action with all other ‘labors-pgroups.
,3 , Topping the list ‘of goals in the program is repeal

. ‘of the state’s “right-to-work-for-nothing” law, a union-
’ bustingdevice which all of labor in Arizona has recently
seen used against- the AFL’s Culinary & eBartende,rs union

of  .  in Phoenix.’

Other main features of the program include liber-

alization of the present workmen’s compensation law,

  V .With special emphasis onssilicosis, andrindustrial disease; ,

sirnprovement of the state minimum wage and maximum

, hour laws; increase in state unemployment compensation
’\*benefits both in amounts and duration; improved schools

Q ’ and higher pay for teachers; repeal of sales tax on food
[- and other necessities; a real FEPC law providing for equal

‘ civil rights for all as well as -fair employment rights; etc.

1 - The Council” delegates, convening for their first ses-

sion since the November general elections, reviewed with

9. sense, of justified pride the
achievements of their locals in
the past political campaign.

There \was general agreement 

*1‘ ‘  that Mine—Mill gained consider-
. I able stature as a political force
in the state with the election of

federal, state andlwcounty candi- '

dates backed actively by the
locals. P

. Election of Dalton

Included among the score of
successes- was the election of
Clyde Dalton, member of_ Bis-

bee Local 551, to the state legis-’ '

lature. Dalton is nowadelegate
from the Bisbee local to the
 M-M Arizona Council.

Along this line, it was also
the general feeling of the Coun-
cil that the locals should start

gearing themselves now to drive,

for the election of a state mine
inspector from the ranks of the
miners themselves in 1956.

The delegates also agreed

that there should be no let—up~

Sin political action simply be-
cause the Democrats now have
a majority in Congress, but that

-the locals must organize and

continue to maintain regular
contact with their legislators,
both state and national.

Telegram to NLRB

The appointment bf Theophil
Kammholz as general counselor
of the NLRB was condemned as
another Republican nail*’in the
coffinyof what was once a fair
labor law. The delegates ap-
proved a telegram to Washing-
ton urging the Arizona senators
to vote against Kammholz’ con-
firmation.

On another agenda point,.the
Council heard a report on prog-
ress in the organizational cam-
paigns being conducted by Mine-
Mill at Magma Copper Com-
pany’s unorganized mine, mill
and smelter in Superi'or,"as well
as at the same company's big
new mine still in the develop-
ment stage at San Manuel.

made a speech telling the

TALK of a price increase in copper was based on-—

1. A ‘strike of 40,000. African mine workers, in Northern A

Rhodesia‘ which may cut off 36,000 tons a month;  ‘

2. A onecent increase in the price of pig aluminum to 21‘/;‘

shoremen, scheduled for January 10, -which would have further
tightened the supply situation.  - " A
Aluminum price up A A

The large copper companies were reportedly 'resi.sting any
pricegincrease for fear that it might bring increased competition

from aluminum, plastic and other substitutes. The .increa.sed price '

for aluminum, however,_ may have lessened that danger.

On the London ‘Metal ‘Exchange last week, copper prices \.

Copper production is expected to start within about five years.

RECENT lead sales declined, slightly butwere not expected to A

surplus production. A

cline of about 10% from the. previous year. Esti.n1atedN total. con- ‘

 Zinc; "

THE high rate of automobile production has criused a relatively

high demand for zinc from die casters. Also, since about May,
1954, there has been a greater use of zinc in all kinds of castings
The American Zinc Institute, commenting on the greater sub-
stitution of zinc forraluminum, attributes the clmngeover to two
main factors: » l . A A _ A

 A The judge listened for two days to arguments b
‘fpre-trial motions filed by Nathan

Rulings‘ 0i1De-Tense lhotiionms

Here is how Judge Breitenstein ruled on the Travis defense
’ motions after two days of arguments by Mine-Mill ‘lawyers:
O Orderedithe government to give the defense copies of all C
documents shown to the grand jury? which indicted Travis, as
wellas all documents the prosegltion—lawyers~p1an to use in

the trial.

0 Took under advisement the motion for a Bill of Particu-V «

lars which would let the defense know exactlyywhat actions or
7 -statements Travis is charged with, so that he andth-e~union can 
l . properly defend themselves when the case comes to trial.‘ Judge
Breitenstein said he thought the defense was entitled to more
facts than the government has‘ been willing to’ give so far.

0 Aisked for more time to consider the motion to,_toss the it

whole case out.

ODenied these motions; asking for a list of witnesses; 

‘ “asking that the government he orderedto choose which of the
«A charges it will prosecute-——members‘hip, affiliation or support;
asking. that grand jury evidence be dumped on the‘ grounds that

it was “hearsay.”

dictmentlagainst Travis is in-
sufficient because of vagueness.
He pointed to the fact that all
other T.-H» affidavits have
charged. that the a c c u s e d
“made, used, executed and filed
a false statement in a given
city,” while the “vague crime
charged aga-inst Travis in Den-
ver is that he ‘made and used’
a document.” .The indictment

~ as it stands: -“tells us nothing,”

he said. .
‘Hide and seek‘ -.
Asserting that the vagueness

of the Travis indictment was’

a deliberate attempt to dodge
'the venue precedents ‘set in

‘other T—H affidavitcases, Witt 

declared: “It seems to me the

government is trying to play
hide_and go seek with the Sixth

amendment” — which protects
the right to due process.

Turning to the two counts of
the six—count indictment charg-
ing “support of the Communist
Party,” Witt explained the leg-
islative and legal history of the
Taft-Hartley law to show that
-the ‘intent of Congress was to
“force” the foreswearing of any
noxious doctrine of which the
Communist Party may ‘be ac-
cused——that is the advocacy of
government overthrow by force
and violence.”

It was -not Congress’ inten-
‘tion, he said, to prevent labor
officials from supporting any

he /said between puffs on a
charred ‘pipe. “The Company
does, its -job with threats , and
money. Many a state history is
filled, with» accounts of the
money-over-the-transom kind of
lobbyin?‘ that this Company has
done in the past. The money
may not be “tossed around in
outright bribes — I wouldn’t
know for sure about that—but
there’s all kinds of heat a large
corporation can put on a state
legislator if he hasn’t got any
guts. If he’s a small business
man he can bestold by his bank
that his credit ratin’ depends

on his gratitude. Ditto a legis- J

lator who owns a ranch. His
job can be threatened if he
works for wages or salary. If
he’s politically ambitious he will
be told I to go along or else.
There’s lots of little tricks.

“The big difference is that
the Company lobbies with dough
and Mine-Mill and other unions
lobby with people. We can’t
throw big parties for legisla-
tors and stuff like. that. But

*»we’ve" got votes—lots of votes.

The only threat we hold over a
state legislator is democracy.
He either votes in the people’s

interest or the people don’t

vote for him.’{

a question from Mine-Mill General Counsel Nathan. Witt.,~ .3

Alvey said that agreement by Travis with any position
ofithe Communist Party amounted to “support.” ' *

If this standof the Justice,Department should be

upheld by the Court, any signer of a Taft-Hartley non-
Communist affidavit could be prosecuted for almost any-
thing he says or does in the line of union leadership.

Solski reports on trip
to visit European C unions  

SUDBURY, Ont. —- Brotlcr“

Mike Solski, President of Local
598 Mine-Mill here and Secre-
tary of the Canadian Mine-Mill
Council, recently returned from
Europe, where he was a guest
to the French Metallurgical Un-
ion and attended their National
Convention. ,

Brother Solski had been elect-
ed by the Mine-Mill members in
Central and Eastern Canada to‘
represent the Canadian Mine-
Mill in an exchange of delega-
tions between the'»French Union
and the Canadian Mine-Mill.

_ The French Metallurgical Un-
ion is one of the most powerful
Unions in France, and repre-
sents all the workers in the
Metal industry from processing-=~
in the foundries and smelters
through "fabrication and manu-
facturing. It is affiliated to the
French Labour Congress. (the
C.G.T.) which is affiliatedto

the World Federation of Trade.‘

Unions. ,
C
IN REPORTING on his trip,

Brother Solski stated he was
impressed by the tremendous

strides taken by the French Un-

ion in the field of social and
welfare work. He visited nurs-
erie's,- canteens, libraries, rest
homes, clinics, rehabilitation

centres all run efficiently by._

the Union and financed insome
cases by deductions from Com-
pany profits, in others by social
security, with the maximum.
paid by the workers being
about 20%. 7

He pointed out  ' example

‘that inthe ‘huge Re_l_laull:::£'§1fI}O ‘

works employing -10,000 work"-‘
€rs._he visited their modern so-
cial centre, with its huge li-
brary, creches and canteens fi-
nanced througl_1_.C6mpany prof-
its,“ yet managed byethe Union
in the best interest of the‘ workl-
ers. He added that the Renault~

g

plant was owned by the govern-
ment, and that its nationaliza-

tion was the result of a long * government

struggle by the militant Re-
nault workers.

BROTHER sonski, when
questioned as to how trade un-

ions functioned in France point- t

ed out’ that they do not have
certification, giving one union.
Rather he ‘said in one plant
there may be several unions
representing the workers. Their

representation is based on the -

number of delegates elected
from each union, depending on
how many "’votes that union re-
ceives.‘ ’ "

Thus in a plant of say 30
stewards, there might be 25'
metallurgical C.G.T., with the
other five being divided be-‘
tween the other unions. Each
delegate'or steward as we call

them, speaks for the workers he -

represents. However at the shop
level unity between the dele-
-gates of the various unions

‘against the employer, is often

achieved.

Biother Solski noted that the
trade unionists in France are
very union conscious, and that
the union activity of the rank

' and file worker is very high.

POLITICAL ACTION is ac-
tively engaged in by all unions,
with many workers sitting in
legislatures and on municipal
councils. The French Trade Un-
ions, he said, play an important
‘role in  the frame-work. _ of
‘Ereiich: *sot:i'ety and‘: no gove‘rii-
nient dares‘-ignore,-the-m. ‘

As an example of the active
political role played by union-
ists in France, he pointed to his

‘visit to Ville Ste,0uen, a city of. u

some 50,000, 'where<.the‘ General
Electric has a large plant» Here
he attended a meetingof the

1

ti

Union Executive Board held in
the city hall, for the municipal
is composed of
working people and trade un-
ionists.

From his: discussions with

‘French workers and their _un-

ion le ad e r s, Brother Solski
was impressed with their eager-
ness to know more about the
Canadian and U. S. workers and
their Unions. The dééire to have
closer co-opérationgand frater-
nal ties with the North Amer-
ican workers was expressed to
him time and time again.

THE HIGHLIGHT of the Ca-. .

nadian Mine-Mill officer’s visit
following busy days of visiting
many French plants and talking
with union members and offi-
cers, was the French Convention
of the Metallurgical Union.’
There, like at our Conventions,

said Brother Solski, the dis- “V

cfissions and resdlirtions were
around wages, pensions, social
security, jobs, _s"eniority and
other issues thatigtaffected the
workers.

ALONG WITH other frater-
nal delegates, Brother Solski
addressed the convention.
extended the warmest fraternal

greetings from the membership_
in Canada, and outlined for the“

benefit of the convention dele-
gates some of the problems fac-
ing the Canadian Trade unions.
He also dealt with the struggle
of the Massey-Harris and Ford
workers,‘ an ‘iss e, particularly
appreciated bydd:

elégates from

tliehjpliantsi of those‘ companies in  

'Franc'e.~- }, '= . a

Brother Solskiion his return '

to Canada announced that. his

experience in France has con-;_,.
-vinced him that every effort;
‘must beimade to streingthen’ the p .
lfraternal ties with the Euro- "W

pean workers.
