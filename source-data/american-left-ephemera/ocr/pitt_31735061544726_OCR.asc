BERLIN: THE CHIPS ARE BLUE

America's permanent war economy got a new lease on life this month
when the Senate voted a $46.8 billion military appropriations bill, the largest
"peacetime" measure of its kind in U.S. history. It exceeds last year's whopping
arms budget by more than $6.5 billion and even runs some $237 million higher

than the 1952 Korean War appropriation.

Behind the grim face of the front
pages that echoed President Kennedy's
stern message of sacrifice for the
American people, there were glad tid-
ings for theinvestors. One headline
on the front page of The New York
Times financial section of August 6
exulted: "Market Surges Ahead Under
Impetus of Plans to Increase Defense
Outlays.” Matching the record arms
budget, "The stock market soared
ahead...to record highs.”

The same story mentions that there
are 5,140,000 jobless people in the
U.S. today. With draft calls to be
doubled and tripled, and with a bright-
ened sales outlook for blast and fall-
out shelters, these unemployed folks
can cheer up. They will not remain idle
for long.

The stock market in the past has
shown a tendency to become shaky at
the prospect of a relaxation of East-
West tensions, and to perk up when
those tensions tighten. The brink of
war, it,“ éguld seem, is an investor's
paradisé;4~"*That nobody wants actual
war is a truism. But as long as mili-
tary spending is such a lucrative sub-
stitute for private enterprise -- with
the taxpayers thus subsidizing the
handsome profits to be had -- it is a
safe bet that we shall continue to
have war scares like the Berlin crisis.

The trouble is that one false move
could reduce all of us to ashes -- and
no amount of money will then put us
back together again."

Is there any alternative to the “blue

Without Abiect Surrender

"We demand not this or that
settlement of the Berlin question,
but a settlement arrived at by ne-
gotiation that each side can-ac-
cept without abject surrender. A
conference should be called to
deal with the Berlin question with
the absolute determination to reach
agreement, if necessary with the
help of neutrals."

--Bertrand Russell, excerpt from

Hiroshima Day speech.

chip” military diplomacy carried on
by and for the U.S. power elite? There
might be if the voice of conscience in
the churches would speak out, or if
organized labor would break its tacit
alliance with those who bring home the
defense contracts. Full employment
need not be geared to the military
machine if Americans are willing to
challenge the forces for whom war
preparations are profitable.

As John Swomley has pointed out
in his excellent recent Current Issues
study paper, "The Berlin Crisis,”"
some Senators, such as Fulbright,
Mansfield, Morse and Humphrey, “thus
far have seemed reluctant to write
Kennedy and the Pentagon a blank
check...Their hands could be strength-
ened...by a flood of mail to each Sena-
tor." That is not all that needs to be
done, but we must start somewhere.

Hiroshima Day Demonstratolrslliixx .  
Ask UN Intervene at Berlin

Over one hundred young people par-
ticipated in a 24-hour vigil protesting;
the East-West nuclear arms build-up:
and commemorating Hiroshima Day

was sponsored by the newly formed
Peace Action Center, headed by FOR
member Lawrence Scott, former direc-
tor of the Vigil at Fort Detrick.

‘;. A group of students and faculty at g
in Yellow Springs, _

i, Antioch College
ii Ohio, conducted a 12-hour fast and
:held silent vigils on the campus on
“§Aug. 5-6 in commemoration of Hiroshima
. ay. Money saved from the fast was
Eentito the War Casualty Hospital in
 iroshima.
Meanwhile’, in Hiroshima itself the
:_priests and people of the city gathered
‘on Aug. 6 to pray before the green
‘mound where the unknown victims of
the first atomic bomb are buried. This
was the sixteenth time that the city
has commemorated the first Hiroshima
Day when "the light of a thousand
suns” flashed over the city and reduced
it to radioactive debris.

Peace Marchers Enter East Germany

Thirty-five members of the American-
European march crossed the border in-
to East Germany on Aug. 7, after re-
ceiving official permission to enter the
country from East German officials.
During their 250-mile walk across West
Germany the team held many peace
demonstrations and distributed leaflets
urging unilateral disarmament. Local
newspapers carried stories of the march
and public response was considerably
sympathetic, according to a spokesman
for the group.

Soviet and Polish authorities have
also granted the team permission to
their countries. Distribution of
leaflets and demonstrations condemning
nuclear war preparations wilrl”-also be
allowed, officials said. “This is cer-

tainly the first time,” remarked FOR

lfsecretary-Emeritus A. J. Muste, who is
gmaking arrangements for the team, “that
_ifany group, not tourist, and not essen-
'tially Peace Council sponsored, has

ébeen admitted on these terms and with

, such a program into these countries."

ferred is the government-approved So-

In England last month, the Direct Ac-
tion Committee Against Nuclear War
disbanded, following a special meeting
of its members and close supporters.
During its 3 1/2-year history the DAC
experimented with a variety of nonvio-
lent techniques and initiated such
projects as the Aldermaston March as
well as many anti-nuclear vigils and
civil disobedience campaigns.

The Committee of 100, a similar
organization, will continue the work and
aims of the Direct Action group.

The U.S. Army last month granted a
“general discharge under honorable
conditions” to Pvt. Donald Heath, who
had been serving a 3-month sentence
at hard labor for conscientious objec-
tion to military service. Heath's case
recently attracted attention when the
National Service Board for Religious
Objectors urged the Defense Depart-
ment to establish a uniform policy for
all armed services on the matter of men
who become religious objectors after
entering military service.

The Air Force, Navy and Marines
have been giving such "general dis-
charges” to men who are found to be
of sincere religious convictions.

The Rev. Elmer R. Danielson, a Luth-
eran missionary who has served 30 years
in Tanganyika, last month charged that
U.S. churchmen seem more concerned
about racial disturbances in Africa than
racial discrimination in America. Speak-
ing before the Lutheran World Missions
Board in St. Paul, Minn., Danielson also
charged that the “awful discriminatory
situation in the United States is a power-
ful contributory factor toward anti-white,
anti-American and anti-church feeling
in that awakening giant of Africa.”

A vigil protesting the establishment
of a dam on the Seneca Indian reserva-
vation, which abrogates "without ne-
gotiation" a treaty made by the U.S.
with the indians in 1794, began at the
Kinzua dam site in Warren, Pa., on
Aug. 12. The vigil is urging the adop-
tion of a plan proposed by former TVA

director Arthur E. Morgan which, while
controlling floods in the area, would
not destroy the heart of the Seneca
reservation. People interested in help-
ing with or participating in the vigil
should write: Treaty of 1794 Committee,

Five families in Lincoln, Nebraska,
recently imposed a one—percent tax
upon their yearly incomes for donation
to the UN. “We intend this pledge,"
said a spokesman for the group, "to be
a tangible symbol of our willingness to
support and to live under a system of
world law.”

The first half of 1961 was the great-
est period of progress in the history of
civil rights legislation in this country,
according to a report made public last
month by the American Jewish Commit-
tee and the Anti-Defamation League of
B’nai B’rith. The study pointed out
that all areas of the country, with the
exception of the Deep South, contribu-
ted to this record. Legislation included
laws prohibiting housing discrimina-
tion, insuring fair employment practices
and barring racial and religious dis-
crimination in public places.

Congress of Racial Equality Director
James Farmer announced in New York
City last month that CORE plans to
establish ‘two regional offices in the
Deep South. "These offices,” -he said,
“will provide the CORE groups across
the nation better and quicker service in
the development of their action pro-
grams.” Farmer also announced that

he will hire four additional staff mem- _

bers "to increase the momentum of our
direct action challenge to bigotry.”
