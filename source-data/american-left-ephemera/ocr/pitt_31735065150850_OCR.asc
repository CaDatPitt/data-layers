Wage Policy Committee meets,

 

A DENVER —- With negotiations -
deadlocked in every one of the
i_ndustry’s Big ‘Four, the National
Wage Policy _Committee agreed
last week to give the U. S. Con-
ciliation & Mediation Service time
enough for a last-ditch effort to
bring a‘ satisfactory settlement.

The decision was looked upon
as a final step in the Mine-Mill
program of exhausting every pos-
sible avenue: toward a peaceful
settlement. It was one part of an
overall strategy, the details of

which were to be reported di-
rectly to the membership by
Policy Committeemen as soon as
they returned home.

The 25 -member Committee,
called here for a special meeting
to map "strategy in the face of
continued e m pl 0 y e r stalling,
agreed that all offers made so far

‘We've got to show, them‘

They listened grimly as one
delegate after another reported;
on long weeks of fruitless meet-
ings with management. “The em-
ployers in this industry still think
they can get away with a cheap
settlement,” one Committee mem-

ber said. “We’ve got to show

them how wrongthey are.”

Even while the two-day ses-
sion of the Wage Policy Board

This would fill most people with self-pity. But not Harry Hicks. He’s <mostly
angry; not bitter, but angry. He’s angry because there are no decent lawsxin this

'9 country of ours to protect workers who contract silicosis, dread disease of the ore

miners. He’s angrier still that there are no laws that a-re designed to help prevent

5,‘ silicosis.

Harry Hicks is 38 years old. He’s a memberof Salmon Miners Union No. 911.
A native of Salmon, center of the beautiful and primitive Salmon_,River country of

‘Idaho, Brother Hicks has been
married since 1935 and is the

' father of four children. One, a

daughter, is married. The others
are “16, 14- and 12 years old.

I ‘ Worked,al' Bune

Harry worked in the ‘Butte
mines from 1940 to 1943, also

I , spending about six months at

' '(..1'<1

the Anaconda, Mont., smelter.

‘ He‘ was the first miner hired —
in the Blackbird mine _near here"
.(-.._'On April 5, 1946. He was
givena thorough physical ex-,

amination then ‘and found “in
.perfect health. The Blackbird

I - .is owned and operatedyby the

?‘Howe Sound Mining Co.
“The mine was terribly dusty
.-and gassy,” says Harry. “I was
aliighball drift miner and the

‘  work was hard. I foundvmyself

losing strength about a~year

1 later and then‘ other symptoms
, began__t_o show up. -My ailment
gwas variously, diagnosed as ar-

thritis and a calcium" deficiency.

, But never as silicosis, despite
V severe pains in my lungs.

“It got too rough for me as

 time went on and in 1948 I quit
_and went to work in the Coeur

‘TM-M locals fig
MONTANAs~

d’A1enes at the the Spokane-
Idaho mine.

There it was dis-‘

covered that I had contracted.

silicosis. It was proved to

’everyone’s satisfaction that I

got the silicosis at the Black-
bird.”

’ WHAT CAUSED his illness?
Harry blames the company. In
an industry where men’s lives
are cheaper thaninew methods

_of production, the Howe Sound

company neglected to take ad-
vantage of the considerable re-
search on silicosis prevention,

.a.nd what mustfhave been al-

"most primitive -methods of min-

ing created the conditions for
silicosis, Harry’s disease.

The run-around -
It was at this point that Harry
began to get the typical run-
around experienced by the -vast
majority of silicosis victims; In
order to collect $750 severance
pay, Hicks was forced to agree
to a stipulation by the Idaho
Compensation Co. that he go to
Arizona for at least two years.

Asked to explain the stipula-.

tion, Harry says:
“It was a good excuse’to get

 Committee, representing Anaconda company employees
’x in four local unions, urged U. S. Senators James Murray

and‘Mike Mansfield to conduct “a last-ditch fight against
the Eisenhower~Brownell-Ferguson" thought—control

bills.”

The committee ‘members not only telegraphed the
two. senators, but took advantage of his presence in
Montana to meet. with Charles Murray, son and assistant '

of the veteran lawn1aker,'and
William Maloney, another Mur-
ray assistant. The two men
reached Senator Murray by
long-distance telephone to tell
him -of the Mine-Mill commit-
tee’s' concern over Republican
'announcements that they were
bringing the Brownell bills to
theysenate floor. Mur,ray
pledged to fight the bills.

. The telegram to Murray and
‘Mansfield, both Democrats, read‘
as follows: _ . ,/

that he was sorry but the com-

Too sick to whrk

The Hicks family did return,
on July 4, 1949, and there fol-

lowed a heartbreaking period

of job hunting by a ‘man that
‘everyone in the county knew
was too sick to work. Through
friends » he was able to go to

. work driving a truck for a year

for the county highway depart-
inent. He wore _,aAla1‘ge surgical
belt to alleviate the pa.in. Final-‘
ly, he grew too weak to continue

on the job and when he finally ’

collapsed, seriously ill, he was
rushed to a hospital. In addi-

tion‘ to his lung ailment, he was»

suffering from appendicitis. In
his critical condition, his lungs
‘werectoo weak to help him and
they'were burned by the ether.

‘HICKS HAS‘RECEIVED

government rehabilitation train- '

ing as’ a shoemaker, - but has
been forced to stop the training
because of ailing lunigs, heart,
and other complications.

At the present /time the Hicks
family_;is receiv‘5ing relief aid
from child welfare funds. They
used to get $233 a month in

child welfare and total disabil- A’

ity aid, but the latter was cut
off because some political hack
has marked Hicks’
“believed tobe able to do light
work.”

Domfool rumors

“Haven’t you heard‘ all those
damfool rumors about negotia-

. to looks intelligent.

“Gosh, Buster, the other day

. I was coming out of th'eVet’s

Club when California Charlie
stops "me and_asks ‘me’ did I hear
that the company offered us a

ten cent raise and the union‘

committee turned it down with-
out reportin’ it to the member-
ship._ I told Charlie-he ought to
be peddlin’ pencils instead of
rumors and I’m not .a block.
away when my insurance man"
stops me to say that he thinks
the miners ought to give up
their demand for a wage in-
crease because if they got it

prices would go up in town and
everybody would_suffer.

“After advisin’ him h.e’d bet-
ter take out some of his own
insurance if he's goin’ to risk
mayhem I get‘ home. and Eliza-

beth An’s blowin’ her stack‘

was tellin’ everyone in the gro-

cery-_ store that the company

wanted to go "back on the six-
day week but that the union re-
fused to agree to such a thing.f’
'l‘told her‘ ,  I .

“And,” says Elizabeth Ann
“I told her right between the

__ canned goods and the cookies.
‘that she ought to wear two

pieces, of bread for earrings be-

~ cause she. hadha. head like ‘a .

hamburger.”
.“And then,” continues Slim,

.“there’s- the rumor about the
company being too ’ strong for/~
the union, and the one _about the 

/".7

   

 

’Pullman«-. cars standing by . td
house the scabs, and the one

. about -the company shutting

down the mines if the union
gets. too tough. What kind of. a
rumor do you want, Buster? We
got ’em in all shapes and sizes.

“It’s not that I blame ._tho
company for trying to split the

. men; ‘that’s the onlyway it -can
— win. and I’m not_ one to steal the
~ _—bets of the opposing team just

before the game. But I do get
sore as hell when the company
insults my intelligence and the
intelligence of every miner ‘on
the hill. I see the bosses sittin'
there on the other side of the

can see the contemptthey have
