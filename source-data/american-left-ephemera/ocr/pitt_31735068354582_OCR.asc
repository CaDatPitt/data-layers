' DENVER -— “The one big job
facing our International Union
today is to make sure the Wage

. Stabilization Board grants quick

_ and complete approval of our
contract .gains.” This statement
by the four International officers
opened a campaign in which ev-
'_ery local, every member, is ex-
pected to take part. It is the cam-
=;-paign to complete our 1951 bar-
gaining program — to take home
in our pay checks the gains for.
_which we have struggled for
months.

Every member can help speed
the Board’s decision, can help
make sure the Board will not try
to chisel our agreements. Every
member can sign telegrams,
Write letters or postcards, help
develop support from other un-
ions and from thevcommunity.

In a letter to all local unions,
the Mine-Mill officers said:

“The job ahead is very clear. We
have to leave nothing undone to let
the Board feel our members’ determi-
nation to have what we are entitled to,
all of it, and without delay.

“There are t-wo p'hases to our
{BREAK-THE-WAGE-FREEZE activ-
ity. First, there is the immediate job
of getting approval for our agree-
ments. Second, there is our participa-
tion in a developing nation-wide drive
by many sections of the labor move-

with victory pact 1

BESSEMER, Ala.—After five and a
halfweeks on the picket lines, workers

V at the Alabama Metal Products Co.
3 here have emerged victorious with a

’ ‘fine: new contract.

_ The workers, who belong to Mine-
Mill Local 529, won a-general wage in-
crease of 10 cents an hour, six cents of

 

which is retroactive to last July 1._

'1_lnother’one cent an hour goes into
effect on January 1, 1952.

'3 In_ addition to the general wage in-
‘crease, there Were a number of reclas-

5 ments in the vacation clause and sev-
eral. other sections of the agreement.
The new contract calls for a union
Shop, the first to be negotiated in Dis-
trict 5 since the requirement for NLRB-
conducted shop elections was dropped

, by’Congress last summer. . -

 The settlement is hailed as a victory

‘by the strikers, for it is the culmina-

’ tion of a long struggle against division

.Wit-hin their ranks dating back to the

summer of 1950. An active picket line,

. under the strike leadership of Int’l rep.

Horace White, played an important
part in winning the strike.

. "Generous contributions from other

Mine-Mill locals" in the area provided

‘ ceries for the pickets, and the picket

j  Dnded than when it began. ' ~

ment to smash the wage freeze once
and for all.

“Every Mine—Mill local ilnion should
participate in the two campaigns from
beginning to end. Those locals which
do not have cases pending before the
Board at the present time will have
them later. Also, they will want to do
their share in the general drive to
abolish the wage freeze.”

THE OFFICERS suggested
that local union activity should
include the following:

1. Set up a BREAK-THE-WAGE?
FREEZE committee. ,

2.» Send letters, wires, resolu-
tions, postcards, to the ~ Wage

of War Mobilization, and the Di-
rector of Economic Stabilization.

Coeur d’Alene negotiators
race to beat T-H deadline

KELLOGG, Idaho (Friday, Nov. 16)
-—Mine-Mill’s district-wide negotiating

team was still deep in bargaining

meetings with Cour d’Alene operators
as a new Taft-Hartley deadline drew
closer.

Both the union and the operators
have been notified that if a settlement
has not been reached by Tuesday, No-
vember 20, a secret vote "of all the
workers in the district «would have to
be taken on the operators’ “last offer.”
This is a requirement under the com-
plicated machinery set up for carrying
out Taft-Hartley injunction. -

Since the injunction will expire auto-
matically on November 20 -- eighty
days after it was 'issued—the Board
must conduct the vote before then if -

a settlement has not been reached.iRe-*
sults of the vote would then be com-
municated to the President.

However, both sides were pushing

negotiations as hard as possible in the U

hope of reaching a settlement before
the deadline.

There were still two outstanding is-
sues in dispute. One was the union’s de-
mand that all the operators in the dis-
trict accept a pension plan along the
lines of the one already negotiated
with Bunker Hill.

The second dispute was over the is-
sue of applying all wage and reclassi-
fication increases to the contract min-
ers—a practice which is now standard
throughout the non-ferrous metals in-

dustry else where in the country.‘

It is expected that all new con-

have been filed with the WSB
sometime this week. Communica-

. > By John Clark * _
Another CIO Convention has come and gone. And with every year

that passes, the decay cuts deeper, spreads further. It become) harder

and harder to hide the bankruptcy and corruption_. -
Just so, it becomes more and more clear that we were right, and
they.-the men in the top CIO leadership who demanded our‘expul-

sion—were wrong.

signed the economic documents that were used last
winter as thebasis for the wage freeze‘ are now
bitterly regretting it. CIO president Philip Murray
tells the convention that wage stabilization is ‘a

Where is the freedom we so proudly boast about,
the freedom of collective bargaining?” .
. Where indeed, Mr. Murray? And where were
‘you last winter when the wage freeze fraud was
‘ ,, . . V perpetuated on the workers of America? Where but
in the White House, hob-nobbing importantly with the President and
chattering foolishly about “equality of sacrifce.” '

You have only the rank and file workers, in your own union and
in unions like Mine-Mill, to thank for the fact that U. S. labor still has
a fighting chance to bargain with employers at all. But nothing you
said" at the CIO Convention shows you are prepared to grasp that fight-
ing chance and depart from the path of compromise and sellout you
have trod these last years.

CIO, says Murray pleadingly to the delegates, “must not become a
club of aging, pot-bellied, bald-headed old men.” This comes the day
after the delegates have listened to Mike DiSalle, director of price
stabilization, lecture them on the wonders of price control while they
munch contentedly over a $15—a-plate dinner}. Then they belch their
applause at DiSalle’s warning that wage increases shouldn’t be based
on the strengthcor weakness of a union or on the ability of an industry
to pay. Nobody thinks of asking “Roly-Poly Mike” just what they
should be based on. '

1

III

IT WAS THE BANKRUPTCY of leadership that stood out per-
haps more sharply than at any CIO gathering in recent years. Murray

at at ‘

is aging, and ill, and does want to quit as CIO president._ But after

months of negotiation and backroom bicke_ring, it was clear by con-
vention time that there is no one. to succeed him. . '

So the convention accepted without protest the lame device of
reelecting Murray and creating a new office—Exe¢;utive Vicei"Presi_-
dent—with Allen Haywood in the post to take over some of the
dutiesof president. T I

This is the same Haywood who made a long speech about the.
glorious “organizing” victories of C10 in the past year——which add_ed

. up to a few raids against small independent unions. Not a single fresh

industry entered for organizing was mentioned. One has the impres-

sion of a carrion crow picking over dried-out, marrowless bones.

Now, however, there is a studied effort to detour around any claim

- of “organizing” victories against the larger independents—the unions

like Mine-Mill,  and ‘the Longshoremen. The defeats of the CIO

raiders must sting. , ’
:1: It 4:-_

HOW RIGHT WE WERE! Again, the Marshall=PlanV comes up.

Jacob Potofsky, president of the Clothing Workers, admits sadly that

Marshall Plan billions have gone directly to the industrialists, while

the living standards of European workers have gone steadily lower,

and that the militant progressive unions of France and Italy are
stronger than ever. ’ ‘ . * ‘

Saul Stettin of the Textile Workers, who represented CIO at the

-“scab International” meeting in Milan this spring, also rises to speak

about the workers of Marshallized Europe, saying: “They ask. for
bread" and we give them_a. stone—or a speech——or a« slogan.” All Mine-
-Mill ever asked, in 1947 or ’48 or ’49, was that we give them bread,
forget the'sloga.ns—and leave the guns home. V _
Even Walter Reuther, the Auto Workers president, rose to assail
President Truman for his sellout of the fair deal. Reuther forgets that
he led the pack which bayed at the heels of Mine-Mill in 1948 for in-
a sordid
deal to support either Truman or Dewey. ' -

So Reuther, angry, frustrated, boxed-in, ‘tells the CIO Convention’

what we have been saying all along, that a reactionary Congress is

i not a big ‘enough excuse to cover Trur_nan’s. responsibility forhanding -
‘ the defense program overto Big Business, for packing the U. S. Su-

preme Court with his anti-labor, anti-Negro, anti-everything cronies,
form-setting up the outrageous star chamber “loyalty” looards and g-iv.
ing them thb green light. T  '

Yet Reuther, with all his “deals” with the Democratic Party, with

avail his huge membership concentrated in the auto capital of the World,

cannot even boast that he has ever elected a mayor in Detroit.

Who said it”
“The strike (of East Coast
\ - -longshoremen) brings out the
‘ character of a war economy.
Modern civilization proceeds at V
the cost of freedom and tends
toward a fascist organization.. . .
In K a capitalist economy, the
common good is identified with
the preservation of private prop-
erty and employers’ rights. When V .
the longshoremen strike, the em- ‘
players are not accused" of sub- .
version for not having paid 
enough wages . . . The villian
is automatically the worker who
asserts his right‘. The entire”
weight of law and public opinion
is mobilized against the striker.

1 - At the same time, the produc- ‘
tiveness of capital becomes
identified ‘with’ the common
good .’ . . 

‘In short, the mobilization of-
an economy for war is a reac-
tionary social force. It entrench- '
es capital and prevents labor
from securing its rights. It
arms the government with -ar-
bitrary power and identifies the»
good of the nation with, that of
the employer. The executive,

set for a new contract which calls
for improvements totalling 201/2 cents

The same is true

 

We were told immediately that the situation was not encouraging

and probably would get worse in the next 5 or 6 months. But it was
evident that this problem of unemployment did not "only apply to our.
shops but to small shops everywhere, regardless of union affiliation.
It is also true in some of the large manufacturing corporations, as wit-
ness the growing unemployment in the Detroit area in the automobile

The reasons? Many. But heading the list is greed for profit and
the desire on the part of big corporations to corner all the contracts.
There is no price _ceiling on copper, lead and zinc in foreign countries.
American metalcorporations with foreign holdings are sending 20%,
and more of their production’ to foreign countries where they are get-
ting’ two and three times the American price per pound. It is generally
estimated‘ that the amount of American-controlled metal going to for-
eign countries is about the same as the amount that is causing a short-

, In addition, the amount of concentration of contracts in the hands .
of big corporations far exceeds that of World War II.

NPA DID NOT TELL US THIS, of course. But it is obvious that
the pressure, not only from the workers but also from small business

itself, is growing.

As a result, the NPA next month is setting up in every major
industrial area “Clinics.” If your boss has no metal and therefore no
orders, he is supposed to bring the problem -to the ‘“Clinic._” There his
manpower and plant facilities will be examined and an attempt made

to get him metal, prime contracts or sub-contracts, whatever the case

We don’t think it is a solution nor even a step" in the right direc-

Nevertheless, we feel that these “Clinics" should be utilized if
you have unemployment problems in your shop. They can be used as a
means of pressuring and focusing attention on many of the problems
in unemployment we now’face.'Here in Washington, we will be more
than glad to follow up for you any visits you may have with one of the
NPA “Clinics” in your area. '  '

RECENTLY THE WSB appointed. a tripartite commission to
make recommendations to the Board itself of the wage -problems of
the Tool and Die workers. The public as well as the labor members
voted a majority report which set area standards for these skilled
workers. It would have given, salthough in-a limited way, a chance for
the lower paid Tool and Die workers‘ to get their rates up to the high-
est area rates. But industry members on the commission dissented and
when the matter came to WSB itself, the public members voted with
industry and knocked down the report.

The position now is that for Tool and Die skilled ‘workers, teach‘
case will be decided on its own merits within the present Board _policies.

Not only will this retard labor, but it will be devastating upon
small companies who will not be able to keep their skilled workers,
in view of the present shortage of Tool and Die workers everywhere.

_ The same situation seems to be developing on Health, ‘Welfare and
Pensions. A fairly good report came from the labor and public members
of the commission, but we understand that the main Board again is
wrangling on this question, with industry fighting tooth‘ andf-nail. It is
possible that the public members will again be influenced. ,  ' '

The true nature of the WSB becomes more'clear./ It is more than
' Sust a so-called “hold the line” agency, It is an employers’ Board.

By Harvey O'Connor

NEW YORK (FP) —— CIO as it
ended its 13th convention at the Hotel
Commodore found itself up against
dead ends at every turn of the road.
Nowhere was the dead end more
painfully apparent than in leadership
itself. Phil Murray, aging, ill and
burdened with the problems of the
, United Steelworkers which he also
heads, wants to retire as president of
CIO. But all efforts to find a suitable
successor have run up against a dead
end. There is no one in CIO with the
platform personality, the magnetism
and /the backing of the Big.Three
unions —-‘steel, auto and clothing —-
to fill the office. After conceding the
futility of the search for a successor,
the CIO inner council compromised by
' relieving Murray ‘of routine duties and

transferring them to Allan S. Hay-
wood, also an old coal miner.
Although CIO claims it was never
stronger numerically than now, its
leaders admit it has reached a dead
end in organizing. They blame it on
Taft-Hartley, the convenient scapegoat
for labor’s failures. But Haywood, di-
rector of organization, indicated the
dead end'when,he' pointed to CIO’s
main victories in that field in the past
year -—- all representing raids on or-
ganized workers of other unions.

AT A TIME of full employment’

when organizing should be relatively
easy, the leaders admit that not only
are two-thirds “of the American work-
ing class unorganized, but there is no
immediate prospect of making much
headway in correcting the situation.
With Taft-Hartley blamed for this

impasse, there is obviously no need.

for the leaders to reexamine their own
policies which have blunted the ap-
peal CIO once had for the unorgan-
ized millions. ' '

CIO’s political dead end is perhaps‘

the most immediately obvious of all.
Here top leadership is divided on the
all-important question of supporting

\ The escalator falls behind

A breakdown of figures on wage
gains‘ made by members of the CIO
United Auto Workers as a result of
Walter Reuther’s' “escalator clause”
last week showed they are coming out

-on the short end of the stick.

The first “escalator clause” was ne-
gotiated by Reuther for all workers in
General Motors in May, 1948. That
contract was for two years; when it
expired in 1950, Reuther negotiated

\an6ther escalator.for five years! So
 GM workers have been under an “esca-
lator” now for 3’/; years. .

That escalator has brought them

- seven wage increases and three wage

  Silver call

Push ‘peaeenboml’ i

   light in E2 strike

.BAYARD, N. M.—A partial victory
has been won by Mine-Mill Local 890
here in _the long fight against peace
bonds, which the local sheriff and dis-

vrtrict attorney have been using_ as a
\veap_.on . against Empire Zinc strikers
andtheirvwives. _ - .

,The- victory came in the’ case ‘of
Vicente Becerra, who was released
from the Silver City jail after 20 days
‘for; failure. to post a “peace bond” set
at $500. ‘ Justice of the Peace Andrew

I Haugland reduced the bail to‘ $250 and

jr_e_leased.Becerra after the union's. at-
_torn_ey- had filed a motion indicating
the case would be appealed to a
higher court. " . .

The release of Becerra cleared. the

peace bond fight will be carried to the
‘ Supreme Court of New Mexico, if nec-
essary," declared Int’l rep. Clinton
Jencks. “It is a violation of our Ameri-

can -constitution.” ‘

H Meantime, District 2 board member
C. D. Smothermon disclosed that a.
.government agency is_ investigating

charges that Empire Zinc failed to‘

lproperly reinstate veterans to their
‘rightful jobs from 1943 through 1950.
 Smothermon pointed to the federal
laws passed in recent years to protect

' ff ‘the returning serviceman against loss
1 4 of his job, or being forced to take a-

job_,ginfe1'ior to the one to which he
would have advanced by senior-ity,.had,

' -he not been taken into the armed
_forces. -

“There appears to be ample evidence

. -fthat Empire Zinc placed "several vets
l‘.‘..‘.-,y~.who ‘asked ‘for re-employment, on jobs
V ‘inferior to those they held before going

into service,” Smothermon said. The
government ‘agency conducting the in‘-
: vestigationfis the U. S. Department of

cuts—for a net gain of‘23 cents. And
only 5 cents of the “escalator” gains
have actually been added to the base
wage rates in such a way that they can
never be taken away.

COMPARE THIS tothe total of 43
cents in wage gains made by the vast
majority of workers belonging to Mine-
 ‘! I

Reuther would argue that you ‘also
have to add the wage increases that
GM workers have gotten as a result
of the “annual improvement factor” in
their contract. But Reuther is careful
not to mention that the “improvement
factor” was given the GM workers

in exchange for a promise from UAW.

to back any and all company-sponsored
speedup plans to the hilt. And’ GM
workers have ‘paid dearly for their piti-
ful 14 cents in “improvement factor”
raises in the last 3 years. I

But even if you include the “speed-
up” wage gains of 14 cents, GM work-
ers still have increased their wages
only 37 cents in this 3'/;.year period,
as compared with the 43 cents in gains
made by Mine-Mill!

The answer, of course, is that there
is no substitute for-genuine collective
bargaining by a militant, unified, hard-
hitting union. Gimmicks like the esca-
lator don’t solve problems for the
worker; they just hem him in with
ironclad restrictions.

  
  

 

President Truman. The United Auto
.Workers leadership, as voiced, by

president Walter Reuther and secre-‘

tary-treasurer Emil Mazey, assailed
Truman savagely throughout the con-
- vention for his “feeble” and “inept”
efforts todmake good on the fair deal.
In his" concluding speech to the con-
vention, Murray defended his loyalty
to Truman. Now, he ‘ said, labor is
represented on the top advisory boards
in Washington and has access to Tru-
man at any time. But his scathing
comments . on other aspects of the
Washington scene indicated that labor
has littleto show for its representation
except that it can protest in the high-
est circles against what the monopoly
crowdiis doing to the American peo-
ple. _‘ , 4 _ , . _
SPLIT AMONG THEMSELVES and
burdened with Truman, CIO leaders
find it impossible to get PAC to
clicking among the rank-and-file." Typi-

cal is the story of one official who ’

took over the job of selling PAC‘ $1
cards to his members when his staff
had failed completely. He failed, too.
Then he threw away the, PAC cards
and got receipt books from a pro-
union congressman CIO was support-

° ing. He sold 137 -$1 slips "to the same

men who had turned- him down on
PAC.. ‘

CIO may hot have reached the dead
end of its anti-communist crusade, but

A it did reach an alltime high in absurd-

ity when the president of the railroad
trainmen, a gyest speaker, related V
how he had received an invitation from
the Romanian railroad workers union

to visit their country. This he was able ‘

to turn into a sinister plot to lure
him behind the ‘ iron curtain to be
“duped” and ‘fdrugged” so he might
return to this country to sabotage
the U.S. railroad system by strikes,
dynamite and violence. The press table
guffawed at this exhibition, staged
with the help of a professional New
York publicity firm. But the ‘Hearst
and McCormick papers gave this yarn
the biggest play of any story -from
the convention. '
While there were ‘ no Communists
in the convention, communism itself
was present in nearly every speech
‘from’ the platform and in nearly every
resolution; At times it seemed that the
subject matter of resolutions might
defy an effort to‘ tie it in with com-
munism, but- this was nevertheless
achieved. Some sharp anti-communist.
strategists, eyeing the growing indif-
ference of, delegates to this line, ex-
pressed the fear that too continued use
of massive doses of anti-communism,
as with penicillin, may build up an
immunity to the drug. .
MORE SERIOUS to CIO is the ab-
sence now from its lower ranks of
thousands of younger leaders who once
spearheaded the drives that ~made
CIO the terror of reaction. Now they

Bonanza gushes during
Wilson's ‘moratorium’

‘ WASHINGTON (FP) - A/survey; ’

last week revealed that the 60-day
“moratorium” issued’Aug. 18 by mob-
ilization director Charles Wilson, ad-
vertised as a halt to_ huge. handouts
for big business through speeded tax

, amortization, actually was followed by _
5 the biggest splurge of bonanzas yet. ‘

In the 60 days it was supposed to_
be holding back on the big gifts be-
cause of aroused public opinion, the
Defense Production Administration ac-
tually certified 1,483 construction pro-
jects of big corporations to be paid
for by the taxpaying public. This was

35% of all certificates issued since‘ *' ‘ ‘

the ‘program got underway last year
and the biggest number ever issued

during a comparable period.

The survey also revealed an.aston-
ishing rush by DPA officials, most of

whom are representatives of big busi- A

ness, to beat a deadline on amortiza-

’ tion certificates for their former boss-

es. They were in such a hurry they
issued many of the certificates on a

' ““blank check” basiswithout waiting

to figure out how much of the tax-
payers money was involved.

Latest batch of certificates totaled
456 and DPA said this brought the
total of money involved to $9.6 bil-,.

the big batch that "had been processed .

without dollar signs and 'Washington

From Vol. II, No. 11, Mine'r’s Magazine

No'vem.be7', 1901. This was the offi- '

cial publication of the Western Fed-
eration of Miners, predecessor’ of
Mine-Mill. '

The lockout at Northport, Wash,
and the strike at Rossland, B. C., have»
for the time being, become matters
.for the courts at Rossland. The mem- .
bers of the union -were successful in
securing the conviction of Geiser, the
contractor, for importing alien labor;
they also‘demanded of the Canadian
government immediate recognition of
the fact that the laws were being" daily .
violated by importations of men, and
that as the government did not take
action it devolved liipon the workmen
to protect their -own rights.

Aside» from this the individual
workers have sued the companies in
sums amounting to nearly a quarter
of million dollars. On the other hand,

the companies at Rossland are appeal-
ing to the supreme court for injunc-
tions so sweeping that, if granted, will
prevent a union man from taking a
full breath within a radius of twenty
miles of a company office andfrom
even looking in the direction of the
mines. ‘

In the face of these things the
Union is solid as adrock, not a man has
deserted the ranks, and they‘ say they
intend to fight to a finish if it costs .
every dollar in the treasury; they

will then put up their hall and-/'

hold meetings in the open. Men of
the indomitable pluck of the Rossland
Union members deserve and will re-
ceive the hearty support of the en-
tire Federation.

Northport presents features very‘
similar to those existing at Rossland,
excepting that the injunction has been
issued at Northport. It does not seem

. to have the desired effect, however,

for while the company has\been suc-

_ cessful in securing scabs from the

culture established for the growth of
these microbes, you can imagine the
disappointment of the company when,
out of a ‘batch of 62, as they sup-
posed, just_the miserable kind of coy-
otes they wanted, there proved to be
49 honest, upright men who would not

Mine-Mill-UE Sxurveiy g

blasts Canadian index

TORONTO, Ont. —(A sensational
study just released by two of the lead-_
ing unions in Canada — one of them
Mine-Mill — reveals that the "Canadian
government’s official cost-of-living in-
dex is actually .421/2 per cent below
the real increase since 1939.

While the living standards of wage_

and salaried workers in Canada have '

actually gone down 10 per cent since
1939, the Bureau of Dominion Statis-
tics claims they have risen, according
to the carefully-documented study
made jointly by Mine-Mill and the
United Electrical Radio &_ _Machine
Workers (UE). ' .

About 60 per- cent of the “error”
in the DBS index is explained by its
failure to measure the actual increases
in, prices of food, clothing and hous-
ing. Another 30 per cent is accounted
for in the ‘failure to take account of
increased taxation. ‘

THE STUDY isipatterned’ closely
after criticisms made last spring by‘
UE and virtually the entire U. S.
labor movement against~the Bureau of
Labor Statistics fraudulent "“cost-of-y
living” index. ' -

. Mine.-Mill and UE called on all Ca-
nadian organizations to “demand full-*6
scale publiohearings and enquiry into
the present cost-of-living index” of the

DBS. While the DBS “All-Canada In-- ,
. dex” asserts that living costs have

risen only 89.8 points since‘ 1939, the
Mine-Mill-UE study shows they have
actually’ jumped 156.2 points.

The Mine-Mill-UE.report shows that
each point of “understatement.” in the
official Canadian index represents a

’loss of $61,500,000 a year in real

earnings. to. wage and salaried workers
in Canada. The total distortion of the
DBS index means‘ an understatement
cost-of-living expendi-
tures amounting to about. $945 _a year_
for a typical Canadian worker’s ‘fam-
ily. 

A STATEMENT released by the two
unions along with the results of the
joint survey charged “that the pre-
sent deficiencies in’ the DBS index
help the government to hide the full .
effect of the ‘guns not butter’ policy

' so frequently enunciated by Ottawa.

officials and ' this‘helps to blunt the
struggle of the workers for decent and
rising living standards in this land

’ of ._ plenty.” .

Tables released with the joint study
show that while the DBS index “is
published and used -as a ‘cost-of-living’
index, it is, in fact,‘not a real index
of changing. living cost at" all. It is
basically an index of changes in price

and nothing else, and even there does

not measure the full impact ._of price

tion in’ 'quality.,'— ‘ ‘ - * 5' ' v" '

such as the higher rents charged for

have to rent when the older houses

are not available, or the costs_ of
extra transportation when workers are
forced to live at greater distances
from their place of Work. It does not
allow at all for the increased burden
of direct taxes that a worker’s fam-
ily has to provide for.” ’

House subcommittee
Whitewashes BLS
living cost index‘
WASHINGTON — The long-awaited

report of the house labor subcommittee
which has been probing the accuracy

of the Bureau‘ of Labor Statistics con- .

sumer price index, has finally‘ been‘
issued. And it’s' a whitewash of the
fraudulent “cost-of-living‘ index,"
against which the entire labor move-
"ment testified during the hearings.
The committee’s report was prepared
in close collaboration with the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, and was interpreted
as another step in the united front of

legislative and executive branches ‘of-

gbvernment with big business to head
off another round of wage increases.

In effect, the .report gave the bless- I

ing of Congress to the Index, even
though the hearings exposed it"
thoroughly as a highly distorted fraud,
which tries to prove that prices have
not gone up a fraction as high as they
actually have. V .. ’

THE COMMITTEE rejected the re-

_ quest of all labor witnesses that taxes

be included as a part of the cost of liv-
ing. This was .done despite the state-
ment by MaxD. Kossoris,’ western re-'
gional director of BLS, who said last
month that taxes emphatically do con-
stitute an important element in the
cost of living. . ’

The subcommittee" saidathe BLS is a 1

“fine index” and should be supported

by Congress as». fixed. charge againt~..,

the -government-. It‘ pointed to accept-
ance of the index in contracts govern-
ing at least three million "workers as
proof that it is acceptable to labor.

Along with BLS, the subcommittee
admitted the index is not a measure of

._the cost of -living and fails to record

' increases in the American standard of

‘living. Its only solution wasffor the»
W BLS to conduct" periodic studies ' of 

workers’ lbudgets but it ' insisted ‘this

- The Truman Administration has “a

terrible labor record,” says the AFL
Building Trades Council.

The Council, representing more than
half the total AFL membership, has

. issued an 8—page bulletin analyzing Tru-

man’s record. One conclusion was that
the President has never really opposed

I ‘the Taft—Hart1ey law nor tried to get it

repealed.

The United Mine Workers Journal is
even more specific. In an editorial, the
Journal said: ' i

“. . . repeal of the NAM-T-H law
was not being pushed by the Admini-_
stration . . . like the prohibition issue,
it constituted aolive vote-getting appeal
"which could be stretched out for a
number of years.

“It appears to us,that the Adminis-
tration has played the game just that
way. . . .

“None of the basic provisions (of
T—H) that hog—tie labor unions to a
regimented status are likely to be
repealed in a ‘pecking’ amending pro-

’ cedure. . . .

. _“We hope that all American trade
unions will recognize that the political
fight which must be won to secure
repeal of the NAM-T-H law lies in the
election of favorable senators and con-
gressmen. -

“Certainly, by now, labor should

have learned that presidential prom- A

ises do not repeal anti-labor laws.”
IWE COULD ADD to the Journal’s

warning that there will be no “favor-\

able” senators and congressmen to vote

. for on any ticket, except to the extent

that -unions,’ joining with whatever

A -allies they’ can find, become a force
. during the next six months in the selec-
. tion of candidates.

The answer of the Building Trades
Council—vote Republican to teach the
Democrats a lesson—is no solution at

-all. That "would be jumping from the .

frying pan into the fire.
_'Only independent political action,
starting with selection of candidates in

 the primaries, can make the voice of

labor effective in the '52 elections.
VOtherwise, the bosses will go right

In ahead playing their old shell game—-

FANCY SPEECHES

Steelworkers ran a fancy “Seminar

State College. There were college
profs, agendas, speeches, for three

- days. But no program of action.

Next time Murray’s boys get to-
gether on “human relations,” we sug-
gest a one-point agenda—“Why did the
CIO Southern Organizing Drive fail?”

“How do you settle grievances at

TCI?”
HERO

Big pitch in the pre-convention issue
of the CIO News was a build—up of
Phil Murray for his plan to end raid-
ing of one CIO unionuby another. (The
plan would not return raided local
unions where they belong, nor would
it try _to stop raiding of other unions
by CIO.) Murray has a “statesman-
like approach,” says CIO News; the
plan is a “major event” of labor his-
tory.” ,

This is worth a weak smile. Raiding
is as low a form .of,,union-busting as
scabbing on a strike. A guy who wants

. to stop raiding within his own federa-

tion is about as ‘much of a hero as the
one who stops beating his wife.

Let’s put up a‘ statue of Murray, the’
man with a plan to_ make CIO unions
swear off raiding each other. And
alongside it, let’s set up another for
Joe Zilch, the gent who says he has
sworn off scabbing. A

When some 2,00l) bosses got together
last month in Los Angeles for the
American Mining Congress, one of the
was ' Sen. Pat McCarran
(Dem., Nev.). He asked permission of

..

the mining bosses to introduce a bill ‘

into Congress. It was a bill to give

everyone the right to own gold, to im-

port it and export it freely. -
McCarran said: “I_ suggest, and am

‘prepared to put this in the form of a

bill to be introduced into the legisla-
ture IF IT- MEETS WITH "THE
JUDGMENT OF THIS MINING
CONGRES .” .

Here is a question for Sen. McCar-
ran: What group of bosses gave you
instructions to introduce'your union-
busting McCarran act into the Con-
gress of the United States?,. ‘

MacArthur gets cold shoulder

from Seattle labor movement

SEATTLE (FP)—For the first time
since Pres. Woodrow Wilson was given
the “silent treatment” in Seattle 33
years ago, a prominent national politi-
cal figure was given the cold shoulder.
by organized labor when Gen. Douglas
MacArthur opened the year-long anni-
versary of the city’s centennial. _

Not among those greeting the for-
mer Far Eastern 5-star chieftan were
the tens of thousands of members. of
CIO and AFL in Seattle. Local coun-
cils of both labor groups issued scorch-
ing statements deploring the mixture
of MacArthur’s peculiar ideas with Se-
attle's centennial. -

Rep. Hugh Mitchell (D, Wash.) re-
fused to climb the same platform with
MacArthur because of theinjection of
“partisan politics” into what was a
community celebration. The head of
the Associated Students of the Uni-
versity of Washington, where the gen-

‘ eral spoke, implored him to skip‘the
. politics in his address.

NOTHING LIKE the cool reception
given MacArthur hasbeen seen in this

then the world’s timber capital.

s Trail local fights
I discharges. pay cuts
TRAIL, B. C.-Mine-Mill ‘Local 480

here is acting-' quickly to protect the_

rights of two shop stewards who have‘
been unjustly and illegally fired, and
14 others who have been “docked” for
protesting against an unexplained pay
cut. 9 ‘
The two leading shop stewards fired
were Sarge Walsh and -Pete Jensen,
both of whom have been especially

' militant and active in processing the

grieyances of the men. Their dismissal
by the company was clearly intended
as an attempt to weaken the Local 480
grievance committee. .

The 14 men who were sent home for
a one-day layoff had gone to the com-

pany’s general office to ask about a‘

cut in pay which they didn’t know
about until they got their pay enve-‘
lopes. They were‘ told that they could
not get a hearing on their protest—a-nd
then they /were sent home with what
amounted to another cut in pay.

A special meeting of the entire Local‘

union membership was called last week
to plan steps to fight back against this
attempt by the company to undermine
the union at CM&S. -

Union gives coast s
housewives tuna bargain

LOS ANGELES (FP)—Two fisher-
men’s locals are in the business of mar-
keting fresh tuna here in such a big
way they already have more than 20
retail outlets—and that’s no fish story.

Locals 33 and 34, Int]. Longshoreo
men’s & Warehousemen’s Union de-
cided to takeithings into their own
hands when the canneries in this tuna
center started importing the fish from
Japan at prices that would leave the
union fishermen eating beans.

Those prices “won’t even pay for the
oil or -gas used in American boats,”

said Fishermen’s Union secretary Jeff ‘

Kibre.
That was when the union decided to
set up a single experimental retail out-

' let and sell their catch at 25 cents a

pound, way under the figure at which
the canneries were selling their Japa-
nese imports. The -fish market with
the union label on it was virtually
snowed under by bargain-hunting, in-
flation-hit housewives.

scab International B

WASHINGTON-—United Mine work;  - . "
ers delegates to international confer-
ences in Europe have reported --to the
UMW executive board that the Mar-I  '
shall plan ‘has aided the wealthy and V

The delegates also reported that the
Intl.”'Confederation of Free Trade
Unions relies too much on actions of-
governments. Speaking of the trend .
of thinking at the Milan conference of ~
ICFTU in July, the delegates reported:

“It was apparent that the trend of
thinking at"th’e conference was that ‘

essary to relieve the sad economic situ-
ation as affecting the workers in many
nations. The governments of many na-
tions have not been sympathetic in the
least with the status of the workers
and we made it clear that we do not

and could not rely upon such govern-
mental action; that what such a gov-
ernment could give it could also take
away. We urged aggressive action to
organize the workers into strong labor
unions, also urged justice and fair play.

“The ICFTU congress enunciates the
principle of free democratic trade.
unions but apparently they are not now
prepared to put such principles into
practice. We regret that we’ arenot
able to make a more favorable report.”

On the subject of the Marshall plan
it said; “The Marshall.plan was both
praised and condemned and from infor- 3
mation we gathered, the upper ‘classes ‘, = "
in many countries were artful tax -
dodgers and they benefited more from«
the application of the Marshall plan,
than any other group.”

The delegates’ report led observers . V
here to believe the Mine Workers Union ~ ‘
was preparing to withdraw its affilia-.
tion with the 'ICTFU, which is described
among trade unionists in Europe as the *
“scab International.” "

New proof of how the nation’s house-

There is, for example, the fact that‘

‘O Retailers may advertise meat as

of a higher grade and use such terms

“U.S. inspected,” in such a way as to‘
give the impression that this is equal
to U.S. graded meats.

O Retailers may coin names for cats

O Sausage and processed meats may

be adulterated by using. lungs, tripe-
_ and illegal amounts of cereal.

This solution “seems to have a, cer- ‘V

pointed out: “Inspection of meat price
quotations, as published by the Bureair
of Labor Statistics over the past year,
tells an interesting story. These quo-J
tatidns show that, ~ percentage-wise, .
hamburger has increased in price con-
siderably more than aeak, and salt
pork more than bacon. ‘Clearly, ‘this.

call “cheaper cuts" actually are.
