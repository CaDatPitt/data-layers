essential that our nation be friends with these nations and not enemies. But they
cannot be wholly our friends if within our own people we are divided by prejudice,
one group against another.

You see how important you have become. You are no longer a minority group
in one nation. You have become the touchstone of democracy in our own country
and in the world.

For America has long been in a sense the land of dream for many peoples.
Many Indians, today hoping for freedom, look at this moment to our country. Will
America really stand for freedom for all? Do the four freedoms apply to an Indian
in India? He does not know—but he hopes. And Chinese boys ﬁghting so bravely
and long against the bitter enemy, they look to America. Will America help the
Chinese, as they are helping the English? And after the war is over, will Americans g
give to Chinese an equal place, the place they deserve in the world? China does .
not know.

These are the two countries who have suffered most heavily from the race preju-
dice of the white man. And yet why do I not speak of the millions in Java and the
south seas, and in the Philippines and in Africa, and the Arabs? They look to 
America, who has never wanted an empire, who fought a war for freedom from an
empire, and fought another war to free her own slaves—surely America will be on
their side ?

Yet who dares to promise them that we will be? I dare not. Today it is my ,
greatest shame that when one of these peoples puts the question to me, will America
give us real equality of treatment after this war, I can only say, I don’t know.

And the reason I don’t know, that I dare not promise, that I am not sure of the
righteousness of my own people in the world, is because of this miserable race preju-
dice at home which denies equality to a dark skin. I cannot hope that a dark skin
in India or in China will have what we have not given our own.

You see how important American democracy has become, democracy, which is
not democracy unless it grows out of human equality. You understand that there
are millions of people in the world who are losing hope. For if America, the great,
the good, treats its dark citizens less kindly than its white, what hope have they?

What is left for them to do except to prepare themselves for War and ﬁght for
themselves?

Well, one may say, let this be so. The white man has had his day, and now let
the colored man have his.

To which I can only say that freedom and equality are the precious things and
that these will still be lost. It does not matter, from the viewpoint of aeons of history
which is uppermost, colored or white. But it matters to the very bottom of life
whether or not the trend of our hope is toward freedom and equality or away from
it. I do not care whether colored or white rules-—in a ruler it is only the individual
that matters, if there is not to be freedom anyway. Between a kindly colored ruler
and an unkind white one, I should choose the kind man for my own life. But which-
ever it was, would make no fundamental difference to the world, if there were not to 3
be the freedom of human equality, if ruler and subject were to be the relationship
between individuals.

But today we have not reached that point. We are in the midst of struggle, in
the hour of change, when by determined and unwearying action for freedom we can ,
still shape the world toward freedom. VVe ought so to act that all we do is designed 5
to break down that which denies equality and forbids freedom. !

Therefore you are to be congratulated. You have come to your majority at a ‘
time in history when more than ever before all effort for freedom can count. You
are trained, intelligent and ready to work. You are citizens in a country which still

 

it ? allows free speech and individual effort. But most important of all and here is your

greatest advantage, you belong to a group which more than any in the world knows
what race prejudice is, and how even political freedom cannot do away with it, and
you know that it must be done away if democracy is to prevail. The white citizens
of this country in their general ignorance cannot realize as clearly as you do how
our nation is threatened by our inner division, and what it means to the world if we
do not achieve democracy. But you can realize it, you know what it does in your
"own lives, in your own minds and wills and characters.

 

 

 

11

You have a peculiar responsibility then, born Americans, trained and taught as
you have been, free to live as Americans in a country pledged to freedom and at this
moment ﬁghting for freedom in the world.

And you have a great gift within yourselves. As I have come to know colored
Americans, I discern in them, generally a kind of character which few white people
have. It is not a racial distinction, for I do not believe that character has much to
do with race. I do believe, however, that it has a great deal to do with circumstance
of life. People who have suffered, people who have had to live with an inescapable
trouble, with a permanent handicap of some sort, develop either a corroding bitter-
ness, or a deep, wise philosophical outlook on life. It is to the great credit of colored
Americans that most of them have not grown bitter, but have brought their rich
sense of humor and their natural wisdom to bear upon the circumstances which have
surrounded them, so that today I say with complete truth that I ﬁnd more maturity
of spirit among the colored people in this country than among any others. I am used
to that maturity, for the Chinese, being so wise and old a people, have the same matur-
ity and to superlative degree. In this regard you are better ﬁtted to establish close
relationships with such people as the Chinese and the Indians than any other Ameri-
cans. Life has taught you something,—it was something which your ancestors had
to learn and which they passed on from generation to generation and today you have
it as your spiritual possession, and a priceless possession it is—wisdom of the soul.

You are therefore in a superior position in the world today. You are in a
superior position in America——it is not you who bear the stigma of not practicing
democracy. You have now the advantage over the white man. You can be free from
hypocrisy.

Do not for one moment therefore accept the status which race prejudice puts
upon you. Consider what you can do best and do it, determined never to yield to
undemocratic behavior and prejudice which denies all that America means. You
belong here in America—you have a purpose to fulﬁll in this country, and I am
grateful today that the people of our country are of more races than one. It gives
us this matchless opportunity of working out upon our own soil the world problems
of equality and of cooperation between different peoples. Do not yield to discourage-
ment or to hopelessness and do not expect an easy life or seek a sheltered one. The
Times are demanding now that everyone of you thinks not of yourself or of your
own race and group life, but of the life of the nation as a whole. All that we have
done for democracy in our history will have been lost, if we do not achieve democ-
racy now.

Do not yield then for one moment to anything in our national life which denies
democracy. Press steadily for human equality, not only for yourselves but for all
those groups who are not given equality. It is as important for you to care that
justice is given to a Jew as it is to ﬁght for it for yourself. It is the principle that
must be established for all of us, or none of us will have it.

You will ask me, how can this be done?

Well, I reply, the spirit in which it is done is the ﬁrst thing. I should like to
see colored Americans show their belief in human equalty as a principle by making
it apply to others beyond themselves. I feel that the ﬁght against discrimination
in this country for example would have added force if the colored people would show
some interest in the way other people, also colored, are being treated. I should like
to have colored opinion express itself clearly on the matter, for example, of Chinese
immigration into this country. China is our great and brave ally—we are her ally,
rather, for it is she who has fought the war thus far, and we have done very little
even to aid her. I should like to see colored Americans take a leading part in
modifying, for example, our very discriminatory immigration laws which forbid a
quota to Chinese immigration. Now of all times would be the time, when China is
so sorely pressed by our common enemy, for America to come forward with an act
which proves to Chinese that we are determined to give up race prejudice as a
motive for our actions. What better symbolic act than to put Chinese upon a quota
basis for immigration, like that we have for Europeans, and to say that as Ameri-
cans we will give up those extra-territorial rights in China which we ought never to
have had because they were the result of treaties which were based on human
inequality? '

 

 

 

12

I should like to see colored Americans take this interest in the Chinese. And I
should like to see them press for more aid to China in planes and war materials.
We have given China one hundred old-fashioned planes from which we even removed
the radios at the last moment. We are talking of sending thirty or forty more.
That is all we have done. Yet China is trying to go on trusting us as an ally. It is
not easy. It is less easy, I can tell you, when she observes the segregation in our
army and navy and air forces. It is inevitable that she concludes that America will
help the white people with all our forces, as America is now helping England, but
America will not help her because she is not white. I cannot deny, when I am
pressed by Chinese questions, that this is true. It is true at least in its practical
effect, and I say it with anger and sorrow. I should like to be able to tell my Chinese
friends that Americans are not like that. But I cannot.

And I should like you to take a deep interest in India, who has been so unjustly
treated in our press and by our radio commentators and columnists. With what
childish arrogance these men in their ignorance of history and their complete ignor-
ance of India have dared to criticize and to judge India at this time when after years
of patient effort, she has again been denied freedom! You ought to know of India,
and for our country’s sake you ought to let India know that there are Americans
who understand her point of view and who sympathize with her desire for freedom
and her wish to work out her own problems of national unity. Freedom is not some-
thing which has to be achieved by individual or nations. It is the right of all to be
born free.

And what do you know of Korea, that people long subject to the military rule
of Japan and now longing for THEIR freedom, and what of the people of Indonesia?
For America’s sake, you must mend the ignorance of the white American and atone
for his arrogance, and do what he has not been willing to do for those who look
to America to lead in democracy. If I have a criticism to make of the colored people
of our country it is that they have been too selﬁsh in their interest in equality. They
have thought too often of equality only for themselves in this one country-—and by
so doing they have limited their own struggle and robbed it of size and force and
meaning for the whole human race. You are not simply a group of people in one
country—you are part of the great war of the peoples for freedom. They are not
only colored peoples against white—there are many white people on your side, and
white people in many parts of the world who are subject, too, to tyrants. You must
understand the meaning of the war, and you must wage it on its true scale. By
linking your particular battle for your own place in your own country to the whole
war for freedom and human equality in the world, you will enlarge your forces and
strengthen your cause, and help to win the war for democracy.

And you must remember that if we are really to achieve human equality in the
world the war must not degenerate into a war of the races or a war of East against
West. Such a struggle between prejudices will win nothing. Your enemies are not
of one race or nation, your enemies are all those who do not believe in human
equality, who judge a man by his skin, and not by what he is as an individual. Your
allies are those who believe in and practice human equality and who judge an
individual solely by what he is and what he does. As simply as that you may
know your enemies and your allies. You too must not yield to race prejudice. It
is as wrong for you to hate the white man because he is white as it is for him to
hate you because you are not white. Keep yourselves free from jealousy and revenge
that you may do your great work in the world in this time.

And what is your work? It is to be a bridge between your country and those
other countries of which I have just spoken. The white man cannot perhaps under-
stand India as India now needs to be understood, nor will he help China, as China
ought now to be helped. But you can understand India, because you know what
India has had to suffer and you know what China needs now and at the peace table.
Come out of that little world of your own and take your place in America as inter-
preters of the colored peoples of the world. Be ready to speak for Africa at the
peace table, and to speak for Korea. Make yourselves the part of America to whom
these peoples turn for understanding. Today you belong to the world, and your
demands in your own country are part of the world demand for freedom and for
human equality.

 

 

13
You must, in short, stop thinking of yourselves as colored people in a white
country. You must instead think of yourselves as people determined with other
people to make democracy come. Forget the color of your skins. How can you ask
white people to forget your color it you cannot forget it? When you really believe
that it makes no diﬂference what color your skin is, you can step out of yourselves,
free. You must, in your own spirit, be equal to any other people before you are
equal. Be free, and you can act as free people, be equal, and you will act as human
beings equal to any and all. Drive out of yourselves ﬁrst the very memory of any
difference between peoples—deny it by what you are. Go to your great work in the
world of ‘today unhampered by the thought of race prejudice in others or in your-
selves. A
As far as you are able really to believe in your own equality so far will you
be able to bring human equality about in our country and in the world. You will
not grow bigger than your own feelings, you will not accomplish more than you are.
This ﬁght for equality begins in your own soul, and then it must spread as wide as
the world. The battle against race prejudice is no longer a family quarrel in our
own house. The great storm that now sweeps humanity has swept us all with it,
and our little ﬁght against discrimination has become part of the tremendous
struggle for human freedom upon this globe.
Let us enlarge our own minds, then, let us increase the space in our souls, that
we may be ﬁt to live through these heroic times.

 

Colored American Leadership Comes Into Action on

Behalf of the Entire Human Race

By HUGH E. MACBETH, Attorney
An Address delivered at Chicago, Illinois. June 14, 1942, before Pobla, Chicago

Ladies and gentlemen of the various colored American institutions of learning,
and representatives of all walks of life among the colored people of the United States
of America, its Territories, Possessions and Dependencies:

It seems singularly ﬁtting that, as representatives of the colored people of
America, who are as yet the unheard voice in international affairs and world
policy making, we should at this crucial time foregather from all parts of America.
to this greatest monument to Anglo-Saxon economic dominance in the Western
Hemisphere-—the City of Chicago.

It has been my privilege for twenty-eight years to keep in constant attendance
and study at that listening-post of the coming new world—the basin of California.
Here Latin America meets Anglo-America. Here the Orient meets the Occident.

IN REPLY TO IVIISS PEARL BUCK

And it is in this trend of thought that I read and re-read the very interesting
and precedent-breaking open letter to colored Americans, published in the week of
March 5, 1942, in nearly all colored American newspapers in the United States, by
the world-famed author, traveller, and lecturer, Miss Pearl S. Buck of New York
City, and its sequel addressed to the white citizens of the world, in the New York
Times Sunday Magazine of May 31, 1942.

After giving this letter and its subject matter more than two months of careful
study and research, I have journeyed from Los Angeles, California, to New York
City and back to Chicago to give to Miss Buck, and through Miss Buck to the white
ruling classes of America and of the World, the answer and the reactions which her
history-making open letter to colored Americans inspires from the colored Ameri-
cans. And, being a lawyer, I shall as far as possible “speak from the record.”

Before taking up the consideration of Miss Buck’s letter, however, it may be
well to state the occasion which prompted such a letter. That occasion is the present
World War No. 2, sometimes called the War of Survival. In this war the United
States of America as one of twenty-six alleged United Nations is engaged in war
with the so-called “Axis Powers.” The United Nations lay claim to three-fourths of
the world's population and concede less than three hundred million people to the
Axis Powers. In this war the United States is now ﬁghting on seven seas, in two
hemispheres, on land, on sea, under the sea and in the air.

PEARL HARBOR ATTACK OPENS RACE WAR

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, brought the United
States openly into the war, and gave the war in the Paciﬁc the cast of a race war
on the part of Japan as the self-appointed leader of the darker, colonial peoples of
the Paciﬁc Ocean area, and Asia. The Paciﬁc and Asiatic attack of the Japanese
is being directed against the United States and Great Britain as the leaders of the
program of White Supremacy in the world.

With the battle cry of “Down with the white man’s rule of the world,” the

 

 

 

15

Japanese war organization, with machine-like precision has inflicted upon Great
Britain and the United States such a series of defeats as these two nations have
never received at the hands of a darker people in all of their existence. At the date
of Miss Buck’s letter, March 5, 1942, these defeats which began at Pearl Harbor
In the Hawaiian Islands stretched across the Paciﬁc to the Philippine Islands, and
then to Hong Kong, Indo-China, Thailand, Malaya, and Singapore. Since then
Sumatra, Java, Timor, Celebes, Borneo and Burma have been added. Japan has thus
gained conquered populations totaling over one hundred millions of people. Japan
now has ninety-four (94) per cent of the world’s supply of crude rubber, seventy-
ﬁve (75) per cent of the world’s supply of tin, seventy (70) per cent of the world’s
supply of rice, and all of the metals, fats, ﬁbers, and other materials which are suf-
ﬁcient to make her economically independent of the western world.

And Japan has done all of these things since December 7, 1941, in less than six
months and with the speed of one who travels as with seven league boots. These
achievements on the part of the Japanese forces have struck with secret terror
practically every military high command in Europe and America.

The secret of this greatest of all “blitzkriegs” in the history of modern warfare
is that natives of the countries which were conquered by Japan for centuries
were treated as inferiors by their respective white ruling classes. These natives
welcome deliverance at the hands of an army of non-white warriors who were able
to conquer their white conquerors. These natives either refused to ﬁght for their
white masters, or evacuated the country, leaving their white masters to work as well
as ﬁght for themselves, or aided the Japanese in ﬁnding secret paths and facilities
in the country as against the whites, or openly fought with the invading Japanese
against the defending, retreating whites.

It is against this background of racial war and conquest that we should proceed
to the consideration of Miss Buck’s letter to the colored people of America.

COLORED AMERICAN IS SYMBOL OF ALL WHO CRAVE DEMOCRACY

In the opening paragraph of her letter, Miss Buck says—“The colored American
stands today as a symbol, not merely for his own race in one country, but for the
hundreds of millions of other men and women, colored and white, who are waiting
for freedom and for the life which democracy promises.” A more precise statement
of the position of the colored American in these days of total racial world war has
not been made.

However, to bring home to the people of the world the full force of this state-
ment, at least a cursory glance must be given to the history of the world in the
matter of subjugation, exploitation, and military conquest. The simple truth of this
matter is that the pages of history are drenched with the blood of men and women
of every race, creed, and color, who for a time stood in the pathway of another race,
creed, and color of mankind which sought “the mastery of the world.” And in this
respect not a single race, creed, or color of mankind has been without guilt.

ALL RACES SHARE BLOOD GUILT OF WARFARE

From the days of the Pharaohs and even before the days of their “eternal”
pyramids, through the days of Cyrus of Greece, Maximinus of Rome, Attila of the
Huns, the Tsars of Russia, Genghis Khan of China, the Samurai of Japan, Cortez of
Mexico, Cromwell of England, Napoleon ‘of France, Dessalines of Haiti, down to
Hitler of Germany, Hirohito of Japan, and Mussolini of Italy, the development of
civilization, as we know it for the most part, has been one unending round of human
slaughter and govermnent compelled upon the governed in fear of death or physical
violence.

By its very deﬁnition, “freedom for mankind” implies the right of coming and
going, creating and enjoying, and the limit of religious and cultural development,
the same for one man as for another, to the territorial and material extent of the
Universe. In short, the entire world is but one relatively small neighborhood in the
Universe and the resources of each and every part of this world are necessary and
urgently convenient to the full and complete physical, mental, moral, and spiritual
development of every human being who desires this full and complete develop-

ment. (a) Witness the never-ending warfare for raw materials, trade lanes, etc.,
etc. No nation, continent, or hemisphere is self-sufficient in the sense that human
appetites and desires do not crave some of the things and advantages which exist
elsewhere. This is the very nature of man. And the economy of the world in which
man has developed is but ONE ECONOMY, indivisible. True it is that man can
EXIST without access to this full world-economy, but he develops “peculiarities”
such as in color, size, odor, habits, customs, etc., which go to rate him as “superior”
or “inferior,” largely depending upon who does the “rating” and when and how
and why.

And it is just here that the blood of man has ﬂowed and still ﬂows to fertilize
the earth. The “superiors” by enslavement cause the “inferiors” to serve their ends,
or failing in this, the “superiors” seek by military means to remove the offending
“inferiors” (often called “barbarians”) from the face of the earth.

CEASELESS STRUGGLE FOR WORLD RACIAL SUPREMACY

It is the stark realization of this bloody grinding, death-dealing, age-old “bar-
barous” and unscientiﬁc process which causes Miss Buck to “cry out” in her letter
to the colored Americans. And why should she not “cry out?” Does she not see
(as all of us see) the bloody lunatic process grinding before our very eyes? One
race from a tiny island during the past four hundred years by the usual time-
honored means of warfare, and the “tricks and devises of forfeiture” as found in
trade, tariffs, ﬁnance, etc., has built an empire upon which for a hundred years, until
recently, the sun never set. Lustily the rulers of this Empire sang “Brittania Rules
the Waves.” However, this business of “ruling the waves” soon cramped the
“freedom” style of another of the “inferiors” who sought to be the “superior” and
soon the world heard the answering refrain of “Deutschland, Deutschland Uber
Alles.” This “superiority contest” ranged through the gamut of rivalry from songs
to scientiﬁc mechanized warfare. This warfare eventually developed into totalitarian
proportions, engaging every human in the warring territories, armed and unarmed,
and from “the cradle to the grave.”

Into this lunacy of so-called war, on December 7, 1941, burst the supercolossal
lunacy of lunacies at Pearl Harbor, from the very bottom of the pile of “racial
inferiors” and the.long heralded world race war is now on with the cry of “down
with White Supremacy.”

The newest claimants for world racial superiority now out-kill the best killer
classes of the so-called white races of mankind. They seek to marshal behind their
mechanized up-to-date scientiﬁc killing organization the more than two billions of
non-white people of the world.

What a spectacle!

WAR ISSUE IS THAT OF HUMAN SLAVERY

It is here that Miss Buck cries out concerning “the responsibility resting at this
moment upon the colored Americans for the survival of human freedom.”

In the second paragraph of her letter, Miss‘ Buck describes the hundreds of
millions in this world who are awaiting freedom as including the people of India,
and the colonials of Asia and Africa, and the “non-colonials” wh-o, without freedom,
are ruled by certain groups of their own race and kind, and “who long for a society
which gives them opportunities not lessened because of blood and birth.” This
description includes practically nine-tenths of the entire human race, including
most members of the so-called “White races.” Here Miss Buck puts her ﬁnger upon
a vital nerve center of this entire world holocaust, and as a colored American I can
answer this paragraph with a resounding “Amen!”

The issue presented by this war is that of human slavery. And who knows the
form, the bite, and the sting of human slavery better than the American Negro!
While technically emancipated, he has never been free from the more than three
centuries of physical, mental, and spiritual tortures, rapings, and toilings for the
master class, “who toiled not,” but who always “gathered into barns” the labors of
others. The modern world calls them “Fascists.” The colored American calls them
“slave owners.” They live and operate by sheer brutality, murder, and terrorism,

 

 

 

 

     

17
whether they operate by bow and arrow, riﬂes, bayonets, battleships, or swarms of
tanks, clouds of planes, or poison gas. The breed is the same--they have an identical
purpose, the limitation and debasement of their fellow human beings, and the limita-
tion and debasement of themselves. For they even breed themselves to their slaves
and sell their own offspring into slavery. And, ﬁnally, they enslave their own
mothers, and fathers, and children, as witness their miserable treatment of their
elders who need pensions, their unemployed, and their youth.

“TREASURY EMPTY” FOR HUMAN NEEDS, BUT BILLIONS FOUND
FOR WAR

For light on the modern manifestation of this attitude of our ruling class to
the rank and ﬁle of those who are ruled one should read the debates in our Con-
gressional Record, and tally the votes on pensions and unemployment when our
“Economy Bloc” performed at Washington and found the “treasury empty” for
peaceful, constructive, human needs. And then tally the votes of these same states-
men less than six months thereafter, as WITHOUT DEBATE, they found “billions in
the treasury” for other purposes. There you will ﬁnd the imperishable record of the
“ruling class” in the greatest democratic nation of our civilized world at a moment
of crisis. Consistently they followed the world trend of “civilization as we know
it”—that of interracial human exploitation.

“KILLER CLASSES” OF ALL RACES EMPLOY IDENTICAL TECHNIQUE

And now we shudder at the military ruthlessness and “success” of Japan! The
simple truth, Miss Buck, is that the thinking and informed leadership of the colored
Americans sees no difference between the military, ruling, killer class of Japan and
that of the leaders of “civilization as we know it,” other than that Japanese
killers are fanatically devoted to their Cause and consequently operate with greater
abandon and more efficiency. In principle, so far as we colored Americans are con-
cerned, they are “birds of a feather.” They even accommodate each other in the
matter of the use of tools of human enslavement, such as war munitions (oil, scrap
iron, patents, machine tools, etc., etc.).

It is entirely true, however, that among the lower reaches of the exploited
American Negro there is suppressed sadistic glee at the prospect of his having to
move over on the work bench of the exploited and make way for some of his white
masters who found so much joy “in keeping the Negro down.” And the fact that
the bayonet which threatens this prospect is in the hands of a “non—white” killing
class heightens this sadistic glee. BUT DO NOT BE MISLED BY THIS CIRCUM-
STANCE. IT IS LIMITED IN ITS SCOPE AS WELL AS IN ITS INTENSITY.

HUMAN IVIISERY OF NINE-TENTHS OF WORLD GEARED T0 DESTROY
DEMOCRACY

On the other hand, you should not be misled into thinking that the intelligent
colored American thinks that this war is a war between Democracies and Totali-
tarian Fascists. HE KNOWS BETTER. It is a war in which the Fascist, or slave-
owning elements of the world, are using the human misery of nine-tenths of the
people in the world to wipe out the one strongest effort of Democracy in the world—
our beloved United States of America. And truly it is OUR UNITED STATES-—-our
hope, which we have ever cherished, never tarnished, and for which we have given
“our blood, our toil, and our sweat” as no other group or race of people in this
country has given.

TOTALITARIANS CHARGE DEMOCRACIES AS HYPOCRISIES

The Fascist leaders of the Axis Powers charge that the “Democracies” are
“Hypocrisies.” And as proof, they point to our consistent policy of Anglo-Saxon
racial superiority which has run through American lives, our government, and our
religions as an unbroken chain. They say we landed at Plymouth Rock with a Bible
under one arm and a “blunderbuss” under the other arm, and that we practically
exterminated an entire race—the American Indian—and put the unexterminated
residue in concentration camps where they remain to-day; they say the very signers
of the world-publicized Declaration of Independence owned Negro slaves at the

 

 

18 .

time of signing this pious declaration, and that it never occurred to them to square
their conduct with their profession of democracy in so far as it involved abandon-
ing their ideas of White Supremacy. And they point to residential restriction laws,
jim-crow schools, churches, lodges, newspapers, radios, transportation, military,
naval, and aerial services, public and private employment and wage systems, racial
[and laws, racial exclusion acts, election laws and social customs, as proof of the
fact that our war issue of democracy is just a matter of semantics-words. In
conduct and principle they allege that the contending governments, and their eco-
nomic and social philosophies rest upon the same “solid rocks” of supreme power
in the hands of the “racially chosen ones,” backed up by the necessary “killing
power” to make those born “without the ve' ” conform to the racial pattern of the
ruling class or suffer death immediately, or by gradual process.

HOW COLORED AMERICANS CAN HELP SAVE DEMOCRACY

It is at this point that the death knell of our sickly democracy is being sounded.
Miss Buck senses this fact with unerring accuracy when she says in the fourth
paragraph of her letter—“If the democratic peoples (the United Nations) win, there
will be a chance to work out true democracy. If the democratic peoples lose, there
will be no further chance for a long time even to try anything like freedom . . . . .
This war, therefore, belongs to the colored American as much as to the white Ameri-
can and they stand or fall together with the rest of humanity.”

However, when Miss Buck assumes that the average colored American can do
anything to save our “democracy” in the crisis in which it ﬁnds itself in this World
War of Survival, she reckons without her facts.

The only real services which colored Americans can now give are as follows:
(1) helping to develop a new national policy of sincere, effective, constructive, all-
including democracy here at ‘home; (2) visiting the rank and ﬁle of the people
of Latin America, Japan, India, China, Africa, and the colonial peoples everywhere,
and calling their attention to the genuine democracy which then obtains in the
United States, and showing them that the democracy of the United States includes
in every way all peoples of the world who will come up to our democratic standards
of life, with no arbitrary racial, religious, caste, wealth, or geographic barriers;
(3) calling the attention of the European peoples to the fact that this present
mechanized slaughter among themselves is gradually wiping out the so-called “white
racial stoc ” as an effective element in the New World Order. (b)

If the “white nations” unite for the sole purpose of wiping out «Japan as threat-
ening the domination of the world by the yellow races, they will only solidify all
the yellow races, brown races, and black races behind Japan for an interminable
racial war. This war will have the stimulating effect on the colored races of a
thorough “pruning” of their racial stock, but will leave the so-called white races
with scarcely enough “seed corn” left to start a new crop.

Along the above lines the colored American leadership is ready, willing, and
able to perform. This leadership has no racial hatreds. It has been successfully
impregnated for three hundred years with the .blood of all races of mankind.
England and Germany, Orient and Occident, Anglo-America and Latin America
have already met in its blood, and it is vigorous, happy, and well disposed to every
human being. It has no “secret larceny” in its heart. Its motto is: “I refuse to
take for myself that which on the same -terms I would not concede to the last
forgotten man, woman or child on the face of the earth.”

NEGRO LOYALTY TO A “FAITI-ILESS DEMOCRACY” WILL NOT SAVE IT

But for colored Americans to stand with our “hypocritical democracy” in the
opposition which is now gathering among the darker peoples of the earth against
White Supremacy is but to continue to die with that White Supremacy in this titanic
struggle. This fate is our common fate. The colored American as a whole has been
only a parasite on the host of “American White Supremacy.” We cannot, if we
would, escape the fate of American white democracy. We can only ﬁght with it to
higher and safe ground—which is to be found upon the mountain top of true
political, economic, and social democracy. However, in making such a ﬁght for this

 

 

 

 

19

higher ground of true democracy, the colored American ﬁnds himself caught between
two withering cross ﬁres. (1) The ﬁrst cross ﬁre is that of the inbred racial hatred
of the members of the governing “killer class” of the White Supremacy group, who,
while in the minority, dominate the mob action of the majority with all of the
cunning and ferocity of wolves pursuing a ﬂock of sheep. The only kind of colored
American “cooperation” which they tolerate is that of the “Uncle Tom” or “yes
man” variety. In peace, they herd the colored Americans in a jim-crow economic,
political, social, and religious concentration camp. In war time, they order the
colored Americans into battle for white democracy in jim-crow units, mostly work
battalions, and return them to their jim-crow concentration camp status after the
war, using abundant “riﬂe and bayonet” action to accomplish this last mentioned
task. (2) The second and by far more dangerous cross ﬁre is that of the organized
and aroused “killer class” of the colored peoples outside of the United States of
America. At present it comprises the warlike elements of the Japanese people.
These Japanese warriors constitute a “killer class” quite as ferocious and effective
as the ‘.‘killer class” of any of the white nations, and they have no respect for sub-
servient colored Americans who accept inferior racial status. The members of the
Japanese “killer class” have an advantage over the members of the “killer classes”
of the white nations in that the former automatically “go to Heaven” as they die
in battle for their group, while the latter to date require the “beneﬁt of clergy” or
chaplains in all their war efforts whether on land, on sea, under the sea, or in the
air. And this advantage is a terriﬁc one, as I have discovered after twenty-nine
years of close study of the reactions of the Japanese people to white racial superi-
ority. All through the California Alien Land Law Constitutional Amendment Fight
in 1920, and through the Oriental Exclusion Act Campaign (National Immigration) in
1924, I observed the effect of white racial superiority upon the Japanese. I realize
the unspeakable hurt the Japanese felt within when “told” of their inferiority.
I was there. Life no longer held pleasure for them save as they prepared for Pearl
Harbor, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Java, Burma, etc., etc. And I know
that to get the Japanese people to submit to this “inferior status” it will be neces-
sary to kill ‘virtually the last breeding pair of them. Temporary military victory
over them will serve only to breed swarms of new “Asiatic Hitlers,” to plague the
lives of the white peoples of the world in the future. This Japanese “killer class”
thrusts its instruments of death not only against the White American who scorns
the Japanese racially, but likewise against the colored American who for one reason
or another prefers to live a “jim-crow” subjugated life rather than die for full
freedom. In short, it would just as readily kill or enslave the colored American
who accepts inferior status from the white man as it would kill the white man. In
fact, I seriously believe that Japanese “bushido” accords more respect to the master
class than to the subject class.

SUPREMACY OF WHITE “KILLER CLASSES” IS A MYTH

And to add to the difficulties of the United Nations’ conquering the Japanese
on our status quo colored American racial basis are these facts. (A) The non-
Japanese darker and exploited peoples of the world have had demonstrated to them
that the “killer class” of a non-white nation can kill as effectively and with as much
scientiﬁc mechanized precision, and belt—line mass production, as the heretofore
wor1d—dominating white “killer classes.” (c) (B) The overwhelming majority of the
potential ﬁghters in the United Nations’ war front are non-white and they are
nursing open as well as secret hurts to their respective racial or national prides,
ranging from losses of territory, lopsided rates of exchange, trade practices, etc., to
immigration and naturalization exclusion acts. However the rulers, ambassadors,
and top—ﬂight citizenry of the respective countries may react, most Mexicans for
example think of Texas and California as belonging to them, and most Chinese,
Hindus, Filipinos (as well as Japanese) resent being barred from entry to the United
States because of racial identity.

They regard our country as insincere when it talks of Democracy as guiltless
of racial oppression.

UNITED STATES MUST SAVE DEMOCRACY FOR ALL PEOPLE

Miss Buck states that, “Faulty as our Democracy is, the United States must be
the leader in this war for the right of people to be free—there is no other great
leader to whom we can look.” In this she voices the opinion of most colored Ameri-
cans. (d) And it is just here that the picture becomes cloudy. To date the leadership
of the United States has given little evidence of doing other than maintaining “civil-
ization as we know it,” with all of its overburden of imperialism, exploiting capital-
ism, racial and religious “divide and conquer” philosophies, and with brutal disregard
of the dignity which is to be found in each human being. Mohandas Gandhi
expressed the point of view of most of the thinking colored American leadership
when he said (speaking of India) that he was not seeking a change of imperial
masters; he wanted independence of them all.

The colored American newspapers have caught this thought in their double
“V" War Victory Campaign Slogan. They realize that our country cannot win a
victory for Democracy for all the people of the world while it denies Democracy, in
all of its essential freedoms, to more than a tenth of its population at home.

COLORED AMERICANS CARRY THE FLAG

Miss Buck then goes on to explain that there is one group of white Americans
which is free of racial discrimination composed of members “who have an honest
determination to work for real freedom and equality.” On the other hand she states,
“the mass of the white Americans belongs to a second group. These willingly or
unwillingly acknowledge prejudice, but they are beginning to believe in varying
degrees that their prejudice is wrong.” Here we have the high point of Miss Buck’s
courageous human appeal. The remaining paragraphs of her letter are more in the
nature of arguments based upon the statement of the fact of American race preju-
dice. In the concluding one sentence paragraph of her letter, Miss Buck puts the
matter of victory for the United States in our present World War for Survival
deﬁnitely upon the shoulders of the colored citizens of the United States of America,
in these seven words: “It is you who carry the ﬂag I”

From the days of Sergeant Carney at Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston,
South Carolina, during our Civil War, there has been a saying (and a true one) that
when colored soldiers have been called to the defense of the Stars and Stripes, “The
Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.” And it is in the sense of keeping that ﬂag
of the most serious and most successful democratic experiment from “touching the
ground,” that we answer the challenge of Miss Buck with the following observations
and suggested plan of immediate action.

OPINIONS ENTERTAINED BY THINKING COLORED AMERICANS

It would serve no constructive purpose to refrain from making public to Miss
Buck and to the people of our country at large the following opinions which are
entertained by an overwhelming number of the thinking leaders of the colored people
of America. .

(1) Colored Americans resent the racial barriers which have been maintained
against their participation in the policy-making functions of the Government of the
United States. On any decent theory of Democracy, the colored Americans, com-
prising more than a tenth of the population, should have representation in the
Cabinet of the President of the United States. Such representation would have
placed the racial facts which have led up to the present world-wide racial war
before our National Government in such a manner as would have deprived the
Japanese “killer class” of much of the advantage it now enjoys over the white “killer
classes” by reason of racial hatreds.

(2) Many colored American thinking leaders were nauseated as they observed
the manner in which the Allied Democracies abandoned the democratic government
of Germany to economic chaos after the ﬁrst World War.

(3) Many colored American thinking leaders are satisﬁed that Hitler was
assisted in his war preparations by leaders of ﬁnance, industry, and politics, in
England, France, Belgium, Holland, the United States and others of the Allied

 

 

21
Democracies, for the purpose of destroying Russia—-the most serious threat to
Capitalism.

(4) Many colored American thinking leaders believe that many ﬁnancial,
industrial, and political leaders of the United Nations prefer an early peace with
Hitler to a Russian triumph over Germany, and the consequent world ascendancy of
racial and economic equality as practiced in Russia.

Virtually all colored Americans believe:
(a) That all human beings, including Japanese, Asiatics, Africans, Indi-
ans, Latin Americans, and others, prefer the freedoms of Democracy to
Dictatorship, and would welcome the leadership of the United States in a
sincere program of interracial, democratic, non-exploiting development.
(b) That racial prejudice is a kind of lunacy and must be treated as such
if it is not to be aggravated.
(c) That proper scientiﬁc treatment should be provided for victims of
racial prejudice, and that those found incurable, or unwilling to submit to
scientiﬁc treatment should be interned for the duration, or until cured, as
a neceessary military safeguard to our national security in the current
world-wide racial war.
((1) That all orders, military or otherwise, arbitrarily classifying people
by race, creed, color, or ancestral origin, without supporting evidence of
INDIVIDUAL GUILT or INDIVIDUAL REASONABLE SUSPICION, be
relaxed as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of democracy, and visit-
ing the evils of dictatorship upon the citizens of a democracy.
(e) That Democracy can be brought into existence only where each citizen
is given access to sufficient food, clothing, and shelter to sustain a normal
physical, mental, and spiritual existence. '
(f) That military power should not be used in a democracy for aggres-
sion, but only for actual defense, and not for actual aggression in the
name, style, and under the guise of defense.
(g) All racial and religious barriers and references should be eliminated

V in defense forces and activities of a democracy. In this respect, attention
is respectfully called to Russia’s example and her consequent national
unity and successful national defense.

COLORED AMERICANS FIGHT BARBARISM THE WORLD OVER

By a strange coincidence, it happens that a distinguished white American, a
descendant of the Old South, but a harbinger of the New America with which the
colored American leadership will make common cause in building the New Democ-
racy of America, as the forerunner of the Democracy of the World, Mr. Herbert
Agar, in Harpers Magazine for May, 1942, under the title, “The Truth is Good
News,” voices the opinion of the colored thinking leadership of the United States on
the present world conﬂict in the following words which with the permission of
Harper and Brothers I quote: _

“If we pretend that we are at war merely because the Japanese attacked us at
Pearl Harbor we are depriving the greatest of human tragedies of all its meaning.
Pearl Harbor is the last of a series of events which prove that life still makes sense.
If we deny the sense we turn our Shakespearean tragedy into a comedy of errors.

“We are not at war because of Manchuria in 1931. Or because of Ethopia in
1935. Or because of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Or because of Poland, Norway,
Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Russia, Pearl Harbor, or
the Philippines. . . . . . .

“We are not at war because of John Simon or Laval or Chamberlain or our
own State Department. To blame the war on Chamberlain is as trivial as to blame
it on his umbrella.

“We are not at war because of Hitler. To blame the war on Hitler is to turn
our tragedy into a Broadway farce. It is to rewrite the last act of ‘Hamlet’ and to
make the Prince die by slipping on a banana peel . . . . .

“The war is the military phase of a world-wide revolt against civilization. The
revolt was possible because of a world-wide disintegration of civilization. The revolt

 

2‘ ‘
‘.
.
I
o

I
i

 

 

22

and the disintegration long preceded the war, and will continue long after it unless
we renew the roots of our life while beating the men who have taken up arms
against us. The two jobs are in fact one job, and neither can be accomplished alone.

“What is civilization? It is a set of rules by which most men abide, of promises
to which most men adhere. It is a set of institutions, of homely customs, which
express the experience of centuries . . . . . .

“What is barbarism? Its results are always the same though its nature is dual.
It always ends in a belief in power for power’s sake . . . . .

“Our treatment of the Negro problem in America is another example of our
world’s failure to maintain its faith in itself . . . . .

“Our Christian tradition demands that we move steadily toward a solution of
the Negro problem in terms of human dignity and justice. Our American tradition
reinforces that demand. Yet for the most part in the post-war world we were
content to make big promises in regard to the Negro and to do nothing effective.
The combination of promising the moon and doing little is again a combination
which tends to make man nihilistic. It is almost as harmful to the men who make
the idle promises as to the men who grieve because the promises are not fulﬁlled.

“Behind the Negro problem, as anyone with a sense of history will know, there
looms the vast problem of the colored races throughout the world—a problem which
contains within itself the question of the survival of our democratic faith. If we
consider this race problem as a symbol of man's self-betrayal everywhere it will
help us to understand the world revolt of to-day. It will also help us to understand
the heights to which we must lift ourselves if we are to save ourselves. For we have
had two recent warnings of the larger, darker background to this Negro problem.

“Pearl Buck, who is aware of Asia, has warned us that we cannot win this war
unless we convince our colored allies—our most numerous allies—that the white
man is at last ready to lay down his ‘burden’ and think in terms of a single human
race, working together to make a ﬁt habitation out of this tragic globe. Lin Yutang
brings similar news from China. ‘If we plan to win in Asia,’ he writes, ‘we must
make the war in Asia a popular war for the Asiatics.’ And both writers point out
that the Japanese are making great and successful use of every sign of racial
prejudice in America. Unhappily, they do not have to invent such signs. Again
we see the barbarian within us serving as the secret weapon of the barbarian with-
out. Again the prerequisite to victory is not only military defense but MORAL
REFORM . . . . .

“And when the barbarian wins he must make the globe one graveyard for the
hopes of man. ,

“Can we tell this truth, cogently and fast, to the millions of our brothers all
across the earth? We dare not answer ‘No.’ We must learn to do the job, since
the alternative is death . . . . .

“Our other advantage in telling the story is that fate has forced our world into
such a corner that we must gamble for ‘double or quits.’ If we refuse to play we
shall be murdered in our silly seats. If we play at all we play for neck or nothing . . .

“There are Americans who would say, if the price of beating Hitler is to treat
men of other races as if they were our equals, they would rather be on the side of
Hitler. But they would not say this if they knew what it meant to be on the side of
Hitler, if they knew that when a barbarian kills a world he can put nothing but
chaos in its place. They do not want America to go back to the bare beginnings of
life. The truth would put them on our side . . . . .

“We cannot win the war at all without promoting justice within our nation and
giving freedom new meaning by relating it to community responsibility.

“To win the war, therefore, means not only to overcome the virulent corruption
which has assailed us from without. but to be healed of the weakness and folly
which have betrayed us from within. It means also to lay the foundations for a
fairer world, to bring a technical civilization under the domination of brotherhood,
thus harnessing our resources for creative tasks.

“For once the truth is good news. An understanding of the meaning of the war
reminds us that in the midst of confusion and defeat life still makes sense. If we
understand in time we can save our world. There is reason to history, and hence

 

 

 

23

there is hope. Our men are dying in a great inevitable tragedy that can be turned
into a victory.”

I strongly advise every American, colored or white, to secure a copy of this
Harpers for May, 1942. for his permanent library ﬁles.

COLORED AMERICA LEADS IN A PROGRAM OF ACTION TO RESCUE
CIVILIZATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL MAN KIND!

And now to the conclusion of the matter. The time is short. The enemies of
our Nation press us toward defeat, from without as well as from within. The tide of
battle throughout the world shifts the burden of war leadership and war sacriﬁce
more and more upon us “in blood, in sweat and in treasure.” Our men battle the
increasing millions of fanatical “haters of white men” on seven seas and in both
hemispheres. And while the racial war is but in its formative phases, our Nation's
white and colored manhood goes out in streams to every battleﬁeld from Iceland to
Africa and from Alaska to Australia. The casualty lists mount, and the rivulets of
Wounded and war-shattered youth ﬂow back to our homes and our hospitals—
haunted and haunting by memories.

Our Nation is “magniﬁcently defending from one retreat to another,” as the
colored millions of the earth from Asia to Africa gather in under bloody leadership
for “the kill” of that ruthless killing tribe of white men who built their empire by
the sword—-“the sword” which has sent to their deaths untold millions of colored
mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, ‘sons, and daughters during the past ﬁve hundred
years. The thoughts and memories of the dying agonies of these millions of colored
dead now madden the brains of these living colored millions as they slowly make
way for, and often times assist the mechanized colored killers under the banner of
the “Rising Sun.”

The colored American leadership accepts your challenge for the defense of our
Democracy, Miss Buck. You say to us: “It is you who carry the ﬂag.”

Our DEFENSE is an intelligent, considered, constructive OFFENSE. We say
to you, and through you, to all elements of American citizenship, “It is WE, and all
of us, who carry the ﬂag, and it will never touch the ground.”

Here is our plan of OFFENSE—our plan of victory for the democracy of the
United States of America and the democracy of the world:

(1) Gather the intelligent, constructive, cooperative fearless leadership of the
colored people of America and the corresponding elements of the white people of
America into an immediate informal organization to be known as The Defenders of
Democracy. Provide for associate membership in this organization in every race,
national, and religious group in the world. Nominations for organized membership
to be chosen as follows: (A) by Miss Pearl S. Buck for the white Americans and by
this representative club, “Pobla,” of Chicago for the colored Americans; (B) an
equal number of colored and white organizers would be chosen to represent all walks
of life in our nation, but in all not to exceed a total of thirty in number as a
beginning; (C) this group shall assume full responsibility for the execution of the
successful, cooperative, racial OFFENSIVE which will bring victory to our Democ-
racy and eventual victory for democracy and for people who seek democracy,
throughout the world.

(2) Call upon our matchless but over-burdened leader, President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, immediately to make clear to all the world that the United States
is not ﬁghting for the supremacy of any one race or nation, or special combination
of races or nations, as a world leader, but on the contrary is deﬁnitely ﬁghting
against imperialism and dictatorship of all sorts and varieties, whether totalitarian,
or under democratic guise, and whether military, political, or economic. That the
Atlantic Charter and the Four Freedoms apply to every human being in the world.
Have the President invite the colored American Press to his press conferences.

(3) Have the Office of Civilian Defense assume full responsibility for the
creation, and development of a program of education and enforcement directed to
the elimination of all racial, religious, color, age, youth, ancestral, and sectional
prejudices as contributing more actively toward national disunity and national
defeat than all that can be accomplished by enemy agents and saboteurs toward our

24
defeat. Have this program of education emphasize that laying aside of such preju-
dices, etc., for the duration is just as mandatory and of vastly greater importance
in keeping our Nation from subjugation than is the rationing of tires, gasoline, sugar,
coffee, etc. For this program of education will cool the ﬁres of racial hatred which
bring the unending hordes of the colored world majority against us in scientiﬁc
mechanized slaughter.

(4) That the following petitions to the President of the United States be given
immediate nation-wide circulation, and be ﬁled with the President, and by every
democratic process be pressed to successful accomplishment.

MAKE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION A MILITARY OFFENSE

The undersigned, citizens of the United States of America, do hereby most
earnestly represent and petition as follows: (1) That the United States of America is
engaged in a World War for Survival; (2) That the matters of racial prejudice and
racial discrimination in the United States of America are being used by our enemies,
the Axis Powers, to undermine the faith of the darker peoples of the World in the
racial justice of the democracy of the United States of America. The darker
peoples of the world comprise the overwhelming majority of the people of the world.
This racial prejudice enemy propaganda is increasing the cost in lives, armaments
and property of a victory for our armed forces among the non-white nations and
peoples of the earth. Therefore, we petition you as Commander—in-Chief of the Army
and Navy to issue by executive or military order or decree a regulation of war,
making it a treasonable offense for any person or organization, public or private,
to indulge in any act of racial discrimination, or by word or otherwise to advocate
or incite others to racial discrimination, and that such offenses be punished by the
military authorities of the United States of America as an act of treason and an aid
and comfort to the enemies of our Nation who now wage war against us.

ESTABLISH SECRETARY OF INTERRACIAL AFFAIRS IN U. S. CABINET

The undersigned, citizens of the United States of America, do hereby most
earnestly petition you to establish in the Cabinet of the President of the United
States the Department of Secretary of Interracial Affairs, whose function it shall
be to promote complete understanding and constructive cooperation between all the
various racial groups of mankind both within the territorial boundaries of the United
States of America and without said territorial boundaries to the extent of all such
political, commercial or other contacts which the Government of the United States
or its citizens may have with races of mankind without said territorial boundaries.
The undersigned further petition that in the event the Department of Secretary of
Interracial Affairs be created that there be appointed to said Secretaryship an out-
standing colored American citizen of extended experience, contacts, and sympathy
with all races of mankind, and who has the conﬁdence and respect of both the white
and non-white groups or races of the human family.

CALL A CONFERENCE OF PEOPLE OF THE‘ UNITED NATIONS TO ADVISE
ON WAR AIMS AND PEACE AIMS

The undersigned, who are either colored citizens of the United States of Amer-
ica, or American citizens of other races who believe in equal political, economic, and
social justice for all mankind and who believe that all men are born equal and are
entitled to certain inalienable rights, among which are “life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness,” do hereby represent and petition as follows: (1) That it is of prime
importance that the United States of America be victorious in the World War for
Survival in which we are now engaged; (2) That victory for the United States in
this war of survival would be assured if our war aims were arrived at and given
world-wide promulgation DURING THE PERIOD OF CONFLICT, IN SUCH A
MANNER AS TO APPEAL TO THE SENSE OF JUSTICE AND TO THE HUMAN
NEEDS OF THE BANK AND FILE MAJORITY OF THE HUMAN BEINGS OF
THE WORLD; (3) That at the present time the majority of the people of the world
who are colored or non-white peoples labor under the impression that the United

 

 

 

25

States of America is at war to maintain the world supremacy of what is known as
the white race; (4) That in varying degrees the United States of America in its
population past and present represents and embodies the lives, achievements, con-
structive thought and aspirations of men, women and children of every racial group
in the world; (5) That no war ever produces an after war peace any better than
the declared aims of the warriors as set forth before or during the conﬂict. Where-
fore we earnestly petition that permission be given the undersigned in the name and
style of an AMERICAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE STATEMENT OF
JUST AND VICTORIOUS WAR AIMS, to call together in the United States of
America with adequate guarantees of passport and travel permit facilities repre-
sentatives of every major occupational group of human beings in each of the United
Nations now or hereafter engaged in defense against the Axis Powers, at an early
time and place certain and convenient, there to consult together in closed extended
sessions for the determination of suggested war aims which will assist in bringing a
just and victorious peace not only to the United States of America but to all the
peoples of the World.

(5) That the full facilities of government, radio, press, and motion pictures,
and other means of public and private education, be immediately employed to make
our Nation of one mind and of one purpose in clearly deﬁning and sincerely living
the democratic way of life, which is the heart desire of every normal human being,
of whatever color, race, creed, language, ancestry, and wherever found.

United, we stand! Divided, We fall!

But though TRUE DEMOCRACY may be hard pressed, it can NEVER BE
CONQUERED. Its ﬂag must never touch the ground.
Come, let us ﬁght together for a common Democracy!

cooperation. Second, that this applies fully to countries at present within the
British Empire, and that India’s independence is recognized as well as her right
to frame her own constitution through an assembly of her elected representa-
tives, who will also consider her future relations with Britain and other
countries. Third, that all races and peoples must be treated as equal and
allowed equal opportunities of growth and development. Individuals and races
may and do diifer, and some are culturally or intellectually more mature than
others. But the door of advancement must -be open to all; indeed those that are
immature should receive every help and encouragement. Nothing has alienated
people more from the Nazis than their racial theories and the brutal application
of these theories. But a similar doctrine and its application are in constant
evidence in subject countries.

“Such a declaration clearly means the ending of imperialism everywhere with
all its dominating position and special privileges. That will be a greater blow to
Nazism and Fascism than any military triumph, for Nazism and Fascism are an
intensiﬁcation of the principle of imperialism. The issue of freedom will then
be clean and clear before the world, and no subterfuge or equivocation will be
possible.”

The Importance of Fair Employment Practices as
Aiding Democracy

An Address delivered at Embassy Hall, Los Angeles, California,
October 20, 1941

Gentlemen of the Federal Fair Employment Practices Committee:

On behalf of the so-called minority groups of the American citizens of the
Western Coast of the United States, I take great pleasure in extending a sincere
welcome to your honorable and history-making committee.

An unusual wisdom characterizes your decision to hold your ﬁrst public hearing
in this great Los Angeles Basin, the listening po.st at which the nations and peoples
of the Pacific area get their information from day to day as to the progress and
status of the World’s Greatest Democracy. For more than a quarter of a. century
your speaker has had the privilege of being an active force for democratic processes,
and a quiet observer of the activities and attitudes of the multitudes from every
race, nation, creed and color of mankind, in this fair land where the East meets the
West, and the South brings the color and romance of Latin America to temper the
rush and materialism of the North. The very fact of this experience compels me to
speak to your committee at short length, but with almost brutal frankness on this
occasion.

The democratic theory of government of the United States of America is the
best yet devised by man. To-day it is being challenged by Nazi Germany and her
allies under the leadership of Adolph Hitler. His mechanized warfare is conducted
with a lunatic fury more frightful than the slaughters of Genghis Khan. With a
cunning which cannot be entirely accounted for on the theory of lunacy, Hitler
scoffs at our theory of democracy as unworkable, full of hypocrisy, and in fact a
plutocracy, rather than a democracy. He charges that this plutocracy and pseudo-
democracy betrayed his Fatherland by causing it to surrender to the allied armies
of the First World War upon President Wilson’s accepted Fourteen Points, only to
be hamstrung by the Versailles Treaty. To avenge this alleged betrayal, Hitler has
thrown the entire German people into a system of belt-line production of mechan-
ized instruments of warfare. These instruments of death are operated in Franken-
stein fashion on land and sea, by a war-maddened generation of millions of German
people who at this moment cover the continent of Europe as a consuming plague of
locusts. Their mechanized instruments of warfare crawl under the seas and skim
the surface of the seas, seriously threatening Great Britain’s mastery of the seas.
They consequently threaten the economic, political, social and religious life of the
United States of America. All this has been done by Hitler’s Nazis under a system
of racial pogroms and hatreds with but few parallels in recorded history.

Against all of this racial intolerance and bloody warfare the United States is
called to defend. Our plan of defense is based upon the theory that we are to be
the producing arsenal of democracy. To this end more than forty billions of dollars
have been appropriated by the national Congress.

Yet in the face of this national crisis, the President of the United States ﬁnds
himself called upon to create this committee by his executive order, due to the
fact that the overwhelming majority of the ruling and employing leaders of our
Nation in government, industry and labor, look upon the present world conﬂict as a
family quarrel among the so-called white rulers of the world and feel that none but

 

 

28
white men should be given ﬁrst and full responsibility, authority and employment
in the Work of defending our democracy from the threats of Nazism.

It is for the purpose of bringing home to the minds of your committee some of
the facts which brought your committee into existence, and also to emphasize the
primary importance of fair, vigorous, prompt and careful action on the part of your
committee that I speak. If our defense efforts are to be successful, and we are not
to become the laughing stock of the Nazis and the non-white world at large, then

your action must be as decisive as that of Lincoln when he acted to save our Union

from internal disruption. c’

In the ﬁrst place the matter of excluding Negroes from fair and equal employ-
ment opportunities is not new. It is the cancer which was injected into our eco-
nomic, political and social life with the landing of the ﬁrst shipload of Negro slaves
in Virginia in 1619. This cancerous tissue grew to be the very basic foundation
stone of the economy of the English colonies, and it grew through the period of the
Declaration of Independence, and the adoption of the Constitution of the United
States. The Civil War ended this kind of exploitation as a matter of law.

As a matter of practice, the end product of the Civil War which is the Four-
teenth Amendment to our Constitution, by the manipulation of clever lawyers,
became the foundation stone of our present human-exploiting corporation structures
Many other minority or exploited groups were then added to that of the Negro”

During all of this time the exploitation of Negro women by the men of all
races and nationalities who sought refuge in this “land of the free and the home of
the brave,” made of the Negro people of the United States the largest aggregation
of people of mixed blood to be found on earth to-day who give undivided allegiance
to a democracy.

It is this group of people which, by the centuries of unrequited labors of its
ancestors and of itself, has the largest single material and spiritual stake in the
democracy known as the United States of America. This group has become
outraged at the sight of the warring elements of Fascism and Nazism in the midst
of our country, who brazenly refuse defense employment to Negroes and minority
groups. This group incited the proposed Negro March on Washington, which
resulted eventually in the establishment of your committee-—thanks to the states-
manship of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

While it is true that organized Negro leadership inspired the formation of the
committee, and organized Negro leadership stands by to see that this committee
functions to the full purpose and intent of its creation, it should be borne in mind
that the American Negro to-day comprises all colors, creeds, and racial strains or
mankind. We live in peace and happiness with Jew and Gentile, Catholic and
Protestant, English and German, Italian and Japanese, Mexican and Chinese and all
others. In short, we have been impregnated with the blood of all peoples, and we
have never refused any race, creed, or nationality the hospitality of our homes, our
neighborhood and our living, meager as it is. We do not hate any race, creed or
color of mankind. We are of them all.

Accordingly in this national crisis we cannot and will not stand aside and see
those with undemocratic allegiances or psychoses betray our democracy to those
within and without who would destroy our democracy. We have recently surveyed
our country from the Paciﬁc to the Atlantic, and from Canada to Mexico, and we
know that fully ninety-ﬁve per cent of the rank and ﬁle of Americans want fair
play in all matters, whether in employment or otherwise. Those in the employing or
ruling classes who think and do otherwise, have their allegiances, consciously or
unconsciously, to the Emperor, King and Queen systems or the Nazi-Fascist systems
of other lands than ours.

It were far better to have one half the guns, airplanes, tanks and other instru-
ments of death for our arsenal of democracy created by- democratic, fair employ-
ment processes, than to produce twice the amount under Nazi-Fascist racially
intolerant processes.

Let the totalitarian armies and peoples see our United States democracy lifted
from the lip-service stage, and made the basis of fair, life-giving employment for
every one of our citizens! By this action you will take the very heart out of the

 

 

 

~ 29
cause of our enemies. Until then they are more or less justiﬁed in regarding our
democracy as hypocrisy.

We are living in a world gone mad. But as our democracy fashions the
strait-jackets and blackjacks of Army, Navy and Air Forces to capture the insane
who are making a shambles of the world, let us not forget to prepare and inject
into the insane the serum of fair employment, and fair democratic processes in
matters economic as well as in matters political in all our dealings with mankind.
Only in such a manner can the physician restore sanity to the insane.

May your committee proceed to its task in the thought that you are building
the strongest bulwark of defense to our democracy.

Please do not look upon your work as doing a favor to the Negroes of the
United States. The divine processes of justice will take care of them—who have
labored and suffered in this land through the centuries. Your task and our task is
to perfect and save our democracy. This is no time for gradualness in our work of
educating our citizens. It must be forthright, fair and quite as universal and
dramatic in its appeal as is our modern radio system in its genuineness and sin-
cerity. Tricks and devises, whether of law, business, organized labor, ﬁnance,
politics, religion or government officialdom must be abandoned without hesitancy.
Fair access must be given every human being under a democracy, to the bread of
life. We must all stand together or we will be conquered one by one, whether Jew
or Gentile, black or white, rich or poor, native born or foreign born, believer or
unbeliever. .

Employment blockades are as vicious and as murderous as naval and military
blockades. America must lift the blockade which for years on end has been jesuit-
ically and systematically laid down against the Negroes and other minority groups
in the matter of employment.

The opportunity to do this job, which, when done, will take its place beside the
job done by Abraham Lincoln, is in your hands. The sentiment of the masses is
with you. The eyes of the Nation, as well as the eyes of the enemies of our Nation,
and the eyes of the world at large are upon you. They see through all the tricks
of the blockade.

More than ﬁve hundred million people who live on this Paciﬁc Ocean area-
our future cooperative business partners»-are watching the results of your work.

May wisdom, courage and justice be alert in helping you in dealing with the
many near lunacies which will confront you on all sides in this task, as the facts
are brought before you in this and subsequent hearings and activities of your
committee.

In common with thousands of others, my services are at your command.

HUGH E. MACBETH,
Executive Secretary,
California Race Relations Commission.

Pearl S. Buck’s Open Letter to the Colored People of
of America

I venture to write this letter directly to you, the colored citizens of our
country. Some of you may know how frankly and constantly I have spoken to
white people about their obligations to you. Now I should like to speak to you of
the responsibility resting at this moment upon the colored Americans for the sur-
vival of human freedom. For the colored American stands today as a symbol, not
merely for his own race in one country, but for the hundreds of millions of other
men and women, colored and white, who are waiting for freedom and for the life
which democracy promises.

Who are these hundreds of millions? They are the people of India who on
their own soil wait for the opportunity to work out their own national life in their
own way. They are the peoples of all colonies in Asia and Africa, some more for-
tlmate, some less fortunate in their dependence upon governments. They are people
who are under no foreign rule but who are ruled without freedom by certain
classes and groups of their own race and kind. They are all those people, wherever
they are, who long for a society which gives them opportlmities not lessened
because of blood and birth.

I know that there are those among you who in natural bitterness think, if they
do not say, that it might be as well if Japan should win this war so that the white
man would be forced out of the lands of the colored people. But this is to misunder-
stand the fundamental meaning of this war. It is true that white people say they
believe in freedom and still do not go on to make everybody free, and yet the real
issue in this war is a single one—it is a war between the democracies who admit the
principle that men and women should think and speak and work in freedom and
the Axis rulers who deny freedom even as a principle.

If the democratic peoples win, there will be a chance to work out true democ-
racy. If the democratic peoples lose, there will be no further chance for a long time
even to try anything like freedom. Japan’s whole culture, ancient and modem, is
based on stern subjugation of the individual. And there is no reason for anyone to
expect freedom from the German rulers. This war, therefore, belongs to the colored
American as much as to the white American and they stand or fall together with
the rest of humanity. Never before has race meant so much and so 1ittle—so
much because it is upon this point of equality that the democratic peoples have
failed most disastrously to practice full democracy, and so little, because if the
Axis should win, color would not save or damn anyone. The freedom of colored
and white together would then be lost.

Faulty as our democracy is, the United States must be the leader in this war
for the right of peoples to be free—there is no other leader to whom we can look.
We have as. our great ally the old democracy of China. But China is not equipped
except as we can equip her for a military war. The main burden rests upon our
own country. It is inevitable, too, that after this war the United States must be the
leader in the peace. China will be deeply concerned in that peace, but there are

THE CRY FOR JUSTICE

*

By WILLIAM COWPER
(English Poet, 1731-1800)

‘  O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,
" Some boundless contiguity of shade,

Where rumor of oppression and deceit,
Of "unsuccessful or successful war,
Might never reach me more. My ear is pained,
My soul is sick, with every day’s report
Of wrong and outrage with which earth is ﬁlled.
There is no ﬂesh in man’s obdurate heart,
It does not feel for man; the natural bond
Of brotherhood is severed as the ﬂax
That falls asunder at the touch of ﬁre.
He ﬁnds his fellow guilty of a skin
Not colored like his own; and having power
To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause
Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.
Lands intersected by a narrow frith

Abhor each other. Mountains interposed
Make enemies of nations, who had else

Like kindred drops been mingled into one.

Thus man devotes his brother,-and destroys;
And, worse than all, and most to be deplored,

As human nature’s broadest, foulest blot,

Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat
With stripes, that Mercy, with .a bleeding heart,
Weeps when she sees inﬂicted on a beast.

concerned also the peoples of India and Malaysia, the Philippines, and all the con-
quered peoples in Europe and Africa. The United States must be prepared in mind
and spirit to lead all these toward freedom.

We are not prepared now. The division between colored and white in our own
country is dangerous, not only for ourselves but for that new world after the war
to which we all look with hope. You have a peculiar responsibility to that world, a
responsibility to think in terms of the whole human race, to think of freedom in the
largest possible sense, and to consider the most likely means by which freedom may
be established as a common human principle.

As for the white people of our country, you know them very well. There is
one group among them who have no race prejudices. All over this country I know
there are men and women who have an honest determination to work for real
freedom and equality. They are aware of how much and how wrongly the colored
American suffers from racial and economic discrimination. These you must uphold
by every means in your power, for should democracy not be victorious, they will have
to give their lives because they spoke and worked for your freedom, too. If the
enemy is the victor, you will return to slavery, but they will be killed.

The mass of the white Americans belongs to a second group. These willingly
or unwillingly acknowledge prejudice, but they are beginning to believe in varying
degrees that their prejudice is wrong. They are beginning to see or at least to
suspect that discrimination on the unjust ground of color works evil not only to
those who bear the burden of discrimination, but to those who harbor it, just as in
the old days, which permitted slavery, not only the slaves were harmed but the
slave owners too. Slavery is a double—edged knife in any society where it exists
and race discrimination is the aftermath of slavery.

The third white group in our country is smaller than the second but not as small
as the ﬁrst. It is made up of those white people in whom race prejudice is deeply
ingrained because tradition still holds them bound, or because their lack of intelli-
gence and economic opportunity demand a class yet lower than their own so that
they can feel superior to somebody. These white people are the enemies of freedom.
Should the Axis win, these would be its friends. They would rule this country under
the guidance of Hitler and the Japanese.

If the American white people belonged mostly to the first group, there Would
be no need for this letter. The work would be done. Those conditions under which
you are now living, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, would already have
disappeared. If the American people belonged mostly to the third group this letter
would not be printed at all. We would now be ﬁghting on the side of the Axis and
against the democracies and we would be planning a complete subjugation of all
the colored peoples in the world.

But the American white people belong mostly to the middle group, those who
have inherited or been trained in prejudice, but who because they have also inherited
or been trained in prejudice, but who because they have also inherited and been
trained in the American ideals of human freedom and equality now ﬁnd a serious
conﬂict within themselves. For the most part they honestly want to do right, but
they are afraid, because they see that this right will make great changes in our
national life. It is true of all human beings that they dread that which they do not
know, and it is especially true when what the white people have known has been a
tradition which has given them the advantage.

But still just at this moment our chance of freedom for all people is in these
troubled, undecided, yet on the whole honest white Americans most of whom hate
their inability to make practical their belief in freedom for all.

You see how great a thing I am asking. I am asking you to help this uncertain
white American to understand you as a human being, to trust you as his equal so
that he may be convinced that if you are given freedom equal to his, you will not
think of revenge and liberty only for yourselves, but still of ordered freedom and
equality for humanity. '

I do not excuse in any way those injustices and those cruelties which you have
borne. There is no excuse for them. You must neither forget nor forgive them,
but rather remember them, so that this remembrance, like the bread and wine, may
ﬁll you with fresh courage and new resolve. But when you remember the suffering,

 

 

 

 

 

5
which you have not deserved, do not think of vengeance, as the small man does.
Remember rather, as the great remember that which they have unjustly suffered,
and determine only that such suffering shall not be possible again for any human
being anywhere. ’

I ask you, colored people of the United States, to stand by this great mass of
your white countrymen in this imperfect democracy of ours, where nevertheless the
hope of democracy is still clearest. They need your help. By all that you do, help
them to see and believe that white people need not be afraid in a country whose
citizens whatever their color, are equal in all ways. Every time one of you conducts
himself, as so many of you do, with honesty and magnanimity and dignity, you are
helping white men and women toward a real democracy. If you are aware of the
struggle in the average white person, you will be patient with him as he gropes
toward the meaning of freedom and human equality. It is a difficult and unfamiliar
road for most white people, and they are fearful because they are being driven along
it by the trend of world events. You will help them to reach the right end more
quickly if you determine that though you will not cease to press for the freedom
and the equality in_ all respects which are your rights without a doubt, yet that you
will assert those proper demands not in a spirit of hatred and revenge and selﬁsh-
ness, but in a spirit which by the very manner in which it shows itself proves you
the equal of any human being.

I know that this is no small thing to ask of any people. Certainly it is asking
you to be better than the white man has been. But indeed you must be better
than the white man has been. For if those who have suffered learn nothing from
their suffering, then the world is lost indeed. Who can ﬁght so well for freedom as
those who know what it is to be deprived of it?

It is essential now that colored Americans see what the white man carmot see.
Your vision must be clearer than his. You must not let him for a moment he
satisﬁed with less than our American ideal of freedom for everyone. For there will
be no freedom for the white man either if there is not freedom for the colored.
If democracy did not win, the white peoples would have to make themselves into a
great standing army, highly trained, constantly prepared to keep the colored peoples
subdued, and there could be no greater slavery than that necessity. It is possible,
in this grave moment, that in such a place as Australia, there might be white people
made slaves by their conquerors, just as white people now are slaves in certain
countries and no less slaves because their rulers are other white men. The issue
today is not one of race, colored or white. It is freedom.

You who know most bitterly what it is not to have freedom should therefore
consecrate yourselves to the crusade for freedom and equality and you must ennoble
the crusade by the way in which you carry it on. It is not only an American crusade
—it is a human crusade and you are in the vanguard of it today and not the white
people. Those who have deprived you of your rights and have tolerated and encour-
aged your irresponsibility as citizens so that you have been injured by patronage as
much as you have by injustice, they are the ones who have failed the ideals of our
country. It may well be that in the future now very close the peoples of Asia and
Africa will look to you more than to any other Americans to see to it that the
world does not divide as Japan would have it on the false line of color, but solely
on the single issue of freedom for all.

It is you who carry the ﬂag.
PEARL S. BUCK.
—Excerpt from The California Eagle, March 5th, 1942.

Pearl S. Buck’s Address to the Colored Leadership of
the United States of America

(Delivered at the commencement exercises of Howard University at
Washington, D. C., June 5th, 1942.)

I believe this is the ﬁrst time in my life that I have ever made a commence-
ment address. The invitations I have had I have refused until now because it has
always seemed to me presumptious to offer advice or even to forecast for those
who have not yet entered it the sort of life that lies ahead of college. Life is so
individual a thing in ordinary times, so much depends on the person who is to live
it, that all I have ever felt I could say was easily said in a sentence-—the only way
to ﬁnd out anything about life is to begin to live it as heartily as you can. So what
was the use of making a speech about what could be said in one sentence?

But I accepted the invitation this particular year to this particular university
for a very special reason. These are not ordinary times, and this is no ordinary
graduating class. Today the individual has to contribute to the human demand
of our times. Today he misses too much. You are not only a group of individuals
beginning your individual lives or in a country which is more or less of a democ-
racy. You are a specially privileged group not even because of the education which
you have begun here under such excellent circumstances. But you are privileged
because at this moment in human history you are a group with a special opportunity
and a special duty to the times which none but you can perform, and this because
of what you have been ‘born, as well as because of what you have received.

Let us review your situation at this moment. You are Americans. You are
Americans of old families and not of recent immigration. This means that for some
generations your families have lived in a country which has believed in democracy
and freedom of the individual even if it has not practiced human equality. You
belong somewhere near the top of your group or you would not be here today, at a
commencement at a good university. You have been accustomed to some ﬁnancial
security, and certainly to some intellectual background or you would not have
considered it worth while to spend the time and the effort and the money on a
university education. Obviously, you are well above the average of all Americans.
One needs only to look at you to see that this is true.

And yet I know that I would not be saying anything worth saying today if I
did not speak of what I know also to be true—that in the heart of everyone of you,
whether you talk about it or not, there is doubt, not about yourselves, but about
your place in society. It is only inevitable that many, if not all of you, are asking
how much you can actually accomplish, even with your unusual equipment, and how
relentlessly the barriers of race prejudice in your country will hold you back.

I know that some of you by carefully living within a world within a world
can perhaps manage fairly well, in a limited way, to make a life. There is a way
in which you can live which avoids the area race prejudice almost entirely and
which within the circumscribed area of a small nation subject to a larger one, can
give you reasonable security. Those of you who tend naturally to retreat into
security will probably choose that world. Who can blame you if you do? There

has been nothing to encourage you to break down the walls which race prejudice
puts about you, and it has been individual wisdom, perhaps, to live within the walls
rather than to waste one’s self and spend one’s energies in trying to break down
what has been until now a relentless barrier.

Had this not been the year 1942, I would not have come here to make this
address, because I would not myself have seen any way to break down that barrier,
short of disastrous force, and I would not have felt that I had either the right to
urge you to break it down, or to accept its limitations.

For I will confess that I have been completely perplexed by this race prejudice
in my own country. Having lived always in China, where there is almost no race
prejudice as such, I did not know my own country in this regard. Even my four
years in college in a southern town did not teach me the full meaning of it. College
in my day and especially for young women was a limiting and not an enlarging
experience. I had come from a larger place into a smaller one when I came here
to college and I went back to China immediately to my home there when I had
ﬁnished.

It was only some eight years ago when I returned to my own country to live
that I became aware of the amazing fact that Americans were actually divided into
two parts, and that the two parts were living as though they were two separate
nations, except that they had the same government. This seemed to me a very
alarming and dangerous situation in a democracy and I at once began to inquire
into it. I listened to both colored and white Americans talk and explain their points
of view and their experiences of each other, and the division grew deeper daily as I
came to understand the full reality of race prejudice and its effect upon both colored
and white people.

Without an emergency to quicken a social change, what could be done? I tried
to think as one of the minority—not difficult, because in China I had all my life
belonged to a minority race, there the white race, and as a white, in spite of my very
close relations and even integration into Chinese life, I had suffered some of the
inevitable experiences of those who are in the minority in any country. But I had
to think newly. What, I asked myself, would I do if I belonged to a group in my
own country against which race prejudice worked?

I remember one of the ﬁrst things I thought I would do would be to devote
myself to the development of all superior colored children. Obviously the colored
people lack leadership. We hark back too much to people who are dead. Crispus
Attucks, hero that he was, is dead. So is Booker Washington and so is Harriet
Tubman. We need living heroes of our people. I remember how forcibly this was
once brought to my attention in an essay contest for colored students of which I
was one of the judges. In many scores of essays the students, both high school
and college, mentioned the same half dozen heroes of their people. Almost the only
living one was Dr. Carver. Now I know Dr. Carver’s work and have heard him talk
about it and I agree to his greatness as a scientist. But one living great man is not
enough for any people. We might add, I think, Paul Robeson, and we might put at
his side Dorothy Maynard and Marian Anderson, as great in their peculiar gifts
and the use they make of them. But these and a few others are still not enough
for thirteen million people. '

So I thought, we who are colored ought to watch for our genius children and at
the expense of all of us, if by no other way, we ought to develop those children and
make them feel responsible to their own people so that they will not simply use
what has been given them for selﬁsh ends, but for the good of their people. This
was no foreign thought to me, for in China this has long been a custom. Any bright
boy—I am sorry to say girls were not included until recently—might be chosen by
his village for special education and development, with the express purpose of his
reﬂecting honor upon his region and his people. The Chinese have always valued
their genius individuals, because they, in common with other peoples of the East
believe that a people ought to be guided by their great men. For the same reason
they value government officials relatively little. When they are in confusion and
trouble they do not look to their government but to their great men for wisdom
and spiritual leadership. Thus the people of India have looked and do still look to
Gandhi for wisdom.

 .a;

So it seemed to me that here in my own country a subject people could not look
for understanding treatment to a government made up exclusively of persons who
belonged to a race which was ridden with prejudice against color. Instead they must
look to their own great individuals, and that they might ﬁnd those great individuals,
they must seek them out and help them to grow and not allow them to be lost in the
grind of poverty and the lack of opportunity.

To be sure, this would be a slow process. At least a generation would have to
pass before there could be results. But there would, I thought, he results sooner or
later, not only in leadership for the colored, but in opening the eyes of the blind white
people and forcing them to see that a man’s color made no difference in his ability
to achieve great things.

In the long run of national life the training of all unusually able children would
result in the bettering of conditions and even in some measure work against race
prejudice, for history shows that two groups tend to approach each other with lessen-
ing prejudice as they become more alike in their economic and social standards. Yet
to do this it would be necessary to develop colored industry and colored enterprise in
all ﬁelds, so that colored leaders could ﬁnd scope.

The second step that I advocated, then, having come thus far, was the building
of such enterprise. I remember a speech I once made in New York to a colored audi-
ence, in which I endeavored to stir them to some such point of view, urging them to
take their money and build opportunity for colored enterprise instead of putting their
money into such things as Father Divine’s heavens. I said, in short, if the white
people don’t give you a chance in their world, make your own world, and break down
race prejudice from your end by taking white employees into your enterprises. I got
a good deal of criticism for that speech. My hearers didn’t much like it. Father
Divine didn’t much like it either, and sent somebody to tell me so.

All this was in a sense encouraging. It showed me that the colored people of
our country feel they want to be in our nation and not just living here on suiferance.
They want to be a part of all American institutions, and they have a right to be.
The ideal is for colored and white to work together, competing only as individuals
and not as groups in our society. But the more I listened and observed and thought
the more impossible it seemed to me that this ideal situation could be realized, at
least within a time to be measured in generations and not in centuries. Race
prejudice, it seemed to me as I watched it work, could simply checkmate any colored
person, unless he had a peculiar individual genius, as a great singer has or a great
chemist. But these in any people are very few indeed, and what of the many who
are intelligent and able and yet cannot contribute what they have because they have
not a unique genius? /

The hard practical question remains, what are we going to do with race preju-
dice? If we yield to it and build a world within a world, it simply encourages an
evil thing. Moreover it deepens the nation’s division. Yet if we try to force our
Way into the white man’s world, he resists us with the full strength of his prejudice.
Moreover, although clamoring at the white man’s gate has a nuisance value, yet it is
degrading to have to keep clamoring for that which‘ is our right. It has an effect
upon the colored race that is not good. The continued practical state of inferiority,
however unjust and undeserved, does affect very much the colored individual and
indeed the whole group. Similarly the false assumption of superiority because of
race affects just as unfortunately the white man and his group. It affects, in short,
the whole life of the nation. A lot of people are wasting a lot of time and thought
and energy and emotion on something which is sheer nonsense. But there it is.
What are we going to do about it?

What are you going to do about it? You can do one of two things—you can
accept the situation as it is, you can consider that it will be safest for you to stay
inside your own nation, the Negro nation of a white America that will gradually
cease to develop in its growth toward true democracy because of its own division.
Or you can determine that you are going to help America to be that true democracy
of which We dream.

It is more than a dream—it has now become a necessity that if we are to win
the war and to achieve the peace our country can only do so as a democracy and a
united democracy. I tell you frankly that since this war has swept the world into

its blaze I have stopped thinking about the rights of the colored people here—I am
asking today only one question-—-how can every citizen in this country fulﬁll his
responsibility as a citizen of our democracy? I repeat, it is as a democracy that we
will win this war. If we cease to be a democracy, we will not win this war and
there will not be any peace if we don’t win the war.

Therefore it is not enough merely to join the army and the navy and the air
force if they will have us, and to do nothing if they won’t. It is not enough to pour
our savings into war bonds. It is not enough to put our lives into factories and war
work as far as we are allowed. We will not win this war unless we win it as a
nation where human beings are equal and human rights are respected. The peace
will be no peace unless it is based upon the principles of human equality.

In profound belief in democracy, then, in deepest love of our country, let us
now realize that when we work for democracy in our own nation we are in the most
important sense working for victory in war and in peace.

Therefore today I believe that discrimination in our country must go, because
until it does, we will not have won the war. We cannot ﬁght for freedom unless we
ﬁght for freedom for all. We are not better than fascists if we ﬁght for the freedom
of one group and not another, for the beneﬁt of one race and not another, for the
aggrandizement of a part and not the betterment of the whole. And we must be
better than fascists. VVe cannot allow in our nation the evil root of something which
Hitler has developed into a system of slavery the like of which the world has never
seen, where the individual is nothing but a piece of property seized and used and
tossed aside by a robber government. Japan’s militarists, too, have for generations
so conceived the individual to be nothing but a tool, and the history of Japan during
the last four generations has been the history of the struggle between the individual
and the possessor state. And the beginning of that struggle anywhere is always in
the degredation of a class, the condemnation for some trivial cause, of a group of
individuals.

It is ironic that in Germany the death grip of the state today upon the individual
arose not out of too much unity but too little. Germany has never really achieved
a sense of nationhood. A loose handful of states, her peoples have longed for unity.
But in the desire to be integrated into a nation, they have handed themselves over to
a handful of persons who have wrecked them not only as a nation but as individuals.

We, too, are not a uniﬁed people. We have sprung from many sources and many
places, and we too put our hope in political unity. Perhaps that is why we exalt
more than most democracies to the power of our government. In a common gov-
ernment we ﬁnd a sort of unity which otherwise we lack. Perhaps that is why we
look to government instead of to our wise men, as the Chinese and Indians do. But
this desire to be uniﬁed must not lead us in the direction of the Nazis, where ﬁrst a
race was despised and then where the every individual which differed from the
unifying force was eliminated. The danger in race prejudice always is that it tends
to lump people together, and to ignore the individual. Any nation which tolerates
prejudice against one group in its people carries inside itself the potentiality of
developing fascism, as a persistent sore is always a potential cancer. It has to be
watched, and the body is never safe until the sore is cut out.

The equality of opportunity, therefore, which you have not been given in your
country has now become more than an individual handicap, more than a group mis-
fortune. It has become a national danger of the sharpest sort, a rock upon which
our whole nation may founder. It is now necessary that all of us who believe with
all our hearts in democracy work together to bring about human equality in the
world of which our nation is only a part.

There are nations in the world, and great ppoples, who may be our friends or
our enemies in years soon to come, depending upon whether or not we can believe in
and practice human equality. I speak of the peoples of Russia and China and
India. These three peoples, combined, make most of the world’s population. Com-
bined, they hold the future of the world between them. And two of them, China. and
Russia, are already resolved on the equality of races, and India wants her freedom.
They have suffered, two of them, India and China, severely, India disastrously, from
the effects of race prejudice. In a world where these nations will have power, and
that is already today, they will not tolerate discrimination between peoples. It is
