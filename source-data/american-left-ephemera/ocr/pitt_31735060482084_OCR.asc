I A Being gay used to be the scariest thing in the world

— to me. And I  it’s probably the scariest thing
for most people. '

It I remember when Ilwas about W12, my best friend

told me she wished I was a boy. I didn’t say any-
thing, but I wished I was too. That way we could
have always been together. She's married now and
has two kids.’ ’

Fromage 14 on, I had crushes on men and women. '
I didn’t know ve_r_y much about sex till Iwas 21,
but I had.a lot of strong sexual feelings.

‘ I wanted to sleep with a woman since I was19;
Every once in awhile I’d have dreams about women
touching me. Sometimes l’d masturbate to Playboy

I . vcenterfolds. I thought about going to a gay bar to

_ meet someone, but I was too scared to do it.

" Once, in a luncheonette, I was very attracted to a
girl and she was looking at me too. late real quick
and left. Onenight a few years ago, me and a good
friend were on her bed watching TV. When the show

' was over, she said I didn’t have to go. I..left very fast

' and never said a word to her about it. We were both
pretty‘ lonely then and it would have been nice to
stay‘ together. I

I was so scared of my feelings that I wouldn’t even I”
talk to anyone about them. A good friend once said
shethought I was a lesbian. I had a boyfriend then,
and I told her that he 'wouldn’t think I was gay.

A, couple of years ago at a women’s liberation meet-
ing, a woman said she knew some lesbians and she
asked if any of‘i-is wanted to meet them. I wanted
to, butll was afraid to say anything because then
people might think I was one. I. sometimes got books
on homosexuality and hid them, so no onelwould
wonder why I’ was so interested in the subject.

I thought my feelings were good, not wrong like
society says.‘ But I was scared, so I tried to be normal,
like a lot of gay people do.

When I was 21,1 started going with a guy. He was i
the ﬁrst person I ever had sex with. _I didn’t like him
very much ‘and I hated sex with him. But what choice
did I have? If I left him, I’d just have to try to find
another boyfriend (I was too afraid to look fora girl-
friend). While I was with this guy, I had a crush on a
woman I worked with. I finally broke off with him
after a year and a half‘. ”

I dated men a bit, and about a year later I began living
with another guy. I liked him a lot and we had a
pretty good friendship. But I didn’t like sex with him
either, and I tried to fuck as little as possible. I tried
to break off with him a couple of times, but it was too

I hard.

 

Then everything went boom. I wanted tojsleep with her, ‘
she didn’t want to. She wouldn’t see me. I was crushed.
She went back to men, and I tried to get myself back to-. . '
gether with women." (We were both straight then and I’m

My lesbian feelings were getting stronger. I knew I

really wanted to be with a» woman. I. tried to get close to
the girlfriend of one ‘of our male friends. Nothing ever ‘i * T

After living with this guy for about two and a half years, '

I met a woman I really liked. (That was almost two years

I ago.) I was scared out of my mind. After a month and a
half of being friends, I worked up the courage- to tell her
how I felt. She said she loved me too. ‘

I was so happy. I told my boyfriend I wanted  to

leave - I didn’t need him now.

happy‘ to say she’s gay now too!) .

 ,\ it ' « I started to :‘come out.” I started: talking to friendsabout
- ' my gay feelings. I spent most of my time with women and
began to feel more and more relaxed with them and with , , A

_ -my“feeliriTgs.  ‘began jtouchzing .peop1e.and  affecfion-

_ A year ago January, Islept with -a woman for the first time.
It was the first timel ever liked sex. I was 27. She was _
20 and had been gayifor years. We lived together for a few
months, but we didn’t gétalong so well.. We hardly knew

- each other before we ‘slept together. '

Lastaspring I started hanging around with "a group_of gay

guys and women. We started going to gaybars and had a _

lot of good times together. Gay women’s, liberation meet- “
‘ ings were starting then too. ‘They were a good way to meet. 9 "

people. V

Last July, two gay girlfriends and Istarted living together. i -x I
I’m,now living with three ‘other gay women. There"’ve been’
"some ‘hard times, but mostly it’s been real good. ’ ‘

What’s also goodis that there’s now a big, group of us who 
hang around together. We don’t have to be lonely any more.

I still get very down sometimes. Like I feel a couple of

women have fucked me over recently. And I still feel"con-
a ,fused about my life. Where do lwant to be and "with who? _
' ‘Whatdo I want to do? I

But even though beinggayhas been very painful at times, ' V ,
mostly it’s been the best time of mylife. I’ve had some ._
beautiful times with women, both in and out of bed. -~I’ve

danced and sung more than ever before. I have more friends

than I ever did and I feel like we’re building a strong corn-
munity here and with other gay women’ across the country.

i

I feel sick when I thinkof all those years I hid my
feelings. All those years when I was ‘afraid to think I was"
a lesbian. When even the word “lesbian” was scary.

No one should have to be afraid of being gay.‘ Me. and-a
lot of my sisters and brothers aren’t scared any more,
We’re out of our closets. We’re gay and we

feel good about it. Join us.

This was the reason I found the courage " ” “ " . - . - ’

to go to a Gay—Straiglit dance at B.U. I
walked around. shaking, nervous. afraid

I of seeing someone I knew. but secretly
,, hoping to see a familiar face. I didn‘t.

Just before the dance ended and l was
feeling disappointed and afraid that the
whole evening would be a waste. I
mustered up 63I1C<‘.{"."'? courage to talk to
a woman who had sat down beside me.
My first contact with Gay Wonien‘s
Liberation! She told me about a rock
concert the next night and I showed up

there, hoping to get to know some peo-

ple.

. No familiarfaces, but again at the end of

the evening the woman I had talked to

the night before came up to me and gave
me the number of Gay Women’s Liberation.
I left the concert in a cloud of anticipation.
my thoughts being heightened by a group
of women calling a greeting to me ‘Sister!!‘-
it was a beautiful feeling.

The Wednesday after the dance I went to
my first GWL meeting. I sat and watched
and listened and felt the ideas. and the

beautiful vibes in the room. I started talking

to a woman who worked near where I go

to school and we exchanged phone numbers.

I talked to some other women and danced
for a while and then rode my bicycle home
elated and happy.

From that meeting I found out about
various other activities happening in the
Gay Community. I got involved in the

gay modern dance group, communal dinners
going to meetings, taking Karate, going to
parties and going to the bar and just spend-
ing time with gay women making friends,
getting close to them and loving them.

One night I stopped over at one of th

gay women’s houses because I was in the
area and ended up talking to the women
there until three in the morning. I stayed
over that night and from that point I started
getting close to some of the women in the
house and spent more and more of my

time there.

Between all these wonderfui feelings of
gettingclose to and loving women who
were my friends there was this subtle voice
always popping up, reminding me I was
still a student going through my fourth,
but not last year of college.

I mention this because as each day passes
school becomes more and more irrelevent
to my life and I feel very thwarted as a
gay woman in a straight male institution-
which proclaims to be so ‘liberal’.

I have officially moved into the house
that I stopped by to visit that night and
feel my life in context of the women I
live with and the friends I have and the
things I do with them.

School is an effort to sit through boring
classes-deep in thought about whether it’s
worth it for that degree- that piece of paper
that isn’t going to make finding a ‘better’
job any easier as a gay woman. A ‘better’

job by whose standards‘? If they are society’s

Sometimes I feel like the woman’s movement gets itself
into these tig_htassed institutionalized trips and ends up
mak‘irig 'yot“i"feél"like ydu"ié’ balck’ in“ the family or the
church -or school. _In other words, sometimes we just
can’t escape our own rhetoric and dogma, and end up
becoming a very repressive thing.

When the women’s movement first started and a lot

of us rejected traditional notions-- oppressive notions--
of what it meant to be a woman, of what was permissible
female behavior, we were left with no identity. Like
almost all the ways we used to act just wouldn’t do in
the context of a life as a revolutionary feminist. So
we took off on this incredible fantasy and made up an
idea of what the ‘new woman’ would be and proceeded
to almost destroy ourselves and each other trying to
live up to our projection right now, immediately, here
in the midst of the monster. We rejected the politics
of guilt, but we used the tactic of guilt to push each
other and ourselves to change.

It was a lot of bullshit, because developing into women
with revolutionized consciousness is a process, not an
act or a decision. Moreover, it is ridiculous at this
early point, with so few women, relatively, involved

in it, to pretend that we could set up a model so soon.
I mean, we come to the .women’s movement as pretty
demented fucked-up distorted personalities. That’s
what oppression does to you.

Like, macho and monogamy are the two best examples
I can think of. ‘Macho’ and ‘monogamy’ are hard to
define in the way that the women’s movement uses
them. But generally when you’re called ‘macho’, they’re
trying to say that you’re acting butch, that you’re
playing at being a‘ man, that you have an intimidating
personality. that you’re aggressive. Mostly when you’re
being called macho as an attack they mean that you’re
generally acting like some male stud. (‘Macho’ comes from
the Latin word inacliismo which basically means male
chauvanist p;g.i)

‘Monogainy’ 9”) a word used in a million different ways.
It usually reitérs to two people who are lovers. and who
may he intc =.‘d4.‘l‘i other to the point of exclusion of

instead of with him.

it seems to me that growing up female and  in
Amerika is what intimidates and alienates women and
makes us afraid of strengths of any sort. But just
rejecting macho as inherently bad, as a rule we set
up, doesn’t deal with the real problem which is that
men have always used strength against us. against all
oppressed peoples, and it is the misuse of strength
which leads to domination, not the existence or style
of strength.

Idoift worry about macho in women--in fact I encourage
it-bccau 591 fee} the thing we have to worry about the
most is how we are all going to get out of the behavior
and gestures of feminity; how we’re going to stop

seeing ourselves as weak and passive. Women who are
trying to be strong and tough have a rough time of it.
because we don’t have any forms to be that in. I

I was .one of the women who worked on the
first issue of Lavender Vision. When that
issue came out we were all in a really
excited, energetic, hopeful time. Since
then-since we spread all those great vibes
in‘ the last paper, lots of us have gotten
really down and have gone through hard
times trying to live out the changes in our
heads that we shared with you in the first
issue. The response to our first issue was
so positive that I feel we ought to share
with you some of our experiences living
out a lavender vision. '

One reason for all the joy we felt in November
was the new energy we got in forming a little
community with each other. We’d go to the bars
together and dance in circle dances a lot, dancing

freely without partners. We had parties a lot. We’d
have communal dinners, we visited a lot; and if

we were really into doing something when night
came and we felt good together a bunch of us
would spend the night together. Things weren’t.
really heavy, just easy. And we all felt the intense
warmth of meeting so many women we wanted to
get to know and care about after years of loneli-
ness and isolation from open relationships with
other women.

bﬂ Ka.’c2_

 

Some nights I’d be dancing at Jacques’ and
dancing around me would be five or six women
I was attracted to and wanted to be close to. I.

, wanted us all to be able to be friends together.

Sometimes I wanted to come home and be with
one person, focusing just on her; other times I’d

feel so together with people that I’d want
a few of us to spend the night together. And
for a while things began to flow like that.

At work at the gas station sometimes l’d
Shut Out the Lrudenessof the customers by
dreaming of how I was getting stronger in
karate with my sisters, how we could protect
each other. How someday soo ii there would
be a women’s clinic staffed by women, a women’s
center with women doing job and legal counsel-
ling and with room for car mechanics, karate,
carpentry, and wiring classes and rooms for
meetings, parties, and dinners. How with my
sisters I would fight and build a world where
it will be the men like my father or my boss
or the president of the college I went to who
would be declared sick and I and my friends
will be sane.

But my dreams had to work out in a real
world. Disappointment all around. Take the
women’s skills classes.....

There are a bunch of characteristics that exist in peoplled.
In sexist society, some of those characteristics aretcéil e
feminine (gentleness, delicacy,‘ SW€€U1€S$-, SUl(3iP0T W line
ness, emotion, etc.) Some of them are calle rnascu

( strength, power, aggression, arrogance, technical compe-
tency. achievement, etc.) low the problem V(;’ltl}l1S€?C15lII1
isn’t that men have technical competence an P _Y51C3
prowess: the problem is that ONLY men can legimately
have those characteristics, and that their skigls anbd en
aptitudes are used against womenand there plre ecpm
perverted. Technology, like physical streng_t , lstflwt k
inherently bad. It’s the oppressive applicationst a ree .
In the hands of the right peoples (oppressed P699165)
almost all competencies can become constructive

energy sources.

So if we in the won cn’s movement reject as ‘male’ every
characteristic assigned to men by pig SOCl€,t)', then W3 Y9
accepting their sexist categories and I don t understand
how we intend to win our war. If women start strutting
around (instead of swishing about) and start wearing .
leather jackets (instead of dainty cloth coats)and chewing
on toothpicks and swearing a lot and getting into fights
(instead of sitting at home polishing our toenails), well
that doesn’t seem to me such a crisis. I’m worried ab0Ut
our tendencies to be submissive and to eat more shit than
is good for our souls, to subordinate our struggle to
other struggles out of guilt, to be wimpy and scared and
paralyzed. ’

Once it is not a dramatic act to walk down the street
holding hands with our girlfriends, once rejecting.r_ape- _
minded advances isn’t guerilla theatre, once wanting to be.
a plnriber isn’t ‘cute’---then we may be free enough to —
develop whole new ways of being strong.

-I don’t understand what feminists mean when they say
. - 3
we should totally reject all role-playing. _ ldori t understand
what I would do, how I would act, if] didn t role-play.
It’s not like we’re so free, our vibes are so clear, and we are
so unfeterred that there is some ‘natural‘ way of being.
One makes decisions about one’s behaviour every time
she acts in any way. Like when I stopped wearing
miniskirts and makeup, and I wondered how I should
dress. feminists told me to just dress with whatever
was at hand and was practical. .‘\ow that. is ri:.‘.— ..'=.:lous.

It’s the same with defenses. Feminists are always talking
about breaking down ‘defenses. ‘.3/ell_that seems to me

to be suicidal. We re living in this evil jungle where it
takes all our energies to survive intact and the last thing

I plan to be is defenseless. The women’s movement
should help us develop BETTER defenses, it seems to me.

It should help us develop more control over our defenses,
so that we are able to let them down when we’re sure
it’; safe. But who the fuck can win a war without
self-defense on every level. I will not give up my I _ 
aggressiveness and m_v_ macho because I want to survive 
until the time that they become irrelevant to my

happiness.

_ I couldn’t look around at us. Even though it 
was a women’s class it wasn’t a C1355 where the

be felt and where we really grew close through .
the class. I had always felt really weak and clumsy
and the uptight feeling and competitiveness I
felt in the class were too much. I quit. ‘

In January some of us started a karate class
of gay women. I feel more spontaneous in this
class, more encouragement to become stronger
and tougher. And we feel freer to hug each
other, to play as well as work, and to appreciate
the sensuality of our bodies. We also do a lot of
sparring, more than other women’s classes I know
of. I think that’t partly because we’re open to
really loving each other and that allows us to
trust each other more.

Back to November. To ‘create a growing
community we needed some way for people to
get and stay in touch. A phone number. A—
place for meetings. The people I lived With ’
had purposely gotten a large house so it could
be a place to have meetings and parties and to
be a place communications passed through. So
we used our house for meetings, people dropped
in alot to talk, and our phone number was
put in the Phoenix. I think that was a good
thing to do because we really needed these things.

Thenthere’sanother piece of dogma that a lot of us
dragged with us from the straight woman’s movement

and are still dragging around in the gay woman’s movement.
Smashmonogamy. In the very beginning of the feminist
movement I remember that we were all real concerned
with smashing unequal oppressive dependent power
relations. Then Weathermen ( a sexist male-dominated,
military oriented organization) came out with a smash-
monogamy- of- any -sort- line. And you could see a

real change in the politics of the women’s movement, cause
lguess it felt it had.to top any line about women th .L -

lhave urged women to smash their monogamies lots of.
times. Their heterosexual monogamies. ldid that because
it is hard for me to conceive in this point of history any-
thing very liberated happening between one man and one
woman. I did that because it’s hard for me to understand
why women with generally high consciousness spend

their energies in intimate struggle with men. But I didn’t
do it because the form of monogamy is somehow inherently
destructive. Like ldon‘t‘think I rneant-smash monogamy.
I think I meant smash those relationships, or smash the
bad parts of them. lt’s not the intensity , the monogamy s
of a relationship that makes or breaks it....it’s the content
of the relationship.

When Weathermen said smash _rnonogamy they meant

that’ each woman should put out for lots of boys instead
ofjust one. That’s not exactly my idea of the road to
liberation. What we really want to smash is domination,
stifling possessiveness, manipulation, brutality, etc. and
those things turn up all the time in all kinds of relationships

I guess dogma is a way not to deal with the actualities

of our lives. When your main concern is smashing
monogamy, that leaves a lot of different kinds of relation-
ships that don’t get scrutinized and criticized so much.
When you attack women for being macho because it

scares you, you don’t have to deal with your own timid-ity,
your own oppression.

I amlinvolved, as you might guess, in a very intense,

close monogamous relationship. And a lot of my friends
in the movement have been laying down subtle criticisms
of that. But so far, no one has really been upset about the
monogamy. It’s’an excuse for other things. Like some
people have been upset because Ihaven‘t seen them much
and instead of saying they miss me and feel rejected, they
say smash monogamy. Some of my sisters feel real
threatened by my being closer to ‘afendy than with them.
Somestraight women feel very freaked out that two
women =:.r.n actually love each other with so much intensity.
These straight women are really uptight, because they
criticize us on the basis of ‘correct’ ideas they got from
their heterosexual experiences, as if those ideas could
possibly relate to our Lavender Vision. Moreover, when
they see two women really digging each other,_then they
knowthat lesbianism is for REAL and they get a bit
scared that it might zap in on them.

But what happened was that as the only gay
woman living there I got to be a contact person
so I knew a lot about what was happening that
other people didn’t. I tried to pass on that
information but all that meant was that after

a while somehow my conversations with my

new friends had to do with what was happening
and where, where we were wanted to speak, which
people were interested in working on a gay
newspaper, and so on. I think there will

always be some of us in that role until we have
a women’s center.

Meanwhile I was meeting lots of gay women
who I was.attracted to and wanted to get to
know. I slept with a few of them andthat brought
on -a whole new series of problems, questions we all
wondered about. _

I thought of sleeping with these women pretty
much as a spontaneous thing that grew out of feeling
close to them. I wanted to relate to many women
because I was just getting to know a few women and
didn’t want to artificially create a whole intense rela~
tionship with a woman I hardly knew yet. But I had
spent a year and a half in the women’s movement
thinking about the way men treat women: one night
stands being just an ego trip about being able to lay any
chick, men wanting women to be “sexually liberated”--
meaning they could sleep with any of us any time Without
having. to make a commitment. And then there was a
rhetoric we had developed in women’s liberation about
sisters, rail supporting each other and
groxvir:-g strong together without doing any of the
trips on each other men '  to 

5'10."

;.L4\.

One of the reasons people give for their ‘smash monogamy’
line is that collectivity is better than individuality. They

say that it is better to get your sense of ill-gntity and security
from a group of close sisters, than from just one person.
Well, in the last few years in the women’s movement, I have
not seen too many collectives provide any kind of stable
support for any individual. I was in a very tight disciplined,
close collective all last year and looking back at it now, I
can’t remember a time in my life that Ifelt so weak and

so dependent. Instead of being dependent on one person, I
was dependent on the ‘collective‘- - not really on the other
women in the collective,just on the collective. But the
‘collective’ didn’t exist on it’s own, outside of being .made
up of all of us. And because everythingwas so fucking

/

"collective’ we never really were able’ to build relationships

inside it which gave us what we needed.,

A

I also haven’t seen many collectives that last too long.

The form of collective is an experimental one. A lthough
my collective last year was the mostimportant political
experience lever had, second to coming out, I took a

cure

Questions just swam around in our heads as
this women’s consciousness spread throughout
our community: is it making sex objects out of
women to really dig the warmth and passion of
each other’s bodies? how do I just accept that I
care for women without doing all these trips of
“now that we’ve slept together. do I love her?”
how can I be really open to letting our relation-
ship grow when I’m afraid of being really close?
even though I feel like sisters with all these woman,
how can I be honest and admit that I feel close to ,
this one and not so close to that one? why am I
so surprised to find out that this woman in the
bar who seems so into role-playing has realized
a lot ofthings about sex roles that we talk about
as feminists? when am I being macho and when
am I being strong?

We-all need to answer these questions and
others. Unfortunately, confusion came about in
lots of our lives as we had open (instead of closet)
relationships. We gave each other support to try and
work out our relationshops in more liberated \2v'2=.vs.
but that support sometimes seemed like 'an incred-
ible pressure never to fuck things up or to all of
a sudden ‘wonderful new unhungup sisters. Some
of us were too afraid to relate at all for awhile and
withdrew. Meetings were often overwhelmed by the
tensions between ex-lovers. Our energy was drained
because our community had become such a confusing
and painful place to be.

 

iotof losses in it. We all did. I’m. not too sure ho‘ lfeel

I about collectives, but I’ll never throw myself, lose myself,

in one again like I did last year. ' . '

With Wendy I feel very secure. It gives us a lot of strength‘ '

to be very certain of being loved. lhave never done

good politics, or lived a nice life except when l was feeling
good and strong. And being a lesbian in this society requires
a lot of strength.

Until there is actually some form which looks better to
me, not in theory or fantasy--but in concrete practicé
than my monogamous relationship with Wendy, I
don’t see why I should smash monogamy. Although i
I wouldn’t have said this last year, I now forsee a post-
revolutionary situation where a whole spectrum of forms

/

exists, all sorts of ‘l.L1mbCl.‘S, all sorts of different levels ~ »
- of collectwity. I’m not going to give up_ the best-relationship

of my life because in the context of the straight women’s
movement I developed a theory whichsounded real - ,
radical. I want to win a revolution which gains the goods 
tor me. not one which requires I strip myself of the few
things which make me feel good.

Since lcame out and since I got into self-defense, I’ve
never felt better about myself. For me, macho and
monogamy have been the wonder drugs that my women’s
consciousness has produced, to defend against the

virus of dogma. ' I

other kinds of roles and oppressions came up.
too, Here we were, all of us in the process of
discovering and developing our strengths. But even
as we grew stronger and began to grow out of our
unskilled position. scars of our oppression were
still with us and kept us back. It was like we were
scared and resentful of each other getting stronger,
afraid that strength would be used against us as
power like men had done. And sometimes these
fears created power relationships. '

Some sisters who were more verbal and had
skills at getting things startedvisualizcdthings and

got projects started. Those sisters began to develop
an identity as leaders. Also in karate and auto
mechanics it seemed like a few sisters stoodout
from the others. This was really weird because

all sorts of trips came nut of it -- people setting up
pictures of ‘strong women’ and not being able to
support those women or understand them as
sisters. There were a whole bunch of personal
hostilities over it, hurt feelings, and people with-
drawing in bitterness. .
Some of this changed over time as we went through
more changes. Sisters discovered pride in a wider
range of abilities than those valued in a male-
oriented society. We worked on giving a dance

Lots of us have made important decisions

during this time-finding out who we are was more
important than keeping our job,,the security of
marriage, preserving our straight friends’ or male
friends’ or families’ images of us. Some of us
have quit work, (or been fired), left husbands,
moved from closet apartments into gaycollectives,
dissolved communes to search for a new basis

for coming together better than the last, formed
small groups to talk about our lavender visions
and play together.

‘Part of coming out and creating our community

is getting in touch with our anger-letting it out
instead of turning it in on ourselves with guilt and
fear. But it seems we always have to battle a
tendency to vent that anger on each other in
personal ways instead of letting it out in some
way that strikes at a whole fucked-up process that’s
going on.’ This might take a little more struggle,
but always trying to stay abov/-, a personally

"supporting"each‘oth'er to'live'up toideals. One‘-A-l
thing that made me feel lost was trying to

repress feelingsl ‘thought weren’t correct.....

so many of us have questions we aren’t talking
about. Things like: If I can’t always respond to
everything all the time does it mean I don’t care‘?

I know that all men are socialized to be oppressors
and that they can’t possibly overcome all that,

but there are three or four gay boys who I

really feel affectionate toward and who I think

are trying to do good things with their lives. If

I spend time with them does that mean I’m not
really gay? If I really want to relate intensely to
this woman does it mean I’rn monogamour (counter-

revolutionary? )? Am I making space for sister who are

trying to come out? In my fear and resentment at
being used/hurt by on .er_women have I gotten

too paranoid? Is it possible to work politically
with some straight women or women outside our
community and talk openly about where we’re
coming from? How can we keep our gay women’s
community a warm sisterly thing now that it’s so
big. Why are things so intense? I need to play! I
knowthat I’m integrating a lot more of what I do

vibes say, but-how much of an effect an I having
on that world out there- on the war, an all the
oppression of my’ sisters and brothers, over all
the institutions that affect my life?

I really feel strongly that we can’t let our vision
become a rigid code of behavior that puts us all
up against a wall and afraid to admit what we’re
feeling. Enough criticizing each other for not
being revolutionary enough, for not being truly
lesbian. The only way our lavender vision can
grow and become reality is to be honest with
ourselves and each other. I feel closer to it now.

After my depression and withdrawing a few
weeks ago I feel I’m getting more of a sinse

of who I am and like myself better. I’ve

broken through walls to closeness and honesty
with some women. Hopefully we can build on
these little beginnings--- one to one relationships,
a really terrific day spent with someone, a I
good talk-- to make space for each of us to

come out and go through these changes in

an organic way and create the joyful community
we have a vision of.

In the past year I have seen a lot of my sisters '
and myself get fucked over in relationships
with straight women and I realize that I

have had some pretty definite thoughts
about lesbians messing with straight women.

The way I feel now, I‘m pretty sure that I

will never have a sexual relationship with

a straight woman. Of course, the big question
is how do you define who is gay and who is
straight. I can’t pretend to have that answer
and ifprobably is a different answer for different
people, but I know that I can «often feel the
difference instinctively. It doesn’t just have

to do with whether you like female or male
genitals. It has to do with the way you live
your life and whom you identify with and
what you feel sexual and intense relationships
should be like. It also has to do with whether
or not you feel your relationships with women
are the primary ones in your life.

I know a woman who has been hanging out ‘I
at gay bars and sleeping with women for
years who considers sex with women
“practice for the real thing".The real thing

of course, is sex and marriage to a man. This
is as exploitative of lesbians as the treatment
we get from straight men.

I dont think that straightness is necessarily
a permanent condition for anyone and we must

vi

always leave space for people to change , but I know

that a fundamental rule of self-defense for
me and the only way for me to have equal ,
relations with a woman is when I’m involved
with someone who totally identifies as a
lesbian and who isn’t afraid of Ithat re31ity_

Sure, a lotof straight women who would get in-
volved in a sexual relationship with a lesbian are
women who want to come out. But some of
them are straight women who think in a straight
context and who are either.“experimenting”
(with our bodies, with our heads) or feel that
gayness is a matter of occasional incidence. Like
they love this one woman, but they aren’t really
gay. Bullshit.

I once fell in love with this straight woman from
the women’s liberation movement. She led me on
in a very fucked-up way. She was involved in this
very monogamous long—term relationship with a
boy, but she was very flirtatious and coy with
me. She sent messages to me THROUGH HIM
that if she ever slept with a woman it would be
me. She told me about erotic dreams she had a-
bout me. Basically she gave me every reason to
believe that she wanted to sleep with n2<';- and in-
tended to at some point. Months later. she told

I

  bv 

me that she never intended to steep with me.....
that the very thought of actually having sex with
a woman made her sick, repulsed her! I felt that
as a real attack. I felt that what was the basis of
so much of my emotional life was a game to her.
Since then I have seen a real pattern in her beha-
vior. She repeatedly_has encouraged women to
fall for her and as a result gains herself a very
dedicated friend (and sometimes servant) and it
makes her feel very flattered and attractive to
have this nice person have the hots for her. But
she is a straight. It‘s this ego trip.....similar to the
one that straight men are on. And it is totally op-
pressive to lesbians. »
4:. 14-94.:

It’s like how straight friends react when you tell
them Y0U.’_re gay. They immediately assume that
you’re real hot for them, that you can hardly con-
trol your lust when they walk into the room.
They assume that like straight men, we feel that
every woman is a target for our desires. For me,
that’s a load of shit. I got no desires for straight
women generally. It's too masochistic a trip for
me. But straight women who see themselves as
sex obiects find it hard to believe when lesbians
dont see them that way.

There's another trip that straight women want to
take us on that I‘m not having any part of. l have

Inevitably these relationships end up in broken
hearts for us lesbians. Either the straightwomen
decide this isn’t the thing for them, or they
return to the ‘‘real thing”: their men. We get left

Adelle Davis talks about this experiment she did in “Let’s

  

_ Eat Right to_ Keep Fit”. She fed people different breakfasts

and tested their blood sugar to deterrnine what gave you energy
the longest. The typical Amerikan breakfast was the worst-
coffee and donuts. The blood sugar rose for a short time and
then fell very low, producing fatigue. The same thing happened

a with oatmeal, and with dry cereals such as corn ﬂakes. Even

a healthly lunch and dinner didn’t help raise energv alot
after that. However, when people were fed a breakfast of

cottage cheese, lean ground beef, and skim milk and fruit.
their blood sugar rose to a very high level and stayed high

for 6 hours! What’s more, the breakfast set the tone
nutritionally for thelwhole day - it was easy to maintain the
energy level with a good lunch and dinner. Low blood
sugar produces irritability, fatigue, a craving for sweets,

depression, a loss of ability to think clearly.
There’s a vicious cycle that occurs when you don’t have

a goodibreakfast. First, you usually have a heavy dinner, and
maybe a midnight snack (my snacks are by that hour
gargantuan). Not only do you sleep on all that food, not
using it up so it is stored as fat - your blood sugar is so high
in the.mo'rning that you aren’t hungry for a good breakfast.
You have lots of will power because of the level of blood

‘ sugar. But as the day wears on, and blood sugar goes down,

so does will power, and you wind up “breaking” your diet -
responding to a starvation level of blood sugar.

What I really want to say is that most “diets” are geared
tokéep us unhealthy, just as many “exercises” get us slender
but not strong....and then we feel guilty about eating, when
in reality we are nutriti
in reality we"are nutritionally starved. It’s just another Catch 22.
We should be angry at the way we’re taught women should
eat, and for what reason we should eat that way (to fit an
image). I remember at college boys were allowed 2 servings
of meat and women were not, but they could have 2 servings
of potatoes! I

It’s also easier to build your body - push-ups, sit-ups, karate,
dance - when the nutritional requirements are filled. There
is a natural energy to do things, that justgimpels you.
Fatigue is emotional, and comes from doing shit work, bu;
also comes from malnutrition, and then we can use those 2 .
stimulants - coffee and cigarettes - to keep us going.

‘It makes one of the most liberating forces in the '

closets or we repress any strong feelings in order
to avoid getting hurt again. ’ I

A lot of strange shit like this_went on at the
liberated women’s center lastmonth. Since we

from gay women’s liberation were among the

most energetic, creative women, a lot of people
were attracted to us both as a group and as indi-
viduals. It became quite the fad to be having “gay
feelings” andlmore than one lesbian reported that
straight women were coming on to them in very
coy and seductive ways. The straight women who
were feeling like they wanted to come out
demanded that we spend lots of our energies and
time dealing with their feelings and helping them
‘with the changes they were going thru. They were
so ‘demanding in a lot of cases that it was impos-
sible for us lesbians to get together and talk
about ourselves and our own problems and
feelings. Some of our friends got sexually in-
volved with these womenand ended up feeling
hurt and miserable.

I don’t mean to discount the fact that a lot of
women really were impressed with how we
related to each other and really did start to feel
that they were gay. But no one left us space
together to talk about our lives as lesbians. For
us lesbianism isn’t a one _shot deal. A lot of us
have had a hard time dealing with the loss of our
jobs or being kicked out of our communes
because we are gay. A lot of us have had to deal
on a day to day level with our oppression as les-
bians. But most of the straight women only
wanted to talk about why they felt excluded by

 us or how they didn’t like how our organization

was set up and things like that. They were not at
all interested in the struggles we constantly have
to make. I ’ - '

Now a lot of these straight women are coming to
our bars. They take over the place like real im-
perialists. Instead of quietly trying to figure out
what the bars are‘ about and what our relation- " ,
ships are about, they criticize us for our “monog-
amies” and for our role-playing (they mean

butch/femme stuff). Never mind that thefre into 4

being Che Guevera or Rosa Luxumburg. They ‘_
don’t consider that role-playing. They just want
to “organi7.e” or “bring true radical consciousness

us how to be free. But meanwhile, they cringe *

For us the bars are the only place we have to go.
For some straight women it’s just a lark, a goof,
another groovy way to pass the evening. Every ’,
time in the last month that my lover and I have
gone to one of the bars, it seems like a whole I
hoard of these women follow us. They always
come by truckloads so that they can avoid any
contact with the ‘bar women,” as they call us.
They are extremely flirtatious and flamboyant,
acting with that conviction of rightness, of A
correctness, that straight women often radiate.

This is traditional territorial imperialism. They

take the last miserable little Mafia dives and make a»

them into the new hip joints defined by them.
Their circle dances are so ag-ressive that they
inherently contain criticisms of those of us who
dance “monogamously.” They also think they
are the only political freaks in the bar, ignoring
the incredibly political acts any lesbian (especi-
ally those who exist outside the relatively secure
context of a movement) has made all her life.

I’ll stick with my own people. And my people
are lesbians. Lesbians like me who really dig what

, we’re into. Who dig making love with women.
And with those women I’ll protect myself against -

anyone who tries to mess with our community,

V whether they’re pig men or fucked-up‘ straight-

women.

i am in Women’s Liberation here in Missoula
(a city which prides itself on an illusion of isolation
from the rest of the world - a very real illusion at
times - one that is gladly shattered through exchanges

such as this letter and LNS and other of the written

word). also, i am a lesbian, but in a rather abstract
sense, as i have spent much more of my time being
fucked over by men than loving other women. the
situation is that in Missoula as elsewhere in my
travels (limited) i have met few lesbians and be- .
friended many heterosexual women.
i read your article “Sensuous Woman’ in

the Jan. 16 issue of LNS. does it sound foolish to
say i really dig what (one of) you had to say? i
really do. for me - it has been the same old story
of thoughts and feelings Welling around inside me

with nowhere to take them. Gay People speak of

threatening them.
there has been much much on my mind these

’ last couple of months as i have been in the

frustrating process of coming out but not really
coming out. i have spoken to some of my
heterosexual friends. they are curious and some-
times helpful but more often i feel patronized. i

have even once made love with a friend of mine.

she is married and strongly attached. she thinks
to include me in their marriage. ’

exchange with me a few more and we will begin

WE ARE LESBIANS.
We are womenwho sleep with each other.

We are women who hav<eloved each other all our
lives and have been put in mental hospitals and jails
because of it. We are women who are just learning to
love each other. We are a community that creates our own
way of making love, our own way of fighting, our own way of
making a revolution that is not just on walls and in leaflets but in
our daily lives.

Some people say it doesn’t matter who you sleep with  IT DOES
MATTER! Who you go to bed with has everything to d o with who you are.

We are against sexism in all forms. Every day we face sexism when we walk

the streets hand in hand. We face it when we go to our bars which really
belong to the Mafia and are gawked at by men who come to let out all their
perverted fantasies about screwing us. Lesbianism brings out all of the perverted

hatred and anger that men have towards women. It is the biggest threat to masculine
domination there is.

Within the straight movement we don’t get a go at other issues because we constantly
have to Spend our time fighting sexism. This happens in the women’s movement too. We
refuse to constantly be put on the defensive about how political we are. We will not be

forced into being a single issue liberation movement. Our struggle against sexism includes
fighting all forms of domination because we believe sexism to be the first and most basic
fucked up power relationship.

Men are destroying the planet. We are struggling to prevent the death of Mother Earth.
We want to see the power of the U.S. government destroyed. We want to see the N.L.F.
win. We want to see spring come to Vietnam, and Laos, and Cambodia. We want to
see spring come to Palestine, and Mozambique. We want to see spring come to Uruguay,
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, and Puerto Rico.

And we want to see spring come to all the colonies within the United States -- we want
to see spring come to black and Third World America. We know that slogans like “Free
Bobby” “Free Erika” don’t go far enough ——don’t mean we have faced
up to our own racism and fully committed ourselves to destroying

racism. We are searching for ways to get rid of our racism that go
deeper than just rhetorical white “right-on” slogans. We see our struggle
against racism as a major part of our struggle as revolutionary gay women.

Being a lesbian and being open and blatant about it is beautiful. But it is
also historically dangerous. We have been called abnormal and insane for
centuries. We have been jailed, burned at the stake, and institutionalized.
Gay sisters know what it is to be underground.

In our struggle to come up and out we have found a new kind of
warm and loving community. But it ain’t just peaches and cream.
It’s not just am energy that makes our lives groovy. We need
a community to survive.

We demand the right to live.
An army of lovers cannot lose!

Psychiatry, the current state religion is a particularly
brutal tool for oppressing homosexuals. l’ve been
the victim of about ten shrinks over the past three
years. I went to them out of desperate loneliness
and confusion, duped into thinking that this last
resort might bring some relief. I played the game
well, and through the shrink’s subtle prompting l .
accepted my homosexual desires as a problem, as
part of the depression and self—hatred of which I
hoped to be cured.
(one exceptional moment was when one shrink
suggested that l visit some Lesbian bars. I was
terrified of trying to meet lesbians in a pick-up
situation, and since this was apparently the only
way I could meet them, my loneliness was rein-
forced.)
Two years ago l committed myself first to a city
hospital’s psychiatric ward (for two months), then
to a state mental hospital (for four months.) 'At
the time l believed that on some level I probably
was, through some individual quirk, ‘mentally ill’.
Now l see that my imprisonment was the direct
result of societal oppression.
Male Supremacist, mechanistic, capitalistic, nature-
raping, anti-homosexual Amerika had left no room
for me to exist. I would not fit in; I could not
suppress my gut desires to be free and loving,
which necessarily included being gay. Now I see
that my refusal to adjust to the prevailing death-
culture is my strength. My Lesbianism is my strength.
I feel nothing but a proud, life-inspired resentment
and anger towards shrinks who as ‘pimps of this
decadence’, helped me to almost deny my own
life .

Once upon a time there was a far-out dyke called

Little Purple Riding Hood. She was walking through
the dark concrete jungle (any Amerikan city) with her
basket of foodQ/alerie Solanas casserole) to bring to

the gay women’s communal dinner. She was strutting
along in her leather jacket and purple hooded sweatshirt
when all of a sudden out of a dark doorway jumps
(The Most Dispicable Character Imaginable) grungy,
seedy, horrible, grotesque----that penis-pig-----Big Bad
Prick (your basic straight man!) Out of the side of his
mouth comes a mixture of gutteral sounds and words
‘Hey chick, what ya doin‘ tonight?” In fine form Little
Purple yells ‘Off the prick!’ Big Bad Prick is shocked-

how cs: f she dare to criticize HIS most prized posession-.

his pa ’ Did she hear me correctly? he thought.
Stumi _ for words he resorts to his old standby---
‘You wanna fuck?’ and grabs for her arm. With this
Little iv”=.2rple,assumes her fighting stance position and
 a crippling side kick to his balls and prick
(Right on sister!)l' He falls, she spits on him and
walks away. Little Purple mutters to herself ‘Every
day and every way I’m getting stronger and stronger’,
but that’s another story. .4» ﬂy note '

there ’s this thing i tryirzg to figure out about

always searching for absolutes--the Super Groovy Rer-
olutionary, the Gay Woman, the Well Adjusted, Per-
fectly Sensitively Tactful Etc. Like when i ’m talking
with so-called “straight“ women--always being so care-
ful to say the right thing, and being so uptight as a
result. i want,-to be able to be unsure of myself, to
speak softly, to stutter, stumble, knock things over,
touch a woman clumsily. it's like we’re children
learning how to live all over again, but there aren’t
any patterns to learn (thank god! ), we have to kind
of awkwardly feel our way.

we have such a glossy world. all our sensitiveness

is stamped out so early-'-it’s so hard to. what is the
fake strength of never being able to let your psychic
hair down. what is getting close. letting another per-

strength——can weakness be positive)

performing. having total control over what’s hap-
pening. judging people, seeing them as static. con-
demning them for their defenses. .

i forget all the time about chauvinism--not the obvious
stuff like guys whistling, or even movenzent men using
political lines as sexual plays but more subtle things
that make me half a person-11 kind of self-sub-
jugation, shrinking from people. conciliatory, flirt-
atious, always smiling. it is the facelessness of the
woman--feeling i am nothing, even though i know
that isn’t true--feeling i do nothing, have no ego, no
pride. feeling unreal, out of touch with rn}’SC’lf-

like with women, iam still afraid, and with men

why can ’t there just be people.

WOMEN’S CENTER

It was a long march to our
building, made longer by our anticipation.
V Then - Our Building! 888 Memorial Drive!
An old knitting factory that Harvard
bought for student projects.
300 sisters wandering around -
Don’t touch the student’s projects! -
Painting ' Queer tootsies!
Revolution-it’s justa kiss
away!
Free Erika!
Sisterlove!
And sister love has seized a building
from Harvard!
1 saw a ripped sign on the wall, remnant
of the knitting factory, something about
the employment of women and children.
I did alot of security guard duty(at the
front door mostly). I guess I thought
that’s where the action was. But after
a few days I got upset that so much
energy was spent dealing with rumors of

a bust. The pigs were making us feel like
szhizophrenics - splitting our concentration
between a bust and building programs that
we needed.

It was cold 3 and although that would make
it seem like lesbianlove would flourish - that
was hard inside the Center. Lots of kissing,
hugging, and cuddling. And blankets.

By the end of the week, I was tired of
dealing with Cox and his statements, with
the rumors 3 times a day, and sick of
talking about “negotiations". But for

every rumor and for every prick that wanted
to come in or “talk” there were many sisters
-young and old- bringing food, blankets.
heaters, and clothes. many sisters who came
into the Center really excited about it!
There were 3 telegrams- “Hang on,Sisters!"

dear sister.

1 love you,

i realize what potential

i possess through you,

that had remained hidden

in deep recesses of my unawakened feelings.

dear sister,

1 love you too; ,
you give me faith in life and confidence,
i see myself in you at times

and love that too.

we are so different, but deeper inside,
where you let me reach,

we are so much alike.

do not be afraid,

only by having opened yourself to me
could i have ever felt this close to you-
how could 1 hurt you when you are me ~
in so many ways.

dear sister,

you too i love.

for accepting me,

making me feel wanted,

for showing me affection and, love
when i needed that the most,

you have helped me be honest with
myself and other women,

i hope i am honest with you too.

clear sister,

i love you in another different way,

a way that makes me feel comfortable

and open with you,

with a special trust of confidence.

we may not see each other for a long time,
but i know you are there always

when i need you,

to listen and understand.

 

One older lesbian named Barbara came to the
front door and wanted to talk to someone
from Gay Liberation. I came down and she
handed me a blanket and stated “This is for

3 gay woman.” I showed her at d

Iil<ed it. A definite up 0”" and She
Lots of women seemed to be coming out

It was exciting- but also tedious I Wanted

to talk to so many people - my sis.
ters in GWL, other gay women, and to
the women that wanted to talk about
gayness. Since there was guard duty to

do, rooms to fix up, and general anarchy (l)

I met alot of people, but I didn’t get to know
anyone better.In our next Women’s Center, I
want to get to know all those neat women I
met.

It was hard and cold - we didn’t have enough
gay meetings - it was fun - we danced, met
Pe0Pl€, started to build a women’s
Community, and embarrassed

Harvard a whole lot,

I feel like I lost a home. ]’mjust
crashing around,and although I

know I have a sister’s place to stay
every night, the Women’s Center was
really a place to go,

Now I’m glad we left‘ before the cops
came. We will see the succss or failure

of that decision when we get another
building and watch it grow and turn
more women on to meeting our needs
for ourselves.

dear sister.

my love for you is strong -and intense,
we know each other so well.

when i am with you i am so aware of
you and me.

we are so individual, so close in some ways,
so different in others.

i am overwhelmed

for the feelings

you have aroused

in me.

dear sisters.

i love all of you,
you may make it a little harder

because we know very little of each other-
but you have shown me vou care, I

you are honest with and about me,

and i love you for that

The romantic picture of the Vietnamese girl
revolutionary that is so common in the male-
dominated movement is only 'a small part of the
reality of Vietnamese women. While women in
the North are doing things they never dreamed
of doing before, they_ are viewed more as sup-
porters ant. entertainers of the men who are the
heroes. Women are in the militia and fire the
anti-aircraft guns, but they aren’t in the North
Vietnamese army---the front lines. Some North
Vietnamese films show women writing letters and
embroidering for their husbands at the front, gr
ﬁlling up the jobs the men left behind. Wo-
men do not hold major positions in government
nor do they speak publicly except on 5peCiﬁCa11y
women’s issues. The Communist Party of North
Vietnam has espoused the cause of women’s rights
since its inception, and women haven’t set up ,a
women’s liberation movement outside the party
framework.

In the South there _‘is less distinction between
the military front and the rear guard. Women
are more involved in guerilla warfare, and fre-
quently women have the responsibility of libera-
ting villages and setting up new governments in
border areas. Madame Dinh (who is Vice Com-
mander-in-Chief of the N.L.F.) personally led
uprisings in South Vietnam, especially the mi1i- 
tary part. And Madame Binh is head of the
PRC. delegation to the Paris peace talks, and
several of the people immediately under her are
women. Madame Dinh and Madame Binh repre-
sent a women’s power base---they are not simply
exceptional women. The women of the South
have developed through active struggle_a con-
ciousness of liberation as Vietnamese and as wo-
men. Many are conscious of women’s ﬁght af-
ter the war.

4 A quiet Buddhist nun in Vinh City told us that she had waited for
 years to meet women from the US, in order to tell us about her ex-
 periences during the war. She was sure that if women in the US un-
l‘ derstood what was happening in Vietnam, they would stop it; they
would find a way to stop the madness of their country throughout
§, the world. The women in Vietnam, North and South, believe that
women can change the world, that we in the US are part of that pro-
cess. DO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT? Can we begin to fulfill
that confidence in our own struggles which the women of Vietnam are

left Indochina (1954) separated Vietnam--
created two countries out of one people.
North Vietnam or Democratic Republic of “
Vietnam /D.R. V. / is ruled by a revolutionary
government. There is no civil war in the
North—-the people are working together to
build a socialist state. The capitol of North
Vietnam is Hanoi.
x The second Vietnam is South Vietnam and
there are two South Vietnamese governments.
 The US is supporting the Thieu—-K y regime
with its capitol in Saigon. This regime con-
trols only the cities and less than 20% of the
countryside. Over 80% of the countryside and
some sections of the cities is under the.Peoples’
Revolutionary Government (P.R.G.), Madame
Binh represents the P.R.G. at the Paris peace
talks. The National Liberation Front (N.L.F.) '
is the fighting force of the P.R.G.

K. ‘rs

The presence of troops has helped create some
400,000 prostitutes in South Vietnam---approxi-
mately one for every GI. In the cities it’s not
unuasual to see women on downtown streets
stripped and raped. In the villages and the pri-
sons women are maliciously brutalized in the
most blatant sexist and degrading displays. Sol-
diers are always free to rape captured women.
Girls of eleven, twelve, and thirteen are abused
just as are older women.

—--an 18 year old woman had her legs broken
by bullets , was raped to death by several sol-
diers and buried in a garbage dump.

---a young woman was blown up when three
GI’s rammed a live grenade into her vagina be-
cause she could not give them directions.
----women have been raped and left as landmarks
in the center of their villages with bamboo poles
from their vaginas through their mouths.

By these atrocities the US imperialists and the
Saigon regime expect to break morale, terrorize,
and induce moral decay throughout South Viet-
nam, and weaken the growing resistance there.
Women, however, are organizing, Committees to
Defend the Right to Live all over the South.
Women hold demostrations against the daily
rcpings and against the prostitution. Women’s
brigades come to the assistance of women on
streets and deal with rapists. Also the South
Vietnamese have developed a n anti-rape device
that is used like a diaphram but has crossed
razor blades---this device is fatal. The Commit-
tee to Defend the Right to Live is the major

I couldn ’t write this article without using
the titles that were set up for people there
like “ar'zti-imperilist”, etc.‘ Sony.

The weekend of_ April 10th. there was a

_ conference in Toronto for women in Canada
- and the U.S. to meet with sisters from Laos,
V‘ : South Vietnam, and North Vietnam.

'1 knew it would be hard but I also thought
that some of it would be a terrific up. I knew
that there would be straight women thatcalled

' V themselves “anti-imperilist” who wouldn’t say

lesbians were as “anti-imperilist”. I knew there

1 would be tensions between Third World women

and white women, between feminists and “anti-

. ' war”lwomen. But I hoped I could meet with
. SISTERS- black, gay straight, white, “anti-

imperilist”, feminist, and Indochinese and talk
about ourselves! Instead, what a trip! It was like
a pressure cooker!

The structure separated us: Third World vs.

_ Women’s Liberation; ‘lesbians vs. Women’s

‘Liberation vs. Third World women. Where do
Third World - lesbian-women’s l_i_berationists go?

/\/.\/\/VVVVV"\

I went whacko trying to understand why some
white ‘women felt black women were controlling
descions and why some black women felt white
women were. The racism was awful - as always -

. but this was worse than I ever felt it before. The

‘white liberal women (from Women’s Strike for

I Peace) who escorted the Indochinese around

used their knowledge of French to isolate the
Third World escort women from the Indochinese -
the Indochinese knew French, and so did the
liberals, the T hifd World escort‘ sisters didn’t,so....
And there was one woman who wasvery .c_lisrup- .
tive. Like she yelled things like ‘‘All Third World

by women are controlled by men.”

The structure prevented the Third World

I’ . “"'.(V)r1e.g1‘0_up at the conference,‘ - most everything '“ I

Was Separate -‘ 'and these kinds of actions and, '-
comments on the part of some of the women‘
made the walls higher.

It was like a maze.

Lesbians were getting so fucked over -

(no time for gay workshops, people saying that

we’re disruptive, not political, people putting each
other into categories.) We used our energy to combat’
the sexism against us - who else is gonna do it? But
we’re anti—imperi1ist, anti-racist, anti-war! We have I
to remind some straight women of that sometimes.

I didn’t agree with lots of the women’s politics
there..But the categories were set up when we got there
so I didn’t get to talk to very many. (I met some
out a site lesbians from different places). People
assumed others were in a category --

-A Third World straight woman is one who doesn’t
care about Women’s Liberation, who pushes you

up against the wall because you’re white.

-A white lesbian is one who wants to make you, who
doesn’t care about the war, and who pushes you up
against the wall because you’re‘straight.

-A Third World lesbian is both or either/or or what, who,
where, how, confusion.
(And all the other categories, but we are the ones
who got most fucked.) .
If you can imagine trying to talk to a sister, '
(any 01’ sister)with all this set in front of you,
then you can see what this conference was abhut.
A Happy Note- when we read “Will all gay sisters

please stand.” at the beginning of the statement
we read, 3/: of the audience stood up shouting “We
are all lesbiansl”. I was on the verge of tears most
of the time - this was a happy time. ,.  5

. I didn’t get a chance to talk to the Indochinese
sisters‘ except to say hello.(The liberals whisked
them past.) There were a few large workshops with
them, but I was so enraged at how we were being I
treated there I didn’t feel like I could talk to them
about anything other than that. Which would have
taken about 6 hours. And there were better things
I wanted to. say and know. But I couldn’t.

A sister told me later that she had talked to one
woman from Indochina. She asked if it was alright
to send women’s literature to Indochina. The sister
grabbed her hands, and said that she had thought
that this is why she had come - to talk about women.
She felt as if she had been lied to. -

There was so much bureaucracy and no one
seemed to know who decided what. Different
people have different theories as to who’s
responsible for setting this up in this. way and lying
to us all. (It’s a mystery I feel low on the list of
things to figure out about the anti-womaness that
came down at the conference.) But to who-ever the
fuck it was: .\

Keep out of our movement. We don ’t want your
