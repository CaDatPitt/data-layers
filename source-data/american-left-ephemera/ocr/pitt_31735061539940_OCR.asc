THE ANN ARBOR
STORY

Americans have ‘been told for
many years that they could find
success and happiness only through
the two party system. They've been
told they'd waste their vote by
casting it for a third party be-
cause third parties can't win.

A lot of people in Ann Arbor
have moved beyond the old myths.
They've formed an independent party
and they've won. They've raised the
issues that the Democratic and Re-
publican Parties never seem to get
around to and they've been able to
vote with a clear conscience on
election day. By electing two city
council members so far they've ac-
complished a great deal. Their
strength is growing because of theiﬁ
accomplishments and because people
have seen that honest, independent
parties can work.

The Human Rights Party is part of
a coalition of independent parties
known nationally as the People's
Party. The People's Party is trying
to repeat the Ann Arbor example
all over the country.

Human Rights Party Legislation F’assed::

»l. Amendments to the city human rights

ordinance which prohibit discrimination

in housing or employment against people

because of their sexual preference (het-

erosexual, homosexual, etc.), marital

cational association (student, non-stud-
ent, etc.). Even the smallest housing

units are covered, for both rent and pur-

chase.
2. A new anti—strikebreaker ordinance
prohibiting‘ employment agencies from

(helping to break strikes. Stronger sec-

tions in our proposal which would have

prevented employers from hiring scabs,

from outside the city and required cars

to stop before crossinga picket line were
voted down.

3. Anord_inance settinga $5 fine for use,
possession, and sale of marijuana. Since
its passage in May there has been only one
pot bust in the city.

4. A resolution reconstituting the city's _

ward boundary commission so as to pre-
vent the HRP from being gerrymandered
out of existence by the Democrats.

month parkingticket amnesty period dur-
ingwhich people could pay‘ their original
fines without the added penalties.

furnish in writing information about rent
and rentfreeze to tenants, and providing

civil and criminal remedies. Paragraphs‘

requiringthe information to be furnished
tothe City Assessor, for spot-check cal-
culation, and for a public file of infor-
mation, were voted down after a surprise
administration move claiming there was
"no money" to even allow landlords to
place information in the existing Asses-
sorls files.

LEGISLATION
DEFEATED:

HRP Leqislation which h_&Ls FAILED due
to Opposition from Democrats: ‘

1. A package of anti—war legislation ‘in-
cluding an ordinance which'would have
made war industries a public nuisance.
Not even Mayor Harris claimed that any
of this was illegal - the Democrats and
Republicans just voted them down one
after another. They even voted against
asimple resolution calling for immediate
withdrawal and condemning aggression!
2. A resolution calling for an investig-
ation of violations of the federal rent
freeze by landlords. The Democrats did
not want to offend their friends.

3. An ordinance to create a citizens bud-

-get commission which would prepare an

alternate budget to the one presented by
theCity Administrator so that the current
administrative monopoly over the budget
would be broken. The Mayor said the

group mightbe powerful, prestigious and
" accountable to no one, like the planning

commission, and voted against it. - What
he meant was that it threatened to upset

the City Hall applecart.

The People's party believes that we
Americans ought to get our country
back — or take it back if we have to.
Its called the People's party because
we believe that people — where°we
live, where we work, where we study,
are the real meaning of politics. Ours
is a party that will never be run from
the top down, a party that exists as an
expression of our membership, never
as an owner of that membership. We
stand for radical social, economic and
political change in our country. Ours
is a party which will undertake pro-
jects in our communities to implement
our platform as well as organize for
the long range goal of electing local,
state and national candidates. We are
working for jobs, justice, peace and
the liberation of all people.
