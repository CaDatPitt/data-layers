A CRITIQUE OF ZIONIST HISTORY AND POLICY
by The Israeli Socialist Organization(MATZPEN)

_Interpretations of the Israeli-Arab conflict by Israelis can

be divided into two categories:

I. The offical version'(i.e. _the Zionist one), accepted by
the maiority of the population, politicians, educators,
intellectuals, writers, iournalists. This version interprets
Israeli history, like Jewi-sh history,in terms of “struggle
for (Jewish) survival. " ' .

2. The version appearing in the following articles, accepted
by a minority of Israelis. It interprets Israeli history, as
well as Jewish history, in terms of political, economic,
social and ideological factors.

The first version, based on the assumption that minority

persecution is inherent in "Human Nature," accepts anti-

Semitism as_ a permanent Fact of life. Insists on preserving

"Jewishness". It is nationalist.

The Second version is based on the assumption that man

makes his own history, including his interpretations of it,
‘as well as his "----ishness". It considers-Zionism and "Jew-
, ishness" as alienations. It is internationalist.

This publication aims to.unt_ie the emotional knot which
has been tied" into a political conflict, by providing a critical
analysis of - its history.

The Israeli Socialist ‘Organization was formed in Israel in
I962. The membership consists of Jews and Arabs. It pub-
lishes a monthly (MATZ PEN-.-compass) in Hebrew ,and
occasional publications in A_rabic. It aims at so’ci’ali'st _
revolution in Palestine and throughout the Middle-East, and
is openly anti-Zionist.

This article was published originally by the Israeli Socialist Organization in
July I968. This re—,publication is by the Radical Education Project, Box 56Il-A,
Detroit, Michigan,48232, which publishes a variety of articles dealing with
imperialism, women's liberation, and the university. Write for our listing.

 

  

 

the minority according to its whims. Occasional waves of
liberalism have only a temporary character. . . . No educa-
lion, progress, liberalism, Humanism, can save the minority
when the terrible hour comes.” (Jushua Bar-Yossef in
“Yediot Aharonot” 12/1/68.) ,

Apart from the understandable tendency of a persecuted
minority to generalize persecution and elevate it to the
rank of a “law of nature,” there is another trend in Zion-
ism which considers even successful integration and assimi-
lation as a catastrophy. Often the two elements become

‘intertwined, but occasionally the latter scorns the former

for inventing Zionism as a response to pressuresfrom
outside rather than a self-sufﬁcient perpetuation of Jewish
nationalism. This view is expressed in the following:

“The root of all trouble in (Jewish) -history stems from
the French revolution and damned emancipation. Zionism
was forced upon us. Most of the people who are now here
(in Israel) are here because they could not live elsewhere,
could not assimilate. Why is there no mass immigration of
many thousands of Jews to Palestine now that we redeemed
it? Don’t tell me it is the fault of the “Jewish agency.” or
that there are no economic means. The diaspora is deep
within us and religious Jewry did not pioneer the resurrec-
tion in Palestine. This was handed to Herzl, Jabdtinsky,
Ben-Gurion,'and they were products of an emancipation
that went bankrupt; Hence too all our other complexes
such as “ we came here.” “we are progressive,” “we are
humanitarian,” etc. etc. all this is so because the two great
revolutions, the French and the Russian carried the banner
of integration, assimilation, eosmopolitanism, ideas which
we were among the ﬁrst to accept, and when we came here
we feel uncomfortable. Since we failed over there, and
came here we feel uncomfortable with regards to the
Arabs, militarism, war; This discomfort is the spiritual
crisis. Even religious Jewry today believes that the Messiah
will come of his own, that .it need do nothing, that there
is a state, a Zionist organization, a ruling party, that they
will deal with practical politics. But we are dealing with
matters of eternity, not of politics. Hence the trail_ing of all
parties behind the historical events instead of blazing their
way.” (Dr. Israel Sheib (“Eldad ”), “ Views," Quarterly of
religious academics.He'brew, winter '68, p. 296.)

To the generalization of- minority persecution, above, is
added the will to perpetuate Jewish nationalism and save it
from being integrated, assimilated. The ﬁrst approach con-
siders anti_-Semitism as evil and integration as an inevitable
failure, the second considers anti-Semitism as a blessing,
and integration as an unnecessary_ evil. A hazy combination
of both approaches motivates most thinking Zionists, and
though many readily -denounce Bar-Yossef and Sheib as
“extremists “fanatics”, etc., none will challenge. the
principles. Any Zionist critique of these views is based on
tactical considerations only, rejecting their principles is
tantamount to undermining the whole ideological ration-
alization of Zionism.

Having postulated minority-persecution as inherent- in
unalterable “Human nature”, the rest of the Zionist as-
sumptions follow easily. If the hostile majority cannot be
expected to overcome its inherent evil how can one expect
it to help the minority escape from the consequences?
Hence the only possibility left for the minority is that of
self-liberation. This idea was promulgated and propagated
by P’insker’s booklet Autocniancizsation (1892). The last
step follows from the previous two; it proposes the estab-
lishing of a nation-state within which the persecuted group
wields majority and state-power as the only valid realiza-
tion of self-liberation, as the only way in which a persecuted
group can gain control over itself and become a master of
its own fate.

In its social origins, emotional motivations, and ideo-
logical rationalizations, the similarity between Zionism
and “Black Power” is striking. The nearest thing to Zion-

 

   

ism was, probably, the “ Back to Africa ” movement formed
in the early 1920's in the U.S.A. by the Jamaican printer,
Marcus Garvey, forerunner of “ Black Power" and main
«.-liallenge to Du-Bots’ “National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Coloured People ”. Indeed, there is no reason
why Zionism should not be recognized for what it actually
is, namely—-the Jewish version of “Black Power” or,
simply, the movement of “Jewish Power”. The similarity
has to be oualified as applying‘ to social origins, emotional
motivations, ideological rationalizations, but not to political
implications. In its pursuit of "colonizing Palestine, becom-
ing a majority there, achieving and maintaining political
power, Zionism became an integral part of the Imperialist
system, whereas “Black Power ” — unable to pursue state-
hood"——ls diametrically opposed to Imperialism. Zionism
succeeded in creating its own version of the world from
which the Jews were rejected. It did not abolish minority
persecution in Israel, nor can it. It transformed Jews from
a persecuted minority into a discriminating, nationalistic,
majority. “Black Power”, unable to bring about a realiza-
tion of a similar aim, is forced to reject Western society
in its entirety and denounce it as repulsive; Herzl devoted
many pages of his diaries to describe the Jewish state, as
a pathetic replica, a liberalized version, of the Habsburg
empire, of Vienese society in the late 1890’s. “Black
Power” protagonists are unable to follow this trail, they
are forced to reject American society in toto; they denounce
those who wish to recreate a Negro version of it.

The Zionist postulates prescribed a definite attitude to-
wards anti-semitism, Jews who fought it, as well as those
who assimilated. It prescribed immigration to Palestine as
the only‘ answer to anti-Semitism, it criticized, and rejected
any struggle for emancipation. civil rights legislation, etc.
It’ found itself in_one camp with those anti-Semites who
said to the local ‘Jewish communities “ Go to Palestine”.
Typically, the initiative in the Jewish struggle against
Nazisni during the 19308 never came from the Zionist

organization. It was the non-Zionist Jewish ‘individuals and
organizations who took the initiative and burden of that
struggle on themselves. The fiercer that struggle became,
the further apart did the Zionist organization stand from
the rest of Jewry. The underlying considerations are
spelled out in a letter writtenoy Ben-Gurion to the Zionist
executive on December 17th, 1939'

“The Jewish problem now is not what it used to be. The
fate of Jews in Germany is not an end, but a beginning.
Other anti-Semitic states will learn from Hitler. Millions
of Jews face annihilation, the refugee problem has assumed
world-wide proportions, and urgency. Britain is trying to
separate the issue of the refugees from that of Palestine.
It is assisted by-anti-Zionist Jews. The‘ dimensions of the
refugee problem demand an immediate, territorial. solution;
if Palestine will not absorb them another territory will.
Zionism is endangered. All other territorial solutions, certain
to fail, will demand enormous sums of money. If Jews
will have to choose between the refugees, saving Jews from
concentration camps, and assiting a national museum in
Palestine, mercy will have the upper hand and the whole
energy of the people will be channelled into saving Jews
from various countries. Zionism will be struck off the
agenda not only in world public opinion, in Britain and
U.S.A., but elsewhere in Jewish public opinion. If we allow
a separation between the refugee problem and the Pales-
tine problem, we are risking the existence of Zionism.

The saving of Jewish lives from Hitler is considered
here as a potential threat to Zionism, unless they are
brought to Paletine. When Zionism had to choose between
the Jewish people and the Jewish state it unhesitatingly
preferred the latter. .

It is often argued by advocates of Zionism that had a
Jewish state existed in Palestine before the second World
War it would have saved most of Europe's Jews. The fact

9

lb

 

 
 

that the Jews in Palestine escaped extermination is used to pro-
vide the factual support to the argument.

The truth is that the Jews in Palestine were saved simply
because the Nazis did not conquer the Middle-East. There is
no reason to believe that they would have treated a Jewish
community, or state, differently from the way they treated all
other Jewish communities. As for the belief that the Jews
in Palestine would have behaved differently from the European
communities under Nazi occupation, the evidence is hardly
decisive. It is known that on the eve of the battle in El-Allmein
the issue was debated in the Zionist, and other, executive com-
mittees. While one group advocated concentrating all Palestinian
Jews on Mount Carmel and a final, Massada-like, battle against
Nazism, another sought some modus-vzvendz with the Nazis.
It was even argued that the industrial potential of the Jewish
community in Palestine be used as a bargaining card in nego-
tiations with the Nazis. . '

To sum up: Zionism accepts anti-Semitism as the natural
normal attitude of the non-Jewish world towards the Jews.
it does not consider it as a distorted, preverted phenomenon,
it is a response to anti-Semitism but not a confrontation, de-
nounciation, or fight, against it. In Palestine it recreated a
nationalist society wherein the Jews were made a majority
so as to exercise extra political rights, whereas the minorities
(especially the former Palestinian majority) suffer political,
legal, social, economic, discrimination. The basic assumption
that minority persecution is an integral, negative element of
human behavior and no education, improvement of socio-
economic conditions, liberalization will ever overcome‘ it is
accepted by Zionism. As a consequence, anti-Semitism is
considered as a problem confronting Jewry, not Humanity.
In other words, Zionism is morally, psychologically and socially
an alienation of a persecuted minority.

The Zionist assumptions created a political "matter of
fact” approach of Zionism to anti-Semitism. Thus I-Ierzl
negotiated with Plehve, the notorious anti-Semitic Tsarist
minister of the interior, who, in 1903, granted him a letter
stating that the Zionist movement could count on the
Tsarist government “moral and material assistance with
respect ot the measures taken by the Zionist movement
which would lead to the diminution of the Jewish popula-
tion in Russia.” (Herzl’s diaries, Gollancz, p. 398). A similar
arrangement was negotiated between Arlossorof, secretary
of the Histadruth (Zionist Trade Union), and the Nazis in
1934. Most infamous of all such negotiations were, prob-
ably, those carried out between R. Kastner, secretary of
the Zionist committee in Budapest, and Adolf Eichman
(the “transportation of Jews" man of the S.S.), in Buda-
pest in 1944. Having won Kastner’s cooperation by allow-
ing a thousand of the wealthiest Jews to escape to Switzer-
land, Eichman usedhim to coax 800,000 reluctant Hun-
garian Jews to board the trains to the “labour camps ” of
Auschwitz. , _

The mutual understanding existing between Zionism and

"anti-Semitism is shared by both sides on the political,’ as

well as the personal, level. A typical example‘is the follow-
ing excerpt from the diaries of R. Meinertzhagen, Al1enby’s
Political Oﬁicer 1919/21: “My inclination towards Jews in
general is governed by an anti-Semitic instinct which is

invariably modiﬁed by personal contact. My views on Zion- _

ism are those of. an ardent Zionist."
(“ Middle'East diary ”, R. Meinertzhagen, London ’59,
Crescent Press, p. 49)

The massacre of the Jews during the second World War
completely transformed the image of the leadership of th_e
Jewish community in Palestine. Whereas up to the war this
leadership was accepted as the representative of a small,
though un.ique, Jewish community, it established after ’45,
especially after achieving independence in '48, its image

10

as the only representative of world Jewry. It overshadowed
completely all other Jewish representative bodies, including
the Zionist movement itself. Once the image ..was estab-
lished that leadership started to wield enormous moral
gleight throughout the West. A few examples will illustrate
is.

When Washington decided to reintegrate Adenauer’s
Germany into the Western alliance, rebuild the “wehr-
macht” and integrate it in_to.NATO, it had to “rehabili-
tate” the Adenauer regime, and make it “respectable”
The task naturally fell on Ben-Gurion. He duly signed the
“reparations” agreement with Adenauer, publicly declar-
ing: “Germany of today is not the one of yesterday”
ignoring violent protest inside Israel itself. Adenauer duly
named the agreement “ wiedergutmachung”, as if Geno-
cide can be atoned for by monetary payments. Later, when
Adenauer was invited for the first time to the U.S.A. and
feared Jewish demonstrations, Ben-Gurion ﬂew over from
Israel, and accidentally met Adenauer in the Waldorf-
Astoria, where a photographer, accidentally, snapped them
both, holding each other’s hands. When the picture ap-
peared on the front pages of the -Press, Adenauer was
“ kosherized”. During that meeting Adenauer, naturally,
promised an enormous new loan to Israel. When Eichman
was tried in Jerusalem, the prosecution was careful to
avoid any mentioning of the name of Globke, the promul-
gator of the Nuremberg racial laws, which laid the legal
foundation for racial discrimination in Nazi Germany. The
fact that Globke was Adenauer’s close aide, and the
frantic negotiations that went on behind the scenes about

this point are little known in the West. Gradually the
practice became established for any “respectable” poli-
tician, accused of racialism in. his own country, to arrange
an official. visit to Israel to improve his image.

This applies to Jacques Soustelle, the French extremist
nationalist; to Franz-Joseph Strauss, the German extremist
nationalist, as well as to Enoch Powell, the British Con-
servative extremist. Mr. Powell created a scandal in Britain
when he made a racialist speech in Wolverhampton in
April ’68. Six weeks later he decided to accept a standing
Israeli invitation and visited Israel in official capacity.

The Public Relations mechanism of these visits is based
on the fact that Western public opinion has been condi-
tioned to accept the Israeli government as “the spokes-
man of Jewish conscience”, “the voice of the six million
Jews massacred by the Nazis”. Therefore it expects the
Israeli government to expose, and denounce, any racialist.
If Soustelle, Strauss, Powell and their like are otﬁcially
invited to Israel and meet no hostile demonstrations there,
how could they possibly be racialists?

The latter gentlemen accept, tacitly, that in return.for
the image varnishing granted by Israel they will recipro-
cate by direct, and indirect, support. It is not so much of
a collusion, it is rather the old, mutual, understanding,
between Zionism and anti-Semitism in a new, official, garb.

It at: It:

Western civilization produced anti-Semitism as its legiti-
mate offspring, Nazism as its illegitimate one. European
Jewry, unable to recognize anti-Semitism as a product of a
civilization of which it was part, elevated it to the rank
of “a law of Human nature” and produced Zionism to
cope with that alienation. With both ideological alienations
taking hold of Human minds Genocide of the Jews and
State of the Jews became realities. Finally, the pyramid of
alienations was capped by Western civilization accepting
the Zionist state as “conscience of the West”. Under
these circumstances the reluctance of public opinion in the
West to criticize, expose, denounce, Zio"ism is understand-
able, but those who put up with this state of affairs ought
at least to "be aware that they accept, tacitly, the basic
assumptions of racism.

THE PALESTINE PROBLEM

Of all the problems bequeathed to the world by European
imperialism, Palestine is among the most intractable.

It is a peculiarly emotional issue, not only for those
immediately involved. In the West the burden of guilt left
by Hitler’s crimes against the Jews has created a barrier
which the injustices suffered by the Palestinian Arabs can-
not penetrate. In many Arab countries hatred of the Jews
is whipped up to divert the internal struggle against re-
actionary regimes into external channels. Western economic
interests in the area, and the tendency of both East and
West to exploit the situation for ideological or strategic
advantage, further complicate the problem. To make
matters worse, in both Israel and‘ the Arab‘ countries there
is almost total ignorance of the other’s history, people and
aspirations.

Emotions, however, whether rightly or wrongly based,
cannot solve complex political problems. They are much
more likely to lead to disaster. At the centre of the emo-
tional miasma surrounding Palestine lie two hard facts-
the displaced Arab population who still live in refugee
camps round Israel's borders; and a new nation of Israel,
with a complete class structure of its own, who by incessant
propaganda and, to a certain extent, real achievement, are
beginning to carve a place in the world. Neither can be
forgotten, ignored, or annihilated. A political solution must
sooner or later be found, that is both realistic and just.
The alternative is—-eventually——war, which will at best
only defer, not solve, the political problems.

A realistic solution can only be based on a thorough
historical, economic, political and social analysis of the
problem. This has, however, yet to be made.- In the follow-
ing series of articles a brief sketch of such an analysis
will be drawn. Because of space limitations it will neces-
sarily be schematic and consist mainly of theses, rather
than detailed argumentation and factual evidence. (The
substantiating evidence could easily ﬁll several volumes.)
If—as we hope—the present series of articles give rise
to a serious, unemotional discussion, we shall be able to
provide factual material wherever necessary.

The ﬁrst part of -this article sketches the history of the
Zionist colonisation of Palestine up to World War II.

The second part covers the period from World War II to
the present day.

The third analyses the present situation, and discuss
possible solutions of the problem,,and outline our eight-
point programme for a solution as a basis for discussion.

FROM 1870 T0 WORLD WAR II
The original sources which gave rise to Zionism are
threefold.

1. Economical: The rapid development of capitalism in
Europe ‘during the 19th Century and the decay of the
Austrian and Russian Empires. In the less in=dustria=l'ised
countries, like Poland and Russia, the new social ‘stresses
resulted’ in uprooting the Jews from their traditional
occupations. Declining feudalism used the Jews as a
scapegoat to divert the struggle of the peasants‘ into
the channels of racial persecution. These processes
created a huge wave of Jewish emigration from eastern
and central Europe. Some 5,000,000 emigrated to Amer-
ica and other “new countries”. A few thousand went
to Palestine

‘i‘HE PAI..ES'"I'iNE PROBLEM

Theses submitted for discussion to the Israeli
Socialist Organisation

In western Europe, where the Jews were mostly
merchants and middle class, the pressures of economic
competition made it increasingly difficult for them to
integrate into local bourgeois society, and forced them
to create their own social institutions.

2. "Political. The capitalist development of 19th Century
Europe brought to the fore two political phenomenae.
nationalism and colonization of the under-developed
continents. Zionism arose and took shape under the
inﬂuence of these two. It was the nationalist response
to the problem created by persecution of the Jews. It
proposed to create a national Jewish state, by colonizing
an under-developed territory. In both. these ways it was
a charitable product of its time.

3. Ideological: The two objective trends mentioned in (1)
and (2) found a favourable ideological soil in the Jewish
religion. Unlike Christianity and Islam, which are uni-
versal cosmopolitan faiths, Judaism (being much more
ancient) is a tribal religion. It'is inherently nationalistic
in character. It considers Palestine as “The Promised
Land ”——promised by God to “The Chosen People”,
namely the Jews. According to Judaism, the troubles
of the Jews -would end once they returned to the Holy
Land. But whereas religious Jews expected God to per-
form this act of redemption, the Zionists gave the
ancient -traditional themes a secular, political, form. .

In the ﬁrst half of the 20th Century the population of
Palestine was about 700,000, the overwhelming majority
being Arabs. There were various minority communiti._es,
including some 70,000 Jews. Economically and politically
these Jews were an integral part of the indigenous
population. differing only in religion. They had nothing
to do with colonization or Zionism.

The _ﬁrst step in the modern Jewish colonization of Pales-
tine was taken in 1870 when Baron Edmund de Rothschild
of France acquired some land near Jaffa. and established an
agricultural school (Mikveh Israel — “ Gatherer of Israel ”).
This was followed by -the building of some twenty villages,
inhabited by some 5,000 Jews, mostly from Russia. Up to
1900 the Baron invested about £2m. in Palestine. The
Rothschilds were (and still are) among the world’s leading
ﬁnanciers, with the French and British branches of the
family holding inﬂuential positions in the economy of these
two countries. Baron Edmund combined his Jewish senti-
ments with his support for French interests in colonizing
Palestine following the Algerian model. He wished to
amalgamate the emigration of east European Jews with
the colonial interests of French imperialism. He did not
entertain the idea of an independent Jewish state in
Palestine (he was no Zionist) but used his ﬁnancial power
in the Ottoman treasury in order to prepare a new sphere
of inﬂuence for Fren-ch interests, employing Jewish immi-
grants as settlers. His Palestine activities were thirty years
old when Zionism was born.

Political Zionism was founded in 1897 at a congress held
in Basie, Switzerland. If differed signiﬁcantly from the
Rothschild colonization in that it declared its intention of
solving the Jewish problem by creating a national Jewish
state. However, the Viennese journalist T. Herzl. the
founder and first leader of the Zionist movement, did
not consider Palestine as the indispensable location for
such a state. On the contrary, he advocated Uganda as the
most suitable place for Jewish colonization. But the majority
of -the Zionists rejected the Uganda scheme and insisted on
fulfilling the Jewish religious sentiment towards Palestine.

From the very beginning, Zionism sought to achieve its
aim by means of a deal with one imperialist power or
another. The guiding principle of Zionist diplomacy was
always to affiliate itself with that world power within whose
sphere of inﬂuence Palestine happened to be. Herzl courted
mainly the Turkish Sultan and the German Kaiser. After

I

 

  

 

 

World War I Zionism was orientated towards British
imperialism. Again after World War II Zionism switched
its orientation to the U.S. and occasionally ﬂirted with
France.

The fact that Palestine was already populated by Arabs
hardly ﬁgured in the early discussions of political Zionism.
The philosopher M. Buber relates: “When ‘Max Nordau,
Herzl’s second in command, ﬁrst received details on the
existence of an Arab population in Palestine, he came
shocked to Herzl, exclaiming: “I never realised this— we
are commiting an injustice”. These moral shocks (which
continuously troubled the Humanistic elements in the
Zionist camp) proved to be a very weak barrier against
Nationalism.

-When at the beginning of this century organised Zionist
immigration started to pour into Palestine, the surprising
fact that the country was already populated could no
longer be ignored. Like every colonizing society, the Zionist
settlers had to shape a deﬁnite policy towards the indigen-
ous population. Here we come to the speciﬁc feature of
Zionism which distinguishes it from all other colonizations
of modern times. The European settlers in other colonies

sought to exploit the riches of the country (including the

labour potential of the “ natives ”) and invariably turned
the former population into a proletarian class in a new
capitalist society. But Zionism wanted not simply the
resources of Palestine (which were not very great in any
case) but the country itself to serve for the creation of a
new national state. The new nation was to-have its own
classes, including a working class. The Arabs were, there-
fore, not to be exploited, but totally replaced.

The Rothschild colonization clashed with the Palestine
Arabs only over one issue --«land ownership. The Baron
bought land from the feudal Eifendis, sometimes by bribing
the Ottoman administration, and drove the fellahin off the
land. The expropriated fellahin were then employed as

' labourers in the Baron's settlements, following the usual

colonial pattern. The Zionist colonization, however, raised
the slogan “ Jewish Labour”. Aspiring to create a Jewish
working class as part of a new nation, it advocated a tran-
sition of people from middle class occupations to manual
labour, and it insisted that Jewish employers use Jewish
labour only. The Zionists, therefore, clashed not only with
the expropriiated Arab peasants but also with the interests
of the Baron's settlers who preferred to use the cheaper
Arab labour. This issue was the main conﬂict within the
settlers’ community during the ﬁrst three decades of the
century. The main protagonists of the “Jewish labour”
policy were the left-wing elements within Zionism. The
bourgeois elements were always tempted to employ the
cheaper Arab labour. Had the bourgeois attitude pre-
vailed, Palestine might have developed along much the
same lines as Algeria, South Africa or Rhodesia. It was,
however, the left~wing of Zionism which prevailed. The
funds of the Zionist movement were often used to cover
the difference between the cost of Arab labour and the
more expensive Jewish labour.

The nascent Zionist society clashed with all the various
classes of Palestine Arab society. It brought from Europe
capital, modern technological know-how and skills. Jewish
capital (often backed by Zionist funds), gradually displaced
the feudal elements simply by buying up their lands, and
Zionist regulations forbade re-sale of land to Arabs. Possess-
ing technological and ﬁnancial advantages, the Zionist
capitalist economy blocked the emergence of an Arab
capitalist class. Having clashed with the Arab peasants by
driving them off their land, Zionism also prevented them
from becoming a proletriat in the Jewish sector of the
economy. Since the Arab sector’s capitalist development
was retarded and hindered, the peasants (as well as the

2

 

     

Arab intelligentsia) found it hard to get any employment
at all——except in the British Mandate administration and
public services.

The entire economic and social structure of Arab Pales-
tine (which had started off from conditions roughly similar
to those in Syria) became totally deformed by Zionist
colonization. This deformation persists even today.

This socio-economic deformation was reflected in the
political sphere. Since the bourgeoisie, the proletariat and
the peasantry were denied a normal path of development,
they did not produce political parties and leaders of suffi-
cient calibre. Political leadership of the Palestine Arabs
inevitably remained in the hands of the landowning class,
who, although they liquidated themselves as a class by
selling their land to the Zionists, made enormous ﬁnancial
gains by these transactions. They retained the political
leadership of the Arabs by covert co-operation with the
Zionists and the British. In order not to be branded as
traitors they assumed in public the most extreme anti-
Zionist stands, even declaring the sale of land to the Zion-
ists to be treason.

Typical were the El-Husseinis, one of the richest land-
owning families. Secretly, they sold land to the Zionists.
Oﬂicially, Amin el-Husseini was the religious leader of the
Palestine Muslims and chairman of the Arab Higher Com-
mittee (the official political representatives of the Arabs in
Palestine). His cousin, J asmal el-Husseini was deputy chair-
man of that committee and leader of one of the main Arab
political parties. Similarly, the leader of another party (“ Al
Istiklal ”) was Auni Abdul Hadi. The Abdul Hadis were the
biggest landowners in Palestine. In 1928 A. Abdul Hadi
made a secret agreementwith the Zionists and saw to it
that the customary denunciation of the Balfour Declara-
tion would not -be raised in the seventh Arab conference.

Similarly, and more far reaching, understanding existed
between the Zionists and the Hashemite kings, who were
the main ally of British imperialism in the Middle East. In
1922 in London King Faisal (the son of Sherif Hussein of
Mecca) signed a joint political agreement with Weizmann,
Chairman of the Zionist movement. Article 3 of this Agree-
ment endorsed the Balfour Declaration. Article 4 states:
“ All necessary measures shall be taken to encourage and
stimulate immigration into Palestine on a large scale”.
This agreement was the ancestor of the secret agreement
between Ben Gurion and Abdallah in 1948, when they
divided Palestine between them and virtually arranged
the result of the war.

Typical to the British Foreign Oﬁice attitude was the
nomination of Amin el Husseini as Mufti of Jerusalem
(April, 1921), and later as President of the Supreme Muslim
Council (1922), by Sir Herbert Samuel, the ﬁrst British
High Commissioner in Palesine, a pro-Zionist Jew. The
Mufti was to be elected by a small number of electors who
were, themselves, elected by the small minority of people
who had had the right to vote for the Ottoman Parliament.
Three other candidates got eighteen, seventeen, and twelve
votes. Haj Amin received nine votes only. The High Com-
missioner had the “right” to nominate one of the ﬁrst
three. One of these three candidates was made to resign,
putting Haj Amin in third place. He was then nominated
the new Mufti. The new Mufti combined extremely reac-
tionary politics with religious fanaticism and right-wing
nationalism. During World War II he went to Berlin and
found in the Nazis close and natural allies. He had never
graduated, from El Azhar or any other similar institute,
and lacked religious qualiﬁcations for his post. The majority
of Palestine Arabs never took part in these or any other
elections and never exercised any democratic rights.

The decisive period in the development of the Palestine
problem started with the rise of fascism in Europe. This
brought to play three signiﬁcant factors:

 

  

1. Jewish immigration from Europe rose sharply, as can
be seen from the following -table of Jewish population
in Palestine. ' ’ " “  A '

Year No. of Jews in Palestine
1922    = 83,790
1931    174,606
1944    553,600
1945  ...  579,227
1946'  608.225.

The jump between 1952 - 1951‘ followed the ‘rise of
fascism in Poland. The still more signiﬁcant Jump of
1931 -1944 followed the riseof ‘Hitler. -The -- rise of
European fascism was a most potent, perhaps decisive,
factor in the subsequent history of _Palestine. _

2. This new wave of Jewish immigration differed qualita-
tively from previous and subsequent waves in its class
structure. Whereas other waves consisted mainly of
petit bourgeois elements without much capital, this
particular wave brought many middle-class capitalist
elements. The following table gives the numbers _of
Jewish immigrants officially described as capitalists (i.e.
those who proved to possess £1,000 or more, in current
values):

No_ of No. of
Capitalist ~ Capitalist
Jewish Jewish
Year Immigrants Year Immigrants
1932 ... 727 1937 ... 1,275
1933 . .. 3,250 1938 . .. 1,753

1936 . . . 2_.970 1941 . . . 314
1934 . . . 5,124 1939 .. . 2,606

The peak of capitalist immigration occurred in 1934
1935 (after Hitler rose to power) just before the great
Arab general strike in Palestine. This turned out to be
an important coincidence.

3. The religious and nationalist leaders of the Palestine
Arabs saw in fascism a natural ally against British
imperialism. They followed the maxim “my enemy's
enemies are my allies”. This choice later proved to be
wrong, in principle, as well as in practice.

Meanwhile, the anti-imperialist struggle throughout the

Arab countries reached unprecedented scale. In Syria, a

general strike was declared in 1936 against French imperi-

alism. This strike proved to be effective and on the whole
successful. It brought Syria substantially nearer political

independence. .

This made a great impression in Palestine, and there, too,
a long general strike was declared. Conditions in Palestine
were, however, very different because of the presence of
Zionist economical infrastructure, which did not, of course,
take part in the strike. Moreover, the Zionists exploited
the fact that Arab workers in Government administration
anl services (e.g. railroads, ports, etc.) were on strike, and
that Arab commerce was paralysed, to secure a grip of
these large and important sectors. of the economy. As
mentioned above, the strike coincided with a greatinﬂux
of Jewish capital from Europe. Thus, while the Arab sector
of the economy suffered a blow from which it never re-
covered, the Zionists secured a new and decisive hold on
the whole economy.

British imperialism, which ruled Palestine from 1918 to
1948 used the familiar tactics of “divide and rule”, exploit-
ing to the utmost the possibilities which rivalling national-
istic movements offered. For the masses it employed nation-
ist and religious incitement and provocation, which proved
to be eﬁective. It employed Jewish policemen against Arab
population and vice versa. For the leaders it employed
diplomacy, “white papers ", round-table conferences, giving

contradictory promises to both sides and acting as . media-
tors”. It succeeded in diverting what threatened to become
an anti-imperialist struggle into the channels of national-
istic strife.

The first important statement of British policy on Pales-
tine wass et out in a private letter from Arthur James
Balfour, Foreign Minister in Lloyd George’s Cabinet, to
Lord Rothschild. This become known as “The Balfour
Declaration ”.

It reads as follows:

Foreign Omce,
2nd November, 1917.
Dear Lord Rothschild,

I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of
His Majesty's Government the following declaration of sym-
pathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been sub-
mitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet: " His Majesty's
Government view with favour the establishment in Pales-
tine of a National home for the Jewish people and will use
their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this
object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be
done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of
existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights

and political status enjoyed by the Jews in any other
country”. I should be grateful if you would bring this

declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.
Yours sincerely,
- Arthur James Balfour.

We will not analyse here in detail the wording of this
document (which with extraordinary impudence refers to
the Palestine Arabs who outniimbered the Jalestine Jews
by about eight to _one, as “existing non-Jewish communi-
ties’) ‘but, comment brieﬂy on its main motives. The
British Govememnt was engaged ‘at that time -in the war
‘against Germany, whose ally in the Middle East was
Turkey. The Balfour Declaration was -meant to rally the
Jews all over the world (including those in Germany,
America, Austria and Palestine) _to -its side. Moreover, being
well aware of the aspirations of Arab Nationalism, it was
calculated to supply Zionist hopes with a political founda-
tion to use as a counterweight to Arab Nationalism. Similar
promises of national independence were given to the
Arabs ‘through Capt. Lawrence and Ronald Storrs. The chief
architect of ‘the British policy was Herbert Samuel, who
later became High Commissioner for Palestine in the early
years of the British Mandate. Himself a Zionist (although
not an extremist) he cogently argued the_case_ for estab-
lishing a Jewish homeland as a bastion of-British policy in
the Middle East in a memorandum to the Cabinet in March,
1915. The contradictory promises were a typical manifesta-
tion of the “divide and rule " policy of the Foreign Ofllce.

Even before these promises were_h=anded out to the
‘‘ natives ”, the whole area was divided between British and
French imperialism in the Sykes-Picot agreement (1916)
which dissected the Ottoman Empire two years before its
downfall. In (1922 the British government implemented the
Balfour letter by an official white paper and in order to
pacify the enraged Arabs for the Sykes-Picot and Balfour
"betrayal ”, granted “independence ” to Trans-Jordan in
1923 and appointed Abdallah as ruler.

The calculated ambiguities and “ contradictions” in the
British Foreign policy increased the unrest and hostilities
between Jews and Arabs, and involved considerable blood-
shed. In the late 30's this factor turned from an asset into
a liability. The religious, feudal and bourgeois elements in
Arab "Nationalism welcomed the rise of fascism in Germany
and Italy, as fellow enemies of British Iinperiaiisrn. Con-
tacts between these camps worried the British. The oil-
fields, pipelines and Suez Canal seemed in danger. Zionist
demands for more independence and increased immigration
quotas for European Jews fleeing from persecution were
other issues which had to be handled. too. But the Foreign

3

 

 
 

Ofﬁce, conﬁdent that the Nazis would never consider the
Zionists as potential allies, produced another white paper
in 1939, aimed at currying favour with the Arabs. It stated:

“His Majesty’s Government now declare unequivocably
that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should
become a Jewish state. . . . It should be a state in which the
two peoples in Palestine, Arabs and Jews, share authority
in government in "such a way that the essential interests of
each are secured. . . .’ _ . V

This, brieﬂy, was the situation on the eve of World
War II.

THE PALESTINE PROBLEM:
FROM WORLD WAR 11 TO THE ‘PRESENT DAY

During the Second World War, new economic and poli-
tical factors revolutionised the Palestine situation.

Before the war-, the Palestine economy (especially the
industrial and manufacturing sector) was dominated by the
British metropolitan economy. The development of local
light industry particularly was hampered by imports of
consumer goods from Britain. Partly as a result of this,
even in the Jewish community (numbering on the eve
of the war about 500,000 out of a total of 1,750,000),
noticeable anti-British tendencies were beginning to form.

,-The war brought about an unprecedented boom in the
Palestine economy. Palestine became a major base for the
Rritish garrison in the Middle East. which had to be housed.
clothed, equipped" and fed. Supply lines from Britain were
disrupted by the -war, and the British economy was- over-
strained by the war effort. The British had to rely to a
large extent on the local economy, and they encouraged
its rapid development. In the Arab sector unemployment
disappeared as thousands of workers were employed to
build camps, roads and airﬁelds. But whereas Arab industry
was not ready to beneﬁt fully from the enormously in-
creased demand, the Jewish sector was already organised
along modern lines and had considerable reserves of
manpower.

It therefore drew the maximum beneﬁt from the in-
creased demand and entered a period of great expansion,
known as “ The Prosperity ”. Whole industries grew from
modest beginnings to formidable size within a period of
four to ﬁve years. By 1942 there were 6,600 Jewish indus-
trial enterprises, employing about 56,000 workers and pro-
ducing at the rate of £20m. per year. The level of produc-
tion in 1942 was more than double that of 1939 in the
food, textile, metal, machinery and chemical -industries-

- treble in the electrical ‘appliances industry. The Palestine

diamond industry (exclusively in Jewish hands) grew at an
even more spectacular rate as -the European centres were
cut off from their raw materials (in S. Africa): from 1,000
carats (valued at £25,000) in 1940 to 58,000 carats (valued
£2.6m.) in 1943 and to 138,000 carats (£6m.) in 1945.

When the war ended, industrial growth slowed abruptly,
and imports from Britain again menaced local industry-
but by now the wartime growth had made the Jewish
sector of the economy a force to be reckoned with. It did
not want to return to the pre-war dominance by Britain
and by now a much larger section of the Jewish population
had a stake in maintaining industrial expansion. This new
situation provided the economic impetus for the post-war
demands of the Jewish community for political indepen-
dence. Unlike the Arabs, the Jewish community had ‘made
no such demands before World War II because it was clear
that an independent Palestine would be a state with an
Arab majority. The new Jewish dominance of the economy
was one of the main factors that brought abount a change
of policy.

4

Even more signiﬁcant were new political factors, which
derived chieﬂy from the rise and defeat of fascism in
Europe. During the 30's many right-wing Arab nationalists
had regarded’German and Italian ‘fascism as allies in the
struggle against British imperialism. Like other nationalists
throughout the British empire, they maintained this atti-
tude throughout the war. in 1945 this policy was shown
to have been wrong in principle, and also to be a grave
tactical and moral disadvantage: Few Arabs served in the
British army and, as a result, the Arabs, unlike the Jews,
failed to gain experience in modern organised warfare.
Moreover, the right-wing nationalists, having supported the
losing side, were demoralized by the allied victory and
found it diﬂicult to resume the momentum of the pre-war
struggle for political independence.

For the Jews the question of which side to support in the
war hardly arose at all. A fascist Zionist party had existed

during the 30's and had collaborated closely with Italian

and Polish fascism. But the majority of Zionists maintained
their pro-British orientation. By 1939 Nazi policy towards
the Jews had forced even the fascist faction into the British
camp. Of the 500,000 Palestine Jews, 50,000 volunteered
for the British forces, encouraged and organised by the
Zionist leadership. By the time the war ended 10% of the
Jewish population had considerable military experience.

The Nazi crimes against the Jews also gave Zionists an
entirely new status in the international arena. Previously,
it had been a minority trend amongst the world's 18,000,000
Jews, with the majority either indifferent or hostile. After
the extermination of 6,000,000 European Jews by Nazism,
many more were attracted by the idea of an independent
Jewish state. Zionism, which had always accepted anti-
semitism, became a major political tendency even among
Jews who had _no intention of personally emigrating to
Palestine. The World Powers began to regard Zionism as
the representative of the whole Jewish people.

The war left large numbers of Jewish refugees in Europe,
many of whom, encouraged by the Zionists, wanted to emi-
grate to Palestine. The Palestine Arabs had no wish to
become a minority in their own country, pressed the British
government to stop Jewish emigration. The Zionists there-
upon began to organise clandestine emigration on a large
scale. The British tried to prevent this not only because of
Arab pressure but also because they were worried -by the
rising tendencies towards independence among the Pales-
tine Jews. World opinion, especially in Europe and the
U.S., was still reeling with the shock of discovering the
enormity of the Nazi war-crimes and inevitably sympathized
with the refugees. The resulting political atmosphere was
hostile both to the British government and to Arab nation-
alism. This atmosphere persists today‘ and is one of the
major -assets of Zionism.

The emergence of the U.S. as amajor world power after
World War 11 and the decline of British imperialism brought
about a gradual shift of Zionist orientation from Britain
towards the U.S. A strong Zionists lobby was built up in
Washington and at the same time the pro-American ele-
ments in world Zionism gained supremacy over the pro-
British faction.

The combined effect of these economic and political
factors precipitated the clash between the Zionists and the
British govemrment. The war had transformed the Jewish
community in Palestine into a nation with its own economy,
army, political organisations, language and ideology. Its
economic interests had become incompatible with direct
colonial rule. It clashed with British policy on immigration,
in a world atmosphere favourable to Zionism and hostile to
Britain. Zionist re-orientation towards the U.S. and the
growing American interests in the Middle East hastened
the collision.

In this new situation the Zionist demanded political in-
dependence in Palestine. The right-wing demanded im-

 

mediate independence for the whole of Palestine under
Jewish minority rule; the centrists favoured the partition
of Palestine between Arabs and Jews; the left-wing Zion-
ists (among them parts of the present-day “ Napam ” party)
wanted to postpone independence until the Jews became
a majority through increased immigration.

In essence there were three parties directly involved in
the Palestine problem. British imperialism; the Jewish
minority (about 0.6m.); and the Arab majority (about 1m.).
Each of these "had its own demands. in Conﬂict with the
other two. But—- mainly owing to the deformation of Arab
society by the process of Jewish colonization-«the Pales-
tine Arabs did not in fact constitute -a major independent
political force in -the period 1945 - 1947. The struggle was
waged mainly between the Zionistsand Britain.

During these years a series of conflicts, accompanied by
armed violence, occurred between the Jewish community
and the British administration. The Palestine Arabs, al-
though they still outnumbered the Jews by -about two to
one, remained relatively passive-—-a complete reversal of
the situation during the 20's and 30’s, when Arab struggle
for independence had a mass character and often used
violent means. The British government, preoccupied with
a fuel crisis and Indian independence, neared desperation.

In 1947 Britain referred the Palestine problem to the
U.N. expecting disagreement in the UN. to lead to a
renewal of the mandate. This would lend a new lease of life
to the precarious British authority in the area. In Novem-
ber, 1947, the General Assembly adopted a resolution
recommending the partition of Palestine into two inde-
pendent, but economically linked, states. This solution was

a victory for Zionism and was strongly opposed by the .

Arabs (who, of -course, demanded an undivided indepen-
dent Arab Palestine), and by British imperialism which

-struggled to retain its inﬂuence and power.

Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. supportedythe resolution;
the U.S. because they considered it a convenient way of
gaining a foothold in the Middle East and replacing British
imperialism; the U.S.S.R. because it considered it the most
practical way to drive British imperialism out of one of its
strbngholds. The U.S.S.R. probably underestimated the
strong links between Zionism and American imperviallsm.
As for the Foreign Ofﬁce; it was worried not only because
the creation of a Zionist. state meant loss. of inﬂuence to
the U.-S. but also because the establishing of an independent
Arab state in Palestine could have repercussions in the
Arab world. _ “

After the UN. partition resolution, the British tried to
provoke the Palestine Arabs against the Jewish population,
to prove that a British presence was necessary to keep law
and order. This attempt failed. Next, the British organised
in Syria an irregular volunteer army (headed by Fawzi el
Kaukji) which entered Palestine and attacked Jewish settle-
ments. When this attempt failed too, the British ﬁnally
decided to employ the regular armies of Trans-Jordan,
Syria, Egypt and Iraq in order to wage open war against
the Zionist state, which (according to the U.N. resolution),
was to come into existence on 15th May, 1948. The political
and military plans for this invasion were drawn up by
General I. (C. Clayton (one of the main British colonial
agents in the Middle East) in a meeting of the Arab chiefs
of staffs held early in 1948 at Bludan, Syria.

The 1948 war became a military conflict between the
Zionists and the Arab armies. These armies were not, how-
ever, playlng an independent role‘ for achieving Arab inde-
pendence in Palestine, but rather serving British interests,
through the puppet regimes of Farouk, Abdallah and Nuri
Sa’id. The war was used by these regimes to divert the
internal -anti-imperialist struggle (especially in Egypt and
Iraq) into an imperialist-sponsored Holy War. The conduct

of the war exposed the utter corruption of these regimes
and hastened their downfall. '

The fate of Palestine was decided not on the battle-
ﬁeld, but also in secret talks between the Zionist leaders
and Abdallah. These‘ talks started immediately after the
adoption of the partition resolution by the U.N. and went
on until 1950. In these talks the -two “friendly enemies”,
although ostensibly at war with each‘ other, agreed‘ to
divide -between them, the territory which the UN. resolu-

’ tion had allotted to the-Palestinian Arabs, as well as Jeru-

salem which, according to the resolution, was to become a
separate unit under the UN. administration. The armistice
agreement coincided; more or less, with the results of the
political negotiations between the Zionist leaders and
Abdallah. - .

A new set-up was" thus established in Palestine: 20,000
sq. km. (instead of the 14,000 sq. km. allotted to it in the
U.N. resolution) became Israel; and the remaining territory
(except the Gaza strip) was annexed by Abdallah, who re-
named his kingdom “Jordan” (instead of Trans-Jordan).
This new set-up expressed the new balance of inﬂuence
among the Western Powers. The area of the Zionist state
was lost to British imperialism and came under U.S. inﬂu-
ence; while the area annexed by Abdallah represented the
remnants of British inﬂuence. This new division of spheres

of inﬂuence received formal -conﬁrmation in the Tri-partite

(U.S., Britain and France) Declaration of May, 1950.

This state of aﬂairs, established as a consequence of the
1948 war, persists today and is referred to as the “ status
quo ” in the Middle East.-It is an inherently unstable situa-
tion because the war was not terminated by a political
solution of the Palestine problem but only by a temporary
Armistice Agreement. Since Israel is interested in preserv-
ing the “ status quo ”, it has become more and more depen-
dent on the Western Powers who guarantee its continuance.
The same applies, of course, to the Jordanian regime, which
because of its military weakness also depends indirectly on

Israel. In spite of their seemingly hostile relations, these .

two regimes share a common interest’-—to preserve the
“ status quo ". Thus, the sum total of. the relations between
Imperialism, the Zionists, and the various Arab parties
which was known up to 1948 as " The Palestine Problem "
was transformed in 1948 into the “ Israeli-Arab conflict",
the latter being a direct continuation (albeit in a new form)

of the former.

The losers and victims of the 1948 war were the Palestine
Arabs, who hardly participated in the war. Their right to
self-determination, which previously nobody — not even the
Zionist leaders—- had denied, was violated. Most of them
became homesless refugees. The fate of those who remained

. in the area held by Israel was hardly better. They had lived

ever since under military rule and are subject to constant
and severe repression. The land remaining in Arab hands
is still gradually but systematically expropriated, often by
administrative subterfuge, to make way for Zionist develop-
ment. The Arabs are second-class citizens in their own
country.

In the early 50’s the anti-imperialist struggle intensiﬁed
throughout the Arab world. In the Arab East this intensi-
ﬁcation was, in part, a result of the Palestine war. Britain,
already too weak to defend its old positions, had to accept
the fact that the U.S. was becoming dominant in this part
of the woarld as in others. The global policy of the U.S.
to surround the U.S.S.R by a chain of bases and military
pacts was welded in the Middle East with the traditional
British colonial policy into a single anti-Soviet and imperi-
alist policy. Throughout the 50’s these two Powers tried
to create a military alliance of Middle-Eastern countries,
to serve as a link in the chain of antisoviet alliances
stretching from Scandinavia to Korea and to strengthen
Western domination in the Middle East. .

This policy encountered great diiiiculties, because the

5

 

   
   

Arab masses were aware of its imperialist character and
opposed it violently. On the government level, the consis-
tent refusal of Egypt and Syria to participate in such pacts
undermined the whole of Western policy in the region. The
Israeli government on the other hand, was always willing
to participate actively in any such scheme, not only because
of the traditional links between Zionism and Imperialism,
but also (and more speciﬁcally) because Israel's adherence
to the “status quo ” made it a natural ally of imperialism
——an ally who identiﬁed his own national interests-—indeed
his very existence —with the Imperialist presence in the
Middle East. .

The Israeli position was fully understood and utilized by
the West. Whenever the governments of Egypt, Syria or
Jordan attacked the Anglo-American schemes, Israel was
used ‘as a threat against them. These threats often material-
ised inthe form of armed raids by Israeli forces. Jordan,
particularly, was raided during the period when the el
Nabulsi government there conducted anti-Western policies.
Usually, after such a raid,.the Arab government concerned
would turn to the West and ask for arms. The reply was
always: “Join the Baghdad Pact, and you will get arms ”.

This Western policy was ﬁnally defeated when, after the
big Israeli raid on Gaza on 28th April, 1955, Nasser
refused to submit to Western pressure ~ and turned to
Czechoslovakia for arms. This broke the arms monopoly
of Imperialism in the area, and considerablyweakened its
political inﬂuence. From this time onwards, the Soviet
Union emerged as a protagonist in the Middle East scene.
This development, followed by the nationalisation of the
Suez Canal, drove Britain and France to desperation. Em-
ploying an Israeli invasion of Egypt as a pre-arranged pre-
text, they launched a direct military attack on Egypt in
order. to regain possession of the Canal and to overthrow
the neutralist and anti-imperialist governments in the
Middle East. The fate of this aggressionis well known.

For Israel the failure of the Suez invasion meant that she
was unable to force the Arab world to accept the “status
quo ”. From that time the Palestine problem entered a.
period of stalemate.

THE PALESTINE PROBLEM:
_ PRESENT AT'ITI‘UDES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

Having examined in the two previous articles the his- A

torical development of the Palestine situation, we now turn
to present attitudes -— of the Zionists on the one hand, who
present a comparatively united front on the main points:
and, on the other hand the Arab countries where, because
of conﬂicting internal forces and interests, the unity con-
sists of words rather than deeds. _

The Zionist leaders of Israel are generally satisﬁedwith
the present stalemate. It is true that originally Zionism
aimed to get hold of all of Palestine, and that for most
Zionists this included the whole of the territory west of
the River Jordan. An extremist minority had, and still has,
aspirations to the eastern bank, but the defeat of the Suez
aggression brought home to the Zionist leadership the
lesson that even dire-ct military partnership with imperi-
alist powers cannot, in the world of ‘today, achieve a
further expansion of Israel. At present they consider expan-
sio-nism unrealistic.

But they do consider as realistic a policy aimed at con-
solidating and perpetpating the “status quo ”. This is the
principle object of Israeli foreign policy. In carrying out
this policy, they rely on three factors.

First, that Israel is the most stable and reliable ally of
imperialism in the area. In return, imperialism—which
has an interest in preserving such an ally—grants them
protection. Their hope is that the West will always be able
to grant them this protection and will never let them down.

6

    

Second, Zionism has a powerful ally in Western public
opinion. The 5,000,000 American Jews constitute a strong
pressure group exerting considerable inﬂuence not only on
U.S. oﬂicial policy but also on American public opinion.
Even that section of Western public opinion which opposes
imperialism, is reluctant to criticise Israel. This is a result
of the deep feeling 0 f guilt in the West after the massacre
of 6,000,000 Jews by the Nazis. Even socialists in the West
often mistakenly identify anti-Zionism with anti-semitism.
Zionist propaganda has another great advantage: it aims
at consolidating an existing situation and therefore
preaches peace. Arab policy wishes to change the situation,
and cannot simply preach peace, but has the difﬁcult task
of explaining the injustice of the “status quo ”. Thus the
Zionists appear as peace seekers, the Arabs as aggressors.

Third, the Zionists rely on military force. Knowing that
eventually the balance of conventional forces will be
against them, they have recently started to develop nuclear
weapons. They hope that possession of such weapons will
make it impossible for the Arabs to upset the “ status quo ".
Alternatively, should the Great Powers force them to give
up possession of nucuear weapons, the Zionists hope to get
in exchange for this an Eas-t-West guarantee to maintain
the “ status quo ”.

In the long run, the Zionist policies cannot succeed. Even

if they do manage to maintain the “ status quo’ for a
relatively long period, Israel will remain a small beseiged
fortress, economically unviable and dependent on outside
economic aid for its very existence (about $400m. per year
flow _into the country since 1950, to balance a constant
deﬁcit in the balance of payments). Its own natural re-
sources are meagre, and its markets extremely limited.
It cannot -compete with the advanced economies of the
European countries, and Arab markets are closed‘ to it. It
is only the world-wide fund-raising activities of Zionist
organisations such as the Jewish Agency, and the repara-
tions paid by the Germans which keep the standard of
living‘ in Israel at an artiﬁcially high level. If Israel’s care-
fully cultivated image in the West-of a democratic,
refugee sheltering, peace-loving country were seriously
dented, the economic consequences could be very serious.
The inevitable decline of imperialist inﬂuence coupled with
the progressive uniﬁcation of the Arab world, will make
Israel's position. even more precarious.

Arab attitudes can be broadly divided into two: those
of the feudal regimes; and those of the bourgeois nation-
alist parties. Superﬁcially similar, the attitudes of the two
groups are backed by very different deeds and motivations.
Neither pro-pose a political solution" to the Palestine
problem.

The Arab feudal regimes, like Zionism, had always been
natural allies of Western imperialism. Both waged a
struggle against rising bourgeois nationalism, therefore,
these regimes considered Zionism as the lesser of the two
evils. Today, as in the past, they share common political
interests with Zionism as -both depend for their existence
‘on Imperialist inﬂuence in the area.

The feudal regimes cannot uphold such a policy publicly
in the Arab world where the masses are anti-imperialist and
clamour for political independence. To cover up their
cooperation with imperialism they put out virulent anti-
Zionist and antiJewish propaganda. A classic example
occurred during King Feisal’s visit to Washington in June,
1966. While conferring with President Johnson on con-
taining Nasser and his policies, and thereby running the
risk of revealing his pro-imperialist policies to the Arab

world, a press question him the opportunity to declare that ~ I
‘‘all the Jews in the world support Israel, and therefore 1 
are enemies of the Arabs ”. The mayor of New York city, 
which has more Jews than .Israel itself, promptly cancelled  ~
an official dinner with him. Feisal could only congratulate . ,

  

himself on this chance to consolidate his tarnished image
in the Ara‘b world.

Publicly, the feudal regimes advocate the annihilation of
Israel: privately-they cooperate with it. In some cases
(Jordan particularly), they depend on it for their existence.
Whenever the Palestinian Arabs in Jordan threaten t.he
regime of King Hussein (grandson of Abdallah), the
Israeli army moves to the armistice lines, ready to inter-
vene if Hussein is overthrown. The rebellious masses are
immediately “ paciﬁed ” on the grounds that only Hussein's
army can defend them from the aggressive Israelis. Al-
though Hussein’s throne has rocked violently more than
once, it has stood all attacks up to now, thanks to the inter-
vention of Israel, which would ‘regard the overthrow of
Hussein as a violation of the “ status quo ” —-"a new regime
‘in Jordan might refuse to recognise the Abdallah-Ben
Gurion pact of 1948, and the Tri-partite Declaration of
1950.

Thus, whereas on the surface the feudal regimes appear
to be the most extreme enemies of Zionism, they are as
concerned as Israel to consolidate and perpetuate imperial-
ist inﬂuence and presence in the area. Zionism, and Arab
feudalism are, as always, “ friendly enemies”.

The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties throughout the
Arab world approach the Palestine problem through the
United Nations resolutions. This policy was first formulated
by Nasser at the Bandung Conference (1955) and it was
unanimously adopted. This policy meant essentially two
things: (1) Israel should repatriate the Arab refugees
(according to a 1949 UN. resolution); (2) Israel ‘should
give up the "territory annexed by it as a result of the
secret pact with Abdallah. This policy would reduce the
area of Israel but would not affect its Zionist character.

In fact, this conciliatory programme (which represents
a considerable concession to Zionism) would not provide
a stable solution of the Palestine _problem. It would prob-
ably be as dangerous as "the “status quo”. A smaller
Zionist state would still be dependent on Western imperial-
ism, and as such would continue to threaten Arab progress
towards unity and socialism..This programme was raised
again by Bourgiba in order to embarrass Nasser, who
dropped this formula after Suez, realising that although
the slogan of adhering to the U.N. resolutions had an
attractive propaganda value, it did not provide for a stable
solution. Moreover, since Nasser's approach to the problem
of Arabvunity is a basically bourgeois one, relegating class
contradictions within Arab society to second place, he was

led to seek an understanding with the reactionary regime,

in Jordan. But this regime is as much opposed to the
U.N. partition resolution as the Zionists are, because Jordan
too annexed part of Palestine territory. Nasser is now not
so keen to raise the U.N. formula.

Today, the Nasserites and Ba’athists do not have any
political solution. Instead, they talk in military terms and
argue endlessly with each other whether to go to war with
Israel (“liberate Palestine") in the near future (Syrian
Ba’ath) or to postpone the war until a -considerable pro-

gress is made towards Arab unity (Nasser). This military‘

approach evades the main question. War can, at the very
most, serve as a means to political solution; it can never
replace one. Even if awar against Israel were to be won,
the question of the political future of Palestine would
remain unsolved. A military Arab victory would, at most,
destroy the Zionist regime, but 2,000,000 Jews would
remain, and probably constitute a problem similar to the
Kurdish problem, unless a political solution is implemented.
As is well known, the Nasserites and the Ba’athists do not
have a political solution even to the Kurdish problem.

The slogan of “liberating Palestine”, although emotion-
ally satisfying, has even more serious political disadvan-

tages. In the first place, it forces moderate Israelis and
even anti-Zionist Israelis (there are some) to side with the
Zionist government in sheer self defence. The result is a
rare degree of solidarity between public opinion and
government. Internal dissension, which would inevitably
arise in a normal situation, is muffled. In this atmosphere
few Israelis dare question their country's reliance on
imperialism, which at least protects their lives.

M(‘)l‘e0'W:‘.I‘, this simple slogan damages the Arab case
in the world arena. Apart from the unpopularity of
military solutions, it also has the fault of identifying an
entire population with the policies of the state, and requir-
ing them to pay the price for those policies. Such over-
simpliﬁcations are no longer acceptable to progressive
world opinion, especially anti-imperialist elements who
demand. political solutions to political problems. Even the
North Vietnamese are careful to draw ‘a distinction between
the policies of Washington and the American people. As a
result of these factors the Arab nationalists, in spite of the
moral tightness of their case, have been consistently losing
the propaganda war ever since 1948.

Any‘ serious political solution -to the Palestine problem
must take into consideration that, unlike the European
settler communities in South Africa, Rhodesia or Algeria,
the Jews in Palestine constitute not an upper class but a
whole nation, with a complete class structure of its own.
The fact that this new nation was created artiﬁcially
through Zionist immigration does not alter the fact that it
exists. Whereas the political set-up of this community can
be changed or destroyed, the nation itself cannot be elimin-
ated.~A stable solution must therefore fulﬁll two basic re-
quirements: it must abolish the Zionist character of Israel,
and it must establish the self-determination _of this nation
in a form which is in accordance with the interests of the
Arab masses, with socialism a.nd uniﬁcation.

It is clear that the existence of an Israeli state (whatever

the size of its territory) isolated from the Arab world is g

contrary to the interests of the Arab masses. It is also
contrary to the interests of the Israeli masses. Such a state
cannot .exist without outside support and will always
necessarily be. dependent on imperialism. The inherent
instability of such a situation will always be a threat over
the heads of the Israelis. A stable solution must therefore

provide for a non-Zionist form of self-determination for ,

Israel within the framework of an Arab Socialist Union.
The Palestine problem is, in fact, closely linked with the
class struggle in the Arab world and with the problem of
uniﬁcation. This is the reason why those forces in the Arab
world which are unable to solve the problem of Arab unity
are also unable to solve the Palestine problem.

Another aspect of the Palestine problem is the self-

- determination of the Palestinian Arabs. Should they exer-

cise this right and establish a state of their own? Naturally,
both the Zionists and Hussein are hysterically opposed to
any such suggestion. But progressive elements are also un-
decided on this issue, believing that the creation of a new.
small Arab state would have a harmful effect on the process
of unification.

Here, too, any solution must. be compatible with the
interests of uniﬁcation and socialism throughout the
Middle East. If a political form of self-determination of the
Palestine Arabs be established (because it is theirs by
right) it must come about in away that will conform with
the interests of the masses throughout the Middle East. A
uniﬁcation based on the denial of the right to self-deter-
mination is morally, and politically, wrong, and whenever
practised in the past has introduced suspicion, mistrust and
instability into the union. If these are to be eliminate_d
from the Union of the Middle Eastern states, the funda-
mental nationalrights of the constituent members must be
fulﬁlled. They should be given up by consent, not coercion.

Taking these issues into account we believe that the

following principles have to be incorporated in any viable

future solution of the problem:

1. Israel will be de-Zionized, i.e. all present laws and prac-
tices discriminating between Jews and non-Jews imple-
menting Jewish supremacy will be abolished. In par-
ticular, the laws granting automatic rights to every Jew
in the world to emigrate to Israel and granting automatic
citizenship to every Jewish. immigrant -(denying these
rights to every non-Jew, in particular— to the Palestine
refugees) will be abolished. Applicationsfor immigra-
tion and citizenship will be decided on individually,.on
their own merit, without any racial or religious dis-
crimination. The state of "the Jews would thus become
the state of the Israelis, i.e. ‘the political expression of
its inhabitants, whatever their_ race, nationality or
religion. ‘

. ‘The Palestine refugees will be granted the right of
repatriation. Those wishing" to return should be fully
integrated socially, ‘ politically and economically by
Israel. Those prefering not to Lretum will be adequately
-compensated for their property‘ and personal suffering.

. All existing “security ” and _discriminatory measures
"against the Israeli Arabs will be. abolished. All expro-
priations and damages in land, property, and personal
injury incurred through such measures and .“ emergency
laws” will be fully compensated. _

. Israel will adopt an anti-imperialist foreign policy,
actively supporting the forces struggling for socialism
and uniﬁcation in the Arab world.

. The Arab s‘truggle for uniﬁcation and socialismwill be
car1'ied out with a readiness to make 'a non-Zionist and-
socialist Israel a partner to the Union of the Middle
Eastern states. The right to self-determination of the
Israelis will be recognized.

. Pending the establishment of the Union, and. the over-

coming of the barriers set up ‘by the national states in
the area, the Arab states will carry out a policy of
normalizing their economical, political and cultural rela-
tions with non-Zionist Israel.

. The Palestine Arabs will be enabled to decide by them-
selves, without outside interference, how to exercise
their right to self-determination. Israel and ‘the Arab
states will refrain from any steps which might prejudice
or interfere with their decision. '

. Should the Palestine Arabs recide to establish an inde-
pendent state. prior to, and pending,_the establishment
of the Union (or federation), the states which at present
control parts of the territory west of the Jordan as a
result‘ of the 1949 Armistice Agreements should by
mutual consent, make the necessary territorial arrange-
ments to fatcil-itate the establishment of this state.

' This programme is’ essentially non-nationalistic, and it is

unlikely that any nationalist in the area -(whether Jew or
Arab‘) will hasten to endorse it. On the contrary, vicious
attacks by -nationalists from both sides are to be expected,
yet this will -be a- good sign of its internationalistic char-
acter. -Attacks of the nationali-stscan only try to cover up
the fact that theyjhave no political solution of their own
to this problem, which is ,-part of the problem of socialist
uniﬁcation of the Middle East.

The Palestine problem demonpstrates the fact that nation-
alistic ooiicies; are unable to overcome the problem" of uni-
ﬁcation. of national states and unable to solve the problem
of national oppression». They can only turn. oppressed into
oppressor. The underlying problems remain.. Only those
socialists -who _have gone beyond nationalistic ideology and
policies hold the key to a stable solution of the‘ joint
problems’ of abolishing national oppression and unifying
the national states. ,

ZIONISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM

The relation between Zionism and anti-semit-ism is sur-
rounded by an emotional smoke-screen which deters many
people, including Jews, from voicing their. apprehensions
concerning Zionism.

This reluctance is well known to the Zionist public-
relations men who draw and harp on it incessantly. Often
this harping becomes indistinguishable from emotional
blackmail.

The social forces from which Zionism emerged were two-
fold: The Jewish poor of Tsarist Russia whose lives and
livelihoods were in constant danger; The Jewish middle-
class in Western Europe well integrated in the economy
but not in society.

In East Europe it was a ﬁght for civil rights, in the West
—for integration. Both‘ aspects have a similarity to the
struggle of the American Negroes. The similarity is not in
appearances only. When the struggles for civil rights and
integration were frustrated (the first because the Tsarist
regime deliberately used the Jews for scapegoats; The
second— because rights, economic welfare, and enlighten-
ment failed to produce speedy social integration-) many
Jews became disillusioned with their previous aims and
searched for a new one. This was readily found in a new
illusion which took the previous disillusion as a starting
point. It generalized the previous defeats by stating that
minority persecution is inherent in Human psychology,

that all ‘attempts to overcome it by legislation, education,
integration are, necessarily, futile. It declared that there is
no point in ﬁghting a phenomenon which is endemic to
Human nature; instead, one must accept it and accommo-
date oneself to‘ this inevitable, eternal, evil.

The founder of politicalZionism,~a Western, assimilated
Jew who was shocked by the “Dreyfuss affair,” summed
up his ‘conclusion on anti-semitism thus: “ In Paris, as I
have said, I achieved a freer attitude towards anti-Semitism,
which I now began to understand historically, and to
pardon; Above all, I recognized the emptiness, and futility,
of trying to ‘combat’ anti-Semitism.” (“The diaries of
Theodore Herzl,” p.6 Gollanz. London ’58).

This pessimistic starting point, which postulates an im-
mutable “Human nature” inherently evil, is modulated,
moderated, and diluted by oiﬁcial Zionist spokesmen. But
it IS voiced loud and clear by those who do not have to
make allowance for tact, tactics, or diplomacy. The follow-
ing quotation is a typical example:

“The generation in which Zionism was born had great
faith in human progress and fraternity. It accepted Rous-
seau’s theory that Hum-an nature is basically good: let
people live decently and Human society will become angel’s
society. . . . The minority must realize that human nature is
basically evil, that inherent traits of human psychology and
biology are such that a stronger majority will always treat
