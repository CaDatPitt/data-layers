enemy and that the struggle against German fascism must be
waged with increasing strength and fury, and at the same
time, conducting precisely such heroic resistance to the Japan-
ese fascists as hascharacterized the ﬁghting of thevChinese at
Changsha, the American and Filipino troops in the Bataan
Peninsula of Luzon, and the Dutch in the Netherland East
Indies.

What is required to strengthen such a resolute conduct of
the war in the Far East is the adoption of a new and bold
approach to the colonial peoples of the Far East, takinginto
full account their national aspirations -and hopes, arming
and drawing fully into the armed struggle the Filipino peo-
ple, the Malayan people, the Netherland East Indian-people,
the Burmese people who stand ready to throw themselves into
the struggle against the Japanese invaders in the most self-
sacriﬁcing and heroic manner. The proposal of the Chinese
Communist Party for an alliance of all the Asiatic peoples
is directed toward accomplishing this aim of enlisting the full
and enthusiastic participation of all these nations in the
struggle to defend their native land against the Axis.

Appeasers' Policy of Surrender

There is, however, a second approach to these problems
which stands in diametric contradiction to such a policy. This
is contained in the insidious propaganda of the N. Y. “Daily
News" which attempts to obscure the indivisible character
of the war against the Axis, to minimize the role of Hitler
Germany as the main enemy, to divert America.’s attention
completely to the Far East, but which at the same time ad-
vocates a policy of surrender in the Paciﬁc. This takes the
form of such treacherous and defeatist military advice as
that which says that the Philippines are incapable of being
defended with success, that American forces should retire to
the Hawaiian Islands, that the Malayan people, the Dutch
East Indies and Australia should be left to their own fate.

We are thus confronted with a situation where those who
correctly maintain that the war is one and indivisible and

' that the main enemy is Hitler Germany advocate a resolute,

10

 

 

 

determined and successful struggle against japan at every
point in the Far East while the Fifth Columnists who attempt
to divert American attention completely to the Paciﬁc ad-
vocate a policy of surrender of all the positions of the United
Nations to the Axis drive in the Far East.

There is nothing paradoxical about this situation. It is the
logical and inevitable contrast between the United Nations
policy of one war and the Axis policy of one-by-one war.

The organization of the world coalition against the Axis
has advanced with great speed since the signing of the Pact
of the United Nations. In recent weeks important steps toward
drawing all the countries of Latin America into this coalition
were made as a result of the conferences at Rio de Janeiro.
To develop this coaliton further, the next step must be taken
by our country of strengthening the existing Pact of the
United Nations by entering into a full-ﬂedged political, eco-
nomic and military alliance with the Soviet Union, Great
Britain and China as well as with all nations ﬁghting the
Axis. Such a full political, economic and military alliance
between the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union
and China, based upon the principle of equality of participa-
tion and leadership will form the indestructible bulwark
of a victorious world coalition to win the war and solve the
problems of postwar peace and security.

Tendencies, such as those expressed by the “New York
Times,” to negate the principle of equal partnership in such
a world coalition by discussion of exclusive Anglo-American
leadership of the coalition can only be harmful to the common
cause.

Unifed Nations Are Taking ihe Offensive

The strengthening of the anti-Axis coalition through the
signing of the Pact of the United Nations coincides with the
transition of the war against the Axis into a new stage, a stage
in which the anti-Axis powers are beginning to pass to the
offensive on the military ﬁeld. This is true notwithstanding
the initial and. temporary reverses being suffered in the Pa-
ciﬁc. It is clearly seen in the fact that for the first time since

11

the outbreak of the war, Britain is conducting active military
operationsin Africa. It is seen in the brilliant victories won
by- the Chinese armies at Changsha.-

But most clearly of all this is seen‘ in the turning of the
tide on the Eastern front where, since the early part of De-
cember, the heroic Red Army has been relentlessly hurling
the Nazi hordes westward in a mighty offensive which opens
up the perspective of delivering decisive blows against Hitler

“Itis freely and universally admitted that the most signi-
ﬁcantiand mo.st devastating blows against the Axis are being
delivered by the Red Army in’ the course of its mighty winter

any plan according to which the Nazis are retreating, it is
the Soviet plan, the plan of Stalin, the brilliant strategist of
the Red Army who has personally directed the gigantic and
inspiringvstruggle of the Red Army along -the whole front.’

- No longer is there any superﬁcial attempt to ascribe the
retreat of the Germans as due, not to the operations of the
Red Army, but solely and exclusivelyto the ravages of Gen-
eral Winter. The evidence of Red Armysuccesses in the

S Caucasus and in the Crimea have effectively dispelled this

too easy interpretation. General Winter, of course, is a
doughty-soldier in the service of the Soviet Union. But it was

not General. Winter who drove the Nazis from Rostovy- It

On Guard Against Nazis

But just as important as it is not to underestimate the full
signiﬁcance of the Red Army advances, so we must guard
against any conclusions and opinions which run to the other
extreme. It would be a most serious error to think that the
Nazi armies have already. been defeated, that there is no
longer any need for the American people to concern them-
selves with the Eastern Front. There is ample evidence that.
consciously or unconsciously, such an opinion is being fos-
tered by the very manner, for example, in which most news-
papers deal with the news of ﬁghting on the Eastern From.
Let us understand clearly that the Red Army is inﬂicting
crippling blows against the Nazi hordes, but that the fascist
beast is not yet destroyed. The continuing Red Army vic-
tories are indeed cause for rejoicing but not for complacency.
In fact there is need for serious concern and alarm over the
publicly admitted fact that the pledges made by the United
States for aid to the Soviet Union have been carried out only
by one-half of what had been promised.

There have been attempts by the appeasement forces to
distort the meaning of these Soviet victories, to picture the
advances of the Red Army as a potential danger to Europe
and America. These appeasers dare raise the cry that Com-
munism may soon “over-run” Europe and that the Soviet
Union may, if these victories continue, become “enemy num-
ber three” of America and Britain. This propaganda is noth-
ing more or less than a conscious effort to plump for a fas-
cist victory under guise of saving Europe from the alleged
menace of Communism. It is consciously designed to check
the enthusiasm of the American people for the victories of the
Red Army; to sow dissension and discord between-our coun-
try and our strongest ally and to prevent the acceleration of

material aid from the United States to the Red Army; "When

the German fascist hordes were cutting their way deeper into
the Soviet Union in their march toward Moscow—and, as

events have amply proven, toward New York and San Fran-

cisco via Moscow—these appeasers were not at all disturbed.
But now that the Red Army is driving the enemy back out of

America's Youth Serves the Nation i

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor united the nation
as never before in its history. All classes, all political beliefs,
all sections of the country, Negro and white, youth and adult,
have rallied enthusiastically to the defense of our country.

Of cardinal importance in the’ ﬁrm establishment of this
national unity is the initiative and growing inﬂuence of the
organized labor movement. The labor management confer-
ence which was held immediately following the Pearl Harbor
attack resulted in the adoption by the CIO and AFL of a
no-strike policy which will promote continuous uninterrupted
production of the materials of war in the factories of the coun-
try. This patriotic fulﬁllment by labor of its responsibilities
to the country in the strengthening of national unity has
become a force for the mobilization of millions of workers,
and other sections of 'the population, behind the victory pro-
gram of our country.

Labor’s contribution to helping establish and consolidate
national unity has been greatly stimulated by a whole series
of signiﬁcant advances toward unity of action between the
CIO and AFL on the basis of common support to the war
against the Axis. The establishment of unity of action be-
tween these two great branches of the organized labor move-
ment in a whole series of localities has now been climaxed by
the establishment of a Labor Victory Board composed of three
representatives from each of these two labor federations. This
machinery for uniting the forces and'the strength of the AFL
and the CIO will undoubtedly help labor increase still fur-

ther its already invaluable contribution to the cause of na-
tional unity by giving it a greater voice in the councils of the
government.

The great masses of youth, inﬂuenced and stimulated by the
great example of the labor movement and determined to de-
fend our country, have likewise rallied to our nation's cause,
making their own great contribution to the establishment of
national unity. Through their organizations and movements,

1 6‘

 

  

the masses ‘of, y_oul;h.. have placed themselves with_all..,_ their
enth-Ausia_sm,,wi,th all their talents,, with_ all their energies and
capacities for sacriﬁce and valor at the service of the_nation.
This _deve1o.pment,represents a great change _in the character

‘of the.a.c_tivities of the masses of youth in the United.States.

In thepast, the youth undertook as theirmain task the
mobilization of the resources of the nation to serve the youth.
They projected their special, problems on the broad canvas of
national politics in a great effort to muster the resources of
the nation to serve their special needs. Indoing this, they
were not acting out of selﬁsh considerations. In .mobilizing
the nation to servetheyouth, they were at the same time
serving the nation which sorely needed the idle talents and
abilities of the.yo_uth. .

The accomplishments of youth during this period have
left an indelible impress upon the life of our country. Many
of the institutions which were created in response to the ac-
tivity of the masses of youth such ‘as CCC, NYA and many
others remain as ‘permanent features of the very fabric of
our national life. Many of the most signiﬁcant forces which
play so vital a role~in_the present day contribution of the
youth, their movements--and their organizations, to the war
effort were awakened as currents and factors, of ou_r political
life duringthis period. In one form or another, these, con-
tinue as permanent streams within the body politic of our
national life. ..What distinguished these movements, these
forcesand. these organizations, was their common concern
with awakeningrthe nation-to the problems of youth and to

.mobilizing_the nation to serve its youth.

But today, the whole character of the activities of the masses
of,youth has.changed. What mainly characterizes the youth
today is not itspreoccupation with mobilization of the nation
to-serve theyouth but its concern with mobilizing the masses
of youth ‘IQ ,serve the nation. In doing this, the masses of
youth, their movementstand organizations, are not neglecting
their Own problems today any more thanvtheyvneglected the
},).1;oble_rns,of_.,_the nation in the past. There is no problem that
can be -.o_f-—g_reater concern .to the.-youth than the fate oftheir
nation. Everything that our youth are or hope to-be .is bound

17

  

up with the fate of this nation. Every dream and aspiration of
the youth is dependent upon the victory of our country in
the ﬁght to destroy the Axis monster. Therefore the main
task today is the untiring and enthusiastic mobilization of the
masses of youth to serve the nation. It is this which charac-
terizes the youth movement today.

Our Young Communist League has proudly taken its stand‘
with thisgreat movement of service to the nation. Immedi-
ately following the attack upon Pearl Harbor, our National
Council declared: .

"The Young Communist League unhesitatingly pledges its
patriotic loyalty, its ceaseless and devoted labor, the energies
and resources of its entire organization, the life of its mem-
bers to the service of our country until ﬁnal and irrevocable
victory is won.”

Powerful Initiative of Youth

The services which the masses of youth can render the na
tion within the patriotic stream of national unity would be
inﬁnitely greater if they were brought into full harmony and
concerted action with the labor movement; if the initiative of

, their movements and organizations were boldly released and

given free play. There is still, unfortunately, within cer~
tain inﬂuential circles a reluctance to release this powerful
initiative of the youth. This reluctance stems from old pre~
judices which retain their currency because the new character
of the youth movement has not been properly estimated. The
shortsighted and selﬁsh interests which led certain inﬂuential
circles to regard the youth movement with distrust as a “pres-
sure group” because of its concern with mobilizing the nation
to serve the youth, still blind them to the changes that have
taken place in the mood, the temper and the activity of youth.
But there is today no longer any ground for even the unjusti-
ﬁed misapprehensions of the past. Every class in the nation,
every section of American society, the nation _itself can only
gain by setting into motion a vast movement of youth dedi-
cated to .mobilizing our young people for loyal, tireless and
heroic service to our nation.

l—You+h Serve America in fhe Armed Forces

American youth have been given the eternal honor of serv-
ing in the ranks of our ﬁghting forces and of carrying the flag
of our country to victory on every theater of war on land, at
sea, and in the air. They have bravely picked up the sword
carried in their time by the great military ﬁgures of the Ameri-
can people and have already shown themselves to be the true
descendants of the deathless heroes of America's struggles for
national liberation and independence. Together with the
brave Filipino youth and people, they have shown at Pearl
Harbor, Wake, Guam, Luzon and Mindanao that they are
indeed the worthy allies of the glorious youth of the Red
Army, of the ﬁghting youth of Britain and China.

The past two months of war have already brought forth
a new galaxy of heroes who will, in the hard days of struggle
yet to come, inspire the whole American youth to new feats
of valor and glory. As we meet here today we think with pride
of Capt. Colin Kelly, who sacriﬁced his life to sink the 29,000-
ton Japanese battleship Haruna to the bottom. We salute
that dauntless Negro messman who sprang to the bridge of
the ﬂeet commander's ship at Pearl Harbor, seized a machine-
gun which a shameful Jim Crow system had never taught him
to use, and blazed away at the oncoming enemy planes. We
salute the heroic exploit of Lt. Bulkeley, torpedo boat com-
mander, whose craft raced into Subic Bay off Luzon amidst
a hail of bullets and shells from shore batteries and sank
the 5,ooo-ton Japanese vessel which was its objective. We sal-

ute the heroism of those six Filipino pilots who, although»

outnumbered more than 4 to 1, dispersed an enemy formation
of 27 Japanese planes, and turned them back from their ob-
jective. We pay our tribute to the hundreds of seamen in our
merchant marine who have lost their lives in the icy waters of
the Atlantic and recall proudly that more than a score of
those who thus gave their lives were Communists, among them
members of the Young Communist League.

Such deeds of valor inspire the millions of American youth
and give us models indeed to emulate. They ﬁll our youth
with the profound conviction that there can be no prouder

19'

   

 

tit1e._tod'a_y..that.that of Soldier, Sailor, Marine, Pilot, Nurse,
in the service of our country and our ﬂag.

 " Today this great title has become the proud possession of
* mill-ions of American youth including large numbers of Young
' Communists as our country swings into action to build up our

ﬁghting forces. According to the plans of the War Depart-

‘ ment, by the’ end of 1942, the Nation will have an army of

three million six hundred thousand men. And by the end
of 1943 an army of seven million men. Truly our generation
will be a generation in arms! ~

The young people of our country greet all steps taken by
our government to expand and strengthen our ﬁghting forces.
They greet the enactment of legislation to extend the age
limits for military service as well as adoption of various meas-
ures for the rc-classiﬁcation of those who, in the past, were

' deferred for one or another reason which should today be re-
-considered. They will enthusiastically cooperate with the War
‘ Department by themselves taking steps wherever possible to re-

habilitate themselves physically and in other ways to help

remove those factors permitting of remedy which now stand

in‘-the way of their being called upon for military service.
Among those who answered their country’s call to the colors

' we are proud ‘to count a number of the outstanding leaders

"of our Young Communist League, including two members of

~" our National Council well known to all of us-Bob Thompson
” and~]ohn -Gates-‘ Together with other leaders of our Young
" Communist League including Fred Fine, Sam Banks, Wilbur
“Broms, Jim Hudson and many others, they now wear the
- khaki in the service of the Stars and Stripes. All of them have

been "given an‘ indeﬁnite leave of absence from all their re-
sponsibilities in our organization. Of those who will soon be

‘called to’ the colors within the next few weeks is our beloved
' ‘National Administrative Secretary, Henry Winston. Similarly
' notiﬁed that‘“they have been called to the colors, -and already
' preparing to leave, are Ruby Cooper, Dave Grant» and Ben

Dobbs. -e
As for the rest of us, we stand at attention, awaiting our
country’s call, prepared to give it our last full measure, of

-devotion: ~ -

20

 

Although it is a matter of regret that Congress did not see
ﬁt to accept the proposals of the Administration, the War
Department and the Selective Service authorities for the in-
clusion of the 19-year-old age groups among those to be called
up for military training and service, there is much that can
still be done to prepare those age groups that have not been
included in the Draft as well as those who have not yet been
called up for more effective participation in the grim battles
that are ahead. ‘This should take form through the estab-
lishment of various systems of universal compulsory pre-mili-
tary training for all youth not yet in the armed forces as well

as through a widespread development of the physical ﬁtness

program. . .

The sum total of all these measures is bringing about the
rapid transformation '-of our whole generation into a genera-
tion-in-arms, a generation that is prepared to ﬁght on every
continent, on every ocean, and in every sky until the fascist
Axis is completely destroyed. ‘ - -

4 Eclucaﬁon for fhe Army,

This vast ﬁghting force is being rapidly and efﬁciently
trained in the military technique of modern, total war. What
is equally important‘ is the factthat the great. lesson which
was drawn as far» back as the time. of Cromwell when he de-
ﬁned a citizen soldier as one who “Knows what he ﬁghts for

and loves what he‘ knows,” is beginning to be appreciated. .
It is in line with Cromwell’s classic deﬁnition of a citizen '

soldier that a great advance has been made in the system of
our army training through the introduction of .a planned
educational program for the soldiers and officers of the 2nd
Army, commanded by General Ben. Lear. This program re-
quires all? ofﬁcers and men of the 2nd Army to attend a series

of 26 lectures over a period of 13 weeks, dealing with ques-

tions of world geography and history, American. history and
the democratic principles and traditionsof our systemof gov-
ernment. There is no doubt whatever that the salutory‘ re-
sultsof this educational program now being’ carried through
in the 2nd "Army commanded’ by General Lea-r will result. in
21

   
 

its extension to every section of the Army, as well as to the
Navy and the Marines. This political education is a necessary
complement to the training of our ﬁghting men in the mili-
tary arts of the war. The Army is to be commended for the

g beginning which has been made in this direction.

Unfortunately this is the exception and not the rule. It
serves only to emphasize the basic conclusion reached by the
Roberts repor-tt—that disaster is the only thing that can result
from any separation between international policy, that is,
politics, and "military policy. 'The..two are and must be in-
separable. Asa matter of fact, the military policy which led
to the disaster at Pearl Harbor was merely the counterpart to
the disastrous Munich policy which dominated the mentality
of the commanding officers at Pearl Harbor. The best guar-
antee against any repetition of similar disasters is the develop-
ment of precisely such a program of education as is now being
carried on in the Second Army and the rapid promotion of
new officers from the ranks, from among those whose minds
are not corrupted by brass hat complacency and Munich
mentality. A .

The building of an invincible armed force requires the full
integration of the Negro youth in all branches of the armed
services without any discrimination. In the past months there
have been certain developments which indicate that the Army
General Staff has begun to grapple with this problem. This
is seen for example, in the disciplinary actions against white
officers at Fort Bragg, following the shameful attack upon
Negro soldiers there. It is seen in the announcement that
there will shortly be‘ formed a complete Negro Division, of-
ﬁcered by Negro soldiers, as well as a 2nd Negro Air Pursuit
Squadron, the 100th, in addition to’ the existing ggth Negro
Air Pursuit Squadron.

At the same time, however, it must be pointed out that the
very formation of this Negro Division and these special Negro
Air Pursuit Squadrons, is based on the assumption that the
whole system of segregation of Negro soldiers from white
soldiers will continue to be a basic policy of the War Dept.
It is this basic policy which must be changed. The Negro
youth of our country must be admitted into all branches of

22

 

 

the armed service on terms of full equality without discrimina-
tion, without segregation, and with the most severe and dras-
tic penalties attached to all instances of Jim Crow violations
of the fundamental rights of Negro youth.

The American people look upon the armed forces with great
pride. They want to do everything possible to demonstrate
their support. And there is much that those outside the
armed forces can do. For example, United Service Organiza-
tion has launched a nation-wide “Victory Book Campaign”
to provide ten million books for the Army. The youth move-
ment must give its full support to this campaign. Our Young
Communist League will surely do its part. Already the New

York District of the YCL has contributed $100 to the U.S.O. _ I

and has undertaken to collect ten thousand books as its con-
tribution to this great campaign. Such activities as the sending
of gifts, packages, letters, sweaters, cigarettes and other useful
articles to the boys in the Army should be carried out not
only by individuals who have brothers, husbands or friends
in the Army. They should become the organized activities
of every youth organization, of every trade union, through
regularly established Service Welfare Committees. Such Serv-
ice Welfare Committees can, in addition, organize periodic
affairs to entertain soldiers on furlough. A particularly valu-
able activity is the organizing of Army-Civilian athletics,
between union teams and army post or training center teams.

2—You+h Serve in fhe Baffle for Production

The masses of -youth in the United States have become the
nation's ‘soldiers in overalls in the battle for production. Mil-
lions of young people, the heroes of labor, are at work today
in the factories, mills, mines and shipyards of our country
turning out the planes, tanks, guns, ships and ordinance
required to destroy the Fascist Axis.

Apart from all other considerations, this mass shifting of
millions of American youth into the basic industries of the
country is an historic phenomenon of the first order. -It
creates an entirely new situation, unprecedented in the his-
-tory of our country for the’ last decade. Not for to years,

23

   
 

since the crash of 1929, have the young people of our coun-
try been so fully drawn into industry as they are today. In
varying degrees throughout that whole period between 1929
and 1940, the youth ot our country was a generation that was
more or less “locked-out” of industry, unable to learn a trade,
unable to work productively, unable t-0 earn a living. Almost

_ overnight, this whole situation has changed. We have today
. a generation. already large_ly employed which will soon be
.almost.entirely absorbed in industry, helping our nation win
. the battle. for production. .

Training for ’rhe Baffle of Producﬁon

One of the most important problems to be solved in wiw
ning the battle for production is the training of this vast
-force of millions of new workers. For some time, now, an
extensive program of job training has been in operation..
Since its inauguration more than a year ago, approximately
21/,» million workers have been trained for the defense in--
dustries. This job training program has been carried out in a:
variety of forms through the Vocational Training Schools
system, through the apprentice training program of the Fed»
eral Committee on Apprentice Training, through the estab-
lishment of systems of up-grading and in-plant training within:
industry, through the functioning of National Youth Adminis-
tration work projects.

Although this training program has accomplished much.
it must be said that in view of the immensity of the task
confronting the nation, it is highly inadequate to meet the
need and sadly lacking in coordination. What is required.
is a tremendous expansion of all the various phases of this»
_job training program to meet the need of training additional;
millions not over a long period of time but immediately-
What is required is a tremendous expansion of all forms of
job training, and at the same time, their close coordination
through one over-all federal agency which can enhance the
total effectiveness of each speciﬁc phase of the job training
P"°gmm-

One of the biggest sources of the new labor supply which
must be trained is among the hundreds of thousands of girls
and young women hitherto kept out of industry. In fact.
the introduction of girls and young women into the basic in-A
dustries is no longer a matter for discussion but an actual ac—-

complishment especially in the aircraft industry of the West

Coast where thousands of girls already work on the assembly
lines and at the work benches. '
This process of drawing girls into industry and training
them must not be left to chance. It should be organized,
especially by the efforts of the trade union movement. A num--
ber of these unions, notably the United Electrical. Radio and’;

I6

 

 

Machine Workers _Union, have already done yoeman work
in this ﬁeld through the organization of special shop con-
ferences to discuss the various phases of production for which
the special capabilities of girls and young women are most

suited and through negotiation with job training oflicials.

for the inclusion of quotas of girls in training courses. These

examples should be followed by every union undertaking to-

work out the methods for training and introducing girls
into industry.

We must continue to emphasize the imperative necessity,
in the interest of national unity, as well as in the interest of
maximum production, for the complete elimination of all Jim
Crow barriers and restrictions which still stand in the way of
training and hiring Negro youth in industry.

The trade unions have a very vital contribution to make
in helping solve this huge problem of job training. In fact,
the Murray Industrial Council Plan offers the best framework
within which the problem of job training can most adequately
and quickly be set on the road to solution. There are indica-
tions that the trade unions are beginning to concern them-
selves with it ‘in a serious fashion. The Rubber Union, for
example, has come to an agreement with the rubber" industry
about methods and forms of job training in that industry.
The Steel Workers Organizing Committee, similarly, has an-
nounced its intention of including a whole series of proposals
for job training in the steel industry in all contracts to be
signed between the union and the steel corporations. Those
unions which do not operate in defense industries can make
a valuable contribution to winning the battle for production
by exploring the possibility for conversion of non-defense
plants to defense purposes, by putting forward plans for the
re-training of its membership in the skills required for such
conversion and in cases where plants are faced with shut-downs
due to priorities, by mobilizing their membership to take de-
fense training courses in order to ﬁt themselves for work in
other industries.

3-'-Youth Serves in Civilian Defense.

"The young people of our country serve the nation no-t only
in .the armed forces and in the battle for production; but also
in the .-many vital functions of Civilian Defense. Hundreds
of thousands of young people, organized and unorganized,
among them. thousands of members of. the Young Communist
League are among the ﬁve million who have enrolled, as
volunteers in the Civilian Defense effort. This direct indi-
vidual enrollment however, tells onlypart of the story. There
are additional hundredslof thousands of young people not
oﬂicially enrolled individually as volunteers whoare never-
theless..extremel;y;=active. in all -phases of civilian defense
through the projects upon which their organizations are .at
work. . .  ’-  i ‘ t .

It. is a fact that is tbeylond anytrquestion that the youth or-
ganizations rof our'cou'n§try'u=havev been aictivized on:various
phases of civilian d-efense’;t-0 an extent never beforerequalled
in the history of our country»-..in,:anvy previous emergency. Youth
organizations~that‘in the past never; departed from the. pre-
scribed routine of activities ﬂowing most directly from their
individual program have now’ abandoned the tradition-‘=of
decades and have subordinated their ‘own individual program
to the task of cooperatingas. a unit in the variouis-‘civilian de-A
fense:projects.- . _  ~ ‘   '* ~ V

 

Together ‘with, and as part of,‘ this great -response‘ of 'all- ’

youth organizations, our Young Communist League"*has made
its own ‘contribution as well to the Civilian Defense eﬁort.
Our members have responded ‘to the call for volunteer workers
in many. civilian defense ‘activities. They are toibe found
among the zmillionswho-have «enrolled as ‘air raid wardens.
They ,ar-e". studying‘ in':Red’ Cross and First Aid classes. ‘In
many citiesrgroups of :our mern%bers"have donated" blood to
theRed».Cross. ..They::arei active in the~sale'o'f Defense Bo-'nd"s
and Stamps; They are taking part in every‘ activitycalled for
by the Civilian Defense Authorities. -'7‘ "  V A

In the past few weeks an important step forward has been
taken toward the full mobilization of the masses of youth and
their organimtions, and the coordination of the work now

28

being done» by these-‘ organizations through the establishment

of the National Youth Division of Civilian Defense., which
has undertaken to coordinate the activitiesofz all youth or-
ganizations through the establishment of Civilian Defense
Youth Auxil.iaries.. V ‘ - - t Y

The formation of these youth auxiliaries will undoubtedly
result in a tremendous expansion. of youth's participation in
civilian defense. As yet, they have been formed in relatively
few areas of the country. ‘One of the considerations which
impedes the rapid materialization of: the plans of the Youth
Division of Civilian Deefnse is a fear which .exists in some
circles that the rapid formation of such auxiliaries might ‘lead
to the inﬁltration into them of certain subversive interests
who are bent on capturing these auxiliaries for‘ their own
Fifth Column aims.

Is there ground for such fear? Yes!.

We have only to read the editorials of Coughlin’s “Social
justice” to see that there is indeed such a concerted effort to
capture positions of leadership» in the civilian defense effort
by subversive interests. In a recent issue of “Social Justice,”
the following directive was issued to the fascist followers of
Father Coughlin: - ‘

“Join up withithe office of Civilian Defense.”
“Capture every oﬂice. Get out and get busy.”

All such attempts of-subversive interests to capture these
youth auxiliaries or other phases of the civilian‘ defense ef-
fort must be exposed and combatted. But the best way to
defeat the plottings of the Coughlinites is not through the
setting of -restraints upon. the freedom and rapidity with which
such Youth Auxiliaries are developed. On. the contrary, the
best guarantee for the nulliﬁcation of any conspiratorial at-
tempts by these Fifth'Column elements is the widest and most
rapid development of the ‘Youth Auxiliaries. —

Call «upon the initiative and the devotion of the youth
organizations; give free play to the desire of v-the'ir’metnber-
ship to serve the country through such Youth Auxiliaries;
build these auxiliaries with the greatest boldness in all cities
and towns—-the great mass of patriotic youth of our country

will see to it that these subversive elements are checked and
foiled in their Fifth Column efforts. .

To accomplish the excellent and necessary aims set for it-
self by the Youth Division of Civilian Defense, it will be
necessary to involve the trade unions very actively in their
work. The appointment of James Carey, Secretary of the
CIO, as one. of the members of the Executive Committee of
the National Advisory Board of the Youth Division of Civilian
Defense is an indication that this is the orientation of the
Civilian Defense authorities. A similar approach must be
adopted in all localities.

Finally, the maximum mobilization of the youth for civilian
defense requires the elimination of all Jim Crow practices
which are unfortunately still prevalent in civilian defense.
Our youth cannot be fully mobilized for this important front
of the struggle unless the Negro youth and their organizatiom
are completely integrated in the whole ‘civilian defense set-up
and its activities.

One of the most important features of the civilian defense

effort is the organization of support to the various campaigns .

for war relief. Of the many suchecampaigns now current,
we would like to single out two which in our opinion de~
serve special emphasis. The ﬁrst is the campaign of the Red
Cross for ﬁfty million dollars. This campaign, already in
full swing, must and undoubtedly will receive the enthusiastic
support of American youth and their organizations. Secondly,
we would like to emphasize the need to mobilize the youth
for support to the campaign for 3 million dollars that has
been launched by Russian War Relief. The heroic struggle of
the Red Army on the Eastern Front and its brilliant vic-
tories have been carried out at the cost of tremendous casual-
ties both for the Red Army and the civilian population in
the Soviet Union. Hence, support to the activity of the Youth
Division of the Russian War Relief which is now engaged in
helping to reach this goal of 3 million dollars should be under-
taken enthusiastically as a major obligation of all young
people. » .

In addition, full support should be given to the campaigns
for British and Chinese War Relief.

4-—|m—prove Youih Welfare to Strengthen You+h's
Abilify to Serve Hie Naﬁon

There are two opposite conclusions which are being
drawn from the fact that a vast change has occurred in the
situation of the youth, from the fact that youth now under-
takes as. its main task service to the nation.

The ﬁrst conclusion was symbolized in the proposal of the
Byrd Economy Committee and the Brookings Institute to
abolish all federal appropriations for NYA, for CCC, for the

distribution of free hot lunches to school children as well as V

for other services to youth. This proposal was advanced on
t-he ground of economy as well as on the specious plea that
there are no longer any special needs of youth since, in their
overwhelming majority, youth are or soon will be absorbed
either in the army or in industry.

Fortunately, this viewpoint was rebuked and rejected in
the report accompanying President Roosevelt's budget pro-
posals. The exact appropriation for the work of these youth
agencies will be submitted in a special request to be made
later. But if we discuss the speciﬁc amounts to be appro-~
priated, we do so by standing on the same common ground
upon which President Roosevelt stands in his approach to
the needs of youth as an integral part of defense needs. We
carry on such a discussion of the President’s budget recom-
mendations with general agreement on fundamental approach.

The same cannot be said of our attitude to the proposals .

of the Byrd Committee and the Brookings Institute. Here
we must register our sharp and unqualiﬁed rejection of the
fundamental policy which underlies those proposals.

This policy is summed up very succinctly by the N. Y.
“Sun" which stated editorially that:

“With hundreds of thousands of young men going into

the Army and Navy and Marines and with innumerable other

thousands at work in armament plants this is not an appro-
priate time for action on what are called “youth problems.”

- Now this editorial conclusion of the N. Y. “Sun,” reflecting
a whole school of thought, is especially noteworthy because

31

   

itlwas written asazcommen-tary_ on the-publication by the
American Youth. Commission of theresults, of its extensive and
fundamental six year study of the problems of youth. We will
on. a diﬁferent occasion .comment in detail on the summarized
ﬁndings of the American Youth Commission.“ . _

,What concerns us at the moment is the fact that the conclu-
sion which the N. Y. “Sun” draws from the. publication of
these ﬁndings is in complete, and utter contradiction to the
conclusion drawn by the American Youth Commission.

For the .American Youth Commission goes out of its way, in
the digest of its ﬁndings, to emphasize a policy toward youth
which stands at an opposite pole from the strange and harm-
ful viewpoint of the N. Y. “Sun.”

In its digest, the American Youth Commission states the
followingzi ’ '

“To the end that all youth may become responsible adults,
trained for democracy, tough in mind and body, the Com-
mission advocates that an integrated’ program of rehabilita-
tion andipreparation be undertaken immediately. Full cogni-
zance ofthe emergency period of‘1‘942 is taken as the Com-
mission names the successful prosecution of the war as ‘the
most-important problem confronting the American people
of today.’ . But it makes a plea that even during-these emer-
gency times there be- adequate provision‘-for a program in
regard. to youth—‘a program based on the experience of the
past, adjusted to the harshrealities ofythe present and ade-
quate to the foreseeable needs, of;the fu,ture’—since youth must
‘be prepared if they in turn a_re_to serve the nation in its time

of need.” 

The Young Communist League agrees wholeheartedly with
this b3.SfiC approach to the problem of youth in thisperiod
of war for defense of our national inde.pe-ndence; 1 ‘ « . ’

Defeat the Enemies of National Unity

lt would be a serious mistake to think that, since national
unity has inlthe main been achieved among the masses, noth-
ing more remains to be done to consolidate, preserve and
strengthen national unity. It is true that the most prominent
former spokesmen of appeasement have been forced, by the
pressure of events, to make public protestations of their
patriotism and their support of the country. But this should
not be allowed to conceal the fact that the menace of this
small handful of Axis Quislings who have no intention of
halting their Fifth Column activities has increased precisely
because our nation is now at war.

The tactics of certain of these Fifth Column elements were
clearly outlined at a recent secret meeting of America First
leaders addressed by Lindbergh. According to the well-known
columnists, Pearson and Allen, Lindbergh made it clear that
-the Pearl Harbor attack had not caused him. to change his
mind about his charge that the President's foreign policy
“would involve us in war.” The ex-colonel councilled his
followers to “keep in the background. T-hat there would be
an opportunity for later renewed activity and criticism of the
America First type.” What is this but the technique ‘of the
time bomb! _

It should be clear from this that the silence of many for-
merly notorious appeasement leaders is merely a veil behind
which a new witches’ broth of Fifth Columnist plotting is
being concocted. In fact, the ugly voice of the Fifth Column
is again beginning to be heard from familiar directions. Be-
hind a pretentious display of patriotism, the N. Y. “Daily
News” and the Hearst press are already aggressively carrying
out the main tactic of Hitler's agents in America, the tactics of
sniping at the coalition which exists between the United
States,’ Britain, the Soviet Union, China and other countries
and peoples ﬁghting Hitler.

Of all the dangerous and pernicious Fifth Column forces

34

 

 

at work to corrupt the youth and to paralyze the war effort,
we must single_ out the degenerate inﬂuence of paciﬁsm for
special consideration at this meeting of our National Com-
mittee.

What meaning can the abstract preachment of peace have
under conditions when our country is engaged in a life and
death struggle with the medieval, barbaric forces of _ Hitler
fascism? '

A few days ago, in his report to the House of Commons.
Churchill revealed that Hess had come to Britain on a mission
of peace,'no less! Hess had come to negotiate a “magnanimous
peace” with the British appeasers. The only price was the
ousting of Churchill. .

And what lay behind this “peace mission” of Hess?

On June 22nd, the world found out.

Under the cover of negotiations for a “magnanimous peace,"
the German fascists were already preparing to carry out that
indescribable act of treachery _and unprovoked war which
shocked the world on the morning of June 22nd.

There is still a second illustration of what such peace talk.
means under conditions of our war with the Axis.

On November 15, Mr. Kurusu, special envoy from Japan.
arrived in Washington on a “peace mission.”

And that lay behind this “peace mission” of Mr. Kurusu?

On December 7th, at Pearl Harbor, the “day that will live
in infamy,” the world found out.

Under cover of negotiations for “peace,” the Japanese fas~

'cists. were already carrying out those naval and military dispo-

sitions which had to be prepared at least two weeks in. advance-
in order to carry out the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

June 22nd and December 7th are the days that must forever-
be consecrated to the memory of this fascist tactic of ‘preparing
for attack under cover of “negotiating peace.”

And still such tools of Hitler as Mr. Libby of the National’
Peace Conference, the leaders of the Methodist Youth Fellow-.
ship, certain leaders of the Student Christian Movement, the
Norman Thomas controlled Youth Committee for Democracy,
continue to ‘demand a “negotiated peace.”

So long as Hitler and the Mikado can ‘be assured that these

35

Fifth Columnist ambassadors of the Axis will engage the
American, people in. discussions about a “negotiated peace,”
they will not miss the restrictions that have been placed on the
travels of Hess and Kurusu. V

The paciﬁsts exhort the members of their organizations to
wash their hands of _ the war, to forget the war effort, and to
concentrate on what is called a study -of the peace that is to
follow the war.

Imagine the hypocrisy of this paciﬁst crew! They will have
nothing to do with the ‘war, they refuse to support the war,
_.but ,the__y. propose to discuss thevpeace, that is to follow the war.
» Regardless ofwho. wins the war, you ,understand—whether

The Young Communist League ond National. Unity

In these momentous and critical days, our Young Commu-
nist League has played an important role in helping mobilize
the masses of youth for service to the nation.

If we have been able to do this, it has been because we have
been guided in our work and in all our policies by the scien-
tiﬁc, tested theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin and by
the teachings of the foremost exponent of Marxism-Leninism
in the United States, Earl Browder. It is especially as a result
of the great contributions of Earl Browder that we have
learned to appreciate and understand the great lessons of those
American traditions which we emphasize again in celebrating
the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln during the month
of February.

If we have been able to fulﬁll our role in this great period
of world history, it has been because of the leadership of our
Communist Party and its National Committee headed by
comrades Foster and Browder; because of the leadership of
such comrades as Robert Minor, James W. Ford, Roy Hudson
and Gil Green.

The wheels of history are moving in that direction which
makes it inevitable that the great masses of youth begin to
see more clearly than ever before the exact role which our
organization plays as part-of them, working side by side with

‘ them to help win the war.

They are beginning to see this more clearly than ever be-
cause clarity about the role of the Communists among the
masses has become a‘ question which is intimately bound up
with the establishment of full and complete national unity.
The very struggle for national unity and against those who
try to obstruct national unity is that same process which is
enlightening our country about the constructive role of the
Communists among the people.

I would like to discuss this for a few moments in_ the light
of a very recent attempt by the notorious Dies Committee to
reverse this unexorable process.

38

 

A few weeks ago, the Dies Committee, alleging that Joseph
P. Lash, prominent youth leader, had had connections with
Communism, arrogantly demanded that Mr. Lashfs request for
a commission in the United States Navy be denied and that he
be dismissed from the post to which he had been appointed as
one of the members of the Advisory Board of the Youth
Division of Civilian Defense.

Of course, it is well known that Mr. Lash is not a Com-
munist. In fact, we Communists have been sharply critical of
the policies put forward by Lash on many occasions. Nor do
we have any basis for venturing an opinion as to the qualiﬁ-
cation which Lash may have which would entitle him to a
commission in the Navy or to the post to which he was
appointed on the Youth Advisory Board of Civilian Defense.
But that is beside the point since the issue involved is not
whether Lash has the necessary qualiﬁcations. The only
thing that is at issue is whether a loyal American citizen who
supports the war against the Axis has a right to receive a
commission in the armed forces or a post in an agency of the
Federal government regardless of his political views.

If the Dies Committee can prevent Lash from receiving a
commission in the Navy; if it can force his removal from the
Youth Advisory Boardof Civilian Defense, then a precedent
will have been set which strikes a heavy blow at the national
unity of our country. For what the Dies Committee is at-
tempting to do with Lash, it will attempt to do with others
who are more important than Lash to the war effort of our
country. In fact, the members of the Dies Committee have
already threatened to expand the attack upon Lash into an
attack upon Mrs. Roosevelt. This threat indicates the real
objective of the Dies Committee-—not Lash, or individuals
like Lash, but bigger game, Mrs. Roosevelt, other key ﬁgures
in the administration of the war effort, the war effort itself.

The silence of the Dies Committee on Lindbergh’s request
for a commission in the Army Air Corps in face of the univer-
sal storm of condemnation which poured from the voice of
an aroused nation at this effort of America’s number one
Copperhead to worm his way into the armed forces contrasts
very signiﬁcantly with its sudden activity on the Lash. case.

The complete silence of the Dies Committee ‘following the
ill-advised agreement of the War Department to.allowt the
Copperhead Lindbergh to engage in technical research for a
government bureau contrasts very signiﬁcantly with its furore
at Lash’s appointment to the Youth Advisory Board of Civilian
Defense. It reveals the Fifth Column nature of the Dies Com-
mittee—complacency, silence, acquiescence in the efforts of
known Copperheads and Fifth«Columnists to carry on their
a-ctivities, but red—baiting and witch-hunting against loyal
Americans in order to confuse and divide the country.

It should be noted, at the same time, that Lashskowtowing
to'the‘Dies Committee has not succeeded in saving him from
the persecution of the Dies Committee. His efforts to disprove
allegations of Communist sympathy did not have the effect
that they were intended to have—“‘the soft answer which turn-
eth away the wrath.” On the -contrary’, they strengthened by
implication the validity of this treacherous Fifth‘ Column de-
vice of red-baiting. - ‘ "  t V

Communsts. As far as the Young Communist League is con-
cerned, we are proud of our consistent record of service in the
national interests of our country. Our whole history and ac-
tivity is one of such-consistent defense ‘of theibest national
interests ofour country. We fought for aidwto China when
the great mass of youth did not yet have the realization they
have today‘ of China’s great significance for the defense of
A1nerica’s national interests. We mobilized the youth to ﬁght
German fascism when important circles within our country,
including the government itself, were disastrously dreaming
the dreams of. Munich. We fought for collective security when
our country was still hog-tied by the vociferous tactics of a
minority of isolationists. Our members fought in Spain
against Hitler at a time when Hitler could have been stopped
without the world carnage" that must now accompany his de-
struction.» When -our country was shamefully blockadi-rig Re-
publican Spain, Dave Doran, a leader of the Young‘ Commu-
nist League,'was giving his life on Spanish soil in a cause that
was America’s- cause. We fought for collaborationrbetween the
United States and the Soviet Union at every turn in world
history because we knew that suchiicollaborataion was essen-
tial to America’s national security. That knowledge is no
longer ours ‘alone. The overwhelming majority of American
youth knows it now. Our members are today loyally serving
our country in every phase of the war effort. ‘-
Our young Communist League holds its head high; its ban-
ner is a proud one. one that has always inspired American
youth to true. devotion to our country’s real interests. '
The time.has come when the following ‘answer must be
given the red-baitersz‘ t - — ' W '
“Yes! We: know that these people are Communists.- What
about it? They have proven their right to citizenship in that
great concentrationlof all the ‘patriotic forces of the ‘American

are of us and-with-us. We need them to help win thewarl”

Free Earl Browder

And in a voice that is gathering, and must gather volume, it
. is being said by increasing masses of people about that great

Communist leader, that great American, Earl Browder.

Already 1,200 trade unions and their leaders, youth organ~
izations and youth leaders, hundreds of thousands of people
through resolutions, petitions, telegrams and letters have de—
manded the freedom of Earl Browder. These people and their
organizations know that Earl Browder is the great leader of
the Communist Party of the United States. They know it and
that knowledge does not deter them from demanding the
release of Browder. . '

Let millions more know it and that knowledge not only
will not deter them; it will stimulate them to demand that
Browder be released. For Browder is needed at his post of
struggle in this great crisis of our nation. Browder must be
released not only because his conviction was unjust, not only
because his sentence was excessive, but because he is needed in
the interests of helping win the war. -

How can our nation afford to keep this man in jail?

Is political foresight at so small a premium that we can
keep a man in jail who pointed to the road that America
must travel for its own salvation long before our country
ﬁnally took that road? _

Is America, arms in hand, ﬁghting for its life today? Brow-
der warned our country that the Axis would attack.

Is Munich pronounced today‘ with execration and loath-
ing? Browder’s voice was the ﬁrst to be raised against it in
bitter denunciation of its meaning for American security. Is
our country an ally of the great Soviet Union whose defense is
now seen as a matter of America's own defense? It was
Browder who fought -tirelessly to win the American people for
such collaboration.

Everything that has happened within the memory of recent.
times conﬁrms the brilliant judgments of Earl Browder, the
true ﬁghter for the national interests and security of the
United States. .

i That is why our Young Communist League, fully conscious

42

 

of its great responsibilities to the country in helping to win the
war is determined to rally the great masses of young people in
support of this great campaign for Browder’s release.

We will not deny what is known to all--that Earl Browder
is near and dear to us. We will not deny that Browder has a
special meaning for us. How could we when everything that
our Young Communist League is today is a result of Brow»-
der’s great leadership, of his great concern for the young

"people of our country? Yes, we in the Young Communist

League do indeed have a special regard for Earl Browder.
And yet we say, in full truthfulness and in that great sin-

cerity which marks our every utterance, that we call for

Browder’s release not out of any narrow, selﬁsh or partisan
interests. We call for Browder’s release as an act which is
dictated by the interests of fully mobilizing every resource at
the command of our nation to help win the war. And it is in

‘this spirit which also lies at the basis of all our work that we

pledge at this meeting of our National Committee to put every
energy behind the great campaign that is now under way to
secure the release of Earl Browder.

Comrades, in a few short month—in April-our Young
Communist League will observe its twentieth anniversary. We
will celebrate that twentieth anniversary by bringing to still
further fruition everything we have been trained to be in
these two decades—brave and loyal ﬁghters for our people and
our country, ﬂinching at no sacriﬁce, daunted by no obstacle,
yielding every last measure of devotion to the great’ task of
defending our country, of winning the war, to preserve our
country's right to exist as a free nation.

WORLD UNITY AGAINST THE AXIS

The National Council of our Young Communist League
meets at a time when our country is fully and completely en-
gaged in a- great war against the Axis powers to defend its
right to exist as a free nation. The United States ﬁghts as part
of a world coalition of United Nations side by side with Great
Britain, the Soviet Union, China and twenty-two other na-
tions. Every continent and all the oceans as well as the very
skies which girdle the earth are the theatres of war in this
fateful struggle.

The ‘life and the future of the young people of our country
is at stakeyin this great war. ‘Realizing this, «the youth of our
country has thrown itself into the battle with unbounded en-
thusiasm and selfless heroism. At the front, and behind the
front, the young men and young women of our country are
giving, without stint, their energies and their lifeblood to the
great cause of defending our national independence and free-
domvagainst the aggression of the Axis barbarians.

Our Young Communist League which has always been moti-
vated by the great patriotic ideal of defending our country
andgprotecting its national interests stands inthe front ranks

together with ‘millions of other young Americans in this‘

grave and crucial’ period. Our long and continuous devotion
to our na._tion’s interests through all the years and changing
conditions which have led to this great trial by arms have
.équipped»us with those very qualities“ that are so sorely needed
today to help us make an effective 'cor1f_tribution‘t.,’owi_nr,1i.n"g
the war. ' '" i _

. .There is one all-important and decisive fact, about this ti-
tanic. conﬂict whose signiﬁcance and full implication _must
be thoroughly grasped. by the young people of our country.
This; war, with all its far-flung battlefronts, is one, war, single

V

as

  

and indivisible. A profound understanding of this fact is
indispensable for the correct development of the only policy
that can win victory, the policy of world coalition of the
United States, Great Britain, the Soviet -Union, China and
all other nations ﬁghting the Axis. A

Therein lies the great signiﬁcance of the Pact of the United
Nations in which the people of twenty-six countries pledge
their blood and treasure for the common cause. This Pact is

the formal expression of a policy of world coalition against the-

Axis. It marks the acceptance by all the United Nations of
the proposition that what is being fought out all the way from
the sub-zero front west of Moscow through the parched sands
of the Libyan desert and the steaming jungles of the Malay
Peninsula to the hills behind Manila is one war, single and
indivisible. It opens the way for further advancement to the
establishment of a full economic, political and military alli-
ance between our country, Great Britain, the Soviet Union
and China. With this development, an end has been put to
a whole era in which the opposite policy prevailed, the policy
of Hitler, the policy of one-by-one war, the policy of divide‘
and rule.

The culmination of this Axis policy of one-by-one war, as
well as its ﬁrst great political defeat, came with the unpro-
voked and treacherous attack upon the Soviet Union on
June 22nd. Placing his relian-ce in theecontinued potency of
the “anti-Communist” formula, Hitler hoped to bring about
an undisturbed concentration of his military strength against
the Soviet Union under cover of a “holy crusade against Com-
munism.” He hoped with the aid of his satellite powers, and
to the applause of his British and American dupes, to‘ con-
quer the Soviet Union. With the tremendous resources of the
Soviet Union at his disposal he hoped then to turn separately"
and at his own sweet leisure upon Britain and the United
States. One by one he hoped to march from conquest to con-

uest.
(1 But the exact opposite resulted. The defense of the Soviet
Union was taken up as a necessary element in the defense
of our own national interests. A powerful coalition of the
United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China and

6

 

 

all other nations ﬁghting the Axis came into existence. Hit-
ler’s plan for a one-by-one war against the Soviet Union,
Britain, and the United States was answered by the gathering
of all these forces for the prosecution of one war, single and
indivisible, against Hitler.

The young people of our country, in their overwhelming,
majority rallied in support of this absolutely correct policy of
our nation. The National Council of our Young Communist
League pointed out to the youth of America that this attack
upon the Soviet Union enormously increased the mili_tary
menace of Axis attack upon the United States. It called upon
the youth of our country to participate in that great con-
centration and national unity of all the patriotic forces of
America which was required to defend our national interests.

Japan's Treacherous Attack

On December ,7th, the Axis—speaking through Japanese
cannon and dive-bombers——struck its dastardly blow at Pearl
Harbor.

What was the meaning of the treacherous attack upon Pearl
Harbor followed by the German and Italian declaration of
war? Did they signify that the Axis powers had abandoned
their policy of one-by-one war, their policy of divide and rule?

Not at all! Pearl Harbor signiﬁed that Hitler had found
it expedient to continue his policy of one-by-one war under
new conditions, under conditions in which a powerful world
coalition of anti-Axis nations had actually come into exist-
ence and was functioning despite everything that had been
done to prevent its formation.

Previously, the Axis depended for the success of its one-
by-one war policy on its ability to prevent the formation of a
world coalition against it. A

Under these new conditions, with such a coalition already
formed, the Axis can depend for the success of its one-by-
one war policy only on its ability to divide the forces of this
existing coalition, to disperse its strength, to divert it from
the main enemy—Hitler Germany.

This is the signiﬁcance of the Japanese attack in the Paciﬁc.

7

I
l

  

Hitler hoped that,. as a result of the Japanese offensive in the
Paciﬁc, the United States would be tempted to divert all its
strength away from. -the Eastern front, the main front of
struggle against Hitler Germany; away from the policy of in-
creased aid to Britain. Hitler hoped that the United States
would turn all its strength into the single channel of ﬁghting
the war in the Paciﬁc and the Far East. Had this Hitler
strategy met with success, then despite the formal existence of
a worldcoalition against it, the Axis would have achieved
its main aim—the cancelling out of the practical effect of a
war of coalition against it.

The friends of Hitler in the United States rushed to adapt
themselves to this new phase. of Axis policy. In the ﬁrst few
daysafter Pearl Harbor, with the most remarkable unanimity,
they attempted to blind the American people to the fact that it
was Hitler, and not Japan alone, that had spoken through
Japanese guns at Pearl Harbor. They attempted to separate
the warlin the Paciﬁc from the war against Hitler.

The most classic expression of this Fifth Column attitude
was the announcement by Norman Thomas of his great relief
at" hearing President Roosevelt ask for a declaration of war
only against Japan and not against Germany and Italy. Nor-
man Thomas, his handfuliof followers among the youth, and
all other friends of Hitler have since then, and on the basis of
every new‘ development following the declaration of a state
of war between the United States and the rest of the Axis,
continued to adapt themselves to- the -requirements of Axis
policy—~to'work' for a-division of the forces of the anti-Axis
coalition’, for the dispersal of its strength, for the diversion
of its heaviest striking power away from the main common
enemy——H'it1er fascism. * --

' Hifler Fascism fhe Main Enemy

But this new‘ ‘phase of Hitler's policy has not swerved our
country from the tenacious pursuit of its. ﬁxed course, that
absolutely‘ true course which is set forth-e destruction of, Hitler
fascism as the main enemy.‘ In all the statements of policy
made by ‘President Roosevelt and other-spokesmen of the: Ad-

8.

 

 

ministration it has been made clear that our country regards
German fascism as the head, the heart and the nerve center of
that world serpent that goes by the name Axis. It is against
German fascism-that the main blows must be concentrated and
struck. . _

The arrival of the ﬁrst contingent of an American Ex-
peditionary Force in Northern Ireland dramatizes the fact
that our country has not been shunted from its main objective
by Hitler’s new strategy. That AEF in Northern Ireland must
be the forerunner of a mighty American Army which together
with the British Army must strike at Hitler from, the west in
order. to crush him between the hammer and anvil, of a two
front war on the continent of Europe. _  ~ ,

Instead of diverting the flow of American arms away from
the Eastern _front, away from the battle of the Atlantic, away
from the battle for Africa in order to meet the. attack in the
Paciﬁc, President Roosevelt announced to the world__that our
country would “raise its sights’_" by setting itself new objec-
tives. in the battle of production. We must now increase
the turnout of arms to such a point that they will flow to all
fronts in a constantly increasing torrent until the Axis powers
are inevitably crushed beneath the weight of an overwhelm~
ing superiority of the combined machines and men of war
at the common disposal of the United Nations. :-

iNothing could be more dangerous than any tendency -to
pose one front against another. The main" enemynis Hitler
Germany; we must never lose sight of that fact for a single
moment. But there can be no groundfor any complacency
over the fact that the Red Army is winning new brilliant
victories against the main enemy on the Eastern front when,
at? the same time, the United Nations are receiving serious
setbacksin the Far East at the hands of the Japanese fascists,
even though these setbacks are initial and bound to be tem-
porary. - = ;,
" For this reason, while keeping ﬁrmly inmind that the .main
enemy is“ Hitler Germany, the United Nations mustuengage
in all-out relentless war ‘against Japan as well, ﬁghting the
Axis on every front. There is not, and there cannot be,

any contradiction between recognizing that Hitleris. the main -
