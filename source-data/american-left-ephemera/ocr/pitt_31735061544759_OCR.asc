NUCLEAR TESTING

Statement by SPU National Steering Committee

On August 30, 1961, the Soviet Union announced to the world its intention to
resume nuclear testing, and (n1 September 2, 1961, held its first test. A
bare week after the original Soviet announcement, on September 5, 1961, the
United States followed suit by announcing its intention to resume testing,
and on September 15, 1961, held its first test. The three-year period (be-
ginning August 22, 1958) during which neither the USSR nor the US has tested
nuclear weapons is at an end.

In its announcement, the USSR attempted to excuse its resumption of testing
by saying tuat "It is an open secret that the US is standing on the thresh-
old of carrying out underground nuclear testsJ'While it is true that there
has been growing pressure uponanuiwithin the US government for test resump-
tion, it is also 2: plain and unmistakable fact that it is the Soviet Union
which first resumed testing and which joined to this resumption boasts of a
100-megaton hydrogen bomb, the most powerful nuclear weapon ever developed.
For this announcement and subsequent tests there can be neither justifica-
tion nor apology, and the Student Peace Union unequivocally condemns the
Soviet Union for its act.

The US, likewise, attempted to excuse itself--by claiming that "we have no
other choice in fulfillment of the responsibilities of the U.S. government
to its own citizens and to the security of other free nations." However, it
is not at all clear, from President Kennedy's own statement only a few days
before that the US stockpile of atomic weapons was "wholly adequate for the
defense needs of the U.S. and the free world" and from conflicting evalua-
tions by' scientific experts, that the US "had no other choice". Thus, the
US has lost an opportunity to relieve world tensions by continuing its part
of the moratorium on tasting, and has chosen instead to increase tensions
by resuming testing. For this the Student Peace Union condemns the United
States no less unequivocally than we do the USSR.

The Soviet and US actions present four serious thrusts against peace:

1. They are both unilateral initiatives towards war, and of’ the most
serious proportions. We must not forget that the cessation of tests is the
onlyareazhithearms race where an actual major step towards peace was made,
and that in the critical nuclear weapons section. To resume testing is to
destroy that positive step and its effect.

2. They have already served and will continue to serve as justifica-
tions for each country's continued military buildup and war preparation--
e.g., the US expanded missile and civil defense programs, or the SU's 100-
megaton bomb.

3. The resumption, coming as it does in the context of the Berlin cri-
sis, causes a further heightening of tension in that already highly danger-
ous situation.

4. The damages produced by fallout from further testing, already docu-
mented lnr physicists and geneticists of unimpeachable reputation, will in-
crease sharply. (While the IRS has thusfar limited itself‘ to underground
tests, it 1S clear thatiizwill not be long before the US will resume atmos-
pheric tests.)

We must not forget that these developments occur in the context of the arms
race, for‘ which both power ‘blocs bear responsibility. The action on the
part of‘ the Soviet Union was not. a unique development--nor was the US re-
sponse--but both are the latest in a long series of acts by the two countries
which demonstrate that the primary interest of the two power blocs is in
strengthening euui increasing their military influence irrespective of‘ the
welfare of the majority of the world's people.

We call upon all those who agree with the above to join with us in protest-
ing the resumption of tests. We reiterate our stand for unilateral initia-
tives towards eace; and in this contextvuacall on both governments to cease
nuclear testing, and then to take further steps to decrease world tensions.
