Brothers and Sisters of the Movement,

SDS now faces a time of incredible importance in American history. This summer will bring the issues
around which we have been working to crisis proportions--the war, the draft, and racism. As SDS
people continue to confront these issues in a fashion which shows clearly that our aim -is real change in
America, the National Office is feeling the pressure to respond to the needs of the movement. We feel
the need and potential to fulfill needs more than ever before, but at the same time we are threatened
by a disaster the proportions of which the N.O. has never had to face in the past. What's happening?

*For the first time in several years, SDS is building a summer program to put people to work in
their communities fighting the draft, the war, and racism. We are receiving reports daily .from
SDSers around the country who are preparing for an influx of people this summer. A commun-
ications network must be built; there is a tremendous need for new literature and materials for
them to use in their organizing; training sessions will be necessary. We have the will to
respond to the need, but little money.

*The order has finally gone in for the new press; it should arrive in the office within a month.

It has a tremendous capacity to do high -quality work, but it will need paper and supplies.

*As the summer approaches, and pressures increase in Chicago, we will need some security
measures for the office to keep the uptight cops out. We also need such minor bureaucratic

aids as desks, chairs, files, shelves, and office machinery. 

*Finally, we face the Internal Revenue Service--Washington. has made a serious move against
us. The damage which the government can inflict upon the N.O. is total destruction. Up until
now we have not been able to give a realistic estimate of how much will be needed--our
accountants now estimate that the total damage will be approximately $10, 000. If we do not have
the money when payment is demanded, they can close the office and confiscate any equipment
as payment of taxes. If we do not have that money, the N.O. is finished, done, closed, over.
Those are the dimensions of the problem, and the solution rests with you. We need the help,
there are no alternatives. 6

l The McCarthy and Kennedy candidacies have rechanneled a large amount of financial support, we

suspect. Those of us who have been giving our efforts to radical work for many years find ourselves in a
financial bind. The liberals are forsaking us, and our only reliable source of support in building a

grassroots movement for radical social change in America is you.

     

We see the possibility of fulfilling the tremendous needs of an expanding movement. But the bill
collectors and the IRS are hammering at our door and we are deep in debt. The N.O. staff has operated
on half salary since December ($15 per week——before we got $20). The office is always willing to -
‘operate on the margin of financial stability as long as the work can continue. But checks cannot be
written on hard work or good intentions--we need your financial support if we are to continue to move

ahead. Please send us some money.
Yours in struggle, 
ational Secretary
