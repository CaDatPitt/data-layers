CONDA, Idaho-4It took the threat ‘

of strikelaction to do it, but Conda

Phosphate Miners, Local 6-22,.has final- '

‘ly na'rrow'ed'»the wage gap between its

,members and Mine-Mill workers at 

other Anaconda properties.
The phosphate _-mine here is “a prop-
erty of Ana_conda’s Fertilizer Division,‘

and the workersphavecfor yearshad a '
wage scale lower than that paid copper"
" miners in the big Anaconda chain. This
year they were determined to make a A

change.
When.Mine-Mill made -its settlement

\ i

with Anaconda on a package approxi- I

mating 10 cents an hour early this fall,

the Conda_ members took a secret’ ref-v
erendum‘ vote on whether to accept it.‘

The ’ negotiating committee, including

Local 622 president Grant Wallantine, '

vice president ‘William /Barger, Roy
Findlay, Ev Gunnell and _Int’1Arep.
Ernest Salvas,, recommended that they
vote “no,” and they did.  ' A

This meant that negotiations with
Anaconda’ here had to be resumed
around the big issue of “narrowing the

"»gap.” When the bargaining talks be-_

came deadlocked; 9. secret strike vote
»was taken, which carried overwhelm-
ingly. A

By this time, the company began to

realize that the workers meant busi-
ness. With International President John
Clark taking part in the final negotia-

tions, an agreement_ was concluded to

provide for an- additional 25 cents" per
shift. ,

‘The new Condaiagreement calls for a ;

general wage increase of 89 _,_cents a

day, 3 weeks vacation after 15 years, '

an added, company contribution of .50
cents a month toward the group in-
surance program, elimination of strings
,tied to holiday pay, and improvements

for contract miners and pay office _

schedules. . .
Solidly supporting the fight of the

Conda miners to narrow the wage gap-

were the big Mine-/Mill locals in Butte,
Anaconda and Great Falls, Montana,
all of which sent repeated messages of
encouragement during the long fight.

SAVANNAH

Fertilizer contracts

best in union history

SAVANNAH, Ga.—Settlements in
the fertilizer plants represented by
Mine-Mill Local 870 in Savannahwere
the highest in the history of the union
here. The average increase in- wages
was between 9 and 10- cents an hour,
with most settlements calling for 8

cents across the board to all employees,

plus ‘an additionalpaid holiday. .
The workers at the Southern States

A Fertilizer plant received an’8% in-

crease with an, 8 cent minimum in-
crease and the extra paid holiday in a
settlement which ended a two and a
half week strike and which set the pat-
tern in the area. :Southern States work-
ers also won an important concession
with respect to’ the collection of dues.

BARGAINING Rounoule

ELLIOT DEMAREE, president of‘

Local ‘870, attributed the success of
fertilizer negotiations this year. to or-
ganization of the Fertilizer and Phos-

Vphate Council in District 5 about a

year ago. This Council has done much
to coordinate negotiations -by lMine-Mill
in fertilizer and phosphate operations,
especially in the past few months.
Other recent settlementsin Savan-
nah include new agreements with the
Pierpont and the Rathborne, Ridgeway
and Hare Companies’ for 3 cents an
hour increase, an additional‘ paid holi-
day and other contract improvements.

Both companies are in the very low.’

paid\competitive business of .making
box crates and, since Mi-ne-Mill organ-
ized these‘ workers, their rates have
been raised higher than any compar-
able plants in the South.

MT. PLEASANT
583’ wins reinstatement

.. MT. PLEASANT, Tenn.-—-Mine-Mill '

Local 583 has chalked up an important
arbitration victory at Victor Chemical
Workers, which’sho’Ws what it means
to belong to __a fighting ‘union. 
_The story goes back to last July,
when the company laid off Olie Odum,
a member of the union, and kept '9.
non-union worker with less .seniority—-

" Howard Roberts. The ‘union ‘promptly

filed a grievance, demanding that

'5

Odum be put back to work and be paid ‘

for alllost time. . . 6
When the company regused, theunion
took the caseto arbitration. The arbi-

trator late in September ruled that,
. Odum should get his job back, and

that he should get back pay for the
difference between his regular wages

. on the joband whatever he had earned

on other jobs while waiting for the

case to be settled} V ‘
Brother. Odum went back to work

October 1. Now the company has final-

A ly come _through with his back pay

check, amounting to $273.96. The com-
pany tried to keep Roberts on the job
«even after the arbitration award was

. made,«but.the ‘union kept on fighting.

company speedup plan
ANSONIA, Conn.-——Members ‘of An-- S
sonia Brass Workers, Local 445, are
always on the alert against any at-
tempt by American Brass Company to ~- 
install speedup practices.
Early this month, 300 of them moved
into action when the company ordered I ‘
. a complicated system of production
records to be filled out by'production
and maintenance workers. D. James'—
Supp, unit chairman at‘ the ABC wire
mill and chief steward, refused to make‘;
out the records. ‘

When the" companyfired Supp for

_ his refusal and insisted on going ahead  g "

with their newsystem, the 300 wire" = — '
mill. workers spontaneously walked off 
Itheir jobs in protest. On the same a_ft- 

ernoon of the walkout, the "company,  j,- 

— met with union",representatives.

The: union committee, headed   

MichaelGazy, Local ‘445 president, and . it 0'

‘ including regional director Irving Dich-l

ter and rInt’1 rep.’ Henry S.,Rapuano‘,;-

made two, important points. They said»:  l is

First, -the company committed 
unfair labor practice by‘ discriminatiiffg '
against a local union representative.

» And, second, that the making out of

production records is not a proper part

of the work pf employees in the Mine- ’ 

Mill unit, but‘ is clerical work that be?- _V
longs to the UAW clerical. unit. ' 0*

The company finally conceded to,i:he:r .‘ 

union demands as a basis for resump-
tion of work. The demands called for

VANCOUVER, B.‘ C. -— Charlie
Millard, Canadian director of Steel,
organizer and from-the-rear leader
of the raid on Trail and other Cana-
dian locals of Mine-Mill, had a hot

-time when he came to Vancouver
early in November. ‘

He received lots of publicity in
the commercial press when he

, spoke before a “school" of Canadian
Congress of Labor pie-carders who
were being taught how to vote, but
the papers had not a word to say
when he addressed the Vancouver

’ Area Council of Steel, composed of
some 20 delegates from as "many
shops and 12 locals. .

In fact, -Millard sweated, harder
than he has since he was a marker

l- on‘ the Toronto‘ Stock Exchange in
‘the booming twenties. V V
“We're taking «over allx metal in

Canada,” "he told . the ‘delegates,

federal charters which can't be serv-
iced, and are always asking us ‘for
help. We’re’taking them over!”

HE DENIED any thrust for“pow-

he outlined S_teel’s formula on

“No more wage increases across

Napoleon, “from now on, job evalu-
ation’s the thing!”

He didn’t explain more fully, but
the delegates stiffened. Somehow.
the boys had come to associate job
evaluation with the boss. .

signed to swing the two biggest
Vancouver locals, each 400 strong,
behind the machine in the forthcom-

were asked on these elections as well“
as on his raiding record.

, Asked if candidates opposing the

present incumbents in office would

be afforded the same publicity fa-

Millard almost exploded. C

to decertify four international unions.

.election to give the’ workers an oppor-

‘votes representing those cast. for —D‘is- ’

tunity to vote by secret ballot for their
bargaining agent. .

In the main production unit at Du-
val,‘with 113 voting outof an eligible
116, the election resulted in a 56 to 56
tie between Mine-Mill Local_415 and
the “no”"~vote, one vote being chal-
lenged. The NLRB has yet to hand
down its decision on the validity of the
challenged ballot which is believed to

_be a Mine-Mill vote.

However, it is common knowledge
in the Duval election that of the 56
“no” votes against Mine-Mill, some
were cast by supporters of the IAM
which was not on this ‘ballot, some
were for District 50, some for an in-
dependent union',an_d some for no
union at all. Consequently, even as it
now stands,-the vote demonstrates that

l- Mine-Mill Local 415 is gclearly the

single strongest union at Duval, and
the workers there immediately after
the election _quickly launched an en-
thusiastic drive to put Mine-Mill across

‘as the bargaining agent -in any further

determination of representation rights.

IN A SEPARATE maintenance u_nit
election also at Duval for which the

IAM petitioned, Mine-Mill Local 415

received 17 votes out of atotal of..\39
cast. The~IAM received 11 votes and
“neither” 11. Here, while Mine-Mill re-
ceived more votes than either the IAM
or District 50 “neither” votes, it was
not a decisive majority ormore than

50 per cent of the total votes cast. .
Consequently, a 1“ -run election is ex-'
”pected to be ordered by the NLRB.

Even at United "States Potash Com-
pany, in the fourth major election
where_ four separate groups of votes

were combined against Mine-Mill, not‘

a sin-gle one of the raiders challenging
Mine-Mill’s overall bargaining rights
in the main production unit could count
anything but-defeat in the vote. J

7 In the election at USPC, Mine-Mill
Local 415 was opposed by a line-up
consisting of the IAM, District 50, the

independent company union, and votes,

against any union at all. Not being on

the ballot, both ‘District 50 and the in- ,1
dependent union campaigned for ac

“neither” vote along with the element
that wanted no union at all. The IAM,

‘_ ‘being on the ballot, campaigned for it-
» .-self and against Mine-Mill.

‘Of the 355 votes cast out of a total
‘of 415. eligible at USPC, 153 straight

.union votes (43 per centvof the total)
for Mine-Mill were outnumbered “by:

the combined total of 1851 ‘‘neither’.’

trict 50, the independent union and no
union at all. ‘The IAM received _11
votes. With both District 50 ‘and’ the
independent union each claiming that

‘ , the “neither? vote was cast forthem
/as well as for no union, _neither of

these two raiding organizations can
actually claim having by itself received
anywhere near the 153 solid and un-

Ndisputed votes definitely recorded for
. Mine-Mill Local 415 on the NLRB bal-

“three-way combination of

‘and maintenance helpers for whichv

 

5 lot‘. 4

THEREFORE, regardless of the

votes, Mine-Mill Local 415 canstill,

.3 “and does, claim to be the single strong-

‘ I

est union at U- S. Potash and is pre-
pared to prove majority representation

overany other union at mine iniany ~

manner, shape or’ form that may be
necessary. . 

In other words, having relceivediby

far the greatest number of votes cast

for any union on or off the ballot,
Mine-Mill Local 415 remains unde-
feated as the choice of bargaining
agent for the largest single block .of
workers at USPC and intends‘ to be
first in the claim for bargaining rights
there. ' ' '

In other small craft unit elections
involving a, total of some 48 welders

the IAM and AFL oilermakers peti-

tioned separately, one unit election

among 25 mechanic helpers at USPC
is still in doubt since thpre was no
clear majority of votesfor either the
IAM or Mine-Mill; two separate craft
helper units totalling 8 men went IAM;

and 14 welders at IMCC split them- '

selves off into isolation with the AFL
Boilermakers which has no bargaining

rights for any other workers in the

potash mines here. '

tract under the IAM had signed suffi-
cient cards to petition for aiseparate
election to return to Mine-Mill, but
voted in the election to stay in the
IAM.

TAKEN ALTOGETHER and includ-
ing all the separate craft unit elec-
tions as well as all the votes cast for
District 50, the independent union and
no union at all in the “no” and
“neither” choice, plus the votes for the
IAM and AFL Boilermakers,‘ Mine-Mill
Local 415 received an overall 52 per
centmajority of the total 1,542 valid
votes cast in all the unit elections "at

‘ all four mines. 

The outcome of the elections here
demostrates a real victoryfor Mine-.
Mill and the union consciousness of the
majority of potash workers over one
of the most intensive and vicious*gang-
up of red-smearing raiders supported
by the daily press ever combined in a
single campaign against one local of
this union.

That Local 415 came out of this
fight still the major union in the
potash basin, still undisputed bargain-
ing agent at-the two-biggest mines, and
still undefeated by "any union at the
others, is a tribute to the rank and file
of a unionthat fights and wins on a
record of wage gains and better work-

‘ ing conditions for its members every-

Labor committee urges action
1 to save the Rosenbergs’ lives

A1bert’Pezzati, Mine-Mill board member for District 6, is one of‘
a 12-member group of trade union leaders who have initiated 2. Labor’

Committee to Secure Clemency for the Rosenbergs.
’ The Committee is appealing to trade unionists and local uniong to
take action quickly to help save the lives of5Ethel and Julius Rosenberg,

who have beeii condemned to die. dur-
ing the week of January 12 after con-
viction on’ charges of “conspiracy to
commit espionage.” ‘

The Labor Committee “emphasized

that it “does not take any position on.

the question of the guilt or innocence
of the Rosenbergs.” It points out that
the “death penalty is cruel and un-
usual punishment, especiallyso in view
of the comparatively light prison sen-
tences given ‘to ‘Tokyo Rose‘ and ‘Axis
Sally’ who were both convicted of trea-
son in behalf ’of our enemies during
World War II.”

’ At the same time, the Committee
called attention to the many civic, re-

ligious and legal figures who “have

raised serious questions of doubt con-
gerning the due process accorded the
Rosenbergs and the merit'"‘of.the evi-

dence on which the Ros_enberg's were 5

convicted.” .

”Among those who have spoken out
against the sentence meted the Rosen-
bergs ‘is Prof. Stephen Love, promi-
nent Catholic layman in Chicago and
a professor in the Northwestern Uni-
versity School of "Law. In a speech
earlier this month in Chicago, Profes-

'sor Love showed how weak was the ,

evidence, against the Rosenbergs, and
at the. same time challenged the fair-
ness of the trial given them by Judge

" Irving Kaufman.

Dorothy Thompson, syndicated news-
paper columnist, said more than a» year
ago: “The death sentence . . . depresses
me. In 1944, we were not’ at war with
the Soviet Union. Indeed, it is unlikely
that had they been tried in 19.44 they
would have received any such sentence.”

Arthur Garfield Hays, counsel’ for
the American Civil Liberties .Union,
wrote recently in The Nation: “We
may t'ry,but wecannot forrgetthe two
young Rosenberg children . . -. It is the
damnable death penalty that causes the
uneasiness.” . \

Again, the Churchman, organ of the
Episcopalian church, commented that
“the death sentence, in the light of the
far milder treatment of more serious

offenders than the‘ Rosenbergs, is,both'

   

cxcessivc and cruel. —- We believe that;

 

the execution of these two individuals

will only hurt the name of the United ,
_ States.” 4  —

Among the distinguished people who

havespoken out . in defense of the.

Rosenbergs are‘ Dorothy Day, editor of
the Catholic Wo'rke'r; Prof. Roland
Bainton, Yale Divinity School; Rabbi

_ Abraham Cronback; Rabbi _L. A. Green-

berg; U. S. Brigadier General Henry
Clay Newcomer; Honorable Sidney
Silverman, British Member of Parlia-
ment, and thousands of others.

The Labor Committee to Secure

Clemency for the Rosenbergs empha-
sized the belief that clemency can be
won, even-‘in the short time remaining

before January 12. But it added that.

“the chances for securing clemency de-
depend in great measureon the ‘actions
of‘ labor.” It recommended fourvkinds
of immediate action to be taken by
union members: i‘ ' I
