Peace andaprosperity

They called‘ the signing of the K0-

if Delegates pledge complete support
to defense of Jencks in T-H 1''

ST. LOUIS, Mo.—One of the most
dramatic highlights of the 60th Anni-
versary Convention came in a series
of floor -speeclies ‘in which delegates
from,eve1‘y section of the union pledged
complete support for the defense of

, Clinton Jencks, “all the way to the Su-

preme Court, if necessary.”

F The session was climaxed by a deep-
ly moving speech in which Jencks,
whose Taft-Hartley affidavit case goes
to trial in El Paso November 30,
pledged that “so long as I draw breath
in my body I will fi:_-;l1t in good faith
for the traditions of this country that
we love, for the traditions of this
Union that we love.”

THE DISCUSSION centered around
a resolution submitted to the Conven-
tion jointly by all Southwest locals,
which described the indictment of
Jencks as a “direct threat to every
elected leader of our union: it is a new
more in the old game of uuion-bust-
ingji _

Juan Chacon, President of the Bay-
ard Amalgamated District Union, Lo-
cal 890, led off the discussion with a
‘review of Jencks’ record as a union
leader in Bayard since 1946, including‘
a description of the long Empire Zinc
strike and the filming of the movie,
“Salt of the Earth.”

In the indictment of Jencks, Chacon

said, “It is very clear the companies
are out to destroy‘ not only Local 890
but the whole labor movement.” -

Asbury Howard, Mine—Mill Regional
Director in Alabama, told how Negro
workers in the South have fought over
the years to protect their militant white
brothers. “If they’ll stick by us, then
we’ll die by them,” he said. -And show-
ing the close link to the fight for Mexi-
can—American rights in the Southwest,
he went on:

“You know what they think? They
think if they get every Anglo leader,
then the Mexican- American people will
fold up.”

FROM CANADA, George Anderson

of Copper Mountain, Nike Solski of

Sudbury, Mike Kopinak of Port Col-

_borne and Al King of Trail all hit the

floor to pledge strong support for the
Jencks defense.

Time and again, the speakers likened
the persecution of Jencks to that of
“Big Bill” Haywood, who was Secre-
tary-Treasurer of the Western Federa-
tion of Miners in‘ the early 19005. “We
have had martyrs down through the
years,” said Scotty Anderson, “but
rnartyrs are not of the choosing of
Mine—Mill, they are created by actions
of the boss.” .

‘William Morton, ‘delegate from Perth

Delegates respond to
a fighting address by‘
.loeJohnson, MSC, leade

ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Delegates to the
Mine—Mill. Convention here were in
hearty agreement that one of the best
speakers they heard was Joe Johnson,
Secretary-Treasurer of the National
Union of Marine Cooks & Stewards.

Johnson’s speech was one of the high
points of the entire six,-day session.
The delegates gave him a standing
ovation.

It was a fighting speech. “The em-.

ployers_ have started on an offensive
against all workers,”,he said. “If they

‘can’t get you, they’1l buy you.

“They seek to guard written history.
They won’t let us know about our own
great traditions. They have control of
radio, TV and the press, and they

systematically try to keep the truth

from the people.” ' .

But Johnson added confidently: “We
know how to fight; they can’t destroy
us.”

Turning to the latest attacks on un-
ion leaders, he said, “They come with
the frameup against Hugh Bryson of
my union and Clint’ Jencks of your un-
ion. But they're not out for -Bryson
and Jencks-—they’re out to destroy our
unions. Their appetites will never be
satisfied.” F

Urging greater unity between Negro

 

 

I

Joo Johnson

and white workers, he said: “.You who
are white have a. tremendous respon-
sibility to destroy the myth of white
supremacy. If you're--going to keep a
man downin the (gutter, you've got to

- climb down into the gutter too!”

 

Amhoy Smelter &’Refinery Workers,
Local 365, spoke of the deep bonds be-
tween his local in the east and Local

890 in New Mexico, and added, “We:

have come to realize that any labor
leader who is_worth an ounce of salt
can very well find himself in the same
position as Clinton Jencks in the very
near future.”

Carl Borup of Local 392, Magna,
Utah, disclosed that the Mine—Mill
kennecott Council has contributed $500
to the Jencks Defense Fund, and said,
“He is one of our leaders; you may be
next.”

_ Jesse Gaines of Sloss Red Ore Union,
Local 109, declared that “We are com-
ing through great trial and tribulation.
But men of good will will keep on. We
may not be able to see you day by day,
Brother Jencks. But in our prayers
and in your need, you can look to the
Deep South.”

Larry Mower of Great Falls Mill &
Smeltermen’s Union, Local 16, pointed
out that, “It’s not just Jencks they are
after. They are after our movement.
They are after our union. Go back to
your locals an_d rally all the support
you can for Brother Jencks, because
you are not just defending Brother
Jencks,-you are defending the whole
labor movement.”

rameup

ANOTHER Montana pledge was
made by Walter Dooley of Local 117,
Anaconda, who said, “We from Mon-
tana are all behind Clinton Jencks-7
and I. think’ action is going to speak
louder than words.”

Bette Verri of Local 758 in Chicago,

; told how her local had joined in protest

picket lines put up by hundreds of
workers when the House unAmerican.
Activities Committee tried to attack
the labor nmveincut in Chicago last
year.

“It: accomplisliccl. a lot. pulling up
a fight and showing that you were not
going to take it.” she said.

Casey Vincent of Local 109 in Bes-
semer suggested that every member
of the lntermitional union should con-
tribute a dollar to the Jencks Defense
Fund and said: “'l‘o<ln_v it is Jencks and
it’ may be you or me tomorrow.”

THE CO.\'\'l<}\’l‘l0N unanimously
passed the l'(‘St)llll.i()ll which pledged
“every l‘(‘.‘~‘()lll'C6 of our Union” for the
defense of .l0ll('l(S “and any other of
our members who may be similarly
indicted.” It called upon every local
union to take “an active part” including
financial support of. the Jencks Defense
Fund, and asked that the International
Union assign full-time personnel to
assure full m~obili'/.ation in the case.

Canadian MP urges freer trade
in address to M nvenfion

ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Hon. James Byrne,
Liberal Member. of the Canadian Par-
liament, was one of the featured speak-
era at the 60th Anniversary Conven-
tion here. i ‘

Byrne, who formerly was an officer
of Mine-Mill Local 651 in Kimberly,
British Columbia, urged “freer trade”
between the United States and Canada.
He'condemned restrictions such as the
sliding scale tariff on lead and zinc
proposed to Congress by the Simpson
bill earlier this year.

He explained that when he learned
that the Simpson bill was getting
strong support in Congress, he intro-
duced a “retaliatory” resolution in the
Ottawa Parliament. “It was not in-
tended so much as a constructive solu-

’ tion, but to focus the attention of the
American public upon the absurdity of
the Simpson proposal,” Byrne said.
The Simpson bill failed to pass before
Congress adjorned last summer.

The Canadian MP paid tribute to
our Union's record of gains for, its
members, and lauded its “finest tradi-
tions of militant unionism.” “Because
of a natural militancy born of :1 dan-
gerous occupation—yet tempered with
good -and sound judgment—the,mi1iers
and smeltermen have led the way in
both of our great countries,” he said.

,- ‘.‘I predict a-bright and inspired fu-
ture for this union,..another 60 years
dedicated to serving” the men of the

mines and smelters and their loving,

families,” Byrne declared.“

talks to the convention will be printed in a coming issue of THE UNION.

Three changes in Constitution
will goon referendum ballot

ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Three important

"changes in the Mine-Mill Constitution

were proposed by the 49th Convention
here: ’

0 Changing the animal International
Union convention from September to
March. ‘

0 Providing for the newly-formed
Canadian l\’Iine-Mill Council.

OCreating a Canadian Vice Presi-
dency.

The main purpose of the proposal
to shift the annual Mine-Mill conven-
tion to March is to make itecoincid-e
with the opening of our Union’s yearly
bargaining campaign. ‘

District 7 Board Member Chase Pow-
ers, who was chairman of the Consti-
tution Committee \\'hicli"5recommended
the change, pointed ‘out that the an-
nual ltlining, Snieltirig & .,Refining Con-
ference and I\l2ltI9lll:I_l.,V\lH'cig‘e Policy Con-
ference could be held at the same time
as the Convention. -This"would make
it possible for many locals which now
cannot afford to send delegates to
bargaining conferences, to have repre-
sentation at both the convention and
the meetings at which our Union's
bargaining program is laid out.

THE CHANGE in convention month
would also mean a shift in the time of
the year at which the biennial Inter-
national "elections are ‘held. Nomina-
tions would be made at the conven-
tion in March, and the referendum elec-
tion would be held in May.

The organization of l a Canadian

 Mine—Mill Council is proposed “in rec-

ognitionyof the fact that the member-
ship of the International Union "in
Canada has distinct and separate na-

' tional problems.” The amendment pro-

vides that the Council should have its

own by-laws, and that “the Interna- _

tional Executive Board shall take no
action inconsistent wit’.l1,such by-laws
and shall otherwise take no action
having specific and direct application
to ‘ the_ Canadian membership witliout

consultation with and approval of are
‘ -Canadian Mine-Mill Council.” '

The’ Canadian Council was actually

formed at the national Canadian con-"

vention at Calgary, Alberta last
March,'and has been functioning for
several months. ,

If this amendment is passed by the

Districts 3, 4 shared
entertainment honors

The honor of serving as host
to the International Convention
was divided this year. St. Louis
is in Mine-Mi1l’s District 4; so
local unions of that district par»-
ticipated in welcoming the dele-
gates and planning entertain-
ment. However, the nearest local
to St. Louis is Fairmont Smelter
Workers Union, Local 82,’ which
is in District 3—just across the
Mississippi river from St. Louis,
in East St. Louis, Ill. Local. 82-
took the main responsibility for
entertainment, with the help of
other locals in District 3 and
those of District 4.

Local 82 gave a night-club type
party for the delegates at Mexi-
can Hall in their city. The host
locals took the entire convention
to the Cardinal-Dodger game on"
the 17th, and furnished entertain-
ment for the convention banquet.

all the communities in the area were
buying tickets in a strike /relief raffle,
launched last week by Local 581.

Two strikers were arrested by state
Fish & Game wardens on charges of
' illegal poss-ession of deer meat. The

local promptly protested to state offi-
cials that government agencies were
being used in what was clearly a strike-
breaking action.

PEACE ANI1 P110

HE signing of the Korean truce and the

cessation of the shooting war in that

ravaged country is a major achievement of
the peace-loving peoples of the world.

It proves the idiocy of trying to settle
international differences with violence,
death and destruction.

No event of the past several years has
given so much hope to the common people
of the world as the Korean truce; it is the
people and not the warmakers who do the
dying, suffering and starving.

First step

But. the Korean truce is only the first
step.

Wasteful military expenditures are still
a crushing burden for the people. Living
standards are still being depressed because
of cold—war tensions and their resultant
economic consequences. Hunger, disease
and death still stalk large sections of the
world. In our own two countries, the
United States and Canada, the warmongers
are still fostering hysteria and hatred, and
are using their cold war to take away many
of the freedoms of our peoples.

The realities of life are changing the
thinking of many workers who once saw
in war production “at least” something
better than unemployment. But now we
find that a so-called war boom is but a
prelude to depression. In the midst of the
greatest profit spree in history for Big

(DBGAN

HEprimary obligation of this Union is to

advance the welfare of our membership.
The first way to do this is to keep our union
strong by defending it against raiding, and
by building our Union in our basic juris-
diction and in those areas where the
strengthening of our union is dependent on
further organization, through organization
of the unorganized.

The job of organizing is made more dif-
ficult by the disunity of labor which has
brought about the practice of dis-organiz-
ing the organized, with a simultaneous de-
cline in new organization, particularly evi-
dent in the collapse of the Southern organ-
izing drives of both the CIO and AF of L.

The cost of Taft-Hartleyism, and the gen-
eral climate of growing politicallreaction,
has been great in terms of- loss of members
to the entire ‘labor movement.

. ‘Basic solution
Therefore, there can be no basic solution
to the problem of organizing the unorgan-
ized until labor uﬁity has been established
I

'in the U. S. and Canada.

I

There can be no guarantee of protecting
the wage standards and conditions of our
membership without fighting for abor
unity, and especially the unity of the work-
ers within our own jurisdiction.

The promise of unity in the labor move-
ment today is at its highest’peak in more
than 15 years. A .

In the-face of growing uncertainties in
the economic situation and with the Re-
publican administration making wider use

of the Taft-Hartley law, with the labor S

movement itself generally under the most
serious attack since before the day of the
New Deal, workers are more and more con-
cerned about developing labor unity.

This is reflected in the growing number
of discussions on unity among a great many
unions in the same or related industries, as
wellas on the top level of the AFL and CIO.

Increasing response

It is also reflected in the increasing re-
sponse among other unions in our industry
to our efforts to bring about joint action
on bargaining and legislation andiother
matters of vital concern to the membership-
of all unions. 1

The following principles provide the basis

Business, workers are being laid off in
many sections of ‘industry, including our
own.

PEACE is important to the members of
our Union. It is important because our
jobs, our constitutional liberties, the se-
curity of our families is so-dependent on
peace. ‘~‘ .

This week, at Chicago, Adlai E. Steven-
son said something with which we are in
accord.

“There is an uneasy feeling," he‘,,said,-
“that the United States is show’ ’\§ign.s
of economic nationalism, of a drii ‘ward
no trade and no aid. But our friends must
trade to live and not many are going to go
hungry, I" suspect, to prove to us how anti-
Communist they are.”

Must trade to live

If other nations must trade to live, it is
doubly true for the United States and Can-
ada. ln this country, the United States,
we despd',-rately need increased world trade,
not with just some nations, but with all
nations. 1 ‘

While the U. S. needs relatively few
products from outside its borders, it does
need desperately huge world markets for
our mass production industries. _. Present
U. S. foreign policy, based on what Mr.
Stevenson said is “that which We are
against and not what we are for,” will
bring on either a world war or a world-
wide depression.

ZING AND LA

of our Union’s program on organizing and
labor unit_v during the coming year:

We must continue and wherever possi-
'ble_ step up our campaign to organize the
unorganized workers in the basic jurisdic-
tion of our Union. Specifically, the organiz-
ing drives in th Southwest and Canada
and in other areas where the industry is.ex-__-
panding must be continued.

We must place labor unity as a top ‘ Q

. ‘question of overriding importance.
Every aim set forth by this convention,

, from our wage program to our legislative

and political action program, will be easier
to reach if we build allies throughout the
rest of organized labor.

Unity in our ‘industry

3 Our own first steps toward unity must
‘have as the\target-the uniting of work-
ers in our own industry in a common bar-
gaining fight, regardless of affiliation. Just
as we welcome the appearance of the Na-
tional Anaconda Conference, we would wel-
come the formation .of a National American
Smelting & Refining Conference, a Na--
tional Phelps—Dodge Conference, 3. National
Kennecott Conference, as well as nation-

wide conferences of the unions in the brass‘ .

industry, the lead—zinc industry, and the
iron ore industry. _

We believe all the unions in this industry
can get togetherin common action to defeat
the strategy of .the employers which ' es

A COLD-WAR POLICY resulting in the
shrinkage of our trade with other coun-
tries must be abandoned. The nation’s
energies must be turned to production for
peace. This means, primarily, expanding
the home market, but it also means that
the productive capacity of U. S. industry
is so enormous that we must also have

_ mass markets abroad to keep our factories
and labor force fully employed. ' _

R: Expanding market needed

Like the rest of American industry, the
non-ferrous metals industry has a‘p1-oblem
that will not be solved by a bigger share
of a coptracting market. Rather, it can
only be solved by its fair share of an ex-
panding market. It was for this basic rea-
son that Mine-Mill expressed opposition to
Simpson sliding-scale tariff bill, a
measure that was unworkable and which
sought to insulate the domestic non-ferrous
metals industry from the rest of the world.

The so-called “imports” which the Simp-
son bill sought to prevent-’ are “foreign"
‘only’ in the sense that they come from
mines located in other countries. As Sec-
retary-Treasurer Travis told a Congres-
sional committee last April, “the control--
and the profits—are in the hands of cor-
iporations which have their headquarters in
New York City.”

THE IMPORTATION of non-ferrous

/

.filiation a barrier to the achievement of
unity on the question of fighting for higher
wages and other" immediate gains. It is
through the common fight for our mutual
welfare that all the workersin the industry
will gain the understanding that will ulti-
mately bring about the organic unity of al
workers in our industry. ‘

Joint bargaining

 Wepropose that this Convention issue

‘an announcement to the other unions in
this industry and to the whole of organized
labor, to the effect that Mine—Mil1 stands
ready to enter into negotiations aimed at
taking our rightful place in any unified
labor movement.

Immediate negotiations can be aimed at
joint bargaining agreements within this in-
dustry. We are ready to negotiate with
any union holding contracts in this indus-
-try, because we -believe the members of
.these unions need and want the strength
that unity gives as much as we need and
want it. A

 There are still several places where
,' I

Mine-Mill locals are being maintained
even though they no longer hold certifica-
:tion as bargaining -agent. Examples of‘ this

_are the TCI locals in Alabama and some

Lead Belt locals. This Convention recom-

V niends to the loyal members of these locals
' that they. lay aside any feelings of bitter-
, ~n'ess against raiders which may still exist,

  
 

 join sincerely and wholeheartedly what-
; er _union now actually is the bargaining

'~ ﬁﬁiengt.

Their rightful place is alongside their fel-
glow-workers and in the leadership of the
fight for their own conditions. They will
-thereby make‘ a great contribution to the
membership of Mine_-Mill- as well, because

We note and support Adlai Stevensonis

it never be said that America was reluctant

advocacy of conferences with the Soviet

UNITY

out, all industry. We must take every step
possible which has as its ultimate goal the
inclusion of our union in any realignment
of the American labor movement.
VVe in Mine-Mill must take immediate
'steps to unite with other ‘groups in addi-
tion to unions in our own areas and commu-
nities—-farm, Negro, Mexican—American,
professional and_small business. There are

many organizations in every one of our”

communities which have the same goals we
have; we have an ‘obligation to seek avenues
of unity with them to fightzonispecific is-
sues where our interests are the same.

In seeking labor unity and community
‘unity, we in Mine-Mill must take, the
fullest possible advantage of the fact that
there are a large number ofpoints in our
own program on whicli there is either par-
tial or full agreementby millions of Amer-
icans, including the members of other
unions. Ways can and must be found to
unite with these millions of _our fellow-
citizenslin defeiise of"our common interests.

Prosecution of labor leaders for alleged
perjury in Taft-Hartley ‘affidavits received
two set-backs last week.

Anthony Valentino, the only man so far
convicted of this charge, was fused by :1
decision of the Third U. S. Circuit Court of
Appeals -in Philadelphia. Valentino had
served about six months‘ in prison before
the reversal. ‘ — 7

While the court’s ruling was on a tech-
nical point-of jurisdiction, it constituted
a rebuke to‘ the Camden, N. J ., court which
had assumed jurisdietion in the case; Gov-
ernment attorneys now must decide
whether re-indictment would constitute
double jeopardy. —

A ST. LOUIS',_,1V_Io.—The 49th Conven-

commend the International Executive
Board for choosing to hold the conven-
tion in the City of St. Louis which, it
said, “will be a better ci_ty~because'of
our meeting here in a non-segregated
convention.” I ‘

Earlier, Joe J o hen s o n, Secretary-
Treasurer of the Marine Cooks & Stew-
ards union, had pointed out to the dele-
gates that they were holding the first
non-segregated labor convention in the
history of Louis. “Mine-Mill has
done .it again!” he exclaimed in 3. ref-
erence to the many ways in which our
Union has made history. ‘

"We extend our congratulations to
the DeSoto Hotel for housing and feed-
ing our delegates on an unsegregated
basis. We likewise express our appre-
ciation to the few other restaurants in
the city which also followed this prac-
tice,” the resolution said. -

_“We‘ can only offer the sharpest
criticism to all other restaurants, tav-

‘ Senate committee ends

probe of Chavez election

WASI-IINGTOl\'—(FP)—The Senate.
subcommittee on privileges and elec-
tions has ended its investigation of
the 1952 senatorial election in New
Mexico won by Dennis Chavez, the
Democratic incumbent. ,

The “sour grapes” probe was started
by the Republicans, who charged
wholesale violation of the election laws

and demanded“ a recount. With the
GOP narrowly in control of the §en-

ate, ‘over $100,000 was authorized ‘to-‘~'=“

investigate the election. A staff of 60
was hired. Unofficial reports indicat-
ed later that as the inquiry proceeded,
Chavez’ margin of victory over his
Republican opponent, Maj. Gen. Pat-
rick J. Hu1'ley, was widened rather
than reduced by the recount. .

Sen. Thomas C. Hennings (D, Mo.)
subcommittee member, said the in-
quiry was over and it was his View
that “no fraud chargeable to Sen.
Chavez, his managers or anyone con-

nected with his campaign” had been

found. The two Republican members
of the 3-man subcommittee made no
comment other than to say an official
report was being prepared. ‘

EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.——One of the
most stubborn “hold-outs” of them all,
American Zinc Co., came through with
a wage increase here on the eve of
Mine-Mill’s International convention
across the river in St. Louis. The set-
tlement came after a 48-hour, SlZ1'1l(€
called by Fairmon Smelter Workers
_ Union, Local 82.

The local had been bargaining‘ with
A—Z management for months, without
‘getting’ even-a penny offer. When the
same company settled up with Mine-
Mill Local 515 at its mine in_ Metal-
lino Falls, Washington, members of
Local 82 were hopeful that A-Z would
settle with them, too.

But the company ‘still held out. The
smelter workers’ patience finally be-

. came exhausted and they_walked out.
\ ‘ “ THE SE'l"l‘LEMEN’l‘ calls for a gen-
- eral 5-cent wage increase, retroactive
to July 1. It also provides that the
union may ask for further neg_otia-
tions January 1 under a “one-way"
reopening clause. ,

District Smeltermen’s local 480 at Trail, T

a Sacred program ignores
issues ollluhor law

VANCOUVER, B.C.--British Colum-
bia’: Legislature connnenced thti first
session under the new Social Credit
government September 15, and the
Speech from the Throne (a formal
agenda of proposed business) had lit-
tle in it for labor.

'1‘o be sure, the government made

some veiled references to equal pay
for equal work for women in industry,

but there will be no action this session ’

on amendments to the \Industrial Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Act, the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, or on
any of the other issues to which 13.-
bor has repeatedly called attention. It
was specifically stated that such would
be dealt with at the spring session, if
at all. '

Labor Minister Lyle Wicks has an-
nounced that he will call a meeting
shortly of the AFL and CCL Councils,
to discuss with them proposed changes
in the above acts, as he did with Mine-
Mill a few weeks ago. The two coun-
cils ‘had announced that they would
not attend his meeting if Mine—Mill
were present, on the grounds that our
union had been expelled from the CCL.

The invitation to the new confer-
ence has put them fairly on the spot,
since they are not at all anxious to
meet with Wicks, preferring to make
a party political issue of the amend-
ments to having them passed with the
Socreds gett_ing the credit. Also,
neither Council is very keen’ about co-
operating with the other. They have
not yet responded to the minister's in-
vitation to the meeting.

  Rank and tile reverse
Mosher-order in CCL

MONTREAL, Que.—A. R. Mosher,-

president of the Canadian Congress of
Labor, received a nasty body. blow
from the delegates to the 13th na-
tional CCL convention here on Sep-
tember 14.

They reversed a ruling‘ of the juris-
dictional com/mittee, headed by Mosher,
which gave jurisdiction over two new
Edmonton, Alberta, plants to District
50 of_ the United Mine Workers of
Agnerica, and determined that the
Oilworkers International Union, CIO,
should organize the plants.

The reversal of the ruling by the
convention has special significance in
British Columbia, where the UMWA
took advantage of it to attempt to
wrest jurisdiction of two tar -and
chemical plants in Vancouver from the
International Woodworkers of Ameri-
ca.

A.standing vote of the 756 dele-
gates gave an overwhelming majority
against the executive ruling. Some
delegates ‘considered the action as 8

rebuff to John L. Lewis, ‘from CCL-

members wishing to keep his, influ-
ence in Canada _ carefully
scribed. But any analysis must include
the point that the seldom-defeated
Mcisher, who stops at practically ‘noth-
ing to’ get his own Wayat a conven-
tion or elsewhere, received a nasty re-
minder that the rank "and file have

some say too. '
