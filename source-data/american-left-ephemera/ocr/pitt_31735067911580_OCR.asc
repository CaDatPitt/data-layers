Travis debunks

  stories on movie

DENVER — Maurice Travis,
Mine-Mill Int’l Secretary-Treas-
urer, last week sent a letter to all
localsdebunking the stories car-
ried by many newspapers and
radio stations about the movie
“Salt of the Earth.”

, _“Not one thin dime. of our"
_. Union’s money is being used to -
i. make the production,” Travis said. .'
* “Not one cent from our Union's
, dues money,-‘no financial aid of .
. any kind, no monetary investment
whatever is being. made by our '2

Union in this picture.”.

Travis said the film is being
made by a film company, ‘fthe
president of which owns a chain
of theaters in Los Angeles, and

" who to the best of my knowledge

has never ever been called a ‘red’
in his life.”

“Our Union is acting as sponsor
and is named as producer of the
film because the story itself is
about part of the life of our
Union. Our members are playing
all but one of the leading roles in
it,” he added. “We consented to
the use of our Union as a sponsor
of the film because we think it is
about time the American people
got an opportunity to see some-

thing besides Hopalong Cassidy-

and technicolor musicals.”

The movie’s story is “about a

»man and wife, both of whom were ‘

involved in a strike,” Travis ex-
plained. “The main theme of the
story is directed to showing the
difficulties of the wife of a
striker, first in trying to make
ends meet" while her husband is
on strike, and second in trying to

-evolve some role for herself so
that she may contribute equally"

to the struggle in which her hus-
band is involved.-” .

“Of course, the reason for this‘

whole attack on the picture is
that companies don't want the
world -to know that their foremen

and deputies do take out -their.

sadistic hatred on the men,
women and kids, mostly of
Mexican-American origin, who

fight for their bread and butter,” "

he added. .
“The leadership of our Union

is very proud of what is being‘

done with the picture. We feel
that the final production will be a

magnificent job from the stand-.

point of letting the world know

how the Mexican-American and

Anglo brothers and sisters
worked together and fought to-
gether; how our Union emerged
victoriously in a long fight with

one of the most viciously anti-'
. labor ,companies_ in America.’_’..

N ational: Mining, ,

WHY?

By Morris Wright

Bayard, N. M. “

NION people here were taken by
surprise at the violent reaction of

the employers, acting through their
agents, against the making of a mo-
vie. -

We went into this project with high

T spirits. Weifwere going to tell the ''

story of our lives, for once, in 3 form
that would reach millions of people-
that would gain _a sympathetic under-
standing of our problems. I '
We did not, of course: expect the em-
ployers to share our enthusiasm. We
were not surprised when an employer
spokesman showed anger against what
we were doing. We were prepared for
criticsm, but we thought freedom of
expression applied to movie-making.
What developed was the most violent
press attack this local union has ever
been subjected to, with resulting vio-
lence against persons and property by

company finks and a few anti-union"

lunatics.

Just over a year ago, a 15-month
strike was ended at the Empire Zinc
mine in nearby Hanover. During the
course of that strike, many forms of
violence were used against the strikers
and their families. But never in that

strike did the newspapers attack us as=‘

they are doing now; never was the ef-
fort made to whip up a lynch spirit, a
get-out-of-town-or-die phobia, as hap-
pened last week.

WHY IS IT that company agents
become more violent when we ‘tell 5
story with strike scenes than they did
over an actual strike? People here
think it is because the employers see in
our movie a threat to their monopoly
control over the major means of com-
mumcat1on——daily papers, radio," tele-

. vision, magazines and movies.

The last‘ named is the only one of
these major. formsof communication in
which a union has started to break
through and tell a union story. If we
succeed in this, they may reason, not
only will millions of people see our
movie, but it may ‘start a trend; other
unions will want to make movies about
the lives of their members.

A WELL-MADE movie‘—-and "‘Salt of
the Earth” is well-made—tells a story
in warm, emotional terms. The person
seeing it tends to identify himself or

herself with the leading players. In.

this way, a new understanding of what
- it means to be a worker, what itsmeans
to haye a union, can be brought to
people outside the union movement.
This might affect their attitudes in the
future. It might mean‘ less isolation

for a union during a struggle with an

employer.

_ So the reason for the violent reac-
tion is not too hard to see. Only a
tiny minority was involved in the re-
action, but this - minority attempted to
destroy the camera and the sets, to
frightenpeople away.

The union people There’ answered
them last week when more than 500

men and women turned out to an over- i
flow meeting. They came to protest __
the attacks on their union--to defend

the right of a union to tell_ its story
in words, in pictures — anyway we
choose. , , r

I This should be the answer lofﬂunion  ' 1 
_ _’people everywhere." _ " F   '

BAYARD, N. M.—Sl1ooting of

I the movie “Salt of the Earth.’ was”
completed here March 7. It IS ex-

pected to be ready for showing in‘
June.

Violence by hoodlums and the
detention of the film’s star,
Rosaura Revueltas of Mexico
City, hampered the last days of
work. '

Wire service and newspaper re-
ports of actions against the movie
crew and Mine-Mill Local 890 mis-
represented the facts. At no time
were there more than a tiny
minority who tried to interfere.
Most of the people of this area
are working people who support
the movie project. Most of the
other population was either

. friendly or neutral.

First violence came at night,
following the first publication of
a newspaper editorial carrying a
veiled call for gangsterism. That
night a carload of men tried to
destroy movie sets on the ranch
where most of the shooting was
done. ‘

—A widely-publicized story about
a “group of citizens” of Central,
N. M., gathering to stop the
shooting was false. The movie
crew left on request of a police-
-man, despite the fact that they
had prior permission to make a
street scene. ‘ ~ ‘

THE NEXT DAY, 3. Bayard

 

  'l!io_v‘ie ce5mpieteds,d-e spite
violence by company finks

gdruggist, Earl Lett, kicked over

the movie camera, damaging ill."
and assaulted both Floyd Bostick
and Int’l rep. Clinton Jencks. Bos-
tick is warden-conductor of Local
.890. Both men were struck while
being held by other union mem-
bers' who wanted to prevent a
fight. Lett is the same man who
assaulted J encks during the Em-
pire Zinc strike. ~ Later, Jencks’
parked car was found‘ with five
bullet holes in it.

A vigilante meeting in Central
then “warned” the movie crew

and Jencks to be out of the area ,

by dark or “be carried out in pine
boxes.” '

Precautions w er e taken by
Local 890 to prevent further
assaults on its people. State police

‘arrived and agreed to give protec-
tion during the remaining days of
film making. ,

LOCAL 890 last week sent Joe
T. Morales, charter member and
leader of the union, to Washing-
ton toask New Mexico "members
of Congress to take a hand in pr -
tecting the union and Miss
Revueltas from attacks. Appeals

were made also to the'National _

A—ss’n for Advancement of Colored
People at Albuquerque, to 3.
Southwest migrant labor , confer-
ence in the state, andto thestate
government at Santa Fe.

Protestas Contra detencion
do actriz   mexicana montan

EL PASO, Texas——Rosaura Revuel-
tas, magnifica estrella del cine mexi-
eano quien actﬁa el papel central en

la pelicula “Sal de la Tierra,” todavia ‘

sigue detenida (al publicarse esta edi-
cién sera el dec' 10 dia de su detencién)
por la inmigrac 6n estadounidense.

En Mexico continuan; montando las
protestas contra este insulto a una ciu-
dadana mexicana. Jorge Negrete, presi-
dente de la Asociacién Nacional de
A-ctores Mexicanos, declare: “Si ' no,
libran a Rosaura Revueltas para que
continue su trabajo en "Sal de la Tier-
ra,’ today actor hollywoodense ahora
en Mexico seré suspendido y se le pro-
hibira continuar sus producciones.”

Ben Margolis, licenciado de la Sen-
orita Revueltas, acusé que la detencién
—-do Rosaura Revueltas era una con-
spiracién con el fin de impedirle ter-
minar su trabajo en la pelicula. Cite
el hecho de que al principio lee ofre-
-cieron su libertad bajo fianza de $500.

Cuando indicé su intencién de com-
plir con .-este requisito, rechazaron la

aoferta. Entonces le ofrecieron _su li- ,

bertad condicional bajo condiciones‘
permitiendole trabajar en la pelicula.
Antes de que pudiera aceptar, retiraron
.-esta oferta y la sujetaron a detencién
bajo vigilancia, prohibida a salir de
El Paso o a trabajar.

El argumento del departamento de
inmigracién, segun presentado en una
audiencia .el pasado 2 de marzo, se
basa en dos puni;os—-que el pasaporte
de la Senorita Revueltas no se habia
estampado indicando su admisién a este
pais, y la aplicasién retroactiva de la

— ley McC«a1-ran-Walter, lo cual es con-

trario al sentido de la ley. A Revueltas
le dicron su vista antes de que dicha ley
entrara en vigor.

Seﬁorita Revueltas pudo demos-
vtrar que entré con todos -sus docum-
entos en orden, que los habia sometido
a un inspector de la inmigracién, y

 -que la habian admitido a los EE. UU.

sin interrogacién, El hecho de que -el
anspector no hizo las notaciones nece-
aarias en el pasaporte constituia neg-

: ligencia. ~

Aunque la vista de Revueltas se la
dieron conianterioridad a la nueva ley
Mc’Carran-Walter, el departmento do

inmigracién sostuvo :.u ‘p9sici6n de que’

la vista debe haber complido con todos
los requisites de /dicha ley. La ley mis-
ma sdiceiclaramentenque ningun docu-
mento existente con anterioridad a di-
cha ley serzi afectado por la misma.

En la tarde del dia 2 de marzo, des- _

pués de la audiencia, la Senorita ‘Re-
vueltas 'recibi6 una invitacién de las
locales de Mine-Mill en El Paso para
hacer uso .de la palabra en una junta
extraordinaria. Los oficiales de la in-
migraci6n'le dijeron que si aceptaba
esta invitacién, seria deportada inme-
diatamente. — '

La Senorita Revueltas asistié a la

junta pero _no hizo uso de la palabra.
Ignoramos la-decision del departa-
'mento de inmigracién‘ después de la
audiencia. Pero los abogados de la
Seﬁorita Revueltas anunciaron . "que
apelarian la decision si no es favorable.

arrest’ of Mexican actressgt 

EL PASO, Texas-—Rosaura Revuel-
tas, leading actress of Mexico and star
of the film “Salt of the Earth,” was
being held here.-in custody of the UPS.
Immigration Service for the tenth day
as THE UNION went to press.

Protests were mounting in Mexico '-at _

this insult to a Mexican citizen. Jorge
Negrete, president of the National As-

sociation of Actors in Mexico, said: -

“Unless Rosaura Revueltas is freed

‘to continue her workon ‘Salt of the

Earth,’ every Hollywood actor now in
Mexico will be suspended andbarred
from continuing their productions.”
Ben Margolis, attorney for'Miss Rev-
ueltas, charged ‘that the detention of
Miss Revueltas was an illegal conspir-
acy to prevent her from completing her
work on the picture. ‘He citedthe fact

that she at first was offered freedom

on a $500 bond. When. shewas pre-
pared to post bond, this offer was with-.
drawn. She then was-offered a parole
on conditions permitting her to work
in the picture. Before she could accept,
this was withdrawn and ‘she was held
under guard, forbidden to leave El Paso
or to work, .
The Immigration Department’s case,
as presented at a hearing here March

' 2, was based on two points--that Miss

Revueltas’ p a s s p 0 r t had not been
stamped to show her’admission to this
country, and on a retroactive applica-
tion of the McCarran-Walter act, con-
trary to the terms of that act.

MISS REVUELTAS was able to
show that she had entered with_all re-
quired documents, had submitted them
to an immigration inspector, and had
been admitted to the U. S. without

inI'| bowling match
PORT COLBORNE, Ont.—Mine-Mill

Local 637 here played host one night

recently to Mine-‘Mill Local "593, Buf-
falo,‘ N. Y., in a bowling match.

The “hands acres the border”,. affair 0

saw 20 bowlers from the ABC shop in
Buffalo ‘visiting this; refinery center
under leadership of three of‘ their offi-
cers—-President ,E'rnie Gunsalus, Vice
President John Pawinski and Financial
Secretary Charles Me-itn'er—and Int’l

. Representative Joe Scioli. '

“Although the brothers. had never
met one another, within five minutes
complete understanding, and friendship
was formed,” reports Mike Kopinak,
president of Local 637.

“After hilaif iusly bowling; for three-
hours, the hosts brought the Buffalo
brothers’ to their Un' in Hall where a
buffet. lunch was Tse ved, with good
Canadian ale and beer to help the lunch
down,” he.‘ adds.

Later there was a discussion of work-

'ing conditions in the two shops, the
_ differences between th_e,t.Jo countries,

and plans for further -activities. between
the twdlocals. An “invitation was. ex-
tended to the Port Colborne brothers to
return the bowling evening in the-,IIear
future.

_ While in Port Colborne, the Buffalo
brothers visited the new labor temple
being built by the members of Local
637, which is now nearing completion.

In charge of the evening were Local
637 President Kopinak, Executive Board
member Louis Brema, and Stan Shy-
mansky and Mickey Pine of Local 637's‘-
sports committee.

D for Canadians this year

VANCOUVER, B. C.—There will be
at’ least two elections in Canada this
year, a Federal one and another in
British Columbia, all political sooth-
sayersaagreed .after publication of the
Ottawa. and Victoria budgets. They
are definitely election bait.

The Victoria Social Credit govern-CF

“ment was the .first to take the plunge,

on February. 17, with proposals that
will make-~ it tough for the opposition
toa answer. They have 'stolen one-- or
two planks from the latter party’s
platform, with a ten per cent natural
resources tax on mining and logging
profits, and relaxation of some: of 'the"
nuisance taxes instituted ‘by the former
liberal-Tory coalition crowd.

It is without a. doubt a popular
budget, that is, with all but the forest
and mining operators. The latter are
screaming that the ten per cent tax" on
all profits over $25,000 will kill invest-

" ment . in the .province, and make it

impossible for small operations to con-

tinue. .

To this the District Union‘ News
(Mine-Mill) ironically replies in its-.
current issue that never before any

arbitration or c‘on‘ciliation board has!’

any operator admitted any profit any-
way, so that if they haven’t lied the
tax‘won’t affect them. But the heat ~

-andfury of theircondemnation seems .

to "indicated thatgniaybe they have lied. .
AU‘-I‘O TAXES are also reduced

slightly; taxes on meals are made ap- —

plicable to- one dollar and above.-instead
of fifty cents as heretofore; and a pay-
as-we-go policy declared for public
works. ~ 1

. summer, is placating the ‘voters-

ing, and proposed nothing on the find-
ings of the three commissions on the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, the In-
dustrial Conciliation and Arbitration
Act, or the Hospital Insurance‘ Act.

It is still evident that these may be

reserved‘ for more election bait, and the

probability that early summer will see
‘a provincial election, with Social
Credit, at the present time, the favor-
ite. ’

The Ottawa Liberal government,
also- likely to go to the country this

through a-cut, announced in a budget
two days after the provincial one, in
9: lot of nuisance taxes.

CIGARETTES have already dropped
six cents a packet in British Columbia,

due-to tax reductions, and the license .

feevhas been lifted off radios, a highly
popular measure. The stamp tax on
checks and other mediums of exchange
has alsoibeen lifted.

But the Ottawa government has done
more in the way of tax reduction for
the" corporations than for the working
man, whose income tax is reduced 11
per cent. On small incomes this doesn’t
amount to very much, but it is an
across the board percentage cut, so it

. really will put money into the pockets

of the tycoons.

Anaconda stayed out- of the market
for several. days and then, five days
after decontrol, set a price of 32 cents
a pound for its domestic production.

Meanwhile, customs smelters which
buy their ore and scrap from others,
were quoting prices of from 32 to 38
cents a- pound. All concerns empha-
sized that prices were on a day-to-day

. basis,.subiect to change on short notice.

There were varied estimateson what
the final outcome of all this would be".
Most trade sources, according. to the:
New York Times of March 1 “expect
the price" to stabilize within a‘ few
months. at around 30 cents.”

sent to the U. S1 for refining and then
sent back to England for sale.

Sale of Rhodesian copper in the U. S.
at this time is cauged by a sharp fall
in British demand and the piling up of
government-held, stocks. Copper is the
on. non-ferrous metal in
which canlstill be bought and sold only
through the government. Metal—using-
industries. in Britain took only 18,000
tons of copper in December against
20,000 in November and a normal
average of about 30,000 tons.

 ' Stockpiling of Some Metctls Continues

for which broad expansion programs
are now under way. These include an-
timony, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead,
manganese, "molybdenum, tungsten and
zinc. '
Materials in the government stock-
pile at the end of 1952 were valued
at $4,024,622,630 on the basis of cur-
rent prices. These materials plus those
now under, contract represent 78- per
cent of the present stockpiling. goal.

Wholesale food prices, according to

tered their fourth successive advance"

The contract, Dawson says, will go

expenditure of $4,788,000, which is‘
nearly $1,700,000 above what the coun-

/try would pay for the same quantity

of zinc from our domestic producers
at the current price. ,

“This contract,” said Dawson, ”fo-
cuses the spotlight on the type of ‘buy

taxpayers millions of dollars, throwing’
U. S. miners out of workland making ~
the’ nation increasingly dependent upon

i Injuries cost 41 million man-days/’

Suppose that strikes in the U. S.‘ in
any one year caused a loss of as much
as 41 million man-days of production.

That’s a lot of days lost. It’s far
greater than the average yearly loss
from strikes. It's more than ten times
as much time as Iwaslost by the nation-
wide Mine-Mill strike in 1951.

If strikes caused that much of a pro-
duction loss——would_ you be reading
about it in the papers? You bet you
would. You’d be reading it in great
big headlines. . . .

You could also count on a few dema-
gogues to shriek about the"union men-

' ace.
weep about how this was betraying our
boys in Korea. And you’d probably -get
a few mor.e investigations into “Com-
munist” influence in "unions.

And. yet——when 41 ‘million man-days
were lost through disabling, work in-

juries last year—you couldn't even find '

a- mention of it in most papers. We

Some Senator would be-sure to_

O

‘ /

saw. the story in only a few labor
papers.

The figure on time lost through on-
the-job accidents—-a preliminary esti-
mate—was released by the Bureau of,
Labor Statistics. When. to this figure
of 41 million men-days lost there is
added the future effects of deaths-. and
permanent physical impairments, ,the
total economic time loss amounts to
about 206 million man-days. That's
equal to a year's full time employment
for 687,000 workers.

The economic loss through accidents

in 1952 was chalked up by slightly over »

two million workers. _It included 15,000
deaths and 84,000 permanently ‘disab-
ling injuries. '_ 5'
About 1,000 workers died from acci-
dents in all branches of the mining
industry. Seventy-five thousand min-1
ers were injured in accidents: '
When figures like these’ make, big
headlines-—then, maybe, we-’ll be "able!
to take really effective action against
this shocking-loss of life and limb.‘

Rctcketeering in medicine

4 There’s a_ lot of cheating, and rack-
eteering in the medical profession.
That's the claim made by a-man who
should know——Dr. Paul R. Hawley, di-
rector of the American College of Sur-
A geons. and former chief medical director
of the U. S. Veterans Arministration.‘
, 'Dr. Hawley made his charges in an
interview in U. S. News &: World Re-
port _for February 20. Speaking main-
ly of surgery, he ‘cited fourmain un-
'e,-thical pi‘actices—1) splitting fees‘ with

the doctor who referred the case to the ,
- surgeon; 2) "ghost surgery, by which

afyoung doctor actually dperates for a. L,/-’ '

small sum while the older physician,_£'

“w—ho~-was supposed to doffit, collectsaf
big sum from the patient‘; 3) needless.’
surgery just-to enrich the surgeon; and?"
4) plain overcharging. L V
“Fee splz'tti'ng,” said Hawley, ‘f/results
in a lot of bad swrgery, and a. terrible
lot of mmecessary sztrgemj. Y ou’d be

shocked at the amount of u«nnecessaxry.
surgery that is performed."

Among unnecessary operations. the
favorite ones, Hawley said, were re-i
moving normal appendices. “I can show
you places where 60% and 70% of the.
appendices removed are normal,’_’ he
stated, adding that in honorab1e¢,sur-
gery not more than 10 to 15% are

- normal, as ‘there are mistakes in diag-

nosis. , . A »
Howley also hit- at “chiseling" by.
doctors on patients covered by hospita
and surgical insurance plans. ‘ /
“Some of theseitloctors who would
charge $100 foran operation find out
that ct man is insured and add another
$50 to ‘the bill, sa=the man can pay
some of it himself,’’; ‘he pointed out.

. , . . . .3 ., .
“The few chzselers m med-acme,” said .

Hawley, “bring discredit on the’ enti/rs-1
profession. This is go'ing’to explode
some day!” ,

‘ 2 Hazards of uranium nr'iining'

_ Uranium miners face extremely

. serious..health hazards, according» to in-

formation contained in an article in

/the~ March issue of Occupational

Health, a publication of the U. ._S. Pub-
lic Health Service.-

The" article “Uranium Mining and
Milling, A.Cwr'rent Study’? reports on
a 1950 study make in mines and mills
in the"Colorado Plateau area.

It has been known for centuries,-, says
the- article, that uranium minersin the-
Ertz mines ofABohemia. and Saxony die
in the primeof life with lung,__can‘cer.

Doctors and scientists have disagreed
as to what particular agent causes
these. cancers. Cobalt, nickel, a'ndqar-
sonic in the ores have been variously
regarded as. the main, cause-.’,, Others.
have attributed the’ cancers to-the ac-
tionrof’ radon (a»=gas)awhich is inhaled

CINTA MEXICANA DEFENDIDLA

Travis contesta calumnias
contra 'So| de la «Tierra'

DENVER—Maurice Travis, Secretario—Tésorero de la Union Inter-
nacional de .Trabajadores en Minas, Molinos y Fundiciones, enviara la
«semana pasada una carta a todas las‘ 10081198 Ilegando de 1313110 108
reportes circulados por los periédicos y por las radio difusoras acerc'a

de la pelicula “Sal de la Tierra.”

“Nivun flaco “dime” del dineroaée nuestra union se esta invirtiendo
en la produccion,” dijo Travis, “Ni un centavo de nuestras cuotas sindi-

cales, ninguna ayuda financiem, nin-
guna inversion monetaria se esta ha-
ciendo en la pelicula por nuestra
union.”
Travis dijo que la cinta se esti pro-
duciendo por una ‘compaﬁia filmica,
“cuyo presidente es el dueﬁo _d'e una
cadena de teatros en Los Angeles, y
que segun mis mejores_conocimientos
iamas en su vidase le ha acusado de
‘rojo.’ V
“Nuestra union esta patrocinando la
pelicula y se le designa como productora
I de lavpelicula porque, en parte, ésta
sebasa en la historia de nuestra union.
Nuestros miembros estén desempeii-
ando todos los papeles centrales menos
uno,” el aﬁadio. “Autorizamos el uso
de nuestra union como padrino de
la policula porque creimos que ha
llegado el momento en‘ que el pueblo
norteamericano debe tener la opor-
tunidad de ver algo mas que a Hopa-
long Cassidy y musicales en tecnicolor."

La historia de la pelicula. es acerca
“de un hombre y su esposa, ambos do
quienes participaron en la huelga de
nuestra local en Bayard contra la
Cia. Empire Zinc,” Travis explicé en su
carta.

“El tema. central de la historia so ‘

concentra en trazar las dificultades

' que le liacen frente a la esposa de un

huelguista, primero en resolver los
problemas domésticos mientras su es-

poso esta en huelga, y segundo, en

tratar dc desenvolver un papel propio _

para que pueda contribuir igualmente a
la lucha en que su esposo esta en-
vuelto.’_’ A
,“Naturalmente, los motivos por el
ataque sobre la pelicula se basan en
el hecho de que la Cia. Empire Zinc no
quiere que el mundo sepa que sus ma-
yordomos y sus agentes saciaron su

odio ‘sadistico’ en los hombres, las mu-

jeres y los-niﬁos, la mayoria de los
cuales son de origen mexicano, quienes
peleaban por _su pan y mantequilla,-”
él nﬁaclio.

“Los dirigentes de nuestra unioﬁ
estan orgullozos de lo que se esta ha-
ciendo con la pelicula. Sentimos que la
produccién‘ final seri una obra magni-
ficaldel punto de vista de informar al
mundo Vcomo nuestros compaﬁeros y
compineras Mexico-Americanos y_ An-
glos trabaiaron y lucllaron iuntos; wmo
nuestra union salio triunfante de una
lucha larga contrapuna de las com-
panies man" viciooamente anti-obi-eras
en America, la compaﬁia que se alaba
porque ninguna unién. jamés ha ganado
un huelga ‘ contra ella."

" “La cinta esta casi terminada, y so
estrenara dentro do tres moses. Sugar-
imos que cada _uno de sus miembroa la
vean para que ellos juzgen la done do
pelicula que es."

Anto "union reiects °‘nei'w~’, BLS index '0

The UAW’-CIOI last week turned

down an __offer by General Motors to,

revise their existing c'_ont1;a_ct- on the

basis of the ‘.‘new” Bureau of Labor

Statistics index "of consumer prices.
The“ contract runs’to May 29, I955.

UAW has sought to renegotiate the con- ' I

tract because the .“old” BLS index, to 7

which wages were tied, is being dis-

continued by.the Bureau. In an,effort’

to cut the groundfrom under the- un-

ion’s position, . President Eisenhower‘

ordered the BLS_to continue the old in-

dex through June 1953.‘ Since price data‘

for“.th'e old index for January 15 was
notgathe-red by the -Bureau, the union

_ has stated. that any revived “old” index

-would be based on guesswork and “es- '

timates” andwill therefore not‘ be ac-

cepted as a- basis for wage adjustments. '
The’ “new” index, out on ‘February’

27, would have cut auto _worker’s pay

by a ‘cent’ an hour. However, GM has 7
'agreed to leave wages unchanged until

the index problem is settled.
-As bait for a changeover . to. the

merit issued "by the union, offered to
‘freeze 14 cents of the 25 cents an .hour
so far gained in cost-of-living adjust-
ments into the permanent base pay.
