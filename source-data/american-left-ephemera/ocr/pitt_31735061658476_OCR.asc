SENSATIONAL PUBLICITY accompanying the current
hearings of the Senate Committee on racketeering
headed by Senator McClellan has created widesp-read
expectation among some union members and the
public generally that the Senate body may help to
cleanse the unions of corruption.

The history of many similar public probes over the
years, the very nature of the general racketeering
scourge that blankets America today and experience
with the initial stage of the current investigation,
should. disillusion those who place great hopes in

' he hearings.

The most effective and sweeping of such hearings,
by a Senate Committee headed by Senator Kefauver in
1951, has clearly proved that racketeering, mob rule
and various illicit operations that affect our urban
centersare not inherent in the labor movement. The
Kefauver Committee showed how these vast crime
syndicates impose their mobster-enforced inﬂuences on
business, governments, politicians and various organi-
zations.

Such racketeering inﬂuences as exist in trade unions

-—and they unquestionably‘l.o—are an alien growth
fostered within it. The roots of this cancer are in
capitalist society—a society that tolerates as part of
its routine, the degenerative, illicit and crooked forms
upon which racketeering is based. And it is a society
in which the distinction between “legal” and illegal
forms of making proﬁts and acquiring control of prop-
erty or markets is in many cases hardly to be recog-
nized.

As labor leader James Carey rightly observed in a
speech before the Pennsylvania CI-O Convention, there
are many “unethical” practices that are “legal” in our
society in general, but are a crime within the labor
movement. That holds especially for the various forms
of racketeering in union welfare funds and the schemes
related to the investment of these funds.

The racketeering probes cannot be relied upon by
the labor movement to do much because. in the ﬁrst
place, they do not go into the fundamentals of the
racketeering evil nor its roots in the capitalist system.
In the second place, most of these hearings, as in the
current case, are mainly sponsored and used by those
who, as the Textile Workers Union of America said,
are more interested in “a dead” labor movement than
a “clean one.”

Hardly had the ﬁrst week of the McClellan hearings
passed t-han members of the committee and well-known
foes of labor generally, raised the cry for new anti-
labor laws and for a renewed effort to obtain enact-
ment of “right-to-scab” laws in the major industrial
states, as had already happened in Indiana, and for
restriction of political activity by labor.

How can anyone in labor or any well-‘intentioned
person expect a constructive objective from Senators
McCarthy, Mundt and Goldwater, members’ of the
committee and outstanding foes of labor and witch-
hunters who have shouted the loudest for scrapping of
the Bill of Rights and the rights of unions to engage in
political action? How can good intentions be expected
from men like Senators McClellan and Erwin, two

members of the committee of eight, both upholders of
segregation, opponents of the Supreme Court’s ruling
and from states that have “right-to-scab” laws?

Have the latter two Senators demonstrated aversion
to the most dangerous ra-cket of all—the White Citi-
zens Council gangsters and segregationists, now a
widespread scourge?

Only two men on the Committee, Senators Pat
McNamara and john Kennedy, both Democrats, have
had labor’s support.

The Wall Street joumal, vievwing matters realisti-
cally, observes that there is growing talk on Capitol
Hill for legislation to put unions under anti-trust
laws (to prohibit industry-wide collective bargaining)
and for even more stringent restraints on the consti-
tutional rights of unions to engage in political activity.
And, of course, big business expects a few more indus-
trial states to join Indiana with “right-to-scab laws.

The National Association of Manufacturers and
U. S. Chamber of Commerce are pressing a nation-wide
campaign to make the most of the anti-labor publicity
to obtain passage of just the type of anti-union laws
the Wall Street jomrnal anticipates. Moreover, the foes
of labor expect the smear of the entire labor movement
that comes with the committee’s hearings, to reduce
substantially the effectiveness of labor and its allies in
the fight for needed people’s legislation, like improved
minimum wages, more public housing construction,
more school construction, repeal of anti-labor laws, a
civil rights and a people’s tax program. Unfortunately,
the hearings have already had some effect in diverting
the trade unions from the real issues now before Con-
gress and some state legislatures.

Thus, the primary and overriding fact that every
trade unionist and others constructively-minded
should recognize, is that behind the Senate hearings is
anti-unionism! It should be fully exposed for what it
is to all members of unions and the American people
as a whole.

=Il= # it

Having said the above of -the committee, its compo-

f

sition and hearings, do we close our eyes to the racket-
eering menace within the unions; the evidence of
strong—arm rule in some places and the widespread
“legal,” but clearly unethical, practices by union
standards? By no means!

The Communists are not strangers to the struggle
against racketeering. During the thirties it was the
Communists, jointly with others in the Left rank and
ﬁle movements -of numerous unions who successfully
drove out corrupt, gangster-backed leaders.

The examples of such anti-racketeering united fronts
led by Communists in unions of the fur, hotel and
restaurant, painters and maritime unions, are to this
day models of the way to ﬁght and clean out racket-
eers in the labor movement. The job was done pri-
marily by the workers of the industries themselves
and those unions remain substantially racket-free to
this day. The facts of history should effectively refute
those in the labor movement who, apparently more
fearful of “-Communists” than the racketeers, shout
for a struggle against ‘Communism and racketeers as
“twin evils.”

The effectiveness of labor’s effort to beat back the
designs of its enemies through the Senate hearings,
will depend on the extent to which the leaders and
rank and ﬁle themselves undertake to- clean out the
racketeers from their midst. That is the only real
alternative to the “remedies” advanced by the foes
of labor. »

Among the major reasons for the welcome of the
AFLJCIO merger among workers generally was the
wide belief that the inﬂuence of the C10 unions, to-
gether with that of some of the former more demo-
cratically-run unions, would be a strong enough force
to meet the racketeering menace and to defeat the
leaders whose unions are racket-infested and most
bureaucratically controlled. T-he pressure for such
cleanup has, indeed, been growing. Some of the lead-
ers of the merged labor movement, notably Walter
Reuther, Jacob Potofsky, James Carey and others have
been outspoken for action.

The racketeering int‘ nces, while affecting unions
with a minority of the organized workers, should not
be underestimated. The operations of the Becks and
the Brewsters and Hoﬂfas are a clear demonstration of
what happens in unions where a bureaucracy holds

unchallenged and unrestricted control.

The basic antidote to racketeering and the wide-
sp-read “unethical” practices in the labor movement,
is elimination of bureaucracy and the establishment of
full democracy within the union and rank and ﬁle
control over its policies as well as ﬁnances. And no
less important is the fact that if the racketeering collu-
sion between employers and some union officials at
the expense of the workers is to be wiped out, so must
collaboration between employers and unions be wiped
out as a policy. Class-collaboration “business union-
ism” is at the base of much of the “unethical” col-
laboration.

No thoughtful person can expect a committee
dominated by McCarthy, Mundt, Goldwater, Mc-
Clellan and Erwin to contribute toward a positive
and basic treatment of the problem. But every honest
labor leader can help through arousing the rank and
ﬁle on the issue and encouraging it to organize
through democratic forms and procedures the control
and vigilance needed to keep the labor movement
clean. The response of 10,000 workers to a demonstra-
tion before the Indiana State House to protest enact-
ment of the “right-to-scab” law was evidence that the
workers are willing to ﬁght. Only they were called
too late.

The members everywhere will ﬁght because they
know racketeering lives on job-selling and, therefore,
job discrimination; it lives on selling out the interests
of the workers to employers for a price to the corrupt
ofﬁcials; it lives on stiﬂing the will of the workers,
by means of gangsters if need be; it lives on allying
‘the labor movement to the most corrupt inﬂuences
and politicians in society and undermining its influ-

 

 

 

 

ence as a progressive force. The ﬁght must be put into
the hands of the membership.

It should be equally clear, however, that expulsion
of unions infested with racketeers is, as the textile
union said, “a cure that is worse than the disease."
The AFL-CIO has a responsibility to the many hun-
dreds of thousands of members in the unions inﬂu-
enced by racketeers. Those members expect help
to rid their unions of racketeers, not to help the un-
ionbusters who want to see the labor movement split
and weakened. They want help to the rank and ﬁle in
their efforts to clean out racketeering and to enhance
inner union democracy.

And just as many unions justiﬁably express alarm
lest expulsion of a union like the Teamsters’ be one
of the consequences, there is growing concern over
the AFL~CIO council’s decision to cooperate with
the McClellan -Committee—and do so even at the price
of barring the use of the Fifth Amendment by union
ofﬁcers. A number of unions expressed alarm over this
policy of retreat. The Pattern Makers’ League, an old-
established former AFL union, for example, warned
that labor lived for 100 years by grace of just the
Bill of Rights and should be the last to agree to
scrapping any part of it or rely on the Senate com-
mittee to do the job for labor.

Bowing to the anti—1abor drive and the Senate
hearings that spearhead it; expulsions that weaken
and divide labor; casting overboard t-he Bill of Rights,
long 1abor’s protective armor;——this is not the way to
meet the racketeering issue. A twin drive by labor,
based primarily on arousing and mobilizing the rank
and ﬁle itself to clean up the unions and an all-out
counter-drive on the legislative front, can meet the
problem. i
