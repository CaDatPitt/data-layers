Sales Tax is ROBBERY!

MASS ACTION WILL
   FORCE ITS REPEAL!

Every week the sales tax cuts from your wages from seventy cents
to a dollar. For those receiving a miserable cash relief pittance,
it means stealing bread out of your mouth. The poorer you are

percent tax. The sales tax means the rich are taxing the poor!

The Sales Tax Was Not Necessary!

The sales tax was passed on the plea that there was no money
to take care of relief and maintain the schools. But right after
the mass misery tax was passed, the Federal Government gave the
millionaires of Ohio twenty million dollars in tax refunds! And yet
these same millionaires owe the state of Ohio millions in back taxes,
which, is responsible for the tax crisis! In Cleveland alone, ac-
cording to figures published in the Cleveland Press, the Van Swer-
ingen railroad magnets and real estate operators, J. P. Morgan's
local agents, owe a million dollars in back taxes. The full list
printed in the Press shows that seven or eight corporations and
individual capitalists alone owe over ten million dollars in back
taxes! Why didn’t the corporation Governor White and the util-
ities controlled legislature collect these millions in back taxes in-
stead of stealing the miserable pennies of the poor by means of
the sales tax?

The Bankers Take the Money

The fact is most of the tax money goes back to the bankers in
interest on bonds and only a small part is left for other purposes.
Sixty three cents out of every tax dollar is paid out in interest to
these very bankers who owe millions in back taxes. Although
they refuse to pay their back taxes, they demand full service on the
bonded indebtedness which in 1933 amounted to $124,747,380 for
the whole state of Ohio! The fact is the sales tax was passed to
protect the profits of_these financial lords and force the under-

 paidlworkersp and em loyees to supply the relief funds and main-

the utilities, corporatibns and banks to shift the burden of taxes
onto the masses, just asl they have ‘made us bear the entire burden
of the crisis by cuttinglwages and relief, foreclosing on_ our homes
and stealing our life’: saving by closing down the banks. When
ex-Governor White, former corporation lawyer and leader in Roose-
velt’s Democratic party, put over his 10..mill real estate tax amend-
ment he saved the utilities and real estate sharks $45,000,000, but
the same Governor White who reduced the tax revenues by
this amount, forced through the sales tax on the small home owners,
workers, employees and poor people on the plea that the state was?
short $60,000,000 to take care of the needy and the schools! The
same ex- Governor White, with the personal help of the present
Gov. Davey who in turn received the moral support of President
Roosevelt, fought tooth and nail against any serious income tax“
on the rich capitalist!
the capitalist state.

This is what the workers can expect frevmu

160 years ago, King George of England set up the Stamp Act
without the consent of the American Colonies. The aroused colo-
nists met this oppression by organized, militant action. They
dumped a cargo of taxed tea into Boston harbor, setting an Ameri-
can tradition of militant action against tax oppression. Today,
the capitalists of Ohio have forced their own Stamp Act on the
poor people of our state. Our only recourse is to follow the ex-
ample of the fathers of our country!

The Communist Party supports and actively fights for higher re-
lief, for veterans relief, for free hospital and medical service for
the poor, for employment and social insurance—but. at the ex-

pense of the rich and not by further reducing the living standards 

of the masses.
