A vigil and a meeting before the Fed-
eral Court House in Foley Square, New York,
on Thursday afternoon, October 28th, had to
be suspended before Thomas Cornell and
Marc Paul Edelman were able to burn their
draft cards as they had planned. As the press
reported, at the time when such persons as
Dorothy Day and A. J. Muste, along with
Cornell and Edelman, were ready to speak
brieﬂy in explanation of the act about to be
performed, the congestion of photographers
and reporters from an unexpectedly large
number of papers, news agencies and other
mass media was such that the draft cards
could not be burned without probable injury
to persons, and certainly not in the atmos-
phere of calm and dignity appropriate to an
action motivated by deep conscientious con-
viction and concern for human life.

RESUMED MEETING

The suspended meeting will be resumed at
noon on Saturday, November 6th, at the north
end of Union Square at Seventeenth Street. It
will last for 2 — 3 hours depending on the time
needed to carry out a brief program. In ad-
dition to Thomas Cornell, former teacher,
and Marc Paul Edelman, cabinet maker, who
had announced on October 28th their firm de-
termination to proceed with draft card burn-
ing in public at the earliest moment when
appropriate arrangements could be made,
David McReynolds, writer and peace organi-
zation staff member, and Roy Lisker, a Chel-
sea resident, novelist and University of Penn-
sylvania graduate, have declared their inten-
tion to burn their draft cards at the November
6th meeting.

SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS

The meeting and program on November 6th
are supported, in line with their historic
policy, by the Catholic Worker, the Commit-
tee for Nonviolent Action, the War Resisters
League and the New York Workshop in Non-
violence.

 

PRINCIPLE

The principle of the November 6th meeting is
that of support for conscientious objection to
war, whether it be on religious or other
grounds and whether the individual has ar-
rived at the traditional position of conscien-
tious objection to all war or is a conscientious
objector to any participation in the war now
being carried on by the United States in Viet-
nam. The individuals and organizations Sup-
porting the November 6th meeting are also
committed to nonviolence in their conduct at
this meeting—as at all meetings in which they
are involved.

CALL

We urge the widest possible attendance at the
Union Square meeting, especially of all those
who morally support the purpose of the meet-
ing and the action contemplated by the young
men. We heartily welcome also the atten-
dance of all persons who may not agree with
the basic principle of the meeting and may
not approve the act of draft card burning, but
who wish to uphold the right of dissent, even
in war time, as a service to a democratic
society and to condemn any policy of repres-
sion of dissent and protest as betrayal of
democratic life.

DISCIPLINE

As long as they are available, copies of the
Discipline for Peace Demonstrations, used
in recent years by a group of peace organi-
zations in New'York City, will be sent along
with this Call to give a more detailed idea as
to what the sponsors of the November 6th
meeting mean by nonviolent conduct. A button
bearing the words PRACTICE NONVIO LE NC E
will be enclosed—as well as available at the
headquarters of the November 6th meeting.
Wearing this device will serve to distinguish
those who receive this Call, and who in gen-
eral support the meeting, from the general
public, and will, we trust, help to maintain
an orderly situation throughout this occasion
whichthe main participants approach not in a
frivolous or provocative but in a serious and

reconciling spirit.

All citizens who wish are invited to attend
however they may dissent from the purposes
of this meeting of the views that may be pre-
sented. It is our hope and expectation that
the behavior of such persons will be orderly
and expressive of their own recognition of
how democratic life in this country may best
be maintained and strengthened.

SLOGANS

Slogans in conformity to the principles above
stated and the convictions of the draft card
burners will be provided by the Planning
Committee. We assume that no other slogans
will be displayed since it will be recognized
that this is a meeting called for a definite
purpose and that the act on which it is focussed
is aserious one—the meaning of which should
not in any way be obscured.

PLANS

The Planning Committee and those already
committed to draft card burning are prepared
to confer with others who may contemplate
burning their draft cards on November 6th.

The" Planning Committee has assurances from
the Park Department that a permit for the
meeting will be issued, and from the Police
Department that the necessary permit for
sound apparatus will be issued. One of the
regulations governing the use of city parks
for meetings is that no leaﬂets or fliers may
be passed out in the park area in order to
avoid littering. We expect this regulation will
be observed. Leaﬂets and fliers may be dis-
tributed in the vicinity to all persons, includ-
ing those coming to or leaving the meeting.
