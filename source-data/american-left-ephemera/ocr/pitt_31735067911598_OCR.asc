3 The Board. which had recessed its

conference, agreed that the entire union

 .j_'must be mobilized quicklyto join the

fight against anti-labor changes pro-

‘ gnewed demand ,for complete repeal, and '
y by a ‘strong stand against proposals to

bar industry-wide bargaining. p

for your good wishes and for "the ‘fact
that you took" the time in your busy

ismaking progress; He can now move‘

‘hope he may be able to use his whole _‘

take quite awhile because ‘the, nerves
 __ in those two fingers have been dam-
‘gr ‘ » aged the worst. It is his leftliand.‘
You have no idea how badly he felt‘
when this happenedjtos, him. He still

_’ worries about the two paralyzed fin-T

gers, but if he follows the doctor’s in-
structions and exercises his hand the
way they showedhim in the hospital,
we hope everything will turn out right
’ in time. _ ' '
_ The doctor told him he must not
worry about anything, but as you know,
. the thing that does Worry him most is
still hanging over his head like a dark

Iv.

Many hard problems face not only Mine-Mill but the whole Ameri-
ican labor movement this year. .When Eisenhower moved into the
White House, an era ended, another began.‘ Thechange meant new
problems,» but with it also came new opportunities. .,

It was against this background that our Interna-
tional Executive Board called -for ‘a general conference
of our entire U. S. ‘International staff.

We spent ‘a full week in”"Denver early this month,
takinﬁﬂa fresh looklat our ,un'ion’s.policies and pro-
grams, re-evaluating, checkingup, drawing inspira-5
tion and infornia_tion from each other. For me it was
one of the most. exciting and stimulating experiences
since I became Pre_s_ident of Mine.-Mill.

It’s no secret to our membership that we have

the finest staff of any union. Working togetlter with all of them for 1
_ a solid ‘five days impressed me withthe generally high‘ caliber of the _

whole stafff._more* than ever‘ before.

   THE STAI§‘F-_...CQNFERENCE,‘* which was preceded .a.ndxfollowe,d"
by several da_ys.gof'.'_Execu‘tive' Board sessions, was a rousing success,

I- think everybody",_agi'eed. It laid‘ the ‘groundworkfor: an expansion
and sti"eng'tl1ening'*_‘_‘0f‘.our whole union. It helped prepare all of us for
any battles " that’-hnay be ahead. , 4   R L

_ ":jSo many ’topi‘cs_wei'e coveredthat it’s impossible for me to men-
tion them all here. But I’d like. to touch on -.a few .points that seemed

most important to the -entire Staff. .  —
it ., ' - e .- * *, at

\

 Was,_ta1k»of I953 bargaining,’of course. Our‘Union’s bar-

gaining pro"grai_n' for this year‘is scheduled for discussion at the Min-

’ ing, Smelting &;?Ref_i-ning and National Wage Policy’-conferences late_

in"March. Butlthe" Staff members wanted to report on h_ow‘.‘the work-
ers.--feel, and they:-did. ‘ "

 From these reports it’s clear that the need—and the demand— '

fora wage increa.,se.in_ 1953 is gaining momentum among our members

all over the Union. Thatfeeling, by the way, is echoed by the. decla-' ‘

ration by the ‘AFL Executive Council recently that wage increases

are needed for millions of workers‘ this year if a “sharp and destruc-

tivef’ depression is to" be prevented.“   ' ‘

_ Staff members reported that there is also a strong demand for

better pensions and betterliealth and welfare programs. ~ ‘
PRESIDENT EISENHOW-.ER’S.-order ending the wagefreeze will

' mean a stiffening of company -resistance to wage increase and to
pension and health-"welfare improvements, _we agreed. But at the same
 time, we noted that the final _junldng of price controls and the general

orsening of eCOn0IIllC'COndii}lOlT1S will make wagegincreases even more
urgently necessary than last ‘year. _ - . '

To win these ggains despite tougher company resistance will mean
closer coordination between and: "within our bargaining councils.‘ It

. will require ‘greater ,milit‘ancy,,bctter. and -earlier mobilization. And it

will depend‘ on the.-greatest 'pojs§ible'_~,=—nn_ity Ewithj gcontmunity organiza-

A tions and other unions,‘especia‘lly; those in,ou'if:findustry.

-. The_possibilityv of ion the labor lmoveinent by the

headline—seeki'ng -Congressionalﬁcommittees came‘ in for a lot of dis-

cussion. We Icouldalready. seezfthat gthe attack..on civil rights was ‘

being stepped up’; ' “    . I . — p _ g ..
' The patriotism of 10 million Americans is now ‘under direct‘ sus-
picion as the result of loyalty legislation and investigations, we

-noted. Suspicion igis. fnot-‘only di’rected.at' members of labor unions, but
_ also at tenants of federally-financed housing, teachers, professors, _ ’
anyone who applies for a passport, anyone whohas ever been a mem- .
ber of one of the hundredsof organizations on the so-called~.Attorney- 

General’s list, "anyone who was born abroad. — ’ ’.

. ‘As we talked, we found that the fight for civil and minority _
rig‘-htscannot be separated from the fight for wages and a better ,

life; -Andso We agreed we mustrenew and_inte_nsify our search for

.other"unions and groups Wl1ich~wi1l‘uniteiwith‘-us in the twin strug- A‘

I

gle for Welfare and rights. - -

RUNNING THROUGH this confeirence, as through every national ‘ I

Mine-Mill gathering, was the tremendous sense of strengtli‘that our
union draws from those of its members who belong to minorityigroups.
Both the Staff and the Executive Board checkedup on the

progress of the organizing campaign initiated‘by our Mine-Mill "con- 3

vention last September. There is much to be done, both in the,U. S.

and Canada. This year should Show the "effects of the rplanswe laid \,

last fall. _ X

The fight for safety in the mines got heavy emphasis. In the In-
ternational Union, our Research Department‘ has been laying the
groundwork by collecting material to be used for preparation at‘ :3.-
Mine Safetybill  Congress. The shocking death and accident toll in ‘
- our industry makes it In-andatory that We move quickly toward get-

VANCOUVER, B. C.-—'—British Co-

apparently hav.i1ig” an enjoyable ‘time
‘at its;first"se‘§sion _by simply_ thumbing
_ its nose at the.CCF (Cooperative Com-
monwealth Federation) opposition, and,
daring them to risk another election.’ '
1 -Social- Credit has nineteen(seats, in-
"cluding the speaker, the CCF 18,‘ with
Tom Uphill,’ vete'ra»n Labor member and
'1 six" Liberals and ‘two Conservatives
making up the present, house of 46.
' Two seats are vacant through deaths.
The government has "taken ‘no ‘ac-
tion on any of the measu1'es"d'esired’ by
labor, such" as .revision_ of the Indus-
trial Arbitration and -Conciliation Act,
amen_dm_ents to the Woz_'kmen’s -Com-‘
pensation Act, and ,other measuresfpro-

‘ THE COALITION claimed before‘ its

Similarly, for a ten per cent reduc-"'7, *

tion in staff; all workers could‘ take:
one week in ten off. . '  ’
This, the plan stresses, wouldresult
in much» less reduction of the worker’s
incomethan appears on the surface,
since as well as drawing unemploy-\

ment insurance_,'the reduction in_.income‘’ ,
tax would cut his loss considerably, in .

some cases to little more-than’ the

wages of one or two days, with one 1

week off in five. _- : . ._ _
' The release of the locals emphasizes

that although the necessity for such a 7

against $3,703,807 in ’51.o

If this doesn’t make sense, then you
don't understand how our tax system

' operates. ‘

When-..—._a worker doesn't work he
doesn't earn money.~But when a com-
pany_ stops production, as Eagle-Picher
did.when it shut down its San Xavier
smine in'Arizona last August, it can
sometimes make more money than if it
operated the mine.

Here’s how it works:

'~ Under the tax laws, when ‘it com-
pany. in any year doesn't make as much
«money as it once did, the government
returns to the company part of the

0 I

excess profits taxes paid. out in more
prosperous years. 

In 1952, Eagle-Picher made profits
before taxes of $4,323,643. That was
over ‘$5,000,000 less than it made—be-
fore taxesv-in 1951. It paid regular
corporation taxes of $1,608,000 on this

income. Then the government,.in turn,

refunded to the company $820,000 out
of excess profits taxes paid in earlier
years. In addition, they refunded an-
other $500,000 for supposed over-pay-
ments forvtheiyears 1946 to 1949. The
net result was that Eagle-Picher came
out about $330,000 ahead of last year.

The next time you're short of cash,
try asking the government for some of
the taxes you‘ paid in « your more
prosperous -years and see what hop-‘
pens. '

Copper (prices due for increase 1' 0 .

Copper companies are now like the
ne1'vops bridegroom—eagerly awaiting‘
the day.

The day‘will arrive when price con.-

.trols on copper are removed, after
which prices are expectedto jump to

'-_ It "much higher level. .

_ SJ. S."Bache & Co., Wall Street‘ bro-
kers, predicted last ,week that when
price controls are removed, no copper

, will be available “even at’ .'2.9.30c a.

. pound, which at present is the lowest
price in the world. (outside of the

' U. S.).”._,_It is even possible, say these
' brokers, that “the domestic price -ma]!

_ =r=ise.to the same level-a.‘s__the foretign.

' * price, vmmely 36.50 cents a pound de-

Iiue7'e‘d to the Cmmecticut’ Valley.”
“That decontrol of copper is not too

\

far off was indicated last week, when

the Office of Price Stabilization took

the price lid off of copper scrap. 'l‘he

action gave. custom smelters the right

to charge any price they ‘may choose '

for refined copper. if 25% or more of
the refined metal comes from -scrap.
Thoserefineries whose, production is
derived solely from. mine output are
still limited for the present, to 24'/;%

‘ per pound. ,

The decontrol of copper; scrap V also
means that the custom smelters should
now be able to-get all the scrap they_

‘need. Many scrap dealers had been

holding metal off" the market while
waiting for a higher price. 0 .
The price of scrap copper jumped
four cents a pound’ as soon -as the de-

‘  potash production still going up

U. ‘S. potash mines will be producing g

~._Administration. Total production by

» mines will be about 19 per cent greater

than in ~ 1951-52.

A" slight ‘increase in imports from

264,000 tons last year to 275,000 tons
will assure a total _s11pply, after some
allowance for exports, of 1,850,000
tons. 04 '

Potash producers are now having no

PRESENT PLANS éot the Depart-

ment of Agriculture call for an in-
crease in potash supply to about 2,000,-

increase will have to come from do-
mestic mines. . '

The possibility of any great increase \

in imports "from Israel in the near fu-
ture is discounted by Louis Ware,
president of International Mineralsand
Chemicals. Reporting , on a recent
round-the-world trip, in the September-
October issue of “Min and Chem,” a
company publication, Ware says:

“On this “trip I visited the phosphate

They came up with the old standby
\proposal to raise‘ tariffs on imported
‘lead and" zinc. Their. tariff proposal
bore a new dress——itV.was to be‘ a slid- 7

the-price of. lead and zinc went down .

was the fact that the same large com-3 -

These figures on Chilean‘ wages were.-

cited by’ Senator Malone (R) of Nevada
' last week inua long speech made dur-
ing’ the debate on extending the sus--

ate voted to keep the import tax off

T ’ These wage§"_'of about $1.17 per day_
‘compare with an average of about $15
paid copper workers in the U. S_. The
Chilean _wages are paid by Anaconda
and Kennecott, which ‘own and operate
the major properties in th‘a-t’ country.
These low wages explain, for example,
why Anaconda makes almost two and
a half times as much‘ profit on for-
reign labor as it does on U. S. labor.

WASHINGTON, D. V C.-U. -S. Dis-
trict ‘Judge F. Dickinson‘ Letts_has is--
sued an order telling-the NLRB to

. ‘stop trying to pry into the private af-
‘lfairs of union leaders.  
The NLRB had de‘mai1ded that cer-
- tain unions‘ file affidavits beyond, the
requiremeiits of Section 9-H, the affi-
davitprovision of the Taft-Hartley law.
Here’s the story:.‘ “  V ‘
Involved were three union]__s-—United
‘Electrical Radio & Mac-hine“Workers,
Ainerican Communications Association,

7 and‘ Int’l Fur & Leather ‘Workers. All

" three unions had fully complied with
T-H requirements, and the ‘NLRB had
acknowledged their compliance.

SEVERAL OFFICERS of these
unions were called before a New York

V grand jury and asked about the truth

 or falsity of the affidavits they had

1 ' ‘filed. The officers refused to answer

"such ‘questions. ' V ' ‘

The grand jury found no evidence.

. 1

Two bills that are on the side’ of the
working man have been introduced in
..the new Congress. They are in sharp
contrast to the flood of anti-labor bills
‘pouring‘‘ into the hopper almost daily in
both chambers.
. 4 ‘ One measure was introudced by a
‘ . group of Senators led by James Mur-
ray of Montana, to provide penalties of
‘ $5,000 fines and two year’s‘in prison

‘ - include»Mathew Neely of W. Virginia
and Wayne Morse of Oregon. ‘
, Murray pointed outlthat the Taft-,»
Hartley Act is supposed to make labor
spying an unfairlabor practice. but
“we have found that this alone is not
a_ sufficient deterrent.” And Murray
added that “widespread evidences of
labor espionage” have been found! by

“Senator Labor Committee investigators.

; ‘views, the new law does not’ change
.the terms of eligibility for -aliens to

one improvement in that the filing of

-a citizen is no_ longer rquired. This
‘   eliminates the 2-year, waiting period
 _"‘~;between the declaration of intention
C and a petition for naturalization. The
new political restrictions on naturali-
zation are essentially the same as those
used as grounds for deportation.

‘Registration Requirements

\ 'All non-citizens 14 years and over
7 must register and be fingerprinted.
Each non-citizen resident 18 years and
over must carry his registration card

can result in a $100 fine or 30 days
in prison. During Januaryof each year
all non-citizens must give the attorney

wife who obtains her.- citizenship from
the naturalization of her husband and
the minor child who derives citizenship

citizenship is lostwhere the citizenship
of such parent or spouse is canceled
because of: (1) Membership after nat-
uralization in a politically prosc_ribed

‘organization. .(2) Establishing ‘a for,-0

eign residence. (3) Dishonorable dis-
charge from the army. '

-Limits on Immigration

The law permits, about 150,000 im- --
migrants each year. C_ontin_ued‘ quota‘

restrictions discriminate against col-
ored people, Asians generally and im-
migrants ‘from southern and eastern
Europe. A special anti-Neglro provision
is aimed at immigration from Jamaica.

In addition, the attorney’ general or
consular officercan bar [any alien who

'there*is “reasoneto believe seeks to

enter the U.S. . . . to engage in activi-
ties which would be prejudicial‘ to ‘the

public interest, or endanger the wel-

fare, safety or». security of the U.S.”
The attorney general or. consular of-

ficer can excludeany alien allegedly

having leftwing or radical political

beliefs. While the law denies -entrylto '

anyone-_ affiliated with the Communist

.-party, i; does not -bar Nazis, fnscists

or Falangists.

Aliens can also. be refused entry if
the attorney generalor consular offi-

cer “has reasonable ground to believe” '

they “prbbablywould after entry” join
or participate in the activities of any
organization branded subversive under
the 1950 McCarran law. /

What Lincoln said

If Abraham Lincoln were alive today,
what would he think about the ‘McCar-

found in this famous Lincoln quotation:

“Inasmuch as’ our country is exten-

A iitisinlgxin. the Sun. .
I‘; j‘-Miss Furer’s testimony was expected
I to .-directly tie in McCarran’,with the'
;_gambling bosses, and to establish the
:fact that Hicks had called_ the meeting‘.
 of hotel operators that, according to
_ 5 GréenSpu11’§ chargés, conspired to can-
‘-‘/,cel_their advertisinggwith the Sun.

.‘ A

 . suit out of court .  

By Special Correspondent
LAS VEGAS, Nev.——The $225.-

_'000 Sherman Anti-Trust Act

gdamage suit against _U. S. Sena-
-tor Pat McCarran and20 gambl-

ing casino operators has been
'settled out of court. .

Federal Judge Roger FoleyMdis-

missed the case after learning,
V_*that the settlement had been
' -reached between attorneys for

“ plaintiff Hank Greenspu‘n'; pub-
lisher of the'Las Vegas Sun, and

. fdefense attorneys. i

 0 Last actual cash offer of settle-
ment admitted by Greenspun was

 $86,000, but it. is generally‘ be- '
lieved that the. final settlement’
came to $100,000. McCarran im-

. mediately issued a statement that

he wasn’t going to have to pay a

cent of thejsettlement. Las Vegas ‘ -
. residents commented that‘.this

was no news to them—the gambl-

 ‘ ing and hotel-operators will pay

hisshare of the settlement, just
asthey. furnish free room and

' «board and campaign headquarters

‘for “the old man.”-
' The Sunjs columns had frequently

‘exposed McCarran’s activities. Green-

spun‘ charged,» in his suit, that McCar-
ran had teleplfoned orders from Wash-
ington .-to Las Vegas gambling bosses
tocancel all advertising in the Sun be-

 -S. . cause of its attacks"on him.

THE SETTLEMENT prevented the

ﬁcourt from hearing evidence which was

‘expected to directly tie McCarran in
_-with gambling and criminal interests—
much as the Kefauvér Committee re-

I a port did. i .

.It came soon_after a “mystery” wit-

 ness was brought into the case. She

‘was Charlotte Furer,_who had worked
.;in the office of Thunderbird Hotel
Efmanagcr‘ Marion Hicks at the time
’ fMcC,arran was accused of orderingthe

cancellation of gambling house adver-

 

Miss Furer was prepared to" testify,-
Jshetold this reporter, that Hicks had
prdered. her to telephone his personal

‘lassistant Patricia‘Fapst, and. tell Miss -
“Faust to "call the‘. hotel and gambling

operators to the meeting.

_ SHE WAS ALSO‘prepared to-"testify
that there had been nearly 10 telephone
"calls from Washington to Hicks during
the few days before the mass cancella-
tion~'of advertising took place. I ‘

stand. During this period, attorneys
for defense and plaintiff reached «the
agreement that ended the trial.

Miss Furer was never allowed to
testify.

Another plaintiff's witness, Las

/Vegas Mayor C. D. Baker, was also

expected to pin McCarran’s ears back.
He was to have followed Miss Furer
to the stand. In an earlier court ac-
tion, Baker testified that one of the
gambling house operatorstold him the
withdrawal
Sun had been on orders “from Wash-
ington.” ., ,
General reaction among Las Vegas
.working people was that the settle-
ment was a victory, for Greenspun. Re-
fusal of the defendants to allow Miss

of advertising from the

Mccarran euu ;lamage7 

Furer and Mayor Baker to testify was,

seen as admissibn that there were

grounds for the charges against Mc-

' Carran and the gamblers.

Greenspun is the first publisher to

"take a stand against McCarran‘ who

has succeeded.’ Other Nevada papers

that criticized the Senator’s control of

the state buckled
forces tackled them}. .
THE NEVADA State Labor News
was “unkind”'toMcCar1'an, and Editor
Denver Dickerson no longer received
advertising of the Reno gamblers and
hotel owners. When Dickerson stopped

after McCarran

pot-shooting at the Senatorpthe ad-‘I

vertising returned.
In the immediate Las Vegas area,
Morrie Zenoff and his Henderson News

and Boulder City News w.ere..at one’

time very critical of McCarrarfcZenoff
started a flourishing little newspaper
at a nearby base. He suddenly found
that he was unable to publish and dis-
tribute the new paper.

After Zenoff learned the error of
-his ways, he "not only stopped sniping
at McCarran,_ but ran a front-page
editorial praising the senator. He was,

* rewarded, according to ‘a «Las Vegan

who shouldknow, by a publicity job
for a federal housing development of
several hundred homes I
$100 per house to him. ,

_CRITICISM of Nevada’s senior sen-
ator brings protests from many differ-
ent lquarters. As the “pappy” of"
legalized gambling in the state, the
gambling interests, the hotel interests
and many other business‘ interests are
quickto come to his defense.

The Sun is the only unionized news-
paper plant in the area, and was origin-
ally started by the Int’l Typographical‘
-Union as the'Free Press. ‘The opposi-
tion paper, the Review Journal, is a

Gables. Era solo para 24 personas. La
tertulia era un hpmenaje. para.el Sr.
Louis Shattuck Gates. el presidente
actual do Phelps Dodge. Asistieron
fa-mybién todos los ex-presidentes y vice-
‘presidentes.

'25.‘-.‘El Sr. Gosnell udijo que se habia

Magitado tanto con esta tertulia que por

V semanas dedico todo su tiempo a las

preparativas, de la‘ misma. Aun com-
puso una pieza dramé.tica para, --la
fiesta. Mandé a construir una mesa de
ochopies de ancho para que los actores

-, pudieran.representar la piesa drama-

tica. en el medio de la mesa.

.“""Les pregunté cuanto querian gastar
en3 la fiesta,’ dijo el  Gosnell. ‘Me
dijeron que no les importaha. Que

querian la fiesta mas grande que jumés

‘ se habia celebrado en Phoenix. Pues,

eso es todo lo que q_ue_ria saber.’
“Entonces el Sr. Gosnell procedio a
ponerle alas a sus sueﬁos.

‘-“Y parece que lo que nutra a Phelps
Dodge es cobre. Y el cobre vie_ne do
una mina abiérta en Morenci, Arizona.
Segﬁn los libros cle guia, entiendo que
Morenci esté situado en una loma tan
escarpada ‘y alta que tienen que subic
la comida en baldes por un sistema do
cadenas. _ '

“Después de que consiguié
truyeran la mesa, yrnando a
Los Angeles platos de cobre.
a un artiste de Arizona para que pin-
tara una enorme pintura de la mina
abierta y la colocé en un marco do
cobre. Cubrié las botellas del vino icon
hoja de cobre. Y se podia coger la
comida con palitas y picas peqiieﬁas
hechas de cobre. Los nombres de los
huesp'edes se grabaron en mineral do
colzre con un lado alisado.

“Creo que el Sr. Gosnell consideré
la idea deremachar setas a los, bifteks
con clavos de cobre tal ‘como se haco
en pantalones "de lona,'pero tuvo qua
abandonar le idea por impractica.

“Sobre la mesa se representé el des-
cubrimiento-- de la mina, los ataques
de los Indios, .bailes, Espaﬁoles, y

For what happened in l947 with the passage of the ’Eaft-I-lartley ,- '-

law was’ not-the incidentaliamending of a basic labor lawbut the.
setting of the stage for a wide attack by Big Business -against labor’s.
rights and the liberties of the people generally. ‘

-IN THIS SEN_SE,"labor cannot
‘.‘amend’’. the Taft-_Hartle.V "law; it
can only repeal it and put our

country back on the path charted

by the Wagner ‘Act.

-Thru the Wagner Act, the gov-
ernment was _to encourage the
growth of unions and collective
bargaining; it was toaid workers
to have unions and representa-

tives of their own free choice; it .

wasito help unions and workers to,
offset the enormous power of gi-
ant corporations. ‘In fact,‘it said

i that because of “the inequality‘ of

bargaining power between em-
ployees who do not » possess full
freedom of ‘association or actual

lib_erty of coxit1'act, ‘and employers‘ "

who are organized in the corpo-
rate or other forms of ownership,
association" the go‘vern‘ment/ihad
the du_ty_ to use the law to restore

.,“equality of bargalining power be- '

tween‘ employers and employees.”

, " THE TAFT~HARTLEY law has -'

reversed all ‘this; It places gov-

ernment in backyof the giant ‘cor- ‘
porations and further widens the - i

inequality ‘of bargaining power
between them and labor—in their
favor. .  .
