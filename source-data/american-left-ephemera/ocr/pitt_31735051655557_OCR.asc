gamblers, or your daughter with the demimond, what
would be your answer? I

You would indignantly refuse. You might say they
have risen above such company. I could reply, if environ-
ments are of slight importance your children could rise
above them at any time, could they not? I then added, had
you, Mr. Preacher, been born in China, of American par-
ents, if you please, but had been adopted by a Chinese family
and reared midst Chinese environments, you today would
be practicing Chinese habits, believing the Chinese faith,
praying to the Chinese joss, in short, you would be a China-
man to all intents and purposes, lacking of course the slant
of his eye, but you would be wearing his queue. His reply can
be imagined, especially when I asked him how a man could
honestly acquire one, much less I00, million dollars.

CHAPTER II.

“ * * * * For if you suffer your people to be ill educated
and their manners corrupted from their infancy, and then pun-
ish them for those crimes to which their education disposed
them, what else is to be concluded from this, but that you first
make them thieves and then punish them?”--SIR THOMAS Moan.

      
   
 

     
   
 
  
  

.'.(:§{' n: 0 conditions, that is environments, have
‘E? 3)‘ anything to do with preventing or increas-

  

((,,’_,« ing crime? When environments change,
 5/ men’s thoughts change, and when their
 thoughts change, their habits change. Is it
3. 55‘ m} not a fact that changed habits result in

' i changed character?

Character is but a series of habits. What could possi-
bly have more inﬂuence on the thoughts, habits and char-
acter of men than the manner by which they must make
their living?

If you listen to the conversations of men you can read-
ily determine their vocation.

The banker will talk of “interest rates, discounts, securi—
ties, deposits and loans.” The railroader talks of “grades,
sidings, signals, brakes, air, steam and engines.” The car-
penter talks of “planes, lumber and roofs.” The farmer
talks of “corn and wheat, hogs and cattle.” The preacher
talks of your precious “souls, salvation and of heaven.”

This will be found to be true of every distinct trade or
calling. Add them all together and you have the business
and social vocabulary of the day.

Just as industries change, so do our thoughts, language

and characters change.

BUCKLE,
in his history of civilization, makes the statement that the
price of food (in its broad sense) and the conditions of

9

 

labor, will in any period or country determine the percent-
age and kind of crimes that will be committed and the num-
ber of divorces that will be granted.

He furnishes a comparative tabulation of facts cover-
ing a period of 100 years, taken from the records of several

-countries to sustain the statement.

Permit me to give you some astounding facts affecting
“Our Country” of equal opportunities ( P). These ﬁgures
tend to prove Buckle’s claim, and I insist they go a long
way toward proving the startling assertion that organized
society is responsible for every crime committed Within its
jurisdiction.

Beginning with the year 1881, when the sails of trusti-
ﬁcation were being ﬁlled with corruptly secured legal
breezes of city, state and national legislation, it had become
apparent to all clear thinking students of economics that the
“era of corruption in high places” that Lincoln foresaw and
warned us against, had really dawned. We ﬁnd that year
to have been an almost distinct period from which to note
the increase in crimes as shown in the table below. George
Allen England compiled it and he quotes what seems to be
unquestioned authorities.

1'N0t completed for the whole year.

Mr. England adds: “Murder is increasing nearly four
10

times as fast as population, suicide three and one-half times
and insanity four times as fast.”

I learn. from census bulletin No. 96 that during the last
20 years divorces aggregated 945,625, an average of 47,285
annually. Sixty-ﬁve thousand were granted during the

year 1908.

The increase in divorces during the last 20 years was
two and one~half times as fast in proportion to marriages
as compared with the 20 years previous. Mr. England says
there are “90,000 men and women behind prison bars in
this ‘land of the free and the home of the brave.’ ”

“Three hundred thousand professional non—productive
crooks whose average getting is $1,500 per year, while the
average wage of the wealth producer is about $445.00."
nearly four times the incentive to steal than to be an hon-
est wage slave. “Ten million people in such poverty as to
be unable to maintain themselves in physical efﬁciency, and
4,000,000 paupers.”

‘‘In 1899 (a so-called prosperous year) 0ne—ﬁfth of all
the people of the state of New York applied for charitable
relief, and in 1903 14% of all the families of Manhattan
were evicted, and every year 10% of all who die have pau-
per funerals.”

“Six billion dollars is spent annually to punish the crim-
inal and vicious classes and to maintain the paupers.” But
not one cent is spent by society to remove the causes that

produce them. »;

“The $6.00o,0o0,000 thus spent is more than is ex-
pended on all the schools, .libraries and benevolent institu-
tions combined. On top bf all this, we have 6,000,000 il-
literates (only one boy or girl out of IO reach high school),
7,000,000 children not in school at all, 500,000 prostitutes,
2,000,000 child slaves, 5,000,000 women competing in the
labor markets with their ‘lords and masters’ (for their
mutual masters in fact) helping to eke out the skimpy ‘fam-
ily dole and from one to ﬁve million workers constantly out
of work.”

Is there not some “far-reaching, insidious force” at
work, permeating every phase of life, when such general

11

and appalling results increase so fast and stare us in the
face and mock those of us who boast of our Christian civi-
lization?

I want you to read over these statements again,
then recall Buckle’s statement relative to the price of food
and the condition of abor, then call to mind the ever—lower-
ing standard of the worker’s life, ﬁrst, because of uncer-
tainty of employment, which of itself tends to an unhealthy
mental state, for it is equivalent to a reduction of wages,
and second, the ever—increasing cost of living, and you will
begin to see why society is responsible for criminals and
their crimes.

All these crimes are in a sense :1 social barometer that
registers society’s industrial and moral health as accurately
as does a thermometer register the temperature of the air
that surrounds it.

I also want you to recall the panics, unemployment,
money stringencies and hard times that have happened since
1881 ; then note how crimes always increased with the con-
tinuation of them, and how they lessen as times improve.

Why are more crimes committed in cold than in warm
Weather? Or during a panic than in good times?

The answer is simple. The struggle to get a living is
more difficult in cold weather and during hard times.

Let me put the case another Way.

Are there not social and industrial as well as individual
crimes? I insist there are, and that individual crimes are
but echoes of the original crimes that society legally com-
mits and permits.

For instance, if society legalizes proﬁt—takii1g, need we
be surprised that there are as many proﬁt-getting schemes
devised and tried as there are individuals who imagine they
can make them succeed? Nor should it seem strange that
these schemes range all the way from legalized Wall Street
gambling in the necessities of life to the white slave tmﬂic.
Proﬁts realized or sought is the object in each case. Society
agrees that proﬁts (per se) are legitimate and good, and so
the incentive is constantly held out to the proﬁt takers, and

12

man’s worst passion, greed, is directly and indirectly fanned
into ﬂame.

You are shocked when the atrocities of the white slave
traffic are revealed. You detest the white slave trafﬁcker, yet
as unspeakably infamous as that commercial transaction is,
the dealers therein are-as “white robed angels” compared
with the men who bribe legislators. Those polute and de-
stroy one or a hundred. These debauch a whole nation.
They set in motion the wheels of corruption. Sow the seeds
of graft and poison the streams of a nation’s life at its very
fountain head and thus make inevitable the harvest of indi-
vidual crimes that appear and appall throughout our indus-
trial and social life.

It is safe to say, says one great writer, “that govern-
ments (society legally expressing itself) have committed far
more crimes than they have prevented.” “Nations have
committed crimes to punish crimes. The world has been
ﬁlled with prisons and dungeons, with chains and whips,
with crosses and gibbets, with thumb-screws and racks, with
hangmen and headsmen, and yet these frightful means and
instrumentalities and crimes have accomplished little for the
safety of property or life.”

He enumerates some of society’s crimes as follows:

Thieves and highwaymen, heretics and blasphemers
were broken on the wheel, their joints dislocated on the rack.
They were suspended by their legs and arms, while immense
weights were placed upon their breasts. Their ﬂesh was
burned and torn with hot irons, they were roasted at slow
ﬁres. ‘They were buried alive, given to wild beasts, molten
lead was poured in their ears, their eyelids were cut off and
the wretches placed with their faces to the sun.

Others were securely bound, so they could move neither
hand nor foot and over their stomachs were placed inverted
bowls under which rats were conﬁned; on top of these bowls
were‘heaped,coals of ﬁre, so that the rats in their efforts to
escape would gnaw into the bowels of the victims.

They were staked out on the sands of the sea, to be
drowned by the slowly rising tide, and every means by
which human nature can be overcome slowly, painfully and
terribly, was conceived and carried into execution.

13

“For petty offences men (and women) were degraded,
given to the mercy of the rabble. Their ears were cut oil‘,
their nostrils slit, their foreheads branded. They were tied
to the tails of carts and ﬂogged from town to town, and yet,
in spite (or because) of it all, the poor wretches obstinately
refused to become good and useful citizens.”

Degradation has been thoroughly tried, with its maim-
ings and brandings, and the result was that those who in-
flicted the punishments became as degraded as their vic-
tims.

_ This is quoted that you may make a comparison
between these legal crimes of society and the illegal ones of
the individual. I challenge you to think of a crime that has
ever been committed by an individual that surpassed some
of those just enumerated either in ferocity or devilish in-
genuity. Society essays to teach its members to do right
and to punish them for doing wrong, then it itself goes to
such extremes of cruelty beyond which the imagination can-
not descend. It is but natural that the examples thus set
will be followed by thousands of men and women according
to their several individualities. They may have been pushed
on by seeming necessity and swayed by passion,- while so-
ciety is supposed to judge cooly and calmly and with equity.

The individual hopes to avenge himself, or gain some

I desired result. In his abnormal mental state, he burns the

soles of his victims’ feet to make them reveal their hidden
wealth. '

He may mutilate, degrade or kill. Society has as far
surpassed his acts as its powers and opportunities were
greater than his.

Crimes were old when he was born. Witches had been
burned to protect ( ?) society. Nations had gone to war for
revenge, and Cortes had roasted Montezuma several hun-
dred years ago to make him reveal where his treasures were,
and in doing so the examples of thousands of years past
were being imitated and emulated.

The individual acts as he does because he cannot help
it. With his brain developed just far enough to practice law
or some other profession, or to work at some trade or dig

14

in_a ditch or sweep the streets, he is apt to take a narrow
personal view of things. Having been taught that the uni-
verse was made for man’s accommodation, that the sun and
moon and all the countless stars that scintillate, light and
heat, were ordered for man, he will most likely do more
wrong than right. He sees things darkly. He needs more
light.

CHAPTER III.
“So long as society bows and cringes to its big thieves,

there will be enough little ones to ﬁll the penitentiaries.”
—-R. G. INGERSOLL,

STEALING.

H! BUT,” I hear you say, “stealing is a crime,
you won’t deny that, will you ?” Are you
sure stealing is a crime? Are you sure as
to what constitutes stealing? Be honest With
yourself. Have you thought of the whole-
sa1e——the big thief, or only of the retail—the
little one? Let us examine the matter. If

I take a loaf of bread from the baker, or a dollar from your

pocket, you will unhesitatingly call me a thief. Why? Be-

cause I take from another something I had no right to take,
something he or you had earned and for which I made no
adequate return. Suppose I break into your house and steal
your jewelry, or into a bank and steal from the vaults some
of the banker’s hard earned ( ?) dollars. That would surely
make me a thief, would it not? Or perhaps I was out of
work and had a family that had reached the verge of starva-
tion, and it had become a question of begging, or stealing, or

letting the family starve. I decide to steal some bread. I

get caught. All the world yells, “thief! thief! away with him

to jail.”

Let us look at the other side. I am a bank president,
let us say. I want banking laws passed in favor of my in-
terests. I bribe legislators and get what I want. What I
gain the people lose. I get rich, but I did not earn
nor give an equivalent for what I got. You don’t call me a
thief in this transaction, but a ﬁnancier. Why?

_ Another man becomes a promoter, organizes a corpora-
tion, sells millions of dollars worth of stock, then re-organ-
izes and squeezes out the little gamblers and becomes a mil-

16

 

lionaire. You don’tcall him a thief, for he acted legally.
Did he give an equivalent for what he got?

Another man, or set of men, get Congress to give them
200,000,000 acres of public land and other valuable conces-
sions. They cause railroads to be built, then by manipulation
the promoters become the owners. This public land be-
longed to you and to me. Did we get paid for our interests
therein? No. Then it was stolen from us, yet these thieves
are called railroad kings.

Another man claims that God went into partnership
with him in coal mining. He proceeds to take from the min-
ers three—fourths of what they produce. Of course we don’t
call him a thief ; no, he is a coal baron. But he takes four or
ﬁve dollars daily from the pockets of thousands of men (or
rather he keeps them from getting that much into their pock-
ets), but if I should take one dollar out I would be a thief
and not a “Baron.” Why? Is it a matter of principle or is
it the degree of the robbery that angers or mystiﬁes you?

Still another set of men own, through similar methods
to those indicated, the steel and iron industry and ex-
ploit from the workers millions of dollars. They are called
captains of industry or philanthropists and are said to be
indispensable to the progress of civilization.

Others adulterate our food, raise it in price, take from
our pockets millions and are called shrewd business men.
You send these big thieves to Congress or to the Senate, and
the little ones to the workhouse or the penitentiary. So
long as you apologize for the stealing of millions by some,
others will continue, per force of example and dire neces-
sity, to steal bread.

THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE.
If the individual has no right to steal, has the state——
society, that right? Has it a right to become a partner in

theft?
AN EXAMPLE.
A man steals ﬁfty dollars and is caught. He is sent to

‘ prison for ﬁve years. The state hires him to a contractor for

ﬁfty cents per day to make shoes or brooms. But the pris-

oner does not get the ﬁfty Qents. The contractor sells the A

17

shoes in competition with union-made shoes. This causes
an attempt to be made to reduce the wages of the union
shoemakers. They strike. If the strike is prolonged some
of the strikers will drift from city to city looking for work.
Word reaches a striker from home that the last cent has
been spent. The baby is ill or has died. Eviction is threat-
ened or has taken place. Imagine the thoughts of the hus-
band and father. What shall he do? He has no money.
So driven by the storms of love and fear, of hope and hate,
of desperation and despair, he steals and is caught. He is
sent to the very prison in which the shoes were made that
helped to force him to commit his crime. He in turn is
hired out to a respectable contractor at ﬁfty cents per day,
which sum will not be paid to him, and for ﬁve years or
more he will be robbed of all he produces. The state helps
steal that much of his life, yet it was an act of robbery that
made him a criminal. He becomes a criminal for stealing,
let us say ﬁfty dollars, yet the state and the contractor steals
ten thousand dollars worth of his labor power; but because
it is legally done you apologize and talk of protecting society.
That is not all. What will become of his wife and family
While he is being thus robbed? Does society take care of
them? What have th.ey done to forfeit their right to live?
They are left dependent and helpless, perhaps to be scorned
because the husband and father the state helped make a
criminal is a convict.

The crime society commits against this family is a thou-
sand times greater than that committed by the husband.
Think of what the wife must feel. She knows she is not to
blame. The children know it is not their fault. She may
be driven to prostitution and the children may imitate the
state’s robbery of their father and turn to theft. If they do,
our moralists and other “goody-goody’s” will say, “like
father, like children,” and will point to them as examples of
individual depravity, and will be the ﬁrst to urge that these
child victims be imprisoned. And, if that is done, they will
thank God that society has protected itself, and go on sup-
porting the system that produces such results.

To the above must be added this further fact. Suppose
the convict does not work as fast as the contractor thinks

18

P

he should. Suppose he does not complete his daily task sat-
isfactorily. Suppose he is found “loaﬁng” on the job, try-
ing to keep back a few moments of his miserable life that
had been bought by an honest, ( P) respected contractor from
the state, and suppose that fact is reported to the oﬂicials
of the prison. The water cure may be applied as in Mounds-
ville, West Virginia, or if in Richmond, Virginia, this “hard-
ened wretch” will be manacled ﬂat on his back on a cement
ﬂoor, arms and legs extended so he cannot move, and there
he will be left for four hours or more as a punishment for
refusing or failing to produce a given amount of proﬁts that
would have been legally stolen from him.

Can barbarity in theft sink much below this, or a more
hideous example of injustice, (which after all is the fruitful
parent of crime) be more complete? Many prisons inﬂict
similar punishments on their convicts. Massachusetts man-
acles their wrists, stretches them upon a “slide” until the
toes just touch the floor, then administer from thirty to sixty
lashes, most of which “draw blood.” Georgia bends its
convicts over a barrel so the skin of the naked back will be
tightly drawn, then applies the lash sixty times. This is done,
mind you, as a “punishment” having for its object, we are
told, the reformation of the robbed victim. This is done, it
is claimed, to make him honest and industrious, virtuous,
charitable and humane. The state is the real criminal.

VV e also ﬁnd the nation in partnership with big thieves
as the following ofﬁcial arrangement unmistakably proves:

“Prominent stockholders and directors of the sugar
trust were in grave danger not long ago; the doors of our
penitentiaries were opening for them. They’ have succeeded,
however, through their control of “the powers that be,” in
bringing about the most delightful arrangement. The at-
torney-general of the United States, until his appointment,
was a sugar trust attorney, familiar with the methods of the
trust, exhibiting even now a remarkable sympathy for its
officials in, their diﬁiculties. The general counsel for the

‘sugar trust is an ex-assistant attorney—general of the

United States, loyal to the powers that be, familiar with the
methods and secrets of _the attorney-general’: oﬂice. The

brother of the President of the United States is one of the

1.9,

attorneys for the sugar trust. A President of the United
States advised against a congressional investigation of the
sugar trust for the reason that it“might prove embarrassing."’
The last (?) frauds by the sugar trust were committed in
1907. The statute of limitation will soon be a bar against
criminal prosecution.”

This is quoted for the purpose of furnishing you

an idea of how the big thieves are protected by the nation.
A few hired employees of this trust who did as they were
told may be sent to prison. Those who proﬁted by the
frauds—who got the dividends, will escape and remain emi-
nently respectable. So long as proﬁts are legalized, so
long as the state and nation protects the big thieves of her
own making, little thieves will increase in number.

SOCIETY’S CRIME AGAINST WOMANHOOD.

If a tree may be judged by its fruit, so may a system
be judged by its results. See how our “best citizens”
shun the fallen woman. VVe know that when the price
of bread is raised, when rent, oil, meat and thread ad-
vance, when the necessities of life go up, and wages do
not keep pace, the standard of life comes down, and while we
may not know whose daughters it will be, we do know some
one’s daughters will be forced upon the street to sell their
bodies for bread; and we know that when the ﬁrst such sale
is made. the door of the pit of our social hell opens and the
girl’s doom is sealed.

At best, a wo1nan’s wage barely sufﬁces to keep soul and
body together. Raise the cost of her living without raising
her wages and the line of demarcation between virtue and
vice will be wiped out, and many of them will be driven by
necessity to a “life of shame.” Anything that strikes a
vicious blow at womanhood, anything that lowers her stand-
ard of life, that destroys her self-respect, and that ﬁnally
plunges her into the unspeakable depths of prostitution, is a

crime, than which there is none more damning. Society
permits, ah, legalizes, hence encourages those raising prices.

Many of those who proﬁt and grow richby reason of these
20

prices, make the loudest outcry about the social evil. Wlio
are the cri/11i1za1s.?'

CHILD LABOR——A SOCIAL CRIME.

Who can fully portray the infamy of child labor? Two
million children that ought to be in school are being ex-
ploited, literally ground into proﬁts. In the warp and woof
of the silks and satins that bedeck the bodies of the rich is
the sweat and blood, and the blighted hopes and honor of
thousands of girls and boys.

I have stood beside the factory gates and have seen

the stream of childhood go through in the morning,

and have seen them come out at night, some of whom
had lost a ﬁnger, o-r a hand or limb. All of them had
been robbed and as I looked, in imagination I have tried
to draw a mental picture of what it foreshadowed. I heard

the oaths of some, and I knew they had been sworn at in‘

the mill. I heard the rude jests of the others and I knew
they were looked upon as animated machines and had neither
the opportunity nor the means necessary to reﬁnement.
Many of them were deformed in body, mind and soul, and
I knew why. Here and there was a sweet—faced girl or a
bright boy, and I knew that in their hearts (as well as in
those of nearly all of them) there was a “longing for some-
thing better than they had known.” I looked just a little into
the future a.nd I heard promises being made to these girls,
promises of ﬁne clothes and good furniture and an easy life.
I saw some of them yield, and soon there was another re-
cruit in the ranks of the “fallen” or a suicide’s grave. I
looked again, and those bright boys, some of them, tried to
imitate the high ﬁnancier (only they were on the wrong side
of the desk or counter), and were caught and sent to prison,
which was the beginning of the end———a criminal career—a
life sentence or the electric chair. Then I heard labored
sermons preached to these child slaves in which the fall of
Adam, human depravity, innate sin, and God’s loving kind—

ness were so insanely mixed that I could not help exclaim, A

“damn such doctrines!” Then I also saw the vast majority

struggle on, some for a few years, and then ﬁlla premature —

grave; others drag out a miserable existence of poverty and
hard labor and I wondered how long a nation could survive

21

that permits, much less legalizes in any degree, such a hell-
ish infamy.

Yet, such is human nature, that in spite of this child
labor curse, some of those children turned out to be splen-
did men and women, and I have said “any of them could
have become as good as the best did become, and the best
would have risen inﬁnitely higher had none of them been
robbed, but had received civilized treatment instead of the
kind that suggests the conscience of a hyena or the heart of
a boa-constructor.” Again I ask, “Who are the criminals?”

These children dimly know they have been robbed of
life, of health, of intellect and of spirit. “In their cramped
and deformed souls the ﬁres of an unextinguishable wrath
begin to burn. They go through life hating society, hating
everybody and everything. For, they know that a system
of industry, a state of society has worse than murdered
them.” Do you want to understand criminology? If so,
study the psychology of the state of mind of these child vic-
tims. What part have you played in this tragedy?

22

CHAPTER IV.
MURDER.

“As long as nations meet on the ﬁelds of war, as long as
they sustain the relations of savages to each other, as long as
they put the laurel and the oak on the brows of those who kill,
just so long will citizens resort to violence, and the quarrels of

individuals be settled by dagger and revolver.”
-—R. G. Inemnsonn.

“THOU SHALT NOT KILL”?

OME one asked me not long ago if I was try-
ing to defend criminals, especially murder-
ers. I asked which ones were referred to-—
the rich or the poor—-the retail or the
wholesale murderers P Most people speak
of “murder” as though they were sure they
knew what they meant. What is meant by

MURDER? The reply will most likely be: taking human

life, killing of one person by another. Taking just one life,

or many, killing one person or a multitude? As in the mat-
ter of theft, the thing or act that is called a crime can be
and often is changed by law into an alleged virtue. For ex-
ample: If I steal a loaf of bread to keep myself or babies
from starving, I am a thief; but if I exploit thousands of
working men, women and children of nearly all they pro-
duce—equal to millions of loaves, I am not a thief, but

a business man fit to be a United States Senator. If I kill

one man I am a murderer (that is if I am not a

millionaire), but if I cause the death of a million men I am

called a hero—a great ruler, or statesman. Let us put the
case in this way. Suppose twelve men get together and plot
to kill a man. That is called conspiracy to murder, and if
they carry out their plot they are called murderers. Then
suppose twelve other men are called together and listen to
the reasons that are alleged to justify the killing of the ﬁrst

23

 

twelve, and they ﬁnally decide it must be done and it is done.
Are they murderers? No, they are a jury. But don’t you
see they caused twelve men to be killed, and it was the kill-
ing of a man per se, that was called crime, but by a legal
turn killing twelve men is not a crime, but a necessity——
hence a virtue (?).

Let the matter stand clearly on its merits. If
one man has not the right to kill, because killing is a
crime, have twelve men—a jury—the right to kill? Don’t
forget that it was taking human life, killing some one that
constituted the crime that so frightened society for its own
safety that it decided to commit the same kind of a crime that
had so shocked its moral sensibilities as well as aroused its
fears. Don’t dodge behind the “legal” pretext. That only
clouds the principle at issue; which is, is it right to kill?
You may ask: “Have I the right to defend myself even to
taking the life of another, if to do so would save my own?”
That only begs the question-—First: Because just so long
as taking life is legalized, the necessity for personal protec-
tion will remain. Second: The lives of the jury and the
judge were not in danger, so there is no parallel in the
premises. You may be forced to act hastily and on impulse,
they are supposed to- deliberate calmly and act judicially
without prejudice or passion.

That society must protect itself no one questions. Dare
it sow the seeds of crime and then damn the harvest? May
it kill, then kill you for following the example it sets? Put
the case this way: If I kill one man I am called a murderer
and am killed by the state because the state sets such a high
value on life (P). But, suppose I am a General and help to
kill ﬁve hundred thousand men. I become a hero—am
crowned with the “laurel and the oak”-—will be met at the
depot by the elite of cities, with banners and bands—will be
escorted to the best hotels, then to the ﬁnest opera houses,
where my killing exploits will be listened to with almost
breathless interest, (even though I boast of having shot a
Spaniard in the back). Can you not see that the psychology
of the recital of these wholesale murders, so heartily ap-
proved by organized society, tends to fan into ﬂame the kill-
ing instinct, and, therefore, sows the seeds of many future

24

individual murders? “Oh, but,” you say, “that was done
in war, done for the glory and protection of the nation.”
Don’t you know that back of every war there was an eco-
nomic cause, the same kind of greed and desire for gain
that actuates the individual also actuated the state, carried
out on a larger scale by the state than the individual could.
The difference is in degree, not in principle.

You may object to or deny the correctness of this posi-

tion. It may be claimed that our Revolutionary War, the

defense by the Boers, and our Civil War prove me wrong,
or else there remains no room for patriotism.

As a matter of fact those wars prove me right. King
George’s greed forced us to ﬁght. He and his titled satel-
lites wanted more and more power over America to the end
that they could exploit us more. If the Boers were right,
England was wrong. If the North was right (in our so-
called Civil War), then the South was wrong, and so also
in the case of Russia and Japan. The wrong grew out of
economic causes, a desire to exploit, to get territory, so in
order to accomplish these economic ends, men became sav-
ages and killed each other. Patriotism is the antithesis of
tyranny and would never be exempliﬁed in war if tyranny
did not force the issue. Wars are not caused by the de-
fenders of a country, hence have no justiﬁcation. It is the
magnitude of the conﬂict, the awful grandeur and display,
the pity for the suffering endured, the heartaches for the
dead and the false teachings as to patriotism that obscures
the actual right and wrong of the causes that were respon-
sible for the wholesale murders that are gloriﬁed by the
name of war.

“Patriotism,” said Dr. Johnson, “is the last refuge of
scoundrels.” Patriots are not scoundrels, but most all
scoundrels pretend to be patriots, and they are the ﬁrst to
cry “treason” at those who try to expose their villainies.

Those who conspire to steal a nation’s resources, who
bribe legislators and gamble in the necessities of life, are the
greatest verbal patriots we have. If facts were given in all
questions instead of appeals to patriotism, wars would soon
cease. Nations make war (wholesale murder) a business;
they pay, train and drill men to plan and kill. Naturally, if

25

ideas of peace become generally diffused and deﬁnitely ﬁxed,
these uniformed mercenaries would soon lose their jobs.
The capitalists would lose an arm of power so often used
against the working class, and the chief support of tyranny
would disappear.

In settling (P) their disputes by war, nations use
no more judgment than bar-room loafers do in the
settlement of their disputes. Those differ in pretended
causes, so do these. Honor, dignity, national or personal
pride or interest are reﬂected in the quarrels and murders
that startle and shock us with such an increasing frequency.
In the personal cases we often say "‘drunken brawl,” in the
other we yell “patriots,” and shout “glorious war,” but the
harvest in both is wounds and death.

A legal killing is “an invitation to and keeps alive the
mob spirit, for many will feel they have a right to do quick-
ly and cheaply what the law would have done slowly and
at great expense.”

Murder is the external and visible indication of an
internal disease. When the human body contains many
boils, carbuncles and cancers, all will agree that the
blood is impure. When pains rack and fevers burn, con-
stitutional causes can be found. Crimes are but social pains.
When they increase in number, variety and intensity, society
is diseased. The remedy must be as thorough as the cause
is deep. If your blood or system is poisoned, will you con-
tinue to do the things that caused it and yet expect to get
well?

Society legalizes proﬁt—taking, then pretends to pun-
ish some proﬁt—takers. Society legally kills, then speaks of
individual murderers as criminals, forgetting or not know-
ing that they fatten on what they feed and that she fur-
nishes the food.

Don’t for a moment imagine that I am denying the right
of national or self defense, or that I regard the murderer or
thief as a model citizen. Punishment for the sake of pun-
ishing does not make for protection. Stealing from a thief
does not reform the thief nor sanctify the second theft.
Killing a murderer does not add sanctity‘ to human life,
but the reverse.

26

When we ﬁnd the big thieves pardoned and the little ones
serve from one month to a life sentence for stealing a loaf of
bread or a coat, and the rich murderer escape through a tech-
nicality while the poor one is hung or electrocuted, we are
apt to have a righteous contempt for the hypocrisy involved
and many will be driven to those excesses that threatened the
very existence of organized society. So, if society wants to
protect herself, if she regards her own existence with any
degree of respect or reverence, she must remember that she
is composed of individuals, and as she treats them they will
treat her. Society must set the example she wishes fol-
lowed. If she says “Thou shalt not steal,” then she must
not steal, nor go into partnership with any brand of thieves.
If she says, “Thou shalt not kill,” then she dare not kill, for
in breaking her own commands she loses the respect of all
honest people and invites those disasters that constitute her
danger. What, then, shall be done? What shall she do?
These are pertinent questions and I shall deal with them
directly.

PREFACE AND DEDICATION

Y objects in publishing this lecture are, First, a desire
M to comply with the requests of hundreds who have
heard it delivered (under the title of “Crimes and
Criminals”), and Second, the wish to give it as wide a
hearing as possible.

It is not my purpose to oﬁer an apology for criminals, big
or little, but to explain something of the cause or causes
which lie_ back of, and hence becomes responsible for what
we are pleased or forced to call crime.

I "dedicate” this lecture, First, to the working class as a
whole. It is the members thereof who, when they violate
the capitalistic code of law or morals, become the “crimi-
nals" that excite such general indignation ; and Second, to
those individuals, men and women lower down, “the little

criminals who ﬁll the penitentiaries, ” for thus the "majesty A

of the law is sustained,” and the big thieves, those “higher

up ' are kept respectable. The legal thefts of the “ desir- V

able” are called ﬁnanciering and shrewd business. Their
graftings are protected by technicalities and further crimes.
Their murders are condoned. Their lack of morals excite
more mirth than indignation and they are soon forgiven
and forgotten. When the rich do wrong it is, of course,
due to "human weakness,” and we must be “charitable;”
but when members of the workmg class do the same things,
even though on a smaller scale, it is due to innate depravity
and downright individual cursedness, and they must be
"punished. ’ '

CHAPTER V.
REMEDY.

OCIETY must protect herself. But how? Sup-
pose the existence of a large swamp, the
water of which is putrid, covered with scum.
Around this swamp there is splendid land, a
deep rich soil, easy of cultivation and in-
habited by thousands of people. Suppose
again that these people had suffered, and

many had prematurely died of fever and ague, and again
suppose some one or more among these people would sug-
gest that they “drain the swamp ;” what would you think of
the intelligence of the rest of them if they called their ad-
visers “drain agitators,” and would add “that swamp always
was here and always will be.” “God intended it to be so
or he would not have put it here.” “Go to, thou long—haired
dreamer, all we need is healthy men and women.” “See,”
they might say, “how long some of us have lived, and it is
the fault of each that died that they didn’t live longer.” “This
is a free land and every one can be healthy if they so will
it, and if any are not, it is their own individual fault.” “All
we need is healthy men.”

The drainers might say, “But, neighbors, disease is in-
creasing among us, conditions are changing, we are dumping
our refuse, our sewage into that swamp and that in turn
adds poison to the air We breathe. Let us drain the swamp
and the sun will soon dry and purify the land now covered
by that water, and that in turn can be used for abundant
crops. It is now useless.” If the drainers should then be
driven into exile and the rest should continue doing as their
“fathers did,” I ask again, what would you think of them?

We have a political and an industrial system that af-
fects our morals and our lives, from the standpoint of crim-
inology at least, very much as would the supposed swamp
affect the lives of those around it, and we may safely

28

 

call it the swamp of Capitalism. This swamp is composed
of and based on the robbery of the working class. It gath-
ers corruption and grows larger on vice, and from its sur-
face and beneath its scum it exudes and exhales all the
crimes mentioned in the Decalogue, and more so as it pro-
duces individual and national shame, despair, misery and
general desolation, and, as some one has said, “it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, slays reputations, wipes
out national honor, then curses the world and laughs at its
ruin,” and in spite of this we often hear people say ‘‘All that
is needed is that honest men be elected to ofﬁce.”

THEN WHAT IS THE REMEDY?

1

“Drain the swamp,’ or as the Socialists say, “Change
the system.” “No,” say the apologists of capitalism, “just
elect honest men.” Elect honestmen to make laws to perpetu-
ate this industrial swamp! If capitalism, as exempliﬁed in its
present tendency, is responsible for one-half the Socialists
charge then it should be abolished. It won’t do to say “it
always was so and always will be ;” or that God gave us
free wills, so each one could do as he liked. If we have
free wills, we have the right to use them in changing the‘
system in draining the swamp.

The tools of industry, like the land in theswamp, are
essential to our needs. Corporate ownership of them spells
slavery.

Social ownership and control means reclamation and
equitable utilization.

In this connection I desire that you read carefully the
following extracts from Lester F. Ward’s Psychic Factors
of Civilization, page 320:

“Under the system as it now exists the wealth of the
world, however created, and irrespective of the claims of
the producers, is made to ﬂow towards certain centers of
accumulation, to be enjoyed by those holding the keys to
such situations, ‘the means of production and distribution.’
The world appears to be approaching a stage at which those
who labor, no matter how skilled, how industrious or how
frugal, will receive, according to the ‘iron law’ formulated

29

-by Ricardo, only so much for their services as will enable

them to subsist and to perpetuate their race.

“The rest ﬁnds its way into the hands of acomparatively
few, usually non—producing individuals, whom the usages
and laws of all countries permit to claim that they own the
sources of all wealth and the right to allow or forbid its
production.

“These are great and serious evils, compared witl1 which
all the crimes, recognized as such, that would be committed
if no government existed, would be as trifles.

“The underpaid labor, the prolonged and groveling
drudgery, the wasted strength, the misery and squalor, the
diseases resulting, and the 'premature deaths that would
be prevented by a just distribution of the products of labor,
would in a single year outweigh all the so—called crimes of
a century, for the prevention of which, it is said, govern-
ments alone exist.

“This vast theater of woe is regarded as wholly outside
the jurisdiction of governments, while the most strenuous
efforts are put forth to detect and punish the perpetrators
of the least of the ordinary recognized crimes. This ignor-
ing of great evils, while so violently striking at small ones,

‘is the mark of an effete civilization.”

I request you to read those quotations again. There is
involved in them the essence of every claim put forth by
me, as to the source and perpetuating cause of crime.

Note what he says about the just distribution of the
products of labor. (The italics are mine.)

Again on~page 323 he says:

“The individual has reigned long enough. The day
has come for society to take its affairs into its own hands
and shape its own destinies.

“The individual has acted as best he could. He has
acted in the only way he could. With a consciousness, will,
and intellect of his own he could do nothing else than pur-
sue his natural ends. He should not be denounced nor
called any names. He should not even be blamed. nay, he
should be praised andzimitated. Society should learn its
great lesson from him, should follow the path he has so

30

clearly laid out that leads to success. It should imagine
itself an individual, with all the interest of an individual,
and becoming fully conscious of these interests it should
pursue them with the same indomitable will with which the
individual pursues his interests. Not only this,~it must be
guided, as he is guided by the social intellect, armed with
all the knowledge of all individuals combined, with so great
labor, zeal and talent have placed in its possession, consti-
tuting the social intelligence.”

Let us look at the matter another way. Food, raiment
and shelter are absolutely necessary to our very existence;
therefore, nothing is of more importance to us than its
production and distribution. The greatest of all problems
then, is, how to get a living. That problem is an economic
one and its solution involves the solution of every problem
of industrial, political and social life. All struggles between
man and man, between nation and nation, have an economic
base, grow out of exploitation made possible by the private
ownership of the means of life.

If in proportion as the struggle to get a living grows
more difﬁcult, crimes increase, and they do, then the remedy
for or the thing to be done to prevent crime is to make it
as easy as possible to earn a living, and to see to it that none
who are able to earn it, shall live in idleness off the labor of
others. “He that will not labor, neither shall he eat.”

We must see to it, since an abundance is so easily pro-
duced, that it be equitably distributed, that is, that each pro-
ducer gets the social equivalent of all he or she produces.

If the human body contains plenty of blood, but it con-
gests around the heart, disease and death will result, if cir-
culation cannot in a reasonable time, be re—established.
While congestion obtains, the body will be afflicted with a
multitude of symptoms and pains mental and physical.

There may be plenty of food in a nation, but if it is
concentrated, owned by a few, then crimes, which are but
social pains, will logically follow. Good circulation of the
blood, and good health follows. Just distribution of the
products of labor and good social health will result. As
good social health appears, crimes (social pains) will disap-
pear. Most of us seem to fear that civilization would dis-
appear if we ceased to imprison our social mistakes, the chil-

31

dren of our i.ndustrial tyranny; or that society would be in
danger of extinction if the shadow of the gallows should
cease to fall athwart the doors of our schools, our temples

. of justice ( P), our churches and our homes. The shadow of

the gallows, like that of the deadly upas tree, blights, if it
does not kill everything it touches.

You may ask what shall we do with our criminals while
we are draining the swamp, that is changing the system,
inaugurating Socialism.

I reply it is a thousand times better to prevent crime
than to punish the criminal after the crime has been com-
mitted. The ﬁrst thing then to do is to commence at once
to take possession of the machinery of government and use
it to legalize our actions in reclaiming and restoring to the
wealth-producers the land and mines, and mills androads,
in short the tools and means of production and distribution
and communication. By doing this the causes that produce
criminals and induce crimes will be in process of removal,
and as it approaches completion, crimes and criminals will
disappear. It may be asked, are the criminals in the mean-
time to be allowed to run free? No, neither the big one nor
the little ones.

It is being now proven, in both Elmira, N. Y., and
Cleveland, Ohio, prisons that the more humane the prison-
ers are treated, the more complete their reformation.

Judge Lindsey, of Denver, Colorado, is proving that
boys and girls are innately good, as well as bad.

Turn the prisons and penitentiaries into industrial hos-
pitals. Treat the convicts with the view of curing their
mental diseases. Put them to work, pay them the same
wage they could get for similar work outside. Useful work
is medicine to the mind if fully compensated. If any of
them have families or other dependents, see that they get all
the wage above the prisoner’s keep. Those who have no
dependents should be made to save their wage, so that when
freed they would have something to live on till they found
a job. Those found to be incurable, should be kept con-
ﬁned. *

We don’t punish the leper, still we dare not set him at
liberty.

32

The jailer should be a mind specialist. He should know
something of the “philosophy of mind, the causes of
human actions and the real science of government.”

He should know whether the brains of criminals are
“exactly like those of honest men.” He should know some-
thing of heredity.

Diseases of ﬂesh and blood are transmitted. “Are dis-
eases of the brain, are deformities of soul, of the mind also
transmitted?”

Each individual case should be scientiﬁcally treated, and
above all, punishment should not be inﬂicted nor justice
abandoned. The prisoners should not be robbed.

Only a few can paint a beautiful picture or compose an
inspiring song. We say it takes genius to do these things.
We don’t call those criminals nor immoral who cannot do
them.

To be able to tell the truth, to be honest requires not
only some genius but some incentive.

Commercialism offers the greatest incentive and the
largest rewards to the most successful liars and legal thieves.

Let us change the system so that truth and worth will
be rewarded. Can that be done? It must be done, and it
can and will be done. How?

If one man owned the whole world, all the rest of us
would be his vassals, his slaves. If a few men owned the
world the rest of us would be their servants. If all the
people collectively owned the world, there would be no
slaves. Ownership carries with it the right to govern, to
control the thing or things owned. Ownership by a few
means autocracy, ownership by all means democracy.

The autocrats own the jobs of the rest of us, and he
who owns our jobs can control our lives. This is the es-
sence of slavery.

Socialism comes in at this point and points out the
solution. . _

It demands social, that is, collective ownership and
management of all jobs by collectively owning all the means
of production and distribution.

It demands not only such ownership, but that each

33

worker shall receive the social equivalent of all he produces.

It demands that all things socially used shall be _

socially owned, and that. all things privately used shall be
privately owned in proportion to the service rendered by

the user.
CONCLUSION.
An independent free man will be the most moral.

If this is not true, then slavery would be the ideal con-
dition of mankind. .

Freedom cannot exist without an adequate economic
foundation.

The essential factors of such a foundation are:

First—The unabridged opportunity to an equitable use
of nature’s resources.

Second——-The unqualiﬁed right to enjoy the full equiva-
lent of the results of one’s labor, and,

Third—The untrammeled ownership of a home.

Social ownership of the means of production and dis-
tribution will make possible the unabridged opportunity to
equitably use nature’s bounties.

Social ownership will afford each producer the right
to help direct the methods of production and distribution,
as well as confer the power to make the right of each to
the full equivalent of his or her labor effective.

The enjoyment by each worker of his or her full social
product will make it easy to own a home.

The more homes and ﬁresides, literature, pictures and
music, the less crimes there will be.

As such home-ownership increases, prisons will disap-
pear. _

We have found antitoxines for diphtheria and small-
pox, and we use them.

Liberty and freedom are the antitoxines for crime.

Socialism stands for the economic liberty and freedom

of man, woman and child.
Therefore in Socialism will be found the remedy for
society’s crime-diseased condition.
Socialism will stop crime by making mankind free.
Free men will not be criminals.

TO MY FRIENDS

The first edition of "CriminologY. Crimes and Crim—
inals” of 5,000 copies was disposed of in less than two
months, and was so well received thatl felt warranted in
printing another and larger edition, which enables it to be
sold cheaper and nearer to the marle ﬁrst aimed at. Note
prices below-

The following are some of the comments and opin—
ions on the worle-

' What we need is more such books placed in the hands of thinking people,
for upon the brain of our country depends our salvation.

JUD. HARRIS, Sec'y Socialist Party.
Sparks, Nevada.

Have just finished reading your booklet, "Criminologh Crimes and Grim-
nals." This is surely the warmest article ever wrapped up in a ten cent cover.
“Wish that every Big Criminal in this big country could be induced to read this
little big article." It would help wonderfully in curing crime.

Yours for Industrial Liberty,

WM. SHEFFLER, Sec'y Socialist Party, lnd.

lreceived the copy of your lecture, (C. C. § C.) and think it extra good.
The subject is presented in a clear and convincing manner, your reasoning is
logical and philosophical, and the book ought to be in the hands of every person
who hates crime and loves justice.
Yours fraternally,

ALLEN COOK, Canton, Ohio.

Comrade Coole is a very able attorney, and is the author of the reply to J.
Wesley Hill, D. D.

l am not surprised that your first edition of "Criminology, Crimes and
Criminals" was disposed of in such a short period. It ﬁlls a gap in Socialist
literature never before touched upon, and should be read by all who are respon-
sible tor the continuation of a State of society that produces criminals.

J. A. AULENBACH,
Manager Sentinel Printing Co.,
Reading, Pa.

Reading, Pa., October 14th, 1910. -
Mr. John W. Slayton,
Dear Comrade: lread your Criminologv. Crimes and Criminals, as it
came trom the press, and predict a great sale for the book. It adds another ray

of light to the brilliancy of Socialist literature. It is plain, logical and scholarly.
The low price of the bool! makes it possible to reach the millions of workers and
this also adds to its worth.

Yours for the Cause.
JAMES ‘H. MAURER.

Comrade J. H. Maurer was the candidate for Governor on the Socialist

ticlzet in 1906.

Reading, Pa., October 6th, 1910.
Mr. Jno. W. Slayton, McKeesport, Pa..

Dear Comrade : l have read "Criminol0gY. Crimes and Criminals. "
This is the first boole that l have read, that popularized this profound and im-
portant subject. it is a book that can be readily understood by the average
reader, and yet loses none of its scientiﬁc value to the student.

Kindly accept my congratulations.

Yours truly,

CHAPTER I.

“If there be any one that makes many poor to make a few
rich, that suits not a Commonwealth.”—OLIvEn CROMWELL.

COMRADES AND FRIENDS.

HEN an epidemic of physical disease sweeps
over a city or nation, we seek the cause,
knowing that if we can ﬁnd and remove it
the epidemic will cease.

We do not accuse those who seek the
cause of apologizing for the diseases that
obtain, but hail them as benefactors of their

fellow men, if they ﬁnd and even partially remove it.

There are diseases of the brain as well as of the body.
No one, whose brain was in a normal condition, ever com-
mitted a crime. There are many phases of Phobia (fear)
which, in proportion to their tendency and intensity, result in
mental Gripp, Measles, Chills, Ague, Typhoid Fever and
Smallpox.

When physically affected with any of these diseases,
we pity and protect, but when thus mentally diseased, we
punish or destroy.

When we ﬁnd a man afflicted with smallpox, why don’t
we shoot, hang or electrocute him? “That would be bar-
barous,” you say; so we hasten him to a hospital or a pest
house, furnish a doctor, a nurse and medicine; but when
we ﬁnd a man afﬂicted with crime, we.demand imprison-
ment or death. In treating our criminals in this barbarous
way, we try to justify ourselves on the ground that society
must be protected.

Are not both men endangering society? The smallpox
patient will, if let “run free,” contaminate thousands, hun-
dreds of whom may die. The mentally diseased’ only de-
sires to kill his imagined enemy in order to protect himself

or gain a desired end. If protection to society be the real
object, why the difference in treatment? I know the theory
of original sin. If that is the cause of his crime, why hold
him personally responsible, since it is manifest he must have
inherited the seeds that fruited in the crime?

When society in its organized capacity, legally takes
the life of any one, it is in the same mental state the man
was in when he committed his crime, and with less excuse.
That social mental state in turn, furnishes at least a sec-
ondary cause for future individual murders, for the seed of
murder is thus sown and the harvest is sure to follow.

The individual imitates, as best he can, the things legal-
ly done by the society in which he lives, in proportion to his
belief in the imagined justice thereof, or as his interests may
incline him.

You may say, “Oh, but there are certain well under-
stood crimes, everybody knows they are crimes, hence the
individual responsibility of those who commit them is be-
yond question.”

So also, does everybody understand the danger of
smallpox, yet many get it (or more properly speaking, it
gets them).

We don’t hold them personally responsible. We now
know that society is to blame. We now know that good san-

itation would have prevented it. Therefore when it appears .

we make some amends by taking care today of the victims
of our mistakes of yesterday.

Industrial conditions bear the same relation to mental
health that sanitation does to physical. And as industrial
conditions depend on social action or toleration, the praise
or blame deserved cannot be justly loaded on the victims
in the case of crime (mental disease) any more than in
physical afﬂictions.

Before proceeding further it might be well to consider
the question

WHAT IS CRIME?

I reply, that depends in a measure at least, on who de-
cides. You know that we are inclined to think that our

4

doxy is orthodox, hence good, while your doxy is hetro-
dox, therefore bad.

Most of us are inclined to accuse others of being actu-
ated by ulterior motives or criminal intent. Many things
we do without a blush we condemn others for doing, and the
line of demarcation between mistakes and crimes is often
obliterated by us, sometimes because of our prejudices, our
loves, our hates, and more especially on account of our
personal interests.

It is not long since disbelief (that is the other fellow’s
belief as measured by us) was considered the greatest of
all crimes, meriting torture here and eternal damnation
hereafter. So I may safely say it will be hard to decide
where to draw the line between virtue and vice, mistakes
and crimes. Most of us can and do ﬁnd so many good
reasons (to us, of course) in justiﬁcation of what we do,
much of which, if done by others, we would say was crim-
inal.

I maintain, however, that all those things done or acts
committed by an individual or a group of individuals, legal-
ly or illegally, that produce or tend to produce unhappi-
ness, misery, poverty and degradation, are crimes, regard-
less of degree or of the respectability of the perpetrators.

THE FACTORS.

I will undertake to prove that few people understand
the fundamental facts underlying crime. Many who are
the loudest in condemning crime, are doing all they can to
protect the big criminals, as well as helping to produce the
little ones they seem so anxious to imprison or kill.

Enrico Ferri said: “Three factors must be understood
before we can, with any degree of clearness, understand
‘criminology.’ They are: First, the anthropological, that
is racial characteristics; temperaments-—heredity. Second,
the telluric, that is soil, climate and natural resources, and,
Third, the social institutions.” He insists (and other well in-
formled students agree) that the latter exerts a much greater
inﬂuence than either of the other two factors.

Permit me to use an apt illustration. The ﬁrst and sec-

5

ond factors furnish the material, the clay, so to speak; the
third, the social institutions become the potters who give
direction to, who fashion, make or mar the human shapes,
furnish language and labor and decide all questions of law
and morals. Intellectually, morally and physically then,
these bits of anthropological and telluric clay, ﬁnally reﬂect
the workmanship of the society that handles them.

I admit the overlapping, the action and reaction of the
forces called natural and those called social, for it must be
borne in mind that we of today haveinherited the environ-
ments of many yesterdays. Our children will inherit so
much of our environment that it can be truly stated that
we of today are preparing the material for tomorrow’s pos-
sibilities.

It must also be understood that our desire for better
things, for a change of methods, of systems, and of environ-
ments, grows out of the suffering bad environments pro-
duce and, by reacting on the causes that gave them birth,
these desires in turn become direct forces making for their
own fulﬁllment.

These forces in action and reaction constitute the social
forces which, when expressed in and through social institu-
tions, become the greatest factor in criminology. I will try
to make this clearer as I progress.

Professor Lombroso was hailed by the defenders of
commercialism as the greatest criminologist of the present
age. He claimed the shape of ﬁngers, thumbs and skulls
indicated the predisposing tendencies of the individual
toward virtue or vice.

He also claimed that criminals were born, that they are
natural products. The whole brood of exploiters praised
him for having exonerated them (as they hoped) of all
blame for the multitude of industrial slave victims that
were concomitantly increasing in the wake of commer-
cialism. . ,

Other scholars investigated ‘criminology, and while they
agree that everything is natural, they also insist that nature
in this, as in other respects, permits man to use her to his
advantage. They found‘ that even the shapes of thumbs

6

and skulls change under the inﬂuence of changed environ-
ments. Since man has a two—fold tendency, one towards
the good and one towards the bad, the institutions of a given
period can and do exert at determining inﬂuence for good
or bad.

THE MINISTER AND ENVIRONMENT.

Some years ago I listened to a minister addressing a
“Good Citizens’ League,” and among other things he said:
“The Socialists place too much stress and importance on
environment. When he wants to, man can rise superior to
his environment with God’s help.” (He seemed to forget

"the inﬂuence of the devil).

He also said he didn’t care “how many millionaires
there were, just so they didn’t use their wealth badly, but
for the good of mankind.” “Of course,” he added, “I don”:
believe in getting these millions dishonestly, but if they were
acquired honestly no one was robbed and the world was
beneﬁtted by the accumulation.” ,

I asked him these questions:

First———If a man rose above his environments, would not
those who remained below be subject thereto and that if it
was good for one to rise, would it not be good for all?

Second—If all rose, would not the environment be
changed?

Third——Is it no-t true that as a rule those who “rise”
do so by climbing on the backs of others, and thus their rise
partakes of the character of oppression?

I said, those who rise do not get up very far after all.
They look high only to those who were left below, to those
on whose shoulders they were standing.

He who exults in his own rise betrays his personal mo-
tives, and his selﬁsh nature, provided he does not try to help
the rest to rise at least to his level.

I then asked him why he lived upon the hill, away from
the smoke, dirt and noise in which the workers live, if it
was not because of better location—environment.

If I should ask you to let your son associate with
