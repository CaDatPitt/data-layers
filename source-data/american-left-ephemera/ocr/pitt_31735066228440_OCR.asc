whites, busing, even under the best of circumstances, could not
produce racially balanced schools. For example, only 30 percent
of New York City school children are classiﬁed as non-Puerto
Rican whites. The rigid and many-sided separation of blacks
and whites in American society must be attacked at its most
blatant level-ghettoization.

The existence of and commitment to exclusively white
neighborhoods reflect racist attitudes, personal economic ad-
vantage and fear of racial violence. ‘For white homeowners,
there is an obvious economic advantage in keeping neighbor-
hood property values up by keeping blacks out. More important-
ly, .when blacks move into a white neighborhood, this is seen by
everyone as the expansion of the ghetto: any whites who do not
move out will soon find themselves in the unenviable and
dangerous situation of being isolated in a black neighborhood.

Only a powerful material incentive can break down the rigid
racially divided neighborhood pattern. Socialists must demand
the construction of low-rent, racially integrated quality public
housing. Many white families would show a very different
attitude toward having black neighbors if it meant they could
pay a third of their present rent for a comparable or even
better dwelling. On the other hand, hardened bigots who insist
on living in their exclusive neighborhoods would then be paying
dearly for that privilege. -

 

It is unlikely that free universal higher education or low-rent,

racially integrated housing will ever be achieved under condi-
tions of bourgeois class rule. However, such demands are
essential to turn the black and white working masses‘ present
clawing at each other over a larger share of the pie into a
united struggle against the common enemy—the capitalist
class.u ‘

Letter to Boston Trade Unions,
Black and Socialist
Organizations

Act Now!

Defend  
Black children!

Boston
22 September 1974

Dear Brothers and Sisters:

Boston's trade unions, black and socialist organizations
must defend the democratic rights of black people, which
are currently under attack in a vicious reactionary and
racist mobilization against busing. Our organizations have
the urgent responsibility to act now to put a halt tothe
campaign of physical and psychological terror that is being
inflicted on black school children in this city. The unions
and black organizations such as the NAACP, because of their
influence and resources, must take the lead inimmediately
calling and mobilizing for a massive public rally of all those
who oppose this campaign of racist violence and harassment.

The leaders of the pro—busing forces have relied solely
on the courts, the legislature and the police. Failing to
mobilize massive, visible public support for busing as a
minimal but democratic measure has allowed anti—busing
forces to pose as the popular mass movement of the "little
people" against the government.

The busing issue, inflamed by the demagogy of the Hicks
and Kerrigans, has brought to the surface the deep—seated
racist fears of large sections of Boston's white ethnic
communities. The polarization in Boston could reach ex-

-3-

 

 

plosive levels; harassment of black children has escalated
and spread in the last week. Despicable racist trash like
the Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan are gathering in Boston
hoping to add organization and muscle to the anti-busing
movement. These vicious hooligans would like to find in
tension—ridden Boston the conditions for launching the sort
of terror they have previously unleashed against blacks,
Catholics and Jews elsewhere in this country.

The Boston Police Patrolmen's Association (BPPA)_ has
made clear through editorials and articles in its paper,
the ‘Pox Centurion, that the police stand not with the defense-
less black children whom they are supposed to be protecting
but with the anti-busing forces. The insistence of a BPPA
attorney that policeman could not be prosecuted for refusing
"in good conscience" to arrest these rock-throwing racists
is evidence of their position and can only encourage the
white vigilantes. Numerous children have already been
injured; we can not wait for a tragic death to galvanize the
forces of defense.

It is already late. The reactionaries are organizing
to trample on the democratic rights, and legality which they
falsely claim to uphold. For example, the attempt by several
hundred demonstrators to suppress distribution of the Boston
Globe for its pro-busing policies is a particularly alarming
indication of the character of the anti—busing movement.
It is, however, not too late; The leaderships of the unions
and black‘ organizations are the only ones at this time with
sufficient inﬂuence and resources to successfully organize
a mass popular demonstration protesting the racist violence
against Boston's black school children. Such a mobilization
would crystallize public outrage against the vigilantes and
begin to isolate them, laying the basis for putting an end
to their actiyﬁies. _

The safety and well—being of hundreds of black children
are clearly in danger. Further, anti—busing forces around
the country are keeping a close watch on the situation in
Boston (the Globe of 22 September reports that the Denver’
Citizen's Association for Neighborhood Schools has been in
daily contact with Boston anti-busingjorce’).

As leaders of the organizations which represent large
numbers of working and poor people, black and white, you

must take action! To settle now for a boycott of the schools

by black children, without having first attempted to mobilize
all available forces in their defense, is to hand a victory
to the Klan, the Nazis, the Hicks and the Kerrigans and to
accept a momentous setback in the struggle for democratic

-9-

 

. rights for racial minorities in the U.S.

Our organizations may disagree on many social, economic
and political issues, but we can all agree with the need for
immediate united action in defense of the black school
children under attack by anti-busing forces. In the framework
of joint actions against these racist attacks, all participating
groups would, of course, be free to raise their own particular
points of view.

We repeat our urgent proposal for a broad mobilization,
initiated by the unions, black and socialist organizations, to
build a mass popular demonstration around the common slogan,
‘Stop the Racist Attacks Against Black School Children."
The Spartacist League, a labor-socialist organization, pledges
to devote all available resources and energy to aid in the
building of such a demonstration. However, at this time, no
single organization can mobilize sufficient forces for a
successful defense. Therefore, we urgently request your
response within 48 hours so that a first planning meeting
can be held soon, hopefully by mid-week. To fail to act now
is to accept responsibility for the escalating attackon defense-
less children, and for the potentially tragic outcome.

swr/vsA netenus
Liberals’ call for Troops
Into Boston

Not
Federal Troops,

But Labor/Black
Defense!

The sewer-socialists of the Socialist Workers Party/Young
Socialist Alliance (SWP/YSA) have felt compelled to sacrifice
two pages of customary hack journalism in the Militant (No-
vember 1) in order to defend their slogan calling for federal
troops to "protect" blacks from racist terror in the Boston
busing crisis. One article is a bland, pedagogic reply to a
critical letter from a reader; the second comprises edited
excerpts of SWP/YSA-honcho Peter Camejo's demagogic
response to the "sectarians" of the Spartacist League, and
less significantly the Workers League, at an October 11
Militant Labor Forum in Boston [see "From the Augean
Stables: Workers League ‘Answers’ SWP On Troops," Young
Spartacus No. 27, December 1974]. These articles upholding
the liberal pro-troop policy reveal once again, yet with forced
clarity, the SWP/YSA's revisionism on the most central
conception of Marxism: the nature of the capitalist state.

The essential assumption underlying all the derivative and
superfluous argumentsregurgitated in these articles is that
it is possible to control the armed forces of the capitalist
state through mass pressure. This is nothing new for the
SWP/YSA. For years these petty—bourgeois reformists have
been tailing black nationalists and pushing the demand for
"community control of the police." But in Boston today, the
SWP/YSA is fawning before the more popular misleaders of
the NAACP and the Black Caucus of the Massachusetts State

-11..

 

 

Legislature, to whom the Militant so respectfully refers to as
‘the leaders of the Black community,‘ who are demanding
federal troops.

But reformist theory serves diverse appetites. If militant
mass pressure can effectively ‘control’ the racist, murderous
cops, then certainly b-r-o—a-d popular pressure can force
the more ‘professional’ federal troops to act in the interests
of the oppressed. Hoping that the sought-for liberals are
listening", the Militant thus declares:

"In Boston today the demand that the government send in its
troops to desegregate the schools can be used as the rallying
point for the involvement of the broadest possible layers of
the Black community and its allies in struggle... .In fact,
the civil rights movement of the l950’s and early 1960's was
built around mass actions demanding that the government
enforce its laws. When the mass pressure became great

enough, as at Little Rock and later at Selma, Ala., the federal '

government was forced to intervene. In these cases the
government did not attack the black community’; it was trying
to placate the mass sentiment mobilized on behalf of that
community . . . . A mass movement demanding that troops be
called up to enforce desegregation of the Boston schools
would put the government on the defensive. It would make it
more difficult for the government to use these troops against
Blacks instead of the white racists. . . .whether or not any
law will be used against the oppressed is determined by the
relation of forces in the actual struggle.'[emphasis ours]

Offering themselves to the NAACP and Black Caucus
liberals as respectable "Marxist" spokesmen and "movement'-
builders who venerate the liberal-pacifist "civil rights move-
ment of the 1950's and early 1960's" and who recognize "the
leaders of the Black community," the SWP/YSA does not
limit its prostitution of Marxism to supporting uncritically
the liberal policy of reliance on the government. No, indeed.
Brother Camejo has taken the task of denouncing the slogan
of labor/black defense, which has always been anathema
to the liberals:

‘Instead of federal troops, the sectarians propose that there
be trade—union defense guards. ...The call for trade-union
defense guards isn't realistic right now. There are no trade
unions that even have defense guards, -much less any that
have offered them to defend the Black students... . .But you
pull this slogan of trade-union defense guards totally out of the
blue. It's not a serious proposal. It has nothing to do with

meeting the needs of the Black community today . . . . The Black

community lives in the real world, and it demands real,
meaningful solutions, not unrealistic slogans."

And to dispel any possible lingering wariness the liberals
might have about its sincerity in formerly enthusing over

‘armed black self—defense," the Militant bluntly proclaims:
"The demand to bring in federal troops puts the responsibility
right where it lies: in Washington."

What Are the Federal Troops?

For Marxists the state is "an organization of the exploiting
class at each period for the maintenance of its external condi-
tions of production," that is, of exploitation; it is, again in the
words of Marx and Engels, "a public force organized for
social enslavement," "a machine for the oppression of one
class by another,‘-and ‘an engine of class despotism.‘ This
"public force,” in the final analysis, reduces itself to special
bodies of armed men—the police, special security forces and
the military—which are backed up by the bureaucracy, judica-
ture and prisons.

Capitalism organically requires this “special repressive
force"-the cops and army-separate from and standing above
the broad masses in order to perform the repressive functions

-necessary for the continuation of capitalist society, to enforce

bourgeois ‘law and order“ through force or under the threat
of force. When the workersand oppressed revolt or otherwise
challenge the rule of the capitalist class, the fundamental
nature of the police and army is revealed with brutal, swift
and deadly force. Thus, those duties of public service which
the police and federal troops may perform—directing traffic,
assisting invalids, intervening in natural disasters and the
like-are clearly auxiliary functions which, unlike the repres-
sive functions, could even be executed by revocable agents of
the people.

From the time of the Paris Commune on, Marx and Engels
waged a continual struggle to instill in the workers movement
the crucial understanding that the police, army and state
bureaucracy could not be controlled or taken over and made
to work in the interests of the exploited, but had to be smashed.
Marx and Engels thus declared that the "working class cannot
simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield
it for its own purposes" but must "set aside all the old repres-
sive machinery previously used against itself.‘ This is the
fundamental thesis in the Marxist theory of the state and
the historic dividing line between revolutionary socialism
and reformism of all varieties.

If the proletariat in power cannot "control" capitalism's
police and army, then even more utopian is the illusion that
it can do so when it is not in power. Deceived by A1lende's
assurances that the military was under its control, the
Chilean workers and peasants paid with their blood for the

reformism of their misleaders. The little Kautskys of the
SWP,’YSA have already declared their revisionism on the
question of the state and merely await their moment in
history.

Communists have never turned to the bourgeoisie demand-
ing that it use its repressive forces to protect the struggles of
those whom_it oppresses. Unlike reformists a.nd the “labor
lieutenants of capital," revolutionists have never demanded
that the cops or federal troops intervene to "protect" the
strikes of workers, even when the strikes concern the enforce-
ment of some bourgeois legislation beneficial to the working
class. The role of the federal troops, not to mention the cops,
in labor struggles is too well known. It was the Stalinists
who demanded troops in the Little Steel struggle of 1937.
The Steel Workers Organizing Committee told the workers

.that they should "welcome" the troops, whom they said would

"protect" the strikers and "keep the mills closed." The
troops instead slaughtered 18 and wounded scores more, and
the Little Steel strike was defeated.

Lenin never would have considered calling upon the troops
of the Czar to protect the Jews, Armenians and other oppres-
sed nationalities from the vicious pogroms of the Black
Hundred gangs. Referring to "the lynching of Negroes" in the
U.S., Lenin denounced as "belly-crawling and boot-licking
before the capitalists” Kautsky's prattle about the capitalist
state "protecting the minority": '

'. ..the ruling party in a bourgeois democracy extends the
protection of the minority only to another bourgeois party,
~ while on all serious, profound and fundamental issues the
proletariat gets martial law or pogroms, instead of the
‘protection of the minority.‘ The more highly developed a
democracy is, the more imminent are pogroms or civil
war in connection with any profound political divergence
which is dangerous to the bourgeoisie." [original emphasis]
-—Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 245

Contrary to the treacherous illusions spewed by
the SWP/YSA, a mass mobilization of blacks in struggle,
which constitutes a "profound political divergence which is
dangerous to the bourgeoisie," will bring the bosses‘ troops
not into the control of the masses, but down on their heads!
When Camejo and his ilk conspicuously and repeatedly point
to instances where the cops or troops (always in the interests
of bourgeois "law and order") occasionally save individual
lives, it is precisely to divert attention from the role of the
bourgeois armed forces in those "serious, profound and
fundamental" struggles against the racist capitalist order.

Trotsky likewise denounced contemptuously those reform-

-15-

 

 

ist misleaders who called upon the capitalist state to use its
troops to protect workers and Jews from the terror of the
fascist gangs:

"To turn to the state, that is, to capital, with the demand to
disarm the fascists means to sow the worst democratic illu-
sions, to lull the vigilance of the proletariat, to demoralize
its will.. ..The Social Democrats, even the most left ones,
that is, those who are ready to repeat general phrases of
revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, carefully
avoid the question of arming the workers, or openly declare
this task 'chimerical,' adventurous, ‘romantic,’ etc.‘
—Writings of Leon Trotsky, 1933-34, p. 321-322

In the ‘Transitional Program, Trotsky emphasized the ex-
treme importance of propagandizing and whenever possible
organizing workers defense guards—the embryo of a future
workers militia—so that the workers would learn inthe course
of the class struggle the power and methods of working-class
defense: -

"In connection with every strike and street demonstration,
it is imperative to propagate the necessity of creating workers
groups for self-defense. .. .It is necessary to advance the
slogan of 3. workers militia as the one serious guarantee
for the inviolability of workers’ organizations, meetings and
press." [emphasis in original]

The slogan of workers defense guards, as the "one serious
guarantee” for the protection of the struggles of the oppressed,
comes not “totally out of the blue," Brother Camejo, but
straight out of the Trotskyist Transitional Program. Neither
this demand, nor any demand of the Transitional Program, is
for the SWP/YSA "realistic," "serious" or "meaningful"
simply because its program is reformism, not Trotskyism.
For the "unbounded opportunism" of the reformists, Lenin
noted, "that struggle is desirable which is possible, and the
struggle which is possible is that which is going on at the
given moment."

Principle and Tactics

Revolutionary Marxists regard the capitalist army and
workers defense guards/ workers militia as counterposed class
formations. When it is a question of defending the struggles of
the oppressed, the call for federal troops and the call for a
workers defense force are counterposed slogans which are
separated by a principled position on the nature of the capital-
ist state. The call for a labor/black defense in Boston today
is a statement of no confidence in the bosses’ army. "To turn
to the state, that is, to capital," anddemand that federal troops

-16-

 

protect black people against the racists who are being openly
encouraged by the government "means to sow the worst
democratic illusions, to lull the vigilance of the proletariat,
to demoralize its will."

While communists are opposed in principle to a policy of
reliance upon the "special repressive force" of capitalism,
our attitude toward an entire range of specific actions or
situations involving the cops or troops often has a tactical
dimension. Thus, Trotsky, who so vehemently denounced turn-
ing to the state for protection from the fascists, pointed out
that in certain instances the workers, independently organized
and mobilized, could and should engage, for example, in
episodic military blocs with government troops against the
fascists:

‘An irreconcilable attitude against bourgeois militarism does
not signify at all that the proletariat in all cases enters into
a struggle against its own ‘national’ army. At least the
workers would not interfere with soldiers who are extinguish-
ing a fire or rescuing drowning people during a ﬂood; on the
contrary, they would help side by side with the soldiers and
fraternize with them. And the question is not exhausted merely
by cases of elemental calamities. If the French fascists should
make an attempt today atacoupd'étatand the Daladier govern-
ment found itself forced to move troops against the fascists,
the revolutionary workers, while maintaining their complete
political independence, would fight against the fascists along-
side of these troops." [original emphasis]
—Wrz'tz'ngs of Leon Trotsky, 1938-39, p.5

But, to dissolve principles into tactics is one of the hoary
methods of revisionists to cover a reformist policy. Thus,
Camejo cites incidents in which a Boston cop saved a black
man from a racist mob and federal troops "protected" civil
rights activists in the South in order to disprove the "sectar-
ian" and "schematic formulas“ that "everything they ever do
is against the interests of the workers." Revolutionists ob-
viously do not intervene against police or troops when they are
in fact saving someone from assault or murder and when the
balance of forces is overwhelmingly against us. This is clearly
a matter of tactics. Camejo cites such instances to demon-
strate that if the cops or troops without mass pressure can
protect the oppressed, then they can certainly do so reliably
under "terrific pressure." What for communists are the exi-
gencies and prerogatives of bourgeois "law and order" are for
the SWP/YSA traitors the justification for preaching reliance
on the armed fist of capital and for opposing labor/black
defense.

Troops and Blacks: The Record

In order to front for the liberals and defend their treacher-
ous pro-troop policy, Messrs. Camejo and Co. repeatedly
recall the intervention of troops in the civil rights movement
as a great "victory." The use of troops in race riots and
civil’ rights actions can be seen as a “victory” only for those
whose fundamental perspective is liberal reformism. Troops
have always been used to contain or snuff out militant action
or revolt by the oppressed black masses. The capitalists
deploy their troops precisely at those times when the insur-
gent black masses threaten to, or actually do, break out of the
pas'si\7e',“ impotent protests imposed by their petty—bourgeois
misleaders. The liberals‘ demand for troops and the govern-
ment's decision to send them in fact spring from basically
similar motivations: the desire to curb independent mobiliza-
tion by blacks and to reimpose "nonviolence" (which means no
change). For communists, federal troops can only be seen as
a massive obstacle in the class-struggle road to black libera-
tion. What does the history of federal intervention with troops
into race riots and the Southern civil rights movement reveal?

‘ DETROIT, 1943: During the infamous Detroit race riot, the
Roosevelt government stood by and did absolutely nothing when
day after day blacks were being beaten and butchered in the
streets by crazed mobs of racists. It was only when blacks
began to retaliate by stoning white cars and destroying white
property in Paradise Valley, and when black soldiers stationed
140 miles away at Fort Custer attempted to seize arms and
march to Detroit to protect their families, that Roosevelt
ordered federal troops into Detroit. The federal troops arrest-
ed the black soldiers and clamped martial law upon Detroit.
This is how federal troops "protected" Detroit's blacks!

But the policy of the then-Trotskyist SWP was a far cry
from what fills the pages of the Militant today. Under the
headline, "Labor Must Crush the Anti-Negro Terror," the
Statement of the National Committee of the SWP courageously
declared:

"What must be done to stop this lynch violence? Certainly no
trust or reliance can be placed in the federal authorities, the
army, state or municipal police, the good-will of the capitalist
rulers, the action of Congress or the President. They have
shown that they will not take the steps needed to protect Negro
lives and rights.

"The chief responsibility for defending the Negro people rests
today upon the trade unions....The labor leaders must do
more than deplore these attacks upon the Negro people. They
must do more than order their members to stay off the
streets and appeal for grand-jury investigations. They must

-13-

 

 

, , ,,_. An,

 

summon their membership to take determined and organized
action against the instigators and organizers of these lynch
mobs.

"The members of each local should be mobilized for action.
Flying squadrons of union militants should stand ready to
protect the rights of their Negro fellow-workers menaced by
the mobs."

._Milita-nt, 3 July 1943

These words ring out from the SWP‘s revolutionary past
as a mighty denunciation of the sniveling social democrats who
lead this party today. A Trotskyist policy places "no trust
or reliance“ in "the federal authorities, the army," but rather
declares that "the chief responsibility for defending the Negro
people rests today upon the trade unions.” None of this "ultra-
left sectarianism" for Camejo and Co.! No, ‘The demand to
bring in federal troops puts the responsibility right where it
lies: in Washington." A Trotskyist policy challenges the
cowardly inaction of the labor skates and calls for "squadrons
of union militants." None of these wild "unrealistic slogans"
that have "nothing to do with meeting the needs of the Black
community today" for Camejo's SWP/YSA.

The policy of the SWP toward the Detroit riot was none-
theless flawed, not on the principled question of no confidence
in the federal troops, but on a tactical orientation to the black
soldiers. The same Statement of the National Committee
asserted:

"The Negro people have both the right and the duty to protect
themselves against lawless attacks of the lynch mobs. They
/ have the right to demand that, in the event of any future
T attacks, Negro troops alone be used and Negroes be deputized

to defend them.“ i
The SWP here was seeking to intersect the outrage of the
black soldiers toward the racist terror and the deep solidarity
of Detroit's embattled blacks with the heroic uprising at
Fort Custer. The SWP in effect was saying: we have no confi-

dence in and do not call for federal troops; but, should the,
government send them, then let it be these troops. While’

having absolutely nothing in common with Camejo and Co~'.:'s
call for federal troops and denunciation of labor/black defense,
this formulation definitely weakened the SWP‘s otherwise
clarion call for workers defense.

LITTLE ROCK, 1957: When following a desegregation order
the black students attempting to attend Little Rock High School
were daily subjected to racist harassment, President Eisen-
hower simply ignored all calls for federal intervention. But
when a race riot in the High School sparked a massive black
upheaval, in which blacks poured out of their homes with arms

-19-

 

to defend their community, enraged groups of black youth
battled and dispersed white racist mobs and blacks attacked
the police, only then did Eisenhower respond to the panicky
local racist authorities and rush troops into Little Rock. The
reality of the situation was, as headlined in one of the bour-
geois newspapers, "IKE MOVES AS NEGROES HIT BACK”
(Amsterdam News, 28 September 1957). These troops restored
‘law and order" and prevented the total rout of the retreating
racists! Martin Luther King applauded the invasion because
the troops enforced "nonviolence" among the blacks.

Furthermore, while these troops were "protecting" blacks
from their violent impulses and permitting the racists to re-
group, Eisenhower proceeded to strengthen the racists: the
"Northern" Federal Judge in Little Rock was dumped and
replaced by a southern racist, as demanded by racist Governor
Faubus; the scheduled desegregation of Texas public schools
was delayed by a federal court order; the resignation of At-
torney General Brownell, who had incurred the wrath of the
southern racists, was secured by Eisenhower; and the Civil
Rights Commission was stacked with Dixiecrats. And Camejo
tells us that the use of federal troops in Little Rock “broke the
back of the racist movement"!

The SWP by the mid-1950's had much of its revolutionary
capacity sapped by the long, seemingly unending years of
isolation in the McCarthy era and was gravitating toward
opportunist adaptation to the liberal leadership of the growing
civil rights movement. While still upholding a revolutionary
perspective, the SWP too eagerly and too uncritically em-
braced the liberal-dominated protest movement, which was

demanding federal intervention to carry out the 1954 Supreme ”

Court decision. Thus, the SWP summed up its attitude on
civil rights and the black struggle: "What should be done:
What should we be fighting for today? I can tell you in two
words: federal intervention. Federal intervention with troops
if necessary" (Militant, 17 October 1955).The SWP accordingly
supported the use of federal troops in Little Rock
and wrote the demand for troops, "where tactical
considerations warrant," into its 1957 resolution, "The
Class Struggle Road to Negro Equality.“ Although supported
by the majority, the troop slogan produced considerable unease
and some minority opposition in the party.

BIRMINGHAM, 1963: Once again, the federal government
did nothing during the months-long terror campaign of bomb-
ings directed against blacks and civil rights workers. After
a church bombing that took the lives of four black children,
Bir1ni;1g‘hzu;n'S blacks, who had already fought rampaging state
troopers and deputized racists in the streets, refused any

-20-

 

 

 

longer to cower "nonviolently" and began to establish armed
street patrols and observation posts in the ghetto for self-
defense. Ray Wilkins of the NAACP caught the situation when
he declared: ‘if there is an incident there, I shudder to think
what will happen because they will‘ not—the great rank and
file will not-—acr:e'ie to the fine discipline of King" (:;uO|'e;‘.
in New York Times, 19 May 1963). It was the sight of enraged
blacks in armed patrols and apprehension over the pI‘:).Sp:‘:CtS
of a failure of the nonviolent movement that provoked Kennedy
to deploy troops to Alabama (reported in New York Times,
14 May 1963). The good Rev. M.L. King, who had promised
the city's white businessmen that the blacks would refrain
from mass demonstrations, welcomed Kennedy's intervention.

The SWP, now in full flight from revolutionary Marxism,
adopted a centrist position of calling upon Kennedy “to
deputize these Negro self-defense guards and send federal
troops to occupy Alabama“ (Militant, 23. September 1963).
The role of federal troops, from the Detroit race riot of
1943 to the Detroit ghetto uprising of 1967, is to suppress and
disarm the black people. Martial law means the rule of the
military and the military only. The very suggestion that the
capitalists‘ army might occupy Alabama in order to hold
down the racists while deputizing armed blacks is a clear
indication of the extent of the SWP's revisionism on the funda-
mental question of the nature of the capitalist state.

SELMA, 1965: The fight in Selma for black voter registra-
tion provoked a fierce racist onslaught. After weeks of racist
violence, including attacks by state troopers on a demonstra-
tion /and an attempted march to Montgomery, King and the
Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee demanded that
President Johnson send the army into Selma.

The now-reformist SWP/YSA, uncritically enthusing over
the liberal civil rights leaders, hurled aside even the pretense
of a revolutionary perspective and revealed its undisguised
liberalism: "Instead of sending troops to Vietnam where they
are trampling upon the rights and lives of the Vietnamese,
troops should be sent to Selma and other parts of the South
to protect the constitutional rights of Negroes" (Militant,
22 March 1965). This declaration is an open repudiation of
Marxism. According to the SWP/YSA, the same troops-
at that time the Marines and elite Special Forces!—who
"are trampling upon the rights and lives of the Vietnamese"
in far-away Asia can change their class character and
"protect the constitutional rights of Negroes" if brought
home and put under mass pressure.

But how did Uncle Sam's troops "protect" the Selma-to-
Montgomery freedom march? One night, as the marchers

-21..

 

slept surrounded by the troops, a brick was thrown into the
camp. According to all evidence and opinion, the brick could
only have been thrown by one of the soldiers. Simply by luck
was no one killed.

When the marchers finally reached Montgomery for the
planned rally, the troops were precipitously withdrawn, leaving
the marchers to make their return journey home defenseless.
One of the marchers, Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, was murdered
while shuttling marchers from Montgomery to Selma. The
carload of racists who shot Liuzzo included Ku Klux Klansmen
and...an F.B.I. agent, Gary Rowe! This is how the armed
forces of the capitalist state "protect" the lives of those who
struggle for the most elementary democratic rights. And the
SWP/YSA wanted to unleash the brutalized, specially-trained
killers of the Special Forces to "protect the constitutional
rights of Negroes"! Furthermore, after the troops were with-
drawn, a reign of terror was opened against blacks in Alabama
and other parts of the South. Brother Camejo refers to the
results of the troop policy as a "terrific blow to racism in the
South."

At the time the SWP/YSA followed out its call for federal
troops to its logical conclusion and advocated-yes, this was
their position--a permanent military occupation of the South!
The Militant (29 March 1965) with headline emphasis de-
manded, "U.S. Troops Should Be Kept in Alabama." Only
hardened reformists who have repudiated the independent
mobilization of workers and the oppressed for self—defense,
who have abandoned-the class-struggle perspective for secur-
ing democratic rights, who have cast aside any program for
linking the civil rights struggle with militant labor strikes
against Jim Crow, sharecroppers' struggles and unionizing
drives, only these traitors can call for a military occupation
and martial law by the army of capitalism.

Spartacist and the Troops

From its inception as a political tendency born in principled
struggle against the revisionism of the SWP/YSA, the Sparta-
cist League has consistently opposed calling for federal troops
to intervene in the civil rights movement, ghetto rebellions
and militant black struggles. While still in the SWP/YSA, the
Revolutionary Tendency (precursor of the Sp-artacist League)
indicated its opposition to the party's slogans, "Federal
Troops to the South!" and "Kennedy—Deput.ize and Arm Birm-
ingham Negroesl," in its basic minority res-')1=iE:i3n on the
black question, "For Black Trotskyism" (SWP Discussion
Bulletin, Vol. 24, No. 30, July 1963). The supporters of the

-22-

___. .,-

 

—~———~r— —-—— V- .

 

Revolutionary Tendency in the YSA similarly came out "for
organized self-defense movements" and "against federal mili-
tary intervention, which always supports the status quo" in
their document, "The Negro Struggle and the Crisis of Lead-
ership" (YSA Discussion Bulletin, Vol. 7, No. 5, August 1963).

Following our unprincipled expulsion from the SWP/YSA,
the SL continued to call for organized self-defense and a
class-struggle perspective for the black civil rights movement,
at a time when the "official" civil rights leaderships and
their "left" toadies were preaching pacifism and reliance
on the government. The SL document "Black and Red" raised
the slogan, "For a Workers United Front Against Federal
Intervention,” and declared: "The demand for organized
self-defense must be counterposed to Federal intervention
which preserves Southern 'law and order‘ and the racist
status quo'' (Spartacist, May-June 1967).

During the past months of mounting crisis in Boston, the SL
and SYL have been the only outspoken and activist advocates
of a labor/black defense force to insure the implementation
and extension of the busing program and to protect the lives
and democratic rights of black people. We have continually
pointed out that such a defense force is both an urgent neces-
sity and a realizable possibility. We have directed calls to
Boston's pro-busing labor, black, community and socialist
organizations to use their influence and resources to mobilize
at once black people and their allies. The pent—up anger and
readiness to act on the part of Boston's blacks are obvious;
what is lacking is a militant leadership.

We have exposed the do-nothing, defeatist policy of the
black liberals, who shook their heads in despair and wrung
their hands in moral agony during the weeks of racist terror,
but who abruptly demanded federal troops only after blacks
began lashing out in retaliation and only after the residents
of Columbia Point took matters into their own hands and
organized a self-defense force. These liberals demanded
police "protection" for Columbia Point; so the cops swept
down on Columbia Point, occupied and vandalized the housing
projects, beat and arrested blacks. Cop intervention ended
the independent black defense effort, and kept the blacks
"nonviolent." What the cops did to Columbia Point is just
what federal troops would do to all black neighborhoods in
Boston.

In the course of its panegyric for the liberals‘ strategy,
the Militant feigns approval of the black defense initiative:
"The development of such Black self-defense organizations
may recur, and this would be a positive development. But
meanwhile the problem of school desegregation

-23..

in Boston and the need for federal troops remains.‘
If blacks, at literally the risk of their lives, can manage to
organize self-defense groups while under police or military
occupation, then the Militant perhaps can permit a detached
nod of approval for such a "positive" development. But is the
SWP/YSA actually calling for these groups? Absolutely not!
The SWP/YSA "meanwhile" is concerned only with trying to
climb into the lap of the liberals.

It is unclear if and when Ford will decide to move troops
into Boston. The bourgeoisie has indicated its opposition to
busing, and Ford may well believe that letting the Boston
situation deteriorate will produce an anti-busing backlash
among both whites and blacks‘. Furthermore, the Republicans
had the November elections to worry about, and Ford certainly
did not wish to add a military occupation of South Boston
and a repression of the ghettos to the albatross of Watergate
and the economy.

However, the racist mobilizations still continue, and the
need for a pro-busing offensive grows ever more urgent. The
liberal-SWP/YSA-CP stance of helpless reliance upon federal
troops is a strategy for defeat. Mountains of letters to Con-
gress and frequent passive-protest demonstrations will not
change the class character of the bosses‘ cops and army.
The SWP/YSA proposes to lead the oppressed into sure re-
pression and a possible bloodbath in order to "expose" the
Ford government.

The black masses and their allies must rely on their own
organizations and power. They must force their leaderships
to take action at once and begin to organize a labor/black
defense force. Only such a mobilization of the workers a.nd
oppressed can insure the implementation of the busing plan,
protect black people and rout the racists. The democratic
rights and lives of black people in Boston must not be
entrusted to the class enemy! I

Black Family Firebomhed
in chicagg

UAW Local
Sets Up
Labor/Black
Defense Guard

CHICAGO, April l8——C.B. Dennis, black UAW union member,
has been trying to move into the white neighborhood of
Broadview. His house was firebombed and stoned repeat-
edly. But tonight, like every night for the past week, the
Dennis family home is being protected by an integrated de-
fense guard of his union brothers. Local 6 of the United
Auto Workers, International Harvester, voted unanimously
at the membership meeting Sunday to set up the defense
guard.

At a time when there is a dramatic increase in racist
terror against blacks all across the country,the UAW Loca1’s
action is a powerful example of what can be done to stop
the nightriders. And it is the best possible answer to those
who preach reliance on the bourgeois cops by hiding behind
the despairing lament, "workers won't defend blacks against
racist attacks—there's no solution except to call on the
troops"!

The attacks, which have caused thousands of dollars‘
worth of damage to the house and prevented the family from
moving in, are part of a pattern of terror against blacks
in white areas here, where right-wingers have been trying
to stir up race hatred. In another neighborhood on the South-
west Side, four black families have been forced to live under
a virtual state of siege, with the National Socialist White

People's Party (Nazis) all but taking direct credit for the
firebombings.

The first volunteers from Lc.:al 6, including Local presi-
dent Norman Roth, were at posts outside the damaged house
within hours of the union meeting. C.B. Dennis, who is a
repairman at the Melrose Park III plant and has been working
there for 15 years, was interviewed at the house by Workers
Vanguard. He said he had been unable to get adequate police
protection.

"They said they would come by 20 minutes out of the hour.
But that's no protection at all,"Dennis told WV, observing
that patrols had been by only once in two hours that night.
"This is the best thing we could do," he said, referring to
the volunteer guards, "I was really proud of the union today.
I think it's a good thing." An older black worker who was
listening agreed, saying he could recall no similar action
by the Local in its history. He likened it to the defense
activities of the anti-eviction campaigns in which he had
participated in the 1930's.

The UAW Local's defense action received considerable
attention in Chicago. Articles appeared in both daily papers
on Monday, and Dennis and Local 6 officers were inter-
viewed on two television stations Monday evening. At least
three radio reports were also made.

On the second night, the union guards were heckled by
passers-by in the area, and a neighbor two doors down shouted
at them to "get the hell out“ of there. Another white resident,
however, had earlier come over to talk to Dennis for 20
minutes, expressing sympathy and pointing out that some of the
rocks had hit his house as well.

It is clear that the racial polarization runs deep but the
entire neighborhood has not been terrorized. Local 6 defense
volunteers speak in terms of the need to prevent another
Boston-type racist mobilization in Chicago. There have been
no new attacks as the teams of union volunteers have been
guarding the house daily. Members vow the guards will
remain "as long as necessary” to ensure that the family
is safely moved into the house.

The attacks on black families have mounted during an
organizing offensive by fascist and racist groupings in Chi-
cago. Besides the attacks on four black families on the
Southwest Side, there were earlier attacks on other families
in Broadview. The Nazi Party ran candidates for alderman in
five wards in the last elections, and the Ku Klux Klan has also
been actively organizing lately.

These scum thrive on the despair generated by heavy
inﬂation and unemployment in the working class, and their

-26..

 

efforts to divide the workers along race lines can only
benefit the employers. Resolute action such as that under-
taken by Local 6 could, if followed through and adopted by
the rest of the labor movement, prevent future attacks and
quickly lay the tiny but deadly dangerous fascist movement
in the grave where it belongs.

The third attack on the Dennis house, which occurred
two days prior to the union meeting, particularly incensed
many members of the Local. The motion to set up the
volunteer union defense guards was made by a member of the
Labor Struggle Caucus, which had distributed a newsletter in
the plant before the meeting calling for a militant response
to the wave of racist terror. The Labor Struggle Caucus
is a grouping in Local 6 with a class-struggle program which
has recently been active in successful. struggles against a
company leafletting ban in the plant. and against a move to
extend terms for local union officers to three years. Its
resolution at the Sunday meeting supported the "struggle for
integration of blacks in housing, education, and jobs," as
"vital interests of the entire working class,” and denounced
reliance on the police, who "serve the employers and cannot be
depended upon to defend the rights of blacks or of the trade
unions." The motion also called for defense activities to be
extended to the black families on the Southwest Side, as well
as Broadview.

Following the meeting, the Local issued-a special number
of “its newsletter. Although this was reportedly not very well
distributed, a special meeting held Tuesday night for volun-
teers was attended by 25 members from all political groupings
in the Local, as well as by a television crew, which filmed the
entire proceedings. President Roth chaired and took a lot of
criticism for the inefficient distribution of the special Local
newsletter which, it was said, kept the meeting from being
larger.

He also relented under pressure on his earlier objection
to the formation of a special committee to organize the‘ defense
guards. A steering committee was then set up under the chair-
manship of the by-laws committee chairman. It includes two
members of the Labor Struggle Caucus, a member of the
syndicalist Workers Voice group, and other Local members.
Members of the steering committee immediately began signing
up volunteers in the plant.

Support for the defense activity was forthcoming, at least
verbally, from the UAW officialdom in the area, including
regional director Robert Johnston. The special Local news-
letter asserted, “These efforts are in accord with our UAW
principles and policies."

-27..

On the other hand, the UAW officials seemed primarily
concerned to get government officials to intervene, thereby
relieving the union of its responsibility. At the Dennis house
on Sunday night, Roth told WV of his intention ‘to exert every
political pressure possible to try to get the authorities to do
something.” He further claimed that "In some instances,
the police have given some protection.‘

Roth, who is a prominent supporter of Trade Unionists for
Action and Democracy, the trade-union group backed by the
reformist Communist Party, not surprisingly places confidence
in the bosses‘ state. Yet neither courts, cops, troops nor
National Guard will protect blacks against racist victimization.
This can be clearly seen in the Boston situation, where the
courts are conciliating the racists and have taken a giant
step backward on the busing plan.

In Boston there have been two sharply counterposed lines on
how to defend the endangered blacks from racist attack. On
the one hand there are the liberals, joined by the Communist
Party and Socialist Workers Party, who have called for
federal troops. Against this dead-end reliance on the armed
forces of the capitalist state, the Spartacist League has called
for integrated working-class defense. Both in Chicago and
Boston or elsewhere, labor/black defense guards could quickly
eliminate racist terrorists, neutralize wavering elements in
the white population and eventually defuse racist mobilizations.

The Local 6 action could be the start of a general initiation
of militant, class—struggle response to racist terror in the
Chicago area, but only if the whole Local, leadership included,
works to undertake it seriously and spread the idea to other
locals. If the Local 6 leadership instead spreads illusions in
the state, the way will be left open for a worsening racial
polarization. The guard must not be ended prematurely, on
the advice or promise of the cops or city officials that defense
will be provided by the state.

The recent action of the Local 6 members stands as an
inspiring example for all trade unionists and black militants:
black and white workers can unite and organize to fend off
racist terror. It will take an all-sided fight for class-
struggle policies and leadership throughout the labor movement
to turn this example into the rule. But an important beginning
has been made.l

Revolutionary Union
Capitulates to Racism

 

The response of the so—-called left to the Boston busing
crisis has been no better than the liberals‘, and in the case
of the Maoist Revolutionary Union (RU) even worse. The Octo-
ber issue of Revolution boasts the almost-unbelievable headline,
"People Must Unite to Smash Boston Busing Plan"! In the most
despicable capitulation to white racism, the lead article at great
length and with great understanding seeks to "explain" all the
motivations of the anti-busing school—boycotters, denouncing as
"liberal" all talk of "backward, racist whites," denouncing as
"reactionary" the "absurd line that the ‘only issue‘ in the white
boycott in South Boston is racism, " and denouncing as "defeatist
and divisive" the line that "the main issue now is racism." You
see, only "some  white parents had been influenced by the
racist arguments."

The RU denounces busing as an "issue which heightens the
contradictions of people of different nationalities" andcounter-
poses "community control" of the schools. But "community
control"-—the right of whites to keep blacks out of their schools
and neighborh0ods—is exactly what the racists are demanding in
Boston! Because busing provokes the racists, the RU turns its
back on the blacks in order to appease the white racists. In its
disgusting workerist capitulation to backwardness in the work-
ing class, the RU has consistently refused to struggle against
special oppression and for democratic rights of women (the
Equal Rights Amendment) and blacks (busing). I

SYL Builds
Anti-Nazi
Demonstration

SAN FRANCISCO—-On March 10 some 150 people responded to
a clarion call for amass demonstration to protest the scheduled
appearance of Nazi party members on the San Francisco State
University campus. Students as well as workers from the area
joined the militant picket line which was organized by the "Ad
Hoc Committee to Stop the Fascists," a united front initiated
and energetically built by the Spartacus Youth League. The
angry demonstrators not only physically confronted the Nazis,
but succeeded in driving the fascist vermin off campus!
The Nazis (National Socialist White People's Party) had been

-30..

 

 

 

invited to present their "point of view" to a debate class,
"Issues and Advocacy," conducted by Ted Keller, aleft-liberal
professor. When SYL members in the class learned of the
invitation, the SYL at SF State immediately launched an all—out
campaign for a demonstration against the appearance of these
racist killers on campus. On February 28 the SYL distributed
flyers and leaflets announcing the formation of a united-front
"Ad Hoc Committee to Stop the Fascists" (CSF) and calling
for a meeting to plan a protest demonstration around the
demand, "N0 PLATFORM FOR FASCISTSI" The SYL in addi-
tion made two presentations to Keller's class strongly arguing
against "free speech" for degenerate, murderous, fascist slime.

How to Deal with Fascists

A fascist movement can mushroom in conditions of acute
capitalist crisis when the working class is unable to throw off
its pro-capitalist reformist misleaders and resolve the social
impasse through socialist revolution. An extra-parliamentary
extremist movement, fascism appeals to the frustrated desire
of the petty bourgeoisie for economic stability and offers the
bourgeoisie, as its last desperateresort, the ultimate weapon
for smashing the workers movement. The Nazis are a para-
military organization in the service of extreme capitalist
reaction.

Unlike right-wing propaganda groups (John Birch Society),
conservative bourgeois politicians (George Wallace) or reac-
tionary academic ideologues (William Shockley), fascists like
the Nazis and Ku Klux Klan are armed thugs in political garb
who are dedicated above all to action: the genocide of racial,
ethnic and religious minorities; the totalitarian suppression of
bourgeois-democratic rights; and the annihilation of the
organized socialist and labor movement. As long as they are
still an isolated sect in this country, the Nazis sometimes
pretend that they too are interested in "discussing" their
"ideas." But smelling the stench of racist reaction, these
scum are more brazen about raising their heads.»

These maggots have swarmed to racially polarized Boston
not to "discuss," but to foment the savage slaughter of black
schoolchildren. Nazi propaganda for frenzied white racists is
a call to action:

"Boating, Not Busing. Or should we do some KILLING? Should
we cut off, root and branch, the satanic Jews and all their
lackies who are stirring up the n--—--s against us? . . . There
might be school buses going up in smoke all over the country."

—leaflet of National Socialist White People's Party (Bay Area)

In Los Angeles recently the National Socialist Liberation Front

-31-

 

 

     

has claimed credit for attacking leftist bookstores. Their
‘argument’: dynamite.

Fascist movements grow not through political campaigning
but through terror, murder, and eventually concentration
campus and gas chambers. The Nazis win their arguments with
blood and prove their points with genocide. They yearn for the
day when they can exterminate their opponents and victims. We
recognize no democratic rights for Nazis. There is nothing to
debate with these racist monsters! Action must be met with
action! The Nazis must be stopped!

As the Trotskyist "Transitional Program spells out so
forcefully, only a united, militant labor-led mobilization can
deal decisively with the racist swine:

"The struggle against fascism does not start in the liberal
editorial office but in the factory-and ends in the street. . . . In
connection with every strike and street demonstration, it is
imperative to propagate the necessity of creating workers’
groups for self-defense. It is necessary to write this slogan
‘into the program of the revolutionary wing of the trade
unions. . . . It is necessary to advance the slogan of a workers’
militia as the one serious guarantee for the inviolability of
workers’ organizations, meetings and press."

It is necessary, again in the words of the Transitional Program,
"to inflict a series of tactical defeats upon the armed thugs of
counter-revolution.“ Depending on the relationship of forces,
left organizations or groups of militants in certain situations
may correctly decide to take upon themselves the suppression
of fascist meetings and demonstrations. But communists must
dissuade anti-fascist militants from adventurist confronta-
tionism which substitutes for the necessary perspective of
struggling to mobilize the masses against the fascists.

We warn that no confidence should be placed in the bosses‘
cops to restrain or stop the fascist bands. Time after time
the racist cops have demonstrated their sympathy andleniency
toward the Nazis and KKK; there are frequently intimate
links between fascists and the local police, especially in the
South. Reliance upon the cops to disband and stop the fascists
is an invitation to murder. These racist killers must be made
to fear the consequences of creeping forth and spewing their
poison! ‘

United Front Gathers Support

Stressing the need for the largest possible mobilization,
the SYL actively solicited endorsements for the CSF and
commitments to participate in the disciplined demonstration
from a broad range of student, left and labor organizations

-32-

 

 

 

on campus and in the Bay Area. In addition to the Spartacist
League/SYL, endorsements were obtained from the Committee
for Working Class Studies, Socialist League (Democratic-
Centralist), Laney College Black Student Union, Center for
Peace and Social Justice, Service Employees Union Local
411 (the SF State campus workers union), Committee for a
Militant UAW/ Local 1364, Militant Action Caucus of the CWA,
the Militant Caucus/ Local 6 and Longshore Mz'lz'tant/ Local
10 of the ILWU, ' as well as individual, recognized labor
militants. ’

The other self-proclaimed "socialist" organizations on
campus responded to the principled united-front call of the
growing CSF with either sectarian adventurism or cowardly
abstentionism. The muddled Stalinites of the Progressive
Labor Party (PL) did vigorously campaign in their own name
to prevent. the fascists from speaking on campus. Opposed
to joining in united-front actions with Trotskyists, PL at-
tempted to outmaneuver the CSF with hyper-militant rhe-
torical one-upmanship.

Echoing its Stalinist mentors who spurned the Trotskyists'
call for a working-class united front against the Nazis in the
early 1930's with the fatal “Third Period” position that the
German Social Democrats and liberals were "social fascists,"
PL claimed that fascism is already in power today and thus
there is no difference between the Nazis and SF State Presi-
dent Romberg. PL resorts to this "Third Period" Stalinist
"go—it,-alone" sectarianism and ultra-militant rhetoric to
cover its abject Popular Front Stalinist class collaborationism:
"fighting racism” by liquidating into liberal front groups to
"fight" racist textbooks; "fighting" for 30-for-40 by running
candidates in the Democratic Party primaries and petitioning
for electoral referenda; and glorifying the imperialist Second
World War as a peoples‘ war "to defeat Nazism.“ Prevented
by their Stalinism from linking programmatically the fight
against racial oppression with the struggle for socialist
revolution, PL must stumble along with schizophrenic gyra-
tions of reformism and ultra-leftism.

Although the hardened reformists of the Socialist Workers
Party/Young Socialist Alliance (SWP/YSA) crow about opposing
racism and fighting for civil rights, these cynical ex-Trotskyists
are presently interested only in organizing respectable, pacifist
conventions and desultory rallies for liberal politicians and
bourgeois-legalistic organizations such as the NAACP. In the
past the SWP/YSA liquidated into the various petty-bourgeois
radical protest movements, declaring that "consistent" stu-
dentism, feminism and nationalism equal socialism. Lately,
however, the line of the SWP/YSA appears to be that "consis-

-33-

 

tent‘ Uncle Tom liberalism equals socialism! ‘

Thus, _it should come as no surprise that these "socialists"
simply ignored the campaign _against the Nazis, the most
vicious killers of black people. The problem with the "ostrich
position,“ comrades of the SWP/YSA, is that when you stick
your head in the sand, another part of your anatomy is
quite prominent.

The feminists of the women's center at SF State refused
to endorse the CSF, because a demonstration against the
Nazis, whose slogan for women is Kinder, Kﬁche, Kirche
(children, the kitchen, the church), is supposedly a "male"
tactic! The Pan Africanists, according to one of their members
on campus, said they would let the whites fight it out. Their
nationalism prevents the Pan Africanists from following the
example of their black brothers at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill who mobilized and prevented IG(K
leader David ‘Duke from performing there in January.

CSF Leads Militant Demonstration’

The anti-Nazi demonstration called by the CSF drew some
150 students and workers into a well-disciplined picket line in

- front of the building where the Nazis were scheduled to appear.

To their credit, supporters of PL joined the picket line, but the
Revolutionary Student Brigade held its "own" tiny rally about
200 yards away. In order to protect its sub-reformist politics
from any criticism or competing program, the RSB resorts
to such theatrical self—exclusionism.

After the demonstration had been in progress for about 45
minutes and the Nazis still were nowhere in sight, some ele-

 

ments, who had refused to join the united-front steering

committee, suddenly announced over a bullhorn that the
demonstration should enter the building. This splitting tactic was
irresponsible in the extreme, since a large number of people

packed into the narrow corridors and small classroom would ‘

virtually be unable physically to defend themselves should there
be an attack by the Nazis and cops.

The steering committee advised these demonstrators against
such an ill-considered tactic, but nonetheless many students
entered the building. They crowded into the corridor and packed
Keller's classroom, beginning what was to be a several-hours
long debate with Keller and the students in the class awaiting the
Nazis. Keller announced that the Nazis would not appear and the
class was cancelled.

When it was announced sometime later that the Nazis still
had not arrived, the large SYL contingent left the area in order

to go directly to the Berkeley campus for an anti—ROTC
demonstration scheduled for 2:00 p.m.

Fascist Filth Found

The dwindling crowd inside the building continued the anti-
fascist chanting and arguments with the students who recognized
the Nazis‘ "right" of free speech. The comings and goings of the
press soon attracted their attention, and a rumor that the Nazis
were somewhere in the building began to circulate.

Investigation soon revealed that in fact the fascists were in
the building, hiding in anearby office! (The administration later
divulged that the Nazis had crept on campus without uniforms
and other fascist paraphernalia a full hour before the demon-
stration had begun and then took refuge in their lair.)

The remaining group of demonstrators rushed to the room
and began to pound on the barricaded door. A squad of campus
and local cops were protecting the seven fascists inside. After
some time, the door suddenly opened, and the Nazis, surrounded
by a beefy cordon of pushing cops, made a bee line for their
getaway van, waiting nearby with motor running.

Fortunately, several students were able to land a few blows
to the scurrying rodents, and one was even flattened out on
the pavement. In the melee one ofthese thugs clubbed a student
with a portable fire extinguisher and then sprayed its chemical

contents in his face. Only with the eager aid of a rear guard of
club-swinging cops were the fascists able to pile into their van
and execute their escape.

Administration Prepares for Repression

For the next several days the campus and local press were
filled with coverage, photographs and editorials on the demon-
stration. The SF State administration as well as some faculty
and students have raised a hue and cry over the denial of "free
speech“ to the Nazis by the CSF and others. SF President
Romberg has already begun an "investigation" into "the demon-
stration, and the Faculty Academic Senate and Associated
Students Judicial Committee have announced that they may hold
hearings. Even Professor Keller has issued a 12(1)-page
polemical attack on the SYL and PL which is strongly tinged
with anti-communism.

The Dean of Student Affairs on March 17 sent letters to
every student registered in the ‘Issues and Advocacy" class,
soliciting "a statement which you feel may be helpful to us in
our endeavor to prevent the interference of academic freedom."
A formal complaint has already been filed against the SYL and
PL with the Judicial Committee (Zenger’s, 19 March 1975).
Anti-left petitions are circulating and the Academic Freedom
Committee has released a formal statement condemning the
action. The administration is clearly preparing to attempt to
prosecute and ban the SYL and PL.

The SYL issued a leaflet the day following the demonstration
which strongly solidarized with the effort to pummel the
fascists: "The entire Bay Area workers‘ movement should
applaud the efforts of the students here at State for teaching the
Nazis this well-deserved lesson." We declared that "The
Spartacus Youth League is glad to accept responsibility as the
initiators of the Ad. Hoc Committee to Stop the Fascists which
set up the picket line demonstration." '

RSB Spits on Demonstration
with Anti- Communism

When the anti-Nazi action galvanized the campus in an anti-
radical reaction, the RSB rushed to "unite with the many" and
let loose a vicious barrage of poisonous anti-communism against
the SY L and PL. The RSB distributed afour-page leaflet which
attacked

‘the Trotskyite Spartacus Youth League (SYL) and the ‘Progres-
sive' Labor Party ('P'LP), who proclaim themselves the New
Messiahs, THE leaders who have to either sucker, manipulate,

-35-

 

 

 

 

guilt trip, or intimidate the people into going along with them,

whether it's about the Nazis or others.‘
This is nothing but arepetitionby so-called "anti-imperialists"
of the bosses‘ filthy slander that communists "sucker" and
"manipulate," that is, dupe, their followers. This treacherous
anti-communism will always be used to persecute andframe up
communist militants.

These Maoists even stoop to attack the SYL for having a
working-class perspective! The RSB hisses,

“the SYL also shows its contempt for the people, especially

contempt for students, by calling on ‘working-class elements,‘

using a 'workers-are-everything-students-are-nothing‘ line as

a club to beat the student movement down."
The working-class politics of the SYL have thrown the RSB
into an openly’ anti-working-class fit, which thoroughly exposes
these self-styled "left" Maoists. Neither in this leaﬂet, nor in
its -leaflet for the demonstration, has the RSB as much as
mentioned—not once!-the working class. To make itself
acceptable to bourgeois public opinion, the RSB wallows in
liberal-populism, always identifying politically with
"the people."

The RSB has done everything to dissociate itself from the
militant demonstration and everything to convince the campus
that it is really with "the masses of students and American
people‘:

‘So in the guise of ‘the Left,‘ both the 'P'LP and the SYL

,actually scare people away, pimping on the righteous anger
students had about the brownshirts coming to campus and
turning this anger into its opposite—anger against what people
think are 'revolutionaries,' lumping the BRIGADE in the
same camp.‘

We are-not "pimping" revolutionaries like them! , cries the
RSB. Anyone in the RSB serious about struggling to become a
communist must reject this anti-communist pus and the
Maoist syphilis which has produced it.

YSA’s Finger-wagging Liberalism

The YSA at SF State did absolutely nothing to protest the
appearance of fascists on campus, but was quick on the draw
when the militant demonstration presented itself as a target.
In a letter to the campus press (Zenger's, 19 March 1975),
the YSA blasted the anti-fascist demonstration as "unfortunate,'
'?counterproductive" and a ‘disruption.’ What would the YSA
have us do? The ‘only way" is: ‘To stop the Nazis from speak-
ing, the campus majority has to be won to that point of view

-37-

through an educational campaign‘! But the SWP/YSA has
demonstrated that it has no commitment ‘to stop the Nazis
from speaking" when in fact it has debated with the fascist KKK
on television in Houston!

The letter points out that the SWP/YSA will fight fascist
attacks, such as the recent Nazi bombing of their bookstore in
Los Angeles, by appealing to the cops ("bring pressure on the
Los Angeles authorities‘). Reliance upon the fascists‘
"brothers in blue" is the only way these reformists respond to
the racist killers. Yet the letter does state that the YSA will
defend any anti-fascist demonstrator from possible reprisals.

No Reprisals!

The SYL has stood firm in the faceof threatened repression
and has initiated the “March 10 Defense Committee“ to fight any
reprisals taken against anyone—excluding the Nazis—charged in
connection with the anti-fascist demonstration. Two adminis-
trators from the student affairs department attended the first
defense meeting and indicated that they would not provide the
SF State administration with any information that could
potentially implicate any student in the demonstration. The SYL
has held a forum on campus, has begun circulating a petition
demanding no reprisals and has sent letters to scores of Bay
Area trade unions appealing for support in the defense cam-
paign. Professor Keller signed the defense petition and told
SYL members that he plans to write a statement opposing
reprisals. In the coming weeks the SYL will show the anti-
fascist film about gruesome Nazi atrocities, "Night and Fog,"
as one means to build for a demonstration on campus.

SWP/YSA 
Defends “Right”

of Free Speech
for Fascist Scum!

At San Francisco State University on March 10 a united-
front demonstration initiated and largely built by the Spartacus
Youth League under the slogan “No Platform for Fascists!"
confronted and drove off campus a gang of Nazis, who unfortu-
nately had been invited to present their fascist "ideas" before a
speech class. The Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), youth group
of the reformist Socialist Workers Party (SW15), not only did
absolutely nothing to protest the appearance of the fascists, but
chiming in with the administration even denounced the well-
publicized militant demonstration as "unfortunate," "counter-
productive" and a "disruption"!
During the night of April 23, the YSA's office at Cleveland
State University was ransacked and vandalized by fascist hood-
lums, who left behind threatening signs carrying racist, anti-
Semitic and anti-communist slogans. The SYL at CSU immedi-
ately called for a broad united-front protest demonstration
- around the slogans "For United Defense Against Fascist
Attack!“ and "Down With Fascist Scum!" The YSA not only ,
refused to endorse or even participate in the April 29 demon- . 
, stration held in its defense, but actively sought to sabotage it, ‘
attempting to dissuade endorsers from attending and harassing
the SY L. Failing in this, the YSA dashed off an indignant letter
to the campus press (Cauldron, 1 May), condemning the highly
visible demonstration as "meaningless"! As its response the
YSA called a press conference (the only press to attend was
Young Spartacus), where once again these social democrats
begged for the cops to protect them. [Foran example of how the
Cleveland cops "protect" civil liberties, see "Cleveland Killer
Cops Gun Down Black Youth" in Ysp No. 35, Sept. 1975.] ; -f,

In the past period the SYL has sharply exposed as craven
reformism and flabby civil libertarianism the SWP/YSA's
opposition to militant actions against the fascists and its
reliance upon the repressive arm of the bourgeois state for
protection. Apparently feeling the sting of our lashing polemical
criticism, the SWP/YSA in two lengthy articles (Young Socialist,
July-August 1975, and International Socialist Review, August
1975) recently has attacked the Spartacist League and SYL,
finally admitting and defending politically its demonstrated
attitude toward anti-fascist struggle.

With the hoary phrases_ of liberalism and pacifism the
SWP/YSA claims that since fascism is undemocratic, the con-
sistent championing of "democracy" is the most effective means
of combatting the fascist menace. These gas-bags and poltroons
wax eloquent in opposition to any infringement of the alleged
"rights" of the fascists, passionately arguing that

"an effective struggle against reactionary ideas and violence
cannot be carried out if one begins by placing qualifications on
democratic rights in the case of fascists. . .. Because of the
importance of democratic rights to the oppressed, the denial
of this right to racists or fascists can only backfire.‘
—-International Socialist Review, August 1975

Thus, the SWP/YSA respects the alleged "rights"offree speech
and assembly for fascists "without qualifications‘ (Young
Socialist, July-August 1975). Period.

No Platform for Fascist Scum!

The Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and other fascists are ultra-
reactionary armed thugs in semi-political garb who mobilize
for action: terrorization and genocide against black people and
J ews, smashing of the labor movement, extermination of com-
munists and totalitarian suppression of bourgeois-democratic
rights and institutions. Unlike conservative bourgeois politi-
cians ‘(George Wallace), right-wing propaganda groups (John
Birch Society) or reactionary academic charlatans (William
Shockley), fascist gangs represent an extra—parliamentary,
para-military extremist movement offering the bourgeoisie in
a period of extreme capitalist crisis the ultimate weapon for
smashing the workers movement.

Fascists are the sworn enemy of the working class and
racial, ethnic and religious minorities. Fascists recruit and
grow not through political campaigning, but through demonstra-
ting in action their intentions and strength. Today these racist
beasts torture and murder black people, lusting to herd millions
of black victims into gas chambers tomorrow. Today the fascist
sadists assault communists and even left-liberals, yearning

-40-

 

to fill concentration camps tomorrow. Fascist "speech" is a
call for destroying all rights for the labor movement and
annihilating black people and communists. While small in
numbers today, the fascists even now are dangerous. The very
fact that the fascists can rear their heads indicates a recep-
tivity or tolerance for their presence.

Unlike vulgar democrats, Marxists recognize no "right" of
free speech for fascists. The defense of the working class,
gentlemen of the SWP/YSA, can be assured only if the labor
movement "begins by placing qualifications on democratic
rights in the case of fascists." Upholding the "right" of
fascists to work for the destruction of the left and labor move-
ment "can only backfire." The labor movement never has
recognized the "right" of scabs to break strikes and starve out
striking workers. Likewise, labor does not respect the "right"
of fascists to pulverize working-class organizations and murder
the oppressed.

For socialists, denial of ‘civil liberties‘ for murderous
fascist gangs is a right of the labor movement, not the capi-
talist government. Any government ban against extremist
armed groups always will be used as a bludgeon against the
left, not the right. For every fascist persecuted by the state
thousands of labor militants and leftists will be victimized.

The SWP/YSA lectures us on this truism—knowing full well
that the SL/SYL has never once called upon the‘ state to ban or
otherwise curb the fascists—because these social democrats
seek to present a government ban as the only alternative to
recognizing "free speech for fascists." While championing the
"rights" of fascists, the SWP/YSA on more than one occasion
has appealed to the bourgeois authorities to deny democratic
rights for the left! Most recently, the YSA at Wayne State
University attempted to have the Progressive Labor Party
stripped of its status as a recognized student organization and
thrown off campus (see "YSA-Attempted Purge of PL
Strengthens Repression," Young Spartacus, July-August 1975).

SWP vs. SWP

Throughout the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's, the SWP, then a
genuinely revolutionary organization, continually warned
against granting any "democratic rights" for fascists. In the
1930's the first Trotskyist youth organization in this country,
the Spartacus Youth League (whose name we proudly have
taken as our own), polemicized against the position of civil
liberties ‘for all" advocated by the SocialDemocrats and many
liberals. With regard to the fascists, the SY L called for ‘Imme-
diate action to obstruct their ‘civil rights’ to assemble forces"

-41 -

 

 

(Young Spartacus, 12 October 1934). In its resolution, "The
Youth in the Struggle Against American Fascism" (Young
Spartacus, October 1934), the SYL likewise boldly asserted,
"Every right of the working class must be defended——every
right of the Fascists must be taken away by us.“

When in 1939 the SWP's call for a militant counterdemon-
stration to break up a fascist rally in Madison Square Garden
brought out 50,000 people and sent the civil-libertarian guard-
ians of "free speech for all" into a frenzy, the SWP responded
with the article "Should Fascists Be Allowed the Right of Free
Speech?" (Socialist Appeal, 3 March 1939), which concluded:

‘The ‘workers who spend all their time and energy in the
‘abstract discussion of the Nazis‘ ‘democratic rights'—to say
nothing of working themselves into a lather in defense of
these 'rights'—will end their discussion under a fascist club
in a concentration camp . . . . The wailing and weeping about the

Nazis‘ ‘rights’ can safely be left to the prissy Liberals and
phoney Democrats. The self-preservation of the working class
demands that it cut through all abstract chatter and smash
the fascist gangs by decisive and relentless action."

Fascists Fear No “Exposure” 1-

Today the SWP/YSA chatters that fascism should be com-
batted not by decisive and relentless action but by ideological
exposure: "What is needed are actions that can demoralize the
racists and politically isolate them by exposing the reactionary
character of their ideas“ (‘Young Socialist, July—August 1975).
As a model of such action the SWP/YSA proudly points to the
May 17 NAACP demonstration in Boston "in defense of the
Constitution, “ claiming that as a result of this and the December

14 demonstraﬁon "ROAR,has experienced adeclinein member-
ship and inﬂuence" (Young Socialist, July-August 1975).

One can hardly imagine a more foolish strategy or a more
brazen lie! In Boston the racists are not in retreat, but rather
are on the offensive [see article in Young Spartacus, No. 35,
Sept. 1975]. Far from "demoralizing" the racists, the May 17
rally was menacingly taunted by a small gang of self-confident
fascists. The SWP/YSA marshals in fact protected the fascists
from a formidable group ofdemonstrators, including supporters
of the SL/SYL and trade-union militants, until the cops arrived
to escort the fascists safely to the edge of the park. Shortly
later, a large number of demonstrators, enraged by the fascist
provocation, streamed toward the clot of fascists, driving
them out of the area entirely.

As Trotsky suggested, when the relationship of forces is
overwhelmingly against the fascists, anti-fascists should give
the scum a good "education":

‘The tactical, or if you will, ‘technical,’ task was quite
simple—grab every fascist or every isolated group of fascists
by their collars, acquaint them with the pavement a few times,
strip them of their fascist insignia and documents, and without
carrying things any further, leave them with their fright and
a few good black and blue marks."
—reprinted in Intercontinental Press, 2 December 1974

But the only "actions" advocated by the SWP/YSA are those
impotent protests called by the liberal NAACP and bourgeois
politicians which the SWP/YSA can tail. Although repeatedly
attacked by fascists, especially in Houston and Los Angeles, the
SWP/YSA has refused to call for any protest actions or to
attempt organizing self-defense measures, but instead has
preached reliance on the cops for protection. In Houston, the
SWP/YSA publicly proclaimed its refusal to resort to measures
of armed self-defense and called upon the KKK-infested Houston

. police to "stop despicable Ku Klux Klan from roaming the

streets," fostering the dangerous illusion that "the KKK is a
cowardly group who will crawl back into their holes at the first
sign of the police upholding the law against them" (SWP cam-
paign press release, 5 March 1975).

The sermonizing and impotent "mass actions‘? pushed by
the SWP/YSA today was the same strategy advocated by the
Stalinists and sellout trade-union bureaucrats inthe late 1930's
for fighting Jersey City Mayor Frank ("I am the law") Hague.
At the time SWP leader James P. Cannon devastated the argu-
ments about "exposing the reactionary character of his ideas”:

‘Fascism fears no ‘scandal’ and is not to be bluffed. It has to
be beaten down.

-44-

 

‘It is not sufficient to denounce Hague as a violator of the
Constitution and its Bill of Rights. These documents are sacred
only for the dupes of capitalist propaganda, not for the real
masters themselves. The workers in reality have only such
rights as they are ready and able to defend with their own
strength. Everything else under the subject of democratic
rights is a lie. Hague, the authentic American fascist, answers
all palaver with brutal force. For their part, the magnates of
industry and finance, alarmed by labor's aggressiveness of the
past few years, cannot fail to notice with satisfaction that all
the arguments in court and all the pious sermons and editorials
about the Constitution carry little weight against the fists and
clubs of I-lague's hoodlums. Force is the argument of the ‘advance
guard of American fascism. Woe to the workers of America if
they ‘to not learn in time to talk the same language!“ [emphasis
ours
—Socialist Appeal, 9 July 1938

SWP Turns the Other Cheek

The oh-so-respectable SWP/YSA today is categorically
opposed to using force against the fascists:

"Another argument used to justify a call for banning or physi-
cally breaking up reactionary meetings is that fascism can
thereby be ‘nipped in the bud,‘ or somehow stopped even before
it gets started.

‘For example, the Young Spartacus, publication of the SYL,
carried an article in its June 1975 issue that prominently
displayed in large letters a quote attributed to the German
fascist leader Joseph Goebbels: ‘If the enemy had known how
weak we were, it would probably have reduced us to jelly . . . . It
would have crushed in blood the very beginning of our work.‘
The implication is that that is precisely what should be
done today.‘

—-International Socialist Review, August 1975

When still a revolutionary party, the SWP always contended
that fascism could‘ and must be ‘nipped in the bud." Trotsky
hammered home this lesson over and over. When the workers
who pummeled the fascists at the 1939 Madison Square Garden
rally were denounced as "intolerant" by a chorus of liberals,
the Northwest Organizer (2 March 1939), newspaper of the
Trotskyist-led Teamsters Local 544 in Minneapolis, enthusias-
tically responded, "Three cheers for such intolerance!" Asfor
the Goebbels quote, from which the SWP/YSA today shrinks
aghast, this very same quotation—in bold print, mind you—was
used by none other than SWP leader Joseph Hansen in a 1939
article on fighting fascism (Socialist Appeal, 14 July 1939),
precisely for its "implication"!

Anti-Busing  
Forces

Must Be
Defeated!

On April 3 this year [1974] a crowd of 20,000, exclusively
white, demonstrated in Boston for repeal of the 1965 Massachu-
setts Racial Imbalance Act. After an eight-day delay the law was
finally slated for implementation through large-scale busing
of public school children, both in Boston proper and nearby
suburbs. In late July the Supreme Court, in a stunning reversal
of previous decisions, overturned by a 5-4 vote a lower court
ruling that children from the overwhelmingly black Detroit
inner city be bussed to the largely white suburbs. Not satisfied
with the Supreme Court's ban on cross-district busing, the
following week Congress passed the education budget bill with
an amendment barring the busing of a child beyond the
next-closest school.

The Supreme Court and Congressional actions effectively
cripple the racial integration of urban schools and go a long
way toward undoing the famous 1954 decision. The anti-busing
actions at the highest levels of government are major blows
against the democratic rights of black people.

White Backlash Whips Busing

The "white backlash," most dramatically evident in the
electoral successes of Alabama's populist/racist former
governor George Wallace, has long threatened to reverse
even the formal legal gains of the civil rights movement.

‘Opposition to school busing is the cutting edge of the white
backlash. The emotion-ridden issue played a central role in_

For Workers Defense Guards!

The experience of the SWP's anti-fascist campaign in the
late 1930's was codified in the Transitional Program, one of
the founding programmatic documents of the Fourth Interna-
tional. Denouncing the reformist SocialDemocrats and Stalinist
bureaucrats for hiding behind the "sacredness of democracy,”
the Transitional Program states:

"The struggle against fascism does not start in the liberal
editorial office but in the factory—and ends in the street. . . . In
connection with every strike and street demonstration, it is
imperative to propagate the necessity of creating workers’
groups for self-defense."

For years the SWP raised the slogan of workers defense
guards as the answer to fascist attacks. ‘Form Workers De-
fense Committeesl," "Labor Guard Must Answer Hague
Menace,” "Fight Fascism With Workers’ Guards!" and "Answer
Hague and Harvey with Workers‘ Defense" are the titles of
just a few of the many agitational articles published in the
Socialist Appeal and later in the Militant. Around the time of
the 1939 Madison Square Garden rally, several substantial
articles calling for workers defense guards were published
which stand as powerful polemics against the SWP and
NAACP today:

".. .the best of the workers must be organized into Workers
Defense Guards,’ prepared and trained to smash the fascist
gangs. There is no other way. The fascist gangs do not believe
in abiding by the results of the ballot-box, or by any other
peaceful procedure. On the contrary, the fascists plan to come
to power by physical violence against the labor movement and
anti-fascists generally. To appeal to ‘democracy’ against the
fascists is like trying to stop bullets with the biblical edict
‘Thou Shalt Not Ki1l."'
—Socialist Appeal, 14 March 1939

According to the SWP/YSA today, the only way to stop the

fascist gangs is by staging parades which are led by Bible-
quoting Uncle Toms and ballot-conscious bourgeois politicians
and which are kept peaceful, even in the face of fascist provo-
cation, by SWP/YSA marshals.

While the ability of socialist and labor militants to organize
defense guards or successfully disperse the fascists depends
on the level of class struggle and influence of the vanguard
party, Trotskyists always explain in our propaganda and
agitation that this strategy is the only way to guarantee the
defense of the workers and blackpeople from fascist and racist
attacks. During the 1930's and 1940's, when the SWP had
developed modest but significant roots in the labor movement,

-45-

 

 

the Trotskyists succeeded in organizing some union defense
guards, most notably the Union Defense Guard organized in
1938 by Teamsters Local 544 in Minneapolis. Other unions
also had‘ organized squads against fascists such as the rural-
based Silver Shirts; a Youngstown, Ohio, union defense guard
had the honor of breaking up a meeting of this organization.
The motto of the guard was "Offense is the best defense!" (re-
ported in Northwest Organizer, 24 November 1938).

When forced to address the question of labor/black defense
guards, the SWP/YSA today mutters that since such formations
do not now exist it would be "irresponsible" to call for them.
But even at the height of its isolation during the Mccarthyite
witchhunt, when the tasks of calling for and organizing workers
defense guards was tenfold more difficult, the SWP still
propagandistically explained the need for workers defense
guards. A 1954 SWP pamphlet, "Racist Terror at Trumbull
Park, Chicago," argued against the NAACP's criminal reliance
on the bourgeois government, as follows:

"The Socialist Workers Party knows the fascist attack can be
stopped at Trumbull Park. Not by depending on the bosses‘
representatives in City Hall-but by depending on the workers.
"No confidence in the bosses! No confidence in the bosses‘
parties! Confidence in 3. workers‘ demonstration! Confidence
in a workers‘ defense committee!"

Should
Fascists

Be Allowed
the Right of

Free Speech?

A Working Class Point of View on the Question That was
Brought to the Fore Again by the Professional Democrats-
When the Nazis Mobilized at the Garden

—Reprinted from
the Socialist Appeal,
3 March 1939

It seems that the only point of importance that the Pro-
fessional Liberals and Democrats could see in the big mobil-
ization of the Nazis at Madison Square Garden last week,
was their "right of free speech and assembly."

Mayor LaGuardia kept reiterating emphatically that his
attachment to Democracy compelled him to grant the Fascists
the right to hold their meeting and provide them with extra-
ordinary police protection.

The American Civil Liberties Union rushed into print to
insist that the right of free speech be extended to the
Hitlerites.

One of the numerous committees of the Jewish bourgeoisie,
anxious to demonstrate that it loves fairness above all else,
did likewise.

Even the wretched little Jewish anarchist weekly published
in New York indignantly reproached the Trotskyists for the

-43-

 

 

 

lack of sense in "demanding the right of free speech and
assembly for oneself and at the same time trying to prevent
the freedom of speech of our opponents . . ."

Freedom for Nazis But Not for Pickets

Before going further into the consideration of the question
of "free speech for Fascists,” it is interesting and important
to record the fact that all the above—mentioned who showed
such touching concern for the “democratic rights" of the Nazis,
are entirely unconcerned with the brutal police suppression
of the picketing rights of the workers who assembled outside
the Garden.

The Mayor simply refused to see a delegation which came
to protest against the violence of the police who rode down
and slugged the picketers.

The American Civil Liberties Union, apparently exhausted
by its noble efforts in behalf of the Nazis, didn't utter a peep
about the democratic rights of free speech, assembly and
picketing being denied the 50,000 anti-Fascists who came to
protest the Nazi rally. Ditto for the Jewish committee.

As for the anarchist Freie Arbeiter Stimme, it says not a
word about the police assaults, but villainously insinuates that
the Terrible Trotskyists were really at fault because, Mr.
Police Commissioner, they planned a violent attack on the
Nazis who were innocently celebrating Washington's Birthday.
Unbelievable, but here are its exact words: "But there are
times when people who endeavor to do social work, must reflect
ten times, a hundred times, before they come out with an
appeal for acts of violence.”

What the Problem Really Involves

The question of "democratic rights for the Nazis" cannot be
resolved on the basis of Liberal phrasemongers. All such a
discussion can produce is a bewildering tangle of words and
abstractions. At a more decisive stage, as all recent experi-
ence has proved, it produces a first class disaster not only for
the working class but also for the Professional Liberals and
Democrats themselves.

How many of them, indeed, are there in concentration
camps, in prison and in exile who are continuing the thorough-
ly futile and abstract discussion over whether or not the Fascist
gangsters should be granted the "democratic rights of free
speech and assembly"!

And what is most decisive—this is the point which leads us
directly to a solution of the problem that seems to agitate so

-49-

many people—is the fact that in Italy, in Germany, in Austria,
in Czechoslovakia, in Spain, the Democrats were so concerned
with preserving the ‘rights’ of the Fascists that they concen-
trated all their attacks and repressive measures upon those
workers and those labor organization which sought to conduct
a militant struggle against the Fascists and for the preserva-
tion and extension of their truly democratic rights and
institutions.

It is when the bourgeois "democrats" like Giolitti in Italy
and Bruening in Germany, had done all in their power to smash
the most progressive and active sections of the working
class—as LaGuardia and his police tried to do on a smaller
scale in New York last week—that the Fascists concluded
successfully their march to totalitarian power. Whoever
forgets this important lesson from abroad, is a fool. Whoever
tries to keep others ignorant of this lesson, is a rogue.

A Simple Example

Let us take a simple example which every worker has ex-
perienced dozens of times.

A strike is called. The authorities promptly jump into the
situation in order to protect the "democratic rights" of the
scabs and the company gunmen who guard them. The "right to
work" of the scab, which is guaranteed by the capitalist govern-
ment, amounts in reality to his "right" to starve out the striking
workers and reduce them to helpless pawns of the employers.

Millons of workers have learned the futility and deceptiveness
of the academic discussion of the scab's "democratic rights,"
as well as of appealing to the government and its police to
"arbitrate" the dispute involved. They try to solve the question,
"as they must, in the course of struggle. The workers throw their
picket-lines around the struck plant. The conflict between the
scab's ‘right’ to break a strike and the workers‘ right to live,
is also settled on the course of struggle—in favor of those who
plan better, organize better, and fight better.

Same Rule Applies. on Broader Scene

The same rule applies in the struggle against the much bigger
scab movement that Fascism represents.

The workers who spend all their time and energy in the ab-
stract discussion of the Nazis’ "democratic rights"—to say
nothing of working themselves into a lather in defense of these
"rights"—will end their discussion under a Fascist club in a
concentration camp.

The workers who delude themselves and waste their time

-50-

 

 

 

begging the capitalist Democrats in office to ‘act’ against the
Fascists, will end up in the same place, just as the workers of
Italy, Germany and Austria did.

The workers have more vital concerns. They are and should
be interested in defending and expanding their democratic rights.

‘But not in any abstract sense. These rights are the concrete

rights of free speech, assembly, press, the right to organize,
strike and picket, without which an independent working class
simply cannot exist.

A decaying capitalism—of which Fascism is only a natural
product—seeks constantly to restrict and destroy these rights,
which are not truly genuine even in ‘normal’ times. These
rights can only be defended from the assaultsof capitalism and
its ugly offspring, Fascism, in the same way in which they were

first acquired: by the tireless, aggressive, unbending, inde--

pendent struggle of the working class.

The wailing and weeping about the Nazis‘ "rights" can safely
be left to the prissy Liberals and the phoney Democrats.

The self-preservation of the working class demands that
it cut through all abstract chatter and smash the Fascist gangs
by decisive and relentless action.I

1,780 I.aGuardia
cops Protect
Nazis from
Workers’ Wrath

in Brutal Attack
on Demonstrators

—-Reprinted from
the Socialist Appeal,
24 February 1939

An imposing, fighting demonstration of fifty thousand
workers assembled near Madison Square Garden on Monday
evening to protest the first big fascist mobilization in New
York City.

In addition to the fifty thousand demonstrators who responded
to the call of the Socialist Workers Party for a labor rally
against the fascist concentration, official police estimates
given to the press counted another fifty thousand among the
spectators. With few exceptions, the latter made clear their
sympathy with the aims and slogans of the demonstrating
thousands. With a brutality recalling the days of Czarist
Cossacks, 1,780 of Mayor LaGuardia's police, the largest num-
ber of cops ever collected in the city against a single demon-
stration, slugged and trampled under horses’ hooves scores
of workers in an unsuccessful attempt to break up the demon-
stration. From 6 pm until 11, the workers engaged in a series
of bitter clashes with the police.

Size Exceeds All Hopes

The size of the workers‘ counter-demonstration far exceeded

-52-

 

 

the expectations of even the most optimistic.

Efforts had been made on all hands, prior to the Nazi meet-
ing, to minimize the significance of the call issued by the
Socialist Workers Party, to smother it by a campaign of
silence, and to sabotage it directly.

Supercilious critics of the "Trotskyists" in the social-
democratic camp sought to dispose of the counter-
demonstration by ridicule and disdainful talk of our alleged
insignificance. Neither the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas
nor the Social-Democratic Federation would take any cognizance
of the call for the demonstration, much less endorse it. They
were nowhere to be found in the demonstration.

CP Role Despicable

The Stalinists played a particularly despicable role, which
aroused widespread bewilderment and confusion in their own
ranks, which contain thousands of workers who really want to
fight against Fascism.

On the day of the demonstration, all that the Daily Worker
had to say was its report of a speech in favor of democracy by
acting Mayor Newbold Morris. Not a single word about the
"Trotskyists," or their call. It would have been a little em-
barrassing even to such brazen pen-slaves as Stalin employs
in New York to write, on this occasion, diatribes against the
"Trotsky-fascists"! . . .

Rankyand File Comes

Rank and file Stalinists, perplexed and irritated by the
criminal sabotage of their officialdom, but nevertheless deter-
mined to demonstrate "unofficially" against the Nazis, whom
they realize to be the menace they are, came to our rally by

 the thousands.

No less gratifying was the fact that one of the banners borne
in the demonstration signified that the youth organization of the
Thomasite Socialist Party had come to the anti—Nazi rally in
spite of the shabby indifference of the party elders.

Equally inspiring was the contingent of Negro workers who
came spontaneously to the tumultuous gathering, bearing their
own posters and placards, including one signed by the Univer-
sal Negro Improvement Association. . . .

Thousands Cheer SWP

The placards and posters of the Socialist Workers Party
were uplifted amid the cheers of thousands. Almost simultan-

-53-

 

eously, on both streets, which by this time were choked to
capacity by huge crowds reaching from Broadway to 8th Avenue,
a spontaneous drive was launched to get through the police
lines and into the immediate Garden area.

Action began on 48th Street. From the corner of 8th Avenue
where a solid line of mounted cops was stationed, stirrup to
stirrup, they made a furious attack on the assembled demon-
strators. Moving in both directions, one group of cops trampled
down a throng of patriotic war veterans and cut their big
American flag to ribbons, while another group smashed
brutally into the mass of workers.

Masses Reform Ranks

Although the Cossacks made repeated sallies into the work-
ers’ crowd, the mass formed and reformed, stoutly determined
to hold their own until they gathered sufficient strength to
exercize their right to assemble and to picket whether the cops
granted it or not. . . . ,

. . . even a large gathering of workers cannot easily attain
its objective unless these workers have been organized tho-
roughly in advance and trained’ to act in sharp coordination.
It was evident, in other words, that for the complete success
of such a demonstration a militant, organized WorkersDefense
Guard is indispensable. . . .

Cops Attack

Just as the head of the march reached 47th Street, it ran
smack into a newly-formed line of cops. Without a word of
warning, they plunged into the parade, mounted cops in the
lead, with rows of foot cops behind them. The horses were
driven straight into the ranks of the marchers, first in the
center of the street and then on the sidewalks. Shop windows
were shattered to smithereens, and workers wounded by the
jagged splinters. Others went down under the horses, as is
so graphically revealed by the sensational photographs which
were published in the press. Clubs were drawn and swung
freely and viciously.

This was not in Czarist Moscow, in Hitler's Berlin or
Mussolini's Rome. No! This took place in the domain of "demo-
cratic" New York, under the administration of "progressive"
Mayor LaGuardia, successful candidate of the American Labor
Party in the last election!

Notwithstanding the assault, the lines of the march were
still re-formed. The parade turned down 47th Street and pro-
ceeded once more to Broadway. There a fresh attempt was

made to organize ameeting at the Duﬂyuomiment. But another
police concentration was on hand and aviolent struggle ensued.

The workers refused to be shoved around. They had seen
many of their comrades seriously injured audbeaten, When the
police sought to disperse the marchers, they encouxiteredthe

stiffest resistance.

March Terminates

Finally, after breaking through the police line, the crowd
drove through to 49th Street, where the march was terminated

by an announcement from an SWP speaker whom thetpolice,,

helplessly trying to break through the firm block of workers,
sought in vain to reach so that he could be torn down from
the taxicab he had mounted in order to address the‘ marchers. . .-

both Wallace's and Nixon's 1972 presidential campaigns.
And at the lower political levels a new generation of racist
demagogues, typified by Boston‘-s Louise Day Hicks, has risen
to prominence on the anti-busing campaign.

The first major attempt to legally reverse court-ordered
busing was Nixon's 1972 education bill. Passed by the House,
it was killed by a filibuster of Senate liberals. This election
year, however, poll-conscious liberals have unceremoniously
decamped from their earlier half-hearted support for busing.
Already smelling a Republican rout in November in the wake
of Watergate, the Democrats will do just about anything to
prevent school integration from again becoming an embar-
rassing campaign issue. Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield arranged the "compromise" to eliminate the ex-
pansion of busing, while letting past court orders stand.

In the face of the racist reaction to integration, the black
political establishment in the main has surrendered, reverting

' to the politics of Booker T. Washington. At least on the critical

school question, prominent black politicians are prepared to
support de facto segregation in return for more patronage. On
hearing the Supreme Court ruling, Detroit mayor Coleman
Young stated, "I shed no great tears for cross-district busing,”
and then demanded more educational money for his admin-
istration (New York Times, 26 July). The Black Caucus of
the Massachusetts State Legislature indicated its willingness
to support repeal of the Racial Imbalance Act in return for
some kind of "community control" patronage deal.

Although totally inadequate even as a solution to school
segregation, busing is at least a minimal attempt to allow the
black poor a share in the benefits of white American society.
Moreover, busing has become a symbol in the struggle against
black oppression in general. If the anti-busing campaign is
successful, if the Hicks, Wallaces and Fords win on this
question, it will greatly encourage the forces of racist reac-
tion to turn the calendar back before 1954 at every level‘. The
successful drive in state legislatures to restore the death
penalty and the Supreme Court's recent reactionary rulings
on prisoner rights are part of the same rightward political
motion reflected in the Congressional anti-busing stand and
Supreme Court ruling. ‘

Apart from its importance as a democratic issue and its
limited but tangible contribution to the quality of education
available to the black poor, there is a further reason that
proletarian revolutionaries must support busing. It is des-
perately necessary to use all means possible to break the
black masses out of the social isolation of the ghetto. The
hard race line in this country, stronger on the personal level

Ohio Union
Guard Bouts
Fascists

Reprinted from
the Northwest Organizer,
24 November 1938

A company of union defense guards, made up of unionists
from Youngstown, Ohio, had the honor of leading the first
victorious assault on the fascist Silver Shirts when the boss-
supported labor-haters sought to hold a meeting last Thurs-
day in Sharon.

Sharon is 14 miles from Youngstown. Roy Zachary, national
commander of the Silver Shirts, appeared in Sharon Thursday
to speak before a scheduled meeting of his group.

The Silver Shirts had arranged some time ago to hold
their meeting in the local Moose Hall, but without announcing
the sponsorship of the meeting. When the Silver Shirts arrived
around 8 p.m., lodge officers revoked the permit for the
meeting.

A fascist who had wormed his way into the Carpenters‘
union then suggested that the meeting be held in the nearby
Carpenters‘ Hall. The Silver Shirts went there and started
their meeting.

The meeting had no sooner got under way than 10 carloads
of union guards arrived from Youngstown, dashed up the stairs
and stormed the meeting.

Storm the Hall

As the doors and windows were being battered down, several
squads of cops rushed in to protect the Silver Shirts. The
union guards circled the building and prepared to storm it
from the rear. At this point, two officials of the Carpenters

-55-

 

 

Union arrived and ordered the Silver Shirts out of the building.

Cops Protect Fascists

Quaking, the Silver Shirts quickly stole out of the building
and were escorted to their cars by the cops as the union
pickets hurled their hatred; atthe local Hitlerites. ,

"Union members in this area,‘ writes one of the union
guards, ‘are determined that the Silver Shirts shall hold no
meetings. The effectiveness of our swift ac_tion in the Sharon
case is shown by the fact that the Silver Shirts called off
a scheduled meeting in Newcastle, Pennsylvania, the following
night. Definite steps are being taken to organize union defense
squads after the pattern of the Minneapolis unions for the
protection of the union movement against any attacks from the
employers‘ stooge vigilante organization, the Silver Shirts.
Our motto is ‘Offense is the best defense!” .

The stalwart union defense guards of Youngstown, Ohio,
have given a magnificent and inspiring demonstration of labor's
resolve that the United States shall not go the way of Germany,
Italy, Austria and the Balkans. Labor everywhere must ener-
getically set about to build the union defense guard and smash

.the Silver Shirted rats wherever they show their heads. We

hail the Youngstown ‘union guard! I

Minneapolis
Picket Line
Smashes
Fascist Rally

—-Reprinted from the
Militant, 31 August 1946

Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 22—A united labor movement stopped
Fascist Gerald L. K. Smith from speaking last night in
Minneapolis. More than 1,500 pickets from AFL, CIO and
Railroad unions, along with members of veterans, Jewish,
Negro and working class political organizations, including
the Socialist Workers Party, rallied in a fighting mass dem-
onstration against America's No. 1 fascist leader.

When Smith's goons assaulted several pickets outside the
fascists‘ meeting place at the Leamington Hotel, the aroused
workers stormed the meeting hall and routed Smith and his
followers in a pitched battle. . . .

“Stop Fascism!”

Scores of banners carried by the pickets had been distribu-
ted by the united labor committee. They carried such slogans
as: "Race Hatred is .Fascism;" "Stop Fascism and
G.L.K. Smith;" "Don't Be A Sucker For Fascists;" "Don't
Support Hitler's Agent—Keep Away." By agreement of the
committee in charge, each organization carried only one
placard.

Among the organizations carrying their own banners were
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People; the Workers Defense League; the Minneapolis AFL
Central Labor Union; the Minneapolis AFL Building Trades
Council; the American Veterans Committee; the American

Youth for Democracy; the Socialist Workers Party; the
Communist Party; and the Minneapolis Jewish Action
Committee. ,

Prominent in the picket line was the banner of the Socialist
Workers Party proclaiming: "American Workers Do Not Want
A Hitler—STOP Gerald L. K. Smith!''. . .

Storming the Hall

As the first pickets reached the hotel, some of the Smith
goons attempted to break up the line. Several of the pickets
were attacked and knocked to the sidewalk. When the attackers
fled into the hotel, the pickets stormed in after them.

Surging through the lobby, the pickets were met by a knot
of fascists who attempted to bar the way to the ballroom
where the meeting was to be held. With a mighty push, the
Smith supporters were brushed aside and the pickets plunged
on like a great tidal wave toward the meeting hall.

Charging through a barricade of chairs which the fascists
had thrown up to prevent the pickets ‘from entering the hall,
the shouting mass of labor anti-fascists made their way into the
ballroom. In their frantic retreat, the fascists left broken
chairs, tables, lamps and mirrors in their wake. Dozens of
Smith's supporters fled through the windows. Those remaining
in the hall scuttled to one corner of the room and huddled
there.

Workers Take Over

At the call of the picket captain, Walter Frank, all the
pickets were seated. Frank's announcement that no Smith
meeting would be held was greeted with resounding cheers.
He reported that the hotel manager had refused to let Smith's

 meeting take place and ordered the fascists out, since the

ballroom had been obtained under false pretenses. One of
Smith's followers had rented the hall in the name of the
"Northwest Pioneers."

The assembled pickets were then instructed to march in a
body to the Minneapolis courthouse where an anti—fascist
rally would be held. A rearguard of pickets was left at the
hotel to see that instructions of the manager were carried
out.

Smith came out of hiding only after the pickets left. He
attempted to hold a meeting in the hotel lobby but only a
handful of people remained. In one of his usual attacks on
the labor movement and minorities, Smith declared to his
followers that the demonstration was the work of ‘Jewish
terrorists and Communists.'. . . I

Fascism:
How to Fight It
and

How Not to Fight It

On 15 June 1974 London's Red Lion Square witnessed one
of the bloodiest confrontations between police and left-wing
forces in recent British history. Countless demonstrators
were beaten with police truncheons, a number were trampled
under mounted patrols, and one young man, Kevin Gately,
was killed by the cops, his head so brutally battered that he
died of a cerebral hemorrhage. The occasion was aprotest
against a rally scheduled by the fascist-inspired National
Front

The NF is one of many extreme-rightist organizations that
have been surfacing and spreading in Europe during recent
months. Their breeding ground is the fear of economic ruin,
in particular an intensified competition for jobs in the wake
of a worldwide capitalist economic slump.

As in the past, one of the common fascist themes is race
hatred against Jews, blacks and now immigrant workers.
Former National Front fiihrer John Tyndall was quoted in
1969 as saying: "the Jew is a poisonous maggot feeding on a
body in an advanced state of_ decay" (Sunday Times, 30 March
1969). Along with NF national organizer Martin Webster and
others in the group's leadership, Tyndall was during the early
1960's a member of the now—defunct British National Socialist
Movement, which called for "deportation of all non-Aryans"
from Britain.

While many of these groups seek to put on respectable airs,
their aim is to recruit petty-bourgeois and lumpen elements
for the purpose of brutally smashing ‘the reds” and organized
labor. As the history of the rise of Nazism tragically demon-
strated, it is literally a life-and-death matter for the workers

movement to crush such reactionary paramilitary organiza-
tions while they are still weak.

With the growth of the NF in recent years (it polled 113,000
votes in last October's parliamentary elections), many leftists
and labor militants have understood the need to stop this
racialist anti-communist outfit. The occasion for their protest
last June was a National Front meeting against the Labour
Party government's decision to grant amnesty to persons
deemed "illegal immigrants" under the discriminatory 1971
Immigration Act.

Police Riot at Red Lion Square

On the day of the rally, the 1,500 NF marchers drew up
in military formation, drums beating and Union Jacks Flying.

Many of the flags were mounted on steel—pointed poles, some.

of the marchers were dressed in black shirts while others
were army surplus uniforms. A counterdemonstration of
about 1,000 was organized by the Communist Party (CP) and
Liberation, with contingents of the Internationalsocialists (IS)
and International Marxist Group (IMG).

Trouble began as the anti-fascist demonstrators approached
Red Lion Square, occupied (according to the IS account) by
about 500 police including mounted patrols. The bourgeois
press and police claim the marchers were told in advance to
make a, right turn as they entered the square, moving away
from the meeting hall where the NF rally was to, take place.
The left organizations say they were told no such thing. In any
case it is clear that a section of the march, with the MG
toward the front, sought to break through the police lines to
get to Conway Hall.

The police thereupon launched a baton charge, kicking and
punching their way into the crowd. As the momentum of the

 march carried more people into the square, units of the elite

Special Patrol Group, notorious for smashing workers’ picket
lines, were brought in. They formed a wedge and drove
through the crowd, splitting it in two.

The fighting intensified as they cornered one section of the
marchers in a side street. Then the arrests began. Blood-
soaked demonstrators were dragged by their hair to waiting
police vans and several bodies were left lying in the square,
among them Kevin Gately. Some of the remaining protesters
regrouped on the side street and jeered the NF marchers,
who were now approaching from a different direction. After
a pause of about ten minutes, the police suddenly laimched
a mounted charge against the leftists, a savage and totally
unprovoked attack. The National Front column looked on jubi-
lantly, then paraded triumphantly into Red Lion Square cheer-

-51-

 

ing the police and chanting, "We got to get the reds!"

The cops‘ vicious attack, including an unprovoked horse
charge and the death of Kevin Gately, are the responsibility
of the Wilson government. Gately's funeral drew thousands of
angry marchers and the wanton police assault has been
vigorously condemned by numerous socialist and union organ-
izations. Yet, incredibly, the government has sought to ‘blame
the left, particularly the IMG, for the violence! The recently
published Scarman Tribunal report rejected most charges of
police brutality and denied any responsibility of the cops in
Gately's death. This is in spite of the fact that the demonstra-
tors used no weapons, only the police had instruments which
could have caused the head wounds (truncheons and horses‘
hooves), and there were witnesses to the beating. This "report"
is a shameless whitewash of what was in fact a police riot.

However, our proletarian solidarity with the victims of
bourgeois "law and order” must not be an excuse tocover up
serious errors committed by some leaders of the anti-
fascist demonstration at Red Lion Square. It is not enough to
want to fight fascists—-one must know how to do‘_it. A New Left
policy of confrontation with police who obviously intended to
defend the National Front is not the way.

There is no doubt that the IMG sought to break through
police lines in order to arrive in front of the meeting hall.
Jackie Stevens, a member of the IMG, gave this report:
"We came across a line of police, and behind them were
mounted police. When we tried to get through to Conway Hall,
the police drew their batons and charged. . ." (Intercontinental
Press, 24 June 1974).

It is less clear why the IMG took this dangerously mistaken
step. But whatever the prior arrangements with the police;
whether demonstrators had made plans beforehand or simply
fell into a police trap; if it was bravado or confusion-in any
case, the decision to try to push through the police lines was
a disastrous move. The fact that the demonstrators lacked
any means to defend themselves from the cops’ murderous
onslaught, while it refutes police theories of a conspiracy to
attack the police, only makes this move all the more grievously
wrong. ‘

Marxists do not uphold a spurious "right" of fascists to
freedom of speech; we call on the labor movement to mobilize
to prevent the reactionary terror gangs from spewing out
their race-hate poison in mass rallies and by provocations
such as their marches in military uniform. But to prevent
them from speaking through militant mass action requires a
favorable balance of forces—something that was obviously not
present in Red Lion Square.

” LEON morsxv   W

ON FIGHTING FASCISTS:

"In this period it is very“ important to
distinguish between the fascists and the
state. The state is not yet ready to sub-
ordinate itself to the fascists; it wants to
‘arbitrate.’ . . .Our strategic task is to in-
crease these hesitations and apprehensions
on the part of the 'arbiter,' its army and
its police. How? By showing that we are
stronger than the fascists, that is, by
giving them a good beating in full view of
this arbiter without, as long as we are not
absolutely forced to, directly taking on the
state itself. That is the whole point."

--reprinted in Intercontinental Press,

K 2 December 1974 J

Yes, 20,000 workers could, and should, have prevented the
NF from holding its racist meeting. The failure of the unions
to mobilize against these anti-labor scum is criminal. But
this betrayal cannot be corrected by false heroics, sending
several score demonstrators against wel1—equipped riot police.
Not only was one militant killed and many injured, but the
National Front scored a significant publicity victory

as a result.

“Far Left” Battles ‘Cops in Paris

Unfortunately, such confrontationism is not an isolated
phenomenon. In France, while the Stalinists and social demo-
crats systematically abstain from mobilizing the working class
against the fascists, the fake "Trotskyists" of the United Sec-
retariat (of which the IMG is the British affiliate) have taken
a different approach: adventurist clashes with police protect-
ing the fascists. The classic case of this substitutionism
occurred on June 21, 1973.

On that date the Ligue Communiste (now Ligue Communiste
Revolutionnaire), French section of the USec, organized a
counterdemonstration against a rally by the fascist Ordre

-63..

Nouveau (‘New Order‘). The ON had for some time been
campaigning against ‘wildcat immigration‘ with vimlently
racist rhetoric, and had succeeded in provoking assaults on

immigrant workers. They planned to highlight this campaign.

nationally with a mass rally at the Mutualité meeting hall
in Paris.

While traditionally the Paris police had not mobilized heavily
in conﬂicts between the right and left, this time they clearly
were preparing to defend Ordre Nouveau. First theylooked on
as the ON turned the meeting hall into an armed camp, moving
in van loads of iron pipes, clubs and other assorted weaponry.
Then, by the Ligue Communiste's own report, the Mutualité
was surrounded by 2,000 police, a veritable army to protect
the fascists, waiting for the ‘far left‘ demonstrators to make
the slightest move.

The LC, which early in the day realized that the police
were ready to break up the anti-fascist demonstration, en-
couraged people to come to the march prepared for a confron-
tation. The leftists were heavily armed with clubs and molotov
cocktails. Thus it was clear from the beginning that the Ligue
fully expected a bash with the cops-a battle which, however,
they could not possibly win without massive contingents of
workers and left militants from all quarters.

When the police cordoned off the area around the hall they
were bombarded by incendiaries. The anti-fascist demonstra-
tors then broke up into small groups and long into the night
isolated clashes continued throughout the area. While there
was no clear military defeat of the leftists, they were unable
to do more than harass the cops and did not stop the fascists.
The next day, Ligue headquarters were occupied by the police,
25 of its supporters were arrested and the organization was
outlawed.

The Spartacist League immediately and vigorously protested
this viciously anti-democratic government attack and called
for united defense of the Ligue. But we also criticized its
adventurist tactics:‘

"The Trotskyist movement" has a long history of resistance
to fascist groups, including attacking and dispersing fascist
meetings. ...In this case, however, the presence of massive
police force made the relation of forces ‘unfavorable to the
left. It would appear that the Ligue Communiste recklessly
entered into an adventurist confrontation by attempting to take
on the armed power of the state under circumstances which
could lead only to the defeat of the left. The correct tactic,
given the government's authorization of the meeting, was to

-54-

 

 

mount a campaign calling on the mass workers organizations
. . . to mobilize tens of thousands of their members to prevent
the fascist meeting. In their absence, the Ligue could certainly’
have organized a mass protest demonstration. This isnot the
same thing, however, as a futile attempt to overwhelm the
police with 1,000 youths.‘

Portugal: A Hair’s Breadth from Disaster

Another instance of stupid guerrillaist confrontation tactics
occurred earlier this year in Portugal, where it could easily
have had disastrous consequences in an explosive pre-
revolutionary situation. On the night of January‘25-26 several
thousand youth and workers in the northern city of Porto sur-
rounded a meeting hall where the rightist Social Democratic
Center (CDS) was holding its national congress. This party's
leaders include numerous former officials of the Salazar-
Caetano dictatorship.

Four leftist organizations—LUAR, MES, PRP, and LCI-
called a demonstration in front of the meeting hall. Their
joint communiqué merely announced a protest action. After an
hour, however, a second demonstration arrived on the scene,
this one led by the OCMLP (Portuguese Communist Organiza-
tion Marxist-Leninist, a left-Maoist group), which in an
attempt to stop the congress proceedings attacked the para-
military police who were protecting the building (Esquerda
Socialista, 28 January).

This infantile "heroic" gesture led to baton charges by the
special police and a tear gas barrage followed by shots, leaving
a dozen demonstrators injured, some seriously. The leftists‘

 only means of defense was to hurl bricks. Then beginning

around 8 p.m. the regional military commander sent in
several army units. The officer in charge asked the CDS to
end the meeting (which it did), while the ranks outside frat-
ernized with the demonstrators.

Due to the hostile attitude of the troops, rightist politicians
in the Crystal Palace were afraid to leave the building, how-
ever, and during the early morning hours a second para-
military police unit attacked on horse and in personnel
carriers. Soldiers reportedly resisted the police assault.
Finally, at 7 a.m. parachutists from a base commanded by
conservative officers managed to extract the besieged reac-
tionaries (Luta Popular, 2 February; Revolucao, 7 February).

even than in the - old rural South, is poison to socialist
consciousness. . . ‘

Most whites today view blacks as a hostile social group,
with whom they can have no friends, no ties and no basis for
identification. The prevailing social climate in this country
contains the potential for race war, in which (given their
relative social power) the blacks would be the principal
victims. It is only at the point of production that black/white
relations are not generally hostile and where common prole-
tarian interests occasionally overcome the rigid racial division
of American society. . -

“Separate But Equal” Socialists

The racial integration of public schools—and that is what
the busing conflict is all about—is such an elementary demo-
cratic right, and the opponents of busing are so shamelessly
racist, that it is difficult to believe that any left-wing organ-
ization would not support court-ordered busing. Nonetheless,
two self-proclaimed socialist groups, the ostensibly Trotskyist
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the social-democratic
International Socialists (IS), actually oppose legally enforced
school desegregation, though their reasons differ: the former
advocates black nationalism while the latter capitulates to
white racist backwardness. r

The SWP is opposed to busing because it believes that
racially separate schools (“black control of the black com-
munity") are progressive. As SWP candidates Linda Jenness
and Andrew Pulley stated in their 1972 presidential/vice-
presidential campaign: .

"But money alone won't solve the problem of Black education.
Black control of Black education must also be established.
Black control means Black people electing community councils
V through which the masses can administer and supervise these
funds as well as all aspects of school functioning . . . . It includes
_' being able to decide whether Black students will or will not
be bussed.'
--Militant, 10 March 1972

But the SWP's opportunist appetites seem to be counterposed
to taking a hard position on any subject. Thus Jenness/Pulley
state in the same article that while the SWP “does not see
busing as the solution,‘ if the ‘Black community" supports
busing then so will they!

A demonstration against -the CDS congress, particularly
if attended by large numbers of workers, could have been
useful in exposing the viciously anti-working-class and anti-
democratic character of this ostensibly moderate party,
which is in reality a front for Salazarist forces. Massive
militant action by the labor movement in response to open
counterrevolutionary activity by such a group could put it out
of business.

But the attempt to stop the congress by launching a chaotic
unarmed crow! against police guards was perilously danger-
ous adventurism. Although the CDS did call off its meeting,
this was due to the attitude taken by the troop commanders,
not to a few hundred demonstrator . And the armed forces’
action could very easily have been the opposite, leading to a
bloodbath of the anti-fascist militants. ~

(Although there is great ferment in the army and navy,
most of the ranks still have confidence in the ‘progressive’
officers of the Armed Forces Movement. It was by no means
assured, ‘or even probable, that the soldiers would have
fraternized with anti-CDS demonstrators if explicitly ordered
not to. On November 4 of last year, troops commanded by the
most leftist officers of the Armed Forces Movement arrested
the top leadership of another Maoist group, the MRPP, for
attacking a CDS local office.)

A strong show of force against the "far leftists" on January
25-26 would have greatly strengthened reactionary elements
in the military who at the time were trying to oust the more
leftist top officers, in order to then crush the organized
workers movement. The action initiated by the OCMLP—led
demonstrators could have sparked a counterrevolutionary
mobilization.

Sowing Dangerous Democratic Illusions

It was characteristic of the complacent reformism of the
Stalinists and social democrats in the mid and late 1930's
that they sought, to pressure the bourgeois state into checking
the fascists. The workers paid for this criminal passivity
with rivers of blood as the jackbooted legions strode to power
over the corpse of the organized labor movement.

Today an international capitalist depression is once again
generating a host of ultra'—right and overtly fascist formations.
It would be a serious mistake to pretend, as do some New

-66..

 

 

l'FI-Jill‘

Left/anarchist elements (along with Gerry Healy), that fascism
is ‘just around the corner.‘ But the reactionary terror gangs
are an important weapon in the capitalist arsenal and it is
essential for the labor movement to know how to crush them.
This is particularly true for the young generation of workers
who have never seen the union smashed, labor leaders jailed
and killed, the socialist press banned and the entire proletar-
iat brought to its knees by a bourgeoisie desperate to maintain
at all costs its brutal class dictatorship.

The reformists' democratic illusion in the ability and
willingness of the bourgeoisie to "control" reactionary ultras
are by no means dead and buried, nor restricted to overtly
Stalinist and social-democratic organizations. ln»Boston today
it is the ostensibly Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party which
leads the liberal/ reformist chorus pleading for federal troops
to protect black schoolchildren and communities from racist
night riders and lynch mobs.

The centrist European majority of the Usec also expresses
confidence in the class enemy. The French LCR supports the
SWP call for federal troops to Boston (Rouge, 5 January).
Moreover, after fighting the police all night in the June 1973
Paris anti-fascist demonstration, the Ligue Communiste sent
an appeal to "working-class elements‘ in the Autonomous
Federation of Police Unions, asking: "Do you consider it
natural [13] for you to be used to protect fascists and to
interyene against strikers struggling to improve their wages
and yorking conditions?" (Rouge, 27 June 1973). What Marxist
would expect anything else of the hired guns of the capitalist
class‘?!

As for those "workers in police uniforms," Trotsky wrote

in "What Next?" (1932) that "The worker who becomes a police-

man in the service of the capitalist state is a bourgeois cop,
not a worker.“ Revolutionaries do not appeal to the cops but
to the workers movement to smash the reactionary gangs, and
demand the expulsion of police from the unions.

The Ligue also called on the French government to ban

the Ordre Nouveau meeting, just as the IMG in Britain called

on the Labour government to ban the National Front rally.
Not only does this foster the dangerous illusion that the bour-
geois state can or will stop the fascists (in fact, cops and
military officers are often closely connected with fascist
groups), but the laws under which it would ban a fascist meet-
ing will be used tomorrow to, cancel demonstrations by the

-67..

 

 

‘extremist left." The French government's ‘impartial’ banning
of both Ordre Nouveau and the Ligue Communiste following
the June 1973 clash is a classic example.

United Workers Action,
Not New Left Confrontationism

The Marxist policy on how to fight the fascists was stated
unambiguously by Leon Trotsky during the 1930's, anddirectly
contradicts the policy of both wings of the United Secretariat.
"Only armed workers‘ detachments, who feel the support of
tens of millions of toilers behind them, can successfully
prevail against the fascist bands," states the Transitional
Program. And in "War and the Fourth International," Trotsky
writes: "To turn to the state, that is, to capital, with the demand
to disarm the fascists means to sow the worst democratic
illusions, to lull the vigilance of the proletariat, to demoralize
its will.”

Trotsky was quite explicit that the task of defense of the
workers movement _from the reactionary terror gangs was
not the job of small groups, but requires united action by the
workers and their mass organizations. Our movement has not
been passive in the face of fascists, and in 1939 the then-
revolutionary SWP called a demonstration to protest a fascist
rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. When 50,000
anti-fascist demonstrators arrived, they did not hesitate to
break. through police lines. Many of the fascists received a
‘good thrashing from the protestors as they left the meeting.

But the perspective of the USec majority is a different
one, of "minority violence" by the vanguard as a stimulant to
"excite" the workers to follow its example. D. Bensaid, a
leader of the LCR, writes that ". . . acts of minority violence,
presently lumped together under the general heading of terror-
ism, can play their role as a tactical recourse among others
within a strategy of conquest of power by the masses“
("Terrorism and Class Struggle"). They may excite Bensaid,
but the history of the last century, from the Russian Narodniks
to the Tupamaros, has demonstrated the utter impotence of
such a policy.

The incidents reported above show clearly that "minority
vanguard violence” against police who are protecting fascist
and ultra-rightist meetings either has had or easily could
have had the most disastrous consequences. It serves to
drive the state and the fascists together, precisely the oppo-

site of what revolutionaries seek * to achieve. When they are
defeated (as usually happens) by the superior force of the
state military apparatus such confrontations greatly embolden
the reactionaries.

Marxists call for no confidence in the bourgeois state
and warn the working people that they must rely on their own
forces to protect against the vicious attacks of capitalist
reaction. It is possible even for small groupsto play a decisive
role in sparking organized workers self-defense actions. But
this will not take place through New Left confrontationism
but by providing political leadership within the mass organi-
zations of the exploited and oppressed and by building the
revolutionary vanguard party capable of leading the workers
forward to the conquest of power. Not voluntaristic militarism
but a struggle to resolve the crisis of proletarian leadership
—this is the only road to victory over fascismll

The difference between Wallace/Hicks and J enness/ Pulley
turns out to be only that the former want to prohibit blacks
from attending white schools, while the SWP wants to convince
blacks not to. (Both agree on preventing whites from attending
black schools.) In practice, even this difference evaporates.
Wallace and Hicks would happily agree to the SWP policy,
since they believe they can discourage blacks from wanting to
attend white neighborhood schools. Voluntary busing is anopen
invitation for organized harassment and racial violence against
the volunteers. The history of school desegregation since

' l 954 is full of examples of such harassment, from demontrations

by white parents in Little Rock against integration in 1956 to
burning of school buses by the Ku Klux Klan in Michigan in
the 1970's.

The SWP has embraced the Uncle Tom tradition of black
acceptance of "separate but equal" facilities. If the SWP took
historical traditions seriously, next to their posters of Che
Guevara and Malcolm X they should also display the ideo-

logical inspirer of their position on black education—Booker—

T. Washington.

The International Socialists have the dishonor of capit-
ulating directly to the white racist backlash on the busing
question:

"Two-way‘ busing involves more than simply the right of
black people to attend any school they want, a right which
socialists unconditionally defend. It also involves sending
white students (mostly working class) to worse schools, an
issue made to order for racists.

‘Even whites who are not racist find it impossible to defend. . . .
For these reasons, socialists oppose both the 'pro'-busing
and ‘anti’-busing forces, both of whom use racism to further
their own ends.‘

—Workers Power, 10 November 1972

For blacks the IS position amounts to essentially the same
thing as the SWP's. Blacks have the right to volunteer to attend
white neighborhood schools in the face of organized racist
violence. But—horror of horrors—whites must not be assigned
to ghetto schools! The ghetto schools are hell holes not because
of their geographical location, but because they serve as prison
camps for restless black lumpen youth. Umier the present
conditions of rampant white racism, the presence of significant
numbers of white students could be an at least minimally
effective way of introducing an element of change into the
nature of ghetto schools. If an all-black school becomes 20
percent white, the administration, teachers and the cops will
behave rather differently.

On the other hand all the talk about quality education-

-4-

 

‘<.-—-——~ﬁ:_. —

 

on both sides of the busing conflict-is bourgeois idealist
hogwash. Ghetto schools do not teach because there are no jobs,
no careers for the products of those schools. Black lumpen
youth cannot use the knowledge normally transmitted through the
public school system to get ahead in American society. Doubling
the budget for ghetto schools would have little effect on the
cultural level of the black masses and even less effect on their
economic situation. As long as blacks remain a race—color
caste, concentrated at the bottom of American society and
imprisoned in ghettos, changes in formal education will have
only a marginal impact on black people.

For Free Universal Higher Education

While the Spartacist League supports busing regardless of
popular opposition to it, it would be moralistic idealism, not
scientific socialism, to believe whites can be won over simply
by appeals to democratic principles. White workers and petty
bourgeois will accept busing only when they believe it does not
attack their material interests.

White parental opposition to busing reflects both racist
attitudes as such and a belief that aninflux of blacks will lower
educational quality, thereby making it more difficult for their
children to get into and do well in college. In reality, the
available studies show that integrated schools have little effect
on the academic performance of either white or black children.
However, whites do view busing as ase-rious threat to the future
educational/career prospects for their children.

U.S. whites will accept integrated public schools only if the
intensely competitive screening/tracking purpose of the educa-
tional system is eliminated. Socialists must demand free higher
education for all with an adequate stipend to cover living
expenses for every student. Free universal higher education
will not eliminate those anti-busing forces that reflect pure and
simple racist bigotry, but it would fundamentally undercut the
anti-busing sentiment arising out of the struggle over limited

 educational resources.

For Low-Rent Racially Integrated Housing

Some opposition to busing, particularly from the school
children themselves, is due to the time—consuming incon-
venience involved. While recognizing the resistence to exten-
sive busing caused by practical considerations, the conven-
ience -issue is totally dwarfed by the central question of the
democratic rights of blacks.

Busing is a somewhat artificial attempt to overcome ghetto-
