DENVER—Mine-il negotiators moved into hard

bargaining last month in a driving effort to settle the ,
nation-wide copper; strike which has halted '80 per cent of . I '
the*meta1’s miningiand refining since mid-August. With
the pinch on the industry tightening materially and get- : 

ting much tighter as the
shutdown continued past
the 100-day mark, the com-
panies finally began to show
a realistic attitude toward
re a c h i n g an industry-wide
strike settlement.

Coupled with the increasing
copper shortage and sharp
drop in profits, the industry
was also clearly impressed
with the mood of the men on
the picket lines expressed in
the determination to make
their strike investment pay off.

Several developments took
place in rapid succession dur-
ing mid-November which
brought about simultaneous
resumption of negotiations by
Mine-Mill with all big five cop-
per producers for the first
time since the "strike began,
and which directly led to the
settlement by Kennecott with
one of t-he_union"s in its west-
ern operations, the Steel-
workers.

The industry first put its
marbles behind a grand strat-
egy attempt by Phelps Dodge
to push through a cheap set-
tlement with a few Metal
Trades craft unions in Arizona.
News stories immediately an-
nounced that the crafts had
accepted a PD so-called 15.6

cent an hour two-year package

TUCSON, Ariz. — Presi-

here Nov. 10 that the com-

copper strike, the big-busi-I

ness drive behind enactment
of the Landrum-Griffin law
and the Taft-Hartley trial, of
Mine-Mill leaders now going
on in Denver were all inter-
woven “parts of an over-all,
well-organized and extremely

The importance attributed to
Clark's speech was reflected in
the wide coverage given his

throughout the nation.
Clark rippedi into the big
five copper companies, charg-
ing them with “social irre-

THE ATTITUDE of the
companies, Clark said, “can be
summed up as follows: They

month followed hard o11 the
heels of a statement issued in —
Denver by the National Wage
Policy committee which met
Nov. 14 to review the strike
situation to date and pinpoint
a firm area of settlement.

The statement pointed out
that it was the absence of “a

serious and constructive atti- -

tude” on the part of the com- _
panies which “forced the strike
on the workers in this industry --
through concerted company»
refusal to make a single nego-
tiable offer in four months of

Negotiations Begun
On Banner Contract

Negotiations by Banner Mi-
ners Union No. 929 with Ban-
ner Mining company, begun in
Tucson, Ariz. Oct. 21, were be-
ing continued last month un-
der an extension of the old
contract until Nov. 30. Serv-
ing on the Local 929 negotiat-
ing committee are President
Cenobio Robles, Financial Sec-
retary Ted Martinez and Re-
cording Secretary Jerry Ortiz.
They were assisted by Region-
al Director Jack C. Marcotti
before he left for the Taft-
Elartley trial in Denver, and
now by acting Regional Direc-
tor Frank Vettorel, who has
temporarily taken over Mar-
cotti’s assignments in Arizona.

Bargaining was also in prog-
ress by Local 700 both with
Magnus Metals company and
at the recently re—won Shore
Calnevar plant in Los Angeles,
and by Local 925 with U. S.
Plastics Products company in
Metuchen, N. J.

Silicosis Award
Won in Leadville

A s i l i c o sis compensation

case fought through with the

assistance of Mine-Mill has
been won by Frank J. Shine,
former member of Local 393
at the AS&R smelter in Lead-
ville, Colo. An award handed
down Nov. 2 by the Industrial
Commission of Colorado or-

dered that the State Compen-
sation Insurance Fund pay
Shine $36.75 per week begin-
ning May 17, 1958, the date he
was fired by AS&R, “and con-

tinuing thereafter until the
full sum of $7,900 is paid on
account of permanent total
disability” by reason of sili-
cosis. A supplementary rul-
ing by the Commission also
ordered the payment of Shine’s
attorney’s fees. Attorney Eu-
gene Deikman of Denver han-
dled the case.

Shine worked principally as
a payloader on the flues at
the Leadville smelter from
January 1945 until his dis-
charge on May 16, 1958 when
AS&R management main-
tained he was too sick to han-
dle other jobs which the union
argued could be made avail-
able for him. He has been to-
tally and permanently dis-
abled by silicosis since that
date. The company claimed his
disability was the result of
prior employment elsewhere.
It was established, however,
that x-rays taken in 1946, over
a year after he was employed
by AS&R, showed Grade II
silicosis, and that during his
employment at the Leadville
smelter “his silicosis advanced
to Grade III, by reason of
which he is totally disabled,”
the Referee said.

Kellogg Committee
Plans Big Doings

Ladies Auxiliary No. 65 and
Local .18 in Kellogg, Idaho,
have set up a joint organiza-
tional and social activities com-
mittee to increase members’
participation in organization
as a means of improving mem-

bership an d community un-
derstanding of the union’s pro-
gram. v Letters and leaflets
are Planned to start the organ-
izational w ork rolling, with
home visits and on-the-job dis-
cussions to follow. Card parties
and other social doings, includ-
ing stewards and officers din-
ners, are planned to stimulate
the social side of union activ-
ities in which the involvement

of retired members will be

given special attention. Union
and Auxiliary committees have
been set up to visit all hos-
pitals on a regular basis.

A kick-off dinner and card
party was held Nov. 14, to be
followed by more social activ-
ities plus a huge children’s
Christmas party consisting of
doings at both Wallace and
Kellogg. - I

by Mine-Mill General Counsel
Nathan Witt on the new law,
dealing with specific matters
requiring the immediate at-
tention and action of local un-

ions, was also sent out earlier.‘

Local officers were advised
that inquiries about the new
Act and its filing requirements
should be directed to the In-

Local 809 Wins

Arbitration «Case

Bill Pitts, discharged, Sept.
17 by National Lead company
in Fredericktown, Mo., was
ordered reinstated to his ‘job
in an arbitration decision won
by Local 809. Int’l Rep. Jesse
Van Camp handled the case
for the union. .

Pitts, an acting steward at
the time, was fired for shut-
ting down his job at the end
of the shift despite the fact
that he had warned his fore-
man at least six hours before
quitting time to be sure his
relief came in. The foreman
did not arrange his relief.
There is no compulsory over-
time provision in the union
contract.

Pitts returned to work with
full seniority five weeks after
he was fired. In his ruling,
Arbitrator Russell S. Bauder
upheld the union’s contention
that the foreman “did not fol-
low the agreement and did not
perform _the duty of a super-
visor” in failing to arrange for
filling the temporary vacancy.

‘59 Biggest 6

  Strike Year

The year 1959 has already
shaped up as the biggest
strike year since 1946. As of
October this year, more than
1,750,000 workers had been in-
volved in more than 3,000
strikes.
of a million additional. workers
were laid off because of the
strikes. .

According to January - Au-

gust figures on the number of

man-days lost‘ ' because of
strikes in 1959 and 1958, there

were 34,500,000 man-days lost .
this year as compared to 10,- ‘

500,000 man-days lost during
the same periodlast year.
It's clear thatthe reason for

the big upsurge in strikes has.-.
been the sudden “get-tough”_

bargaining attitude displayed
by manage~ment—spearheaded
and masterminded by the
steel, auto, electrical equip-
ment and copper companjﬁs.
Management is finding out -; '
hard way that labor can ,:
tough, too.

 District Judge T. E. Downey ordered the Montana

which directed county. welfare
departments to cut ~ relief al-

in half and to deny any relief
for unmarried men because
the u n i o n was maintaining
strike kitchens where single

At the time the court action
was in i t i a t e d, the Montana

ministrator Fouse of trying to
intimidate union in e m b e r s
from exercising their legal
rights with “threats of repri-
sals against strikers who re-

status which i the welfare board
has accorded them."

Judge Downey completely

,upheld Mine-Mill's contention

that Fouse’s orders differenti-
ating strikers from others
seeking welfare aid were dis-
criminatory and illegal. Judge
Downey’s order-said:

“It is hereby ordered, and
this does order, that . . . with

Victory Near

AGE SEVEN of this issue of The Union

carries a report, with chart, which
rounds up the available information on the
impact of our. strike as it goes into its
fourth month. I hope everyone, whether
he be on the picket line or strike committee,
local negotiating committee, or on one of the
national council bargaining committees, will
take the time to get the picture of how the
strike has hit the big copper companies pro-
duction-wise, profit-wise, and customer-wise.

This only tells part of the story of how
management’s big miscalculation of 1959 has
backfired. The Steel Trust and the Copper
Trust followed a co-ordinated strike strategy
this year—cl1op away with the “right to man-
age” slogan at job safeguards built up over

the years, and try to sell a soft settlement on .

the phony, discredited anti-inflation argument.

The companies were in for a rude awaken-
ing. The steel strike got solider as it went
along, and as the 500,000 rank-and-file steel-
workers became aroused to management’s
threat to eliminate up to every fifth job in the
industry. Then Big Steel got a jolt when
Kaiser Steel, followed by others, broke away
to settle on a reasonable basis, on a two-year,
221/2 cent package.

.Si.;ce the Taft-Hartley injunction was

A __;'1(lﬁed, the rest of the steelworkers have shown

every determination to take no less, and have
announced that they are ready to go out
again in January to get it.

*‘k‘k

UCH the same thing has been happening

in our industry. Our strike, as was steel’s,
is solid, while the non-ferrous industry has
seen one break after another in the employer
front.
C First came the settlements at American
Brass and American Metal Climax. Then St.
Joe Lead decided it had had enough after a

4-month strike at its zinc mines in New York '

{,5-tate+biggest in the United States—and set-

‘  t1 (1 for 21 cents for two years, plus picking

111% the tab on insurance lapsed during"; -_.the
st ike. Then our striking brothers at Kenne-
co7tt-’s Chilean mine won a handsome settlement.
Phelps Dodge in mid-November thought, it
was bucking the industry trend when it nego-
tiated a 15.6c deal with the Metal Trades Coun-
cil in Arizona—-only to have it torpedoed by
anoverwhelming “no”7vote from the rank and
file." About the same time came the Kennecott-
Steelworkers settlement, right in line with the
already-established non-ferrous pattern.

Aussie Miners’ Leader
Lands Mine-Mill Host

President Norman Dunlevy of the Broken Hill Miners
Union of Australia recently was a visitor to the North American
continent as fraternal delegate to the Mine-Mill Canadian con-
vention and later as a guest of the International Union in
Canada and a tour of Idaho and Washington locals in the states.
Before boarding his ship in San Francisco for Australia, Broth-
er Dunlevy asked President John Clark to express his appre-
ciation to the International membership on both sides of the
border for his “wonderful trip” and the knowledge gained of
Mine-Mill which he lauded as “a great democratic rank and file

organization.”

Following. is an account of the Australian mine union lead-
er’s ‘trip as he asked to have it reported by President Clark: -

To put into words Brother
Dunlevy’s description of his
trip both as to places of’na-
tional and international inter-
est as well as to his conducted
tours through the mining and
smelting operations in both
countries would take a real
volume.

His comparisons of the oper-
ations in the metals industry
were, of course, the same in
any language, for these oper-
ations are all practically alike
in all countries. His descrip-
tion of his tour through Can-

ada and into Idaho and Wash--

ington to San Francisco will
undoubtedly increase the de-
sire for similiar trips among
his people at Broken Hill.-

* * *

STARTING FROM TORON-
T0 with its beautiful setting,
he was able to view what he
described as. “an Aawesome
sight,” the,l.\Tiagara Falls. He
then ~visited  Sudbury, , ,Ont'.,'

through the mining and smelt-
ing operations of the Canadian
Consolidated M in in g a n d
Smelting company. From there
he was driven into Metaline
Falls, VVash. and then to the
Coenr d’Alene mining district
of Idaho as the guest of Local
18 and the International Union,

, making a- side visit to the

Grand Coulee dam from Spo-
kane. .

for a health and welfare plan
providing medical-hospital ben-

similar to an MPS plan al-_
ready in‘ effect in Great Falls‘
where the Mine-Mill smelter-
men are also on strike against ;

THE MINE-MILL UNION

“Local Union Leaders Denounce

T-H Trial, Pledge Support

Even before the trial of 11 past and present leaders of Mine-Mill got under way
and since, messages condemning the attack on the union and expressing support of
the defendants began coming in to the International office in Denver. One of the
first to wire support was Local 365 in Perth Amboy, N. J. Others also received be-

fore the Mine-Mill Union went to press are quoted here:

vLOCAL 365, PERTH AM-
BOY, N. J.——“On behalf of Ex-
ecutive Board and member-
ship of Local 365 we want to
assure you President Clark
and the officers that you have
our full support in the coming
trial where the 11 officers and
staff In e In b e r s are being
brought up on charges. Know-
ing we have been cleared of

 charges before we are confi-

dent that again Mine-Mill will
be victorious.”

LOCAL 480, TRAIL, B. C.,
CANADA—-—“Regular member-
ship meeting Local 480 Nov.
12 discussed Taft-Hartley at-
tack on our International offi-
cers. Motion was unanimously
adopted of sympathy and sup-
port of our indicted officers.
This attemept to decapitate
our union whilst 35,000 of our
members on strike represents
most sordid conspiracy by em-
ployers and their government
lackeys to destroy our union.”

JOE DISPENZA President,
Local 485, Bingha-m Canyon,
Utal1—“The charges and at-
tack against the 11 officers
and staff members of Mine-
Mill are no more than charges
by big business against the
members of our International
Union. In so making these
charges the companies feel
they can break this union
which will never happen. Any
support we as members of the
union can give to these 11
men would show greater sup-
port in our fight against the
companies.”

i‘ PETE PIEKARSKI, Record-

ing Secretary, Local 18, Kel-
_ logg, Idaho—“Such persecu-

tion of our union once again
,’ comes at a time when we are
“engaged in a tough battle with
the mining companies for
higher wages and better work-

.ing- conditions which would

permit us to enjoy that kind

of decent living made possible
by modern society. As an of-

ficer of Mine-Mill Local 18 I

strongly condemn and object

to what I consider an outright
attempt to frame up the lead-
ership of my International

Union. I see in this a «move

against my union and the

gains it has won.over the
years. In fact, it is my belief
that a conspiracy exists in our
 country . . . a Taft-Hartley,

Landrum-Griffin conspiracy to

destroy labor and its gains.”

_,,,-about the conspiracy frame-up

broken record. The same wit-
nesses parading before the
witness chair telling the same
stories year after year. This
trial will in the end only prove
what our members already
know: our union has through-
out its history only been con-
cerned by one thing—how to
better the lot of the workers.
This concern is why our mem-
bers have always supported
our union.”

WILLIAM N. KEY, Presi-
dent, Local 937, San Manuel,
Arizonw~“It is impossible to
describe the indictment and
trial of the leaders of Mine-
Mill other than to say that this
is not an attack on the men
as individuals, but an attack
against our organization as
well as all organized labor.
The timing of the indictments
and trial proceedings bear this

out every emphatically.

“These union leaders who
are charged with ‘conspiracy’
are guilty of nothing other, in
my opinion, than working for
the best interests of our un-
ion. Probably the greatest con-
spiracy witnessed in recent
years is involved in this case+
a conspiracy by powerful cop-
per corporations, backed by
the present administration, to
completely destroy the effec-
tiveness of our union by de-
priving our members of leader-
ship when it is needed most.”

LOCAL 651, KIMBERLEY,
B. C.——“Local 651 sends best
wishes and support from the
membership to the officers on
trial, .with' hopes that victory
will be’ the outcome in both
your strike and court cases.
Two checks will follow—thou-
sand ‘for strike and fifty for
defense funds.”

CHARLES .D. HARDEN,
Chief Steward, Local 808, Dan-
ville, Ill.—~“I wish to state my
feelings and the sentiments of
the members I work around
and with of the trial of our
union brothers in Denver. It
looks to us like the trial is
timed to coincide with copper
negotiations and the present
strike that our members are
engaged in.

“Why the long wait of three
years to bring our leaders to
trial? Now they are being
charged with the violation of
the loyalty oath section of
Taft-Hartley that has been a

from the ‘Slave Labor Act.’
The prosecution will parade
out the same stoolpigeons and
discredited misleaders of labor

to try and prove a bad case.
The members of our local have
supported the Mine-Mill de-
fense fund and will continue
to do so with all our resources
until our persecuted brothers
are vindicated.”

Here's How ASGR

Delegates Saw ll'
Several A S & R council

delegates who were in Den-

ver for the negotiations

with A S & R management
during the trial, also man-
aged to be present in the
court room for some of the
testimony. Here are some

-of their comments:

ELMER OLSEN, Business
Agent, Local 25, Tacoma,
Wash.—“Having read in the
papers‘ in the ‘past about trials
of our International officers
and the testimony given by
past officers and representa-
tives who are paid government
witnesses, I have had an op-

portunity to see what a farce
these trials can be. The testi-

mony given by these paid gov-
ernment stooges stinks to the
high heavens. After about 10
days of listening to the trial
here in Denver it would make
any sensible person’s stomach
turn over. I pray that our of-
ficers Will be acquitted.”

JOHN INFUSINO, President,
Local 365, Perth Amboy, N. J.
——-“I -had the opportunity to
watch the trial for about a
week and to hear people who
once belonged to our organiza-
tion make certain charges

against the present officers of,

Mine-Mill. It is no surprise
because today these people
who were officers are working
for the companies or are men
who helped secede members
from our union and hold high
positions in raiding unions.
“Knowing that these charges
have been brought against our
union in the past, I feel that
Mine-Mill will again emerge
victorious at the end as soon
as these witnesses are ex-
posed as company agents and
agents of other unions who
are trying in every way pos-
sible to break our union.”
JAMES W. BUCK, President,
Local 51, Selby, Calif.~—“I had

the opportunity to sit in dur-

ing the court proceedings at
the trial and was amazed at

- the amount ' of money the ~ gov-

ernment is wasting in prose-
cuting these men. The former

Frame-up Charge Will Fail

The following telegram wasreceived from the Mine-
Mill National Executive Board in Canada:

“Canadian Executive Board International Union of
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers announces full support
for those officers and members of our union who are now
facing frame-up charges on a so-called conspiracy.
obvious that this is just one more of those many employer
inspired attacks against our union by governmental
agencies that our union has faced over sixty years.

“The link between the so-called conspiracy trial and
strike of the miners is self evident.
bership over the years have answered these ‘frame-ups
with their purchased stool pigeons by standing firm and
continuing their militant struggle against the employers.
We are confident that the present so-called conspiracy case
will be exposed and defeated by the unity of the member-
ship as it was in the timeof the Haywood-Moyer-Pettibone
trials and again laterin our time in the Jencks case. ' ,

INDUSTRYNOTES

ZINC continues to make news. With end of steel strike,

 

big pick up is expected in demand for prime western zinc, used

in galvanizing. Two large U.S. primary producers, New Jersey
Zinc and American Zinc, Lead and Smelting Co. report big in-
crease in earnings this year due to improved prices. New
Jersey Zinc net profit this year through September was $2,-
723,637, compared with only $107,655 for same months last

year. American Zinc’s profits this year are nearly double last -

year. American Zinc is also opening up more mines in Wis-

consin, in addition to those reported in this column last month.-

It also is expanding zinc mining in Tennessee, and is jointly
opening up, with Hydrometals, Inc., the Peru mine in the Silver
City, New Mexico district.
ir * ‘Ir

AMERICAN ZINC also figured last month in’ a joint pro-
gram with Illinois Zinc division of Hydrometals. Illinois Zinc
has developed a new alloy of titanium, copper and zinc known
as Hydro-T Metal, which is expected to create important new
markets for zinc-based sheet metal. American Zinc’s casting
facilities at its Monsanto plant will be used to cast the new
alloy into 4-ton ingots, which will then be shipped directly to
the rolling mills of Dow Metal Products at Madison, Wis.

WHITE PINE COPPER COMPANY, northern Michigan
producer, was struck October 29. 1200 miners went out. Pro-

LONGEST U.S. NON-FERROUS strike so far this year, at
northern New York Edwards and Balmat zinc mines of St. Joe

Lead Company was settled early in November. Strike began,

 

July 1 and lasted 121 days. Basis of settlement was a two-year ' 5’ 

contract with total value of 21 cents, including a 10 cent-an-hour
wage increase the first year, 6 cents the second year, and 5
cents in improved insurance coverage and sickness and accident
benefits. The company also picked up back payments of em-
ployees in its insurance program.

COEUR D’ALENES district mines not shipping to Bunker
Hill smelter have had to stockpile silver, lead and copper ores
on the ground because strike has shut down American Smelting
and Refining Company’s smelter at East Helena, Montana.

‘ Among mines affected are Sunshine, largest U. S. silver mine, 1

Lucky Friday, Galena, Page and Jack Waite. Value of metal

content of stockpiled ores has been estimated at more than‘

$3,000,000.

SASKATCHEWAN potash production is running behind
schedule. Both Potash Company of America and International
Minerals and Chemicals have run into unexpectedly difficult
ground and water conditions in the course of shaft sinking and
driving crosscuts. As a result, production has been much lower
than scheduled, and Potash Company of America has hadvto
increase. its planned investment in the mine. W. J. Pearson,

industrial geologist, Saskatchewan Department of Mineral .Re- --

sources said recently that it would be nearly two years before
the province would be able to supply all Canadian potash needs.

It had been expected previously that Canada would meet all its _

own needs in 1960 and have a surplus of potash for shi~pmen'f
to the United States and the Far East. .

of the Mine-Mill strike through-
out the industry. Still, at Mine-
Mill Union presstime, Kenne-

cott had not as yet settled’

either with Mine-Mill or any
of the other unions which
together represent more than
80 percent of the workers in
the company’s western opera-
tions, the majority of. whom
belong to Mine-Mill.

Until Kennecott settles with
Mine-Mill and the other unions,
the company ca-n’t produce any
more copper than the 2-weeks
supply of concentrates they
had at the beginning of the
strike in the smelter. To dig
the ore and mill it, they’ve got
to settle with Mine-Mill.

most entirely to a period be-
fore the so-called conspiracy
is alleged to have begun. They
argued the “jury had been in-
undated” with testimony hav-
ing no bearing on the charge
in the case and which would
have the effect of confusing
the real issues.

“The strands of evidence

 

. =r~".‘y; have become so numerous and

tangled,” they said, “as to
make it impossible for them to
be kept straight except by a
mathematical genius or an
electronic computer.” ‘

CON CEDING that "conspir-

sometimes to the possibility of
confusion,” Judge Arraj nev-

such a case.

Rejection of the defense mo-

and “communist” accusations
around like buckshot. As this

for instance, you might draw
the conclusion that anytime
two Mine-Mill people went to

Next turnabout witness was
Ralph Locke Jr., laid off as a
staff member after brief serv-
ice with the union some 10
years ago. He also was a wit-
ness in the SACB action
against Mine-Mill.

Even reporters covering the
trial saw the connection when

' James E. Petersen, who has
testified on at least two previ-
ous occasions against the un-
ion of which he was a staff
member 10 years ago, took the
stand. Petersen is now Direc-

tor of‘ Industrial Relations for

Kennecott Copper’s Utah divi-
sion. (See box on this page.)

William Mason now runs a
bar in Butte, but he is better
known as an ousted ‘Mine-Mill
board member who took a job
on the Steelworkers payroll in
1954 to lead an unsuccessful
raid against Mine-Mill in Butte
and Anaconda. Since then he
has turned up as a govern-
ment .witness against Mine-
Mill in four proceedings be-

fore this one. On cross-exami-.

-nation here, he admitted talk-
ing to FBI agents at various
times between 1953 and 1955,
which means he was acting as
a secret informer for at" least
a year while still serving on
the Mine-Mill Executive board.

A hired FBI informer since
1953, Bobby G. Fikes, claimed
he was sent by the Communist
partyto Bessemer, Ala,, some-
time in. 1949 to “help” Mine-

Mill. .He admitted he had been '

a government witness in two
other cases.

Witness number 8 was Art
"Morales, a Butte miner who

was on the Mine-Mill staffiin

Butte for a short time during
1954. He was a ' member of
Local 1 during the entire pe-
riod beginning in 1949 that he
was being paid as a spy and
informer for the FBI, report-
ing on who attended and what
took place at Butte Miners un-
ion meetings, committee“ meet-
ings and staff meetings. He
has testified as an admitted
informer in two previous
cases. He .was well paid for
his “services,” as thebox on
page 1 shows.

The ninth witness was Fred
Gardner, fired from the Mine-
Mill staff in 1955. Used as a
government witness in several
other cases, Gardner has been
exposed as a U. S. Army de-
serter turned informer who
has lied about his age, his
work, his residences and his

marriages.

signed immediately; and Al-

During four and a half
months of bargaining “before
the strike, not one single ne-
gotiable offer” was made to
the union by Kennecott, Ana-
conda, Phelps Dodge, AS&R or
Magma Copper, Clark said.
The reason, he added, is that
“their ultimate objective is to
pave the way for still greater
gains in profits and productiv-
ity; they want, above all, either
to eliminate or weaken this
and other unions and to
emasculate the bargaining
process.” 5

“To that end,” he said, “they
have joined among themselves
and with large corporations in
other industries to ‘take labor
on’ in what future historians
may well refer to as The Great
Anti-Labor Conspiracy of
1959.” = “’ —-

Clark told the ADA audience
that the copper companies
joined with the steel corpora-
tions in suddently raising the
“phony” right-to-manage issue.
“It is not, and never has been,
a serious issue in the copper
industry,” he said. “The com-
panies, in several months of
negotiations before the strike

,,-began, never even presented.
