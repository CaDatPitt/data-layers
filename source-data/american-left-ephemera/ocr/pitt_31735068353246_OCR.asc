Structure Proposed for Union

TUCSON, Ariz.——Proposals to put the International Union on a more sound fi-
nancial footing so as to better carry out its program of protecting and advancing the
interests of the membership on all fronts were projected here in the section of the an-
nual officers’ report prepared for delivery by Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter to the

‘Congress Gets Mine-Milli

  Lead-Zinc Subsidy Plan

- WASHINGTON, D. C.——Mine-Mill President John
Clark last month proposed enactment of a measure to

‘provide industry-wide subsidies for U. S. lead-zinc mine '

production. He told a congressional committee that the
union’s program offers “the most reasonable and realistic

I’ approach” to solving the

problems of “chronic de-

 pression in the lead-zinc in-
 ﬁdustry.”

In a statement to the Mining

-_ _and Minerals subcommittee of

the‘House committee on Inte-
rior and Insular Affairs which
held hearings here March 9

. and 10, Clark emphasized that

a broader approach on govern-
ment lead-zinc subsidies is

- called for than that proposed

in _the bill under consideration
"by the subcommittee.

(Action supporting Clark's
testimony came from the field
in the form of telegrams sent

f to members of the Interim-

committee by Mine-Mill locals

tion. As reported to the Mine-
Mill Union, among those 10-

, cals wiring their views for the

>l= *

THE BILL, HR 84 intro-
duced by Rep. Ed Edmondson
(D., Okla.), would authorize a
subsidy to small lead-zinc pro-
ducers amounting to the differ-
ence per pound between pro-
duers’ actual receipts and what
they would have been with
lead at 17 cents and zinc at
14% cents. Only those produc-
ing not more than 2,000 tons
of lead and 2,000 tons of zinc
per year would be eligible
for the subsidy.

Clark said the Edmondson

bill did not go far enough “to I

meet the problems of all seg-
ments of the industry,” nor
was it comprehensive enough
“to sustain a domestic lead-
industry under
existing conditions.”

He also called for the
abandonment of the present
lead-zinc import quota system

. ernment support of United Na-

“The broad program
which the delegates to this
convention will undoubtedly
lay out to improve the wages
and~working conditions of our
membership, to e s t a b l i s h
greater guarantees for job se-
curity, and a progressive legis-
lativeoutlook, will need mon-
ey,” Dichter said in his report.

He pointed out that a per
capita and strike fund in-
crease was thoroughly dis-
cussed at the last convention,
and that the delegates, by an
overwhelming majority, had
voted to refer the question to
this convention. The delegates.
felt then, he recalled, that time
was necessary to acquaint all
members with the needs of the
union and thereby secure gen-
eral acceptance for a referen-

dum vote on the increase.
“The response generally on

1' the part of our membership

has been good,” Dichter added.

IN PROJECTING a more
sound and long-range financial
structure for the union as a
whole, he said the Internation-
al Executive Board has three
key goals:

1. To provide for an increase
in general fund income -
money needed “to improve the
servicing of our local unions,
expand our educational activi-
ties, to expand our legislative
work in Washington and the
state capitals, and to defend
the ~-union against those em-
ployer forces who ever seek to
weaken it.”

the delegates for action here

President John Clark to Mine-

Mill’s 56th convention.

Speaking in behalf of the
International ' Executive

‘ Board, Clark declared that the

union’s. members, “who con-
tributed as much as any group
in America to the election of
a Democratic Administration
and Congress, are looking for
answers” to the questions of
how and where the promises in
the “New Frontier” will be
carried out. ’

>5: >1: >7:

HIS REPORT pointed up the
need for a new emphasis on
job and income security in fu-
ture bargaining.

Workers who have lived
through four economic slumps
in the relatively brief post-war
period and have gone through
successive layoffs and cutbacks
will no longer be satisfied with
settlements that fail to begin‘
to meet the problems of job
and income security,” Clark

said. . _
After reviewing higﬁliﬁghts -

of union activity in recent-

ffmonths, he pointed out that

these activities “emphasize the
purpose and meaning of con-
ventions such as this in which

we evaluate our pastinorder g
betterto plan for our future.” f
In this connection, he drew

attention to the fact that Mine»
Mill “is still the dominant un- ,
ion in the non-ferrous metals
industry, and as such, hasthe
responsibility for formulating
and acting upon programs that
will best serve the interests of
all workers in this industry.”
The union’s ability to carry
out that responsibility has al-
ways been based on the close
ties between its leaders and
members as well as the reflec-
tion by the officers of‘ the
needs, hopes and aspirations of
the rank and file, Clark said,
adding: “That has always been

the major source of our
strength against many ob-
stacles.”

“THAT, T00,” he observed,
“is why our spokesmen are
listened to with respect in
state legislatures and in Wash-
ington, because whether our
listeners agree or disagree
with what a Mine-Mill spokes-
man is saying, they know he
is speaking for and conveying
the sentiments of non-ferrous
metal workers.”

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

April. J 1951,," T _.

C Vice-President:

Howard Reports on

Anti-bias Workshop

JUST a few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending a
2-day Workshop and Institute sponsored by the Negro
American Labor Council which was held in the Metropoli-
tan Baptist Church in Washington, D. C. Its purpose
was to discuss race bias in labor, industry and govern-

 ment. I think it’s Worth reporting here be-
cause of our own Mine-Mill traditional policy
against discrimination of any sort.

Some eight hundred Negro workers and
community leaders from more than_ 20 states
gathered for the Workshop to hear witnesses
present evidence of race discrimination in
unions, industry and government.

Chaired by A. Philip Randolph, Council
president and head of the AFL-CIO Brother-
hood of Sleeping Car Porters, the gathering
heard stirring appeals against discrimination
from Cong. Adam Clayton Powell (D., N. Y.)
who is chairman of the House Labor Com-

  

Howard
mittee, Rev. Martin Luther King and others.~ The meeting
was also addressed by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg.

A telegram of greeting from President Kennedy said: “I
fully share your deep concern over the grave issue of unem-
ployment and over the added burdens carried by those who
suffer from the racial bias that still unhappily remains in our

)3

midst . . .

***

ONG. POWELL drew cheers when he demanded “that the ’

powers of the American labor movement be utilized for
the benefit of all workers” regardless of race, color or creed.
Referring to repeated charges during the sessions that the
AFL-CIO had failed to move aggressively to stamp out discrimi-
nation in its ranks, Powell declared: '

“I pledge to you that I shall use every power  my arsenal
of weapons as the chairman of the Committee on Education and
Labor, to see that Democracy shall be practiced where there
can not be the slightest valid excuse—namely, the labor move-
ment . . . The trouble with labor is that it has become soft, has
degenerated into the cocktail, black-tie, Milquetoast, diplomatic

set . . . It's time for labor to get calluses back on its hands
_and fight this battle with all its strength.” '

Actually, the workshop made the AFL-CIO the main target

of attack. NALC chairman Randolphfwho is also an-_,AFL-CIO

Vice-President and frequent critic of its anti-discrimination poli-
cies, demanded that the federation desegregate its -national staff,
its locals and its apprentice program.  

**,*

N HIS keynote address, Randolph said the NALC would keep

‘.‘the conscience of the AFL-CIO disturbed through contin-
uous criticism of its obvious failure forthrightly to come to
grips with the moral issue ofrace bias.”

On race bias in government, Rev. King told the delegates
that “with a stroke of a pen, the President can go a long way
toward ending the crime of discrimination.” The job can be

' done, he said, just as it was in the Armed Forces——by prescrib-

ing stiff penalties for government personnel who defy execu-
tive policy.

The workshop asked President Kennedy to issue an execu-
tive order for a nation-wide crash program for the training of
skilled workers, and a guarantee that federal assistance would
go only to non-discriminatory programs.

***A'

T ALSO called on the President and President George Meany
of the AFL-CIO “to issue a clarion call to the government,
workers and management to respect, recognize and support the
God-given right of every human being, .regardless of race or
color, to. earn a living in the sweat of his brow.”

Also adopted by the workshop was a “code of fair racial
trade union practice” to be presented to the AFL-CIO execu-
tive council.

The delegates wound up the meeting with unanimous ap-
proval of a program recommended by Randolph to end discrimi-
nation in labor, industry and government.

Its major points included: a requirement for “target dates”
to bring about the integration of all local, national and interna-
tional unions in the AFL-CIO; an executive order by President
Kennedy to investigate employment policies of federal agencies;
election of Negro trade unionists to policy-making bodies in the
AFL-CIO; a qualified Negro unionist to act as director of the
AFL-CIO civil rights department.—ASBURY HOWARD.

I-Iere again, the company op-
posed Bess’ eligibility for bene-

argued that he sought work
elsewhere when ABC said it
had no other work available

quently he left his employ-
ment with good cause. The

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, Sen. Lee Metcalf , 
and Cong. Arnold Olsen, .all,of V 
Montana, were given a first- ~
hand briefing on Mine-Mill’s.
metals crisis program in a 
conference.March 3 with Dis- J ‘ ,‘
trict 1 Board Member Ernest  "
Salvas.

The meeting, held in the
U.S. Senate Reception Room,
was devoted to a discussion‘
of providing jobs in Mine-Mill O
communities and how best to
expedite the union’s program
as adopted by the Internation- 
al Executive Board. .

Special emphasis was given
to the metals problem and the
recognition which the Mine-
Mill program gave to Senator
Mansfield’s proposal for world-
wide international approaches

towards seeking solutions.

ON the effects of the metals
crisis in Montana, Salvas told
the congressional leaders that
while the Anaconda company 9 
had announced a 10 percent ‘I s- "
cut in copper production, the '
actual reduction in miners and
smeltermen at Butte and Ana-
conda was more than 20 per-
cent. ' 7

On federal mine safety legis-.
lation, he urged them to press ‘
the Mines Bureau and Public
Health Service for an early _ ‘
report on their joint survey
last year in our industry so
that the survey results would-
be available_ for congressional
action as soon as possible. 

Also discussed "were the  

,main points in President Ken-

nedy’s program, particularly 
on unem loy-ment and social
security. tsalvas’ suggestion,  _
the senators and congressmen  . 
agreed to make sure the job-‘ .

less benefits extension would

not have the voluntary. state
participation structure which, .
in the previous extension law,  ’
had resulted in only a few it
states participating. "

=l= =l< =i=

ALTHOUGH they felt that 
the I-Iouse-passed bill taxing I
all employers would assist in
forcing the states to partici-
pate, they agreed to further "
study the bill to the end that T»
all states would have federal ' 4“
extension of unemployment ‘
benefits. N I. .

They also agreed to protest
to the Labor department’s Em-
ployment Security division re-

» garding the Montana UC Com-

mission’s use of federal funds
to block jobless benefits for
Mine-Mill members who ob- »
tained work during the 1959i
strike. , ,
After Majority Leader Mans- pa _ _.

hours with Sen. Metcalf and ~

for further and more detailed
discussion of the Mine-Mill

getting all unemployed back to
a full week’s work,’ Dulski

promised he would give ‘-‘seri- 

ous consideration” to the short-
er work week proposal.

He also asked for more in-
formation as it developes on
the brass import-tariff situa-
tion, and said he would join
with other Mine-Mill area con-
gressmen in backing the un-
ion’s program.

Jobless Meeting

The evening before the ses-
saw more
than 200 laid-off American
Brass Workers turn out for a
meeting of unemployed mem-
bers called by Local 593’s Po-
litical Action Committee at
the union hall.

In terms of response from
the jobless members them-
selves, the gathering was “ter-
rific.” Important p r o b 1 em s
were discussed covering the
fight for jobs in the shop, com-
munity and nationally, insur-
ance and pension administra-
tion, extension of unemploy-
ment benefits, availability of
federal surplus foods, and the
union’s jobs petition campaign.

The meeting unanimously
voted two motions demanding:
1) the 30ihour week with 40
hours’ pay; and, 2) adoption
by the State Legislature and
Gov. Rockefeller of the federal
extended jobless benefits pro-
gram without the gimmicks
proposed in the state’s. own
plan.

Discussion of all the issues

‘was enlivened by full participa-

tion of the unemployed mem-

bers present. Many volunteered
to help in the circulation of
the jobs petitions around the
community.

Local 593 President Joe
Stefanie chaired the" meeting;
Main speakers were Int’l Rep.
Joe Scioli and PAC chairman
and secretary Ed Michalski
and Pat Pacile. They all re-
ceived standing applause for
the good work being done.

* ﬁll ii‘

MEANWHILE, the Mine-Mill
Buffalo Area-Wide PAC was
proceeding without let-up in its

petition campaign at unem-
ployment compensation offices
throughout the region, getting
tremendous response e v e r y-
where the committee members
went distributing literature on
the union’s anti-depression pro-
gram and collecting signatures
in support of it.

Also being distributed by
the group in their rounds is a
special information leaflet on
federal surplus foods for the
unemployed—what’s available,
how to apply for it, eligibility
requirements and how it can
be obtained.

Steel Raid S 2

Blocked in C

Anaconda

ANACONDA, Mont.-—An at- ‘

tempted Steel raid on Ana-
conda Local 117 was stopped
cold last month through a de-
cision of the National Labor
Relations Board, it was an-
nounced here March 13 by
Mine-Mill District 1 Board
Member Ernest Salvas.

The Steelworkers filed an
appeal Feb. 10 with the NLRB
in Washington, D. C., on their
petition for a representation
election in Anaconda Local 117
which had been dismissed by

the NLRB Regional Director in «

Seattle. The top NLRB de-
cision upheld the Regional Di-

rector's dismissal of the Steel A

petition.

In its ruling, the top Board
said:

“The Board has carefully
considered your request for re-
view of the Regional Director’s
dismissal of the petition in the
above case and decided that
the union security clause in
the Jan. 13, 1961, contract is
not invalid, that the contra»ct’s
execution during the recom-
mended sixty-day posting pe-
riod in Case No. 19-CA-1928 did
not affect the validity of the

contract and that there was no A

merit to the Appellant’s argu-
ment to restore the General
Electric X-Ray doctrine. Ac-
cordingly, the Board decided
that the existing collective bar-
gaining agreement between
the Company and the Unions
is a bar to the petition of the
Appellant. The Regional Di-
rector was, therefore, war-
ranted in dismissing the peti-

' tion. . . .”

(Case No. 19-CA-1928 re-

ferred to above concerns the .

unfair labor practice charges
filed by Salvas last year fol-

’ lowing the separate negotia-‘

tions in Local 117. That case
was won by Mine-Mill.)

Commenting on the Board's
ruling, Salvas said: “This ae-

t tion by the NLRB, upholding

the union’s recently executed
contract as a bar to an election,
eliminates a raid in Anaconda
this year which Steel has been
attempting to generate with a
full staff, office, publicity and
a few subsidized smeltermen.”

Connecticut Brass Locals Back
State Slump Relief Measures

HARTFORD, Conn.—Support for two measures to relieve Brass Valley Areas
hard hit by unemployment was expressed by Connecticut Mine-Mill Legislative Com-
mittee members at a hearingof the Legislature’s Labor committee here Feb. 21.

The measures, in the form of Senate joint resolutions, urge-the Legislature to pe-
tition the U. S. Congress to consider a broad public works program, re-evaluate the

statutes on foreign imports
and other steps to alleviate
brass industry joblessness.

Attending the Feb. 21 hear-

President's Corner:

 

Clark Recalls Plan for Stabilized Economy

IGHT years ago this union published a proposed pro-
gram to stabilize our country’s economy which we
called “A World at Peace.” That program considered
the effects of a change from a war economy to a peace-
time economy and proposed measures for making such a
transition easier on workers, who, normally, - —
always hear the burden of economic dislo-
cation.

The present serious situation facing the
American worker is seemingly not brought
about by any let-up in the defense program
or lessening of the fear of a catastrophic
world war.

Nevertheless, we are in the throes of an
economic depression which has already re-
duced nearly; six million workers to the
status of recipients of federal or state aid or
relief.

“A World at Peace” sharply outlined the
inevitable economic consequences of our nation drifting with a
policy of letting tomorrow take care of itself rather than adopt-
ing a decisive program to offset these economic dislocations.

* ‘k ‘Ir

HE POTENT points of our program to stabilize our economy
T and the non-ferrous metals industry were: v

Promote conservation of scarce metals; conserve -human
resources by shorter work-weeks in underground mines and
enactment of federal mine safety laws; raise the Plirchasing
power of the workers by enactment of a $1.25 hourly minimum
wage; lower the income tax on workers; take steps toward an
eventual 30-hour week for all workers; enable the farmer to
enjoy a living standard comparable to the rest of the population
by full parity payments; expand Social Security and unemploy-
ment benefits; develop the country with an enormous federal
program including home-building, school construction, hospital
expansion, completion of rural electrification and extension of
rural telephone service; stepped-up highway construction; vast
river valley development projects; and finally, greatly expand
foreign markets by’ freeing the channels of world trade and
promoting development of underdeveloped countries.

While our advocacy of these proposals has since been
echoed by other unions, and in some cases by the Congress, we
were, at the time we made them, the object of severe criticism.

_ ' * ‘*. it '

ODAY‘ the repercussions of American “foreign aid,"-as it

was administered by the past two administrations, sire being
felt by millions of American workers and their families. Most
of our allies and former enemies have been enjoying a. yigorous

 

Clark

business boom. West Germany has no» unemployment and is’ I

importing workers from other European countries; it is moving
into manufacture of all types of goods and expanding its world
trade, largely at the expense of U. S. exports. ’

In our own country this competition is throwing many
brass workers and workers of other American, industries into
the melting pot; of unemployment. No American worker can
compete with the wage rates of other nations and keep our
much vaunted standard of living.

Low-wage Japanese industries are growing by leaps and
bounds and are becoming the foremost competitors in world
markets. In a short span of time Japan has become the No. 1
shipbuilder in the world. In our industry we feel this competi-
tion especially in the importation of brass goods.

it * *
RONICALLY, the defense costs of some of these competitor
nations are of little concern to them for we, as a protector
of “free” nations, carry the major portion of those costs in mili-
tary supplies and armed bases.

This relieves them of any financial worries on this score
and gives them full freedom to industrialize their countries and
market their products at our expense.

Brass mill products from other countries in the past six
years have increased fourfold, with some of the largest in-

creases coming from Sweden, Japan, England, West-Germany

and Belgium. , g
* ‘k * _ ‘
NOTHER deadly job killer, automation, to date has had no

serious planning applied to it with a view to easing the
unemployment it creates. No one seems to have any clearcut

  

proposal to retrain workers displaced by automation. The quan-
dary lies in what line of work to train them for and where is
that work to be found‘?

Unemployed workers in Montana now equal 15.1% of the
total work force. In VVest Virginia the rate is 13.0%; in Mich-
igan, 13.6; in Ohio, 9.5%; in California, 8.8%; and in New York,
8%. Alaska now has the highest unemployment rate of any
state—19.7%. National statistics show that every year 800,000
young people graduate from school and move into the labor
market.

In our own jurisdiction, among the towns and districts clas-
sified as having substantial labor surpluses are Ansonia, Bridge-
port, Waterbury and Torrington, Conn., and Butte, Mont.

OWARD the end of World VVar II, Franklin D. Roosevelt

said:

“In our day these economic truths have become accepted as
self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of
Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can
be established for all—regard1ess of station, race or creed.
Among these are:

“The right of a useful and remunerative job in the indus-
tries, or shops or farms or mines of the Nation; the right to
earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recre-
ation; the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products
at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;
the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an
atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination
by monopolies at home and abroad; the right of every family
to a. decent home; the right to adequate medical. care and the
opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; the right to a

good education.”

Did this message fall on deaf ears? The present economic

situation certainly says ‘fYes.”

***

ET US hope that President Kennedy will seriously try to
alleviate present misery and follow through as we believe
Roosevelt would have done in not only advancing a program
for our nation’s and the world's economic stability, but using

c all his power to activate it.

In this, I am sure, he will have the full cooperation and
support of our membership and that of all workers and citizens
who have inthe past and continue-to hope now for this type

of leadership.»-——JOHN CLARK.

AFL-CIO
Ups Percap
60 Percent

MIAMI BEACH, Fla.——The
National AFL-CIO Executive
Council at its meeting here

last month ordered a 60 per‘

cent increase in per capita pay-
ments from all affiliated
unio-ns to make up a $2.2 mil-
lion deficit in the federation’s
operating expenses.

According to reports out of
the meeting, the AFL-CIO has
lost about two million mem-
bers in the last five years.
Major factors listed for the
loss were unemployment and
failure to achieve organizing
quotas.

The new per capita levy is.

in the form of a special three
cents -per month assessment
per member on top of the
regular five cents a month
dues payment for each mem-
ber made by every affiliated

union to the national federa-s

tion.
:1: :§< :
AFL-CIO leaders were re-
ported viewing the 60 per cent

!<

per capita hike as a current-

expedient to meet the federa-
tion’s financial crisis. A per-
manent two-cent b0 0 st to
bring the regular mo-nthly per
capita dues from each affiliate
to seven cents per member is
expected at the AFL-CIO’s
convention next December.

An Associated Press dispatch

on the 10-day Council meeting .

said:

“Pronouncements from the To
AFL-CIO leaders have largely
dealt with international and 1

domestic probiems not too
closely allied with the bread
and butter wage and job secur-
ity mat:.ters that worry the
average worker.” ‘

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Congress started to mesh gears last month with some
advances ontop priority measures proposed by President Kennedy to halt the nation-

al recession.

With unemployment continuing to loom as the nation’s worst domestic problem,
the Senate passed 84-4 the administration’s emergency anti—sl.ump bill, previously ap-

proved by the House, pro-
viding for the temporary
extension of unemployment
benefits to workers exhaust-
ing their regular state pay-
ments.

As cleared now by both
Houses, the UC measure au-
thorizes the Labor department
to make agreementswith the
states to prolong duration of
benefits by 50 percent for un-
employed workers exhausting
their state compensation pay-
ments between June 30, 1960
and March 31, 1962. The max-
imum- amount of .added bene-
fits would.be 13 weeks.

The bill as passed retains
the Mine-Mill-backed provision
for financing the extended
benefits by making all states
share alike in the increased
costs of the program. Now in
a. joint House-Senate ‘confer-

ence committee, it would make
the benefits p a y able two» V

weeks after President Ken-
nedy signs it.

Eligible to receive immedi-
ate extension of benefits will

be some 725,000 workers who

already have exhausted state
payments. Altogether, govern-
ment estimates indicate some
3 million workers will be
helped by the program.

A COMPANION bill, ena-
bling states to use matching
federal grants to aid depend-
ent children of unemployed
parents, passed the House and
was likely to get speedy action
in the Senate.

Another top. priority meas-

ure, the [$394. m,i,l,lio_’n de- ,

pressed areas bill, passed in
the Senate by a 63-27 vote. A
House banking subcommittee
approved a bill almost identi-
cal with the Senate-passed
version. '
The Senate bill provides
$300 million in federal"-loan
funds and $94 millionin
grants designed to bring new
jobs to communities of long-
duration unemployment.

House labor committee okayed

proved bill cleared for floor.
action would raise the mini-“

mum to $1.25 ‘by increasing
the existing $1 to $1.15 this
year and to the ‘Iiigherfigure
in 1963.

It would also extend cover-
age to a.n additional 4,311,000
workers now exempt from the
law’s provisions. A hard fight
for its passage is expected in

the House. A Senate subcom-

mittee was winding 3 up hear-
ings on a similar measure.
Hearings opened in the
House and Senate on the ad-
ministration’s federal aid to

mediately involved in_ hot dis-_

THE MIN2-MILL UNION

Work Loads Spark
Stoppage in Miami

- _ MIAMI, Ariz.—A one-day work stoppage by Miami

G Miners Union No. 586 completely shut down operations at

Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company’s mine and
smelter here Feb. 20 when 12 members of the union,
including Local 586 President Robert Barcon, were fired

over a dispute on increased
work loads in the tank
house.

Some 1,200 men, including
many in other union jurisdic-
tions, were affected by the
walkout. Operations were re-

‘ sumed only after the company

had agreed to reinstate the 12
discharged workers and nego-
tiate the dispute issue which
sparked the stoppage.

Inspiration is a subsidiary
of the Anaconda Company.

The work load issue came to
a head Feb. 20 when the com-
pany began moving from the
old into the newly built tank
house. Operation of 15 tanks
by a team of two workers had
been considered a shift’s work
in the old tank house for many
years. In the new tank house
the company had increased the
total work load to 20 tanks per
team.

at * fl!

ATTEMPTS of the Local 586
committee to negotiate the
new tank house work load a
Week before the move brought
no results in two meetings
with management. Before
Work on the morning of Feb.
20, another attempt of the
commmittee to resolve the
work load was rebuffed by
company officials whose atti-
tude was that they had noth-
ing to negotiate and that was
it.

The company asked each

-tank house man if he refused

to work. Each one answered:

, ‘‘I 'don’t refuse to work, but I

don’t accept the assignment

you have imposed on me.”
Starting with Barcon, as each
man gave this answer he was
fired. Twelve were fired out
of the total tank house work
force of 70.

The walkout spread rapidly
from the tank house. At noon
the smelter workers walked
off the job. This was followed
by the company's suspension
of all operations until further
notice.

* * >l=

BY 4 o'clock the same after-
noon, management was meet-
ing with Mine-Mill Int’l Rep;
Leo Terrill, Regional Director
Frank Vettorel and the com-
mittee of five men from the
tank house including Barcon,
Angel Gonzales, Pete Benitez,
Salvador Luna and Tony Chai-
dez.

Agreement, ‘ending the stop-

page, was reached on the fol-

lowing terms: 1) that the 12
discharged men be reinstated;
2) a trial period of 35 days be
given the tank house to deter-
mine job content and work
the kinks out of new equip-
ment; 3) negotiations to start
March 10 on the work load
question; 4) that the union
committee and tank house
management meanwhile con-
sult day-to-day concerning the
work load.

The union hopes to resolve
the issue through negotiations
during the 35-day trial period,
but if not, it’s the strong feel-
ing of the men that “the fight
is still on.”

Lead-Zinc Subsidy Plan  

(Continued from Front Page)
tions efforts to stabilize pro-
duction and international trade
in lead and zinc through the
tions efforts to stabilize pro-
negotiation of international
commodity agreements.

Arrangements were original-
ly being made for Clark to tes-
tify before the subcommittee in
person, but his recent illness
ruled that out. His written
statement was submitted for
the record instead.

* =l< =l<

CLARK described “the se-

vere unemployment» and job

insecurity which has been and ‘

continues to be the lot of those
whose livelihood depends on
employment in lead and zinc.”

He pointed out that none
but a handful of the 7,500 hour-
ly paid lead-zinc miners and
millmen still employed, or of
the 6,500 whose jobs have dis-
appeared in the past four
years, have been working in
the small domestic mines
which would- qualify for as-
sistance under the bill before
the subcommittee.

Based on the latest informa-
tion issued by the Bureau of
Mines, Clark said Mine-Mill
estimates that more than 90
percent of all paid production
workers in the industry were
employed in 35 large lead-zinc
mines producing 5,000 tons or
more of lead and/or zinc in
1958.

d< =!< :3

“THE PROBLEM of restor-

ing the jobs lost by these

workers, and giving assurance.

of stability to those fortunate
enough to be still employed,”
he said, “cannot be met by a
program of assistance to small
mines which in large measure
utilize the labor of proprietors,
and depend only to a minor ex-
tent on paid production work-

, ers.”

He urged an industry-wide
subsidy which would apply to
an annual production of 350,-
000 tons of lead and 590,000

tons of zinc, as was proposed
in former Interior Secretary
Seaton’s “Domestic Minerals
Stabilization‘ Act of 1958,”
which passed the Senate and
failed in the House’-by only a
small margin.

Under such a measure, Clark
proposed that subsidies. be paid
to guarantee a return to mine
producers equivalent to what
they would receive if lead were
at 15 cents and zinc at 14 cents
per pound. The amount of sub-
sidy available to any one com-
pany would be limited, based
on recent production.

HE ESTIMATED it would in-
crease U. S. lead and zinc mine
production by about 100,000
tons of each metal annually,
above present levels.

HR 84, on the other hand,
could have some adverse ef-
fects, Clark warned. He point-
ed out that “the increased sub-
sidized production from small
mines could cause further low-
ering of lead and zinc prices,
with possible further cutbacks
a.nd layoffs of workers in the
unsubsidized mines.”

Regarding the government’s
lead-zinc import quota pro-
gram in effect since 1958,
Clark termed it a “failure.”

He assailed the quotas for
not having sufficiently re-
stricted heavy imports from
low-wage areas as well as for
having failed to bring about
any significant revival of the
U. S. lead-zinc mining indus-
try. They have, ,in addition,
served to curt-ail p',1-oduction at
many smelters unable to fill
their ore requirements from
domestic sources, -he said.

He coupled abolition of the
quotas with institution of in-
dustry-wide subsidies as the
major points in .Mine-Mill’s
dual approach to f‘a consistent
basic minerals policy that will
assure some reasonable order
and stability in the lead-zinc
mining industry.”

What's Become of theTheory

Punishment Fits the Crime?

Last December 32 top executives of 29 big electrical corporations

including GE

and Westinghouse——pleaded guilty in Phi1adelphia’s federal district court.

The charge? Conspiracy to defraud the government.

How? By fixing prices,

rigging bids, dividing markets and cheating the government and taxpayers out of

millions of dollars.

The sentences? Thirty
day SUSPENDED sen-
tences for 25 executives. Seven
executives served 30-day jail
sentences with five days off
for good behavior.

Now let’s look at sentences .

given to two other groups of
defendants, labor union lead-
ers, also charged with conspir-
acy.
>l< 7k ‘-l<

NINE present and past Mine-
Mill leaders, all of whom plead-
ed not guilty to charges of
conspiracy to defraud the gov-
ernment by violating the Taft-

‘ Hartley act, were sentenced to

from 18 months to three years.
The case is now under appeal
and the union is confident it
will be won because none of

these leaders is guilty of any— 0

thing except trying to lead an
honest, democratic union.
Eight, leaders of the AFL-
CIO Textile VVorkers Union
are now serving jail terms of
from three to 10 years for
“conspiracy to dynamite” a
Henderson, N. C., textile mill
—on the evidence of a paid
stool-pigeon, although no dy-
namiting ever took place.
Both cases against the Mine-
Mill and Textile union leaders
were frame-ups based on hear-
say evidence of paid stool-
pigeons, yet they were sen-
tenced to from 18 months to

-10 years while the corporation
executives who -pleaded guilty ..

got a maximum of 25 days in
jail. It certainly makes a‘ dif-

New Labor Support Strengthens

Fight Against Conspiracy Charge

DENVER—Recent weeks have brought new financial support from other unions-
for Mine-Mill's defense against Taft-Hartley “conspiracy” charges. Substantial amounts‘
have been. received from the national offices of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters &.
Butcher Workmen, the Transport Workers Union, andthe Amalgamated Lithograph-

ers of America. Contributions h
internationals as well as’

from other councils and
joint boards throughout the
U. S. and Canada.

These are on top of hun-
dreds of other manifestations
of support previously report-
ed. Accompanying messages
reveal the importance at-
tached by the rest of the labor
movement to the case.

Defense Rests Case

WASHINGTON, D.C.~With
the testimony of District 1
Board Member Ernest Salvas
and l'nt’l Rep. J. P. Mooney,
.\-{line-l\/lill March 3 rested its
defense in the SACB case.

Salvas was on the stand over
a period of five days; Mooney
for a couple of hours. Between
them, they demolished govern-
ment witness Fred Gardner’s
story about his work on the
Zvlontana staff from .1954 to
1955. A

i r-'2".-r 

Basically, Gardner had tried
to say he was fired by Mine-
Mill for opposing the alleged
Communists of whom he
claimed to be one. '

But Salvas showed it was he
himself who decided to fire
Gardner because Gardner was
unreliable and was stirring up
factionalism in the Montana
Anaconda l o c a 1 s. Mooney’s
testimony also tended to show
that Gardner didn’t tell the
truth about the two most im-

portant episodes .relating, to _.

 

in SAC B Hearings

Gardner’s work in Montana.

After Mine-Mill rested its
case, government attorney L.
E. Broome askedytime to ad-
vise whether he would have
rebuttal witnesses, later said
he would have none, but did
put into evidence Mine-Mill
convention proceedings for
1941 through ’44. .

80‘ Package Won in First
Contract at New Inco Mine

WINNIPEG, Manitoba—A three-year 80-cent package settlement was ratified 6

Feb. 26 by two large meetings of the Mine-Mill Local 1026 membership, nailing down
their first contract agreement with International Nickel Company at its big new
Thompson nickel operations in northern Manitoba.

It calls for a 12-cent per hour
wage increase the first year,
10 per cent the second year,
and 11 per cent in 1963. The
standard work week over three
years will also be reduced to
an ultimate 40-hour week by
the third year.

TAKE OVER

years of service will receive
a pension of $175 -per month.
THIS breakthrough on pen-
sion vesting, considered a ma-
jor tvictory-‘by--th,e union’s bar-
gaining committee, was also
hailed as pavingthe way for a
similar victo-ry for Mine-Mill

members at Inco’s operations‘

in Sudbury and Port Colborne
in their fight to achieve this
important principle.

Its introduction in the
Thompson agreement was also
lauded as a (xmt-ribution to the
entire Canadian labor move-
ment. 6

With signing of the agree-
ment, Thompson workers be-
came covered with their first
comprehensive sickness, acci-
de-nt, hospital and life insur-
ance.

BESIDES the breakthrough
on pension vesting, another ac-
complishment achieved in the
tough eight months of bar-
gaining was the membership’s
ridding themselves of the nine-
hour day, 54-hour Week with
which Thompson workers have
been saddled for the past five
years. The reduction to a 40-
hour week by the third year

was won while achieving wage
rates that compare favorably
with others in the industry. .

The main obstacle that had
to be overcolne to make this
latter gain was the fact that
the construction companies at
Thompson had established the
54-hour week with the Build-
ing Trades and Inco continued
those hours when the produc-
tion workers took over from
-construction.

In the company's original
proposal to reduce the work
week, they offered "an increase
in wages of only three cents
per hour.

The Thompson bargaining
committee consisted of Local
1026 President Don Cox,

C h a r 1 i e ’ McPhillamy, Dale 6

Schnee, Financial Secretary
Ken VVood-s, Metro Nazar-
chuck, Mike Hamilton and Bob
Strain. They were assisted by
Canadian National President
K. A. Smith, District 2 Presi-
dent Mike Solski and District
2 Secretary William Kennedy.
The committee was later
augmented by representatives
from Inco- Locals 598 and 637
in Sudbury and Port Colborne.

effect endangered the status
of union officers and shop
committeemen. -

THE company, claiming that
the men had been transferred
and not laid off, said the con-
tract does ‘not grant top senior-
ity in this situation. They also
argued that top seniority for
particular union members is
illegal.

Regarding legality, the arbi-
trator cited a Supreme Court
decision as well as other prece-
dents sustaining the top sen-
iority doctrine. He also said
that “top seniority of shop
committeemen in their jobs
alld in their departments can.
not be adversely affected by
calling what is ill effect a lay-
off a transfer.”

Arbitrator Tischler said fur-
ther: “So long as there is re-
quired any employee in a
particular job classification,
the shop committeeman work-
ing in that job classification
has top seniority and must be
retained by the employer. A

HIS award declared that, un-
der the contract, “shop com-
mitteemen had top seniority
entitling them to be retained
in their job classification so
long as there were any em-
ployees working in that job
classification.”

Finding that “the aggrieved
employees were deprived of
their top seniority,” the arbi-
trator ruled they “are entitled
to be reinstated to the posi-
tions held by them at the time
of the layoff with the pay
fixed for such classification.”

Perth Amboy

PERTH AMBOY, N. J. —
Perth Amboy Smelter & Re-
finery Workers Local 365
scored a very important arbi-
tration victory recently on a

major grievance with AS&R
management over vacation pay
which dates back‘ to 1958.

The case arose during the
metals recession of 1958 when
many members 'were laid off
at. the beginning of the year
and recalled to work at the end
of the year. In this particular
case, 32 men were denied their
vacations by the company
which took the position that
the men had not worked six
months in the year to entitle
them to vacations. ‘

The unio-n maintained that

under the contract there are

no requirements for vacation,
and that employees passing
their anniversary date are en-
titled to vacations upon their
recall to work.
:l< :l< =l<

THE reason this arbitration
case was so important was that
management was trying to es-
tablish another new practice
of having employees work at
least six months -to be entitled
to a vacation.

Arbitrator Monroe Berke 

OMS

witz, who heard the case last
Decelnber, decided in favor of
the union on Jail. 24, with the
result that the 32 men will
now receive all pay for the va-
cation time they were deprived
of in 1958.

The arbitrator held that
there is no requirement to
work any specified number of
days or time in order to qual-
ify for vacation.

3 :;< :3:

SOME of the men had worked

 

only two or three months, and ,

received their vacation pay for
1958 under this arbitration
award.

The decision that the men
do not have to work any re-
quired time to be entitled to
vacation is considered particu-
larly important at this time
because ‘of the serious layoffs
here as well as in the rest of
the industry. ’

ion with the assistance of L0-
cal 365 President John Infu-‘

amounts" are not reflected in the current balance sheet, as in all organizations
accounting on a cash basis, and neither are vouchers for the past period for
expenses and reimbursements in normal amounts to employees. These were
also paid in 1961. ’ '

Statement of Surplus Account (Schedule A-1) reflects the increase for the year
in the excess of income over disbursements reflected in Exhibit B.

EXHIBIT “B”—General Fund Income and Expenses:

The results as shown of the year's operations, do not reflect the fact that
in comparison, the year of 1959 did not include $59,879.50 of assessments col-
lected in that year, which were credited to the account of the International

— Strike Fund for that year. Subsequent collections of the 1959 assessment in

1960 were also credited to that Fund per Exhibit C-1. However, the greater
part of 1960 net income, in the amount of $117,697.25 reflects the collections of
the 1960 assessment which were credited to the General Fund in 1960.

EXHIBIT “C-2”—Councils and Other Funds:

Income and Expenses for the year were reviewed for each segment: Bal-
ances in Bank were confirmed directly with the Central Bank and Trust Co.,
and other accounts were verified by supporting papers in your office. The
Mine, Mill Building Association still holds only non-cash assets. '

Russia to negotiate details on
the Soviets’ recent offer to fi-

ployment-plagued Bolivia.

U. S. government has blown
hot and cold on helping build
a tin smelter in Bolivia, with
some government e x p e r t s
holding it “uneconomical.”
But to counter effect of Soviet

offer, U. S. government swal-

RISING STOCKS of zinc and recent price cuts have touched
off a wave of cutbacks at nearly all major U. S. zinc smelters
and refineries. Cuts announced in the last six weeks are as

follows:
Tons per Percent of

In addition to the above smelter cuts, the Eagle-Picher Com-
pany late last year cut its smelter operations at Henryetta, Okla.,
and early last month cut operations at its Shullsburg, Wisconsin,
mine by 30 per cent. The other companies‘ above which also
mine zinc have all reduced mining operations. These smelter
cuts, if kept in effect for a year, would reduce output by ap-
proximately as much tonnage as was lost in the second half
of 1960 due to strikes at Bunker Hill, New Jersey Zinc and
Mathiessen & Hegeler.

‘I: it

U. S. COPPER may beremoved from the list of commodities
on which the U. S. government has placed an embargo. This
became a strong possibility with the statement last month by
President Kennedy at a press conference that the U. S. is

' anxious for more trade with the Soviet Union if it does not

weaken national security.

The President said, “After all, countries in Western Europe
are carrying on very intensive trade with the Soviet Union, and
some countries with Communist China, so what they cannot get
here they get there.” , V

This fits the copper situation, The Soviets can buy copper
from all over the world (except the U. S.) on the London Metal
Exchange, Congo copper from the Belgians, and in Rhodesia
and Chile. Our embargo on shipping copper to the Soviets
doesn’t prevent them from getting all they want, but it cuts us

out.

NEW SMELTING and REFINING plants abroad are an-

JAPAN’S growing copper smelting and refining industry is
reaching out on a worldwide basis for copper concentrates and
scrap. The industry is-being encouraged to grow by the Japa-
nese government's import controls, which limit the importation
of refined copper and fabricated copper. As a result, prices of
copper in Japan are artifically high. When they need to,
Japanese smelters are in a position to outbid other ore buyers.

In Australia, Japanese smelters are successfully outbidding
Australian smelters for Australian concentrates. Strong Japa-
nese buying of copper scrap is the principal reason behind
recent upbidding of copper scrap prices in the U. S., and of
tightness in the supply of scrap. In the last few years, Japan
has ranged far and wide in search of raw materials for its
smelters.

One Japanese producer is partner in mining ventures in
Southwest Africa and Chile. Another Japanese company has
bought into Ravensthorpe Copper Mines in Australia, and still
another is developing copper deposits in the Fiji Islands. Japan
buys copper concentrates from the island of Cyprus in the
Mediterranean, from the Philippines and elsewhere. It mines
only about 90,000 tons of copper per year in Japan, and last year
imported 120,000 tons of copper in concentrates, plus additional
scrap.

In January, 1961, Japanese refineries turned out 23,000 tons

’ of copper—a record. On an annual basis, this would amount to

about 275,000 tons. To feed its growing industry, Japan will be
an ever-stronger competitor in buying ores. It will probably try
to get more o-re from the Phillippines, which now ships part of
its output to the United States, and if large new copper deposits
in British’ Columbia go in-to production, the Japanese will bear
watching there. -

concern ‘of the delegates—the
deepening crisis in non-ferrous
metals and its relation to the
general economic recession——
Clark’s report emphasized that
both can be improved- “through
prompt and vigorous action.”

It also announced plans for
a more intensive program of
Washington activity than ever
before.

AS REGARDS the current
industry recession, Clark said
its most disturbing aspect “is
that it follows so rapidly upon
the 1958 recession and was pre-
ceded by two years of very

disappointing ‘recovery’ in 1959

and 1960.”

About the only business in-
dicator that continued to look
favorable as the depression
deepened was corporate profits
augmented by depletion and
depreciation allowances which,
he said, reached a record high
under the business-minded tax
rules of the Eisenhower admin-
istration.

“American corporations, un-
der this sort of set-up, have
become virtually depression
shock-proof,” the report de-
clared.

>51 >l< 

SPECIFICALLY directed to
the problems of the non-fer-
rous metals industry were a
series of proposals adopted
earlier by the International Ex-
ecutive Board and recommend-
ed in the President’s report for
convention action. ’

. For the industry as a whole,
Clark’s report of the officers
proposed: establishment of a.
United Nations Metals Bank to
acquire surplus metals and use
them in development programs
in underdeveloped countries;
negotiations of international
commodity agreements in cop-
per, lead and zinc; more fed-
eral research on new uses of
non-ferrous metals, explora-
tion and exploitation tech-
niques; removal of unrealistic
restrictions on exports of U. S.
metals and metal products;
and enactment of a federal
mine safety bill for metal
miners.

The report, in recommend-
ing a new approach to the
specific problems of copper,
lead and zinc, called for the
abolition of U. S. import quotas
on ‘lead and ‘zinc, and federal
subsidies on newly mined cop-
per, lead and zinc.

TERMING the 3 year-old
quota program a failure, the
report assailed the quotas as
insufficiently restrictive, for
having failed to revive" domes-
tic lead-zinc mining, and for
not giving preference to im-
ports from countries with ade-
quate wage standards.

Tl1e metal subsidies pro-
posed in Cla-rk’s report would
operate to guarantee to mine
producers a return equivalent
to 27V; cents per pound on 1,-
000,000 tons of copper per year,
15 cents per pound on 350,000
tons of lead, and 14 ‘cents per
pound on 550,000 tons of zinc.
The amount of subsidy avail-
able to any one company would
be limited, based on recent pro-
duction.

With regard to the brass in-
dustry, the report pointed out
that about one of every three
workers has lost his job since
1947, six thousand of these
just in the last 18 months.
Unemployment has been ac-
centuated by the loss of about
10 percent of the domestic
market to imported brass mill
products, equivalent to a loss
of 2,500 jobs.

The report

urged higher

' tariffs on brass mill products

and said definite steps will be
taken this spring to obtain

higher tariff‘ rates from the

Tariff .Com‘mission. It also
urged cooperation of the in-
dustry and other unions in
support of such action.

A major section of Clark's
report dealt with political and
legislative action, reviewing
the 1960 elections- and the
promised “New Frontier” of
the Kennedy Administration to
date.

=l= >3 *

HE NOTED the significant
influence exerted by the un-
ion on final election results in
many areas, particularly in
Montana, Arizona, New Mex-
ico, Utah and Nevada. De-
spite the Democratic victory
nationally, he recalled that the
Republican swept the West.

“Yet,” he said, “it was also
here, where’ Mine-Mill mem-
bership is concentrated, that
our political weight was most

, evident, for it was precisely in
"those areas that Mine-Mill sup-

ported candidates were most
successful in bucking the gen-
eral GOP trend.”

- Turning to an evaluation of
the new Administration, Clark
commended its emphasis on
measures to halt the recession,
including the" depressed areas
bill, self-financing health care
for the aged and its approach

  
  

to a much needed over-haul of

the unemployment compensa-

tion system.
>Z= >l= 3.:

AT THE same time, he ob-
served that, on the record to
date, “we’re a long way off
from the promised New Fron-
tier . . . little has been asked
of Congress or achieved‘ by
executive order to differen-

tiate its economic programs

from that of its predecessor.”
' On the debit side of the new
administration program, Clark
pointed to two elements which
he sait
dangerous for free collective
bargaining and for the job se-
curity of production workers.”

He listed them as govern-
ment moves to inject itself
more than ever attempted be-
fore into labor disputes, and
its proposal to authorize fast-
er depreciation tax write-offs
which would enco-urage m.ore
automation and result in dis-
astrous impact on production
workers’ employment.

=l= >Z< *

TI-IE OFFICERS’ report pro-

posed a broad‘ and detailed

program of measures to coun-

teract the present recession
and strengthen the nation’s
basic economic structure.

In addition, “for a better
America,” Clark urged further
legislative and administrative
action in the -civil rights a.nd
liberties field, repeal of the
Landrum - Griffin act and
amendment of the Taft-Hartley
act.

Recommendations in the re-
port onistate legislation cov-
ered unemployment and work-
men’s compensation, mine
safety codes and right-to-work

laws. .
' >l< >l< *

IN A REVIEW of bargain- :
ing developments during the V
year, Clark pointed to the un-'

ion’s success in negotiating

contract extensions with AS&R ’
and Magma Copper as well as .

agreements reached with the

ing for substantial wage gains
and other contract improve-
ments, and all without strikes.

He linked these gains with
immediate -bargaining goals
for 1961 as well as for. future
perspectives, stressing job and
income security.

Foremost among the job se-
curity demands projected in
the report w a s the shorter
workweek without loss in take-
home pay. Calling it “the most
effective way of creating jobs
for the growing number of
unemployed,” Clark 0, said the
demand must be pushed by the
entire labor movement and
coupled with legislative activ-
ity.

Other measures listed were
longer vacations for older em-

ployees, earlier retirement for.

pensioners, severance pay and
supplemental unemployment
benefits.

STATING that higher wages
will of course continue to be a
major bargaining objective,
Clark also pointed to the ex-
tension of additional goals on
which the union has already
made some notable progress,
chiefly: ‘

The development of a_more
equitable industry-wide wage
structure to eliminate all-exist-
ing inequities; and further de-
velopment of a common per-
spective on pensions to elimi-
nate'variations in both benefit
provisions ..a nd ...expiration
dates, as well as improved
benefit standards to include
vesting rights.

Goals enumerated for bar-
gaining on health and welfare
included: continued improve-
ment of benefits, reduction of
employee contributions, im-
provement in quality of medi-
cal care, extension of out-pa-
tient prescription benefits, den-
tal care, coverage for retired
employees, and joint (adminis-

-tration of plans.

Other major sections of the
report covered civil rights and
civil .liberties, foreign policy,
union defense, administration,
work of the union in Canada,
and labor unity. A

we can have.”

3. To build up a half-million-
dollar contingency reserve in
the union’s general fund for
meeting all contingencies aris-
ing in the future.

On the basis of Board discus-
sion as well as recommenda-
tions in resolutions from. many
locals to this convention, Dich-
ter, in behalf of the Board, pro-
posed a 75-cent per month per
capita increase.

The proposal would set aside
25 cents of the total per capita
for the Strike Fund, instead of
the present 5 cents. The bal-
ance of the increased per cap-
ita would be divided between
the increased general fund out-

lays and the development of a
sizeable reserve balance.

IN A review of finances,
Dichter reported that during
1960, “through the practice of
most stringent economies,” the
union was able to stretch in-
come to meet operating ex-
penses. The small operating
surplus provided by the assess-
ment, which is still coming in,
enabled the union to repay
most of the debts incurred dur-
ing the national strike, he said,
adding that the International
Union will be clear of all debt
by the end of 1961.

At the same time, he noted
that the end of last year
showed expenses rising above
income as a result of neces-
sary staff expansion and an

accelerated pace of activity on
all levels, including the assign-‘
ment of a Washington repre-'
sentative and more heavy in-
volvement in state legislative
activity.

As to the present and im-
mediate future, he said Mine-
Mill’s financial problems, no
different than those of any
other union in the country, are
and will be increased by con-
tinual rise in costs covering
every phase of day to day op-
eration on the one hand, with
depressed industry curtail-
ments reflected in reduced
membership dues income on
the other.

Pointing out that expenses
have gone up and every union
in the basic industries has lost
members as a result of auto-
mation, Dichter said: “Any un-
ion desirous of doing an ade-
quate job representing its
membership during this diffi-
cult period finds it necessary
to increase its income.”

He also pointed to the tie
between the financial well-be-
ing of the International with
that of the local unions, urg-
ing the development of dues

_ structures adequate for the lo-

cal’s needs. He reported the
issuance of a financial secre-
tary’s handbook; by the Inter-
national’ to assist local officers
in carryng out their duties.
