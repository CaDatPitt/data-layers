Nguyen Van Thieu, President of
the Republic of South Vietnam, has been
using every method possible to prolong
his position as a dictator. Despite the
provisions of the Peace Agreement
signed in January of 1973, the Saigon
government continues to enforce laws
prohibiting freedom of the press and
freedom of speech; they continue to hold
in prison over 200, 000 political prison-
ers; and in January of this year, Thieu
announced that the elections called for
in the Paris Agreement would not be
allowed to take place. This refusal to
hold elections is exactly the same tac-
tic used by President Diem in 1955 after
the French were defeated.

Since the January cancellation of
e1ections,Thieu has repeatedly tried to
increase the tension in South Vietnam
through military operations and public
statements in an effort to extract more
money from the U. S. Congress. This
effort reached a high point on April 16th
when the Saigon government refused to
negotiate any further with the Provision-
al Revolutionary Government (PRG) of
South Vietnam. The U. S. Congress,
however, reacting to mounting public
pressure, recently refused Pentagon
requests for a $474 million increase in
aid to Saigon. Two weeks later, the
Pentagon announced the discovery of an
"accounting error" which would have
perrnitted them to send an additional
$266 million in military aid to Saigon.
The Senate responded to this by voting
43 to 38 to prohibit any additional funds
from being sent to Saigon for the re-
mainder of this fiscal year ending on
June 30, 1974, thereby holding the ceil-
ing for 73-74 at $1. 26 billion in aid to
Saigon. 7

Recent statements by Henry Kis-
singer indicate, however, that the Nix-
on Administration has no intention of
following the Paris Agreement. In a
recent letter to Senator Edward Kenne-
dy, Kissinger stated, "We provide the
Republic of Vietnam the means neces-
sary for its self defense and for its e-
conomic viability, " and that this would
continue because the U. S. "derived a
certain obligation from our long and
deep involvement in Vietnam. " This
support is all in direct violation of the
Paris Agreement; an agreement that
Kissinger himself helped to negotiate!
Whether Congress will follow Kissing-
er's advice and vote to continue aid to
Saigon for fiscal year 1974-75 awaits to
be seen.

In reaction to the dwindling sup-
port in Congress for continued funding
and the bleak prospect that faces Presi-
dent Thieu, the Nixon Administration is
working on another strategy to maintain
the Saigon regime. Through the inter-
national lending institution, the World
Bank (of which former Defense Secre-
tary Robert McNamara is now Presi-
dent), the U. S. is making plans for
shifting the burden of keeping the Saigon
economy alive. In the report of the re-
cent World Bank fact-finding mission to

Saigon, it was noted that inflation was
running at better than 60% in 1973 and
that the regime was forced to devalue
the piaster nine times in the course of
a year. The conclusions of the World
Bank are that "net aid required in 1980
would still be on the order of $770 mil-
lion a year, or about $100 million high-
er than seems probable for 1974. " In
accord with the Nixon Doctrine announc-
ed in Honolulu five years ago, the World
Bank, in conjunction with the Internation-
al Monetary Fund and the Japan-led
Asian Development Bank, is now seek-
ing to shift the cost of the war to other
countries. Through this new strategy
the U. S. Government is hoping to pro-
vide other nations with a stake in Thieu's
survival.

THE LIBERATED AREAS

The liberated areas of the PRG
offer a sharp contrast to the chaos of
the Saigon-controlled areas. In the lib-
erated areas, elections have been held
on a regular basis with candidates made
up of peasants, workers and profession-
als. Today some 1500 villages, 184 dis-
tricts, 44 provinces and six towns and
cities have held elections in PRC zones.
According to a report in the Far East-
ern Econornic Review, "The PRG lead-
ership was of the people, for the people.
They had to be, for they were entirely
dependent on the people for vital infor-
mation, for protection, even for food.
The policies they followed in an area
once it was liberated reinforced their
indentification with the common people."

Once an area is liberated, the
PRG makes every effort to set up

schools and health clinics and develop
the agriculture. A delegation from
Sweden visited the liberated areas in
January of this year. They reported,
"The delegation saw a well-organized
administration functioning with popular
support. There are no traces of famine
to be seen. Children look healthy and
full of vitality, the food distribution sys-
tem seems efficient. They have estab-
lished shops and markets and there is a
large number of small traders, so that
every village, even remote ones, is
supplied. Along the road one can see
many small traders selling fruits, veg-
etables, chickens, piglets, etc."

The other important aspects of the
liberated areas are the roles of women
and the roles of the armed forces. Wo-
men in these areas are provided all of
the opportunities that men are provided.
They work the land; are village chiefs,
electrical ‘engineers, mechanics,
teachers and serve in the armed forces.
The Peoples Liberation Armed Forces,
when not engaged in combat, are busy
helping with harvesting crops, building
homes and schools, administering free
medical care and training. They are all
volunteers who receive no salary and no
medals. Their only reward is ultimate
victory.

The chaotic and undemocratic
government of Nguyen Van Thieu is sur-
viving only on the aid supplied by the
U. S. Government. We demand that the
Peace Agreement signed by the U. S. be
implemented. Join us in Washington,
DC, this coining July 1st - 4th to demand
an end to all aid to Thieu and full im-
plementation of the Paris Agreement.

  AMNESTY CAMPAIGN  

"Of course, if you were a general who had illegally
bombed North Vietnam, falsified records and retired
on a fat pension, I might feel differently. " \

Robert Johnson and Richard Bucklin
are two war resisters whose cases
have been singled out for special focus
by the National Council for Universal-
and Unconditional Amnesty4(NCUUA)‘,

s a coalition of organizations working

for amnesty for all war resisters.
They are two of the hundreds of thou-
sands of resisters for whom VVAW/
WSO demands universal and uncondi-
tional amnesty. Their cases differ,
their backgrounds differ, but both
men resisted the U. S. military and.
the U, S. government in their attack
on the people of Indochina.’ '

Bob Johnson was a black communi-
ty organizer in Grenada, Mississippi. ’
His all-white draft board made a
special request to draft him early be-
cause of his civil rights work. As a
black man from a poor family, with no
stake whatever in the Vietnam war,
Johnson fought for and won status as a
conscientious objector. He was draft-
ed and began his alternative service
washing pots and pans in a nearby hos-
pital.

After 16 months of hospital work,
Johnson was transferredfor the third
time; no provision was made for his
accomodation at or transportation to
his new post. In part because hecomes
from a largexand poor family, Johnson
did not go; later, he voluntarily sur-
rendered to authorities.

9

Johnson had been fighting the ra-
cist Mississippi courts most of his
life, andhad won an injunction against
systematic exclusion of blacks fI‘0m
local juries before being drafted. Now
he was faced with that same racist
legal system and, despite a strong de-
fense, was convicted and sentenced to
the maximum five years in prison.

tence was begun, Johnson was sent to
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to be-
gin his sentence.

But he had only been sent from the
racist legal system to the racist mil-
tary. At Eglin he was accused of
"shouting obscenities at a white_wo-
man, " and "fighting with another pri-
soner, " both trumped-up charges.

The Air Force concocted a quick mil-
itary trial, found Johnson guilty, and
took away all his good time (time ser-
ved toward completion of his sentence).
They_also threatened to transfer him.
to the Federal Prison at Texarkana,
once again taking him away from his
wife and family. Johnson is now in the
Pensacola County jail; the appeal for
reduction of the original five-year sen-
tence is still pending (before the same
judge who passed sentence in the first
place), and these newest charges will
be used to show why the outrageous
sentence should not be reduced.

Like the case of Bob Johnson, the
resistance of Richard Bucklin is get-
ting special attention from NCUUA.
Although Bucklin was in the Army in
Germany, he realized that being-part
of the U. S. military tool which the
government was using ‘in Vietnam was
wrong, and went to Sweden. After 4
1/2 years--and after the U. S. had
signed the Paris Agreements--he
turned himself in. He refused the of-
fer of the military to let him serve out
the remainder of his term despite the
promise of an honorable discharge,
and went to trial. The judge prohibited
the defense from mentioning the Viet-
nam war; Bucklin was found guilty and
sentenced to 15 months at hard labor
at the Ft Leavenworth Disciplinary
Barracks, plus a Bad. Conduct Dis-

charge. An appeal is being planned.

Both men resisted the Vietnam
war andthe repressive military; both
men are now in prison--prisons sup-
posedly built to protect society from
people who are a danger to society.
Meanwhile, the people we need to be-

Al°_
. though an appeal for reduction of sen-

protected from--the real criminals of
the Vietnam war--sit comfortably in

Washington, in the Pentagon, in the
corporate board rooms, counting their

profits ‘and planning the next war.

Bucklin and Johnson are only two
of the hundreds of thousands of reasons
why VVAW/WSO will demonstrate in
Washington, DC, on the 1st through the
4th of July. The military and civilian
prisons of the country are crowded
with people who resisted the war in
Indochina; hundreds of thousands more
are branded with less-than-honorable
discharges and prison records. Sup-
port all those who resisted the war.
Come to Washington. '

"I WAS RIGHT IN IDI NG WHAT I DID."

So said Dick Bucklin upon return from 5 years
in exile as an Army AWOL. ’Dick was sentenced
to 15 months in the Stockade for the "crime" of
refusing to fight an illegal, immoral war. Upon
release he will begin his life sentence with a Bad
Conduct Discharge.

More recently his fellow exile in Sweden, Army
AWOL Lewis Simon, was sentenced to 7 months
in the Stockade plus a Bad Conduct Discharge.

In the U.S. there are more than half a million
vets with Bad Discharges -- mostly for resisting
the war and the racism and militarism of the
Armed Forces. Black vets suffer disproportion-
ately.

PRE-TRIAL VICTORY!

“What racial problem?”

aboard the ship - racism which was un-
relenting; intensified by the fact that
less than 4% of the crew of l300.men-‘

(Naples, Italy‘) In an unexpected break,
defense attorneys for the LITTLE ROCK"
11 won an important victory in court last
month when the military judge ordered H ~
a» hearing on illegal wiretapping, of the
civilian defense lawyers‘ offices in
Heidelberg, Germany, by US Military
Intellegence, and the bugging of the
same group's offices in Washington, DC,
by the FBI. '

After examining docum€nts which
proved military bugging of the Lawyers
Military Defense Committee,_ the judge
had to grant a defense motion for a court
hearing, allowing the defense to call the
heads of Military Intellegence for exami-
nation as to their knowledge of wiretap-
ping which might effect the LITTLE
ROCK cases. Because of the ruling, de-
fense lawyers are now inithe process of
attempting to discuss’ the subject of mi-
litary bugging with the heads of Military
Intellegence in Heidelberg, Berlin and
Washington. If the military refuses to
discuss it or to confirm or deny its ex-
istence, they may be ordered to do so
.byithe judge; and if they still refuse, the
charges against the LITTLE ROCK 11
may be dismissed.

This victory, perhaps the most
important of the pre-trial motions, fol-
lowed a month of frustrating legal bat-
tles. A missing tape of critical court-
room testimony, a defense exhibit im-
pounded for "security reasons", a pre-
judiced judge who refused to disqualify

 himself, a racist captain who illegally
convened the court martial, are only a
few of the problems which have beset
the defense in the pre-trial motion stage
of the court martial.

  
 
 
 

For four months, the 50 black sai-
lors stationed on the USS LITTLE ROCK
flagship of the Sixth E leet, protested ani
sopght relief from the racist conditions

were black. Finally, on November 8,

1973, while the LITTLE ROCK was cruis-

ing theiMediterranean waters on maneu-
vers during thepheight of the Middle East
war, fights _broke out and tensions ex-
ploded when a white sailor bashed a

black sailor over the head with a wrench.

A few days earlier, a white marine from
the ship had severely beaten a black
sailor on the beach. Now, months after
the incident, it is only the blacks who
are facing the maximum punishment for
the trouble aboard.

Though no one was seriously in-
jured in the events, onlythe black sai-
lors have been charged with riot and
assault, and are facing Special Court
Martial charges which could result in
6 months in prison and a Bad Conduct
Discharge. The two white crewmen who
precipitated the rebellion have already
been rushed through their trials. One
was acquitted and the other received a

light punishmentﬂand is now back on duty’

on the same ship.

The court-martial of the 11 blacks
have all been convened by the Command-
ing Officer of the ship, Captain Cullins,
a clear violation of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, which requires thata
commander who is personally involved
in an incident disqualify himself. And
until recently, the jury members had
been officers hand-picked by Captain
Cullins exclusively from the ship -
white officers who had witnessed and
prejudgjed the participants of the events.

Seaman James Shernpert, I‘), of
Chicago, Illinois, had this to say in a
recent statement from Naples: "I, along

with others, was charged with riot and
assault. So they shipped us to Naples

for court martial. We have been here

for almost six months, and frcim the ,
time we've been here it has been nothing
but trouble. The petty officers in charge ’
of us are writing us up on jive tips. For
awhile we were all going to Captain's
Mast almost every week for something
stupid. And whether we were right or
not, the Captain would burn us. I had a
clean record before I came here, but

' now I have two captain's masts‘ and two

courts martial. . The captain always
says, ‘Those are my petty officers, and
I stand behind them 100%. ' So, we
Couldn't win. '

"It is not bad enough that the white
man is trying to burn us, but we have
brothers telling on brothers, brothers
It's bad to
think that a black man fighting for his
rights has to go through a lot - being in
this (expletive deleted) outfit where you
are not wanted, fighting a losing battle
with the white man, and having to watch
outfor the colored boys that are trying
to defeat you right along with the white
man. "’

Seaman Eulie Jessie, 24, _of Hop-
kinsville, Kentucky, said in his state-
ment: "1 would like to let everyone
know how unfair and prejudiced this
Special Court Martial is. There is ly-
ing and deceit on the part of the govern-
ment, convening authority and the pros-
ecution. This Special Court Martial is
just a mockery of justice. I am a Black
American., I am proud to be an Ameri-
can. This is why I joined the Navy. I
wanted to serve my country. But, this
court martial has turned me against the
Navy and the government. They have
destroyed evidence such as tapes and
messages that were to be used in our.
behalf. The Captain of the Uss LITTLE
ROCK has been, andstill is, lying abort
the incident that happened on board on ‘ -
November 8, I973."

Seaman Martin P. Williams, 23,
from New Orleans summed up the feel-
ings of the LITTLE ROCK brothers in
his statement: "It is my belief that the
military judge, like all other high rank-
ing officers fear the future eroding of
their authority if thiscase were seen for
what it really is - just a group of blacks»
who dared to speak up on an admiral's
ship and get away with it. i

"I'm now here in Naples awaiting
trial. Given what's been happening, it
will be an unfair trial, judged by a one-
sided organization. Is this to be called
an act of democracy?"

"All these people look like savages
The only reason they have that white
lawyer is because they can't speak Eng-
lish. "
A Scholfield Army Officer
at the Grance-Kealoha

hearings - April, 1974

The trial of Peter Kealoha and
Danny Grance has been rescheduled to
begin on May 29th. Peter Kealoha and
Danny Grance are two Hawaiian Gls
charged with AWOL and disrespect to
an officer and sergeant. Additionally,
Grance faces charges of assault and
Kealoha is charged with making a threat
all arising from an incident last Decem-
ber 11th when both men were restricted
to their barracks and had consumed a
considerable amount of beer. A dis-
turbance broke out, and the commanding
officer decided to throw Grance and Ke-
aloha in jail pending further investiga-
tion. Faced with going to jail, intoxicat-
ed and being yelled at and insulted by a
racist sergeant who was more intoxicat-
ed than they, both men expressed all of
the resentment and anger they felt as
local people toward the Army._ Kealoha
now faces a sentence of 5 years, and
Grance could receive a sentence of up
to 15 years.

Q. ; -1-._vn..*‘I
3.3.1: 5. ,2

Peter Kealoha is 19 years old. He
was born and raised in the Waianae-Ma-
kaha area and is of Hawaiian descent.
He served well and honorably in the
Army for 17 months until a combination
of unkept promises, failure to be pro-
moted, racist treatment and harassmert
and racial tension at his assigned base
in Germany led him to remain in_Hawa-
ii after leave time and, later turn him-
self in as an AWOL so he could remain
at home in Hawaii.

Danny Grance, 20 years old, born
and raised in Aiea, is also of Hawaiian
descent. He enlisted in the Army be-
cause of what he calls "the volunteer
draft; what else can you do; there are no
jobs. " Danny maintained an excellent
record including twoletters of commen-
dation for 16 months until racist treat-
ment and a series of unfair incidents

« caused Danny, like Pete,\to decide to

go AWOL and come home to Hawaii.

It was because these two experienc-

ed similar treatment at bases thousands
of miles apart (Pete in Germany and
Danny in Colorada) that they each de-
cided to go AWOL and return to Hawaii.
They were each assigned to a "reassign-
ment platoon" at Scholfield Barracks
where they then met and were together
on the night of the incident.

Defense Counsel Eric Sietz has
argued that the facts disclose nothing
more than a drunk and disorderly inci-
dent in the barracks which was blown all
out of proportion by the officers invol-
ved. Sietz called attention to testimony
of the Military Police that they could
have resolved the situation easily with-
out the interference of the officer and
sergeant who later claimed to have been
assaulted, and who was also intoxicated
at the time. "It is simply outrageous,"
Seitz stated, "that a minor incident of
this nature can be handled with such in-
sensitivity to the racial implications,
and that the Army could even think of

 sending people to prison on the facts

presented here, which every neutral ob-
server has concluded cannot constitute
serious criminal conduct by any stan-
dard. Many people in the community
are upset and angry about the Army's
handling of this case, involving two local
guys, and their anger is justified. '.'

General Gatsis, Commander of
the US Support Command, Hawaii, evi-
dently is not too concerned about the

’ feelings of the community OR of Peter’

and Danny. General Gatsis has totally
ignored the recommendations of _t_‘_N_(3
investigations of the,incident. Both in-
vestigations recommended a Special
Court Martial in which the maximum
sentence is six months. The General,
however, is determined toisee that
Grance and Kealoha get the civilian e-
quivalent of a felony conviction through
a General Court Martial.

The Grance-Kealoha; case has

g again aroused the long-felt anger over

the persistent abuse and exploitation of
the US Military. From the original
overthrow of the Royal Hawaiian govern-
ment by _US Marines to the present day,
the US Military has had a heavy hand on
Hawaii. With‘;ll0 separate installations
in Hawaii, the US Military controls 6.9%
of the land of Hawaii, including 25 % of
the island of Oahu and the entire island
of Kahoolawe which is used for bombing
practice. Hawaii was also the command
center for the electronic_warfare used
in Indochina.

Vietnam Veterans Against the War/Winter Sold-
ier Organization is a mass, anti-imperialist organ-
ization based on the accomplishment of its objec-
tives. Founded by anti-war Vietnam vets in 1967,
"the organization has learned, through our history,
that the war in Indochina was a conscious design of
the U. S. government to maintain the exploitation of
the Indochinese people, and that the way in which to
stop the continuing war in Indochina as well as fu-
ture wars is to defeat U. S. imperialism. To do
this, we invite all people who agree with the objec-
tives and will struggle for their accomplishment to
join with us.

     
 
 

HISTORY‘ OF vvAw/wso _

Operation RAW (Rapid American Withdrawal),
the first VVAW national action, was a forced march
from Trenton, N. J. , to Valley Forge in the fall of
1970. To show Americans what their military was
doing in Vietnam, vets conducted mock search and
destroy missions, interrogations of prisoners, and
. other manuevers well learned in Vietnam. During
1 Operation RAW the objectives of VVAW were for-

around the trial of William Calley, VVAW conducted
the Winter Soldier Investigation into American War 1‘

Crimes (WSI) in Detroit. Over 150 Vietnam veter- -

ans testified to their personal involvement in war
crimes. The message to the American people was
loud and pointed: My Lai was not sirnply a mistake
‘by an American military unit; in fact, My Lai‘ s
were taking place daily, though usually on a smaller
scale. The U. S. policy of racism and genocide was
the cause, not one confused U. S. platoon leader.
Several Congressional inquiries, a book, and three
documentary films came out of the WSI.

With the spring of 1971 came Dewey Canyon III,
i a limited incursion into Washington, DC. Dewey

mulated. _
In January, 1971, spurred on by the publicity

Both the Republican and Democratic conven-
tions in Miami Beach in the summer of 1972 saw
actions by VVAW, despite a concentrated attack by
the government on the organization through the
Gainesville conspiracy trial. Actions in Miami
Beach were large, militant, and legal: completely
contradicting government charges that we were
plotting violence. The subsequent trial, which
drew nationwide popular support, acquitted the
Gainesville 8 and exposed the government’ s tactics
of lies and infiltration. .

On Inauguration Day, 1973, VVAW was again in
Washington; 5000 people marched to demand that
the 9 Point Peace Treaty be signed and that U. S.
involvement in Indochina; come ‘to an end.

The signing of the treaty by the U. S. govern -
ment did not fool us; we understood that the war
continued with economic and military aid replacing
American combat troops. To bring the issue to
the people once again, we sponsored a week of‘ S01-
idarity with the Indochinese People in October,
1973; in keeping with increased emphasis on com-
munity issues, actions took place across. the coun-
try wherever VVAW/WSO members worked and
lived.

As we identified the enemy as U. S. imperial-
ism, we also opened our membership to all people
who supported the objectives of the organization.
To signal this change, we added "Winter Soldier
Organization" to our name, to become the present
VVAW/WSO.~

HOW DOES VVAW/WSO OPERATE?

VVAW/WSO works through a national, regional,
and local structure to allow individual members of
the organization to decide matters of policy and di-
rection. Individual members belong to a local_chap-
ter and select local leadership (a coordinator, steer-
ing committee, or collective). Local chapters are 9
represented in regional steering committee meet-
ings (held at‘least three times a year) which in turn,
select a regional coordinator or collective. Regions
send representatives to National Steering Commit-
tee meetings, held three times a year, where policy»
decisions for the organization are made; these de-
cisions must be passed by the general membership.

WHAT IS VVAW/WSO DOING TODAY?

National projects and programs of the organiza-
tion are chosen by the membership as a means of %
accomplishing our objectives. We recognize our ob-
ligation to educate people around the continuing war
in Indochina and to agitate for an end to U. S. involve-
ment. A program for universal and unconditional
amnesty for all war resisters is carried forward by
all chapters; many chapters operate discharge‘up-
grade counselling centers for vets with less-than-
honorable discharges. In keeping with our veteran %

 C Obiectives 



1. To demand an immediate cessation of fighting and the withdrawal of all
American troops, planes, and rnilitary and economic aid from Southeast
Asia. We cannot allow one more human being to be killed in Southeast Asia.
We support as a basis for the cessation of these hostilities the various
peace proposals of the People of Southeast Asia or such future plans as they
develop based upon their right of self-determination and actual control of
their own destinies.

.' 1

 - 2. To demand the immediate termination of all other operations by the
 United States Government, its agencies, and American business interests
 that are designed to suppress the rightful struggles for liberation and self-
5'? determination of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This in-
 cludes the maintenance of dictatorial governments, economic domination,
 and the theft of the natural resources of other countries. The United States
;_: should make reparations in a program acceptable to the Indochinese for all
 of the damage done by the United States.

i .

 3. To demand that all active-duty servicemen and women, reservists and
3 national guardsmen be afforded the same rights that are guaranteed by the
ﬂ United State Constitution and Bill of Rights that are presently denied by the

are treated as less than first class citizens. We endorse the efforts of our
active-duty sisters and brothers in their struggle to democratize the mili.-
tary.

‘.00..

4. To support all military personnel refusing to serve against their con-
sciences in wars at home and abroad. We demand that Congress enact leg-
islation for the immediate repatriation of those brothers and sisters who are
in prison or in self-exile by reason of their refusal to serve in the military.
It must also involve an end to all repression and a freeing of all political

7. Resolved to fight racism, to show Americans that our society is perme-
ated by racism, which manipulates whites into viewing non-whites as infer-
ior or less than human. This racism pushes Third World People through
inferior schools to inferior jobs and into combat arms. Thus Third World
People are sent off to die in disproportionately high numbers as we kill
Asians indiscriminately. We also demand the US military recognize its
_complicity in America's domestic and international racism.

8. Resolved to fight sexism, to show that sexism plays a major part in pro-
moting war. We must show Americans our society is permeated by sexism,

5!§..iIfif

which forces an inferior status upon women, reducing them to subservient 5 ,1
sexual objects, and which robs both men and women of their natural growth. 
This institutionalized sexism channels women into unfulfilling, lower paying 
jobs which are servile in nature and purpose; it exploits their bodies for sex 
and profit; and it degrades and dehumanizes them by a double standard of 
morality wholly dependent on the myth of male supremacy. This sexism is 3 ‘-5

exploited by the military, officially defining servicewomen as subordinate
and thorcfughly subjugating them to servile work and the role of a sexual ob-
ject. We resolve to fight sexism within our society, within our own organ-
ization and within ourselves.

9. To support the democratic right of Americans to unionize and strike to
protect their income and safeguard their employment. We consider all leg-
islation designed to suppress these rights, including mandatory arbitration,
to be illegal and not in the interests of the American working people. We

The issue of the‘ many problems
facing veterans in the United States has
been given a great deal of publicity. U
fortunately, all too often the solutions
put forth to solve these problems are
ones that view the struggles of veterans
for a better way of life in utter isolat-
ion from the rest of the American peo-
ple. VVAW/WSO feels that this isaver
serious mistake. Veterans, and the pr
blems facing them, are not separate
from the rest of society. While vets
clearly have particular needs and de-
mands, we cannot allow the fight to ob-
tain them to be carried out in isolation
from the fight to solve the many prob-
lems facing the whole country.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Indeed, the problems facing the Am
erican people today, veterans and non-
veterans alike, are directly a result of

‘ the system of imperialism we are all
forced to live under. If it were not for.
our involvement in Indochina, the re
would be no Vietnam veterans in need 0
vets‘ benefits in the first place. Thus,
demanding veterans‘ benefits without ty
ing these dernands into the struggle a -
gainstimperialism and the root cause of
veterans‘ problems,is like putting a
band-aid on a cancerous sore. Veteran
reforms can be won and should be fought
for; but the struggleymust be carried

out in a united effort with the rest of the
American people against the common
enemy--US imperialism.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
  

Advocating strictly veteran reform-
‘st demands that do not tie the issues
into the larger struggle of the American
eople again st imperialism will lead the
veterans‘ movement up the, same blind
. lley that traditional veterans‘ organiz-
tions have followed for over fifty year
e cannot put the so-called ‘interests’
of veterans ahead of the interests of the
rest of the people in this country: Vet-
erans are an inseparable part of US soc
iety and their interests and welfare are

he same as the rest of the American
people. Reformist veterans demands

are not going to stop another war in In-
dochina! While we must continue to
struggle for a solution to the very real
problems facing vets--for the right of
decent medical care, disability compen
sation, education, jobs, housing, and
so forth--the struggle must be carried
out with the understanding all people in
the US have these same rights.

Dear People:

I would like very much to" request
my placement on your mailing list
for receipt of Winter Soldier.

After having reviewed a copy of
your publication that another brother
happened to have, I sincerely feel
that your publication offers the most
thorough presentation and analysis
of the world-wide fight against im-
perialism and all its neo-colonialist
lackeys.

I would therefore appreciate it
you would allow me to keep up with
the world revolutionary struggle while
I fight for my/our own immediate
emancipation from within these re-
pressive walls.

Hasta la Victoria Siempre

Attica, N. Y.

Dear Comrades:

We established friendly and coop- ’
erative relations with the Yokosuka
chapter of the VVAW/WSO whose pro-
grams we have found very devoted, re-'
volutionary, patriotic and internation- .
alistic. '

The April 3 issue of The People‘ s
Korea will print a contribution from a
sailor aboard the Oklahoma who is
leaving for the States for a new assign-
ment.

   
     
       
         
     
     
   

ETTERS,

 

We are also planning to reprint the
full text of the February issue of Win-
ter Soldier story "U. S. Blocks Reuni-
fication of Korea" which is totally pro-

per and correct.

We concluded that the objectives of
the VVAW/WSO are entirely revolution-
ary and correctly worked out in such
a way as to meet the specific realities

of the U. S.

armed forces and the ra-

pidly changing American and world sit-

uations.

We will be greatly obliged as fra-
ternal people to you if you are kind e-
nough to supply The People‘ s Korea

with two copies of Winter Soldier on a
regular basis which are expected to be

airmailed.

Looking forward to seeing any
VVAW/WSO members when they come
to Japan or hearing from you soon.

Fraternally Yours

Because of the Washington, DC,

Mass. Demonstrations H

;Durnp Nixon/Qrganize to Fight Demo in Chicago

In May, President Nixon released
the transcripts of conversations held in
the White House that pertained to the
Watergate events. The transc‘ripts,all
told about 1, 300 pages, were edited and
incomplete. They enraged millions of
readers, giving public view to the pri-
vate conversations of the men accused
of covering up and planning the break-in
of the Democratic election headquarters
in 1972. A.s a result of these edited-con-
versations, many newspapers suppor -
tive of the President over the.past 25
years, announced that they were ‘moral-
ly outraged‘ at the lack of humanity dis-
played by Nixon and called for his re-
signation or impeachment. Countless
senators and representatives chimed in
their sudden displeasure and joined the
growing bandwagon of citizens demand-
ing the removal of Nixon from office.

Many of the people calling for his
impeachment or resignation were those ,_
who either supported the president or
were in the Republican Party, of which
Nixon is the leader. It is evident that
with the growing revulsion of ‘Nixon's
conduct many of these politicians are
falling over themselves to desert the
sinking ship, and disavow themselves

‘ from the stigma of having been counted

in the President's corner. Democrats
bubbled with glee at the discomfort of
the Republicans, stating that impeach-
ment, not resignation, is the correct
lrnethod of testing whethe r Nixon is guilty
ty or innocent. From their viewpoint
the longer Nixon squirms the better the

 

chances of their trouncing the Republi-
cans in the next congressional election
coming up in just a few months. As they
jockey for position, all of these politi-
cians have only one interest: re -elec-
tion. Nowhere is there concern for the
American people.

Over the past five years, millions of

Americans have more correctly assess-
ed the situation and have come to the
conclusion that Nixon must be ousted
from office. The decisive factor is not
that Nixon planned or covered up the
Watergate break-in. The question of
Nixon's morality and salty language is
not the issue either, although the most
pervasive disclosure of the transcripts
is the utter contempt that Nixon shows
for the welfare of the American people.
Scandals have rocked the western world
recently, toppling the government in
Germany. Economic disasters have
seen the demise of governments in Eng-
land, Iceland and Canada. Strugglesfor
power in France, Israel and Portugal
are the results of no confidence in their
political and economic_systems. The
United States is in a similar situation.

The continued war in Indochina, the

wage‘ controls, the cutbacks in federally
fundedprograms, the high food prices,
the spiralling inﬂation, the fuel hoax
are factors that conclusively show that
the system fronted by Nixon is unable to
meet thevneeds of the American working
people.

These are the real issues, and not
the Watergate events. While the public

  :1. ;#1?€l3&:J ULY

A the streets .

interest in the developments of political
espionage and -‘dirty tricks‘ is high, the
demands for kicking Nixon out stem
from a dissatisfaction with the system.
President Nixon is the symbol of that
system and the public wrath over Nixon's
involvement in Watergate stems from
that dissatisfaction. Congresspeople
and editorial boards of the nation's es-
tablished newspapers have put forward
the position that removing Nixon will re-
move the inability of the system to deal
with the everyday economic conditions
that drag down the American people.

Removing Nixon will not change
the system; it will only change the faces
of those who administer it. The policies
of Lyndon Johnson continued in the years
of the Nixon administration. These pol-
icies are not the products of the Repub-
licans or the Democrats, but of the sys-
tem that exploits people all over the '
world and maintains itself with an in-
satiable lust for expansion and profits.

As part of a growing public aware-
ness of the need to attack this system,
thousands of Americans marched across
the country on April 27thvdemanding the

' ouster. of Nixon from the White House,

while at the same time focusing on the
economic conditions that result from
the system of profits over people. These
demonstrations occurred in Washington
DC, Chicago and Los Angeles. Signs
deinanding "Throw the Bum Out, Organ-
ize to Fight", "Dump Nixon" and "Fight
the Energy Freeze" were seen every-
where". Militant slogans echoed through
The angry demonstrators ‘'
represented a cross. section of the Am-
erican people, with factory workers
joining students. All along the march
routes, ‘people standing on the sides
cheered their support for the demonstra-
tion and its demands, and in many cases
these people joined in the marches.

These demonstrations have occur-
red with increasing regularity during
the past several months, and, as the
conditions worsen in this country, the
militancy of the people increases. It is
apparent that the American people are
totally fed up with the lies of the adrnin-
istration and the system it represents.
It is also clear that the‘ concerted effort
to save the system by Congress and the
highly paid commentators of the nation's
media cannot divert attention from the
real issues at hand. While Nixon ﬂaunts
his contempt for the American people,
and while Congress and the press de-
bate the content of the tapes, the vehe-
mence of the people is not lost to the
corporate board rooms; they recognize
that they are in deep -trouble and are
trying to shore up their decaying sys- ‘
tem, by dragging out impeachment talk.

From July 1-4, VVAW/WSO will
conduct a demonstration in Washington,
D. C. culrninating in a large march and
rally on the Fourth of July, aimed at
expressing the disgust of the American
people. All those who want to show
their contempt for the (expletive delet-
ed) system and Nixon as the symbol of
it, are urged to march on Washington.

Police Harassment Continues

The trial of Gary Lawton (VVAW/
WSO member) and Zurebu Gardner has
been postponed until June 17th. Law-
ton and Gardner are two black men fac-
ing their third trial on the trumped-up
charges of ambushing two Riverside,
California policemen in April, 1971
(the first twotrials ended with hungjur-
ies). The decision for the postpone-
ment was made because of a number of
motions recentlyfiled by defense attor-
neys and co-counsel, William Kuntsler.
A motion for a dismissal of the charges
against the brothers was made, and de-
nied. This decision of denial is being
appealed, thus resulting in the trial's /
postponement. I

The judge who ruled on the dismis-
sal motion also denied a motion asking
that the cases of Gary and Zurebu be
severed and tried separately. However,

— the judge did rule in favor of one of the

defense motions which asked that the
information and evidence held by the
prosecution and State of California be
turned over to the defense. Some of
the state's information will be made
available to defense attorneys, while
some of the information and evidence
will require individual rulings by the
judge before being released. The grant-
ing of this one motion may be consider-
ed as a partial victory with the third
trial approaching. I A

At the time these motions were be-
ing filed, Gary traveled to New York
to participate in a VVAW/WSO sponsor-
ed speaking tour there. He spoke in
cities around New York, taking this
frame-up case to people and building
support for the defense. One of the '
high points of the tour was a rally held
in Buffalo. Approximately 500 people
demonstrated in Buffalo on April 27th
in support of Gary and Zurebu, the At-
tica Brothers, Martin Sostre and
Wounded Knee. Gary said: "We must
push harder and harder in behalf of
the Brothers and in behalf of the Woun-
ded Knee defendants. . . Unless you re-
late in the communities to the murder
of our people, even though they are not
prominent, you can't relate to me and

‘ my co-defendant thousands of miles a-

way." As Gary said, the key to victory
is the daily struggle against our ene-
mies on every front. _

Gary's words are particularly ap-
plicable as we view the situation of in-
creased police repression going on in
the community of Riverside. In the
streets, another un-armed Chicano
youth was gunned-down by Riverside
Police -- the 7th such murder in as
many years. In the courts, William
Palmer (member of the Riverside Po-

FALLEN Bnonu-zn

them who have done it to me.

William (Whitey) Hurst is dead.
William was a member of VVAW/WSO.
He was one of the 7 Leavenworth Bro-
thers recently indicted on major char-
ges resulting from the July, 1973 upris-
ing at the Federal Prison in Kansas.

But most importantly, William was a

brother, deeply committed to struggle
and fighting for the freedom of prison-
ers and oppressed people everywhere.

William's body was discovered on
May 9th, hanging from his
shirt in his cell at the Wyandotte County
Jail in Kansas. The death looked like a
suicide. But the word "murder" is far
more applicable. William was trans-
ferred to the County Jail approximately
3 months ago from the Federal Prison
in Marion, Ill. (where William has been
held since the Leavenworth rebellion).
Upon his transfer, William informed us,
"I am afraid for my life. They tried to
kill me once before when I was at this
jail. I just‘ want you to know that if my
body is ever discovered dead, it will not
be me who has taken my life; it will be
" This was
the last direct message we ever receiv-
ed from William.

The_Leavenworth Brothers watch
out for one another inside the prison;
William was kept separated from the ot-
her Brothers while~awaiting their trial .
and court hearings. Also, shortly be-
fore his death, William was mysterious-
ly sent to the Springfield, Mo. Medical
Facility for federal prisoners, and then
transferred directlyjback to Kansas.
What went on in that Medical Facility is
unknown.

It is unlikely that William took his
own life. He was a" strong, committed
brother, deeply involved in the people's
struggle. If the allegation of suicide is
false, then the prison system of this
countrymust be condemned for his mur-
der. If his death was a result of his own
doing, then the prison system must be
made to account for its irresponsibility,
its negligence, and its inhuman and bru-
tal treatment of prisoners everywhere.
The death of William Hurst is not uni-
que; similar events occur every week in
prisons across the country. Countless
prisoners have been murdered by pri-
son officials; while countless others are
forced to the point of breaking by the
daily oppression’of prison life.

An investigation into William's
death is being conducted, but regardless
of what this investigation reveals, it is '
not William who is responsible. He was
a victim of the prison system which is
used as a tool of repression, and it is

- this system which is to blame.

William's death comes as a blow to
us all. His courage and dedication to
struggle will be remembered, and his
spirit will live on in the years to come.

ODELL BENNET

The Leavenworth_ Brothers won a
partial -victory in court on May 9th, with
the conclusion of one of the brother's
trials. Odell Bennett was tried on char-
ges of assault stemming from an inci-
dent which . occurred on Aug. 22, 1973.
These charges were not directly related
to the major indictments handed down on
the Brothers as a result of the uprising
which occurred in the Federal Peniten-
tiary in Kansas on July 31st.

Five different charges had been fil-
ed against Odell as a result of the Aug-
ust incident. One of the charges, mut-

‘iny, was dropped before Bennett went to
trial because the government realized
they had no case. He wasalso charged
with four separate counts of assault. He
was found innocent of one of the counts,
andtwo of the counts resulted in a mis-
trial because of a hung jury. Bennett
was convicted of one count of "forcibly
resisting, opposing, impeding, intimi-
dating and interfering with a‘ federal of-
ficer in the line of duty. "

The August incident for which Ben-
nett was tried involved his appearance
in the Leavenworth Federal Court. He
had 6 civil suits pending against Leaven-
worth Warden Daggett, but before being
taken to court, Odell was forced to sub-
mit to a "finger wave" or rectal search.
On the 22nd, 7 or 8 guards came to Ben-
nett's‘cell, at which time Odell said he
would rather drop his charges against
the -Warden than undergo the rectal
"rape." At this point, one of the guards
said, "Let's get that nigger," and Odell
was attacked. He was handcuffed and
beaten for 10 minutes in his cell. He

was then taken to the marshall's room
where the rectal search was administer-
ed. At this point, testimony from both }
the prosecution and the defense showed
that Bennett had gone limp and "gave up" 
at this point.» Shortly after the search, 
Bennett collapsed. This was the "for-
cible resi'stance"”‘for which Odell was [
convicted. I

Two counts of assault ended with a
hung jury. The government charged
that after Odell was shackled in hand- I
cuffs, belly chain and leg irons, he at- [
tacked federal marshalls. At least one '1
juror refused to believe that .an assault (I
could have occurred while Bennett was in

this condition. The. only black juror, the

wife of a retired Command Sergeant Ma- (
assault counts. This juror later told the
Leavenworth Brothers Offense/Defense ' 
Committee that, "Most of us agreed that I
the government witnesses were lying." 

During Bennett's testimonyhe stat- 
ed, "Prisons are closed societies. The I
guards are lying here because they do 
not want the public to know what goes on I
inside there. My real crime ismy re- 
sistance to the inhuman conditions, my 
filing of lawsuits against the warden,
and my membership in Vietnam Veter - 
ans Against the War/Winter Soldier Or- I
ganization. " -‘ 

To coincide with Odell's trial, the 
LBODC staged a 21-mile march from
Lecompton to Topeka, Kansas. Lecom- 
pton was the capital of the Kansas slave  (1
state, and the march proved to drama-

tize Bennett's words, "Slavery has been  '

abolished except for punishment for a
crime. " A rally followed the march at 
the State Capitol in Topeka; then a sil- I
ent march to the courthouse was conduc-’ 
ted with the demonstrators wearing gags 
to emphasize how our courts aid in the [1
silencing of resistance. » [

Though Odell was convicted of one ’ 
of the charges against him, it is a vic- ’
tory that he was freed from the other [
counts. It proved to the government and I
the courts that the framing of the Leav- 
enworth Brothers will not be as easy as 
they had hoped. It proved that there
are people who are not willing to believe {
the government charges against these '
men. Money and publicity are needed if ]
the frame—up of these Brothers is to_ be
stopped as the major trials approach. (
The major indictments include charges l
of murder, kidnapping and assault, and l
Odell will be one of the brothers who [
will again have to face_our country's sys-
tem of "justice." For more information.

is KOREA: UNREST

Suppression of resistance in South
Korea is growing as President Pak
Jung Hi implements the "emergency
measures" he declared in April. Stu-
dents are the special targets of these
latest attacks.

Opposition to or slander of the Pak
government is now punishable by death
or life imprisonment; a five-year min-
imum sentence is mandatory.

The wider focus of the Pak regime
repression seems to be against a grow-
ing alliance between the student move-
ment and South Korean workers. The
government enforces strict anti-union,
anti-strike laws, and wages in many
factories are at starvation levels: wo-
men workers at one Seoul factory, for
instance, are paid $1. 50 per day, and
a 10¢ per hour wage is‘ common. One
woman factory worker, who joined in
the student protests, said: "It was while

.I was working in the factory last sum-

mer that I realized what injustice meant
and came to see that I am involved,
whatever I do. The conditions in this
factory are miserable. " -

Student demands include an end to
censorship, freedom of opposing politi-
cal candidates, limitation on Japanese
domination of the Korean economy, and
curtailment of the South Korean CIA,

II‘ the secret police force which has infil-

trated almost every area of South Kor-
ean life. Because of a history of Japan-
ese imperialism in Korea, the growing
Japanese inﬂuence is even more hated
than American influence. I

»As in the cases of the puppet govern-
ments in Cambodia and South Vietnam,
the Pak government is kept in power
largely through American aid. 42, 000,
American troops still occupy South Kor-
ea, even though. the .Kore§;5g§§I
been over for more than 20 year—s-.- and "
even though the military forces of the
Peoples Republic of- China--which
fought at the side of the North Koreans
during the war--withdrew from Korea
in 1958. And the U. S. ' continues to
pour in money to prop up the Pak re-
gime; the U. S. government is pre-
sently in theJthird year of a five-year
$1. 5 billion military modernization
plan. '

Despite U. S. and Japanese financial
support, the economy of South Korea
continues to crumble; massive injec-
tions of American surplus food now '
keep the people of the country alive
while driving the rural population into
the cities to work for starvation wages.‘
Only large amounts of aid which went
to the South Korean military to finance
their troops in Vietnam give the cities
of the country a superficial appearance
of prosperity. And, of course, U. S.
business inter ests make ample use of
the opportunity to exploit the low-paid
Korean workers. I

    

‘ the manuevers of the Pak regime and

GROWS

 

NewYk Koren Support Demo

Many student demands cannot be
openly advocated. To favor establish-
ment of relations between the North
and the South is punishable by death.
Using the words "Yankee, Go Home"
can be punished by a year in prison.
Typically, the Pak regime labels all
opposition as communist, inspired by
North Korea, and as such a threat to
"national security. "

Meanwhile, the Democratic Peoples
Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to
stress the five-point peace plan for the
reunification of the ‘country, and rejects

the U. S. government to make the divi-
sion of the country permanent. As the

DPRK points out, reunification of a
country--which has always been a single

country--is the only way to ease tension
and make peace possible. And the first
step toward eventual reunification is the
withdrawal of foreign troops and other
foreign military aid.

In, response to the arrests of the stu-
dents and the accusations of "communist
influence", in the student movement, the
government of the DPRK put out a docu-
ment listing more than 4000 cases of es-
pionage, provocation and aggression
commited by the U. S. and Pak govern-
ments during the first three months of
1974. The paper particularly noted
U.S. arms build-up, introduction of nu-
clear weapons, expansion of bases, and
increased manuever activity in South
Korea. I I

Studentldemonstrations -already have J
toppled one U. .S.- sponsored government I
in South Korea, the corrupt regime of
Syngman Rhee in 1960. ‘Pak, and his
U. S. backers have reason to fear more
student militance, particularly when al-
lied with the country’ s workers. Des-
pite increasingly harsh repression, the
people of South Korea are determined to
pursue their path toward freedom and
independence, toward liberation from
U. S. military andeeconomic domina-
tion, and toward the eventual reunifica-
tion of their country. ‘

’I'he Tonkin Gulf, August 4, 1964.

That is when our most recent involve-
ment in Indochina ‘legally’ began. Since
then, 6. 7 million men and women have
spent time in the military during what is
known at the Vietnam Era; nearly 3 rnil-
lion of those in Indochina. And now that
these men and women are back in civil-
ian life, they are finding that the govern-
ment does not have much more regard
for them than it had for the people of In-
dochina. Inadequate education opportun-
ities and medical benefits, bad dischar-
ges and no jobs are problems that face
millions of Vietnam-era veterans today.

EDUCATION - The Veterans Administra-
tion(VA) gave single veterans of World
War II $75 a month in living allowances
3% paid up to $500 in tuition and fees
directly to the school or college. That
covered all the costs at 89% of the pri-
vate schools in the country at that time.
Today's veteran receives a lump sum of
$220 a month with which to cover living

expenses and tuition for nine months.

Tuition at Harvard in 1948, for
example, was $525 for an academic
year, just $25 over the GI Bill allowan-
ces. Today, the tuition at Harvard is‘
$3, 200, which is $1, 220 over the current
GI Bill allowances, not to mention the
increased living expenses. There is
even a problem at public colleges, where
the average total cost is $1, 765. This

_I§_/IEDICAL CARE - The VA runs the lar-
gest health care program in the country,
with 170 hospitals and a medical budget
of more than $3 billion a year. While the
VA does have a few model hospitals,
they are generally understaffed and in-
different to the special needs of Vietnam-
era veterans. A recent Ralph Nader re-
port concluded that the VA was "utterly
incapable" of delivering services to the
Vietnam-era. veteran because the VA is
geared primarily to provide custodial
care of chronically ill old men. (The
Nader Report is available in the form of
a book, The Discarded Army, Veterans
After Vietnam, from: Charterhouse
Books, 145 East 49th St. , New York,

NY 10017; $3. 95 paperback.)

The VA doesn't know how to res-
pond to the problems of Vietnam-era
vets, such as drug addiction or psycho-
logical problems, nor do they care.
Psychological problems resulting from
being in Vietnam (known at PVS) are not
considered by the VA to be "service-
connected disabilities" and therefore do
not qualify the veteran for treatment.
The care of veterans with drug problems
is equally atrocious. The common treat-
ment involves moving the vet from one
drug to another. Many vets reject the
cold and ineffective treatment of the VA,
as indicated by the findings of the Nader
group: "High dropout rates plague VA

n no trial or hearing.

programs, though many clinics obscure"
the problem by retaining patients on their
roles long after they have ceased makirg
visits. On the average, VA drug pro-
grams seem to list about twice as many
patients as they really have" (The Dis-
carded Army). Vets with drug-related
bad discharges, who would have the
greatest need for treatment, are not
even eligible, since they have a bad dis-
charge.

NO JOBS - Vietnam veterans, especial-
ly non-white veterans, have a much high-
er unemployrnent rate than the general
labor force. Very few vets returned
with a "marketable skill"; even those
that did, or were able to acquire a skill
later, are" still faced with the same
meager employment situation that other
workers are faced with. For those with
a bad discharge or an unfavorable SPN
number, the struggle is even greater.

BAD DISCHARGES - The military uses
five classifications of discharge:
able, General, Undersirable, Bad Con-
duct and Dishonorable. The first three
are all given administratively; there is
The last two re-
quire a court martial(trial). The use of
this multiple discharge system has com-
pounded all of the other problems facing
veterans, especially since the VA can
use its own discretion in granting bene-
fits. In most cases the VA will rule a- '
gainst granting benefits. There are no
clear statutory guidelines, no definitions
and no opportunity to appeal the VA rul-
ing to the courts, thereby leaving the
veteran at the mercy of the VA.

A bad discharge is a brand for life
which only a small percentage of vets
will ever be able to change on their own.
The only solution is to eliminate the old
multiple discharge system and establish
a single-type discharge for all vets.

This disgraceful and discrimina-
tory treatment of veterans is why we
are going to Washington this summer.
We hope you will join us in the fight for
a single-type discharge and decent bene-
fits for all vets.

SPN DISCHARGE CODES

The Defense Department announced on April 27th that veterans may ob-
tain new discharge papers on request that will omit the controversial Separa-
tion Program Numbers(SPN) which indicate the reason for discharge. These
numbers and classifications are given arbitrarily without the knowledge of the
veteran and with no process of appealing the classification.
