HOW we LOOK TO A EOREIGN LIEBARIAN

European libraries are, on the wholet
more democratic. we would never think of
delegating‘ to the chief librarian the
authority he has in.America, where, his.
authority frequently reminds us of that
of the administrative head of a corpora-
tion,... The idea of the chief librarian
as a "boss" is carried over to the saL~
ary chart. A drop of 40 to 50 per cent
between the salary of the chief and the
next highest is not unusual....

Routine work has weakened the feeling
of joint responsibility in the operation
of the library as a whole. Staff meet~

ings continue to be held but it is large» gs

ly the leaders that run them ~ there is
little cooperation, unless we take it in
the way a bold assistant once ‘ answered
his superior "Cooperation? yes ea we coo
and.you operate." — Wilhelm Munthe, in
his gmerican Librarianship from a__Euro~
pean Angle, the report of a survey made
by him for the Carnegie Corporation.

310 UNION AT N}Y..PUBLIC LIBRARY

After ,trying for many years to effect
real improvement in their working condi-
tions through a staff association.which,
while -energetic and determined, lacked
power because it did not have the backs
ing of the labor movement, the
workers in the New York Public Li~
brary organized last month a regular lar
bor union, affiliated with the GIG and
to be known as Local 251 of the State,
County and Municipal Workers of America,

The new union has been recognized by-

H.M.Lydenberg, the director, and import—
ant negotiations are said to be already
under way.

A letter to_Local 28, UFWA, announcing_

the formation of the new union, added
"we pledge you our support in helping to
advance the interests of library employe
ees
country." I , .

The progress of this,the first genuine
labor union eto be organized in the sec~
ond largest library in the U,S.A., will
be watched with interest. The fine rec~
ord which its founders earned by their
years of public~spirited activity in the
old staff association makes it certain
that they will forge ahead,now that they
have organic connection with the restof
unionized labor.

The organization of library unions
with labor affiliation needs to be seen
to some extent as part _of this general
reaction of librarians and other profes~

. sional workers to certain aspects of the

depression. Many librarians formed staff
associations to _ function in part as
their collective machinery, and others,
believing the isolated staff association
to be relatively ineffective, formed
bona fide unions and sought labor affil—
iation to strengthen their position.
B. Berelson, Library Quartergz, October
1939, p. 497.

A library is ga“symboleof democracy,
the _free inquiry of a free mind.

cultural inheritance -of the nation, to.

,Relations between the CIO union at the
Chicago Public Library and the library
administration, Bernard Bereison reports
in The ibr- ‘ rterl for Oct. 1939
"have_ recently_ beene improved with the
attendance of union delegates at meet»
ings tor the board (of directors)... The
union claims to have influenced the res—
toration of automatic increases stopped
in 1931, the posting of civil service
lists and ‘resumption of appointments
from longpstanding lists, the granting

‘of half day err for the building force,

adjustments in pay rates for holiday and
overtime _work,.. As a result of union
activity, ten aldermanic candidates in
the spring elections included improve~
ment of library ‘service-in their cam»

ALA comuxrmsr ENDORSES LIBRARY UNIONS

There is strong evidence that library
unions in certain individual cases have
already contributed to the improvement
of library service... In the future, as
the’social order changes, unions may be
not only, a desirable but a necessary
means for extension and improvement of
library service.
ommends that librarians keep an open
mind on the question of unionization,
encourage the activities of unions in so

.far as such activities are a benefit to
'.., library service and recognize that
in the future unions may be a distinct

aid.~—Final report of the Third.Activi-
ties Committee of the ALA.

In ‘a survey of library "staff bulle-
tins" made at the request of the Staff

Korman lists among the few publications

four bulletins published by the library
unions in Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee

WBITES BOOK ON LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION.

Herbert, Clara W. Eersonnelpgdministraé
Chicagp, Ame
erican Library Association, l939.‘$2.50£

‘Miss Herbert's new .book is the first

V a practical application to .libraries of

personnel methods worked out by.eminent.
students of governmental administrationg‘
it? is also a sumary of the experience.
of the .author .as personnel officer~of§
the Washington, D. G., Public Library.
The lfirst part of the book is devoted;
to a general discussion of organization.
executive leadership and democracy with-
in libraries. Miss Herbert_believes
that each membr of .a- library staff
should participate in the functions and
management of the jlibrary.. Among the
specifications for an enlightened perh
sqnnel policy are the following: define
its ‘grades and- classifications: great
care in selecting new staff members and,
in addition; a follow~up system: in~
service training: a regular system of
promotions, and attention to good physi~
cal working conditions. Miss Herbert
looks V
such as credit unions, hospitalization
plans and pensions,..and thinks that
staff associations can accomplish a good
deal toward. putting them into effect.
.The reviewer is of the,opinion that, in
both the American and British library
mqyements, the preponderant e§idence of
successful_ welfare ‘activities — occurs
when groups of» library employees have
had leadership more vigorous, and direc-
ttives more clearly_ defined, than they
are by staff.associations.g 0 ’
Part Three contains ‘two excellent
chapters on civil service within librare
ies and certification of trained librar~
ians. * Because the. book is brief an<i
factual, sit should be required reading

_for every librarian.; ~
