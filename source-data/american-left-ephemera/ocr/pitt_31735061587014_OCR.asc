THE BED UNDER THE OVEN

By El Gilbert
Nashville

She was always talking about plastic,
how it got in her head or passed through her
body, causing unusual swelling and sinus
attacks.

Crazy, they said. Paranoid. Loony.
Ought to be lockedup for life... for her own
good, of course. A woman like that is liable to
do anything, you know. ~

She was working as a cleaning lady in a
pizza parlor for $3 a night. Slept on the floor
under the oven after everyone had gone.

Huh... what could she clean, they said.
She’s dirty herself. Nasty hair. Ought to
throw her in a tub of lysol... for her own good,
of course. A woman like that is liable to have
anything, you know.

I was working as a cook in the same
pizza parlor when she was there. Twenty
dollars a night, thirteen and a half hours a
night. Sweat sliding down my back and off of
my eyelashes. Just missing the cheese.

_ Most of the time I cooked over $1,000
worth of pizzas a night, which is a lot of
movement and after thirteen and a half hours

" of it, the only thing I felt like doing was

crawling in a hole and covering it.

One night in particular it was so bad I
was too tired to walk. Shortly after closing I
collapsed at a table in the dining room and, as
usual, nobody paid any attention.

The next thing I knew there was a hand
on my shoulder and someone calling from what
seemed to be far away. Where was I? At home
in bed? Where? My neck felt detached as I
struggled to lift my head. My eyes watered in
the harsh light as I struggled to see. Then I
saw her. It was her, the crazy one.

"You can sleep here," she said. ''I have
a bed under the oven for you." ‘

"Okay," I said,_,too weak to protest, too
exhausted to even think about calling a cab.

She led me to the spot under the oven.
For a brief moment I thought of what they
said about her, the possibility of her having
something. Something. Lice, bugs or ticks, if
nothing else. But I quickly dismissed it from
mind as fatigue overcame my abused body.
Who cared, I though, easing between the warm
heavy quilts on the floor.

Four hours later I woke up reasonably
refreshed. It was quiet... deadly quiet. I
looked around for her, the crazy one, but she
was nowhere in sight. Strange. Then it hit
me. If she let me sleep under the oven, where
did she sleep?

She had to be somewhere, I thought,
walking to the washroom, wondering if this
was really happening or if it was some kind of
weird dream. A dream, that's what it was... a
weird dream. Sooner or later I would wake
up, I told myself. But as I reached for the
handle of the washroom, I saw her, the crazy
one, her thin frame curled inside a flimsy
blanket against the back door. No, it wasn’t a
dream. It was really happening. The crazy
one had given me her only bed, the place of
honor under, the oven, the place reserved for
"house" guests, the place where no plastic could
get in and I was safe from invading aliens.

Crazy? Maybe. But if that was crazy,
the whole world should be crazy. The whole
world should have room in the inn.

DEDICATION AND FAILURE

By Barb Jeffrey

July 6-26 "Temperatures reach record
highs in seven southern states during a year of
record drought."-- Life Magazine, January
1987.

It wasn’t just in Life magazine, but
everywhere. On the evening news, 60 Minutes,
the morning paper... The south was burning in
the midst of one of the hottest recorded
summers ever. People were broiling in a
situation they could not remedy. Nature
could be cruel and could not be altered. Very
uncomfortable and very hot.

I live in the north. I never felt the hot
breath of that summer directly. That I am
grateful for. But one thing I did feel that
made me feel awful, and that was the
suffering of a certain group of people, the
southern farmers. I work on a farm in the
summer, and I think it is accurate to say that
farming is one of the hardest existing ,
occupations. Farmers make approximately
$1.10 an hour. Add to that disadvantage the
increasing number of farm foreclosures. And
then the heat. The neverending summer...

The summer of ’86 was starting off
badly for me, too. My parents were starting to
get on my case about finding a "real job."

Farm work wasn’t "real work" since I didn't get
paid much, and what I did make, I used to pay
the board on my two horses. So there wasn’t
much profit showing, and Mom and Dad just
couldn’t comprehend it.

One day (one of my few days off) I was
feeling pretty worthless after one of their
parental lectures. I was flipping across the
T.V. airwaves when I came to a show about,
you guessed it, oppressed southern farmers.
The television showed a scene of an old man
leaning over a dying cow. In the background
was a barren field. You can’t expect livestock
to survive without food. That was the
situation, and everytime I saw it or heard it,
my heart broke in two. Everyone’s heart
broke in two. Looking at the old man and his
dying cow made me feel the hopelessness of
the farming situation. I was sick of feeling
useless, and so were the farmers, I imagined.

Munhall, PA

That is when I got my idea.

Every year in Pennsylvania thousands
of hay fields go uncut for one reason or
another: lack of motivation, no equipment, no
help, no lease... the list goes on and on. But
the fact still remained. All of these bales of
hay the southern farmers could’ve used, laying
to waste. You understand my idea now, don't
you. I know of at least forty fields that were
left uncut. So I traced down the sixteen
different owners and got permission to cut the
fields.

Next, I needed equipment and help.

For the equipment, I asked the man who
boarded my horses, Perry Sellman. Luck was
on my side because he was a retired farmer
and sympathized with the plight of thel
southern farmers. Perry also convinced six
neighbors to help us out the hay. It wasn’t
easy since there would be no pay. But they
agreed, and we finally acquired eight pairs of
working hands, a tractor, a hay raker, and a
baler. The only worthwhile ideal had was
actually taking shape.

The transportation of the hay was not
as easy to set up. Nobody wanted‘ to ship it for
free, and we didn't have the money. to pay the
fee. Then the trucking company down the
road, Rathway Trucking Inc., heard of our

search for free transportation an_d got in touch ,

with Perry. They said that if we had the.hay
baled and ready to ship by August 4th, they

could do the job for no charge. But August
4th was the final day, due to previous
contracts and commitments.

It was agreed forty-six fields of'hay
would be cut and baled by August 4th. We had
ten working days to cut areas between Belle
Vernon, Connelsville, and Perryopolis.

Dedication. That is all I saw for a week

' . straight. We would begin work at 6:00 A.M.

and quit at 8:30 P.M. with an hour for lunch.
We got no more volunteers, but we didn’t lose
any.

The weather was hot and the work was
hard. I've been baling hay since I was nine
years old,,and I'd rather scrub toilets all day.
Baling hay gave us back aches, sore feet, ‘
sunburn, sore muscles and callouses the size of
silver dollars on our hands. But we were
doing it for a good cause, and southern »
farmers couldreally use the hay. Even if it
was just a drop in the bucket, it was
something.

By the eighth day we had finished
forty fields, and it looked like we had the
deadline made. Even though the weather was ‘
hot, no rain came and I thanked Mother
Nature for that. Three thousand, eight
hundred and-fifty-five bales were counted.
Something to be proud of, huh? It looked like
everything was going to work out.

The disaster came on the ninth day. _
Our faithful tractor, which cut the hay, broke
its front axle, and all operations halted. It
was immediately welded, but it didn’t hold. %
The earliest time a- mechanic could repair it page 11

g Graphic by Reiko Yano

was in two days. Nobody could lend us
another tractor, for each farmer was working
his own. field.

Then the rain came. We were »
preoccupied with the broken tractor. The rain
drenched the baled hay before wecould collect
and cover it. Three thou-sand plus bales of
‘hay had to be sun dried "before they could be
transported south.

August.4th came and went. Rathway’s
trucks came and went. The bales stayed where
they were. I never felt so much like killing
myself in my whole life.

Failure. It’s a strange concept. You
cannot fail unless you try. It’s good to try and

worse not to. But failure still stinks even if [-

you did try. . . ‘

I received many condolences after the _
4th. Perry told me that it was a great idea and
that it almost worked. The workers told ‘me
that I had a big heart and that I was a kind
person.

Six days later thehay was dried and
collected. In the middle of haying season, I
could only get twenty-five cents a bale instead
of one dollar. I sold all the hay and sent the
money to a fund for poverty stricken farmers. .
It's still, no doubt, wrapped up in red tape
somewhere. I - I

Myparents got on my case. They said I
was naive for working so hard and getting
nothing in return. Not even-self-satisfaction.

But that’s okay. I’m smart enough to see how
naive they are.

 

 

A JOB WELL sum=.o For:

By Bill Pyda
Imperial, PA

We were in a big hurry to beat the

rain. We’d already taken in three loads of
hay, and hopefully this would be our last. Mr.
Williams climbed up onto the back of his stake
truck, took a quick count of the bales that
were still out in the field, and said there were

too many for one load.

"I wasn’t thinking right," he said. "If
we’d have put an extra six on each of the other
loads, we’d be in good shape. I hate to come
back out for just twenty bales. And besides,
it’ll probably be rainin’ by then."

' "Can we fit ’em on this load?" I
asked.

"That’s what ‘I'm wonderin’. Might as
well try. We'll tie ’em down good and tight
with this rope I have behind the seat."

He got into the cab, started up the
truck and drove it across the field. I rode on
the back, but whenwe got near to where the
bales were scattered, I jumped off, ran out in
front of the truck, and started kicking and
pushing the bales into one long straight row.
Mr. Williams didn't even stop to get out and
help. He could see that I wasn’t having any
trouble. The truck moved slowly along, and I
worked extremely fast. I’d have another bale
in my hands before the one I’d just bucked
finished bouncing.

When all the bales were loaded I gotup
onto the back of the truck and started
building. This was the less strenuous part of
the job, but it took some know-how to get it
right. The bales had to be tiedtogether as
they were stacked, or we’d lose the whole load
on our way to the barn. I knew,’because my
building had caused us to lose nine loads
already this summer.

Mr. Williams never got angry when we
dumped a load. Most. of the time he laughed
about it. , "You’ll learn," he told me, "and even
then you'll still lose a few. I do, and I've been

stacking hay for years. Page 12

 

We’d be picking up the spilled bales,
and I’d be wonder’ “ where I went wrong.

Maybe if I’crisscros~ d the top row,'or if I put

a ‘few in lengthwise. I was always trying
something different, and I must have made

— some improvements, because we started

dumping loads less frequently.

The extra twenty bales made this load’
top-heavy. We wrapped the rope around it,
tied the rope firm, and headed for the barn. It
started thundering when we were halfway
there. Mr. Williams gave his old truck some

V gas, shifted into third gear, and picked up

quite a bit of speed. The whole truck started
swaying, but he didn’t let that slow us down.

He glanced over at me and said, "Can’t
let my hay get rained on. Costs me too much
money."

I agreed. A week earlier some bales
had gotten wet while they were still out in the
field. Mr. Williams said that wet hay wasn’t
good for anything, and we threw thebales over
the hill. 9 - -

This time we made it into the barn
before the rain started. I was tired out from
the six hours of work I’d already put in, and
I’m sure Mr. Williams was, too. But neither of
us let it show. We worked like hell, so we
could get out of that stuffy barn, There was
hardly any ventilation inside the place, and~as
soon as we started moving bales the air became
thick with hay dust. I’d grunt every time I
picked up a bale, then I’d think of the cold
beer we’d soon be drinking, and 13d get my
second wind. That beer was sure: going to

, make my dry scratchy throat feel better.

We unloaded the truck in record time.
Mr. Williams brushed off his shirt, coughed up
some hay dust, and told me to go for the beer.
The rain had just started, and I had to run

through it to get to the springhouse. I grabbed 

two cold cans out of the water trough, ran

back through the rain, and joined Mr. Williams 
insidethe lean-to that was attached to the side 

of his barn. He kept his tractor and a couple
old car seats inside here. It made a great
drinking spot. It was shady and "dry, and
unlike the inside of the barn, the air was
always clear. I handed Mr. Williams a beer,

 

and

and he handed me sixteen dollars.

"This is-more than you owe me,” I said.
"We only worked about six hours."

"Yeah, but we did eight hours work.
You keep that extra money."

I thanked him, and put the money in .
my pocket- I felt like I’d worked a good eight
Damn, was I ever tired.

We sat inside the lean-to, drinking beer
and talking, for well over an hour. When he
finished off a round I’d go running through,
the rain and get two more. We could have
stockpiled some cans, but then they would
have started getting warm on us. We both
liked our beer ice-cold. Every so often I’d .
notice Mr. Williams looking outside, and
smiling. We’d beat the rain, and that made»
him happy.

I was pretty drunk when I got on my
bike and started peddling home. I was also
tired and soaking wet. But I didn't mind a
bit. Ihad sixteen dollars in my pocket, and ‘
this made me feel like a hardworking, full
grown man. Of course I was only fourteen,
and I had a mother and father to answer to
when I got home. They'd know I was drunk.
My mom would startcrying and my dad would
get mad and threaten to make me quit my job.
I couldn’t understand either of them. I guess
they weren't my kind of people. I wished they
were like Mr. Williams. As long as I helped him
get his hay in, and I did it without getting
hurt, he was pleased. He’d give me all the beer
I wanted. '

Mr. Williams hadtold me that it would
be three days beforehe needed my help again.
Even longer if it rained. This left me some
time to hang out over by the grocery store. I’d
become a big shot this summer, because of all

 

 

 

‘ the boys who hung out over there, I was the I

only one with a job. And I sure talked my job
up big. I talked like a real career man. I said
that without my help, Mr. Williams couldn’t
possibly get his hay in. One of the boys even »
asked if I’d be quitting school in the fall,
because of my work.

"All depends," I told him. "Things’ll
probably be slackin’ off by then."

I never told the boys how reluctant Mr.
Williams had been to hire me. I kept this fact
all to myself.

I went down to the Williams farm
looking for work on the first day of our
summer vacation. I found Mr. Williams inside
his lean-to, changing a tractor tire. As soon as
he noticed me he stood up and walked over and
we shook hands. ‘

"What. can I do for you?" he asked.

"I’m lookin’ for a job. ‘Need any
help?"

"Oh, let me think here for a minute."
He looked me over, and when he stated talking
again, the words came out much slower. I
"Yeah, I do need somebody to help me bring
my hay in. But you see, you’re pretty small.
Them bales weigh close to sixty pounds."

"Don’t you think I can handle it?"

"To be truthful, no. I’m afraid you
might hurt yourself ." l

I knew he expected me to start pleading
with him, but I didn’t do that. I said that if he
didn’t think I could do the work, that I
wouldn’t bother him any more, and that I’d be
on my way. '

"Now just hold on a minute," he said.
"You didn’t even tell me your name."

"It’s Pierson. Rob Pierson."

y "Pierson? I don't think I ever heard that
name before. You live around here?"

"Over in town."

He nodded his head. "Well I’m Jake
Williams, and I’m pleased to meet you, Rob."

 

"Same here. I. already knew your
name. I ride my bike past this place all the ‘

time."
-1. that right?" He smiled, which let
me know that I was saying the right things.

"But now let’s get back to this business of me
giving you a job."

"I could sure use one."

"Uh-huh. You know, I think I might
have done a bad job sizing you up. I’ll bet
you’re prettyidamn strong, even if you are ~
little." I

"I am strong."

"And you are the first kid who's come
around this summer. Yeah, I think I’ll give
you a try."

"All right!"

"But if the work's too much for you, I'll.
have to let you go."

"I understand."

"Good. So let’s see here, as soon as I get
this tire changed, I'll be going out to rake. I'll
let the hay sit in windrows overnight, and bale
tomorrow. I won’t be needin’ your help until
the day after tomorrow. Come down around
noon"

‘'1 can show up a lot earlier than that."
Mr. Williams laughed, and told me to
stop acting like a greenhorn. "You have to let
the morning dew dry off the bales."
"I didn’t know that."

"Oh it’s true. Dew’s not so bad, because

it evaporates. Rain’s a different story. If the I
hay’s baled, and the bales get rained on, forget f

it. They’re ruined."

"I’ll be hoping it doesn’t rain."

"Same here. Now listen, when you
come to work, be sure to wear a long sleeved

shirt. If you don't your arms’ll really get
scratched up."

"Okay, I won’t forget."

,"I’ll eat a couple big meals too."

I "Sounds good, Mr. Williams. And thanks

"You’re welcome."

We only had two loads to bring in that
first day. I tried my best, but I still made a
couple mistakes. The first was just plain '
stupidity, and I'm lucky I didn’t get hurt.

It happened while we were out in the a
field, getting our first load. I stepped off the

Page 15

EARLY ABANDONMENT

The men in overalls went quiet tolet me through
as I unsettled the dust on the canned beans

‘and boxes of soap. Down that endless wood floor
my father waited, arms open. I moved dreamlike
unable to get there soon enough.

I had been shut for too longin the car.
The metal dash rounded as a mother's belly
offered no comfort. My cries came back hollow.

 In febrile air I rose to that place beyond sobs.

When the wall of a delivery truck bore down,
I called for my father, called into gray silence.
Then I saw nothing but the red fear inside

my shut lids. He found me in utter anguish;

Not my father, but the man of bone-meal smell,
the man who lifted feed sacks and twine.

With his dust-coated voice, he didn?t seem

like a savior, yet he offered lifeb-uoy arms.

Inside the country store my father's voice

was a reassuring murmur like the overhead fan.
As the loafers chuckled, he told the story

over and over of how the truck did not hit me
and how all the time he was inside the door
orderinghis seedcorn.

truck, and landed and in a cluster of raspberry
bushes. I got some scratches on my face, but?
other than that I was all right. "I brushed
myself off and tried to act like nothing had
even happened. But Mr. Williams didn’t act
this way at all. He came running over and
started asking me if I was hurt.

"I’m okay," I kept saying. "Just some
scratches." ' .

He shook his head and told me to be
more careful.

We finished with the load and made it
into the barn without any more trouble.

_ We were doing good with the second
load, until we lost it on our way back in. I
looked at that heap of dumped bales, and felt

terrible. I walked over and kicked a few of ~ »

them.

"Take it easy," said Mr. Williams. "It’s
part of the job."

"Well this timelwhy don’t you build." s

I grabbed .a bale before he had time to
answer. I knew he’d been keeping me up on r
the truck because he didn’t think I was strong»
enoughto lift the bales up off the ground.  I 
wanted to prove him wrong. It was hard for ‘
me, but I got the bales up‘ there. I’d pick them
up waist high, and then I'd lift my right knee
and use it to. give them an extra-push.

Mr. Williams did the building. He ?
didn’t say a word, but I did notice him
checking me out. I could tell he was pleased,
because I saw him smiling.

We got the truck reloaded and into the
barn without losing another bale. Twenty
minutes later the truck was empty, the hay was
stacked inside the barn, and we were done for
the day. I -

Mr. Williams pulled out his
handkerchief and wiped off his sweaty face.
"Two loads and I’m all tired out," he said.

"You want the water jug? It’s inside i
the truck."

"Hell no. I want a cold beer.’ How
about goin’ over to the springhouse and
grabbin’ a couple."

I went over andbrought back two
cans. Mr-. Williams nodded his head when he

. saw me opening one for myself. V

s "That’ll really hit the spot," he said.
Then he took a good longdrink from his own
can. ‘

We went and sat inside the lean-to. Mr."

Williams reached for his wallet, counted out

six one dollar bills, and handed them to me.

"Three hours work, at two dollars an
hour," hesaid. "I hope it’s enough."-

"Yeah, it’s enough. And thanks."

"Hey, you worked for it. You worked
damn hard." He stopped talking, and
. grinned. "Since you’re such a "go-getter, how _
about going for some more beer."

I started helping Mr. Williams bring in
hay three or four times ‘a week. I improved
quickly. .1 did more every time I went down
there. Mr. Williams was amazed when he saw
that I could load and build too, all by myself.
He said that he was just an old truck driver,
and that as soon as I learned to drive, I’d

" probably put him completely out of a job.

I I also became a better beer drinker. At
first I could only handle three or four cans;
any more than that and I started to feel sick.
But after a couple weeks practice I'd put away.
five cans with no trouble. Another week and I
was up to a six-pack.

I never saw Mr. William-s look happier
than he did the day webeat that rainstorm.
He said he just couldn’t ‘believe that we were
able to haul in so much hay so quickly. Of
' course he couldn’t have done itwithout my 
help. He knew that, and he showed his
appreciation by giving me sixteen dollars.
This was the most money I’d ever made in one
day. I drank seven beers to celebrate.

I c_arried that sixteen dollars around
with me, and I felt pretty damn cocky when I
showed it to the boys over at the grocery
store. It made them all real jealous. I also
told them about how much beer l’d been
. drinking. l‘ patted my stomach and said that
if I wasn’t such a hard worker, I’d probably
have a beer gut.

Page "16

    

Mr. Williams had told me that if we
‘didn’t get any rain to be down at his place in
three days. The skies remained clear, so on
the afternoon of the third day I went down to
his farm, ready for work.

I saw Mr. Williams out in the clover
field, still baling. I figured that he’d gotten
behind schedule, and that we’d be bringing the
hay in the following day.” It was no big deal,
but I had to wonder why he didn’t call to let
me know. He'd always called if there was a

change in plans.

I walked out to the hay field to.talk g
things over with him. He gave me a big wave
as soon as he noticed me. He shut off the
tractor and got down off of it to stretch his

legs. - —

"Hi, Mr.-Williams. How you doin’?" Page 17

"Good. Real good. Hey, you know I
really appreciate how you helped me out the
other day. Thanks to you, we beat the rain."

"I’m glad we made it. But about today,
what are you figurin’?"

"Well, first I gotta finish balin’. You
can see that."

"Yeah, I can."

"And while I’m finishin’ I want you to
startvhaulin’ somea these bales into the barn."

"Who’s gonna drive?"
"Why you are. Who else?"

"Hey, Mr. Williams, I don't know
about..."

"Don’t worry; You can’t hurt that old
truck. You know how to start it and put it in
gear?"

"Yeah, I can do that much."

"That’s all there is to it. The gears are

“marked right on the shifter. Start out in

second, unless you’re loaded down. Then use
first."

"All right, I’ll give it a try.”

I walked back through‘ the hay field, on
my way to begin my new job as a truck

~ driver. I sure felt uneasy about it. I’d driven

my dad's car a few times, but it was an
automatic. Plus my. dad was right there in the
car with me. Now here's Mr. Williams, sending
me out in his big old stake truck, all by myself,
to haul in a coupleton of hay. And he wasn’t
a bit worried. '

I stalled the truck seven times before I
got it out of the barn and turned around. At
least I’d managed to get it pointedin the right
direction. I started it up again, and after some
gear grinding, followed by a lot of bucking
and jerking, I headed back out to the hay
field. I took it real slow, so that I wouldn’t
have to shift gears again. A

I spent more time moving the truck
than I did working with the hay. I'd get the
bales up onto the back, do the building, and

 

yell for Mr. Williams to pull the truck

forward. Then I'd remember that he was still I

baling.

I got the front wheels stuck in ditch on
my way back to the barn. I was walking
around, looking the situation over and fretting
about what to do, when Mr. Williams. came
pulling up onhis tractor.‘

He took a quick look at the truck and
said we’d get it out with no trouble. "Now it'd
be a different story if the back wheels were
stuck. We’d have to unload most of the hay
before we could budge it."

He told me to get the rope from behind
the seat, and to tie one end of it to the truck's

rear bumper. He tied the other end to the seat,

of the tractor. Then he told me to get inside
the truck and start it up. "When the rope gets
tight, let out the clutch and give her some gas.
Don’t worry if you smell the clutch burnin’.
That won’t hurt a thing."

About a minute later we had the truck
out of the ditch. I could smell the clutch
burning, but by the time I reached the barn the
smell was gone. ’

I was throwing the last couple bales off
the truck when Betty and Linda came peddling
upon their bikes. I knew these girls from
school. They were both a year behind me.
They were always coming around the farm and
bothering us.

They sat on their bikes right outside
the barn door. I could hear them giggling.

"Where’s your boss?" Linda asked.
"He ain’t here. Can’t you see that?"

They started giggling again, then Betty
asked who’d been driving the truck.

"I’ve been drivin’ it. I’ve been drivin’
for a couple weeks now."

They both started calling me Mr. Big I
Time Truck Driver.

"Let’s see your driver’s license," said
Linda.

I started up the truck and backed it out '

of the barn. I got the truck outside and turned
around without stalling it even once.

EDITORIAL

Welcome to issue #19 of the Mill Hunk
Herald Quarterly... Well, we have been
publishing at least twice a year. We depend
solely on those subscription renewals (still only
$5/year) and tax deductible donations for
survival! We are now fundraising for a
banner Labor Day '87 edition that will
concentrate on the future of Unionism and
how working peoples’ lives are faring. Order
your tickets now to the MILL HUNK FUNK
benefit R&R Boogie at the Graffiti on
September 12 - Again only $5 (see ad on back
page)

This issue highlights the
worker-soldier/ Peace conflict at a time when
Reagan and his far right warriors are under
Contra-gate scrutiny all the while plotting
away at new "win-able" interventions. These
pages also contain the usual potpourri of ’
humor, fine poetry and reports from rust belt
movements and workplace tales. The editorial
process was immensely popular this time
around - possibly because we met 9 consecutive
Wednesday evenings at Hemingway's Cafe
(Forbes Avenue in Oakland near Pitt) to read,
rate and rap. We’ll be doing the same every
Wednesday in August beginning Aug. 5th at 7
p.m. Anyone interested may attend - we’ll also
be showing various video clips of our Steel
Valley Stories oral history interviews during
these sessions.

The girls were blocking the doorway,
and they had to move when I came backing
out. They waited for me to get turned around,
then they started saying that I’d tried to run
them over.

"I did not."
"Did too," Betty shouted.

Linda backed her up. "Yes you did.
Take us out to the field with you, or else we’re
tellin’ Mr. Williams."

/

"Go ahead."

I went and got a beer. I brought it
back, leaned against the truck, and drank it.
Just as I expected, the girls started calling me a
drunk driver.

I finished the beer and left for the
field. I knew the girls wouldn't stick around
if I wasn't there. They could sure get on my
nerves. I don’t know which one was worse.

Mr. Williams finished baling in time to
help me get the second load off the truck. We
brought in two more loads after that. I
worked six and a half hours and he paid me
seventeen dollars.

We went inside the lean-to, took our
usual seats, and drank our beer.

Mr. Williams said, "Three more fields
and that’ll be it for the summer."

"I hate to see it end."

"You know, I feel the same way. But
don’t forget, we’ll have a second cut. There
won’t be as many bales, but I'll still need your
help."

"When do you make it?"

"Not until the end of September. You'll
have to take some time off from school."

"I’ll be looking forward to it."

I couldn’t wait. The school bus went
right past this farm. All the boys from up at
the grocery store would see me working when
they rode by. Linda and Betty would be on
that bus, too.

counrnoom SKETCH

By Georgiana Furr
Newark, NJ

A side door opens on the darkened
benches and tables of Part IV: the court for
misdemeanors. Into the courtroom comes a
matron in navy police uniform as well as a
heavy smell of urine from the outside
corridor. The matron turns on the lights and
sets up two microphones on the front tables.
Then she puts another microphone on the
judge's desk and one on a table for the clerk.

Five minutes later a black woman and
child walk in and sit down. The woman opens
a manila folder and begins correcting papers
while the child sucks her thumb. A man
comes in and sits down in the row behind her.
He is black and dressed in jeans.

The last person to enter this early is a
white woman in a double breasted suit,
gray-blue. She wears a soft pink fedora. She
sits down on the same bench as the woman and

_ child. The urine smell accompanies each

person who opens the door.

Then a noise at the back of the
courtroom causes the seated man and the
woman with the hat to turn around. Someone
slams the rear door with her foot: a white
woman, who has come in at the back. She
wears a belted, striped rayon dress that clings
to her rounded stomach and thighs. Carrying
a large recorder unit she talks loudly to herself
as she walks to the front of the room.

"This beats it all, a job where ya gotta
bring yer own furniture to work. Why I put
up with this shit every day I can’t tell you how
tired I get before I even start."

The man and white woman widen their
eyes and laugh silently with each other. The
woman grading papers doesn’t look up. The
clerk continues to complain loudly to, no one as
she sets up her recording machine.

"How do they expect ‘us to set this thing
up when the plugs don’t work?" she mutters,

- for the first time addressing the matron beside

her.

The matron shrugs and walks away. Page 20

Soon the clerk looks up and nods to the
woman in the hat. "Your name?"

"Mrs. Georgiana Furr."

"You're listed," says the clerk and goes
back to her wires.

A black man and woman come in
during that conversation. They go up to the _
clerk. "Excuse me, are we listed...?"

"Sit down and be quiet. I haven't
called the roll yet."

After half an hour there are about
twenty five people seated, and the clerk reads
the roll for the third time. "The cases with
lawyers, which are uncontested, will appear
after the first brief ones that I call. You will
all put away your newspapers and rise while
his honor, Charles Worthington, enters."

The woman correcting papers puts
down her manila folder. The man behind her
unzips his jacket. Everyone stands.

Charles Worthington is balding, with a
puffy, dark face. His robe fluffs behind him
in the urine air.

"The State of New Jersey vs. James
McCullomb."

A man in handcuffs appears, led out of
a room on the right.

The judge takes a paper from the
clerk. He looks down at the prisoner.

"Mr. McCullomb. I understand you
violated probation."

"I’m in jail, your honor. How can I
keep probation appointments when I've been
put in jail?"

"You put yourself in jail. This is not
the fault of the court, is it, that you couldn't
keep yourself outof jail and thereby violated
your probation?" '

"No, your honor."

"We’ll see this case later. Call the
second floor for the other file on him."

The clerk turns over a folder.

"The State of New Jersey vs.
Georgiana Furr."

A policeman who left the room earlier
has come back in now. With him is a shorter
officer of lighter skin color. They sit to the
left of the prosecuting attorney. She smiles at
them. 

The woman in the gray suit and pink
hat rises to stand on the right side, next to her
lawyer.

"Tell what happened to the best of your
recollection," directs the prosecuting attorney
to the taller policeman.

I

"We were traveling south on Broad
Street when we noticed a rally or something _
drawing a crowd on the northwest corner of
Broad and Market. The time was one minute
after eleven. We parked our car on that
corner and approached Mrs. Furr. We
identified ourselves, showing our proper
badges..."

Page 21

       

"Mr. Dobbs, I see you have an
objection?" asks the judge.

The lawyer for Mrs. Furr states, "I
would request that Officer Wharton desist
from reading the arrest statement."

"Objection sustained. We would ask
Officer Wharton to tell us when he must refer
to his records in the future."

’ The officer looks up and continues
talking but keeps one finger on a line on his
paper. "We asked her for her permit, which ,
she denied. We asked her to stop speaking on
the bullhorn, whereupon she used the
opportunity to address the crowd in a loud
voice."

He looked down at his finger. "We
theneinformed Mrs. Furr that unless she
stopped speaking we would place her under
arrest. She did not stop, and we tried to
handcuff her there. She threw herself on the
ground and .‘generally created a dangerous
situation. That's why we charged her with
resisting arrest and disturbing the peace."

"Officer Wharton," began Dobbs. "Had
you, prior to the arrest, read the leaflet
describing the purpose of the rally?~

"No, I had not."

"You were not aware that the rally was
to protest the unprovoked killing by the police
of an unarmed man?"

"No, I wasn’t aware." "

"Did you not refer to this leaflet

several times at the precinct where you took
Mrs. Furr?"

"I don’t know. I don’t know. I did
hear what she was saying, about police
brutality and what not. There she was,
throwing herself around, forcing the
situation..."

"Officer Wharton, how tall are you?"
"Six feet, two inches... about..."

"How much do you weigh?"

"Two hundred twenty... pounds..."

 

 

 

"Objection," says the prosecuting _
attorney. She wasn’t smiling. ,

"I fail to see what this has got to do
with the case," the judge answers.

"I feel it has everything todo with the ’

charges of disorderly conduct," says Dobbs.
"Mrs. Furr is five feet three inches and weighs
one hundred seven pounds‘. It is maintained
she was presenting a physical danger to the
arresting officers, and I must ascertain the
validity of the charge."

"Objection sustained."

Mr. Dobbs shrugs. Then he continues.
"Did Mrs. Furr at any time assault you?"

"No."

"What, then was the physical danger to
yourself?" O

"The crowd. She was exciting the
crowd." —

"Did any of them assault you? Or try.
to?"

"No."

Page 22

"What did they do?"

"They didn’t move when I told them to 

move on. They were coming closer."

"How close would you say they were to

you?‘

"About as faras you are from me." _

"Three or four feet." Dobbs continuesi

slowly, "So anyone three or four feet away
from you, you consider a danger?". -

"They might have prevented me from 
making a lawful arrest." a

"Mrs. Furr, what did you _say or do
when the twoofficers asked you for a
permit?"

''I told them you don't need a permit in;
the city of Newark, unless you’re going to put}
the bullhorn on top of a carand ride around 
the streets." 

"What did they say or do at that time?"

probably wouldn’t have gotten one." i

necessary if _a sound system is to be placed on a

Mrs. Furr?" ,

 

Page 23

. After ten minutes the judge reenters. I
When the five people are assembled in front of
him, the judge turns his face toward Mrs. Furr.

U "1 have decided to drop the charge of
disorderly conduct," he says, and his face
remains in‘ the direction of Mrs. Furr. "But I
find you guilty of the charge of resisting
arrest. The evidence is clear that you were ,
preventing-an officer of the law from
discharging his'duty.". All the while the judge
speaks, his eyes are closed.

Where was your bullhorn,

"In my hand."

_ "It is therefore my contention that a
citizen might. resist arrest if she felt that to her
knowledge, as we seelater is the actual fact,
she was acting within the confines of the

law."

. Following Dobbs’ statement, both
lawyers summed up. Then the clerk asks,
"Does the judge wishto ‘render a decision at

this time?"

"I must make a telephone call," says the
judge. "Court is in recess for ten minutes."

"But your honor," says Dobbs. "I insist
the defendant resisted arrest because she
understood the reason for the arrest could not
be found within the city ordinances. Clearly,
she was not even charged with illegal use of a
bullhorn." '

"It is the officer’s perogative to

determine what, in his opinion, constitutes a

a justifiable arrest. He may also have had in
mind that he was acting to prevent a
rebellion. If the defendant chooses to
question the reason for an arrest, there is legal
recourse. She chose not to utilize that
recourse. ‘

He leaves the room through the back.

The woman in the pink hat talks with Dobbs.
The.mother of the little girl opens the manila

folder.

"There will be no reading of matters
not concerning the court," the clerk

announces."

"For the charge of resisting arrest I
impose a fine of $150." The judge’s eyes remain
closed. He waves in the direction of the
Clerk.

"The court is adjourned for lunch until
2:00 this afternoon," she says.

 

‘You may remain silent. If you do, we will beat a confession out of you ith'rubber hoses.
You may scream for an attorney, but this will go against you in court. . . .’

Dream Sequence #1

I’m swimming in a public pool - lots of
people around me - I get out of the water - I
have no bottom to my bathing suit - I think:
this is ridiculous. I can’t go to work like this.

Work Sequence #1

Six-thirty somehow comes two hours
earlier on a Monday morning. Roll over -
shake some life back into the left arm - I hope
there's enough hot water for a shower. Lately,
I don’t usually look in the mirror before my
teeth are brushed and my face is washed -
seems like my face wakes up half an hour after
the rest of me. Good grief. Who is this person
with the gray hairs in small clumps now? My
mother loves to point them out to me. Thanks
a heap. I should start naming them, like the
craters on the moon.

All right - stop daydreaming. Time is
so structured, so scheduled - I have only so
much time in the morning before work and I
have tons of shit to attend to. Wake up the
kid." Once she asked me why she has to go to
sleep at night when she’s wide awake and has
to wake up when she’s so sleepy. Wise guy.
Get moving. Your bus will be here in twenty
minutes. Do you have lunch money? Did you
brush your teeth? Do you have all your
books?... Your bus is here... Goodbye pal, I

love you. page 24

Graphic by Reiko Yano

Now I have twenty minutes before I
have to be out the door. I should have ironed
my clothes last night - too damned tired - lucky
I washed the dishes and put away most of the
laundry - still didn’t write that letter - too bad
- not enough time any more for anything - no,
not enough time left for a quiet breakfast.
Hurry up - quick bowl of cereal - at least it’s
brown rice crispies and sugar free corn
flakes.

Dream Sequence #2

I’m dreaming about working on a copy
machine - In reality, my daughter comes up the
stairs to ask me for a glass of water. I tell her,

"Wait a minute. Let me _turn on the light -
then I can make the adjustment. Where’s my
screwdr1ver?"

Work Sequence #2

I was so thrilled when I bought this
new car. I spend a lot of time driving around
dur1ng_the working day. I almost didn’t care
what kind of car I bought, as long as it had a
cassette player. Nice to hear my music.
Sometimes Iijust play the same tape over and
over y- Bob Marley, Eddy Grant, Rahsaan
Roland Kirk (...bright moments is for all the
very wonderful people in the universe that has

’ I hate driving around for work in the
winter. My feet get cold from stepping
through the snow in worn out shoes. I resent
cold feet. I can't find a place to park close to
the building I have to go into. Damn. Walk
two blocks carrying that tool bag. Somehow,
its weight varies - heaviest on a Monday
morning and on a Friday afternoon. But I do
have great biceps.

Dream Sequence #3

I am dreaming of someone’s copy

I ‘ ~ machine.‘ They are using a piece of cardboard A

to hold the paper. I tell them the correct way
to use it. They argue with me and tell me I'm
wrong. I get mad and start throwing paper all
over the place. Don't tell me I’m wrong - I
know what I’m talking bout. You’re all
crazy... .The paper turns tosnow. I'm outside,
in the middle of a snow bank - I can't get out -
I get scared. I have to get home... the kid’s
expecting me. I hope she’s all right.

 

Work Sequence #3

I’m glad it's Friday afternoon. Time to
put the tools down for acouple of days. Now
I have 2 1/2 days into which I have to cram

 

dozens of musts. Free time is a myth, a

remembrance from far away and long ago.
All weekends end up getting scheduled. Do u
the laundry, food shopping - battle with the
dust that accumulates on the floor and on the
plants - dusting my plants - thrilling...

Tomorrow I'll take the kid to a movie -
Then we can go the library and return those
books, then I can come home and get the soup
Oh yeah, I
should bring those clothes to the cleaners
before I need to start dusting them, too. What?
No, I don’t want to play a game of Monopoly.
Right now, I’m still
trying to hurry up and relax so I can enjoy
some part of this weekend and savor it so I
have something succulent to consider when I

started and make some crackers.
Sorry, some other night.

Cigar? I've been told it splits my smile
down to tolerable size. Though seems to get
harder to stay lit in this cold. And I,ain’t
saying there's any correlation to my natural

You mightn’t expect a man of double

Wasn’t.so‘when I was young and black.
Blaring away at that trumpet in packed rooms
set back from sight. Or laying that brass
do-wn light and taking these wrinkled hands
for quick walks on keyboards of ivory white.

sin, when people were sneaking in tospeak a

  THE MERCY FUCK BLUES

Before I tell you about my husband
Jimmy's song, The Mercy Fuck Blues, let me
tell you what got him and his buddies to write
it. Unemploymentll I can tell you what I know
about it. First of all, I don't have to stand "the
line," Jimmy does. He's been standing there
for 10 months now; the hardest 10 months of
our lives. ”

When he first had to stand "the line," it
wasn’t so bad. It was only going to be for a
few weeks, just until orders at the mill picked

I up. We’d sit at the kitchen table and discuss

who was or wasn’t going to get paid that

week. "I guess Dr. Roberts won’t repossess
_,Jim’s allergy shot if . he’s not paid right away."
The only heat in my kitchen right then was the
steam from J immy’s coffee mug.

A few months after his layoff, I had to
get a part-time job; bills were piling up. The
only thing I could get right away was cleaning

_ offices in the city a few nights a week. Jimmy

took that news real bad. "I’ve turned you into
a dammed maid for some prissy-assed broad
who’s too lazy to empty her own wastebasket.
Not exactly what I promised you when I
married you." ,The more I defended my need
to work, the warmer my kitchen got.

It was right after that when the boys

Greetings from Long Island!

I’m the female copy machine technician
whose work you have been kind enough to
publish in the past.

I have good news to share with you. I
got a new job. Ahcm, ahem - I am the new
Service Manager for COPYWORLD of Long
Island! They are a privately-owned, authorized
Savin dealer, and have four branches - L.I.,
Rochester, Buffalo and headquarters in
Pittsburgh!

1 had the chance to visit your city in
September and I must say, I loved it! I stood "
on the overlook area near the junction of the
rivers and I was surprised to see such a
beauty-filled panorama. I was there for five
days - I did field service calls for three days in
the downtown area - I had lunch one day at
Pepi’s - It was lots of fun.

I am also now running a writer’s group
at the Yours, Ours, Mine Community Center in
Levittown, NY. We meet twice a week, a group
of about 8 - We will be putting together a
literary magazine by January or so - I’ll be
sure to send some your way.

The next time I’m in Pittsburgh I’d love
to see the "Executive Suite" of the Mill Hunk

Herald.

PRODUCING MAGARAC

Dear Mill Hunk and friends,

Recently discovered that the Village
Voice did a piece on Mill Hunk which
included a poem of mine, "Priorities." Was
really amazed! Glad also and happy for Mill
Hunk. Anyway, glad to see that you are still
with it.

Presently l’ve been working with a
bunch of guys attempting to put together a
production around - well, what I mean by
production is original music, sculpture, visuals
(slides, films), etc., on a steel theme - actually
around Joe Magarac, the Slavic steelman.

to be called Joe Magarac.
to be an homage to steel.
steel men and women.
immigrant Slavs.

l’ve got a coupla places to present up
here in Buffalo - anything down in Pittsburgh
might be interested in this type of - what it
actually is is an - intermedia production (about
an hour’s time)?

Enclosed is a first part text GHOSTS.

For multi voices (ghosts actually) to introduce
narratives - this all fragments as the pieces
pull together - as bits of ore, coal and coke,
men, arms, eyes, sweat, lake ships, miners pull
together making steel.

Well, anyway, I expect the thing to be
finished by June or July when I will be
presenting in Buffalo. Let me know if
anything strikes you as interesting. We can
present (about 1/2 dozen people) in any art
space, big room, hall, etc.

Best, ‘

MR. CANELLE GOES TO WASHINGTON"

By Larry Evans

On a recent mid-March morning, I
boarded a D.C. bound bus packed with
ex-steelworkers brought together by the
economic drought and the Unemployed
Council of W. Pa. They hailed from rusted
milltowns like Johnstown, McKeesport,
Aliquippa and "Little" Washington and they
were busy psyching themselves up for a day of
lobbying with the big Boys on Capitol Hill. As
this rag-tag posse of Industrial "Revolution
veterans settled down for their 5 hour ride,
with tape recorder handy, I searched the smoke
filled aisle for some singular personality to
trail and document through the long day’s-
schedule (7 lobbying teams would take on 8
lawmakers each). I met a lanky gent with a
cowboy’s confidence, a‘ caustic sense of humor
and the delivery of a graveyard shift
grievanceman - sitting upright and eager in the
bus’ birdseat - one John Canelle. Here’s what I
learned about John... in his own words.

I worked for

National—Duquesne Works for 31 years. l’ve
been off 13 months — my plant’s on idle
status if you read the papers. I don’t know
what idle status means, okay, but... I’m
going to Washington, DC to talk to our
congressmen — like we talked to Joe Gaydos’
aide down on Fifth Avenue (in McKeesport)
last week - to tell them - not just for myself
alone but for anybody who’s job has been
affected by these imports — that the Federal
Government passed a law long ago that said,
”hey, there are federal funds to go for
retraining, for job relocation, to move if you
find a job somewhere else - the money‘s
there and it should be spread across the
board to every steelworker whose job was
affected by imports. They know what's
happening in Washington, DC. They listen to
the news! All we can do is go stick to their
as you know - just like a pimple on their ass
- to let them know that we are the
government - we are the people — they
work for us! They may wear zoot suits and
we wear combat shoes but they work for us!
And that's what we're going down therefor —
that’s what l want to tell ‘em.

A fella told me - a guy who got laid off,
run out of his benefits — no TRA (trade re-
adjustment allowance) — his wife and
children left him, he couldn't cope with the
situation, first he thought his problems was in
a bottle, woke up the next day and found out
that aln’t cured his problems. So he finally
had to go to welfare which was not his
normal way of life — We want to work! Does
31 years in the mill not count? I was workin’
paying my fair share — being a good citizen,
paying my taxes, paying my school taxes,
educating my children, being a good family

man... All of a sudden this guy loses all this
— so he goes to welfare which is another
joke... And the welfare says well, we need
an address before we can give you funds.
And he says, ‘well give me the funds, the
money, so I can go get a place to live and l’ll
come back with the address.” They says, ’’It

- don’t work that way." So he drowns himself.

is that what we all have to do - go drown
ourselves, hang ourselves, take the bridge?
Because the funds that are supposed to be
there to help us are not there? Is that the
answer - is that what we're all supposed to
do? .

  

’’If you hedijust put your money
into stocks instead of food and
clothes for your kids . . ."

l want to ask these legislators - show
me something that's been made in this ,
country - put it in my hands - that's been

 

"You wanna represent me,

right? Well, I’m here, tell me how
you’re gonna represent me! I don't
want no pep talk, no sweet talk,
there’s a lot of people back home
hurtin’, boy - I mean thousands -
we’re part of this world, too!"

actually made in the USA — not assembled
piece by piece here and there. Something
made totally _in this country and stamped
USA — that’s what I want to see! You know
where I’m coming from - we all got a mouth
and we all got an asshole and we’re all part
of this system and we should be treated fairly
by the system. I paid taxes for 51 goddamn
years. Here’s another thing -‘ come April 15,
everybody's going to run like scared rabbits
to file income tax - all these people —
unemployed — ran out of checks - they gotta
pay income tax - right? - a percentage of
that — where are they going to get the money
to pay this income tax — they ain't got money
to eat at McDonald's with - how they gonna
pay Uncle Sam come April 15? How much
money is being lost in social security with all
of us being unemployed? You know how
many people are unemployed in this
country? 15—million - if not more - 15 million
and they look at USX as just an isolated,
small shutdown pocket but they don't realize
that this country was founded by steel - you

read the history of Pittsburgh steel - the
cannon balls that were used in the Civil War
were made in the steel mills.

All of a sudden — we don’t count no
more! We built the city of Pittsburgh! And all
you hear about Pittsburgh is the Convention
Center, and their Arena, and Heinz Hall... I
don’t wanna hear that shit... It was built by
the foreigners, by the illiterates, by the whites
and the blacks — all of us! And up until 30
years ago there was discrimination in the
steel mills - did you know that? You had to
be a black to work the cindering pits - that's
always good enough for you because you
were black... You had to be an Irishman to
work in the carpenter’s shop, you had to be
a Johnny Bull to work in the machine shop.
When l got a job down there they asked me
what my nationality was — what the hell did
that have to do with it’? This country was
built by all—walks—of-life people — yet today
there's still discrimination in this country.
Today there’s discrimination against all of us
working people - that’s how I feel...

"I’ll be nice the
first go-round. But if I gotta keep

comin’ back - I’m gonna say,

‘Remember this face - hey I don’t 0

need this?" T

Now that’s a bunch of malarkey. That's
short—term - now they’re coming out with
60,000 or lifetime warranties. Now, I’m
unemployed 14 months. When I get phone
calls from Nebraska and Chicago wanting to
give me a credit ‘card with a $5000 credit line
that tells me, as an unemployed worker, that
even the banks are hurtin’. They don’t have
any long-term program. And concessions

‘ don’t pay long-term programs. - they don’t —

you gotta have supply and demand‘— you
gotta have the people workin", making a
decent wage to go out and buy that car.

We lost the power of supply to foreign
imports. They got cheap labor... allyour
tennis shoes, textile mills, it worked the first
time — now they’ll do it with steel, cars - what
next? They can build airplanes over there,
too. We have no long-term program. This
TRA (and going to school) - that’s even
short—term. Okay, because once you run out
of your TRA and TAA, you go to school to be
a bricklayer, but you get a job cookin’
hamburgers for$3.50 an hour and the
people tippin’ are paying the wages really -
the employer isn’t. Cuttin’ wages‘ just keeps
puttin’ us further and further back... and you
gonna go out and buy a TV set it you don’t
have a job? You gonna charge Christmas
gifts on a credit card with nothin’ coming in?
Why_don’t reporters cover the facts of life -
don’t tell me about hockey and baseball -
that’s pastime‘,_that’s recreation - people’s
lives are being affected — broken homes...

»Who’s gonna go to college these days -

nothin’ but Heinz’s kids, Joe Gayclos’s kids?
My children are grown up, thank God. What
about those people with teenagers — i feel for

A those people and I'm fightin’ for those

people. Because these people are American
citizens and the Government should come to
us first.

AN ALIQUIPPA

By Larry Evans
Pittsburgh, PA

A recent bracing March morning began
in hurried conversation with my retired
mother, a 30 year veteran of secretarial work
with a respected "family" construction firm
based in Baltimore. I mentioned to her that I
was on-my-way-out-the-door to videotap
a segment for my pro-labor PCTV *
(Pittsburgh Community Television) program i
called ”Our Own Show” - at high noon, a
thousand LTV pensioners were due to
parade down the main drag in Aliquippa. At
issue was a $400/month bite out of
thousands of retired steelworkers’ ”deferred
wages” - the low-blow byproduct of a one-
time ”promising" Corporate buy-out (of J&l
Steel), leading workers on to believe that a
bigger fish entering a stagnant pond might
stir up the waters to benefit even the
smallfries. ,

With an undisguised tone of bitterness
in her voice, Mom related how her parent
company (and indeed they were like
”parents" to her - a struggling widow with._
four dependents) was, in the late 70's,
swallowed up by a huge conglomerate which

A - over a pension liability dispute — purged

every decent and good feeling out of the
smaller firm's loyal workforce. Wrenched and
disillusioned, my mother is now convinced
that there is no bottom line to the depths of
callousness to which these Corporate
‘liquidators will stoop.

I loaded up a portable camera from the
Northside's PCTV studio near the West. End
Bridge and zipped up Route 65 past the
usual gauntlet of industrial aromas hovering
over the old Ohio where Alcosan and Neville
Island Chemical Plants do their business.

As I entered Beaver County, lthought of
a recent grim conversation with a woman
friend (and folksinger) who has lived all her
28 years just a mile downwind from the
Shippensport Nuke plant. Simultaneously
with her younger sister, she has suffered
through a mastectomy and radiation therapy,
fighting a cancer she is convinced was
brought about by her lviing in the shadows of
that plant’s poisonous Cooling Towers.

When Aliquippa came into view, parallel
images of downtown Braddock raced
through my mind — boarded up storefronts
decorated with jobless and hustlin' black
men - everything else at an eerie standstill.
threw up my camera just as the pensioners‘

march came into view at the far end of an
empty Franklin Street. Jerking signs and
chanting insulting slogans about LTV (Liars,
Thieves, Vultures), the few hundred retirees
resembled a rag-tag calvary comprised of
the forgotten veterans from the glory days of
the late great Industrial Revolution — an
outmoded army on a forced march to save
itself and its once proud frontier town of

I rusted dreams.

CONVERSATION

The march was proctored by a spirited,
black robed team of interdenominational
padres, who ”walk what they talk” and
appealed to some higher morality - "Who do
we depend on?" "Godl” ("What do we
want?” ”our pensions!”) ”What is our only
weapon?” ”Prayer!”

After the protest, I meandered back up
Franklin Avenue for some eight blocks before
I found a lunch counter open for business. I
would be the sole patron there to indulge in
the soup and sandwich special while "three
older women gossiped at the far end with a
young waitress. Clutching a Lotto ticket, one
woman took leave while asking a departing
question ”How much is it tonight?” "15
million” "Come to me baby!" she exclaimed
as she exited, pressing the ticket to her
bosom.

I shuttled my burger and fries closer
and asked to join their conversation. Here's
what llearned:

Laura: "l'Il tell you one thing - I think
that there should have been morepoeple out
there walkin’ - I think there’s a lot of men
sittin’ at home not doing nothin’ and they
shoulda been out... They’re depressed — the
whole town — you talk to their wives, and
thesemen are sleepin’. They should have a
lot of meetings and get everybody out!"

Serl: ’’I don't know what they can do
about it. The price of everything is goin’ up
and nobody’s workin’ and there’s no money.
I know what I'd do. I know what everybody
ought to do that works on the other end for
LTV and J&L. They ought to quit workin’ and
say, ‘You did this to some of your workers
and we might get the same.’ They were dirt
to us — when we worked they made money
from us and now they're taking everything
away. So I think the people who are still
working for the company should all go on
strike until we straighten this thing out
because they’re going to get the same in the
end themselves. That’s what the union
should do.” ~

Laura: "And send everybody down to
Dallas and make it bad for the company at
their headquarters. I think the majority would
do it. Why can't they take the money from
what they’re making down there and pay the
people like they’re supposed to?”

Serl: 'That’s right. They got these mills
overseas. They're making money. They’re
not in bankruptcy like up here. I worked all
my life in the tin mill at J&L. When they
retired me I was doing 5 jobs in one. When I
first got hired down there in '49 they had
about 400 women, most from the war years.
When I first worked there, I thought to myself,
how did these poor women work all those
years - like slaves. You weren't allowed to
talk or do nothin’."

Laura: "Now this one woman we know
is a widow and she said if her husband only
knew what was going on now — because he
thought he had her really settled - he’d turn
over in his grave.” A

Serl: "I don't know, who would you
blame? The government for some of it.
They could stop it. I don’t think Reagan will
help. If he would, he'd have done it before.
So I'm hoping for a Democrat government,
although I don’t really care if it's a Democrat
or Republican, just so they get in there and
straight this world — this United States — out.
I mean, if there's a war, what are they going
to_do? They can't go across the seas and
getthe steel to fight the war. And another
thing, they’re against the Bible. What are
they going to do when you have to swear on
the Bible? Nobody believes in God. They'll
just go on lying. What standards are they
going to have? I don’t think LTV believes in
God or they wouldn't do that to the people...
making people in their 60's and 70's, ready
for retirement, have heart attacks. They get
all shook up, dying of nerves. They’re sickly,
and you have to go worry about your
hospitalization. Are you gonna have it?"

Laura: ‘They forced everybody out of
the mill and promised them that $400. That's
a promise and they should keep a promise.
When you promise a little kid something you
better keep the promise, and that's what they
should do - keep the promise!"

Serl: "OK, so they take the $400 away

‘ from us, they put this in somebody else's

hands to pay and OK, them people go
bankrupt and we don't have anybody to

 

It's
acre

 

 

 

fight. . It was a maneuver to get away from
the responsibility. They are treating the
people of the United States wrong - closing
all these mills. One compnay falling right
after another. When they get away with this,
every other company will do the same thing.

 f The people who have the almighty buck are

taking away from the people. that don't have
none. They're going to put everyone on
welfare - even me. If they take my pension
away. what am I going to live on? Welfare.
What kind of world they call that?"

Laura: "Aliquippa used to be one of the
nicest towns. There were a lot of things to
do, had 5 & 10's, shoe stores, good clothing
stores. Every 5 minutes there was a bus.

We had activities, dances - the street was
beautiful - you could walk up the street, you
weren't afraid. Now today, you're afraid
you’re gonna get mugged because nobody’s
gettin' money. And there's only this one little
restaurant where we all meet. They're tearing
down all these buildings. This used to be
solid buildings up Franklin Avenue. The last
clothing store — Jacobs - is goin’ out; the eye
doctor moved — now it's the Beaver County
Unemployed Committee."

Serl: ''It makes everybody sad now it's
so quiet, you used to see smoke coming out.
When the smoke was goin’ up you knew the
people were workin’. Now people can't even
get a job - there's nothing. If they do, they
start at $3 an hour. And the utilities and food
are so high. On Sunday. I walk to church.
Seems like l‘m the only person on the streets.
lt's dead! J&L had the company store right
across theistreet, and people got credit and it

 

Page 31

was booming. l know. I: bought all my kid's
clothes there. After LTV took over J&L,
everything started goin’ down.”

Laura: ‘To rmemeber how it was before
and to see it now, it's sickening. it's just like
losing one of your family.”

Serl: "The younger people have all

' gone away. My daughter went to California.

From our church, I know, they're all going
down south. You know what that means for
families? They used to be close, now they're
all splittin' — one's here, one's there."

The waitress, in her mid-thirties, joins
the conversation: ''I stayed because my ,
youngest is 18 and graduates this year. He's
going into the service. A lot of the children
are. What do you have here? You don't
have the money to send them to school and
they can go to school there. You know
who's going to be left here? All the old
people.”

Serl: "Nobody can say they're not
worried, nobody. Even the people who
thought they had money, who saved... it's
goin’ down the drain... you can't afford to
get sick."

Laura: "My dentures broke, that's $130
there. I get a small pension. Now I have
hearing problems. I can't afford that! I need
new glasses. Can't afford that!"

Serl: "I mean that's not just here, that's
everybody! -We have one drug store left and
that's high, and these older ones can't drive
so... They say they're supposed to help
people. They give with one hand, take with
the "other. You don't even have money to
bury yourself because you looked forward to

that money J&L had to bury you. Now they
take it. Like these people in the high rise. As
soon as they get a social security raise what ’
do they do? Raise the rent! The government
gives with one hand, takes with the other.

F Only the rich are surviving. There ain't gonna _

be no middle class, and we're down to very,
very poor. I thought when I came out of J&L,
l’d live moderately. I mean, I wouldn't have a
lot of money to go on but I could live. I don't
own nothing because I raised my daughter
and took care of my mom and dad, and the
wages weren't that high what with the prices
of everything going up, up, up. But at least
you had work and money coming in so you
could pay. But now... everybody's worrying
about bills, no wonder everyone’s
depressed."

Laura: "A lot of people mention suicide.
Even younger people do. They think that's
the easy way out. After a certain age who's

~ gonna hire you? They don't want you.”

Serl: "Your hands are tied. You have
to sit back and take what comes. The only
ones who can do anything is the union, but I
don't know if they will."

Laura: ‘We need another Truman for
the common person. You can't eat the way
vou want to.”

Serl: "The government gives out food
stamps but why do they want that to

happen? Why don't they put people to work «

like the CCC? Fix these roads that are bad.
They’d be willing to do that." '

Waitress: "Right now, there's a lot of
alcoholism and stuff like that and they'll take
their last penny. They're so depressed, and
they go out and drink, and it clon’t help.
Everybody knows that, but they'll do it.”

Serl: ‘They'll use the money that they
have for gambling, trying to get ahead and
thinking they might win $100 and buy some
groceries. They use their last dollar trying to '
win-.” ‘

\ Laura: ”On TV I was watching ‘Divorce
Court,’ where this guy used up his last dollar
trying to hit it big, and when I saw that i said I
bet that happens a lot that you don't know
about. The same way.”

Serl: ”Cut the raises of those executives
and politicians. Let them come and live on
what we live on! We should never take
money away from education, not social
security, not the military. Hey, the way I
understand it, all these different countries
owe us money. Why don't they get after
them to pay us back?"

Waitress‘: "All our higher corporations.
They have their hands in overseas and they
should bring it all back here!"

Serl: "They're investing over there and
there are more and more people starving
here, and what kills me is they say -
unemployment’s down! The only reason why
it's down is because nobody’s drawing
unemployment checks and there's nobody
going to the unemployment office, it's not
because unemployrrient is down. it's
because nobody’s workin’. How could it be
down if nobody’s workin'?"

Waitress: ‘They try to hide all that. it's
not fair.” .

All three: "Just don't use our names...
we know too many people. And don't tell
them you talked here because we don't want
no brick comin' through the window!"

 

 

 

  
 

  

 

RUSTED DREAMS .

, For the major part of this century, the
steel industry has been a predominant‘ force
throughout the American economy. For the
communities that grew up around the steel
mills, steel represented the American Dream
come true. Steelmaking was hard, dirty, and
often dangerous work, but it provided decent
wages and ensured a good standard of living.
For the members of three and even four
generations of the same families, there was
usually no other way of life - or source of
income. But then, the American Dream began
to dissipate for these communities as various
factors - mismanagement, union troubles,
foreign competition, politics,,a troubled

. economy — conspired to turn the once

prosperous Steel Belt into today’s Rust Belt.‘

In RUSTED DREAMS, a .

R groundbreaking - and heartbreaking - book,

authors David Bensman and Roberta Lynch
explore how the hard times came to
Smokestack_,America, as they profile in-depth
the closing of two steel mills in Chicago's
Southeast Side. What happened on the
Southeast Side is typical of what scores of
cities throughout the U.S. were (and are)
experiencing: the grim realities of
de-industrialization.

This grippingly novelistic saga reveals

‘the human story behind all the headlines. But

it is a story that the authors are also careful to
place in a wider context, as well, by analyzing
the forces that impinged on the community
and the industry: the international economy,
corporate and governmental decisions, and
futile traditional solutions applied by political
leaders. It is time, ‘say the authors, for some
new solutions, and they describe possible
alternative programs to help restore the steel
industry toghealth and some cogent reasons we
should do so. Whether this nation can actually
mobilize to accomplish this will, they say,
profoundly affect A_merica’s role in the
expanding world economy of the 21st

century. AS Gar Alperovitz (president of The
National Center for Economic Alternatives,
and co-author of Rebuilding America), has
said, RUSTED DREAMS is "a brilliant and V
unique case study of how major sections of the
American economy are being destroyed - and
what can be done about it. Lucid, clear - the

My name is Father Jay Geister, a

Roman Catholic priest at St. Titus here in

Aliquippa and I've been active with the
Beaver County Unemployed Committee
since its inception. I've been a supporter as
far as the parish raising some funds when
they came to purchase this building and I
really believe in their cause.

After I left seminary and was ordained a
priest, Bishop«MeDowell, who's in charge of
programming for the unemployed, sent me
down here towork with these laid off
steelworkers. A

I had worked in this mill here for 3
summers in the union while I was going to
college and I was in management up at
Pittsburgh works for 3 years. I was a
foreman up the bar mill, then I went over to
the Hazelwood strip mill where I
unfortunately had the opportunity to
experience a mill shutdown. LTV
Corporation called us into the office and
proclaimed that as of today from Dallas,
Texas they decided that this historic
Hazelwood strip mill would close down. So I
felt the full impact, although I was transferred

and went across the river - the last job I had
was a scheduler, or "recipe maker” for the

electric furnaces up at Pittsburgh works 0

which were the most modern in the world.

So, I've been around here as far as seeing_
the mills and I felt the agony of the men as I
was therefor three -months while they
liquidated all the steel -at the strip mill.

The mill closings affected my decision to
enter the seminary, that and the death of a
fiancee - I was really struggling with the
meaning of life and I wanted to get involved
with some great cause and I've got a lot of
em down here in Aliquippa especially with
unemployment and now with LTV
pensioners. If these retirees are forced back
into the job market it's just going to make it
mueh_ more competitive for the unemployed
and under-employed who are struggling with
what few jobs there are. That's one of the
reasons that the Solidarity movement (for
LTV pensioners) is linked with the Beaver
County Unemployed Committee in the sense

‘ that if you put these retirees back in the job

market - there's 30% unemployment here to
begin with- you'll just have a saturated
market for all these low paying no-beneﬁts
jobs.

 

_ I think someday what we're
going to see develop out of all these
pension and unemployed struggles is
an amendment to the US
Constitution - a worker's bill of
rights. #1 is the right to work,
followed on by the right to a livable
retirement, with benefits, health
insurance, to unionize, to rest, to

The history of "Solidarity" is not long but
definitely based on noble sentiment. What
basically happened was that on July 17th,

A LTV Corporation declared Chapter 11 under

a bankruptcy code that was originally written

— in 1898 when the accepted theory was "use

the workers and discard them" so they went
belly-up after having giving some bonuses to
their executives for superior performance and
that night they unilaterally cutoff the medical
beneﬁts to some 78,000 retirees nationwide,
15,000 from Pa. And immediately some
protests struck up and a woman from
Youngstown, Ohio, a wife of a steelworker,
Dolores Horisic, she founded the first group
of Solidarity USA and I was here for the
founding meeting down here in Aliquippa at
the NPI club and what eventually happened,
the Indiana Harbor Steelworkers went on
strike there and after about 10 days, they re-
_lnstated the Blue Cross Blue Shield and then
Solidarity went to Washington and was
instrumental in passing a bill which extended
the medical benefits to May 15th. Most’
recently, on Feb. 9, 1987, LTV cut off a $400
monthly pension supplement which these
men simply cannot afford to lose. The need
for Solidarity becomes paramount as the fight
of the pensioners rages on. .

I think someday what we're going to see
developlout of all these pension and
unemployed struggles is an amendment to
the US Constitution - a worker's bill of rights.
#1 is the right to work, followed on by the
right to a livable retirement, with beneﬁts,
health insurance, to unionize, to‘ rest, to have
time off. That would be a great highlight to
our movement. Another thing that should
happen is more proﬁt-sharing. I think that's
Capitalism's answer to Communism.
Because once you do that, the workers are
going to say, hey, this is my company, too,
and I need to have a voice in it and it won't
be an us-them situation. This whole
Solidarity movement involves blue and white
collar - which is unique, unionized and non-
unionized, men and women, black and white
- a great umbrella bringing in the
unemployed committees, unions and
management.

. Remember, the Solidarnosc movement
in Poland was born out of the oppression by
the state—run economic system in Poland

and I think we're seeing oppression here,
especially by the huge corporations when
they decide to pump vast quantities of
money overseas and the military spends vast
sums on armaments. As Martin Luther King
said, ”Any nation that spends more on
products for war than on services for the
people is reaching spiritual death.” That's
where the churches are getting involved. In
Poland it's a Catholic movement, but over
here it's more an ecumenical movement,
involving an Episcopal bishop, Baptists,
Catholics. I think the churches realize that
this whole economic issue is wrapped up in
the spiritual because it's hard to pray on an
empty stomach. The whole key is getting the
country back to work - repairing the
infrastructure - the roads, bridges, sewer
systems - there's more than enough work
here. What there isn't is enough jobs and we
have to work with the corporations, unions
and government, making creative, fulfilling
jobs. I think this country is sliding into a
depression and that will organize the people
and get us unified one way or the other. It's
inevitable. The huge deficit facing us and
foreign debt default, and when I see all the
games being played with law and rules and
corporate raiding, we're going to hit a bottom
someday — a collapse that will draw people
together. Unfortunately it's going to have to

be painful to get people motivated.
What I would do with the military —

' instead of spending this tremendous amount

of tax dollars on weapons - I would really
expand the Engineering Corps which could
provide the leadership and expertise to lead
something like a CCC - Civilian Conservation
Corps - there's more than enough work in
this country. People sometimes wonder if I
am a pacifist - no, I'm not a pacifist, I'm a
peace—|oving person. As the Romans always
said, "If you seek peace, prepare for war"
and the best way to prepare to keep the
peace is have _a strong people — that means
economically and socially - jobs and justice
not just militarily - the greatest nations in the
world have fallen from within - look at the
Chinese - they had the Great Wall of China -
this great military defense - sort of the Star
Wars of its day — what happened? They

bribed a few guards and they let the Mongols '

in. You need internal strength, a united
country, united in jobs and shared
opportunity and responsibilities - that's our
best defense.

Look at our recent wars, like Vietnam,
who is it that dies? The poor, the blacks, the
minorities. Those who are lowly and that's
not a healthy military.

The Unemployed Council is so
important looking at the long haul because
these problems are not going to go away
overnight. I can see Solidarity working
closely with them for the rights of working
people so that we rebuild a strong America -
one that works and believes in itself. Then all
we need is God and if we get a little money
here and there. things will be all right.

DIARY OF A PEACE MARCHER

By Marilyn Ham Pittsburgh‘, PA

11-14-86

6:45 a.m. Am I dreaming? I hear the
strange tinkle of an Oriental bell. A soft
voice encourages getting up into a cold sunny
dawn. Out of a warm sleeping bag, hastily
dressing, I join the long lines for a huge and
"healthy" pancake and egg breakfast. ' I pack
up and stow the gear on a trailer truck covered
with peace murals.

9:00 a.m. ‘The line forms. First our
banner, "The Great Peace March for Global
Nuclear Disarmament," next a row of state and
national flags and peace symbols. Fifty feet
or so behind a row of five Japanese Buddhist
monks strikes a rhythmic beat to help us keep
the pace. We huddletogether in the cold
anxious to be off. Who will I meet today?
Talked with Pard yesterday. He’s a
Presbyterian minister in his 60’s who usually
precedes the march talking of nuclear
disarmament to church groups and making
arrangements for the peace marchers to meet
local folks. I’m overjoyed to see two friends
made when the Great Peace March camped in
Schenley Park, Pittsburgh: "Grandmother" a
long distance marcher and mover and Janet, a
mid-western young person taking time from a
career to express her concern over a life and
death issue.

The police escort has arrived. Now we
can proceed walking along on the right lane of
the road. Motorists who know the March’s
purpose wave and honk as they pass. We
respond with peace signs. Energetic marchers
frequently leap from the line onto porches
leafletting and chatting with residents. Soon
our support vehicles begin to pass: big trailer
trucks containing gear and the kitchen, an
information trailer, school buses containing a
Peace Academy and Library, a post office, and
most important, a pre-school bus holding the
children of the marchers. When we see the
trucks carrying the porta-johns, we know a rest
stop (planned for every four miles) is
impending. (I have noted with amusement
that one major means of communication on the
GPM is the plastering of notices on the john
doors.)

11:00 am. Today is the last full day of
marching before Washington. Some of our
leaders suggest a final‘ ceremony of
togetherness before to‘morrow’s climactic
events. We join hands in a huge circle while
another group forms an outer circle facing us.
A thousand people stay silent as a leader
reminds us that on this very day another
nuclear device is being exploded in the Nevada
desert. Someone starts a song, others join, but
I am too moved to sing. I am thinking about

SONGS OF LABOR

Dear Friends:

I’m enclosing some information on a
project I thought you might be interested in.

For some time now, we've been in
agreement that our schools need to do a better
job in teaching about the labor movement.

But getting schools and teachers to create
materials and add subjects to their curriculum
in this era of budget cuts is difficult at best.
That’s why we in the labor movement need to
be creating materials so that teachers can,
without a great deal of preparation, teach
about the labor movement.

This is why a colleague of mine, Alice
Hoffman, and I decided to put Sing a Song of
Unsung Heroes and Heroines together. It’s a
book designed for 5th graders (and up to
junior high) which tells the story of ten
unsung heroes and heroines in personal and
everyday terms. It includes some people who
we recognize as famous like Mother Jones or
Philip Murray but also includes a number of
everyday workers.

Each chapter begins with a song, and it
is often integrated into the text. They include
traditional tunes like Peg and Awl and A
Miner's Life as well as some lesser known songs
like Factory Girl as well as Glenn Plumer’s
original Breaker Boy.

Although the project is based on
Pennsylvania, there is no reason it could not be
used elsewhere with some introduction and

addition.

I’m enclosing a flyer with ordering

Peace City comes alive early today. At
the starting place people snatch a quick
breakfast, mill around looking for friends,
begin to line up for the last march. First we
tramp to Meridian Hill (Malcolm X) Park, then
Lafayette Park, and finally the Lincoln
Memorial. Today our number has been
enlarged bybus loads of believers in peace
from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Iowa. New

’ banners and clever displays accompany us. We

pass through a black neighborhood. People
smile and wave. At our first stop we are
welcomed by a city council member and
serenaded by Paul Yarrow of Peter, Paul, and
Mary. He reminds us that marching can make a

0 I »
2 V,

difference and cites a Kissinger statement

zdocumenting a halt to the bombing of Vietnam
as a result of the Vietnam protest march held

in.Washington just seventeen years agotoday.
As the newcomers to the group listen to the
speakers, the long term marchers stage their
own activities at the further end of the park.
Forming circles, they hug, cry, and joke as
they begin the process of disengagement from
the march.

We reassemble once again this time for
a silent walk. We had received a tiny card

‘which read "Can words adequately express our

concern about nuclear weapons, our hopes for

our children, our country, our world?
Hiroshima’s dead, and the unborn future,
watch us silently. We are walking for them...
We are speaking out, in silence." Marching
down 16th Street now 3,000 strong we maintain
our silence until Foundry Methodist Church.
As we approach, the church bells ring
furiously. People cover the church steps
cheering and releasing balloons into the air
and into the hands of the marchers. We
experience again the warmth that comes when
we realize others are getting the message.

Lafayette Park contains a crowd of
welcoming people who have cleared a path for
uspas we wind toward the stage area. Carl
Sagan speaks, "Reason ultimately will prevail
(to end the arms race). The alternative is that
no one will be left to do the reasoning or the‘
emoting." While the ceremonies take place, a
row of mounted policemen line the sidewalk in
front of the White House. On the park
sidewalk, Charles Hyder, Ph.D., continues in
the 54th day of a fast to protest nuclear arms.

The last lap of the Great Peace March
has begun. _ The marchers approach Lincoln
Memorial and divide into two long lines on
either side of the reflecting pool. Awaiting on
the steps are some five thousand peopl,c.__,
supporters and celebrities, the latter including
Holly Near (singer), Ralph Nader, Jesse
Jackson, Congressman Ed Markey, a retired

Air Iforce general. Speeches from the famous
are interspersed with rousing talks from
selected marchers, stirring music and finally a,
candlelight ceremony’ with the John Lennon
song, "Imagine." Many thousands of human
beings have joined together in a quiet
statement of their hopes for peace.

PEACE MARCH LAMPOONS

WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE

After having met Jesus times 5000,
Michael/Rod/Jesus, and a gentleman with
business cards proclaiming him Christ II, I
began to realize the true purpose of the Great
Peace March. It was, quite obviously, meant to
serve as a mechanism for screening everyone
in America who thinks he/she is God, in order
to discover the one true and obvious
‘manifestation of the Second Coming. To make
this task more efficient we therefore set up the
following process for all incoming Messiahs:

1. Report to Entry vehicle where You
will be given Your tent and assigned to a
neighborhood. Yours, of course, will be Christ
Village, where You will be among campers
with like interests.

2. Go to the work coordinator who will
assign You a job. Your job will undoubtedly
be as God Officer of the Day.

3. As GOD Your duties will consist of
preceding the march to the lunch site, then to
feed all the marchers using a loaf and a fish.

4. If you like the work, are performing
well and wish to stay in the peace business,

. You will be encouraged to help us begin

preparations for our European march, leaving
next year from London. Feel free to start
walking whenever you are ready.

Peace March One Liners

I understand Nancy Reagan hates drugs
.- so how come shc’s still married to a dope?

I heard that Ronald Reagan lifts
weights - it’s compensation for never handling
any heavy issues.

You older folks might remember that
Reagan used to be the host of GE Theater, But
his honesty forced him to quit that job. He
just couldn’t bring himself to close the
program with the company’s slogan every
night: And remember, Progress is our most
important product.

 

 

 

 

 

. Page 41
I'm starting to understand how

Reagan’s mind works. For example, the
Reagan Syllogism: The oppositeof left is right;
the opposite of right is wrong; therefore, left is
wrong. I

I read the other day where Nancy won’t
sleep with Ronnie anymore if he insists on
being on top. She can’t stand it when the
joke’s on her. V

I hear Ronnie's typist got a new, job.
She’s been promoted to Secretary to the
Inferior.

Of course Ronald Reagan supports a

third term 5 he can’t remember the first two.

I’ve been in Dixon, Illinois recently and
I’d like the President to know that you can go
home again. Preferably as soon as possible.

One thing I do have in common with
Ronald Reagan. I’d also like to know where the
rest of himis. A

Clearly Ronald Reagan needs some new
script writers. Might I suggest the Hollywood
10?

I was at a newsstand recently looking
for Reagan’s autobiography. It took some
searching, but I finally, found it. It’s behind
the Times.

Ronald Reagan is a closet vegetarian.
He puts ketchup on everything.

The problem with not participating in
the Democratic Process is that you get what

"they deserve.

ONE DAY ON THE MARCH

March Leader: Everybody ready? Let's
have a circle before we head out.

Assembled Marchers: Circle? No way.
I hate circles. Too weird. Uh-uh (etc.)

March Leader: Okay, I hear you. How
about a song?

Assembled Marchers: Are you shittin’
me? A song? At six o'clock in the bleepin’
morning you expect us to sing? No way.
Forget it. (etc.)

March Leader: Oh, all right, then.

Let’s just line up behind the flags and get outta:

here.

Assembled Marchers: FLAGS? I hate
the goddamn flags. Forget it. What’s a flag
but a piece of cloth? No way - no flags (etc.)

March Leader: I don’t believe this.

You sound like the most apathetic... Come on,

where's your spirit?

At this a marcher emerges from back in A

the column, working his way up front as he
speaks and as his energy level builds to a
crescendo he intones:

Spirit? Spirit? Where is your spirit?

Where is my spirit? Before last night I had no '
spirit. The spirit had deserted me and I was as .

an empty vessel. But then, last night as I lay

~ in my sleeping bag, weary and sick at heart, I

felt a stirring in my tent. And then, then a
light began to_ shine and my poles began to
shake. And the light grew brighter, and I
looked, and I saw it. It was the spirit. And
the spirit stood before me in my tent (it was a
short spirit), and the spirit was a black man in
a sarong wearing a torch and carrying a
crown. And the spirit said: Give me your
tired, your poor, your huddled marchers

yearning to breathe free. The wretched ref use:

of your 7-ll store. Send these, the drugless,
politically tossed to me, for this is~an open
camp. And the spirit said: I marched with
Martin Luther King in a column, behind the
flags, according to a dress code. And the

spirit said: I marched with Gandhi to the river

for salt and I complained not about_a
contract. And the spirit said: I marched

behind Mario Savio at Berkeley and I asked
not what was in my peanut butter sandwich.
And the spirit said: I marched behind Pat t
Boone in white bucks and I looked not for a
tent space near the locker trucks. And the
spirit said: I marched behind the other Jerry
Rubin, in Chicago, and I asked not where the
next portapot stop was. And the spirit said: I
marched behind Desmond Toto, in Kansas,
against apartheid and I questioned not how to
liquidate my assets. If you do love your cause
as I do love mine, you will march with pride,
even unto the gates of Washington, D.C.

March Leader: Then, brother, are you
ready to march?

Born Again Marcher: I’d love to. But
who’ll drive my Subaru?

  
    

 

 

From my window I see the dead mills
along the river, the silver domed Byzantine
Church in the green hills of the Mon Valley.
I’m up early this Saturday looking. out at the
high-level bridge for a sign of their coming.
Not knowing how far I might be traveling and
knowing that I’ll need extra energy I eat whole
wheat rice crispies for breakfast. The
weather is muggy and I’m worried that rain

, might cancel it all. No matter what, I will

definitely wear my Jobs with Peace t-shirt. I,
carry my coffee cup to the VW and drive down
to the mill gates by the railroad tracks. Just as
I arrive, I see them coming, the flag bearers in
front, over the bridge, turning at the ramp that
leads down to where the locked out workers sit
in front of the mill. Brown skinned, lean and
beautiful, they come, from California, Hawaii,
New Zealand’, Australia, Europe. Excitedly,
coffee cup in hand,_tears in my eyes I
welcomed them to Homestead feeling like a
committee of one. When the local organizers
arrived, Mike Stout, a grievance man from
USW Local 1397 climbed atop a big, steel
barrel and did the formal welcome, bringing ’
his outstretched arms together in a symbol for

a united labor and peace movement. He told
the 700_Peace Marchers that Homestead has
twicethe national suicide and alcoholism rate,
that Pittsburgh is the home of Rockwell
International and Westinghouse, major arms
brokers, and what ran them and USW was the
same greed. A walker from Marin County, CA
told me he thought he was in an
underdeveloped country when he walked into
Pittsburgh through the Northside. Then we
movedalong the main avenue of Homestead.
Women from the Blue Bonnet Bakery came out
to shake our hands. People came out of their
small "houses with the faces of middle Europe,
an old world courtesy in their greeting. A
town cut-off, isolated, 17% of its people below
the poverty line, a military recruitment office
that boasts the highest enlistment in the
country, was being touched today be fellow
humans who cared enough to march across a
country. We marched on to McKeesport where
the Mayor greeted us briefly, before rushing
off to referee a football game. I joined some
of the marchers in their portable kitchen to
chop vegetables for dinner. An example to

able to feed the hundreds who had joined them
both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals with
an incredible relaxed efficiency. _The peace
one f elt* at this amazing sharing made me
wonder what it would be like if a whole
country operated in this way.

The next day as I crossed the bridge in
my car, past the locked out workers, I wished
they ‘had experienced the rally yesterday. As I
passed the exit ramp to the mill gates I saw a
blond, tan young man pulling the wheeled
wooden sled the Peace Marchers designed to
pull children and sleeping bags. He hesitated
as if not sure of his direction. I smiled from
the car andwatched him make the turn down
the ramp toward the workers. He smiled
back. He was the last of the peace marchers -
he knew where he was going.

  TRIDENT TRESPASS

 

 

 

By Sarah Willner
Baltimore, MD‘

We were walking from Kings Bay,
Georgia to Cape Canaveral to protest the first
test of the first strike Trident II D-5 missile.
Okay. The test date wasoriginally Jan. 17,
moved to Jan. 15 but we knew it would be
pushed even sooner, because we (Florida
Coalition for Peace and Justice, Mobe) had
warned the base that we had interesting plans
that might affect them. I Anyway, the plan was
to send in occupiers in teams of 2, 3 or 4 to
sneak into the base and pierce the security
zone near the launch site, Over 50 people
attempted this in the course of about 8 days. I
To the best of our knowledge, we did manage
to foil an early test launch, so that the thing
did not go up till the 15th. Occupiers had
varying degrees of success. These were people
who managed to explore the base in its
entirely, walk right into the security zone,
leave proof of their presence and walk right
off the base. There was one black woman,
acting alone, who walked herself up to the
13th floor of a Titan Mobile Unit. And then
had to call security twice before they came to V
get her. My stand was far less heroic. By day
6, when my team set off to save the world from
fiery destruction,‘security had tightened ,
considerably and we were picked up on
infrared scanners'in short ‘order. So all I got
to do was plunge into the brush and hold still
for about half an hour. We did gain some
notoriety, however, for being on a ‘straight line
to an alligator. But we weren’t that bad, we
heard later there were folks who lasted 30
seconds. ‘Of course we may have been the
Keystone Kops of guerrilla activity, but the
arresting authorities played some slapstick of
their own. People got busted on the same spot
and slapped with different charges. Federal,
state, who knew? Refusing to give names was
sometimes treatedmas nonviolently resisting
arrest. But not always. Utter chaos has
marked this process from the word go. When
all were processed on the 15th, the day the
damn thing went up, there were 58 in jail.
Most were occupiers, a few were gate blockers,
one we called A.J., Accidental Jane, whowas
arrested for asking for her banner back.
Using our solidarity agreement we entered the
system as Jane and John Does. Our tactic was *

no names, no money, choke the system. Page 45

Thesday of the demonstration 4500
people arrived at the gate. Now, if the news
media behaved responsibly you would know
that. That I feel the need to tell you myself
indicates my faith in the media. Perhaps you
know someone who rode down on the Peace
Train out of New England. And, over the
fence, around the gate, through the bog, and V
over to jail went 138 more. And under an
open canopy, because there was no room at the
inn. Those of us on the inside were jealous.

Oh, the jail. We heard it was a pit.

Well, I’m from the Northeast, major
metropolitan area, serious slums. So I’m
expecting an open cell, mattresses on the floor,
exposed wiring, leaky ceilings, rats, roaches,
slime. Showers en masse twice a week. Real‘
horror novel shit. So I almost feel tacky
complaining. ‘I'm in my third cell now. We
started off in a trustee's cell which, though
built for four, ended up holding 13 of us.
Roaches yes, and a few spiders, but no other
wildlife. Two toilets, unenclosed. A shower.
A shower? A shower! A TV that only gets
ABC (which stiffed our story completely). A
phone outgoing collect calls only. Second
home was a cell block. Four 4-bunk cells and
a common room. The spacefor 16 held 23
comfortably. One shower, 5 toilets. Of
course there were no lights and no TV, but the
phone worked fine. We are now in cell 3.
Small, but of course we are being protected
from the general population and held together,
alone. Yes, there’s a shower and TV. Even
electric lights. But no phone. You cannot
imagine‘ how abandoned I feel in here with no

phone. Cut off from my support team on the

outside. Cut off from my friends across the
country. Cut off from our office and our
lawyers. Cut off from media. Last night I
finally got pissed. Really bullshit pissed.

And I called home, played the jail card and put
out the word to call the local media and
political heavies and hell, Mike Wallace and
Ted Koppel and Bill Kuntsler and whoever.
Today they locked me up in a cell with no
phone.

What else is fun about jail? One
morning I woke up with a soreness in my arm
that felt like I had just given blood. Turned
out my arm was swollen. Probably a spider
bite. We have never been exercised. I am in

 

 

 

day 15 without sunshine, moving air,‘ roofless
sky. After living outdoors for 10 months.

After walking, running every day. We tried to
. work out in the cell, though in here there is

barely room to stretch. We have all finally
given our names. We, being the women.
Many of the men are still hanging tough.
Macho or principle? Both I suspect. Does get
no privileges. Privileges are defined as
spending our own money in the commissary,
receiving packages, _books, visitors, and

‘ medical treatment. That’s right, medical

treatment. Some of our women folded
hundreds of peace cranes and hung them from
our bars. The jailers confiscated them and
will destroy our little flights of freedom.

MEDAL or HONOR  

On July 30, 1986 in Washington, D.C.,
Charles Liteky returned his Medal of Honor to
the government at the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial..Later., joined by three more
veterans, he began a 47 day water-fast at the
Capitol to protest U.S. actions against
Nicaragua.

Before comrades’ names

etched rank on rank

in eternal march

down black marble slabs, T

he laid his honor:

itsblue ribbon encircling nothing
its metal, forged in fire and blood,
cold-

On Capitol doorsteps,

while the moon filled, emptied
and filled again,

he nourished the anonymous

‘ ‘With his hunger,

woke peacemakers in us.

His honor waits

for laughter

of someday’s children
born of men

who may not die

Severed from soldiers’ dying, E ‘

For the civilians of nearby Middletown, Pa.

Catastrophe was much more slow and personal then.
Each mini ball had its own shape and texture,

And could not range beyond the farm house or cow pasture.

Today, there is no more safety behind trees.

There will be no need for nursing after Star Wars,
For we will be surprised in such a swift, loud fireball,

I was prepared to face the Trident missile, though I had no idea
how I would react when it stood, in hideous reality, before me.

I still do not know. I never made it to the lair of the fire
breathing dragon.

But_I was prepared to. I still am.

Yet I am not prepared to face you, though I have some idea of
how I will behave when you stand, in your current ‘
incarnation, before me.

I can imagine it. Though I have not yet seen‘ the physical
reality of the ravaging disease on a friend,

I have prepared to. As much as I can.

I think _I slept as well as I did last night
Because the confusion so consumed my being.

Millions watch in raptured fascination as the missile is
launched to slash fire across our sky.

But close friends and family turn faces and bodies away
when the disease unleashes itself to burn out a loved one. a

We stand in silence before the death of humanity. We allow
it. We pay for it. We support it.

We turn away in horror, disgust, before the dying of a friend.
We disavow it. We disown it. We deny it. I

I cannot stand in silence before the death of the planet. I cry
out in defiance, have to wake the world to a terror I will
not permit.

I will not turn away in rejection before the death of a man.

I will face him in serenity, speak gently to revive the
world between us to the tenderness we once created.

Oh god, Paul. I knew it might/could/would come to this one
day.
But I never dreamed I would be there when it did.
I came here to fight the death of humanity and now you
have given me the opportunity to celebrate the life of a human.

I stood tall before the purveyors of death here.
I am humbled before your daily recreation of life.

But as I reread this I find that I have named the Trident

Yet I have not had the courage to (and struggle within the
confines of this line to) acknowledge AIDS.

MISSINGIN ACTION: MEMORIAL DAZED
    1986  

Part 1: Newsclips

WASHINGTON, D.C., February 15,

1986 -Orland Payne.McCafferty of Lee
Summit, Mo., was listed in critical condition
today at the Francis Scott Key Medical Center
in Baltimore after setting fire to himself in
front of the White House. A letter to President
Reagan was found in McCafferty’s
automobile. It opposed the Reagan
Administration’s economic policies and
attacked their mistreatment of military
veterans. Lieutenant Colonel McCafferty, 58,
is an Army reservist and Korean War veteran
who’d been unemployed for about a year,
according to members of his family. (New
York Times, February 16, 1986)

MIAMI, Fla., February 23, 1986 -
William A. Miller, a 75 year old veteran of
World WAr II was killed while attempting to
drive his wheelchair 160 miles from the Miami
Veterans Administration Hospital to Key West,
where he lived on the streets. Medical
personnel had determined that he wasn’t in
sufficient need of medical attention to be
admitted.

Police found papers in Miller’s pockets
which included a one-way bus ticket which he
had usedto get to Miami. Also found were
requests to various social service agencies for a
financial aid for a return ticket. The requests
had all been rejected. William Miller had
wheeled 11 miles along the side of a freeway
before he was accidentally run down. (New
York Times, February 24, 1986) ‘

STARKE, Fla., April 22, 1986 - David
Livingstone Funchess, 39, was executed today
after being convicted of stabbing two people to
death during a 1974 tavern robbery attempt.
‘Funchess was a purple, heart veteran of the
Viet Nam War and suffered from the effects
of post traumatic stress syndrome, according to

. his lawyers. ‘ He also had become addicted to

various drugs as a result of medical treatment
for his war wounds. The illnesses were not -
allowed as mitigating evidence during his

trial. ‘Page 

 

Funchess had graduated in the upper
third of his class when he graduated from high
school. He was sent into combat in 1967 at the
age of 19. Ten weeks after landing "in
country," he stepped on __a land mine. David
Funchess is the first Viet Nam veteran to be
executed. (New York Times, Chicago Sun
Times, April 23, 1986)

V Part 
Vic’s Christmas Story; POOF]

POOF: A puff of smoke and that’s

that. Larry calls it "the first clean fact." Vic
said that the funny thing is, you smell it
before anything else. He doesn't recall the
blast or the flash, only the smell. Kinda like a
thousand matches being struck at the same
time.

He laughs about it when he tells it
now. Says that when he got over there, he
kept holding his hand up above the hole
"trying to catch a round or two so I could get
my ass out of t-here. Hell of an attitude for a
marine, huh.

"But the damn fuckers never hit the
damned hand," he says now, laughing and

shaking his head.

"I got my wish though," he says finally,
pushing his three fingered hand into my face. ‘ .

"Yeah. I was right behind the radio guy ..
on a patrol. It’s the worst goddamned place to
be. You see, they had these battery activated
mines. Put two wires together and  POOF.

It’s all she wrote. Only the battery musta» been
weak or somethin because the radio guy, he
made it through all right. At least that time.
He was able to call in a dust-off in time for‘
me."

By now, Vic has "wrapped his three
finger hand inside of his whole hand, trying to
hide it, like he’s ashamed. But after a few
more tokes and a few more drinks, he pulls up
his sleeves to show the pieces of shrapnel
which can never be removed. His body is
speckled with purple-gray dots and splotches.
None are in the shape of a heart.

ozuwsmao

upqgo-Offdf) Q95‘?

 

 

Vic’s a classical cat. He was raised on
a farm downstate and was an accomplished
pianist before he went overseas. Three
fingered or not, he can still chop out a bit o
Chopin. It helps him on his job. ..

He teaches "educably mentally
handicapped" children. That’s bureaucrateze

. for children who will never be able to learn to

read or write. Vicsays the music is really
important. "With Chopin, they don’t have to
learn any words." ’

"Sometimes the kids and the music,
they’re the only things that make sense."

AUGUST 1985

Forty years agone we heard

that one new dawn star was lit over a desert,
and two more over cities :

a light to end the darkness

sprawling over all the globe.

This must be nostalgia --

there was charm in the instructions
the nuns gave us :

avoid windows; '

look for a cellar room;

if you must, huddle under your desk;
cover your eyes. '
A three-year-old, shoulder high for V-J Day I believed ‘it,
and again in school. I wish

I could trust such a remedy now.

A My son learned about terrorists at the Oktoberfest,

forty feet from a detonation,
by being showered with fragments of one,
raining down with his victims;

He knows the numbers,

lives with the knowledge

of cold steel tubes flanking his life

and filled with askyful of stars.

He is not even instructed to cover his eyes.

Even then and even now,

death by starfire is not perfected;
victims keep emerging

from those small early starbursts.

I have lived forever,

~ by these standards,

and it did no good. Even

evading starfire one more day cannot
close and melt those tubes

which hide under prairies

and live in Jack’s mind.

I could yearn for annihilation .
in place of fear
if it were only me.

RUN,

VETERAN'S DAY

We traded our olive-drabs

for Brooks Brother’s gray,
went to college on the G.I. Bill,
voted for Ike,

and married.

We are standing now at the Men's Bar
talking and laughing

and bending to and fro

like reeds in a whisky wind.

The Major stands attention straight
to lock in place his infirm knee.

He sweats and grimaces

in the gloom and noise.

Here and there are crew-cuts
standing short
in grizzled widow's peak.

Dismissed for lunch

we squint and lean in the mahogany air,
to see and hear i

above the murky din.

Or just stand back
on gin straight legs
and wait.

THE SWAMP

Almost 20 years ago, I was dumped in a strange swamp
and told to find my own way out.

I started walking, but with every step I seemed to
sink in deeper and deeper.

But I kept on walking, what choice did I have?_
If I had stopped, I would have sunk in over my head.

Finally I did make it out and thought
"Thank God, it’s over."

But I was to learn, it was only the beginning.
Every time I looked back, I could see my footprints.

I wished I hadn't entered in the first place but that
didn’t make my footprints go away. I

My shoes were caked with mud and it wouldn’t wash off.

So I tried to forget the shoes, thefootprints, the swamp
but my numb mind led me right back in.

Yeah, I may be slow, but I learn.

Today_I know the footprints will remain,
they’re mine for the duration.

My shoes aren’t new anymore .
but they still have alot of miles left on them.

So I’ve taken up my post,
a sentry at the entrance to the swamp. ‘

There I can help those still stuck inside.

FORIGN POLICY_FIREPOWER %

By Bill Johnston
Tacoma, WA

Terrorism: A terrorizing; use of terror A
and violence to intimidate, sub jugate.
(Webster’s New World Dictionary)

Politics defines the meaning of words."
You maynot even realize it but your
understanding of such emotionally charged
words as terrorism has been formed in a
political context.

Recently that political context has been
supplied through the right wing theoretical
abstractions of Ronald Reagan.

Mr. Reagan and his cronies want
Americans to be in a constant heated furor
over the "terrorism" the Administration claims
has its center in Nicaragua. A claim theyhave
never been able to prove! V

The media encourage this militaristic‘
jingoism through their headline seeking
30-second spots they call the "Evening News."

Yet, every morning when I read the
newspaper, I have to ask myself, where is the
real terrorism for the average American? After
all, when was‘the last time you left to go to
work and came face to face with a member of _
the PLO waiting to hijack your car?

But a very possible situation would be a
confrontation with a mugger, or, if you're a
woman, the increasing violence directed
towards women has to be of major concern.

Just this morning I read of a taxi driver
who was murdered and a woman who was
raped this past weekend - and both from my
immediate area.

Just a couple of weeks ago a 12-year old
disappeared from her home and hasn't been
seen since; a 15-year old was murderednear
her school; and who can overlook Seattle's own
"Green River Killer," responsible for perhaps
42 murders, all unsolved.

After dark my daughter is not allowed
to walk to a friend’s house - my wife or I drive
her not because we fear the phony "terrorism"

Ronald Reagan wants us to think about but Page 52

»T.//////4%

.".:'~'

the streets of America every day and night of
the year. '

The terrorism in our streets is not an
issue Reagan wants to talk about so he has
defined the word his way, hoping to keep
Americans’ attention someplace else - and it's
worked so far. He tells us everything is fine -
"America is back!"

The ability to define what political
issues are is the ability to define the priorities
of politics and where our resources will go.

Reagan’s political definitions insure
our resources (i.e., tax dollars) go to military
adventurism overseas to fight "terrorism"
while our police departments cry out for
additional manpower, our social agencies fail
to do an adequate -job due to cuts in federal

spending, and job training (unemployment is a ‘

clear and direct link to crime) funding has
been butchered .to nothing by this
Administration.

Working men and women are going to
shoulder more and more of the financial and
social costs of the Reagan policy of attempting
to solve every foreign policy question with
more firepower.

It won’t work and in the meantime
terrorism stalks your streets because of
misplaced priorities and the definition of a
word. '

TRUTH   y.
A. D. Winans
San Francisco, CA

the problem is, you say, the truth is too heavy
for most americans to handle

they’ll have trouble accepting it
if it’s not on the 6 o’clock news
and it isn’t

won’t believe it if it’s not in the morning papers
and it wasn’t

won’t believe that mothers in Nicaragua

who lost sons and daughters

could say their deaths were worth the revolution
and they did

young deaths that left mothers minds
to float on birthdays and little toys
-packed in boxes ~
holding the past as still as a photograph

teen age deaths that left mothers with empty hollows
in their iwombs

pits of hot sorrow and day time night mares

in their breasts

the problem is, you say, the truth is too heavy
what is this revolution anyway
how important could it be

when blood in Nicaraguan streets and doorsteps
became the color of victory

and people wake to a country that finally
belonged to them

where they could laugh and sing and work

and love and be free from the dictators raping rule
in a revolutionary reality V

so strong

so important

to build and protect

that these mothers could say to the world

their childrens death was worth it

the problem is not that trutlﬂis too heavy to handle
the problem is
getting the truth

to the american people

FUMO is Latin for "emitting smoke in ancient altars,"

MA is the "basic Mother syllable of Indo-European language,

"YOU GUYS!!!"  
  .....AYE Y1 Y1 

By Joe Hughes
Pittsburgh, PA

I’ve had it! Aren’t you absolutely sick
and tired of hearing this oft used phrase, "you
guys?" Gaaaaawwd, I am! And what could be
worse than to hear its repeated use in a group
of women where there isn’t a male (that's a
guy) in sight!

I’ll tell you what could be worse:
hearing it used by "progressive" (?) women.
That irritates! I don’t know-how much more
of this I can take.

For some time I have been cringing at
‘the sound and slowly boiling thereafter. More
recently, at a meeting of the Merton Center
attended by six staff people (one of them a
"guy"), a guest was making a proposal hoping
for Center participation. The guest was a
woman, speaking to a group almost entirely
female (except for the one "guy") and
repeatedly addressed the group as "you guys,"
i.e., "Wadda you guys think?" "Wadda you ’
guys wanna do?" * etc. ’ *

Aayiiiiiiiiieeeee!!! It's getting to me
folks.

Sooo, I went to the dictionary to look
up "guy." Maybe you want to do the same. I
was surprised to find the following:

, "guy (gi), 11. [after Guy Fawkes (1570-
l606), Eng. conspirator executed for his part in
the Gunpowder Plot, an unsuccessful plan to
blow up Parliament and King James I on Nov.
5, 1605], l. in England, an effigy of Guy
Fawkes displayed and burned on the
anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot. 2. a person
whose appearance or dress is odd. 3. [Slang] a
boy or man; fellow; chap. v.t. [Colloq.], to
make fun of; ridicule; josh; tease." ’

Steelworkers rally to hear Jesse Jackson, Jan. ’85

Naaaaaw. Progressive activists don't
look in the dictionary. They're too busy. you
guys. Aaiiiiiii! There it is again!

Hmmmmmm. Verrry interesting! -Had
I stumbled on something completely revolu-
tionary? Had the perpetrators of this
irritation (the "you guy’crs") known something
I didn’t know all along? Someone who dresses

ONE WEEKEND ON THE FREEWAY‘ mess

  
 
 

A wooden box blocks the middle lane

_ Between cars a coffin with stench of a body.
. . We almost hit it.
 Carved and stained are words in Spanish

I can’t make them out...
"Con Amor...."

The traffic slows. A crowd. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans
read and return to their cars jabbering. We WASPS and Blacks
‘meander and question each other. Car-load after car-load

of families and business folk edge forward covering their
faces. A Spaniard is reading the box and scribbling on a

bag. He stands on a car hood and in spanish speaks . Those
who understand cross themselves with their mouths drawn
The man says to us:

"This is the body of a mother from El Salvador. She was
raped, tortured and shot. But not before witnessing her
children and husband die."

  A wave of translations whispered.
He looks at the paper and reads:

"We, the people of El Salvador, give you this woman’s

body which you destroyed and demand that you force your
president to get your money and troops out of our country!
We send you this gift, with love from El Salvador."

There are many names carved in the box._ The man starts to open it
but mothers scream in protest. A police car stops a long way off
with a dying siren. Three men prop the coffin against a car. The
Spaniard pries open the box. A mutilated body with a scrap of
yellow cloth hanging from where a shoulder should have been lets
go of a satanic cloud. Several people throw up before they

can escape. Women jerk children away.

A write-up appears in a week on the fifth page and the
freeway has been washed clean.

Killed In Action Jan. 2, 1968
Que Son Valley, Vietnam

I am the name on the Wall who received
the greeting from Uncle Sam to become cannon
fodder for the government, under threat of a
jail term. I knew I would die, I told my
mother before I left for Nam that they would
all cry.

I crossed 4 or 5 rivers a day, carried the
radio, walked the point, was sprayed with
chemicals and bullets, rode the choppers,
picked up wounded buddies, met and became
friends with our brave nurses, slept in the mud
and blood, crawled through tall grass that cut
my face and body, watched my best friend get
killed. How bad I felt, I couldn’t explain,
though I tried in 24 letters I wrote by
flashlight to Mom in four months.

Then Westmoreland turned traitor and
betrayed me and my family and my buddies.
was ambushed and did my best to hold off the
enemy until my wounded friends were loaded

on the chopper. When I tried to run for cover,

I was killed. Some of my buddies who I saved
died a week later at Chu Lai.

I was awarded the Bronze Star with V
for Valor. The guys in the hospital wanted me
to have the Silver Star for my bravery. Then
they wanted to make a big thing of giving the
medal to my mother. She refused the
ceremony.

I am the name on the Wall. I will never
walk again or cry. I will never say, "Mom,
your good looking son is home, what’s to eat?"
when I come home from work. I am glad that
some of my friends made it home. You must
fight to make Vietnam "the war to end all
wars." I am the name on the Wall. 1 will never
forget, nor will my mother or brother who
suffered with me, when I was listed as an
M.I.A. Then the closed casket was sent home.

I am a name on the Wall. Westmoreland

THE INVISIBLE HAND REVISITED:
WHO'S IN CHARGEHERE?

By Donald L. Gibbon
Pittsburgh, PA

It was certainly a situation I was
unprepared for, no professional training at
all. But there I was, debating political
economics with the editor of the newspaper
of a major Soviet city. My comments were
motivated by gut feelings, mixed with hesitant
patriotism. Hesitant, because major
misgivings were rising in my mind.

I had been in Donetsk, the major Soviet
steel andcoal town, for five days, and I had
been constantly making comparisons...
because my home town is Pittsburgh, which
used to be the major steel and coal town in
the United States. Why isn't it now? Did
someone decide that the local economy
should no longer have an industrial base?
Or did it ”just happen"? How would things
be different in the Soviet Union? What do
we each gain or lose by our way of doing
things?

The editor and I discussed these
matters at some length. And I mentioned
Adam Smith's concept of the ’’invisible hand,"
by which the sum of private decisions for
individual good will add up to society's best
interest. He quickly countered with some
good Mandst doctrine, and the score tied, we
went on to other subjects.

But I've come back repeatedly to that
question: Why has Pittsburgh's economy
changed? Today, in this and many other
"post industrial" towns in our country,
livelihood is a thing of the past for thousands
and fear stalks the streets. What happened?

Did the "invisible hand" play a part in
Pittsburgh's recent history... and did the
practice follow what the theory had
predicted?

I submit that the theory needs a
corollary: that the sum of private decisions
will add up to public good only if the citizens
understand their own Iong—term self—interest.
Now this may seem obvious... but knowing
isn't doing, not by any means.

What has been the cause of the decline
of steel, and by ineluctable ripples, of almost
every other manufacturing business in the
Pittsburgh area? It has been the sum of
individual decisions, but based on terrible
miscalculations of individual lo ng-term self-
interest! High wages turned the laborer into
the consumer. Not recognizing that

decisions based on price alone, or even on
price and quality, would eventually cut his
own throat, he went out to the marketplace,
and he chose goods produced overseas.
The price was right... at the moment... and
the unexpected but entirely predictable
consequence followed a few months or years
later. The factory. the mill, the store and
office closed. And everyone wondered
why....

So self-interest includes more than
today's price and this month's paycheck. For
private decisions to be made with any real
wisdom, the decision makers must be
educated in the consequences of the sum of
their decisions. It's Garret Hardin's Tragedy

of the Commons writ large across the face
of economic America. Hardin's famous
essay described the situation of medieval
England when all the farmers lived around a
big plot of common land, on which they
grazed their own sheep. It was to each
farmer's advantage (so he would reason) to
add another sheep to his own herd, and so
reap a bigger profit... Until overgrazing
destroyed the livelihood of the whole village.

The past Christmas season was one of
almost overwhelming irony, watching
thousands of shoppers trying to commit
economic suicide, urged on by the best
Madison Avenue can come up with. Short
sightedness is an almost universal disease.
Take for example, the national mania for
video cassette recorders. Ten years ago not
one person in ten thousand owned one;
today they are as common as ten—speed
bikes, or even more so. Ask yourself how
many VCR manufacturers there are in the
United States. The answer, predictably, is
zero. Every single VCR represents U.S. jobs
and money exported to the Orient. And it's
almost the same for those ten—speed bikes...
and radios and sewing machines and small
kitchen appliances, and hundreds of other
things we buy by the millions. What do our
pleasure and convenience cost us? Our
jobs, that's what!

Back to Pittsburgh's economic history:
who's in charge here? Why has the change
taken place? The answer is: no one’s in
charge. There is no coherent policy on
anyone’s part, no effort to head in any
direction as a nation, except for the individual

 

~so'Lone.'Iw:mmé

to make more money. That's the American
way, isn't it?

What's the role of government? In the
Soviet Union, some nameless and faceless
committee has decided that Donetsk's role is
to produce steel, and steel they continue to
produce. What do we gain by our system
with no direction? Or since the question
leads quickly to accusations of un-
Americanism, isn't there some way we could
get some cooperation here, between
government, business, and the consumer, so
we could stop repeatedly shooting ourselves
in the foot?

The wise yeoman farmer of Jefferson's
day, in whom he had so much faith, has
become the Diet Pepsi-drinking suburbanite
who makes hundreds of purchasing
decisions every year. He/she can't control
incompetent managers, but self—control is no
one else’s responsibility. Mr. Yeoman
Farmer/Consumer, there is one simple fact: If
you want that American autoworker to keep
on working, so that his plant will order
supplies from the steel mills, which will order
machine tools, whose manufacturer will order
towels, whose manufacturer will order office
forms... from the office where you work...
then you'll give some serious thought to the
cumulative effect of all those purchases.
There's more than sloganeering to "Buy
American.” The job you save may be your
own.

In the mean time, I'm scared. ls
education a fast enough solution? Or is
there any other way?

PLATOON PATRIOTISM

.My friends are asking me what I think
of Oliver Stone’s new movie, "Platoon," since
they know I was in the war, as a demolitions
technician. Most everyone says the movie
seems very realistic, giving them an
understanding they didn’t have before. They
don’t know the half of it. I

Although I was in the Air Force, the
fighting was so intense, my skills were needed
by the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam
(MACV) to back up the guys on the front
lines. This put me in on the ground close, but
luckily, not so close I couldn’t get in and out
fast. As a demo tech I set up and cleared
explosive ordinance, in addition to being on a
recovery team for downed aircraft. I was in
the same general area, at the same time, as the
movie "Platoon" is framed.

Any of the men who saw the action as
we did will always have an emotional reaction
to simple things like a helicopter flying
overhead. It brings back a rush of memories
of things we’d like to forget. For me like my
friend Ralph who took a 122mm rocket direct
hit in the head, or another friend who took my
seat in a chopper and got hit on the next flight
out. " War is like that. I

We learned to tell the difference in our
sleep from a plane or chopper going out or
limping back, patrols in trouble or just
popping off rounds at shadows. You never get
used to bomb craters everywhere you look, as
in "Platoon" when after the heavy fire fight
enemy bodies are just bulldozed in. These
things were burned into our young minds so
that morning after for Vietnam vets can be
every morning or anyplace.

In the theatre the night I went I saw
several other vets knee-jerking to the action in
the movie, talking unconsciously out loud. My
wife Terry, a nurse at the VA hospital, says
the movie will be hard for many of the vets to
see when it shows in the wards. I don’t care to
see it again myself.

But I told the mother of a vet friend of
mine to see the movie so she would understand
a little of what her son went through. He was

the movie.

Some conservative critics who saw the
movie, like martial artist Chuck Norris, have
said "Platoon" unfavorably presents our
troops, True not everyone had the same
experience in the war, but enough had such a
similar time as in "Platoon" that the Army
basically ceased to function after the Tet
surpriseoffensive in 1968. We were being told
we would be home by Christmas, which was a
gross lie, for political consumption stateside.
The conservatives like to forget at that time
the main U.S. "offensive became aerial .
bombardment on a scale to make World War II
look like a picnic.

Some liberal critics have pointed out
Stone’s lack of perspective on the IndoChinese
people. Somewhere between one and two
million Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians
died in the war from our actions. We only lost
51,132. If our national trauma over the war is
so great how much greater must this be for the
IndoChinese people? Correctly some have ,
pointed out the real movie of this war hasn't
been made yet, showing the total suffering of
the war.

But Stone does accurately portray the
way we approached the war in the 1960s. We
had a mythical theory of containing
Communism at the DMZ in a civil war. It fit
nicely with U.S. history. This kept us from
seeing that the real comparison was that the
Vietnamese were actually fighting their own
war of independence, it was 1776 for them.
We couldn’t see in this war we were the British
colonial occupiers and Ho Chi Minh was their
George Washington. The National Liberation
Front was their Green Mountain boys and the
NVA their Continental ARmy.

Actually our two countries share a lot
of common ground in history, but we, as Stone
correctly shows, only saw the enemy as faceless
fighters: we dehumanized them with racism
easily as dinks, slopes and gooks. In the film,
as in real life, we only saw Americans die in
suffering, the Vietnamese were phantoms.

Our conditioning was thorough but it was not
successful. We lost the war, just like England
lost to us.

Stone captures well at the end of the
movie how patriotic young men came back

medals and dropping out of society. That was
because many of us at some level began to
realize - as the narrative says - that we were
the enemy.

A LAST DRINK

By Lawrence W.G. Oberc
Trenton, NJ

Nick walked into Charlie’s Bar and
Grill. He looked around, shook his head, and
took a seat at the bar. Bart, the bartender, was
cleaning the glasses. A bad sign, that.

"Place looks pretty empty tonight," said
Nick.

A "Well," said Bart. "With what’s going on
and all it's to be expected."

Nick looked at the corner of the room.
A girl was sitting in a chair. She was leaning
back with her eyes open, but it didn’t feel like
she was looking at anything. —

"What’s with her?" asked Nick.

"I don’t know," said Bart. "When the
news came over the TV set she said she wasn’t
going to let them do this to her. She said she’d
rather kill herself. The regulars were here
then. They gave her a rough time. Finally
she broke a beer mug and slashed her wrists.
Everyone straightened up after that. Then
they took of f ." I

"You didn’t try to stop her?" asked
Nick.

"What difference would it have
made?" asked Bart. "She was going to be dead
one way or the other. I figured if she wanted
to go that way instead of the other it was none
of my business."

Nick looked at the girl. This time he
saw a dark puddle on the floor. He looked
back at Bart.

Page 64

"Give me the usual," he said.

"You sure you don’t want something
else?'' asked Bart. "After all, the odds are
against you having a hangover tomorrow."

"Guess you’re right," said Nick. "Give
me a triple shot of whiskey. The best you
got." i '

Bart grabbed a bottle off the wall and
filled a glass. He filled a second glass, looking
at it as itslowly became full. He put both
glasses on the bar. Nick pulled his wallet
out. V

"Don’t worry about it," said Bart. "It’s

A covered."

"Pretty generous for a guy who won’t
have to pay any more bills," said Nick.

"Thanks," said Bart.
Nick picked his glass up and killed half
of his drink. Bart watched, then looked at his

own drink.

"You may as well drink it," said Nick.
"Not even AA is going to save you this time."

"Guess you’re right," said Bart, picking
up his glass.

"How many times did you quit
drinking?" asked Nick. "I, mean in all?"

"I don’t know," answered Bart. "I never
kept count." ~ I

I "Maybe it’s better that way," said Nick.
"I never kept count either."

"You want to know what bothers me the
most?" asked Bart.
"What?" asked Nick.

"I’ve been reading up on this shit. I
was looking at what we did to Japan. Have you
ever seen any pictures of what happened over
there? We screwed those people, man. We
really fucked themover."

Bart then looked at the girl. » It was the
first time he looked at her since Nick had
walked in. Something bothered him about her
being there. He poured another round, hoping
it’d go away.

Page 65

"Who’s fault is it?" asked Nick.
;"You mean this?" asked Bart, his arms
waving around him. '

"Yeah," said Nick. "This, and that," he
said, nodding towards the girl. "How did
everything get so fucked up?"

"It’s"everyone’s f ault," said Bart. "We
tried, but we didn't try hard enough. Now it's
too late to try."

They continued to drink after that.
The whiskey numbed them. After a while
they forgot about the girl. They were on the
edge of forgetting about the bombs when they
arrived.

Abu Dhabl, UAE

I. The Founding of a Shaikhdom

Dinosaur Fossil Arabia is a tiny
Shaikhdom that sits astride the Arabian
Isthmus between the Red Sea and the Arabian
Gulf. Fossil, as the minuscule country is
generally known, was founded in 1973 and as a
result of the dramatic price increases for oil
and coal has become fabulously wealthy.

The events which led to the creation of
the new state would have remained a footnote
to Saudi Arabian history had it not been for
the increases in the price of coal and oil. Back
in the early l960’s when Saudi Arabia and
some of the other oil donor states made their
first attempts at challenging the major oil
companies over the pricing of oil, the Saudis

' became what they thought was fabulously

wealthy just by raising the price of a barrel of
oil to $4. Millions poured in. With so much
money in the till they thought it would be wise
to spend the money to bring their country into
the twentieth century. One of the first tasks
would be to increase the amounts spent for
defense, especially against the hostile Zionist
state to the north.

A giant conglomerate from America
listened to the desires of the Saudis and sold
them on a multi-bi-llion dollar package which.
included the ultra top secret Multi Operational
Laser Exterminator (MOLE) system, a space
age satellite and missile killing laser beam
weapon almost before such products of modern
science existed. The defense system was so
new and so secret the company executive -could
not show the Saudi Anti-Zionism Minister any
plans for the installation. Instead, on the back
of an envelope, the executive sketched out an
outline ofthe Arabian Peninsula and showed
how the secret systems could be most
successfully installed.

Large hills would be needed to install
the laser systems which work on a line of sight
principle. The desert sands were unacceptable
for-the purpose so mud from the sea would
have to be imported to build the hills. The
best way to accomplish the construction would

HISTORY or: DINOSAUR FOSSIL ARABIA

be to build two desalinization plants, one on
either coast and to dredge mud from the sea
bed and then pump it inland to where it was
needed. A ’

A cover story would be needed to keep
the foreign press away from such a large
project. The executive said that innocuous
announcements could be released to the press
that two large pipelines would be constructed

_ across the country to carry desalinated water

to the interior of the country. At the same
time large dredging operations would be
started along either coast under the guise of
shore protection and recreational beach
construction. These types of contracts were
constantly being done in Arabia so no one
would notice a couple more. The dredged mud
from the coasts would be pumped inland to
construct large hills for the installation of the
MOLE systems.

The American executive scratched out
some figures using some rule of thumb
numbers and made an initial,.estimate of about
$18 billion for the MOLE Systems and about
$98 billion for the MOLE hills or a discount
$115 billion for a push button package. The
price would be slightly higher if the Saudis
wanted landscaping for the installations.

The Minister said he would let the
Americans know if they wanted to proceed

with the hill part of the projects but the Saudis A

definitely wantedthe protection the MOLES
would provide.

The Minister was no dummy. He
called in an Asian conglomerate of Japanese
and Koreans (JAPKO) and showed them the
American sketch and rough quantity
calculations but not the American’s prices.
The JAPKO experts huddled together and
after a few minutes working their abacus said
they could do the civil work for the dredging,
pipeline construction, and hill building for the
equivalent of $45 billion. The Minister was
happy he thought of JAPKO - what a bargain
it would ‘be! r

A deal was struck — bows weremade
and limp handshakes exchanged all around.
The Minister instructed JAPKO to start
working; formal contracts and all the details

of this top secret project would be worked out
later, time was "of the essence - start digging.
And JAPKO went to work before the contracts
were signed.

Then came the catastrophic oil embargo’ ‘

which cut off the Saudi source of wealth. The
Anti-Zionism Minister was in favor at the
court and when he spoke the King listened.
The Minister convinced the King the Western
imperialists should be made to suffer by
cutting off their oil supply. It worked for a
few months as the price of oil, gas, coal and
even logs for fireplaces zoomed into the
stratosphere. The Saudis were ecstatic at all
the pain they caused the lackeys of the
Zionists.

' Iran and Nigeria and the North Sea oil
producers reaped huge profits by the scarcity
of hydrocarbons. The other Saudi Ministers

I . watching the foreigners shoveling in their new

wealth told their King the embargo wasn't
working; the oil users were cutting back their
requirement for imported oil. They were A
paying much more for less oil, but the Saudis
had no income. The Ministers realized the
better thing to have done to punish the users
would have been to raise the price. In
hindsight it seemed that the oil users would
buy oil at any price. The erring Minister was
sacked from his post and retired to the Costa
Del Sol to live in perpetual shame and luxury.

Meanwhile someone in the Ministry
discovered that the American Conglomerate,
which by that time had delivered the military
hardware, was also engaged in designing
airports for the hated Z‘lOIllStS..Th§
conglomerate was summarily dismissed and
told never to return; they WCIC b61118
boycotted. Along the sea costs the ‘JAPKO '
construction conglomerate was busily dredging
up the mud and piping it to the desert. No one
told them when or where to stop. ‘T06 D1'0J€Ct
was so top secret no one dared to interfere.

When the Saudis and other oil
producers found there was no upward bound
to what the oil users were willing to pay, they
‘kept raising the price and let the tidal wave

of petrodollars wash away their fear of the
’20th century. The Finance Minister couldn't
write checks fast enough. . -

JAPKO was too polite to make waves.
It just wasn't their place to tell their Saudi
employers they were still working from the
sketch on the back of an envelope. For ten

long years they labored up and down the coast _

for hundreds of miles dredging away at the
beach head and piping the mud inland where
untold great tips were formed, all across the
vast Arabian desert. The Saudis kept sending

the money and the dredgers kept pumping the

mud. At the Anti-Zionist Ministry everyone
forgot about the former Minister and his A
handshake contract. At the Finance Ministry
unlimited amounts of cash were paid out to the
unnamed, top secret military project that
absolutely no one knew anything about.

By 1973 the several hundred thousand
Bedouins thatinhabited the northern part of
Arabia became alarmed at the mountain range
that had gradually appeared to/cut them off
f romthe rest of the country. When the .
reigning Shaikh of the region was told that the
land. on his side of the mountains was
shrinking and‘ that a fast camel could now go
from the Red Sea to the Gulf in less than three

days or a four wheel drive Nissan Patrol in less ‘ '

than three hours, he said enoughwas enough.

The Shaikh declared his independence
from Saudi Arabia and named the new country
in honor of his great great grandfather, Shaikh
Al-Legh, who had discovered. the first
dinosaur fossils in Arabia. The ancestor then
became a celebrated world traveler and .
lecturer throughout the British Empire of the
Victorian age. He became known as the
Dinosaur Fossil Shaikh. His sons adopted the
title as the family name because that’s all they

; had left after the British Museum stole the ‘
fossils under the guise of protecting them from

nature. "After all,"‘the museum representative
said, "the wog just found the things; we are the
ones that made the fossils world famous!" ‘

V The Saudi King was tickled pink when
he learned he now had a mountain range across ”
his northern border and went to examine his
five thousand foot peaks. There was no big
deal in losing a few thousand square miles of
desert when he was now protected behind
mountains. The by now obsolete MOLE

system was duly installed atop the peaks and
the Saudis felt safe for a few more years. So

what if the JAPKO overruns cost the country
$250 billion.

Despite his happiness with his new
mountains the King was still slightly
embarrassed by the secession of part of his
country. Magnanimously he said, "Okay, why
not; there’s no oil there." r. V

Dinosaur Fossil Arabia was duly
admitted to the UN and courted by the big «
powers and the various non-aligned blocs.
Because they had absolutely no income, the
World Bank and Continental Illinois Bank lent
the Fossils billions.. The Shaikh didn’t have an
airport for his new country, and, as we all
know, every destitute country needs an‘

Airport because he needed someplace to land
his new B747. Other than that he wanted to be
left alone so his people could just be
themselves. It was not to be.

As if a sign from heaven, a large
meteorite, estimated to be over a mile in
diameter, fell to earth in the middle of the
Fossil desert, just north of the Saudi mountain
range. Miraculously, no one was injured.

When the army of scientists from ,
around the world came to examine the impact
site they made several important discoveries.
The impact of the meteorite on the Arabian
tectonic plate caused a slight tilt to the plate
with the result that some of the seemingly
inexhaustible oil supply under the Arabian
Gulf was now seeping into the Fossil
substructure. The Fossils now had oil!

What was even more startling was the
discovery that themeteorite was virtually an
inexhaustible 10 billion tons of Steam Grade
coal which gave off a strong essence of nitrous
oxide when heated. In one fell swoop
Dinosaur Fossil Arabia changed from being
one of the poorest nations in the world. to
potentially one of the richest. In just a few
years they would take their place among the
world’s leading exporters of oil, coal and
laughing gas.

UNDER THE D()UBLE EAGLE

The Mill Hunk Herald is teaming up
with two New York based independent
filmmakers to produce a full length

a documentary film, tentatively titled Under the

Double. Eagle: Steelworkers Fighting Plant
Shutdowns. The film will be produced and
co-directed by Michael Montella and Robert
Andre, natives of Youngstown, Ohio.

Tracing the history of mill closings
from Youngstown through the Mon Valley, the
film will dramatize communities fighting for
their survival, and explore alternatives to
factory flight, such as the Tri-State
Conference on Steel's plan for developing a
Steel Valley Authority.

Can unions continue to exist in a
climate of fast moving, international capital?
Is it possible for community owned factories to
succeed, and_are the corporations and the
federal government willing to give them a
chance? But most importantly, can worker -
community cooperation extend beyond one’s
own hometown or workplace? Under the

‘Double Eagle will explore these questions and

offer a new look at the problems facing
workers in industrial American today.

We are seeking support in the form of
donations, contributions, and any archival
material representing the history of the Steel
Valley.

VOICES FROM

Songs From the Road

by Janet Catov Reprinted from DSA newsletter

Question: What do you get when you mix the Wild
Women For Peace-, Anne Feeney and $20,000 worth of
recording equipment in a metal garage in Bedford PA?

Answer: Why, The Great Peace March tape, of course.

What started as a single show at Bloomer’s Restaurant
turned into 3,000 cassette tapes, a file full of friendly let-
ters and a whole lot of fun. “I was prepared to be disap-
pointed,” Anne Feeney remembers about a gig she lined up
for the Wild Women for Peace in September when the
Great Peace March was in Pittsburgh. “Here was a group
of 20 women who were marching along for months without.

seriously preparing their music. The thought of 20 pol_iti-
cal people doing anything together seemed impossible.”

But Anne recognized energy and innovation in their
music. “‘It was contemporary, it was 1980s. It wasn’t
acoustically wimpy like a lot of political music. It was
exciting.” Anne had never done any recording or producing
of her own music, let alone someone else’s, but she felt the
Wild Women were special. Here was a group of women
from everywhere—New Zealand, England, all over the
U.S.——that developed great music as they walked across the
country. They were not the “official” Peace March band so
their music making didn’t excuse them from the normal
Peace March chores like cooking, cleaning and watching
the kids. And, of course, walking. Anne wanted their music
saved. After all, when the March reached Washington the
women would go their separate ways and the Wild Women
for Peace would be history.

So Anne gathered $830 from five friends, lined up a will- ‘

ing recording technician and followed the March to Bed-
ford. The recording session was open to any Marchers who
performed original or traditional music, and from 2 to l l
p.m. on October 2, a garage in Bedford shook with music
and fun. Four days later the tape was at the duplicator and
1,000 tapes were sealed within ten days.

“The Great Peace March: Songs from the Road” is avail-
able for $6.50 (payable to East Hills NOW or the Thomas
Merton Center) c/o Anne Feeney, 202 Dewey St., Pitts-
burgh PA l52 18, (412) 242-9180. Call or write Anne about
using the tape for your own fundraising purposes.

SNOWBALL CAKES

By Janice Miller Potter
Rehoboth, MA

It wasone of those little packages of
twin snowball cakes that took me a long, long
way from now. Lying on a shelf at Almac’s, '
stuffed among junk pastries, it was not
something I would ordinarily pick up these
days. But this time I took one of those '
packages and, with a sense of recognition, held
it in my hand, lightly rolling my thumb over
the cellophane-covered coconut mounds. So
white, soft, and vulnerable if one were to press
very hard. ‘-I lifted the package to my face. It
smelled simply of cellophane. Of nothing.

But then, as I lingered, the scent of
these cakes as I remembered them in childhood

I came to me in a way I had not experienced

since those early years. Damp and musky,
otherworldly somehow. They returned my
father to me. The young black-haired man
who every day took a dinner bucket and went
to work. Went to a place called Leisenring
where men entered a cage and were lowered
deep underground to dig and load coal. I saw
my dad returning, pausing in the doorway of
our house. Still wearing his black safety
helmet with the lamp no longer burning, he
looked down at me from behind a very
blackened face. His jacket was slung over his
shoulder, sodden with coal dust. From his
hardened, black hand hung the dull metal
miner’s bucket.

» "I brought you something," he said with
that slow familiar smile. And knowing what
he meant, I grasped the dinner bucket with
both hands and worked off the tight lid. Then
I lifted out the water compartment - there was
hardly any water left in it. Finally, at the

, bottom of the lunch compartment, beneath

crumpled sandwich papers, I found the
unopened package of snowball cakes. Unlike
any ordinary snowball cakes, they tasted of
darkness and even, mustily, of danger. They
were a ritifal between my father and me. I
wonder now if he sometimes went a little
hungry so that he could bring me these A
wonderful cakeswhich had been deep beneath
the earth. Greedilyl would eat them up,
savoring the chocolate and cream insides.
Essentially the dampness had destroyed
whatever they were meant to be. But, to me,
they were magical gitts.

What is Research? Research is digging facts.
Digging facts is as hard a job as mining coal. It
means blowing them out from underground,
cutting them, picking them, shoveling them,
loading them, pushing them to the surface, .
weighing them, and then turning them loose on ‘
the public for fuel - for light and heat. Facts
make a fire which cannot be put out.

To get coal requires miners. To get
facts requires miners, too - fact miners.

Pa. miner in 1929 .

a IN THE MORNING

There was a time

"coughing like a bastard" came at the end,

a good joke, bad whiskey.

Now, in steel morning, . a
plant steps quake beneath his shivering bulk.
Tiny black bits of dead lung escape in coughing fits
slip to floor in saliva string,

touch carpet in that special silence

after painful noise.

These last years, ' _

coughing begins "all things.

Light.

Air transmitted to lungs

in sidecars of Bushmills,

raw egg and beer chaser. S

Shifting his weight from ass

to feet, Socks makes his way

to the door and out, the morning slanting
razors of light ineeyes thick with blood but full,
brimmed with the blind certainty that leads forever
down the same cobble-stone street

to Superior Steel Mill.

From veiny jowls to stained orange feet

he opens himself like a wound. A

The mill sucks the life from his body .

easily as quarts of beer sucked from paper bags.

It is destiny. Fate.

The American Way.

These thoughts float through his mind
like the shiny ribbons of steel

he hammers into night.

Of these things, he is certain.

a yellow squat

_ that cuffs his shoulders.

He mumbles something to Mary

who mentions it to Joan,

I get in over the phone

and someone tells Karl.

All his motherless children

who want to keep forever their father.
A recliner, someone says, and we
drive Pap to the Lazy-Boy store.

Tries them all,
shaking his head "too much money"
"none of you can afford it." '

The Colonial Manor lady sells us gold,

smiling at little Pap inside the chair,
his head back, feet raised.
Mary signs the saleslip,

Joan picks it up to save $10,

and already he is inside the new glove
content as a bug in a sunflower.

"I don’t deserve it,"

he says happily, '
remembering no other chair that mattered.
The chairs that kept him from us,

in a row, a parade of years

of exhaustion or indifference.

All the tired Saturday mornings ,

and evenings in a kitchen chair

or the old blue horsehair.

The rest then

of the provider,»

the butter-and-eggs truck driver,
harnessed to the silent

spot beside the radiator.

At last his feet tingle

the feet of a man

rocking in his basket of gold .

in his little room

with the patchwork comfort.
