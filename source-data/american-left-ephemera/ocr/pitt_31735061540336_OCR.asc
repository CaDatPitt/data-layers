Paralleling the growth of the trust as a means of holding property
has been the growth of the modern trust company, designed explicitly
to provide fiduciary services for individuals and corporations. How-
ever, thegmajortrust institutions do not use a separate fiduciary for each
,account. Rather, an elaborate system.of nominees has been developed
and, in most studies of share ownership, one makes a careful distinction
between shares held by individual fiduciaries and trust institution fidu-
ciaries or nominees. The main reason for this distinction is that the
bulk of the trust institution fiduciary business is handled by a rather
small number of banks, leading to a considerable concentration of share-
holdings by the trust departments of the major banks. On the other hand,
non-institution_trusts are almost invariably managed by a beneficiary or
an employee of the beneficiary, in which case the degree of concentra-
tion is not so great. i

Shareholdings of nominees

To those not familiar with the nominee system, the complexity of

-- this means of holding stock must appear enormous. Brieﬂy, the system

works as follows: a private citizen opens an account with a trust insti-
tution; once the account has been opened and shares purchased in
various corporations, the registration of the name of the owner on the
list of shareholders of record in these corporations is not that of the
beneficial ‘holder or even the title of the actual trustees. Instead, the
shares will appear under one of several standard names used by the
bank. For example, the following names are in current use by the giant
Bankers Trust Co. of New York: Eddy and Co., Salkeld and Co., Boehm
and Co.“ To the uninitiated examining the list of stockholders of a
large corporation, these names are somewhat mystifying. Yet they pro-
vide a simple, effective means of protecting the indentity of benefi-

‘ ciaries of large trust holdings. Furthermore, this system of nominees

is an effective method of bookkeeping within the trust institution. Cer-
tain trust institutions use a separate nominee for all testamentary trusts,
etc. Some trust institutions have as many as twelve nominee names in
standard use.

In order to appreciate the nominee system we have reproduced in

‘Table III a list of the thirty largest holders of one of the nation’s large

corporations, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company. Perhaps the
only shareholding familiar to most readers is that Cyrus S. Eaton, the
Cleveland financier. Further down the list we find the name Milbank,
& Co., a nominee for members of the Milbank family. These are the
only shareholdings easily identifiable as to the actual beneficiaries. All
the remaining twenty-eight holdings are nominees of various banks
and institutions, and brokers and dealers. Thus, A.A. Welsh and Co.
‘is a nominee for the Cleveland Trust Co.; Sigler and Co. is a nominee
for the Hanover Bank; Shaw and Co. is a nominee for the Morgan-Guar-
anty. Trust Co.; King and Co. is nominee for the First National City
Bank trust affiliate; Atwell and Co. is a nominee for the United States
Trust Co.; Salkeld and Co. is a nominee for the Bankers Trust Co.; and
so on; The ultimate beneficiaries of these holdings and of the holdings
of the various brokers listed are, of course, not revealed.

With this brief description in mind we turn to the holdings of nomi-
nees as shown in Table I. We observe that nominees account for only
0.8 per cent of all shareholdings but, surprisingly, about 9.9 per cent
of common stock. Nominee holdings average about twenty times the
average holding of an individual. Yet this is only the beginning. The
typical trust institution holds stock in about 790 corporations. 15 Since
many of the large institutions use several nominees, a single bank may
be represented by 8,000 shareholdings in our figures. On the other hand,
it is known that only 412 trust institutions had trust assets under ad-
ministration amounting to $10 million or more.16 Therefore, the
213,000 holdings attributed to nominees may only represent several

‘hundred banks. By any measure, this certainly represents an enormous

concentration of shares in so few shareholders. If we accept the figure
of 790 as representative of the average number of corporations in which

the trust institutions hold stock, then the average number of shares per
nominee is an enormous 2,714,000 shares. Since a typical institution
uses more than one nominee, it is clear that a very large concentration

.of. shares reside with the major trust institutions.

_ In order to grasp the full importance of nominee holdings in a spec-
ific corporation, Table IV gives the results of a survey of major trust
institutions and their holdings in certain domestic corporations. Of great-
est interest is the extent of nominee holdings in General Electric Co.,
a corporation generally believed to be widely held. Yet, a minimum of
20 per cent of the stock of G.E. is held by a mere 125 banks. While this
isnot the place for a full discussion of the various methods used to con-
trol corporations,‘ it is important to realize that it is generally con-
sidered that a handful, possibly fifteen, New York banks dominate the
personal trust business. The holding of 20 per cent by 125 banks fails
to convey the full extent of concentration.

(An especially interesting account of the trust business and the im-
portance of the major New York financial houses will be found in Perlo’s
book, Chapter IV--see footnote 2)

In spite of the great importance of personal trust holdings managed
by the giant banks, there is very little public interest in or awareness
of the booming trust business. There is all too little information publicly
available concerning the relative importance of the major trust institu-
tions and, equally important, very little is known of the holdings of spec-
ific institutions in specific corporations. This aura of secrecy is but
another reflection of the common place attitude in the business world
that a man’s business transactions are his own private affair. Even

42

 

government regulatory agencies have great difficulty in penetrating
this great wall of secrecy. To this day there is virtually no information
concerning the identity of most of the beneficiaries of these trusts.

Brokers and dealers

Stockbrokers play a role of considerable importance in the holding
of stocks. Most people make stock transactions through a broker and,
hence, the brokerage house enjoys a unique position as the “middle
man.” While certain firms are closely connected to one or more of the
major banks, many of the very large firms are independent. One of the
biggest, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, F enner and Smith, recruits new busi-
ness in somewhat the same spirit as vacuum cleaner salesmen. Merrill
Lynch handles a very large number of small accounts. In terms of the
average holding registered in the name of a broker, Table I shows that
the average shareholding is only about two—thirds that of the average
nominee. Table IV underscores the importance of the holdings of brokers
and dealers in certain specific corporations. Of great interest is the better
than 41 per cent of the stock of International Telephone and Telegraph
registered in the names of only 296 brokers and dealers.

It must also be realized that since brokers are middle men, they
carry the bulk of the active trading accounts (accounts which attempt
to play the market and “make a killing”). Thus, in terms of long range
interest in a given corporation, the holdings of brokers and dealers ob-
viously rank below the nominees in overall importance.

Institutions and others

In this catchall category we find the holdings of the foundations,
life insurance companies, investment companies, college and university
endowments, mutual savings banks, and corporations. Unfortunately,
the NYSE survey does not give a detailed breakdown of the relative
importance of the various types of institutional investors. But it is clear
that in terms of the size of average stockholding, they rank in import-
ance on a par with the brokers and dealers. A more detailed considera-
tion of these investors will be postponed to a later point.

Now that we have gained some idea of the relative importance of
various classes of shareholders, we move to the pattern of stock owner-
ship at the present time. We turn first to a discussion of the number
and characteristics of shareowners.

Number and characteristics of shareowners

At the end of 1959 there were roughly 13.5 million individual share-.
owners in the United States. This compares with about 1.5 million share-
owners in 1900.17 The bulk of the rapid increase in the number of share-
owners occurred in comparatively recent times. In 1952 only 6.5 million
persons owned stock, while in 1937 perhaps 5 million individuals held
shares. *3 Of greater interest than the number of owners is the pattern
of ownership» among income classes. In particular, we are concerned
with the existence or absence of concentration of ownership. Table

 

V shows the distribution of ownership of common stocks as of the end
of 1959. As noted earlier, about one-fifth of the shareowning families
control nearly one-half of the stock owned directly by individuals.

In spite of the fact that more and more families own stock, there is
overwhelming evidence to indicate that there has been little change in
the historical pattern of marked concentration of ownership of stocks.
As indicated in Table VI, the wealthiest one per cent of the population
has maintained a tight grip on roughly two-thirds of outstanding bene-
ficially held corporate securities.

On its face, Table VI appears to contradict the results shown in Table
V. However, these results refer to different years and, in addition, use
different measures—wealth vs. income. The reader should be cautioned
that wealth and income are not interchangeable. Further, Table V uses
data obtained from interviews and probably represents an understate-
ment of the case.

Robert J. Lampman, Occasional Paper 71, National Bureau of Economic Research,
Inc., New York, 1960, p. 26, (Note that Lampman warns that these figures are very
rough and should be used with caution.)

These facts seem to present us with a dilemma. If, on the one hand,
stock ownership by families has expanded rapidly, and on the other
hand, the very wealthy have maintained their position as regards the
fraction of stock owned, hasn’t stock ownership actually become more
and more concentrated? A careful examination shows that this is not
the case. Even though a fixed percentage of the total population may
have actually increased their ownership of this vital asset, it is clear
that the number of persons classified among the wealthiest one per cent
has also increased at the same rate as the growth of the population. That
is, while the top one per cent as a group has increased its concentra-

44

 

tion, its individual members have not necessarily done so.

Further, there is abundant evidence to show that more of the wealthy
own stock than ever before. This last point deserves further amplifi-
cation. One group of stockholders enjoying an especially rapid expansion
of ownership has been the corporate executives or “top management.”
An extraordinarily well paid group-—median income of 1,674 top execu-
tives of the 834 largest corporations is $73,584 ‘9—these men have
reached the top of the business world. Their major worry, of course,
is taxation and the methods of avoidance. The general public is famil-
iar with the fat expense account, but not as many are aware of the favor-
able stock deals now offered to most executives. This is the device of the
stock option whereby an executive is offered the “option” of purchasing
company shares at a pegged price, usually well below the market value.
A favorable tax ruling in the late 1940’s made the stock option gambit
most lucrative and desirable. Today most major companies issue thou-
sands of shares of stock yearly to officers of their organizations.

As an example of the gain to the buyer, consider the case of Air Re-
duction Co. During 1959 various officers exercised options on 22,643
shares at an aggregate option price of $704,627.2° In December 31,
1959, the market price of Air Reduction Co. stock was $84 per share,
so that the market value of the stock purchased by the Airco officers
was $1,903,012. The rate of return to the executives in question was
better than 150 per cent computed annually.

One effect of such deals has been the expansion of stock ownership
among major executives. Back in 1939 only seven of the officers, ex-
cluding directors, of U.S. Steel Corp. owned common stock in their
company. The aggregate holding of these seven was 3,660 shares, or
0.042 per cent of the outstanding common stock. 21. At the end of 1959,
forty-eight major officers held 207,504 shares. 22 Similarly, in the giant
Westinghouse Electric Corp., only three non-director officers held stock
in 1939 (a total of 31 shares or 0.001 per cent of the total outstanding
common stock) while in 1959 we find that thirty-five major officers held
shares. 23 This pattern holds for many thousands of U.S. corporations
in greater or lesser degree. The average holding of such officers is clear-
ly moderate in size, although much larger than the typical holding of
an individual.

Another group enjoying a rapid expansion of ownership has been the
“professionals.” Doctors, lawyers, engineers, and a whole host of others
have enjoyed the fruits of stock ownership in increasing numbers. In
fact, proportionately more families in which the family head is a pro-
fessional own shares directly than in any other classification.24 Only
in the classification “managerial” do we find larger holdings on the aver-
age. Thus, while professionals tend to be stockholders, their holdings,
on the average, are smaller than those of the managerial class. But of
course the professionals do not enjoy the benefits of stock option plans.

Yet another aspect of this changing pattern is illustrated in Table
VII, which shows the distribution of dividend income as revealed on in-
come tax returns for the years 1928 and 1958. It is important to realize
that dividend income from all sources is included in this tabulation,
whether from trusts, holding companies, or direct holdings. It is clear
that beneficial ownership of stock as exhibited in this table shows evi-
dence of spreading to more of the moderate stockholders. On the other

description of the computational method used.)

hand, one must take into account the fact that a dividend income of
$5,000 represents property worth at least $100,000—certainly a siz-
able shareholding. The number of returns showing dividend income
between $5,000 and $10,000 more than doubled in the thirty-one
year period, while those showing dividend incomes greater than
$100,000 increased by only one-quarter in the same period. More im-
portant, those with smaller dividend incomes (between $5,000 and
$25,000) received a larger fraction of total dividends received in 1958 '
than in 1928 (49.5 per cent in 1958 and 36.6 per cent in 1928). At the
other extreme, those with dividend incomes greater than $100,000 re-
ceived about 31 per cent of dividends paid to these stockholders in 1928,
but only 19.5 per cent in 1958. By any measure, one finds that there
has been some broadening of ownership by the moderately rich.

At the lower end of the income spectrum there is a rapid decline in
the number of families owning stock. In particular, some 94 per cent
of families with incomes below $3,000 own no stock whatsoever; about
92 per cent of families with incomes between $3,000 and $4,999 do not
own stocks; 84 per cent of-families with incomes between $7,500 and
$9,999 do not own stock. Further, the total market value of holdings
of these low income shareowners is about 36 per cent of the total value
of publicly traded common stocks held by individuals, even though more
than 60 per cent of all shareowning families are in this classification. 25
Thus, while there has certainly been some expansion of stock ownership
by families with small incomes, the bulk of low income families do not
hold stock and those that do hold stock have rather small holdings.

In summary, we find that the number of shareowners has expanded
rather rapidly but that the distribution of ownership remains concen-
trated. Further, those enjoying a larger share of ownership, at least to
a significant degree, are those among top management of the great cor-
porate enterprises and the ever-growing middle class.

Financial intermediaries and institutions

The ownership of common stocks by various financial intermediaries
and institutions and corporations is summarized in Table VIII. The
holdings of these financial intermediaries amounts to roughly one-third
of outstanding common stock publicly traded (excluding foundations
and colleges and universities). The most important of all of the financial
intermediaries is revealed to be the trust institution whose holdings
were discussed in earlier sections. The various insurance companies
have relatively smaller holdings while the financial intermediaries not
under trust company administration rank second only to the trust insti-
tutions (this includes non-bank administered trusts, personal holding
companies, and investment trusts).

Sources: a) Based on 1957 figures quoted in Trusts and Estates, Vol. 98, No. 2,

Pension Funds and Common Trust Funds. No allowance has been made for the in-
crease in holdings of personal trust accounts from 1957 to 1958. Thus, the figure is
certainly on the small side. b) The Trust Bulletin, Vol. 39, No. 1, Sept. 1959, “Report

that this figure is on the low side since many banks estimate the value of an account
on a book value (cost when purchased or acquired) basis rather than on a current
market value basis. c) Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin, June

Comment: The figures cited above do not include the holdings of mutual savings
banks, commercial bank direct holdings, holdings of brokers and dealers, holdings
of law firms, and holdings of partnerships. In addition, the figure shown for personal
trust accounts is believed to be on the.liw side, as is the figure for foundations. Fur-
thermore, those figures based on dividends received do not take into account shares
held but not paying dividends. Clearly, the above estimate is well on the low side
and, by my estimate is actually fifteen to twenty billion dollars larger than the figure
shown. That is, the holdings of all but non-financial corporations should total in the
neighborhood of $125 billion while the total holdings of non-financial corporations
should be perhaps one or two billion dollars larger. Thus, the grand total should be
in the neighborhood of $165 billion. I

The investment trusts or investment companies are often referred
to as mutual funds because they pool the resources of many individuals
for common investment.‘ These companies actively seek small accounts
and have enjoyed a rapid growth in the recent boom period of the stock
market. In terms of number of stockholders, the investment companies
rank at the top of the list with such giants as General Electric and Gen-
eral Motors. It is presumed that each investor reaps the benefits of a
balanced portfolio without having to pay the large outlay needed_to

' obtain shares in perhaps a hundred different corporations. However,

the service and sales charges are quite steep if one invests small sums.
For the investment of large sums the charges are relatively smaller. In
fact, a recent tax ruling permitted the exchange of investment company
shares in return for shares of another corporation. Thus, the privilege
accumulates to those owning property. I '
The shareholdings of certain insurance companies are limited by law

to less than two per cent of the outstanding stock of the corporation in 1

which the investment is made. However, most insurance companies have
only recently begun to expand their investment activities in the common
stock field. In fact, several of the larger insurance companies have an-
nounced their intention to buy the legal limit of stocks allowed. As we
shall see, insurance companies number among the largest domestic in-
dustrial corporations. The full importance of such holdings has not been
generally recognized by most students of share ownership.

While we have discussed the role of the trust institutions at an earlier
point, it is fruitful to return for a few words concerning the trusteed
corporate pension funds. These pension funds are currently the largest
single net purchasers of stock on the open market. The rapid growth of
these funds has been the subject of much comment by economists
recently. 25 Inthe five year period from 1955 to 1959, the ownership
of common stocks by trusteed pension funds increased from $4.8 billion
to $12.3 billion. 27 For our purposes, it is important to realize that this
is a field dominated by a relatively small number of financial institutions
—-again the handful of New York banks. A

In conclusion, then, we find that the major financial intermediaries
account directly-for about one-third of publicly traded common stock
and of this totalfroughly half is held by the major trust institutions,

48

 

a field dominated by the major New York banks. One begins to appre-
ciate the term “Wall Street” as a center of financial power.

Part II: control

While we have focused much of our attention on the general features
of stock ownership, we have yet to address ourselves to the problem of
greatest interest in this investigation. Namely, who in particular is in
a position to exercise leadership in a giant corporation and how do such
persons derive their power? In oversimplified terms, who controls the
giant enterprise? Is it a ruthless robber baron still hanging around from
the 19th century? Or is it a well bred and well mannered executive whose
sound judgement is based on a thorough technical familiarity with his
organization and products?

Before we can tackle these questions we need an understanding of
the term “control.” By control we mean the power, whether exercised
or not, to make the major decisions demanded by the mere existence
of the enterprise. More 'than this, we mean the power to direct the af-
fairs of the corporation. It is most important to realize that the normal
day-to-day decision—making involved in operating the firm is not what
we are talking about. We refer to the fundamental decisions, including
the selection of management. Our language suggests a single individual
as a “controller” in a given corporation. Yet we must admit the pos-
sibility that several individuals might jointly share such a position
of power.

Methods of determining control

On the basis of our earlier discussion we can conclude that there
are several possible measures for determining the individual or group
enjoying a controlling position in a corporation. We need to know who
are the directors and officers of the corporations of interest. We also
need to know the extent of their ‘stockholdings as well as the identity
of the largest stockholders; and, finally, we need some information as
to who, among all the persons referred to, makes the kind of decisions
in which we are interested. Of the four pieces of data required, only
the first two can be obtained from publicly accessible sources. Data on
the largest stockholders is all too often scanty or badly out of date.
Finally, systematic information on just who makes what decisions in
specific corporations is available in only a few cases.

Other writers have used additional data also. Most prominently one
finds the use of information on the identity of the stock transfer agent
and the stock registrar in a corporation of interest Another type of data
used is the identity of the banking houses which head bond issues in
securing new capital for a given corporation. Such facts, while certainly
of interest, are generally conceded to be of secondary importance as
compared with data on stock ownership. Therefore, we shall turn our
primary attention to the identification of officers, directors, and
large stockholders.

But why do we use the somewhat vague term “large stockholders?”
Shouldn’t weseek the identity of those stockholders who command a
clear majority of the stock, even though they are, by definition, in the
category “large?” Shown in Table IX is the distribution of shareholdings
by size of shareholding, measured in terms of number of shares held
as of late 1951. More recent data is not available. The table indicates
the distribution in some 1,411 common stock issues of manufacturing
corporations. Included are the common stock issues of many small as
well as many very large corporations. Thus, we indicate numerical aver-
ages even though this is hardly representative of a specific corporation
of interest. We find that, on the average, only 1 18 shareholdings account
for about 57 per cent of the outstanding stock. These 118 holdings aver-
age nearly 5,000 shares each and represent only a little more than.2 per

cent of all shareholdings. The heavy imbalance noted in Part I of the —

study is again evident: a small minority of holdings account for the bulk
of corporate shares.

In the second part of the table we have attempted to indicate how this pattern might
look in an average corporation. Thus we have formed averages by dividing by 1,411
(the number of issues covered) to find an average of 5,2 3_3 shareholdings in our myth-
ical average corporation. Also shown is the fraction of stock represented by. holdings
in each size class. For example, shareholdings of 1,000 shares or more account for
nearly 57% of the outstanding stock in the sample corporations.

We would like, then, to obtain lists, on a corporation by corporation
basis, of, say, the largest 150 shareholdings. Unfortunately, no modern
corporation will part with such a list unless. required to do so by law.
However, in the late.1930’s a government agency, the Temporary
National Economic Committee, did collect data of this sort. The TNEC
compiled lists of the 20 largest shareholdings in each of the 200 largest
non-financial corporations in the land. In addition, the TNEC compiled

porations. In sum, this volume of material represents the most compre- , 

hensive and systematic collection of data of this type currently avail-
able. Unfortunately, the data is now more than 20 years out of date.
Substantial changes have occurred rendering much of the material use-
less. For example, many of the persons listed have disposed of all or
a portion of their holdings while others have died passing only a fraction
of their holdings on to descendents. On the other hand, many individuals
have actually increased their holdings over the years. Therefore, TNEC
data must be avoided or at least used with considerable caution.

Even though lists of the largest stockholdings in specific corpora-
tions are not available, it is possible to collect certain facts. In the case
of corporations with securities listed on stock exchanges one can collect
data on the holdings of officers and directors. In addition, one can collect
data on the holdings of insurance companies and investment companies.
Finally, by scouring the financial pages of many periodicals one can
determine some information not officially available. While the system-
atic information we would like to have cannot be obtained at present,
the situation is far from hopeless.

Holdings of directors and "community of interest"

As a first step in trying to obtain a currently valid picture of control
we have selected the 250 largest industrial corporations for intensive
study. The list of the 250 largest, as ranked by total assets, appeared
in the July, 1960, issue of Fortune. In addition, data on securities owned
was requested from 16 of the largest insurance companies in the United
States. Only Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. refused to supply the re-
quested data stating that it is not the policy of Metropolitan to reveal
lists of securities owned. Data on the holdings of the 18 largest invest-
ment companies in the corporations of interest was also collected. The
method of tabulating the holdings of directors is fully explained in
Appendix II of this article. It was found that useable data could be ob-
tained in the case of 2 32 of the corporations studied.

Table X: Distribution of directors’ holdings by size of holding in.
each of 232 large industrial corporations .

Note: Size class refers to the total per cent of stock held by all directors in a cor-
poration of interest. Thus, in 37 corporations the aggregate holding of directors ex-

51

ceeded 1.0 per cent. The roman numerals I, etc. refer to a ranking of the 250 largest
industrial corporations by size of total assets. We have arbitrarily divided these 250
corporations into five groups according to size of total assets. For example, in quintile
I we include the 50 largest corporations among the250 chosen for study. Of these 50,
data was available for 48. And so on for the other four quintiles. For purposes of tabu-

_ lation we have included among holdings all shares listed in the indicated sources

even though the director may not benefit from the ownership of all such shares. This
point is explained in Appendix II. A special note is required in the case of Ford Motor
Co. In this company directors held only 2.30 per cent of the common stock. However,
three members of the Ford family held 44.8 per cent of class B common stock, which,
as a class, has 40 per cent of the voting power. Based on the number of shares of
each class of common stock outstanding we have assigned 1.7475 vote per class B
share and 1 vote per common share. Using this technique, directors of Ford hold
19.01 per cent of the voting power.

Medians computed by the author from the original arrays.

Sources: See table of “Large stockholdings and directors holdings in major indus-
trial corporations” and Appendix II for the holdings of directors and the sources used.

A considerably compressed view of the results is shown in Table X
which presents the distribution of the aggregate holdings of directors
in the 232 sample corporations expressed as a fraction of the total shares
outstanding. The median holding of directors is 2.20 per cent of the
outstanding stock, In other words in half the corporations studied the
aggregate directors holding is greater than 2.20 per cent of the outstand-
ing stock. Also clearly observed is the well known fact that directors
tend to hold proportionately less stock in the very largest corporations
than in the moderate size corporations. Thus, the median holding in
quintilel is 0.72 per cent and in quintile V is 4.36 per cent. Even though
the median directors holding is small, in no less than 76 corporations
the directors alone hold more than 5.00 per cent of the outstanding
stock. Furthermore, we must realize that the directors holding, taken
alone, is not a valid indicator of concentration. For example, in Tide-
water Oil the directors hold only 0.16 per cent of the outstanding stock
while 65.55 per cent of the stock is held by Mission Corp., Mission De-
velopment Co. and Getty Oil Co., all under the solid control of the Getty
family. Also, in most cases only a fraction of a family’s total holdings
are actually included in the total shown for directors. As a case in point
consider Firestone Tire and Rubber. Four Firestone family members
are directors of the company accounting for 4.43 per cent of the out-
standing stock. Yet, the total holding of the Firestone family is author-
itatively put at 25 per cent of the stock. (The reader should refer to our
table of large stockholdings for verification of these statements.) Simi-
larly, in Swift and Co. we find that H.H. Swift and T.P. Swift held 1.19
per cent of the stock while a private communication to R.A. Gordon
indicated that total Swift family holdings is about 7 per cent. (Again
see our table.) It should be ovbious that data of this type is fully necessary
when we discuss the holdings of directors.

In order to better appreciate the significance of the data we have
shown in Table XI the holdings we presume are represented on the
board of. directors of Phelps Dodge Corp. Phelps Dodge ranks '89th on
our list of 250 largest industrials placing it in the second quintile
of Table X. The direct holdings of the 17 directors totals 85,324 shares

or 0.84 per cent of. the outstanding stock placing it slightly below the
median for corporations in this quintile. In addition, the holding is well
below the median for all 232 corporations. As can be seen we have indi-
cated holdings of several companies in which the Phelps Dodge directors
are prominently involved. Using publicly accessible sources we are easily
able to identify the basis of representation of directors whose aggregate
indirect holdings are in excess of 7.50 per cent. Furthermore, there
is a strong possibility that at least another 7.98 per cent of the stock
is also represented on the board. The holdings which are represented
are held by three insurance companies, two investment companies, and
one industrial company (which has large holdings in several major

53

industrial corporations). In each case the representation is direct in
that a single man is both a director of Phelps Dodge and of the company
holdingthe shares. It is less obvious that other stockholdings are in-

directly represented, i.e., shares held by some insurance companies are »

also actually represented but in this case the holding company and

' Phelps Dodge do not have directors in common. For example, the Insur-

ance Co. of North America holds 20,000 shares and is not-directly
represented. Yet, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. shares a director with
Insurance Co. of North America and does have a representative on the
Phelps Dodge board. 23 This kind of “indirect representation” is actually
quite extensive in the large corporations and certainly reveals the com-
munity of interest concept to be of central importance in understanding
the control of large corporations. While this discussion of Phelps Dodge
Corp. is hardly exhaustive, it is evident that a full understanding of
stock ownership in a given corporation demands that we identify the
holdings of various insurance companies, investment companies, and
other large holders as well as the holdings of directors.

The holding necessary for control

Let us now turn to the problem of just how much stock is required
to control a corporation. Berle and Means assert that control by a minor-
ity interest is obtained only when 15 per cent of the stock (or more) is
held by the group in question 29 Yet, financial analysts and observers,
perhaps closer to the problem than the academic community, assert that
a controlling interest can actually be obtained with a much smaller in-
terest. For example, we find the comment about the Prince family
holding in Armour and Co.:

“In the Prince trust today there are still 320,900 shares out of
5,158,305 outstanding, ample for control in a situation where the rest
of the stock is well dispersed.” 3°

Thus, in the case of Armour and Co., a holding of a little better than
6 per cent is viewed by responsible observers as being ample for control.
And this situation is stated to obtain precisely when most of the holdings
are small which Table X demonstrated was the case in most manufac-
turing corporations with publicly held stock. It should also be pointed
out that the initiative for’ making decisions in Armour and Co. rests
squarely with W.W. Prince, currently scion of the Prince family fortune.
Can we regard, therefore, a holding of 6 per cent as the minimum
necessary for control? Hardly, for thislconclusion may only be valid in
the case of Armour and Co. and, on the other hand, the Prince family
may need only a portion of this 6 per cent holding to retain control.

At this point it is useful to consider a concept mentioned in the dis-
cussion of Phelps Dodge Corp., namely the idea of “community of
interest.” As we have seen many different holdings are often represented
on the board of directors of a given corporation. Representation, whether
direct or indirect, is obviously accorded to groups whose ownership posi-
tion demands some attention. In discussing the fraction of stock needed
for control one financial writer states: “... control on a very slim margin

54

 

can be held through friendship with large stockholders outside the hold-
ing company group,” 31 confirming the conclusion reached in our exam-
ination of Phelps Dodge Corp. As C. Wright Mills’ brilliant work pointed
out, we must think of those in a power position as part of a general frame-
work of interdependent interests: what he prefers to call an elite. We

 shall see in Part’ III that interlocking directorates among the various
corporations studied form an extraordinarily complex network, the
full tabulation of which would fill the pages of a large volume. It seems
obvious that the community of interest concept provides the key to
understanding how a compact minority may enjoy a commanding posi-
tion in a corporation with thousands of shareholdings. It should be noted
in this context that the median holding of the twenty largest owners of
record as a group, in the 92 industrial corporations studied by the TNEC
and included in our study, was 31.86 per cent of the outstanding
common stock.”

. One final bit of evidence regarding the fraction of stock needed for

I control should also be mentioned. In discussing the large holdings of

l the trust departments of the major banks, through the nominee system,
the financial writer A.L. Kraus states:

. “At the same time the larger an institutional investor becomes the
l greater risk it runs that it will assume a controlling position in individual
' companies...To avoid such a situation some banks now place a limita-
l tion on their holdings of a single company’s shares at 5 per cent of the
total outstanding.”-33

l Implicit in this statement is the fact that a holding of five per cent or

more may give a single interest working control irrespective of other

l interests in the large corporation in question (providing, of course, that

’ the 5 per cent position is the largest single interest). Naturally, we do
not contend that the 5 per cent figure is in any sense the “magic
number.” The fraction actually necessary in a specific corporation may
well be larger or smaller depending on circumstances. Nonetheless, the‘
figure does provide a useful yardstick in our study.

The theory of management control

Let us now examine another, wholly different, theory of control:
the Berle theory of management control. In essence this theory rests
on the fact that most large corporations actually have many thousands

| of shareholdings representing ownership. Because their holdings are
I tiny (refer to Table IX), the smaller stockholders rarely attempt to seek
representation on the board of directors of a large corporation. Indeed,
it would require the cooperation of many thousands of such small owners
to obtain a sizable “collective vote” in the selection of directors. Further-
more, the small sums represented in these investments make it unlikely
that the owners will spend the money and the time to attend the annual
shareowners meeting. For example, we find that only 125 stock-
holders attended the March 16, 1960 annual meeting of International
Harvester Co.34 International Harvester had at the end of 1959 about
102,000_ shareholdings of record.35 An article in a leading business

55

 

periodical bemoans such attendence records and cites further
examples:

“The 1960 figures for some other leading annual meetings were:

General Electric, 2114 stockholders present out of 417,053; General

- Motors, just over 3,000 out of 781,970; RCA, 1,600 out of 164,000;

Standard Oil of New Jersey, some 4,500 out of 607,627. There were
many more annual meetings at which scarcely any stockholders turned
out at all.”35

Therefore, the mass of small stockholders who do not attend the annual
meetings have to submit their votes to a proxy committee if they wish
to have their shares voted. And——this is the key point——the proxy
committee, in almost all cases, is selected by management (by which we
mean the executives of the corporation in question). Since the proxy
committee may vote the shares as it sees fit, Berle suggests that this
represents a considerable concentration of power in the hands of
management. Now, most officers of the major corporations do not hold
much stock (in a relative sense) and, thus, if management wishes to
stay in power, may do so by merely selecting directors through the proxy
machinery who will heed their wishes. Therefore, in Berle’s view, owner-
ship has been effectively separated from control. Tending to confirm
Berle’s view is the fact, as we have noted, that in many corporations
the personal holdings of the directors are quite small (Table X showed
that the median holding of directors was only 2.20 per cent). In con-
clusion, then, Berle describes a mechanism which places power not in
the hands ofthe directors, but in the hands of management alone.
Because this view is widely accepted in academic circles we shall con-
sider it carefully.

' To bolster his position, Berle’s initial work in this field classified
200 corporations as to the character of control. Unfortunately, Berle
did not have the useful TNEC data at his disposal and relied heavily on
sources then publicly accessible. In fact, Berle’s work was completed
before it was possible to learn the precise holdings of even the directors
of the corporations studied. Therefore, it is not surprising t_o find that
Berle classifies corporations as under management control whenever
his sources did not supply information to the contrary. For example,
Firestone Tire and Rubber was classified as under management control
though, as we have noted, the Firestone family even today holds 25 per
cent of the stock. More important, Berle failed to recognize the fact,
as we have noted,_that many directors only represent large holdings
(recall the case of Phelps Dodge Corp.). Therefore the TNEC data
helped to overcome the failures of Berle’s work. It is our opinion that
this issue can only be settled today if lists of, say, the largest 150 share-
holdings in each corporation of interest became available to the public.
Clearly, one must regard the theory of management control with some
suspicion until all the evidence is available. However, we do find some
cases in which the management appears to enjoy a dominant position.
For example, G.W. Romney is generally conceded to be in command of
American Motors Corp. and, incidentally, may well emerge as one of
the dominant stockholders in that company by virtue of lucrative
stock options.

56

 

A final word on the theory of management control. One of the
most celebrated examples of this type of control is the case of Chrysler.
Corp. in which the _directors hold only 0.47 per cent of thestock.

'I'..L. Colbert is usually cited as the management representative who

dominates the __Chrysler Corp. pyramid of power. Yet recent events
have shattered this illusory view. Following conflict of interest scandals
in the company W.C. Newberg, Chrysler president, was unceremoniously
dumped and replaced by a new man. But, in addition, Colbert himself,
though chairman of the board of directors, was later removed. Outside
interests named G.H. Love, of M.A. Hanna Co. and Consolidation Coal,
as board chairman. We see that outside directors, representing a variety
of interests, easily unseated the men supposedly maintaining power
through the mechanism of management control. The basis of power of
these interests is not, all too unfortunately, well known.

The tabulation of large holdings

Now that we have examined the more important formal theories
of control in some detail it is appropriate to discuss our data. At the
outset it must be stated that our list of large stockholdings relies com-
pletely on ‘publicly accessible sources and, therefore, is somewhat in-
complete. Moreover, we have listed large stockholdings even when those

‘interests are not directly represented on the board of directors. This is

done in the spirit of illustrating the large position of some of the insti-
tutional investors in the corporations under study. Also, it was not
possible to find the holdings of 73 directors of the 3,190 sought. This
was because no data was on file in the SEC office for these directorships.
It is likely that reports eithershave not been filed or are being used by
members of that agency and are not available. In any case, every effort
to secure these missing reports has been to no avail. The absence of
these reports, however, does not significantly affect our tabulation. The
grounds for this assertion lies in the fact that most of these directors
are officers of the corporations of interest and, in general, we find that

most officer—directors have rather small relative holdings. We believe _

that the reader will agree that the absence of this data does not justify
withholding the data we have collected. In any case, our list of director’s
holdings is therefore an underestimate in a number of corporations.

Another technical point deserves some mention. A number of the
corporations studied have preferred stock with regular voting privileges.
Data on holdings of these preferred shares has been collected in the
same way as data on common stockholdings. But space does not permit
the publication of this data at present time. Equally important from
our point of view is the fact that even in such cases the preferred stock
usually represents only a small fraction of voting power (almost invar-
iably less than 5 per cent of the overall voting power). But in some cases
the holdings of voting preferred stock are quite important. This is be-
cause voting preferred stock enjoys a privileged position often with six
or eight votes per share as contrasted with the one vote per share allotted
to common stock. A case in point serves to illustrate. New York Life
Insurance Co. holds 99,650 shares of American Can C0,, 7 per cent

presented a concise evaluation of one aspect of the answer to this
question in his theory of “accumulation of advantage.” The privileges
which accumulate to those in a position of power, including liberal ex-
pense accounts, profitable stock options, tax advantages to those who
own property (as contrasted with the tax position of those not owning
property), and the like are obvious advantages accruing to the “elite.”
But of equal importance are those business deals, often extremely
lucrative, open only to those enjoying a measure of control in a corpora-
tion. As an example -of some interest, there is the case of Carroll M.
Shanks, now the deposed president of Prudential Life. Mr. Shanks is
also a director of Georgia-Pacific Corp., an important company in the
lumber business. While still president of Prudential, Mr. Shanks en-
gineered a deal involving Georgia-Pacific which, had it not come to
light, would have resulted in a most lucrative personal return. Itis some-
what amusing that the unfavorable publicity directed against Mr. Shanks
in this particular deal resulted directly in his resignation from Pruden-
tial. Brieﬂy, the transaction was the following: Mir. Shanks put up
$100,000 of his own money and borrowed $3,900,000. toward the pur-
chase price of Timber Conservation Co. The remaining $4,400,000 was
advanced by Georgia-Pacific in which, as we have noted, Mxr. Shanks
was a director and in which Prudential holds 89,107 shares or 1.64 per
cent of the stock. While the Prudential holding certainly does not rep-
resent control, under the community of interest concept we must view
this holding as significant and as representing a measure of inﬂuence.
Of great interest is the fact that Georgia-Pacific purchased the Shanks
interest in Timber Conservation Co. the very day of the initial purchase
and, in return, gave Mr. Shanks a cutting contract. Reportedly, the
transaction would have resulted in a tax saving of $400,000 to Mr.
Shanks yielding a full return on his investment plus a handsome profit.”

Clearly, the position of Prudential in Georgia-Pacific had considerable"

inﬂuence in the decision to purchase Timber Conservation Co. While
the violent reaction to this transaction resulted in Mr. Shanks’ demise
from Prudential, as well as the necessity to dispose of the cutting con-
tract, the advantage of an important investment position in a specific
corporation is clear.

More often, control means the ability to redirect a company’s poli-
cies in case the company should cease to be a profitable object of invest-
ment. As a case in point let us consider a recent event involving a
corporation we have not studied. Commercial Solvents Corp. was, for
many years, under the management of J .A. Woods, the firm’s president.
To the investor interested in Commercial Solvents it was apparent by
late 1958 that the company was not ﬂourishing under Woods’ leader-
ship. Whereupon, the Milbank family, the dominant interest took steps

\ to replace Woods with another man. These steps merely involved,in-

forming Woods, through H.H. Helm a director of Commercial» Solvents
and Chairman of Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., that  term
was up. Woods, underestimating the shares the Milbums represented,
was reluctant to surrender without a fight. Upon learning that the Mil-
banks spoke for 30 per cent of the stock, representing personal holdings
as well as some holdings of friends and business associates, .Woods ex-
pressed some surprise and quickly resigned. Though Woods wanted to

Stock ownership and the
control of corporations

by Don Villarejo

Editors’ comment: the editors of New University Thought feel that a
major function of the magazine is to publish original research on aspects
of contemporary American society. The discussion of corporate owner-
ship and control is felt to be particularly important because the large
corporation is one of the primary influences in our society, and because
the prevalent theories, which are only infrequently examined, color
much contemporary social theory and have a heavy bearing on social
policy. This article is the result of more than two years’ research, most
of it spent in extracting primary data from voluminous government
reports and many scattered private sources. The tables present data
unavailable elsewhere in this form. Don Villarejo, one of our editors,
is a graduate student at the University of Chicago.

This report constitutes the formal presentation of a portion of an ex-
tensive research into the operation of the American economy. We have
selected the 250 largest industrial corporations as our sample space
and have attempted to gather information on the specific nature of con-
trol in each case. In particular we seek to examine the various extant
theories of control and weigh the evidence we have found with a view
to determining a working theory of the “control of large corporations.”
Many views are well known in the academic and liberal community in-
cluding Lundberg’s America’s Sixty Families (hardly a formal theory
of control), Berle and Means’ The Modern Corporation and Private
Property, as well as the Madison Avenue“People’s Capitalism”advanced
by representatives of the New York Stock Exchange. While space does
not permit a detailed examination of each of the many possible views,
the more important will be considered in the light of our data.

In Part I we present data designed to shed some light on the general
pattern of stock ownership in America and to equip the reader with
the jargon of the field. In addition, Part I begins to enter into the general
nature of the problem and the type of data involved. This section pro-
vides the basic framework for our discussion. Part II deals more
specifically with the question of control. Here we discuss the theory
of control extensively and present our findings in condensed form;
Finally, Part III discusses the problem of control in connection with
the individuals enjoying a prominent position in the corporations studied.
This is done by examining interlocking directorates, correlating informa-
tion on personal holdings of these directors, and studying the identity
of the individuals—how many are bankers, how many are large stock-
holders, etc. This analysis leads logically to the presentation of a theory

fight to retain his position, another view won the day: “... Woods was
a hired hand who had been well paid. Now a group of owners simply
wanted to dismiss him."39

It is evident that control, in this case passive until management
proved to be incompetent, is often mainly concerned with the proper
operation of the firm. It is for this‘ reason that management often appears
to be in a controlling position in so many of the more successful firms.
Why exercise a controlling. position when management is doing a good

job? The fruits of a large investment are such that a threatfto the invest:.

ment is often the only motivation for those enjoying the dominant posi-
tion to exercise leadership.

In this section of our report we have presented some of our data in
an effort to underscore the hypothesis of control we think is demanded
by the facts. In Part III we shall consider the holdings of directors and
the identity of the individuals in greater "detail with an eye to correlating
the fact of extensive interlocking directorships with the findings sum-
marized in our table of large stockholdings. In addition we shall attempt
to specify precisely the controlling group in each corporation.

Explanatory Note:
The ‘1.41 corporations included in part I are
selected from a total of 232 included in the over-
all study. The basis of selection was the existence
of concentrated ownership to the extent of secur-
ing potential working control in the corporation
in question. This point has been discussed in the
text of the article. It is, of course, possible to
question the listing in this category of about
14 or 15 of those actually included. Nonetheless,
at least 126 corporations must be so classified.
The organization of the table is alphabetical
by name of corporation. In the first column
the name of the relevant stockholder is listed, in
the second column the number of shares held as
ofDec. 31,1959, and in the third column the per
cent of shares outstanding represented by the
indicated holder. Finally, the last column gives
the reference enabling the determination of the
listed holding. Immediately under the name of
each listed corporation the total holding of all
directors of the corporation is listed. In the case
of almost all of the listed corporations, we have
indicated as a sub-heading the few largest

holders among the directors. In all cases we have
listed director’s shareholdings which exceed
0,50% of the total stock outstanding. To illus-
trate, refer to the Aluminum Co. of America’.
The directors of Alcoa hold 2,664,081 shares
representing 12.64’/« of the outstanding stock
as of Dec. 31, 1959. The largest holders among
the directors are R.K. Mellon and R.A. Hunt.

In the reference column we have indicated
the reference by the following technique: if a
date is given, e.g,., 8/ 54, it is the date of the pub—
lished monthly report of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. This reference is for-
mally as follows: Official Summary of Securities
Transactions of Officers and Directors of Listed
Companies, Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, Washington. Thus, in the case of Alcoa,
we have used the report published in the March,
1957 issue of Official... for the holding of A.V.
Davis. As discussed -in Appendix II, we have
always used the most recent (prior to 1/60)
published report of the individual in question.
In some cases, however, there does not exist a
published report of a person’s holdings. In these
cases it has been necessary to examine the SEC
files directly and, when these reports are used,
we have so indicated by placing parentheses
about the report date. For example, the holding
of H.P. Patterson in American Machine and
Foundry was found in SEC files and was for the
report date November, 1959. This is indicated
in our notations as (11/59). The remaining re-
ferences use the alphabet symbols a, b,  thru
vv, ww, xx. The list of references of this type

follows this note.
Finally, we note that holdings of investment

companies in excess of 1.60‘)? of the outstanding
stock of a given corporation are listed as are
similar holdings of insurance companies. This
refers only to investment companies and in-
surance companies in the sample group as in-
dicated in the text. In certain cases, respect for
the truth demands that we include certain other
holdings even though such holdings are not by
officers or directors. If the individual in question
is a former director, now retired, then we have
used the notation (ex.) to indicate ex—director.
In some cases, as that of A.V. Davis in Alcoa,
the individual has been given a title even though
he is no longer on the board. Typical is the title
Honorary Chairman or Honorary Director. In
a few cases it has proved necessary to use old
data, such as TN EC data, in the absence of more
recent information. Such cases are denoted by
the notation (est.) for estimate. The data shown
in these few cases should be used with care as
it is probably subject to some error.

Finally, Appendix III lists the many holding
companies (as distinct from investment com-
panies) appearing on the list of prominent

holders and attempts to show who controls them.
Thus, one has ability to track down the ultimate
source of power in the few cases where holding
companies provide the basis for ultimate control.

of control which takes into account the relationship of the men enjoy-

Part I: Stock ownership

I

In the past few years more and more of the public’s attention has been
directed to the ownership and trading of stocks. There are many reasons
for this development not the least important of which is the expansion
of stock ownership during the great stock market boom of the late fifties.
More recently, the detection of fraud on the market has led to a full
scale investigation of the nation’s major security markets by the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission.

Throughout this period, however, there has been a remarkable
absence of study of the means of controlling corporations and the rela-
tion of this to the fact of expanding stock ownership. There exist, how-
ever, a number of theories attempting to advance an understanding of
the devices used to control corporations. Among these, the most prom-
inent, in terms of general acceptance, is that of A.A. Berle,‘Jr.: “manage-
ment control.” This idea has been fully exploited from the time it was
first introduced in 1932 up to Berle’s recent work Power Without Prop-
erty. Brieﬂy, it is Berle’s position that increasingly the largest corpora-

tions are under the control of management (by which we mean the

individuals primarily responsible for the day to day operations of the
corporation), a group without significant personal stockholdings. We
shall, consider this theory at a later point. Another view pushed before
the public is the theory of “People’s Capitalism,” which in its most de-
veloped form, insists that the ordinary people of the country own, and
therefore control, the great corporate enterprises. G.K. Funston, Pres-
ident of the New York Stock Exchange, primary proponent of this view,
has said:

“As such, the gradual creation of a ‘People’s Capitalism’ is an eco-
nomic landmark without parallel. It has tremendous appeal to the
uncommitted people of the world.’’1

i We shall test this view as a part of this article. Yet another position
is that of the economist Victor Perlo. Perlo asserts that economic insti-
tutions such as the major banks and brokerage firms have come to occupy
a central position controlling the bulk of economic activity? Finally,
there is C. Wright Mills, who holds the position that a new level of de-
.velopment has been reached in modern times. His view is that the old
propertied rich and the new privileged managerial class has evolved
into a more compact group he calls the Corporate Rich.3

While all of these views express portions of the truth, none of them
rely on a systematic study of the major corporations using recent data.
For example, the TNEC data of 19404 provides much of Perlo’s data.
Berle-Nhas also not undertaken a full scale study to support his view;
i.e., he has not studied the position of various stockholders in the cor-
porations of interest in great enough detail. The New York Stock Ex-
change, while publishing data on the number of stockholders, has never
studied even the fraction of stock owned by various income groupings.
Mills relies on the sociologist’s approach. He does not examine the mech-

A note on the treatment of the Rockefeller to m-
ily holdings.-—N0 member of the Rockefeller
clan (current generation) is either a director or
officer of the various Standard Oil companies.
Thus, a search of the SEC Official Summary... is
fruitless. In addition, the secretiveness of major
stockholders, like the various members of the
Rockefeller family, prevents a detailed accounting
of the holdings of the six elders of the clan. How-
ever, we need not give up hope for it is possible
to track down some information, though admit-
tedly incomplete, and try to piece together a

70

consistent picture. Therefore, we have listed
holdings of various Rockefeller family members
in each of the oil companies where holdings are
of importance. The source is the TNEC report as
previously indicated. In addition, we have listed
holdings of the Rockefeller Foundation as of
Dec. 31, 1959. Finally, we lump under the
vague category “Other Rockefeller holdings”
the shares owned by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
and his wife, both since deceased. However, his
second wife is alive and, as we shall see, received
a portion of his holdings. This last procedure will
now be justified.

When John D. Rockefeller, Sr. died his estate
was appraised at only $25,000,000, only a small
fraction of the value of the securities he once
owned. What had happened to his vast holdings?
A newspaper report provides the answer:

“Before the elder Rockefeller died in 1937
at the age of 97, he had transferred most of his
vast estate to his son and to the philanthropic
interests in which both were engaged.” (New
York Times, May 12, 1960, p. 27)

Thus, he managed to escape the estate taxes by
means of gifts before his death. His son, John D.
Rockefeller, Jr. held the vast blocks of stock in
the Standard Oil companies until late 1934 when
he began establishing trusts for his children.
It is of more than passing interest that he re-
duced his holdings at a time when it would have
been necessary for him to report his holdings
under the Securities Exchange Act had he re-
tained ownership of the shares. However, he
retained direct ownership of the bulk of the
shares. In 1940 he established the Rockefeller
Bros. Fund through the gift of securities then
valued at $59,000,000. Many years later, in
1957, his fortune was estimated at between $400
million and $700 million. When he died in 1960
his fortune was appraised at roughly $150 mil-
lion. Again, a newspaper report provides an ex-
planation:

“John D., Jr. had further reduced the size of
his estate by setting up trust funds long before his
death for his six children and twenty-two grand-
children. The children receive the income from

‘ the trusts, and at their deaths, the principal

will go to their children.” (New York Times,
May 20, 1960, p. 1)

Furthermore, the estate which John D., Jr. left
was equally divided between the Rockefeller
Bros. Fund and his widow. The property held
for his widow in trust will be distributed to his
five sons at her death.

Hence, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. had followed
the clever example of his father and had dis-
posed of the largest fraction of his estate before

Explanatory note

Listed in part II are 91 corporations in which
the evidence did not indicate highly concen-
trated holdings by directors or other large
stockholders. This does not imply that centers
of control do not exist in these corporations
but rather that the data collected was incon-

clusive. However, in the case of certain of 
the corporations centers of control are already 7
apparent. For example, the Zellerbach family ~

appears to exercise leadership in Crown Zeller-

bach Corp. even though the holdings of J .D. *
Zellerbach and H.L. Zellerbach account for less

than 2.00% of the stock in this company. The

dominance of the Zellerbach family was firmly ‘
established in the TNEC report. Similarly, in 7

Union Oil of Cal. the Stewart family appears
to dominate. Again, the Gross family of Lock-
heed Aircraft holds a little better than 2.00%
of the stock of that company, at least in so far

as the two Gross family members on the board I

are concerned. Several other cases of this type
will also be noted by the reader. It was felt that
for the sake of completeness a separate appendix
listing corporations in which a lesser degree of
concentration was noted should be added.

Listed above is the name of each corporation 1
together with the holdings of directors (both

number of shares held and shares held as a

fraction of the outstanding stock). In addition, I
the identity of the largest shareholding is listed ;

beneath the name of the corporation with shares
held, etc. The pattern for listing references is
the same as used in Appendix II. It should also
be noted that the largest shareholding is almost

gm.

invariably an investment company or insurance I
company. This largest shareholding may not, in i

fact, be the largest holding but rather is the 1’
largest holding that could be determined from 

publicly available materials.

Appendix I: Discussion of table
VIII and computational method

The raw data for 1928 was available in
the indicated source book and is repro-
duced intact. The 1958 data however,
presented numerous difficulties. In the
first place, the indicated source book
contained only the number of returns in
each dividend income size category and
did not contain data on the fraction of
total dividend income received by all
members of each dividend income class.
Fortunately, the data was presented in
a manner which lent itself to a ready
computation. That is, the number of
returns in each dividend income class
were distributed according to gross in-
come class; In addition, data’ was also
available yielding the total dividend in-
come by all returns in each gross income
class receiving dividends. The model
chart below (copied directly from the
indicated source book) shows the raw
data as available:

Size of Dividend Income
Gross I ncome Class under 3 I 00 5 I °s°2:3d9'
$600 under $1,000 31,060 16,709
$1,000 under $1,500 42,434 22,919
$1,500 under $2,000 33,498 25,931

Naturally, this is only a small portion
of the chart in the source book but it does
convey the nature of the available data,
e.g., 31,060 returns showed dividend in-
come of less than $100 (but larger than
zero dividend income) in the gross in-
come class $600 to $1,000. Using the
given data (including the amount of
dividend income received by all dividend
receiving returns in each gross income
class) it is possible to compute an average
dividend income for each entry of the

chart and then form a sum according to
size of dividend income to obtain the
results under discussion. Since it seems
likely to the author that the assumed
averages for the larger income classes
might be more in dispute than say the
lower income classes (especially in view
of the exhibited degree of concentra-
tion), reproduced below are the com-
puted average dividend incomes for the
dividend income class $100,000 or more
and for gross income classes in excess
of $100,000.

Assumed Average
Gross Income Class Dividend income
$100,000 under $150,000 $1 19,485
$150,000 under $200,000 150,249
$200,000 under $500,000 174,741
$500,000 under $1,000,000 513,934
Above $1,oo'o,ooo' 1,618,223

It is my firm belief that these figures
are conservative if at all in error. This
opinion is based on the fact that the com-
putation was performed in several dif-
ferent ways yielding results varying only
slightly. The totals used are the set in-
dicating the smallest. extent of concen-
tration. In conclusion, it should be noted
that data of the sort discussed in this
appendix were, at one time, normally
published in the Treasury Department’s
Statistics of Income but have not been
published in recent years. One wonders
what information might be revealed if
the Treasury Department were to resume
publication of these data.

Appendix II: The compilation of.
directors holdings

The major source for the holdings of the
more than 3,000 directorships in the

73

sample corporations has been the Official
Summary of Securities Transactions of
Officers and Directors, Securities and
Exchange C ommission, published month-
ly since December, 1935. The method
is actually very simple: one compiles a
list of directors (in our case from Poor’s
Register of Officers and Directors, 1960)
and searches back through old monthly
SEC reports to find the most recent
transaction (in our case prior to Decem-
ber 31, 1959). Unfortunately, the SEC
has changed its publication policy over
the years so that in recent times one is
not always guaranteed the existence of
a published report on each individual.
More precisely, the SEC no longer pub-
lishes socalled “initial reports” (required
when an individual becomes an officer or
‘director for the first time). Thus, we were
unable to find about 450 shareholdings
in the published reports. Fortunately,
one has recourse to the SEC files where
almost all the missing reports were found.
While we have mentioned the reports
we have not indicated how they are so
useful. The report contains, under pres-
ent law, a complete list of securities
owned by the officer or director in the
corporation in question. If the individ-
ual sells or buys shares he must report
the transaction to the SEC together with
his holdings following the transaction.
Thus, by diligent labor it is possible to
piece together the holdings of all of the
directors in a given corporation as of a
known date. And this is most important,
that our data be entirely comparable
from corporation to corporation. For this
reason, December 31, 1959 was chosen
as our target date. Since a few reports
date back as far as the early 1950’s and
1940's it has been necessary to take
careful account of stock dividends and
stock splits. Even for the more recent
report dates such splits must be taken
into account. Thus, all stock splits and
stock dividends subsequent to a given
report date but prior to Dec. 31, 1959
have been taken into account. In the few
cases where it has been necessary to use
1960 reports we have taken into account

74

such events during that year and have, of
course, adjusted the shareholdings ap-
propriately.

It should be noted that the report date
and the publication date are quite dis-
tinct. That is, an individual may report
holdings as of, say, May 1957 during
early 1958. His published report may
then appear in the March 1958 issue of
Official Summary... for a transaction
which took place ten months earlier.
Most often a given monthly issue will
contain reports concerning transactions
during the previous month. Thus, we
find the largest number of reports for
a given month in the Jan. 1960 issue
but valid as of Dec. 1959. The source for
stock splits and stock.dividends has been
Moody’s Dividend Record, Cumulative
Edition.

Shortcomings of the data

The major shortcoming of this type of
data, of course, is that one has no guar-
antee of finding either the largest hold-
ing in a given corporation or the control

block of stock. This is because the officers ,

and directors need not report holdings of
all relatives. Further, in those cases
where the controlling group is indirectly
represented on the board there is no
available information on the overall
holding of the group. Given the aura of
secrecy surrounding the identity of stock-
holders, this comes as no surprise. How-

ever, it is particularly annoying to find . i

that trust holdings of banks in a corpora-
tion need not be reported if a director of
the bank is a director of the corporation
in question. A strict interpretation of the
law, it would seem, would require the
disclosure of this information. As a case

‘ of some interest concerning the existence

of large blocks of stock, consider the
revelations after the death of Howard
Gould: it became known that his estate
contained, among other things, some
300,000 shares of U.S. Steel—certainly
one of the largest blocks of stock in that
giant corporation. Yet, one wonders how
many other blocks of this size exist. The
publicly available data is too scanty to

The other major shortcoming of the
data is the possibility of errors. For ex-
ample, the burden of the reporting re-
sponsibility lies with the reporting indi-
vidual and not the SEC which merely
publishes data. Thus, errors do appear
and are subsequently corrected in later
’volumes of the Official Summary  Of
much greater importance, though, is the
recent policy of the SEC to withhold
publication of certain types of reports.
Thus, if we rely entirely on published
reports it is almost certain that errors
will appear. However, it is important to
have a measure of the magnitude of most
errors. A careful check of widely separ-
ated (timewise) reports revealed no sub-
stantial errors. In fact the only errors
amounted to less than one per cent in
the number of shares held and would
certainly not effect our figures on the
fraction of outstanding shares owned.
In summary, all of the major errors ap-
pear to yield estimates of shares held
on the low side, even though when trust
holdings are listed we do include holdings
of this type under the individual’s name.
This, in spite of the fact that several
persons may benefit from the trust. But
becausewe approach the problem of con-
trol we need to know overall holdings of
a family or group potentially in control
of a corporation. Even in such cases there
is no guarantee that all holdings are
listed. Therefore the holdings shown in
our tabulation are surely not all beneficial
holdings but rather give some idea of the
relative investment position of various
individuals, families or groups.

Appendix III

We list here some eighteen corporations
which must be regarded as “special
cases”. That is, systematic information
of the type shown in our table of large
stockholdings was not obtained. The
reasons together with some information,
are given below.

Domestic Subsidiaries of Foreign Cor-
porations

It was felt that these corporations
should be excluded from study because
we are concerned primarily with the do-
mestic pattern of ownership and control:
Shell Oil (majority of stock owned by
the Royal-Dutch Shell group of com-
panies); Lever Bros. (sub. of Unilever,
the giant British-Dutch chemical con-
cern); J. Seagram and Sons (sub. of
Distillers Corp.-Seagrams, Ltd.)

Stock Controlled by the Attorney
General

General Aniline and Film (stock seized
by the Alien Property custodian at the
beginning of World War II as a result of
the fact that I.G. Farben, the giant Ger-
man cartel, owned the bulk of the stock).

The four corporations listed above
have been excluded from the overall
study entirely. That is, our examination
of interlocking directorates and the like
will not take into account these four
corporations. The remaining fourteen,
however, will be considered on an equal
footing with the 232 corporations in
which it was possible to collect data on
the directors’ holdings.

Corporations Controlled by Domestic
Corporations

Substantially all of the stock of these
two corporations is owned by only three
domestic corporations with whom these
corporations have an especially close
relationship. For all practical purposes
they may be regarded as operating sub-
sidiaries of the parent concern: Chem-
strand (Jointly owned by Monsanto
Chemical and American Viscose);
Western Electric (99.82% of the stock
owned by American Telephone and
Telegraph).

Privately Held

In these corporations no stock is pub-
licly held. All stock is privately owned
and no other individual may purchase
shares in the open market: Norton Co.

75

(Stock held by descendents of the found- '
ing families including J eppson and Hig-.

gins families); Springs Cotton Mills
(Owned by E.W. Springs family.)

Others ‘

In these ten corporations all or a por-
tion of the stock is publicly held but are
not listed on an exchange. Thus, the
shares are traded over-the-counter usually
indicating the fact that much of the stock
is “closely held.” Where information is
available we have indicated the control-
ling group. Since shares in these corpora-
tions are not listed it is not possible to
compile lists of the holdings of directors.

A merican -l‘VIarietta——Hermann family
owns all class B stock equivalent to 21.8%
of the voting power. See M oody’s Indus-
trials, 1960; Anheuser-Busch—Busch

family holds 65% of the outstanding
stock and is clearly in control. See Life,
May 2, 1955;Carnation Co.—More than
50‘/o of the stock held by E.H. Stuart
family,. founders of the company. See
Business Week, Oct. 4, 1947, pp. 96ff.;
Kaiser Steel——Kaiser Industries holds
79.97‘/«I ofthe stock. See Moody’s In-
dustrials, 1960. A majority of the stock
of Kaiser Industries is held by the HJ .
Kaiser family. See our table of large
stockholdings; Eli Lilly—Non-voting class
B stock is publicly held. However, the
common stock, with sole voting power,
is privately held by the Lilly family
among others; Lone Star Steel— Little
precise data is known. ButE.B.. Germany,
president of Lone Star, holds about
1.50% of the stock personally and num-
bers among the five largest holders. See
Business Week, March 29, 1952, p. 66.
Among the institutional investors,
United Funds, Inc. hold 1.30%. See
-Moody’s Bank, and Finance Manual,
1960; McLouth Steel—Until his death,
D.B. McLouth was the largest holder
with 12% (possibly more). Little is now
known; Sherwin Williams—-Largest hold-
er is Cyrus S. Eaton. Other large holders
are not known; Time, Inc.—See Nov.
1960 issue of Fortune for listing of all
holders of more than one per cent of

1' the stock. Included are the Luce family,

Larsen family, and H.P. Davison. Weyer-
haeuser Co.—TNEC data revealed that
the Clapp, Weyerhaeuser, McCormick
and Bell families held the controlling
stock. The same individuals, in several
cases, remain in the leadership of this
company. It may be presumed that their
position in the company has not sub-
stantially changed. However, the Kieck-
hefer family has a large holding resulting
from the merger of Eddy Paper Co. and
Kieckhefer Container Co. into Weyer-
haeuser. The Kieckhefers have repre-
sentation on the board of directors.

Appendix IV

Listed below are 21 holding companies
which play an important role in the con-
trol of some of the corporations under
study. In each case we attempt to identify
the largest stockholding interests. We
have also indicated the corporations in
which the company in question holds
important blocs of stock. The pattern
used in this listing is the same as used
in the table of large holdings in the sample
corporations. Namely, where a date is
indicated we refer to the published
monthly reports of the Official Sum-
mary  mentioned previously. Other
references are noted by letters of the
alphabet with a complete list of these
references given at the end of this ap-
pendix. Finally, we indicate the per
cent of voting common stock held as of
Dec. 31, 1959 as well as the number of
shares held by each of the presumably
important stockholders.

Stock ownership and the control

of corporations: part III

by Don Villarejo

Editors’ comment: We here present part three of a New University
Thought research project by one of the editors of the magazine. Parts
one and two of this study, which appeared in the previous issue, dis-
cussed stock ownership in general and the problem of control. This
material is presented with the view that an analysis of the large corpo—
rations and the individuals prominent in them is necessary for an under-
standing of contemporary American society. Don Villarejo, author of
“American investment in Cuba” which appeared in the first issue of
New University Thought, is a graduate student in physics.

In.Parts I and II of this study we placed heavy emphasis on the identi-
fication of large stockholdings in a group of major corporations. We
were interested in the distribution of stock ownership in general as well
as in the 232 industrial corporations chosen for detailed study. The

‘ major’ results were summarized in tabular form and presented together

iwitlithe body of our report. In Part III of this study we shall be concerned

3‘ witlftlie individuals who hold these shares as well as with certain key

figures in? the economic power structure. More precisely we shall study
the characteristics of the directors of these corporations. In addition, we
‘shall expand the concept of “community of interest” as first stated in
"Part III of this study to include phenomena other than mere individual
pecuniary interests.
’At'the' outset certain technical points need mention. First, we shall
refer to the 232 corporations chosen for study as the sample corporations.
The interested reader is referred to Appendices I and II of Part II of

this” article.‘ Second, an individual has been regarded as a director of a

sample corporation if he was a director on December 31, 1959.2 Thus, in
keeping with the method of Parts I and II of this article we seek data
valid as of a known date for each of the sample corporations. This is
especially important when dealing with individuals serving as directors

‘of corporations because of the rather large turnover of directors (due

primarily to deaths, retirements and the like). Third, when we refer to
an individual’s shareholding or the market value of his holding we mean
data valid as of December 31, 1959.

The board of directors

As we have indicated in Part I of this study, the corporate board is
elected by the shareowners of the corporation. In theory, the board
selects the management which in turn operates the company. Thus,

47

the corporate boardisthe key instrument of the corporate power structure,
for it is the board that bridges the gap between those who own property
and those who operate it. As such, it is hardly surprising to find many
substantial property holders serving on the corporate board. But are
property owners the only ones who serve as directors? Actually not, as
we shall see. In addition to property owners, we find lawyers, com-
mercial bankers, investment bankers, insurance company executives,
educators, corporate executives and many others serving on the boards
of the sample corporations (we even find a sprinkling of retired generals
and admirals as well as the former president of the Farm Bureau Feder-
ation). In order to grasp the complexities of the corporate power structure
let us turn to an examination of these various types.

1. Propertied Rich: In this category we find those directors with a
large and continuing stockholding in one or more of the sample corpo-
rations. By “large and continuing" we mean inherited or otherwise ac-
quired holdings which grant the owner a measure of control. Specifically
excluded are persons employed bythe corporation in executive capacities
who have acquired large holdings during the period of their employment.
In Part II_we encountered an example par excellence of what we mean
by “propertied rich,” namely Richard K. Mellon, whose holdings in the
sample corporations exceeds $425 million. Another example is William
du Pont, Jr. who owns 1,269,488 shares of E.I. du Pont de Nemours
andC o. with a market value of $335 million.3 We also include as proper-
tied rich those members of wealthy families serving as directors though
their personal holdings may be comparatively small. A good example is
provided by P. S. du Pont, III, whose holdings in du Pont amount to
only 3,864 shares (market value of a little over $1 million). 4 I

A second category of propertied rich is that of directors without

enormous holdings in the sample corporations but who have large

holdings in other corporations. An example of this type is furnished by
Allan P. Kirby who is a director of International Telephone and Tele-
graph Corp. and who owns 38,783 shares of IT&T (market value $1.5
million). However, Mr. Kirby also owns 300,100 shares of the New York
Central Railroad Co., some 363,185 shares of F.W. Woolworth Co. and
more than 1,000,000 shares of the Allegheny Corp. In sum his holdings
are worth nearly $300 million.5 Clearly, such persons number among
the propertied rich though the bulk of their holdings are not in the
sample corporations. ‘ '

It is evident that those who enjoy a position among the propertied
rich serve as directors in the sample corporations as a direct consequence
of their ownership of property. In fact, many of these directors are de-
cendents of the persons who launched these great enterprises and they
continue, as a result of their inherited wealth,to represent their families’

interests. It is no surprise, therefore, to find F irestones, Fords, Mellons, A

du Ponts, Rockefellers, Dows, Heinzes and the like in this group.

2. Investment Bankers: The individuals termed investment bankers
are those directors who are partners in one or another of many investment
banking houses which raise new capital for the giant enterprises. We
include brokers and dealers in this category as well. A typical case of an
investment banker is provided by C.B. Harding, a senior partner in the

48

 

anism of control in specific corporations. Another economist, R.A.
Gordon, has explored this question in some detail but, again, relies
heavily on the now outdated TNEC data. 5

It seems appropriate, therefore, to re—examine the available data
in order to obtain an understanding appropriate to the present Atiime.
But before turning to this question in detail, it is necessary to have a
firm grasp of the general characteristics of stock ownership as well as
the various devices used to» hold stock.

The corporation

Corporations own roughly two-thirds of America’s national wealth.
The complete dominance of the corporate form is familiar to all of us.
General Motors, U.S. Steel, General Electric, Standard Oil,—and a whole
host of other names are a part of our common understanding, yet they
can not be found in the dictionary. A little less familiar is the extent
of concentration of size among American corporations. In commenting
on the fact that roughly 500 domestic corporations control about two-
thirds of the non-farm economy, A.A. Berle, Jr. stated:

“This is, I think, the highest concentration of economic power in
recorded history. Since the United States carries on not quite half of
the manufacturing production of the entire world today, these 500
groupings~—each with its own little dominating pyramid within it——
represent a concentration of power over economics which makes the
medieval feudal system look like a Sunday School party. In sheer eco—
nomic power this has gone farsbeyond anything we have yet seen.” 5

It is our intention to examine some of these “little dominating pyramids”
at a later point.

In theory, the corporate form is a device for pooling the resources
of a large number of investors or, alternatively, it is a means of concen-
trating the ownership of property. Each of the many investors owns a
portion of the enterprise and receives stock certificates as evidence of
this fact. The stockowner enjoys the various rights accruing to investors
including the right to participate in the election of directors. Stock cer—
tificates, or “stocks” as they are known, may be purchased or sold.
Ordinarily, the market place for the sale of stocks is the stock exchange.
The stock exchanges have grown at roughly the same pace as the corpor-
ate form. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, was founded
in 1792.

In practice, the modern corporation rarely raises new funds by
turning to the large number of small investors through the issuance of
more stock. Consequently, the ownership and exchange of stocks has
tended to become a more speculative activity. This type of activity, of
course, attracts the crooks and fast buck operators as evidenced by the
frenzy of speculative activity prior to the great stock market crash of
1929. The recent boom in the stock market has again brought the spec-
ulators to the fore. In fact, the large scale investigation of the stock
markets to be undertaken by the SEC was triggered recently by the
activity of some unscrupulous stockbrokers. This fact of growing spec-
ulative activity has had important effects on the various devices used
to hold stock, as we shall see at a later point: A

35 

well known firm Smith, Barney and Co. Mr. Harding is also a director
of both Cerro de Pasco Corp. and Scott Paper Co.

An investment banker may serve as a corporate director in one of
several capacities. First, he may represent substantial holdings by the
banking firm itself, by one of the firm’s other partners, or by clients.

' Second, and more often,he represents the firm’s connection to the money

market. That is, the banker may represent a firm that handles all stock
and bond offerings when the corporation in question needs new capital.
A third, and much less obvious function is closely related to the first: a
banker may represent financial interests with important stakes in the
corporation which he serves as a director. An example of this type
follows. In discussing the recent management changes at Studebaker-
Packard Corp., Fortune magazine commented in passing:

“In the reorganization, H arold C hurchill, a long-time Studebaker
engineer who had been president under Hurley, became chief executive,
though the real control was now in the hands of the New York bankers.” 5

If we examine the board of directors of Studebaker-Packard we find that
,1 . R. Forgan of Glore, Forgan and Co. and F.J. Manheim of Lehman
Bros.‘ serve as representatives of these controlling interests.

3. Commercial Bankers: In this category we find officers of the
nation’s great commercial banking houses. Commercial bankers are
found on corporate boards less frequently than are investment bankers.
A case of this type is provided by H.C. Alexander, Chairman of the
Board of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and a director of the following
corporations in the sample group: American Viscose, General Motors,
J ohns-Manville, Standard Brands.

While commercial bankers are often preoccuppied with deposits
(note that a giant industrial corporation means millions of dollars in
deposits for some commercial bank), many commercial bankers serve as
corporate directors in their role as fiduciaries. That is, since the trust
departments of these giant banks act as trustees for $66 billion worth of
common stock, the banker actually represents a large stockholding over
which he is bound to be concerned.7

4. Lawyers: In this category we find the partners of the handful of
law firms which handle the legal matters of many of the large corpora-
tions. Also we find more “independent” lawyers, i.e., those not connected
to one of the large law firms. Deliberately excluded are “inside” lawyers,
i.e., those who are essentially employees of the corporation. An example
of the first type is provided by D.B. Steimle, a partner in the law firm
Shearman and Sterling and Wright. Mr. Steimle is a director of Air
ReductionCo. and his firm is general counsel for that corporation. Thus,
the corporation lawyer brings his special skills to the corporate board
just as the investment banker brings his.

Another category of lawyers is provided by those who serve as trustees
of large estates. Thus, C.M. Robertson, a director ofJ .1. Case (and also a
member of the Case board’s executive committee) serves as trustee for
several estates, amongthem the following: Estate of C harles L. McIntosh,
Estate of Anne Hamilton McIntosh, Estate of H.A.J . Upham, and others.

In this capacity, the lawyer is representing;_property.. A . » -,   .

5. Insurance Company Exemitives: These are officers of the major
life and property insurance companies.’ Since the giant insurance compa-
nies not only hold common andipreferred stock" of many of the sample

corporations, but also hold-large portions of the bond issues of these
same enterprises, it is hardly a surprise to find their executive officers .

among the directors. Furthermore, it appears as though insurance
companies (with millions to -invest -every week of the year) are rapidly
increasing their holdings of common stock in many corporations. . ii

To grasp the indebtednessof certain "corporations to the giant in-

surance companies wemay take theiexample of the Prudential Insurance 0
Company of America" which holds, among its more than $5 billion in '
industrial bonds‘, notes for $126‘ —million and $150 -million from the Olinl I
Mathieson Chemical Corp‘. and Union Carbide Corp. respectively. S—imul- -7

taneously. We note that ‘C  Shanks,1Pi-esident?o'f*the Prudential, holds

this category we have those proifessional executives who’, while directors A
of one or more of the sample corporations, a_re.also_ex_ecut_ive officers. of ,_
one of the major non-financial corporations not included_ in our sample’. '0

Thus, F.C. Brown, President of ScheringIC'o'rp.',: isa‘ director" of "ACF
Industries. The function of such executives on the boards of sample
corporations is not at all clear. It is significant, however, that we find

cases of important suppliers having representati_orr _on __t_he__ybAo._ar_ds pf,

their purchasers and vice versa.

current interest to the corporation.

9. Former Officers: Included are retired executives of the sample
corporations as well as a handful of persons from non-sample corpora-
tions. Often, their directorships are a kind of token honor for concluded

careers with the company. In other cases they undoubtedly provide

counsel either to management or to the board.

10. Miscellaneous: We find here all those who cannot be placed in
any of the preceding categories. In particular, we find educators such as
F.L. Hovde, President of Purdue University and a director of both
General Electric and Inland Steel; we find retired army officers such as
General Douglas MacArthur who is Chairman of the Board of Sperry
Rand; we find public relations experts such as Stanley Resor who is a
director of Scott Paper and also chairman of J. Walter Thompson. While
certain of these types have special functions in respect to the ordinary
activities of the corporation, some are simply directors because of their
contacts (Who in the Pentagon would turn away from a retired general
who comes to promote the latest in military hardware?) or because of
their prestige value.

However, a separate group deserves special mention and attention.
These are the persons who while not large property owners themselves,
merely represent the holdings of certain individuals or families. An
example is in order: J .M. Kingsley is the president of Bessemer Securi-
ties Corp. To the ordinary citizen, this organization might appear to be
some kind of corporation specializing in investments. He is quite correct,
but he is off" target. In fact this company is the literal nerve center of
one of this nation.’s major family fortunes: Bessemer Securities Corp. is
a private holding company for the Phipps fortune. Owning property
worth $300 million, the company is popularly known as the “office”
among members‘ of the clan. The “office” handles all family finances for
the seventeen separate families of the current Phipps generation. If a
familyimember wants to buy a yacht, he has the office write out a check
and handle the details. More important, the office is actually a network
of more than "seventy-five enterprises designed to take advantage of
every possible tax loophole. Moreover, the stock of Bessemer Securities
is held in trust by another Phipps family agency, the Bessemer Trust Co.
In the words of Fortune:

“The corporate structure of Bessemer Securities was complicated in
the extreme, embracing seventy-six or more subsidiary enterprises organ-
ized for tax purposes or special projects, but in essence it was the money
machine for Bessemer Trust Co., the family trust. ”3

Such are the measures taken to preserve property intact through the
generations of propertied rich.

Analysis of directors

Now that we have a firm idea of the types of individuals serving as
directors of the sample corporations as well as an understanding of their

51

 

functions on the board, we turn to an analysis of the 2,784 individuals
who occupy directorships in these companies.-Presented in Table I is
the distribution of these individuals according to the categories outlined

Explanatory note: As previously indicated we have included only individuals
who were directors of the sample corporations on December 31, 1959. In making
the classification indicated we have used the annual reports of the corporations
as well as Standard and Poor’s Register of Officers and Directors, 1960 and Who’s
Who in Commerce and Industry, various years. The last category, “undertermined”,
represenw the 100 persons for whom it was impossible to find sufficient biograph-
ical data to permit classification. Also, if there seemed to be any ambiguity of
classification we placed the individual in this category.

Perhaps the most obvious feature of this distribution is the rather
large number of active and retired executives. Indeed more than one-
half of all persons were of one of these two types. This is a reflection of
the professionalization of management, a subject which has been the
topic of much discussion in recent years. As industrial corporations grew
and developed in complexity, more skilled persons were required to keep
affairs running smoothly. Moreover, the rapid technological develop-
ments of this century have placed greater demands on the management
of large concerns. Decisions based on technical understanding became
more frequent and the demands on management increased in direct
proportion. Thus, a very large fraction of these executives rose through
the ranks as specialists of one sort or another. Of course, there are quite
a few old—fashioned bureaucrats in this group as well. Nonetheless, it
seems apparent, to the author at least, that this trend to professionaliza-
tion will continue, particularly as automation takes hold.

No less important than the executives, and perhaps more important,
we find that nearly one-fifth of the sample group are members of the
propertied rich. That is, those who hold large blocks of stock in many
of the sample corporations participate actively in the formulation of
basic policy. Of the 520 in this category, no less than 197 also serve as

executives of the corporations in which their interests are located (we'

include chairman of the board in this category). Thus, in our sample,
roughly two-fifths of the propertied rich participate as management in

52

 

addition to being directors of the given corporation. At this point we
should also note that exactly 50 of this group are persons whose property
holdings are in corporations not in the sample group. Thus, the fraction
of propertied rich who actively participate in management is actually
somewhat larger than 40 percent. . l

A fact of equal interest is that 376 directors are genuine “outsiders”
in that they represent established centers of interest outside the sample
group. We refer to various bankers, lawyers and insurance company ex—
ecutives who bring special skills to the board or represent large in-
vestments. At this juncture we also note that 21 persons in the
miscellaneous category are simply representatives of large individual
property holders. With this in mind let us turn to an examination of the
market value of holdings of the directors. The basic data is summarized
in Table II. ’

Category of Director

 

Note: Shown are the number of persons with reported holdings in the indicated
market value size class distributed by the category in which we have classified the
director. No usable market value data could be found for 58 ‘individuals of the sample
group. Further, we have not shown the 100 persons not classified in the indicated
categories (called “undetermined” in Table I). The key to the category symbols
follows: 1 - Propertied Rich; 2 - Lawyers; 3 - Investment Bankers; 4 - Commercial
Bankers; 5 - Insurance Co. Executives; 6 - Local Businessmen; 7 - Miscellaneous; -
8 - Former Officers; 9 - Corporation Executives (CS); 10 — Corporation Executives

(CNS).

From the table we immediately see certain facts. First, 99 of the 103
persons with holdings in excess of $10 million in the corporations in
which they are directors, are in the category propertied rich. This state-
ment is nothing more than an expression of the fact that the propertied
rich are rich indeed. Further, we observe that in all categories other
than propertied rich, the distribution of holdings is sharply peaked at
the lower end of the market value spectrum, that is, in these other cate-
gories the individuals have rather small holdings (though a holding of
$100,000 must be considered large by any measure). Further, we find
that these 99 propertied rich, each with holdings in excess of $10 mil-
lion, own $5,173 billion worth of stock as compared with $7,128 billion
for all 2,784 di1:ectors.9 Thus, these 99 hold 72.56%of the total value
of stock held by all directors. That this represents an enormous concen-
tration of holdings should be obvious to all. But, further, if we take into

53

 

account the holdings identified in Part II of this study which include
shares owned by other non—director family members, trusts not included
in the directors’ totals and stock held by these directors in sample corpo-
rations in which they are not directors, then we find an additional $7,309
billion held by the propertied rich. In sum, this total of $14,437 billion
for all directors represents 6.1 1' Q of all the outstanding common stock of
all 232 sample corporations. Of this total a little over $13 billion repre-
sents holdings of the propertied rich alone. Moreover, if we now take
into account the enormous amount of stock in certain holding companies,
as well as stock held in bank—administered trusts that we were able to
identify and, finally, stock held by sample corporations where the con-
trolling interest is apparent, the sum reaches nearly 12'); of the out-
standing market value of common stock in our sample. This excludes
the holdings of the insurance companies, investment companies (open-
end), and the great bulk of the shares in bank—administered trusts and
estates. The total figure is of course one of the great “unknowable”
statistics in this field of inquiry. But the fact that such a large fraction
of stock is so readily identifiable forces one to wonder just how much
other stock is in the hands of the proportied rich, or controlled by them.

Because of the importance of the 99 very rich, we have included an
appendix listing the holdings of these persons at the end of the body of
this article.

In conclusion, then, we find various types of directors holding po-
sitions on the boards of the sample corporations. Thle majority of these
persons are professional executives, but the propertied rich control the
bulk of stock held by directors. F.urther, we find that a rather large
fraction of the outstanding common stock of these corporations is con-
trolled by those we term propertied rich.

Interlocking directorates

In Part II of this study we mentioned the phenomenon of interlocking
directorates but postponed discussion of this important aspect of the
inquiry. It is appropriate to take up this subject here.

“Interlocking directors” simply means that a single person holds
directorships in two or more of the sample corporations. We must also
take into account the presence of bankers and insurance company ex-
ecutives on the boards of the sample corporations, but for the present
we shall limit ourselves to interlocks among the sample corporations
and between sample corporations and financial corporations. This ma-
terial could be presented in several ways. First, we might simply enumer-
ate the various interlocks we find. However, thelmere enumeration of
this data would certainly fill the pages of this magazine, and then some.
As a workable, andcertainlymoreinteresting alternative we shall confine
ourselves to comments on some general features of interlocking directo-
rates and then study a few simple cases in some detail.

First, we observe that the 3,196 directorships in the sample corpo-
rations are held by only 2,784 persons. Hence, a number of persons
hold two or more seats in the sample corporations. More precisely, 303
individuals so interlocked hold 712 seats on these corporate boards. Of

54

these, 221 hold two seats, 56 hold three seats and the remaining 23 hold
four or more seats. But the really interesting result is that 65 of the inter-

 

locked persons are among the propertied rich, 79 among the corporate

executives (CS) and 53 are among the groups of investment and com-
mercial bankers and insurance company.‘ executives. Together, the
propertied rich and financial interests account for more than one-third
of interlocked individuals. A ‘result of even greater importance is the
fact that31.86'/'9 of the individuals considered (we now refer to all 2,784
directors) are somehow interlocked with one or more banks, insurance
companies, investment companies (both closed and open-end variety). In
other words, nearly one-third of the total number of individuals serving
as directors in the sample corporations are in personal contact either
with banking interests or with those interests representing large holdings.

Let us now consider a few examples in some greater detail and at-
tempt to shed further light on why interlocks occur. A first example is
that ofJ .H. Phipps who holds directorships in W.R. Grace and Co. and
Ingersoll-Rand C orp. In this case, Mr. Phipps is representing large family
holdings in both corporations. Moreover, the Phipps family’ is inter-
married with the Grace family so that we find J .P. Grace, a director and
president of W.R. Grace and Co., on the board of Ingersoll-Rand and, in
fact holding a large bloc of stock in both corporations. While inter-
marriage brings a new dimension to the discussion, we observe that
these persons represent ‘ overlapping family financial interests, and
this is the basis on which they hold several directorships in the sample
corporations. -

An equally significant example is provided by William Ewing, a
general "partner of the investment banking firm Morgan, Stanley and
Co. Mr. Ewing is a director ofAmerican Can Co., American Viscose Co.
andJ . I. Case Co. All three companies are generally regarded as being
allied with the so-called Morgan interests (a group centered about the
financial and industrial enterprises built by J .P. Morgan). Morgan,
Stanley and Co. was created in the early 1930’s representing the Morgan
solution to the new lawsdivorcing investment banking from commercial
banking. This divorcerﬁent decree was pushed through by the new deal
as a direct consequence of the great market crash of 1929. The Morgans’
response was to divide their forces between J .P. Morgan and Co., the
commercial bank (since merged with Guaranty Trust Co., another com-
mercial bank in the Morgan group), and Morgan, Stanley which was to
be ‘the investment bank.  Morgan is a general partner in Morgan,
Stanley and Co. while the other descendent in this generation, J .S.
Morgan serves as a director of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. The presence
of Mr. Ewing on the boards‘of American Can, Viscose, and Case is a
reflection of the continuing Morgan interest in these enterprises. At
this point we note with some interest that J .S. Morgan serves as a di-
rector of American Can’s major rival, the Continental Can Co.

Let us now consider the connections of a specific corporation in de-
tail. In particular we study the giant General Electric Co.’s relationship
to_major financial institutions. In Table III are listed the directors of
GE together with some of their directorships in ﬁnancial corporations.

Aside from the fact that the GE board of directors is graced by two
former secretaries of major government bureaucracies (McEIroy is a
former Secretary of Defense, Stevens a former Secretary of the Army),
we see that certain financial interests have considerable representation
on the top levels. Two directors of Morgan Guaranty Trust, two directors
of Bankers Trust Co., a partner in the firm Morgan, Stanley and C0,,
give the Morgan interests ﬁve seats. If we also recognize the fact that
the Stevens family of J .P. Stevens and Co. is closely allied with the
Morgan group, then the Morgan group enjoys one—third of GE seats.
Since this giant corporation was launched by J .P. Morgan himself, it is
not surprising to ﬁnd that his interests still have considerable repre-
sentation.

In addition, investment companies, other banks and life insurance
companies are interlocked with the GE board. If we recall from Part I
of this study that more than 2 ‘,2? of GE common stock is held in the
trust departments of major banks, then the fact that so many directors
of that corporation are connected with these financial institutions comes
as no real surprise.“

Let us now turn to a case that seems to be quite different. As we have
noted, the Rockefeller family continues to hold large blocs of stock in

W.-..,«..w.u.-:.«m..w..,.......... . . . .................._...,_......._....._.. ... 

the Standard Oil companies. But no member of the family serves as a
director of any of these companies. However, David Rockefeller serves
as vice-chairman of the giant Chase Manhattan Bank (in which the
Rockefeller family holds roughly 5% of the outstanding stock, David

_himself holding 135,756 shares of Chase" Manhattan)” It is therefore

of more than passing interest that Eugene Holman, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of Standard Oil Co. (New J ersey); and F.O. Prior,
Chairman of the Board of Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) are also Chase
Manhattan directors. In this case, unlike the GE situation, the execu-
tives operating the oil companies sit as directors of Chase Manhattan
at the nerve center of an important and wealthy family's operations.

At this point we can begin to see a pattern in the network of inter-
locking directorates. That is, alliances among the various corporations
considered (both sample corporations and financial corporations) fall
into a definite pattern based on ﬁnancial connections. One also begins
to see that certain groups or centers of interests appear. Rockefellers,
Morgans, Mellons, du Ponts and the like each have little empires that
close among themselves. On the other hand, this is by no means always
the rule. It is equally clear that a large fraction of the companies con-
sidered may well be loosely allied to an existing power center and yet
each of these enterprises has a power structure of its own. Consider the
example of HJ . Heinz C 0. which has been shown to be under the control
of the Heinz family (recall thatthe Heinz family holds roughly 76'?» of
Heinz stock), and yet H-.J . Heinz II is a director of Mellon National Bank
and Trust C 0. (center of the Mellon power structure). Furthermore, J .A.
Mayer, President of Mellon National is also a director of HJ. Heinz.
Thus, the Heinz family is allied with the Mellon interests. But the power

. in H.J. Heinz is the Heinz family and not the Mellon family.

As our final example, let us try to get some feel for what is meant by
a center of power byexamining an outstanding instance in detail: the
Mellon “group”-of companies. This great fortune was founded by Thomas
Mellon, a banker who made his money through shrewd and often ruthless
dealings. Thomas Mellon was the father of Andrew W. Mellon and
Richard B. Mellon. The four elders of the present Mellon clan are
Richard K. Mellon, Paul Mellon, Mrs. Allan Mellon Scaife and Mrs.
Ailsa Mellon Bruce. R.K. Mellon and Mrs. Scaife are the children of
Richard B. Mellon while Paul Mellon and Mrs. Bruce are descendants of
Andrew W. Mellon (Richard B. Mellon’s brother). A Fortune survey of
large American fortunes in 1957 indicated that all four of the current
Mellon elders had personal fortunes in the range of $400 million to
$700 million.” Our research indicates _that this estimate is valid. In
addition to these holdings, the children of these four persons have ex-
tensive holdings of their own (usually in the same companies: Gulf,
Alcoa, etc.) In sum, the holdings of all family members is probably in the
range of $3.5 billion. 14

The major financial centers of Mellon power are two: Mellon National
Bank and Trust Co. (eleventh largest commercial bank in the country),
and T. Mellon and Sons (an investment management firm). Both Paul
Mellon and Richard K. Mellon are directors of both concerns (Richard
K. Mellon is chairman of Mellon National Bank and president of T.
Mellon and Sons). In addition, Richard Mellon Scaife is a director of

57

 

58,,

Mellon National Bank (the Scaife family controls Scaife Co., a privately
held, Pittsburgh—based industrial concern).

Thus, Mellon National and T. Mellon and Sons, is the core of the
Mellons’ power. Let us see the extent of Mellon influence. On the board

of Mellon National we find directors of the following corporations in the"

Mellon group (the number in pa.rentheses indicates the number of
common directors):

Allegheny Ludlum Steel ( 1)
Aluminum Co. of America (4)
Consolidation Coal (3)
Crucible Steel (1)
Diamond Alkali (2)
H. J. Heinz (2)
Gulf Oil (4)
J ones & Laughlin Steel ( 4)
Koppers Co. (3)
Pittsburgh Plate Glass (3)
Pullman, Inc. (1)
Westinghouse Air Brake (4)
Westinghouse Electric (5)

In addition, A.B. Bowden (Vice-President of Mellon National) is a di-
rector of Allegheny Ludlum Steel, I.N . Land (Senior Vice-President of
Mellon National) is a director of Crucible Steel, A.V. Davis (director
emeritus of Mellon National) is honorary chairman of Alcoa, and W.C.
Robinson (also director emeritus of Mellon National) is a director of
Westinghouse Electric. 1

Of equal importance, we find that these interlocked directors have
themselves or represent large holdings in their respective industrial
corporations. Thus a Mellon National director, R.F . Evans, chairman and
president of Diamond Alkali, holds 171,740 shares in that company
(equivalent to 5.90’)? of the outstanding common stock).15 His brother,
not a director of Mellon National, holds 113,267 shares of Diamond
Alkali (3.91‘/r~).16 HJ. Heinz II holds the position of chairman of HJ.
Heinz Co. and holds 21.83’)? of the stock of Heinz.” Also, B.F. Jones
III holds 40,750 shares ofJones andLaughlin Steel and, like H.J. Heinz,
is a director of Mellon N ational.” Overall, the related Jones and
Laughlin families hold roughly 14.15% of their namesake company.”
Again, RA. Hunt, chairman of the executive committee of Alcoa, holds
857,796 shares in that company (4.07%) and serves on the Mellon
National board of- directors.” Finally, W.P. Snyder, Jr. serves as a di-
rector of Crucible Steel (he is a member of the executive committee of
the board of directors) and is also a Mellon National director. The im-
portance of this relationship is seen when we realize that Shenango
Furnace Co. (of which Mr. Snyder is chairman and which is controlled

by the Snyder family) holds an estimated 132,000 shares of Crucible.”
Thus, the propertied families allied with the Mellon interests have repre-
sentation on the big bank.

If we examine the fiduciary services provided by Mellon National for
this group of companies, we find that only Westinghouse Electric does
not have its fiduciary services performed by the big bank. This is because

the giant electric equipment firm is thought to be under the joint control .

of several “groups” and the Mellons are only partners in sharing control

 

As a‘ form of organization the corporate structure is quite simple.
The stockholders, be they the original investors or others, elect a group
of directors (usually numbering between ten to eighteen men). Each
share is entitled to one vote, thus distinguishing corporate democracy
from a political democracy in which each citizen has one vote. However,
since the size of the investment determines the number of shares owned,
the corporate form preserves (in the determination of directors at least)
the relative weight or importance of each investor. Presumably the larger
investor has more to lose and is therefore entitled to a larger voice in
the determination of policy (albeit indirectly through the board of direc-
tors). In turn, the board of directors selects the management: a president,
several vice-presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, etc. Thus, the line of
responsibility is clearly laid out and, in one form or another, this struc-
ture is common to most modern corporations. It should be noted that
Berle claims that in those corporations under management control it
is actually the management and not the many thousands of stockholders
who actually select the directors. We shall discuss this view at a
later point.

While the structure described above seems to be relatively simple,
the modern corporation is actually a bit more unwieldy than indicated.
For example, the giant of them all——American Telephone and Tele-
graph—-has nearly 2,000,000 stockholders of record. A stockholders’
meeting of all holders is obviously not possible. Indeed, the most recent
meeting of stockholders of A.T.&T. brought together the largest stock-
holders meeting in history, some 19,000 owners.

Shareowners and shareholdings

Various devices are used to hold stock in a corporation. Shown in
Table I is a tabulation of shareholdings of record by category of share-
holder in a large sample of domestic corporations. It is important to
understand the distinction between shareholdings and shareowners.
A shareowner is an individual who owns stock in one or more corpora-
tions. A shareholding is an entry in the records of the corporation in-
dicating ownership of stock. A shareowner who owns stock in five
corporations is represented by five shareholdings. On the other hand,
one person may own stock in one corporation but may register the hold-
ing using several names, a portion of the total holding under each name.
This single shareowner, then, would be— represented by several
shareholdings. »

It is evident from Table I that the majority of corporate stock is
owned directly by individuals. In fact, some 57.4 per cent of the common
stock included in this study was owned directly by individuals. Equally
important, 39.1 per cent of the stock was owned by one or another type
of financial intermediary, institution, or corporation. For our purposes,
a financial intermediary is a stockholder of record who holds stock for
the benefit of others. For example, a brokerage firm may hold stock
in its own name but the actual beneficiary may be one of the firm’s
clients. Let us now systematically investigate the various types of share-
holders of record.

36

with others. In addition, First Boston Corp. (in which R.K. Mellon and
Mrs. Scaife hold 112,500 shares) 22 underwrites the bond issues or stock
issues of J ones and Laughlin Steel, Alcoa, and Gulf Oil.

It  of course, difficult to convey the full extent of the power repre-

' sented in the control of these corporations. But their combined assets

total in the billions of dollars, they employ hundreds of thousands of
persons and are key companies in oil, steel, aluminum, coal, glass, chemi-
cals as well as electrical machinery.

One step away from the Mellon group itself, we find connections to
other industrial corporations in our sample. In addition to the Mellons,
the second important interest group in Consolidation Coal is the Hanna
group which controls some 28')’; of this largest coal company in the United
States.” Now Hanna also controls National Steel and has important in-
vestments in Texaco and Phelps Dodge. Moreover,G .H . Love, C hairman
of both MA. Hanna Co. and Consolidation Coal is a director of both
National Steel and Mellon National. B.F. Fairless, former chairman of
U.S. Steel is also on the Mellon board of directors. Thus, the nation’s
giant steel companies have representatives on the Mellon National board.

Finally, we are able to discern relations with other major centers of
power. We observe that the Phipps family has a holding of 156,000
shares in Mellon National itself and a holding of roughly 800,000 shares
of Gulf Oil.“ Again, Remington Arms (a majority of this company’s
stock is held by E.I. duPont de Nemours) 25 holds 150,000 shares of
Crucible Steel 26 Another important interest in Remington Arms is M.H.
Dodge who owns 674,074 shares of that company and who married
Geraldine Rockefeller, daughter of William Rockefeller (brother of»J ohn
D. Rockefeller)“ The ‘descendents of William Rockefeller are believed
to hold controlling shares in the First National City Bank of New York
(indeed, ‘J. Stillman Rockefeller is Chairman of the Board of First
National City).

The giant Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. holds 170,719 shares of Jones
and Laughlin Steel (H.S. Harrison, a V.P. and director of Cleveland-
Cliffs holds a directorship in Jones and Laughlin Steel to represent
this holding)?” Since Cleveland-Cliffs holds large blocs of stock'in
Inland Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Republic Steel, this
means that continuous relationships exist between Mellon National and
all of the major steel companies except Bethlehem Steel. It is clear
that if one digs deeply into the facts of the situation, one finds relation-
ships to many other interests (in the case of Cleveland-Cliffs it is the
Eaton-Mather Wade families who have connections to the Mellon group).
In summary then, we find ‘definite connections of the Mellon group not
only among companies within their immediate sphere of inﬂuence, but
also to other major financial and industrial interests.

In this brief sketch of the problem of interlocking directorates we
have tried to give a general characterization by example rather than a
thorough and formal analysis. Our conclusions, however, are based upon
much more data than has been presented here; the author can make a
detailed statistical analysis available to interested persons. To conclude:
we find extensive interlocking directorates between sample corporations
and various financial corporations. These interlocks often indicate a
pattern of connection through financial entities to certain centers of
power.

The community of interest

The power structure we have observed in the sample corporations
leads us to postulate the existence of working relationships among the
corporations considered as well as among the individuals who dominate
these enterprises. It is in this sense that we mean a “community of inter-
est” has grown. Many of the corporations here considered were launched
by a single family, and vet, over the years through mergers and acqui-
sitions these enterprises have had to reach an understanding with other
enterprises, as well as with financial interests controlling the lifeblood
of capitalism, namely capital. An even more recent phenomonon has
been the growth of new relationships among major previouslv separate
interests. A good illustration of this point is shown in the merger of the
Mellon Securities Corp. into the First Boston Corp. (First Boston is an
investment banking firm formed from the investment banking depart-
ments of the old Chase National Bank and the First National Bank of
Boston). Now First Boston is closely aligned with the Rockefeller inter-
ests and Mellon Securities was jointly owned by Richard K. Mellon and
Sarah Mellon Scaife. Thus, an alliance was formed between two of the
most powerful families in the economic elite of this country. Now the
Gulf Oil Corp., controlled by the Mellon family, and the Rockefeller oil
companies have several working relationships in operation. For instance,
Gulf and Standard Oil (N.J.) share in the ownership of the Venezuela
Gulf Refining Co. In addition, Gulf participates along with the Rocke-
feller companies in a number of other operations forming an important
cornerstone of the international petroleum cartel.

Approaching the concept of “community of interest” from another
point of view, the recent price—fixing scandals are another reflection of
the growing “cooperation” among major corporations. It appears that
administered prices may prove to be the rule rather than the exception

B among industrial corporations. As one steel executive defined competi-

tion: when prices of identical products are the same there is competition
for quality! One wonders what happened to the old-fashioned (and
strangely magical) “market” of classical economic theory.

What are the consequences of this growing community of interest?
The first is the rather remarkable trend to mergers among so many of
the giant industrial firms. Olin Mathieson Chemical was the result of a
merger of Olin Industries, Mathieson Chemical and the later absorption
of E.R. Squibb and Sons and Blockson Chemical Corp. General Dy-
namics resulted from the merger of the Electric Boat Co., Consolidated
Vultee Aircraft-(itself the result of a merger of Consolidated Aircraft
and Vultee Aircraft and the later acquisition of Stromberg-Carlson and
Liquid Carbonic Corp. Another consequence of the community of inter-
est is the growth of jointly-owned subsidiaries of the giants. Dow-Corning
is jointly owned by Dow Chemical and Coming Glass; Ormet is jointly
held by Olin Mathieson and Revere Copper and Brass. These joint
ventures even jump oceans to bring in European partners. Armco and
Thyssen Steel of West Germany have jointly launched a subsidiary. An
exhaustive enumeration of such ventures, however, would take many
pages.

Corporate cooperation has also begun to function on a different level.
A consciousness has developed among the economic power elite of the

60

  
 

 

 

‘ public image of big business. Industry associations spend large sums

creating what they call “confidence” in the free enterprise system.
Millions more are spent to get the public to accept and understand the
“business point of view.” Again, as in the drug industry, a united front
is formed to defend the industry as a whole from “government attack,”
the term the drug industry uses in referring to the investigation of the
industry by the Kefauver anti—monopoly sub—committee.

One begins to wonder, in view of these facts, just how far this trend of
cooperation will continue. There are hopeful signs that the Justice De-
partment may prosecute a number of anti—trust and price fixing cases.
These cases may show whether or not the trend can be stopped.

Concluding remarks

Before concluding a few points concerning the general scope and
approach of this study are necessary. The first point relates to how
much of the domestic economy is represented here: we have treated
the 250 largest industrial corporations; these corporations account for
58.45} of the profits of all industrial corporations. To complete a
truly encyclopedic investigation of this character, it would be necessary
to treat transportation, utility, merchandising and financial firms in
addition. We have deliberately chosen industrial corporations for a
number of reasons. First, due to government regulations requiring rail-
roads and utilities to report on large stockholders, much information
concerning them is already easily available. On the other hand, merchan-
dising and financial companies are relatively more concentrated in
ownership than industrial corporations so that a study of them would
tend to give a greater indication of concentration than is perhaps justified
for the total economy.

A similar cautionary note should, perhaps, be made with respect to
our list of the 99 propertied rich as a pinpointing of the economic “power
elite.” It should be remembered both that we have not included all kinds
of companies nor the holdings of directors in companies of which they are
not directors. In some cases, such as that of Allan P. Kirby, these other
holdings can be quite extensive. Thus our figures for the directors will
be on the low side, and the listing does not necessarily encompass all the
wealthiest persons in the sample corporations.

Of course the problem of finding who are the real top “controllers”
and decision-makers, or if in fact they operate as such, remains one of
the key unknowns in this field. Unfortunately, although certain
facts are generally acknowledged, this is a topic which at this stage must
rely entirely upon inferences from incomplete data, “insider” rumors
and the like, and therefore has no place in a study of this type.

Finally, it is very important for the reader to realize that our method
has been a very cautious one. We have relied entirely upon data which
are known with certainty. Guesswork is often necessary in this field due to
the efforts made to keep many of the facts from public view, but we have
avoided it, and with it that crutch of much work in economics, the “guess-
timate.” Therefore, our data must be regarded as a conservative estimate
of the situation, even to the point of distorting the truth somewhat.

In this study we have attempted to show what seems to the author to
be a rather simple fact: namely , in a free enterprise system, the means of
production are privately owned, i.e., the great mass of the populace
neither owns nor controls corporate stock but rather a relatively small
group of persons, the propertied rich, both own and, substantially, control
the giant enterprises of the nation. While the study has been hampered
by the absence of publicly accessible source materials. it is clear that it
is possible to make considerable headway in understanding that this is
indeed true. On the other hand, many points will only become clarified
with the revelation of information now withheld. That so much can be
found on the basis of publicly available information provokes a strong
desire to examine information hidden, and deliberately so, from public
view.

Shareholdings of individuals

As we have seen, the most common device for holding stock is the
direct ownership by an individual (we include joint ownership by a man
and wife, commonly known as a joint account, as direct ownership by
an individual). However, this method of holding stock has diminished
in relative importance. The last one hundred years have seen the growth
of various types of financial intermediaries as well as a growth of holdings
by insurance companies, foundations, investment companies, and the
like. As shown in Table.I, the average holding of an individual is only
163 shares. Since the typical large corporation may have several million
shares of stock outstanding, it is clear that the average individual holding
is negligibly small. This one fact has been the starting point for many
discussions of the wide diffusion of stock ownership. But a moment’s
thought shows that this figure of 163 shares per shareholding is almost
devoid of meaning as it averages over millions of shareholdings.

A better measure, by contrast, of the holdings of individuals is the
ownership of stock by families, distributed by the size of the holdings.
About one-third of all families owning publicly traded common stock
have investments of $5,000 or less. (See table VI.) In addition, roughly
four-fifths if all shareowning families own less than $25,000 worth of
publicly traded common stock. Also, only one-fifth of share-owning fam-
ilies own perhaps one-half or more of all common stock held directly
by individuals.7 We are led to the conclusion that the average share-
holding appears small simply because the bulk of individuals have small
holdings while a small minority of owners have moderate or very large"
holdings. (S'ee also our later discussion of Table IX.)

Shareholdings of fiduciaries

A fiduciary is one who holds property in trust for another. Fiduciary
shareholdings account for 4.6 per cent of all shareholdingsiand 9.4 per
cent of common stock. The average holding of a fiduciary isiabout two

37

 

and one-half times as large as the average holding of an individual.

But these figures shed little light on the full importance of fiduciaries.
Since we have defined the term fiduciary in terms of another term
not generally well known, the term “trust,” it is appropriate for us to

"describe fiduciaries in greater detail. In order to fully appreciate this

description it is necessary that the reader assume what is essentially a
new view of property. This view requires that one regard property as of
central importance and that one must plan in great detail to keep prop-
erty intact. Thus, the death of a beneficiary does not mean distributing
property to many beneficiaries but rather the redirection of income
from the property to a new beneficiary. Changes in the tax laws require
planning to lessen the impact on one’s property. In the world of the
propertied rich, the destruction of property via taxation or other means
is regarded as a disaster. One of the most popular devices for main-
taining property intact is the trust.
A trust may be defined as follows:

“A trust is a ﬁduciary relationship in which one person is theholder
of the title to property, subject to an obligation imposed either expressly
or by implication of law...” 8
Within this general framework there are many types of trusts in actual
use today. Historically, the first type of trust to gain widespread usage
was the testamentary trust under‘ which an estate was left to the man-
agement of trustees for the purpose of insuring proper management of
the property in question. If, for example, a decedent left only a wife
and minor children, the testamentary trust was the ideal means of in-
suring proper management of the family property. Beginning in 1850
numerous trust companies began a period of _rapid growth and their
functions were described as follows:

“They are the recipients and trustees of funds in large and small
sums, held for account of widows, minors, and others; and are safe de-
positories for those who wish to avoid the risks arising from investments
in the public securities of the times.”9

By 1961, however, the living trust has assumed central importance.
A living trust is a trust arrangement in which the individual places his
property in trust while he is alive and continues to derive income from
the trust. As we shall see, the living trust is a useful means of avoiding
a large tax bite. In order to establish a trust, the individual gives property
(no gift tax on gifts of this type) to the .trust, appoints trustees, and sets
up the terms of the trust. If an individual owns property directly and
wishes to split up the income to several beneficiaries the trust is the
perfect means’ of saving taxes. The income to the trust is not taxable to
the trust if the income is distributed to beneficiaries. Thus, instead of
paying one big tax bite on the direct income from the property, each
beneficiary pays taxes only on the portion he receives at a much lower
tax rate. In addition, one can direct that income from a trust be re-
directed at the death of a beneficiary to one or more other beneficiaries.
Legally, the property does not change hands if a beneficiary should
happen to die. Thus, there is no estate tax to pay since there has been
no transfer of property. However, one cannot establish a perpetual trust,

38

 

so that after several generations estate taxes must be reckoned with.

As the tax structure has grown in complexity, the trust has assumed
an even greater importance in the economy. To underscore this point,
Table II shows the growth of large fiduciaries in the twenty-one year pe-
riod from 1937 to 1958. 1° In this period the number of fiduciaries with
incomes in excess of $5,000 more than tripled (it should be remembered
that an income of $5,000 probably represents property value in excess
of $100,000). In the same period, dividend income of these fiduciaries
more than doubled.

Class, i.e., total income less total deductions (but before distributions to beneficiaries
and taxes). 1958 figures are classified by Total Income Class (before any deductions).
Further, in 1937 12,247 returns were misfiled on improper returns. These returns
have been distributed by the author on a proportional basis to the shown income
classes. Finally, in 1937 the requirements for filing were less stringent than in 1958.
Thus, it is possible that in the lower income classes especially the figures shown are
actually underestimates.

Using these data, itis. most difficult to estimate the number of indi-
viduals owning stock through fiduciaries. This is because a given person
may derive income from several trusts or, alternatively, several indi-
viduals may derive income from a single trust. As an example of the
former there is the case of Mrs. Marie Hartford Robertson who, with
her children, derives income from no less than eighteen trusts holding
about 745,785 shares of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. 11

A typical case of the other kind is provided by the Stewart family trust, ’

holding about 129,186 shares of Union Oil of California.” In this case
A.C. Stewart benefits from about 24,029 shares, while W.L. Stewart,
Jr. benefits from about 28,001 shares.” Both gentlemen are directors

» of Union Oil of California. The identity of the beneficiaries of the re-

maining 77,156 shares is not publicly known, but they are presumably
other members of the Stewart family.
