How Bud Are Things In Vietnam?

You have heard about the tragic deaths of hundreds
of Americans in Vietnam. But it is also afact that
since 1961 more than 250,000 Vietnamese men,
women and children have been killed in the war and
there are more than 700,000 refugees that are not
being cared for by any government. You have heard
that the U. S. is in Vietnam to protect the people
from Chinese Communist aggression. But it is a
fact that no Chinese troops have been found in Viet-
nam. The only foreigners fighting in Vietnam are
Americans and a few Australian and Korean allies
of the Americans. You have heard that the U. S. is
in Vietnam to protect democracy. But the South
Vietnamese government is not democratic. There
have been ten changes of government by military
take-over since 1961 but there has never been a
free election. [There is no constitution but there
are over 50,000 political prisoners.

The U.S. has said that massive supplies of weapons
are sent from North Vietnam into South Vietnam to
help the “Vietcong” rebels. The fact is that more
than 75% of the rebels’ weapons are made in the
U.S. and captured from the U. S.-backed troops of
the Saigon government. Only a handful of Chinese
weapons have been found in South Vietnam.

The U. S. says the “Vietcong” are Communists.
The fact is that most of the “Vietcong” are not
Communists. They have followed Communist lead-
ershipbecause the Communists led the fight against
the Japanese invaders in World War II; later, they
led the fight against the French attempt at recolon-
ization after World War II. The “Vietcong” are
fighting now against the U. S. sponsored “official
government” in Saigon because it is a dictatorship
opposed by most of the people, and because it has
not provided honest government or desperately
needed reforms. The “Vietcong” are fighting
against the U.S. because we backthe Saigon govern-
ment, because we are destroying their country,
and because they want us to get out of Vietnam.
The “Vietcong” are fighting for the independence
of South Vietnam from all foreign powers.

Why Are We In Vietnam At All?

The stated reason for U. S. intervention is to pre-
vent the spread of Chinese Communism into South-

  

inc

east Asia. North Vietnam and the “Vietcong” villa

rebels have been independent—and they want to stay just
independent. Every day the war goes on and every capt
act that extends it increase the chance that Chinese man
armies and Chinese inﬂuence will move south. refo

A more subtle reason is our opposition to attempts

by underdeveloped nations to throw off the yoke of lose
colonialism. The United States has intervened all Wh:
over the world. In Africa, Latin America, the Sine
Middle East and many parts of Asia our military dest
forces and policies are on the side of the colonial- v Viet
ists, the dictators and the exploiters against the dam
rightful demands of the common people for inde— vast
pendence, freedom and economic equality. tran
Why Are We Hated In Vietnam? the:
The government in Saigon loves the U. S.—-it would 
collapse without our help. But most of the people the ,
hate us. Why? Because they have suffered greatly fact
from the way the war has been fought —with U.S.- Sou,‘
made weapons, with U. S. guidance and advice, and

increasingly by U.S. soldiers. Napalm fire bombs :2“:
are regularly dropped on villages because there

might be rebels there. Poison chemicals have been Eric‘
sprayed on rice fields and farm animals to starve reb‘
the “Vietcong” guerillas. Large areas are satur— eve]

illas might be hiding in the jungles. Fragmentation mm

but hit many other people. Many rebels have been cg.
killed by such means. But so have many thousands

of noncombatants, many of them children. :12:
To keep farmers and other ordinary people from a st
giving help to the “Vietcong,” the South Vietnamese bﬂlj
army and also the U.S. army have burned villages 125,
and have herded people at gun point into crowded fore
camps behind barbed wire. Our airplanes, flown sow

homes. In cases where pilots are unable to hit the

bombing has caused great suffering to innocent com

What About Torture And Terror? held
You have heard that the “Vietcong” are aided by Aftf
the ordinary people in South Vietnam only because fare
they have terrorized the countryside. It is true cea:
that both sides in this civil war have done things the

which are terribly wrong. The “Vietcong” torture thar

village officials sent in by the Saigon government-
just as the “official” army tortures “Vietcong”
captives. But the “Vietcong” have the support of
many people in Vietnam because they carry out land
reform for poor farmers and provide medicine and
education for the villagers. They would quickly
lose this support if they treated the villagers badly.

What About Bombing North Vietnam?
Since February, 1965, U.S. bombers have been

_ destroying bridges, roads and railroads in North

Vietnam. Recently our planes have begun to strike
dams, dikes and hydroelectric plants, destroying
vast areas of farmland as well as production and
transportation facilities. We have been told that
the reasons for these raids are: (1) to prevent in-
filtration by North Vietnamese troops into South
Vietnam and, (2) to force North Vietnam to call off
the war in the South and to negotiate for peace. The
facts are that few North Vietnamese troops are in
South Vietnam —certainly fewer than one North Viet-
namese for every 20 American troops. There is
no reason to believe that the North Vietnamese
govermnent controls the civil war in South Vietnam
or can cause the “Vietcong” to stop fighting. The
rebellion began in the South and it will continue,
even if NorthVietnam is destroyed. Bombing North
Vietnam is killing more people and is destroying
more of their land, property and homes, but it will
not stop the drive for independence in South Vietnam .

Can The War Be Won?

The Saigon government has over 600 ,000 well armed
men in its army and police force; it has a navy and
a strong airforce. The United States has supplied
billions of dollars of military aid and now has over
125,000 troops, a huge fleetand an even larger air-
force engaged in the Vietnam war. Yet the U. S.-
South Vietnam armies keep losing. It is because
they don't have the support of the people, and with-
out this support they can never win.

The rebels will almost certainly win if the U.S.
leaves; they probably cannot totally win if the U.S.
insists on staying, but they can drive us out of the
countryside. They already govern the majority of
the South Vietnamese people and control most of
the country outside of afew major cities and U.S.-
held bases.

After 25 years of brutal occupation and bitter war-
fare, many of the people of South Vietnam have
ceased to care who wins. They only want to stop
the killing and destruction. The rebels have less
than 100,000 “soldiers,” many of them part time.

They must capture or “buy” most of their weapons
from the “official” government forces. They must
depend on the people for food and shelter. They
have no navy, no airforce, and Very little outside
help—except moral support. If they win, it will be
because the people of South Vietnam want them to
win and continue to help them.

What About A Communist Take-over?

If the Communists were to take over, what is there,
really, that they could do that we have not already
done? Torture? We have permitted that and have
done it ourselves. Concentration camps? We have
approved of them and have helped build them. Mass
killing? We have been doing that since 1961. Die-
tatorship? We have condoned and supported a
dozen dictators in South Vietnam and have never
permitted a free election. The longer the war
continues, with its inhuman destruction of life and
values, the greater the danger that some form of
totalitarianism will become entrenched, whether it
is in the name of anti-colonialism or of anti—Com-
munism.

Why We Protest!

As American citizens we are ashamed of what our
government is doing in Vietnam. We protested the
crime of Russians killing Hungarians; we protested
the crime of the French killing Algerians. We now
protest against United States actions in Vietnam-
they, too, are a crime.

‘A’ An immediate cease fire and prompt
withdrawal of all forces from Vietnam.

* A conference of all parties concerned‘
with Vietnam, including mainland China
and the National Liberation Front, to:

supplies for the people of Vietnam.

0 Insure free elections in South Vietnam
to establish a truly independent govern-
ment, not dominated by the United States,
China, or any other foreign power.

I Insure that Vietnam and the rest of
Indochina will be freed from all foreign
military intervention.

What You Can Do.

All of us are involved in the guilt for what
is being done in Vietnam. Our military men
drop bombs. Our taxes pay for them. Our
silence makes this tragedy possible.

I Some young men feel so deeply about this
issue that they have refused to serve in the
armed services.

I Hundreds of people, including Joan Baez,
the folk singer, refuse to pay income taxes
to support the war.

I Other people have refused to work in mil-
itary industries or to build weapons of war.

I Many people take part in public demon-
strations as a way of informing other Amer-
icans of their opposition to United States
war policies.

I Everyone can inform himself on the facts
of American military policies and actions
and on constructive alternatives. He can
also write informed letters to the Presi-
dent, to Congressmen and to local news-
papers, and discuss the issues with his
fellow Americans.

Have you considered doing any of these?
