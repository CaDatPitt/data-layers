the iron-fisted dictatorship of the class which has grown powerful
from exploiting the value-creating labor of_ the working masses.
The capitalist class always gave precedence to its own interest over
that of the; nation as a whole. It sacrificed the even and rounded

' development of the nation to its special class interests. Whereas the

true interests of the nation call for securing equality of status for
every people, for each of its nationality components.

Racism, National Oppression and Super-Exploitation

Under the hegemony of the capitalist class, the nationality com-
position of the nation was shaped on the basis of the racist concepts
of superior and inferior people, on the foundation of white supre-
macy, on the imposition of discriminatory barriers against the
Afro-American people as well as the Chicano, Puerto Rican, Native
American Indian and Asian minority peoples.

Progressive development of the nation requires that each of its
component peoples enjoy full equality of rights and genuine
democratic opportunity for participation with all others in deter-
mining the affairs of the nation. The rise of the American nation of
the U.S. was marked by the near genocide of the Native American
Indian and the brutally enforced exclusion of other peoples, most
particularly of‘Black people, but also of the Chicanos, Puerto Rican,
and Asian minorities.

The interests of the monopolist ruling class clash with the needs
of the nation. The security and future development of this nation
require the leadership of another class; that class which is not
parasitic, but the most productive class of the nation——the working
class. All future progress of the nation is related to the outcome of
the struggle of the working class to bring about a timely replace-
ment of the monopolists’ class from the leadership of the nation.
The cause of the nation, all the unrealized democratic and progres-
sive needs and expectations which the respective peoples of the
nation sought and fought for, become now the duty and responsi-
bility of the working class to champion and to lead the nation in all
and each of its component parts to victorious fulfillment.

Victory in the national struggle can be gained in our day only as a
function of the international struggle of the working class against
monopoly and imperialism. Its national cause has the distinction

8

 

 

and integrity of its own national banner; this struggle unfolds on a
particular sector of the common global front of the unitary world
revolutionary process. In an article on “The Working Class and the
National Question” (Vol. 19, C/W, p. 91-92) Lenin already noted
that:

“...the bourgeoisie fears the workers...and is betraying democ-
racy, advocating oppression or unequal rights among nations and
corrupting the workers with nationalist slogans.

“In our times the proletariat alone upholds the real freedom of
nations and the unity of workers of all nations.”

The nation’s progress, as well as that of each of its nationality
components—particularly so for the attainment of the freedom and
equality liberation goals of the 30 million nationally and racially
oppressed Black Americans—depends upon relating the struggle
for true national interests to the working class-led struggle against
the monopolists.

A historically necessary and just cause in itself, Afro-American
liberation is a vital link in the common chain. The liberation cause
of Black Americans is inherent in, and crucial to the struggle for the
democratic realization of the U.S. nation, to peace and social prog-
ress, to the democratic, national liberation and socialist goals of the
world revolutionary process.

The Afro-American question in the U.S. is a national question of
a special kind, of a specific type.

Afro-Americans are a component people of the U.S. nation. They
are an oppressed national minority. Black people are integral to the
U.S. nation, but are deprived of their rightful and full and equal
status with white peoples in the family of the U.S. nation. '

A complex pattern of racist prejudices and practice operates in
the nation to deprive Black people of economic, political and social
equality with their white fellow citizens.

Blacks are deprived of their just and equal share of things on the
racist grounds that the white “race” is superior and inherently

privileged and that all others are consequently inferior and there--

fore unequal. This is the basic assumption of all racism, which has
no scientific basis whatsoever. ' v

The national aspect of the oppression of Afro-American people
manifests itself in the fact that racism subjects all social strata of
Black people to racist humiliation and violation of their dignity as
human beings.

 

  

Afro-American women-
Especially Exploited and Abused 

This exploitation has a threefold effect on Black women. To the
effects of class and national oppression must be added the impact
of the ideology and practice of male supremacy. Thus, millions of
Black women are forced to work under below standard conditions
and for wage rates that extract an added measure of surplus value
from their labor.

In the present economic crisis situation, Afro-American women,
especially working class women, the poor and seniors, are being
compelled to bear a disproportionate share of the burden being
foisted upon the people of the country by the monopolies and the
government.

In addition to the above, Afro-American women are subjected to
constant attack from a capitalist class culture which conspires to
deny presentation of the heroic, life sustaining, intellectual, moral
and political contribution Black women have made andcontinue to
make to the struggles of their people and the nation as a whole.

Racism is the most damaging ideological device for shortcircuit-
ing class consciousness and fostering divisions and splits in the
working class and anti-monopoly masses of the nation.

As a consequence of racist oppression, deprivation and extra-
exploitation, the masses of Afro-American people havelbeen forci-
bly held in a condition of underdevelopment. For the realization of
equal opportunity, a wide-ranging, program of affirmative action
measures must be put into force to compensatepartially for the
long years of deprivation of equal rights.

All social strata of Afro-American people aspire to be free from
the oppression, special exploitation, racial indignities and humili-
ation to which Afro-Americans are subjected; yet not all social class
strata are equally burdened, nor equally determined in their resis-
tance.

Basic Workers and Other Class Strata

A mark of, and major consquences of the special oppression
levied against Afro-Americans is the fact that the overwhelming
bulk of the Black population are of the working class. The high
proportion of workers to the total Black population points to the
basic class source of Afro-American oppression and indicates the
monopolists’ super-profit-making object of that oppression. The

10

 

 

wealth of the capitalist ruling class has its origins in the seizure of
the unpaid-for values created by the labor of the workers; i.e. in the
exploitation of the working class.

Racism is used to pay Black workers less, to deny them access to
training, to bar them from upgrading and promotion, to consign
them to the least desirable and lowest paid jobs. All this increases
the amount of profits taken by capitalists and adds destructive
competition pressures between workers.

The dominance of the working class within the social stratifica-
tions of the Afro-American people gives this particular national
question a vital working class character. It is the-decisive factor in
determining the content and form, the goals and objectives, the
strategy and tactics of the struggle for equality and freedom for
Black people. ~

While still handled as a nationality reserve labor force in large
areas of the economy, Black workers have won an inseverable
status in the proletarian core of the U.S. working class. In basic
industry production they are an integral presence in a one to three

’ ratio. Black workers are an ever-strengthening force in the ranks

and a steadily increasing factor in the leadership of the decisive
sectors of the U.S. trade union movement. Playing a leading role in
the class struggle and national liberation, Black workers bind the
national liberation cause of Black people to the anti-monopoly-
class emancipation objectives of the working class as a whole.

The decisive social force objectively allied to the cause of Black
liberation is the working class. It is bound by historical necessity to
struggle ceaselessly for its own class emancipation from exploita-
tion and ruination, to fight the ruling class of monopoly capitalism,
the system that is the common foe, the system responsible for the
racist oppression of Afro-Americans, as well as of the Chicano, the
Native American Indian, the Puerto Rican, Asian, and other op-
pressed national minorities in the United States.

Unity and alliance with the working class--which is multi-racial
and multinational——is the vital link that must be welded by each
people in struggle for freedom. Additionally, each of the oppressed

, nationalities should strive to strengthen fraternal ties with one

another in the course of struggle against the common monopolist
foe and overcome the design of the oppressor to foster competitive,
antagonistic relations among minority peoples.

The national liberation struggle of Afro-Americans remains an
integral and allied cause of prime strategic importance for realizing

social progress and attaining anti—monopoly goals. Without gains »

here there can be no vista of anti-monopoly victory in general.

The fact that the Afro-American people are so largely working
class in their social composition makes linkage, and to a certain
extent convergence, of the national struggle for Black liberation
with the anti-monopoly and working class struggle, into being two
aspects of a single anti-monopoly, democratic and revolutionary
movement, against racist oppression and exploitation by the
monopolists.

The working class strata of the Black population is nine tenths of
the total but the other stratas, though numerically small layers,
have their important significance.

There is an impoverished rural segment—about 3 percent of the
total population——who are farm laborers, renters, tenants and small
farmers, who retain a precarious grip on land parcels in the tradi-
tional areas of the southern countryside where the predominant
majority of Blacks lived through the first third of this century.

Following in the path of the great W.E.B. DuBois, the best of the
intellectuals of the Black community, influenced by their social
and class reality, adopt the working class standpoint and find their
best aid to creative fulfillment in the Marxist-Leninist perspective.

The urban middle class are primarily engaged in providing cul-
tural, educational, professional and social services to Black con-
sumers. They are very poorly represented in that sector of the
middle class which services the management and front offices of
the corporate structures of the monopoly class.

It is especially upon this strata that the state monopoly
bourgeoisie trains its ideological barrage with bribe offers and
seductive blandishments. It strives to cultivate among Black
people a leadership trend that will act counter to the working class
policies and influence. It is necessary and possible for the major
portion of the black middle strata to play an active role as allies of
the workers in the anti-monopoly‘ struggle. The Black middle class
suffers special discrimination in addition to experiencing all the
insecurities of small proprietors, tax-burdened home owners and
suffer all the other hazards to their well-being experienced by the
lower middle class in general.

A fraction of one percent of the Black population are capitalists

12

 

 

in that their wealth is based on hiring and exploiting labor, etc. In
the main, this thin strata can be slotted in the general category of
small businessmen, small capitalists. They experience no incon-
siderable amount of racial discrimination in seeking to function
with their white capitalist peers. They experience the heavy weight
of the ruthlessness of monopoly, the banks and insurance com-
panies as does small business in general. This small but influential
stratum can play a positive role on a number of anti-imperialist
issues: in support of peace, detente, commerce and trade with the
developing African and socialist countries. They come out against
all kinds of indignities. They often take a positive ‘stand on certain
tax, health, and urban renewal questions.

The monopoly ruling class makes use of the dependence of
certain of the Black businessmen as well as of some opportunist
elements of the middle class, to maneuver with token signs of
progress against discrimination. As tokens of success, a few Blacks
are appointed to prestigious or high salaried positions in expecta-
tion that they will serve as decoys to divert the wrath of the masses
resulting from the agony of their desperate circumstances. They are
given such positions to promote illusions in the viability of
capitalism, and in expectation that they will come out as apologists
for one or another policy of imperialism at ‘home or abroad.

While other class strata have not exhaustedtheir capacity for
making a positive contribution on the broad front of activity against
racist proscriptions, given the nature of the monopoly class enemy
to be addressed, the fact of the working class preponderance in the
Black population, with its strategic location being in the very Vitals
of the production base of the system, make the working class strata
objectively situated to play the leading role in the struggle for Black
liberation.

Under pressure of the movement of Afro-Americans and their
allies, changes occur in the forms of oppression. Brute force and
terror are supplemented by tokenism and yielding of certain con-
cessions. This is the equivalent of the neo-colonialist maneuvering
which imperialism undertakes to influence politically and to gain
or retain economic control of the former colonial countries.

Under the impact of the rising militant struggle of the national
liberation and working class forces, reforms and concessions are
forced from the state monopoly ruling class. Such concessions are
testimonials to the power of struggle and unity. Such concessions

13

 

 

  
  

are never designed by the exploiter class as down payments on real
freedom; they are reluctantly yielded under pressure and with
hopes of using them for dissembling the lib_eration movement.

Power: The Political Essence of The Struggle

In its political essence the struggle of Afro-Americans “to be
free” is a struggle to gain for Black people adequate political power
to secure and safeguard their rights as individual citizens and as a
component nationality, anational minority of the United States. It
is a political struggle consonant with the effort of the working class
and the totality of anti-monopoly progressive forces for genuine
representative government, for real democracy. Black people fight
to eliminate all disfranchisement laws and ruses such as ger-
rymandering. Afro-Americans demand real political power in the
areas of their majority, and counter-gerrymander reapportionment
measures to provide for maximum representation everywhere and
at all levels of government.

In addition to perceiving properly the special relationship which
the Afro-American people have to the U.S. nation, and understand-
ing correctly the class interrelation and strategic alliance between
the entire working class and the Black American people as a whole,
it is necessary to consider the way world developments impact
upon the struggle for Afro-American liberation.

The struggle for Afro-American liberation takes place in a period
of_ a sharply deepening crisis of U.S. capitalism in the advanced
stage of the general crisis of world capitalism.

The times feature the steady march to victory of peoples who
have achieved their national liberation. This is a time when real
socialism advances the frontiers of social progress and the banner
of Marxism-Leninism leads along all roads which the peoples of
the world revolutionary process are taking.

Afro-Americans take pride in and experience deep inspiration
from the historic achievements of working peoples the world
around. The dictum of Frederick Douglass that “a blow struck for
freedom anywhere, is a blow against tyranny everywhere” is a part
of their national traditional mindset.

Great is the attractive power, the impact of the example of the
triumph of socialism in the Soviet Union. There poverty and racism

14

 

have long been banished, and its hundred distinctive nationalities
are ﬂourishing and partaking as equal partners in the building of a
Communist society, without class exploitation or national oppres-
sion. The impact and influence of the example of the community of
socialist states, powerfully aids the cause of Afro-Americans. The
revolutionary achievements of Cuba, of Ethiopia, of Angola, make
their weighty imprint upon the consciousness of masses of Afro-
Americans in struggle for equality, justice and freedom.

More and more the program and ideology of the cause of Black
liberation will reflect the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary science
and orient on the universal working peoples’ goal of socialism/
Communism.

One manifestation of the deepening of U.S. capitalism’s general
crisis is seen in the fact that the monopolist class has to resort more
frequently to masking its unconscionable drive for maximum profit
and political domination under a camouflage canopy of social
demagogy and carefully constructed deceptions.

While not for a moment renouncing its reliance upon the law of
violence, repressive legislation, police terror and prisons, while
continuing its patronage of ultra-right racist, political and organi-
zational adventurers, the ruling class is compelled to maneuver
with yielding certain concessions to the masses as an endeavor to
divert them from their course, to detour and diminish the rising
tide of working class and anti-monopoly struggle.

As this is so in general, it is no less so with respect to the special
oppression of Afro-Americans. The monopolists hope to dull the
determination to do battle and dissemble the forces of Black libera-
tion through greater recourse to the tactic of reformism taken from
the ideological grab bag of social democracy.

The policy of neo-colonialism abroad has its home equivalent in
neo-segregationism. The grotesque face of racism is fitted out with
new cosmetic masks of deception and misrepresentation.

The very concept of “equality” is abused and misused to con-
tinue racist practices of robbing Black people of their just economic
and civil equal rights, as revealed in the Bakke and Weber cases.

Racist Exploitation

The violated civil rights of the victims of racism cannot be simply
equated to the common class exploitation and impoverishment of

15

 

 

 

  
  

all workers. Racist oppression is an additional dimension of extra-
exploitation and double-deprivation which state monopoly
capitalism imposes upon Black people as a special mechanism in
the total exploitative system.

All the means which have been and are used to bribe, entice and
convert talents from the ranks of labor into its misleaders and into
apologists for the monopolists’ class system are resorted to with a
new stress in respect to the cause of Black liberation.

The ideological struggle against social democracy, reformism,
and its most virulent stock-in-trade—anti-Communism and anti-
Sovietism—is a high priority task of Communists within the Black
freedom movement.

The anti-Communism/anti-Sovietism essence of reformism is
designed to sever the cause of Black liberation from the working
class struggle against the monopolists at home, and isolate and
alienate Black Americans from the global front of anti-imperialist
struggles for social progress, democracy and socialism; and for
national liberation in Africa, Asia, Latin America. Herethe historic
connection of international proletarian solidarity is made between
the socialist world of working class power and the cause of national
liberation.

World Context

The struggle of Afr_o—Americans for equality and freedom from
racist oppression is objectively a part of the world revolutionary
process on three counts:

First, the Black population being predominantly working class,
comes under the impact of the universally valid laws governing the
origin of class struggle and development of class consciousness; its
basic class composition binds it in international ties to workers in
struggle against imperialism the world over.

Second, as an oppressed people in struggle for equality and
freedom, it is objectively aligned with the world anti-imperialist
cause of nations and nationalities fighting to be free.

Third, it is a vital component of the coalition of working class
and popular anti-monopoly forces whose struggles for economic
progress, democracy and peace, against racism and reaction, are
destined to prepare the way for displacing the government of state
monopoly capitalism by one of popular power.

The struggle for equality and real democracy is at basis a struggle

16

 

for the transfer of power from the hands of the state monopoly
ruling class to the control of the people.

The struggle for democratic rights in general, as for equality for
Black Americans in particular, cannot be received as a gift from the
hands of the very monopolists who fashioned the undemocratic
system in the first place, and concessions which can be wrested
from them through struggle, while important, will never measure
up to either need or justice. ,

The struggle for democratic rights and equality must be logically
extended to that of a conscious anti-monopoly struggle for a gov-
ernment of peoples’ power and working class leadership.

Such a government would proceed to transfer the ownership and
management of the corporate private control of the national wealth,
of the natural resources, the banks and the basic industries, the
agro-monopolies, and the transportation trusts, to peoples’ democ-
ratically administered government ownership.

Such an anti-monopoly government would drastically reduce
military appropriations and the armed forces. It would affect radi-
cal democratic reforms in the three branches of government on
each level. Racism in all respects would be outlawed. It would put
into force a real affirmative action program for true equality. Such a
government would open the way to socialist reorganization of
society, headed by the working class, under the ideological gui-
dance of the historically confirmed political science of human
liberation—Marxism-Leninism.

The cause of Afro-American equality embodies the essence of the
internationalism of working people and the true class interests of
the multitracial, multinational working class of the U.S.A. In the
spirit of john Brown, Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, Ab-
raham Lincoln, William Sylvis, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth,
W.E.B. DuBois, Paul Robeson and other heroes and heroines of the
past, we are certain that the historically established bonds of strug-
gle against oppression and exploitation which unite working
people of all races and nationalities should always be cherished,
nourished and strengthened.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary year of its founding, the
Communist Party, USA has every reason to look back in pride to its
contributions to the cause of Afro-Americans’ liberation, to the
combatting of racism and to the development of relations of Black
and white unity on the solid basis of equality and justice. The

“To the old world, the world of national oppression, national
bickering, and national isolation, the workers counterpose a new

world, a world of the unity of the working people of allnations, a -

world in which there is no place for any privileges, or for the
slightest degree of oppression of man by man.”

outstanding service of the Communists and the light which the
science of Marxism-Leninism casts upon the pathway of struggle,
gives assurance of new victories, of confidence in the future.

Throughout its 60 years our Party has always given special atten-
tion and emphasis to those activities and struggles which advance
the cause of Afro-American equality as vital to upholding the
interests of the working class and the nation as a whole. At this
stage of the struggle for equality we are determinedly pursuing this
line in all major areas of life. The multiple crises inflicted on our
country by the greed and piracy at home and abroad of the state
monopoly establishment, have made urgent an intensification of
our activities and even deeper involvement in the struggles of the
masses.

In the area of the crisis of everyday living, the area of the
economic front, present-day problems require increased efforts on
our part to help the working people as a whole resist the offensive
of the monopolies. In each area, special account must be taken of
the specific relationship to Afro-Americans’ need and struggle for
equality. .

In their classic teaching, the Communist Manifesto, Marx and
Engels wrote that Communists are distinguished from all other
political parties because they alone “point out and bring to the
front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently
of all nationality,” and because they “always and everywhere rep-
resent the interests of the movement as a whole.” Observance of
these principles in practice enabled Lenin to project that immortal
call to battle that has already changed the world and is still chang-
ing it: “Workers and oppressed peoples of all lands, Unite!”

URGENT ISSUES FOR ACTION
FOR THE AF R0-AMERICAN PEOPLE’S
, STRUGGLE F OR FULL EQUALITY

Economic Equality

0 Real affirmative action programs with quotas, time limits,
goals and penalties for failure to fully comply, in all private and
public employment. To secure the judicial reversal and legislative

18

 

 

nullification of Bakke; to defeat the arrant racist challenge to
economic equality represented by the Weber case and the Sears-
Roebuck assault on Affirmative Action.

0 Large government financed and operated public works prog-
rams to provide jobs at highest skills for the jobless at union wages.
Expand the housing program and wipe out all urban blight. Iob
training programs for guaranteed jobs on the basis of Affirmative
Action.

0 Cut military budget by at least 50 percent and use funds for
social services. Cut military production and convert plants to
peacetime production. All hiring through government hiring of-
fices, employing Black supervisory staff in equal numbers.

0 Organize the unorganized, especially in the South and espe-
cially the electrical-electronics, textile, chemical & fertilizer and
other industries with high employment of Afro-American and
minority workers. Organize service trades and domestic workers.

0 Eliminate all North/South wage differentials and nationally
standardize job classifications and occupational categories.

0 Across the board wage increases to be the policy of the trade
union movement to eliminate percentage wage increases. Increase
minimum wage to $5 per hour.

0 Unemployment compensation, at a living_ wage to all jobless,
including first time job seekers. Uniform federal standards tied to
the cost of living for full duration of unemployment.

0 End all cutbacks in social services and increase the same. Place
all social services and education under federal funding and con-
trol. Raise Social Security payments for all to federal standard for
decent living regardless of past earnings. Cover all people of re-
tirement age. -

0 Workers on all hazardous jobs be given premium pay, safer
and healthier working conditions, shorter work weeks, early re-
tirement at full pay, full free medical care, semi-annual medical
checkups, etc. In short, make all these jobs premium jobs with
union inspectors and on-site federal safety control.

0 Plants be built in urban areas with large Afro-American and
minority populations. Adequate mass transportation to provide
ready access to the plants. Government financed housing near the
plants at rents and prices workers can afford and with no discrimi-
nation. For a federal law to make it illegal for runaway shops and

19

,

plants to abandon urban areas with a provision for government
takeover and operation with the workers’ control.

0 Pass a Youth Full Employment Act with strong affirma-
tive action sections and severe penalties to guarantee compliance,
especially by large employers and governments to reduce youth
unemployment rate at least to the national average.

For Special Measures for the Relief of Farmers

and the Rural Poor

With their numbers depleted, even the remaining Black
farmers—under the combined assault of the tax assessors, the mar-
keting producers and farm implement monopolists, the big land-
lords and agro—businesses—are suffering ruin and being driven
from the land. The work and living conditions to which the migrat-
ory workers are subjected surpass description. The plight of tenant
farmers is that of desperation.

We call for the enactment of a full program of reform measures to
meet the urgent needs of the farmers and rural folk that they may
have a decent living standard and retain their land as individual
owners and/ or as members of cooperatives. Such a program must
include a debt moratorium on all bank loans and cancelling of
taxes. It must provide for Government subsidies and long-term
interest-free loans for housing construction, modern farm imple-
ments, seed and fertilizer grants, free transportation, storage and
marketing services and for the extension of all social services,
health, education and other benefits to rural people.

Political Equality

O The political and electoral struggle is one of the major fronts of
the struggle for political power to help secure and safeguard the
freedom of Afro-American people. T

0 End all racist barriers to Black Americans contending for, and
occupying any public post—-elective or appointiVe——without re-
gard to the ratio of Afro—Americans in the total population. Secure
majority rule for Afro-American peoples in all localities where they
are the majority of the population, especially in the counties and
towns of the South, and proportionate representation for expanded

20

 

 

minority representation in others, including elective, appointive,
administrative, judicial, school boards and administration, police
and fire departments, etc.

0 Initiate massive voter registration and voting drives to help
elect anti-monopoly candidates, to elect Afro-American progres-
sive candidates to office, especially Black trade unionists and labor
leaders, for maximum representation in all legislative bodies.

0 Build electoral apparatus in every Afro-American community
to help guarantee peop1e’s anti-monopoly candidates and voter
turnout.

0 Establish effective procedures to secure and safeguard the
Afro-American vote against gerrymandering, voter intimidation,
inaccurate and short count census, and “metropolitanization”
schemes. Secure ‘genuine democratic reapportionment with re-
drawn electoral district lines to overcome gerrymandering, espe-

. cially in the South and the urban areas, and on the basis of the 1980

census to maximize Afro-American representation on the federal,
state andlocal level.
p 0 End masked racist attacks on Afro-American and other minor-
ity public officials.

0 Secure the election and appointment of Afro-American rep-
resentation in all leadership levels of the trade union movement.

Social Equality

, 0 Massive program for building public housing for low income
and working people with safeguards against segregation schemes,
but located where the need is the greatest——to the Afro-American
and minority communities, both rural and urban.

0 National Health Care program to make high quality health care
available and free to all, with priorities in the Afro-American and
oppressed minority communities.

0 End the dual public educational system based on segregated
housing patterns and districts and replace with one high quality
integrated system with first priority to those schools in the ghettos
and barrios. Build new schools in areas for immediate integration.
Develop daycare centers with early childhood education. Affirma-
tive Action hiring and promotion of teachers, professors and ad-
ministrators at all levels. Eliminate all teachers who exhibit blatant
racist ideas, concepts and/ or acts.

0 Open admissions and free tuition in all federally supported

21

 

  
  

schools. Special government grants for Afro-American students in
major professions critically needed in the Afro-American rural and
urban communities. —

0 Mandatory inclusion in all curricula; kindergarten through
college, of the true Afro-American history and the appreciation and
instruction in the art, music, dance and culture of Afro-American
people.

0 End police brutality including police occupation of predo-
minantly Afro-American high schools. Wipe out drug traffic in
neighborhoods and schools along with a humane and socially
responsible rehabilitation program for its victims.

0 Provide adequate supervised recreation facilities in Afro-
American and oppressed minority communities.

0 Ban all racist organizations and racist activities. Outlaw the

THE STRUGGLE FOR _
AF R0-AMERICAN LIBERATION

-For economic, political and social equality.
—Agoinst racism and discrimination.

As capitalism sinks deeper into its general crisis, as unemploy-
ment lines lengthen and living costs soar, the shackles of discrimi-
nation and racist oppression against Afro-Americans become more
unbearable. Marooned on islands of poverty and misery, taunted by
the luxurious living style, the flaunted affluence of a ruling class
rolling in unearned riches, millions of Afro-Americans face an
increasingly desperate crisis of survival.

No progress is possible without confronting the current myth of
Black economic progress, the illusions of achieved equality. The
relative economic position of the Black population has, in fact,
declined in recent years. The income gap between Black families
and the national average continues to widen. In such things as
housing, health care and education, the gains of previous years are
being eroded. Black unemployment remains at a depression level.

Further, as the crisis of the state monopoly economic system
worsens, sustained and deliberate efforts are being made to erase
gains already made. The meager resources previously available for
economic and social programs which aid the Black community are
beingreduced or eliminated.

Steps are being taken now as governmental policy to slow down
the economy, create additional unemployment and reduce
economic resources available for social services, particularly those
which impact most on Black communities. All this will have an
even more devastating effect on the Afro-American population.

Pressed into the blighted areas of the cities and the poorest rural
slums, where one of four heads of families is unemployed and half
of their youth have neither jobs now or future prospects, the dis-
eases of poverty are raising the death rate of Afro-Americans to a
level unprecedented. Such is the situation confronting the least
advantaged stratas of the nation's Black citizens. What is their way
out? Where does the freedom route of the Black people’s movement
lead?

 

  
  

The freedom struggle has taken several forms amd projected
many slogans. The variety of the demands which Black people
fight for under their banner of real equality, genuine democracy,
true freedom, and the extension of the skirmish ‘lines-—from South
to North, from coast to coast-reveals how-widespread is its ab-
sence. Some of the specific demands of Black people encompassed
by the freedom slogan can be stated programatically as follows:

0 Freedom is the right to have a full voice in deciding the affairs
which govern the fate of the nation. It means Black citizens exercis-
ing the political power where they are “the many” and having a just
share of it where they are “the few.”-

O Freedom is a job at one’s highest skill and the right to continue
training and for promotion in accordance with one’s ability.

0 Freedom is a good-sized home furnished as a family needs it to
live in a comfortable way. *

0 Freedom is an open door for one’s children to get a first-class
education in a top-rate, non-segregated school system.

0 Freedom is all those things which make a person’s neighbor-
hood a fit place to live in: where the streets are kept clean, the
community hospital is good, where there are playgrounds and
parks and centers for young people’s receation.

0 Freedom is the right to community of one’s own choice. It is
the absence of segregation, of racially restricted and exclusive
housing, jobs, clubs or whatnot. Equally, it demands big-scale
investments in the general rebuilding of the Black communities. It
is a program of displacing slum housing and reconstructing the
material foundation of the poor communities of large Black popula-
tions. .

0 Freedom is the security of one’s person. It is the right to live
free from arbitrary arrest, free from police terror and violence. It
requires justice from the courts.

0 Freedom is the right to self—respect, to be treated like a human
being; the right to dignity and respect shown toward one’s color,
and race, and people; the right to be one’s self and still be treated as
the equal of any other American. It is the absence of racism.

Such concrete aspects of a program for equality and democratic
rights are encompassed in the concept of freedom and appear to
one degree or another in the programs of most of the organizations
which together constitute the movement of the broad masses of
Afro-American people in struggle for freedom and equality.

In addition to such particular urgent needs which the movement
of the Black people put forward, it is also joined to the struggle in
support of such general causes as that of ending the arms race,
reducing the arms budget and solidarity manifestations with South
Africa's African National Congress (ANC), with the South West
African People's Organization (SWAPO), the Patriotic Front of
Zimbabwe, and all other victims of imperialism in battle for free-
dom.

Afro-Americans — A Component of the ‘US. Nation

The anti-humanist nature of the historically outmoded system of
capitalism is manifested in its racist treatment of the Afro-
American people. The values which the toil and creativity of this
people have contributed to the formation, developments and
wealth of the nation establishes the objective and historical fact of
the 30 million Afro-Americans being a component part of the U.S.
nation. ,

U.S. racism in doctrine and practice is a capitalist soncoction
compounded of prejudice and ignorance and was first adminis-
tered on a mass scale to overcome resistance to the introduction
and maintenance of slavery.

Slavery in the U.S. was a labor system based upon the capture
and bondage of human beings from Africa, their shipment, sale and
subsequent employment in the economy as human machines, work
animals; sold and resold as chattel-commodities on the capitalist
market. The apologists of the slave merchants and cotton
capitalists shamelessly developed the doctrine of the inherent

V supremacy of people of white skin and the inherited inferiority of

people of black skin.

Despite the terrible torture that racism has caused the nation-
including the four years of Civil War——the monopolists still use this
ideological rot to promote race conflict between the exploited and
convert it into profit.

Divisiveness and Diversion

Racism, prejudice and hatred against Black people are still
counted upon by the capitalist rulers to “blow the mind” of the
white workers, to divert the anger of the white and Black exploited

3

 

  

 

masses away from the state monopoly class of exploiters and on to
one another.

Racism is the ideological alley where the greed of Big Business
and all profiteers join in assaulting and robbing the Afro-American
communities.

Racism is the blinders on the eyes of the white working people
which prevent them from seeing the threat to, and violation of,
their true class interest when discrimination is tolerated against
Black citizens.

But racism is not merely an offense to human dignity. In its
modern usage, it is a sophisticated ideological and psychological
instrument and mechanism used by the monopolies for generating
extra-surplus value from the exploitation of all working people
through the super-exploitation and oppression of Afro-American
people. Furthermore, racism is a special capitalist tool for dismem-
bering the unity of the working class, for severing the class ties
which objectively bind the workers of all nationalities, races and
cultures into one brotherhood of struggle against their monopoly
capitalist exploiters.

Afro-American people were involved from the earliest times in
the rise and development of this -American nation, and represent a
historically determined component part of it. Nevertheless, be-
cause of the special forms of oppression and racial discrimination
to which this people has been subjected, it has also been segregated
from thenation, forcibly kept from partaking fully of its rightful
status as a equal member of the national family.

Notwithstanding the fact that Afro-Americans communicate in
the language common to the rest of the nation and have made major
contributions to the economy and to the culture of the nation, the
severe patterns of anti-Black discrimination and white racial ex-
clusiveness have compelled them to be a people apart. They are set
apart by identifiable features of their African origin, by barricades
of physical segregati-on——especially in housing and job
classifications—as well as invisible walls of social ostracism and
psychological rejection.

While fighting to secure their full status as equal citizens of the
American nation, Black people assert their identity as a distinctive
people.

The singular experience of, and epic struggle against the caul-
dron of slavery’s horror and segregation’s aftermath, were unique

4

 

factors which fused a national consciousness that continues to be
tempered in the fires of the ongoing struggle for freedom. It is such
singular historical and contemporary experiences which contri-
bute to and account for the special national features of the culture of
Black people.

The particular national aspect of the Afro-American people has
its distinctive cultural expression in a rich and growing body of
literature and artistic creation. It is manifested also in the prideful

reclamation of their history and in the popularization of esthetic

taste and styles of American and African origin. This fight for
self-determined esthetic standards and art forms appropriate to the
tasks of giving cultural expression to the Blacks’ own historical and
contemporary experience and creativity, is an important part of the
general struggle for dignity and freedom. At the same time, it
enriches the. culture of the nation as a whole influencing and be-
ing influenced by the whole of U.S. culture.

Class Stratification

As the U.S. nation as a whole is class stratified, just so the Black
component has an internal class structure. But the most important
thing about the class stratification of the Afro-American people is
its overwhelming working class composition. Some 90 percent of
the total population are of the working class. Another 3 ‘percent are
poor farmers and toilers in agriculture. There is an urban lower
middle class stratum of professionals, teachers and shopkeepers
who represent 5 percent of the total. Less than 1 percent have a
command of finances sufficient to qualify for the category of
capitalist.

The principal class content of the Black people, therefore, is that
reflecting its dominant class component—the working class. In the
long run, it will be the requirements, needs, aspirations and ulti-
mately the leadership of personalities from the working class
stratum of this people that will become reﬂected in the program,
goals, strategy and tactics of its freedom movement.

Black workers know from their place in the production relations
that it is not the white man in general who profits from the racist
degradation and added economic exploitation to which the Black
worker is subjected; it is the white capitalist who is the common
exploiter of both Black and white workers.

The conflicting tendencies and policies within the freedom
movement are a reflection, to one degree or another, of the con-
tradictory interests of the two basic class forces in the total
society—the working class influence versuslthe capitalist influ-
ence.

The working class influence will express itself in emphasis on
building the movement on the basis of broad popular unity to
maximum strength, in gaining working class allies from among the
white majority; in giving a democratic structure to its concert of
leadership; in elaborating a strategy—a longer-range’ plan, and
associated tactics which further the realization of the basic freedom
goal and objectives. The influence of the working class upon policy
and leadership makes for planned struggles carried out in a well
organized and militant manner. Under its influence the movement
reacts to spontaneous developments but it does not base its course
upon them.

The capitalist class influence within and upon the Black People’s
movement reflects itself as policy that avoids struggle and appeal
to the masses; invites compromise without struggle and accomoda-
tion to the conditions that obtain. It often projects the prejudices
and hatred of the big capitalists, into the movement, especially in
opposition to alliance with white workers, as well as in “Soviet-
phobia” and anti-communism.

Tendencies to excessive individualism, arbitrary and anarchistic
decisions, underestimation of questions of organization, of tactics
and alliances, of choice of forms of action appropriate to the cir-
cumstances are some of the negative inclinations of leaders who
represent and reflect non-working class influences and ac-
comodationist tendencies.

The inﬂuence of the non-working class forces on the direction of
the movement may cause sections of it to raise slogans for separa-
tion and national exclusiveness. These would have the effect of
isolating the Black people's freedom cause and divorcing it from its
natural allies in associated anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist strug-
gle. .
The dynamic of the freedom struggle discloses more and more
the fundamental unwillingness and incapacity of the monopolies
to effect the kind of radical reforms which are required to secure a
fair and equal level of civil and social equality, political democ-
racy, material well-being and economic and cultural opportunity

for the Black masses. State monopoly capitalism has no will to
solve the problems of Black oppression; indeed it is the capitalist
class which is the cause and source of the problem and which
profits from it. ,

Increasingly, the experiences of the most conscious and thought-
ful participants in the struggles of the movements will suggest the
validity of the judgment of the Communist Party: that the road to
Afro-American Liberation, to genuine equality and self-fulfillment
of Black Americans as a people, lies in the constant waging of the
battles for the just economic, social, political and democratic re-
forms urgently demanded this present day. In doing so to prepare
the forces and establish alliances within the framework of a great,
popular anti-monopoly strategy, reflecting the needs of all work-
ing people. That will open the way for development of the struggle
to its logical revolutionary conclusion-—to the displacement of the
racist exploitative system of state-monopoly capitalism by a new
and just society—Socialism.

Even before the birth of the nation, Afro-American people—_who
had come mainly as chattel in chains—had mounted the struggle to
be free. The epic freedom struggle of Black Americans has re-
mained a continuing theme in the historical saga of the rise and
development of this American nation. Their thunderous path‘ of
struggle is ineradicably a major force in the unfolding of the coun-
try’s history.

The nation which has developed in the United States is a com-
plex community of peoples drawn from a wide range of ethnic and
racial types from many countries and all continents. This U.S.
American nation can be likened to a national family of distinctive
peoples who are more or less identified by the dominant traits of
their respective earlier national origins. Identity with the nation is
decisively determined by the economic values added to the wealth
of its natural resources in the furtherance of its development. By
this test no component element of the population has more claim
on membership in the U.S. nation than Afro-Americans who have
contributed their brawn and brains for the development of the
economy of the nation, as slaves and as free persons. No people
have added a greater dimension to the culture of the nation of the
U.S. than that which constitutes the specific national contribution
of the Afro-American people.

The U.S. nation was reared in the cradle of the marketplace under
