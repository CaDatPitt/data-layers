The STUDENT ADVOCATE

Morgan: Wanted for Murder

By JOSEPH P. LASH, INTERVIEWING SENATOR NYE

N THE Spring of 1934 the Senate al-

most unnoticed voted, “Whereas, the
inﬂuence of the commercial motive is
on-e of the inevitable factors often be-
lieved to stimulate and sustain wars,”
to investigate the munitions industry
with a view to passing legislation to
end the traffic in death. The prevailing
attitude at that time, of even the muni-
tions makers was: “we could not say
other than that we welcome an investi-
gation.”

Senator Gerald P. Nye, who had
introduced the resolution was, accord-
ing to Senate custom, made chairman
of the committee. With the able as-
sistance of Senator Clark of Missouri,
he has relentlessly pursued the paths
continually opening up before the
committee which have amply demon-
strated how the “commercial motive”
has stimulated and sustained wars. By
last Spring the committee had uncov-
ered so unmistakably the real basis of
war that Senators Nye and Clark sup-
ported the student anti-war strike.

The committee’s investigations into
the activities of the munitions-makers
proper showed even last spring in a
report made by Senator Nye to the
74th Congress that munitions-makers
contrive to prolong wars and excite an-
tagonisms among nations in order to
create a market for their wares, that
the military and even diplomatic serv-
ice aid the industry in selling its
wares, that the munitions-makers sabo-
tage and evade arms embargoes and,
through inﬂuence on government of-
ﬁcials, act to prevent international
amity and trust.

At this point of the investigation war
in Africa threw this phase, arms con-
trol, into the background and raised
the larger issue of neutrality and busi-
ness. In order to initiate invulnerable
neutrality legislation, the committee
undertook this Fall to examine how the
United States starting out in 1914 with
a policy of “being neutral in thought
as well as in deed” nevertheless ended
up on the side of the Allies.

It therefore summoned the House of
Morgan.

SENATOR GERALD P. NYE

GREAT drama began to unfold—a

drama of how this banking part-
nership, the most eloquent symbol of
American capitalism, became so in-
volved on the side of the Alli-es that
not to declare war in 1917 would have
imperiled the whole ﬁnanci.al struc-
ture of the American nation; how
while doing lip-service to the Wilson
administra-tion’s policy of neutrality it
used all of its tremendous inﬂuence in
high places to chip away the govern-
ment’s policy and ﬁnally presented it
with a fait accompli: maintaining our
-preeminent trade position by going to
war or preserving peace at the cost of
economic dislocati-on.

The story had been known before,
but it had been rumor, conjecture, rag-
ged bits -of evidence. Now it was un-
folded for the sworn record.

Great secret pressure had been con-
stantly applied against the Nye com-
mittee, but now lobbyists, congressmen,
newspaper owners, ﬁnanciers turned
the heat on in full.

On January 15, 1936——after the
House of Morgan had been on the grill
for several days—-—Senator Nye in a
newspaper interview declared that he
had documents which proved that Pres-
ident Wilson contrary to his statements
before a Senate committee in 1919, had
had knowledge as early as 1917 -of the
secret treaties among the Allies. The
point of this was to show that even the
peace-minded Wilson was consciously

driven into the war because of the eco-
nomic stakes of the United States.
Knowing of the secret treaties he could
not have had any illusions about the
war aims of the Allies.

Wilson had falsiﬁed.’ That was the
opening that the foes of the inquiry
the foes of neutrality legislation, the
friends of the House of Morgan, the
exponents of the proﬁt system had been
awaiting. On January 16, the next day,
Senator Connally of Texas began a
long oratorical attack upon Nye for
dishonoring the honorable dead. Skil-
fully interwoven with emotion at the
desecration of Wilson’s name was the
statement that the committee had long
ago overstepped its boundaries; the in-
quiry should end immediately. It had
no purpose anyway. It didn’t matter
that no one answered the Committee’s
charges or denied the evidence. Under-
neath the sarcasm and eloquence was
hate———deep hate focusing on the in-
defatigable Nye, who had become the
symbol of the struggle against war in
the Senate.

WENT to the Capital for the Amer-
ican Student Union to interview
Senator Nye on behalf of the students
of America who sense in him an ally
in their action against war. When I
arrived in Washington I went around
to see some friends. Newspapermen,
old residents, officials said the tension
had never been so great since the W/Iorld
War. Senators who had opposed the
World War declared that at that time
they were in daily fear of their lives, of
actual physical assault. It hadn’t gone
so far yet, but otherwise, the emotion,
the hatred, the hysteria were as great.

Senator Nye was cordial. He appar-
ently consider-ed the student movement
a real force in his battle against the war
makers.

“What are the stakes that have rais-
ed this hue and cry against you?” I
asked.

“It’s a smoke screen to stop our in-
vestigation into the activities of the
House of Morgan. More than that, it’s

FEBRUARY,I936

a desire to embarrass existing legisla-
tive proposals for which our commit-
tee was responsible, the bill to take the
proﬁts out of war, the stringent neu-
trality legislation, the bills aimed at
the collusive activities of ship-builders
in securing government contracts.”

“What were you trying to bring out
by the Wilson line of inquiry?”

The Senator repeated several times
that th-ere was no malice involved:
“The committee had wanted to show
how helpless Wilson was without a
hard and fast neutrality policy that
would at once declare within itself and
its provisions that in the event of war,
we would discourage commerce when
such was necessary to maintain a strict
neutrality.

“At no time was it our purpose to
lay responsibility at any individual’s
door. We were striving to show step
by step the inﬂuence of American com-
merce and industry in working us in-
to a position where our going to war
was quite inevitable. The committee’s
study has revealed that whatever we
had in the way of a neutrality policy
was altered every time our commercial
interests and neutrality came into con-
iﬂict.”

Many persons to whom I had spoken
felt deeply pessimistic about the in-
vestigation’s continuation and especial-
ly about the passage of neutrality legis-
lation. Senator Nye was of a different
mind. He pointed to stacks of mail.

“The people of America have rallied
to -our defense. American Legion posts,
doctors, preachers, mothers, students,
are writing to their representatives and
sending us copies of their letters.
They’re sending money with which to
continue the inquiry.”

Even while I was in Washington it
seemed as if Senator Nye’s optimism
about the continuance of the investiga-
tion was to be borne out. The fate of
his legislation was an-other matter. It
will be easier to sabotage the latter than
the former —- unless all of us apply
constant pressure.

We got to discussing the tremendous
popular interest in the inquiry, reflect-
ing the public’s anxiety about not be-
ing involved in another war. We talk-
ed about methods that the plain peo-
ple h.ave for making themselves vocal.
I mentioned the strike.

“You bet it’s a good thing,” he in-

terrupted vigorously.

“Even though college presidents
don’t like it .and don’t like the word?”
I mildly intervened.

“I don’t care what you call it—it’s
the spirit that counts.”

My next question was on the Oxford
pledge.

I remembered Senate Report 729 on
the War Proﬁts bill made by the Sen-
ator in which he had made it plain
that they did not want to change the
economic system even under pretext
of a war emergency. The Oxford
pledge, however, is a declaration that
if our government and system do in-
volve us in another war, that govern-
ment and system are no longer deserv-
ing of our allegiance.

I was gratiﬁed then when the Sen-
ator declared that he “decidedly ap-
proves” of the student attitude implicit
in the Oxford pledge. To explain him-
self he went on:

“If a system wrapped up in indi-
vidual selﬁshness allows itself to go to
war the government that lets that sys-
tem function in that way is hardly de-
serving of conﬁdence.

“I have differed with some of you
regarding one phase of your effort, al-
though I may be entirely wrong there.
I don’t think it is good judgment for
men to say that under no circumstances
will they ever go to war again, because
we can’t see all those circumstances. . .”

My mind returned to Report 729 on

11

the War Proﬁts Bill. Were students
showing less good sense, less practical
judgment in thus affirming their stand
in another war than Mr. Baruch who is
quoted in this report as objecting to
the War Proﬁts Bill as “an attempt to
change our economic system—to take
advantage of the war emergency to
shift us over suddenly to some radical
form of government economy?” Were
they considering another war less real-
istically than Big Business which is
quoted in the same report as follows:
“Limiting individual incomes to a net
income of $10,000 will, the committee
has been told, tend to dampen the ardor
of some industrial managers. A nation
at war needs the fullest cooperation of
industry and while industrial manag-
ers are willing to cooperate through
patriotic motives, the opportunity of
making proﬁts plays a large part in
giving edge and intensity to their ef-
forts.” If industry and ﬁnance are
thinking so realistically of what they

. will do when the next war comes, why

shouldn’t we, I wanted to know.

As for “seeing all the circum-
stances,” I objected that that was an-
other version of the Hearst bogey that
we were in danger of invasion. To
which Senator Nye candidly replied:
“I concede it is utter hypocrisy to
contemplate such an attack.”

I pointed out how the Oxford pledge
and the student strike reﬂected realiza-

When I was young and immatuah

I was very, very radical just as you are.

I went to demonstrations and upheld free speech;
On the slightest provocation I’d sedition preach
But expressed this grave sedition so judiciously
That I now administrate this university.

If the freedom of the press were ever infringed

My liberal mind became quite unhinged.

I’d circu-late petitions and make statements pro- or anti

And consign the Board of Trustees to a place described by

Dante.
But these acts were all achieved so surreptitiously
That I now administrate this university.

At -the slightest diminution of democracy

The entire student body would appeal to me.

I would elevate the banner of the lower middle-classes

And declare my sole objective was the welfare of the masses.
These objectives were disguised to such a high degree

That I now administrate this University.

If news of some injustice ever came to- light,

I would never sleep a wink till things had been set right.

I would organize committees to investigate affairs

Which enormous crowds of people said was no concern of

theirs.
These committees all reported so innocuously
That I now administrate this University.

As years went by my enthusiasm cooled;

More profound consideration every action ruled.

Before umping to conclusions I would think things over ﬁrst,
And very soon began to side with William Randolph Hearst.
This United Front has since been such a help to me

That I now administrate this University.

So students all, whoever you may be,

If you’d form a Student Union just take a tip from me.
Disguise subversive action like a sugar-coated pill

-—And refrain from taking action on the Nye-Kvale Bill
In fact refrain on every opportunity,

And perhaps you too, will some day help administrate with

me.

Academic Napoleons No.1 .- Ruthven of Michigan

By CLIFFORD McVEAGH, THE FIRST IN A SERIES

HEN Dr. Clarence Cook Little
Wwas summoned to the presidency
of the University of Michigan in 1925,
he was heralded as the youngest man
ever to hold that office. The Board of
Regents had called him; Dr. Little
came with energy, imagination and a
genuine zest for his task. The inhabi-

tants of the campus, proud of their

new buildings, were impressed by the
imposing appearance and reputation
of the new president. They seemed de-
termined to cooperate with him in the
new, ambitious schemes which he was
evolving. This early impression of har-
mony soon disappeared. Dr. Little was
too radical for the Athens of the West;
he antagonized almost everyone. The
Catholics objected to his frank state-
ments a-bout birth control. Episcopal-
ians were shocked by his unhesitant
discussion——-in their presence———of‘ the
nature of the Soul. These were not his
only foes. The fraternity students, on
the other hand, found him too puritan-
ical and paternalistic in his crusade to
curb drinking and wild parties. They
were even more disgruntled by his ban
on automobiles———induced by the rising
number of accidents and the declining
level of scholarship. Ann Arbor’s nu-
merous landladies and restaurant pro-
prietors feared the system of men’s
dormitories which President Little was
seeking to introduce. Undoubtedly the
most effective opposition, however,
came from the older faculty and ad-
ministrative circles where deep-seated
conservatism resisted p r o p o s e d
changes in the college -organization.
His plans frustrated on every side, his
vigor dimmed by the restraining at-
mosphere of the campus, Dr. Little
surrendered. By 1929 he was compel-
led to resign.

The Regents, in searching for a suc-
cessor, were fervently determined to
avoid so embarrassing an error. They
found their man in the Department of
Zoology, rescuing him from his labor-
atory and suddenly projecting him in-
to the seat which Dr. Little had va-
cated. The zoology professor was Alex-
ander G. Ruthven.

Prior to his appointment, Dr. Ruth-
ven had been almost unknown in the
university. Perhaps the only marks of
distinction which gave him any prom-
inence were his horse-back riding, and
his snakes; beyond that he was mere-
ly another scientist whose renown, if
such there was, did not extend beyond
the walls of his work-room. Dr. Ruth-
ven had been advanced to an admin-
istrative position, then catapulted to
the president’s chair—~and the campus
was still bewildered and somewhat dis-

‘ appointed. After the dynamic, colorful

Dr. Little, Dr. Ruthven seemed neither
interesting nor imposing. He left no
profound impression. One thing was
swiftly evident, however: he had ﬁrmly
resolved to escape the missteps of his
predecessor. Dr. Ruthven would not

"If the Regents so desired. they
could pass a rule keeping out
all except red-haired boys
with one eye. There is no ques-
tion about authority."

—Dr. Alexander G. Ruthven

rock the boat with new programs; he
would uphold the dignity of his posi-
tion——and, with the laborious exacti-
tude of a good scientist, learn the nice-
ties of politics. This was a solid, reli-
able, undistinguished man in whom the
Regents had placed their faith.

R. RUTHVEN was, he said, a liberal.

The early years of his regime did
nothing to damage that claim. While
administrators at Michigan State, the
normal colleges, the church and city
colleges were imposing mental “disci-
plines” upon their students, there was
a notable atmosphere of liberalism at
the university. Two factors unquestion-
ably served to make Dr. Ruthven’s
early reign comparatively harmonious:
no considerable number of students did
anything sufficiently unorthodox to
merit reprisal; issues in the outside
world had not developed to the point
where cautious, “practical” liberals
must take a stand. It should be em-

phasized, moreover, that Dr. Ruth-
ven’s sympathies were undoubtedly on
the side of liberalism—at least so long
as that did not imply open hostilities
with the educational rulers. Mean-
while, cooperative restaurants, room-
ing houses and book exchanges were
achieving notable success; left-wing
groups acquired a standing; student
church societies were leading crusades
against militarism. The Spring parley,
an all campus forum, year by year re-
vealed a steady growth in awareness
and militance among students and fac-
ulty. These trends were dramatized by
such incidents" as the student May Day
visit to Detroit in 1934 and the Ward
episode that Fall when the campus was

profoundly stirred by the Athletic De-H
partment’s discrimination against its

Negro football hero.

Michigan was alive; students were
emerging from the throes of disinterest
and apathy. It was impossible to dis-
cern Dr. Ruthven’s feelings, to know
whether he felt misgivings. He was un-
obtrusive, restrained, apparently un-.
disturbed by the desire of students to
think for themselves. His addresses
rang with phrases of liberalism ;- noth--

ing that he did was ofsuﬂicient mo-‘
ment to justify or question his claim.-»

HE ﬁrst omens of repression were

precipitated by reactionary church‘
administrators, resulting in the dismis-
sal of several outspoken student pas-
tors. The principle denominations ac-
complished this by replacing the sys-
tem of independent student pastors in

“economy” moves, putting the work-

under the control of the Ann Arbor
church and pastor. There is now less
danger of independent thought and
action from that quarter. The “danger”
has been further minimized by occa-
sional veiled pressure to discourage
“united front” activities with radicals.

Dr. Ruthven’s first indication of
position occurred at the time of the
Detroit May Day incident. A group of
students had journeyed to that city to
participate in the annual demonstra-
tion of workers in the city: a riot,

14

caused by police interference, had re-
sulted in streaming headlines about
the “student radicals” from Michigan.
In response to the clamor from
Hearst’s Detroit Times and the pious
Free Press, Dr. Ruthven administered
a mild scolding to the half-dozen stu-
dents who were identiﬁed. His utter-
ance, however, was not conclusive;
there was still hope that his “public
spanking” was designed merely to si-
lence an hysterical press, rather than to
denote an abrupt change in administra-
tive policy. '

When the Ward case occurred——a
Negro athlete was barred from par-
ticipation in a game with a Southern
school—it was generally known that
the administration shared the resent-
ment of the student body. The campus
turned to Dr. Ruthven, expecting him
to speak out. He remained silent. The
beginnings of “caution” were now be-
coming plain; the racial injustice in-
-stigated by the Athletic Department
was allowed to run its course. It was
equally evident, however, that campus
feeling on social issues was running
deep. Dr. Ruthven, whether he liked it
or not—-and he probably didn’t——was
being forced’ to a position.

N THE Spring of 1935 the Republic-
an machine seized control of the
State legislature. Almost simultaneous-
ly the university administration became
aggressive in its attack on dissenters.
The National Student League had ob-
tained permission, through the usual
channels, to sponsor a lecture by John
Strachey in the Hill auditorium; after
considerable preparation had been
made, including a large outlay of ad-
vertising funds, the sponsors were in-
formed of the establishment of a new
university committee. Its function
quickly became evident. The commit-
tee cancelled the use of the Hill audi-
torium on the ground that the N.S.L.
was an “irresponsible organization”;
no credible reasons for this judgment
were furnished. A special committee of
faculty members was then organized
as a “responsible group” to arrange
the lecture; it, too, was banned from
the university because the faculty com-
mittee was not a “recognized campus
organization.” Finally, after an unbe-
lievable series of blunders by both the
administration and the sponsors, John
Strachey lectured in a dance hall off

the campus. 1,200 people jammed the
room to hear him.

The administration denied that it
did not tolerate such talks on the cam-
pus. Soon afterward, however, it re-
fused to sanction a debate between Pro-
fessor Preston S1-osson, popular history
lecturer, and William Weinstone, state
secretary of the Communist party. The
Summer months witnessed the almost
systematic exclusion of liberal and pa-
ciﬁst speakers from the campus. When
The Michigan Daily raised its voice
against the action of the administration
in the Strachey affair, the editor was
immediately censured, resulting in his
temporary withdrawal from his post.
When his successor for the following
year was appointed, the University’s
Board in control of Publications named
as editor the ‘leader of the “Hundred
Michigan Men”—a secret society de-
voted to “running the reds off the
campus.” The society, incidentally, had
only seven members; it boasted it
“could have a hundred if we wanted
to.” It need hardly be added that the
administration has received eminent
“cooperation” from The Daily this
year.

HESE events were preludes. It was
Tobvious, however, that Dr. Ruth-
ven would either have to intervene
courageously—which implied combat-
ting the furious “Red Scare” through-
out the state—-or else resolve to foll-ow
the path of reaction to its logical con-
clusion. The anti-war strike in April,
during which the Oxford pledge was
administered to a large throng on the
Library Steps, and the merry m-ock
trial and hanging of William Ran-
dolph Hearst that evening, apparently
settled his doubts. Only a man of su-
preme integrity, of vision and deter-
mination would have bucked the tide
of hysteria which ensued. Dr. Ruth-
ven was not that man; he was a zool-ogy
professor who had been elevated to the
presidency for his “saneness” and
“sound common sense.” Two days later
Alexander G. Ruthven ﬁrmly set aside
liberalism and announced, for the hen-
eﬁt of the people who matter:

“University work has been interfered
with and the reputation of the institution
has been called into question by the activ-
ities of a few professional agitators. . .

The continuance of such activitiies will
not be tolerated. . . . Students guilty of

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

such misconduct in the future may expect
disciplinary action.”-

Was this simply a gesture. to the
state legislature, about to pass upon the
university’s biennial appropriation?
Was this merely “expedient” counter-
pu-blicity? That hope was shared by
countless people within the university.
They refused to believe that Dr. Ruth-
ven was experiencing more than a con-
venient interlude of reaction between
two eras of liberalism. Again they
were deceived. This unknown zoology
-professor, meeting so critical a test
for perhaps the first time in his life,
had determined to abide by the die-
tates of those who were shaping his
future.

URING the Summer, when the in-
D surgent students were scattered,
Dr. Ruthven launched the “purge.”
Four students received word that they
would not be readmitted in the Fall;
they were, Dr. Ruthven announced,
“trouble-makers” and “it has proved
impossible to persuade you to refrain
from interfering with the university
and the work of other students.” These
students had notable academic rec-
ords; they had been identiﬁed with
constructive projects. The fact that all
were Jewish and resided in states out-
side of Michigan seemed designed to
win public supp-ort for the ousters. Sev-
eral non-Jewish students—some from
the state—were equally prominent in
these activities; they were not expelled.
(The president’s strategy may prove a
political faux-pas. I know that Joseph
Bursley, dean of men, was sent on a
novel summer errand to New Jersey,
New York City and Long Island to in-
terview prospective students, particu-
larly Jewish ones, and to explore their
interests and activities.)

To climax the “purge” and insure
its permanence, the Literary college
announcement for 1935-36 ap.peared
with a new rule that “ . . . the student
concedes to the university the right
to require the withdrawal of any stu-
dent at any time for any reason deemed
sufficient to it.” In industry that is
known as a “yellow-dog” contract. The
enlighten-ed Dr. Ruthven was learning
from his employers. .

Reopening of school last Fall saw
widespread resentment among students
and faculty. So strong was feeling

All the military student groups
that meet in schools, churches and
armories have banded together in-
to a united front organization
known as the Association of Junior
Military and Naval Organizations
of New York.

Written into the preamble of its
constitution is the slogan: “A
United Front Against Communism.”

One of its first oﬂicial actions was
to announce it was setting up “cells”
to combat “radicals” and that it is
encouraging a system whereby stu-
dents would report “un-American”
activities of teachers.

The organization, explained Wil-
liam F. Siegrist, its commander,
comprises a membership “running
into ﬁve ﬁgures,” and has 41 af-
ﬁliated units.

“All kids like to play soldier and
we help them,” the commander ex-
plained.

Good Citizens Are Made - Not Born

“We use the idea of playing sol-
diers to inculcate patriotic charac-
ter building and respect for law
and order. We give them the disci-
pline that will lead to an under-
standing of Americanism.”

Mr. Siegrist denied that the or-
ganization had any set policy of
breaking up “radical meetings” but
if an individual commander wishes
to urge his boys to do so, “that is his
business.” ‘

The organization “helps the kids
play soldiers by giving them drills,
the manual of arms and other mil-
itary procedures in addition to ath-
letic games,” he said.

“The boys carry only old riﬂes,”
he added.

“Our boys are being instructed to
report all teachers who expound
foreign-inspired, un-American phil-
-osophy and the evidence so gathered

will be presented to the proper au-
thorities for disciplinary action.”

TOY GUNS—TIN SOLDIERS

Just who is behind the current .
anti-toy-gun-tin-soldier movement?

Equally foolish attempts have
been made to suppress the tin sol-
dier.

As for toy -guns, every normal
boy goes through -the pioneer stage
when he imagines he’s a hunter, an
Indian ﬁghter or a cowboy . . .

That toy pistol of his may help
build up pride in government ser-
vice and teach him that crime does
not pay . . .

Every young boys ought to be
all-owed to play with a toy gun and
every older boy ought to shoot well
with a real gun.

Editorial in Hearst’s
New York American

against the expulsions—par.ticularly
of one of the students who had been
exceptionally popular—that Dr. Ruth-
ven was forced to readmit him; he de-
clined, however, to give any reasons.
To the petitions of others, he made a
reply which must be recorded as ‘one
of the frankest, most unabashed avow-
als of autocracy in our educational an-
nals:

“If the Regents so desired, they could
pass a rule keeping out all except red-
haired boys with one eye. There is no ques-
tion about authority.”

Indignation grows among the fac-
ulty of the Literary College. It is
aroused by the president’s usurpation
of its right to pass on expulsions. Re-
turning teachers were heard to murmur
uncomplimentary remarks about musty
ideas and medieval autocrats. At the
first meeting of the Literary faculty,
Professor Howard Jones delivered a
brilliant defense of academic freedom,
sharply raising the issues of faculty-
administration relations. Professor
Slosson seconded his move to appoint
an investigating committee. The seeds
of a collision with the university rulers
are unmistakable.

Dr. Ruthven’s new passion for dic-

tatorship has not subsided. When Na-
tional Youth administration funds be-
came available, Harold Anders-on,
Buildings and Grounds accountant, ap-
peared to introduce non-membership
in the National Student League as a
qualiﬁcation. “No member of that or-
ganization will get any money,” he
asserted. Students engaged in passing
out leaﬂets were approached by Shir-
ley Smith, secretary of the University;
he angrily demanded to kn-ow who had
given them permission to distribute
them and tried, in a physical clash, to
take them away. This was an amazing
action; many generations of students as
well as local business ﬁrms had been
ﬂooding the campus with handbills.
Mr. Smith suddenly announced that
there was a rule against “littering the
campus”; if there wasn’t one, he added,
there would be soon.

HE atmosphere of the university to-

day is as subtly repressive as a con-
centration camp. There is virtually no
avenue through which students can
safely criticize administrative policy
or discuss issues “dangerous” to the
local patrioteers.

Who is responsible? What of the

“liberal” Dr. Ruthven? He still de-
livers addresses resounding with the
credo of independent expression. He is
capable of threatening outspoken stu-
dents one week and reciting the glories
-of uncensored thought the next. It may
be that he neither determines his own
policies nor writes his own speeches;
he has mastered the amiable essential

to a college presidency———inconsistency.~

Once he was able to reenforce his lib-
eralism by recounting how radically
he had voted in a previous election,
meanwhile refraining from overtly re-
pressive acts. He a-ppeased those who
pressed for university aid in student
cooperative enterprises by pointing to
various expressions of the ‘Board of
Regents —— and repeating his radical
sentiments in private. Now the other
side——-the more inﬂuential one to a man
of ambition—must be appeased. To let
things be is not enough for aroused
reaction. The academic pursuits of a
few students and the liberties of the
entire university must be surrendered
to the howling overlords. Dr. Ruthven,
the former zoologist, the man of sci-
ence, the once methodic, eﬂicient schol-
ar, has resolved that he shall not be

sacriﬁced as was his predecessor.

“SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN.

Arthur Rothstein, formerly photographic editor of “The Columbian” at Columbia
University, set out recently to record revealing sectors of American life. These photos
are some of his ﬁndings among literally scores of “case histories” which he encountered.
We present them, not because we believe in horror for its own sake, but because they
depict more vividly than any oratory the state of an appalling segment of the nation.

Is American education too disturbed by “starving Russians” to face these realities? Will
pedagogues claim that these are “unfair exceptions”? We recommend as required reading
for them, not the outcries of professional critics but the statement of Aurbrey Williams,
national director of the National Youth Administration:

"It is estimated that from 5.000.000 to 8.000.000 young people between the ages of 16 and
25 are wholly unoccupied. . . . Almost 3.000.000 young people are on relief. Several
hundred thousand young people had to quit school last year before they had finished high
school. And last June hundreds of thousands of them graduated from school into a labor

ll

market that was greatly surfeited. . . .

The summary opposite suggests the enormous diﬂ"erence between a genuine, comprehensive
program of youth aid and a minimum concession to a crisis~ridden army. Is the Youth Act
“too expensive”? To claim that is to confess that the American system cannot provide a decent
life for its youth. Are the Tories prepared to make the admission? Nor is supporting the
Youth Act merely sentimentalism in behalf of that generation growing up in the conditions
described on this page. It represents for students the ﬁrst real hope of a measure of security.
This bill belongs to you just as it belongs to the thousands of impoverished children living in
the dark places of America. It means economic relief administered democratically, regardless
of race, color or creed.

Where does education stand? Will it join in the chorus of resolutions to Representative
Vincent Palmisano of the House Committee on Education and Senator David L. Walsh, Senate
Committee on Labor and Education, to compel joint hearings immediately? Or will it continue
to believe that the children shown on this page, their images elsewhere and the futureless
students sitting before them are all living in an age of “equal opportunity?”

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

Onward Christian Students

SPENT one day and a night at the
American Student Union conven-
tion in Columbus; with the picture of
its proceedings still very vivid in my
mind, I journeyed to Indianapolis to
the Student Volunteer sessions. The
contrast in size, personnel, backing,
delegates, accommodations struck me
at once; as the days passed the contrast
in aims and approach steadily became
more pronounced.
One cannot underestimate or deride

the work of those who prepared the
convention and exerted every effort to

insure its success. It was really ﬁnez.

men of international fame to speak to
us; every hour of each day planned to
make us have an enjoyable time. For
this one cannot thank them enough. I
might add that many students came
away ﬁlled with the wonder of it all.

But, with the exception of a few
notable speakers, there was no realism
at that convention. It was not awake to
the needs and wants of Christian youth
in America today who want to follow
Christ the Radical and not the outworn
theology of the fundamentalists. I
went to the convention as did hundreds
of others under the inﬂuence of a pro-
gram which stated that we would
“probe with ruthless realism the in-
ner character of the world’s suffering
and confusion, to appraise the new
crusading forces which are increasing-
ly conscripting men’s allegiance and
to discern through a more vivid percep-
tion of God’s eternal purpose disclosed
in Christ, His intention for our gener-
ation.”

We found no such things being d-one.
The convention was still rooted in that
generation which saw Sherwood Eddy
and his group off to India to save the
souls of the Indians. When one saw
2,000 students from almost every col-
lege in the United States in one room
not being made conscious of anything
but their personal duty to evangelize
the world (as ﬁne as that aim is), it
made one feel utterly sick.

Ten of us somehow drifted together;
we spent most of our time after the

By NANCY BEATTY

second day trying ﬁrst to see what was
not in the conference and if there was
some way in which we might help the
leaders see that they weren’t getting
to the heart of the student’s needs and
wants. The third day we made out some
recommendations to hand out in four
seminars to see how interested they
were in those things upon which they
had expounded. When most of the
leaders said no such papers were al-
lowed, we handed them out outside.
We asked to have a meeting in a hotel
on the afternoon of the 30th. We call-
ed it the “Modern Issues” group. It
was not an anti-convention meeting; it
was simply a group which felt that
more should be done. The crowd over-
ﬂowed the room; the session lasted for
three hours. The recommendations
were read, discussed and voted upon.

That night, after the watch service,
we made 1,100 copies of the new rec-
ommendations. We planned to hand
them out after the morning service and
people were stationed at each door.
One ofﬁcial insisted that we were at-
tempting to “ruin the conference”;
when we offered to discuss the situa-
tion with him, he refused. It was later
indicated, however, that there would be
a place allotted for our recommenda-
tions. At 2 o’clock when the meeting
reassembled we handed out our pro-
posals; they -of course tried to prove
that we had casually thought of them
in a minute’s time——when actually we
have all discussed these questions for
the last two years, at least in our own
groups.

HE chairman proceeded to explain
Tour purpose, which was to include
those contemporary problems most
vital to us and which we must dis-
cover and face and deal with before
we ever get into the realm of service
on foreign soil. A speaker then rose
to support the recommendation, em-
phasizing that the rest of the student
world was waiting for an answer from
so large a convention on issues con-
fronting students. Then a Reverend
who had presided over the convention

session denounced as immature our
attempts to put some really crucial
questions before the convention. And
although it looked as though our cause
was lost to the group when they clap-
ped so hard for him, he lost the re-
spect of hundreds when he ended by
saying: “Lets Grow Up.” Our only
answer to him could be: “Let’s face
realities.”

We did not accomplish much. The
fundamentalists went home self-satis-
ﬁed that they were carrying out the
laws of the Lord when they passed reso-
lutions to go save the Chinese people—-
after graduation. They never seemed
to realize that the unfair clause in
American immigration legislation is
still operative; they never suspected
that our ships in Paciﬁc Waters do
more harm now than these students
could do good in ten years. The boys
and girls who came only because it
was a nice experience went home feel-
ing that all’s right in the world if we
just do our Christian bit; a few went.
home as they came—perfectly. satis-
ﬁed.

But hundreds left empty-handed.
Boys who have seen the strikes in Ar-
kansas when Claude Williams was
thrown in jail with the knowledge
and acquiescence of Church people,
left still wondering how the power of
non-violence can wo-rk—where is this
power they talk of called love? People
who face the race problem, problems
of social justice and civil liberties on
their own campus, left asking—what
can we as Christian youth do now.
That question—what can we do now-
was most completely ignored. All of
these things occurred against a back-
ground of as appalling disinterest as I
have ever seen among students: no ﬁre
to do anything——people were not even
stirred to dislike a speaker for what he
said!

T WAS a “nice” conference. There
I were many ﬁne personalities and
rare opportunities to meet students
from other schools and lands. But it
was a discouraging picture of the un-

FEBRUARY,I936

awakened student body of America, a
supreme example of that kind of Chris-
tianity which cannot last in the pres-
ent crisis.

For many of us it was the last Stu-
dent Volunteer convention; we put our
hope in a Christ whose sermon on the
Mount, if stated in modern terms from
that platform in Indianapolis, would
have found few Christians either on

the platform or in the audience.

You ask me which way the Student
Volunteer Movement is heading. I
would say it was standing still and
very near death. As a boy from India
observed:

“Student Volunteer Movement——it is
neither student nor volunteer, and it
isn’t moving.”

It seems to me that a movement

19

which appeals to the students in the
next ten years must combine the spirit-
ual dynamic and reverence for person-
ality which the Student Volunteers
have exempliﬁed at their best and the
realistic and challenging approach to
the social issues made by the American
Student Union. Without this combina-
tion, the future for the American stu-
dent looks gloomy.

Are Student “Leaders” Leading?

AN EDITORIAL ON THE N.S.F.A. CONVENTION

HILE the American Student Un-
W ion was being formed at Colum-
bus, two other student conferences of
uncommon signiﬁcance were taking
place.-One was the session of the Stu-
dent Volunteers, so capably discussed
by Nancy Beatty in this issue. It should
be stressed that Miss Beatty’s com-
ments are not those of one who is in-
terested in destroying the Christian
student movement but of one who is
earnestly seeking to give it realism,
vitality and purpose. The Advocate re-
iterates this obvious point because there
are those who will deliberately misin-
terpret and those who will be inﬂu-
enced by distortion; we can only

' humbly second her plea for coopera-

tion between forces which, whatever
their ultimate disagreements, must
stand together at this juncture.

The other assemblage of note was
that of -the National Student Federa-
tion in Kansas City to which delegates
‘from student councils in all parts of
the country came. The N.S.F.A. is not
a membership organization; it is com-
posed only of members of student gov-
erning bodies This, of course, is an
implicit commentary. Those who are
joined in the N.S.F.A. are not bound
by any more fundamental accord than
the fact of holding oﬂice. The state of
student government in many areas is
still such as t-o prevent students from
being elected for real vital platforms
and programs. Instead we have a min-
ia-ture coalition of “party bosses”
whose prestige arises from their aﬁilia-

tion to the “right fraternity.” To recall A

this situation is not blanket condem-
nation; the condition varies enormous-
ly from place to place. It cannot yet

be said, however, that the N.S.F.A. does

represent either ideas or trends; it is

still predominantly a liaison of campus
politicians.

One cannot minimize the signiﬁc-
ance of the progressive resolutions
adopted at the conference: -to combat
Hearst’s attack, to support the Youth
Act and many other declarations of

similar spirit. The fact remains that, p

on the one crucial issue requiring cour-
age and ﬁrmness, the N .S.F.A. retreat-
ed. That was the issue of the anti-war
strike. How important are anti-war
resolutions if they do not pave the
way for the one action most vividly
associated with undergraduate insist-
ence upon peace? How valid are bold
declamations if they do not denote a
willingness to speak out when it is dif-
ﬁcult to do so? It is not difficult at this
stage verbally to oppose “wars on for-
eign soil”; it is another matter to face
the reprisals and terrorism visited up-
on the student strike by those who rec-
ognize it as a meaningful, solemn
warning to the warmakers. Until the
N.S.F.A. demonstrates its willingness
to -take a stand in the face of oppositi-on
from local administrators and their
henchmen, misgivings will endure.
Will the N.S.F.A. resist, if and when
school oﬂicials endeavor to transform
it into a “company union” as a bul-
wark against militant student effort?
Nothing that it has done thus far safe-
guards against the possibility. Cer-
tainly the tenor of the resolutions
adopted at Kansas City revealed prog-
ress, increasing awareness and signs of
hope. They do not compensate for the
dangers implicit in a body whose con-
stituents are not ﬁrmly dedicated t-o a
program but represent only the higher
levels of campus politics. And the
supreme test of the progressive reso-
lutions adopted at Kansas City will

be the extent to which they are carried
out in day-to-day activity between con-
ventions.

In the meantime, it is clear that
members of the Student Union and
those who are sympathetic to its pro-
gram can best serve the cause of real
student government by acting vigor-ous-
ly and unhesitantly in local campus
elections. The presence of so many
political stooges in campus offices is a
reflection on the entire. student body;
the utter absence of m.aj or issues from
most student elections is equally la-
mentable. We do not propose to min-
imize the gravity of student elections;
we do seek to endow them with a mean-
ing which they have only rarely had.
When that happens, a convention of
student council representatives will be
“representative” of the campus in the
best sense of the word. Whether the
N.S.F.A. as now constituted could pro-
vide the instrument for such an as-
sembly is still far from certain. That
will depend partially on the receptiv-
ity of i-ts leaders and advisors to the
inﬁltration -of progressive sentiment.
Such hospitality, too, is yet to be ade-
quately demonstrated.

Rejecting the strike was one example
of how not to give the organization a
real place in the progressive student
movement. The Student Union is eager
to cooperate with the N .S.F.A.; but we
insist that the basis for this cooperation
must be more than its loud protesta-
tions of liberalism or ambitious “edu-
cational” programs with-out corollaries
in action. The present status of the
N.S.F.A. is ambiguous and fraught
with contradictions. Its survival will
have to be based upon far more sub-
stantial foundations than have thus far
been built.

Mr. Corey, one of the most distinguished economists of the present day, will have a special page in The
Student Advocate each month devoted to a review of "The Economic Front," containing pertinent and pen-

a host of other questions bearing upon the economic destiny of the United States.

Mr. Corey will be glad to answer questions on these and related problems submitted to him by students.
He is eager to receive questions from them based upon assertions made in textbooks, theories expounded by
economic professors for private consumption, or controversial issues in any sphere of economic thought.

The Studentﬁdvocate believes that Mr. Corey's page will serve both as an invaluable reference for stu-

be of vast service to any student or teacher who is seeking to understand the disorders of the society he lives
in. The Student Advocate will be glad to accept orders for classroom use, and will endeavor to make special

The STUDENT Aovocarr

Gagging the High Schools

NEW YORK BURNS BOOKS

ITY Mr. Charles Noonan! The fact
that students are reading books
that preach internationalism distresses
him. He is the proud father of a stu-

dent at George Washington High‘

School in New York City, and when
he discovered the kind of books his
daughter was reading, he lodged a com-
plaint with the high-school history and
civics text-books committee about
“Current European History,” by J. Al-
exis Friedman.

His objection was based on the fact
that the book treated the League of Na-
tion in too laudatory a manner, and
on a picture that “gloriﬁed” Soviet
Russia. This picture, incidentally, was
not used in the text-book edition, but
in a paper-bound book which had been
recommended to the class by a substi-
tute. Its subversive content is shown
on the opposite page.

The committee, in banning the vol-
ume, asserted the view that the book
gave “unbalanced treatment to contro-
versial subjects.” Mr. Friedman, its
author, announced that he “leaned
over backward to be impartial,” and
that most of his material had come
from the Carnegie Foundation.

Dr. Donovan said his committee

‘agreed with Mr. Noonan’s letter. The

letter called the book a “cowardly” at-
tempt at influencing the pupil, and
condemned it as intending “to incul-
cate internationalism in his immature
mind and to weaken’ his affection and
loyalty for his own country.” As evi-
dence, Mr. Noonan cited the first sen-
tence in the book: “The sixteen years
that have elapsed since the World War
are replete with proof that no one na-
tion can completely detach itself from
others.” The book is about those six-
teen years.

Mr. Noonan had many more com-
plaints: the book compared the Hague
Tribunal unfavorably with the World
Court; the cover pictures show a world
in distress—alI except the Soviet Un-
ion, which looked entirely “serene,”
Stalin presiding; there is a picture of
a traveler marching toward the “Sun-

shine of Peace,” with milestones on
the road marked “World Court,”
“League of Nations,” “Kellogg Pact”
and “Locarno,” but hampered by a
ball and chains marked “Fear of Ag-
gression” and “Suspicion and Mis-
trust”; there were questions whose
fault was that they were framed to per-
mit but one answer; there were ques-
tions he just didn’t like: “What are
the main provisions of the Pact of
Paris?” and “If you had been a mem-
ber of the French Chamber of Depu-
ties in December, 1932, how would
you have voted on the question of pay-
ment by France of her debts to the
United States?” T

This is advice from a layman, in-
deed, since Mr. Friedman is a teacher
at Townsend Harris High School, and
students may well resent Mr. Noonan’s
dictatorial opinions of just what is and
what is not ﬁt for the “juvenile” mind.
It may be noted, however, that school
administrations are too often of the
same mind as Mr. Noonan, since Lewis’
“It Can’t Happen Here” and Broun’s
“It Seems to Me” were both tempo-
rarily banned in Townsend Harris, and
many other schools in the country. In
Hitler’s Germany they don’t bother to
ban books; they burn them. .

JEANNE C. ADLEMAN

RAID AT STUYVESAN T

On December 11th, 1935, a group of
students of Stuyvesant High School, un-
able to meet within the school, gather-
ed in the home of a student who
resided across the street from the insti-
tution.

They had come to hear James Wechs-
ler, editor of The Student Advocate,
address them on the formation of an
American Student Union chapter.

As the students were assembling, a
policeman summoned by school of-
ﬁcials was conferring with the Stuy-
vesant administration. A “loyal stu-
dent” was instructed to accompany the
policeman to the meeting.

Leaving the school together, they
were joined by another policeman and
the janitor of the building where the
meeting was taking place. Together

they went upstairs. Without any war-
rant, they invaded the apartment and
ordered the students to leave. The
“loyal” student took the names of those-
present. When one student refused to
divulge his name, he was immediately
searched. The police, having prevent-
ed the meeting and summarily entered.
a private home——immediately after a
conference with Stuyvesant high school
ofIicials——-cleared the apartment.

Mr. Penuska, administrative assist--
ant of Stuyvesant, awaited them.

In the presence of Mr. Wechsler, he
proceeded to check the report of the
“loyal studen-t”—sometimes called a.
“spy”-———with records of students who
had participated in the April 12th:
peace strike: a “red list.”

The report of the student spy, with-
written notations by Mr. Penuska, is
shown on the opposite page.

While Mr. Penuska questioned Mr..
Wechsler, one of the policemen loudly
threatened the boy whose home had"
been invaded, warning him that he-.

could settle this “if I had you alone.” -

These threats were made in the pres-
ence of several school officials; no one
intervened.

Sinclair J. Wilson, principal of
Stuyvesant, arrived two hours later. He
protested to Mr. Wechsler that he had-
not summoned police; he had told one
of his subordinates to call a “plain-
clothesman!” He pleaded that he had
not wanted the police to break into the
apartment; he had merely wanted them
to be present “in case a crowd gathered
in the street.” In his anxiety to shift.
the blame for the event, Mr. Wilson
presented Mr. Wechsler with a copy of
the spy report.

This case is now before the Board of
Superintendents. The American Stu-
dent Union plans to cite this and sim-
ilar disorders —- caused by repressive
methods—~as the basis for legalizing
the A.S.U. in the city’s schools. A num-
ber of prominent citizens are expected
to join in this plea, with thebacking
of leading civic organizations. Will the
school system act to end the prime
causes of disorder and conﬂict?

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

Guns Over Ohio

HE advance of militarism in the

United States, accompanied by
the unmuﬂled drums of reaction, has
descended upon cloistered Ohio Uni-
versity. After a sedate history of more
than 130 years of home and ﬁreside
education, the oldest university west
of the Alleghenies is now endowing its
student body and faculty with a labor-
atory course in “How to keep America
safe for Big Business and the Army.”
The professors have been shunted
aside; they are “debile, impractical”.
instructors for modern youth, incap-
able of providing the training impera-
tive for the subjects of a coming fascist
America. Instead this training is be-
ing disbursed by the local plutocracy
and its staff: the tried and trusty Board
of Trustees, the American Legion and
a hand-picked president, adequately
tutored in the Prussian and Tammany
tradition -of political science. The ele-
mentary course in ,“Dem-agogy and
Dictatorship” now being presented is
to be followed by practical “exper-
ience in self and mass discipline,” ac-
cording to an editorial in The Athens
Messenger — lone local newspaper,
owned by a member of the university
Board of Trustees.

That editorial served as a commem-
oration of the successful putsch en-
gineered by army and autocrat to bring
the khaki shirt and polished brass to
Athens. An R.O.T.C. unit is to be estab-
lished at Ohio University in Septem-
ber.

Its coming is not merely an expres-
sion of rampant jingoism. The fact of
its establishment, and the procedure
involved dramatize the passing of mid-
dle-class individualism from the uni-
versity.

Second and Third Reich——The era
of Wilsonian democracy and middle-
class idealism drew to a close here
with the death of President Elmer Bur-
ritt Bryan on October 15th, 1934-——a
man respected and loved as an indi-
vidual of “dynamic personality shar-
ing with faculty and students his dream
for a greater university” that would
“develop students mentally, physical-

ly and morally.” He envisaged an
institution doubled in enrollment, a
faculty tripled in size and a vast in-
crease in the value and eﬁiciency of
the-university plant.

With the appointment of Dr. 'Her-
man Gerlach James as president on
April 6th (signiﬁcantly enough, at the
height of the preparations for the na-
tionwide student anti-war action) the
new period began at Ohio. Dr. James
arrived with eminent background in
“politics,” with indisputable capacity
for demagogy: author of a book on
“Pninciples of Prussian Administra-
tion,” member of a governmental com-
mission which went to Brazil to pro-
mote “friendly relations” between the
United States and the countries of
South America, a member -of the R.O.
T.C. honorary fraternity —— Scabbard
and Blade. The man was obviously
destined to be both a high-handed ad-
ministrator and a willing, eﬂicient
handmaiden of the local plutocracy.
He vividly fulﬁlled these expectations.

Dr. James assumed oilice on July
1st, 1935. Rumors and murmurings
about the proposed R.O.T.C. were ﬁrst
heard during the Summer session. On
November 10th, the occasion of an
Armistice peace meeting at which near-
ly 400 students took the Oxford pledge,
the ﬁrst public intimation of a coming
R.O.T.C. unit was given. Up till No-

vember 19th, however, fully three
months after the early reports, no word
of the development appeared in The
Green and White, student newspaper,
nor in The Athens Messenger. It is now
evident that both newspapers were
aware of the goose-step plan long be-
fore this date. It is now plain that The
Messenger—owned by a Trustee—de-
liberately suppressed this news. There
is verbal evidence that Forest Hopkins,
editor of The Green and White, knew
of the proposed action but was intim-
idated into silence by the threat: “don’t
make any statement, it will be denied.”
That procedure was to endure through-
out the episode: veiled secrecy, “don’t
quote me, I’ll deny it in interviews,”
the rankest succession of buck-passing
tactics.

On November 19th The Green and
White broke its silence, after a long
series of inquiries and statements. It
carried a declaration by Dr. James
under the headline: “R.O.T.C. RUMORS
FALSE, JAMES SAYS MONDAY.” It con-
tinued:

That arrangements have been made to
establish an R.O.T.C. unit at Ohio Uni-
versity was emphatically denied last night
by Dr. Herman Gerlach James.

Dr. James did not understand, he in-
dicated, why various groups and individ-
uals on the campus should become aroused
concerning the establishment of an R.0.
T.C. unit when no conﬁrmation that such
a. unit would be established had been is-
sued by the administration. . . .

“Should the administration be faced with
the decision of whether to establish an
R.O.T.C. here, we would do that which we
felt would be for the ultimate good of Ohio
University,” he added.

That seemed to settle the matter.
Comment, discussion, rumors ceased.
Everybody appeared satisﬁed. Had not
the president of the university public-
ly set at rest any fears that an R.O.
T.C. was to be established? Had he not
indicated that the university was mak-
ing no attempts to bring in the army?
There was general relief; the campus
was restored to harmony.

Double Charge—Imagine the be-
wilderment of the student body upon
its return from Christmas vacation. A

FEBRUARY,1936

special, green edition of The Green and
White awaited them, announcing in a
ﬁve-inch headline: “R.O.T.C. ESTAB-
LISHED AT OHIO UNIVERSITY.” It went
on to report:

Word was received today from the U. S.
War Department by Dr. Henry G. James
approving the establishment of a Senior
Reserve Oﬂicers Training Corps unit of
Ohio University to begin operations in Sep-
tember, l936. “Negotiations with the War
Department for an R.O.T.C. unit had been
under way for several months,” Dr. James
said.

Dr. James further declared:

Mr. Gordon K.Bush,trustee of Ohio Uni-
versity and publisher of The Athens Mes-
senger, is entitled to the credit of having
conceived and promoted the original idea.
I may say that as soon as the matter was
brought to my attention I gave complete
and unqualiﬁed endorsement to the propo-
sition on the ground of its value to Ohio
University to say nothing of other more
altruistic considerations.

In sycophantic support of the ad-
ministration, the editor of The Green
and White gallantly printed an edi-
torial declaring that “. . . the university
has taken another step forward as a
modern educational institution.” Echo-
ing the w-ords of the president, the edi-
tor asserted that “there is no sugges-
tion of regimental or dictatorial coer-
cion”-——because of the “voluntary” na-
ture of the corps——“which should ap-
peal strongly to liberal groups on the
campus.”

And ﬁnally this classic of pandering
undergraduate journalism:

The unit will provide Ohio University
with additional opportunity for students
in search of a truly liberal education . . .

Counter Charge ——Then the storm
broke. The ﬁrst attack against this au-
tocratic, underhanded technique of
imposing militarism on the university
came from the local clergy, six minis-
ters and one religious worker meeting
immediately after the announcement
and adopting a vigorous protest reso-
lution. Three members of The Green
and White editorial board resigned in
protest against the stand of the editor,
stating:

We feel that the principle of the R.O.
T. C., whether voluntary or compulsory, is
in direct conﬂict with the best interests of
the university and the student body. The
Green and White, as the oﬂicial organ of
the student, is violating a trust to the

student body by supporting the establish-
ment of an R.O.T.C. . . .

be allowed to enjoy it himself.

The Scientiﬁc Method

( The following questionnaire was circulated in a political science class at
the University of Kentucky. The “impartial” phrasing of the statements
might be termed a valiant example of the scientiﬁc method. More skeptical
souls may protest that this is one way of “spotting” radicals by academic
routine —— and of further indoctrinating anti-radicalism in those who are
taught to believe that “only the ignorant and incompetent”
want social change.)

PUT A CHECK MARK IF YOU AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT
PUT A CROSS IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT

Both the evils and the beneﬁts of communism are greatly exaggerated.
. It is only the ignorant and incompetent that want communism.

. The whole world must be converted to communism.

Workers can hardly be blamed for advocating communism.

. Communism is a much more radical change than we should undertake.
. Police are justified in shooting down the communists.

. Give Russia another twenty years or so and we’ll see that communism

. If Russia today is a sample of how communism works, we don’t want it.
9. Communism should be established by force if necessary.
10. The communist may be rough but he has the right idea.
11. I am not worrying, for I don’t think there’s the slightest chance that
communism will be adopted here.

12. The communists are the most destructive element in our civilization.
13. Communism is the solution to our present economic problems.

14. We should -be open-minded about communism.

15. The ideals of communism are worth working for.

16. I am not sure that communism solves the -problems of capital and labor.
17. The whole communistic scheme is unsound.

student council, comprising all the re-
ligious organizations on the campus,
attacked the R.O.T.C. The Ohio Uni-
versity Student Committee Against the
R.O.T.C. was formed; it has worked
in steady cooperation with the church
grou-ps. Sermons were delivered in
local churches conderrming the move.

Here were the people of the com-
munity aligned with the students: their
enemies likewise crossed educational
lines.

Sherwood Eddy, then in the State,
rushed to the scene to address a pro-
test meeting of 800. Challenging the
local ﬁnancial overlords, he asserted:

. . . There is a drive today across this
country and throughout the world toward
war and fascism. The best way I know to
aid in these two drives would be to estab-
lish a voluntary R.O.T.C. here. First make

it voluntary, then compulsory. On the Pa-
ciﬁc Coast as soon as anyone asks for peace

and justice, he is immediately called “com-
munist.” That’s the tactic. That’s the meth-
od of Hitler and Mussolini. . .

A1 Hearst Behind a Bush-——Eddy
picked up a copy of The Messenger
which editorially cried on January 9:

From hotbeds of communism in this
country clever propagandists worm their
way through the masses and poison minds,
young and old. . . . The college campus
seems to be a fertile ﬁeld. Youthful minds
are sown with discontent. . . . They de-
nounce war, refuse to display the Amer-
ican ﬂag, decry capitalism which employs
their fathers, and in general raise hell. . . .

The hysteria was being unleashed.
No matter that Eddy declared: “I be-
lieve the faculty ought to have some-
thing to say. I believe the students
ought to have something to say.” The

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

Still Sweetness and Light  

PROFESSOR D. E. MARTIN STUDIES HIS “BACKWOODS” COLLEGE

ALVIN COLLEGE is a small slum-

bering institution in Illinois. It is
surrounded by drab industrial com-
munities whose inhabitants echo in
every detail the tiresome monotony of
their toil. If there is signiﬁcance to
what I write about Calvin, that is be-
cause the school is far more typical
than generally conceded, -because these
“backwoods” of learning are not fre-
quently explored, because its proce-
dure mirrors the atmosphere of scores
of schools in this area and, no doubt,
in other sections of the country. There
is no sensational story to be sent from
here; there is no startling news to be
despatched about student activity. The
fact of dullness, of inertia, of isolation
is far more conspicuous than any
brief interludes of awareness.

Reports ﬁlter through to us of “rad-
icalism” in the colleges. Where, oh
where is it? Certainly there have been
changes here; but they are obscure, al-
most indiscernible compared to the
major upheavals of the world outside.
The press brings us disclosures of stu-
dent “thought,” of departure from ﬁx-
ed patterns, of a desire to think and act
aboutnthe turbulent currents of present
day society. Where is this “thought”?
Where is this consciousness? We have
not seen it; we have heard perhaps the
ﬁrst subdued m—urmurings—and they
are almost inaudible. Those of us who
are concerned with these aifairs—
there are a handful of us——-cannot visu-
alize the spread of dissatisfaction and
curiosity. We are waiting for it; now
all that surrounds us is a quiet, al-
most self-satisﬁed stillness.

TEACH at Calvin. Perhaps I should
_ begin by citing its not inconsider-
-aible attributes. Although I am an
avowed socialist and am now some-
what restricted, for six years I spoke
freely inside the classroom and out.
On political and economic subjects I
should say that more freedom exists
here than at such institutions as Ohio
‘State and the University of Illinois;
this is due largely to the religious con-

victions of the administrators who are

still generally tolerant of unorthodoxy
in most departments—except the Bible.
Having as yet received no substantial
gifts from industrialists of the vicinity,
they are governed primarily by the de-
crees of the Church; to my knowledge
the president has even defended radical
faculty members against local red-
baiters. One of the most popular pro-
fessors is Seldon, political science, a
thoroughgoing fundamentalist in re-
ligion but consistently left-wing in his
teaching. The administration has even
allowed — cautiously —— such men as
Norman Thomas and" Kirby Page to
speak in chapel. In this tolerance of
political heresy, in this presence of at
least one radically-inclined church
leader on the faculty, Calvin has open-
ed its doors to non-conformist doc-
trines.

These, I have said, are genuine vir-
tues. Beyond them, however, the theo-
logical tradition lays a heavy, stiﬂing
hand on dissenting activity. The re-
ligious atmosphere deeply enshrouds
the college; it is a force of inconceiv-
able proportions. None of the leaders
other than Seldon makes any effort to
contrast capitalist ethics with Christian
teaching; they stress personal salva-
tion and leave social salvation to the
Republicans. One of them has frequent-
lyqcomplained to the presiden-t that I
am “upholding red Russia” in the
classroom; another mournfully attacks
Roosevelt as “too radical,” protesting
that he interferes with “legitimate busi-
ness.” Most of these men are likeable,
considerate as colleagues——-and in poli-
tics they are conservative, indiﬁ'e.rent
or poorly informed. There is an eco-
nomi-cs professor who conﬁdes to me
his dislike of Roosevelt——because he is
“stirring up the class struggle.” There
is a biology professor who solemnly
informed me that reform can come
only through eugenics; heredity, he
swears, is 75% of a man’s destiny;
laziness, he is convinced, through the
genes is handed down from father to
son. There is the Bible teacher who as-
sures me that war can, upon occasion,
he an utterly Christian enterprise.

I could recite the roll-call endless-
ly; they are honest, usually complac-
ent men with virtually no conception
of immediate reality. Some deliberate-
ly avoid it; others simply don’t know.
There is another economics professor
who, while conducting a course in fas-
cism, socialism and communism last
year, steadfastly barred any discussion
from the classroom—for fear that some
students would -propagandize from the
Left! He proudly boasts of his “im-
partiality”; I believe that he is almost
convinced of it; his students inevitably
seem to leave school converted to the

divinity and permanence of capital-_

ism. My most severe critic is the arts
professor, an ardent European travel-
ler; after a searching visit through
Italy, he returned to assure us that the
land of fascism had immeasurably im-
proved, that Mussolini clears away
slum dwellings—with a snap of his
ﬁngers——just like that! This man--—
Wishart--—believing that I am “detri-
mental” to the college, has endeavored
periodically to depress me into si-
lence. More than any one on the fac-
ulty, he influences the president’s de-
cisions; it is he who keeps my derelic-
tions fresh in the president’s mind:
“Martin praises Russia in speech class-
es, where politics has no place; Martin
is upsetting the parents through inﬂu-
encing the students; Martin is giving
the college a bad reputation . . . ”
Several years ago I appeared at a
meeting of the local council to protest
against an impending gag-law. With
the aid of the ministerial union, the
protests of liberals and radicals and
the efforts of a liberal lawyer, the
measure was defeated. I was immed-
iately identiﬁed with the local commu-
nists, whose meetings the police chief
wanted suppressed; the communists,
so rumor said, had employed me as
their spokesman to the council! There
were some protests from the alumni
against my action; it was Wishart who
most strenuously attemptedto assure
the president of my “dangerous be-
liefs.” To be fair to him, I must state
that he does not want me discharged

FEBRUARY,1936

unless I persist in reiterating my be-
liefs as I have in the past; he would
graciously furnish me the alternative
of a digniﬁed, unbroken silence.

These are the men who teach at Cal-
vin. Probably thir.ty are conservatives;
three might be called socialists; two
are liberals. The views of the older men
never seem to alter. With wearying
sameness, they recite the same faiths
and illusions, they worship the same
gods, they resist new frontiers. The
president? He is on the whole a toler-
ant, fair man. These are abstract vir-
tues when conﬂicts multiply. Now he
gradually yields to the reactionary
views of Wishart and other leaders of
the faculty. He will defend me and the
other radicals to a certain pointgbut his
resistance is ebbing, the reactionaries’
power grows. I ﬁnd it no longer pos-
sible to try to correct garbled reports
which he has received about me. I ﬁnd
that he remembers the charges against
me and forgets all that I say in defence.
Certainly his inclinations are toward
academic freedom; I have dwindling
hope, however, that he will_be able to
hold out against the fascist hysteria
spring-up among the faculty and
among alumni patrioteers. Gradually
reaction is seizing command; almost
imperceptibly, Wishart and his cohorts
are propelling the president to the side
of entrenched orthodoxy.

HE curriculum allows for scant
Tcorrelations with pressing social
or economic problems. The president
has criticized me for discussing such is-
sues in speech class. He asserted that
the students should have -a course in
social .theories—afrter which discussion
in class should not be encouraged. The
economics curriculum ﬁrmly assumes
the perpetuation of capitalism; the
possibility of change is remote, unmen-
tionable. When the economics profes-
sor criticized the debaters for their ig-
norance of economics, I countered by
suggesting that he introduce a course
in Marxian economics. To this, being a
fair man, he made no reply. The his-
tory courses lay li.ttle stress -on eco-
nomic factors; the advanced language
courses allow for no study of present
day Spain, Germany or France. There
is no course in marriage; there is no
department of sociology; there are, of
course, no classes in social service. Is
this contemporary education? It is hol-

low and lifeless, without bearing upon
reality, animated by no zest for learn-
ing nor social betterment. It is anchor-
ed to the past, with no feeling of the
present nor urge toward the future.

That is the setting to which 500 stu-
dents come for “higher learning.”
Most of these students are poor. One
dominant group consists of the chil-
dren of religious families who regard
Calvin as a place of “good inﬂuence
and settled traditions.” The other com-
prises students from surrounding in-
dustrial communities, many of whom
speak ‘languages other than English at
home, many of whom are the sons of
workers.

These students are serious, natively

intelligent. They want to learn. They

endure real hardship to attend college.
But they are blocked by a terrifying
ignorance of social and economic ques-
tions, an ignorance that yields to the

pressure of cruel experience as imper-

ceptibly as a glacier yields to the pres-
sure above  Six years of depression
———and these students seem little more
aware of the danger of fascism, of the
decline of the existing order than did
their predecessors of the boom period.
I can hardly tell them apart.

I think of two students, John Oberly
and Henry Falker. These boys are sons
of workers; they have suﬁered terribly
from the economic system; their fath-
ers have lost their jobs as open hearth
workers; Oberly’s dad inherits a pain-
ful limp from industrial experience.
They should be resentful, eager for
change, curious about the cause of
their plight and anxious to remedy it.
Instead the ancient illusion still grips
them. They cherish the prospect of ris-
ing out of their own social class—rath-
er than helping the working class as
a whole to break the chains of profit
slavery. And their fathers? They are
fearful, repressed, discouraged; they
are attuned to their own status and
are ambitious only for their children.
But the children simply do not know
what is happening. I taught these boys,
I repeat, a decade ago; their names are
dilferent but their responses, their vain
aspirations, their naive hope remains
unshaken. Misery and suﬁering have
only emphasized their day--dreams.
Education has done nothing to shat-
ter them. The middle class students,

Are Liberals Immune?

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN JOSEPH P. LASH AND A STUDENT COUNCIL
MEMBER OF CONNECTICUT STATE COLLEGE

My Dear Mr. Bednarz:

HANK YOU for your very earnest

and conscientious letter. We shall
try to reply in the same spirit. If we
continue the correspondence, it is not
because we hope to make you a con-
vert to radicalism, but because we be-
lieve you are reading things into the
program and purposes of the American
Student Union which are not there and
because we still believe that your place
is in the American Student Union.
Your reaction is unquestionably that of
many others who tend to judge us by
the programs of the former Student
League for Industrial Democracy and
Nati-onal Student League rather than
by our own.

The basic question you raise is
whether one who earnestly believes in
the possibility of improving capitalism
can function in the American Student
Union without betraying that belief.
When you state that capitalism should
be improved, we take it you are ap-
proving -of those immediate planks in
our program which if achieved would
certainly improve present-day society
——planks concerned with the attain-
ment of permanent peace, the winning
of greater economic security for the
student, the democratization of educa-
tion, the combatting of racial preju-
dice, the ﬁght f-or academic freedom
against the Hearsts. Some of us remem-
ber your enthusiasm in the program
committee for these planks, so there is
no quarrel there. You appr-ove of these
objectives, but you think their achieve-
ment is compatible with capitalism. So-
cialists and communists also are striv-
ing for these ends, but they assert their
attainment t-o be impossible under cap-
italism. We are concerned here not with
the question of which is right, but
whether the American Student Union
program takes sides on the question.

We believe we interpret the program
of the American Student Union cor-
rectly, as well as the spirit of the dele-
gates at Columbus, when we state that
the American Student Union does not
declare either to be correct, but pro-
vides a common ground in which the
matter can be put to test.

January 7, 1936

My dear Mr. Lash: Connecticut State College

I want to explain that it was due to misunderstanding that I was elected
to the National Executive Committee. I declined my nomination to the
Chairman, and later, when I learned my declination was mislaid and I had
been elected to the National Executive Committee, I handed in my resigna-
tion to Mr. George C. Edwards. He asked me to allow him to leave the mat-
ter for recognition until he returned to New York. I thought his reasons for
this request were just so I agreed.

I consider this letter an affirmation of my previous desire and stand re-
signed from the National Executive Committee of the American Student
Union.

The reason for my resignation and position is simple. I am not ready to
accept a movement which has for its fundamental principle the aim to over-
throw the present social order and to put in its place a new one. I am still
on the “fence,” and still believe that our present order can be made to work.
My liberal tendencies center themselves around improving capitalism. Feel-
ing this way, I would, indeed, be a traitor to your cause and to my philosophy
if I tried to reconcile these two incompatible philosophies. This does not
mean that I will never change. Whether or not I change, future circumstances,
which now I cannot foretell, will determine. This does not mean, also, that
I will report the Convention unfavorably. My original purpose in attending
the Convention was to secure information for an objective report—I will
carry this through to its logical conclusion. I intend, also, to recommend the
Union to radical students. I

It is my feeling that the American Student Union has failed to make suf-
ﬁcient compromises in order to enlist persons like myself. This is because
the leadership of the American Student Union favors a basic social change
rather than an improvement of our present system. Mind you I do not be-
lieve that you can compromise on this fundamental issue—-if you did the
whole character and identity of your movement would be completely altered
and you would end up with a new animal. Your task is simply to try to
convince students of my position to believe what you believe, and to ﬁght
reaction which is against you.

I have tried to state my present position unequivocally. Meanwhile I
should like to maintain some sort of contact with the progress of the Amer-
ican Student Union because my interest in all progressive movements re-
mains as strong as ever.

Yours very sincerely .

Only by handing together and striv-
ing for the immediate objectives out-
lined above can either the radicals or
enlightened capitalists be proven right.
Experience, experimentation, action
can be the only tests of two such hy-
potheses which mutually exclude one
another. Part of the problem is the dis-
covery of a crucial experiment which
will verify one of these hypotheses.
The American Student Union provides

that crucial experiment. It takes every
student who wants peace, freedom, se-
curity and by actively striving for them
will prove whether the proﬁt system
is or is not compatible with those ends.
You and the A.S.U. are against militar-
ism in education, against retrenchment,
jingoistic teaching, loyalty oaths, etc.
Therefore, let us go to state legislatures
some of which are controlled by the
Democratic Party, some by the Repub-

FEBRUARY,l936

lican Party (both of them representa-
tives of the capitalist system) and ask
them to carry out our program which
you and we believe an elementary, rea-
sonable one. Let us go to the various
holders of power in American society
such as the press, the administrators of
our school system, the Congress and
present to them these same needs. The
response of these groups should pro-
vide us with the answer that we seek.
The program of the A.S.U., however,
does not take a stand on the question
you raise.

The program does condemn an “in-
ner oligarchy of high ﬁnance, industry
and politics” for our plight. You will
admit that we are in a mess, and you
will concede that the mess can be
traced to causes. But when the A.S.U.
accuses an “inner oligarchy” it is us-
ing the language, not of the socialists
and communists, but of the liberal New
York Post, which is supported by cap-
italist advertisements, of the LaFol-
lettes and western agrarians, who still
rally to President Roosevelt, of Epic
and the American Federation of Labor
all of whom acknowledge the evils of
capitalism and have denounced the ar-
rogant “inner oligarchy” for its re-
sponsibility in this crisis. Our condem-
nation of the “inner oligarchy” does
not imply, therefore, that the A.S.U.
“aims to overthrow the present social

order.” Nor does our statement of sup-“

port and cooperation with the labor
movement indicate such an aim. Labor
would seem to be the first to repudiate
it. No, we support the labor movement
because it has been progressive when
confronted with problems similar to
our -own, with enemies similar to our
own.

NE other point in -our program has
perhaps been the occasion for

your reading into it what is not there.
That is its emphatic statement on the
Oxford pledge. We readily concede that
this firm declaration not to support
any war declared by the United States
Government is a pause-giving one. But
the situation it is intended to meet is
a pause-giving one. If the World War
was a catastrophe to the college gen-
eration of that period, think how much
more so another would be to ours. It
would wipe us out. It would be the
end of civilization. Have governments
in their foreign policies shown any

less readiness to resort to war because
of that? Has any year since 1918 seen
war so imminent as today? Drastic
action is demanded. We must utilize
forceful, explosive methods of letting
governments know our intention not to
be drafted into another holocaust of
destruction. That is the chief purpose
-of the Oxford pledge. It reflects a prac-
tical and sane desire to be divorced
from the greatest insanity of modern
times. Even in your eyes capitalism
should stand condemned if it is unable
to prevent another war. That is the
meaning of the Oxford pledge: it serves
notice on the government that reason-
able, intelligent people will repudiate
it if it goes to war.

Why, you may wonder, do socialist
and communist students support the
American Student Union if it is not
revolutionary? It is important that you
should know, otherwise you can never
have complete conﬁdence in the A.S.U.
The Young Peoples Socialist League

and the Young Communist League do.

not want the A.S.U. to have a revolu-
tionary objective because that is the
purpose of their organizations, and
they have indicated no wish to liqui-
date themselves. If we may presume t-0
speak for them on this point, they sup-
port us because they have come to
realize that before liberals such as
yourself can be persuaded that the rev-
olutionary alternative is alone correct,
you must in daily experience see that
your own hopes for capitalism are il-
lusory. The A.S.U. for them is a meth-
od of providing you the experiments
in which you can test your beliefs on
this point. If you have conﬁdence in
capitalism you will not fear such ex-
periments.

The American Student Union has a
positive, immediate function to per-
form vital to all of us. We must repulse
Hearst and the patrioteers; we must do
everything we can toward postponing
the outbreak of war; we must strive for

27

the continuance and betterment of the
National Youth Administration. As a
liberal you should ask yourself whether
the responsibility for the ﬁght against
reaction and war is only that of the
radicals as your letter would seem to
indicate. Is it not as much yours? You
seem to believe that reaction is directed
against radicals only and that you have
nothing to lose by the victory of Hearst
and the Liberty League. That would be
a naive assumption after Germany and
Italy. The American Student Union is
an organization to protect your se-
curity and freedom as well as that of
the socialists and communists. The
American Student Union is an organ-
ization to keep you out of -war as well
as the radicals. It is your organization
as much as anyone else’s. You have a
function and place in it. Won’t you
accept it?

Our revolutionary ancestors faced a
problem of unity—-one of uniting the
thirteen colonies against the rep-ressive
acts of the mother country. Before such
radicals as Sam Adams and Tom Paine
could convince the others that their per-
spective had to be one of revolutionary
independence, a united, supreme effort
had to be made to reform Parliament
and George III. The first Continental
Congress united the colonists to make
this last supreme gesture. When the
arrogant English rulers repulsed them,
the 2nd Continental Congress under-
took a revolutionary struggle. The
American Student Union represents a
sta-ge similar to that first Continental
Congress. We are at last united, and
together we shall confront the rulers.
of American society, the inner oligar-
chy, to demand our elementary, reason-
able rights. Whether these rights will?
be granted is, we believe, a test of any"
order which its supporters should not
hesitate to face.

Sincerely,

Josspn P. LASH

Action Notes

BY THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

66 NE step forward is worth a thou-

() sand programs,” a noted polit-
ical philosopher once declared. The
remark recurred to us at the Columbus
convention when certain groups seemed
ready to prevent a gigantic step for-
ward because of sophisticated differ-
ences with the program presented. The
remark recurs to us now again in set-
ting out to write this page of notes on
what A.S.U. chapters are doing. With-
out strong chapters in every college,
without daily activities, the program
remains a sterile document. Indeed a
good program is one which itself en-
tails incessant activity and talks to
others beside convinced revolutionists.
. . . Therefore, we are somewhat in
love with our Chapter at the University
of Chicago which, two weeks after the
convention, held a meeting initiated
by a representative student committee
and presided over by the Editor of the
Chicago Daily Maroon. Three hun-
dred students attended of whom 170
signed membership cards. Only 80
among these had formerly been mem-
bers of the Student L.l.D. or N.S.L.!
That’s a good start.

Columbia has a swell device for
building the A.S.U. A booth has been
set up in the college corridors, and
every day from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
undergraduates enroll in the Union. . . .
But then New York was away ahead of
the rest of the nation in preparing
for the A.S.U. before the convention.
That’s why it had such a large repre-
sentation of student councils and col-
lege editors at Columbus. . . C.C.N.Y.
had its first A.S.U. meeting in its chap-
el attended by 800 students. George
Edwards, national chairman of the
A.S.U., reported on the convention and
doughty little Dean Gottschall hailed
the organization although entering a
caveat to the Oxford pledge. . . . The
New York district organization which
gave $50 at the collection in Columbus,
had it returned for rent when it set up
a district office (anything to get that
turbulent, incessantly mimeographing
crew out of the National Oﬂice) . . .
Chicago likewise has set up a district
oﬂice. . . . Boston not to be outdone

will do likewise. At present the 34

undergraduates organizations aﬁiliated ‘

with the Greater Boston Students’ Com-
mittee for Peace and Freedom are be-
ing polled on unanimous affiliation

with the A.S.U. ,

At Syracuse an initial meeting was
held of 50 enthusiastic A.S.U.’ers who
constituted themselves a sponsoring
committee. Syracuse was also host to
representatives from Skidmore and
Hamilton College in a discussion of

how to set up the A.S.U. on the widest
basis. . . . Other New York state notes
include one from Colgate which never
has had an L.I.D. or N.S.L., but which
already has sent in an application for
an A.S.U. charter. . . . Vassar, which
like C.C.N.Y., may have its entire stu-
dent body enroll, will let loose at the
M-cNaboe bill which calls for an in-
vestigation of communist activities and
communists in New York schools. It
would be a repetition of the Dilling-U.
of Chic-ago circus. . . . Although little
publicity was given to the meeting, 100
students showed up at the initial meet-
ing of the A.S.U. at Cornell.
Speaking of publicity, some eight un-
dergraduate sheets have reprinted the
program of the A.S.U. in entirety and
the flood of favorable edits has bowled
us over.

Wisconsin U. has run into trouble
because of name. Dean Goodnight re-
fused recognition, because of the con-

fusion that might arise with the Student
Union, a building which is the center
of undergraduate extra-curricular life.
The Milwaukee Journal exulted that
at last the liberals were being stopped
from over-running the campus. Their
exultation w-as premature. Upon sug-
gestion from the National Office the
Wisconsin Chapter changed its name
to Wisconsin Student Alliance and was
given prompt recognition. . . . Speaking
of reactionary newspapers brings us
inevitably to Billy Hearst who still is
running banner edits trying to convince
his readers that the A.S.U. is red, dis-
loyal, etc. Having read about us in
the Hearst rag, a group of the U. of
South Carolina students became inter-
ested and now are planning a chapter.
Thanks, Billy. Don’t go reading Hearst
for information on the A.S.U. though.
The boycott is still on.

Los Angeles is making strenuous ef-
forts to get a regional organization
under way. L. A. is very unhappy over
the fact that every time they spawn a
good leader and hard worker such as
Celeste Strack or Serril Gerber or
Nancy Bedford-J ones, the National Of-

ﬁce draws them away. . . . If you know

of any students or if you yourself are

planning to go to Europe this summer,
hold everything until you hear A.S.U.
plans for a grand tour which will in-
clude student conferences, discussions
with leading political personalities, the
Soviet Union, etc. ExecSec who writes
this page would like you to send him
items of interest‘ that should go in
here also photographs of A.S.U.’ers in
action. How shall we describe this
page? That demon journalist, the edi-
tor of this magazine, protests ﬁercely
against making the Advocate a house
organ, so all organizational stuff is
relegated to this page. We’ve got a
wager with the Editor, however, that
we can make this the most interesting
page in the mag but we have to have
good gossip to succe.ed. O. K., A.S.U.?
. . . The National Oﬂice is functioning
harmoniously, thank you. The eﬁicien-
cy is something terriﬁc for a goodlifer
like the compiler of this page, but
things get done. . . . If only there were
money! . . . We’re waiting for those
membership fees to begin pouring in.

your preoonvention promises.

Guns Over Ohio

(Oontiwued from page 23)

R.O.T.C.——-could only reply: “com-
munist.” It is not a Hearst newspaper;
but Mr. Bush has learned from
Hearst, belongs to the same school of
reactionary newspaperdom.

When two of the ministers went to
The Messenger to ask that their reso-
lution be printed, they were ﬁrst re-
buﬁed; later it was placed in an ob-
scure corner of the paper. When a
member of the student committee
spoke to a staff member of The Mes-
senger, he was told: “You goddam
radicals who oppose the R.O.T.C. If I
can pin anything on you, I will. Now
get out!” There is fairly conclusive
evidence to show that news su-bmitted
to the paper for Associated Press des-
patches was colored and deleted. Out
of 400 letters received by The Mes-
senger at the time, only ﬁve favored
the R.O.T.C.; the ﬁve were featured,
the others almost ignored. And “altru-
istic” Mr. Bush exclaimed persuasive-
ly:

The R.O.T.C. will enlarge the faculty
and bring more instructors to the campus.
A bigger Ohio University will help Athens’
business, which in turn will help the school.

The American Legion was swift to
spring to the aid of the patrioteers, the
“business men” and the administra-
tion. The Legion leadership boldly an-
nounced that their members unan-
imously favored the R.O.T.C., al-
though some were known to oppose it.
A resolution condemning the ministers
for “a direct insult to the office of the
president was passed.” It was sent to
the president with a request that the
Legion have the privilege of sponsor-
ing a ball to celebrate the establish-
ment of the military unit.

Faculty Fea2rs—Although a secret
poll of seventy-one faculty members
conducted by The Green and White
showed 33 opposed to the R.O.T.C., 19
in favor and 19 unwilling to take a
stand, the staff, with few exceptions,
maintained cautious silence. There
seems to be good reason for their ti-
midity—despite the paper’s contention
that it is “absurd” to fear punishment
to opponents of drill. Dr. Sias, direc-
tor of teachers training, a courageous,
principled defender of academic free-
dom, asserted:

The practice has been, ever since I have
been on the campus and that is nine years,
to have any new course of study which any
department proposed, submitted to the
executive committee of the faculty for con-
sideration and approval. When the faculty
were informed that action looking toward
the establishment of an R.O.T.C. unit on
the Ohio University campus had been taken,
they felt that they were going to be forced
to accept it. A spirit of fear seized the
whole campus. It made us feel that Wash-
ington and the War Department had al-
ready taken a strangle hold upon us and
that the spirit of compulsory training was
already here.

Protests poured in from every part
of the nation. Hundreds of letters and
telegrams swamped the president and

_ Trustees. Parents threatened to remove

their sons and daughters from the uni-
versity. Church people and alumni
warned that they would remove their
support from the school. The local
grange, with more than a hundred
members, passed a resolution of oppo-
sition to the military unit with only
three dissenting votes.

President James began to wilt. “I’m
in a pickle,” he told an interviewer
from The Columbus Citizen. “You see,
that R.O.T.C. idea is not my baby.
When the executive committee broach-
ed the matter to 'me, I had to make up
my mind quickly. I gave my approval.
I will not get into a cat and dog ﬁght
over this. It is an unfortunate affair.”

So “unfortunate” was the situation
that Dr. James was compelled to re-
tract the statement he made to The
Green and White on November 19th
in which he had denied that previous
arrangements had been made to estab-
lish the R.O.T.C. Dr. James could no
longer assure the student body that no
negotiations had previously taken
place. His duplicity was plain; the
statement in The Green and White had
been reread to him over the phone of
the newspaper’s -office. At this stage his
disavowal was an unconvincing after-
thought.

Reaction—— Finally moved by the
sweeping sentiment against this at-
tempt to introduce the ﬁne art of mur-
der into the curriculum, Dr. T. R. Bid-
dle, chairman of the Board of Trustees

_ and wealthy coal lands operator, wired

from Florida, calling an extraordinary

29

session of the Board of Trustws to re-
view the decision of the executive com-
mittee. The protesting groups asked
for a hearing. The local commander
of the Legion chimed in: “If the Trus-
tees invite or permit outsiders to pre-
sent their views on the subject, the
Legion will surely be represented.”
Trustee Bush asserted that the board
was under no obligation to hear any
of the spokesmen. “However,” he add-
ed charitably, “it may be that, in the
bigness of their heart, the board mem-
bers may consent to hear one man.” A
member of the Board was quoted as
saying that the Trustees had never
denied anyone an interview.

The Board refused to hear represen-
tatives of the contending groups.

After a secret session it was an-
nounced that “the Trustees approved
and expressed by a vote of ten to one
their appreciation and confidence in
the action of the executive committee
and authorized them to do any and all
acts necessary for the completion of
the arrangement whereby the univer-
sity may have the advantages of an
R.O.T.C. unit added to its present ac-
tivity.” The protests of citizens from
every part of the nation were to be
“ﬁled away for future reference.”

As students departed from the scene
of the meeting after hearing the ver-
dict, they discovered a United States
army limousine parked at the edge of
the campus. Investigation disclosed
that Colonels Fuller and Townsend
had arrived, presumably to “seize
command” of the situation. The colo-

. nels were seen shortly afterward, walk-

ing about in plain clothes.

The army was preparing to move in-
to the campus; its advance agents had
been despatched to insure that there
be no failure in their plans. They
would be able to wear their uniforms
the next time’ they appeared.

One hour after the Trustees bluntly
affirmed the decision of the executive
committee, the Student Inter-Church
council and the Student Committee
Against R.O.T.C. met to redouble the
campaign against the fascistic regi-
mentation of the campus, now so clear-
ly deﬁned. As I write, this ﬁght contin-
ues; it cuts deep into the heart of the
social scene here. There will not be
any truce so long as the R.O.T.C. re-
mains.

New Beginning  

HE STUDENT ADVOCATE appears in
Tan hour when independent thought
and endeavor are being curtailed on
every side. So terrifying is the onrush
of reaction, so bold are the exponents
of the goose-step that the need for an
uncensored, fearless student journal
seems self-evident. One month ago the
American Student Union was formed
because the perils and uncertainties
surrounding us dictated the establish-
ment of a single, progressive student
organization. This could not have been
realized without a profound ferment in
our sch-ools and colleges, without a
widespread departure from old faiths
and prejudices, without growing disil-
lu-sion in ideals no longer applicable
to the social scene. The Union was not
the secret mission of a handful of “en-
lightened” spirits; it was established
because thousands of students in count-
less areas are beginning t-o explore new
frontiers in search of peace and se-
curity. This Union——the first full al-
liance of progressives, liberals, and
radicals in American life—dramatized
the extent of the insurgence, its ad-
vance from narrow sects to the broad
centers of the campus. Those who are
stirred by it do not adhere to any
single set of political beliefs. They are
all animated by the hope of change, by
the vision of a sane, secure order. They
are groping for an instrument through

which their fears and aspirations may
be expressed in realistic, continuous
activity.

We believe that these thousands want
—and need—a journal which will ar-
ticulate ideas and movements identified
with the Union. We believe that there
is a ﬁrm place on the American cam-
pus for a publication independent of
wealthy Trustees, ﬁnance-dominated
administrators and an educational hier-
archy anchored to outworn traditions.
The Advocate will not be welcomed by
the Hearst press, the American Legion
oﬂicialdom nor by their host of stooges
in our midst. To the extent that i-t rec-
-ords, interprets and -advances the life
of the American Student Union—and
those progressive impulses converging
around it——The Advocate will have to
endure a storm of opposition from the

self-styled defenders of “American-

ism.” That hysteria is their confession.
To question the sanctities of the pres-
ent day———w-ar preparations, poverty,
invasions of civil liberty—is to court
the fury of interests determined to re-
sist change; to investigate the political
and economic facts of life is t-o invite
scepticism of a social order which
serves privilege so well. It is hardly
startling that our present day Tories,
so many of whom are located in seats
of educational power, resent inquiry
and honest fact-ﬁnding. They would
prefer to drop the subject and silence
the investigator.

Whatever the dismay of the “aca-
demic mind,” The Advocate will not
pay deceptive li-p-service to those
clichés so frequently invoked as an al-
ternative to decisive thought and ac-
tion : “ objectivity, ” “ detachment, ”
“pure thought.” Neither do we claim
any divine insight into truth. We do
see certain plain, inescapable dangers
in the world we live in; we shall com-
bat themuncompromisingly; we shall
betray no “impartiality,” for example,
about the choice between peace and
war confronting humanity today. One
alternative is the only road for the
great body of people: peace. The other
is the resort of a handful -of economic

rulers: war. To remain aloof from this '

struggle or to remain detached from
it is worse than illusory; it is suicide.

tion upon our part that we could not
depend on governmental agencies to
stop war but only upon our own inde-
pendent action. I stated that the muni-
tions inquiry’s evidence of capitalist
success in sabotaging laws, buying out
officials, reconﬁrmed us in this posi-
tion. He agreed.

I suggested that a Republican-Demo
cratic congress could never be depend-
ed upon to be watchdog over legislation
which involved stakes of billions. Sen-
atory Nye agreed that it was necessary
to have candidates for congress go em-
phatically on record concerning their
attitude upon the issue. Did he think
that was -possible without a third
party? “It is signiﬁcant,” he declared,
“that those who proﬁt from war have
never invited serious opposition of
either of the existing parties. The
thought has never been permitted to

become an issue between the parties.
“Why is that?” I asked him. “It may
be fear of these powerful ﬁnancial in-
terests,” he mused, “or it may be that
the love -of campaign funds is greater
than their love of the prospect of keep-
ing the country -out of another war.”

“Wasn’t a third party necessary?” I
persisted, “a party based upon the
people who are supporting the investi-
gation, the literary people, the farm-
ers, the professional classes, the young
people?”

“I still entertain the hope that one
of the two parties can be salvaged and
made to deal boldly with these issues.”
“Suppose they don’t? If the public
were to impress upon the party con-
ventions a demand for acknowledg-
ment of these issues and both parties
ignored that demand—a third party
might have exceptional opportunity in

the fall, except that that third party
might invite antagonism on the basis
of other issues.”

“What would your own attitude be
toward that party, Senator?”

“It would be very largely with a
third party effort providing that third
party were not trying to carry with it
other issues" that might embarrass the
main issue.”

I got up to go. I stopped. “Perhaps
the Senator would address a special ap-

peal to the students of America!”

“Everything I said to you is part of
that appeal. Anything you fellows can
do to help the legislation is for your
own good. I most sincerely hope that
the smoke-screen has not had the effect
of blinding students to the merit of the
investigation, to the merit of the leg-
islative program, and the tangible chal-
lenge which they are to the American
people and especially to the youth of
the nation.”

Still Sweetness and Light

being more comfortable, are still im-
bued with the idea of personal success;
perhaps a few have awakened to the
“general drama of pain” being enacted
around them and are increasingly
aware of the gulf between ideals and
environment. But the prevailing note
is one of inertia and ignorance.
There are hopeful omens. I believe
that the students would be less likely
to enlist for war today than ﬁve years
ago; in a recent ballot forty per cent

"of them voted to support no future

war. And yet I know beyond dispute
that not more than ﬁve of them have
openly declared their intention of go-
ing to jail rather than ﬁghting for God
-or country. Calvin would not offer
great resistance to conscription for
murder. Most of the students do hate
war; most of them do not want to go;
yet I fear that they can be swung into
war hysteria with very little propa-
ganda——as matters stand now. The
average Calvin student is neither pa-
trioteer nor hater of fascism. He sim-
ply feels helpless, frustrated by the
enormity of issues which he has never
been taught to grapple with. “If they
draft you, what are you going to do,”
they say to me. They can see no alter-

native; all their education is shaped
to prevent them from seeing it.

Is there any hope for the future? I
believe that it is commensurate with
the possible increase in militant union-
ism among the workers of the territory.
Those students who would naturally
turn to progressive, organized action
are demoralized by the insecurity, by
the lack of solidarity and pessimism of
their homes. The workers need to gain
conﬁdence in themselves, to become
aware of their power, to envisage a
path out of their agony and bewilder-
ment. If and when that happens, their
children will sense renewed hope, their
sons and daughters will enter Calvin
imbued with a greater passion than
they have known——and it will be a pas-
sion for enlightenment, for change, for
betterment. Meanwhile, middle class
students are being forced through im-
poverishment into industrial exper-
ience before they enter college; they
may share that vision and be animated
by it.

All these are speculations. The fact
of lethargy, of orthodoxy, or suffocat-
ing pedagogy is paramount. The time
factor assumes crucial importance in
this silent “backwoods.”

Fighting for Their Lives

Thousands of oppressed. impover-
ished tenant farmers and agricultural
workers are literally ﬁghting for their
lives in Arkansas today. Their tight
for the right to live like human beings
has won the acclaim and sympathy
oi lberals and labor——but not oi the
Arkansas landlords.

These people need help. They are
hungry: many are sick. with low phy-
sical resistance: they lack clothing.
Money is desperately needed —— for
these elementary wants. for legal de-
fense. for countless items in this bitter
struggle.

Send all aid-—money. clothing. food
—at once to Reinhold Niebuhr. treas-

conﬂict. In the educational sphere the
hostility is mirrored in the war be-
tween those who dominate the schools

and those who inhabit them, between
those who would regiment the studen-t '

into the pattern of Storm Troops and
those who would encourage him in his
quest for real learning and his ﬁght for
a better life.

The Advocate hopes to serve as the
organ of those thousands who are bold-
ly entering the arena of social action.
The editors will strive to make it as
alive, as contemporary, as exciting as
the momentous issues we are facing;
we will exert every effort to prevent it
from becoming .a stodgy organ of ad-
vanced theory. This is a dynamic era
in which events move at startling
speed; it is absurd to believe that con-
cern for these events-—-rather than for
“college life” as it was once known-
implies dullness or monotony.

This journal is not the organ of a
handful of editors. It belongs to the
student body. The function that it
serves, the extent to which it becomes
entrenched in the lives of students will
be commensurate with your interest
and aid. We want you to write for us.
We want you to say what you are think-
ing, freely and unhesitantly. This is-
sue is only a hasty beginning; we hope
by next month t-o be prepared to pub-
lish:

1. Special high school editions: de-
voting at least eight pages to the spe-
ciﬁc concerns and activities of high
school students—and written by them.

2. Literary supplements: embody-
ing the best creative talent in the school
and college. ‘

3. A host of important features,
some of‘ which are outlined on other
pages.

These things can be done -only if
those of you who are stirring to the
currents of the hour will write, frank-
ly, boldly, patiently—-with the under-
standing that a maximum of awareness
does not compensate for a minimum of
energy and effort.

The Union is a new, hopeful effort;
The Advocate is its chronicle. We hope
that it will become identiﬁed with the
courageous battalions of progress
forming in our schools and colleges
today. We believe that its place is
clearly defined in the tumultuous set-
ting of the present day.

Mellon’s Man

ERO ﬁddled while Rome burned;
Chancellor Bowman, informed
that the University of Pittsburgh had
been blacklisted by the American As-
sociation of University Professors, re-
plied: “What of it?” Despite the Chan-
cellor’s amazing imperturbability, the
decision is likely to have far-reaching
consequences. It implies a complete
moral censure of Pittsburgh’s treat-
ment of faculty members with regard
to academic freedom and security of
tenure. As a result, none of the Asso-
ciation’s 13,000 members will accept a
position at the institution nor will any
more members of its teaching staff be
permitted to join the A.A.U.P. until
conditions warrant a lifting of the ban.
The condition responsible for the As-
sociation’s action is a glaring instance
of the subordination of the interests of
education to business interests. As The
New York Times succinctly reported:
"Prof. F. E. Beutel testiiied that he went
from Pittsburgh to Tulane University after he-
lng informed that his iuture at Pittsburgh was
ruined because of testimony he had given
on how ‘the Mellon machine paid oii' after
an election. Andrew Mellon is one of the
trustees oi the University."

The juxtaposition of these two facts
speaks volumes. And the case of Pro-
fessor Beu-tel is but one of many. Ac-
cording to Professor Ralph Himstead
of the University of Syracuse:

"The almost universal testimony oi 100
professors interviewed by the committee (of
the A.A.U.P.) was that an atmosphere of
fear. intimidation and suspicion surrounds
the faculty. Not only was there supresston oi
academic expression in social and economic
issues. but ireedom of speech about admin-
istration oi ordinary University atialrs has
been suppressed."

Will Pittsburgh students say: “What
of it?”

Mr. Cantor’s Dilemma
MR. EDDY CANTOR is a comedian of

some repute; his current venture
into the sphere of “peace” agitation
will undoubtedly cause considerable
pressure for his return to the stage. It
was with surprise——-and genuine pleas-
ure—that students heard of Mr. Can-
tor’s offer to ﬁnance the college edu-
cation of a student who wrote the best
essay on “How to Keep the United
States out of War.” This was both a
provocative and unusual gesture. Mr.

The STUDENT ADVOCATE

Hearst thought so, too. He rushed a
reporter to the comedian’s home, de-
manding to know if Mr. Cant-or was
becoming embroiled in dangerous “pac-
iﬁst propaganda.” The round - eyed
thespian took the hint. Before a Hearst
editorial writer could cry “Moscow,”
a statement came pouring into the
Hearst editorial offices. It announced
that Eddy Cantor thought all this “pac-
iﬁst stuff” is nonsense. What was Mr.
Cantor’s technique for “keeping the
United States out of War”? The an-
swer was unequivocal: “Peace through
preparedness.” Those who have con-
templated entering Mr. C.antor’s contest
may ﬁnd difficulty reconciling their
views with those of the sponsor. Is the
presence of several prominent edu-
cators on the board -of judges merely
window-dressing? Or will they em-
barrass Mr. Cantor to the extent of re-
warding a student who writes a realis-
tic anti-war essay? Mr. Hearst would
brand such a decision unconstitutional.

University Sweatshops

XAMINATION of events over a peri-
E od of three years at Teachers Col-
lege, Columbia University, leads to
astonishing results. That citadel of
“progressive education” has apparent-
ly maintained an attitude towards its
employees which is more popularly as-
sociated with corporations in heavy in-
dustry than with the nation’s halls of
higher learning. According to the ﬁnd-
ings of a student-faculty committee of-
ﬁcially appointed to investigate condi-
tions in the Teachers College cafeterias,
there have been “severe and discrimin-
atory wage-cuts imposed upon the full-
time employees . practically all

. have suffered serious injustice

the workers have had a per-
centage cut at least twice that received
by members of the supervisory and ad-
ministrative staff. . . Employees
who were not rehired were discriminat-
ed against because of their union mem-
bership and activity.” It was only after
a strenuously-waged campaign -of work-
ers and students acting in close co-~op-
eration that the College administration
ﬁnally consented to the appointment
of the impartial student-faculty investi-
gating committee. Its ﬁndings were so
complete a vindication of the workers
that they could not possibly be disre-
garded. An agreement was ﬁnally

FEBRUARY,1936

reached between the university authori-
ties and the Food Workers Industrial
Union to which the men in question
belonged. By this settlement the Uni-
versity has given th-e workers nine
weeks back pay and is to re-hire them,
a notable precedent in such cases.
The victory is encouraging but not
complete. The workers have been re-
employed; not, however, at their‘form-
er jobs but on a special project lasting
only till June at lower wages than be-
fore (the wage rate however is dis-
tinctly higher). The nine weeks of back
pay by no means offset the entire loss
incurred over a period of twenty-one
weeks. There is no official recognition
of the union, which none the less has
been negotiating all along for its mem-
bers. The settlement is in other words
a full admission by the college of the
justice of the men’s claims without
a corresponding adjustment of them.
What is distinctly encouraging is the
prolonged and tea degree successful
joint effort of students and workers.

Brain Trust?

ARLO-s MARCH, delegate from the
C illegal Cuban student movement
to the Columbus convention of the Stu-
dent Union thrilled that assembly by
comparing it to one he had attended in
his own country. The Columbus dele-
gates faced minor inconveniences in
the form of blizzards, William Ran-
dolph Hearst and other natural or un-
natural elements. Cuban students faced
imprisonment and death. These facts
should be of special interest to Amer-
ican students n-ot merely through in-
stinctive sympathy with their foreign
colleagues.

No decent American can help being
ashamed and disgusted at the part
played in this situation by certain

groups in the United States. This in- .

clu-des the government, through Am-
bassador Welles and later Caﬁrey; it
also includes the universities. Colum-
bia had little reason to be proud of the
technical aid and services rendered
Machado by Professor Howard Lee
McBain. More recently Professor
Dodds, President of Princeton, per-
formed similar services for Mendieta.
It is a tragic paradox that these men
should have offered themselves to gov-
ernments whose policies have led to the
destruction of Cuban education. The

forthcoming tour of American colleges,
which Carlos March is to make under
the auspices -of the American Student
Union, should serve to crystallize stu-
dent sentiment against these “scholar-
ly” accompaniments -of imperialism.
American educators do not distinguish
themselves or their functions as the
“brain trust” for Cuba’s governments
of terror.

"This State of Things ”
" HAT man can look upon this state
of things without resolving to cast his
inﬂuence with the elements which are to
come down in ten-iold thunder and dash this
state of things to atoms."—I-‘redericlr Doug-
las in his Letters to William Lloyd Garrison.
When Frederick Douglas wrote of
“this state of things,” he was speak-
ing of the slavery of the Negro people.
Today another “state of things,” not
too different from the ﬁrst, exists. The
Negro people are literally ﬁghting for
their existence. No case has more elo-
quently revealed their status ‘ and
brought it to the consciousness of large
bodies of Americans than the suffering
and persecution of the nine Scottsboro
boys. As we write, another tragic and
disgraceful chapter in that case has
been enacted with the shooting of one

of the prisoners by an Alabama sher-

iff; whatever the precise details of the
episode——-newspaper reports are still
garbled and conﬂicting——the fact re-

” mains that this shooting could never

have occurred without the miserable
circumstances which produced the
frame-up.
The National Negro Congress, sum-
moned by a group of representative
Negro organizations embracing the
church, fraternal and labor groups,
will meet in Chicago on February 14th
and 15th. Its deliberations will con-
tribute immeasurably to dashing this
“state of things,” and arousing an un-
precedented understanding between
Negroes and whites. The American
Student Union has endorsed the con-

gress; its endorsement will be mean-_

ingful primarily in terms of the num-
bers who actually attend the congress
and the amount of student attention
focused upon it.

”R. S.V.P.”

HE American Association of Col-
lege Presidents, convening in New
York early in January, took a resolute

5

stand against the onrush of loyalty
oaths descending upon the colleges. A
telegram of greetings was sent t-o the
conference by the American Student
Union accompanied by a request for
an opportunity to present the aims and
objectives of the Union to this gather-
ing of college officials. It was sen.t in
the hope that this session, which did
take cognizance of the growth of re-
action, might acknowledge the desir-
ability of united student-administra-
tive opposition. The Association did
notdeign to reply to the request nor
in any way acknowledge the wire. We
record this simply for the beneﬁt of
those who believe that conflict within
our schools and colleges is due to the
“insobordination” of students or their
refusal to “cooperate” with officials.
The A.S.U. is still waiting for a reply
from the Association. Our enthusiasm
for its stand on loyalty oaths is im-
measurably dampened by the silence
ofthe convention to our plea. Those
who most frequently ask for “under-
standing” from their students did not
seem especially anxious to pave the
way for its realization.

British Students Unite
ENCOURAGING word from England

arrives as we go to press. John
Cripps, noted leader of British Stu-
dent action and son of Sir Stafford
Cripps, writes that the impending uni-
ﬁcation of the British student move-
ment has already spurred wide en-
thusiasm throughout British universi-
ties. The University Labor Federa-
tion, English equivalent of the Student
League for Industrial Democracy, and
the Federation of Student Societies,
which parallels the American National
Student League, have ratiﬁed an amal-
gamation pact; the meaning of the
move is essentially similar to what has
taken place in the United States al-
though, instead of setting up a new
organization, the F. S. S. is dissolving
into the University Labor Federation.
At the Cardiif convention of the latter
group, representatives of the F. S. S.
were present along with delegates fr-om

more than half the British universities-

and a large number of new, heretofore
unaffiliated groups. Uniﬁcation now
waits only upon the vote of the nation-
al committee of the F. S. S. to dissolve
that body.

FEBRUARY,1936

American Storm Troops

AN EDITORIAL

HAT opposition to the R.0.T.C.. is destined to assume
Tcritical importance in the coming months h.as been
plainly foreshadowed by a series of illuminating incidents.
The ﬁrst was the annual report of Secretary of War Dern,
a declaration whose emphasis on the R.O.T.C. caused the
Hearst press to salute its “vigorous, old-fashioned American-
ism.” To those who refuse -to perceive the reactionary,
fascist implications of the R.O.T.C., the Hearst editorial
headline is worth digesting: “Dern’s Telling Blow Against
College Reds.” Continuing in this vein, the editorial tact-
lessly envisaged the R.O.T.C. as a ﬁrm bulwark against
progressive, non-conformist thought; the long series of epi-
sodes in which campus military agents have inspired Vig-
ilante mobs against paciﬁsts, liberals and radicals was no
doubt uppermost in the mind of the editorial writer. Mr.
Dern’s report was so eloquent an elaboration of Mr. Hearst’s
traditional thesis that one almost suspects an oflicial merger
between America’s super-patriot and the War Department
has already taken place. The report described in glowing
detail his hopes for extension of the R.O.T.C. as a major
part of the unprecedented war preparations of the United
States government. It did not attempt to prove, as Mr. Hearst
still does, that the RO.T.C. is “good hygiene.” This most
fantastic of claims is probably too much for even the tough
stomachs of the war department to absorb any longer.
Whatever this minor disagreement, the love affair between
Mr. Hearst and Mr. Dern proceeds apace; if allowed to
ﬂourish unchecked, it will unquestionably produce a veri-
table army of Storm Troops. -

Three days after this salute from the jingo press to the
R.O.T.C. [plans of Washington, a meeting of almost unique
signiﬁcance took place in New York City. It was the con-
vention of the Reserve Oﬂicers Training Corps Association.
Stirred by the attention which the press bestowed upon him,
Colonel Orvel Johnson, director general of the Association,
boasted to the New York World-Telegram that “his organi-
zation maintains an intelligence service to ferret -out radical
activities in the schools and colleges.” This elaborate spy sys-
tem, Mr. Johnson continued, is designed to “compile ex-
tensive ﬁles and memoranda on various radical leaders in
the schools and colleges.” Warming to his subject, this star-
spangled, ﬂag-waving fuehrer then announced that the work
of his lieutenants “is being ﬁnanced by individual contribu-
tions from some of the greatest industrial leaders in the
United States.”

Mr. Johnson was eminently outspoken; he warned of
world-wide “red revolution”; he boasted that the R.O.T.C.
is to be one major citadel of “Americanism,” as conceived
by “leading industrialists.” Sta-ted without ﬂourishes, Mr.
Johnson was disclosing that the tie-up between big business
and the military is becoming tighter than ever before. To-
gether they are setting out on a hunting expedition to track
down “un-American” thought-or, more likely, any thought.
Will the members of the R.O.T.C. serve as the unwitting

agents of these generous industrialists? Colonel Johnson
seemed conﬁdent that they will. He made clear, of course,
that the R.O.T.C. Association which he heads is not directly
connected with the government; it presumably d-oes what it
can, in its own modest way, to “help out” _in the ambitious
expansionist program of the corps. As an auxiliary project
it cultivates that form of “Americanism” known as espionage
and intimidation and red-baiting. And our leading indus-
trialists pay the Association’s bills; they are quite certain
that they will get their money’s worth.

s THE campus prepared to accept the advance of the mil-
Iimry regime, signifying as it does not merely war prepa-
rations but reaction of the most unyielding sort? Already
the R.O.T.C. oﬂicialdorn is launching its program of more—
and more mili-tant—units provided by the increased military
budget. In this issue of The Advocate a student at Ohio
University in Athens records in exciting detail the method
by which a unit has just been established there. He reveals
the unmistakable link between -the War Department, the
American Legion, and big business as represented by the
Board of Trustees and local interests. Exposing the duplicity
of a university administration which had neither the cour-
age nor integrity to resist -these encroachments, he records
the gallant opposition of students, and townspeople to a
step which they knew was aimed at their fundamental in-
terests and the interests of real learning. The R.O.T.C. has
been established at Ohio; its existence will not be a happy
one. Those who sponsored its arrival are discovering how
deep—seated and ﬁrm is the hatred of students and their fam-
ilies for militarism and the “Americanism” of paid patriot-
eers. At the University of Texas a real victory has been
registered. A similar attempt was forestalled by the vigilance
of the student body and the action of a faculty committee
which recognized that the R.O.T.C. does not belong in our
educational halls.

Perhaps the most signiﬁcant phase of thesedevelopments
is the fact that students are no longer deceived -by the pro-
cedure of ﬁrst launching “voluntary units.” As Sherwood
Eddy remarked at Ohio, “they’ll make it voluntary ﬁrst and
compulsory later.” The R.O-.T.C. does not belong on the
campus. The support which the Nye-Kvale amendment to
abolish compulsory drill is rallying rapidly assumes the
character of a ﬁrst step. Its passage would be a genuine,
powerful advance toward the ousting of the war-lords from
the school and college. The question of “compulsion” is not
the basic issue. So long as the R.0.T.C. endures, so long as
its officialdom holds power and prestige on -the campus, so

long as “leading industrialists” can utilize it as an instru- ,

ment for vigilante outbreaks, progressive thought cannot
be safe on the campus. That danger is present whether stu-
dents are compelled to take drill or whether they are coaxed
to do so by uniformed co-eds, military festivals and the
drums of the war spirit.

The STUDENT Anvocua

Athletes Aren’t So Dumb

OR generations the world has fer-
Fvently believed that college ath-
letes are stupid. It was taken for grant-
ed that a low I.  was an essential
prerequisite for ‘proficiency in sport.
When a Barry Wood or a Wesley Fes-
ler appeared-——fo-otball players who

achieved Phi Beta Kappa keys———it was.

front page news. They were the excep-
tions that proved the rule.

Now things are changing. Two
months ago a movie appeared in which
an assistant football coach yelled to
an unfortunate athlete who made a
bonehead play on the gridiron:

“No one said a football player
shouldn’t have a brain!”

This was a startling pronouncement
for a football coach to make. There are
still a good many people in this world
who ﬁrmly insist that football and
brains cannot, and should not mix. But
some athletes, as this same movie:
Fighting Youth, painfully attempts to
point out, are beginning to think other-
wise.

The -old theory had a good deal of
evidence to support it. In the first
place,- football scouts have never con-
centrated especially on prep school
honor graduates in their search for
promising gridiron material. They
have, understandably enough, tried to

. locate men with enough muscle, nerve

and guts capable of enduring four sea-
sons of college football. Mentality has
never been a primary consideration.
University admissions authorities have
always been lenient toward the intel-
lectual failings of candidates for the
football squad. Snappy quarterbacks
have been known to enter college with-
out ever having passed high school
algebra or elementary French.

In college too, honest professors,
loyal to Alma Mater and the Board of
Trustees, have not infrequently with-
held “F ’s” from pigskin heroes who
eminently deserved them. In virtually
every school there are helpful authori-
ties, kindly souls, who tell their ath-
letic charges that they needn’t bother
their pretty little heads about things
they’re not expected to understand."

By EDWARD COLE

And this was all as it should be. A
large proportion of collegiate sports-
men have been speciﬁcally hired to
perform certain tasks. Their job is to
win games for Alma Mater, to obtain
columns of publicity for the university
which employs them and to offer a
long afternoon’s entertainment for the
vast hordes of alumni and those mem-
bers of the general public who can af-
ford the price of a grandstand seat and
a bottle of applejack.

In return they have been given a liv-
ing wage while at school in the form
of what are nominally known as cam-
pus “jobs” and that are technically
known as “scholarships.” Also, and a
good deal more important, they have
been offered the prospect of good posi-
tions as bond salesmen or insurance
agents when they are graduated from
the team. For these reasons, they sub-
mit to the long, exhausting and often

brutal daily workouts under profes-

sional taskmasters. There is neither
time nor energy for any intellectual
pursuit. They can’t afford to let school
interfere with practice.

In the past few years the hired hands
who play football have been employed
at a new task. Lately universities have
been plagued by “ideas.” Students be-
gan to take a few moments off from
their time-honored occupations of pok-
er-playing, gin-guzzling and fox-trot-
ting to consider some of the problems
of the world they live in. Some went
so far as to discuss this matter open-
ly. A few hardy souls even ventured
to do something about it.

It is not news that deans, trustees,
and wealthy alumni were horriﬁed.
They turned to the football team, prop-
erly loyal and presumably dumb, for
assistance in stamping out this menac-
ing, contagious disease.

In colleges from coast to coast, foot-
ball heroes began to use their elabo-
rate training to good advantage. Flashy
backs threw rotten eggs and tomatoes
at liberal or radical speakers with all
the skill at their command. Sturdy line-
men pummeled their paciﬁst class-
mates in beautiful exhibitions of the

straight-arm and the scientiﬁc tackle.
Who said politics and sports don’t
mix?

s EARLY as 1931, football players
led the egg-throwing brigade in
Columbia’s Reed Harris strike. More
recently, on the eve of .a demonstra-
tion called to protest the suspension
of ﬁve student leaders at U.C.L.A.,
Assistant Coach Fred Oster reminded
his gridmen “to remember where your
jobs and eligibility come from.” The
boys gratefully responded with a well-
timed and well-executed assault on the
massed students. The Los Angeles Her-
ald and Express reported:

The vigilantes came from the ranks of
the husky, stern-faced athletes who met
in a drizzling rain on the Westwood Hill-
side last night and vowed to purge the
campus of radicalism ‘by force if neces-
sary.’

Last year a number of Wisconsin’s
“W” men displayed their loyalty to
American ideals when they helped
plunge Monroe Sweetland, an L.I.D.
speaker, and three others ‘suspected of
progressive leanings into the nearby
lake. They manhandled several women
students and threw one over a railing.

It was all quite simple. The real cure
for college radicalism, school officials
discovered, was football. So university
presidents took the next logical step.
If football is such a good way of keep-
ing the players themselves out of

harm’s way, couldn’t it be used to keep ’

the whole campus safe and sane?

Why certainly. If boys and girls
would -only spend their time discuss-
ing the virtues of forward passing and
would exhaust themselves cheering
madly for their team, they would have
neither the time to listen to “foreign
agitators” nor the energy to march in
strike parades. In addition powerful
football teams are hired to give a
school a “good name.” Through ener-
getic ballyhoo, they could be used to
«obliterate a school’s bad reputation as
a “haven of ideas.”

The campaign began. It’s still going
on. Coaches, college presidents, and

FEBRUARY,1936

editorial writers are bombarding the
public with long testimonials to foot-
ball as a “political sedative.”

On November 26, 1934-, Dr. Mal
Stevens, head football coach of New
York University, asked himself: Is foot-
ball a dangerous game? And he re-
plied:

“I’m glad it is. it is a rough individual
game with generous subordination for
group welfare that makes ﬁne citizens. It’s

the sport of America, because it gets back
to the pioneer spirit of ﬁghting.”

And in case anyone should misun-
derstand what he meant by that, he ex-
plained the matter more fully:

“Football lets oﬂ’ a lot of emotional
steam for both old and young. If we didn’t
have such a safety valve, we might turn
to bolshevism, communism or some other
form of social unrest. We will continue to
have great football crowds and as much
interest in football as in education, and the
two will balance very well.”

Dr. George Barton Cutten, “silver-
haired presiden-t” of Colgate Univer-
sity, delivered himself of similar senti-
ments, although less explicitly, not
long ago:

“I’m strong for football (he said) as a
part of the college curriculum. Danger-
ous? Of course football is dangerous-any
game involving physical contact is apt to
cause injuries-—but in this soft, luxurious
era of pushing electric buttons and press-
ing gas pedals, our youth needs the virile
stimulus of a rugged sport. Flabby ﬂesh
means softness of moral ﬁber.

The safety-first doctrine can be carried
to an extreme detrimental to self—reliance
and personal initiative. Football supplies
something vital that was lost when Amer-
ica ceased to be a pioneer country. The last
frontier has vanished, but our coddled
youngsters still crave the spice of danger
and the thrill of action.

Football develops courage; teaches self-
sacriﬁce; breeds loyalty to a cause; in-
stills disciplined obedience; inspires coop-
erative effort; calls for quick thinking in
emergencies and provides for glamor that
appeals to exuberant youth.”

When Benny Friedman was ap-
pointed football coach at the College
of the City of New York, there was
much talk about the good fortune the
school had in obtaining a ﬁrst-rate
football brain capable of turning out
successful teams. Mr. Friedman was
designated to wipe out the “bad” rep-
utation of the institution as a “breed-
ing-place” for radicalism. At the time
of his appointment, Coach Dick Har-
low of Harvard showered praise on

football as a bulwark of sound con-
servatism. He vigorously suggested that
football players didn’t think — and
could keep anyone else from doing so.

As usual, William Randolph Hearst’s
hirelings capped the climax of absurd-
ity. A New York Evening Journal edi-
torial of February 20, 1935, extolled
Columbia University, which, despite its
radicals, “retains some of the old Co-
lumbia spirit, which in the past made
it eminent as a patriotic institution—
and incidentally, at various times, as
the possessor of many ﬁrst-rate ﬁght-
ing football teams.”

“For some reason which the psychologist
can perhaps explain (the editorial contin-
ued), football and Communism don’t go
well together. We never heard of a soap-
box orator who made a team. We never

heard of a good halfback who cared two
straws for Marx or Lenin.”

Which reminded the editors of The
Social Frontier, in the issue of June,
1935, of the pronouncement of the
Governor General of Kiev in 1849:

“You gentleman may dance, play cards,
ﬂirt with other men’s wives, frequent wom-
en, and beat women, but stay away from
politics or I will throw you out of the
University.”

Now football, it seems, is better di-
version than women.

UT these “educators” were all for-

getting one thing. The depression
was hitting football players as well as
the rest of the Campus. So.me of those
promised bond-selling jobs failed to
materialize. A good deal of brain be-
gan to emerge from amidst the brawn.
Athletes were starting to “think.”

In The Nation of January 22, 1936,
Oliver Carlson reports that “ex-foot-
ball players,” cheated of their expected
careers, have become sail-ors and long-
shoremen on the Paciﬁc Coast. Now
they are helping to control the mari-
time unions by virtue of their superior
education. And the militancy of West
Coast labor is due in great part to the
“awakening” of some college athletes.

The movie Fighting Youth was part
of the Hollywood Red-baiting cycle. It
tried to show that Bolshevism, in the
shape of a beautiful co-ed, was attempt-
ing to undermine the morale of a foot-
ball team and thereby help overturn
America’s form of government. But one
line in it is not at all as ridiculous as
the rest of the plot. The line is one

which Charles Farrell, the quarterback
hero, utters at the beginning of the
ﬁlm:

‘‘It’s about time,” he says, “I did
something besides carry a football.”

That’s precisely what a number of
college athletes throughout the country
have been saying to themselves. A few
have been indiscreet enough to say it so
that their coaches could hear. An-d that

i was fatal.

In one Eastern college, a member
of the football squad spoke at a gath-
ering in defense of the liberal manage-
ment of the school paper. In a vituper-
ative talk before the assembled team,
a coach bawled out the athlete for in-
dulging in such activities. Minor re-
prisals followed. '

At Harvard, under Coach Harlow,
the same thing happened. On Novem-
ber 13, 1935, a sports columnist on The
Philadelphia Enquirer reported:

“Shaun Kelly, Harvard grid captain, is
said to be in the well-known grease as

result of sending a letter to be read at a
paciﬁst meeting.”

At Ohio State last fall, Jesse Owens,
the Negro sprint champion, announced
that he was opposed to American par-
ticipation in the Olympics to be held
in Nazi Germany. The coach declared
that Owens would “find himself at the
bottom of the heap” if he didn’t keep
quiet. Shortly afterwards, Owens pub-
licly ate his words. He added his name
to a letter from several Negro athletes
advocating America’s participation in
the Berlin Olym-pics after all.

The authorities, seeing that their ath-
letes are not all born dumb, are try-
ing -to make them dumb. The question
is: Will American athletes submit to
the efforts to keep them strong in
muscle but weak in the head?

Many have clearly demonstrated
that they will not.

School administrations may soon
discover that their football teams are
no longer trustworthy “safety-valves,”
that gridmen are likely to let off their
“steam” occasionally on a picket line.
Football players, it turns out, can have
brains. And the athletes are likely to
use their brains for something else
besides toting a pigskin. Even the
wages of star left-ends are falling. A
union of impoverished, underpaid,
overworked football heroes is not in-
conceivable.
