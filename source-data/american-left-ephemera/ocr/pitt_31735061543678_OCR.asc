Besides, how could the workers understand
the sudden philanthropy ‘of the maiiufacturers,
those people who were even yet occupied in
ﬁghting the ten-‘hour bill, by which it was pro-
posed to reduce the day of the factory worker
from twelve hours to ten hours. ,

To give you an idea of theuphilanthropy of
the manufacturers, I will recall to you, gentle-
men, the regulations established in all the fac-
tories. ‘ 

Each manufacturerdhas for his own use a
veritable code in which there are ﬁnes ﬁxed
for all faults voluntary or involuntary. For
instance, the worker shall pay so much, if he
has the misfortune to sit down on a chair, if he
whispers, talks, laughs, if he arrives a few
minutes too late, if a pa1't of the machine
breaks, if he does not turn out objects of a
desired quality, etc—., etc. The ﬁnes aretalways
greater than the real damage caused by the
worker. And in order to give the worker every
facility for incurring penalties,-'i the factory

clock is set ahead, bad raw inaterials are f11r—

nished so that the worker shall make many
breakages. Dismissal ‘awaits the overseer who
is not sutﬁciently skillful to multiply the cases
for ﬁnes.

 

 

 

MARX ON‘ CHEAPNESS 11

You see, .gei'it1emer;, this domestic legislation
is made in order to give birth to ﬁnable of-
fences, and violations of it are brought about
in order to make money for the manufacturer.
Thus the manufacturer employs all means to
reduce thenominal wage and to exploit even
the accidents over which the worker has no
control.

These manufacturers, they are the same phil-
anthropists who have wished to make the work-
ers believe that they were capablepof making

4 enormous expenditures solely to ameliorate their

lot. . .

Thus, on the one hand, they pare down the
wage of the worker by‘ the regulations of the
factory in the most niggardly manner, and,
on the other, they impose upon themselves the
greatest sacriﬁcesin order to caused the wage-

_to rise again by the Anti-corn-law-league.

They build at great cost a palace where the
league establishes in some sort its oﬂicial dwell-
ing; they -send out missionaries to every part
of England to preach the religion of free—trade. ,
they liaveiprinted and distribute free thousands
of pamphlets to enlightenithe worker on his
own interests; they expend enormous sums to
render the press favorable to their cause; they
organize a vast administration to direct the

12 MARX ON CHEAPNESS

free—trade 111~ovements, and they display‘ all the
riches of their .eloquence in public meetings.
It was in one (if these meetings that a work-
ingman cried out:

“If the landed proprietors should sell our
bones, you others, manufacturers, you would
be the ﬁrst to buy them to throw them into» :1
steam mill and grind them into ﬂour.”

The English workers have understood very
clearly the signiﬁcance of the struggle between
the landed proprietors and the industrial capi-
talists. They knew‘ very well that it was de-

sired to lower the price of bread in order to _

lower wages that industrial proﬁts might be
increased in the same ratio that rent would be
diminished. '

Ricardo. the Apostle of the Englishi free-
traders, the most distinguished economist of
our century, is on this point in perfect agree
ment with the workers. .

He says in his celebratedwork on political
economy: "

“If, instead of harvesting wheat at home, we
were to discover a new market where we could

‘procure for ourselves these objects cheaper, in

that case wages would have to fall and proﬁts
rise. The fall in the price of the products of
agriculture reduces the wages not only of the

MARX ON CHEAPNESS 13

workers employed in the tillage of the soil, but
also of all those who work in manufactures or

‘who are employed in commerce.”

And do not believe, gentlemen, that it his a

thing altogether indifferent for the worker that-

he receives now only four francs, wheat being

cheaper, when before he received ﬁve francs.

Have not his wages none-the-less fallen rela-
tively to proﬁt? And is it not clear that his
social position has grown worse compared to
.that of the capitalist? Besides that he is also
a loser in actual fact.

So long as the price of grain remained higher,
wages being equally higher, a small saving
made on the consumption-of bread suﬂiced to
procure him other enjoyments, but from the
moment that bread and consequently wages be-
come very cheap, he can save next to nothing
on bread to buy other objects._

The English -workers have made the free-
traders feel that they are not the dupes of their
illusions and their lies, and if, in spite of that,
they have combined with them against the land-
ed proprietoris, it was in order to destroy the
last relics of the feudal system so that for the
future they would have to face only a single
enemy. The Workers have not deceived them-
selves in their calculations, for the landed pro-

The laborer, cherishing always the argument

 

of the economists, will ﬁnd that his franc has '

melted in his pocket and that he has only five
sovusileft. y * t

» Thereupon’ the economists will say to you:
Verytwell, We admit that competition among
the workers, whichicertainly will not be dimin-

 

ished‘ under the regime of -free-trade, will not‘
take long in bringing Wages into harmony with V
the low price of commodities. But from an- g

other point of View the lowzqprice of commodi-
ties will increase consumption; the greater con-
sumption will require a greater production,
which will be followed by ,-a stronger demand
for hands, and after this stronger demand for
hands will follow in order arise in wages.

All this argument amounts to” this: Free-

trade will increase the productive powers. ‘ If r

industry goes on growing, if wealth, if pro-
ductive power, if, in a Word, productive capital
increases the demand for labor, the price of
labor; and consequently Wages likewise rise.

The best condition for the worker is (the con- ’

dition that accompanies)’ the increase of capi-

Vital. Andlthis must be admitted. If capital

remains stationary, industry not only Will re-

main stationary, but it will decline, and in that
case the worker vvill be its ﬁrst victim. He
will perish before the capitalist. And in the
case Where capital goes on increasing in that
state of things which we have said isthe best
for the worker, what will be his lot? He Will
perish likewise. The increase of productive
capital implies the accumulation and concen-
tration of capitals. The centralization of capi-
tals brings in its Wake a greater division of
labor anda greater application of machinery.

The greater division of labor destroys the spe?

cialization of labor, destroys the special skill
of the laborer, and bysputting in the place of
this specialized labor _a' labor vvllich anyone
can do, it increasesthe ‘competition between
the Workers. 7 . p M l M n V

This competiticm becomes so much the strong-
er as the division of labor gives to the Worker
the means of doing by, himself the Work tha

it formerly took threeto do. g i

 

 

Machines produce the same resulton a much
greater scale.» The increase of productive capi-
tal, by forcing the industrial capitalists to work
with constantly growing means (of production),
ruins the petty manufacturers and hurls them
into the ranks ofipthe proletariat. Then, the
rate of interest diminpishinglvin proportion as

capitalists accumulate, the small investors who
can no longer live on their incomes will be
forced to embark in industry, and thus in the
end to swell the number of the proletarians.

Finally, the more productive capital increases,
the more it iscompelled to produce for a mar-
ket of unknown requirements, the more produc-
tion goes in advance of consumption, the more
supply strives to force demand, and consequent-
ly crises increase in intensity and frequency.
But every crisis in its turn accelerates the cen-
tralization of capitals and swells the prole-
tariat. ‘ r l ‘
.Thus. as productive capital increases, com-
petition between the Workers in production in-
creases much more -rapidly. The recompense of
labor diminishes for all, and the burden of labor
increases for a few. 8 ll  ~

8111 1829, there were ‘at Manchester 1,088
spinners employed in 36 factories. In 1841,
there were only 448 of them leftgand these
vvorkers attended to 53,353 more spindles than
the 1.088 workers of 1829. If the ratio of
manual labor had increased proportionately to
the productive power, the number of workers

ought to have reached the ﬁgure of 1,848, so

that the improvements made in mechanics have
deprived of labor 1,100 workers.

We know in advance the reply of the econ-
omists. These men deprivedof work, they say,
will ﬁnd some other employment for their
-hands. Doctor Bowring has not failed tore-
produce this argument at the Congress of the
Economists, but neither has he failed to refute
it himself. ~ H > Z 

In 1833, Doctor Bowringy delivered a" speech
in the House of Commons on the subject of the
50,000 London ﬂweavers who had been for _a
long time dying of starvation without being
able to ﬁnd that new;.occup‘ationjwhichthe free-
traders had pointedtout“ to theme in the dis-
tance. _ - _   > I, 5 T

ills cause entire classes to perish; he speaks

says further that the misfortunes of these Work-

 INTERNATIONAL

SOCIALIST REVIEW

is the FIGHTING MAGAZINE OF
FHE WORKING CLASS. '

It is the only great ILLUSTRATED
‘periodical that stands for the revolution-
ary movement of the proletariat.

Month by month the great capitalists
are invading new fields, subduing the
forces of nature, and enrolling more men,
women and children in the ranks of the

workers.

A Month by month the wage-workers are
closing up their ranks and ﬁghting here
one skirmish and there another, in
England, France, Japan, in Butte and
Philadelphia, sometimes winning, some-
times losing, but always growing into a V ,1,
sense of solidarity that will strengthen 
them in the greater battles to come.

The REVIEW keeps its readers in
touch with each stride of industrial de-
velopment and each new step toward a
more complete organization of the wage-
workers of the world. I

Francisco, writes: “The Review does
not preach or teach. It is a mirror held
before the eyes of the worker, who sees
himself and the society in which he
moves. His life and his environment be-
come intelligible to him. The Review
unveils, cog by cog, the ever-growing in-
dustrial machine that enslaves him, must
soon starve him. It is a terrible awak-
ener.

“I have read from the Review to many
working ‘class audiences and have seen
them become keenly interested as the
meaning of the growth of the iron man
(machine) ﬂashed home.

“Men may not be persuaded to liberty.
But the Review will make them feel the
ﬁre and smell the smoke and all hands
will vacate the burning house, regardless

T of ethics, customs or what not.

“The Review stiﬂes with the smoke of
industrial activity. The worker sniffs it
on every page, interprets his own shop
experiences by the lesson pointed, and
SELF-INTEREST pushes him into the

T . army of revolt.”

GUSTAVUS MYERS’

History of the Supreme Court

“In this original and exhaustive work, Mr.
Myers gives from a vast multitude of oﬂicial docu-
ments the actual story of this remarkable and
powerful body, the like of which exists nowhere
else in the world. Hitherto the history of this
court has been shrouded in the densest mystery,
but after years of arduous research Mr. Myers
has at last presented the complete narrative. And
it is a very surprising one. The story of the
Supreme Court, as Mr. Myers presents it in sober,
matter—of-fact fashion, is really the actual history
of the economic development of the United States.”
-—Toronto Star. .

“A volume that deserves careful reading, and
which merits praise, is the History of the Supreme
Court of the United States, by Gustavus Myers,
an author whose reputation has been previously

established. . . . The value of the book rests ~
' upon the fact that practically all its charges are

substantiated_by docurncntary proof. . . . T e
volume on the whole is anveye-o ene_r for the
average reader because it shows tiat in no era,

‘since the Supreme Court war. established has it

not been under the ﬁre of public criticism, and
its members, _while escaping impeachment, have
been under suspicion of casting their votes on
decisions that were favorable to friends or cor-
porations with which friends are affiliated. . . .
Not the least interesting part of the book are
the chapters devoted to the present chief justice
and to the judges recently appointed by President
Taft. The , too, are human, as the text will
disclose.”—' oston Globe. -

“Mr. Myers has delved, as no other author has
done, down into the bottom and beginning of
things. and brought up the hidden truths of
municipal, state and government affairs. That they
have come up reeking with slime and mud is no
fault of the au'thor.”———O1'egon Journal.

4 INTRODUCTION

in England they wanted to give the p001 tnilebvs
cheap bread, in America cheap clothes.

The workers now know that everytnmg they
produce over and above a bare living is taken
from them by their employers with equal n.‘,-at-
ness and despatch, whether the tariff be high
or low. ‘But in 1846-47 many, probably most,
W01 iingmenin Europe thought that the Eng-
lishf workingman had really been substantially
ibenéeﬁtted by the repeal of the corn-.laws. Even
the; trade crisis of 1847 was not sufficient to
destroy this pleasing delusion. It was under
these circumstances that Karl Marx on the
9th of January, 1848, delivered before the Dem-
ocratic Association of Brussels his famous
“Discourse on Free-Trade.” A

The only translatior cf this that has hereto-
fore been available has sold at 25 cents, and
the price has prevented its circulating as wide-
ly as could be desieed. Most workingmen now
realize that as workingmeni they are no more
directly interested in the question of Protec-
tion vs. Free-trade than a chicken is interested
in the question of how it is to be cooked. Ac-
cordingly the present translator has felt him-
self atlliberty to abridge the speech very con-
sidrably by omitting repetitions and those por-
tions of the original which dealt with purely

«English aﬁfairs. By so doing it has been made
possible to issue it in this Pocket Library form
and thus make it generally available. This
translation is from the original French, the
language in which the speech Was delivered.
While Free-trade vs. Protection is not a burn-
ing question in this country to-day, the question
of the effect of high and low prices of the
means of subsistence upon the working-class is
decidedly a burning question. During the past
decade all are agreed that the cost of living has
risen greatly. Reformers and muck-rakers are
trying to persuade the workers to join them
in an attack upon the “extortionate” prices of
the wicked Trusts. There is danger that some
Socialists with opportunist tendencies will be
misled in this way; But the Revolutionary So-
cialists who uphold the banner of the Socialist
Party will continue to direct all their attacks

- toward the wage-system-—the most eﬁective

means of exploitation (robbery) the World
has ever seen. In this Work they will be great-
ly aided by this pamphlet in Which the World’s
greatest Economist explodes once for all the
fallacy that cheap prices are a boon to the
working-class. ‘ .

It should be noted that Marx speaks of Free-
trade as the condition for the free development

6 11\‘w30DUcTIoN

of Capitalism; so it was for Capitalism in
England then; but Protectionthas been the con-
dition for the free development of Capitalism
in Germany and the United States during the
last few decades. ‘Marx foresaw this and ex-
pressly states it in the latter part of this ad-
dress in the case of Germany.

It is necessary to note thatin this speech as
in all his writings of that period Marx did
not always in words distinguish between labor
and labor-power; In his later writings he is
always carefulito make this distinction. Here
when he speaks of the sale? oflabor we must
always understand ilahor-power}, p L

V 8 MARK ON CI-IEAPNESS

Every one knows that the struggle between.

the Liberals and the democrats is called, in
England, the struggle between the free-traders
and the Chiartists. V

Let us see now how the English free-traders
have proved to the people the good sentiments
which actuate them. 4 L

Here is what they saidto the factory w0rk~
er-s: ‘ l

The duty levied on gralihst is a tax on wages,
this taa-, youvpay it to the territorial landlords,
to those aristocrats of the Middle Ages; if your
position. is miserable, it is cm account of the

dearncss of prov;-isions of the ﬁrst necessity/.

The workers demanded in their turn of the
manufacturers: T ’ L l V

How does it happen that during the last thirty
years in which our industry has had its great-
est development, our wages have fallen much
faster than the price of grains has risen?

* * * * * * ' * V *
And then in ]834,‘When bread was very

7 cheap and business went swimmingly, What did

you say to us? If youlare miserable, it is be-
cause you make too many children. and your
marriage is more productive’ than our industry!

Those are the very Words whichyou used
to us then; and you proceeded to pass, new

of the proletarians.

To which the manufacturers replied:

You are right. Messieurs Workingmen; it is
not only the price of Wheat, but also the com-
petition between the job-seekers, which deter-
mines wages. ‘

(Marx then summarizestthe argument that
the free-traders addressed to the small-traders

in I and grocers. He tells howtthe free-traders
were unable to reply to the objections of the

 

farmers and farm—1aborers, which led the Anti-
Corn-Law League toioffer prizes for the best
three treatises on ‘fthe salutary inﬂuence of the
abolition at the Vgrain-sdutiest on English agri-

, culture.” Thesel prizes were"; won by Messrs»
