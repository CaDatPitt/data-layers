another group of exploiters,‘ but to abolish all exploitation of
man by man, to abolish all exploitergroups, to establish the
dictatorship of the proletariat, to establish the power of the most

revolutionary class of all oppressed classes that have ever _

existed, to organize a new, classless, Socialist society.”

Therein lies the "tremendousworld-wide signiﬁcance of the great

L October Socialist revolution. '

. The ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years of the existence of Soviet power
proved in practice that it was possible to create a Socialist society,
that it was possible to do away with all exploitation of man by man,-
that it was possible to create multi-national states in which there is
no enmity between the various peoples, but, onthe contrary, a solid
friendship and healthy competition in the struggle for better living
conditions for all people. i

However much the enemies of the Soviet state attempt to blacken i

it, whatever diﬁiculties it may still have to overcome, the ﬁrst twenty-
ﬁve years of the existence of the Soviet state are a tremendous.
victory for the workers of the whole world. . A new form of human
society has been found, a new form which unites all men for creative

labour. We are not trying to thrust this social order which we have “

won for ourselves on anyone, and we have no intention of doing so
in the future- But we have defended, and will defend ‘with all the
force of our conviction, with all the love we have for our country
and for our people, this new social order, this power of the Soviets.

Looking back on the road we have travelled in the last twenty-
ﬁve years, each one of us,.each citizen of the Soviet state, and all
workers _in other countries, must admit that what had seemed
impossible, a mere dream, has now become reality. The Soviet

. order incorporates the dreams that the best‘ representatives of the a
,.human race conceived in the past. The road over which we

travelled in these twenty-ﬁve years led us through years of painful
privations, through years of civil war aﬁd intervention, through
diﬂicult years during which we reconstructed our national economy,
destroyed by the ﬁrst imperialistworld war and the civil war. The
road to the ﬁnal victoryof Socialism led through difficult years of
struggle with the enemies of the new state at home and abroad. ,
But these twenty-ﬁve years were not merely years of difficulties

to be overcome. ‘In this quarter-century the people knew the great -

joy. of creation, the joy of constructive labour in a new. society, the
joy of tremendous achievement, the joy of expanding strength. The
people of the U.S.S.R. feel that in these twenty-ﬁve years they have
grown mighty wings which permitted them to rise from the blood
and ﬁlth of the ﬁrst imperialist war, from among the ruins of the
Tsarist order, from its terrible disorder and confusion to the heights

of the ﬁrst, but mighty, conquest of Socialist labour, to the building T

of a classless Socialist society.

_ In the twenty—fourth year of the. existence of the Soviet state a
violent, ‘perﬁdious enemy——the Hitlerites——attacked our country.

have Soviet power, because Soviet power had trained a generation
of courageous people, of true heroes of. Socialist labour as well as
military heroes whom the enemy has good reason to fear, because
in twenty-ﬁve years of its existence the Soviet country has accumu-
lated tremendous forces——for all these reasonsthe Red Army is

[now in a position to strike the enemy, and strike him hard. For the
‘ same reasons we are conﬁdent of our victory, we are convinced

that the next twenty-ﬁve years will be a period of further prosperity
and development of all the creative forces of the people, andof a new,
joyful building-up of human happiness on, this earth.

The Red Army is an Arrny of Fraternity and Friendship Between All 7

Peoples of the U .S.S.R. and a Strong Shield for the Soviet
Fatherland ,

WHENA the Bolshevik Party wasrpreparing the insurrection of 1917
it knew that it was facing a bitter struggle with the enemies of

Socialism, The Party knew that the victorious young Socialist

1 "Soviet state would have to draw the sword more than once in the
\ defence of its freedom, its independence, and the right to build a

Socialist society.

From the very‘ ﬁrstdays of its existence the Party of the iBol-i. if

sheviks found in its ranks and among the masses of the workers‘

a fearless men and women who were prepared to suffer any hardship t v
and make any sacriﬁce for the great cause. The ﬁghting groups of V

the year 1905 and the Red Guard detachments of 1917 had been

steeled in the struggle against Tsarism. Lenin said that the “armed _

wcarkershwere the seed of a new army, the germ of a new social

or er”. A . .

T In February 1917, the soldiers and sailors of revolutionary
Petrograd helped the workers to overthrow Tsarism, but for the
working class, for the great ‘mass of toilers, ‘this was only the ﬁrst
step in the struggle for Soviet power. It was’i'n this struggle that
the Red Guard was formed, later in 1918 to serve as a foundation
for the forming of the Red Army. When the February revolution
of 1917 took place Lenin wrote in his Letters from Afar: “Help to

arm the workers, or at least do not hinder them from arming them- ~  ,»
selves,‘ and freedorn,,,in Russia" will be invincible, the monarchy r.

irretrievably lost, and the revolution rendered safe.’ .
L1: is well known, that in 1917 it was the Red Guard that foiled
the counter-revolutionary coup of Kornilov and his accomplices.

It should be particularly noted that it was these» units in which «
Bolshevik inﬂuence was strongest which also preserved their ﬁghting L L

' capacity to the highestdegree. A
Lenin and Stalin attachedthe greatest importance to the organi-

° zation of the armed force and to the preparation of this force for the . S

decisive assault. It was this «military work, in which the best
Bolsheviks participated, , which secured victory for the Socialist

L revolution of October. Lenin himself gave directives as to.what

should be done in order to take power. The advice he .gave‘—as
for instance, hisletter, “Advice of an Outsider”——was equivalent to

“ i e an Order of the Day for the revolutionary army. In this letter Lenin

demanded that the whole revolutionary ‘army be inspired by a
resolutely’ offensive spirit, and that the army should take for its

L \ slogan, “Audacity, audacity, and again audacity”. Lenin demanded

skill and threefold audacity in the struggle. For the detachments
the most important strategic points he

gave the watchword, “Perish to the last man, but do not let/‘the

knew that _
, Russia, and for the liberation of all oppressed nations. .
From the very moment of its birth, however, the Socialist state

was faced with the most difficult task; it had to defend the countryi vi
‘ against attacks of the Germans and other imperialists, againstall

attempts to strangle the Soviet republic by military force. In this

it ~ *1 struggle with the enemies of the Soviet state the Red Army-wasborn
‘ and tempered. L. Those, who opposed the formation of the Red ~

Army, the adherents of the old regime, predicted that nothing
would come of this enterprise; but Lenin and Stalin took thematter
in hand, and all proble.ms——the most diﬂicult with which Lenin and
Stalin were ever confronted——were solved, becauw they were based
on realities and their solutions had the support of the whole mass of
the working population. » - n L ~ .
' Nearly one hundred years ago, in 1845, Friedrich Engels, one of
dreamed of a future revolutionary
army and wrote: ' -

“Remember.the miracles performed by the enthusiasm of the

revolutionary armies of 1792-1799, who were ﬁghting merely for - ’

an illusion, for an unrealfatherland——and you will conceive how
strong must be an army ﬁghting not for an illusion butgfor a
reality.”. . . e r

_ Engels prophesied: : ' V . V V
‘_‘The members of such a society would in the event of war .

.. . . defend their real fatherland, their real hearths _and homes '»

. .1 . hence they would ﬁght with an enthusiasm, resolution, and-
courage before which the mechanical drill of a contemporary
army would ﬂy like chaﬂ‘ before thewind.” »

First of all the new Soviet state was faced with the invasion of
German hordes, with German intervention. It was in the struggle
against this invasion that the Red Army was formed. On the 24th
anniversary of the Red Army, Comrade Stalin said in his Order of

1 the Day No. 55: , .

“Comrades, Red Army and Red Navy men, commanders
and political workers, men andiwomen guerillas !
— “The peoples of our country meet the twenty-fourth anniver-
‘ sary of the Red Army in the stern days of the patriotic war against
Fascist Germany which has basely and insolently encroached
upon the life and freedom of our motherland. Along a tremen-A
dous front, from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, men of the
Red Army and Red Navy wage ﬁerce battles in order to oust the
German Fascist invaders fromour country and safeguard the
honour and independence of our motherland. -
“This is notthe ﬁrst time that the Red Army has had to
_ defend our native land from attack by enemies. The Red
Army was created twe ‘arty-f our years ago to ﬁght the troops of the

foreign interventionist invaders who strove to.dismember our _

country and destroy her independence. Young detachments of
the Red. Army, which were taking part in war for the ﬁrst time,
inﬂicted_ utter defeat on the German invaders at Pskov and
Narva on February 23rd, 1918.

“For this very reason February 23rd, 1918, was proclaimed 9

the day of the birth of the Red Army. Since then the Red Army
‘has been growing and gaining strength in the struggle against
the foreign interventionists and invaders. It safeguarded our

native land in battle with the German invaders in 1918 and A

oustedthem from the Ukraine and Byclorussia... It safeguarded

our native land in battles with ‘foreign troops of the Entente in

1919-1221 and ousted them from our country.” i

The Red Army was at ﬁrst based on the voluntary principle. In
a decree of the Council of People’s Commissars regarding the
organization of a Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army. dated January
28/15th, 1918 it was stated: ..

' “(l) The Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army is formed from _ C  if

the most class-conscious and best-organized elements of the

working class. .
“‘(2) Entrance to the ranks of the Red Army is open for all

citizens of the Russian Republic= over 18 years ofgage. Accep-V

tancein the ranks of the Red Army is conditional on one of the

and the Soviet Government.

 

 

following recommendations: by ‘ committees of an existing

military unit, by some democratic social organization accepting
’ the platform of Soviet power, by a party or trade union organi-

zation, or, failing that, by at least two members of such an

organization. In the event of whole units joining at once, _a

mutual’ guarantee and vote by name of all ‘participants 1S

required.” -

But already, in July 1918, it was clear that the Red Army‘ would

have to be considerably expanded in order to defeat the inter-
vention of the White Guards. For this reason the Fifth Congress

- of the Soviets issued a decree prescribing compulsory military

service for all workers of the Soviet state. From this time onwards
the Red ‘Army was built up on the basis of compulsory military
service‘. '

Despite the perfectly justiﬁed distrust of the officers of the
Tsarist army, ‘Lenin and Stalin were in favour of making use of them
in the units of the Red Army. The Fifth Congress of the Soviets
put on record that :

“In theinterests of the creation of a centralized, well-trained,
‘and well-equipped army it is necessary to make wide use of the
— experience and knowledge of a large number of military special-

ists ‘among the officers of the former army. They must all be
registered and directed to take up posts to which they are
appointed by the Soviet Government. Every military specialist
who honestly and conscientiously assists in the development and
strengthening of the military power of the Soviet republic is
entitled to the respect of the Workers’. and Peasants’ Army, and
to every support on the part of the Soviet power. Any military
specialist who perﬁdiously attempts to use his responsible
position for counter-revolutionary conspiracies or treason in
the interests of foreign imperialists will incur the death penalty.”

At the same time military commissars were appointed to all

units of the Red Army, whose task it was to safeguard the main»

tenanoe of a close and unbreakable contact between the Red Army
According to the appropriate decree:

“Only irreproachable revolutionaries, steadfast champions
of the cause of the proletariat and poor peasants, were to be
appointed‘to positions as military commissars, for the fate of
the army would be in their hands.” - '

Obviously it was also necessary to create cadres of commanders.

The Soviet Government made it its business to create and educate if 
_ such cadres of new commanders, completely devoted to the defence ‘ "

of Soviet power. Directives were issued according to which gifted,
energetic, and courageous soldiers of the Red Army should be

’ admitted to these commander-training schools. .

‘From the very beginning iron discipline was one of the funda-
mental demands to be fulﬁlled by the Red Army. On this subject a
decree dated July 10th, 1918, stated:

“A Workers’_ and Peasants’ Red Army should be built up on
the foundation of iron revolutionary discipline. Citizens who
have been given arms by the Soviet Government for the ‘defence

of the interests of the working masses are under the obligation to .

obey implicitly the orders and instructions they receive from
commanders appointed by the Soviet Government.”

. It was on this basis that the mighty Red Army was built up and
enabled to defeat the interventionists in the civil war. ‘

In addition, a decree dated April 22nd, 1918, introducedcom-L

pulsory military training of all citizens of the following ages:

“(1) School age group, last age classesof which are to be‘

\ determined by the People’s Commissariat for Education.
“(2) Preparatory age group, from 16 years to 18 years.
“(3) Call-up age group from 18 years to 40 years.”

During the Civil War, special detachments were formed of Com- L
munists and Young Communists for the struggle with the counter-‘

revolutionaries and bandits. The imperialists made every effort to
strangle the young Soviet republic both by intervention and by
‘military blockade. A decree of the All-Russian Central Executive

. Committee dated September 2nd, 1918, declared the Soviet republic

to be a military camp. A decree was issued establishing a Council.

of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defence under the chairmanship of

Lenin. ‘The decree says:

, “A military regime, that is to say a regime of the strongest
discipline, must be established, not only in the army and navy,

but also in the food and transport industries ‘and in the a_.rma- .
ments factories.‘ Only such a regime of strict labour discipline

corresponds to the position of the country, which the imperialists
have compelled us to turn into a military camp.” ,

The Eighth Congress of the Bolshevik Party, held in March 1918, ‘

discussed the.conclusions to be drawn from the ﬁrst phase in the
development of the Red Army. Lenin and Stalin insisted on the

further strengthening of ‘discipline in the army. Comrade Stalin.
said: “Either we shall create a genuine workers’ and peasants” (but ..

mainly peasants’) strongly disciplined army and defend our republic
or we shall perish.” ‘

The Congress gave special attention to the part played by
political commissars. One of its decisions was : ,

“Commissars of the army are not merely direct and immedi-
ate representaitves of Soviet power but, above all, the carriers of
the spirit of our Party, of its discipline, of its resolution and
courage in the struggle for the realization of our aims.”

The Red Army evolved continuously in the struggle with its .
enemies. The ﬁrst measures undertaken by the Soviet Govern-. A 
ment after the victory of the Octoberrevolution were embodied in I  “
the decrees, “On the Ownership of the Land” and “On Peace”. By . " ‘

» made to the people even before October. -

The Soviet Government, headed by Lenin and Stalin, proposed
to all belligerent states that hostilities should cease and peace

~ negotiations be started.

But the counter-.revolutionary—bourgeois and landowners were
already rising in arms against the new Soviet state. The petty-
bourgeois parties, i.e. the Socialist—Revolutionaries and the Men-

sheviks, both claiming to be Socialists, helped the landowners and .

capitalists. More than once Anarchists also joined hands_ with
them-——for example, the bands of Nestor Makhno. Interventionist

- armies hurried to the assistance of domestic counter-revolution.

,Theyi surrounded our country with an iron ring of military
aggression and economic blockade. From the Far East to the
Finnish frontier, from Murmansk and Archangel to the shores of

, the Black Sea, in Siberia, in the Urals, in the Caucasus, in Central

Asia, in the Baltic, in Byelorussia and in the Ukraine, in the Don
Basin and on the Volga, in the Northern Caucasus, and 1n the

steppes of Astrakhan, the foreign and internal enemies of Soviet , '

power carried on relentless war against the Soviet country, and the
workers had to gather all their forces and summon all their courage
in order to defeat this counter—revolution and intervention.

:2 But however difficult the task, it was successfully fulﬁlled by the

-people under the leadership of the two great leaders, Lenin and

Stalin. In the words of the poet Maya.kovsky*,:

F romsixteen different lands they'd come,

vs. Admirals, barons, and suchlike scum. .
Our country fought back in its Soviet way,
Roaring grenades shattered the day.
They came from the villages, climbed out of the mines,
Fought ragged "and hungry in every front line,
Till invading hordes were halted deaxd
By helmets of grey with stars of red.

More than once in the years 1918-20 terrible perils threatened the

- Soviet land. The slogan, “The Socialist motherland is in danger”,

ﬁrst heard in ‘February 1918, united‘ the workers, peasants, and the

' best elements of the intelligentsia in an unsparing struggle against

the numerous foes of the republic. ‘ , ,
Intervention was begun in February 1918 by the Germans, who

7 made good use of the opportunity afforded them by the treacherous

conduct of Trotsky-. Trotsky disobeyed the instructions given him
by Lenin, and on his own responsibility broke off negotiations with
the ‘German High Command ' at Brest-Litovsk. The Germans
thereupon advanced to Pskov and threatened Petrograd. In the
summer and autumn of 1918 .the White Guard Army invested
Tsaritsyn (Stalingrad). In the spring of 1918 another White
Guard leader, Admiral Kolchak, seized Kazan, and General Yuden-

itch marched against Petrograd (Leningrad). Pushed back once,

1920 «the Red. Army had to ﬁght Wrangel in the south and the

‘White Poles in the west. The struggle against the interventionists,
’ demanded the maximum effort on the part of the people. ~ In his

speech to the Red Army on November 7th-, 1941, Comrade Stalin

‘said about the position in 1918 :

“There was a time when our country was in an even more
diﬂicult r position. Remember 1918, when we celebrated the
ﬁrst anniversary of the October revolution. At that time three-
quarters of our country were in the hands of th: foreign inter-
ventionists. The Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the
Urals, Siberia, and the Far East were temporarily lost to us. We
had no allies, we had no Red Army-—we had only just begun to
create it. Welacked bread, we lacked arms, we lacked uniforms.
At that time fourteen states were attacking our country, but
we did not become disheartened. In the midst of _.the. con-

’ ﬂagration of war we organized the Red Armyvand converted
our country into a military camp. The spirit of our great Lenin
inspired us in the war against interventionists. And‘ what
happened? We defeated the interventionists, restored all lost
territories, and achieved victory.” . i

A‘ M At times the position was exceptionally difficult. Thus, in the
autumn of 1919 Siberia and the Far East were occupied by l1‘ite.l.’-‘
ventionists and*by the armies of White Guard generals. White

- Russia, the Ukraine, the Don, the North Caucasus, Transcaucasia,
C and part of Central Asia were also in the hands of White Guard»
and interventionist forces. The food situation was exceptionally

diﬂicult. There were times when in Moscow, Petrograd, and other

cities no bread or other foodstuffs were issued for days on end. \ The -
enemy was richer in armaments, had more commanders available,.
' and possessed greater military experience.‘ Our enemies were sure
that they would very shortly be able to seize the main centres and e
the two capitals of the country. The Red Army had no boots and

no uniforms. Armaments were insufficient, transport and industry
were disorganized. Soviet industry produced less than 20 per

cent of the production of Tsarist Russia. Factories closed down-

one after another owing to lack of fuel and other materiais.
Inthe middle of the summer of 1919 General Denikin ordered

Wherever the danger was greatest, wherever it was necessary
to strengthen discipline, wherever an iron hand and skilful guidance
were needed, the_Pafty sent Comrade Stalin. Once before this, in
1918,, the German imperialists had already attempted to seize
Tsaritsyn. I The German invaders supplied weapons to ‘the White
troops of Ataman Krasnov, and threw them in against Tsaritsyn.
The. loss of the city would have meant starvation for the Soviet
people,‘ because with Siberia occupied by the Whites and the
Ukraine under the German heel, food was obtainable only from the

‘ Volga andthe North Caucasus.

Lenin sent Cqmrade Stalin to save thetown. The indomitable

\ will of this leader of armies inspiredthe defenders of Tsaritsyn.
Thecity held out and Tsaritsyn was saved. In this period ‘Comrade

Stalin was doing a tremendous job of work in strengthening the
Red Army. To him is due the creation of a Soviet cavalry. The

plans he worked out for the destruction of Denikin, Yudenitch, and _ ‘C

other White Guard generals served as a- basis for the operations of
the Red Army. ' S L
In this struggle against the enemy the Communists accom-

plished‘ a tremendous task. Not only did they carry on political T if
,, work arhongst the masses, but fought in the ﬁrst ranks of the armed

struggle. On October 24th, 1919, Lenin said to the students of the

Lenin addressed a manifesto to theworkers and Red Army men
of Petrograd, in which he said:

“Comrades! The fate of Petrograd is being decided! The

enemy hopes to take us unawares. His forces areweak, even
insigniﬁcant, but he is strong through the rapidity of his move-
ments, theinsolence of his officers, and throughhis technique of
supplies and armaments. . . . We are much stronger than the
enemy.‘ Fight to the last drop of blood, comrades. Hold on
to every inch of ground. Be steadfast to the end. Victory is
,not far off ! Victory will be ours !”‘ -

Denikin was thrown back from Moscow and routed. Rbuted
was Yudenitch. Routed were General .Wrangel and Admiral
Kolchak, dictator of Siberia. Routed were all pther White Guard
The interventionists were driven out of the land of the
Soviets. ‘ ' '

The Red Army won because it knew what it was ﬁghting for. It' \
knew that the war it was carrying on was a righteous war, that it

was a war of liberation, a patriotic war. The Red Army was united

» with the people by ties of blood; it was protecting the people, and

the people responded by giving it their complete support and love.

S * The Red Army covered itself with undying glory in innumerable

battles against heavy odds; in the rear of the enemy valiant parti-
sans were waging a people’s war of extermination. Communists

and Young Communists stood in th §front ranks of this army; they i

gave the masses political education, explained the tasks arising
from the struggle, strengthened discipline, and inspired the ﬁghting-

men to heroic deeds, the fame of which will never perish. This"

war produced heroes such as Chapayev, Parkhomenko, Shors,
Finally, an important factor
was the assistance given,to the workers of our country by the
workers in other countries. With the slogan, “Hands off Russia”,

they created “committees of action”, demanding the lifting of the .
e blockade, the end of intervention, and the conclusion of a peace

greaty with the Soviet Government.

« 9-‘-.».~.4In this common armed struggle against the enemies of Soviet

power the peoples of the Soviet land learned to appreciate even

«war against the White Finns in 1939-40, and even earlier, in the I
battles of Khalkhin—Gol and of Lake. Hassan, the Red Army ‘R
demonstrated to the world that we have got the men ‘to defend our
Soviet country and the great achievements of the Socialist revolution S
of October, and, moreover, that we have got the necessary weapons. "
In view of the danger of a new intervention the Soviet Govern- ,
ment strove throughout the years to create mighty defences for the a ~
country. »In this the three Stalin Five-Year Plans played a most '
vital part. .
Let every citizen of the Soviet Union imagine for one moment
what would have been the terrible consequences had we failedto - ‘ ~
follow the advice anddirectives of Comrade Stalin in respect of the 
industrialization of our country. What could we have done against
the Hitlerite hordes if we had not had factories which in peace-
time produced. motor-cars, tractors, and agricultural machineiy, but
now, in wartime, give the front line what it needs, i.e. tanks,
armoured cars and aircraft? What could we have done without
our giant engineering plants, without our well-developed metal- ' ,0“
fl lurgical industry, without our tremendous supplies of non-ferrous I61

 _ « metals, without our hydroelectric ‘power stations, without the

_ v_ Kuzbas, without Karaganda, without hundreds of factories in the

i  » Urals, in Siberia, in the Far East, in Central Asia, in the territory _

‘ " beyond the Volga, and other regions of our country ? The enemy ~ -
would have crushed and enslavedus had we not followed the wise A “
‘directives of Stalin, had we notcarried out in time Stalin’s Five-
Year Plans for the Socialist transformation of our country, its
industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. ‘

Comrade Stalin also devoted the greatest care to the training of
ofﬁcers of all ranks for the Red Army. It is this corps of officers
which lead; the Red Army in this great patriotic war of the_.Soviet

The Red Army is an army which has its own distinctive qualities. . _

Some time ago Comrade Stalin deﬁned the three mostimportant
characteristics of the Red Army as follows : '

’ “The first and basic characteristic of our Red Army is that it
is the army of the liberated workers and peasants, the army of
gale October revolutioi, the army of the proletarian dictator-

ip. . . . ' 9 " * ‘

“The second characteristic of our Red Army is that it is a f ' to“
fraternal army of all‘peoples living in our country, an army f tha
. incorporating the liberation of all oppressed minorities in. our am
country, an army which defends the freedom-and independence  I eql;

of all peoples of our eountry.'. . . V 
“Finally, the third characteristic. of the Red Army is that’ it V  aga
is inspired by a spirit of internationalism. . . . Thepstrength of; T arif

my ' army has attacked the land of the Soviets? Have these char-
?‘-11‘ acteristics of the Red Army changed now, when the F2f§cist
10“ G brutes are subjecting the peoples of our country to. all the Nazi
115- T methods of extermination, all the vile and monstrous crimes of
m‘ the Nazi hangmen,«to all the violence and humiliation of Nazi
the — rule; when the hordes of the Hitlerites rob and ravage our
0$t ‘ ' country, torture, torment, burn and bury alive hundreds of
_ thousands of men and women of all ages and drive away millions
int 3 ‘into -Fascist slavery? No, these characteristics of the Red
10 T ~ Army have not changed. The Red Army is still waging a
319 righteous war of liberation. The object of this popular patriotic
3.St war against the Fascist oppressors is to ward off the danger
33- threatening our own country and to help all nations of Europe
at now groaning under the German-Fascist yoke.”
pué The tasks of the Red Army are quite precisely defined inan
a1- Order of the Day of the People’s Commissar of Defence dated ,_

bus February 23rd, 1942 : ‘ ‘

R: “The Red Army’s task is to liberate our Soviet territory from
my the German invaders; to liberate from the Nazi yoke the
ny » < msidents of our towns and villages who, before the war, were
ise { free and lived civilized lives, but who are now oppressed and
,e_ suffer pillage, ruin, and famine ; and lastly to liberate our women
its from the shame and infamy to which they are subjected by the
German-Fascist monsters. What could be more noble, more
of lofty, than such a task ? ._ . . The German soldier lacks any lofty,
TS no_ble aim which‘ could. inspire him and in which he could take
get pride. Any Red Army man, on the other hand, can proudly say
that he is waging a just war, a war of liberation, ‘a war for the
,3 freedom and independence of his motherland. The Red Army
 - pursues its noble and lofty war aim which inspires it to heroic
T deeds. This, properly speaking, explains why the patriotic war
brings forward thousands of heroes and heroines in our country
it V who are ready to face death for the freedom of their mother-
of _ land.”
>f-  In this Order of the Day Comrade Stalin stressed that-the Red

Army did not, and could not, harbour any feeling of racial hatred
8 _ towards other nations, including the German nation; he stressed
ﬂy 1 that the Red Army has been brought up to believe that all nations
ur h and races have equal rights and that therights of all nations must be
equally respected.

_ In the course of this great patriotic war of the Soviet people

it _ against Hitler Germany, new talented commanding cadres have
of my arisen and been developed and steeled to even higher efficiency.
61' S The time was ripe for the introduction of the full uniﬁcation of , ,
tll ; command in the Red Army. On October 10th, 1942, a Decree of - :7
cc‘ the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. was promul- —
 gated, introducing complete unit;/90f command and abolishing the A

a the lie to the Fascist myth of the “invincibility’»’ of the German

Army. It has annihilated several million Germansoldiers and’

“The system of military commissars set up in the Red Army ‘ 
during the civil war, had its origin in a certain lack of confidence’ 

in the officers, among whom there were a number’ of ‘military. A
specialists of the old army who at that time did not believe in \‘ 
the stability of Soviet power or were even hostile to it. During IN.‘ ‘ ‘-
the civil war the military commissars played a decisive part in 1 T
the strengthening of the Red Army and the selection of its 

commanders, in its political education and the inculcation of
military discipline. \ A ~

“In the years following the civil war the process of training

and educating commanders for the Red Army was carried 
further. As a result, of this, and under the inﬂuence of the 
successes and victories of the Soviet order in all spheres of life, 71
the position in the Red Army with regard to commanding
personnel was radically changed.

' “The great patriotic war against the German invaders steele_d
our commanding personnel, ‘brought forward a tremendous
number of new gifted commanders, who proved themselves in
battle and who were devoted to the death to their military duty,
and jealous of their honour as commanders. .In embittered
battles with the enemy the commanders of the Red Army proved
their loyalty to our country, acquired considerable experience
in the conduct of modern war, and developed greatly both in
military and political maturity.

“On the other hand, the military commissars and political
instructors increased their knowledge of military matters, -and
acquired.a wealth of experience of modern warfare; Some of
these have already been appointed to posts as commanders and .
are successfully commanding troops, and many others will be ‘
appointed to such posts either at once or after a certainamount
of military training. ‘ ’ :4

‘‘All these new circumstances, arising from the growth of our T
political and commanding cadres, bear witness to the fact that
there is no longer any basis for the retention of the system of
military commissars. What is more, the further existence of _-x
the institution «of military commissars, might act as a brake to F?
improvements in the leadership of the troops, and put the com- ,
missars themselves in a false position. *

“Therefore it is now considered opportune to abolish the
institution of military commissars in the Red Army, establish
full unity of command, and lay on the shoulders of the corn

controlling interests in large-scale metallurgy, coal-mining, the oil

and engineering industries. Engineering and heavy industry in
general were little developed in T sarist Russia. Approximately

three-quarters of the population were engaged in agriculture, from A

which. about two-thirds of the national income was derived.
Industrial development was lagging far behind the industries of
other capitalist countries.
world war, the production of Russian industry was fourteen and a
half times less than that of the United States, four and a half times

less than that of England, nearly six times less than that of Germany‘, .
and two and a half times less than that of France. If we take the .

production ﬁgures per head of population, Russia showed an even
greater backwardness.
Tsarist Russia in 1913 was 21-4 times less than in the United States,

"14 times less than in England, and 13 times less than in Germany.

This backwardness of industry in Tsarist Russia made itself felt
with special weight during the ﬁrst world war and afterwards.

Even before the Socialist October revolution Lenin wrote that
Russia was threatened with a catastrophe. It was the Socialist
October revolution which saved Russia from this catastroplm,
from this shipwreck and destruction. But the heritage which the
workers took over from the Tsarist Government and the landlords
and capitalists was a country in a complete state of economic
dissolution. ,

In May 1918, Lenin wrote in his Letter to the Workers of “ _

Petrograd : -
“Romanov and Kerensky left as a heritage to the working class

a country utterly impoverished by their predatory, criminal, and ‘V
most burdensome war, a country picked clean by Russian and

foreign imperialists. Food will sufﬁce for all 'only if we keep
the strictest /account of every pood, only if every pood is
distributed absolutely systematically. There is also an acute

shortage of food for machines, i.e. fuel: the railroads and fac- A »

tories will come to a standstill, unemployment and famine will
ruin the nation if we do not bend every effort to establish a
‘ruthless economy of consumption and proper distribution. ,We
are_faced by disaster, it has drawn terribly near.”

A state monopoly of grain was introduced in order to prevent

the kulaks and black marketeers from proﬁteering through the .

starvation of the workers. Factories, banks, and means of transport
were nationalized. There can be no doubt that these economic
measures were indispensable.
permeated the whole economic life of the country. This policy’

consisted in the following: In order to satisfy defence needs and -:1 ‘I

feed the cities, the Soviet state was compelled to take all surplus

~.away from the peasants by means of a tax in-kind. It was also

compelled to adopt a strict control of consumption. As longlas the

war with the White Guards and the interventionists lasted, the

peasants were quite willing to make sacriﬁces. Butas soon as the

civil war was over and the intervention ended, all forces of the

intervention. The country was .in a state of fearful disruption.
Hundreds of bridges throughout the country had been blown up,
railway rolling-stock destroyed and worn out; smashed railway
engines and trucks littered all railway sidings. Many factories

i ‘ were at a standstill, their chimneys emitted no smoke, their life
 , l was paralysed; spiders spun their webs on the machines, many of

the workers left the factories for the villages. In the biggest
_ factories the workers spent their time making lighters, saucepans,‘
K and pokers to barter them for food. It was a very difficult time.
> T 9 Agriculture was also seriously damaged, but not to such an extent
a as industry. The area sown was greatly reduced, stocks of horses
and cattle declined, agriculture, in any case very backward, was

/

at . And as industry was little developed, and, therefore, there were
few commodities available for the villages, the continuation of the
policy of war communism caused discontent among the peasants.
In 1921 a new economic policy (N.E.P.) was substituted for the
policy of war communism, and the principle of requisitioning ‘all
surplus was replaced by a ﬁxed tax in kind. Private trade was per-

The Soviet state, led by the Bolshevik Party, reconstructed its
national economy step by step. The railways and many plants and
factories were reconstnucted and the workers began to return to
, _ their machines. 4 ' V
S 5 ’ Lenin drew up a plan for the electriﬁcation of the country and
‘S the creation of large—scale industry as the foundation for a Socialist
economy. ~
, _ i As long ago as 1847 Marx and Engels, when they wrote their
.x ‘T Communist Manifesto, pointed out that a victorious working class

' 7   .+ wouldhave to take into its own hands all means and instruments of

. production in order to increase as quickly as possible the productive

_ __ forces /of the country, the quantity of state factories, and of instru-
.. ‘ ‘ ments of production. '

 But not only the quantity of the factories and plants had to be

increased, it was also necessary to create a completely new industry

3 —Socialist industry. It was necessary to create ‘an industry so

str'ong and so advanced that it could serve as a foundation for the
transformation of the whole economic life of the country.
In order to speed up reconstruction of the devastated national‘
economy, “Communist Saturdays” (subotiziks) and “Sundays”
_(vosclzresniks) were organized on the initiativeof the workers. Lenin-

-4

‘ I ' called this “thegreat initiative of Communist labour”, and wrote of
it that the profoundest source of strength for the people in its.

_ struggle against the ‘exploiters and “the only guarantee of the
L 1 solidity and irreversibility of its victories can be only'a new higher

production”. , ,  i
It was of special importance to further the creation of large-_ * ‘ *
scale industry and to electrify a peasant country such as Russia was 3 ‘
at the time. ‘ ‘
Lenin pointed out that without a highly developed large-scale 1 
industry there can be no question of Socialism in general, especially
in a peasant country. . 5 
Lenin insistently advocated electriﬁcation. In the report of the 0‘ 
Government given to the Eighth Congress of Soviets, he said that  A
we had not yet torn up the roots of ‘capitalism in the villages and 7 r;_:,
not yet destroyed the foundations of capitalism: . ‘ 5 *

“Capitalism is holding out by means of small-scale economy,
and in order to undermine it we must transfer theiwhole economy _
of the country, including agriculture, to a new technical basis,the~
technical basis of contemporary large-scale production. Only 1'.‘
electricity provides sucha basis. T _ I. 

A “Communism is Soviet power plus the electriﬁcation of the :
whole country. Unless this is achieved the country will remain ..
a country of small peasants, and it is necessary that we should ‘
clearly understand this. Having understood it, we will see to it 7 V
that our economic basis shall be transformed from a small   '
peasant basis to that of large—scale industry. Only, when our  
country is electriﬁed, when our industry, agriculture, and trans; 
port will be given the technical basis of contemporary large—scale .
industry, only then shall we achieve ﬁnal victory.”

A State Commission for Electriﬁcation (GOELRO) was created to 2  —
work out a plan for the building of electric power stations. The 
plan was to cover ten to ﬁfteen years, and every branch of the national j it
economy of the Soviet state was to be reconstructed‘ oniits basis. 3' T‘
Comrade Stalin not only gave his wholehearted support to Lenin on 1 A ’ 5
this point, but insisted on immediate practical measures and‘ g 
demanded that at least one-third of our total available labour should jp 
be devoted to the realization of this plan. _  } 

There were plenty of people both at home and abroad who ‘~  '
sneered at this plan and said it was not feasible—but he who  
laughs last laughs longest. Lenin’s plan of electriﬁcation was 5  
completed in advance of schedule. As early_ as 1928 we already . ~
possessed power stations with an aggregate capacity of 1,900,000 .
kilowatts. Accordingto plan, it was proposed that in ten to ﬁfteen ~
years we should be winding 2-} to 3 milliard pood, i.e. 40 to 48 million  _
tons, of coal per annum. However, only seven years later (in the T .if g‘
year 1927-28) the coal production of the U.S.S.R. was already 37 ‘:  “C

million tons, and in 1932 it was 64 million tons; that is to say, the *’  fl
plan was considerably outstripped. ' — 2 1]

For the establishment of Socialism in the villages Lenin pro- V  1';
posed a plan of co-operation. This plan envisaged not only the “ . a.

  

participation of the entire working population in consumers’
co-operatives, but also the creation of handicraft co-operatives, and

.. ~_ship of the Bolshevik Party, inspired by Comrade Stalin, it boldly
“ undertook the gigantic taslc of a Socialist transformation of the

 

 especially of productive co-operatives. The collective farms were an

integral part of this co-operative plan of Len'u1’s. Lenin regarded

. ' co-operation as ‘the best, simplest, easiest, and most accessible road

towards Socialism.

“As a matter of fact” (he wrote in January 1923), “the power
of state over all large-scale means of production, the power of
state in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance of this pro-
letariat with the many millions of small and very small peasants,
the assured leadership of the peasantry by the proletariat, etc.-
is not this all that is necessary in order to build a complete
Socialist society out of the co—operatives, out of just the co-opera-
tives and nothing else ? This is not yet the building of a Socialist
society, but it is all that is needed and suﬂicient for building it.”

This plan was carried out at the cost of persistent, heroic

" labour.

When Lenin died the whole weight of the struggle for the indus-

_,: trialization of the country and for the creation of collective farms in ‘
 u the villages was placed on the shoulders of Comrade Stalin.. The
5., resistance of the kulaks and their followers had to be overcome.
T 3 It was also necessary to overcome the res'stance of the numerous
“ opponents of industrialization, who did not believe in a victory of
Socialism in our country, and did not want such a victory. It

was necessary to overcome the ﬁerce resistance of the enemies of the

people, of the Right Wing opportunists, who wanted to restore

capitalism, such as Rykov, Bulcharin, Kamenev, Zinoviev, and
many of their followers. It was necessary to uproot the Troskyist

' gang which did its best to frustrate all measures of the Party directed
towards the creation of a Socialist economy and ensuring the victory v

of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.
What wasto be the ﬁrst step in this Socialist offensive ? Comrade
talin said:

“The accomplishment of this gigantic task must begin with
the industrialization of the country. The Socialist industri-
alization of the country is the fundamental link of the chain with

T which we must begin the building up of a. Socialist national’

economy.

“The essence and the foundation of our general line is the
transformation of our country from an agrarian; into an indus-
trial country capable of producing all its indispensable equipment
with its own resources.”

The strength and the power of the Socialist revolution of

‘October and the Soviet order created by this revolution consists in

the fact that all means for this transformation were created inside

the country.and that it was the people itself which found in its own V

midst themeans for such a transformation. The people overcame
alldiﬁiculties of the period of reconstruction, and under the leader-

whole country. New». engineering, machine-tool, motor-car,
tractor, chemical and metallurgical, locomotive, and other factories
were set up; equipment for electric power stations was manu-
factured; in short, many branches of industry which had not
existed in Tsarist Russia were now established for the ﬁrst time.
Coal and oil productionwere greatly increased. Unemployment , .
was abolished. Dozens of new towns and cities, hundreds of giant T,  . e
plants, were built. The funds for all this were found by practising , .. '
the greatest thrift throughout our national economy Government Q _
loans always enjoyed, and are still enjoying, the unaiiimous support / T
of the whole population. In no other country do -Government 4+‘ 
loans meet with such success and get taken up so quickly and so ' '
completely as in the U.S.S.R. . ‘

One after the other, the three Stalin Five-Year Plans were care- ~ Ts ’ ’ ‘
fully worked out. They transformed the ‘land of the Soviets and
turned it into a mighty industrial power with vast factories of the
- highest order. This industrialization of the country rendered  ” '
possible the complete collectivization of agriculture. ’

The Fifteenth Party Congress had laid down the directives for
the drafting of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan for the development of T
national economy. In these directives much space was devoted to
the collectivization of agriculture and to measures destined to assist
wide sections of the peasantry in passing over to collective farming. =

This was a diﬂicult period in the life of the Soviet state. The " *
international situation was tense, and plans of intervention against
the Soviets were made in various capitalist countries. The kulaks ; 1.5;
made‘ a desperate stand against collectivization. But the Soviet "
Government broke the resistance of the kulaks and other bourgeois
elements and succeeded in avoiding war despite all difﬁculties.
However, bearing in mind the possibility of military aggression   »
against the Soviet State, the Fifteenth Party Congress decided that] 
in the drafting of the F ive-Year Plan the greatest attention should be :3 1;, i
devoted to those branches of national economy in general, and of , ‘ L; 
. industry inparticular, which would play the most important part in , l  '
the defence and economic stability of the country in the event of
war. ' ‘ - .

What was the fundamental task of the ‘ﬁrst Five-Year Plan?
‘ It was to transfer our country, with its backward, and inlparts ,
mediaeval, technique, to the rails of a new contemporary technical I v ,
development. “To transform the U.S.S.R. from a weak, agrarian
country, dependent on the caprices of the capitalist countries, into .  
a mighty industrial country completely self-reliant and independent  . ..
of the caprices of world-capitalism . . . to drive out without“  J,
mercy the capitalist elements, to widen the front of the Socialist 75 
A . forms of economy, and to create the economic base for the abolition V 
of classes in the U.S.S.R. and for the construction of a Socialist
society . . . to create 'in our country an industry which would be
capable of ire-equipping and organizing not only the whole of our ,
industry but also our transport and our agriculture on a Socialist , *
basis . V. . to transform our small-scale and scattered agriculture

 

  
 

  

  

 

 

into large-scale collective economy, so as to ensure the economic

base for Socialism in the rural districts and thus to eliminate the
possibility of the restoration of capitalism in the U.S.S.R. . ._ . to
create in the country all the necessary technical and economic pre-
requisities for increasing to the utmost the defensive‘ capacity of the
country, to enable it to organize determined resistance to any and
every attempt at military intervention or military aggression from
outside, to any and every attempt at military attack from without.”
In the period of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan of Socialist transfor-

. . I mation it was already proposed to invest 64-6 milliard roubles in
, ‘ capital equipment, comparing favourably with the 26-5 milliard

roubles invested for this purpose during the preceding ﬁve years.

Large-scale metallurgical works such as Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk

were built in this period. Eurther, 1500 new factories and mighty
electric power stations were built during the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan

“ _ and new coalﬁelds were opened up. ~ At the end of the ﬁrst Five-

Year Plan the U.S.S.R. had pushed up to second place after the
U.S.A. in the production of oil. The production of motor-cars,
tractors, harvester-combines, aeroplanes, machine tools, and
chemical products contributed to a considerable increase in the
defensive strength of the Soviet Union. Finally, the industrializa-
tion of the country helped the peasants in speeding up the collec-
tivization of agriculture. 6

’ The year 1929 was the great turning-point. In an article entitled
“A Year of Great Change”, Comrade Stalin wrote : “We are driving
full steam ahead towards industrialization and towards'Socialism,
and are leaving our traditional Russian backwardness far behind.”

- A - The ﬁrst Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in 
A four years and three months. It was also over-fulﬁlled in respect
' of industry by almost 50 per cent. In 1913, just before the ﬁrst

world war, industrial production in Tsarist Russia constituted only
42 per cent of the total production of the country. In 1929 this
ﬁgure rose to 54-5 per cent, and in 1932 to 70-7 per cent. Agriculture

 , in Tsarist Russia accounted for 58 per cent of the total production =
‘ of the country; by 1929 agriculture was 45-5 per cent, and in 1932

29-3 per cent, of the production total. In other words, the ﬁrst

_ ‘Five-Year Plan had already transformed the Soviet Union from a

predominantly agrarian into a predominantly industrial country.
On. January 26th, 1934, the Seventeenth Congress of the B01-

shevik Party met in Moscow. This Congress will be recorded in

p ' history as the Congress of the Victors. By this time great. victories

» had been won for Socialism in our country. The Seventeenth
’ ‘ Congress approved a second Five-Year Plan of Socialist transfor-

mation. . 4 s

“The basic political task of the second Five-Year Plan is the
ﬁnal liquidation of capitalist elements and of classes in general;
the ﬁnal annihilation of the causes which lea.d to class differences.

and to exploitation ; the overcoming of all remnants of capitalism .
both in our economy and in the consciousness of our people ;,

society.”

But in order to fulﬁl such a task it was necessary to transform
even further the entire technicalbasis of our national economy,

we had to learn new techniques, greatly increase the productvity
'of labour, and reduce production costs. ,, However, this very
difficult task was accomplished and the Eighteenth Party’Congress

was already in a position to outline a further Five-Year Plan. The . '1

fulﬁlment of this task led to an even more rapid rise in the living
standards of industrial workers and collective farmers, considerably

increased the real wages of manual and clerical workers, and ~  7
" greatly increased the consumption of all goods by the working

population. . .

During theyears of the second Five—Year Plan, 114-7 .milliard
roubles had been‘invested .in capital equipment of our national
economy. The third Five-Year Plan made provision for the
investment of 192 milliard roubles. Such was the tremendous
growth of the national wealth during the years embraced by the
three Stalin Five—Year Plans.

The Eighteenth All-Union Party .Conference summed up the 0 C 

results of the ﬁrst three years of the third Five-Year Plan. According
t-o a report made by Comrade Voznesenski to the Eighteenth Party
Conferenbe on the ﬁrst three years of the third Five—Year Plan, avail-
able facilities _for the State industry—‘—exclusive of regional industries
of local importanoe—were increased by approximately 2900 factories
and works, pits, power stations, and other enterprises.‘ As a result

of the work of new enterprises established in the three years of the’ -

third Five—Year Plan, 51,000,000 tons of coal had been raised from
new pits, about 2,400,000 ‘kilowatts of electricity obtained from new
‘power stations, 2,900,000‘ tons of iron smelted in new furnaces,
about 1,000,000 new cotton-spinning spindles put into operation,
and further productive capacity established.

In the spring of 1941 the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. (B)   s

and the Council of Peoples’ Commissars of the U.S.S.R. instructed

the State Planning Commission to draw up a general economic’ 2 .5. '0
‘plan to be operated for ﬁfteen years and calculated to outstrip the ‘

principal capitalist countries in the production per head of popu-'

. lation of iron, steel, all sorts of fuel, electric energy, machine tools" S  N
and other means of production as well as consumption goods. Had ,_j  “
we not been perﬁdiously attacked by the hordes of Hitler, our   ‘

country would be moving forward today with giant strides towards a
further increase in our economic capacity and powers of defence.

The Socialist transformation of agriculture was undertaken hand ‘
in hand with theindustrialization of our Soviet land. From the very
ﬁrst days of the existence of Soviet power, part of the land formerly '

, owned by landlords had been turned into Soviet estates; At the
same time communes and agricultural artels were coming into being,
i — A ‘W i - 29 .

  

 

prises. Kulaks, their followers, and other parasitic elements did
thelr‘ best to compromise the success of such collective farms, often
even joining them and turning them into “kulak collective farms”

 
 

 

in the villages." _Howevcr, the peasants were at ﬁrst insuﬂiciently '
experienced to make a success of these new and complicated en_t’,er- .

with the object of undermining and destroying them from inside. _ .

They damaged the machines, killed the cattle, interfered with the
sowing, burnt the harvest, and even murdered active village collec-
tivists, etc. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet Government
meanwhile did everything in their power tohelp the peasants in
setting up such collective farms.

When the Fifth Congress of Soviets, held in May ]929,.drew up . j‘ 

and ratiﬁed the first Five-Year Plan for Socialist Reconstruction, it
enumerated among the most important -tasks the transformation of

the Soviet Unionfrom an agrarian country into a country of Socialist '

industry, i.e. the task of industrialization.
At the same time the task of collectivizing agriculture was also
outlined. It_was necessary to help the peasants in transforming their

small-scale peasant farms into large-scale socialized collective estates. ,  

“A year of great change” was what Stalin called the year 1929,

when the success of industrialization permitted the "Government to .

dispatch a large number of agricultural machines to the villages and
thus facilitate the mass entry of peasants into the farming co-opera-
tives. The collective farms were turned into “a hi gh-roa ” of rural
social development. Despite the infamous wrecking activities of
the enemies of the people, the peasants joined the collective farms
by_ whole villages and even whole regions, and it was not only the
poorest peasants who joined the collectives.- This was. the basis of
that radical change in the development of agriculture which took place
in 1929, and which was one of the greatest victories won by Soviet

power. .

In the Short History of the Q.P.S. U. (B) this transition was deﬁned
by Comrade Stalin a&“a profound revolution, a leap from an old
qualitative state of society to a new qualitative state, equivalent in
its consequences to the revolution of October 1917 .” ‘ 7

The peculiarity of this revolution was that it was carried out
from above on the initiative of the Government but with direct

support from below from the millions of peasants who were ﬁghting

for a free life on the collective farms and trying to shake oil‘ the kulak
inﬂuence.

At the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock ' V 

Worlcrs, Comrade Stalin gave this deﬁnition of the changes which

. had taken place in the rural areas as a result of the victory of

  

collective agriculture:

“An achievement of ours is that we have helped millions of

poor peasants to join the collective farms. It is an achievement

\ v of ours that by joining the collective farms, where they have at
their disposal the best land and the finest implements of pro.-.
duction, millions of poor peas§.(r)1ts have risen to the level of midd

   

 

, peasants. ‘It is an achievement of ours that millions ofipoorwi H

peasants who formerly lived in penury have now, in the collective
farms, become middle peasants, have attained material security.

_ It is an achievement of ours that we have put a stop to the

differentiation of the peasants into poor peasants and kulaks;
that we have routed the kulaks and have helped the poor peasants
to become masters of their own labour in the collective farms, to
become middle peasants. —

“What was the situation before collective farm development
was launched, about fouryears ago ? The kulaks were growing
rich and were on the upgrade. The poor peasants were becom-
ing poorer, were sinking into ruin and falling into bondage to
the kulaks. The middle peasants were trying to make the grade
and catch up with the kulaks, but they were continually losing
their hold, tumbling down, and swelling the _ranks of the poor
peasants, to the amusement of the kulaks. It is not diﬁicult to
see that the only ones to proﬁt by this scramble were the kulaks,
and perhaps, here and there, some of the other well-to-do
peasants. Out of every hundred households in the rural
districts you could count four to ﬁve kulak households, eight or
ten well-to-do peasant households, forty-ﬁve to ﬁfty middle-
peasant households, and thirty-ﬁve poor-peasant households.
Hence, at the lowest estimate, 35 per cent of all the peasant
households were poor-peasant households, compelled to bear
the yoke of kulak bondage. This is apart from the poorer
swion of the middle peasants, representing more than half of
the middle peasantry, whose condition differed very little from
that of the poor peasants and who were directly dependent
upon the kulaks. .

“By developing collective farm construction we have suc-
ceeded in abolishing this scramble and injustice; we have

‘ smashed the yoke of kulak bondage, brought this vast mass _
of poor peasants into the collective farms, given them material

security there, and raised them to the level of middle peasants,
having at their disposal collective farm land, enjoying the
privileges granted to collective farms and the use of tractors and
agricultural machinery.

“And what does this mean? It- means that no less than
twenty million of ‘the peasant population, no less than twenty
million poor peasants, have been rescued from poverty and ruin,
_have been rescued from kulak bondage, and have attained
material security thanks to the collective farms.

“This is a great achievement, comrades. It is an achieve-
ment such as has never been known in the world before, such as

- no other state in the world has yet scored.

"These, then, are the practical, tangible results of collective
farm development, the results of the fact that the peasants have
taken the collective farm path. ‘

“But this is only our ﬁrst step, our first achievement on the
path of collective farm development.”

* No data.

In twenty-ﬁve years the collective farms and "Soviet estates have ‘

absorbed tens of millions of hectares (1 hectare = 52% acres approx.)
of new land. They have ploughed up Nvirgin soil, cleared bush
land, drained swamps, and turned” the morasses of Byelorussia

, into arable land. Tens of. thousands of hectares of swampy, 

malaria-infested regions in Georgia were turned into ’”a land of
plenty. Numerous canals were constructed in Central Asia, such
as the Fergan Canal, Chuisk Canal, and others. The Bolsheviks

cut the White-Sea-Baltic Canal through the empty wastelands of '

the North. They laid down mighty railway lines across the tundra,
across virgin forests, across mountains and deserts. It suﬂices to
mention the Turkestan-Siberian Railway. They built arterial
roads in the mountains of the Pamir plateau. , I
Comrade Stalin put forward a task : to make all collective farmers
prosperous. Before the revolution, 65 per cent of peasant families
were classed. as poor, 20 per cent as moderately well—to-do, and 15 per
cent as kulaks; 30 per cent of peasant households owned no horse,
34 per cent had no instruments of production and no animals, and
15 per cent of the peasant households had no land under cultivation
at all. Collective farming ‘did away with all this inequality. The
division into poor, moderately well-to-do, and kulak households
disappeared. The kulaks were liquidated as a classsand the basis
for the enrichment of some at the expense of others has been
eliminated in the villages. V , . e
The condition for the increase in the well-being of each member
of the collective is his own labour, and his own labour only. For
his personal requirements each member of the collective is given an

allotment for a garden and orchard, and members of the collective  

may also own their own poultry, sheep, goats and cattle,’ pigs,
rabbits, or other domestic animals for their private use. Before the
revolution the peasants owned 214-7 million hectares f land. The

hectares. _In other words, the revolution gave’ the peasants more
than 150»million hectares. On the same date, 51-1 million hectares

: _ were occupied by large-scale Soviet estates. Hence, on May 1st,

1937, the area under agricultural cultivation in the U.S.S.R.
amounted to 421-91 million hecta‘res.e Since- then another few
million hectares of virgin soil have ‘been turned up. The culture of
wheat has spread far into the North, and of beetroot into Central
Asia, Siberia, andthe Far East. Some of the collective farms have
turned themselves into “millionaires”. Tens of thousands of
collective farmers have received decorations and medals for zealous‘
work in the collectives, or for special achievements. As a result of
industrialization, agriculture has obtained a tremendous quantity of
machinery. At the end of 1938 about half a million tractors and
over 150,000 harvester-combines were in use in agriculture. Plough-
ing had been mechanized in a proportion ‘of over 71 per cent,
sowing to over 56-7 per cent, harvesting to 48-4 per cent. In 1939
agriculture used over seventeen times as much mineral fertilizers as
had been used in Tsarist Russia before the last war. Sown areas .
increased by over 30,000,000 hectares and average crops increased
greatly. A target has been set to increase the production of grain
to 8_ milliard poods per annum. The areas sown with technical
crops,are also on the increase, and cotton areas have increased to
almost four times their former extent.

The establishment of a Socialist society demands the creation of

- a new labour discipline, of a new communistic attitude towards

labour, a new, higher productivity of labour as compared with that
existing in capitalist society. Twenty-ﬁve years of experience in the
struggle for Socialism in the U.S.S.R. have shown that it is impossible
to set up a Socialist ‘society without such changes.

We have now reached a level in our building of a Socialist society

. on which “each works according to his ability and receives articles of
- consumption, not according to his needs, but according to the work

he performs for society”. (Stalin : Leninism, Eng. Ed., p. 546 et seq.)

The’ consciousness on the part of the workers that they are
working for themselves, and not for an exploiter, transforms their
attitude towards labour. The consciousness that all workers are
striving towards the great object of creating a communist society in
which “each works according-to his ability and receives articles of
consumption, not according to the work he performs, but according

0’  . to his needs as a culturally developed individual” (ibia’.), this
. consciousness evokes among the advanced builders of a Socialist
; society a great enthusiasm, a passionate devotion to the struggle for

such a society. . This consciousness gives rise to profound "and fertile

.creative thought, to inventiveness and ingenuity.

This was the soil from which the Stakhanov movement grew;
one of the forms of Socialist competition in the Soviet Union which

. ~ expresses “the new wave of Socialist emulation, a new and higher
stage of Socialist emulation” (ibid.) which was made possible by the

introduction of new technical methods. /

;other Stakhanovites, are all new types, people of "a special kind who

have completely mastered the technicalitiesof their jobs and are

boldly marching forward. _ ,
_ Comrade Stalin deﬁned the Stakhanov movement at the ﬁrst
All-Union conference of Stakhanovites in November 1935 as:

a movement which is shattering the old technical standards, ’
the olddesigned capacities, and the old production plans. . . .
It is destined to make a revolution in our industry. That is
why the Stakhanov movement is at bottom a profoundly revo-
lutionary movement” (ibid.). ‘ ‘

Among the causes which brought about the Stakhanov move?

‘ment one should note the radical improvement in the living

standards of the workers, the non-existence of exploitation, the
availability of new improved technical facilities, and the springing-

'up of new personnel cadres. Finally, it goes without saying that‘

such a movement could only be created by participants in Socialist
construction with a high level of political consciousness; The
presence of all these conditions laid the foundations of the Stak- ,
hanov movement, which was, and is, of tremendous importance in

speeding up production, opening up new sources of raw materials ‘

and energy, and in ﬁnding new methods of work, new standards of
productivity, which often leave the records established in capitalist.

economy far behind.

During the present war this movement manifested its great ‘i
strength, especially in the summer and autumn of 1942. Despite
the very complicated situation, the many privations and other
difﬁculties which had to be overcome, the productivity of labour

was greatly increased in industry, agriculture, and transport as a, '

result of the development of the Stakhanov movement and the wide-

spread application of the methods of Socialist emulation. It is , T

signiﬁcant that‘ among the laureates crowned with the Stalin Prize we
ﬁnd not only scientists, and great actors and artists of our «country,

but also leading Stakhanovite workers who have found new methods E

of work.

i In accordance with the requirements of our national economy, V
railway, sea, and river transport developed greatly in the last twenty-
ﬁve years. On the eve of the great Socialist revolution of October,
Lenin wrote: “Russia is threatened by an inevitable catastrophe.
Railway transport is incredibly disorganized and the situation :
deteriorates more and more. / The railways will come to a stand- ’
still.” " ~ 

_At. the end of the civil war railway transport was in a very

difficult position. Damaged trucks and engines needed to. be 

repaired, the quantity of rolling-stock had to be incre,ased,,the ‘

0 condition of the ‘permanent way had to be improved. It was
necessary for this purpose not only to recondition the old railway
workshops and reopen the old factories manufacturingengines and

railway trucks, but to build many new ones. Soviet engineers
designed and Soviet workers made in Soviet factories the new JS
(Joseph Stalin), FD (Felix Dzerzhinski), and SO (Sergo Ordzhoni-
kidze) engines. Considerable stretches of railway line were
electriﬁed. Diesel engines were put in commission on lines travers-
ing waterless regions. The rolling-stock was almost entirely
renewed. The new mighty locomotives made possible the hauling
of trains with a capacity of over 2000 tons at higher speeds than
before. Loading operations were mechanized by means of a large
number of machines.

Lunin and Krivonos carried the Stakhanov movement into the

railway services, thus considerably improving transport conditions. ‘

Itis obvious that without a mighty transport network it would
have been impossible to cope with the tasks our railways had to
fulﬁl during the present patriotic war. The railways were faced
with the gigantic task of evacuating the populations of front-line
towns, of transferring whole industries, of transporting supplies for

the ﬁghting lines and carrying‘ immense armies from place to place.

Despite the many deﬁciencies of Soviet railway transport, the rail-
ways proved themselves equal to these enormous requirements.

The same applies to the waterways, which play a part of the
greatest importance in the national economy and defence of the
country owing to the fact that there are many great rivers in the
territory of the U.S.S.R. The Soviet Government has built many
important water projects, such as the Volkhov Dam, the Stalin

White-Sea-Baltic Canal, the Moscow-Volga Canal, and the Uglich .

and Rybinsk water by-passes. Thousands of miles of non-navigable
inland waters have been turned into ﬁrst-rate water highways by
the efforts of the Soviet people. A mighty ﬂeet has been created.
Dredging operations have been greatly developed. The main-

tenance and equipment of navigable waterways has been ‘very

considerably improved. Much attention has been given to the
raising of the material and cultural living standards of the manual
and clerical, workers on the inland waterways. Loading and
unloading operations have been extensively mechanized. In the

. present patriotic war of the Soviet people river transport has shown

 S‘ that twenty-ﬁve years, of Soviet power have left their mark on it,

 

that it has grown into an imposing force capable of coping with the
most intricate and exacting requirements of wartime transport. At
Stalingrad the Volga ﬂotilla. showed great courage in the struggle
against the German Fascist invaders and inﬂicted telling blows on the

0 , enemy. On the railways, inland waterways, and seaways transport

. "‘

heroes everywhere displayed great devotion to the Soviet people and

‘ great courage in the defence of the Socialist fatherland.
The sea transports of the U.S.S.R. have also greatly increased ,

during the ﬁrst quarter century of Soviet power. Before the revo-
lution the sea-going ships of Tsarist Russia were mostly in the hands‘-

 

  

 

 
       
   

‘of private shipping interests and were quite insuﬂicient to satisfy

the requirements of the country. Port installations were in a state
of neglect. During the years of Soviet power as profound changes
have been brought about in sea transport as in other ﬁelds. A
number of shipbuilding yards were constructed and old yards com-
pletely remodelled. Training establishments of all grades have been
set up for the training of personnel for rail, river, and sea transport.

There is still room for considerable improvement in the transport
system of the U.S.S.R. It has many deﬁciencies and does not

completely satisfy the requirements of the Soviet state. But rail,

sea, and river transport have all been greatly developed in the last
twenty-ﬁve years and now constitute amighty force.

One of the most diﬂicult problems was that of creating cadres
capable of directing all branches of administrative, economic, ~

cultural; scientiﬁc, and military work. A considerable section of
the old intelligentsia was closely linked up with the capitalists, land-
owners, and bureaucracy of the monarchy. This section of the
educated classes was hostile to the Socialist revolution of October
and sabotaged the Soviet Government for a long time. But the
best elements of the intelligentsia were gradually drawn into the
work: many were attracted and won‘ over by the unprecedented
scope of construction, the marvellous perspectives of prosperity for

the whole country.

However, this did not solve the problem of Socialist cadres, the
need for which became extraordinarily pressing when the Socialist
reconstruction of the country had led to the establishment of
advanced ‘technical facilities. Comrade Stalin devoted special

_ attention to the creation of such cadres. In his address to the ;
graduates from the Red Army Academies on May 4th, 1935, I

Comrade Stalin said:

“In order to set technique going and to utilize it to the full,‘ I I

we need people who have mastered techniq_ue,~.we need cadres
capable of mastering and utilizing this technique according to
all the rules of the art. Without people who have mastered
technique, technique is dead. In the charge of people who have
‘mastered technique, technique can and should perform miracles.
If in our ﬁrst-class mills and factories, in our state farms and

collective farms, in our transport system and in our Red Army ’

we had suﬂicient cadres capable of harnessing this technique
our country would secure results three times and four times as
great as at present. That is why emphasis must now be laid
on people, on cadres, on workers who have mastered technique.
That is why_.the old slogan, ‘Technique decides ‘everything’,
which is a reﬂection of a period already passed, a period in
which we suﬂ‘ered from a dearth in technique, .must now be

replaced by a new slogan, the slogan, ‘Cadres decide everything’. I

That is the main thing now.”

~ . The industrialization of the U.S.S.R. and the collectivization of
agriculture radically transformed the land of the Soviets. In his
report to the Eighteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U. (B) on the internal
situation in the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin described the successes
of the Soviet state, of its industry and agriculture, at a time when the
activities of the German Fascists were gaining momentum, and‘ the
threat of war was already quite close. Comrade Stalin sa.id:

I - “In the sphere of economic development we must regard the
most important result during the period under review to be the
fact that the reconstruction of industry and agriculture on the
basis of a new, modern technique has been completed. There
are no more, or hardly any more, old plants in our country, with
their old technique, and hardly any old peasant farms, with their
antediluvian equipment. Our industry and agriculture are now

based on new, up-to-date technique. It may be said without ’

exaggeration that from the standpoint of the technique of pro-
duction, from the standpoint of the degree of saturation of
industry and agriculture with new machinery, our country is
more advanced than any other country,‘ where the old machinery
acts as a fetter on production and hampers the introduction of
modern technique. * ‘

“In respect of the social and political development of our
country, the most important achievement during the period
under review was undoubtedly the ﬁnal elimination of the last
remnants of the exploiting classes, the union of workers, peasants,
and intellectuals in one common front of labour, the strengthen-
ing of the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the strength-

.ening of the ties of friendship between the various people
inhabiting our country, and, as a result of all this, the complete
democratization of the political life of the country as expressed
in the creation of the new Constitution. No one would dare'to
deny that our Constitution is the most democratic Constitution
in the world, and the results of the elections to the Supreme
Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and to the Supreme Soviets of the
Federated Republics the most representative.

“As a ﬁnal result of all this we have a complete stability of
our interior situation and such a stability of government in the
country which any government in the world might well regard
with envy” (ibid.). ‘ ,_._

An effect of the profound changes in the national economy of the
U.S.S.R. was the radical transformation of the class composition
of the population of the U.S.S.R. Although the basic classes, the
industrial workers and peasants, and the Socialist intelligentsia have
all remained, there are no deep-seated conﬂicts between these

T groups which might. lead to 'a struggle between them. The contra-
 , dictions which, in a capitalist society, lead to the class struggle, and
. hostilities, have disappeared in the U.S.S.R. Thus 1n these ﬁrst

twenty-ﬁve years that most diﬂicult historical task, the building of a
Socialist society, has’ in the main been solved. The table given

The war which Hitlerite Germany began againstthe U.S.S.R.

arrested the progress of the land of the ‘Soviets. It must be .re1nem— » l
bered, however, that it is only through thetremendous achievements _

of industrialization and agricultural collectivization that the

U.S.S.R. hasbeen able to wage this war successfully against Nazi T A ‘

Germany. This is a war of machines, and because it is a war of
machines industrialization played a tremendous part in the defence
of the country. This is a war pf modern heavy equipment, a war of

‘ reserves. The side‘ which disposes of more metal, more- oil and
more coal, more artillery, more riﬂes, more trench-mortars, more-
aeroplanes, more tanks and ammunition, and which can create

larger reserves of food and raw materials——that side will win.

In twenty-ﬁve years of Soviet power everything has been done
that could possibly be done in so short a time in a country dis-
organized, weakened, exhausted, and impoverished after the ﬁrst

imperialist world war, the civil war, and the wars of intervention-

Industrialization made possible a very considerable extension of
the railway system and of river and sea transport as well as§a
considerable increase in the navy. The Soviet Government not
only developed the oilﬁelds of the Caucasus around Grozny and
Baku, but. also developed the oil industries of the districts beyond
the Volga and in other partsof the country. We set ‘ourselves the
task of creating “a second Baku”, and achieved it to a considerable
extent. We also set ourselves the task, of creating “a second

 Donetz Basin” in the form of a vast coalﬁéld and metallurgical.

 
   
 

 

 region at Kuznetsk in Siberia, and this has been accomplished; we S S
' “ developed Karaganda and other anthracite coalﬁelds, and in
general’ expanded the coalmining and metallurgical industries in
’ Central Asia, Siberia, and the Far East. ,
All this considerably increased the defensive resources of the
country, so greatly needed now in the time of the great.patriotic
war of the ‘Soviet people against Nazi Germany, when a number of
vitally important regions in the Ukraine, the Donetz Basin, and
the Northern Caucasus were temporarily occupied by the enemy.
Our despicable enemies were hoping for an easy prey when they
set outto destroy the Soviet Union. They found to their surprise’
that in only twenty-five years the Socialist Soviet Government had
created a mighty industry and collective agriculture and was now a
great industrial Power possessing all the necessary means for the
-_ destruction of any enemy who might attempt to enslave the Soviet '
people.
i During the war hundreds of factories were evacuated from 
enemy-occupied regions to places far in the rear. Hundreds of 
new armament factories sprang into being. All the advantages of
the Soviet system found expression in this rapid adaptation of
Soviet industries to the requirements of war.
. In the course of this war collective agriculture also proved its
; ' superiority over other systems. Usually every war brings about a
' decline of agricultural production because the male population
.;  and the means of traction are mobilized for the armed forces.
; 3. In the Soviet State, however, sown areas in the_ territory not
occupied by the enemy have increased during the war; the average
. yield per acre has also increased, and despite the decrease in r in
4. 5;. I available traction and labour in agriculture, the ﬁelds were tilled, I 5;
1 A   ‘ the seed sown, and the crop harvested. , ,
T  ‘t I Hitler tried to win over the peasants in the German-occupied
districts of the Ukraine and Byelorussia ‘ by breaking up the
collective farms. However, this ideadid not work. The Soviet
peasants who had fought for their collective farms, who had created
them and had tasted life on collective farms, who had begun to
, grow rich under the Soviet system and live lives worth living, were
not prepared to give up their collective farms for any promises that
the enemy might make them. They are ﬁghting, and will continue
to ﬁght, for Soviet power and collective agriculture. i
The war will end some time, the enemy will be destroyed, the ~
remnants of his armies will be driven out of the Soviet land, and
the temporarily occupied districts, regions and republics will be
liberated again. The people will have to work hard in order to
restore what has been destroyed. But this reconstruction will be
very different from the reconstruction we were faced with after the
ﬁrst world war and the civil war. It will be undertaken at a much
higher speed and it will be much easier because, since then, Soviet
power has accumulated new mechanical equipment and created a
inighty industry. The factories which are now producing war

production of agricultural machinery and everything else which is
required for the reconstruction of our national economy. We have
also accumulated a tremendous wealth of political, economic, and
organizing experience. ‘ Soviet men andwomen have gathered much
' knowledge, and we have trained large numbers of Soviet intel-
lectuals from among the masses of the people, from among the
-workers and peasants, so that we now have plenty of agricultural
experts, engineers, technicians, doctors, etc. The ﬁghting men,
the commanders, the political instructors will return from the army,
not only covered with glory but also eager and anxious to build
up a happy life on the liberated earth. _ -

If today many of them are killed on the battleﬁelds while
defending our hallowed soil, the people know that we are ﬁghting
for a just cause, ﬁghting to liberate our country from the ﬁercest
enemies of mankind. We are ﬁghting in order that the Soviet people

‘may live in freedom in a free land. Then all the passion with which
we are now ﬁghting the enemy will be turned towards the work of
construction and reconstruction so that we may quickly heal the
wounds made by this war and bring to a new, rich ﬂowering our
peaceful life on our Soviet earth. '

The Brotherhood of Peoples is a Great Achievement of
the‘Socialz'st October Revolution A

TSARIST Russia was a prison of nations. Discord between the
various peoples inhabiting the- empire of the Romanoffs was

artiﬁcially created and-fostered. The policy of the Tsars was based ,

on the J esuitical maxim, “Divide and rule’ ’. The non-Russian nation-S
alities were called “subject races”; they were subjected to a policy
of national persecution and their national culture was suppressed.
Many districts of Tsarist Russia were inhabited by non-Russian
nationalities who were artiﬁcially kept on a low level of economic
development. Thus, for example, in the national republics‘ of Central
Asia there were no industries, no factories, and hardly any railways.
Tsarist Russia regarded these regions as colonies, and pursued the

policy usual in colonies towards the people inhabiting these regions. .

Nor was it rare for the Tsarist Government to -stimulate pogroms
against the Jews, the Armenians, or the Tatars. The policy of
Tsarism, of the bourgeoisie, and the landowners towards the"non-

Russian nationalities consisted in “eradicating among them all

rudiments of State organization, crippling their culture, suppressing
their own language, keeping them in ignorance, and ﬁnally Russi-

 fying them to the greatest possible extent. The results of such a
»policy were a political backwardness and under-development of

these peoples.”, . , .

alities, form part of the Soviet Union. The Socialist October
' Revolution was strong because it was supported by the nationalities
oppressed by Tsarism as well as by the others. The revolution
brought them freedom from national oppression.
Thus in the Socialist October revolution the struggle of the

the landowners, and the struggle of the peoples oppressed by

Tsarism for their national emancipation were all merged into one.

Some time before the ﬁrst Russian revolution of 1905 Comrade

Stalin already wrote in the journal Proletariatis Brdzola under the

‘ heading, “The Social Democratic Attitude to the National
' Question”: '

“As everybody knows, the object of all battles is victory,

but in order that the proletariat may win, all workers must be

. united irrespective of nationality. It is clear that the elimination
of national divisions and the close unity of Russian, Georgian,

condition for the victory of the Russian proletariat.”

After the Socialist revolution of October, the problem immedi-
, . ately arose as to what new relationships between the peoples of
‘__ the Soviet state should be created to take the place of the old
- conditions existing in Tsarist Russia. The task consistegl in :

“helping the working masses of non-Russian nationality to
overtake the more advanced central Russia, or, in other words,
in helping them: (a) to develop and strengthen the Soviet state
in their own midst and in forms adapted to the national and
traditional circumstances of these peoples; (b) to develop and
strengthen judicial, administrative, andeconomic services in their
,own language, so that all organs of power should consist of
local people well acquainted with the customs and‘psychology
of the local population; (c) to develop their own Press, schools,

_ theatres, clubs, and all other cultural and educative institutions
in their own language; (d) to create and develop a far-ﬂung

f  ‘  network of classes and schools both of a general educative and

- of a professional and technical character in their own language,

j  ‘ especially for the Kirghiz, Bashkir, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadjik,

, , Azerbaidjanian, Tartar, and Daghestanian peoples, in order that
_  ‘ there may be trained with the greatest possible expedition
— » ' cadres of native skilled workers and Soviet and party organizers
and administrators in all spheres of government and especially
; in the sphere of popular education.” ’

It was necessary to help the numerous nationalities of the East
to put an end to the patriarchal and feudal relationships within the

What were the results of twenty-ﬁve years of Soviet power?

_ A complete victory of the policy of Lenin and Stalin in respect of
_, the national minorities. They proved beyond a doubt that on the
basis of Socialism it was quite possible to form multinational
states and yet develop and strengthen the national culture of each

"1 I44 \9

nation. To the question how these victories could be explained, '

V  Comrade Stalin replied:

'  “The absence of exploiting classes, which are the principal
' ' organizers of strife between nations; the absence of exploitation,
,  , which cultivates mutual distrust and kindles nationalist passions ;
g  p the fact that power is in the hands of the working class, which
_  S is the foe of all enslavement and the true vehicle of the ideas
I . = .; of internationalism; the actual practice of mutual aid among the
= — > ‘ peoples in all ‘spheres of economic and social life; and, ﬁnally,
the ﬂourishing national culture of the peoples of the U.S.S.‘R.-—
culture which is national in form and Socialist in content-all
these and similar factors have brought about a radical change
in the aspect of the peoples of the U.S.S.R.; their feeling of
1  mutual distrust has disappeared, a feeling of ‘mutual friendship
’ ;; has developed among them, and thus real fraternal co-operation‘

 among the peoples has been established within the system of a
single federated state.

ist state, which has stood all tests, and whose stability might
well be‘ envied by any national state in any part of the world.”

.— In 1936 the new Constitution or fundamental law of the Union

of Socialist Soviet Republics was adopted after a report by Comrade
‘Stalin. VThis Constitution put into writing what had by this time
i . been achieved, that is to say the fact that Socialism as the ﬁrst
‘ phase of Communism had in the main been put into practice. The
7 basic principle of this phase of ,Comm1mism is, as everyone knows,
the formula: “From each according to his‘ abilities, to each
 according to his performance.” _ -
‘ 43

“That was the period when relations among the peoples ' C ‘

towards the Great-Russians had not yet disappeared, and when *

‘ . With regard to the national question, all bourgeois Constitutions V”

haveothis starting point:

“Bourgeois Constitutions tacitly proceed from the premise
that nations and races cannot have equal rights, that there are
nations with full rights and nations without full rights, and ./
that, in addition, there is a third category of nations or races,
for example in the colonies, which have even fewer rights than
the nations without full rights. This means that, at bottom,
all these Constitutions are nationalistic, i.e., Constitutions of
ruling nations.” '

But the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. on the basis of which the
peoples of the U.S.S.R. are living, ﬁghting, andare creating a new
world, is a quite different Constitution. In his report on the new
draft Constitution, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Con- *
stitution of the U.S.S.R. is above all profoundly international, in
contradistinction to the Constitutions of all other states. The

  

Soviet Constitution proceeds from the proposition that all nations ” ’

and races have equal rights; differences in skin, colour, in language,
in cultural level, or the level of State organization, or any other C
differences between races or nations, cannot serve as grounds for
justifying national inequality of rights; all nations and races,
irrespective of their past and present circumstances, irrespective of
their strength or their weaknesses, should enjoy equal rights in all
spheres of the economic, social, state and cultural life of society.

Many national republics have already celebrated the twentieth
anniversary of their existence, and have on this occasion reviewed
their experiences during the past twenty years. Ukrainians,’
Byelorussians, Georgians, Azerbaidjanians, Armenians, Uzbeks,
Tadjiks,‘ Kirghiz, Kazakhs, Turkmenians, and ‘dozens of other ‘
peoples of the U.S.S.R., have all acquired much experience in
these years and have gone through a many-sided schooling in in-
dependent political existence.

At the present‘ time the land of some of these republics is . 3. if A

occupied by the.Germans and their people are suﬂering under the
heel of the German imperialists, but nothing can suppress the
striving of the people of these republics and regions towards the
freedom which they enjoyed in the Soviet state. A

Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. (B) and the Council of People’s .. A. ‘ 

Commissars of the U.S.S.R. to the Federated and Autonomous
Republics on the occasion respectively of the ﬁfteenth and twentieth

In their greeting on the occasion of the ﬁfteenth anniversary 1/
of the establishment of the Kirghiz S.S.R.,,the Central Committee .
of the C.P.S.U. and the Council of People’s Commissars of the
U.S.S.R. wrote on February 1st, 1941 :

A “The great Socialist revolution of October has for ever liber-
ated the Kirghiz people from capitalist nationalist enslavement,
from the yoke of the feudal khans, beys, and manaps. Under
the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the workers of Kirghizia
have turned their country, formerly a backward Tsarist colony,
into a ﬂourishing Socialist Soviet Republic.

‘ “During the years of Soviet power a Socialist industry
rapidly developed in Kirghizia. In the coalﬁelds, old pits have
been reconstructed and new pits sunk. . . . The production of

. coal has increased from 103,000 tons in 1913 to 1,383,000 tons
in l94%0. A totally new industry is the metallurgy of non-ferrous
meta s. . . .

“The backward, nomadic cultivation of Kirghizia has been
transformed into large-scale Socialist agriculture equipped with
‘the newest machinery. . . .
“The culture of the Kirghiz people is developing rapidly.
“Extensive cadres of a native Kirghiz intelligentsia have
. been created in the republic. Literacy among the Kirghiz
population has grown to twelve "times its extent at the time of
the establishment of Soviet power. School-children now number
over 320,000 in the schools of Kirghizia, i.e., forty-four times
the number in pre-revolutionary times.” -

In an article written byComrade Kuliev, Chairman of the Coun- 3- ii
cil of People’s Commissars of the Azerbaidjan, S.S.R., in connec-
tion with the twentieth anniversary of Soviet Azerbaidjan, we read:

“In the twenty years which have gone by since the establish-
ment of Soviet power in Azerbaidjan, this former4Tsarist colony,
this country of outworn patriarchal and feudalrelationships,
this victim of ruthless exploitation by, the oil magnates and of , , 3 y

for outstanding achievement, at country of advanced technique.
and Socialist culture. . . . C

“The whole Union of Socialist Soviet Republics lives on the

black gold, the oil of Azerbaidjan.’ ’(From the greeting sent by“ ‘ ‘ 1

Comrades Stalin and Molotov to the workers of Azerbaidjan
on the ﬁfteenth anniversary of the republic.) 1‘

The production of crude and reﬁned oil is on the increase year ,

by year and is now more than three times what it was in 1931. e

;_ What has taken place in Azerbaidjan is a genuine cultural revolu- . 911
tion. Science, art, and literature have become the undisputed , g;,;f.

heritage of the people, and splendid cadres of a new Soviet
intelligentsia of engineers, doctors, scientists; artists, composers,

 writers, painters, etc., have been developed. . . . The elementary,
_and secondary schools of Azerbaidjan were attended in the present a

school year by 675-7 thousand "children as compared with 73-6 A
* thousand in 1913-14. Further, 12-5 thousand youths and girls are
studying in fourteen universities and technical colleges. There were “

u and interventionist troops. This people, ‘oppressed and mercilessly
exploited in the past by landowners, capitalists, traders, noyons, ,

lamas, and shamans, a people doomed by Tsarism to starvation and
extermination, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party has

created .,a free Socialist Republic for itself. From. a semi—savage, A
backward Tsarist colony, from a land of nomad tribes, Buryat- ‘
Mongolia has been transformed under Soviet power into a ﬂourish- _

ing industrial-agrarian Socialist Republic.

Again, take the Mari people. Here in the days of Tsarism there
were only handicrafts or enterprises based on handicraft methods
in existence. Now the Maris have many large factories equipped
with the latest machines. They have large Socialist collective farms‘

and vast herds of cattle; a Socialist culture is shooting up and the

Maripeople are becoming prosperous as never before.
As an illustration of the_ growth of culture among the national
minorities of the U.S:S.R., we quote one example :

“At the Extraordinary’ Eleventh Congress of Soviets of the

Chuvash Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, these ﬁgures’ n

Another example is provided by the~peoples of the Tatar

.Au,tonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. Under the Soviet Govern-

ment this republic has built up a modern industry which in 1939‘

alone produced goods to the value of 1,125,000,000 roubles. Inf

the Tatar Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic an advanced

Socialist agriculture has also made great strides. In the ﬁelds of

this Autonomous Socialist ‘Soviet’ Republic we. .ﬁnd over 6000
tractors and 3000 harvester-combines. In the technical colleges,

 , workers’ faculties, and universities ‘of the republic there are over

25,000 young students of both sexes. -
The other peoples of the U.S.S.R. are living, working, and

.' : ~ developing in the same way. What the most progressive men and

women of other countries only dreamt of has become a reality

there. The national policy of Lenin and Stalin, which the working

masses of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. strove for, has now been put
into practice. In this achievement the Bolshevik Party played at very

considerable part. For this Party fought, and is still ﬁghting, against ~
all and every kind of national discrimination, against all distortions

of and deviations from the national policy of the Bolshevik Party.
I'he Bolshevik Party fought, and is still ﬁghting, against'Great-
Russian and every other local nationalism. It carried ona struggle
against the bourgeois nationalists who attempted to turn back, the

peoples of, the U.S.S.R. on to the old road of national isolat_ionism.,~

national discord, and hostility. V V

In a letter to the workers and peasants of the Ukraine, on the
occasion of the victory over Denikin, Lenin wrote in December,
1919: . V .

“What we want is a voluntary union of nations; a union.

which would admit of no violation of any nation by any other—
. a union founded on the most complete conﬁdence, on the clear
consciousness of brotherly unity, on a fully voluntary mutual
I agreement. Such a union-cannot be achieved all at once‘; it
can only be the result of very patient and cautious work, so as
not to spoil everything, so as not to rouse suspicions but rather
cause the suspicions to die down which were left behind by
centuries of oppression by landlords and capitalists and private

property and by the enmities‘ and divisions it brings in its train.” 0

Such a voluntary union of nations was created in the U.S.S.R.

during the twenty-ﬁve years of the Soviet Power. ’All'\diﬂiculti'es
and obstacles were overcome. Comrade Stalin, who has done so .
much to create this union and to strengthen the ties of friendship"
betweengthe. peoples of the U.S.S.R., always regarded this as a A

matter of the greatest importance}

 

. 1 ‘
T he Struggle for Soviet Power and the Signiﬁcance of
the Great Socialist Revolution of October

 November 7th (October 25th old style) of the‘§yearI'l9l7,_ a ‘

manifesto written by V. I. Lenin and addressed “to the citizensfof
Russia”, was issued in Petrograd. On that day theiwholeworld
was staggered by a piece of momentous news. Power in Russia had
passed into the hands of the workers and peasants, represented by
Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.  The

manifesto stated: . »

“The Provisional Government has been overthrown? State

Power has‘ passed into the hands of the organ of the Petrograd ,

Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and more especially
into that‘ of the Military Revolutionary Committee, which IS
leading the Petrograd proletariat and garrison. The cause for
-which the people fought-—the immediate oﬁ‘er of a democratic
. peace; the abolition of the ownership of the land by land-
.owners, the establishment of workers’ control in industry, and
the creation of a Soviet Government—has been victorious/._ Long
live the Revolution of workers, soldiers, and peasants."

While shots were still cracking in the streets of Petrograd, while
the struggle against the defenders of the Provisional Government,
that enemy of the people, was still in progress, Lenin was already
speaking on the task of Soviet power at a meeting of the Petrograd
Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. In the Smolny the
deputies met their beloved Ilyitch with stormy applause and trium-
phant cheers.

.. Lenin said:

“Comrades, the revolution of workers and peasants, the
need for which the Bolsheviks have always proclaimed, has now
been accomplished. What is the signiﬁcance of this Workers’

- and Peasants’ Revolution? First and foremost its signiﬁcance
is that we shall. now have a Soviet Government, i.e. our own
machinery of government without any participation ‘whatsoever
of the bourgeoisie. The oppressed masses will create their

1- own government. The old state machinery will be radically
destroyed, and a new machinery of government created in the

form of Soviet organizations. A new epoch in the history of _
Russia is now beginning, and the present third Russian Revo—'

lution must eventually lead to the victory of Socialism.”

On the very ﬁrst day of the victorious revolution Lenin set the:

whole country a gigantic task 2 “We must immediately begin to build
up a proletarian Socialist state in Russia.” v .
A Soviet of Workers’ Deputies had already been created during

the ﬁrst Russian revolution of 1905 on the eve of the armed insur-

rection of December; Soviets of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies

 

    
  

   

‘When in December 1935‘ Comrade Stalin received leading 
collective farmers from Tadjikistan and Turkmenia as his guests '
in the Kremlin he told them that the now existing friendship

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 

between the peoples of the U.S.S.R. was a great and serious achieve- ’ S -1 
ment. “For as long as this friendship endures, the peoples of our .  C:

‘ country will be free and invincible. While this friendship is alive ’ ‘ 8
and ﬂourishes, we need fear no one, no foreign enemies and no L 9  T4

, enemies at home. Of this you can be certain, comrades.” 7 g 6
The great patriotic war of the Soviet people against Hitler" Y  G
Germany has revealed all the greatness and all the strength of this  9f_

A friendship. When they attacked our country, the vile Hitlerites
ﬂattered themselves that theywould be able to shatter our unity, SC
', sow discord between the various nations, and rouse the peoples of at
the U.S.S.R. against the Government and the Bolshevik Party. It
But the war has shown that there is no power on earth strong - C<
enough to weaken, much less destroy, this unity of our peoples.  K
The Germans thought that “after the ﬁrst serious blow and the ' 0'
ﬁrstdefeats of the Red Army conﬁicts would arise between workers If
and peasants, quarrels would break out between the peoples h
of the U.S.S.R., there would be armed risings and the country would 1 L
dissolve into its composite parts, thus facilitating the advance of al
the German invaders. right across Russia to the Urals. But here
again the Germans were cruelly mistaken. The defeats 5f the Red
Armypnot only did not weaken but greatly strengthened the alliance
1 of the workers and peasants and the friendship of all peoples of the
U.S.S.R. More than that——the war turned this commonwealth of
nations into a united impregnable fortiﬁed camp counting no
sacriﬁce too great in support of their own Red Army and Red 1 ,
Navy. Never has the Soviet rear.been more stable than now. It 1. ; .. t
is quite probable that any other state which had suffered such
losses of territory as we are suffering now would not have been
4 equal to such a trial and would have given way. The fact that the :
Soviet Union so easily supported these trials and could make its ‘
rear stronger than ever, means that the Sovietsystem is now the
most stable system in the world.” (Stalin on the great patriotic
war of the U.S.S.R.) .  ' 1
This is why workers of all nations are ‘ﬁghting with such relf-
sacriﬁcing devotion in this war against Hitlerite Germany. What is . 9
at stake is the freedom and independence, the life and honour, of
all nations inhabiting the U.S.S.R. This is why among the heroes .4
of the Soviet Union we ﬁnd commanders, men and political workers 1
of many nationalities, and the same applies to those decorated for
gallantry in the struggle against the German invaders. ‘

v. The Soviet Union is a Country of Advanced Socialist Culture _

IN order to understand andproperly appreciate the tremendous
"development of culture in the U.S.S.R. we must remember the
V, heritage left by Tsarism to all the nations -of the Soviet Union. It
‘cannot be said that this heritage was poor or small. No, even 3
 T.-F._Y,.O.S.P. ‘ 49 7 ,1 c 4

 
 

Tsarist' Russia had produced’ great scientists, writers,’ painter 

actors. -Long ago one of the founders of scientiﬁc ‘research in
Russia, M. V. Lomonossov, wrote that Russia would "one. day, be

i ' an advanced country; that Russia would show that she can “bear

her own Platos and nimble-witted Newtons”.

One part of this legacy was a rich literature, and the names°of '
" Russian writers such as Ryleyev, Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol,

Nekrassov, Tolstoy, Turgenyev, Chekhov, Gorki,» and many others
form an integral part of the treasury of world literature. The

works of such thinkers, publicists, and historians as Byelinski,

Herzen, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevski, and others gave the Soviet
land models of clear critical thought, of great historical generaliza-:

tions, of passionate journalism which served to educate whole

generations of progressive intellectuals in Russia. The names of
great scientists such as Mendelev, Metchnikov, Sechenov, Pavlov,
Karpinski, and many others grace the pages of the history of
scientiﬁc thought. Russia was famed also for her actors, singers,
painters, composers. Names like those of Repin, Chaikovski,
Rimski-Korsakov, Glinka, Borodin are equally well known in all

.. countries of the earth, and their immortal works are the patrimon
—of the entire human race. » '

Until the revolution of October 1917, however, this rich legacy

was the privilege of a tiny minority. The vast majority of the

population—especially of the non-Russian population——was

illiterate. Poverty-stricken, lacking political rights, tens of millions '

of peasants and workers had no opportunity whatever of enjoying
these great treasures of science and art. Especially illiterate and poor

. in schools, and other cultural institutions were the outlying idistrictsi
— inhabited by non-Russian nationalities. More than forty nationalities

were completely illiterate and did not even possess an alphabet, of

their own. In 1914, the ﬁrst year of the ﬁrst world war, the number

of all persons attending schools of all grades in Tsarist Russia

was 8,137,000. 4- In order to show the tremendous advance made:

since then, wequote only one ﬁgure: in the scholastic year 1936-37

the total of all those attending school was 38,335,000, i.e. more '_
than four times as many. The number- of educational institutions

increased in the U.S.S.R. to 7-7 times the- number of schools
existing in 1914. In 1914 there were in Russia 91 higher educational
institutions; in 1936 this number had risen to 700 in the U.S.S.R.

It must also be noted that in 1914 there were only 16 colleges
in existence for the training of industrial, building, and transport 9
» technicians; by 1936 this number had increased to 160', Le; to ten

times as many. The number of agricultural colleges has also

‘increased ten times, from 9 to 90 during the sameperiod. Since

1936 this growth has continued without interruption.
And what is especially important is that the Socialist October

revolution on the one hand enabled all peoples to take possession r

of that great cultural heritage which had been accumulated in the
past and, on the other hand, enabled them to develop the national
culture of each people, to obtain schools, newspapers, books. '

2 their own language,’ to have a national theatre, national universities,
‘museums, academies of their own. The right to education is

anchored in the 121st Article of the Constitution of the U.S._S.R.
Is this not a tremendous victory of the Socialist I'6VOl11lL10I‘1 of

October ? ~ ' c - _ 
Nor was it altogether an easy matter to introduce compulsory

universal education and to .turn it into a reality in the short period

it 1 of only twenty-ﬁve years. Whoever did not observe with attention

how energetically and persistently the Soviet Government fulﬁlled

1 this task can never understand how great were the difficulties
which had to be overcome. It was not merely a matter of the . »,

quantitative permeation of enormous numbers of people. A radical
change had to be made in the whole content of school education.
An enormous number of teachers had to be trained and a staff
of lecturers created. In 1914-15 there were only 1953 secondary
schools in the whole of Russia, staﬁ_“ed by 42,803 secondary school
teachers and attended by only 635,591 children. In September 1939
there were already 15,810 secondary schools staﬂ‘ed by 377,337
teachers and attended by 10,834,612 schoolchildren.

. The‘ Eighteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U. (B) proposed that
the third Five-Year Plan should extend to rural districts and all

national republics the universal se‘ven-year secondary education I A
scheme and also to extend the scope of the ten-year education »
scheme and to operate a universal secondary education scheme In"

. urban areas. Comrade Stalin said at this congress that the period

under review was a period of genuine revolution from the point of.
View of the cultural development of our people.

Such a cultural revolution was an indispensable condition of the
creation of a Socialist society. Lenin said that we were not cultured
enough to build Socialism. At the same time he poked fun at the
petty-bourgeois critics of the Soviet Government, at the Mensheviks

. and Socialist revolutionaries who thought that nothing would

come of the Bolshevik experiment because, they said, the common

A . people were culturally unprepared to build Socialism. Lenin said .

that we had proceeded correctly in ﬁrst conquering the preliminary
conditions required for the cultural development of the masses.
He proved to be right. A great cultural revolution has been
achieved in the U.S.S.R. under the leadership of Comrade Stalin.
No one has done more towards the creation of cadres than he.
There was a time when all our attention was directed towards the

«technical re-equipment of the country, towards the creation of the 

technical basis which was to serve as a foundation for the Socialist

transformation of our entire national economy. But when this

«technical transformation was completed, Comrade Stalin pointed

~ outthat now that we had acquired the requisite advanced technical 5
“facilities, the success of all further progress will be decided by the

; availability of cadres. I , ,

. Progress in this sphere is shown by a comparison oi ﬁgures;

o .

~"In,1914 Russiahad in all 91 universities, colleges, and other schools

f asgrade higher than secondary, in which 112,000 students were

being trained. These were mainly concentrated in Petrograd  

"and in Moscow (20). At present all republics of the Union have

their own higher schools and a large number of engineers,

L agricultural consultants, technicians, etc., have been trained andpthe -

problem of training labour reserves among the young people has
been tackled and solved.

The Soviet Government assigns funds for raising the cultural ,

level of the population with no miserly hand.

On October 1st, 1939, there were 86,266 publicﬂlibraries  the 3
U.S.S.R. with ‘a total of more than 166 million books. The growth

of the book stocks in the U.S.S.R. and the tremendous interest

 taken in books by the workers of the‘ U’.S.S.R. is shown by the '__

development of the two largest libraries in the U.S.S.R., the State

Library named after V. I. Lenin and the Public Library named 1

after Saltykov-Shchedrin in Leningrad.

As for clubs, there were a few dozen of them in all in Tsarist *
.  Russia, but in 1939 there were over 111,000 various clubs in the 1
i V U.S.S.R., among them over 39,000 Village library-clubs. 
Museums of all kinds have been greatly developed in the
. U.S.S.R. In 1939 therekwere about 800 museums, of which 78

were art museums, 52_ historical museums, 49 museums devoted to"
the history of the revolution, 44 museums of natural history,.55
specialized museums, and 399 museums of local interest. ’

, The whole network of pre-scholastic education, comprising »y

nursery schools, kindergartens, playgrounds, etc., was not developed

- 6 at all until the October revolution, and before 1917 there were none ‘

of these facilities available for the working population.

In 1940 alone, the amount assigned for purposes of public - ’

education was 23 milliard ‘roubles. Thisﬁgure speaks for itself.

“Science for the workers!” This slogan has become the watch- if 
word of science in the U.S.S.R. during the last twenty-ﬁve years.
Lenin and Stalin taught us that it‘ was impossible to build a new  1

Socialist, Communist culture without making use of the rich

heritage of our past. It is not possible to build the new culture of  ’

the classless Socialist society while regarding with contempt the

history of our people and the treasures of science, art, and technique‘ , 

I
\

accumulated before our -time. The task of the revolution consisted _

». l 

 
   
   
   
    
 
   
 
   
   
   
  
  

precisely in multiplying these accumulated riches and in developing,

would break up the old traditions, standards, and conditions_as soon
. as they became obstacles to further progress, and the creation of a

- new science, the moving spirits of which are not individual scientific
:~ luminaries but the millions of workers who are now able to partici-
pate in the building of a new way of life.

Socialist economy is, above all, planned economy, and a planned
economy is impossible without exact science. This is why science
' has been given such wide scope in the U.S.S.R. _

‘ The ﬁrst among the scientiﬁc institutions of the U.S.S.R. is

Commissars of the U.S.S.R. and the Central Committee of the
C.P.S.U. (B) passed the following resolution :

“In View of the inexpediency of the parallel existence _of

_ two Academies, the Academy of Sciences and the Communist

; Academy, and with the object of uniting all scientiﬁc workers

in one state-controlled scientiﬁc centre, it is considered opportune

to wind up the Communist Academy and transfer its establish-

ments, institutions, and stalf to the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R.” .

In’ 1939 the Academy of Sciences had 60 scientiﬁc institutes,

. 10 branches and bases, 5 observatories, 42 research stations, and
24 museums. _

j: V The Ukraine and Byelorussia developed their own Academies,

5"  L and an All-Union Academy of Agricultural Science named after

 and the Central Asiatic Republics.

institutes in the U.S.S.R., among them 416 agricultural and other
 scientiﬁc research stations, 34 observatories, and 66 scientiﬁc
i l institutes for the protection of natural resources. If one takes
. into account the research laboratories attached to industrial

 

:  g»  S enterprises, and other research bodies of a similar character, the total

number of research units in the U.S.S.R. would be about 2265. a
J. ‘The budget of the Academy of Sciences alone for 1939 was

158 million roubles, and the expenditure on education-of all grades
and other cultural purposes amounted to 42,875 million roubles in
A-1940. Such ﬁgures speak for themselves. .

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

something that was given us by the Socialist October revolution:
scientiﬁc work is no longer limited to the higher educational
institutions but is also carried on in factory and collective farm
laboratories. I - . .

Only after the October revolution were women given the widest

 country. More than 12,000 women in the U.S.S.R. are engaged in

 

‘ on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, a new progressive science which

' Lenin was also set up. In 1941 the Georgian S.S.R. inaugurated its V
own Academy of Science with branches in Azerbaidjan, Armenia,

I ’ In addition to all this, there are over 700 scientiﬁc ‘research I ..

In all this there is something new that should be stressed,,_

 

possible opportunities to participate in the scientiﬁc activities‘ of the 6

  
  

scientiﬁc research. On January 1st, 1939, women constituted 32-2 >

per cent of all scientiﬁc workers under the Academy of Science,

31-5 per cent of all scientiﬁc workers in the research institutions .

attached to industry, 30-8 per cent in agriculture, 33-1 per cent in

education and the arts, and 48-5 per cent in the scientiﬁc institutions *

concerned with health questions. _ .
State scholarships and Stalin Prizes for outstanding achieve-

ments in the ﬁeld f science, technics, literature, and art have played ‘
a very considera le part in the development of culture in the V

U.S.S.R. _ .
The great patriotic war of the Soviet people against Hitler
Germany has shown the tremendous importance of science for

‘defence. The work of all scientiﬁc institutions, from the Academy

of Sciences downwards, was transformed to serve the immediate
needs of the front line and to give the Red Army everything it
needed to defeat Hitlerite Germany-—éthat worst enemy of the culture
and liberty of the human race.

During this war the Academy of Sciences,’ with its president, ,
V. L. Komarov, its members, Bach, Lysenko, Baikov, Fersman, and".
other prominent scientists, has been working with great success to.‘
ﬁnd new sources of raw material, such as new ore and oil deposits,

to increase crop yields, and to improve metallurgical production
and means of transport. Marching in step with the scientists we

I ﬁnd an army of Stakhanovites, constructors, and inventors. The ‘ if

result has been an increase in the defence resources of the country
and the creation of new kinds of armaments. There can be no

doubt that this enormous growth of the scientiﬁc forces of the 

country will take even greater effect later when the entire energy

of the nation will be directed towards the reconstruction of the
economic resources destroyed by the war and towards the raising"
; of the living standards of all the peoples of the U.S.S.R.

In twenty-ﬁve years we have created all the conditions required-
for a further gigantic growth of culture, science, and the arts in the I

U.S.S.R. This cultural development is especially conspicuous in

the growth of the Press. Even before the October revolution the »

Bolshevik Press played a very important part in the political

The interest taken by the peoples of the U.S.S.R. in literature
is not limited to Russian or Soviet writers. The works of foreign
authors of every country have come into the sphere of interest of
the workers of the U.S.S.R.‘ The ﬁrst table on p. 58 will show the
extent of this interest. 2

also~came.~into being in some places, and in some towns there were
‘Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies. In .those days these soviets were
organizations emerging from the very depths of the popular masses.
They assisted in the preparation of the armed insurrection and in

some towns, as in Moscow, they even led the armed rising. In the’
' course of the struggle they began to some extent and in some places

to develop into a rudimentary organ of revolutionary government.
But in 1905, the Russian working class, which led the revo-

lutionary masses, was not strong enough to overthrow the Tsarist

Government which was stiﬂing the people withrits disorganization

and its reactionary policy. Though shaken by the revolution.

of 1905, Tsarism was not defeated and not overthrown. Twelve

long years were required to prepare the masses for a new armed I
insurrection. During these twelve years Russia experienced years '
of reaction and of the decline of the revolution, but also years of a .

new revolutionary upsurge, and three years of the ﬁrst imperialist
world war. This war shook Tsarist Russia to its foundations, and
showed up the complete unpreparedness of Tsarism for war and its
complete incapacity to wage it. It speeded up tremendously the
‘growth of revolutionary feeling in the masses and the growth of

revolutionary forces. In February 1917, the united effort of the
workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers and sailors overthrew

Tsarism. Immediately Soviets of Workers’ and" Soldiers’ Deputies
came into being throughout Russia, and Soviets of Peasants’
Deputies were beginning to be formed in rural areas. The experi-
ences of the revolution of 1905 now helped the formation of soviets‘
——it had been, to quote a term coined by Lenin, a general rehearsal

for the revolution of 1917. V
The fall of Tsarism shook the whole country and the whole

.world. Millions of people, quite inexperienced in assessing

ﬁolitical programmes, began to take part in the political life of
ussza.

Wily schemers representing the interests of the landowners
and capitalists and their toadies, the Constitutional Democrats,
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were all afraid to carry
the revolution to its end. They wanted to save the power of the
landowners and capitalists or——as in the case of the Constitutional
Democrats—they even wanted to save the monarchy. They
succeeded in disuniting the masses and creating a provisional
bourgeois Government which functioned side by side with the newly

formed Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. A dual 

government came into being. a ,

The spring, summer and autumn of 1917 passed in the struggle
to get rid of this dual Government, to establish a paramount
Soviet Government and to oust all the bourgeoisie from power for
good. For eight months the revolution gathered its forces. For eight
months the masses carried on a desperate struggle for the power of
the Soviets. Leading the masses in this struggle for Soviet power
stood the party ‘of the Bolsheviks, the party of Lenin and Stalin,
well tried in long years of struggle. Lenin and Stalin were able to

In the twenty-ﬁve years of its existence the Soviet Government

I has established a vast network of health institutions. Solicitude for
. the health of the population is one of the foremost concerns of the

Soviet Government. Lenin and Stalin taught us to care for the
welfare of our citizens. An intricate system of preventive and
curative institutions, of maternity and child welfare clinics, are
endowed by the Soviet Government with huge assignments of funds.
The Stalin Constitution lays down the right of every working citizen
of the U.S.S.R. to security in old age, sickness and invalidity.
Numerous sanatoria, hospitals, maternity clinics, dispensaries,

-clinics and polyclinics, and factory medical and health services are

playing their part in preserving the health of the population. As
a result of these efforts general mortality ﬁgures have decreased by
55 per cent against comparable ﬁgures relating to Tsarist Russia,
and infant mortality has also fallen to less than half. ‘ '
In the sphere of social insurance development has also been

‘ rapid. During thesecond Five Year Plan (1933-1937) the sum of

26,462,000,000, i.e. more than 26 milliard roubles, was spent for
such purposes. Of this sum, 9 milliards were paid out in the form
of grants and pensions; for maternity benefits, 783 million roubles;
for rest homes, sanatoria, and health resorts, 1317 millions; ‘for

, medical services for insured persons, 6101 millions; for services
for the children of insured persons, 1845 millions; for housin gand

service buildings, 3056 million roubles.
All this was achieved for the workers by the. great Socialist

, October revolution. Theworkers of the U.S.S.R. have something

to defend». In twenty-ﬁve years conditions have been created which
ensure the“cultural development of the masses and the growth of "a
literate, cultured, healthy generation of citizens of the Socialist

state, citizens who are building a new Socialist society.

The war has shown the great importance of all this.

Well-educated and cultured Red Army men master the methods
of mechanized warfare with ease. Intelligent and politically
enlightened Red Army men easily understand the great liberating

aims of this war. As a result of the solicitude of the Soviet Govem-
S ment for the health of the people we have not had in this war any of

the epidemics which killed so many Soviet citizens during the civil

id war when the country was still poor and had not yet had time to »

create the conditions necessary for the safeguarding of the health

I of the people. Because we have brought up a healthy and strong
.’ generation, and because the medical services in our army are better

than in the army of the enemy, the mortality from wounds is much

. Smaller in the Red Army than in the German Army. The proportion
.. , . 59 _ .

of those members of our armed forces who return to the ranks
after wounds or sickness to ﬁght again is considerably higher than
in the enemy armies. 

, w ' Such are the beneﬁcial results of the rise in the cultural level of
the U.S.S.R. in the past twenty-ﬁve years.

Women inithe U.S.S.R. have become a powerful force

RUSSIAN women took an active part inlthe revolutionary struggle  

in Tsarist Russia, both before the appearance of the workers’

Party and especially afterits creation. Before the birth of’ the .

Workers’ Party it was almost exclusively the progressive intelli-
gentsia who participated in the revolutionary movement; but with
the_development of the working-class movement and the appearance’
of the Workers’ Party we see working-class women join the ranks of
their brothers in the revolutionary struggle. We see them on the

barricades in the defence of the Obukhov Works, in demonstrations ‘
. and strikes, and in the revolution of 1905. In the revolution of

February 1917 the women of Russia played an important part in
persuading the soldiers and sailors of the Tsar’s ‘armed forces to
side with the" people.

The Socialist October revolution completely ‘emancipated .

women. In an article on “International Women’s Day” printed on
March 8th, 1921, Lenin pointed out that “an essential, fundamental
trait of Bolshevism and ofthe October revolution was that they drew

V into political activity the very people who were oppressed to the A

greatest extent under capitalism. . . . The essence of Bolshevism,
the essence of Soviet power, lies in the exposure of the lie and
hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy, in the abolition of the private
ownership of land, and of the factories. and plants and in the
concentration of all political power in the hands of the exploited

. ‘working masses. These masses themselves take politics, i.e. the ..
‘building of a new society, into their own hands. . . . But it is

impossible to draw the masses. into politics without drawing in the

.women. For the feminine half of the human race is doubly
oppressed under capitalism. . . . The Bolshevik Soviet revolution A

cuts so deeply into the roots of the oppression and inequality of

’ women as no other party and no other revolution has ever dared to

cut before.” , . *
V The Soviet Government immediately cancelled all laws establish-
ing the inequality of women. Before the revolution women were]

;_regarded as inferior ‘beings. Many humiliating proverbs were-

in use, such as: “A hen is not a bird, a woman is not a“ human I.
being”. The inequality of womeniunder Tsarism was laid down not . ,

only by law but by the teachings of religion as well, which taught

that women were “the vessels of the evil one”. The great Socialist? , if

  

, factory and local trade union organizations.

   

October revolution swept away the laws and old traditions on which

the inequality _of women’s rights were based. The Soviet Con-‘; 

stitution embodies many great conquests of the Soviet people, an
one of these achievements is the complete equality of women’s
rights. The Stalin. Constitution states: “Women in the-U.S.S.R.
enjoy the same rights as men in all spheres of economic, cultural,
political and social life.” A
These rights of women are implemented by equal pay and equal
opportunities, equal rights in respect of holidays, social insurance,
education, public maternity and" infant welfare, by leave with pay

” for pregnant women, and by a widespread network of maternity

homes, nurseries, and kindergartens. _
In many/European countries (Italy, France, Bulgaria, Rumania)

women have no political rights. The same applies to many Latin- _ ,0

American countries, Japan, and a numberof other states. In others
the rights of women are very limited. In the U.S.S.R. there are

“no limits or obstacles to the participation of women in social,
political, scientiﬁc, economic, and administrative activities of all

kinds. , -
The October revolution demonstrated for the ﬁrst time what

a force is represented by women in all spheres of public life. In I

no other country are there so many women among the representa-

Moreover, for the ﬁrst time in history women were able to govern

not as queens or empresses, but as representatives of the people.
In». the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. there are 189 women _
I deputies, in the Supreme Soviets- of the federal and autonomous

— republics 1436 women ‘deputies, and in the local soviets 422,279

women have been elected as representatives of the workers. The

; tremendous signiﬁcance of this was shown in the great patriotic

war, when women rendered honourable service in the factories and.
works, in the collective farms and state estates, in the medical
services, and in combatant units of the Red Army. .
The working women of the U.S.S.R. occupy anhonourable
place in all social organizations of the country, in the trade unions,
in the party, in the Yoimg Communist League. There‘-are more
than 9,000,000 women organized in -- the trade unions, and

‘ according to incomplete data 428,570 of them hold elected ofﬁce in

various bodies and committees of the central, federal, regional, area,
The proportion of

women in the Bolshevik Party is about 29‘per cent.

During the period of the Stalinist Five-Year Plans there was a 7'

» tremendous increase in the-number of women manual and clerical
4 workers employed in the national economy of the 1}

.S.S.R.‘ In
1932» about 6,000,000 women were working in all spheres of our

‘national economy, i.e. about 27-4 per cent. At the beginning of

the third Stalin Five-Year Plan this number had increased to

‘, 9,357,000, i.e.\to 35-4 per cent, and in 1939 to 10,773,000, i.e. 37-4

A“ research. In leading positions in ‘Government and Party work~we _
;ﬁnd over 20 per cent women.

Among the women we see Comrade Grekova, President of the ’
Supreme Soviet of the Byelorrussian Socialist Soviet Republic-;_
we see A. M. Kollontai, woman diplomat; we see women people’s
commissars, women directors and managers of works, factories, '
and other enterprises, woman academicians and heads of

, universities. Such woman air aces as Grizodubova, Osipenko, and

~ Raskova are well known, and we have whole squadrons of women
aviators who ﬂy in defence of our Socialist country. We have
women in the civil defence, in the signal corps, in the medical f 
services of the Red Army. We see women like Zenaida Troyitskaya’ 0
driving railway engines and managing railways. By 1940,. 23,000

. women had completed their training in various branches of rail- .
way transport. Forty-four women worked as" engine-drivers and 
4500 women as ﬁremen. . , . -

The great patriotic war evoked a tremendous surge of patriotic .

. T feeling among the women’. Women young and old went intothe ’ -
» factories, they stood at the work-benches, took over our agriculture. _
They joined the ranks of the Red Army. They went into the 0

guerilla detachments, and everywhere they showed a high degree
of responsibility, set an example of discipline. Their heroic, stub-" ~;1
born Stakhanovite labour and their courage and resolution were a
model to all, Girls such as ‘Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Lisa
Chaykina, and many others covered the name of Soviet women with
glory in this our patriotic war. , 
What is especially important is the participation in the social, i
. political, and economic life of the country, both in responsible ‘
‘ positions and in the rank and ﬁle, of a very large number of women‘
of the eastern regions of our country, who, under Tsarism, were the
most oppressed and who possessed the least rights. The Socialist
revolution of October emancipated these women and opened up y
a wide perspective in front of them. To name only a few, we ,
mention a Stakhanovite worker of Azerbaidjan, Basti-Masi-Kyzy 
Bagirova;-the famous collective farmer of Georgia, Nato Saga-i ”
dashvili ; and Yugaber Karapetovna Avetisyan, a prominent worker; _.
in Armenia. In Turkmenistan we have Ogus-Murad-Seid Kuliyeva ; i
and among the Tadjik people, Faizi—Bibi Kayoumova. In the
Kirghiz country the Vice-President of the Supreme Soviet is as
woman, Kalima Amankulova; another woman, Valentina Sem- , -
yonovna Khetagurova, was the initiator of a great movement to?
transfer thousands of girls for work in the Far East. We might name ‘
dozens of prominent women singers, actresses, and dancers of the
U.S.S.R., many of whom had won decorations and Stalin Prizes.  l
' we might name hundreds of prominent collective farmers, of chair-_l
women of village soviets, of women tractor-drivers such as
. j Praskovia Nikitichna Angelina and Praskovia Ivanovna Kovardak W
A — Collective farming in the Soviet Union has given the peasant»
woman very great advantages. It has given her practical equality
‘ — of status in the family and in society. v It has emancipated women
- _, . l - 62 , p , * .

., and giveil. them the opportunity of participating in social life to I

3 the widest-‘possible extent. On November 10th, 1935, Comrade

"=St"alin said in a speech to ‘woman shock-workers on collective? 

» farms growing sugar-beet: “We have just heard some speeches of

quite remarkable women. I would say, of women who are heroines
of labour, because only heroines of labour could have achieved the

successes which they have achieved. In the old times we had no

such women. I am 56 years old and have seen plenty of things in

o my time. I have seen plenty of working men and women, but never
did I meet such women. These are quite new people. Only
emancipated labour, only collective farming, could produce such
» heroines of labour in the villages.” ‘I

~ A couple, of years earlier, on February 19th, 1933, at the First

‘ All-Union Congress of Shock-Worker Collective Farmers, Comrade C

Stalin pointed out the tremendous signiﬁcance of the changes which
have occurred as a result of collective farming in the rural areas.

“The point is not only that women comprise half the
population. Primarily, the point is that the collective farm
movement has advanced a number of remarkable and capable

‘women to leading positions. Look at this congress, at the».

delegates, and you will realize that women have long since
. advanced from the ranks of the backward to the ranks of the

forward. The women in the collective farms are a great force. '

To keep this force down would_ be criminal. It is our duty to
bring the women in the collective farms forward and to make
I useof this great force.”

The Soviet Government, the Bolshevik Party, and especially

f Comrade Stalin himself, spared no effort in providing oppor-

tunities for women to develop their abilities in every direction and

I ~_ito7lighten the burden of their labour. The war interrupted work

undertaken on a wide scale for the improvement of the social and
l-ivingconditions of the whole population of the U.S.S.R., and
especially of the women and children. The German Fascist brutes
have done to death hundreds of thousands of Soviet women ;
manyof them haye been driven away into Fascist slavery, others
dishonoured and sullied. But Soviet women are ﬁghting back,

b_ both at the front. and in the rear of the enemy. They have shown

irrepressible energy, steadfast courage, and the readiness to make

the greatest sacriﬁces in order to defend our country and destroy
_, the Hitlerite blackguards. In some factories 70 to 80 per cent of

newly engaged workers are women. Even before the war female

labour was more common in production in the U.S.S.R. than in
. other countries, and during this war the proportion of women in

 ‘The Great Patriotic War of ‘the Soviet People Against Hitlerite
Germany as a General Test of the Achievements of the October
Socialist Revolution

IN his report on peace on November 8th, 1917, the day after the
revolution, Lenin said that the question of peace is a burning
question of our time. Lenin then proceeded to expound the

, addressed by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government set up by the
Socialist October revolution and based on the Soviets of Workers’,

“In addressing to the governments and peoples of all coun-
tries the proposal to begin immediate, open negotiations for the
conclusion of peace, the Government on its part expresses
its readiness to conduct such negotiations either by corres-

t of such representatives.”

- and its readiness to conclude peace, ‘the Soviet republic had to

seen how this war against the forces of intervention ended, how they a if

r - By its heroic struggle and tenacity the Red Army secured a .  V

   

 breathing-space of peace.‘ a Nevertheless, the" wen

a years that have passed since the end of the civil war and theiwa

of intervention the enemies of the Soviet Union have repeatedly

/ . threatened our country with war. The imperialists have repeated
threatened a crusade against the Soviet land, and there were eve V
provocative attempts to draw the U.S.S.R. into a war. Attempts’.
 . were made to invade the Soviet Union from the west and from the’
east, but every time. the Soviet state found suﬂicient strength within

itself to cope with these attacks.

_ Thisis how Comrade Stalin deﬁned the foreign policy of e the
Soviet Government in this whole period: A

“Our foreign policy is clear. It is a policy of preserving’

peace and strengthening commercial relations with all countries.

The U.S.S.R. does not think of threatening anybody’—let alone

of attacking anybody. We stand for peace and champion-the
cause of peace. But we are not afraid of threats and are
prepared to answerthe instigators of war blow for blow. 
who want peace and seek business relations with us willialwaws

have our support. But those who try to attack our country .
will receive a crushing repulse to teach them not to poke their f

pig snouts into our Soviet garden.

“Such is our foreign policy.

“The task is to continue this policy persistently and con-
sistently.” ‘ — f .

' Meanwhilethe imperialists in Germany, Italy, and Japan were 1
hatching out the plans for a new division of the world. The new ,

imperialist war began with the invasion of Abyssinia ‘by Italy in

1935', with the German and Italian intervention in Spain in the“

summer of 1936, and the intervention of Japan in Northern and

Central China in 1937 after the seizure of Manchuria. This was »

followed by- a whole series of invasions on the part of th
aggressors mentioned——and the new imperialist world yvar became
a reality. , ’ . i » ’

A The Soviet Uniondid its utmost to prevent the war and preserve

the“ peace, but at the same time the Soviet state was compelle_djt‘o, .

protect the country from the possibility of a sudden attack.

/.

“in the midst of this eve-of-the-war hullabaloo which is
going on in a number of countries, the U.S.S.R. during these
years has stood ﬁrmly‘ and indomitably by its position of peace;
ﬁghting against the menace of war; ﬁghting to preserve peace ‘‘
meeting halfway those countries which for one reason or another

. stand for .the preservation of peace; exposing and tearing the

"masks from those who are preparing for and Iprovokin

.99

‘To the «..question,' “What  the U._S.S.K. rely on

_. . Speaking of this epre-war period, Comrade Stalin pointed out I
that A “ T

f "ﬂieu1t;and" complicated struggle for peace ?’I’ Cornrade 

plied: I.‘ '

“(a) On its growing economic and political might.
V V“(b) On the moral support of the vast masses of the working
class in every country, who are vitally interested in the preserva-
tion of peace. A '“

-‘f(c) On the prudence of those countries which for one
motive or another are not interested in disturbing the peace,
and which want to develop commercial relations with such a
punctual client as the U.S.S.R.
= “(d) Finally—on our glorious Army, which stands ready to
defend our country against attacks from without.” -

~ But despite the peaceful policy of the Soviet Government, despite
thefact that the Soviet Government threatened no one with war and
for the sake of peace even signed a pact with the German Government
in 1939—.the U.S.S.R. was unable to avoid war. On June 22nd,
1941, the watchdogs of the greediest imperialistsof the world, the
German Fascist Hitlerites, basely and faithlessly attacked the Soviet
republic. I .
_.One/ hundred and twenty-nine years after the attack of Napoleon
Bonaparte on Russia, one hundred and seventy German divisions,

long prepared and mobilized, armed to the teeth with the latest.

mechanized equipment, with tanks and aircraft, crossed the frontiers
‘of A the Soviet Union and advanced towards Moscow along the old
roads which Napoleon had trod before them.

; S "This was the second intervention of the German imperialists
since October 1917, directed against the ﬁrst Socialist state in the

world. In "his time Napoleon threw an army of a little more than .

half a million men against Russia. Hitler threw several million
»men against the U.S.S.R. if one includes the armies of his con-
emptible allies the Italians, Rumanians, Hungarians, Finns, and
thers. He threw against the U.S.S.R. the mechanized weapons
,-lieaped up in the years of his monstrous rule-—al1 his armoured
gtank divisions, his immense air force, his motorized infantry, his
S’ hole robber army corrupted by the infamous propaganda of
Fascism and convinced of its own invincibility. As a result of the
uddenness of the attack the Germans succeeded in occupying
onsiderable territory in the U.S.S.R. But in 1941 and 1942 the

.1 Germanslost several million soldiers and oﬂicers, a colossal number
of guns, and great quantities of ammunition without ‘achieving their
iobject. And what was most important in this war: the Fascist

Tmyth of the “invincibility” of the German Army was exploded for .

fever.

- T In 1941 the Germans occupied nearly all of the Ukraine, Byelo-

grussia, a part of the Karelo-Finnish»Republic, the approaches to S
‘ ningrad, the Baltic Coast, Moldavia, nearly the whole of the A 

Cfiinea‘, and the city of Rostov-on-Don. In November they

pccupiedpr the approaches to Moscow, Mozhaisk, -Volokolamsk,

y V Yaroslavets, Kaluga. ‘ They also attempted to surround

organize millions of workers, poor peasants, soldiers and sailors.
and at last to lead them on for the ﬁnal assault in October.

At that time the Bolsheviks, together with the just formed Young ‘

Communist Organization, numbered not more than half a million
members. And yet, in spite of the fact that all political parties in
Russia and the whole capitalist world were against the Bolshevik
Party, in spite of the fact that inside the Bolshevik Party itself there
existed opponents of a Socialist» revolution, “appeasers” who were
later shown up as enemies of the people——in spite of all this, the
third Russian revolution was victorious. The ﬁrst working class
to win victory and establish its dictatorship was the most oppressed
working class in the world and at the same time the most advanced
class of society. This meant that what had come into being here
was a genuine democracy, i.e. 9. government of the people——not in
words but in fact. The land, the factories, plants, mineral resources,
the banks, transport, all means and instruments of production
became the heritage of the working masses.

The great October Socialist revolution heralded a new epoch in
the history of the human race. It opened the doors to the realm of
Socialism. But this realm had still to be won by a bitter struggle.
A Socialist state and a Socialist society had to be built up. The
whole history of the human race knows no similar revolution. The
people which conquered in October 1917 found no example which it
could follow in the whole past history of mankind, which could teach’
it how to build up Socialism and how to build up a Socialist society.

In 1871 in France, a victorious people succeeded in setting up
the power of the Paris Commune—but only for a few weeks. The
glorious Commune of Paris fell under the blows of counter-revolu-
tion, and its short-lived experiences were insufficient to provide
directives for the building-up of a Socialist society. ' ~

But so great was the creative energy of the popular masses

I awakened to life by the Socialist October revolution, and such was

the genius of Lenin and Stalin, the leaders of the peoples’ struggle,
that the seemingly impossible became reality. '

There were many prophecies about the inevitable failure of
Soviet power. Some predicted that Soviet power would collapse in
a -few days. Others wrote that Soviet power might survive a few
weeks. Others again conceded that Soviet power might remain in

' existence a year or two. But, among all the opponents of Soviet

/

power, not one supposed for a moment that the Soviet state would
overcome all the difficulties besetting the ﬁrst great attempt to build.
a Socialist society. A
T None’ of the opponents of Soviet power under Socialism‘ sup-
posed-. that the Soviet state would soon become a mighty, advanced,
prosperous state, and its peoples the happiest on earth. .
What gave the Soviet state such strength ? What made it grow
so mighty in the storms of the civil war and the war against the forces
of intervention ? From what sources did it derive the energy to
overcome the enormous difficulties of the transition from capitalism
to Socialism ? . ' - .

Tula and occupied thirty-nine out of the forty districts of the Tula
region. They occupied the headwaters of the Volga and a consider-
able part of the Kalinin province with the ‘town of Kalinin. They
threatened Moscow. ’ , 1

The Hitlerites boasted that they would occupy Moscow and -

' Leningrad, the Caucasus, and the whole territory of the U.S.S.R_ 1
up to the Urals before the winter of 19.41. ' a r 

This was how the second war of intervention of German’ "
imperialism against us had developed by the autumn of 1941.

The Germans are inﬂicting tremendous injuries on the Soviet
state and the Soviet people. Their aim is the enslavement of the . 
peoples of the U.S.S.R., the physical extermination of the Russian 1 i_ 7”» '
and other Soviet peoples, the destruction of the monuments of  
Soviet culture. They want to seize our factories and our land. They " ..
loot and rob wherever they go, they burn the towns and Villages, ..
hang, shoot and burn alive peaceful citizens. They have buried 
alive in pits and wells thousands of people. They spare neither old A
people nor infants. They commit unspeakable atrocities against S
the population, take away everything they can carry away from
occupied territory to their own impoverished country. They drive 1 .
away to slavery and for use in brothels hundreds of thousands of 
Soviet women. ‘ y ‘

Once before, in the years 1914-18, the Germans had already
waged war against us, ﬁrst against Russia and after‘ the October
revolution against the Soviet Republic. They then occupied almost
as much territory as now. At that time they were smashed.‘ Now
they have again attacked the Soviet Republic. . , ‘

‘Elia: The country was subjected to a severe test of all the forces it V I
had accumulated during the quarter-century of the existence of 7
Soviet power. The test was applied to the political system of the -
Soviet state. The test was applied to the alliance between the.; ;,
workers and peasants of the U.S.S.R. The test was applied togthe
"great fraternity of nations which is the U.S.S.R. The test was
V applied to the entire national economy of the Soviet Union, to its
Socialist industry, to its collective agriculture. The U.S.S.R. passed
all these tests with honours. The Government of the U.S.S.R., the
Socialist Soviet state, proved to be the most stable in the world. :_. :~
The alliance of the workers and peasants proved indestructible. _ ,
Indestructible and terrible for the enemy proved the great fraternity
of the nations of the Soviet Union, the bond of brotherhood forged
by Lenin and Stalin. The mighty economic system of the Soviet Z
state, its vast industry and its collective Socialist agriculture, have
stood up to every test. ' . '
Despite the occupation of vastterritories by the enemy, the Red’ _
my received, and is receiving, everything it requires to defeat the . 
enemy. The military organization of the Soviet Union also passed 1 '1 ‘
the acid test—the Red Army proved itself a force which-«could not

' only destroy millions of German, Rumanian, Hungarian, Italian, j

’ and Finnish soldiers and officers, but could also defeat the German Y

' / Army Iiear Moscow and drive it back in the winter of 1941. '

 C "The Soviet people were, and are, led by their well-tried leader, ,
I‘ Comrade Stalin, just as in the war of 1918-20 they were led by.
, Comrade Lenin- _ , . _
When Hitlerite Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Comrade

_ U  Stalin was appointed Chairman of the State Defence Committee
R .   and xPeople—’s Commissar for Defence. The organizer of the
- '  victories of the Red Army in the civil war of 1918-20 is now at
nr fl  the head of the Soviet people organizing victory over the Hitlerite
 3%? occupationists.
3 g  ‘ t On July 3rd, 1941, Comrade Stalin made a broadcast speech in
Le‘  ‘-‘ which he called on the whole Soviet people to wage a patriotic war
n V ; . and to ﬁght to their last breath against Hitlerite Germany,_the worst
,1‘ , [enemy of the human race. He called on them to organize guerilla
y detachments in the rear of the enemy, and expressed his complete
;, _ conﬁdence that in this righteous war of liberation the U.S.S.R.
d would not stand alone, that the temporary advantages of Hitlerite
d Germany would be eliminated in the course of the struggle, that the
~_t f , forces of the enemy would be destroyed, while -the forces of the
n ; U.S.S.R. would grow as the war goes on.
e The speech made by Comrade Stalin on November 6th, 1941,
,f ~ on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the October revolution, was of .
_ tremendous importance in welding together the forces of the anti- ;
Y C Fascist coalition, in strengthening the alliance of the states ﬁghting ‘ S
1- _ , against Hitlerite Germany. Everything happened as Comrade. Stalin
I . had foreseen. Although the Germans had occupied much territory, ‘
V they had to turn back from Moscow after having suffered terrible
; losses. Germany’s plan to seize the U.S.S.R. by a rapid “lightning”
1; I 7 war ‘failed utterly, and so did Hitler’s plan to isolate the U.S.S.R.
f I from all other nations and to set all capitalist countries—Great .
3 Britain, the United States, and others——on to the Soviet Union. The f

- plan to organize a crusade against the U.S.S.R. was a dismal
failure. On the contrary, it was the Hitlerites who found themselves
isolated from the other nations of the earth. An alliance of the
, democratic countries, the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, and the United
States of America was formed against Germany and the govern-
ments co-operating with Germany in the attack on our country.

At the beginning -of October 1941 the Germans set out to

. conquer Moscow, ﬁrmly convinced that by the m_idd1e of the
_  . month Moscow would be occupied by the German Army. But
  ’ in the middle of October the offensive of the German Army was
-  "on its last legs without getting beyond the distant approaches to
Moscow, and Hitler was forced to bring up fresh forces, to throw ’ ~-

'in all- his reserves for a new offensive, which this time was to be

, ﬁnal. Boasting that this time Moscow would be taken without . _
fail, the Germans attacked furiously, sparing neither men nor 

, machines, using tremendous quantities of aircraft, tanks, and other ‘ _e . ._

‘ 2 weapons. At some points they came very close to Moscow—-they 5 

. came up to Kashira, Krassnaya Polyana, Skhodna, and threatened
to outﬂank and surround Moscow. ‘
‘ But they had forgotten thatthey had to deal

a Soviet people, with the great party of Lenin, and with thebrilliatlt‘

ll  leader of the Soviet people and of the Red Army, Comrade:

Stalin. ~ . . V
While the Germans were already’ dreaming of their imminent
entry into Moscow, ﬁxing dates for this function and even making
arrangements forvthe Fascist bandits to parade in Red Square,
Comrade Stalin in Moscow was organizing a mighty paralysing
counter-blow against the robber armies of Hitlerite.'Germany. ‘

On November 6th, 1941, at a meeting of the Moscow Soviet of ‘ G

Workers’ Delegates and the social and party organizations of the
city of Moscow, Comrade Stalin made a speech in which he sum.-.
marized the result of twenty—four years of Soviet power and four
months of war. He showed how the plans of Hitlerite Germany to
wage a lightning war had failed. He explained the reasons for the

' temporary reverses of our army and showed how these reasons were

being eliminated. He called on the whole Soviet people and on
the Red Army to‘ wage a war of extermination against the German

‘invaders. He showed how the forces of the ‘enemy were dwindling ,
while the forces of the U.S.S.R. were increasing. He called on the.
whole nation and the Red Army to spare no effort for the complete i
' destruction of the enemy.
Next morning, November 7th, 1941, the Red Army held av

parade in the Red Square in Moscow. Comrade Stalin made a
speech in which he recalled the year 1918, when our country was in
a far more diﬂicult position than at present. He spoke of the

great signiﬁcance of our struggle, of the great ideological ‘andf

cultural heritage which we were defending. , .
These two speechesof Comrade Stalin on November 6th and

7th, 1941, like his speech on July 3rd, 1941, will be recorded in the i

history of the patriotic war of the Soviet people and in the history

of the world as the most important, majestic, and powerful docu-gt

ments of the period. Comrade Sta1in’s call was heard everywhere.

C It served as a fresh stimulus to spur on the workers in the factories

who were forging the tools for the destruction of the enemy.‘ It
inspired the collective farmers to even greater efforts in assisting
the Red Army and intensiﬁed the struggle of the Soviet intelli-

gentsia against the Hitlerites. It encouraged the peoples of the R

countries occupied by the Germans to carry on a merciless struggle

against the Fascist invaders. It strengthened the international ties .-
of the U.S.S.R. and.the anti-Fascist coalition of the democratic

countries. , «
Soon a turning-point was reached in the war. The Red Army

F re-took Rostov-on-Don, Kalinin, Tikhvin, Klin, and soon after: ,

wards the provinces of Tula and ‘Moscow were .completely, and,

the province of Kalinin almost completely, liberated. The liberation

of the province of Leningrad, the Crimea, the provinces of Kursk, T

Orel, Smolensk, Kharkov, and other provinces and‘ territories of the
Soviet land from the Fascist pollution could now begin. The
Hitlerite army began its retreat. Freezing to death in the snow

 drifts of Russia, wilting under the blows of the Red Army and the

;.demoralized, vermin-ridden German Army withdrew from Moscow,
followed by thehatred and curses ofall. ~ . 1 
- In the most dangerous days and months of 1918-20, when a
strong enemy threatened the vital centres and indeed the very
existence of the republic, the voice of Lenin, the leader of the‘
» Bolshevik Party and of the Soviet Government, rang out from
*Moscow. Lenin organized the defence of the country and gave the
whole working world an example of how a true leader of the people,
undaunted even in face of the greatest danger; can ﬁnd a way out
of the most difficult position.
 In the dangerous months and days of 1941-42, in those fateful. .
days of our great patriotic war, when the enemy was at the gates of V
Moscow and Leningrad threatening the very existence of the Soviet
Union, the voice of Comrade Stalin rang out conﬁdently from
,Moscow—Corn'rade Stalin who directed the forces of the Red Army, .,
the forces of the whole Soviet people, with an iron hand against the
worst enemies of the human race.
. ’ At the call of Comrade Stalin regiment after regiment manned
the fronts and struck at the enemy, inspired by the banner of Lenin
 and Stalin. The voice of Comrade Stalin rang and rings out in a
L, tireless call to battle, inspiring millions of people throughout the V
fworld with the certainty that the enemy will‘ be defeated.
_ f In the springof 1942the positionof the U.S.,S.R. was especially
:2 serious. There was no second front in Europe. Hitler, making
‘ good use of the fact that he ‘had to fear no attack from Western V
Europe, threw all his forces against the Soviet Union. This time .
‘he did not attack along the wholefront but concentrated all his
‘forces in the south-east, with the intention of seizing the Crimea and
‘ t the Black Sea Coast and the Northern Caucasus, forcing the Don
V »and, the Volga and seizing the oilwells of the Caucasus. He
succeeded in occupyingsevastopol, Kerch, and part of the Northern
Caucasus, taking Rostov-on-Don again and coming close to Stalin-
,grad. .
’ Comrade Stalin, in his Orders of the Day of February 23rd, 1942
 (on the occasion of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Red Army)
1;-and of May 1st, pointed out a number of deﬁciencies which we had
to eliminate before we could win the war. Comrade Stalin stressed
that the Red Army had everything it,needed for victory excepting
 only one thing: the ability to put to the best use the ﬁrst-class
1 technical equipment put at its disposal by our country. ‘These
Orders of the Day had a tremendous inﬂuence on the Red Army.
i‘.De/spite the considerable loss of territory in 1942, the Red Army
i grew stronger, held up the German offensive on almost every
front, and on certain sectors by the autumn of 1942 it could engage
 active operations and hit hard at the German-Fascist troops.
_ _ The Soviet people and its Red Army overcame all the difficulties
1 the struggle they had to ‘ wage alone against the enormous
itlerite army which wasstaking everything on as single card in this ’
senseless and bloody game beguiyilby the Hitlerite icannibals. The

 
  

     

Red Army learnt to hate the enemy and ﬁght him with determina-
,tion. The moral and political unity of the Soviet people became
even stronger and the ties between the front and the rear became
. even closer.  ~
‘  The nation-wide Socialist emulation of 1942 raised the produc- ,
F‘ A tivity of labour to an even higher level and rendered possible the
, manufacture of even more weapons and munitions of war. These
‘efforts of the civilian population in turn inspired the Red Army to
even greater courage and determination in the struggle, and resulted
in many deeds of mass and individual heroism on the part of Red
Army men. T
From the beginning of the war to September 24, 1942, three
hundred and twenty—eight members of the Red Army were honoured 7
by the conferment on them of the title of “Heroesof the Soviet ~.j
:Union”. In the Red Navy the number thus honoured was forty- »
eight. ' - . J ' _
Everyone in the Soviet Union knows the names ‘of Captain .
.. Gastello, of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, of the heroic twenty-eight
‘ - guardsmen of Major-General Panﬁlov’s division, of the Black Sea ,
— sailors and other selﬂess heroes of the Soviet Union who gave their * ‘
lives for our great country. s . .
Our men now go into battle steeled by experience and hatred
and ready for any sacriﬁce in the service of our country. ’

of the excellent equipment it possesses, by its profound hatred of V
the enemy. _ . f
On the Caucasian Black Sea Coast an Adigian, Khatit Hamid, .
spoke at a meeting and expressed his hatred of the enemy who was 
devastating his native land. He said:

“Comrades! Beyond that ridge lies my native Adigia, now ii}
' groaning under the heel of the German killers. There the  ,
women sing an old song when they rock the cradle of their 
child : ‘Let him who is no coward win happiness for himself with ’ '
the slxlavord. He will either lose‘ his life or become a man of 
wort .’ ‘ A 
“Comrades, I worked on a collective farm, Iwas its chairman, .4
and we called it ‘Shiache’, which means ‘New World’. This, "
my friends, was really a new beautiful world for us Adigiaffs. , .
The farm had ﬂocks of thousands of sheep. We haryested \ 7 ' 
many tons of grain and vegetables from our ﬁelds so wide that‘ I  
you could not see their boundaries. The house of every member " 
of the collective was a horn of plenty. ‘ I I 
“What did‘ the Germans do with our farm‘? They ruined it, — 1
looted it, burned it; they took the goods we had produced by '  -1; .
our hard work and carried them away to their accursed Germany.  F‘_j_
I think of this every time I shoot at a Fascist, every time I go  i‘'‘‘
into battle. Recently we stormed some Fascist dugouts at,night _'  ‘
and went for the Germans with bullets, bayonets, and riﬂe- 2 
butts. My heart was full of joy that I could take revenge on the ’  
thieves and murderers.” ’ '- . 

The struggle for the Northern Caucasus, the struggle‘ for Stalin- _
grad, all this is a struggle for our Socialist mother-country, a" 
struggle for the whole progressive human race. The struggle for j  ‘if ,.
< Stalingrad lasted more than three months. The Germans ﬁrst  ,
- reported the occupation of Stalingrad, then they wrote in their  
V newspapers and announced in their wireless that the occupation of 37
Stalingrad was a matter of days. But many German divisions were  
destroyed at Stalingrad. Stalingrad heroically defended our Soviet  
soil, Stalingrad never wavered, it remained a heroic city, a strong- ~*
hold ‘of our land, Whole German armies perished at Stalingrad.‘
The Hitlerites conquered Poland in twen'ty-eight days, but at 
Stalingrad they required twenty-eight days to move from one 
‘ street into the next. The Germans smashed France in thirty-'
seven days, but Stalingrad they could not smash even in four“ _
months. This showed how the strength of the Red Army 
- grown ; it showed the strength of the whole Soviet people, it showed :_-
the results of twenty-ﬁve years of Soviet power; it showed the ._

“South-Eastern Prussia”. But Byelorussia does not want to be
the Fascist colony of “South-Eastem Prussia”. It wants to, be a
. free Byelorussian Soviet republic, one of the band of brothers
;. »_ who constitute that commonwealth of nations, the U.S.S.R. The
 Byelorussian people responded to the merciless terrorism of the
‘ Germans by a guerilla war embracing the whole people.

.3 .1 a serious menace to the German Army. The important part played

 Fascist robbers at the approaches to Moscow is well known. The
'5; best members of the Bolshevik Partyparticipated in and led the
 guerilla movement—for instance, Comrade Bormotov, secretary
j;} of the Ostashevo regional committee of . the Party, and Ilya Kuzln.
 ‘hero of the Soviet Union. , T S

;-‘f The guerilla movement took on gigantic proportions in the
‘V gLenin_grad .region. Here whole areas are in the hands of the

‘" sent a letter to the editor of Pravda in which they wrote that Soviet
power had been restored in a territory 120 kilometres wide and 80
kilometres deep behind the front line. , . '

_  fguerillas, assisted by parachute landings by Red Army units in the

 rear of the enemy, help not only to destroy posts of command of

fir the way for the Red Army. There can be no doubt that in the next
 phase of the war, when a second front will be opened‘ and the
progress of the Red Army may be much more rapid, the guerilla
movement will play a particularly important part. _ _

’ The war is not ended yet, and bloody battles are still ‘being
fought. Much work, much effort, many sacriﬁces still await our
country before we can purge our-land of the Hitlerite blackguards,
liberate the peoples of our country from the slavery which threatens
them, and wipe the Hitlerites from the face of the earth. But what

T he Party ofLenih and of Stalin is the Organizer of the Struggle fiqriif

Victory Over the Fascist Invaders .

LEN_1N and Stalin created, educated, trained, and strengthened the S
Bolshevik Party. This Party, born inthe underground circles of the
nineties of the last century, passed through a stern school of struggle
and was steeled in the battles against Tsarism and all enemies of L
the toilers. The Party led the masses into battle in three revolutions.‘
» In October 1917 it led the peoples of our country to the greatest of a
all victories, the great Socialist October revolution. « ‘

This revolution occupies a special position in the history of:

 mankind. L . ’ » ,. 

It was the ﬁrst victorious Socialist proletarian revolution,

 It was a revolution in‘ which for the ﬁrst time in the historyoi
the human race a dictatorship of the proletariat won a durable T
victory. - S ’  ,. , ‘ ‘ L

It was the ﬁrst revolution to create a new system of government, 
a new form of state———the Socialist Soviet state. ” 

_ It was the ﬁrst revolution to result in the creation of a Socialist
,so<.:.iety- ' ‘ ‘ ‘  *
if It was the ﬁrst revolution to solve in a radical fashion the problem” _
of national minorities. S g

It was the ﬁrst-revolution to solve the peasant problem.

It was the ﬁrst revolution in history to demonstrate the possi-' " _
bility of a planned Socialist economy not only in industry but also’
in agriculture and in distribution. ” ‘ 7/’ f .

. This was the ﬁrst revolution to make all achievements of science .' L
T and art accessible to all workers and not only to privileged classes;
‘ . i It was the ﬁrst revolution to establish the full equality of women,

not merely in words but in practice. .. .. L _

_Finally, the Socialist October revolution was the ﬁrst revolution

. to have for its leader, inspirer, and organizer a single party~——thev

most revolutionary, the most advanced working~class party,a4

over to the side of the working class. And although before the
October revolution the party numbered less than half a million and

world as well, it led the people to vi.ctory. ~ ’ .
’ The Bolshevik Party led the armed struggle of the Soviet people
. against the White Guard and interventionist armies. And although
_ v the enemy had many more troops, and its technical equipment and
S available commanding cadres were far superior to oursyalthough
the Soviet country was ruined, impoverished, and lacked experience‘
in warfare and in government, the Bolshevik Party led the toilers
of the U.S.S.R. to victory over all their enemies, internal and
T external. . ~ ’ "
During the twenty-ﬁve years of existence of Soviet power the
Bolshevik Party directed the work of constructive government, the

, obstacles had to be overcome on this road, and although in the past
f we had not, and could not have had, any experience whatever in
‘creating such a Socialist society, such a Socialist economy, the
. Bolshevik Party led» the toilers of the U.S.S.R. to victory, to
 Socialism.

, In order to win this victory the masses had to be convinced that
T they yvere moving in the right direction, that it was possible to build
«up Socialism in one country. In order to win this victory it was
‘ necessary to arouse an unprecedented enthusiasm, a fever of
constructive effort, to create cadres of builders of Socialism, to sweep

 and bring about a cultural revolution.

. The Bolshevik Party, again, overcame all obstacles in this great

work of world—wide historical importance and led the people on to

the victory of Socialism. ' ,

’ ‘ By‘ what means did the Bolshevik Party win this victory ?

- Above all by its ideas. Armed with the great doctrine of
.Marxism-Leninism, the Bolsheviks knew, the Bolsheviks were

the workers.

“ The Bolsheviks won thanks to their iron discipline.

The Bolsheviks won through their‘ close ties with the masses.

The Bolsheviks won, and are winning, through their fearlessness,
itheircontempt for death whenever the interests of the people are
at stake. They were taught this by Lenin and Stalin. The tre-
inendous difficulties of underground work, the open street demon-
hstrations, the barricades of armed risings, three revolutions, the
gcivil War, the war against the armies of intervention stee ed fearless
fmensuch as Sverdlov, Dzerzhi-nski, Ordzhonikidze, Fru ze, Kirov,

,y- ‘

S . One of the reasons why the peoples of the Soviet state were able
. to build and defend their state-in the struggle with their enemies

Was, that the power of the Soviets was in complete conformity with
the interests of the entire working population. This new and most
perfect form of Government evolved by the working class in the
course of thestruggle was a Government defending the interests of
all workers. Soviet power offered the widest possibilities for the
development of the productive forces of the country. Soviet power
radically eliminated the exploitation of man by man. Soviet power

helpedveach nation or national group to. develop its own culture, V ,

national in form, Socialist in essence. Soviet power brought science
and the arts within the reach of all workers. Soviet power trans-
formed the entire economfc life of the country,‘ and turned the old.
Tsarist Russia——a poverty-stricken, illiterate, and in many respects
backward country-—into a'leading industrial Power, into a land of
advanced and mighty Socialist collective agriculture, into a country
of highly developed culture. Soviet power did away with inequality
between the various nations living within the borders of the Russian
Empire. Soviet power was able to do all this because it was led

from the beginning by the well-tried Bolshevik Party, and because‘

this Party and the whole people were led.by leaders as devoted to the

cause of the ‘people as Lenin and Stalin.

It was in Russia that Soviet power was ﬁrst established’. Such a
government had never existed in the whole history of the huma
race. What, then, are these Soviets ? '

“The Soviets,” said Lenin in September 1917, “are a new
form of State apparatus which in the ﬁrst place provides an

armed force of workers and peasants, i.e. a force not divorced ’
from the people like the forces of the old conscript army, but '

united with the people by the closest ties. From the military
point of view,‘ this force is incomparably stronger than any
previous army; from a: revolutionary point of view there is no
substitute of any kind for it. Secondly, this machinery gives

such close, indivisible, easily controllable and renewable contact _

with the masses, i.e. with the majority of the people, that nothing
in the old Government machinery can be even remotely com-
pared with it. Thirdly, this machinery» is far more democratic
than any previous machinery, because its personnel is elected

and can be deposed by the will of the people without any . 

bureaucratic formalities. In the fourth place, it establishes close
ties with the various trades and professions, thus rendering much
easier the introduction of various reforms of the most incisive
character, without any bureaucracy whatever. In the ﬁfth place,
‘it provides aform of organization for the vanguard, that is to
say the most class—conscious, most energetic, most advanced
section of the oppressed classes (i.e. the workers and peasants),
thusproviding a machinery by means of which the vanguard of

, the oppressed class can lift up, develop, and educate the whole
gigantic mass of their class, who up to now, were entirely excluded

attack and surround the focal points of the enemy . . . with tlie;

slogan, “Perish one and ' all, but never let the enemy pass”. 
many a time were such groups formed at the call of Lenin and Stalin,
groups who exhibited the greatest daring and defeated the enemy. ‘ l

The Bolsheviks always won by their ﬁrmness and persistence.. ,_
(They were always able patiently to accumulate their forces, frame; S

their organizations, work persistently at recruiting, welding together
and training their army. The Bolsheviks always had before them?
the example set by their leaders, who showed the greatest ﬁrmness
at the most difﬁcult moments, in the greatest danger. Lenin and

Stalin always taught, and still teach, the Bolsheviks to acquirethis

ﬁrmness.

The Bolsheviks won because of their inexorable attitude: S

towards all capitulators, towards the waverers, towards the rotten
and unreliable elements, towards panic-mongers, cowards, and
self-seekers. Lenin and Stalin teach us to look the bitterest, ‘most
menacing reality straight in the face, without illusions but with
an accurate appreciation of the balance of forces. However bitter.
the truth may have been, the Bolsheviks never lost their faith in
their ﬁnal victory and waged merciless war against all those within

the Party and outside it who allowed themselves to be frightened by"

the enemy, who succumbed to a fataldoubt or lost their faith.
Lenin and Stalin teach us to be ideologically relentless in our
struggle against opponents. The Bolsheviks were steeled in’ their
struggle against the opportunists. The Party of Lenin andlstalinﬁ
was steeled in the struggle against the Mensheviks, Socialist-
Revolutionaries, and Anarchists, in the struggle against ‘the
bourgeois nationalists, in the struggle against the T rotskyists,
against the so-called “Left-Wing Communists”, against the
Right-Wing restorers of capitalism. Had it ‘not been for this
relentless struggle our enemies would have disrupted our Party 7
from within, would have brought to naught the results of allour;
efforts, all our labours, and as a “ﬁfth column” of the Fascistswouldf
have opened the gates to the enemy and betrayed our country-and
our people at the most difﬁcult moment. i T ‘

The Bolsheviks won because they are ﬂesh of the ﬂesh and bone?
of the bone of their people. What gives the Bolsheviks the strength

toovercome all difficulties is their devotion to the people, to the
people’s interests,’ to the cause of Socialism. Comrade Stalin’ said
that life would have no meaning for him if he could 11ot‘\devote.,.

L every day of it to the struggle for the improvement of the conditionfs__

of the workers———a.nd these words ‘express the noble aims whic,

constitute the meaning of every Bolshevik"s life; There is no,
sacriﬁce too great if it helps to achieve the objects envisaged by

I It is hardly surprising that in all diﬂicult situations the toilers
. send their best men and women into the ranks of the Party and
Young Communist League -as “battle reinforcements”. Thus it
g was after_ the death of Lenin, when a great “Lenin enrolment”
, : streamed into the ranks of the party. In the present struggle for

V our Socialist mother-country, in this most dangerous situation, men
and commanders who have shown their devotionto their people
on the battleﬁelds are making application to join the Communist
Party_in great numbers. Thus in the ‘first half of 1942, 553,000
persons were admitted to the Party as candidates for full member-
iship, and in August 1942 alone .132,000 persons were admitted to
 Party as members. In one year of war, from July 1st, 1941,
to’July 1st, 1942, 957,632 persons were admitted to the Young
Communist—League. In the ﬁrst half of 1942, 368,492 persons were
iapdmitted to the Young Communist League through civilian channels
alone. These ﬁgures show the attitude of the people to the Bolshevik

 the Socialist revolution of October and safeguarded the great
 achievements of Socialism during the last twenty-ﬁve years. I

25 YEARS OF
SOVIET POWER

by

EM ELYAN YAROSLAVSKY

This book deals with the achievements of the Soviet State
during the 25 years of its existence. It gives a complete
picture of the growing might of the Soviet Union covering all
aspects of its many-sided life, from its very beginning till
November 7th, I942.

The book is divided into eight sections as follows :

(I) The struggle for power of the Soviets and signiﬁcance of
the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution.

(2). The Red Army, the army of brotherhood and friendship i
— of the peoples of the U.S.S.R., the steadfast defence of
the Socialist motherland.

(3) The U.S.S.R. has become a mighty power.

. ti
(4) The friendship of the peoples—the great achievement of 
the October Socialist Revolution. 4

1 (5) The Soviet Union is the country with the leading socialist
culture.

(6) Woman in the U.S.S.R. has become a great power.

(7) The great patriotic war of the Soviet people against
Hitlerite Germany is the all-round test of the achieve-
ments of the October Socialist Revolution.

(8) The party of Lenin-Stalin is the organizer of the ﬁght for
the victory over the Hitlerite occupationists.

T from all political life, and stood;out‘side. history. In the sixth

place it affords" an opportunity to combine the advantages of I

parliamentarism with the advantages of immediate and direct
democracy; that is to say to combinelegislative and executive
functions in the persons of elected representatives of the people.

Compared with bourgeois parliamentarism, this is a step forward ~

of universal and historical importance . . . in the development

of democracy. Had the popular creative force of the revolu-,.

tionary class not‘ established the Soviets, then the revolution in
Russia would have been a hopeless enterprise, for there can be
no doubt that the proletariat would have been unable to retain
power with the old machinery, and it would have been impossible
to create a new machinery on the spur of the momen .”

Of course Soviet power was not to the liking of those’ who were
accustomed to‘ sitting and riding on the backs of the people. Soviet
power was even reproached with violating democracy, that is to say

with violating the power of the people. The truth is that Soviet _

N‘ . .
power IS the highest form of democracy.

In November 1919, in an article entitled “Soviet Power and the
Position of -Women”, Lenin wrote:

“We aﬂirm that the changeover to Soviet power has given‘ an
unprecedented impulse to the development of democracy both

in width and in depth, but of a democracy for the working '

masses oppressed by capitalism, and hence of a democracy for
the vast majority of the people, and hence of a Socialist democ-
racy (for the workers) in contradistinction to bourgeois"
democracy (for the exploiters, for the capitalists, for the rich).”

There were plenty of revolutions in other countries too, but none

; led to the victory of the power of the workers like the great Socialist

October revolution.

Comrade Stalin has pointed this out; In his article, “The
e _ International Character of the October Revolution”, which he wrote

for the tenth anniversary of October, Comrade Stalin’ thus deﬁnes

" the d.iﬁ"erences between the Socialist October revolution and all

other revolutions : -

* “Revolutions in the past usually ended by one group of
exploiters replacing another group. of exploiters at the helm of
government. The exploiters changed; exploitation remained.
Such was the case during the liberation movements of the slaves.

" Such was the case in the period of the rebellions of the serfs.

Such was the czsa during the period of the well-known ‘great’
revolutions in England, France, and Germany. I am not
‘ speaking of the Paris Commune, which was the first glorious,
heroic, but unsuccessful attempt on the part of the proletariat

S

to turn history against capitalism. \

‘-‘The October revolution differs from these revolutions in _

principle. ‘Its aim is not to substitute one form of exploitation
for another form of exploitation, one group of exploiters for
. ' 7 . ' ‘
