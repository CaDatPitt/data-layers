gone to see Hoover. They sat down in the Big White House
and said, “Please do something about the surplus of cotton.
There‘is so much cotton we can’t make any money.”
No ‘share-cropper went to call on President Roosevelt.
’ No 20—acre tenant went to call on him. Not a single small
farmer was invited to any of the conferences. It was too
far to go from the cotton fields, anyway. They couldn’t pay
the train fare to Washington. The President would probably
say he was too busy to see them. And, besides, they were
busy raising cotton. , '
1 ' Now the big boys sat down with President Roosevelt and
the other politicians to ﬁgure out what to do with the 13
million bales of cotton left over in the warehouses from last
year, and another big crop on the way. \

One fellow at the meeting, whose name was something
like Brown, didn’t seem to know the hang of things like
the others. He said, “Why don’t we give away half of that
13 million bales to people who need it and can’t afford to
buy it?” This didn’t please the merchants who owned the
cotton in the warehouses. They shouted at him angrily,
“What! Give away the cotton that belongs to us? Don’t
be a fool.” Well, Mr. Brown saw the point of that all right.

“Well, then,” said Brown, “if we have to get rid of some
of the cotton and if we don’t want to give it away, then
we’ll have to burn some of the cotton that’s in the ware-
houses.” \

Then someone asked, “Which merchants here will agree
to destroy part of the cotton theylhold in warehouses?”
Nobody answered. Every merchant looked at the others,
, hoping that the other fellow would do it. Nobody wanted
hi ;'7\, .. to‘ burn up his own cotton.

V’  _ A fellow named Green had another idea. “How about
_this yea"r’s"cotton crop? Maybe the boll weevil will get at

it. That will reduce the surplus all right.” Right away a.
bug expert working for Roosevelt said there was no hope
there. He had made a trip out to the ﬁelds and so far the
boll weevil wasn’t going so good this year. They just
couldn’t depend on the weevil to eat up the surplus.

‘Finally they hit on the plow—up scheme. Just the way
Hoover had told the farmers to plow under every third
row,‘let Roosevelt tell them to plow_up one fourth of the
cotton acreage. That would reduce the surplus and the cot-

..ton in the warehouses could all be sold at a higher price.

\ “Will the farmers help the boll weevils?” asked Brown,
doybtfully.

/ “Sure they will if the President puts on a big campaign
and gets a lot of speakers to tell them plowing up cotton
is the patriotic thing to do.” This was the answer and

\everybody agreed to it. That is, except one man who was
the owner of a 2,000 acre cotton plantation in Mississippi——-
a man who had 100 share—cr_opper~ families raising cotton
for him.

“Well,” said the plantation owner, “I don’t think 1311
have my cotton plowed up unless I get paid something for
it.” '

They all talked about this for a while and ﬁnally decided
. that‘the plantation owner would haveto be paid some money
for plowing up part of his crop.

 

They also decided that it would look pretty bad to pay
the plantation owner for plowing up cotton and not pay the
- small owner of 50 acres of cotton land. So they decided to

 
  
 

" to even the white tenants working on thirds. Just to make
0  look better.

     
 

 

‘ pay something to the small owners, and maybe something p

 

'er’s name and the merchant’s name on the check, too. Then

to this, won’t they?”

 
 

The Checks for Plowing Cotton Given to Bosses

One of the bankers who was at the meeting said that
was all right if they ﬁxed it so the small owners and tenants
would have to turn the money over to the banks right away
for payment of debt. The merchantsisaid the same thing.
They wopld like to have the farmer paid some money for
plowing up, because then they could collect from the farm-
ers. “But make sure to ﬁx it up about the collection,’_’ they
said.

i “That“ will be easy,” said one of Roosevelt’s experts.
“We’ll mail a check to the farmer but we’ll put the bank-

the farmer won’t be able to cash his check until the banker
or merchant gets a chance at it first.” i

“All right,” said the bankers and merchants. ,

But then a new point came up. “Who is going to pay
for the plowing up? You said the government is going to
mail’ out some checks. But where is the government going
to get the money?” asked Brown. ,

“Oh, that’s very simple,” answered one of the govern-
ment’s tax experts. “We’ll put a processing tax on cotton.”

We Pay the Processing Tax in Overalls

.“What do you mean, processing tax? ” asked Brown.

, “Just this. We’ll put a tax of 4- cents a pound on cotton
that is made up into overalls" and shirts ‘and other things. The
manufacturer will have to pay the tax to the government.
But he will just add something on the price of the overalls
and shirts that he sells to people all over the country. The

tax will really be paid by everyone who buys these things-— ‘

citygworkers and farmers. The manufacturers will agree

   

   
  
  
  
    
   
  
  
   
 
 

“Yes, sir!” said one of the overall manufacturers who

was at the __-meeting. i‘We’ll add the tax to the price all
right, and a wee bit more.” ‘
Brown was still doubtful.’ “I don’t think‘ it will look so
good, our getting all the money.”

Relief. Everybody Wants the farmer to be relieved.”
Farm Relief-—-I_{oosevelt Style

And that is just what happened. The /fgriculturalp Ad-
fustment’ Act was passed and" they called it Farm Relief.
Its lawyer language gave the government the power to de-
stroy our crops.

lords'and"‘.bankers are slick at fooling people. And the farm
agents acted as the agents for the federal government, ytlxe
big farmers, and the business men. Between them they got
900 thousand owners and rich tenants to sign contracts and
to plow up 10 million acres of extra ﬁne cotton. “Never
mind the poor tenants and croppers,” read the orders from

Washington, “the landlords will take care of them.”
How the Gyp Was Worked

And the landlords did take care of them. You could hear
landlords talking about it in the back of time merchants’
‘ stores, at the post oﬂice, anywhere. In one of these groups
an insurance company agent, the manager of 15 planta-
tions, _ boasted that he didn’t have to do any explaining to
his Negro croppers: “I just told them go plow under 5 acres
apiece and they did it. No questions asked. No trouble about
checks. The money all came in my name. I_ﬁxed that up
with’ the county agent. Next year ‘there won’t be so many
‘of. the bastards running arourfd my place.”

“Oh, that’s all right,” said Leak; “We’ll call it Farm '

The local bosses put the plan across. These rich land- ii

 

 

. aﬁd white.

 
  

 

4 Then a time merchant spoke, “Well, I let mine put 
their mark on the contract, but that didn’t mean nothin’. 
When the checks ﬁnally came, I got them all together and
said, ‘Now, you niggers sign here’, and they signed. That
was easy.”
. At this point the third landlord interrupted. He was from
the north-eastern part of Mississippi. “Hell, you fellers are
lucky. Those ‘hill’Billy’ whites that work for me started to
make trouble. Said they’d been promised cash. I had to give
them a few dollars to keep them quiet, and credit the rest 
of the stuff on the books. Oh well, it doesn’t matter much, é 
they’re so deep in debt to me now they’ll never get out.” 
Then they began to talk about some of the tricks some 1
of their landlord friends had played on croppers, Negro

 

* “Take Smith for example, he deliberately told his crop-
pers that. as long as the government was going to plow up
their cotton they better sell it to him. So the darn fools sold .
out their share of half the crop for a few dollars, thinking
that was all they could get for it.”

“Some of those farmers on the committee inmy county
were pretty cute,” said the landlord. “They went around
telling their tenants and croippers and even their neighbors
that ‘if they didn’t sign up they would be taxed 4- cents a
pound for every pound of cotton they sold. Naturally, they
all signed up.” ' ‘

Roaring with laughter, they got up to go. But it was not
always so easy. Sometimes these respectable landlords and
townspeople had to use violence. The papers ‘in South Car-
olina were fi1ll- of the news that the Ku Klux Klan had
pulled up the ’\cotton plants of tenants who had refused to
be fooled into signing. _ '

only because croppers’ furnishings had already been paid
for that the landlord kept them on the job this year. He
wanted‘ to sweat his money’s worth out of them. ‘

The Fight for Land, Homes, and Cash

This New Deal. scheme is to reduce 15 million acres of
cotton. This is equal to squeezing at least 500,000 families
out of cotton farming. It will take the jobs of thousands
of cotton pickers. Where are we to go? Can. they force
over 2 million souls to starve? Certainly not. We will not
starve, we will fight! But how? h

Race prejudice whipped up by the bosses keeps white and
Negro farmers apart. But starvation brings us together.

The first step in our struggles against the grab system of
the capitalists must be the fight for food. We will not
starve. We will not eat acorns, snakes, and squirrels. We
will get all our neighbors who face the New Deal death to
march on the county Court House for immediate relief.
This will not be easy. For some are white and some are

black. But more and..more of both races see’ through the"

wall of hocus-pocus and, above all,l we are hungry.
We will not move from our cabins just because the boss-
man expects to rent our patch to the government. ‘

gThe bosses will bluster, but they will be afraid. And they

Action and Organization

I .

White farmers can organize in the open ‘with less danger
than the Negroes. They should be especially active in or-
ganizing Committees of Action and calling for joint strug-
gles. The farmers who joined in -the demonstration in town
should be invited to join in electing and supporting the com-
mittees of action. Some will be afraid. But hunger makes
people more sociablerand farmers are learning their lesson.

They have seen cotton go to 10 cents a pound and overalls
jump from‘ 49 cents to over a dollar. The same is true of
all things, ﬂour, fat-back. No matter what we buy, it is
twice as much and -is still going up faster than anything
we have to sell. Now they are trying to stop us from selling
anything. Yes, we have learned our lesson. Only our own
struggles with all others who are robbed can help us now.

And we will organize that struggle. The Crqppers Union
will grow. Committees of Action will be formed. We will
continuethe fight against ‘evictions. The State groups should
affiliate with other militant organizations and join a Na-
tional United Front of all farmers.

Where, because of the terror, it is’necessary for Negroes
and whites to meet and organize separately, delegates should
be sent to meet together and plan joint action and united
struggle.  r‘ _

The Negro croppers organizing’: into the Share Crcppers
Union should, because of the terror, meet in small groups
of ten with a captain leader of each unit.- They meet wher-
everit is safe from spies. Then captains meet and so all units
are .welded into a solid front. a

Every cabin and cotton patch that makes a home for

some Negro or white farm family must be protected. If
any landlord, time merchant, or agent dares to cut furnish-

ing or threatens to drive a family down the road, our or--‘

ganizations will know in a few hours. And the united
strength of organized protest will come down. on that land-

’ lord, time merchant or business agent.

Our local farm struggles must be united with those of
farmers in other counties and other States. City workers
will ﬁght with us. They will come to our meetings and tell
us of their conditions. They can help plan and carry on the

.broader ﬁght. They know what capitalists are like better

than we. They need our cotton for clothes. vThey need our
food andiour help in ﬁghting the capitalists for better jobs,

more Wages, and social insurance. And we cannot

The Government Takes a Hand
in the Cotton Patch

By GEORGE ANSTROM

WHO plants, chops, and picks American cotton?

The government counted up last year and found
two million cottoh growing families; ten million folk; a
few rich, many poor; some owning mules and some without.

Most of these cotton farmers live in small cabins in the
cotton patches, working from 10 to 20 acres on a share
contract of some sort. This little book is about them.

The war between the states shook the old master out
of the Big House on the plantation and put the Boss Man
in his place. The war changed the~word slave to the word
tenant or cropper. It took the raw-hide whip out of the
hand.of the ﬁeld boss and put the more cruel whip of debt
into the new hands which drive millions of men, women,
and children up and down the cotton rows today.

The new master is a boss man, a nearby landlord, or
the agent of a Northern corporation who now rules the
old slave plantation.

Today forty million acres are planted in cotton——in small
patches, from North Carolina to Texas, row on row of

white bolls which must be pulled by millions. of hands.

In the North and West machinery has taken the place
of much hand labor, but has only added new mortgages
to the Northern farmers’ load of debt.

In the South no machine has been invented which can
pick the stubborn cotton so well as the nimble ﬁngers of
the tenant family.

A whole century of progress has rolled around, and cat-
ton _is still a slave crop. ' The same old cotton rows cross
the land that was once a slave plantation. But today they
are planted, chopped, and picked by white as well as Negro
serfs. Millions of ,then1——-white and Negro-—bend their
backs under the whip of debt. '

The Wall of Race Prejudice Set Up by the Bosses

Across narrow country roads white tenants and croppcrs

see Negro" neighbors pulling cotton like themselves. But
more than that road separates them. Between them rises an
invisible wall——the barrier of race frejmiice-—deliberately
set up by the boss class and its government agencies. That
wall is built of fairy tales of white supremacy to keep the

white toilers from uniting with the Negro masses against'*‘

their common exploiters. From the cradle to the grave the
poorest white child is taught to look down on, hate and
fear his Negro neighbors.

Any sign of protest from Negroes is met with instant
terror. Boss inspired‘ Ku Klux Klan raids and lynching par-
ties are the order of the day. The Negro share croppcrs of
Camp Hill, Alabama, organized and fought back against
a lynch gang in 1931. They won their demands through
organized struggle. But the bosses create a general scare
of “Negro rebellion” to justify their chain gangs and other
forms of suppression. A

There is a belt of 350 counties across the South which
is the rightful homeland of the Negroes. But there, where
the Negroes are a great majority of the population, where
they have tilled the soil for generations, the white ruling

class ,0 ession ‘asserts itself with inhuman ferocity.

Both white and Negro tenants live in rickety cabins. Both
families live on hog-side, meal, and beans. Both families
have pellagra and walk in rags. Each family-——white and
black——plants, chops, and picks cotton. They haul it to the
same gin and owe it all for furnishing advances to the same
time-merchant or landlord. Yet because one farmer is white
and the ovther black—-the boss man, tirne—mer'chant or land-

lord, uses the fairy story of “white supremacy” to keep hem T

apart. And keeping them apart means keeping them’ ot_h
down. ‘

The white children go to miserable schools for a few

weeks-—the Negro children are lucky to use a bench in some

unpainted Negro church.
The whites _can vote, and are free to come and go as
they please——- if they have money andclothes. But when

~ they try to get a better share in their crop from the land-
» lord they are told that there are plenty of Negro croppers

to take their place.

Instead of ﬁghting together against slave standards of
living, these two great peoples are divided—-—white from
Negro.

The few who rule the South grow rich. They own the
land, the stores, the gins, the mills, the banks, the churches,
and the police. They do not work. But bankers and
landlords must have millions of hands and mules to grow
their white go1d——cotton. They divide and drive with race
prejudice, debt, and terror.

The Share Cropper System of Cotton Farming

These bosses control the millions who grow cotton by
advancing mule feed, store credit, and fertilizer on halves
or thirds of the crop. If the cropper has nothing but his
family labor he farms on halves. In all cases the boss keeps

_all the accounts in his private books.

No matter how high the price of cotton goes, the 
croppers on halves never get out of debt. Furnishing, f¢r- 
tilizer, and feed accounts are always added up so that ﬂiey , 

will swallow the labor of the cropper families, white or
black. » ,.
Every season nearly a million Cropper families suﬂ’er this
fate. They dare not question the honesty of their bosses’
bookkeeping. They cannot sell their own cotton, but must
deliver it baled to the boss at the big house.

About the same number of tenant families have their

, own mules. They work the land for one quarter or one

third of The crop as rent. They may even sell their own
crop. But no small tenant, white or black, who wants to
renew his rental contract to slave another season, really hopes
for cash. His cotton money is always gobbled up by his
creditors who wait ‘at the gin like spiders for a ﬂy.

Cotton will grow only in Southern countries; _but the
whole world needs clothes. So cotton must ‘travel.

American cotton patches grow one half of the world’s

O’ cotton goods.

Every year six billion hours of labor are given to clothe

the world by an army of cotton farmer;-'—by ten million

souls who live in rags.

What Happens to Our Cotton?

Usually four out of ten bales stay in the United States.
Six of the bales are loaded on ships at New Orleans, Gal-
veston, or some other port and sent across the ocean.

The bales that stay home are loaded on trucks or trains

and, are delivered to big cotton companies. Or they are put a

in warehouses and the New Orleans Cotton Exchangev

gambles on whether prices will rise or fall.~ Perhaps one '
‘ of the bales will go to a North Carolina mill and be woven,

." ‘ninto overalls and sugar bags; or it mayigo still farther i

1 North, on up to the city of Lawrence in Massachusettsf

‘U9.

  

f we sat on the bale as it rides North on a ﬂat car, we ‘
‘would see hoboes hiding behind the bale away from the

ivind. These men are looking for work and clothes. When
the car stops in a city we would see more men in lines Wait-
ing for bread. . They are hungry and need clothes. In
Lawrence we would find the mills working only part time
and the workers poor and ragged: They get small wages.
The working girls cannot buy the pretty clothes they want
for dresses. The warm underwear is stocked up; in stores.
The men in the bread lines never see them.

Some of these bales go to Manchester, a big mill town
in England. If we had gone with some of our bales of
cotton years ago we would have seen that English‘ workers
who tended the great looms .in the mill were too poor to buy
the clothes they made.

If we took a trip with a bale shipped to Japan, the same
strange sight would meet us there——mills roaring; cloth
coming off the rolls, yard after yard; and the workers get-
ting so small a wage that they couldiibarely live, let alone
buy all the goods the mills turned out. I

Then we would see these Japanese mill capitalists send the
bolts of cloth they could not sell in Japan over to China to
sell them there. And in China we would ﬁnd the farmers
so poor that they are_ able to buy a shirt only when they save
a little ‘by starving.

Capitalists Fight for World 'Markets

Andito those Chinese markets would come cloth from
English mills, and American mills," as well as the Japanese
cloth. And, what is more strange, we would ﬁnd millions

of farmers and workers of all races everywhere, shivering
in rags while rich men play their game of “Business” and

use cotton to make money and not to make people Warm ‘

and well dressed.

Then we would ﬁnd that the workers and farmers of
China and other countries cannot buy all the cloth from the
capitalists, with the result that the warehouses begin to ﬁll
up. After a while the capitalists stop their mills, and mil-
lions of woskers in all countries are out of work. They
soon stop buying anything, so that all the mills slow down.
Then cotton is no longer needed by the mills. The stream
of cotton is dammed up.

The “warehouses in New Orleans and Galveston and

lMemphis are choked with baled cotton. The railroads and

ships stand idle. The price of cotton falls-—and we are told
by government experts that surplus. cotton is to blame.

A First, remember the capitalist owns the land and trees. We

mustﬁnd out how much money you have left. Then we
will destroy all the cocoanuts you cannot pay for, and there
won’t be any surplus. If any monkey starves to death we
will give a radio talk praising him for his patriotism.”

The monkeys look at one another and wink. Then they
kick the big monkey and his capitalists who talk about surplus
right out of their cocoanut tree and have a comfortable
meal. ,, r

Russians Produce for Use

Yet there is some hope for men to eat. For way across
the ocean, in a country bigger than the United States——-
Russia—the workers and poor farmers kicked their monkey
Tzar and his surplus system out of their country. Today
that land produces clothes to wear and food to- eat.

'“But they are Russians.”

’ Surplus and Starvation for Us

But we Americans go on suﬁering under th7: foolish sys-
- tem that uses food and cotton to make money for a few
capitalists while millions shiver and are hungry. No govern-
ment expert would dare to ﬁgure out the truth about sur-
plus. Everyone with common sense knows we have too
little cotton, not too much. If every man, woman, and
child who needs clothes could get them, the warehouses
would empty over night. Mills would work full time and
we would have to grow cotton as we never did before.

Hoover Makes a Mess of It

Instead of this common sense plan, what has happened?

Everybody remembers Herbert Hoover and how he was
elected President of the United States in 1928. He promised
all the American people that he was going to abolish poverty.
He said he was going to put a chicken in every pot and an
automobile behind every house. We allknow now that he
just made these promises to get votes. He got the votes but
{he didn’t keep the promises. That’s what the politicians al-

ways do. * , i
P Bankers used to go to see President Hoover at the White
House in Washington. Bankers go to see every President
~ at the White House, whether he is a Republican or a Demo-
crat. And the President always listens, becausem th; bankers

 V have money and the power that goes with money. The

 bankers told Mr. Hoover that he had to do something about

"9 the surplus of cotton. They said prices were so low that they
weren’t able to make any money out of the cotton farmers‘
any more. They said the cotton farmers weren’t paying up

what they owed‘ to the banks.

So after the bankers and the speculators and the mer- v
, chants and the country politicians had talked to Mr. Hoover,
he decided to do something about the surplus. He decided
to destroy cotton. But what cotton should be destroyed--
the cotton in the warehouse owned by Mr. Speculatori Oh,
no, that wouldn’t do at all. Mr. Speculator wouldn’t like
L that. The farmers out in the cotton patches ought to destroy
 ' ‘ some of the cotton they are raising, said Mr. Hoover. He
 ‘i sent word out to the cotton ﬁelds that farmers should plow
under every third row of cotton. Leave two rows standing
and plow one row under, is what he said.

This sounded all right to Mr. Banker, Mr. Merchant,
and Mr. Speculator. But Hoover didn’t have the Blue Eagle
laws to give him such power over our lives as Roosevelt
has now. And so the scheme wasn’t put across.

Roosevelt Makes a “New Deal” of It

Now we have a new President. Just the way Republican
Hoover had done, Democrat Roosevelt made a lot of
promises before he was elected. He said he would give
everybody a New Deal, and hard times would be over.
Are the hard times over now? No, of course they are not.
Times are even harder for ‘the man who raises cotton and
for the man without a job and for lots of other poor people.
