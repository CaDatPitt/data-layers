upon the present vicious attacks being made against the Negro

people. Discrimination against Negro workers.and veterans,
and specially the ferocious lynchings in the South, are rapidly
increasing, yet the trade unions are doing very little to halt
this outrageous persecution. This is a big mistake, for which, if
it is continued, labor will pay dearly. Reactionary Republican
demagogues, promising relief to the Negroes, are trying to win
their support in the 1948 elections, and not without some suc-
cess. The Negroes, occupying a highly strategic position in
many doubtful northern states, constitute a progressive force
that labor cannot possibly afford to lose. Trade unionists must
learn the elementary lesson that persecution of the Negroes is
a blood brother to the Taft—Hartley law, and that both of these
constitute blows of the reactionaries against American democ-
racy in general. Negro rights are just as vital as trade union
rights, and they must be no less militantly defendedby the
entire labor movement. V

LABOR CANNOT RELY ON THE TWO OLD PARTIES

_ In addition to uniting the labor movement, to putting a stop
to suicidal red~baiting, to developing a democratic peace
policy, and to defending the rights of the harrassed Negro
people, as indicated above, there are many other steps labor
must take to modernize itself, to develop its full ﬁghting force,
and equip itself to defeat the fascist—like attacks being de-
livered against .it by the powerful Wall Street capitalists.
Among them these steps may be mentioned: (1) the develop-
ment of a broad economic program, conceived in the interest
of the whole American people and covering such matters as
wages, prices, taxes, foreign loans, government expenditures,
etc., a program which would lend great strength to organized
labor’s position in the nation; (2) the building of a strong

trade union youth movement;  the development of a broad ,

organization of women workers; (4) a drastic betterment of
the trade union press, radio, and general educational activities;
and  n1ost important of all, the abandonment of the prac-
tice of parrot-like repetition of the capitalist free—enterprise
slogans of the N.A.M. Organized lab-or must begin to think for
itself, which can only be in a Marxian sense.
10

‘J4.-M

Finally, there is one more very vital need of organized labor,
and without it no effective ﬁght against reaction and fascism is
possible in the United States. This is that the workers and
their allies must stop trailing along after the Democratic and
Republican Parties and go into politics on their own. The
time is now ‘more than ripe for the workers, together with the
farmers, Negroes, veterans, intellectuals, youth, small business-
men and other democratic forces, to cut loose from the. paralyz-
ing inﬂuence of the two old parties of Wall Street and to
launch a great new anti-fascist party.

It made sense for the workers to support the Democratic
Party during the R_oosevelt regime; for Roosevelt was a pro-
gressive, and the workers made many important gains under his
long Presidency. They vastly strengthened their trade unions
and won much favorable legislation; the Negro people secured
many concessions; and the American people, with our Russian
and British allies, fought a successful war against fascism. But
this is now all water over the dam. The Democratic Party no

longer is playing a progressive role. It is dominated by Wall

Street and is faithfully doing'its bidding. The Democratic
Party is supporting\Wall Street’s Republican warlike bi-
partisan policy of imperialism abroad and its reactionary pro-

gram in this country. The anti—progressive character of the’

Democratic Party was clearly exposed when a majority of its
members in Congress voted for the Taft-Hartley slave labor
bill, which was the project of the National Association of
Manufacturers. It will be disastrous if the workers continue
to support this employer-controlled Party.

President Truman is not President Roosevelt. He should not
be supporte'd by labor. Truman is a reactionary, and has be-
trayed every progressive policy that Roosevelt stood for. He is
one of the most blatant imperialist jingoes in this country. His
so-called Truman doctrine, now dolled up as the Marshall

i plan, is a war policy and a menace to world peace and democ-

racy. Truman is trying to militarize our country and is other-

wise playing the game of Wall Street. But he is clever enough

to cover up his reactionary course by pretensesthat he is fol-

lowing the progressive Roosevelt line. ’
11

 

 
 

TRUMAN HELPING PUT oven WALL smears PROGRAM 

President ‘Truman was largely responsible for the passage 

of the fascist—like TaftéHart1ey slave labor bill. He helped 9 

to prepare the ground for it‘ by creating, anti-union senti-

ment in the country, by ruthlessly smashing the national V I 

strikes of the coal miners and railroad workers, and by

clamoring for Congressional legislation to curb the labor '  3' 
unions. Hecould have defeated the Taft-Hartley bill had I 
he utilizedihis leadership to mobilize the Democrats in Con- ‘  I I I

gress to vote against it. But he did not'do this. Instead he
worked both ends against the middle. He played up to the
employers by letting the bill go through, and heifooled many
gullible labor men by his formal veto of the bill. Roosevelt's

former Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, correctly

exposed the tricky Truman policy, in the New" York Post of
lune 30: I

“The evidence is clear that President Truman wanted

 

, to have a chance to veto the Taft-Hartley bill, but he also    I
wanted the bill passed over his veto. The Democrats might.

have made the veto stick if they had really tried. In other

words, the Administration was playing politics instead of

ﬁghting for labor.”

*3

The Democratic Party reactionaries are grooming)Truman * L 
for their Presidential candidate for 1948, ﬁguring that with V '

his phony veto of the Taft-Hartley bill he has gotten the
workers’ votes in the bag. But organized labor should serve
notice upon the Democratic king-makers that under no cir-
cumstances will the workers accept Truman as their candia
date. In the most "emphatic manner they should demand
that the Democratic Party nominates an acceptable progres-
sive, under the threat that otherwise they will put their

own candidate in the ﬁeld. A choice beween a Democratic

Truman and a Republican Dewey would be only a choice

between a slower or a faster march toward reaction and ,_

fascism.

In, any event, whether the Democratic Party nominates  «D
progressive candidate or not, the workers and other demo-T we

12

 
 

  

yycraticcforces should begin at once to build a broad new ;

L» people’s party in this country. It would be supreme folly for
"the workers to further follow the Wall Street-controlled

, Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is no barrier against -

y the dangerous fascism that is now beginning to sprout in our
country, nor is President Truman. Quite the reverse, they

are helping the growth of these fascist tendencies by confus-

i ifngthe workers and by demoralizing their ﬁght against their

 

real enemies-the trusts and corporations. The workers and
their leaders, in this very decisive moment in our national
history, must not pin their hopes on a reactionary Truman

and his likes. That is just another way of breaking down the
’ people’s resistance to fascism in the United States.

After World War I, fromgigig to 1922, the trade unions in

i this country were subjected to a tremendous attack by the

powerful trusts. This big assault could have been repelled

, had the conservative trade union leadership boldly united
W the ranks of labor and led the workers in an all—out defense.

  

But these things were not done. Each national trade union
made its separate ﬁght against the united enemy, with the
result that the unions one after another suffered catastrophic
defeats. Great strikes were provoked by wage cuts and then
broken by the bosses’ in nearly every industry. Consequently,
the labor movement lost about one-third of its total member-

ship and was sorely weakened on all fronts. Asa result or-

ganized. labor sank into a dozen years of the greatest decline
in strength and ﬁghting spirit since the days of its inception.

.. Nor was it able to recover until the Roosevelt regime, in the

 

middlethirties, made it possible to gain lost ground. This

L whole disaster could have been avoided had the labor lead-
' ership realized the danger and taken the very obvious pre-

cautions against it.

UNITED LABOR CAN DEFEAT THE FASCIST DANGER

‘Now, after-World War II, organized labor is once more

a  -. facing a great offensive of the Wall Street capitalists. Clearly
 , this time the threat, that of a possible eventual fascism, is even

  

 i more dangerous than that we faced after World War I. Dur-

13 f ,-

O

 

 

ing the paxst twenty years humanity -has learned to its cost
what an unbounded tragedy fascism is. Yet this is the mon-
strous thing that now is beginning to menace this country.
Monopoly capitalist reaction in these years tends toward
fascist developments, and we must be wide awake to them in
our country. » ‘

Already by the Republican victory in the elections of 1946
and by the passage of the infamous Taft-Hartley bill, the
workers have suffered two heavy and needless defeats. Even as
after World War I, these defeats could have been avoided
by the adoption of a few common sense measures to unitethe
workers’ forces. And how will it be from here on in? Will
the leaders of labor doas they did after World War I—that
is, cling to their ineffective policies and allow the workers to
suffer fresh and even more disastrous defeats? Will they, by;
their neglect to adopt the vital measures recited above, risk
victory by the Republicans and Tory Democratic reactionaries
in 1948 and gradually to drag our countryiinto the fatal
swamps of fascisrn and war? Or willthey, learning from the
costly experiences of the past, realize the danger of fascist
reaction, take the vigorous necessary steps to counteract it,
and lead ‘the workers to new victories? .

The responsibilities of the leaders of the A. F. of L., C.I.O.
and Railroad Brotherhoods are now indeed heavy ones. These
leaders, in order to meet the existing dangerous situation, have
to realize the central fact that, to insure victory, their present
policies must be drastically overhauled and improved. The
workers and their allies are potentially very powerful, far
more powerful than the capitalists. Properly led, they can
defeat the reactionary aims of Wall Street, they can wipe the
Taft-Hartley law from the statute books, they can utterly
destroy budding fascism in this country, they can preserve
world peace. ‘

The workers and their allies‘ are in a mood to ﬁght. Many
signs indicate this, including the tremendous strike move-
ment of the post—war period, the far—reaching and spontaneous
hostility to universal military training and other measures

‘to militarize the country, the condemnation far and wide of ,

the warlike Truman doctrine, the widespread mass resistance
14

 

 

’_to the Taft-Hartley bill, extensive political activities of the
Negroes in both the North and South, many progressive de-

velopments among the farmers, and the spectacular growth
of the Wallace-for—President movement. These developments
are signs of a profound democratic sentiment among the peo-
ple. The workers and their allies can win the victory over
Wall Street if given even a measure of sound leadership. But
to beat fascist—minded reaction in the United States will take
a real ﬁght. It is a ﬁght that requires militant leadership
and . progressive policies.

Several months ago the Communist Party, warning of the

need to unite the labor movement in order to beat back the
legislative attacks in Congress, put out the slogan “United

Labor Action—or Else.” The leaders of labor ignored this
timely warningfand did not develop united labor action.
Consequently, the workers got the “or else”—that is, the Taft-
Hartley slave labor law. Now the workers face an even more

-urgent “or else” alternative. They must either promptly de-

velop effective ﬁghting policies, or they will face something
far worse than the_Taft-Hartley law, namely, a ‘dangerous
growth of the fascist an.d war threats in the United States.

Fascism is a menace that can be neglected only at the work-
ers’ grave peril. Hence the workers should see to it that their
leaders take the indicated necessary steps to crush the danger
in the bud. With a united labor movement and progressive
policies, the ﬁght against developing fascism in the United
States must be pushed intel‘ligently, unceasingly, and with all
the strength possessed by the trade union movement and its
allies. If this is done, victory will be won by the workers and
their democratic allies, and the United States will swiftly pass
on to higher levels of democracy, prosperity and friendly in-
ternational collaboration than it has ever known.

ORGANIZED LABOR AND
THE FASGIST. DANGER

BY WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

ECENTLY, while fighting against the passage by Congress
of the infamous Taft-Hartley slave labor bill, William
Green and Philip Murray, Presidents of the A. F. of L. and
C.I.O. respectively, warned the workers and the nation that the

= enactment of this reactionary bill would constitute a long step
toward the establishment of fascism in the United States. .

These were indeed signiﬁcant and startling statements, for
Green and Murray are not men given to making such charac-
terizations lightly. Their warnings about the fascist.core of the
Taft-Hartley bill _were re-echoed by sober-thinking men and
women all over the United States. '
Green and Murray were correct in signalizing the fascist con-
tent of the Taft—Hartley bill, which has since become the law
of the land. We can already see that the workers are not going
to take this law lying down. Even President Truman says the

 

law is “unworkable,” and it is certain that the workers will not 7
tamely allow it to strip them of hard-won rights; For this out-_

frageous law attempts to rob the trade unions of not only vital
legislative gains made during the Roosevelt regime, but also

. of civil rights they have possessed for generations.-The closed
shop, for example, which the law abolishes, dates back 150

years. Likewise, from time immemorial the unions have
exercised political rights now taken from them by the new law.
Congress had outlawed strike-breaking injunctions many years

-ago with the Norris-LaGuardia Act, but the Taft—Hartley law
- now re-establishes this outrageous abuse.

The new law especially deals a heavy blow at the independ-

ence of the trade unions, by putting them directly under the
A "control of the reactionary government. The Taft—Hart1ey Act
is far more than a, government strike—breaking law, it is a big

 

stride toward the degeneration of the trade unions into state-

. 3

 

controlled organizations, which is always a decisive feature of
fascism. The drafters of the Taft-Hartley law, both notorious

tools of big business, are seeking to transform the free trade A‘
unions of the United States into slave labor organizations of

the Hitler and Mussolini type.

As Mr. Green and Mr. Murray stated, the enactment of the
Taft-Hartley law is indeed a long step toward fascism. The
law’s sinister signiﬁcance is emphasized all the more by the

_ many other fascist-like developments that have been taking .
place in our country since the end of the war. Among these are . ‘

the passage of reactionarylaws curtailing civil rights in many
State legislatures, the outrageous lynching attacks upon the

Negro people, the widespread growth of anti-Semitism, the l I

many attempts to outlaw the Communist Party, the wild orgy
of Red-baiting that is going on, the jingoistic campaign of
militarism and anti-Soviet‘ war-mongering now raging in the

press and radio. Then there are the fascist activities of the .

House Committee on Un—American Activities. Even Hitler
himself might well have envied this brazen institution, which

is busily cultivating and organizing fascism in the United‘

States. One of the most outrageous actions of this Committee
is its present attempt to railroad to jail Gene Dennis, General
Secretary of the Communist Party‘.

All -these reactionary developments, taken together, un-

doubtedly constitute a developing fascist danger in this coun-
try. This reactionary trend was spurred on by the Republican
election victory in 1946. It was further strengthened by the
steady abandonment of the Roosevelt program by President

Truman. It was also given agreat impetus by the enactment of '

the ultra-reactionary Taft-Hartley slave labor bill. And if the
Republicans should win the Presidency and control of Con-

gress, in the 1948 elections, then the fascist danger would be-i

come a real menace in the United States.

SOURCE OF FASCIST DANGER lN  r

The source of this fascist danger is the big trusts and

monopolies which dominate the United States economically 1

and politically. Those Wall Street combinations of ﬁnance
4 .

 

 

_ L _ _  capital want a fascist-like regime in the United States so that
— 7;’ ‘ they can weaken or destroy the labor movement and thus
 A A .,;frender the working class‘ powerless, so they can still further in-
, crease their gigantic proﬁts at the expense of American mass
living standards, so they can thrust upon the /toilers the
‘burdens of the approaching economic crisis, and so they can
militarize our country in preparation for an anti-Soviet war.
.. Especially, the big capitalists want fascist-like reaction in this
country so they can the better carry out their present warlike
plans to establish Wall Street’s imperialist domination over
the war-ravaged world. The program of fascist reaction at
home is the other side of m'onopoly’s policy of imperialism
and military aggression abroad. The Taft-Hartley slave labor
law and the Marshall Plan are twin policies of big capital.

If there is a rising fascist and war danger in the United
States, and this is most certainly the case, then, indeed, or-
ganized labor and every democratic force in our country must
adopt as its ﬁrst order of business the task of combatting and
defeating this deadly peril. For the history of a dozen countries
that were overwhelmed by fascism fairly shouts to us the
urgent necessity of the workers and their allies to proceed with-
out delay against the serious danger. Fascism, even in its
infancy, cannot be triﬂed with. Especially not when it has be-

 

-less capitalist class in theyworld.
We must be doubly on guard against American reaction and
fascism, because it is springing up under insidious forms, not
at all in the pattern of European fascism. For one thing, all
sorts of American-type fascists are operating under the mask of
a- defense of democracy. Already we see such reactionary-
minded men as ex-President Hoover and many others hypo-
gcritically parading about as ardent champions of democracy

American fascism, unlike the war-glorifying type of Hitler and
Mussolini, ﬁnds a protecting shield under the slick pretext of
defending the peace of the world. American imperialism’s

_ ,,drive to conquer the world, even at the cost of another great
4 war, is thus characteristically obscured under the pretense of
A  the, United States having a moral obligation to lead the world

hind it large sections of the most powerful, militant and ruth-

and as enemies of what they call “totalitarianism.” Als0,,

out of the postwar crisis. Moreover, American fascism, when
it takes on 'more concrete forms, also will not indulge in the
elaborate theorizing of European fascism, about the failure of

« bourgeois-democracy, about the glories of a totalitarian state,

and about the leading role of the fascist elite. Its theories of
the .“supe-riority” of the Anglo-Saxon master race will also take
on new and insidious forms. Realizing that the democratic-
minded American people are on the alert against the obviously
fascist doctrines, the reactionaries in this country who are
really dangerous, not the lunatic fringe which stupidly apes
Hitlerism, will carefully avoid all deﬁnitely labelle_d fascist
conceptions. The wealthy monopolist rulers of this country
will, in the main, try to cultivate their fascist trends, their
rigid dictatorship of imperialist ﬁnance capital, and their war
preparations, under cover of slogans apparently in line with
American democratic traditions. This makes it all the more
needfulx tosingle out and ﬁght every fascist trend, however
subtle.

ALL-INCLUSIVE UNITY NEEDED

This is the time when, under the possibility of the direst
consequences, all the democratic forces of the United States
must unite their strength in a joint struggle against the ,com-
mon danger, the incipient fascism which Murray and Green
spoke about. Quarrels and feuds and differences that have split
the forces of democracy, especially since Roosevelt’s ‘death,
must be bridged over, no matter how important otherwise they
may seem to be, or else the fascist—like trends in the country’
that are now cropping up vigorously will get such a head start
that it will become impossible to eradicate them later on.
Especially necessary» is an all—inclusive unity of the anti—fascist
forces—worl<ers, farmers, Negroes, veterans, women, youth,
intellectuals, small businessmen, etc.—an alliance which is in-
dispensable to defeat the Republican Party and its reactionary
Democratic allies in the Presidential elections of 1948. Anti-
fascist slogans must be raised in the coming elections. Under,
no circumstances can the party of Hoover, Dewey, Vanden-

V berg, McCormick, Pew and Patterson, the chief carrier of ultra-

6

V

reactionary and fascist tendencies in-the United States, be al-
lowed to win the national elections. ~
VVith reaction on the offensive and showing fascist tenden-
cics, organized labor, which is the heart of the anti-fascist
democratic coalition, must drastically improve its organization
and its ﬁghting tactics. Although with the present set-up and
methods it was possible to advance the workers’ interests
moderately under the‘ friendly Roosevelt regime, they are alto-

gether inadequate now, when the unions face such a ruthless‘

combination of capital as is at present on the rampage in the
United States. Proof of this is shown by the fact that organized
labor and its allies, unable to unite the tremendous democratic

_strength of the American people, did not prevent the Republi-

can electoral victory in 1946, nor did they block the passage of
the fascist—like Taft—Hartley bill. In both instances labor and
its allies easily had the potential strength to win the victory if
they had but organized it. It may also be predicted that unless
the cooperation and ﬁghting methods of the two national
federations of labor are soon radically bettered, the workers
run serious risk of a reactionary Republican victory in the 1948
elections. To go along as American labor is now doing, devel-
oping only a fraction of its strength, is to invite certain politi-
cal disaster. No effective ﬁght can be made against budding

fascism unless the labor movement wakes up to the grave.

dangers it is now confronting and drastically revamps its or-
ganization and methods of struggle.

FIRST AND FOREMOST—LABOR UNITY

Most urgent of all in checking the fascist danger, organized
labor must unite its own divided ranks. It would be criminal
stupidity to continue to keep the workers split into two
separate non-cooperative national federations in the face of
the present offensive of the big Wall Street capitalists. There
can be little doubt but that if the A. F. of ‘L. had accepted the
C.I.O.’s proposal of about a year ago for joint action against
the Taft-Hartley bill, and if the two federations had ‘made any-
thing like an all-out ﬁght together, this pernicious legislation
could have been defeated, especially in View of the narrow

)-

L_1Jll’Q1£.‘._.w..'..‘1.’_Z;—.:L...x.‘.42-.1..Lv.. .::_; ~

margin of victory of the reactionaries in the Senate. The

dangerous political situation in the United States, therefore,   S’

imperatively demands that the A. F. of L., C.I.O. and Railroad
‘Brotherhoods join hands nationally for united labor action in

the ﬁght against organized reaction. Thisshould, be a pre-  _
liminary step toward the early establishment of all-around .

organic labor unity. Failure promptly to achieve united labor
action means to gamble recklessly with the life of the labor
movement and the future of American democracy. The present
needless split in labor’s ranks has already cost the labor move-
ment very dearly; it must be ended. at once.

Another great weakness of organized labor that must becured

is the practice of Red-baiting which is now so widely prevalent,
in official trade union circles. Red-baiting is the weapon of big

business, of Wall. Street, of developing American fascism. It is

.taken straight from the arsenal of the late unlamented Hitler.

By spreading a thousand fantastic lies about the Communists,
the reagtionaries and their Red—baiting labor dupes build up
a false Red bogy by which they frighten the people and distract
their attention from their real enemy——big business. This
enable-s the latter to put across its reactionary program with a
minimum of democratic resistance. Red—baiting is the fascist
technique for’confusing, dividing and enslaving the people.
Characteristically, Wall Street railroaded its infamous Taft-
Hartley bill through Congress under cover of the worst cam-
paign of Red—baiting in our nation’s history. Fascism lives and
grows o-n Red—baiting. Red-baiters in the labor movement do
not and cannot ﬁght fascism. On the contrary, they feed and

cultivate fascism, for they are'using its main weapon. The i

very purpose of Red-baiting is to hide the fascistdanger and

thus to make it easier for it to grow. Those labor leaders who ,
are such eager Red-baiters are either consciously or uncon- r

sciously doing the work of Wall Street. They are weakening
the trade unions and cutting the heart out of the workers’

resistance to the reactionary danger. Also, they are sharpening
the fascist axe for their own political necks. Henry Wallace is ~

doing a major service to organized labor and the American‘

people by his warnings against the deadly disease of Red-  

baiting.

THE WAR DANGER ’

  A further element sapping thestrength of the trade union.

rirovement and laying it wide open to Wall Street's attacks is
the foolish support that trade union leaders are giving to Presi-
dent’s-Truman’s foreign policy. For it is as plain as the nose on
one’s face that the Administration’s so-called bi-partisan for-
eign policy is the policy of the Republican Party, of Wall

i Street, of the worst enemies of labor and the American nation.

 

It is a war policy of imperialist world conquest and it violates
ﬂagrantly the national interest of our people.

 

It is adangerous fact that Wall Street and the Truman . A

Administration are actively preparing for war against the
U.S.S.R. This is the meaning of the huge military budget of
the government, the piling up of atomic bombs, the use of

A “dollar diplomacy” all over the world, the wild campaign of

war mongering in this country.

’Wall Street, in its aggressive offensive, has a two-sided pro-
gram. One side is imperialist expansion, “dollar diplomacy”
abroad, and the other is fascist-like reaction at home. The
foreign phase of this twin policy of reaction is the drive to con-
quer the world, the so-called bi-partisan policy. This is the
Truman doctrine which, in its more complete form, is the
so-called Marshall plan. This world policy has as its reverse
phase a reactionary regime here in the United States. It is im-
possible for organized labor to defeat the fascist—like domestic
side of Wall Street’s program while accepting its foreign side-
the warlike offensive to establish world mastery. If it supports

Wall Street's imperialism, organized labor would be half ‘

licked at the start in its efforts to protect democracy and Ameri-
can living standards, and to preserve world peace. The workers
cannot defeat reaction at home if they support imperialism

abroad. It is imperative, therefore, that the trade union leader-«
; ship stop tagging along after Wall Street's phony bi-partisan
/ imperialist war policy and develop a people's program of
.world peace and international collaboration. This is a histori-

cal “must” which, at its peril, organized labor dare not ignore.
Another grave weakness in the ﬁght against reaction and

if 7  fascism is the casual attitude with which organized labor looks
