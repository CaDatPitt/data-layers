FOREWORD

The south looms increasingly large in the economic and political life of

our country: The Negro people's movement is pressing hard for has gains;
especially for the abolition of segregated schools and the right to vote: and
the growth or industry in expanding the soothers proletariat and trade ﬁhibn
organization. At the same time there is an upsurge of terrorist attacks against
the Negro people and their allies: "right to work" laws and run-away shops area
undermining the security of all labor; and the Dixiecrats have re—emerged to
leadership in congress. These and many related developments underscore the
growing_importance of the Southern front in the nation's fight for democracy,
peace and economic security. .

It is customary to think of the South as a major reserve of imperialist
reaction -— which, indeed, it is; but thislis only one side of the picture.‘
Even more important is the fact that the South can become, ‘and even now is
developing in the direction of; a major reserve of the democratic forces of
our country. An urgent task now confronting all Americans who cherish the
goals of'jobs, democracy, equal rights and peace is to support and strengthen
the emerging forces of progress in the .South.

V This is why, on the occasion of Negro History week — 1955, the Jefferson
School of Social Science here reproduces James E, Jacksonis highly perceptive '
analysis of the developing interrelations of the labor movement, the Negro:
liberation movement and the agrarian movement in the south and their impact on
the economic and political life of our country as a whole. ‘

‘By Jim Jackson

. The South is an economically retarded, mainly agricultural region in
the United States. comparatively retarded technically, the South is relieved

‘by scattered areas of industrialization centered upon the extraction of the

natural resources - oil, coal, ore, timber, cotton products, etc. These are
almost completely in the hands of monopoly absentee ownership. Industrial dev-
elopment, and consequently the workers, of the South are centered in a few
cities. These are, outstandingly, Birmingham, New Orleans, winston—Salem,
Chattanooga and Memphis. “

It is the south that holds the prison-house of the oppressed Negro
nation - an enslaved people whom the ruling class strives to whip and starve
into abject, eternal submission. The South is that region where the elementary
rights of the people have long been, and are now more than ever, ground into the
earth by a tiny group of white hirelings of the landlord~banker-industrialist
interests. '

Here the pro-fascist forces have attained a certain mass base, and
hold considerable political power on local and state levels. Here the outright
fascist forces have acquired form in the Dixiecrat Party and the Ku Klux Klan.

The South is the incubator and exporter of white chauvinism, cultural
obscurantism and a variety of reactionary ideologies. The powers that be util-
ize these ideologies in every part of the United States to persecute and exploit
the Negro people, to divide the ranks of the working class, and to isolate the

' working class from its strategic ally - the oppressed Negro people.

To observe the South today is to have a preview, as it were, of the
kind of "way of life" which Wall Street and its minions in the government are,
striving to impose upon the American people and the peoples of the world. As
the prominent Negro sociologist, 0.0. Cox, observes in his noteworthy book,

»"Caste, Class and Race":

"Probably in no country of the world are the philosophies and
practices of racial mastery so openly and tenaciously held as
in the South. In this case the South is not a backwood coun-
try of the United States; it is, in fact, to a very considerable
extentl_at the very head of the diplomatic and political destiny

‘jut.

of the nation.’§‘ (Emphasis mine - J.J.)

The heavy reactionary influence of the South on the political life
and future of the nation as a whole is instantly suggested by the following
isolated facts:

From the 13 Southern States, with a combined total voting electorate
of Just a half million more than New York State alone, the South has 122 Con-
gressmen and 26 Senators in the United States Congress. "whatis more, these
plantation-Democrats are Chairmen of 11 of the 19 standing House Committees
and 8 of the 15 standing Senate Committees." *** ' .

Southerners dominate the field and higher command posts of the Armed
Forces.

One could prepare an almost endless bill of particulars to document
the charge that the South exercises a reactionary and oppressive influence upon
all areas of the political, economic, social and cultural life of the United
States. But the truth of this is well known and needs no elaboration here.

What needs to be understood throughout this report is not the reac-
tionary weight of the South on American life, but the too poorly appreciated
fact that the South is that region of the United States where the most powerful
revolutionary pressures may develop. For here the class contradictions merge
with the liberation struggle of the subject Negro nation in the Black Belt.
The Southern region of this, the richest, most powerful imperialist country in
the world, is an economic, political and cultural hinterland. It 81VeS rise
to powerful interconnected potentially revolutionary forces, namely: the Ne8P°
national liberation movement and the agrarian movement, which constitute a
mighty Supporting force of the American working class and an organic Part Of
the progressive movement in the country as a whole. correspondingly, every
advance of the working-class and popular democratic forces of the country as a
whole facilitates the democratic advance of the Southern masses.

our attitude toward the South is in a very practical sense a measure
of the maturity of the Communist Party. The special features of the South -
the peculiar interlinking of the national question and the struggle for social-
ism - pose for the Party complicated problems which will test to the utmost our
ability to apply Marxism-Leninism creatively and concretely, to translate basic
principles into correct tactics, and to find the organizational forms for their
practical application. Our attitude toward the South is also a basic test of
the maturity of the Party, in that our maturity will be measured by the extent
to which we express,- in practice,our understanding of the significance of the
South for the struggles of the working class in the whole country, namely: for
the people's fight for peace and in defense of their liberties now under assault
by reactionis drive toward fascism, for the struggle against the developing eco-
nomic crisis and its consequences to the people, for the frustration of Wall
Street's bipartisan imperialist program of world domination, for the emancipa-
tion of the Negro nation, and for opening the way toward the struggle for soci-
alism.

If we emphasize this point so sharply it is because too often, among
progressives generally and even in the ranks of the Communist Party, there is
a tendency to view the South merely as a reactionary drag, economically, poli-
tically, and socially, upon the country as a whole. It is true that the South
is a retarded, backward section of the land; that the Negro nation in the Black
Belt, because of its oppressed status, has some of the characteristics of a
colonial country. But it must be emphasized that the social effects of this
condition sharpen the forms of struggle against Southern slave-master landlord-
ism and monopoly capital. Above all, up from the backward South, there is grow-
ing in consciousness a potentially powerful democratic and revolutionary force,
the oppressed and imprisoned Negro nation, which is fighting, and will fight,
on a scale as yet unimagined, for its liberation from the imperialist bondage
of Wall Street—Dixiecrat slavemasters.

IRON LID OF GOVERNMNTAL VIOLENCE

The capitalist ruling class has always been conscious of its special
vulnerability in the South, of what a tremendously powerful potential reserve
for democracy and socialism exists there. Hence, the constant alertness of wall
Street - and of both of its parties, the Democratic and the Republican - openly
to use the state apparatus to crush and stifle by every available means the

-2-

 

freedom aspirations and movement of the Negro masses, and to strive to prevent
any linking.in common action of the Southern Negro and white toiling masses.

This becomes immediately evident in even a cursory examination of the
functioning of the state apparatus in the South.

Notwithstanding even the limited bourgeois-democratic patterns set forth
in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, which endeavor to define in a general
way the methods by which the bourgeoisie might exercise its class rule, we know
that the capitalist class in our country, both historically and at the present
time, utilizes varying methods of rule to maintain its class domination over the
economic and political life of the country. All of these methods of rule are"
indispensible to the bourgeoisie in order to maintain its class domination. They
have their expression in the uneven reflection of the meager democratic rights
possessed by the people from one State to another. In the name of "State’s Rights"
a variety of methods of rule on the part of state and local government has devel-
oped within the United States. But in the South, state, county and municipal
government seem to have no recognizable relationship even to the limited bour-
geois-democratic methods of rule of the financial oligarchy over the rest of the
United States. Southern state and local governments are thoroughly anti-popular.
capitalist-landlord dictatorships imposing their will upon the people through the
terroristic enforcement of fascist—like laws which countermand and negate most of
the limited rights proclaimed by the U.S. Constitution. Amrican imperialism
maintains its class rule in the South through state governments which in their
essence are police-state in character, which bear down upon the democratic aspira-
tions, lives and liberties of the masses like an iron lid.

In the South the imperialist ruling class has long since resorted to
extreme measures of police-state-like repressions of popular liberties - lynching,
disenfranchisement, terror, etc. - in order to sustain its class domination.

The extreme measures of anti-democratic absolutism to which the Southern oligarchy
resorts are in themselves an indication of the potential power of the revolution-
ary currents there at work. It is to an analysis of the nature and significance
of these revolutionary tendencies in the South that the balance of this report
will be devoted.

-X’ -1* -I ‘I

within the South today, three revolutionary tendencies operate, which
are:

I. The proletarian class struggle, expressed in the existence of a
trade-union movement, embracing Negro and white workers, in sharpening work1ﬂ8-
class resistance, and in the existence in the South of a regional organization
of the Communist Party, vanguard of the working class, the class which must his-
torically move to exercise leadership in the struggle of all the oppressed. This
special responsibility of the Southern workers - Negro and white - can of course
be fulfilled only in inseparable connection with, and as a specialized component
of, the American working class in the realization of this historic class destiny.

II. The struggle of the subject Negro nation in the Black Belt of the
South for national liberation.

III. The struggle for the completion of the long retarded and frustrated
agrarian revolution in the Black Belt, and for reforms in landlord-tenant rela-
tions, for the division of the monopolized land, and for the wiping out of the
feudal-slave remnants of agrarian economy in the South as a whole.

The further unfolding of the Negro national liberation struggle in the

-3-

Black Belt and the struggle for radical agrarian refor for the South as a whole,
is a prime responsibility of the working class and its vanguard Party. These are
two sectors of the war on the “Southern front" that the working class leads and
unites with the class struggle against capitalism and in coalition with all demo-
cratic forces against the imperialist ruling class for the defense and advancement
of democracy, against fascist reaction and the war danger, and the speeding Of the
creation of the conditions for the advance toward Socialism.

Let us examine separately these potentially powerful revolutionary
tendencies which constitute the principal driving forces in the South on the
side of progress.

I. TH LEADING ROLE OF SOUTHERN WORKERS

The proletariat, historically destined to abolish capitalism and estab-
lish Socialism, is the most decisive revolutionary force; it plays the leading
role in the national liberation movement and in the agrarian revolution. The
Southern workers suffer from the effects of the special oppression of the Negro
people. They are subjected to lower wage differentials, inferior health and edu~
cational facilities, and cultural degradation. The Southern workers on the whole
come directly from the poor farmers and sharecroppers and are closely bound up
with the toiling population of the land. This fact serves as the basis for facie
litating the development of the organized struggle on the countryside and the
establishment by the working class of its leadership in the struggle of the rural
masses against their Bourbon-landlord oppression and wall Street domination.

Negro workers in the South suffer from super—exp1oitation similar in
certain respects to that of workers in the colonies. Their wage scales are lower,
their hours longer, their working conditions poorer. They are subjected to Jim-
Crow and lynching and are denied elementary human rights. But the ruling oligar-
chy disfranchises the overwhelming majority of white workers along with the Negro

people, curtails the workers! right to organize, strike, etc. Few Southern states

have any decent legislation to protect the rights of labor, to prohibit child
labor or to provide for the rights of women workers. Te struggle of the workers
to secure their livelihood and better their working conditions face local and

istate political regimes which are especially oppressive and brutally anti-labor.

The labor movement as a whole must do everything to aid the unfolding
economic struggles of the Southern workers against speed-up, wage differentials,
health and safety hazards, etc.,and for adequate state unemployment benefits,
F.E.P.C.. and revocation of garnishee laws. we must not content ourselves with
moralizing at the white textile workers, for example, about the backwardness of

their leadership in "preserving" their industry for white workers only. But rather

we must help them develop their economic battles with the textile barons and in
the course of these struggles on issues that they can see now, expose the unten-
ability of their white chauvinist anti-working class attitudes toward their Negro
class brothers. Here it should be noted what is sometimes overlooked, namely
that notwithstanding the fact that their c1ass—consciousness is retarded by the
ruling—class poison of white chauvinism, the Southern white workers have shown
in practice that they are militant fighters on economic issues.

we must do all we can to stimulate and where necessary initiate the
organization of the unorganized workers, including the domestic workers.

Above all, we must participate in, and give special practical detailed
service to, all aspects of the struggles of the white trade unionists, that we
may more rapidly learn how to combat effectively their white supremacy prejudices.
we must elevate the class consciousness of the Southern worker to an appreciation

-h-

on their part, not only of the need for interracial trade-union solidarity, but
also of the historic responsibility of the working class to give leadership in
the struggle of all the oppressed masses for liberation from the tyranny and
exploitation of the rule or the men of the trusts and the landlords.

II. THE NEGRO NATIONS STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION

whe struggle of the Negro people. in the contiguous area of the South
where they are a majority of the population, is the struggle of an oppressed and
enslaved nation for freedom from all forms of national oppression, for political
rights to secure and safeguard their interests (present and future), for the
right of self-determination. This struggle of the oppressed Negro nation is not
expressed today directly in the demand for its basic right to full national in-
dependence. It is expressed today in the time-honored slogan "For equal rights."
The full implications of this slogan, raised on the banners of all oppressed
nations, are thus summed up by Lenin: "Yes....equa1ity in everything including
state construction, experience in constructing ‘their own state.1" * The summons
of Karl Marx 80 years ago to the working class of England to make the cause of
Irish national liberation its own fight - in its own interest - holds a timely
lesson for the American working class with regards to its responsibility to the
struggle of the oppressed Negro nation for liberation.

Marx put the question pointedly in the following passages that Lenin
singled out for special emphasis: '

"The English working class will never accomlish anything before it
has got rid of Ireland....English reaction in England had its roots ..... in the
subjugation of Ireland." **

"Irish history shows one how disastrous it is for a nation, when it
has subjugaced another nation. All the abominations of the English have their
origin in the Irish Pale."***

And here is an estimate by Lenin of the importance of this question:

“The important thing is not the question as to whether one—fiftieth of
one-hundredth part of the small nations will be liberated before the socialist
revolution, but the fact that in the epoch of imperialism, owing to objective
causes,_the proletariat has been split up into two international camps, one of
which is corrupted by the crumbs which fall from the table of the bourgeoisie
of the Great Powers - obtained, among other sources, from the two~fold or three-
fold exploitation of small nations — while the other cannot free itself without
freeing the small nations, without educating the masses in an anti-chauvinist.
i.e., anti-annexationist, i.e., "self-determinationist" spirit." ****

The long-brewing struggle of the oppressed Negro nation to break its
chains of bondage takes on a special significance at the moment; for, being
anti-imperialist in essence, it is directed against the oppressor of the Negro
people as,a whole, in the entire country. against wall Street, the organizer of
the fascist offensive and atomic war, and its reactionary class representatives
in the South.

The struggle of the Negro nation for freedom from all oppression, for
the right to exercise majority political power in government and decisive author-
ity over all public institutions in the Black Belt areas where they constitute

the majority of the population, is Joined on one issue or another, at one level
or another, by all classes among the Negro people. However, only a step—by-step
examination of the class forces of the Negro nation will enable us properly to
assess the role each of them can play in the national liberation struggle in the
Black Belt. It is thus that we can determine how best the working class can play
the role, which is its alone, of leading this struggle to victories on limited
issues at the present level of the struggle as well as for the full program in
the future.

THE NEGRO WORKERS

The Negro industrial workers, from the standpoint of class conscious-
ness, are the most mature component of the Southern workers. They have a double
hatred of the capitalist; as a direct exploiter of their own labor power and
also as the white oppressor of their people. While the counterparts of the
Townsends,Weavers, Randolphs and assorted lackeys of Murray, Green and Co., are
also to be found among Southern Negro trade—union leaders, the fact is that the
Negro worker has, in the main, been barred from the ranks of the "aristocracy
of labor,“ and has been denied promotions to the better—paying Jobs. For these
and other reasons, the Negro workers are more easily freed from reformist illu-
sions. Furthermore, within the ranks of organized labor the Negro worker has had
to wage an ¢ver—continuing battle for fair play and equality of relationships
against white trade—union leaders who in the main are at once labor reformists
and white chauvinists. His heroism on the picket lines and his stubborn, per-
sistent presentation of the fact that the self~interests of his white fellow-
workers dictate that they Join hands with him on all comon issues, have been a
powerful educational influence on the white workers in spite of all the propa-
ganda and punitively enforced Jim~Crow laws of the industrialist-Bourbons of the
South. The proof of this is the large number of unions embracing Negro and white
workers. Through the Negro workers the Negro liberation struggles are linked to
the class struggle of the proletariat. Furthermore, the class position of the
Negro workers enables them more readily to understand the limitations of Negro
bourgeois leadership, whose class interests supersede their Negro national loyal-
ties at each critical juncture in the national liberation struggle.

For these and other reasons, the Negro workers alone are capable of
providing consistent leadership to the Negro liberation movement.
THE NEGRO BOURGEOISIE

The necessity for the Negro workers to play the leading role in the
struggle for Negro liberation is not in contradiction to the fact that this
struggle embraces the interests and enjoys the active participation of all
classes of the Negro nation, including its bourgeoisie. The Southern Negro
bourgeoisie in the Black Belt has not exhausted its potential for playing a
progressive role in the struggle for Negro liberation. on the contrary, possi-
bilities continue for wide sections of that class to play a progressive role in
the future development of the national liberation movement.

The bourgeoisie of the oppressed Negro nation, because of its class
character and because of its special peculiarity as a "bourgeoisie within a
bourgeoisie,“ essentially fights for the status of "acceptance" and, broadly
speaking, integration in the camp of the dominant exploiting and oppressing
class. But it is precisely because the ruling class refuses it that status and
excludes it from any such integration, and because it shares the general oppres-
sion suffered by the other class forces of the Negro nation, that its progressive
potentialities are not exhausted. It must be stressed, however, that the role
which it will play cannot be blueprinted. This will depend upon the specific

-6-

objective conditions under which the national liberation movement develops, the
general course of the struggle for democracy and socialism in the country as a
Whole. and specifically and largely upon how actively and consistently the work-
ing class undertakes its full responsibility in mobilizing, stimulating and lead-
ing all of the class forces of the Negro nation.

is the struggle of the Negro masses for national liberation assumes

more and more revolutionary forms, the white ruling class will be forced to
execute diverse maneuvers to maintain its domination. It will increasingly use
the classic tactic of applauding, flattering, buying off and corrupting certain
prominent representatives of the Negro upper classes and use them to compromise
the mass struggle for liberation. The bourgeoisie, even of an oppressed nation,
abdures militant mass struggles and always seizes upon the first mean crumb of a
concession from the oppressor to desert the liberation struggle and to exert its
influence to demobilize it. Therefore, as a component of the national liberation
front it is tenuous, unstable, unreliable and limited.

Lenin dealt with this matter as follows:

"....for the imperialist bougeoisie is trying with all its might to
implant the reformist movement also among the oppressed nations. A certain
Papproﬁhement has been br0u8ht about between the bourgeoisie of the exploiting
countries and those of the colonial countries, so that very often even in the‘
majority of cases, perhaps, where the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries does
Support the national movement, it simultaneously works in harmony with the im-
Derialist bourgeoisie, 1.e., it Joins the latter in fighting against all revolu-

tionary movements and revolutionary classes." *
THE NEGRO RURAL MASSES

The main forces among the Negro majority in the Black Belt are the
urban proletariat and the rural poor. It is the agricultural workers, share-
0P°PDers. tenant farmers and small farmers, ground down by the plantation system
and monopolies, who, together with, and under the leadership of, the urban prol-
etariat, are the main army of the Negro nation in its struggle for liberation.
As Lem Harris outlined the position of these rural class forces:

"There is hunger for the land and a need for help in obtaining it, in
repairing the damaged soil, and in getting equipment to work it. Blocking such
changes is the planters! power to oppress the Negroes and, as a result, to en-
slave poor whites as well. ‘white supremacy! is the main foundation of plantation
rule....The fight for Negro rights is also the fight against the plantation, and’
conversely the weakening and final break-up of the plantation is essential to
Negro 11berat1on."¥¥*

The organized activation of the Negro rural masses of the Black Belt
in Particular (as in the South as a whole) in struggles for peace, democratic
rights, social security and land reform is mandatory for the further development
of the national liberation movement of the Negro people.

As a result of wall Streetis cold war boycott of trade with almost
half the world, serious reductions were ordered by the government in the acreage
allotted for cotton, tobacco, and sugar, the main staples of Southern agricultu-
ral production. This has resulted in a severe worsening of the already-impover-
ished condition of the tenant farmers and sharecroppers. It has resulted in an
increase of farm laborers and migrant workers, of unemployed and homeless rural
workers, and in an intensified rate of ruination of the rural poor. Here it might

* Lenin, Selected worwg, Vol. x, p.2u1
** Lem Harris, "ﬂfoward a Land Program for the South" Political Affairs, MaI'.19U-9

-7-

be noted that the numerical growth of the farm laborers - the mobile village
proletariat - is of greatest significance; for they constitute the link between
the urban proletariat and the sharecroppers, tenant farmers, etc.

The struggle of the Negro rural poor against imperialism is directed
on two fronts: first, for the possession of the land, for the fulfillment of the
goals of the agrarian revolution, and secondly, for liberation from their nation-
al oppression. Though opportunities for contact with their white brothers are
much more limited than in the case with the Negro workers in the cities and vil-
lages, the Negro and white rural poor are linked objectively in common struggle
for freedom from the bondage of the plantation system through the realization of
the agrarian revolution in the Black Belt of the South.

Apart from the progressive class forces we have discussed, the Negro
students and intellectuals in the South are a positive and important factor in
the national liberation movement. The ruling class is_sensitive to this. Through
restriction and control of the "foundations" and the meager funds "charitably"
allotted to Negro colleges by Wall Street, it strives to corrupt, bribe and sub-
due both teachers and students. But its design to make the Negro universities
centers for the production of Negro misleaders meets firm resistance.

URGENT NEEDS OF THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT

The program of the national liberation movement must reflect those is-
sues which are common to the oppressed Negro nation as a whole, at the same time
embodying the special progressive demands of each class component of the oppresseé
nation.

The primary task of the Communist Party in the South is to help in every
way to consolidate this front of national liberation and to lead it into ever
higher and more resolute stages of the anti-imperialist struggle. Specifically,
this means that:

1. We must greatly enlarge and strengthen our connections with, and
influence upon, the existing city, state and national organizations and influen-
tial individuals and institutions in Negro life.

2. We must do everything to extend the trade-union organizing activi-
ties among the unorganized Negro workers - men and women, in the small towns as
well as the big cities, in the service trades as well as the basic industries.

3. We must help further the speedy organization of Negro trade union-
ists (in the key cities of the South) into suitable.forms of associations, either
within existing Labor Committees of the N.A.A.C.P. or in special local Negro lab-
or councils. This is necessary to strengthen the fight of Negroes for jobs, to
secure and improve the status of the Negro workers within the trade union move-
ment, and to mobilize, train, and deploy Negro trade union cadres to fill strat-
egic positions of leadership in the organizations and struggles of the broad
Negro national liberation movement.

4. we must speed the organization of Negro tenant farmers, sharecrop-
pers, and agricultural workers and insure their close connection with the general
union organization of the whole South.

5. we must look to the early formation of a militant anti-imperialist,
interracial student organization on Southern college campuses.

6. we must look toward the early development of a powerful independent

-3-

united women's movement, in the South, interracial in composition wherever pos-
sible. In defense of the lives and future of their children and on a whole number
of welfare and service needs, women in the South are prepared to move in a much
more conscious and organized way to make their independent contribution to the
general struggle.

7. we must seize every opportunity to develop unity actions and confer-
ences on minimum programs or single issues (e.g., the Negro vote) on city and
state levels.

8. The presence of thousands of Negro veterans of world war II among
the workers in the cities and the toilers of the countryside and in the colleges
of the Black Belt is a factor of enormous significance for the future development
of the national liberation movement. In most of the South, as a result of the
discriminatory Jim-Crow policies of the major veterans! organizations, the Negro
veterans remain unorganized. The independent organization of Negro veterans in
the South in a veterans‘ association, on a local and South-wide scale that would
maintain the extended hand of fellowship to white veterans to Join with them,
would greatly strengthen the Negro liberation movement.

9. on every issue at each stage of the development of the struggle,
we must take pains to establish the relationship of the particular action of the
Negro masses to the advanced self-interest of the white masses, to the South as
a whole, to the nation, and to the general cause of world peace and democracy.
Thus will we more and more master the art of attracting the white workers to ac-
tive participation in the struggle for the rights of the Negro people.

10. Basic for developing the Negro liberation movement in the Black
Belt specifically, and the democratic struggles in the South as a whole, is the
building of the Communist Party in that region, among the Negro and white workers
with special attention to workers in the Black Belt cities and towns. The Party
must be built so that it can fulfill its vanguard role of strengthening and con-
solidating the various movements and organizations that come into being as the
struggle develops. The Party has a special role in the national liberation move-
ment; for under the conditions of the imperialist epoch only a national libera-
tion movement that is molded and led by the Communist Party can be victorious,
and only the Communist Party can connect up the struggle for national liberation
with the working class struggle for Socialism as the guarantor of the complete
and final victory of the struggle for national liberation and cultural fulfill-

ment.
III. TOWARD THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGRARIAN REVOLUTION

the development of American capitalism that

we know from the history of
until 1890 and the scarcity of labor

the existence of a "free land frontier"
power were important factors in spurring on the quantitative and qualitative

growth of industrialization of the country as a whole. As a consequence of these
factors and others, American agriculture developed capitalist forms that corres-
ponded with the given stages of development of the mode of production and exchang

But that is not fully true with the South. Here the mode of production
of the agricultural economy was at first based on the accumulation of wealth ex-
tracted from utterly unrequited slave labor. The basic means of production, the
land, was the private monopoly of a handful of planter-landlords. One of the ba-
sic unfulfilled missions of the betrayed democratic Reconstruction of the South
was the failure to carry through the agrarian revolution. Though the character
of the labor force has changed from Negro slaves to a combination of semi-serf
and barely paid free labor - Negro and white - the bulk of whom still occupy

-9-

a relation to the land they till somewhat sim11ar_to the European serfs of the
Middle Ages « the semi-feudal, semi-slave production relations on the big Planta-
tions of the South remain. ' i i

The plantation landlord, like his counterpart a hundred years ago, is to
this day supreme master over all those sharecropper and tenant families who live

on his property. The rules he promulgates for governing and operating his planta-

tion take precedence in practice over all formal democratic rights and lawful P?1V1'

leges to which his "hands" may lay claim. The land hunger and the struggle of the
landless Negro and white farmers against the planter-monopolists of the land is an
elemental revolutionary force operating both within the Black Belt and throughout
the entire South.

Lenin placed great importance on the responsibility of the working class
for the development of the agrarian revolution in its own interest. He wrote as
follows in his article on "American Black Redistribution":

"Our constant aim, not to be forgotten for a single moment, must be the
organization of a separate, independent party of the proletariat, striving, through
all the democratic upheavals, towards a complete Socialist revolution. But to turn
our back upon the peasant movement on this ground would be hopeless philistinism
and pedantry. No, there is no doubt about the revolutionary and democratic nature
of this movement, but we must support it with all our power, develop it, make it
politically conscious and definite in a class sense, push it further, march toge-
ther with it hand in hand to the end - since our goal lies very much further than
that of any peasant movement. we are marching to the final goal — the end of the
very division of society into classes." *

The necessities and opportunities of the times dictate that everything
be done to speed the development of a really mass fighting organization on the ‘
Southern countryside, uniting hundreds of thousands of rural poor behind a program
of struggle for the economic, social, political and cultural needs of the country
common folk, Negro and white.

The organization of the masses on the countryside must be initiated by
the advanced workers and must be developed first of all in those rural districts
in closest proximity to urban centers of working-class strength. The struggles
in the rural areas will be expressed through a number of provisional organizational
forms initially, which, as these struggles develop, will come to achieve a single
effective form, corresponding to the demands and the consciousness of the rural
masses.

, In undertaking most earnestly our responsibility toward speeding the
organization of the Southern countryside, we shall be helping to assure, in the
words of Stalin, "that the broadest and most powerful strata of the petty—bourgeoi-
sie, the peasantry, will be transformed from potential reserves of the bourgeoisie
into real reserves of the proletariat."

The ruling class apologists are assiduously promoting the thesis that a
quiet, peaceful, industrial revolution has already taken place in Southern agri- ‘
culture and that all that remains is for the social mores to adapt themselves to
the new mechanized mode of production on the countryside.

Mechanization is not going forward at.such a rate in this hour of the
general decline of capitalist economy, that the semi—feudal plantation system is
being wafted away automatically. ‘

The "mechanization" worshippers at the trough of economic determinism
utterly fail to understand the moribund condition of American imperialism. Their
hallelujah paeans to the cotton picking machine as the magic nostrum for the
South's ills have no Justification in the statistical facts on the number of
picking-machines, tractors, and other farm machinery in use in the South. one
swallow does not make a spring, nor a handful of mechanical cotton pickers an
agrarian revolution. Even if we should assume what is not the case, namely, the
widespread mechanization of Southern agriculture, we cannot for a moment forget
that such mechanization of agriculture under capitalism would itself create mass
unemployment. It would uproot from the land and separate from means of subsis-
tence a vast rural population, with resulting aggravation of all the social prob-
lems of the South.

The economic outlook for the rural poor of the South is not one of pros-
perity through mechanization but of increased misery and impoverishment brought
about by the developing economic crisis.

The perspective for the rural South is that of an organized mass move-
ment of farm labororers, sharecroppers, tenants, and small farmers engaging the
landlord class and the forces of repression of the state apparatus in sharpening
struggles for land and liberty.

Such are the main features of the three revolutionary currents in the
South which it is our task to help deepen, broaden and strengthen in order to
further develop the fullness of their respective independent power and to facili-
tate their conscious unification under the leadership of the Southern workers,
and in coordination with the working class and peopleis movement of the rest of
the country.

CAMP OF THE PEOPLE'S ENEMY

what are the forces which constitute the camp of the peoplefs enemy in
the South?

The trusts, the banks, the monopolists, in a word, the finance capitalisi
oligarchy which controls the economy of the whole country is also the real owner
of the South. As Harry Haywood notes: "The Morgans, Rockefellers, duPonts, Mel-
lons, are today the real owners of the South....It is they who dominate the com-
manding heights of southern economic life, they who have underwritten the planta-
tion system and its color-caste system. Their banks maintain the credit struc-
ture without which the plantation could not live. It is they who control the
South's steel, coal, railroads, and utilities." * As Haywood further points out,
for example: "The State of Georgia is 85 percent absentee owned, 50 cents of ever;
dollar on deposit in Georgia banks is owned in the North."

The Southern white capitalists and landlords, whom Haywood characterizes
as Wall Streetls pro-consuls, are indeed the comanders of the outposts of reac-
tion in the South, against whom the Southern workers, the Negro liberation and
agrarian—revolutionary forces must direct their fire in the first instance.

The Southern white capitalists have no independent status. Ever since
1776 they have filled the position of "ffront-men! in the South for the absentee
Northern landlords....It is their Job to maintain the Southern lag and poverty as
an essential condition for the extraction of super-profits from the starvation
labor of the Negro and white masses. They desperately oppose all efforts to lift
the South out of its lowly economic and cultural state." ** The Southern white
capitalists have long been integrated (on the lower levels) into wall Streetis

pyramid of monopolistic control of the economic life of the whole country.

The contradictions between the interests of sectors of the Southern white
capitalists and the wall Street monopolists is made much of by the most reaction-
ary Southern political demagogues - Talmadge of Georgia, Long and Perez of Louisi-
ana, etc. However, the fact is that these apparent contradictions are primarily
reflections of the jockeying for,supremacy that goes on within the camp of the big
wall Street bandits and are of but small tactical advantage to the peopleis forces.
Hence, the efforts of certain Southern liberals to portray the viciously reaction-
ary Southern white capitalists as the outraged victims of the wall Street pBlnder—
ers only serves to disorientate the masses, blunt their class—consc1ousness and
foster illusions about "comon interests" with their own exploiters against wall
Street.

The Southern white capitalists and landlords dominate all levels of poli-
tical power in Southern governments. with capital supplied by wall Street corpora-
tions Southern capitalists and landlords spawned the openly fascist Dixiecrat
Party and its semi-military adjunct, the modern K.K.K.

Standing behind the landlords, industrialists and bankers - the direct
exploiters and oppressors of the Southern masses - and defending their every whim
and interest, are the ruthlessly autocratic county, local and State governments,
supported and backed up by the punitive powers of the Federal Government. O.C.Cox
mercilessly catigates the relationship of the Federal Government to the lynchocra-
cy of the South in this significant passage:

"It is this assurance of the continuing availability of the armed viol-
ence of the nation which gives confidence and authority to the anti-democratic
class, while it produces inaction and irresolution in the advocates of democracy.
Organized violence is practically all on one side of the table.

"The master—race idea and fascism can be purged from the social system
only by a change in the system itself; and for great powers this is ordinarily
a domestic undertaking." *

This wall Street dominated Federal Government is not interested in open-
ing up the South to economic and political democratic development as certain re-
formists maintain; rather, it is striving to impose through its Mundt-Ferguson
bills, Foley Square trials, etc., the Southern form of naked and tyrannical class
dictatorship over the entire country - and the world.

The popular forces for democracy in the South must also recognize as fol-
lowers of the enemy camp a motley assortment of individuals who call themselves
"southern regionalists." This camp embraces Negro-bourgeois nationalists, labor
lieutenants of imperialism, and other apologists for the status quo of bourgeois-
Bourbon domination over the lives and liberties of the people in the South.

Finally, the forces of progress and advancement in the South confront the
armed brigands of the Dixiecrat-Klan extreme reaction.

Such then are the general class forces arrayed in opposition to the peo-
plels progress in the South. Though powerful enough to continue to exact a great
toll in blood, sweat and tears from the masses, the oppressor class is a ruling
authority that is moribund and historically doomed; for the struggle for life
itself will swell the forces of the people's democratic camp led by the working
class. History is on the side of the peoplels developing forces in the South.

The building of the Communist Party in the South and the extension of its influence
among Negro and white toilers is an urgent and vital task to achieve victory.

THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE IS DECISIVE

I should now like to discuss briefly the connection between the struggle
for Negro liberation and the central, over-all issue of the struggle for peace.

The struggle for peace is of special and decisive importance for the-South

today because it is here that wall Street imperialism holds in subjection the op-
pressed Negro nation. The wall street - bipartisan policy of chauvinist national-
ism expressed towards foreign lands, especially toward the Soviet Union, China and
the Peoples! Democracies, is likewise manifested concretely here at home in the
continued subjugation of the Negro nation in the Black Belt region of the South.
Thus, the fight for peace against Wall Streets drive to conquer and enslave other
peoples becomes at the same time the fight to liberate the already enslaved Negro

nation. ' _ .

. A genuinely effective peace movement in the South must orient itself in
the direction of seeing the inseparable connection between the fight against the
war policies of Wall Street and the struggle for democratic liberties in general
and for the democratic rights and national liberation of the Negro people in par-
ticular. yo fight for peace is to fight to break the stranglehold of Wall Street

"on the life of the South.

Our over-riding responsibility is to work untiringly to help the people
of the South give organized expression to their peace sentiments. In the South,
the development of a truly effective broad united-front movement for peace can,
if properly orientated, become the beginning of a great interracial force for the
general advancement of the economic needs and democratic rights of the Negro and
white masses. If we organize and conduct, in association with the working people

of the rest of the country, in unison with the peace forces of the world, a real

mass struggle for peace, we shall create even more favorable conditions for suc-

cessfully waging the struggle for Negro liberation and for general democratic ad-
vance of the masses of the people in the South. '
