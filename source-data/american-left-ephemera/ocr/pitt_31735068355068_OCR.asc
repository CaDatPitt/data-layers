THE MINE-MILL UNION 4

 

-Baltimore Local
“Wins Arbitration

BALTIMORE——Local 625 has
won an arbitration case on be-
half of Brother Thomas Hill.

Hill, a technical assistant at
the Baltimore Plant of the
American Smelting and Refining
Company, had been demoted to
Laborer after he failed to fol-
low instructions on identifying
and marking selenium samples,
in January of this year.

The union maintained that de-

vimotion for this offense, even
lwhen combined with several
.~ minor infractions over the past

10 years, was unwarranted. Ar-

bitrator George Strong agreed .
 and ruled that a corrective pen-
v‘ alty, rather_than permanent de-

motion, would have been in

_ order. -

There also seems to have been

_- some element of racial discrimi-

nation in the unusually severe
penalty meted out to Hill.
Strong ordered Hill reinstated

I asof October 7, but without back
4 pay as requested by the union.

Strong said the loss in pay would

"serve as a disciplinary measure.

The local had invited other

president Henry Myers intro-

duced Brother James Edwards,’

president of Local 870, who gave
a brief history of the Union and
called upon the members to stick
together in “the only union in
the South that is in the middle

of the civil rights battle.”

Vice President Randolph Eng-
land of Local 870 urged the
younger members of Mine-Mill
to become more active in union
affairs so that they could take
the place of the old leadership.

International Rep. Jesse

N.Y. Local Wins

8-ll Cent lncrease

TOTTENVILLE, N.Y.——Wage
increases ranging from 8 to 11
cents an hour took effect Nov. 1
for several classifications of
workers at the Nassau Smelting
and Refining Co. The agree-
ment, negotiated by Mine-Mill
Local 729 and the company, was
ratified by a secret ballot of the
membership.

Pension benefits were also in-
creased about $20 a month. In
addition, the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield medical plan was
instituted for the first time with
the company paying 25 percent
of the cost. In two years, the
company will take over half pay-
ment for the coverage.

The contract, which also pro-
vides other more liberal major
medical _and life insurance bene-
fits, will run for 38 months (until
the end of 1966), with wage re-
openers at the end of 1964 and
the end of 1965. On Dec. 31,
1964, '» the union will have the
right -to negotiate for an addi-
tional paid holiday.

$500 to
Strikers

The International Executive
Board, at its November meet-
ing, voted a contribution of $500
to support Canadian Local'901*s
eight months old strike at the
Reeves-MacDonald Corp. in
Salmo, B. C.-

The strike is still 100 per cent
solid, and there is high morale
among the strikers and the
townspeople. But the company
is adamant in its refusal to ne-
gotiate realistically with the
strikers.

Issues in the strike revolve
around the refusal of the com-
pany to accept the findings of
the majority of a conciliation
board. ‘The proposed settle-
ment was for a one-year agree-
ment with 71/2 cents per hour

Hits State Enforcement; 
Voitmtnry lnjury Reports ' 

WASHINGTON~—Interior Secretary Stewart: L. - 

Udall’s long-awaited report on mine safety was submitted
to Congress last month. The report, authorized by Con‘-

gress in 1961 and two years in the making, incorporates. - in
basic data gathered by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, and

was prepared by the Interior Department Mine, Safety
Study Board under the chairmanship of Paul Boyajian of

Phoenix, Arizona.

From December 4, 1961 to September 26, 1963, th
period for which data were collected, 343 men were killed
while at work in metal and non-metallic mines and mills,
quarries, sand and gravel pits. 230,000 men were em-

ployed in these industries.
only, 10,189 work injuries re-
sulted in 212 deaths and more
than 7,000 man-years of time
lost from work. More than four-
fifths of the work injuries were
caused by handling materials,
slips and falls, machinery, haul-
age, and falls of rock. More
than half the fatal accidents re-
sulted from unsafe conditions
over which the victims had no
control. - '

In reviewing this record, the
report labeled state mine safety
laws and enforcement as “clear_-
ly inadequate” and concluded
that “it would be difficult to
ignore the need for positive ac-
tion.”

Recommendations to

Congress

Recommendations to Congress
call for passage of legislation
authorizing the Secretary of the
Interior:

1. To appoint advisory com-
mittees
tives of labor and management
to assist in formulating federal
safety codes for metallic and
non-metallic mining industries,

‘ and to advise the Secretary on

other health and safety matters.

2. To require compliance with
major provisions of safety codes,
and empowering his represen-

tatives to enter all mines for

inspection and investigation.

3. To require accurate and
timely employment and injury
reports from operators.

The report also recommends
that sufficient funds be appro-
priated to carry out the above
functions and to carry on an im-
proved and expanded program
of health and safety education.

The recommendations in Sec-
retary Udall’s report go a long
way -toward meeting. the major
points in Mine-Mill’s 15-year ob-
jective of a federal safety pro-
gram, which is now embodied
in the Metcalf-Montoya -bill in-
troduced in Congress last July.
However, the‘Se_,cretary’s report
does not explicitly recommend
that the program be extended
to smelter-s and refineries. (For
comment on this and other as-
pects of the report, see Secre-
tary-Treasurer ‘Dichter’s col-
umn, p. 8).

Hit Sfufe Safety Lows

And Mine Inspection

The hardest hitting part of the
Udall report deals with the ram-
shackle, out-dated, hit-and-miss
state mine safety laws, and the
sorry record of the state mine
inspectors in failing to correct
even the unsafe practices and
conditions that are clear viola-
tions of these codes.

In the course of the federal
it wa

including representa- .

For the calendar year 1962

S'l'ewarl" Udall 0
Secretary of the interior

found that only 544 of these
mines were subject to any spe-
cific provision of a state mine
safety law or code. Surprisingly,
47,000 employees, or 28 percent
of those working in mineral min-
ing either were exempt from

state mine safety laws or were .

not covered by specific laws.
The exemptions resulted from
absence of any state mine safe-
ty law or code in some states,

or from exemptions of mines‘

producing certain minerals, of
small mines with less than a
stated number of workers, or of

open pit and other types of

mines.

At mines subject to specific
mine safety laws, 4,080 viola-
tions of state laws were ob-
served. Utah led all states with
a total of .875 violations of the
state law, or 21 percent of total
violations observed in all states.
Montana led in violations per
mine with an average of 15.3.

1,734 violations were of_ long ‘

standing which obviously had
existed for a time sufficient to
have allowed «prior correction.

Def in-it e -information on the

number of legal actions taken
to correct such violations was
provided by 32 states. State
mine safety inspectors in five

states said they couldn't -re-.

member evcr having instituted
a legal action, 22 reported -no
actions for periods of one to 23
years, and -in the remaining five
states legal actions totaled 12
during periods ranging from one
to 10 years. ‘
The number of violations of
state laws observed would have

been much larger had the vari- -

ous state laws covered all mines
surveyed, and if the state laws
were reasonably adequate in
coverage of hazards. The sur-
vey indicated, for example, that

THE SPIRIT OF CHRBSTMAS

By Asbury Howard
International Vice President-

" ING HEROD, when he learned that an infant had been born
V ‘ in Bethlehem who would one day rule King of Kings, ordered

that all the little children of the city should be slain. And the-

soldiers of Herod went forth and did his bidding.

That part of the Christmas story is particularly appropriate
on this anniversary of the birth of Christ. For today we have our
own Herods, and we have even had our own, very modern Mas-

' sacre of the Innocents: the Birmingham church bombing which took

the lives of four little girls as they attended
Sunday School. Governor Wallace, by his de-
fiance of the law and inflaming of race

usual, in business as usual, or even Christ-

' mas as usual?” A good question, that last, and one which has

been answered by a call for a boycott of commercialized Christ-
mas. Representatives of almost all Negro organizations, meeting

in Washington at the request of Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, en-
dorsed the idea of some sort of “Christmas sacrifice” and a

formal call for a boycott has been issued by the Association of

‘Artists’ for Freedom, of which Baldwin is spokesman.

‘k * *
OR MANY years clergymen have been -urging us to “Put
Christ back in Christmas.” It has becom.e a national joke that
each year the Christmas selling season starts earlier and earlier.
One wit has written a parody which begins, “God rest ye merry

-merchants, may ye make the Yuletide pay.”

This year there is more reason than ever to de-emphasize the
commercial aspects of Christmas and place renewed stress on the

‘-significance of Christ, on the brotherhood of man, and on the

-achievement of peace on earth. Instead of going into debt trying
to keep up with the Joneses in the munificence of our Christmas
giving, why not just make a modest contribution to a church, to
our union, to a civil rights or peace organization, and make our
Christmas celebration a restful family gathering instead of a rat-
race?

Why not explain to our children that we cannot have Christ-
mas as usual this year because we must make a sacrifice, to
atone for our personal responsibility for the absence of peace on
earth, and of good will among men?

If we‘ must give gifts, why not make them really meaningful
and personal? Baldwin and a number of other artists and intel-
lectuals have suggested that, “For the children too young to
understand, we will make gifts and toys with our hands from boxes
and cans and string and love.’’

, * ‘A’ ‘k _
OST OF US can 111 afford the financial strain that accom-

panies the “cash-register Christmas.” But all of us can af-
ford the simple and dignified and truly Christian celebration pro-
posed here. And, I .am sure, we will all be spiritually richer for
having done so.

 

Leader of Picket Movement-

Arrested Second Time in Ky.

HAZARD, Kentucky—-For the
second time in six months, Ber-
man Gibson, the leader of a
year-long roving picket move-
ment in the coal fields of South-
eastern Kentucky, has been ar-
rested—this time on charges of
armed robbery and assault with
a deadly weapon with intent to
kill. The arrest took place
on the day of a local election
here early in November. The
charges stem from an incident
alleged to have occured on_ Nov.
30, 1962, almost a year before.

Charles Engle and Charles
Moore were also arrested on

. the two charges. A fourth man,

Harvey West, was charged with
armed robbery. All four picket-
ers were arrested while waiting
in line to cast their votes in the
local election.

In June, 1963 Gibson and seven
other leaders of the strikers
were arrested on a charge of
conspiracy to dynamite a rail-
road bridge. All eventually were
released on bond, although an
examining trial was held, with
reasonable grounds found for
calling a grand jury to consider
indictment.

Gibson claims that collusion
exists between the coal opera-
tors and the federal agents,
state, and city police and that

the arrests are simply an at-

tempt to intimidate the miners
from voting and picketing.
FBI agents reportedly were

- on the scene for weeks before

the original conspiracy charges
were made.

Gibson, since September, 1962,
has organized more than 4,000
unemployed miners in seven
counties on two issues-getting
jobs and getting back their
union. The strike, now over for
all intents and purposes,
reached its peak in December,
1962, when 7,000 miners or about
25 per cent of the work force
had left their jobs.

That month, Governor Bert
Combs induced the strikers to
agree to a truce, during which
time he attempted to mediate
the dispute, which was “un-
authorized” by the United Mine
Workers. '

Although 19,000 miners in

which is supporting the
defense of Berman Gib-
son and his associates.

Southeastern Kentucky are idle
or unable to get jobs in union
mines, much pressure by state,
county, and local officials was
put on the strikers. Unemploy-
ment compensation, w elf a r e
benefits, and relief were denied
to those who would not return to
work.

Causes of the long struggle in
Southeastern Kentucky are com-
plex, not simply the result of
the long-term downward trend
of employment in coal. Because
of Northern competition, many
of the larger Southern mines
ceased production and their

A land was lea_sed to small op-

erators, generally form-er man-
agers ‘or foremen.

The operation of small hillside
mines or “dog holes” on a non-
union basis and under generally
u n s a f e conditions eventually
drove the UMWA to call a gen-
eral strike of coal miners in
Eastern Kentucky in 1959. In
effect an organizational strike,
it was ostensibly carried on to
enforce the contract, which had
included an agreement permit-
ting mine operators to introduce
mechanization in exchange for
the establishment of a broad-
scale welfare program financed
by them. Most of the small non-
union subcontractors were -not
contributing. ~

The 1959 strike ended in dis-

aster for the miners. Several
union officials were sent to
prison. The union‘ was sued for
a vast amount of money, only
some of which has been paid.
‘Following the strike, the Miner’s
Welfare Fund, jointly admini-
stered by the UMWA and ??-??
employers announced that its
four eastern Kentucky Miner’s
Memorial Hospitals would close
in July, 1963. .

Receiving no UMWA support in
1962, the miners were forced

to use _the technique of roving;
pickets, which attempted to hit,

the many owners who had failed
to pay into the welfare fund.
But they were unable to keep
picketing more mines, over, a
wider area, for longer periods
of time.

Conference Group Gets
Higher Education Aid Bill

WASHINGTON—After all these years, hopes are high for final Congressional ap-
proval of a bill to aid our educational system. The bill in question (HR 6143) is lim-
ited to higher educational facilities; differing Versions have passed the House and

Senate.

A joint conference committee now must iron out some knotty points of conflict,
a process that will be anything but easy. Basically, the legislation calls for a five—year,

$1.9 billion program of federal

, grants and loans to help col-

  

leges build more classrooms,

"laboratories and libraries. Pub-

lic --and private institutions are

I, included.

Last year, similar legislation
died in a conference commit-

‘tee, but the differences to be
vresolved were stickier than this

year’s problems.

’Mental Health Law Signed

Thepresident has signed into

‘law landmark legislation‘ deal-

ing with mental illness and
mental retardation. The legis-

' lation embodied a large portion

of JFK’s recommendations for
combatting mental disabilities
through the new approach of

community health centers.

Authorized by the new law is
a total federal expenditure of
$329 million over a four-year
period. The funds would. be
used to help build mental re-

tardation facilities and commu-

nity health centers, and to train
teachers for mentally retarded
and handicapped children. Con-
gress refused to authorize $417

_ million to help staff the commu-
.,nity health centers.

Slowdown on Tax Bill
Consideration of the House-

‘passed tax bill by the Senate

Finance Committee is getting

‘ nowhere fast. Sen. Harry Byrd,

the committee chairman, op-
poses legislation this year and
has slowed its progress to a

«snail’s pace. What he’s doing

is to accumulate an endless wit-
ness list while limiting testi-
mony to a few hours a day.

. The slowdown is a typical
example of how a strategically

- placed legislator can just about

call the shots. There is, how-

ever,’ the possibility of some

good coming out of Byrd’s de-

slaying tactics; more and more

senators are tagging the House
measure for what it is—a ~“rich

.- man’s tax bill.” Senator Gore,
“calling for wholesale changes,
: is leading the revolt.‘ 1 ~

lW0 GREAT Pnrslorms

By Al Skinner
International President

ERHAPS everything that needed to be said about the shocking .

and violent death of President Kennedy and the subseq'_uent
grief of the nation and the world has been said in the pastotwo
weeks. But as a trade unionist I feel compelled to reflect on the
impact on the working people of America of this man and another
who died suddenly in office—Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Both Kennedy and Roosevelt came to office with the over-
whelming support of American working people. Both were born into
great wealth, yet cared so little for money or material things that
they reflected the hopes and aspirations of the “little people’j'_of_
this world like no president since Abraham Lincoln. - 4

President Roosevelt, through his dynamic leadership, ledgour
country out of the despair of the depression 
of the thirties, put America back to work,
brought dignity and the right to organize to
working people, developed the Federal Wage
and Hour Law, the Social Security system, '
the National Labor Relations Act, and led
our country through the long war against
fascism. In his last years‘ in office Roosevelt
became the architect of the United -Nations
in a dedicated attempt to build a solid and
lasting peace in this world. -

. ~k- ' ‘k at v T -

UT ROOSEVELT, who died in the middle

of an unprecedented fourth term, was
President of the United States for 14 years.
‘Kennedy was President less than three years. _

, Most Americans who lived through the long administration of
Franklin Roosevelt’ saw in the election of President Kennedy a
resemblance to the courage and compassion for the common people

Skinner

that Roosevelt brought to office. Though many may have rques-l

tioned President Ker'medy’s methods and the limited results of his
efforts in these few short years, no intelligent American can ques-
tion his sincerity or his intentions to build a better America and a
peaceful world. . ‘ . 

Kennedy’s efforts to bring medical care for the aged, educa-
tional opportunities for the young, and equal rights and opportuni-
ties for all Americans regardless of race are a matter of record.
His increasing concern over the effects of automation and growing
permanent unemployment in America became evident in recent
months. The 15-year effort of miners and smeltermen in our Union

- to enact an adequate federal mine safety law has been broughtsa

giant step closer to realization under President Kennedy and Sec-
retary of the Interior Stewart Udall. V . .
Though we have often been impatient with the slow. pace of--the
President’s program in Congress, we knew the desire and direction
of our President, and all of us had hope that these objectives would
eventually’ be realized. Despite the formidable opposition of power-
ful and reactionary interests, we sensed that if the common people
continued to make their voices heard in Congress we would some-
how prevail. 
* ‘ .

HAT we had good reason to cherish such hopes under President

Kennedy is evident in passages from the speech which the
President was to deliver in Dallas the day he was killed. He said,
“There will always be dissident voices heard in the land, expressing
opposition without alternatives, finding fault but never favor, per-
ceiving gloom on every side and seeking inﬂuence without respon-
sibility. Those voices are inevitable.” 

And the President would have said, “It should be clear by now
that a nation can be no stronger abroad than she is at home. Only
an America which practices what it preaches about equal rights
and social justice will be respected by those whose choice affects
our future.” A ’ ' 

And the President would have concluded, “We inthis country,
in this generation, are-—by destiny rather than cl1oice—the watch-

men on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we
may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint——and that we
may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient visionfof
“peace on earth,“ goodwill toward men.” - ‘
‘k at ‘k 1-
- HE great tragedy of the murder of our President, P9175393
even more than death itself, is that he did not live to see hiS
dreams and objectives, expressed in the passages above, comeoto
fruition. V ' P

The labor movement cannot

other institutions. As a force
for social progress, we have

Similarly, in assessing labor’s

management. We must measure
our achievements against the
needs of our time.

Recalls Sit-down Strikes

Moreover, labor is no strang-
er to these techniques (of non-
violent direct action). I bid you
to recall the unbridled hysteria
which greeted labor’s first sit-
down strikes. If the Negro’s
nonviolent movement owes a
great deal to Gandhi and Thor-
eau, it is also indebted to the
American labor movement. If
the behavior of militant Negroes
baffles many white Americans,
it should not baffle the house of
labor. For, more than any other
segment of American society,
we have intimate knowledge of
the forces blocking the Negro’s
stride toward freedom.

Among those forces are auto-
mation and technological
changes. Automation is destroy-
ing tens of thousands of the un-
skilled and semi-skilled jobs to

which Negroes have traditional- .

ly been relegated.

Meanwhile, centuries of dis-
crimination and exploitation
have deprived. Negro Workers of
the education- and training. re-
quired by the new skilled jobs
opening up. Thus, we find that
approximately 25% of the long-

at AFL-CIO Meeft

term unemployed are black
Americans. ’

These millions (of unem-
ployed) are creating what the
great Swedish economist Gun-
nar_ Myrdal has described as
a vast “under-class” in Ameri-
can society. They are the pari-
ahs, the exiles, the untouchables
of our economy.

Calls for crusading

The problem of these work-
ers, black and white, is not
merely an economic problem.
It is a social problem. Social
justice and economic reform
have become inextricably in-
tertwined in our time. If we are
to speak to the needs of these
workers, the labor movement
will have to tap its well-springs
of social idealism. It will have
to renew its crusading spirit.

Our failure to meet this -chal-
lenge can bring only the ugliest
consequences of which the first
signs are already evident. Make
no mistake about it, brothers
and ~ sisters, there is a growing
feeling. of alienation from the
labor movement in the Negro
community. The Negro’s tradi-
tional loyalties toward organ-
ized labor have been put to a
severe strain. The Negro-labor

Arthur—Magna Local

  Wins 7 Arbitrations

Two arbitrators handed down awards last ‘month in
a total of nine grievances taken to arbitration by Mine-
Mill Local 392, representing workers at the Kennecott
mills at Arthur and Magna, Utah. "

Arbitrator Arthur M. Ross, Berkeley, California,
heard four cases involving. the proper remedy to be

applied for improper action by the company in assigning -

work in the bargaining unit to supervisors. The company
contended that the proper remedy in these cases was to
award a “rerate,” such as would have been paid on a

temporary transfer, to senior
employees working in the plant
at the time of the improper as-
signments to supervisors.

The arbitrator rejected the
company argument, reasoning
that “if we can presume that
all personnel were performing
some kind of productive work
when these violations occurred,
then the only true reconstruc-
tion would be . . . to make a
call-out.” Upholding the union’s
case, Rose awarded call-out pay
in all four cases.

Arbitrator Thomas H. Tongue,
Portland, Oregon, found for the
union in two cases, awarding
call out pay to pipefitters whose
work was improperly assigned
to locomotive cranemen, and
granting the union grievance in
the improper assignment of a
fork-lift operator to operation
of a Yale and Baker machine
when Yale and Baker operators
were available. In a third’ de-

cision, Tongue denied a union
request for call-out pay but held
that a machine shop helper was
improperly denied an opportu-
nity for a temporary transfer
at a higher grade.

Local 392 members participat-
ing in the arbitration proceed-
ings were David Bennett, Presi-
dent; Richard L. Thomas, Fi-
nancial Secretary; Harold New-
In an, Grievance Committee-
man, Magna mill; Fred E. Pet-

LEAD did it again last month! For the eighth time since the
beginning of 1963, the price of lead increased last month—to 121/2
cents per pound. -This is a full 3 cents more than lead was selling
for 12 months ago-—enough to put all lead producers in the black
and give a tremendous boost to profits. For example, St. Joseph
Lead last month doubled its dividend payment- to stockholders.

Continued strong demand for lead from the battery and tetra-
ethyl motor fuel industries, plus continued shrinkage of producers’
stocks of refined lead, have been the forces behind the upward push
in prices and profits. '

THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED CHILEAN mine and smeltermen,

on expiration of the present contract next February 1. There is also
a long list of fringe benefit demands, including one which would
require Anaconda to provide all retiring miners-with 25 years’
service, with a house in any area of the country they preferred.
The present contract, negotiated late in 1962 after a strike, pro-
vided a 21 percent wage increase. Since then Kennecott’s sub-
sidiary, Braden Copper,» granted a 45 percent boost after a one-
month strike, and Anaconda workers at the big Chuquicamata
mine got a 42 percent increase without a strike.

V Congress wanted to know was;

if the data could be improved

‘by requiring the submission of . it
complete reports by all opera-”

tors. The 1961 Mine Study” act
made filing of reports manda-
tory for the period of the study.
Uda1l’s report gives the answer
—-a shocking 46 percent ‘of all
mine operators were delinquent
in filing accident reports for

1961, when reporting was op- 
tional. For 1962, the first year ‘

that reports were on a man-
datory basis, the percentage of
delinquents had fallen to 10 per-
cent. This and failure of many
operators. to promptly report

fatal accidents led to the recom-

mendation -for legislation re-
quiring mandatory, accurate,
and timely reporting of work
accidents. How much faith can
be put in statistics basedon
reporting of what the operators
want to report when they report
at all?

Need for Federal
Safety Enforcement
During the safety -study, 800

mines were inspected, and of V

these, 714 were reinspected, all
but one of the remainder hav-
ing closed since the first in-
spection. Inspectors found a
total of 12,155 hazards to life and
limb duringthe 800 originatin-
spections, and submitted writ-
ten recommendations for the
elimination of each hazard.
These included fire hazards, un-
guarded openings, improper
storage of explosives, improper

blasting practices, lack of safe-_ 

ty devices and proper mainte-
nance of hoists, lack of escape-
ways, haulage, drilling, ventila-
tion, dust, radiation, electrical
and literally hundreds of other
hazards. .
At the 714 mines reinspected,
the correction of 10,858 hazards
originally had been recom-
mended in writing. At the time
of reinspection, only 4,503 of
these hazards had been elimi-
nated. Nearly 60 percent of the

recommendations had callously ‘

been ignored by penny-pinching,
profit-hungry operators. This led
the Udall report to observe that
“some elements of the industry
had a less than satisfactory rec-
ord of compliance with recom-
mendations.” Inspection experi-
ence at coal mines, the report
indicated, underlines the need

“for federal enforcement author-

ity as recommended by Udall.

er ‘Dangerous’

«Local 51, Selby, California, has arranged over the last few months, for thorough

“medical checks of some 40 employees of the AS&R lead smelter. Checks were under
— the supervision of Dr. L. Lewis, an authority on non-ferrous industrial diseases." These
checks have disclosed that over 50 per cent of the men checked had dangerous lead
conditions. The company, presented with this information, invited the California De-

partment of Public Health to make a plant survey, after shutting down some depart-
ments and giving the plant a cleanup. Local 51 has protested to the Public Health De-
partment, insisti_ng that it conduct unannounced inspections during normal operations,

and thoroughly c h e c k lunch
rooms and change rooms.

The action of’ Local 51 thus
far has led to hospitalization-and
treatment of several of the men
at Company expense, and pay-

-ment of workmen’s compensa-

tion to four members of the 10-
cal to date. Additional cases are

_ being filed with the state work-

men’s compensation- board. Lo-

.c'al'51 is also instituting a testing

program for other employees

_ not included in thefirst checks,

and is also pressuring the com-
pany for more adequate dust
and gas control in the plant.

15 Killed at Butte
Butte, Montana, is at the head

: of the list as the most dangerous
_ copper camp in the United, States

in 1962. According to accident

:data released by theiU.S. Bu-
; re_au of Mines late in October, a
Ltotal of 15 U.S. copper miners
‘were killed on the job last year.

Five of these were employed by
the Anaconda Company in Butte,

‘ and suffered fatal injuries un-
' derground, according to fatal ac-

cident investigation reports is-
sued by the Bureau. That’s 331/3

' percent of all the copper mine

fatalities ‘ in the United States
that year, from a group of un-
derground vein mines that pro-
duced less than 3 percent of all
the copper mined in the U.S. in
1962.

-Disaster Avertecl at Ruth
~ . Two disasters were narrowly

averted at Kennecott’s open pit
copper mine at Ruth, Nevada,

’November 20 and 21. Withbut

slight warning, part of the bank
at one of the lower levels start-
ed to give way. Fortunately, a
warning shout alerted the shovel
crew and other men working in
the area, who ran to safety sec-
onds before tons of rock cascad-
ed down on the shovel, com-
pletely burying it. Next day the
company ordered work resumed
at the slide. Shovel operator
John Sena and his partner

moved up toward the bank which

started to give way again. Sena
was able to back his shovel

‘ away in time to save it from de-'

struction.

Local 126 officers and safety
committeemen protested condi-
tions at this location to com-
pany officials, who said they
were “watching” it. Bureau of
Mines authority to inspect such
mine hazards expired last Sep-
tember, but the Bureau is pre-
pared to make inspections if re-
quested by the company.

Ray. Hayden Call for
Program

Locals 915 in Ray and 939 in
Hayden, Arizona, representing
the Kennecott mine and mill, re-
cently issued a leaflet-calling

. for a down-to-earth safety pro-

gram. The leaflet chargesjthe

Tcompany with temporary trans- -
ferring of men to operate unfa-
miliar equipme_nt' in order to

save the few minutes it would
take to get a regular operator.
The antiquated ambulance at the

Hayden mill also comes in for,

criticism—it has to be pushed to

get it started. The leaﬂet goes‘

on:
“The safety program in Ken-

necott is primarily used by the
Company as a form of publicity,‘

and good public relations with
the outside world. You hear
about it on your radio, you read
aeboutityin all newspapers, and

you see it in television. We‘ do"
jnot have anything against pub-

licity, and good public relations,
but all these things do not pre-

‘vent accidents and injuries to

Kennecott workers.

“When you are injured on the '-

job, the Company- Safety Engi-
neers get real busy, and the first

thing they do is to induce the»
company doctorsto release you-

to go back to work in any way,

shape or form-. They will take
youback to the plant on a

stretcher, if you let them. This

‘makes a good record, and a
, good report.”

Labor Dept. Pamphlet

U.S. Department of Labor has.

issued an excellent pamphlet,

readable and_illustrated, entitled '
“Using Injury Statistics.” The

pamphlet gives definitions of

types of injuries and explains.

how injury rates are calculated
and what they mean. The pam-

phlet notes the practices of some
company doctors in putting in- "

jured men back on the job to

avoid reporting a disabling work I

injury, as reported in the ex-
cerpt from the leaﬂets of Locals

‘ 915 and 939 quoted above.

The pamphlet says (page 4) a
temporary total disability “is an

injury which renders the injured ~
‘person unable to perform a reg-‘
ularity, established job which is

open and available to him. At-
tention is specifically directed to
the reference to a ‘regularly
established job’. This does not
mean ‘made work’ created to
accommodate an injured em-
ployee to avoid counting the
case as a ‘temporary total dis-
ability. It is here that the at-
tending physician is sometimes
subjected to pressures to ‘get
the man back into the plant’ in

the interest of preserving a plant ~

safety record. The practice of
counting the mere presence of
the employee as attendance at
work, whether he actually pro-
duces ‘or just puts in his time,

is contrary to the spirit and let-‘

ter of the standard.” ’ ,

Unfortunately, this practice is
all too frequent and throws into
serious question the validity of
published accident statistics for
our industry.‘

ordered fro.m the Superintendent
of Documents, Washington, D.C.
for 15 cents (coin, not stamps).
Or, most Congressmen will sup-
ply single copies free upon re-
quest. Ask‘ for Bureau of Labor

U.S. Bureau of Mines recently
reinspected the Canyon Creek,
Maiden Rock and- East La
Marche, phosphate mines of Vic-
tor Chemical division of Stauffer
Chemical ‘Company near Mel-

, rose, , Montana.

At the Canyon Creek and

V Maiden Rock mines, the rein-

spection - reports recommended

i that “Only Bureau of Mines ap-

proved equipment should be used

At Maiden Rock, the report
also recommended equipping the

mine with a main. fan installed ..

in fireproof housing preferably
on the surface. .

Comments on Udall Report

Members Barraza, Curtis, and Rask met with Secretary of ’ 

Interior Stewart Udall to discuss the mine safety study. then
being conducted by his department. It was a friendly meeting
which lasted longer than our allotted time. We left i__with the
feeling that not only was the study being pursued with vigor
but that both the Secretary and President Kennedy were deter-
mined to secure a" Federal Mine Safety Act.

The study has now been completed and submitted to Con- D I

gress. Not only is this a detailed survey of mine safety and the
present pitifully inadequate state standards but it blocks out a‘
comprehensive federal mine safety law. Its

there is no coverage forismelters and refin-

ing to recognize the necessity of including coverage for smelters

(Though our bill now bears the designation .

But there are important differences be- ‘

. tion of the Mine Safety Study Act need in no way limit the coverage j

by mine operators with only the major provisions of a ‘safety “

practice code. This repeats the mistakes of the Federal Coal Mine

Safety Act. Under the Coal Act enforcement is limited to the cor- - i A

rection of a number of specified unsafe "conditions and practices,‘
while the bulk of the coal safety code provisions are not enforce-
able under the law. 7 . » I 5

erally administered safety_- program for the longshore industry. and
_there need be none in our industry.

The Metcalf-Montoya Bill covers all of these matters. Itin-
cludes coverage for smelters and refineries. It authorizes and

‘directs the Secretary of the Interior to write and enforc_e‘the
