Conferences Reﬂect  
Vigor of the Union

DENVER—One of the ‘most ambitious series of
area-wide leadership conferences ever launched by Mine-
Mill was successfully concluded last month, having
brought together the widest groupings of local leaders

in many a year.

Planned by the International Executive Board at

 
 

AREA LEADERSHIP conference series winds up with two meetings shown in progress above. TOP PHOTO:

its July meeting, the series
began with District 5 in
Bessemer, Ala., Sept. 2-3, fol-
lowed by the conferences of
District 2 Sept. 29-Oct. 1 in Tuc-
son, Ariz., the Montana region-
al meeting in Anaconda Oct.
6-7, the District 3 and 4 Mid-
west meeting in Chicago Oct.
14-15, District 6 in New York

nal conference of District 7 in
San Francisco on Nov. 4-5.

ABOUT 350 rank and file
leaders and staff members in
25 states from coast to coast
‘participated in the series,
"many. of the local delegates
traveling hundreds of miles to
attend.

Secretary - Treasurer Irving
Dichter, who participated in
all but one of the meetings,
said they were “alive” and “re-
flected the vigor of our union
and its local leadership.” (See
Dichter column Page 4.) L
_ International officers and
members of headquarters staff
participated in all the _gather-

ings. In most cases, each area‘

also had its own special guests

munity organization fields.

panel, consisting ‘of Chief

Judge Murrah and Judges

gument in which Taylor laid

an extremely strong basis for,

dismissal of thewentire case or
for a new trial.

Major ground for outright
dismissal of the case was that
under decisions of the U. S.
Supreme Court the indict-
ment does not properly charge
a crime.

cient to establish, a, conspiracy} ,

based on the defense argu-

THE MINE-MILCL UNION

December. 196i 

 

Wage Program
Pushed in PD

Work is being stepped up in
the Arizona and El Paso, Tex-
as, locals to complete the job
description and comparison
phase of the Phelps Dodge
Council’s Wage Equalization
program by the end of the
year.

The last PD'Council meeting
seta Dec. 31 deadline for this
part of the program so as to
be able to prepare a complete
proposal for the International
Union convention in March,
when 1962 bargaining de-
mands will be finalized.

At Douglas, Joe Vilayterra is
in ‘charge of the program

among members of Local 470.

Considerable work has been
done on the project by Local
616 committeemen in Morenci.
In Bisbee Local 551, special
times were being set to ‘get
job descriptions from the pit,
mill, mechanical and surface
divisions’ where the .large num-

--*-ber of classifications compli-

cated the task.

El Paso Local 501 appeared
to be leading in the percent-
age of jobs already described,
-and active members are busy
adding to a number of descrip-
tions previously worked up.

'61" Constitutions
Now Available

One of the most democratic
union constitutions in the
American — la b o r movement
was mailed last ‘month to local
financial secretaries and busi-
ness agents, as well as staff
members.

That's the constitution of
the International Union of
Mine, Mill. and Smelter Work-
ers as amended by the 1961
convention in Tucson and re-
cently reprinted in its latest
form.

All locals were advised by
Secretary-Treasurer Irving
Dichter that additional copies
of the new edition may be or-
dered at fifty cents a copy
from his office.

Buffalo Pensioners
Express Gratitude

Two Buffalo American Brass
Company pensioners have
written recently to Local 593
expressing gratitude to the un-
ion for its help on unemploy-
ment insurance and other
problems.

One of the oldtimers is Pete
Jarka, who benefitted from
the clean sweep of cases won
by Local 593 over disqualifica-
tion of ABC pensioners for un-
employment compensation
benefits. Jarka was awarded
lump sum back benefits of
about $1,500 plus continuation
of $50 per week UC payments
for an additional 13 weeks.

In his letter, Jarka congrat-
ulated the union “for the won-
derful representatives-»y.Qu

have—Mr. Joe Scip,‘-ii (Int’l-.__

Rep. who handledrthe case)
and George Ekes_ (Local 593
member who was a witness)—

the way they represented the
union at my hearing for un-

e m pl 0 y m e n t.” Especially
thanking Scioli and Ekes, Jar-
ka said: “The credit of this
victory goes to the union. The
way these fine gentlemen
handled my case was amaz-
ing.”

Jarka concluded by saying:
“I also want to say to the
members of the union—You
have the best union in the
world, what they do for their
members. What does the AFL-
CIO do for their members?
The union is what the mem-
bers make it. Keep up the
good wor .” .

ANOTHER letter came from
pensioner Carl Jones who also
had been helped by the local
with his unemployment insur-
ance benefits. Jones this time
thanked the local for helping
his wife with needed blood do-
nations during a recent illness.

“Permit me if you will,”
Jones wrote to Int’! Rep. Sci-
oli, “to convey to you and the
brothers that you represent
my heartfelt thanks for the
kindness and help you gave
me when I needed it most-
the blood bank which made a
very important development

7 in my wife’s condition.”

Jones assisted the local in
its jobs petition campaign last
summer.

New Auxiliary

New charters for Mine-Mill
Ladies Auxiliaries were sent
out last month under the arti-
cle on auxiliaries added to the
International c o n s ti t u t i o n
which was approved by the
last convention in Tucson.

signed the number of the local
union with which they are

Ex-Sloss Miner
Writes Pres. Clark

A former Bessemer, Ala.,
Mine-Mill member who used to
work at the Sloss Red Ore
Mines, which is no longer in

operation, last month wrote a
letter to President John Clark
expressing his appreciation for
continuing to receive the Mine-
Mill Union paper.

“I cannot find words enough-

toexpress to you how I thank
the Union «for the Union pa-
per,” he told Clark in the let-
ter. “Asa union man, when I
read it each month it does
something for me, and at the
same time it keeps me well in-
formed of Labor, and I am
thankful. . . . I pray for you

all-to grow stronger and hold‘

steadfast so thatyou continue
to win victories.” V _ -

Case Won
By Local 18

KELLOGG, Idaho—An im-
portant arbitration decision
was won by Local 18 last‘
month when Arbitrator Thom- ',
as H. Tongue of Seattle ruled
that the American smelting &
Refining Company violatedtthei .
contract in unilaterally install- '
ing a contract bonus system
for stope mining which result-
ed in the elimination, of the
slusherman job from the;
vious three-man stope or Q
at its Page mine near f  .$
logg. - ,_ 4:3:

Before April, 1961, stopes
had been worked on a non-in-
centive basis by three men—a
timberman, a miner and a
slusherman. In April the com- ‘
pany, without consulting the
union, introduced a bonus
system that eliminated the
slusherman job from the crew
and required the two other
classifications to do his _work'.

Ruling for the union, ‘the
arbitrator held that the 
tion of the bonus system byit-
self was not barred’ by the
terms of the contract nor by‘
the past history of bargain-
ing on this issue. However, he
ruled, the system initiated: in
this case, insofar as it in-,
volved elimination of the
slusherman job, was an ex-
press violation of ‘ the _con-.

The contract clause involved

   
 

requires that “a change  . . ‘

in an existing classification,
which - permanently changes ~
the classification’s job con-’

tent” be “subject to negotia‘-y ‘C
tions” and “to the grievance \

and arbitration procedlyu-re.’\’
Jobs of some 18 slusherinen‘
were involved in the_—case..  .

Petit-Clair, who chaired the
conference, opened it by un-
derlining the point that next

‘Mine-Mill would be, in simul-

taneous negotiations. for the
first time since 1959. Conse-

ASS’T RESEARCH Director
Arthur W; Stuart led off with
a detailed analysis. of present
conditions in the non-ferrous.
metals industry, laying the ba-
sis for a wide discussion from
the floor which followed ‘a re-
port on the union’s general
bargaining perspectives by
Vice-President Al Skinner.

The delegates agreed that,

DISTRICT 6 CONFERENCE delegates take time out to pose for photo during sessions at Park Sheraton Ho-
fel in New York City. Mobilization of district for '62 bargaining headed topics of discussion.

in the district’s immediate pre-
parations for 1962 negotia-
tions, the main objective
would be guarantee of jobs
and job security, in face of con-
tinued automation and mech-
anization.

Ending the first day's. de-
libierations was discussion of
a report by General Counsel

Nathan Witt on. the-.SACB case

and hearing on the Teamsters
pact. The delegates expressed
wide support for continua-
tion of the defense fight until

tions on a sustaining basis.

A REPORT by Secretary-
Treasurer Irving Dichter on
labor unity and the Teamsters

pact was warmly received by"

the conference which com-
mended and approved the pact

as beneficial to non-‘ferrous ‘

metals industry’ workers.

Passed‘ unanimously was a S

motion, introduced by Stephen

- Trosko of Local 837‘ and sec-
onded by Theodore Gamble of 9
Local 552, which said: “We -
heartily approve the Team-\‘

sters pact with’ Mine-Mill and
we commend James Hoffa for
his defense of this pact before

On the matter of union fi-

that many locals would begin
raising their dues in prepara-

referendum next year.

In addition to the other ob-
jectives developed by the con-
ference, it was felt that the
district should concentrate on
establishing the basis for a
successful vote to strengthen
the union's financial structure.

The meeting adjourned with

the understanding that the‘

work of the conference would
serve as a guide for all district
activities in the immediate fu-

Dichter Reports on
Views of Delegates

WE HAVE just concluded a series of District Confer-
ences which brought together the widest groupings
of local union leaders in many a_ year. These conferences
were “alive” and reflected thevigor of our Union and its
local leadership. Discussions ranged over a wide variety
of subjects, from automation through civil
rights.

Perhaps the most important session at
each Conference was the one devoted to
reports from local unions. These reports
dealt mainly with on-the-job problems. Dele-
gate after delegate reported on the continu-
ing automation of their mines, smelters, or
shops. Automation seems to go hand in
hand with some forms of speed-up. Com-
panies are coupling jobs to eliminate work-
ers. End result is a continuing shrinking
work force, producing more than ever be-
fore.

In most instances the speed-up tech-
niques used by the companies are in clear violation of our agree-
ments. Many companies have now found a “gimmick" to subvert
the contract. They refuse to settle grievances and force our 10-
cals to go to arbitration. Arbitration has become enormously
costly and is an increasingly greater financial burden upon our
unions. In addition our people are greatly dissatisfied with the
lengthy haggling forced upon them by the companies over the
choice of arbitrators. The companies are attempting to limit the
choice of arbitrators. '

at * *

T WAS very apparent from the discussions that job security
would be a major issue in 1962 bargaining. In addition,

 

Dichter

. many of our local unions are going to attempt to tighten the

job guarantee elements in their contracts including seniority,
the nailing down of job descriptions and job content, and some

‘ more equitable operation of the arbitration machinery.

These Conferences gave our local union leaders the op-
portunity to review the work of the Union since the Convention.
There was a great deal of satisfaction expressed in the passage
of the “Mine Safety Study Bill.” This was an instance in which
the entire Union and particularly our local unions in the West
assured the passage of legislation that was evidently slated to
remain in committee until next year. There was a great ‘deal
of interest in the Union’s proposed “Early Retirement Bill” for
miners, smeltermen, and refinery workers. This is one of our
key legislative objectives for 1962. -

Our Mutual Assistance Pact with the Teamsters was ap-
proved at all Conferences. Our members on both Coasts were
particularly pleased with it. The delegates at all Conferences,
after discussing the pact, agreed it made good trade union
sense. There was considerable discussion on the Union’s civil
rights program. This was the first opportunity our» people had
to hear a report of the National Civil Rights Committee estab-
lished by our International Executive Board during its July

meeting. * * *

OST of our Conferences took place soon after the recent.
AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting and it was inevitable .

that some comparisons would be drawn between the action of
our Union as regards the Teamsters and on civil rights and
those of the AFL-CIO.

Whereas our Union took steps to cement the unity of all
organized workers and the workers in our industry by a closer
alliance with the Teamsters, the AFL-CIO again voted to bar
reaffiliation and took the disruptive step of voting to grant
Federal Charters to those secessionists who would destroy the
Teamsters. g

While our July International Executive Board meeting
recognized the fact that we must intensify our work for equal
rights on the job and in the community, the AFL-CIO voted
censure of A. Phillip Randolph for his vigorous fight for
equality. ,

All of our people throughout the country wanted more
detailed information on the raids in Sudbury and Port Colborne.
Our International Officers were able to give them first hand
reports on the way our Union in Canada was moving to defeat
these destructive raids. Every District Conference went on rec-
ord unanimously expressing support to our Canadian brothers.

***k

LL THE delegates heard reports on the progress of our

legal battles. The Conferences enabled the delegates to get
a clearer pfcture of the status and the nature of the SACB
case. Here again, the delegates expressed themselves in support
of the Union. With the many court victories chalked up by our
Union in the Jencks, Tra-vis,“and NLRB cases, they expressed
confidence in our ability to defeat the attacks against us.

A discussion of the Union’s activities and perspectives for
the coming year inevitably culminated in a discussion of Union
finances. Conference after conference went on record to support
a per capita increase. But it was apparent from a discussion
of the Union’s experience in the 1961 per capita vote that there
were two prerequisites for a successful vote in 1962. Those
local unions whose dues are presently inadequate for their own
activities—let alone a per capita increase—have to face up to
the problem now and increase their local dues. Secondly, if a
per capita increase is to be carried in the spring, the necessary
educational program to reach every rank-and-filer must begin

.now.

All of our Conferences were well organized and productive.
A good deal of the credit must go to the Board and Staff
members who organized these meetings and to the local union
leaders who participated in, them. These Conferences provided
the National Officers with the opportunity of testing the

A Union’s program in discussions with hundreds ‘of local union .
x ,_ leaders. They came. away from these Conferences not only re- ‘
 r“frg_esh’ed, _by these* experiences but much closer to thelday-to-day..l'

Peace Only Civil Defense

PORTLAND, .Ore.—Portland City Commissioner

Stanley Earl declared here last month that the only

answer to the terror» of the atom bomb is peace. His
statement drew a standing ovation during a debate with
Portland’s Mayor Terry Schrunk concerning the value of

   
   

bomb and fall-out shelters.

A report on the debate,
sponsored by the Jane Jeffer-
son Democratic women’s club,
appeared in the Nov. 8 issue
of. the-:. International .Wood-
worker, organ of the AFL-CIO

COMMISSIONER Earl, long
associated with the IWA and

a continuing battle with Mayor
Schrunk over the value of the

Reuther, who heads the AFL-CIO’s Industrial Union Department, made public“

report he submitted to the
department’s biennial con-
vention Nov. 15. The ‘report
was approved with only few

_ dissenting votes.

The IUD is made up mainly
of old CIO unions now affili-

REUTHER aised the ques-
tion of whether the AFL-CIO
could survive if its internal
strife goes uncorrected. He
said the life of the federation
is jeopardized by deep antago-
nisms between affiliated un-
ions. .

His report bared serious pol-
icy differences between the in-
dustrial unions and the crafts
which were formerly part of
the old AFL.

It said industrial unions “are
faced with the realization that
there has been an almost to-
tal lack of progress in’ all
those areas that were recog-
nized as ‘problems’ when the
AFLand CIO-united.”

He gave the audience a dra-
matic demonstration of the ef-
fects of an atom bomb on the
general Portland area with a
map showing the far-ranging
devastation from such a blast.
He concluded that more than

300,000 people would’ evapo-

rate in thin air if such a blast
were to hit the general city
area.

The only answer to “destruc-
tion or mutual suicide is
peace,” Earl said.

San Manuel Company

Negligence C ifed
In Death of Miner

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.——Preventive steps taken, by
San Manuel Copper Corporation to assure against anoth-
er mine death such as occurred here recently were wel-
comed by Mine-Mill Local 937 in a statement issued to

the press October 26.

Union member Raymond
Contreras was killed Octo-

ber 19 when buried under a

mass of wet ore at the San
Manuel mine. He was loading
ore onto haulage cars from an
unloading chute at the 1,475
foot level, and was working at
the low end of the chute when
the fatal accident occurred.
 35¢ =l<

A LEAFLET promptly is-
sued by the local accused the
company of negligence in the
death, pointing out that only a
couple of weeks before the un-
ion had filed a grievance
charging an extremely danger-
ous safety hazard existed at
the very panel where Con-
treras was later killed, and
asking that guards be erected
to protect the Chute Pullers at
the panel.

The grievance had been
turned down by Mine Superin-
tendent Charles Pillar on. the

ground that no special hazard.

existed and nothing was done
by the company to prevent the
kind of accident which cost
Contreras his life at the age
of 34.

A week after the accident,

however, Pillar issued a series
of directives to underground
foremen designed to prevent
another such death.

‘it til it!

IN HIS press statement on
the belated company action,
Local 937 President Fred
Sanchez said it was gratifying
to Mine-Mill members “that
the company finally recognized
the hazards and is attempting

to do something about them.” .

“These preventive orders,”
Sanchez declared, “were issued
only after Mine-Mill had made
an ,- issue of the unsafe prac-
tices in the mine.” He em-
phasized that the union “had
officially protested to the com-
pany that an unsafe condition
existed in the place where the
death occurred only shortly be-
fore it happened.”

Sanchez’ statement at the
same time took “violent excep-
tion” to a report of the State
Mine Inspector's office which
said the death was purely ac-
cidental and recommended‘
nothing to prevent further oc-
currence of similar fatalities.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

December. 1961

Sudbury Membership Rallies for

Rank and

SUDBURY, Ont., Can. —- An
aroused Mine-Mill membership
at the International Nickel
Company properties in Sud-
bury and Port Colborne mount-
ed a vigorous offensive last
month in the fight-back cam-
paign to defeat the Steel raid-
ers and their handful of co-
hort leaders in Locals 598 and
637.

Rank and file support for
Mine-Mill was growing rapidly
as more and more members

,, were becoming aware of the

destructive nature of the _raid
on non-ferrous metal workers’
unity and the fact that any di-
vision in their ranks would
set back trade uni-onism at
INCO for the next ten years.

Two major developments in
Sudbury recently dramatized
the determination of the mem-
bership to regain ‘rank and
file control of Local 598 from
the Steel clique headed by 10-
cal president Don Gillis.

* 1| 8!

DESPITE advertisement by
the Gillis forces to keep mem-
bers away, a meeting called
by the Mine-Mill Local 598 De-
fense Committee at the Legion
Hall in Sudbury on the night
of Nov. 8 overflowed the prem-
ises with Mine-Mill supporters.

The hall, which normally
seats about 1,500 persons was
jammed beyond capacity with
men standing wherever space
was available. More than 500
additional members who could
not squeeze in were turned
away, and others left in their

cars because of lack of park- 1

ing space.
Committee chairman Stan

Racicot presided at the meet-

ing which was addressed by
Mine-Mill Canadian Vice-Pres
ident Harvey Murphy, Canadi-
an District 2 President Mike
Solski, Tom Taylor (former
member of the Local 598 exec-
utive board who broke with
Gillis over the Steel raid), and
Yves Lemay, President of Port
Colborne Local 637.

UNANIMOUS endorsement
of the meeting was given to
a petition demanding that Gil-
lis call a special meeting of L0-
cal 598 to take up the ques-
tion of full mobilization of the
local against the Steel raid. It
also called for a program of
u n i t y in bargaining with
INCO.

Some 1,500 signed the peti-
tion at the meeting, far in ex-
cess -of the five percent of the
membership required by the

_ local constitution for calling
‘ such a special meeting in L0-

 

cal 598.
Another shift meeting held
the next morning in the same

Gains "Delayed
At Kam Kotia

TIMMINS, Ont. — Certifica-
tion of Mine-Mill Local 241 as
bargaining agent at the newly
organized Karn Kotia open pit

 copper mine near here is be-

ing held up by a protest by the
Steelworkers union which lost
to Mine-Mill in a representa-
tion election held last August
25.

The delay created by Steel’s
protest lodged with the On-
tario Labor Relations Board
is costing the Kam Kotia min-
ers the wages and benefits of
a new union contract. Steel
protested on the ground that
the Mine-Mill election observer
wore his membership button
on the day of the balloting.

A. re-hearing b e f o r e the‘

OLRB was held in Toronto on
Oct. 11, but no word on the

result had been received in -
Timmins as of Nov. 10, ‘accord-

le Control of Local  

PART OF CROWD of 2,000 local 598 members who packed Mine-Mill meeting at legion Hall in Sudbury
on night of Nov. 8. Another 500 who couldn't squeeze in were turned away. Next morning's shift meet-
ing. in some hull was attended by approximately L200 more members. Both meetings unanimously called
for full mobilization of local 598 to defeat the Steel raid.

hall was attended by approxi-
mately 1,200‘ more members
who also endorsed the petition
and unity program. Some 800
additional members also
signed the petition.

Members at both meetings
contributed several hundred
dollars to help in the expense
of fighting the Steel raid.

>i< ll! Ilf

EARLIER, on Nov. 2, a spe-
cial resolution condemning the
Steel raid was adopted by
some 1,200 members of Local
598 after Gillis and about 300
of his supporters had walked
out of the meeting which they
could not control. ,

Tom Taylor submitted the
resolution, also seconded from
the floor, demanding that the
resources of the local and na-
tional union be used to defeat
the Steel raid.

Gillis ruled the motion out
of order, refused to submit it
for vote of the meeting and
left the hall with his outnum-
bered supporters. Taylor then
took the chair and the resolu-

tion was resoundingly
approved by the 1,200 who re-
mained in the hall.

MEANWHILE, alt h 0 u g h
there is considerable doubt as
to the authenticity of Steel
cards and the way they were
obtained, a pre-hearing elec-
tion was expected at Port Col-
borne before the end of No-
vember. Confidence was ex-
pressed that this Steel raid
would be defeated just as the
last one ‘was in 1949.

In Vancouver, a member-
ship meeting of Steel Local
3302, second largest in British
Columbia, unanimously passed
a motion condemning the Steel
raid at Sudbury and Port Col-
borne, And at Hamilton, Ont.,
the membership of Local 1005,
largest Steel local in Canada,
rejected a motion by their own
executive board to endorse the
raid. The chair then ruled out

of order a motion from the .

floor to condemn the raid,
and abruptly adjourned the
meeting.

u.s. Councils
Contribute 'l-o
Sudbury Fight

-Three Mine-Mill bargaining
councils in the U. S. have now
acted with financial contribu-
tions to help their Canadian
brothers defeat the Steel raid
against Local 598 in Sudbury.

Following the lead of the

Kennecott council, the Phelps
Dodge and AS&R councils also
took similar action to sponsor
full page advertisements in
the Sudbury Star on behalf of
Mine-Mill solidarity across the
border.
' In reporting his council’s
donation of $250, PD ‘Council
C h a i r m a 11 David Velasquez
said: “Phelps Dodge members
in the U. S. are proud to be
able to make a small contribu-
tion to help maintain the unity
of all non-ferrous metals
workers in Mine-Mill.”

Suii Charges Top Sfeel Elections Iliegial    

PITTSBURGH, Pa.~—The en-
tire procedure for nominating
and electing international of-
ficers in the Steelworkers un-
ion is now being challenged as
illegal and undemocratic in
the U. S. district court here.

Donald Rarick, the -only man
in Steelworkers history ever
to get on the ballot as an op-
position candidate for the of-
fice of international presi-
dent, acted to void last Febru-
ary’s union vote in which
David J. McDonald was re-
elected to the top post.

He moved to reopen an old
suit challenging the Steel
union’s nominating proced-
ures, stating they illegally de-
nied him the right to run for
office.

* * ll‘
RARICK’S move came only
two weeks after Federal

Judge J. P. Wilson ruled in
another case that the Steel-

workers’ nominating pro-

cedures for international offi-
cers are illegal and violate the
rights of the membership un-
der the Landrum-Griffin act.

Judge Wilson declared null
and void ,, the election last
February of Kay Kluz as Dis-
trict 20 director in western
Pennsylvania. His ruling up-.

‘held a suitfiled, by. Nicholas-
‘Mamula, .who at the ‘times of
 — the election was president of ._

/. ‘ V‘ >,  ,.

« run for office,

Steel Local 1211 near Pitts-
burgh. Mamula protested the
election on the grounds that
the Steel constitution’s nomi-
nating procedures denied him
his right to appear on the bal-
lot against Kluz.

In 1957 Rarick, heading an

anti-McDonald slate, managed‘

to qualify for a place on the

ballot as-a candidate for pres- ,.

ident and shook up the top
Steel union brass by polling
more than a third of the total
vote cast. He later charged
that the election procedure
had “cost me the presidency.”
, Ilx 1!! 5l¢

WHEN Rarick tried to get
back on the ballot for the
1961 election he was blocked
by the Steel Constitution's re-
quirement that, in order to
a would-be
candidate must be nominated
by at least 40 locals.

At that time, his lawyer
said, Rarick sought to chal-
lenge the election through the
means then open to him but
finally had to drop his suit
for lack of funds. His present
move was to reopen the suit
in View of Judge Wilson's rul-
ing that the Steelworkers
nominating procedures are il-
legal. Rarick ‘maintained that

-he; was .not able” to get the .
__noniination» by _40 locals 

 

cause of these illegal pro-
cedures.
* >l< *

HERE are a few quotes
from the decision in which
J udge'Wilson upheld Steel Lo-
cal 1211’s former president
Mamula by ruling that the
District 20 election, was un-
democratic and illegal: ,

“Local 1211 furnishes a
good example of the deficient
procedures and what hap-
pened in many of the other lo-
cals with regard to the elec-
tion under discussion. . .”

“. . the local union hall
does not seat over five to six
hundred of a total member-
ship in excess of 11,000; The
selection of the Local 1211
nominee is done at one meet-
ing. . .”

“THE fact is and the evi-
dence shows that paid staff
members from the Interna-
tional headquarters appear at
the union meetings when In-
ternational officers are nomi-
natecl and direct that the pro-
cedure be conducted under the
Steelworkers’ c on s tit u t i on.
That procedure as has been
demonstrated is deficient , as
it provides no method nor
manner in. which all. members
may participate in the nomi-
nation 'and selection of the
union's candidate. . .' ‘V

Machinists

«End Strike
In Miami

MIAMI, Ariz.—-A 23-day
strike by International Asso-

4 ciation of Machinists L oc al

1342 at Inspiration Consolidat-
ed Copper Company here was
ended Oct. 19 on the original
terms offered by the company
before the strike began.

The Machinists, representing
140 workers, struck Sept. 27——
idling some 1,200 Inspiration

- employees under the jurisdic-

tion of Mine-Mill and nine
craft unions ‘who refused to
cross the picketlines.

* =1! *

SETTLEMENT terms were
the same as wage and fringe
benefit gains won by Mine-
Mill for most of the workers
last July and later negotiated
by the other unions at Inspira-
tion.

The IAM walkout was an
unilateral attempt to get more
money than what all the other
unions had already settled for,
using the honoring of IAM
picket lines as added pressure
for Local 1342's extra de-
mands.

/ These demands involved a
51-cent per day differential be-

tween Inspiration and Copper

Cities division of Miami Cop-
per which goes back to. World‘
War II when it was granted as
travel pay, and the pay differ-
ential between Inspiration and
Kennecott resulting from the
wage ‘equalization program ne-
gotiated by Mine-Mill and oth-
er unions in Kennecott. —

BOTH issues were finally.
dropped and g the settlement
followed.

Meanwhile, during the

- strike, 47 workers represented

by-the‘ same IAM Local" 1342
at nearby. Copper Cities since
1942 voted in an NLRB, elec-
tion on Oct. 11 to decertify the
IAM as their bargaining
agent. Of the 42 workers cast-
ing ballots, 30 voted for no
union.

Would-Be Raider Given
Hot Reception by Parr

DENVER—Tommy Parr, veteran Mine-Mill mem-
ber and-Recording Secretary of Local 16 in Great Falls,
Mont., wrote a letter to President Clark last month de-
scribing how he’d told off a caller who wanted to raid

Mine-Mill. _

The caller was Homer
Wilson, once a Mine-Mill
board member in the 40’s and
lately with the, Chemical
Workers union in the metal
trades.

Parr said: “I gave him a
piece of my mind in regards
to the Chemical Workers and
. That did
not faze him very much. He
then asked how Steel was
making out in Great Falls, so
I told him just like his or
any other Judas outfit will
make out.” "

“I WAS so mad,” Parr
wrote Clark‘, “I hope they
don’t take my phone out. I
wasn't very politic, you know.
I told him Mine-Mill sure
treated him alright when he
was board member, and he
sure had his nerve to try and

[raid the outfit that fed and
clothed him for so many
years. '

“I told him hepwas not con-
cerned about the welfare of

_ the rank and '_file members;

all he is interested in is the
dues money they or Steel or
anyone else can bleed out of
the members. I also said most
of our International officers
had come up through the
ranks and ‘understood our
smelter and mining problems
a damn sight better than
somebody in a plush chair in
Pittsburgh or New York. . .”

Parr added: “I told him
again, neither his outfit or
Steel could do the same kind
of job for our people as our
present officers can do, and
so far as I was concerned he
could go to Hell!”

  

LEAD AND ZINC prospects moved in different directions
last month. Two cuts of one-half cent brought the price of lead
down to ten cents per pound, the lowest since price controls
were removed in 1946. Factors in the price drop were poor
consumption of lead, bulging warehouse stocks, and a London

price for lead close to seven and one-half cents per pound. Im- »

porters and some U. S. sellers of lead had been offering dis-
counts, and U. S. producers feared competition from imports of
lead sheets, lead oxide and other fabricated products not subject
to quota.

The zinc picture is much more encouraging. Shipments of
slab zinc to galvanizers, brass mills and die casters hit a 27-
month high in October. Smelter inventories are down to about
six weeks supply—-lowest in a year and a half. The outlook
is for. continued strong demand from all major zinc using in-
dustries. Two major zinc producers have restored full price
premiums on special high-grade, high-grade and zinc-base die
casting alloys. - .

Trade sources see this a a possible first step in a basic
upward adjustment inzinc prices. Anaconda Company has been
quick to respond to improved conditions in zinc. The Great
Falls smelter, which had been operating only four zinc units,
brought three additional units back into production in October.
Seventy men were rehired._ At the same time, the East Helena
slag treatment plant was shifted from a five-day to a seven-day

week.

SENATOR MIKE MANSFIELD (D., Mont.) last month an-
nounced he intended to revive a proposal made in a letter to
President Kennedy last January to call an international copper
conference. ‘—

Object of the conference would be to stabilize world copper
production and consumption and thereby promote job seciirity
and steady employment for miners and smeltermen in the in-
dustry. At the request of the President, Sen. Mansfield’s pro-

posal has been under study in the Interior,» Commerce and Jus-

tice departments; V ,_
His proposal closely parallels a section of the federal legisla-

‘ tive program adopted by the Mine-Mill Executive Board last

January, calling for negotiation of international commodity
agreements in copper, lead and zinc. When Sen. Mansfield’s
proposal was made public, President Clark endorsed it in letters
to President Kennedy and the State, Interior and Commerce
departments. ' « G

INDIA has borrowed $20 million from the United States
government to buy copper, zinc. and aluminum in this country.

POLAND, a‘ minor producer of copper, has had to import
in recent years about two and a half times as much copper as
its mines produced. Last year, Polish mines produced an-esti-
mated 11,600 tons, according to the U. S. Bureau of Mines.

This situation will be changed radically’ with the develop-
ment of large, newly discovered copper deposits near Lubin,
in eastern Poland. Geologists are reported to estimate the
deposits, when developed, will support an annual production of

120,000 tons of electrolytic copper per year.
Czechoslovakia has granted Poland a loan to develop the

properties, which is to be repaid in refined copper beginning in

1969. .

ANACONDA COMPANY is setting up a new division to be
known as Anaconda Forest Products. The new division will
undertake a major expansion in the company’s western Mon-
tana lumbering operations carried on over 1,000 square miles,
of company-owned timber lands. ,

The company will modernize its saw mill at Bonner, Mon-
tana, and build a new planing mill and other finishing facili-
ties. Itwill become one of the west’s largest integrated logging,
milling, fabricating and selling forest products concerns.

ZINC refining capacity of Mexico will be more than dou-
bled by projects now on the planning boards. At present, Mexico
has only one zinc smelter, controlled by American Smelting and
Refining Co., with a capacity of about 50,000 tons per year.

The Mexican government has set up a company to build
a 30,000 ton-per-year refinery which is scheduled to go into
operation in April, 1964. Metalurgica Mexicana Penoles, 49%
owned by American Metal Climax, also is planning a 30,000
ton-per-year refinery. Mexico’s mine production of zinc cur-
rently is about 300,000 tons per year.

The plans for the new refineries are representative of a
strong trend that has set in in other Latin American countries-
as well, which wish to ship their raw materials in as highly
processed form as possible. ‘
