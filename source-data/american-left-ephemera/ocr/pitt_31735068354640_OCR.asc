' LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Diecast
workers here today ended their sixth
‘yveek of strike against three of the
“Big Five” diecasting companies, with‘
picket lines holding firm and disci-
pline tight.

The companies were trying to step
up their strike-breaking attempts by
encouraging outside unions to raid at

least one of the plants, in the hope of‘

making a “back-door deal” to bust the
union in the shop.
C The raiding maneuver was being
handled, none too adroitly, by H. De-
.Voe Rae, head of the so-called Biddle
Trades Bureau, an outfit with 9. long
record of strike-breaking activities.
Rae is the “spokesman” for four out
of the five big diecast companies—-Har-
yill, Union Universal and L. A.

the cold shoulder to agents from the
AFL Machinists Union who circulated
among the pickets in a vain effort to
obtain signatures on cards and peti-
tions. “The company union Went out
of Harvill in 1940,” commented Jack
Millikan, picket captain, “after failing
miserably to do anything for Harvill
Workers."

Pic'kets~ at the struck plants—Har-
vill, Anderson and Union—are being
strengthened regularly by visits by
workers from the two other diecast
plants-—Universal and L. A.

One example of the solidarity among
the strikers was the case of Winton
Madden and Dick Smith, on strike
against Harvill. Madden and Smith

DENVER.—The strong possi-
bility of a nationwide strike in
the non-ferrous metals industry
loomed last week, as Mine-Mill’s
National Wage Policy Committee
was called to meet here Wednes-
day, August 15, to set strike
dates and round out strike
strategy.

The call went out to the 22-
man Policy Committee within 24
hours after a ballot tabulation
showed an overwhelming major-
ity of Mine-Mill members in fa-
vor of strike action to back up

‘their demands, and on the same

day that negotiations were
broken off at the Kennecott Cop-
per Co. in Utah.

Meantime the Federal Concili-
ation & Mediation Service late
last week set up a series of “con-
ciliation panels” for several sec-
tions of the non-ferrous metals
industry, in a last minute at-
tempt to bring the operators and
Mine-Mill negotiators back into
discussion. .

THE FIRST of these meetings
arranged by the _ Conciliation
Service was set for last Friday
(August 10) in Butte, Montana.
Four federal conciliators were
due to sit down in talks with
Anaconda Copper Co. executives
and Mine-Mill’s Montana ACM
negotiators.

In Phelps-Dodge, a session
with the Conciliation Service was
set for Saturday and Sunday
(August 11-12) in Douglas, Ari-
zona. ,

And in Kennecott, negotiators
for both the company and Mine-
Mill were scheduled to enter dis-
cusions with federal conciliators
on Tuesday, August 14, in Salt
Lake. City.

Similar meetings were being
arranged by the Federal Concili-
ation Service for later this week
with the American Smelting &
Refining Co., the American Brass
Co., with Coeur D’Alene, Idaho,

district operations, and in the

. Miami, Arizona area.

It was impossible to predict
the outcome of these efforts by
the Conciliation Service, but up
until a few hours before the first
session began, there was no in-
dication that the companies were
prepared to budge from their
stubbom refusal to make an ade-
quate offer.

“WE’VE DONE EVERY-
THING we know how to reach a
friendly and peaceable settlement
of our wage and contract de-
mands,” declared Vice president
Orville Larson, Mine-Mill’s na-
tional bargaining coordinator.
“So far as We can see right now,
we’ve just about come to the end
of the line. The operators seem
to be determined to force us to
take a walk.”

The tempo of events speeded
up to fever pitch immediately
following the mid-July meetings
of the Wage Policy Committee
and chainwide Bargaining Coun-
cils. Delegates returning from
the sessions reported to enthusi-
astic local and district-wide met-
ings from one end of the Inter-
-national Union to the other.

The overall plan of making a-

last-ditch effort to obtain an ade-
quate offer from the industry,
and at the same time begin
preparations for strike action,
was quickly approved by locals
across the nation.

THE SECRET STRIKE refer-
endum taken August 1, 2, 3, and
4, was the first ever held on a
nationwide basis in the ‘58-year
history of Mine-Mill. A tabula-
tion of the votes showed the
membership voting by a major-
ity of 85 per cent in favor of
strike, if necessary. As the last
ballot was counted, Int’l presi-
dent John Clark commented:

“We now have a mandate from

‘ our members to call -a strike if

ANSONIA, Conn. — Ansonia Brass
Workers Union, Local 445, is taking

the l.eadership, along with the local

branchof the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People,

I in a: campaign against Jim Crow at

the "Ansonia; YMCA.
The campaign was started when Vin-
cent Drake, outstanding Negro athlete
—at—' Ansonia High School, was barred
front the “Y” by Arthur Whettredge,
General Secretary‘ of the YMCA, ‘who

I claimed he was acting on orders from

the YMCA Board of Directors.

John Gatison,. Jr.. civil rights com-
mittee chairman of \Local 445, wrote
Whettredge urging a meeting .of the
union’s committee: with the ‘Board of
Directors “in order to resolve this
very. serious problem.”

“When we'ask our membership to
contribute generously to the Commu-
nity’ Chest, of which the YWCA is a
part, we do not ask them their color
or creed-—but only to contribute gen-
erously for the good and welfare of
all organizations within the»Commu-
nit-y Chest,” Gatison pointed out.

Henry Rapuano, Mine-Mill Interna-
tional Representative here, is co-chair-
man. of the locale NAACP’ branch.
Rapuano and co-chairman Rev. Julian
A. Taylor also wrote Whettredge de-
manding a meeting -with the “Y” di-
rectors. ’

9 The reputation of the U. S. Supreme
Courtihas sunk to the lowest point in
100- years. -

Every member of the labor move-
ment has known that “something was
cockeyed?’ in the Supreme Court which
only a few short years ago, under
Franklin D. Roosevelt, was ’ handing
downuso many decisions in favor of
the. common ‘man.

‘Now comes LOOK magazine, in the

‘issue of July 31, with the fullstory
" of’ what.’s happened’ to the Supreme

Court since Harry Truman became
Pmsident.

'H'l7E_ LOOK ARTICLE is'7,written by
Yale. University Law Professor Fred
Rodell‘ and titled: ‘..‘Our Not So Su-
preme Court.” Rodel says: _

“The Supreme Court of the United
States today belies its awe-inspiring.
title. Degraded by President Trumarfs
devil-may-care appointment. of four
justices. whose work has ranged from
mediocre to miserable, the Court has‘
sunle to- its lowest point in a hundred
years; . .

“When Truman chose Harold H-.

‘Burton, Fred M. Vinson, Tom C. Clark .

and Sherman Minton, it was clear, that
their’ major qualification for the na-
tion’s" top judicial jobs was that they
were old cronies of the ’President. To-
day, it is clear that a nine-man Court
weighed down by so sad a quartet can-
not ’-or will not properly perform its
high function. .
“To say this is not to make apoliti-
cal‘ judgement based on the undoubted-
ly rightish slant of all four Truman
justices. The Nine Old Men of Con-I
servatism, back in the 1920’s and 30's,

I - won the reluctant respect even of lib-
_erals~ who disliked their decisions, _by.
their integrity and solid legal ability.

“The Nine Young Men of New Deal-
ism, during the 40’s, won the grudging
admiration of even the most moss-
backed legal observers by their in-

\dustry and their craftsmanship in the

law.-

“But the Truman-Vinson Court,
judged both by the quantity of work
it takes on and by the quality of its
work, has branded itself—conser'vatism
aside—as incompetent, indolent and ir-
responsible.” '

Prof. Rodell reveals that under Chief

Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the
' Court’ used to hand down opinions on

over 200 cases a term. In' the 1950-51

 term, under Vinson, it handled 86

cases, only one out of every 10 brought

j I before it.

PART OF THIS is incompetence, Ro-
dell says, part is “sheer laziness.” Last

3 ,winter- the court took a six-week vaca-

 

tion,' although it only works eight
months of the year anyway, and “cav-
alierly refused to take on” a number
of cases involving. “vitallyimportant
issues.”

Among the cases ducked by the
Court was one involving Stuyvesant
Town-—a huge housing project in New
York built and owned by the Metro-
politan Life Insurance Co. A Negro
was refused an apartmenhthere be-
cause of  color.

He went to court on grounds that
under the U. S; Constitution the gov-
ernment. cannot discriminate against
Negroes and Stuyvesant Town is in
fact partly a government project since
it received government. help in con-
demning land and is exempt- from
taxes. .

The legal problem was tough, the
issue w-as national in scope, but the
court refused tohear the case.
< LOOK lays themain responsibility for
the Court’s “shoddy. p.erformance”. on
Chief Justice Vinson, “an old political
pal of Tvruman’s and allegedly his
choice forthe White House if Truman
himself does’ not run. 4’ l

“A rather undistinguisleed fz‘-ve-year
record on a Federal court ofuppcals
had magde it clear that judgi'ny wds1n’t
Vinson’s. greatest talent.”

EVEN LESS productive is Burton, a
Republican and a “member of the
Preside1Lt’s old and favorite club, the
U. S. Senate.”

“Burton,” says LOOK, “is a person-
ally decent, bumbling" plodder . . .
His fuzzy and long-winded opinions,
full of imrelevancies and usually on
unimportant matters, have been for-
tunately few.” ‘

Clark and’ VMinton are a “pair of
lightwe-*ights,” who caused the caliber
of the Court. to.fall “mo/re precipi-

II. S.‘ Supreme Court exposed, 

tously than at any single point in its
histo-ry . . . A

“Clark, of course, was a. close Tru-
man. crony who had helped sponsor his
campdigu. for the Vice Presidency and
had been. rewarded with the Attorney-
Generalship shofrtly after Truman
went to the White House; elevation to
the Court presumably was promised
at that time. On the Court, Clarlc’s
opinions soon revealed a. shallow and
word-minded approach to problems dud
often a stwrk incompreheusiou ..of un-
derlying issues.” * ‘

Minton’s work on the Court hasbeen
“sloppy, pedestrian and frequently
off-the-paint. Nevertheless, he is prob-
ably the least inept of‘ Truman’s four
justices.” .
\ Of the Roosevelt appointees, LOOK
says Stanley F. Reed has clearly gone

‘along with the Vinson group in cut-

ting the workload of the»Cou,rt, and
Felix-»Frankfurber,' a “b'm'll2'a/nt legal
scholar,” has ‘furnished-. the intellec-
tual front. for-_ the Court's cu'r7'ent
slowdown.”

This leaves; threejustices “who com-
bine top-fllglzt: legal, ability. with a
sense of judicial responsibility.”

Robert H. J ackson, conservative de-
spite his New Deal background, is
forthright, but has not “protested

‘against the new take-2't—easy policy."

Hugo Black and William 0. Douglas.

These two are -effectively muzzled,-

denied even the opportunity to write

‘a dissent, whenever the Court ducks

Rodell concludes: “On the plainface
of the record to date, the Truman-
Vinsou Court has not only carried its
im-o.mpeteuc'e into irresporzsibllity but
has also stretched its conservatism to
the point of cowardice.”

EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.——Epmenio
Rodriguez, most seriously injured.
Mine-Mill mem_ber of all those attacked
by goon raiders, is back at work in
the American Zinc smelter here. But-
not at his old ‘job. >

Because Brother Rodriguez is unable
to perform any work requiring much.
exert-ion, Local 82‘ arranged for him-
to get a light janitor-’s job.

In June, 1949, when the CIO-Ship
union was raiding Local 82 during the.
course of our 13-month strike, Roda.-
riguez and-’ Joe (“Shorty”'). Petroski
were shot by an official of the C10 ,
Gas, Coke & Chemical Workers, Pal- 
mer Ryan. Rodriguez rushed forward,
attempting_to seiz"e. Ryan’s gun, anda‘ I
received a bullet apparently intended
for Allen (“Buck”) Reid, one of the
strike leaders.

RODRIGUEZ. was hospitalized for
months. Doctors who performed two
operations to save a damaged, kidney
despaired of saving him.

In addition to paying all medical
‘and hospital -expenses, Local 82 paid‘
Brother Rodriguez an amount each. I
week equal to his regular wages. This
was continued for wo years—until the
injured man was able to return to
work.

“I am not sorry I made [this sadn-
fice for Mine-Mill,” said Brother Rod-
riguez last week. “This is the best.
union I know of. Any good union -man
would fight for it and sacrifice to
save it.”

BAYARD, N. M.—The eleven-month
strike of Mine-Mill Local 890 against

the Empire Zinc Co. is still on, the
company's operation is still shut down
tight, and the workers and their wives
and families are still determined to
win. -

That was the word here last week,
as another rapid-fire. series of events
came to a climax and the strike be-
gan to settle down to “normal”: once
more-—for the time being at least.
Highlights of the last two weeks in-
cluded: -

O Rejection by the Company of an of-
fercby New Mexico’s Gov. Edwin Mech-
em to mediate the long-standing dis-
pute. The Company said that it would
prefer to have the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service as a “third
party” to try and settle the issues. The
union had accepted Mechem’s 0 er
within an hour after it was made.

0 Flat refusal by the-Company to
budge an inch from its stubborn stand
on the basic strike issues, when man-
agement and union representatives met
in El Paso, Texas, at the suggestion of
the union. The Company continued to

evade any kind of proposal on the un-

ion’s demand for the 8-hour collar-to-
collar day and for paid holidays.

0 Rejection by the Company of an
offer made by Local 890, in the public
interest, to join with the Company in
submitting all the outstanding strike
issues to an arbiter appointed, by the
Federal Conciliation & Mediation Serv-
ice, with both sides to be bound by the
decisions of the arbiter.

0 Acquittal of ~Marvin Mosley, a
“special deputy”. for the Empire Zinc
Co., on charges of assault and battery
against Mrs. Elvira Molano, 59-year-
old wife of a striker. Mos1ey_ was
freed by Justice-of-the-peace R. 0.
Day. Charges filed against other com-
pany-paid gunmen were still to be
heard. _

O Levying of heavy fines and jail
sentences against six strike leaders and
the union itself by district judge A. W.
Marshall, who said they_ were guilty

‘ of “contempt of court.”, The fines of

$4,000 were imposed on Local 890 and
the International Union on the claim
the union had violated Marshall’s in-
junction restraining them from “block-
ing the road” leading to the struck
mines at .Hanover. (See pictures of
the “road.” on page. 6.

0 Conviction of Int’l
treasurer M. E. Travis and Int’l rep.
Clint Jencks on charges of “contempt.”

1 (See ,story on Page 6.)

The‘ trial before Judge Marshall

;,made legal ‘history in Grant County V
.. I when the umon attorneys, Nathan Witt

secretary-

and David Serna, and the defendants
refused to participate further in the
proceedings after Marshall overruled a
defense motion to dismiss the case on
grounds that the court’s granting of a
permanent injunction made any pro-
ceedings underithe earlier temporary
order illegal. They walked out of the
courtroom. '

CHARGING THAT “law and order

in Grant County have broken down,”'

Witt said: “Our clients’ confidence in
the administration of justice in this
county is more or less at an end. They
have seen women and children attacked
by special deputies; they have been the
victims of unreasonable bail and war-
rant provisions. The sheriff’s office
has violated at least one statute and
perhaps others. We will have to seek
justice elsewhere.”

Company lawyers tried to show that
the union was using some mysterious
method of strike direction to prevent
scabs from crossing the picketline. Int’l
rep. Clint Jencks and Local 890 vice
president Ernest Velasquez testified
that the union has not had direction of

I

the picketline since June 11, when
Marshall issued his temporary injunc-
tion. , ~ -

One union witness said: ‘‘All of
Grant County knows that the women of
this county have been running that
picketline since June 11. They man the
picketline, they have charge of it—it’s
their show.”

Velasquez said: “We asked our
wives if they thought we_ should
knuckle down and give up the strike.
They told us, ‘Hell, no, you guys go
home and mind the kids and clean the
house and wash the dishes. We're tak-
ing over this strike. We’ll not give
up now.’ And that’s what we fellows
did. And that’s what our wives did.”

The union's biggest victory in re-
cent days came when the company-paid
“deputies” were withdrawn from the
area and replaced bystate policemen.
Mrs. Molano commented:

“Since the Empire Zinc gunmen
have been taken away, there has been
no trouble on the piclcetline. The state
police have not been herding scabs, as
the v company-paid gunmen . did. Now

Steel I signs sell-out contract
at P-D Laurel Hill plant

NEW YORK CITY—The CIO Steel-
workers——who last year raided the
Laurel Hill Phelps-Dodge refinery-—
have now signed a contract with P-D

which amounts to a complete sellout of.’

the Laurel Hill workers.

In line with the usual tactics of C10
Steel, the contract was negotiated—-
and signed—if1 complete secrecy. Ed
Murphy, the Mine-Mill traitor who en-
gineered the Steel raid» last year,
worked out the demands in secret, ne-
gotiated them in secret in coopera-
tion with Steel president Phil Murray,
and signed in secret. _

At presstime for THE UNION,‘ nei-
ther the rank-and-file workers or the
shop stewards at the Laurel Hill re-
finery knew anything about the signing
of the contract—and indeed insisted
that no agreement had been signed.

A PROPOSED CONTRACT was sup-
posed to'be submitted to the member-
ship 6n August 17 for their ratifica-
tion. However, this gesture is mean-
ingless, since the agreement has al-
ready been signed and sent to the
Wage Stabilization Board for ap-
proval. 1

Phelps-Dodge‘ spokesmen in Wash-
ington claimed the Laurel Hill‘ contract
amounts to 11'/; cents in increases.

- _Actually'it is worth less than a dime,

broken down as follows: 5 cents hourly

a

wage increase across the board; 2'/;
cents to adjust ineqpities; a‘ third
week's vacation after 15 years; 1 cent
in insurance;~and shift differentials in-
creased to 5 cents and 10 cents.

The joker in the wage increase pro-
vision comes in the clause providing

that any pension plan which Phelps-A

Dodge inaugurates on a chain—wide
basis will go into effect in Laurel Hill.
But up to 4 cents of the cost of the
pension plan will be deducted from the
5 cent wage increase.

It was noted that Murphy and the
Steel Union at Laurel Hill have ac-
cepted a contract which embodies less
than was rejected by-the Steel union

at the Garfield AS&R ‘operation in

Utah. .

CARTERET, N. J. —— Members of
Mine-Mill Local 837 here were clearing
the decks for action in accordance with
the nationwide Mine-Mill program,
after rejecting an offer from U. S.
Metals worth 141/; cents.

The offer included a flat 6 per cent
wage increase, worth 9!”; cents an hbur,
plus 4 cents for added insurance bene-
fits. In addition, the company agreed
to pay supplemental wages, over and
above workmens compensation bene-
fits, to make up full pay for any work-
er injured on the job, for a period-of
six weeks.

The.overwhelming majority vot-
ing for strike action demon-
strates that _ our membership is

asking us every day: ‘When do

‘ NEW.YORK (FP)—Industry profits
are keeping up with the sensational
records of 1950 despite '-‘the application
of the excess profits tax,’ the National
City Bank of New.York revealed in a
'survey of 515 corporations.

Reporting‘ A on corporate net " profits

for the first, six months of 1951, the
bank’s August/ newsletter . disclosed

they were 3% higher than the similar

period in 1950, reaching a total of '$2,- . .

584,000,000. Profits in 1950 broke.all

previoiis, records.

Notable ‘among the industrialgroupsi ‘

showing big increases. in profits were
oil, chemicals, paper, machinery, rail-

_way equipment, office equipment and

various other ‘metal goods.

BIGGEST PROFITS were made isy V

18 oil firms, whose net take of $629,-
438,000 for the first half of 1951 were
43% higher than a-year ago. Profits
of 22 pulp, and‘ paper products com-

’ Profits hit new highs 

panies were $64,682,000, an increase
of 48%. Sharpest increase was regis-

ptered by 12 railway equipinent manu-

facturers, whose,_profits soared» 71%

‘to $29,992,000. ,
The newsletterg. said that “the feel-

HERE ARE WORD FOR WORD ex-
tracts from official minutes of, the
meeting of the Westinghouse Confer-
ence of the CIO's A“Imitation” United
Electrical Workers Union, CIO-IUE,
set up last year by_ C105 sgcretary-
treasurer James Carey. . V

The minutes tell a sordid story of
how the IUE kingpins used their power.
to renew a sell-out agreement’ withr
Westinghouse Corporation, against ‘the
wishes of .;their membership. ,Here’a
the background; ' 1 '

In»1950, IUE’sign'ed an agreement

scuttling the old UE’ contract _protec-

tions on seniority, time values ‘and’ ,,_.
grievance procedure. In the East Pifcts- ‘ ‘E:

Now IUE-CIO has renewed‘ this hat- = 
edcontract to October, 1952, without ’
any changeat all. The IUE Conference
Board minutes ‘reprinted at the left;
tell, why. Obviously, the only thing
that worries James Carey is the -fact

_ that .W_estinghouse workers are in re- ._
volt» against ‘IUE sell-outs, and want
to return to UE——the union that or-
ganized them in the first place. A . 

Carey rushed ;.into this collusive deal '  l
with , Westinghouse in ordei-’to keep ., .
the workers tied up in IUE. .He tried _ _ 
to do the same thing with IUE ‘work-' 5
ers in General Electric. L. R. Boul-
ware, GE vice president, "gave away
the‘ whole'- story in a letter to ,IUE
president James Carey June 21, in
which Boulware said: o ' A 3

“. . . we are a little surpx'-ised- at

Referring -to the ‘policies of the"old, War Labor Board, Dunlop
" states and we quote: . -i ——- .

“The Wage stabilization‘ program involvedthe skillful 
use of delay in-making changes in policy. . . '. One of the prin-
cipal objectives of stabilization is to-slow down the rate of V ’
change.” 7 (Change being the amount of wage ',increases«

“Delay the handling of cases may involve‘ heavy risks.

we are quoting further. .‘_‘It is exceedingly‘ difficult. to
determinehow large a part of the delay was a conscious policy

treasurer Maurice Travis said last week

in a statement before district judge_

D. W. Carmody.

Travis came from Denver‘to appear
voluntarily as a defendant, alongwith
Int’l rep. Clinton Jencks and Local 890
president Cipriano Montoya, on charges
of “criminal contempt” in connection
with an injunction against the union
issued_by Judge Marshall in June.

Travis was given a suspended sen-
tcnce of 6 months in jail and $100 fine;
Jencks was given a 60-day suspended
sentence and $100 fine; Montoya was
acquitted. ~

The union’s secretary-treasurer was
accused of contempt for having stated
at a Local 890 meeting atteiided by
.2,000 workers that “workers do not
have the kind of money to relinquish

Jencks’ alleged “contempt” consisted‘

By Howard-Goddard
I nternational‘ Representative

_ TRONA, Calif.-—Let the experience
of Alkaline Salt Workers Local 414
serve as guide to all other local unions
which might consider inviting one
Michael I. Komaroff of Los Angeles to’
act -as “impartial arbitrator” of any
dispute.

Komaroff was agreed upon by Local
414 as the arbitrator in three cases
against the American Potash and

Chemical Corp. In each-of the three '

cases the Union presented. what it con-
sidered to be a preponderance of evi-
dence in proof of its contention. that
the company was deliberately violat-_.

‘ . ingthe contract in each instance.

After much delay and expense to
the Union,‘Komaroff finally issued his
awards in the three cases, giving two
to the company and one to the Union.
‘Members of Local 414 felt that this
kind of a split was bad enough, but
imagine their chagrin when a few
days later Komaroff announced that
he was reversing his award in the

' third case and giving that one’ to the.

company, too. ,
, Komaroff based his reversal on “evi-
“deuce” brought in by a..company law-
yer who was a member of the arbi-
tration board. The so-called evidence
was introduced following the comple-
tion of the hearings so that the union
had no opportunity to cross-examine
or refute. ',
Local 414~has instituted legal pro-
ceedings thrgughi its attorney, Milton
Tyre of Los Angeles, to have theélat-
ter award invalidated and the original
award enforced. _
KOMAROFF HAS a liberal back-
ground which is apt to deceive. Hgiwas
a field examiner of the old NLRB
prior to ‘T-H. Since that time he acted
as the impartial arbitrator between
the Furniture Workers-Union" and the
furniture manufacturers association in
Los Angeles. In that capacity he
achieved a reputation for fairness until
recently, when his decisions have been ‘
lopsidedly in favor of _the.employers.
The turning point in Komaroff’s ca-

tr reer seems to have been reached re-

cently’=when he was appointed to the
position of permanent arbitiator be-
tween the UAW and North American
Aircraft in Southern California- The
attorneys for North, American are the
notoriously anti-union Los Angeles
firm of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher

aheaded by Stuart .f‘Slugger”‘ Neary.

Coincidentally, Neary also represents
American Potash and Chemical.

The’ sympathies of Local 414 are ex-
tended to members of the UAW in
North American-’s Southern California
plants. They arelstuck with Komaroff

for some time to come.

check which paid for the program in
question. 1,

In his, declaration before Judge
, Carmody, Travis said:

'‘‘When I spoke befo-re our Local
Union lzere,gI made my statements out
of the profound conviction that in-
junctions are a device used solely to
break strikes. When I spoke of a
company buying an injunction, this is
wh.at was meant: They can buy gun-
men to provoke violence on the picket
line. They can hire high-priced cor-
poration lawyers. Then they can go
into court and claim that an injunc-
tion is required in order tahalt the
violence which they themselves -have
provoked.

“Insofar as Judge\1lIarshall was
concerned, my statement was not in-
tended to indicate whether he was
honest or dishonest. As a matter of
fact, Judge Marshall was not even
mentioned.” ‘

Summarizing the history of the use
of injunctions in breaking labor
strikes, 2I‘ravi_s pointed to the fact that
the coal miners, over .a period of years,
once developed the slogan: “Bayonets
will never dig coal.” ‘

,“Even the most conservative lead-
ers of this nation beca-me convinced by
the late 1920s that the injunction was
ah unjust and discriminatory weapon,”
he‘ went .—.on. “Therefore the Norris- I
LaGuard-ia anti-injunction act was 4
passed in 1932. Since the protection of
this act was cancelled out in 1947 by
the Taft-Hartley law, there has not
been a single important labor dispute
in which the injunction ;hasn’t been
-used. ' / ‘

“This company (Empire Zinc) has
been trying to mine lead and zinc in
the courtroom. And there is no lead
_and zinc to be found here. If they
continue to do this, the Empire Zinc
mine at Hanover will never be op-
ened—-not this year, ornext year, or
any year.”

Following" the sentencing, Nathan
Witt} Mine-Mill's General Counsel,
commented: “Today the people of
Grant County have seen two amend-
ments of the Constitution of the United
States violated. The First Amendment
guaranteeing freedom A of speech and
the’ 14th Amendment guaranteeing due
process of law have been -violated by
the court in this trial. None of the
defendants has disobeyed any specific
statutes of the'State or Federal Con-
stitutions. They are not even cited un-
der any specific laws. This is what
happens when any member of the ju-
diciary puts himself above criticism or
publiccomment. Judges are servants
of the public, not immune to public
opinion or discussion.” ’

To the Editor:
' Mankind has climbed a hard and
sorrowful. ladder over hundreds of
~years of‘ existence. Often retarded by
;the dark’ forces of reaction, ignorance,
"and superstition. Mankind has always
,overcome these obstacles and pro-
igressed with enlightenment, brother-
 hood and tolerance. At times unable to
produce enough food for its existence,
_‘ great numbers died of starvation, suf-

Do we fear peace?
To the Editor:

Letters to the Open‘ Forum make it
abundantly clear that labor as a group
does not want war. Labor has always
made it clear it wants full employment.
Now. just how this price system of ours
is to provide us with peace and full
employment at the same time is not so
clear. This is the question we all must
solve before we can have peace. if

Labor blames the big shots for war;
yet labor creates the sinews of war,
provides the men behind the gun and
being in ‘the majority we provide the

majority support of this system, a"

system that requires war for its sur-
vival. '

We are just as afraid of peace as
the big shots; we know peace threatens
full employment. Let’s be honest with
ourselves, we fear peace. We don’t
want war; we at least know what we
do not want. '

Labor has sufficient numbers to stop
the ravages of war and stop the de-
pressions of peace. But to do the job
requires a solid front for the purpose
of social. and economic reconstruction
on this continent. '

As the big shots have tossed the
first ball by conscription of our men,
it’s now up to us to toss it right back.
This can be done by a united demand
for total conscription of money,’ ma-
chines, material and men.

This action would remove the profit
‘from war, by 'putting all on the same
income level, would remove the risks
of peace by all being on an income.
Who can object?

Tlwousands. jobless
Pacldng workers. hit
hard by July floods

CHICAGO (FP)-—-The homes and
jobs of thousands of packinghouse
workers have been wiped out by‘ .the
billion-dollar flood rampaging across
the L midwest. L

Describing the disaster as a “major
catastrophe,” Pres. Ralph Holstein of
the’ United -Packinghouse Workers
(C10) in a special appeal declared:
“The tragedy of it for us is that it is
our membership that bears the brunt.
Every available resource of our in-
ternational, our districts and our mem-

bership outside“ the flood, areas ‘must.
be thrown in immediately.”

The union has set up ﬂood relief
centers at its 10 district headquarters
and at the offices of its affiliated lo-

- cals. g“-‘We have over 2,100 homeless

packinghouse Workers in Kansas City
and Topeka,” Helstein said in his ap-
peal for food, clothing, household goods
and funds. - ,

WORKERS in the area lost every-
thing they owned, in some cases sal-
vpaging-only a dress, shirt or jacket
as they fled in front of the menacing
water. What the floods didn’t get was
lost in gasoline and oil fires, spread-
ing over the water and covering whole
city blocks in suffocating smoke and
flames. '

The flood forced all packing plants

_ in Kansas City and Topeka to shut
down, confronting packinghouse work- .

ers with a long stretch of unemploy-
ment and added hardship. So severe

was the damage to plants in _the.area .

that it was doubted whether some will
ever ‘reopen.

It was estimated that 7,000 packing
workers in Kansas City and 1,500 in
Topeka are without jobs. Prospects of
getting back to work in the next few
months are bleak.

A special relief appeal was also sent
out by the Intl. Assn. of Machinists
(AFL), which said 6,000 IAM families
had been hit by the Kansas City flood.

-Calling on all lodges to aid the flood

victims, the IAM said it had set up an
emergency rrlécf committee for, its
members. _ __ r

Nogales parley to pay tribute

  to M-M’s Sou

NOGALES, Ariz.-—‘-Unlike the rau-
cous playboy-meetings of the American
Legion and the cut-and-dried political
clambakes of the Democratic and Re-
publican parties, Mine-Mill, conven-
tions are working conventions. And
the 47th convention of the union which
opens here Monday, Sept. 10, at the
Rancho Grande hotel will be no dif-
ferent. _

Mine-Mill delegates, as always, will
be busy day and night hammering out
a program that is represenative of the
opinions of the great Mine-Mill mem-
bership throughout the United States
and Canada.

Nevertheless, the union has always
soughtto hold its conventions in cities
and areas that are attractive to the
visitor as well as being situated,
wherever ‘possible, close to a section
of the union’s membership.

THERE ARE TWO CITIES’ named
Nogales. One'is in Arizona, divided
by an international fence from No-
gales, Sonora, Mexico. The twin cities
are closely integrated, commercially
and socially. Together they constitute
a commercial center for a large agri-
cultural area extending into both coun-

. tries.

Nogales, Ariz., is in Santa Cruz
county, often called the “Sun Deck of
the Border.” The city is surrounded
by high mesa or table land. Dust free
air and the absence of humidity are
ideal for those who suffer from asth-
ma, arthritis, and similar ailments.

Nogales has been for centuries the
crossroad of ‘travel between Arizona
and Mexico-. An all-paved road leads
to Hermosillo'(175 miles) and Guay-
mas (260 miles) in the interior of
Mexico.

AFTER THE negotiating meeting,
the ABC Council reconvened and
worked out a hard-hitting program of
action. Key feature of this program
was a detailed plan for setting up
strike committees in each of the ABC
locals. A full report on the negotiat-
ing meeting and the Council session
was made by telephone to the Mine-
Mill leaders at Anaconda properties
in Montana. And the delegates unani-
mously agreed to continue the high

degree of coordination with other ACM —

locals.

a tremendous modernization and in-
dustrialization program for the past
several years.-Guaymas is an old sea-
port in a near—tropical climate beside
one of the finest deep—sea fishing
grounds of the American continent.

The average yearly rainfall in No-
gales is 15 inches. The average num-
ber of days of sunshine per year is
318. ‘It has an altitude of 4,000 feet.
Its days are balmy, its nights cool.
September begins its period of best

The headquarters of this year’s con-
vention will be the Rancho Grande ‘ho-
tel, perched high on a mountain near
Nogales. Despite its “dude ranch” at-
mosphere, splashed with western color

' and informality, Rancho Grande offers

the finestgind most modern accommo-
dations in the Southwest. Guest rooms,
each with tiled bath, are decorated in
the western mood. Thoughtful effort
has been taken to give each room an
appealing, trim attractiveness with
none of the jarring influences of ‘im-
posing and ostentatious design so typ-
ical of “big city” hotels. -

TWO OTHER HOTELS will also
house Mine-Mill delegates during the
convention. They are the Montezuma
in downtown Nogales, Ariz., and the
Fray Marcos de Niza, in downtown
Nogales, Sonora. The former is a two-
minute walk from the border. The
latter ispa luxury hotel, modern and
only a block or two from the American
line.

There are several famous eating
places available for Mine-Mill dele-
gates. In addition to the Duncan
Hines-approved Rancho Grande and
the Cavern, on the Mexican side, there
are other restaurants providing a
variety of fare.

A tourist permit is required for
those traveling for pleasure in Mexico
and is obtained from the Mexican con-
sul in ‘your home town or at the
border. V

Chicago local fights
trolley fare hike '

CHICAGO, Ill.—Mine—Mill Local 758
is playing its part in the fight of the
Chicago Council for Labor Unity to
hold down Chicago trolley and elevated
fares.

The Council has filed a suit in cir-
cuit court, asking for an order restrain-
ing the Chicago Transit Authority
from putting into effect trolley fares
of 17 cents, elevated fares of 18 cents
and children’s fares of 8 cents.

Chicago trolley-riders are already
paying the highest fares in the nation.
Mine-Mill, as one of the six unions in
the Council for Labor Unity, /joined in

Athesuit petitioning for an injunction

to block the new fare hold—up.

help out. After two days, a hot die
came out of the Harvill plant to their
new shop. Both brothers picked up
their tools and walked out on a $2.50
an hour job——rather than work on any
dies or tools from a struck plant.

WHEN HARVILL management re-
fused to pay vacation money due the
strikers, Local 700 promptly filed a
complaint with the state labor com-
mission. It Wasn't long before Harvill
was sending out the vacation checks to
its striking employees.

A meeting held last week in the of-
fice of the Federal Conciliation Service
in Los Angeles drew a complete blank
after the management spokesman, H.
DeVoe Rae said bluntly: “We are not
serious about wanting a contract with
your union.” The meeting had been
called on the strength of a letter writ-
ten by Rae on July 24 in which he said:
“representatives of management stand
ready and willing to meet at reason-

’ able times upon call of the Conciliator,

or at such other times as may be de-
sired by the interested parties.“

Local 700 has filed unfair labor prac-
tice charges against the “Big Five”
for its refusal to engage in good faith
bargaining as required by federal law.

The Los Angeles City Attorney has
received for prosecution the union’s
charge that the Harvill and Anderson

companies violated the California La-.,

bor Code when they advertised for fe-
male 'help in an obvious effort to re-
cruit scab help.

Solid financial support for the strike
is coming from a number of sources,
including not only the other Mine-Mill
shops in Los Angeles, but also the In-

ternational Union which sent a check '

for $500 from its Strike Fund. _
The Fishermen’s Union is arranging
for supplies of fresh fish to be made
available to the strikers at no cost,
with arrival of the first boats return-
ing from Mexican waters. Financial
help has also come from the Long-
shoremen’s & Warehousemen’s Union.
Jack Marcotti, executive secretary of
Local 700, said “We understand from
an inside, reliable source, that diecasl:
managements have just about got a
stomach full of trying to operate their
plants with the scabs and stewbums

they have recruited. .

“The managements are beginning to
get their eyes open enough to see the

bill of goods they bought as a formula. "

for breaking our union is pretty costly
and is backfiring on them.”
