July 31 Referendum Vote      
Defeats Probosed Contract   

In a referendum Vote on July 31, 35,000 striking

members of the International Association of Machinists
overwhelmingly rejected a settlement pact worked out
by top negotiators and endorsed by President Johnson.
Although the proposed terms reportedly called for across-
the-board wage hikes of 56 cents per hour over a three-
year period for 19,000 mechanics and pay raises for
16,000 other workers equivalent -percentagewise to the
mechanics’ increases, the proposal lacked a cost-of-living
escalator clause and pension improvements, and deferred
many of the non-wage benefits to the second and thir

years.

-Rejection‘ of the settlement was said to have been
based on those shortcomings. I
Pending in the House of Representatives, as this

passed bill, vehemently opposed

by labor, which would order the

strikers back to work for 30

days-——a period which could later

be extended by President John-
son. .

Widely varying estimates put
the percentage gainrepresented

by the rejected package. at be-

tween 4.4 and 7 percent. .Tl1e
settlement put forward by a
mediation panel headed by Sen.

Wayne Morse (D-Ore.) was said ,

to have been -Valued at 3.6 per-
cent. v
Terms -of Proposal
Under terms of the proposed
settlement, about 8,000 flight
line mechanics, inspectors and

crew chiefs would have received -

an extra 5 cents on top of the
56 cents per hour. Other provi-
sions included:
0 An increase in company

A SMIl.ING. MINE-MILL LOCAL 598 DELEGATION leaves
the Toronto office of the Ontario Labor Relations Board on
July 25 following a hearing at which it was announcer-_§;,;,that
the United Steelworkers of America had again fallen short
of the number of cards necessary to have a new certifica-
tion election ordered at the Falconbridge Nickel property
in Sudbury, It was the third time in four years that Steel
unsuccessfully had attempted to launch a raid at the
Falconbridge operations. Among the group were National
Secretary—Treasurer William Longridge, who headed the
bargaining committee that recently won interim wage
increases at the property; Local 598 President Robin Mc-
Arthur; and john Nelligan, counsel for the local union.

Raid Fails, Interim Wage
Boosts Won at Sudbury

SUDBURY, 0nt.—For the third straight time, the United Steel-
workers have failed in efforts to launch a raid at the ‘Falconbridge
Nickel property here, represented by Mine-Mill Local 598. An On-
tario Labor Relations Board hearing on July 25 revealed that once
again Steel did not reach the 45 percent sign-up figure necessary to
have a new certification vote ordered.

According to a preliminary check by the board, 343 of the 1375
cards, filed were invalid for one reason or another. With the bargain-
ing unit composed of 2375 workers, the remaining cards_are an

insufficient number to call an
election.

Referring to the hefty interim
wage increases won by Mine-
Mill at Falconbridge earlier in
the month, Local 598 President
Robin McArthur said they were
only a down payment on what
can be further achieved in this
year’s bargaining. “There is no
doubt that we are in the strong-
est possible bargaining posi-
tion,” he declared, provided that
all differences are put aside and
the workers unite towards that
common objective.

5 to 7 Percent

The interim hikes, sought by
the union for several months, be-
came effective on July 7—six
weeks prior to‘ the expiration
date of the existing contract. The
increases were five percent on
all rates up to $2.50 per hour and
seven percent on all rates above
that figure. First class trades
received an extra 10 cents per

‘hour, and second class trades,

5 cents an hour.

The hikes were enthusiastical-
ly approved at crowded mem-
bership meetings of the local.

McArthur, who noted that bar-
gaining with Falconbridge is
now continuing, maintained that
the Steelworkers’ refusal to seek
interim wage hikes at Inco here
plus their abortive raid at the

. Mine-Mill property had allowed

both big nickel producers to es-
cape their responsibility to boost
the earnings of the nickel work-
er at an earlier date.

The pension program at Fal-
conbridge, in need of a major
overhaul, is one of the matters
being dealt with in negotiations,
said the Mine-Mill president.

The barginaing committee is
headed by National Secretary-
Treasurer William Longridge.

Earlier Attempts
The two previous attempts by
Steel to have a certification vote
ordered at Falconbridge were in

. 1962, when the petition was even-

tually withdrawn, and; again last
year, when the application was
dismissed by the board on the
grounds, of insufficient cards.

At this mon_th’s hearing, Mine-

 

Mill counsel John Nelligan pre-
sented to the labor board a peti-
tion bearing the signatures of
more than 60 percent of the Fal-

conbridge workers, stating that V

they had neither signed nor paid
for an application card with the
Steel union since June, 1965. The
petition was signed by 1478 men,
all following the final date a
month ago on which Steel could
submit cards.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Bowling 8 Softball Are New
 Activities in Baltimore

 

August. 19557

  

 

' BALTIMORE, Md. —— Two activities undertaken in recent months by the Metal and  
Fabricating Workers Union, Mine-Mill Local 625, are fulfilling a long-felt need here—— 
that of bringing the union members closer together on a recreational basis. They are
the establishment of an interdepartmental bowling league and the recruiting of a soft--
ball team which participates in an industrial league in the city.

The union hall, although close to the AS&R plant, is located far from the resi-
dential area of the city. Because most workers want to head home after their shifts, it

CAPTAINS OF THE VARIOUS TEAMS in the newly organ-

as shown in the picture below. "

 

POSITIVE RESULTS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INIUNCTIONS were seen by these 10 men,

Canadian leaders of the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, in
the three weeks they spent in jail, beginning late in Tune. Sentenced on contempt of
court charges for refusing to obey an injunction secured by employers which instructed
them to order union members to work on Victoria ‘Day, a statutory -holiday according
to the Canada Labor Code, the leaders won a victory when the Canadian minister of
labor declared that the benefits intended by the Labor Code would apply to long-
shoremen. Because the men's militant stand stirred up the public, the government, and
many other ‘unions, according to ILWU Canadian‘ Area President Roy Smith, "we are
sure that the courts will be much more careful in the future in allowing the employers
to club labor with this weapon (the injunction)/' ‘The 1.2 million-member Canadian
Labor Congress has called a national conference for September to consider injunc-
tions, compulsory arbitration, and “management rights” claims of theemployers. Kneel-

was felt that after-work activi- 
ties at the hall simply wou1dn’t 
fill the bill as a practical solu- 
tion. ,

Local 625 President’ Jamuel
Tarrant and the union’s execu-V -
tive board, in discussing ,the‘‘’\
situation, came up with tin,
bowling and softball ideas._

Both activities, which are en-
tirely union-sponso-red (the Bal-‘
timore local believes in doing »_
things itself), are now in high ‘ '
gear. Everyone involved, state V ‘
District 5 Board Member Alfred
Petit-Clair a n d International
Representative Angelo DeStefa- ._
no, who recently spent a delight- *1
ful evening at the Baltimore 1
bowling lanes, has commented
on the tremendous increase in
morale among the workers.  

Every Thursday 

The bowling league rolls into
action every Thursday night.
It’s what many consider the
only true sport of bowling—the‘ 
small duck pins where a score .
of 120 to 130 indicates great
skill. It’s a game of tremen-
dous" competition which is
clearly reflected in the,atmos-._
phere at the alleys.

Thomas Frazier. and Harry
Ramey, co-chairmen of the
Local 625 league, are well
aware, too, that, through this
competition, workers who never
before met or at least never
were involved, together in any
activity now are proving the .
real meaning of union brother- 5
hood. ’ « " '

William Grant serves as man-
ager of the softball team, re-
ceiving able assistance from
coaches William Bond, Joseph
Myers, James Curtis, and Her-»
man Hance. ‘

Like the Mets of other years, - ‘
the team is extremely guccess.-’
ful in terms of support and
spirit of the fans. Unfortunately, V .
like the Mets again, the opposi- "
tion keeps coming up with too
many runs. .

Two victories now, however,
are under their belts, and the——
players are having a good time:
The team, after all, is new and 7..
the future lies ahead. ‘

Major credit for theinitiation
of the two activities must- go to ‘ i
Tarrant, who declares that this
has been one of the dreams of
his life—-getting the union mem-
bership together on a fraternal
and recreational basis. The local B
union executive board, it must‘
be added, lent its full and solid - —.
support. _ —  .

THE MINE-MILL UNION

-Members of 29 ILWU Locals
llatify New Five-Year Dock Pact

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.—A five-year Pacific Coast longshore and clerks’ agreement between the
International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union and the Pacific Maritime Association was
ratified early this month by members of 29 local unions in California, Oregon, and Washington.

. Major features of the new contract are a 50 cents per straight-time hour wage hike this year plus
7‘ increases of 20 cents each in 1969 and 1970; a pension of $235 per month at age 63 after 25 years of
service; a $13,000 vesting benefit under a continuation of the historic Mechanization and Moderniza-

gtion agreement; plus improve-
ments in welfare benefits, vaca-

tions, and hours.
The total vote on ratification
' was 6,488 to 3,985, with each ge-
', ographical area of the ILWU
' waterfront division registering
a majority in favor of the pact.

, p ’ Retirement at 63
QAII wages, pension, welfare,
---and M&M fund payments are
retroactive to July 1. The pen-
sion agreement, which runs for
10 years, reduces the age of nor-

 mal retirement from 65 to 63.

'- ', There -will be, however, a cost-

W of-living review in five years-

- _' July 1, 1971.

- The new contract calls for
compulsory use of machines
whenever feasible and practical
 in order to lighten the work

,' load.
‘ At the same‘ time, a number

, of changes have been made in

5 ~ themanning scales, particularly

 v in the elimination of men under

 the “unnecessary man” rule.

.- The new manning scales will

?f;,_- permit a greater degree of ﬂex-

" ’  -ibility by the employer.

_ f Wages for longshoremen un-
‘ .der the new agreement are $3.88
per hour straight-time and $5.82
per hour overtime. This brings

“ the regular longshore daily

' wage, based on six hours’
straight-time and two overtime,
to $34.92. Clerks have achieved

' parity with longshoremen.

.. Under M&M, the employers

 ' agree to pay to the jointly trus-

‘ - ‘teed fund $6,900,000 per year—a

total, of $34,500,000 over the five

, years. '

 

  _ Vesting ‘Benefit
  This, the union has deter-
mined, will bring to each man

"3 .. retiring after 25 years’ service *

£4

a $13,000 vesting benefit. Such
men can retire early at 62, or
normally at age 63, 64, or 65.
Payments can be made in a
lump sum, on approval of the
trustees, or in monthly install-
ments of $216.67 for five years,
or $270.83 for four years.

All pension and M&M benefits
are exclusive of normal Social

Security income.

Widows of retired men will
continue to receive the standard
widow’s pension of one-half the
pension the man received.- A
new feature will provide a pen-
sion for the widows of men with
25 qualifying years at age 60
who die prior to normal retire-
ment. -

Nlll Hearing 0ft; Mid-city Foundry
Padges Bargaining In Good Faith

MILWAUKEE, Wisc. — The
Mid-City Foundry . last week
agreed to begin good faith nego-
tiations with Mine-Mill Local
943 and to rehire all workers
who had been fired in the past
six and a half months—during
which the union has been on
strike. The company action
came just prior to a National
Labor Relations Board hearing,
scheduled for Aug. 9, on unfair
labor practice charges against
Mid-City.

An NLRB complaint, embody-
ing the union’s charge that Mid-
City had refused to negotiate in

good faith throughout the long.

series of bargaining sessions,
had been issued late last month
and the hearing date was then
established.

The company’s recent pro-
posals, which make the NLRB
hearing unnecessary, amount to
an admission that the Local
943 charges were valid.

Some 125 workers struck the
plant on Jan. 26, after the com-
pany, in at least 15 negotiating
sessions, persisted in trying to
force acceptance of an inferior

contract. At least eight union-
company meetings were held
during the strike, but Mid-City
refused to grant even a non-dis-
crimination clause.

Unfair labor practice charges
were filed with the NLRB late in
March, based onthe testimony
of several witnesses who had
heard company representatives
state that Mid-City would “never
sign a contract with the union”
and make other similar state-
ments. Additionally, a few of the
non - union workers approached
by the company admitted that
they were offered higher wages
than those proposed by Mid-City
in negotiations, according to In-
t e r n a ti o n a 1 Representative
James Pinta, who has been gath-
ering evidence to substantiate
the union charge.

Anti-Union History

A company with a long history
of anti - unionism, Mid-City had
refused to consider a proper
grievance procedure, any type
of union security, or health and
welfare and wage proposals of
Local 943.

 Four Unions at Harbison-Walker Find
p-Coordinated Bargaining Is Productive

CLEARFIELD, Pa.—Some 2,000 Harbison-Walker employees, members of four different international unions
 at 11 of the company’s properties in this country and Canada, won a substantial new three-year contract through
 brief, but coordinated strike action at the beginning of this month.
The overall package, conservatively estimated at 42 to 43 cents per hour over the contract period, includes
 wage gains ranging from 7 to 17 cents per hour in the first year and from 8 to 18 cents in the third. Additionally,

around-the-clock negotiations in
progress, it took only until 6
that morning for an agreement
to be reached. Yet, no worker
returned to his job until Aug. 4,
when the last of the local unions
involved had ratified the new
contract.

The Mine-Mill unions involved
were Locals 531 and 553 in Bes-
semer and Fairfield, Ala. re-
spectively.

Wage gains in the first -year
of the pact are 7 cents per hour
across-‘the-board, with 1/2-cent
increments beginning with the
third labor. grade-—an average
hike of about 10% cents. The
same increments are added to
the across-the-board 8 cents per
hour hike in the third year-
making the range from 8 to 18
cents, or an average of 111/2
cents.

Some 25 men at the Mine-Mill
properties are covered by the
substantial classification adjust-
ments.

While most of the fringe bene-
fits become effective in the con-
tract’s second year, a few are
immediate gains—doub1e time

-and a half for holiday work in

continuous operations, a 1-cent-
an-‘hour increase in shift dif-
ferentials, three days’ funeral
leave. ‘

Health and Welfare

Health and welfare improve-
ments include a minimum week-
ly sickness and accident benefit
of $62.50,or a $10.per week in-

. 2? V

crease, whichever is greater,
plus extension of the benefit for
a month after layoff; an addi-
tional $1,000 life insurance;
$1,200 life insurance for retirees;
an increase to $450 maximum
for the surgical schedule; and
extension of the hospitalization
benefits from the present 70-day
plan to 365 days in semi-private
accommodations, with depen-
dent coverage up to age 23.

The pension benefit is in-
creased $1 per year of service
up to 35 years, with employees
retiring between now and Aug.
1, 1967 receiving the increased
amount at that time.

The following new vacation
schedule also takes effect on

_ that date: One week after one

year of service, at 2 percent of

three weeks after 10, at 7 per-
cent; and four weeks after 20
at 8 percent.

Shift differentials also are fur-
ther increased to 10 and 14 cents
per hour.

Richard Prosten was the IUD
representative handling the co-
ordination of the Harbison-
Walker negotiations. Besides the
Mine-Mill plants in Alabama,
properties involved included
ones in East Chicago, just out-
side of Montreal, in Michigan,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana.

Mine-Mill Local 531 and vice-
president of the Harbison-Walker
labor council, represented the
150 members of his local at the
bargaining sessions, along with

Local 531. Willie Kornegey,
president, and Travis Kelley,
committeeman, represented the
55-member Local 553.

yet been chosen. The two unions,
from the beginning of the grape
strike 10 months ago, have co-
operated closely in their activi-
ties directed at the growers.

The NFWA, which in June
signed a milestone agreement
with the Schenley Corporation,
has agreed to suspend its na-
tionwide boycott of DiGiorgio
products, The strikers, too, have
returned to the fields for the
grape harvest in exchange for a
fair election, which, if won by
the union, will mean immediate
negotiations with the company
after the Aug. 30 date.

If no agreement can be
reached within 45 days, the
American Arbitration Associa-
tion will decide on the final and
binding terms of a contract.

Election Campaign

Even while the grapes are.

being picked, the farm workers
are organizing a far-reaching
pre-election campaign. “Our
strike has become a symbol for
the beginning of real movement
among farm workers,” said
Cesar Chavez, NFWA director,
in emphasizing the key impor-
tance of the DiGiorgio elections
to every agricultural worker in
the country.

Any worker employed by the
company at the beginning of the
strike or anyone who has
worked for DiGiorgio for 15 or
more days since is eligible to
take part in the upcoming elec-
tion. Since many are no longer
living in the area, transportation
costs and food must be provided
to ensure their participation. Do-
nations should be sent to the
Farm Workers Relief Fund, Box
130, Delano, California.

An earlier election, set up
unilaterally by the company,
was boycotted by the farm work-
ers unions, which charged Di-
Giorgio with unfair labor prac-
tices. Under pressure from both

the strikers and Mexican-Amer- '

ican political organizations,
Gov. Edmund (Pat) Brown in-
tervened and selected the Amer-
ican Arbitration Association to
investigate the “election” and
to set guidelines for the holding
of representation elections in
agriculture - not now covered
by state or federal labor rela-
tions laws.

Ronald Haughton of Wayne
State University, chosen as the
arbitrator, set aside the previ-
ous company-sponsored election.‘
Both unions and DiGiorgio ulti-
mately agreed on the recom-
mended procedures for the Aug.
30 balloting, which will be su-
pervised by the AAA.»

Labor Tells Utah Democrats

" SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—Organized labor here, including Mine-Mill Locals 55,
392, 485 and 692, has put the Utah Democratic party on notice that unless a sub-
stantial portion of this year’s labor plank is enacted into law, the unions will follow
a policy of “defeat your enemies, help your friends, regardless of party affiliation.”
Angered ‘over an apparent disinterest in labor legislation by Democrats elected in
1964, labor groups introduced a resolution at the party’s Salt Lake County conven-
tion calling for the complete removal of the labor plank from the Democratic plat-
form; No heed is ever paid to such a plank anyway, the labor delegation argued.
Although the proposal was defeated, it caused general concern among Democrats

July‘ 30, at which labor was to,
reiterate its warning to the
party.

Mine-Mill International Rep-
resentative L. L- Nielsen, hav-
ing been appointed to the plat-
form committee for the state
convention, was one of four

t_ persons who submitted pro-

posals to be considered for the
labor plank of the platform.

' He submitted an outline. for
proposed legislation which
would provide for payment of
compensation—based on current
rates—in cases where persons
"had a recurrence of disability
dueto an old industrial injury.

The present law in Utah stipu-

lates that, in such cases, com-

"pensation is to be paid based on

the rate in effect at the time of

the original disability.
Members of the platform

committee were given only two

. days notice to submit suggested
«planks to a steering committee,

which was to incorporate them
into the party platform.

There was a general revolt
among labor members ' of the
committee when they discov-

 ered that the two persons

 chosen to represent labor on the

‘ steering committee ' were Lynn

" Richards, who represents the

Self Insurers Group (industry),

, ' and John Schone, a state indus-
trial commissioner.

After initially suffering a de-

II feat on their proposals (Nielsen’s

lost by a 25 to 28 vote), the
labor members demanded, and
were voted, the right to con-
struct their own labor plank.
Meeting the following night,
they decided to re-submit the
1964 labor plank, with one addi-
tion. One of the best ever
approved by Utah Democrats,
it calls for reform in the state
industrial commission, improve-
ment of state workmen’s and
unemployment compensation
benefits, new state safety codes,
and the rights to free collective
bargaining and organization’.
The newly added feature de-
nounces the advertising of Utah
as a “right-to-work” state by
governmental and private agen-
cies.

The labor plank was intro-
duced in the convention by
C. E. Berger, president of the
Utah AFL-CIO. Flanked by
Nielsen, Frank Stevenson of the
United Mine Workers, Fullmer
Latter of the Teamsters, and a
,member of the Bakers’ Union,
Berger stated that organized

labor in Utah was united in its
support of the plank and added,
“The Democrats are on trial as
of now.” The labor plank was
adopted without a dissenting
vote. '

Besides Nielsen, Mine-Mill
was represented at the state
convention by several members

_from locals in Magna, Bingham

THE MINE-MILL UNION

-Four Mine-Mill Members Are Candidates M-M Member
For Montana House and Senate Seats Seeks Coroner's

Four Mine-Mill members—two each from Butte and Great Falls——recently announced as Democratic candidates

for the Montana state legislature. _ _ _

_ Seeking Senate seats are Barney Rask of Butte, Mine-Mill executive board member for District 1, and Gabriel
' Kuntz, a long-time active member _of the Great Falls Mill and Sme_ltermen’s Union No. 16. Max Salazarnfinancial
secretary of the Butte Miners’ Union, and Raymond Graham, president of the Great Falls local, are candidates for

the House of Representatives.

All persons who were registered to vote on or before July 7 can vote in the primary election, scheduled for

‘’ August 16. Those not now registered should become so prior to September 29 in order to ensure eligibility to vote

» in the ‘general election on No-
, vember 8.
Due to the recent reapportion-
C ment in Montana, the Mine-Mill
. ‘ candidates view this year’s elec-
- ion as an extremely crucial
go. It is possible, they main-
 tain, for the whole complexion
of the legislature to be changed
because of the redistribution of
Senate and House seats.
Prior to the redistricting,
rural, conservative control was
- virtually guaranteed, particular-
ly in the Senate, to which each
county, regardless of its size,
sent one member. Representa-
’ , tion in both houses is now much
9 more in line with population.
' Silver Bow County (Butte),
,’ for example, which had one
» Senate and five House seats,
will this year elect four Sena-
tors and seven House members.
A similar situation exists in
‘Cascade County (Great Falls),
‘ which will now be represented

by--six" senators and 11 repre-

sentatives. Mine-Mill, of course,

Graham Seeks
House Seat

Graham is one of 16 Demo-
crats who have file-d for the 11
House seats from Cascade
County. Currently serving as
the president of Mine-Mill Local
16, he has been elected over the
past 20 years to nearly every
local negotiating committee. His
union experience ranges from
stewardpto local union business
agent. "fa

Other labor candidates are
Peter J. Gilligan, business agent
for the Plumbers Union, and
John Willets from the Brother-
hood of Railway Trainmen, both
incumbents seeking re-election,

. and John Polston from the Ty-

pographical Union. There also

are four Farmers Union candi-
dates in the‘ race—-Ronald Holtz —

and Jack Gunderson, both in-
cumbents, and John Stagmiller
and Lawrence Fasfender.

Salazar Background

Fifteen Democrats and two
Republicans are candidates for
the seven Silver Bow House
seats. -.

Salazar, a resident of Butte
for 17 years, has held the of-
fices of recording secretary,
vice-president and financial sec-
retary of Mine-Mill Local 1.
Like Rask a member of the
Mine-Mill Legislative Commit-
tee in Montana for several
years, Salazar also is a mem-
ber of the board of directors of
the county's Anti-Poverty Coun-
cil and a board member of the
Sheltered Workshop for Retard-
ed Children. He is active with

. the Little League in Butte.

Should this year’s election re-
sult in the balance of power in
the legislature resting in the
hands of conservative or re-
actionary forces, notes Graham,
there is a serious possibility of
an attempt to enact a “right-
to-work” law in the state.

Labor legislation, too, depends
on the alignment of the state’s
lawmakers. Rask and Salazar
emphasize the need for im-
provements in the workmen’s
compensation and unemploy-
ment compensation laws. A

 

Max Salazar
Butte Campaign

major aim is to introduce legis-
lation to include pulmonary
emphysema as an occupational
disease.

_ -“Other Issues

Silicosis benefits are another
major item. An increase of $15
was fought for and won in 1965,
raising _the monthly payments
to $90.. -Yet, this is still insuf-
ficient for miners who have
spent a lifetime working under-
ground under very hazardous
conditions.

Another‘ important matter ex-
pected to come before the next
session of the legislature is a
proposed state retail sales tax-

strongly opposed by» the Mine-

Mill candidates.

Dilemma for
John Birehers

Authoritarian-minded mem-
bers of the John Birch Soci-
ety, who so frequently sport
“Support Your Local Police”
stickers, are facing an acid
test in Redding, Calif.

Although 35 of 39 Redding
police officers say they want
to join a union, the city coun-
cil has turned thumbs down
on the idea.

Asks the Redding Record-
Searchlight editorially, “Will
the John Birch Society send
a telegram to the next City
Council meeting to support
the majority of Redding’s
finest?”

Ralph Hocking

BUTTE, Mont.—Ralph Hock-
ing, Mine-Mill member and life-
time resident of Silver Bow
County, is a Democratic candi-
date for the office of county

Born in Walkerville, Mont. in
1916, Hocking has been a mem-
ber of the Butte Miners’ Union
since 1935, except for three
years of military service during
World War II as a paratrooper.
He has been active in union af-
fairs, having served on several
committees in the local, includ-
ing the all mines grievance and
safety committees.

The union member is well
known in athletic circles here,
having boxed professionally in
the late 1930’s. He since has

Local 924 Issued Warning
Prior to Keno Hill Disaster

ELSA, Yukon Territory—Although the origin of the June23 fire that took the
lives of four Mine-Mill members at Keno Hill's No Cash mine here is undetermined, a
coroner’s jury that investigated the tragedy concluded that the circumstances indi-
cated the need for more adequate safety equipment and more extensive and regular
training for new men and rescue teams. _

_ On March 27, less than three months prior to the fire, Bob McLaren, then presi-
dent of Local 924, had raised the same points in a letter to the Minister of Northern
Affairs. “The recent fatality of one of our brothers in the mine at Elsa,” wrote Mc-

Laren, “brought to the atten-
tion of everyone concerned the
fact that the safety equipment
used here was grossly inade-
quate, obsolete, and that there
was a severe shortage of men
trained in the use of this equip-
ment and also in the basic
fundamentals of mine rescue
procedure and practice.”

Four of a crew of 18 perished
when the blaze broke out in the
lunch room near the 200-foot
level and spread to blocking
supporting the back of an adja-
cent drift. The deaths of Joe
Worobec, Jake Vincze; Drago
J urcec, and Victor Atamanchuk
were due to asphyxiation, the
coroner’s jury said.

As the fire raged on, for some
16 hours, heavy smoke and car-
bon monoxide cascaded down
drifts, shafts, and service raises
to other sections of the mine. A
few of the miners who survived,
by barricading themselves in
drifts and crosscuts to keep out
the fumes, were able to make
their way through the darkness
to the surface. Most were
found and brought out by rescue
crews. ’

List Provided

Some of the rescuers were
flown to the site from hundreds
of miles away, indicating that
McLaren’s earlier suggestion

concerning the safety training of -

personnel had not been followed.
The local union president had,
according to his March 27 letter,
given to- the company the names
of some 20 men he believed to
be suitable for such training.

This had been done at the sug-
gestion of the mine inspector,
who previously had met" jointly
with the company and the union.

Further evidence on the June
23 tragedy was heard in an in-
vestigation conducted by the in-
spector, A. Oliver, on July 14
and 15. His report is expected
to be published soon.

When the transcripts are avail-
able, _a committee‘ of company

. and union officials and the mine

inspector will meet ' to make

further recommendations on the
improvement of safety at the
property.

THE ‘-MINE-MILL UNION

   C Arizona  Mine-Mill Council  

 Endorses Goddard G Seimer

TUCSON, Ariz.—Meeting at the Desert Inn here on July 24, the Arizona Mine-
Mill Council, political arm of the union in the state, pledged its enthusiastic support for
the re-election of Gov. Sam Goddard and U. S. Rep. George F. Senner, Jr., both of
whom face opposition in this year’s primary election, set for Sept. 13. V

No endorsements for the state legislature were made, as the council agreed to
leave those judgments up to the, local unions, which in many. areas of the state have

'1

 
 

 

, .

  
 
 
   
 
 
  

been working with AFL-CIO and
other labor unions, community
organizations, and minority
groups, in a united effort for
concerted political action.
Goddard, a Democrat, "who
faces primary opposition from
Andrew (Jack) Gilbert of War-
ren and Norman Green of Tuc-
son in his bid for a second term,
addressed the meeting, telling
delegates, “I’ve got five Repub-
licans running against me-

three in their primary and two

in ours.” _ » . .
~. For the Worker
5 Delegates, in their resolution
of support for the incumbent
governor, said he had pushed
“to secure legislation that would

benefit the . Working people of :
‘Arizona, advance the economy

of our state, and move toward
solution -of our state’s pressing
financial problems.” Goddard’s

‘- opponents,‘ the resolution con- V

tinued, “are either, in the one
cas-e, associated withthe forces

that worked to block the gov-_
ernor’s program or, in. the

other, with a political plot to
damage the governor, smear

,  legislators who have worked for.

a progressive program, and
split the Democratic party to

c "the benefit of Goldwater ‘Repub-
,- .licans.”

" Senner, the incumbent from
the Third Congressional Dis-
trict, was praised for his work
for thefederal mine safety bill,

- ’ his vote for repeal of Section
_..14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act,

and his support of civil rights
legislation and the anti-poverty
program.

" While calling upon local unions
to choose between ‘candidates on
the local ‘level, the council
urged that the candidates’ sup-
port for the following programs
be considered in making such
endorsements: .

O A state minimum wage, in
, line with federal standards
and providing coverage for
agricultural workers;
0A state safety code, with
adequate enforcement ma.-
 chinery, to protect workers
against "unsafe practices
" and equipment of employ-
ers; ' .

VO‘A'i._ikinde-rgarten ‘system and

on food and drugs; ‘
Q Improvement in the Indus-
' _trial Disease (silicosis) Act;
0 Full implementation of civil
rights legislation; --
Q Support for Gov. Goddard
legislative. program. '

,' 3  The council, too, said it would
1 seek‘ the support‘ of other labor-

 organizationsin forming _ a" joint

 la‘b_o_r committee to assist the

state’s' farm workers. On the
legislative front, the delegates

A ,agreed,‘s’uch a committee should

work for "establishment of a

‘minimum’ wage for agricultural '
'.workers—,-*" coverage "of farm’

workers under :, a state safety

  
  
 
 

code, unemployment insurance.
and workmen’s compensation
laws, and enactment of a state
labor law setting up procedures
for bargaining representative
elections.

Other Speakers
Besides ’ Goddard-, speakers at
the meeting included State Rep.
Tony Carrillo from Pima Coun-
ty,_ who outlined the recent leg-

' islative redistricting of. the

state; Edward 1:53o1‘gan, a candi-

date for Superior Court judge It

in Pima County, who spoke on
the Elfbrandt loyalty oath case
and other civil liberties issues;

-and Don Villeneuve, a represen-

tative from COPE, who out-
lined the endorsements earlier
made by the state AFL-CIO.

In addition to Goddard and
Senner, COPE.is urging support
for state treasurer candidate
John MacLaugh1in, State Tax
Commission candidate. Robert

Kennedy, and Corporation Com- '

missioner Milton Husky — all
Democrats.

Coalitions Formed
Frank Z. Morales, financial
secretary of Mine-Mill Local 616
in Morenci, presented a report,
too, on. the Navajo-Ap-ache-
Greenlee County coalition of la-
bor, Mexican-Americans, and
Apache and Navajo Indians. The
council commended the work of
various Mine-Mill‘ locals which
has resulted in that coalition,
the Gila-Pinal County joint la-
bor committee, and “the organ-
ization backing such outstand-
ing candidates as Tony Carrillo
in Pima County.”
‘Goddard, in a strong defense
of Arizona War on Poverty pro-

grams, told the delegates, “We

have to block the people who
want to make a mockery of that
war.” “No other country but
ours is now prosperous enough
to be able to set as an objective
the complete elimination of pov-
erty,” the governor declared,
adding, “Making war ‘on pov-

.§‘-. '

erty makes a lot more sense
than making any other kind of
war.”

Roy Santa Cruz, Jr., recently
appointed to the Mine-Mill in-
ternational staff, stepped down
as chairman of the council at
the meeting, being replaced by
Edward ‘Jacks-on, president of

Local 937 in San Manuel. David_

Duarte, business agent for Local

551 in Bisbee, is the organiza-

tion’s new vice-chairman.
Attending" the" parley were

, delegates from Miami, Prescott,

local 015 wins
65-Cent Package

PORT COLBORNE, Ont.-
Benefits valued at 65 cents an
hour over a two-year period re-
cently were won by Mine-Mill
Local 1015 in a new contract
with the Federal Harbors Board-.
Pay hikes range from 60 cents
per hour for first class electri-
cians down to 32 cents for ma-
rine operators.

Retroactive pay -included in
the settlement ranges from
$275.60 to $462.80. '

One of the most significant
gains, according to William

Kennedy; executive board mem-

ber, who acted as committee
spokesman for the local union.
is the increase in size of the
steve-doring gang. In the event
of technological change or the
introduction of new methods, he
noted, the size of the crew be-
comes again a‘ matter of nego-
tiation between the parties.
' Additional gains include dou-
ble time pay for overtime after
midnight and increased sick
leave to a total of 15 days per
year. Vacations were increased
to two weeks after one year of
service, three weeks after 10
years, and four weeks after 20-
years. '

As of Jan. 1 next year, the
lowest pay rate will be that of
the operator at $2.51 per hour.

contraception, fertility and, for the first time, adoption. The 192-

Is it dangerous to try to save money by buying drugs under‘
their generic rather than brand names? CU’s consultants have
found no sound basis for any physician to prescribe by brand if a
his only purpose in doing so is to assurehis patients of getting

highest quality drugs. Antibiotics especially can be prescribed .. n‘ 
generically since every batch of them manufactured must be certi-ii >'f  _'ﬂ '

fied separately by the Food and Drug Administration. l ,

To suggest that generic drugs are risky is to suggest that a
growing number of public and private hospitals, clinics, institutions
and welfare agencies now buying drugs exclusively by generic,-Z
names as a ‘matter of policy are subjecting their patients to an

unnecessary risk. Quite the contrary is to be expected. The strict. _

quality specifications imposed by these big buyers cannot help

but have a salutary general influence on drug quality, say CU’s

medical consultants. -

For those who think left-handed scissors are something ‘a
practical joker might send the new office boy. after, such scissors
do indeed exist—-and they can be a big help toia left-handed seam-
stress. Although they may not be easy to find, some of the largest
suppliers of scissors carry them. An obliging hardware store man-
ager shouldn’t have much trouble ordering them for a customer. -

Left-handed scissors ‘are easily recognized. In partially left-
handed ones, the handles are contoured in reverse, so that the left
thumb and finger won’t press on a sharp ridge. When the bl_ade_s,
too, are left-handed, the top one (as the user looks down on the
scissors) is toward the left where it gives an unobstructed view
of the, cutting line.

What is “normal body temperature?” Consumers Union points

out that while the majority of. people will register a normal reading _ - A

near 98.6 degrees on’ arising in the morning, the variation from one
person to another is considerable. A person’s rectal temperature
generally is one-half to a full degree above his oral temperature.
No one’s temperature remains constant all the time. A body
normally fluctuates in temperature over a range of two degrees
in each 24-hour period. The low occurs at about 2 am. and the
high at about 4 p.m. Thus, some people normally register an oral '
temperature of well over 99 degrees in the late afternoon. In
Women, the body temperature averages 0.5 degrees higher during.
the last half of the menstrual cycle than during the first half. In
addition, certain things people do can raise their temperature. For
about two hours after the consumption of a large meal, the body

temperature may be elevated 0.5 to 1 degree. Very hot weather 
can have this same effect. And violent exercise can send the temper- ,

ature (briefly) up to as high as 102 or 103 degrees. Even chewing
gum hard and steadily can raise the oral temperature a full"

degree. In all these instances the high temperature can be con-_ i I ‘ it

Local 711 Arbitration
Wins 6 Wage Hikes

Fairview, Pa. —The Parker White Metal Worker’s
Union, Mine-Mill Local 711, on July 12 won an arbitra-
tion award providing a 10 cents per hour wage increase
for six plant employees. The decision, handed down by
Arbitrator Thomas A. Knowlton, also called for back pay
totaling approximately $1,000—over $160 for each of

the six.

The local union, which has a policy” of exerting every

~ effort to resolve grievances satisfactorily at lower levels,
has taken only one other case to arbitration in the nearly
20 years since it was chartered in 1947. That case, which

involved the firing of Richard
S. Miller, a shop steward, was
won by the union in December,
1964.

increased Work Load

The present case began as a
grievance last Nov. 8, when
Parker White purchased _a third
Sweco machine and assigned its
operation to the two workers on
each shift who were then run-
ning the other two machines.
The union argued that the in-
creased work load thus imposed
was sufficient reason for an in-
crease in the operators’ pay.

Swecos, first introduced at
Parker White in 1963, are ma-
chines that are used to clean
metal castings through the use
of chemicals and abrasives.

Company Argument
Reiecfed

Knowlton, in deciding the ar-
bitration in favor of Local 711,
rejected the argument of Robert
Roemer, chief negotiator for the
company, who testified at a June
28 hearing that there was for-
merly an excess of idle time on
the Sweco operation and that,
with theaddition of a third ma-
chine, the job. still represented
only a day's work. In stating

One-Day Wakoui
Gets Fast Action
in Charleston

CHARLESTON, S.C.——A July
8 walkout by some 225 chemical

and fertilizer workers at the‘

Mobil Chemical Company ‘plant
here» won. quick action on a
long-standing complaint con-
cerning a water cooler that was
out of order.

The cooler had not functioned
since April, and since the be-
ginning of May the company
had been saying that a new one
was on order.

Finally, with the temperature

hovering in the high 90's, the=

workers, members of Mine-Mill
staged a 24-hour
work stoppage. The men walked
off their jobs at 8 a.m., and the
night shift did not report at all.

Noting that a new water
cooler was installed the very
day that the workers went out,
R. N. Wagner, chairman of the
local union grievance commit-
tee, also stated that the man-
agement agreed to sit down and
work out some other issues
about working conditions. Sev-
eral such minor disputes were
settled, he said.

_Wagner, who is also the vice-
president of the Charleston
Fertilizer and Chemical Work-
ers Union, said that the union
had nothing to do with the walk-
out, which, he added, was a
spontaneous decision of the
workers themselves. The con-

- -tract at the plant contains a no-

strike clause.
Overtime Grievance

The union was, however, in-
volved in the earlier settlement
of a grievance concerning the
equalization of overtime among
maintenance workers at the
Mobil Chemical property. ‘
The‘ company agreed to pay
19 hours in -overtime to two
workers who had been passed
over, by--the departmental fore-
,ma‘n in-his assignment of over-

that a sufficient increase in work
load had been caused “to justify
and require an increase in pay
of 10 cents per hour retroactive-
ly to Nov. 8, 1965,” he noted that
the previous pay scale had been
accepted by both the union and
the company as proper for the
job “as it was then d6ir'e.”

Mine-Mill International Repre-
sentative Joseph Scioli, who pre-
sented the union's case _at the
hearing, praised the role in the
case of the research department
of the international union. “The
advise and material we received
from Elayne Go1dstein," a re-
search assistant, “was excel-
lent,". he stated.

Besides Scioli, Local 711 was
represented at the hearing by
Donald Burger, local union pres-
ident;. Gerald Firch, chief stew-
ard; and Sweco operators Doug-
las Gottschling and Clarence

VICTORIA, B. C.-—A dozen

amendments to the Metal1ifer-

province’s mine safety law,
Board Member Al King, acting «
as spokesman for the union del- ,

by Chief Inspector “of Mines
J. W. Peck. ’

King raised the questions of‘
number of hours worked in sur-

working alone, and suggested 
the beefing up of many of the — I
present safety clauses. “We ex- M
pect that many of our proposals-__ ‘ .-.5-f

mainly on the lives, health and
welfare of our men, will be rec- ,1-,. '‘

said following the hearings.

Mine-Mill was the only union
to make organized presentations .
to the committee, but the Min-
ing Association, representing
various mine operators through- » _ .
out the province, including Co-  . "f

segregated Mississippi delega-
tion at the Democratic national

convention in Atlantic City,

N . J . and the seating of the
state’s Congressional delegation
elected in 1964, on the basis that
the Negro was systematically
excluded from participation in
the political processes, this year
for the first time ran candidates
in the Democratic primary elec-
tion.

Two Independents

Two of six candidates who
ran and lost in that primary
plan to carry on as independents
for the November election—the
Rev. Mr. Whitley, 33, the direc-
tor of student affairs at Rust
College, and Dock Drummond,
a retired teacher and plumber,
who is contesting Thomas Aber-

' nathy’s U. S. House seat for the

First Congressional District.

In filing for the primary this
spring, the MFDP candidates
declared categorically that they
would not comply with Section
3129 of the Mississippi Code,
which states that a primary
candidate (1) supports the plat-
form and principles of the party
holding the election, and (2)
agrees to support the winner of
the primary. This decision was
based on the fact that, among
its many segregationist planks,
the Democratic party platform
contains the following ﬂat state-

ment: “Webelieve in separation

of the races in all phases of our
society.”

Running as an independent is
an awesome task, requiring the
candidate to obtain 10,000 no-
tarized signatures of eligible
voters and to pay a fee of $300.
But Whitley is making the effort
since he expects to fare far bet-
ter on Nov. 8 than he did in the
primary.

For one thing, he expects the
Negro vote to swell from its
present 120,000 statewide total
(already up over 70 percent
from the 1964 figure of 70,000)
to some 175,000 by November. It
is, of course, from this group
that Whitley is receiving his
strongest support, although he
is also getting some white
backing.

Some 525,000 whites are reg-
istered to vote in Mississippi-
a figure that is not expected to

climb drastically in the next few,

months, since it already repre-
sents close to 90 percent of those
eligible.

One-‘Party Pattern

In the primary, Eastland gar-
nered some 140,000 votes to
40,000 for Whitley and another
10,000 for a third candidate in
the race. The Rust College pro-
fessor, however, feels that, while

his total will be greater in No-

vember due to increased Negro
registration, many others who
voted in the primary will fail to
do so in the general election.

The voting pattern of a long-_
time one-party state, where the

primary vote exceeds that of-
the general,» he sees as a second

‘ reason that he has a chance of
9 fashioning a major political up-
' s-et. - '

.ci,.v-ilgrights movement. ‘In talking about the, shooting of James .

Finally, there is the factor of
Walker, who is running a strong
campaign in Mississippi for a
member of the GOP. Whitley

feels that Walker’s votes" will
_come from the" Eastland total

in the primary.’ . V _

the primary, does not have this
latter advantage. There is no
Republican‘ candidate going
against Rep. Abernathy.

Issues in Campaign

One of the chief campaign is-
sues of the MFDP candidates
is the War on Poverty. Because
community action boards in the
state have been virtually hand-
picked by the mayors in vari-
ous communities, with little di-
rect participation by the poor,
both advocate revision of the
Economic Opportunity Act
guidelines. They charge, too,
that the rural and small busi-
ness loan provisions of the War
on Poverty law have been twist-
ed in Mississippi to benefit, not
the small farmer or business-
man, but those who are already
well off.

It is this issue, primarily,
which has won some support
from whites —- particularly the
poorer farmer.

Whitley also charges that the
soil bank program favors the
large farmer. He is campaign-
ing, too, for impartial enforce-
ment of the provisions of the
U. S. Constitution, for equal and
desegregated educational oppor-
tunities, for an expanded medi-
care program. ‘

Although he believes that the
United States has a responsibil-
ity to the people of Viet Nam,
he feels it is not a military one.
Whitney opposes American par-
ticipation in the war, which, he
feels, is draining the resources

for the needed domestic pro-‘

grams in this country.-

While organized, labor is rela-
tively weak in the state, Whit-
ley, who supports repeal of Sec-
tion 14(b) and other labor legis-
lative goals, believes the unions
there to be potentially an im-
portant force in the‘libera1iza-
tion of Mississippi society.

Pipe Shop Team Winner
In G.F. First Aid Contest

GREAT FALLS, Mont. —— Captained by Earl M.
Howe, the low line pipe shop team took first place in a
field of 14 in the annual first-aid contest for the Aria-
conda Company's reduction plant here in June. The pipe
shop, which did not have a squad participating in last
year’s 12-team competition, scored 1494 points out of a
possible 1500—a percentage of 99.6.

In second place was the zinc electrolyzing No. 1
team, with 1491 points. The brickmasons, who took first
place in the 1965 contest, finished tjiird. Once again cap-

tained by Leland F. Fabel, the

,squad picked up 1488 ‘points-

three more than the E.C.R.
team, which was the fourth
place finisher.

Each six-man team worked
three first-aid problems, each
worth a maximum of 500 points.

All of the participants re.
ceived $80 for their practice
and contest time, with members

of the winning team each’
- getting an additional award of

$34. Each member of the sec-
ond, third; and fourth place

later said that the administra-
tion is taking a new look at the
“guidelines,” with the aim of

' making them more flexible by
reflecting increased productiv- .

ity. Both indicated that the
President is awaiting recom-
mendations from his labor-man-
agement advisory committee as
well as other economic policy
advisers on what should be done
with the “guidelines.”
Steel Price Hikes
With Congress engaged in de-

' bates on methods of clamping

down on the striking Machinists,
several major steel producers

‘picked that time to boost some

basic steel pricesfrom $2 to $3
a ton. Although the so—called
,“wage guidelines” have been
touted as a method of holding
down prices, the administration
apparently intends to let the
steel price hikes stand.

Later in the week that the
Machinists repudiated the pro-
posed airline settlement, the

Senate approved a bill -calling
for:

O A 30-day back-to-work or-
’der, effective upon enact-
ment of the bill;

0 Authority for the President
to extend the order for 60
days and to appoint a spe-
cial mediation panel;

0 Authority for a further 90-
day extension, at the option
of the President, if recom-
mended by the mediators.

Anti-Labor Bill

The bill was opposed by AFL-
CIO President George lvleany
because it would “force free
men to Work against their will
for the profit of private invest-
ors.” He said a vote for any
strikebreaking measure “can
only be considered as anti-labor
in character.”

The bill nevertheless passed
the _Senate 54 to 33. Among those
who spoke against the Ptoposal
during the Senate debate were
Senators ‘Proxmire and Nelson
(D-Wis.), McGee (D-Wyo.),

Virginia Conservatism
Beaten in Dem Primary

RICHMOND, Va. — The death knell sounded last
month for the Harry F. Byrd machine, which has domi-
nated politics in this state for. the past 40 years. Two
young attorneys, backed by both labor and civil rights
organizations, wrote the beginning of the end for hard
core Virginia conservatism in their upset Victories in the
Democratic primary on July 12 over U.S. Sen. A. Willis
Robertson and Rep. Howard W. Smith—both senior pil-

‘lars of the Old South’s Congressional edifice.

_ Only Harry F. _By_rd, Jr. survived the moderate-to-
hberal onslaught, winning nomination by a slender mar-

gin for the four remaining years
in the Senate seat he inherited
by appointment when his ailing
father stepped down last Novem-
ber.
Narrow Margins

Smith, 83, an 18-term member
of the House, was toppled by
George C. Rawlings, Jr., 44, a
state legislator from Fredericks-
burg, whose margin of 364 votes
in 53,406 cast was little more
than one-half of one percent of
the total.

State Sen. William B. Sponge
Jr., 45, of Portsmouth defeated
Robertson, 79, in an even tighter
battle. His majority, with some
435,000 persons going to the polls
statewide, was roughtly one-
tenth of one percent of that total.

In the other statewide race,
Byrd won over former State Sen.
Armistead L. Boothe of Alexan-
dria—but only by about 8,000
votes.

As chairman of the powerful
House Rules Committee, the ex-
tr e m e l y conservative Smith

bill after bill having a liberal or
progressive flavor. Congress fi-
nally moved last year to dilute
that power by giving the House
speaker authority to move bills
after 21 days in Rules.

In line to succeed Smith as
Rules Committee chairman is
Rep. William M. Colmer (D-
Miss.), who is 76. Sen. John J.
Sparkman (D-Ala.) is in line
"for the chairmanship of the Sen-
ate Banking and Currency Com-
mittee, which was held by Rob-
ertson—a Congressman and Sen-
ator for the past nearly 34 years.

Redistricting Helps _

Senator Metcalf said in part,
“There has been no showing in
this chamber, or in the record,
that there is a national emer-
gency. If Congress is going to
be involved every time a seg-
ment of an industry . . . or of
our population is inconvenienced,
this will be a very busy Senate.

“Let us vote down both reso-
lutions, and when someone
comes in to show there is a na-
tional emergency, and there is
danger to the health and wel-
fare of the citizens . . . then we
can consider the other legisla-
tion.”

Passage of the resolution fol-
lowed the approval, by a 51 to
36 vote, of an amendment by
Sen. Morse, backed by the Sen-
ate leadership, under which both
Congress and the President
would compel the strikers to re-

al first—aid'

 

turn to work. Both Congress 5

and President Johnson had been

extremely reluctant to take sole

responsibility.
TWA Profits Soar

Machinists President P. L.
Siemiller had wired to every-
Senator urging him to check the
morning newspaper, prior to the
vote, for the six-month profit
report of TWA, which had
jumped 22 percent so far this
year over the same period in
1965.

“I think if
these hearings and told the car-
riers you are not going to bail
them out,” Siemiller later told
the House Commerce Commit-
tee, which is ‘now considering
the Senate-passed bill, “you’d
get a settlement by tomorrow

ident said that he expects_the§;';.’«

H

CONVERTERS OF THE SAN MANUEL DIVISION SMELTER of Magma Copper Company are shown above, with the
anode wheel in the ‘oreground. The smelter has an annual capacity of_ 403,000 tons and, in 1965, handled 314,750
tons of concentrates. ‘Although test drilling was first done at San Manuel's mine in 1917, it was not until operations

were taken over by Magma that San Manuel became a major producer.

Its first production reached the market in

1956. Smelter Workers, together with mine and mill employees at San Manuel, are represented by Mine-Mill Local 937.

AS&R Building World's Tallest Stock

The American Smelting and Refining Company has started
construction of what will be the world’s tallest smokestack, 825
feet high, at its El Paso, Texas smelter. Replacing a 400-foot stack
built in 1917, it will carry smoke and fumes to a higher altitude,
lessening possible air pollution problems over El Paso.

Diameter of the stack will be 621/2 feet at the bottom and 31
feet, 3 inches at the top. It is expected to be completed next year.

Another stack at the El Paso smelter, completed in 1960, is
610 feet high and was the world’s tallest when it was completed.

Peabody is the largest U. S. coal producer, and has reserves in
the ground reportedly in excess of 5 billion tons; The deal would
have to be approved by boards of directors of both companies
and by Peabody stockholders. Terms are now being worked out,
but the transaction, if it materializes, will not be until sometime
next year. Trade papers say the purchase price would be about

$465,500,000. * * *

Duval to Mine Copper in Nevada

1 The Duval Corporation, operator of potash and sulphur mines
andtwo copper mines in Arizona, will start producing copper in
Nevada later this year. The company’s two mines, mill, and two

’ ,-precipitation plants are located 10 to 15 miles south of Battle

Mountain, Nevada. Concentrates from the 3,000 ton-per-day -mill
wi1l.,be shipped to the AS&R plant in Tacoma, Washington for
smelting and refining. * * *

Chilean Developments

The government of Chile last month boosted the price of
Chilean copper from 62 cents to 70 cents per pound in European
ymarkets. The move brought the priceof Chilean copper more in
line -with prices then being charged by Congolese, Zambian, and

 other producers selling in Europe. Kennecott and Anaconda com-
’pany;.- subsidiaries in Chile produce nearly 500,000 tons of copper

_-_, per year for the European market,
The price rise to 70 cents means $160 more per ton than at the

.3‘ ‘previous 62-cent price. Thus the Chilean government and the

Chilean subsidiaries of the two U. S. copper giants will share an

 1 "added profit, resulting from the price hike, of about $100 million

- per year.

tr * ‘k .
1 I Four thousand employees at Anaconda’s El Salvador mine and
vsmelterin Chile voted at the end of July to accept a new con-

..~"”lf. tract 5-worked out at the last minute at the bargaining table. Reports

. indicate that the new contract, for 15 months, provides a 29 per-
cent increase in base pay rates plus substantial increases in non-

I . wage beneﬁts.

_..-A strike at El'Salvador had been considered a distinct pos-
sibility. News of the settlement, plus that of recent arrangements

 for increasing the ﬂow, of Zambian copper through Rhodesia to

‘African ports, was followed by declines of several cents per pound

in London from around 70 cents to 621/2. cents per pound. Chile,
however, is holding, hopefully, at 70 cents per pound.

In the U. S., scrap copper around the turn of the month fell by
about 5 cents—to 511/2 cents per pound.

Standard Expands Arizona Prospecting

Standard Metals Corporation’s new copper and zinc discovery
in Arizona, south of Kingman, reported in this column last June,
is slated for further development. Last month, Standard reported
it had negotiated an exclusive prospecting permit with the Santa
Fe Railroad on 2280 acres of railroad-owned land adjacent to
Standard’s Antlers claims. A 640-acre area nearby is being pros-
pected under permit from the State of Arizona.

American Climax Tangles
With Government

.American Metal Climax last month announced price increases
averaging 5 percent on a range of molybdenum products. The
Council of Economic Advisers immediately issued a sharply criti-
cal statement, calling the hikes “totally unjustified and inﬂa-
tionary” and citing American Metal Climax profits last year of
$60 million after taxes on sales of $475 million, for a return of 17
percent on stockholders’ equity.

What happened next isn’t too clear. Company officials con-
ferred with the Council of Economic Advisers a few days later.
What was said in. the conference isn’t known. But following the
conference, American Metal Climax rescinded the increases “at
the specific request of the government." The chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers announced that he was “gratified”
by the rollback, calling it an “act of industrial statesmanship.”

Previously the government has successfully resisted attempted
price increases in copper, aluminum, and steel.

Kennecott, the second largest U. S. producer of molybdenum,
did not raise its prices on molybdenum following American Metal
Climax’s action. Kennecott also played it cool last November when
all other major producers brieﬂy raised their prices on copper
from 36 cents to 38 cents a pound, only to roll the prices back when
the government applied the heat. Kennecott, at that time, did not
budge from the 36-cent price.

PERTH AMBOY, N.J. —— On
June 14, Arbitrator Alfred H.
Brent handed down two awards
reaffirming the seniority pro-
tection provided in the contract
between the Perth Amboy
Smelting and Refining Workers
Union, Mine-Mill Local 365, and
the American Smelting and Re-
fining Company.

James Ballo, one of the rul-=

ings concluded, should have
been promoted to first class
pipefitter as of April 19, 1965-
at which time another employee,
who had less seniority, received
the promotion instead. Ballo,
who was hired into the mainte-
nance department at the plant
in 1955 and who became a pipe-
fitter the following year, was
awarded wage adjustments of
some $200, reflecting such a pro-
motion from the April 19 date.

First class pipefitter wages;
which at that time were $3.135
an hour, rose to $3.215 on July
1, 1965 and to $3.295 this past
July 1.

Second Case

In the other case, Brent found
that AS&R had violated the con-
tract by its failure to assign
James Jackins, also a member
of Local 365, to first class
cupelling work on those occa-
sions between Feb. 28 and June
24, 1965 when such work was
required. A second class cupel-
ler (cupelling involves the re-
covery of gold and silver by the
removal of impurities present in
the composite), J ackins received

the 16%-cent wage differential ,

between his classification and
that of first class cupeller for
the time that he was bypassed
for assignments in the latter
category. The back pay amount-
ed to about $150.

Although Jackins on Feb. 27
had refused to do “bailing,”
which is among the duties of a
first class cupeller, Brent main.-
tained that his seniority entitled
him to another chance to accept
the wo-rk at the higher classi-
fication. The company was
wrong in simply unilaterally
deciding to bypass him and as-
sign such work to others with
less seniority.

Appearing for the union at
the hearings in April were Al-
fred Petit-Clair, Mine-Mill board
member for District 5; John
Infusino, president of Local 365;
and David Mandel, attorney for
the union. The local -union
grievance committee also assist-
ed in the handling of the two
arbitration cases.

THE MINE-MILI. UNION "

In a hard-hitting report, written by H. G. Plimpton, mining health and safety engineer, and
approved by L. D. Knill, subdistrict manager from Salt Lake City, the U.S. Bureau of Mines blamed
the Anaconda Company for the accident in which Fred P. Bates, Jr., 19,, was killed at the 2400-
level of the High Ore Mine in Butte on June 28. Bates’ death, which was reported in the last is-
sue of the Mine-Mill Union, resulted, according to the report, from inadequate roof support at the

shaft station.

The following excerpts are quoted from the bureau’s report:

“Harold Coon, Ed Davies, T. C. Kurilich and Fred Bates (victim) worked on the shaft station
during the morning and had stopped for lunch. Coon and Davis, contract miners, were seated on

' the east side of the shaft station and Bates and Kurilich on the west side of the shaft station. After

V lunch was completed, Bates lay down on a 3 by 12-inch lagging while Kurilich remained in a
\ _- sitting position adjacent to

Bates. The timber cap above the
two men broke suddenly and
without warning. Fine muck and

11" , , rocks fell from the unsupported
. back and completely covered

Bates. Kurilich managed to roll

  away and was not caught by the
Tflow "of fine muck and rocks.

; . “.i. . Two attempts were made ‘
by Coon and Davies, contract

miners, to uncover Bates but

.~‘e_ach time additional loose ma-

terial fell and delayed the at-
tempts. -One rock which weighed
about 400 pounds fell on the pile

 of fine muck before rescue ef-

forts were started. The victim

7 _ was uncovered _about 12:50 p.m.

. . The report submitted by

 Frank Johns, acting coroner,

Silver Bow County, stated that

‘ _ Bates died from suffocation. . . .

“An examination of the broken

I cap‘ showed that dry rot was
present ‘over the surface of the’

cap. However, theinterior ap-
peared solid enough to provide

substantial support. Visual in-

spections of the timber on the
"shaft station were made during

 the _course- of each work day.

isqeezing, bending, and crack-

ing of the timber support was
not‘ observed or reported. Re-

gportedly, several pieces ofthe V

 present timber support on the.

shaft station were the original

I  support pieces. The timber sup-
--port and general condition of

the 2400-level s t a ti o n were
checked about nine months prior

to the time of the accident. A

few posts, caps and girts were
replaced or extra timber_was
installed. , .

“The enlargement of the shaft
station was ‘started about three
weeks before the accident oc-

 .,- .curred. A few drill holes had
, been charged and blasted to ob-
’ Vtain the required width on the

 4 east side’ of the shaft station. In
; addition,"

explosives had been

;,'used to break large boulders

‘which were barred from the
‘back and walls of the enlarge ’

“The direct cause of the acci-

“Compliance with the follow-

’ ing recommendation may pre-

vent accidents of a similar na-
ture: Additional timber support
should be installed throughout

M.D.'s Hit Smelfers
On Pollution

-At a special session on air
pollution earlier this year of the
Arizona Chapter of the Ameri-
can College of Chest Physicians,
doctors charged the state legis-
lature and the copper companies
with failing to help clear the air
of pollution. The panel stated
that unwillingness of the cop-
per industry to eliminate air-pol-
luting smelter smoke could ad-
versely affect Arizona’s tourist
industry. Main sources of pollu-
tion were said to be residue
from smelters and dust from
unpaved streets. -- — ’

A Doctor's View

“Today we continue to have
too high a frequency of old,
well-known occupational diseases
like silicosis, coal worker’s
pneumoconiosis, lead poisoning
and numerous chemical poison-
ings, and also many new or
newly recognized conditions re-
lated to work: chronic bronc-
hitis, occupational cancers, be-
ryllium disease. . . T

“There are frequent cases of
occupationally injured workers
being cared for under their non-
occupational health insurance
because the employer’ wants to
keep down the cost of work-
men’s compensation insurance,

or failure to recognize the condi-

tion is occupational.”

Committee In Every Localt, 
The realization of civil rights for all remains today‘ 

  

the "burning domestic issue of our time, despite, and in

some cases because of, the legislative gains in this area 3f?-
during the past few years. In recognition of this fact,- 1:
the Mine-Mill executive board, meeting in Denver from gr-1“?
July 10 to 12,'agreed that a major effort must be made] '
to ensure that each Mine-Mill local has an active, func— 

tioning civil rights committee.

Additionally, the board decided that an international

union civil rights fund be established, which would chan-

nel donations to civil rights or-
ganizations and activities most
in need of financial help.

Committee Functions

Purposes of civil rights com_-
mittees on the local level are
manifold. In addition to fund-
raising, such committees can
work to see that discrimination
is completely eliminated in the
hiring and promotion policies of
the worker’s employer and of
other employers in the area.
The group can aid in the activi-
ties of local civil rights organ-
izations, which might include
such things as boycotts,
marches, etc. Issues such as
fair housing and equality of edu-
cational opportunities might be
tackled. Finally, the committee
can serve a vital purpose sim-
ply by making sure that the
workers at that local’s property
are kept abreast of civil rights
developments on local, state,
and national levels.

Aware that Mine-Mill has been
in the forefront of many civil
rights struggles over the years,
the board. noted, too, that many
of the union’s locals have such

committees and have partici-

pated in these important bat-
tles. It i_s simply because the
struggle is such a crucial one
that the effort will be made to
revitalize any committee that
may have become inactive and

to establish new groups in any
local that may not have had one.

The subject undoubtedly will
be -further discussed at the
Mine-Mill national staff meet-
ing to be held in Denver later
this month. '
