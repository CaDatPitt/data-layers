conspiracy doctrine, all three men are guilty-——-even the man who never
knew about the golf balls.

This is the doctrine under which the Mine-Mill people have been
convicted. If this doctrine were upheld almost no union leader in the
country could escape its bitter claws. As we shall soon see, even the officers
of the AFL in 1947-194-9—from William Green down—co1ild have been
convicted of the same charge of “conspiracy to defraud the government.”
Of course, the government did not indict the AFL leadership because
that would have created an irrepressible protest. But the Mine-Mill union,
centered in the Rocky Mountain area, off the beaten path, isolated from
AFL-CIO, is a much easier target.

Consider the speciﬁcs of the Mine-Mill case. The trial begins on
November 2, 1959, in the federal court in Denver. The indictment against
the eleven defendants was handed down three years earlier, but it has
lain on the table all this time. The defendants include Irving Dichter,
secretary-treasurer of Mine-Mill; Asbury Howard, a vice president; Jack
C. Marcotti, regional director in the Arizona area; board members Al
Skinner, Raymond Dennis, Chase Powers; staff members Harold San-
derson, Charles Wilson and Jesse Van Camp; former secretary-treasurer
Maurice E. Travis—no longer associated with the union; and former staff
member James Durkin.

Three of these men were never required by the law to sign non-
communist aﬂidavits. Dichter was not an officer of the union until a num-
ber of years after the so-called conspiracy was hatched. But they’re all in
the dock.

Defending the Mine-Mill unionists is the well-known civil liber-
tarian lawyer, retired Brigadier General Telford Taylor, who acted as
United States prosecutor duringthe famous trial of leading Nazis at
Nuremburg. With him is George J. Francis, a Republican attorney in
Denver, and Nathan Witt, Mine-Mill’s regular counsel. On the other side
is L. E. Broome, a Mine-Mill specialist for the Justice Department who
has handled other cases against this union as well. He has three assistants
by his side. On the bench is Judge Alfred A. Arraj.

The charge is that the eleven men conspired with four “co-con-
spirators”——communist leaders John Williamson, Gil Green, Fred Fine
and Arthur Bary——-to illegally use the services of the National Labor Rela-
tions Board.When eight of them “falsely” signed non-communist affidavits
they were “conspiring to defraud the government.” The “co-conspirators,”
it would be noted, are not on trial. They are supposed to be the top com-
munist leaders who allegedly laid down the policies for lesser lights to
follow, but they’re not in this case. They haven’t even been indicted.
Could it be that the government did not feel conﬁdent it could adequately

 

 

tie them together with the defendants?

The date and the setting are most interesting. November 2, 1959,
happens to be a few weeks after the Landrum-Griﬁin law was passed.
Under the new law, Taft-Hartley non-communist oaths are abolished. Yet
the eleven Mine-Mill men are charged with violating the abolished sec-
tion. , ,

Even more strange is the fact that November 2, 1959, happens to
be a day when 35,000 miners, the heart of the Mine-Mill union, are in the
midst of a bitter ﬁve-and-a-half-month strike against the major copper
companies. Why were the indictments kept for three long years? Why
was the case sprung only when the union was in a life and death struggle?
Every union man worth his salt can guess the answer.

Equally baﬁling is another aspect. Maurice Travis, former Mine-
Mill secretary—treasurer was brought to trial in another case for falsely
ﬁling the aﬂ‘idavit. He was convicted and his case is now on appeal. But the
Attorney General’s office refuses to follow the same procedure with the
other Mine-Mill members in this case. He doesn’t accuse them of violat-
ing any law———just “conspiring” to violate it. Could it be that the prose-
cutors felt they could not make a case if rigid rules of evidence were
enforced? Could it be that they needed the “elastic” and “sprawling”
rules criticized by Justice Jackson to make a case?

‘PERSONAL AXES TO GRIND’

Many of the government’s witnesses had personal axes to grind.
One had left Mine-Mill and later became Labor Relations Director for
the Kennecott Copper Corporation in Utah. Two or three had been ﬁred
by Mine-Mill. Three were paid agents for the FBI—one had earned $26,-
000 as a Department of Justice “consultant.” Most of them had been
deeply involved in the union’s factional ﬁghts and some had led secession
movements from Mine-Mill. Obviously they were not dispassionate wit-
nesses.

But leaving that aside, the case itself rests on ﬂimsy foundations.
Stripped of legalisms and excess verbiage, it has two parts. Part one in-
volves a man named John Lautner, a former Communist Party official and
FBI undercover agent. Lautner, it seems, attended a meeting at the head-

quarters of the New York State Communist Party. At this meeting a com- V

munist leader was supposed to have outlined a new strategy for Party
members in the unions. Up to that time the C.P. had opposed signing the
non-communist aﬂidavits, but the man whom Lautner heard that day said
that it would now be permissible. Communists would merely write letters
resigning from the Party, and then sign the Taft-Hartley oath. Presumably

..—.. ,,,,.;._._,,;.,._.,,., .. , ...,,.J.,. .. \_,;.. J  . .,-..

this would make it legal because the oath stated that the afﬁant was not
“now” a member of the Communist Party.

This is the ‘heart of the government’s case. Prosecutor Broome
infers from this New York meeting that it was a secret instruction to all
communist union members to “defraud” the government. Lautner him-
self never met any of the Mine-Mill defendants until the case began. No
evidence was introduced that the communist leaders in New York com-
municated with the alleged conspirators in any way, or sent them instruc-
tions either written or oral. But according to Mr. Broome that wasn’t
necessary. The government only had to show that: A) The Communist
Party proposed a method to evade the law; and B) if a union man was a
member of the Communist Party he is liable to the charge of “conspiracy.”

CONCEPT OF ‘COLLECTIVE GUILT’

This is a thin thesis for alleging a crime. It is a concept of “collec-
tive guilt” which is alien to American democracy. In our system a man is
adjudged guilty for something he himself does, not something done or
proposed by an organization to which he belongs. On the government
thesis in this case it could convict almost anyone of conspiracy. Suppose
the heads of a number of large corporations act together to ﬁx prices.
That is an illegal conspiracy. But do the actions of the corporation presi-
dents make every foreman in their plants, every manager in their oﬂices,
also guilty of conspiracy? The democratic process demands that we must
prove that each person individually conspired to evade the law. We can
not establish the foreman’s guilt on the basis of his collective relation to
the company president.

But that is exactly what the government tries to do in the Mine-
Mill case. The co-conspirators—who are not tried—are said to have pro-
posed certain measures to meet the law. Since the Mine-Mill defendants
are accused of having a tenuous relationship with these men in New York,
they are also conspirators—even if they never met the New York people
or discussed the problem with them.

This is a transgression of our concept of individual right that is
exceedingly dangerous.

Broome, addressing the jury, pointed out that “it isn’t necessary
. . . to show that the parties charged as being involved in the agreement
at some time and place gathered around a table and some one of them
announced that ‘We are meeting here for the purpose of conspiring to
defraud the United States.’ ” In other words Broome feels that he doesn’t
have to show any direct link between the New York communists and the
Mine-Mill “conspirators.” He doesn’t have to produce any communica-

 

 

tions, record of meetings, or anything else that would tie them together.
He only must show that they followed “a concert of action . . . all looking
toward achievement of the same end, and that an illegal end.”

Put even more simply, Broome only had to show that the Party
had ordered a certain course and that if the eleven Mine-Mill men could
be proved to be communists they were guilty. It doesn’t matter that three
of them never signed affidavits, or that some, like Irving Dichter and
Asbury Howard didn’t sign them until 1954 or later, years after the New
York meeting Lautner described. All that Broome feltwas necessary was
to show that the defendants were still acting like communists. In two
instances, that of Asbury Howard and Jack C. Marcotti, the prosecutor
could not even prove his case on this broad basis. Judge Arraj dismissed
the charges against them entirely.

For the rest, the communist connection is tenuous. Various wit-
nesses testiﬁed that they attended meetings in such and such a hotel in
Denver or East St. Louis and that these were communist meetings. An-
other witness described a conversation in a drugstore with a defendant
and this was supposed to be on communist business. Still another ex-
plained that he and a defendant talked about Party affairs over the dinner
table in his home.

And that is all! That is the “conspiracy”!

Two questions suggest themselves at this point.

1. Were these men really communists?
2. Whom did they “defraud”? Whom in government or
elsewhere did they hurt?

'EE QUESTION OF COMMUNI SM is a touchy one in pres-
ent day America. Many people are presumed to be communists if they
merely take the constitutionally-provided Fifth Amendment, or if they
are named-—without the right of cross-examination—by a Senate or House
committee. It is a simple thing to label a man a communist. All of us re-
member the speech which launched Senator Joseph McCarthy—in which
he said “I have in my hand” documents to prove that 205 State Depart-
ment officials are communists. The “205” ﬁgure later shrank to a few
dozen, and later to a mere handful and still later to nothing. Only one
man was indicted and he was exonerated.

But let us assume that at least some of the Mine-Mill defendants
were communists. In the case of Maurice Travis, he admitted when he

signed the Taft-Hartley oath in 1949 that he had been a Party member’

prior to that time. Communism is not the "charge against these men. (If

 

 

it were, they should be tried under the Smith Act.) They are tried on a
conspiracy charge relative to the Taft-Hartley law. That is another mat-
ter entirely. And the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt.

We Americans are proud of our rigid rules of evidence. In our sys-
tem of jurisprudence we prefer that a dozen guilty men are; freed while
adhering to these rules, rather than have one man found guilty by ﬂout-
ing democratic safeguards.

lt stretches the imagination beyond credulity to believe that men
who had episodic meetings in drugstores or at dinner tables are PROVED
to have been in a conspiracy.

But let’s assume for the moment that the government did prove
something. What are the eight men who signed the aﬂ‘idavits really guilty
of ? Whom did they hurt? What anti-social act have they committed? No
matter how hard you look for underlying motivations the “crime” of the
aﬂiants was merely that they sought to defend their union.

The Taft-Hartley law, it should be recalled, was passed in 1947.
For the next two years there was vigorous debate in the House of Labor
over its provisions, including the non-communist oath. Many union
leaders refused to sign it; John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers in
fact never attached his name to it and his union did not appear on the
ballots in NLRB elections.

Mine-Mill leaders also refused for a time to comply with the oath
provision. But the pressures for compliance were persistent. Employers
refused to bargain with Mine-Mill. Kennecott Copper put a wage increase
into effect but it no longer recognized the union. It proclaimed publicly
that it would deal with the organization only when it purged itself of the
communist stigma, and it said that it would accept the signing of Taft-
Hartley aﬁidavits as “evidence” of non-communist domination. A thirteen-
month zinc strike was in progress. In Connecticut there was a grave dis-
pute over 5,000 brass workers and in Cleveland over die-casting workers.
Various other unions were chipping away good-sized swatches from the
Mine-Mill cloth. Mine.-Mill organizers all over the country were pressur-
ing the leadership to comply so they could be protected from secession.

Once the main body of labor had decided to sign the affidavits,
there was little alternative but tocomply. In one place after another a
rival union challenged Mine-Mill at plants or mines where it had had bar-
gaining rights for years. The rival would petition the National Labor
Relations Board for an election and would appear on the ballot. Mine-
Mill, because it had failed to comply, would counsel its members to merely
vote no——against any union. Mine-Mill could then strike and force recog-
nition. This was the time-honored method before the National Labor

 

 

Relations Board was established in the thirties. Many a militant or radical
unionist in 1947 thought it could be done again.

Unfortunately life proved that it couldn’t. Workers with a long
pro-labor tradition just refused to vote “no union.” Mine-Mill, it should
be remembered, traces its lineage to the militant Western Federation of
Miners and the radical Industrial Workers of the World. In every mining
town there are still old Wobblies who can not countenance the idea of
being without a union. Furthermore Mine-Mill was embarrassed when
it found itself on the same side of the fence with management, which was
also telling workers to cast a “no” ballot.

The end result was that in many places Mine-Mill took a severe
beating. Unless it could use the facilities of the Labor Board it faced the
prospect of being whittled away to a shadow. Regardless of what the Com-
munist Party thought or felt, regardless of how pigheaded the communist
leaders were in New York, regardless whether the Mine-Mill leaders were
communists or “fellow travelers,” the logic of events forced them to com-
ply with the law, just as it forced other unionists—for instance, CIO presi-
dent Phil Murray, who complied about the same time as Mine-Mill. These
men, too, were hostile to the oath provision, but once some of the union
leaders began to sign, others had to follow or suﬂer heartbreaking raids
on their ranks. Only a strong union like the coal miners could resist to the
end-—and even then there is no doubt that District 50 of Lewis’ union
would have gained tens of thousands more members if it could have used
the Labor Board facilities.

TO DEFEND THE UNION

Whether the Communist Party changed its view on non-compliance
or not, whether the Communist Party ordered its members to sign the
oaths or not, it is clear that the only purpose for compliance was to defend
the union, prevent it from fragmenting, and preserve bargaining rights.
This is hardly an anti-social attitude on the part of the union’s leaders,
one that warrants imprisonment. To defend the rights of the rank and ﬁle
to retain their union is, in our union scale of values, a meritorious act; and
we have bitterly criticized the Taft-Hartley law because it deprives many
workers of this right——through the secondary boycott provisions, the ex-
clusion of strikers from Labor Board elections, as well as the oath.

Perhaps a few of the Mine-Mill leaders were communists; Maurice
Travis admitted that he had been a Party member until 1949. But it would
have made no difference. The logic of events was forcing just about every
union to comply with the oath provisions of Taft-Hartley. Whether a
Mine-Mill leader was a communist or a Republican he could understand

this point without having to talk with any one in New York. If he was to
save his union from raids and loss of membership he had to comply with
the Taft-Hartley provisions. All the other unions that were charged with
“communist domination” by the C10 in 1949-50 also complied. But except
for Mine-Mill none of the leaders of these other organizations have been
tried for “conspiracy.” ,

No matter how one looks at the case, it is impossible to conclude
that the oaths are the real issue. The fact that the case went to court dur-
ing a major strike indicates that the purpose was to harass a union, rather
than to see that justice was done. Reading the history of Mine-Mill since
l950—with all its contested Labor Board elections, the factionalism in its
ranks, the secession of some of its locals — it is clear that the union had
some difficult days. Many employers and many conservative government
oﬁicials must have seen an opportunity to deliver the coup de grace. One
can only deduce that it is this, rather than any violation of law or immoral
act, which motivated the actions of the Attorney General.

A word must be said at this point about communism. The more
one studies the Mine-Mill case the more clear it becomes that this is the
real issue. There is little doubt that for some years the Mine-Mill union
had some leaders who were friendly to the Communist Party. There is
little doubt, too, that the role of many communists in our trade union
movement has been factional and bureaucratic. The ﬂip-ﬂops of com-
munist leaders every time there was a change in policy in Moscow has
been a source of constant friction in the labor movement. Communists
shifted from being anti-Roosevelt until 1934 to pro-Roosevelt until 1939;
anti-Roosevelt and anti-war during the period of the Hitler-Stalin Pact;
to pro-Roosevelt and pro-war after Russia was attacked by Germany;
anti-Truman and anti-CIO policy when the cold war began, etc. Such
zig-zags are untenable. They hardly make for conﬁdence on the part of
rank and ﬁle members who are asked to change their positions based on
the winds that waft in from Moscow rather than their own personal needs.

Yet the fact remains that communism in itself is no crime in Amer-
ica. Furthermore, it is an irrelevant matter so far as the Mine-Mill leader-
ship is concerned today.

The Mine-Mill Executive Board on January 18, 1957, issued a state-
ment that: “The leaders of this union hold no brief for communism,
the Communist Party, or its program. We are ‘opposed to all forms of
dictatorship, including the communist, and we stand as always for the
elimination of all attacks on freedom of thought and civil rights, whether
the arena is Hungary, South Africa, or the public schools, buses, mining
camps, and factories of our own United States.” No disciplined commu-

 

nist would condemn the brutal Soviet actions in Hungary in 1956. The r

 

fact that the Mine-Mill leaders did so is testament to their present politi-
cal beliefs.

For anyone interested in the strange history of American commu-
nism this background may have some signiﬁcance. Certainly union men
are justiﬁed in considering it. But it is hardly the issue in the Mine-Mill
case. There is something broader and much more fundamental involved.

T;'IE ISSUE IS THE CONSPIRACY LAW, and it would be
myopic for other labor leaders to view the Mine-Mill case in any other
light. If the conspiracy doctrine remains unchallenged, there are few
union leaders immune from prosecution, and few unions free from politi-
cal blackmail. Even the AFL leadership of 1948 and 1949 could have been
put in the dock on the same charges. When the AFL decided to sign the
non-communist affidavits in 1947, it found itself in an unhappy dilemma.
Under its constitution the president, secretary-treasurer, and all its vice
presidents were considered “oﬁicers.” But one of these officers, Vice Presi-
dent John L. Lewis, stated categorically he would not sign. And if Lewis
didn’t sign, AFL aﬂiliates would not be able to use the services of the
Labor Board, even if the other oﬁicers did sign. The AFL solved the
dilemma by altering its constitution so that vice presidents were no longer
listed as “oﬂicers” but merely as “board members.” The only two people
required to ﬁle aﬂidavits under this new circumstance were the President
and Secretary-Treasurer. From the legal standpoint, this has all the in-
gredients of the Mine-Mill case. The AFL officials “agreed” together to
circumvent the strictures of the law and they committed the “overt” act
of changing their by-laws to do so. By the Attorney General’s deﬁnition
it is “conspiring to defraud.” But, of course, no action was ever taken
against the AF L. The government held its ﬁre for more vulnerable organi-
zations, and it held its ﬁre until it could hurt the union during a long
strike.

This term “defraud” incidentally is an interesting one. The gov-
ernment alleges that by falsely signing non-communist affidavits a fraud
was committed by Mine-Mill leaders. But what does this fraud consist of?
Merely that by signing the oaths Mine-Mill leaders made available to
80,000 members the right to participate in Labor Board elections and to
ﬁle unfair labor practice charges. What is so fraudulent about that? Cer-
tainly the rank and ﬁle membership is entitled to these services whether
they belong to Mine-Mill or any other union. If their officials sign the
aﬂidavits illegally the ofﬁcials should be dealt with, not the 80,000 rank

 

 

and ﬁle members. As a matter of fact that’s exactly what the Supreme
Court ruled in another Mine-Mill case.

Back in May 1954-, when a Chicago company refused to deal with
Mine-Mill on the grounds that it was communist-dominated the National
Labor Relations Board decertiﬁed the union. This was taken to the courts
and in 1956 Justice William 0. Douglas, speaking for a unanimous Su-
preme Court, issued the ruling that the government had been wrong. If
there was any crime committed it was on the part of those who signed
the aﬁidavits, not the membership. The penalty should be assessed against
the former, not the latter.

Justice Douglas stated for the Supreme Court that NLRB “has no
authority to deprive unions of their compliance status under the non-
communist aﬂcidavitvprovision” and that “the only remedy for the ﬁling
of a false afﬁdavit is the criminal penalty” which the law provides.

No one has been defrauded by the signing of the non-communist
oaths and no one-—least of all the government——has been hurt—except
perhaps other unions that might have been able to win Labor Board elec-
tions if Mine-Mill were off the ballot. But this is not the affair of the U.S.
government. And the fact is that with all the negative publicity of com-
munism and communist-domination the rank and ﬁle workers have in
an overwhelming majority of cases voted for Mine-Mill. They were told
over and over again about “communism” and “communist leaders” in
their union but they still chose this organization. Whether they were right
or wrong in doing so, who can argue that under our laws they do not have
the right to be represented by a union of their own choosing? This isn’t
“fraud”; it is democracy of the highest order.

No matter how one views the issue of communism no one can view
with equanimity the persistent hounding of this union, the persistent
attempt to “get” it no matter how far aﬁeld the government must go to
do so.

The union was expelled from CIO in 1950. Two years later the Mc-
Carran Committee conducted hearings in Salt Lake City directed against
Mine-Mill.

In April 1953 a Mine-Mill organizer from Silver City, New Mexico,
named Clinton J encks, was indicted on -charges of ﬁling a false non-com-
munist aﬂidavit. This was the case in which a government informer,
Harvey Matusow, later recanted his testimony and appeared as a union
witness. The Supreme Court eventually overruled the lower courts on the
ground that J encks’ attorneys had no access to FBI records in cross-exam-
ining government witnesses. J encks was freed.

In December 1955 Maurice Travis was convicted of ﬁling false non-
communist afﬁdavits and sentenced to eight years and an $8,000 ﬁne. The

 

 

 

case was reversed by the Appeals Court and retried. Iietrial resulted in
another conviction January 1958 and another eight-year sentence, though
the ﬁne was reduced to $4,000. It is currently in the second appeals proc-
ess and the Supreme Court will hear the case soon; it has granted certi-
orari.

In May 1954 the NLRB decertified the union at the Precision Sci-
entiﬁc Co. When the Supreme Court reversed the NLRB, the Arizona
Republic editorialized (December 16, 1956) : “So this method of forcing
the union to divest itself of its Red leadership has failed.” The January
1957 Engineering and Mining ]ournal—an employer’s organ—carried an
article under the headline “Supreme Court Saves Mine-Mill.” Its text
said: “The GoVernment——Two Swings to go: With one strike against it
in court, the Government is pushing two other attempts to pin the Com-
munist-inﬁltrated label on Mine-Mill and its officers.” Those were the
Subversive Activities Control Board proceedings and the present con-
spiracy case.

In August 1955 the union and its leadership were charged under
the McCarran Communist Control Act. Proceedings before the SACB
still continue. What the government hopes to accomplish by this is hard
to determine. Not even the government attorney, L. E. Broome, can seri-
ously believe that a favorable ruling by SACB can do anything more than
continue the harassment. Even if Mine-Mill were to be labeled “commu-
nist-inﬁltrated” and ordered disbanded, there is at least ﬁve years of liti-
gation ahead and the exceedingly doubtful prospect that the Courts would
permit such a ruling to stand. The only justiﬁed conclusion is that the
government is using the proceedings merely as a means of embarrassing
the union and its leaders.

In November 1956 the present conspiracy case was initiated. After
keeping the indictment in its ﬁles for three years the Attorney General
ﬁnally dusted it off during the recent copper strike.

VENDETTA AGAINST A UNION

Everything about the government’s behavior is indicative of a
vendetta rather than an impartial application of justice. Business Week
of November 24, 1956, caried the headline “Try, Try Again.” “With two
irons already in the ﬁre,” it said, “the government late last week made
a third attempt to brand the independent Mine-Mill and Smelter Workers
as a communist-inﬁltrated organization.” The Engineering and Mining
Journal, noted in December 1956 that “should the Justice Department be
successful in its charges the result could split the union wide open. . . .
A conviction from any of the three current moves—the trial of 14 officers,

-M>‘iamzvianuam4Zi-:-awAwn:-79¢-:-2wez-:dA4<-;.aw:-'-'.:-)-4.Lyumuéuﬁiannaaa-iﬁf-ﬂunk-.\II»\g.)x-stat'  -W.»o...-.-..-.Va..-.M.AV...u.....z..wm.2..-.....,....,:..x.............-.--.»......m-M.-....-.w.—....m..........m-.-.......m.,.-.-............«- ....- ....aw_-.-................x..;....;.w..—.-W.................-.......................... , .....- .,...............-....................- -..u- ..,...-...-...............,..............-..-...-....-......m....~..-..m.i.-.;..........- ................m....- .....m.m............-............—- .r..-...-........A..-..........,................ .......-......_............._._. .......v.-....-....-............m........ .. -...........

the SACB action, and pending decisions by the Supreme Court—might
start the mine union on the downhill road.”

Is this the job of government—to start a union “on the downhill
road,” or split it “wide open”? To push it and hound it until it is ex-
hausted, or extinct? Or is the task of government to enforce the law
equally and indiscriminately? It is signiﬁcant that one of the government
witnesses admitted perjury during the trial itself—about his marital
status and about his desertion from the army. Yet to this day he has not
been prosecuted. These may be small matters, yet if the law is to be ad-
ministered fairly what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. In
the light of the Landrum-Griﬁin revocation of the non-communist oath
the Mine-Mill conspiracy charge is also a small matter at best. Reading
the record of the case and putting it in the context of ceaseless “try, try
agains” there is an inescapable feeling that the Justice Department prose-
cutors are not interested in impartial justice as much as in “getting” the
union and its leaders.

Mine-Mill leaders estimate that the federal government has spent
$1.6 million in these activities against it. Scores of FBIiagents have inter-
viewed union members and friends around the country. What this can
mean in a small mining community of a few thousand people is obvious.
An atmosphere of suspicion grows as each local union and each town
learns that there is an FBI investigation. The effects of such harassment
were evident when a moving picture called “Salt of the Earth” was re-
leased a few years ago. This was based on a strike by Mine-Mill in New
Mexico. The union itself did not make the picture or invest any money
in it, but theatres around the country were pressured not to show it and
projectionists in various places refused to turn their projectors when the
movie was scheduled.

The creation of such an atmosphere against any union is an un-
mitigated evil. We have witnessed in recent years what has happened to
the labor movement as a result of the McClellan hearings into Teamster
Union affairs. The original target was Dave Beck and later Jimmy Hoffa,
but the effects of the hearings, the monitorship imposed by Judge F.
Dickinson Letts, the trials of Hoffa, have resulted in stigma against the
whole labor movement. It will be some time before the movement re-
covers from this blow.

The hounding of Mine-Mill, though not so publicized, is equally
pernicious. Not only does it create diﬂiculties for some people who have
severed their relations with the Communist Party; not only does it inﬂict
on the public the mistaken notion that a large number of unions are “com-
munist-dominated”; but in establishing the conspiracy doctrine it forges
a sledge-hammer with which all of labor can be battered.

LEADING UNIONISTS SEE THREAT

Many important unionists in the AFL-CIO see this clearly. O. A.
Knight, President of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers and a vice
president of AF L-CIO, writes:

“We are gravely concerned about the prosecution of sev-
eral officers and employees of your (Mine-Mill) organization on
a charge of conspiring to defraud the Government by falsely
signing non-communist aﬁidavits.

“Several aspects of the prosecution seem most peculiar to
us—the fact that three of the individuals convicted never signed
the aﬁidavits, the fact that more than three years elapsed between
the handing down of the indictment and beginning the trial, the
fact that trial ﬁnally began in the midst of a long strike by your
Union against the Big Five copper companies and the fact that
trial began after the Taft-Hartley Act was amended to eliminate
the requirements for non-Communist aﬂidavits.

“Even more disturbing is the fact that the prosecution is
based on a ‘conspiracy’ charge. Historically the conspiracy
charge has been a major device in attempts to destroy trade
unionism. It will be a terrible blow to American unions if the
conspiracy device again comes into common usage in the prose-
cution and persecution of unions.”

Michael J. Quill, President of the AFL-CIO Transport Workers
Union writes:

“It is with serious concern and grave alarm that we view
the prosecution of officers and members of the Mine, Mill and
Smelters Union on a ‘conspiracy’ charge. We thought that such a
charge, used often against the labor movement in this country
during its infancy, had been relegated to the dust heap of history,
where it belongs. Any attempt at its revival must be met with the
united opposition of all organized labor!

“It has become evident that the prosecution’s case is mis-
cellaneous hodge-podge. Three of the defendants convicted for
‘conspiring to defraud the Government by falsely signing non-
communist affidavits,’ had never signed any such aﬂidavit. The
timing of the trial to coincide with the long strike waged by your
union against the copper companies, three years subsequent to
the indictment itself and after the amendment to the Taft-Hart-
ley Act eliminating the requirements for the signing of such aﬂi—
davits—-all this seems to smack of anything but impartial
justice!”

Frank Rosenblum, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers, and a venerated member of the House of Labor,

writes :

 

  

“Regardless of political opinion or belief, there is com-
mon cause for concern in this situation. A victory for the At-
torney General would be a victory for the anti-union forces in
the country and a throwback to the long forgotten days when the
trade union movement was continually subjected to so-called
‘conspiracy’ prosecutions. Every legal effort and appeal must be
made to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.”

HOW TO BREAK A STRIKE *

Perhaps most signiﬁcant was the statement by James Leary, assist-
ant regional director of AFL-CIO in the Montana area. Leary was at one
time a leader of the opposition to Reid Robinson and Maurice Travis in
the Mine-Mill union, a ﬁrm anti-communist. He left the organization in
1947.

During the recent copper strike he said:

“With Mine-Mill the government again takes this time to
start trials against union officials and former ofﬁcers charged with
falsifying their Taft-Hartley affidavits. ,.

“Every time Mine-Mill has to hit the bricks the Attorney
General of the United States or his staff starts these trials against
its olﬁcers.

“They don’t give a damn whether they are communists,
but it makes good reading when these people are on strike.”

There, it seems, is the nub of the question.

The conspiracy trials in the ﬁrst half of the 19th century were not
directed against unions because they had evil leaders, but because they
were ﬁghting the social evil of low wages. When the government begins
a new wave of conspiracy cases—against an AFL Textile union for “con-
spiring to dynamite,” and the ILGWU for “conspiracy to violate the
Sherman Anti-Trust Law,” and against Mine-Mill for “conspiracy to de-
fraud”—the conclusion is inescapable that the real target is not a few
union leaders or a few unions, but the militancy and strivings of labor
itself.

INTRODUCTION

This pamphlet ably p_leads before the sovereign American people
the cause of some union men, past or present leaders of the Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers Union, who are appealing to the higher courts
their conviction for “conspiracy to defraud the government” by falsely
signing non-Communist affidavits under the Taft-Hartley law.

The issue is not communism but justice. And there is no better
aid to communism than denial of justice in a land which boasts of the
devotion to justice even to those to whom we may not wish to be just.

The prosecution in this case has much to explain. Three of the
men indicted for conspiracy never signed the aﬂidavits; the trial began
after the Taft-Hartley Law was amended by the Landrum-Griﬂin Act
which abolished the requirement of ‘non-Communist oaths; and it was
instituted in the midst of a strike of the Union against the Big Five Cop-
per Companies more than three years after the original indictment had
been handed down. For these and other reasons, it is difficult to resist
the conclusion that the government was willing to do a little union-
busting in the name of anti-Communism under the forms of law.

In any case the whole dubious doctrine of guilt in conspiracy is so
deeply involved that should the decision of the lower court be sustained,
civil liberties for us all would be less secure. Victory would go to the
bureaucracy of a garrison state which is willing to sacriﬁce justice to a
fetish called security. This is the conclusion I am forced to reach after
reading the pamphlet which I commend to you.

THE MINE-MILL CONSPIRACY CASE

by Sidney Lens

EIGHT SHOEMAKERS stood before the bar of justice in
Philadelphia, March 1806, charged with “conspiracy”—conspiracy to
form a union and raise their wages. The prosecutor argued that an indi-
vidual worker could himself ask for a wage increase, but when two or
more did it together it was a . . . conspiracy. The shoemakers were con-
victed and their union dissolved.

In the years that followed the doctrine of conspiracy, borrowed
from the ancient -common law of England, was used against union tailors,
hatters, spinners, carpet weavers, and others. Finally in 1842 the courts
reversed themselves, holding that unions did not ﬁt this “conspiracy”
concept.

Who would have thought then, that more than a hundred years

A later government officials in the United States would resort to the same

ruse? Who would have thought that the same doctrine would be dusted
off once again to hamstring the labor movement? Unfortunately, this is
exactly what is happening.

Nine unionists, present or past leaders of the Mine, Mill and Smel-
ter Workers Union, have been convicted of “conspiracy to defraud the
government” by f alsely_signing non-communist affidavits under the Taft-
Hartley law. (The case against two others was thrown out by the judge
for lack of evidence.) Unless the upper courts reverse this decision they
face prison terms of eighteen months to three years.

Through the years many labor leaders have been in similar posi-
tions. Many have paid for their views and allegiances with jail sentences.
But there is far more involved in this case. It is not only the nine men who
may be victimized——or their union. A wedge has been opened in an old-
door, and if it is permitted to widen it bodes ill for the whole House of
Labor.

‘It would be the line of least resistance for some unionists to turn
their backs on the Mine-Mill case. After all the union was expelled by
C10 in 1950 for “communist-domination.” The defendants were branded
by the government with the unpopular epithet “communist.” Union offi-
cials of AFL-CIO may thereforeconsider this an irrelevant cause and lull
themselves to sleep with the false assurance that “it cannot happen to us.”

History has proven all too often, unfortunately, that it can and
does “happen to us.” What starts as a campaign against a vulnerable seg-

ment of labor tends to spread to the less vulnerable. After the Haymarket
riots in 1886, the legal attack against the anarchist leaders widened to
include the Knights of Labor and the newly-formed American Federation
of Labor. The injunctions used against the American Railway Union dur-
ing the Pullman strike, and the Sherman Anti-Trust Law used against the
Danbury Hatters’ in 1908, were turned against other organizations as well.
Whether we like it or not the cause of unionism is indivisible: all unions
gain from labor’s big victories and lose from its setbacks—no matter where
the victories or defeats originate.

This is already happening with the revived conspiracy doctrine.
Mine-Mill was the ﬁrst target, having been indicted in 1956; now the tar-
get is widening to include not only independent unions but AFL-CIO
organizations as well.

In 1959 eight members of the AFL-CIO Textile Workers Union
were similarly charged and similarly found guilty. Vice President Boyd
E. Payton, the director of Textile in the Carolinas, and seven of his asso-
ciates, are serving prison terms of three to ten years for no other crime
than trying to defend their union in the bitter strike against the Harriet-
Henderson Cotton Mills at Henderson, N. C.

The Textile case, like the Mine-Mill case, is so far-fetched it stag-
gers the imagination. How, one wonders, could anyone be convicted on
such a ﬂimsy presentation in this day and age? Yet they were.

The appeals brief of the Textile Workers throws light on a fan-
tastic story. The “conspiracy,” it seems, began with an agent provocateur,
Harold E. Aaron, hired by the State Bureau of Investigation. It was this
man who discussed the plans for dynamiting in motel room meetings and
who planned to lead them. The meetings, of course, were secretly tape-
recorded and Aaron turned up as the state’s star witness in an alleged
conspiracy that he himself hatched and proposed. Nothing was ever dyna-
mited, no crime ever committed. Everything in this case smells of a delib-
erate attempt to “get” the Textile leaders. But the men stand convicted.

This instance like that of Mine-Mill emphasizes the dangerous
character of the conspiracy doctrine. If there is not enough evidence to
prosecute someone for an actual crime, the government hails unionists
into court on the charge of “conspiracy.” Slowly but perceptibly this club
is being wielded in an ever-broadening circle. In addition to the Textile
and Mine-Mill cases, there is that of the AF L-CIO International Ladies’
Garment Workers’ Union in New York, charged with “conspiracy to vio-
late the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.” Former officials of a local union of the
United Electrical Workers (UE) were tried in Cleveland for “conspiracy”
to violate the Taft-Hartley Act.

What is so pernicious about the conspiracy doctrine is that it opens

 

 

 

the door to far-fetched evidence. You don’t have to commit a crime; you
only have to talk about it——and take some “overt” act. And you don’t
have to sit down in a room and actually plan the details of something
illegal; you only have to have a general and often tenuous “agreement.”

It is no wonder that eminent jurists have been critical of conspiracy
trials. The late Chief Justice, William H. Taft, pointed out that such cases
permit introduction of “much improper evidence.” Judge Learned Hand
observed that there are opportunities for “great oppression” in conspiracy
indictments.

ELASTIC, SPRAWLING, PERVA SIVE

Typical of the criticism levelled against the conspiracy doctrine is
that by Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson.

Justice Jackson wrote in 1949 that the conspiracy law is “elastic,
sprawling and pervasive . . . As a practical matter, the accused often is
confronted with a hodgepodge of acts and statements by others which he
may never have authorized or intended or even known about, but which
help to persuade the jury of the existence of the conspiracy itself. In other
words, a conspiracy often is proved by evidence that admissible only upon
the assumption that the conspiracy existed.”

If permitted to stand, the ramiﬁcations of this conspiracy theory
are endless. .

Suppose two union leaders discuss putting a mass picket line
around a plant. Suppose further that the courts in that state consider
mass picketing illegal or have issued an injunction against it. Unionist
“A” says to Unionist “B”: “We’ll never win this strike unless we have
mass picketing and keep the scabs out.” Unionist “B” agrees. Meantime,
“A,” without consulting “B,” mimeographs leaﬂets giving instructions on
how the picketing should be carried out. Perhaps the strike is settled
before the leaﬂets are given out, or perhaps “A” decides it was a bad idea
after all. No mass picketing takes place. Yet the government can haul not
only “A” but “B” into court, and charge them both with an illegal con-
spiracy. Despite the fact that “B” was no longer involved, despite the fact
that nothing illegal actually took place the men can be convicted under
this “elastic, sprawling and pervasive” doctrine of “conspiracy.”

Or suppose that a union leader tells his executive board that
“something ought to be done about the scabs.” And suppose that unbe-
knownst to him two other members of the board decide that the best
thing to do is throw some golf balls through the strikebreakers’ windows.
They buy a couple of golf balls at the drugstore. But after thinking it over
they change their minds. Once again, under the elastic provision of the
