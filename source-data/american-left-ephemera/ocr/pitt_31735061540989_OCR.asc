INTRODUCTION

Throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America a power struggle of monumen-
tal proportions is being waged between revolutionaries and U.S. technology.
The well-tested strategy of Washington is clear; technological intervention
has been refined to service a complete system of social controls. The strat-
egy and the system is three-pronged: nationalist liberation forces opposing
U.S. domination must be (1) isolated, splintered, and contained through in-
filtration, manipulation and co-optation; (2) failing at this, the United
States must provide the local military with the training and equipment need-
ed to uncover, isolate and destroy armed insurgency before a popular base
is established; and (3) failing at this, the U.S. military must take over
and directly confront and defeat popular armed struggle by offsetting its
numerical superiority with sophisticated search-kill technology.

On all counter-revolutionary fronts--infiltration, manipulation, in-
direct and direct armed confrontation--universities have provided essential
resources for waging more effective battles. Without the "scholarly" efforts
of political scientists, sociologists, economists, psychologists, and anthro-
pologists, isolating the rebels and "managing social change" in a "backward"
society would be impossible. Without the brainpower of engineers, physicists,
chemists, biologists and computer experts, sophisticated military hardware
for detecting and destroying insurgent movements would not be available.
Aside from training and channeling such skilled personnel for the "national
interest," the university provides a relatively "neutral" and relaxed set-
ting for conducting government and corporate research or operations. As any
industrial psychologist would say, academics are far more imaginative, pro-

“ductive and happy when they identify with their product. Behind the guise of
an academic discipline and claims of "objective" research, a well-paid and
essentially self-supervised professor can safely develop the latest nerve
gas without ruffling his sensibilities. The university setting is an attrac-
tive cover that eliminates conscience and maintains high productivity. The
military-industrial complex is relying heavily on the innovative abilities

of the academic world for defeating revolutionary solutions to the increas-
ing exploitation and misery of the Third World.

Given such a situation, radicals and revolutionaries who want to crys-
talize the real issues involved in government-sponsored projects must zero
in on the direct role such "academic work" plays in wars against national
liberation. Most liberals and some radicals, confining their_analysis to a

narrow and out-dated definition of the university, demand greater campus
"autonomy" to insure "objectivity." This is not the real issue. By restrict-
ing its analysis to purely local and domestic concerns, this line of dissent
becomes vulnerable to attack on civil-libertarian grounds if it increases
its militancy. But by broadening the analysis to confront the reality of how
the government uses scholarly research for counter-revolutionary purposes, 3
the real issues are brought into focus. And in order to focus and fix atten-
tion on the real issues involved, it is absolutely necessary to secure de-

tailed information on the academic project's potential and actual utiliza-
tion. Undoubtedly the substantive nature of the project and the depth of in-
volvement will largely determine the limits of discussion, the lines of div-
ision, and ultimately the type of demands and the form of struggle that can
develop. But without detailed knowledge of the practical application of
scholarly research, it is almost impossible to break through liberal obfus-

’cation in the rarified university atmosphere. As long as civil libertarian

abstractions are allowed to preempt the overriding realities of human con-
flict, a politics of confrontation will seem illegitimate and self-defeating.
This of course is exactly what the administration is aiming for; if the rad-
icals escalate their demands and tactics before shifting debate away from
liberal abstractions, they can be isolated and defeated. Only the wide-spread
dissemination of detailed information of the political (as opposed to the
scholarly) objectives of a project can prevent this from occuring.

How then does one gather those details about a project that best reveal
its actual function? There are certainly no fool-proof formulas; yet exper-
ience has demonstrated that specialized sources and an investigatory tech-
nique can be helpful. Precision with regard to details and the ability to
follow-up seemingly insignificant leads are crucial in entering any strange
culture. The specialized jargon of government research and operations is

especially difficult to master. Strange euphemisms creep into the language
of project titles (e.g., "The Defeat of a Target Through Thermal Heat," "A
State-of-the—Art Study on the Impairment of Voluntary Nervous Systems.") The
acquisition of specialized information and the aid of a friendly expert in
the field will uncover what is behind such titles.

INVESTIGATING GOVERNMENT-SPONSOED
OPERATIONS

Most all govemment-sponsored operations are
handled through a contract or grant. Each govem-
ment department funds its own contracts and/or"
grants and makes public in various forms informa-
tion about unclassiﬁed agreements. Unfortunately,
since there is no single public list of all government
contracts and grants, the investigator is obliged to
work with fragmentary and diverse sources. By shift-
ing back and forth between various sources and
utilizing various techniques. however. he will usually
be able to accumulate enough detail to determine
the political content of the project. .

The investigating job involves four basic procedures:
(I) searching printed sources produced off-campus,
(2) searching printed sources produced on-campus,
(3) searching other printed sources for details on the
project's subject content, personnel and facility, and
(4) ﬁeld work to acquire details not readily available
in printed sources. ’

SEARCHING PRINTED SOURCES
PRODUCED OFF CAMPUS

Most govemment-sponsored university operations
are unclassiﬁed and some departments’ contracts or
grants are listed in public documents.’ The problem
is not so much secrecy as obscurity; most people do
not know the sources exist or where they can be
located. In Table I, 16 sources produced off-campus
(I2 unclassiﬁed and readily available to the public)
are broken down according to their publication status,
classiﬁcation, subject, content, and index arrangement.
Available in the library or through purchase (except
for the classiﬁed or restricted sauces), they provide
basic data on: the contract/ grant number, sponsoring
agency, chief investigator, dollar amount, time-period
for the project, project title, project description, and
abstracts of reports resulting from the project The
roman numerals in the 3‘ Source” column of Table I
correspond to the roman numerals listed below‘ with
the complete reference: —

* Throughout this section "govemment-sponsored opera-
tions or protects” refers to all endeavors financed and/or
run directly or indirectly by any part of the U.S. Gov-
ernment for any service, product. idea. advice. etc. Any
individual connected to such operations or projects in
any capacity. ﬁnancial. advisory or otherwise, will be
considered part of that operation. In a contract the
project’s subject and operations are set by the govern-
ment department and sold to the recipient (sometimes
on a competitive basis ), while in a grant the recipient
ﬁrst submits a proposal which the government can
award funds for on a non-proﬁt basis.

XIV. The Smithsonian Institute maintains a national
registry of research in progress called "Science
Information Exchange.“ This is not a printed docu-
ment but rather a service that will. upon request.
send an investigator -all the "Notice of Research
Project” documents on file for a given subject. The
project descriptions are excellent and the coverage
is vast. But only “Research investigators associated
with recognized research institutions” may request
information giving this excellent source a “restricted”
classification. The full address is: Science Informa-
tion Exchange, 300 Madison National Bank Build-
ing. 1730 M Street. N.W.. Washington, D.C. 20036

The “Restricted” (R) classiﬁcations of sources III b
and XIV are administrative, not security designations.
Therefore. it is perfectly legal to ask a "qualiﬁed“
person to search'these sources and turn over ‘the
results. ' A

While relatively complete information is available
in the above sources on most contracts and grants
funded by the AID, NSF, NASA, and PHS, other
departments (the DOD. DOS. ACDA, ‘CIA. and AEC)
are not fully covered by unclassiﬁed listings. The
latter departments are also more crucial when it
comes to foreign policy and military operations.
Except for the CIA, however. a large number of
projects can be u.ncov=:2red through these sources.

SEARCHING PRINTED SOURCES
PRODUCED ON-CAMPUS

To rationalize the management and flow of infor-
mation on campus research, the administrations of
large universities have set up special offices for
handling all aspects of contracts and grants. These
offices prepare regular reports listing all the current
contracts and grants on campus. Though this type
of document is sometimes restricted (at the University
of Michigan it is classiﬁed "Administrative Confiden-
tial“). it is often possible for the campus newspaper
to acquire a copy. The same research ofﬁce usually
puts out a regular newsletter and/or journal distrib-
uted to all the faculty with a list of new contracts

After the existence of military-related contract/grants Abstracts Of articles Published in SCh01aI‘1.V l0U1‘-

on a particular campus has been determined. the in- rials can be found in Abstracts of Computer Litera-

ture, Peace Research Abstracts, Sociological Ab-
stracts, Psychological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts,
Historical Abstracts, Economic Abstracts, Biological
Abstracts, Educational Recap, Indicus Medicus, In-
ternational Political Science Abstracts, Social Science
Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts. Research insti-
tutions also maintain and sometimes publish their

own abstracts of work done by employees (e.g.

Selected Rand Abstracts).

(4) Annotated Bibliographies. Divided along subject

lines, annotated bibliographies serve the same gen-
eral functions for books that abstracts serve for
articles. The Bibliographic Index (New York, H.
W. Wilson Co., semi-annual) is an invaluable tool
for locating bibliographies and keeping track of
new additions. .

(5) Indexes. For cross-referencing, indexes like the

following, for example, should be checked: Applied
Science and Technology Index (New York, H. W.
Wilson, Monthly). New York Times Index, Science
Citation Index (Philadelphia, Institute for Scientific
Information. quarterly). Essay and General Litera-
ture Index (New York, H. W. Wilson and Co.,
monthly), and Cumulative Book Index (New York,
H. W. Wilson and Co., monthly and cumulative).

(6) Proceedings of Professional Associations. Profes-

sional conferences, conventions and meetings often
have sessions related to govemment-sponsored activ-
ity. The papers and discussions in such a setting
are often (a) far more advanced than the published
material in the field, and (b) often attended by
government representatives who publicly and frank-
ly state the assumptions behind “academic” research.
Papens and transcripts are available directly from
the association, and are announced ‘in their respec-
tive journals or Directory of Conventions.

(7) Scholarly Publications. Divided along discipline

and subject lines. the professional journals often
have articles demonstrating how government spon-
sored activities are utilized. The Standard Periodical
Directory (New York, Oxbridge Publishing Co., An-
nual) has a comprehensive list of these journals
indexed by subject and title. Also see the Library
of Congress. A Directory of Information Resources
in the United States: Physical Sciences, Biological
Sciences and Engineering (Washington, D.C., Gov-
ernment Printing Ofﬁce, $2.25) and A Directory of
Information Resources in the United States: Social
Sciences (Washington, D.C., Government Printing
Ofﬁce, $1.50).

(8) U.S. Government Congressional and Executive

Publications. The . U.S. Government Publications
Monthly Catalogue (Washington. Government Print-
ing Ofﬁce, Monthly with cumulative index) has a
subject index and incorporates most federal mate-
rial. Congressional hearings and reports. especially
those of the House and Senate Appropriations.
Armed Services, Education. and Government Opera-
tions Committees and their subcommittees contain
lengthy descriptions of all government-sponsored
activity, testimony from administrators and statis-
tical data. See especially the bibliography prepared
by the Senate Committee on Government Operations.
Subcommittee on Government Research. An Inven-
tory of Corzgre.ssional Concern with Research and

Development (Washington. D.C. 89th Congress. 2nd
Session, U.S. Senate. 1966); House Committee on
Government Operations. Conflicts Between l/re Fed-
eral Research Programs and the .V'ation's Goals for

volumes (Washington. D.C. 89th Congress. 1st
Session, U.S. House of Representatives. I965): U.S.
House of Representatives. House Appropriations
Committee, Armed Services Subcommittee Hearings
on 1967 Defense Appropriations, three volumes,
(Washington, D.C., 90th Congress, Ist Session,
U.S. House of Representatives. 1967). see especially
volume 3. In addition, each government department
sponsoring research has its own periodical(s) and
reports that should be consulted.

(9) Industry Trade Journals and Newsletters. Uni-
versity research is put into hardware production
and operation by private corporations. To utilize
the findings of "academic” research. industry keeps
close watch on its development and discusses the
implications in a vast number of trade publications
geared to the defense market. Unusually frank. these
publications make a habit of indicating how research
projects fit into the total picture of a weapons sys-
tem or military —strategv. Technology Week, Ord-
nance. Aviation Week and Space Technology, Muni-
tions, Missiles and Rockets, and Electronics are just
some of the many items available to the public.
Many others are produced by defense contractors
as in-house organs and get less circulation. The
Standard Periodical Directory lists hundreds of
trade publications according to subject. ‘

(to) Military Publications. The number and diversity
of publications totally devoted to promoting military
operations is staggering (see Standard Periodical
Directory’s “Military” section). Even more frank
than the industry trade publications, they offer very
concrete examples of how research is put into good
use in the field. For a start you might look at
Army, Army Research and Development, Naval
Research Reviews, Review of the Air Force Mate-
rials Research and Development Program, It/Iilitary
Review, Army Information Digest, Air University
Quarterly Review, Marine Corps Gazette. The Air
University ‘Library Index to A/Iilitary Periodicals
(Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, Quarterly) is
a subject index to over sixty military publications
not found in other indexing services.

B. Searching Activities and Associations. of Project
Personnel. Any individual found to be connected to
a government-sponsored project should be investigated
in terms of past and present activities and associa-
tions. Information of this type can throw additional
light on the real purposes and motivations behind a
project. Look at the individual’s employment history
(i.e., name of his previous employers, period of em-
ployment, title or rank, location), and indications of
an unusual skill, competence or prestige in a special-
ized field (e.g., degrees. awards, professional associa-
tions, positions on committees, consultant status, the
subject of his written work and where it was published
or presented). Any connections with the government,
industrial defense contractors or defense research
centers (see sources I and 11 above for a list) indi-
cates the person deserves more investigation. Repeated

circulation from one organization to another, holding
more than one position simultaneously, shifting rank
or field sudden1y—these are all patterns of behavior
that suggest relationships of possible importance in
sharping decisions and controlling research.

Such information for faculty members of a univer-
sity or college is relatively easy to come by in bio-
graphical resources published by professional asso-
ciations or societies, the government or private
corporations (i.e., American Men of Scien.ce). The
university or research institution certainly maintains
such information, but it is not readily accessible
(except possibly to newspaper reporters). Hardly
any profession today is without a published directory
that contains some biographical information. A good
list of the primary sources can be found in Bernard
Klein (editor). Guide to American Directories (New
York. McGraw Hill. Sixth Edition, 1965) and more
secondary sources are listed in Biographical Informa-
tion: Where to Find It (Detroit, Gale Research Co.).
The Br‘ography Index (New York, H. W. Wilson Co.,
monthly and cumulative) might also prove helpful.

Sources listed under Section A above indicate how
to uncover works authored by a known individual
(abstracts, bibliographies, and indexes).

C. Searching Information on Research Facilities.
The environment in which a project is enmeshed can
be an indication of its ultimate utilization. Interlock-
ing relationships through financial and personnel
connections give some hint of the politicsbehind an
organization’s activities. Such information also brings
into play individual motivations and rewards which
can go a long way in puncturing liberal abstractions.

The best public source is usually descriptive and
promotional literature produced by the research insti-
tution. The Research Centers Directory (Detroit, Gale
Research Co., 2nd Edition, 1966) and its periodic
supplement, New Research Centers (Detroit, Gale Re-
search Co. Quarterly) gives basic information (i.e.,
location, activities, ﬁelds of interest, source of ftmds,
administrative personnel) on university-related_ and
independent non-profit research units. For data on
industrial non-profit and profit research units see
William W. Buchanan (Editor), Industrial Research
Laboratories of the United States (Washington, D.C.,
Bowker Associates, Inc., 1965), andnumerous direc-
tories of scientific resources in a geographical location
that are listed in Bernard Klein (Editor), Guide to
American I)ir'c('!(rr‘ie.s', cited above.

While many industrial research facilities are not
officially part of the university, many are located
near the campus and relate to faculty members
through employment, contracts or grants, and consult-
ing. A person in this position should be investigated
and if his work contributes to counter-revolutionary
efforts, vigorously challenged. The artificial division
between "on" and "off” campus work should not be
allowed to blur the substantive issues involved in
such research. ' '

Other directories of research centers that might be
helpful for just basic facts are: Office of Naval Re-
search, Department of the Navy, Directory of Depart-
ment of Defense In/'orrnatr'on Arzalyszls Centers (Wash-
ington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1965, $.15);
Department of State. External Research Staff, Research
Centers in Developing Areas (Washington, D.C., De-

17

partment of State, 1964) and Language and Area
Study Programs in American Urriuersities (Washing-
ton, D.C., Department of State, 1964).

As always, a search of the periodical literature and
the -local press should uncover articles on the research

facility.
FIELD WORK

N o matter how good or thoroughly serached. mate-
rial uncovered in printed sources should be supple-
mented by interviews, observations and inside infor-
mation. High and low level personnel connected with
the project or in thesame department or research
facility should be interviewed in private, on or off
the record. Space the interviews carefully, order the
questions beforehand, and use details collected from
printed sources to frame your inquiries. The order
can bring out contradictions while‘ concrete questions
inform the interviewee that you have a working
knowledge of the project and have entered his "reality.”
Ask the subject for copies of his printed work and if
he wants to keep things "off the record” assure him
that you will not attribute that information. You may
feel more conﬁdent. with two people asking the ques-
tions when the subject is an important ﬁgure. Most
of all, an interview is not a debate; if it unintention-
ally turns into an argument you can easily nullify
its information-gathering purpose and prematurely
close off some excellent sources.

It is essential to observe the research facility and
such events as department meetings, conferences, sem-
inars, training sessions, special courses or any other
gathering ‘connected to the project. Often these events
are attended by civilian or military representatives of
the government. Get to know "the other side of cam-
pus”——the institutes and laboratories-—in order to
familiarize yourself with their size, layout and opera-
tions. ‘

At times interviews and observation can not be
directly undertaken without creating a role that legi-
timatizes their necessity. Covers can be easily erected
by getting a friendly faculty ' member to authorize

the research through a course or enlisting the aid of

a campus newspaper reporter. In some situations
where security is tight inside informers will be the
only way to secure vital information. Personal contact
with friends or political associates who have positions
providing access to the information (i.'e., secretaries,
research assistants) can prove quite helpful. If neces-
sary someone may have to take a job on the project

‘or in the research facility to gain access to such

information. Persons in positions of public authority,
such as federal or state congressmen, senators, execu-
tive officials and their assistants, can easily acquire
restricted (but not necessarily classiﬁed) information
and forward it to you. Their desire to do so is usually
proportional to the effect it might have on their own
political well-being. Whatever the method, the problem
of getting inside information (no matter its classifica-
tion) essentially involves finding a person with legi-
timacy in the authority’s eyes who has access to the
material and can transmit the data either secretly or
without the threat of reprisal. Obviously such a per-
son should be handled with discretion and the smaller
the number of persons who know about it the better
your chances of success.

The university’s role in the strug-
gle against national liberation
forces is a product of this society’s
drive for ‘economic, social and
military domination of the Third

World. The academic community v

has been carefully enlisted in the
struggle and the number of points
where the university intersects with
the counter—revolutionary effort has
markedly increased over the last

twenty years. Govemment-sponsor-

ed research is simply one crucial _

point of intersection; recruitment,
training, industrial contracting,
interlocking directors, endowment
investment in foreign-oriented or
defense ﬁrms, foundation grants
and student exchanges are some
other vital university activities that
lend valuable assistance to private

and public attempts to penetrate

ADDENDA

and control other societies. In short,
the university’s role in building
and maintaining our overseas em-
pire takes several forms and-must
be opposed on many fronts. By
making public the real functions of
the university’s technological con-
tribution to that empire, we are
making a crucial beginning.

Since publication of this article, I have come across two more excellent
sources on government-sponsored research. Both should be added to the

section entitled "Searching Printed Sources Produced Off Campus," and in-
cluded in Table I. (--~M.L., 6/6/68.)

Interviews ‘

Interviews are generally a very good source of information. Two basic rules
should be followed in most cases:
1) Interviews should be conducted after doing initial research; i.e.,
when you know what questions to ask and to whom to ask than
2) The interviewer" should play a straight role, e.g.. as a student
doing research for a course paper.
If the interview is conducted in such a manner that the interviewee is not
threatened, he or she will usually be more than happy to talk.
