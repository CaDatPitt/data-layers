Price control should become a block-to-block business in
each community. ‘Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Smith also feel that
O.P.A. hasn't as yet done a real bang-up education job for the
public on the why, when, how and where of wartime living.

Our housewives have learned much about war eco-
nomics. Whenever a commodity becomes scarce, prices soar,
no matter whether it has a price ceiling or not. -‘

For example, when coffee was
scarce, you had to pay gold
for it even though grocers’
posted prices said 32 cents a
pound. When butter is scarce,
the grocer can get a pound
for you if you want to pay
more. And as far as meat is
concerned, as expensive as it
is, you can get as much as you
want as long as you have the do-re-me.

Mrs. Smith sees that the entire price structure is endangered
by the existence of shortages. She knows that certain foods are
going to be short. Everything produced on the home front
goes to the army ﬁrst.i'I‘hat is the way it should be. Luxury
goods will have to go, that goes without saying. But certain
foods are essential. Without meat her husband can't work at
the machine; without milk her children can't grow strong.
Food quotas are being increased and more is being produced
than ever before ‘but Uncle Sam has more mouths to feed at
home and abroad.

Americans expect to sacriﬁce but they don’t want to pay in
health and morale for the lack of a sound economic program
on the home front.

Standing on line, paying higher prices fora pound of coffee
is no pleasure for Mrs. Smith. She doesn't want to hoard. She

just wants to know that there will be enough for everyone
helping the war.

Our housewife has also found out that when commodities.
are scarce, they are shipped to parts of the city and country
where ceilings are highest. In fact a man-made shortage of
meat was created "early in the year of 1942 in this way. While
in certain parts of the country you can't get butter, milk,
canned goods because these very same commodities are being;
sold at higher prices elsewhere.

Rationing of sugar and coffee have taught Mrs. Smith that
rationing means protection and guarantee of supply. Prices
are stabilized and there is fair distribution for all. She stands
on an equal footing with Mrs. Rich of Park Avenue. V ’

Without rationing, she is victimized by “black markets.”
Prices of meat in New York City are soaring due to speculators’
activities. Retailers have to grease the hand of the speculators
to get any merchandise. The burden of the graft is then
passed on to the consumer. O.P.A. has begun to crack down,
but the black market still continues.

Price ceilings can't be enforced without rationing. Without
rationing everyday Americans cannot be sure of a just share.

For instance, the other day Mrs. Smith went into a dairy
store. She wanted a pound of tub butter at 53 cents a pound’
according to the posted prices. The grocer told her that there
was no 53-cent butter available but that he had some 64—cent

"We are for immediate rationing of all commodities faced by
shortages. It's the only fair way. We strongly oppose the practice
of notifying the public that particular commodities are to be re-
tioned at some future date. That practice encourages hoarding."-—
Mrs. Mary Rouse. president of the A. F. of L. Auxiliaries Council
of Greater New York.

i leave it; She had to take it;

butter. When she asked him“
why it was above the ceiling
price, he answered that he
could no longer obtain 53-
cent butter. He only had
64—cent butter, take it or

 

With rationing he would
have been unable to jack
up prices. _ ,
' Another thing housewives ’  I O N ' N G
wouldlike to ask the O.P.'A. \N7hy is it that every time a
“squeeze" has to be relieved from the wholesaler, jobber or
retailer, it is‘ promptly put on the consumer. All “squeeies"
are eased‘ at the consumer level, it seems. If justice were done
to the consumer, many prices would be rolled back instead
of advanced. ‘ A i “

Why does Mrs. Smith have to go through the degrading and
demoralizing business of waiting on line, paying extra prices
and doing without whenever new commodities arethreatened
by shortages? If coffee is rationed why aren’t tea and cocoa also
rationed? Unless similar or related commodities are rationed
together, a shortage of one creates a “run" on the related
commodities; This is what has happened with tea, cocoa
and postum. . ' ‘

Mrs. Smith is looking forward to getting War Ration Book
No. 2 which will be distributed early in 1943. The book is
based on a “point” system which distributes all related or
similar commodities at the same time. This is an improvement
over the first war ration book which was much too limited to
deal with wartime needs. ‘More than 30 billion stamps for
ration books are being printed. The sooner they get into the
consumer’s hands the better. ' W

ptain number of coupons with which to .buy a periodic supply the
 canned golods. These coupons may be used in any combina-K

tion of. goods the housewife wishes but once her coupon supply

is exhauisted she will have to wait for the_.next supply period.
In Brit-ain.,_ where there is over-all rationing and price en-
forcement, living costs have remained fairly stable during the

three years of war- Mrs. Roosevelt has reported to America
after her trip abroad that the diet of the average Briton

is “better balanced" now than ever before. This she attributes
to rationing. b ‘

tered at all. it was because the announcement was made .so far
in advance that it gave some selﬁsh people the opportunity

 

ivto hoard. Retailers, however, had been limiting 5;llCS of

canned goods for some time. They worked out their own
methods of voluntary rationing in order to protect limited
stocks. ‘ R '

While lauding the.Government’s action generally, it was

felt by many that piecemeal rationing would never do the.
trick. Butter and meat are still hard to get. Universal ration- :-

ing; of all essentials is imperative.  _ .
Mrs. Smith would like a little better planning on the part
of Governmental agencies. For instance, she re-zul .ll1:tl ration

R ibooks were‘held up for some time because the ().l’.A. could

not obtain enough paper for the job. Another senseless thing
she heard, that disturbs her, is that farmers are killing their
cows for livestock because they are getting higher prices for
them that way. This is cutting down on the production of
dairy products. There has to be enough meat but there surely
has to be enough butter, milk and cheese. The haphazard
way of leaving it to the individual producer to determine how
he should sell his products can create a serious shortage of
goods. The needs of the people should be considered ﬁrst. Better
planning would help tremendously.

Some people in this country are against rationing.

Who are they? The outright defeatists who want to see
Hitler victorious and the dollar-patriots who want to
make a proﬁt, come what may. Then there are the deluded
citizens who because of a minor inconvenience gripe’ enough
to make a fascist happy.‘ Vvhether they know it or not their
squawks about gasoline and oil rationing help the enemy.

But Mr. Smith's union, which understands the need for
rationing and price enforcement in the ﬁght for victory, has
sent resolutions, petitions, letters and telegrams to Secretary
of Agriculture Wickard, Economic Stabilization Director
Byrnes, War Production Board Director Nelson and the Office
of Price Administration.

Both C.I.O. and A. F. of L. have asked for universal ration-

"Food, shelter and clothing must be rationed on a universal basis
and their prices controlled so as to protect first those who actually
produce for war. Wages must be adiustecl so as to guarantee to
the workers that they will obtain the goods and services to meet
their essential needs."--Excerpt from Resolution on Total War
Mobilization passed by Fifth Convention of the Congress of indus-
trial Organizations.

ing. A. F. of L. and C.I.O. women’s auxiliaries have added.
their names to the long petition already signed by cooperative,
women's, consumer and church organizations. Not only does
the public want it but some retailers and wholesalers are
asking the Government to start its coupon rationing plan in
order to avoid chaos in domestic distribution.

Government oﬂicials admit that the public wants action.
But Government plans are tied up by a group of Congressional
reactionaries who must be made to conform to the needs of
the country. The “farm bloc" is steering the nation to eco-
nomic chaos and military disaster.

Mrs. Smith in her mothers’ group, defense council and club
and Mr. Smith in his union must force Congress to solve the
burning issues of price enforcement and rationing. The needs
of the people must be considered ﬁrst. Every delay, hesitancy
and indecision costs lives. , '

Mr. and Mrs. Smith both want a chance for greater partici-
pation on ration boards, consumer committees and defense
councils where day-to-day policies of price enforcement and
rationing are hammered out. M

The answer to anti-rationing and no-price-control is not
less but more rationing and more control.

America needs, and the President should establish by execu-
tive order, complete rationing of everything that is bought
and sold in the United States. ' ‘

Only universal and democratic rationing can assure ade-

.’ uate roduction of consumer oods to meet both m-ilitar
Fl P 8 Y

and civilian needs.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith are agreed on that.

The Daily Worker is the only labor daily newspaper of na-
tional circulation in the United States. During the nineteen
years of its existence it has taken a lead in championing vital
proposals which have become a recognized part of our na-
tional life and international policies. Among these were the

campaigns for the organization of workers into trade unions.

and the battle for unemployment insurance and social security
in the dark days of Herbert Hoover. Another has been the
campaign for collective security, to bring about that anti-Axis
unity of the free nations which has now become a reality in the
crucible of war.

The Daily Worker brings to its readers complete coverage
of the ﬁghting fronts where American forces and those of our
allies are ﬁghting the common enemy. Its inside accounts of
the powerful liberation movements in the Axis—occupied coun-
tries, its on-the-scene stories on the heroism of the Red Army
and the embattled Soviet people, have brought a clear and
quick light on the course of the war. ‘*

Today, the Daily Worker takes an outstanding position in
its championship of a centralized war economy—to achieve
maximum war production, democratic rationing and price con~
trol. Its thorough coverage of American labor activities has
made it indispensable to tens of thousands of A. F. of L. and
C.I.O. members. Every editorial, every feature article, every
news story in the Daily Worker and The Worker is directed
toward achieving victory over Hitlerism.

To keep abreast of world events, to make your own contri-
bution to the war effort more effective, requires that you be-
come a regular reader of the Daily Worker and The Worker

FOOD PRICES and RATIONING

By LOUISE MITCHELL
(Daily Worker Staff)

RS. JONES meets Mrs. Smith in the market and four

times out of ﬁve, they talk about high prices. They can’t

avoid it. They have the job of keeping their families ﬁt. But

the way things are with scarcities and high prices, their job of

winning the war on the kitchen from is becoming a
heartbreaking task.

Look at the price of butter—65 cents a pound, if you can get
it. In Detroit butter costs $1.25 a pound.

And a piece of steak (a man needs it when he's working
hard) can't ﬁnd its way to the dinner table until the butcher
gets more than a dollar for it. » ‘ ‘

A simple thing like snap beans costs 18 cents a pound.

Cheap but solid food like ﬁsh is almost twice as much as it
was last year.

You have to keep your ﬁngers crossed on every trip to the
grocers or butchers hoping that cereals, canned vegetables,

"Safeguarding our economy at home is the very least that our
soldiers. sailors and marine: have a right to expect of us civilians."
—PresideM Roosevelt.

‘ juices, butter and meat haven't gota new pair of price wings.
Now don’t get Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones wrong. They

want to win the war. They are good Americans.
They want their men in the army to get the best of every-

_thing., They want. their men at home to have -it under their

belts when they make the tanks, guns, planes that will bring
victory. And they also want their Allied friends to get food
to help break Hitler's yoke.

But they are asking:

Why are prices so ‘high?

Why are only some products rationed?

Last but not least, why can’t all Americans, together, settle
home front problems of food and wages and get on with
the war?‘

Now theirhusbands, Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones, are also ask-
ing some‘ of the same questions. If prices continue to rise,
how will they be able to pay the rent, food, utility and doc-
tors’ bills and still have a little change left for that Saturday
night movie for the family? i

Just like their wives, they are perplexed because wages have
been stabilized and prices are still going up. They know wages
can only be stretched so far. If this thing continues, it will be
hard to work with heart and brain.

When a pound of butter is almost equal to an hour’s wage

. or when a. pair of shoes cost a day’s labor and there are four

pairs of feet in a family, the cost of butter and shoes is no
longer just. the woman's job. It’s high time Mr. and Mrs. Smith

saw toit that their dollar was

worth a dollar or else there
won't be enough to go round.
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Smith

have always -left ‘statistics to _

the experts because they knew
from everyday experience
what the costmof living was.
They knew without charts
and graphs that since V the

. war began the cost of food

"went up 42 per cent. The
over-all cost of living soared
'22 per cent.

From their own accounts, «

they’ knew that food prices
jumped 32 per cent in 1941
and 12 per- cent in 1942.

. The reason that prices were

courts: or PRICE-S

MAY JUNE . WLY

increase in 1942 was because the Office of Price Adminis-

tration put price ceilings on all cost-of-living commodities,

food, clothing, rent, household articles, drugs and fuel. Only
’ ﬁsh and fresh vegetables and fruits are uncontrolled.

Now price ceilings are a wonderful idea. America's millions
of Mr. and Mrs. Smiths take their hats off to President Roose-
velt for pegging prices and rents. But housewives everywhere
point out that original price ceilings should have been pegged
at lower than March high levels. By the time March, 1942,
arrived all prices had grown dizzy in thevinﬂationary spiral.
And if housewives were asked (and why weren't they?) all foods

a should have {been controlled, at one time. _ .
Instead, Mrs. Jones had to pay exorbit-ant,pric_es for farm

 

 

products until they were controlled in October, almost seven

months after other foods were controlled. For seven months,

like a set of rotten teeth, un-
controlled prices continued to
ruin the whole system of price
regulations. It wasn't until
the President ordered Con-
gress to freeze farm prices that
an additional 30 per cent of
foodstuffs were put under con-
trol, bringing 90 per cent of all living necessities under ceilings.

From day to day experience, our housewives saw uncon-
trolled prices pushing up the cost of living and depressing
living standards. Only in pro-Administration papers they
read that a “farm bloc” in Congress was ﬁghting Government
efforts to ﬁx prices on farm products. There was a lot of talk
about parity and they agreed with the President that farmers
should get a fair return for their war contribution. And they
learned that there were large monopolistic farmers and small

 

‘farmers; the former greedy for proﬁts, the latter trying to hold

on to their farms by the sweat of their brows.

The “farm bloc" which is the political front for large
industrialized farmers and speculator-proﬁteers is ﬁghting in
the open and behind the scenes to smash price control and
rationing. The “farm bloc” knows that price enforcement and
rationing will bring Americans a fair and equal share of avail-
able stocks and enable them to give their all to the war. And
that is why it is shouting price control and rationing are
“socialistic." They want O.P.A. wiped out.

After cutting O.P.A. funds in the last Congress in such a way
as to make it almost impossible for O.P.A. to work effectively,
Congressional reactionaries started gunning for Leon Hender-
son, former Price Administrator.

Republican reactionaries and Southern tory Democrats are
determined to make a kill in proﬁts out of the war and only
the united efforts of the entire nation can stop them.

America Firsters have become the Proﬁteer Firsters as well.

Landlords backed by the National Association of Manufac-
turers and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce have wanted
to kill O.P.A. since its inception because it stabilized rents on
a nationwide scale. O.P.A.’s recent action against 60 landlords
violating rent ceilings showing that it meant businesslhas
further embittered real estate interests who froth over the idea
of Government controls.

The American people, who are behindthe President, and to
a man want a United Nations victory, want more price en-
forcement and ‘rationing and not less. If there has been any
criticism of O.P.A.’s administration by Mr. and Mrs. Smith,
war worker and housewife, it is because the Government
agency hasn't worked quickly and thoroughly enough.

Subjected to pressure of large producers, packers and dis-
tributors, O.P.A. has punctured price ceilings too many times.
Dozens of foods which were first controlled in April have had
their ceilings broken. In addition to outright price increases,
manufacturers have used devious methods to make extra
proﬁts in the form of hidden price increases.

Hidden price increases are thrown on Mrs. Smith in
this way.

She tries to buy a dollar slip, one which she has purchased
for years and ﬁnds that the manufacturer is giving her a

cheaper product." The wartime dvollar“ slip doesn’t last as long
or wear as well as the pre—war model.t'I_‘hen again, she goes
into a store and can't ﬁnd that dollar slip ‘any more. The line
has been discontinued. She is forced to buy a slip, which looks
and wears like the dollar one, but is marked $1.50.

Mrs. Jones realizes that
after several trips to the
grocer certain brands of foods
are missing from the shelves.
She can't get what she wants
unless she buys a more ex-
pensive brand.

So in addition to paying
. more ‘for everyday necessities
Mrs. Jones is getting less for her money. Rebranding of mer-
chandise is illegal according to O.P.A. but the housewife sees
it going on under her nose all the time.

Many housewives are beginning to realize that there are too
many brands for each article on the market. Standardization
of foodstulfs and elimination of useless variety would make
housekeeping simpler and end duplication and waste. Grade
labeling would help the homemaker in her purchases and
would really help enforce prices. Large canners are resisting
O.P.A. efforts to grade canned goods of the 1943 pack just as
packers resisted grading of meats. Once the consumer knows
what grade an article is and what its price should be, there is
little chance for the packers or canners to pull any funny stuff.

"is trying hard to make a liv-
‘ing, like every other everyday

\

Now another thing that annoys Mrs. Smith is that retailers
are not posting price ceilings as required by the General
Maximum" Price ‘Regulations. Without__posted prices, she is
unable to see whether the grocer or butcher is charging what
he should. Not that she has a gripe against the retailer. The
grocery store owner ‘on the
corner is usually a friend

as she has lived in the neigh-

ers comply with the law, there will be little enforcement of
prices. ‘ ,

Of 12.000 retail stores inspected by O.P.A., 40 per cent or”
4,800 were found to be violating some price control regulation.

Mrs. Smith knows that O.P.A. hasn't enough inspectors to
look after lhr.‘ 40 per cent of the violators. She has therefore
asked the price agency to train her to be a price warden. But
nothing has been done about it. ' ' '

There are f2,'2,ooo,ooo housewives in the country today, every

oneieager to keep living costs reasonable. Without them,”

O.P.A. can never "succeed in its gigantic job of keeping retailers
and wholesalers in line. If it were up to ‘Congress, O.P.A.
would have even less investigators. Mrs. Jones honestly be-

t lieves that the price agency should make everyehousewife a
«price warden. i ~
