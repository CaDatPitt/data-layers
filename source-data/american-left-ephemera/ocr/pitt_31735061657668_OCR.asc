of private ‘business and hope the procedure will be bloodless; any or
all of those who do not believe in constitutional government-—should
be permitted to carry on their program in secrecy.”

That was quiteslxciﬁcz left-wingers, parlor pinks and New Dealers.

On March 30, 1945, it was announced that the committee would
solicit the opinions of 100 leading citizens on un-Americanism. Com-
mitteernan Karl E. Mundt of North Dakota said he had been disturbed
by “the absence of a suitable and working criterion to determine what
does and what does not constitute un-American activity.”

The committee did not even study the many conﬂicting deﬁnitions
from the 100 prominent citizens, but turned them over to the Brook-
ings Institution with a request for a memorandum that might be used
as a guide for the committee. In April the Institute gave the committee
a 14-page document entitled "Suggested Standards for Determining
Un-American Activities,” but these have never been adopted by the
committee; if anything, they proved only that the term is indeﬁnable.

On June 23 Chairman Hart released what was described as the

committee's deﬁnition of un-Americanism. But the next day, Congress-
man Rankin repudiated it. Hart resigned a few days after that.

Nearly a year later Mundt was still talking in vague generalities

in the House: “Our task,” he said,  . . is to seek out and expose
those activities which alt/song/9 legal are nonetheless un-American.”
, In July, 1946, Representative Clyde Doyle of California wrote to
Ernie Adamson, chief counsel for the committee, asking for “a copy
of the deﬁnition of ‘subversive activities’ or ‘un-American activities’
as wasadopted . . , which guides youlin your deliberations.” ,

Adamson replied: "T/9e committee has adopted n-o deﬁnition of
subversive 01' nn-American activities.”

For tenyears the committee has been in business as “the watchdog
of American institutions,” as Rankin puts it, but it cannot deﬁne for
the American people "what it is watchdogging against.

In its report dated July, 1946, the committee says it "has endeavored I

to determine whether the persons under the investigation have the
interest of the United States Government at heart”; that is as close
as it can come to describing the criterion by which it worked.

But its activities demonstrate pretty thoroughly what it considers
American and what un-American, as will be shown.

“Loud Mouth Trouble Makers. . . . ” '

On July 9, 1945, Congressman Rankin said: “For the last ‘few
days the smear bund, including Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson
and that element of the press that plays up Communist ideals, have
been misrepresenting the Committee on Un-American, Activities
over the radio and in the press.”

One of the most un-American of all un-American activities is
criticism of Rankin or his committee. The committee's official report

for June 7, 1946, says: “Many individual Members, and Congress as .

a whole, are slandered, maligned, and ridiculed by certain (radio)
commentators in what appears to be a well-organized campaign to
break the conﬁdence of the American people in our elective system and
representative form of government. Some of these loud-mouthed
trouble makers can hardly speak English.”

Since its inception the Dies Committee had persistently attacked
the freedom of the air. In October, 1945, Rankin’s new raid on radio

began. Ernié Adamson requested and received from broadcasting com-

panies some seventy-ﬁve scripts of radio commentators, including Ray-

mond Swing, Cecil Brown, Johannes Steel, Frank Kingdon, Hans

Jacob, William Gailmor, J. Raymond Walsh and Sidney Walton
The first result of this request was the immediate dismissal of two

7

 

 

of the Commentators. One of these was Hans Jacob of WOV, New
York. Jacob, an anti-fascist refugee, said he was seeing re-enacted here
what he had already seen done in Germany.

Committeeman John R. Murdock of Arizona criticized the com-
mittee’s action, and called it "judgment by suspicion,” but his words
had no effect. Representative Ellis Patterson of California declared that
“the activities of this Comittee on Un-American Activities are in them-

I selves un-American,” and Representative Hugh DeLacey of Washington

described the committee as a "Congressional -thought police.” He
pointed out that “the commentators whose scripts are sent for are plainly
warned that they are under Government surveillance, that their thoughts

are under House attest, that in the future they must carefully lean toward

the thoughts of those controlling the Un-American Activities Commit-
tee. The radio stations and sponsors of programs, who are in‘ business

to make money, are thus put on warning that if they wish to stay

out of the center of the smear controversy, they had better get other
commentators.”

Johannes Steel, who was forced from the air, warned that “liberal
commentators like myself are being subponeaed in a pressure campaign
which is designed to intimidate radio stations and get us off the air.”

On October 19, 1945, The N ew York Times quoted committee chair-
man John S. Wood of Georgia as denying that an inquiry. of radio
scripts was”being made,‘ and that Adamson’s request for scripts was
unofficial. All doubt was removed the next day when Adamson sent
the following letter to all broadcasting companies: , -

"T his Committee receives many critical letters concerning certain
so-called news commentators who engage in expressions of opinion
and personal prejudice to such an extent as to overshadow the news
and emphasize the element of propaganda.

“Hostile public opinion seems to be growing and I am convinced ,
that some measures must be taken by the stations or by Congress to

clearly separate political propaganda programs from real news broad-
casts. A

"I would appreciate an expression of opinion from you as to What
should be done and what can be done. .

“I hope that stations will make ‘it unnecessary for the committee
to recommend the passage of remedial laws. The stations and com-
mentators should give this question careful consideration.”

When a participant on Phil Baker’s Take It Or Leave It program
was asked what sort of unity would be good for the American people,
he replied in favor of unity regardless of race, creed and color for
a common goal of peace and prosperity. That script was promptly de-
manded for review. -

On October 24 Rankin said: “The air is not free for everybody to
smear, malign, slander and libel people all over the country.” That was

if a right the Congressman reserved to himself.

. committee? Its 1946 report says:

In December the committee introduced a bill which would ‘.‘by proper
and frequent announcements clearly separate and distinguish programs
consisting of news items from those programs based upon, or con-
sisting of, personal opinion or propaganda.”

On February 2, 1946, Rankin said: “I want to tell you now, some of
this stuﬂ‘ that is going over the air should be stopped. Of all the dirt
and ﬁlth I ever heard, those ﬁlthy attackson me and the Committee
on Un-American Activities by Walter Winchell are the worst.”

And most of it stopped. Today there is scarcely a liberal voice on the
air-waves, and there are few who dare utter into a microphone a word
of criticism of Rankin and ‘his committee. When Don Goddardtried
it on September 15, 1946, by referring to the Congressman as the
“rank Rankin,” he was promptly ﬁred by the National Broaodcasting
Company. Fear today rules the air waves in free America. _

The speciﬁc charges against the commentators silenced by the
“ . it appears that several of the
so-called ‘liberal’ commentators are all receiving information from the
the same source, inasmuch as practically all of them night after night
discuss the same subjects and with very little difference in their in-

' terpretative language.” This somehow made them all guilty in the eyes

of the committee.

The report specifies that the committee will not tolerate: remarks
favorable to the Soviet Union; criticism of the State Department;
criticism of "anti-Russian and anti-Communistic” newspapers; criticism
of Franco; criticism of the Peron dicctatorship in Argentina; criticism
of General MacArthur; criticism of Chiang Kai Shek. Particularly ob-
noxious to the committee was the fact that some of the commentators

'1/"openly call for the dissolution of the British Empire.”

The report warns that other commentators “are under scrutiny.”
It says that “some of these . . . are broadcasting in the Middle West,

9

A ’. ..'... ... '.§...._[ £s;{{y.~.ua

 

and some on the Paciﬁc Coast. It can therefore be seen that radio
propaganda is being beamed over the air waves in every section of
the United States". ‘

The committee intends that Americans shall hear only what it wants
them to hear. V

Following its successes in radio, the committee made an excursion
into the freedom of the press. In March, 1946, when an organization
called Citizens United to Abolish the W/ood-Rankin Committee placed
an advertisement in Tlae New York Time: expressing the opinion that
the committee should be abolished, representatives of both the agency
which placed the advertisement and the Time: advertising department
were subpoenaed by the committee with the usual attendant publicity.

The incident brought a sharp rebuke from Editor and Publisher,
inﬂuencial trade journal, which declared editorially in its issue for
April 13, “Investigation by this committee of opinion expressed in
paid advertising copy, particularly the subpoena of the agency and the
newspaper, amounts to intimidation. It is an attempt to control thought.
If, through such methods, a branch of Congress can label such opinion
‘good’ or ‘bad’, ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, it need not go much further to do the
same with the now free editorial expressions in our newspapers .
If the committee persists in this practice we believe Congress should
investigate the investigators to uncover their motives.” .
T» On January 2, 1947, in one of its extremely rare instances of pro-
posing legislation, the committee recommended forbidding second-

class mailing privileges to newspapers printed in any language other

than Eng1ish°which failed to carry a full English translation in parallel
columns next to the foreign language context. By the simple expedient
of imposing this intolerable economic burden on foreign-language
newspaper publishers, the committee would wipe out of existence
virtually every such newspaper in the United States.

The committee drove most liberal commentators from the air. As
long as it exists, there is no guarantee that‘ it will not seek to muzzle
the liberal sections of the press of this country.

Kil Klux Klan is “American.”

"After all, the Klan ii an American inxtitntion, it:

member: are American. Oar job is to investigate

foreign ’i:mr and alien organization:/’
——COMMITTEEMAN JOHN RANKIN
quoted by Drew Pearson, June 11, 1946

"The tbreatr and intimidation: of the Kit Klux Klan
are an old American cii.rtom——jnrt like illegal wloiréey

making.”
--COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JOHN S. WOOD
quoted in In Fact, June 17, 1946

In 1942 the Ku Klux Klan’s Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott
arranged a private interview with Martin Dies. After the meeting
Colescott urged Klansmen everywhere to support “the work of the
Dies Committee,” and in his publication, the Fiery Cross, for January,
1942, he lauded the committee as having “reridered a great service
to our country.” That fraternal relationship between the Klan and the
committee has been maintained ever since.

In the latter part of 1945 and through most of -1946 there were
increasing signs of "a revival of activity on the part of the Klan in vari-

‘ A 1 1

 

ous parts of the country, and there were a considerable number of de-
mands upon the committee for an investigation, including several
made by members of Congress upon the ﬂoor of the House.

Chairman Wood, who comes from Canton, Georgia, on July 15,
1945, replied to these demands by saying that “we don’t have any of
those subversive elements down in my country.”

On January 12, 1946, Ernie Adamson after a visit to his home state
of Georgia, issued a statement in which he said the committee had
been unable to find any evidence of: Klan activity more recent than

V seven or eight years ago. But the signs of a Klan revival could not

be entirely ignored. On May 27, 1946, The New York Times reported
that committee aides were to go to Atlanta to investigate. The next
day Rankin denied that an investigation was contemplated.

And days later the committee formally voted ﬁve to one against

a probe of the Klan, prompting Representative Donald L. O'Toole ‘

of New York later to rise on the ﬂoor of the House and declare angrily
that the committee “has been made aware of this momentous danger and
has chosen not to take cognizance of it.” He added, “I cannot respect
the actions or even the sincerity of some of the committee members,”
but Rankin found this remark offensive and caused it to be stricken
from the Congressional Record.

The day after the committee voted not to investigate the Klan,
Governor Ellis Arnall of Georgia ordered his state legal department
to start action for revoking the charter of the KKK; he had been
informed by the FBI of a Klan plot on his life.

The Assistant State Attorney General of Georgia, Dan Duke, revealed
that thirty-eight Atlanta policemen had recently attended a Klan meet-
ing in uniform, and that one of them had said: “If there ever is any
trouble, the Klan will be permitted to do its work before the police are
called out.”

The State of Georgia eventually went to court for a revocation of the
Klan charter on the grounds that it was conspiring’ to seize control of
government agencies entrusted with the ‘protection of public security

1 and that it was guilty of “violence, terrorism and hate.”

Then on July 29, 1946, in New York City, Supreme Court Justice
Joseph A. Gavagan signed an order revoking the Klan charter in New
York State and making membership in it illegal.

A few days later further evidences of increased Klan activity led
the FBI to open a probe of the organization in seven states.

The next month in Georgia,’ Duke presented documentary evidence
showing an organizational alliance between the Klan and the German-
American Bund. This link was known to the Dies Committee and its
successor, but neither did anything about it.

On October 10, 1946, the New Jersey Supreme Court outlawed
the Klan in that state, holding that its objectives were improper and
that it had direct connections with the German-American Bund.

But to the Dies-Wood-Rankin-Thomas Committee, the KKK was

just good, old-fashioned Americanism.

 

More Samples of “Americanism.”

The Ku Klux Klan is only one of many organizations specializing
in discord, hatred and racial bigotry to hail the House Committee
on Un-American Activities as being “of great service” to the country.
Almost all of the professional dealers in prejudice look upon John
Rankin as their spokesman in the government, and see the committee

he dominates as a governmental agency promoting their own aims.
A few of the most random examples will be enough to show this.

Gerald W. Winrod, indicted for sedition during the war, is publisher
of The Defender which in 1933 greeted Hitler's rise to power. In July,
1946, The Defender listed as “Names To Be Remembered” the eighty-
one members of the House who voted against an appropriation for
the Un-American Committee and‘ described them as “an assortment
of Pinks, radicals, left-wingers, fel1ow—travelers, New Dealers and
Communists.” In its September, 1946, issue the paper featured as its
main article "A Report To The Nation” which was signed “by the
Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities.” If the com-
mittee did not authorize this use of its name, it never disavowed it.

A foreword to the article said: “There is no way of estimating
the value of the Phblic service being these days rendered by the Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities of the United States Congress.”

Court Asher, also indicted for sedition, publishes a paper called
Ex-Ray which has consistently praised Rankin‘ and the committee.
During the war the paper urged the impeachment of President
Roosevelt. An idea of the nature of the publication can be gained from
this headline in the June, 1946, issue: “COMMUNISTS IN OUR OWN
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE HANGED,,SAYS THE EX-RAY, AND SUBVER-
SIVE RED-ORGANIZED JEWRY WITH THEM." The same issue contained
an article lauding the committee. A

C. Leon de Aryan, who was dishonorably discharged from the army
in World War I and found himself under two indictments for sedition
during World War II, publishes The Broom which in its June 10,
1946, issue urged Republicans to follow the example of the Daughters
of the American Revolution which "had the bravery to commend the
Committee on Un-American Activities.”

Eugene R. Flitcraft publishes the Gentile News. Its June, 1946,
issue contained a petition addressed to Congressmen urging “whole-

’ hearted support to the Committee on Un-American Activities under
its present leadership.” -

Until it was suppressed, the Nazi Der Deutscher Weckmf Und
Beobachter was an admirer of Rankin. On June 12, 1941, the paper
said editorially that “it is signiﬁcant that the race question is penetrat-
ing into the House” and quoted approvingly one of Rankin’s anti-
Semitic utterances.

14

o

 

 

Father Charles E. Coughlin’s paper, Social Justice, also praised
Rankin before it was suppressed during the war. Its issue for May
12, 1941, quoted the same speech which had won the admiration of the

Nazi paper, and said: "Naturally we quite agree with Mr. Rankin’s v

observations . . .
William Dudley Pelley, sentenced to 15 years for criminal sedition,
also supported the committee in his publication, New Liberator, and
just before he was locked up quoted approvingly a Rankin attack on
the National Labor Relations Board. V

On March 29, 1943, Rankin openly defended one of the men
indicted for sedition, and said: "Ask yourself if the White Gentiles
of this country have no’ rights left that the Department of Justice is
bound to respect.”

During the war the Army provided an elementary understanding
of the fundamental issues involved in the conﬂict. When the Hearst
newspapers discovered Army Orientation Fact Sheet 64, which told
GIs how to identify native fascists, they called it “Red poison.” Eliza-
beth Dilling, indicted for sedition, described it as “traitorous.”

Applying the Hearstian epithet, the committee’s oﬂicial report for
July 7, 1946, said that "this so-called indoctrination course was, and
will remain one of the dirtiest blots on the history of the War Depart-
ment." Because the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties
reprinted the fact sheet for civilian distribution, that organization
was denounced as a “thought control society.”

A kinship of another kind has emerged on occasion. Every pro-
fascist organization in the United States, from the Klan to the Christian
Mobilizers, from the Bund to the Silver Shirts, operates under the
slogan that America is not a democracy, but a republic. The distinc-
tion between these terms identiﬁes all such organizations. The chief
counsel for the Un-American Committee has often made the same
distinction. ‘

On February 11, 1946, Ernie Adamson wrote a letter to Drew

" Pearson rebuking him for using the phrase "make democracy work."

On January 29, 1946, in a letter to an organization called Veterans
Against Discrimination, Adamson noted that literature of the group
"refer to democracy several times. I wonder if you are sufficiently
familiar with the history of the United States to be aware that this
country was not organized as a democracy.” He then wanted to know

whether the veteran group proposed “to conduct a propaganda cam-
paign against the administration of the provision of the Constitution
(Art. IV, sec. 4)?”

And in the committee's official report dated January 2, 1947, this
statement occurs: “Real democracy . . . has never worked as a national
form of government. We have in this country a republic . . . What
more can we ask?” ,

The Committee’s ofﬁcial report for May 10, 1946, criticizes the
Department of Justice for bringing the seditionists to trial. The Depart-
ment, it said, found "time to prosecute some thirty or forty mu’/ue
Ameriamr who were charged with sedition, and a trial covering
eight months and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars was con-
ducted to convict these persons.” Perhaps the fact that the cases
against these indicted persons were dropped is a measure of the power
of the committee in protecting its strongest supporters. The committee
had shielded many of those later indicted for sedition, either by

J failing to investigate despite information in its possession or by offering

them a friendly committee hearing platform. Martin Dies, in fact,
appeared at public meetings with a number of those later indicted
for sedition.

It was this relationship which prompted Representative Adolph
J. Sabath of Illinois, chairman of the House Rules Committee, to
challenge the committee on its attitude toward "outstanding pub-
licists, propagandists and rabble rousers such as former Senator Robert
Reynolds, Gerald L. K. Smith, Joe McWilliams, Pelley and others
who have been cooperating with them, many of whom have been
indicted, some convicted, and others who should have been prose-
cuted for un-American, subversive and seditious activities.”

Rankin and the committee have never answered that ohallenge.

V 7_,__ _ _,_,_,,__..   .

 

Shortly after John Rankin launched his investigation of Hollywood
in the middle of 1945, Gerald L. K. Smith issued a special bulletin
to his followers, dated ]uly 3, 1945, in which he said: “You have,
of course, seen the newspaper accounts of the plan to investigate
the traitors of Hollywood who are attempting to use the great ﬁlm
industry to undermine our American government. Be sure to write
a letter to Congressman john E. Rankin, House Office Building,
Washington, D. C., congratulating him and his committee on this
planned investigation. He Will be interested in hearing about our
big meetings and crusading ﬁght here in California in defense of
Christian Americanism. Mr. Rankin is a great Christian and a great
American.” ‘ ’

The Rankin investigation actually was the realization of one of

Smith’s favorite projects; later Smith was to claim full credit for

the probe, without disavowal by Rankin or the committee.
The 1945 investigation produced a quantity of newspaper head-
lines, but very little in the way of evidence. The probe was not even

mentioned in any of the official reports of the committee. But it?

provided Rankin with a forum for such statements as this: "Hollywood
is a hotbed of subversive activities. Hollywood is the red
citadel. . . . One of the most dangerous plots ever instigated for
the overthrow of this government has its headquarters in Hollywood.
. . . They have Communist schools for the purpose of indoctrinating
or teaching the script writers to write those insidious subversive lines
into the picture shows.” /

The Louisville Courier-Journal was moved to complain editorially:
"Everything that the judicious citizen feared when John Rankin shoved

through the House a permanent successor to the smear-and-run Dies a

committee seems about to come to pass. . . . For one thing, we ‘are
informed that we may look for a sally of inquisition into Hollywood,
in search of a deep red plot to overthrow our liberties by a subtle
manipulation of our entertainment, and we cannot help recalling that
Mr. Dies, in his hey—day, also prowled into that tinsel preserve,
coming up with little more than the scalp of Shirley Temple, then
aged 10.” '
Actually, the Hollywood expedition was planned as an effort to
discredit the Roosevelt administration. On February 22, 1943, the
President had written to Walter Wanger, head of the Academy of

18

 

 

Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: “It is a matter of deep satisfaction

to me, as it must be to you, that we have succeeded, in turning
the tremendous power of the motion picture industry into an effective
war instrument without the slightest resort to the totalitarian methods

’ of our enemies.”

The ﬁrst reports of the 1945 investigation “leaked” out -to the Hearst
press in September, 1945, before even_ Chairman Wood received
them. ’

In November Congressman Ellis Patterson of California asked the
committee for information on the results of the investigation, but was
refused it. That same month Gerald Smith's paper published a detailed
report entitled "Hollywood Exposed," covering thirteen points of the
investigation. Patterson was prompted to remark on the House"‘ﬂoor
that "it appears that in place of the committee clearing through
Congress, it is clearing through Gerald.”

The Committee's 1945 expedition to Hollywood was clearly Gerald
L. K. Smith's show. .

Following that probe, Representative Dickstein of New York, chair-
man of the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,
went to Hollywood with several aides for a ten-day check on the
Rankin results. He found that aliens constituted one-half of one
per cent of the personnel employed by movie studios, and that alien
actors constituted one and one-half per cent of their group. “The
charge that Hollywood is under subversive a1ien_inﬂuence,” said Dick-
stein, "is propaganda spread by Mr. Rankin’s so-called Un-American
Affairs Committee and other hate-mongers."

The most recent expedition to the ﬁlm capital has been a repeti-
tion of what has gone before, Most of the committee's witnesses
were connected with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation
of American Ideals, an organization founded during World War II
to campaign against what its leaders considered “Communism” and
against trade union organization in the ﬁlm industry.

It soon became apparent that Chairman Thomas’, aim was to dis-
credit the late President Roosevelt and his administration with the
charge that it had given “aid and comfort to the Communists” in the

1 industry by compelling patriotic actors to play in “pro-Red” ﬁlms.

Robert Taylor, president of the MPA, testiﬁed that his commission
in the Navy had been held up in Washington while Lowell Mellett,

i9

 

 

 

 

then administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, was sent to the
Coast to force him to play the lead in Song of Russia against his
 0 .

Mellett, now a Washington columnist, branded the charge as “too
silly to deny” and protested it as a “smear-and-run” tactic.

The anti-Roosevelt angle of the investigation was developed further
with the charge that Joseph E. Davies, former ambassador to the
Soviet Union, had acted on behalf of the late President to “force”
Warner Brothers to produce Mission to Moscow in 1942. The Thomas
Committee described Davies‘ as the liaison man between Roosevelt and
Hollywood. Mr. Davies on June 14, 1947, denied this charge and
declared that “it defames the dead to assert that a President of our
courgry would seek to coerce any citizen or citizens into action which
would be contrary to their free choice and in violation of 0 their
constitutional rights.” He said that several companies had sought
the movie rights to his book.

The reaction of the majority of Hollywood artists and workers
to the investigation was expressed by Katharine Hepburn, who spoke
at a meeting of 27,000 persons at a Henry Wallace rally in Los
Angeles. "We, the writers, the actors, the scientists, the educators,
have been chosen as a primary target by the Rankins,” she said.
"Silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice of the
people.” i ’

Bosley Crowther, ﬁlm critic of The’ New York _Tz'mer, has also
warned of the dangers to democracy in the Thomas investigation.
He wrote in the Time: for Sunday, June 8, 1947, that “by giving
particular circulation to innuendos that the industry——or certain pro-
ducers in it—had made un-American ﬁlms, the committee cut loose
covertly at the inalienable freedom of speech. It introduced the shadow
of political censorship, which the men of the industry should chal-
lenge at the drop of the ﬁrst hint. . . . For, by casting suspicion
recklessly, it (the committee) is taking a course. that can discourage
the production of even mildly liberal ﬁlms.”

Gerald L. K. Smith: Friend and Guide.

"I f that committee act: true to form, it'll probably
take up a collection» for Mm.”
-—W7ALTER WINCHELL

January 17, 1946, on the appearance of Gerald L.
K. Smith before the Thomas-Rankin Committee

Following the 1945 excursion to Hollywood there was considerable
criticism of the committee’s relations with Gerald L. K. Smith. A
group of ﬁve Congressmen termed him “America's most raucous pur-
veyer of anti-Semitism and of racial and religious bigotry.” Demands
for an investigation of Smith became numerous enough to be em-
barrassing to the committee, and on January 11, 1946, Ernie Adamson
announced that he would be called for questioning. Adamson empha-
sized, however, that there were no charges against Smith; the com-
mittee was simply seeking information. _

On the witness stand Smith explained his appearance this way:
"Some time ago I petitioned the committee—or rather suggested to
the committee——I did not petition, I suggested to the committee
that there was no question or accusation that these men (his critics)

Smith wasnot investigated. Actually he asked for, and was granted,
the right to use the committee as a forum for his propaganda.
The De: Maine: Register, quoted in the Congressional Record for
February 12, 1946, commented: “They did not really question him
(but) they gave him a national pulpit for his anti-Semitic and fascist
ravings."

The committee treated Smith with great solicitude. Most of the
progressive citizens now charged with “contempt of Congress” either
were denied the right to make a statement, or were heckled while
making one, Smith was not denied the right to make a statement:

Mr. Rankin: Mr. Smith, you spoke a while ago of having
a statement you would like to make. I would rather hear
your statement before I cross-examine you. W *

Mr. Adamson: Very well, Mr. Chairman. He has the
statement here. Do you want himto read it or just insert
it.

“ Mr. Rankin: I would like for him to read it. I would

like to hear it.

Because of pressure of time Smith's statement at that point was
not read, but inserted in the record. Later this exchange took place:

Mr. Thomas: Do you believe that you have_ been anti-
Semitic?

Mr. Smith: I insist on answering that with my statement.

Chairman: Your statement, Mr. Smith, is in the

-record. . . . -

Mr. Rankin: Mr. Chairman, if this man wants to read
his statement or make a statement to the committee under
these charges, I think he should be permitted to do so.

And Smith read his statement.

Contrast Rankin’s attitude toward» Smith with his behavior toward
another witness, Dr. Harlow Shapley, internationally famed astronomer
and director of the Harvard Observatory. When Shapley was sub-
poenaed to appear before the committee, his attorney sought to
accompany him into the hearing room. Rankin exclaimed: “I make
the rules for this committee. Call the captain of the guards!”

Or contrast the treatment of Smith with that accorded Professor
Lyman Bradley of New York University, who had been subpoenaed

in connection with the committee’s “investigation” of the Joint Anti-H

" he wanted investigated. Thefollowing is typical;

Fascist Refugee Committee. This is an excerpt from the transcript:

Professor Bradley: Allow me to ﬁnish reading the
statement.

Mr. Adamson: It is the same one the previous witness
had.

Mr. Rankin: Give it to the chairman. The next question
he refuses, just call up the marshal and send him to jail.

In answer to the question by Thomas, "Would you say that the
German-American Bund was a fascist organization?”, Smith was
allowed to reply:  . . The only effective fascism that has really
imperiled our people in their daily life in this country has been
the administration of the New Deal bureaucracy.” .

Under Thomas’ prodding, Smith expanded on this: “I would say
that they (New Deal bureaucrats) employ the ideology of the com-
munists and the technique of the fascists. I think that Mr. Roosevelt
was. very much an imitator of Mr. Hitler.”

With helpful questions from committee members, particularly
Thomas, Smith listed a number of organizations and individuals

.Mr. Thomas: You wouldn't say Frank Sinatra was a Com-' _
munist, would you? I I I _V
Mr. Smith: He may not be that intelligently. . ’. . -
Mr. Thomas: Would you say he was a sort of a Mrs.

Roosevelt in pants? '

When the hearing concluded, the chairman said graciously: "The
chair expresses the appreciation of the committee for your testimony,
Mr. Smith." .

Later, when committee members were asked what they were intend-
ing to do about Smith’s activities, they squirmed. Chairman Wood
was quoted in PM on February. 14, 1946: “We’ve got only two
investigators. We just haven't had time to look into Smith’s records yet.”

Committeeman Gerald W. Landis of Indiana, when asked by Vir-

ginia Gardner of New M45565, "Do you consider Smith a fascist?”

replied: “I haven't gone deep-enough yet to reach a conclusion—
I don’t intend to express my opinion until I have completed my
investigation.” Said Landis: “Smith named Eddie Cantor, Ingrid Berg-
man, Orson Welles and Frank Sinatra as Communists. . . . Of course,

. we’vé got an investigator our now on Smith’s charges.”

The President's Loyalty Order.

Since its inception the committee has persistently attacked the
government itself in an effort to remove from public life both
elected and appointed officials with whom the committee and its
members are in disagreement.

One of the ﬁrst acts of the Dies Committee was to hold a hearing
in the State of Michigan in the course of which Supreme Court
Justice Frank Murphy, then seeking re-election as governor, was
denounced for having a “treasonable attitude” because he had refused
to send troops against the sit-down strikers in the auto industry.
President Roosevelt described the hearing as “a ﬂagrantly unfair and
un-American attempt to inﬂuence an election.” Murphy was defeated.

During its existence the committee has demanded the resignations
of Cabinet members Frances Perkins, Harold Ickes, and Secretary
of War Stimson. It has called Attorney General Francis Biddle “in-
competent" and Attorney General Jackson “unqualified.” It has called
Thurman Arnold and Henry Wallafe “crackpots.” It has accused
Harry Hopkins and Eleanor Roosevelt of. “harboring Communists.”
And it has said that Paul Porter earned ‘too high a salary to be
considered “American." '

In February, 1943, the Dies Committee sought to remove 38

24

 

employes from the federal payroll. Dies described the 38 as Com-
munists, but Representative Hoffman of Michigan was more reveal-
ing. “The issue," he said, "is not whether the individuals named by
the Dies Committee are Communists or something else. . . . The
issue . . . is do people want on the payroll those New Dealers,
those dreamers. . .  (Congressional Record, Feb. 8, 1943.) Dies
was forced to admit that he couldn’t prove those named were dreamers,
but he said they were all “crackpots" anyway. When one of them
sued, Dies was forced to apologize and to bear the costs of the
suit——a bill which he passed on to the House for payment.

In the early days of the war Dies attacked the Board of Economic
Warfare headed by then Vice President Wallace with the usual
unsupported charge that it “harbored Communists.” In an open letter
to Wallace—which Wallace did not see until it was published in
the press——Dies named 11 members of the board as Communists

and threatened to "expose” a total of 35. After the publication of,

his open letter, Dies said: "I believe that the American people will
now welcome numerous resignations or dismissals from the staff
of the Board of Economic Warfare." But Wallace retorted that Dies
sought "to inﬂame the public mind by" malicious distortion” and
added that "the effect on the morale of the country would be less
damaging if Mr. Dies were on the Hitler payroll." (Congressional
Record, March 30, 1942.)

On May 26, 1944, Committeeman Rankin said of the Fair Employ-
ment Practices Committee: "This is the beginning of a Communistic
dictatorship the like of which America never dreamed.”

In 1945, after the committee had been made permanent, these
attacks increased in number and intensity. One of the first targets
of the new committee was the Oﬁﬁce of Price Administration; the
attack was made when the price control bill was up for consideration
in Congress. The Department of Agriculture was accused of broad-
casting “pro-Russian propaganda.”

' For several months in the early part of 1945 Committeeman Rankin
kept up a running campaign against the War Department policy
of permitting Communists to hold commissions in the armed services,
and in July he demanded the resignation of Secretary of War Stimson
and two of his aides.

In June Committeeman Thomas demanded an investigation of

ST R I K E BA 0 K
by HENRY A. WALLACE

Unless they are stopped, the present methods of ﬁghting commu-
nism and socialism by whipping up hysteria and invoking systems of
thought control will give us a police state here. We cannot preserve
and improve our system of -democratic capitalism by undermining our
high standard for human rights and civil liberties.

We have -believed throughout our history in leaving the greatest
power possible to the individual and to local governments. But the
amendments to the Constitution—the Bill of Rights and the Thir-
teenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments—and the legislative
acts which were designed to protect human rights, have largely fallen
into disuse so far as the individual is concerned and have been used
more and more by great corporations as a device to escape government
regulation. The sad result is that the U. S. is becoming more and more-
a government of, by and for these great corporations. Human rights
are more in peril in the United States today than at any time since the
Civil War.

The one hope for justice—belated and costly justice—remains in
the Supreme Court, which last year made a gloriously unanimous deci-
sion in the Lovett case, saying:

"When the Constitution and Bill of Rights were written, our ances-
tors had ample reason to know that legislative trials and punishments
were too dangerous to liberty to exist in the nation of free men they
envisioned. And so they proscribed bills of attainder.”

Here we have a terriﬁc indictment of the Thomas Un-American
Activities Committee. This committee, which has used many un-
American witnesses in its fear-breeding campaign, has succeeded in
getting ﬁne citizens sentenced to jail on the technical grounds that they
failed to reveal certain records.

 

 

 

 

UNRRA, calling it the “focal point for the Communist Party of the
United States.” I - '

On June 11 Rankin made clear the ultimate purpose of these
persistent attacks on government agencies: on that date he demanded
that President Truman “clean out, the Reds” in the government.

On September 27, 1945, the committee introduced a resolution
to force the President to turn over to it the personnel ﬁles of all war
agencies. On December 2, 1945, the committee denounced “more than
two dozen” State Department officials as having Communist aﬁ’1lia-
tions. The State Department’s Intelligence Service Chief A. McCormack
categorically denied the accusation, but the committee did not retract
its charge. ,

In January the committee attacked President Truman's nominee
for governor of the Virgin Islands, Wiﬂiam Henry Hastie, who was
suspect, the committee said, because he had once been a sponsor of
a conference on constitutional liberties. '

Later in January Rankin denounced Chester Bowles as a Communist
when he announced a price ceiling for the 1946 cotton crop. The
N ew York H emld Tribune was moved to remark editorially that “a new
high for hysteria would seem to have been reached by Representative
Rankin in his denunciation of Chester Bowles. . . 

On March 15, 1946, Rankin returned to his major demand that
the President conduct a "housecleaning.” Two days later Committeeman
Mundt joined the drive with a demand that all U. S. personnel assigned
to the United Nations be screened for loyalty. On March 21 Rankin
again demanded a “clean-up of the Federal payroll.” On April 10 the
committee said it would investigate the State Department Research
and Intelligence Unit. On May 28 Rankin repeated his demand for
a “housecleaning." Orr May 29 an investigation of the "Communist
Party line” in the radio programs of government agencies was an-
nounced. On June 22 the charge was repeated that there were Com-
munists on the payroll of the State Department, and a “full scale
investigation” was threatened. On August 21 Rankin charged that
“certain elements” in the Justice Department were instigatingracial
disorders in the South “in an attempt'to seize power,” as he put it.
On November 26 it was announced that J. Parnell Thomas would
become chairman of the committee, and he said one of his major

aims would be the investigation of "Communist inﬁltration" in gov-
ernment agencies.

Later Thomas drafted a bill providing for a commission which, with-
out being required to furnish any charges or bill or particulars, could
conduct hearings and on ﬁnding that any government employe’s loyalty
is "in doubt,” could ﬁre him. “Any ﬁnding,” the bill provides,
 . . shall be ﬁnal and conclusive and shall not be subject to
review by any other authority.”

In its ofﬁcial report dated January 2, 1947, the committee recom-
mended “that the Congress create an independent commission with
authority to investigate and to order the discharge of any employe

‘or ofﬁcial of the Federal Government whose loyalty to the United

States is found to be in doubt.”

President Truman ﬁnally succumbed. On the 22nd of March,
1947, he issued his executive order for a loyalty purge of 2,000,000
federal workers and asked for an appropriation of $25,000,000 to
ﬁnance it. Congress has thus far granted an appropriation of $11,-
000,000. After ten years of existence the Un-American Committee
had ﬁnally consummated one of its major objectives.

The President’s executive order, No. 9835, now operating, is already
embodied in the Rees loyalty bill which has passed the House. The
order speciﬁes, among other things, that the ﬁles of the Un-American
Committee, which contained more than a million names two years
ago; be used as one of the principal sources in the investigation

5 of government employes. It provides that a federal employe be

summarily discharged for “sympathetic association” with ‘any group
“designated by the Attorney General as totalitarian, fascist, commu-
nist, or subversive.” The accused employe receives no statement of
speciﬁc charges, is not permitted to confront his anonymous accuser,
is refused the right to cross-examine witnesses. Absent under the
order, is any speciﬁcation, deﬁnition or limitation of the meaning
of "subversive.” By speciﬁcally ordering investigation ' of an ern-
ploye’s high school and college record, the order undermines free
and unpoliced study of subjects which may contain discussion of
persons or theories distasteful to the investigators.

As long ago as January, 1945, Chairman Cochran of the House
Accounts Committee said this of the Un-American Committees
vast blacklist: “The records of the Dies Committee . . . are valuable

27

records because they contain a tremendous number of names. And
how did they get those names? They conﬁscated mailing lists of
so-called subversive organizations they suspected of violating the
p , V laws of this country. . . . Undoubtedly my name is on the list; and
  so is yours.” .

 

The leaders of three organizations now under charges of contempt

 

  of Congress——the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, the National 
ix:  Federation for Constitutional Liberties and the National Council ;
 of American-Soviet Friendship—were cited ‘for contempt because , “ii

they refused to «swell the committees blacklist by submitting their
lists of contributors and supporters.

Distrust, suspicion and fear, now settling over the capital of the
United States, are spreading to other parts of the Country. .
1   — The Washington Port, commenting on testimony on the Rees
 bill, said it would cost “a whale of a lot of money . . . to ﬁnd
out that a number of Federal workers chose to buy phonograph
records at cut rates through the Washington Bookshop. (Member-
ship in the Washington Bookshop is one of the FBI-Civil Service
yardsticks for subversive aﬂiliation.) Several times 42,000 govern-
ment employes, we venture, have at one time or another in their
lurid pasts committed the indiscretion of contributing to Loyalist
Spain, signing petitions for repeal of the poll tax, or disagreeing
with some fellow employe who chose to regard the disagreement
as conclusive evidence of communist sympathies. . . . There was
a time when such conduct was considered an indisputable right of
free citizens. Now, however, it is looked upon officially as evidence
of subversive inclinations.” ,

A Washington correspondent for the newspaper PM, describing — ~ 
the fear that is blanketing the city, wrote on June 15, 1947: "Gov- 
  ernment employes—and they make up the larger share of the district's _
population——are beginning to look over their shoulders, to think 
twice about whom they invite to their homes; to hesitate before
 . buying any literature or attending any meetings which might be r r
 described as radical.” V
W In a report issued June 15, 1947, the National Lawyers Guild
 declares that the President’s loyalty order tends to “do violence to
 our fundamental law and our democratic way of life” and warns

that it is a threat "not to one group alone but to the great majority
of the American people.” ' .

Robert“ W. Kenny, president of the Lawyers Guild and former
Attorney-General of California, in a-- letter to President Truman
accompanying a copy of the report," wrote: ‘»‘We have sought to
evaluate it (the loyalty order), and other pending legislation, in
the light of legal and historical precedents going back to the adop-
tion of the Bill of Rights. In that light the Executive Order is seen

Palmer raids, and the German and Japanese systems of thought
control, form a part.

“Americans have the right to explore everywhere in the realm of

cate social change, however revolutionary.” ' _

"The more I think about one clause in the President's executive
order, the more troubled I am,” said Eleanor Roosevelt. “Under this

Assault on Labor.

"Resolved, that any laws or part: of law: setting a
limitation on the nnmher of harm a person may
work he repealed,.and that there shall he no additional
pay for overtime work or for worh on legal holidayr."

—From a statement inserted in the Congressional
Record, March 27, 1942, by Congressman Rankin

“Since we aholirhed the corrnpt Marxist-Jewish labor
-organizations, our German workers are no longer
agitated by materialirtic concern about honr: and

wager.”
——ADOLF HITLER
January 30, 1936

Successes have come to the House Committee on Un-American
Activities. Just as its ten-year Campaign to drive liberals, progres-
sives and New Dealers from the government has borne fruit in
the form of the President’s loyalty purge, so its ten-year drive
against the labor movement has borne similar fruit wtih the passage of
the Taft-Hartley slave labor bill. Neither of these measures would have
been possible of achievement in the year 1947 Without the long
softening-up work of the committee.

One of the major assaults on the labor movement, and inci-

identally its major effort to ‘defeat President Roosevelt in the 1944‘
campaign, took the form of an attack on the late Sidney Hillman

and the CIO Political Action Committee. In its report to Congress,
dated March 29, 1944, the Un-American Committee claimed to ﬁnd

evidence "suﬂicient to put the brand of communism on’ the Political-

Action Committee.” As for Hillman, the committee concluded gravely
that the CIO committee was “by. far the most sinister of all his
Communist coalitions.” In the process, the report managed to smear
21 international unions as dedicated to sinister and un-American
ends.

Congressman Rankin has been one of the most violently anti—labor
spokesmen throughout his 25-year career in the House of Repre-
sentatives; one of his proudest boasts is that there are no trade
unions in his Mississippi district. He has always been a vigorous
opponent of wage-hour legislation. '

Early in 1945 Rankin became the country’s most vociferous insti-
gator of antagonism between returning veterans and the trade unions,
and as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Legislation
he was in a favorable position to do this. His main project was

‘to organize discharged service men into a strikebreaking agency, and

he proposed a measure which would have exempted veterans from
any obligation to join or to pay union clues as a condition of employ-
merit,‘ regardless of existing closed shop or preferential shop con-
tracts. _On October 2, 1945, he declared: “If Congress will pass this
bill, and see that our young men who are no longer needed in
the service are discharged immediately, every strike will be broken
overnight.” 7 ’

Throughout -the strike movements of 1945 and 1946 the com-
mittee assigned investigators to hunt for “red links," and regularly
it issued statements to the press denouncing union officials and strike
leaders as Communists, always without supporting evidence and never
permitting the victims an opportunity to defend themselves.

In August, 1946, the committee made sensational headlines by
dispatching Ernie Adamson to Oak Ridge to investigate AFL organiz-
ing plans there, suggesting by innuendo that this might be an inter-
national plot to steal the secret of the atom bomb.

In November, 1946, Rankin demanded anti-labor legislation. The
Committee's report for July 7, 1946, had already worked out devious

31

 

  

 

 

arguments in support of such a demand. Strikes had reached record
proportions in the postwar reconversion period; the report explained
this easily; “Since the end of the Second World War," it said, “the
Communist movement realizes more than ever that its aims are
furthered by strikes.” Therefore, the strikes were communist-inspired;
remove the Communists and no more strikes. "Labor,’ said the
report, “should clean out the communistic element that has been
throttling the labor unions and causing mass strikes and resultant-
unemployment.” And since, to the committee, Communists are un--
American, and un-Americans are alien, it was logical that the com-
mittee should propose legislation prohibiting aliens from holding
union oﬂice.

Four days after Rankin made his first demand for anti-labor
legislation, Chairman Thomas promised that he would soon tmake
a public exposure of "Communists who control unions.” On Decem-
ber 3 Rankin in a public statement said he intended to press for
an immediate session of Congress for the purpose of passing legis-
lation -to end what he called a state of anarchy existing in the

nation. And twenty days after that the Hearst newspapers, main,

outlet for the committee’s advance relations, were supplied with excerpts
from a preliminary report on Communist inﬂuence in trade unions.
All of this served as preparation for the eventual passage of the
Taft-Hartley Bill, for which every member of the committee voted.

The clause permitting employers to refuse‘ to deal with unions

iwhose oﬂicials fail to ﬁle a sworn statement that they are not

"communist” and do not “believe in . . . the overthrow of the U. S.
Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods,"
is a specific product of the committee. The anti-labor character of
this purity test of union leadership is so apparent that even the
conservative AFL, vehement in its anti-communism, has oﬂicially
recommended that its internationals refuse to comply with this clause.

When Thomas took over the chairmanship he announced that
an investigation of the labor movement was one of his major aims.

In the midst of the strike of Camel cigarette workers in Winston-
Salem, N. C., in June, 1946, Rep. Herbert C. Bonner of North
Carolina and a member of the committee, called for an “investiga-
tion” of leaders of the striking union, the, CIO Food, Tobacco and

‘Agricultural Workers Union.

32

 

 

At this writing, the Un-American Committee has ﬁnally launched
its long-announced invasion of the labor movement. Subpoenaed
to appear in July for testimony and investigation were officers of
the Food and Tobacco Workers Union and the United Electrical
and Radio Machine Workers, the third largest CIO union. The
committee is proceeding despite an independent investigation of
the Camel strike that concluded that “after talking with t-he mayor
(of Winston-Salem), the chief of police, ministers of various de-

nominations and other prominent citizens, we were unable to ﬁnd

anyone who would say that the strike was ‘Communist-inspired.’
To the contrary,” said the three-man committee consisting of Dr.
David Jones, president of Bennet College, Dr. Clark Foreman, presi-
dent of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, and Jennings
Perry, newspaper columnist, "it was generally admitted that the
origins of the strike were those common to most strikes: s-failure to
agree on a renewal of contract, union insistence on a satisfactory
wage increase and on provisions to Protect the security of the
union. . . . When charges are made against union leaders during
a strike, the public should question keenly whether the accusations
are for the purpose of destroying the union rather than improving
it.” '
Meanwhile, the House Labor Committee, presided over by Fred
A. Hartley, ]r., co-author of the Taft-Hartley law, is responsible
for a perjury indictment just handed down against the leader
of the CIO Automobile Workers Union strike at Allis-Chalmers,
in Mil-waukee, Wisc., based -on his denial of alleged Communist
membership.

In the ﬁeld of labor, as well, the methods and aims of the Un-

;American Committee are being appropriated by other agencies of

government.

 

Some Aniericans Fight Back.

Late in 1945 the Un-American Committee attacked three organi-
zations, the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, the
Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, and the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship. The committee pre-judged and denounced
all three groups in the press as un-American before the ﬁrst wit-
nesses were called. These three organizations, from among almost
a score which the committee began to Phrsue, indicated an imme-
diate readiness to challenge the aims of the committee.

Since its formation in 1940 the National Federation for Con-
stitutional Liberties, under the chairmanship of George Marshall,
consistently fought the Un—American committee wherever it en-
croached upon the civil rights and democratic freedoms guaranteed
by the Constitution, circulating dozens of publications exposing the
committee and calling for its abolition in an organized campaign.
Nothing could be more un-American than this in the eyes of the

Un-American Committee and _it was quite natural that it would

single out the Federation and its leader for “investigation.”
Marshall, now chairman of the Board of the Civil Rights Congress,
with which the Federation has been merged, was subpoenaed to
appear before a sub-committee of the Un-American Committee,
consisting solely of Representative Thomas, on April 8, 1946. He
presented 45 exhibits typical of the publications of his organization

34 V .

¢§"”\'77 x:V:c: -. -.A,~'-

‘«vz.~r~. ,tr:v-m..»z ‘ .

and offered to produce more to establish that Federation activities
were not proper subjects for committee investigation. Three days
later he was subpoenaed to appear before the full committee in
Washington for further questioning. At both hearings his attorney
was excluded. He failed to give the committee the ﬁnancial record
and list of contributors to the Federation on the grounds that the
committee was exceeding its congressional and constitutional powers
in demanding them. He was cited for contempt on August 1, 1946,
and was later indicted.
V By his stand Marshall challenged the power of the committee
to add to its anti-fascist blacklist the names of thousands of persons
who supported the Federation's campaigns in defense of the demo-
cratic way of life; in effect he was protecting the right of all Ameri-
cans to be secure in the exercise of free speech and thought, free
assembly and free organization. In addition, he challenged the House
Resolution establishing the committee as itself unconstitutional.

The Marshall trial is set for the fall. -

. On June 27, 1947, sixteen leaders of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge

Committee were found guilty of contempt of Congress for failure
to comply with a demand of the committee to produce the organiza-
tion's books and records. ' n

The Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee was licensed during
the war by the President’s War Relief Control Board to provide
relief to refugees from Franco Spain. The organization maintains
three hospitals for refugees, two in France and one in Mexico, pro-
vides special care for Spanish children and extends economic aid in
rehabilitation of exiled Republicans.

Because the Un-American Committee has been a consistent sup-
porter of the Franco regime in Spain, it sought during the war,
unsuccessfully, to revoke ]AFRC’s license. It was only after this

’ failure that it subpoenaed Helen Bryan, secretary, Dr. Edward K.

Barsky, *-chairman, and later 16 members of the executive board,
including novelist Howard Fast and producer Herman Shumlin.

In its report for June 7, 1946, the Un-American committee devotes
57 pages of a total of 73 to the refugee organization, the whole
section consisting not of evidence to prove the contention that the
anti-fascist refugee committee is “un-American” but of a political
defense of Franco, all of «it strongly tainted with anti-Semitism.

this: “It appears that some of these money-collecting organizations
may have been quite unnecessary and Vvere operated primarily for
political purposes.” It appear: that some . . they may have . . .
The reference was toll relief organizations including American
Field Service, American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Hadas-
sah and Russian War Relief.

Because organizations supporting the refugee committee were in
favor of a break in diplomatic relations with the Franco government,
the report makes this assertion: “We must also assume that they
adhere to all other Communist Party objectives.”

Noting that some $250,000 was sent to Mexico City for relief
of refugees there, the report states: “Inasmuch as We are in receipt
of reliable information that Mexico City is now the center of
Communist activities in the Western Hemisphere, the ﬁgure would
lead one to believe that it is entirely possible that a considerable
portion of the $250,000 referred to was used for purposes other
than medical aid and relief.” This was serious "evidence.”

The same sort of “reasoning” as a substitute for evidence was
introduced in court during the trial. An expert "witness for the
Un-American Committee, a State Departmenthemploye named Robert
C. Alexander, testiﬁed according to United Press, that "one reason
he considered the organization a Communist-front group was that the
name included the word ‘anti-fascist.’ ”

\ In their defense the sixteen leaders held that the House resolution
establishing the Un-American Committee is unconstitutional because
it is an infringement on free speech, and that the ‘refugee committee
was not within the jurisdiction of the Un-American Committee be-
cause it is a relief agency and not engaged in propaganda. The case
is now on appeal.

The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, I;1c., was
"investigated" late in 1945 and a demand was made upon the leaders

. for “a list of the names of those who have donated to your organi-

zation and the amount of each donation, together with a list of
the organization’s expenditures by name and amount for the past
twelve months.” ‘

Richard Morford and Corliss Lamont, heads of the organization,
rejected the demand on the grounds that “the National Council is

36

 

<4» ~.'..‘

 

not a proper subject of interest for your Committee. . . . We are
unable to comprehend how our important work could possibly be
considered an un-American activity, . . . For us to yield to a request
based on this erroneous inference would not merely i:ause wanton
injury to the work of the National Council but would also have
a deleterious effect upon America’s foreign relations and thus be
a disservice to our Country. In fact, the request . if pursued,
would in itself contribute to the present reckless campaign to under-
mine those friendly relations between America and Russia upon
which the peace of the world depends.” ’

Lamont and Morford, in a letter to the Committee, made these
declarations: "Your committee . . . represents a modern inquisition
that has as its object‘ the destruction of the constitutional rights
of American citizens, who as taxpayers are forced to ﬁnance your
evil work. Your chief counsel, Ernie Adamson, is on record as
being opposed to democracy in the United States and as favoring
the investigation of workers for democracy as ‘un-American.’ The
dominant member of this House Committee, Congressman Rankin
of Mississippi, is an open proponent of the most virulent racial

, prejudice in regard to Negroes, Jews and other American minorities.”

In its ten-year history, the Un-American Committee has caused

many an otherwise self-respecting person to cringe before its threats—
. . D . . . .

.threats which could result in public defamation of the VlCt1m, or

C the loss of his job and career. There have, however, been an increasing

number of persons appearing before the committee, including gov-
ernment workers, trade unionists and ofﬁcers of progressive organi-
zations such as Harlow Shapley, who over the years ‘would not be
intimidated by the committee and who fought back. Among its op-
ponents have been a number of congressmen, more than a third at
certain times, of whom Adolph Sabath, Vito Marcantonio and Ellis
Patterson have been the most consistent and courageous.

Now for the ﬁrst time a group of men and women have had
the courage to engage in an all-out deﬁance of the Un-American
Committee, risking ﬁnes and imprisonment in the defense of their
organizations, their rights as Americans and in a challenge of the
constitutionality of the committee.

The Basic Technique: Red-hysteria.

"By equating the mildest form of liberalism with
Communism, the Dies Committee has been trying to
persuade the American people that such government
oﬂicers and other leaders as have heen trying to rem-
edy some of the most obvious ahuses which have
ﬂourished under our form of democracy have in real-
ity heen traitorous , , . (persons) whose real end is the
destruction of American society. I f such a panic can
he induced, if the American people can he duped into
helieving that every such attempt is an attempt to
estahlish Communism in this country, then» Mr. Dies
and those who cheer him on can hope to deliver this
government into the hands of reaction.”

——from The Christian Century, December 7, 1938

It "is nearly ten years since the above incisive deﬁnitioniof the
aims of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was made.
Today the committee is closer than ever before‘ to inducing. the
panic under which reaction may conceivably hope to seize complete
control of the government.

38

' » '§AM-AM-.\)

The committee has waged its ten-year crusade against the people’s
freedoms and liberties under the battle-cry of “Communism,” but
as has been shown, this is a blanket term with which to denounce
the mildest of progressive men and measures. It has been shown
that even the term “anti-fascist”’ is translated into “communist” by
the committee, and any organization describing itself as working
in _,behalf of democracy is immediately suspect.

Shortly after the committee was made permanent in 1945, it under-

‘ took another of its periodic attacks against the Communist party.

Several Communist leaders were subpoenaed and the committee _cam-
paigned vigorously to outlaw the organization after more than twenty-
five years of existence as a legal and recognized political party. If
the committee could ban the organization,» then anything and anybody
it denounced thereafter as "communist” could almost automatically
be defeated or destroyed.

The questioning of Communist leaders produced no results for
the committee; its official report for June 7, 1946, does not mention
any of the direct testimony taken from party officials, and subse-
quent hearings on the committee’s plan to outlaw the Communist
party failed to produce that result. But in the turmoil of the com-
mittee’s hectic campaign, three more persons were to be brought
to trial on contempt charges. a

One of these is Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the Com-
munist party, who demanded the right to appear before the com-
mittee and speak against legislation that would have made member-
ship in his organization a penal offense." He was allowed to appear,
but when he took the stand he was not permitted to read a prepared
statement. When he refused to answer questions not relevant to
the purpose of his appearance, he was violently ejected from the
hearing after being served with a subpoena which had been prepared

in advance. Upon the advice of his counsel, Dennis wrote the

committee that he would not appear, stating his constitutional grounds,
and was cited for contempt. It is upon that charge that he has
been convicted and sentenced to a year in jail and $1,000 ﬁne. The
case is now on appeal for a further test of the committee’s legality.
Committeeman Mundt, in the House discussion leading to the

0 citation of Dennis, revealed the committee’s aim. Expressing the hope

that “Eugene Dennis will wind up in» the penitentiary,” Mundt argued

39

-5

    

that the job would still not be done: there will be “a long succession
of potential leaders” whom the party could “throw into the breech.”
He declared he would not be satisﬁed “even if we have succeeded
now and then in checking off one of their leaders or putting "them
in jail.” Stymied by the constitution in the effort to outlaw the
Communist party, the committee charges ahead in its own fashion.

The committee created the sort of shrieking headlines it considers
essential to its work of spreading fear when it released its sensa-
tional charges against Gerhardt Eisler as “an international plotter,”
an “atom bomb spy” and "the ‘most ‘dangerous man in America?’

Eisler, an Austrian, came to America in 1941 as a refugee from
la Vichy concentration camp on his way to Mexico at the invitation
of the Mexican government. He was compelledto stay in this country
because of emergency legislation during _the war. His transit visa
was replaced by a visitor’s visa, and at no time during the war
was he regarded as an “enemy alien.” He worked as a journalist
for a patriotic German-language paper founded to combat the inﬂu-
ence of the Bund, and he served as an air-raid warden and a blood
donor.

After the defeat of Hitler's armies, Eisler applied repeatedly for
an exit permit, and ﬁnally on July 31, 1946, following many hours
of questioning by the FBI, it was granted. Two days before his ship
was to sai1—his baggage had been cleared and part of it was aboard———
he discovered accidentally that his exit permit had been cancelled
and that the Un-American Committee wanted to question him.
By not "informing him of the cancellation, it had been hoped to
create the impression that Eisler had been apprehended while trying
to "escape.” I

On November 22 Eisler appeared before the committee -under
subpoena but was not asked to testify. He was preparing to appear
again on February 6; he had drafted a written statement, had pur-
chased railroad tickets to Washington and had made hotel reserva-
tions, but "he was suddenly placed under arrest by the Attorney
General at the instigation of the committee as a "dangerous enemy

..alien,” in an effort to make it appear that he had been unwilling
to testify. A _

When he was brought before the committee under guard; he
requested the right to make a three-minute statement concerning the

40

 

 

‘M

illegality of his arrest before being sworn. The committee’s refusal
of this request led to the contempt citation under which Eisler was

convicted and given the maximum sentence of one year in jail

and $1,000 ﬁne. “His case is being appealed.
' “I am not an atom-bomb spy nor a spy of a lower species,”

iEisler has declared. "I am not a foreign agent, not the  of

all the Reds in this or any other country and I am not a dangerous
enemy alien. I never intended to overthrow the American govern-
ment and I neyer harmed the American people. I am at German

Communist, a political exile who wanted to go to Mexico, and who

is ﬁghting now for the right to go home in peace.”

Third Communist to be cited for contempt is Leon Josephson,

an American attorney who had aided the underground movement
against Hitler in Germany. He has explained his own stand on the
contempt citation: "By creating a hysteria over Communism, it (the
committee) is trying to scare every progressive into acquiescence to
‘reaction, to destroy the progressive trade unions and to wipe out the
broad social gains achieved under Roosevelt. I do not believe that
this committee is activated by ignorance, but rather by a well-planned

, program to create a national psychological basis for a domestic brand

of fascism. I have been advised by counsel that the proceedings of this
committee are repugnant to the provisions of our Constitution, and I
feel it my duty to challenge its legality in the courts. I am conﬁdent
that I will ultimately be sustained.” _Tosephs0n’s trial is pending.

The Evil Spreads.

Inspired by the example of the successes of the House Committee
on Un-American Activities, reactionary forces everywhere are applying
the committee’s methods and techniques on a local scale.

In Alabama the legislature is considering a bill which would require
all state employes to declare under oath that they are not Communists.

In Michigan the repressive Callahan Bill has been made into law.
This most extreme form of hysteria proceeds upon the theory that the
State of Michigan is imminently threatened by an unidentiﬁed foreign
power, and that unnamed agents of this power are operating Within
the borders of the state. It would outlaw “any individual, group, club,
league, society, committee, association, political party . . . subsidized
by a foreign government or serving directly or indirectly the purposes,
aims or objects of a foreign power or powers.” The decision is arbi-
trarily in the hands of the state attorney general. A federal bill to the
same effect has been introduced in the House by Un-American Com-
mitteeman Karl E. Mundt.

_ The Army has not only disowned its ‘var-time orientation material
on fascism, but has prepared new material which contains some of the
major views of the Un-American Committee itself. .

In California, the Tenney Committee, patterned after the House
Committee, has long been doing locally what the House Committee

has done nationally, and only recently a "little Dies” committee was
established by law in the State of Washington.

The American Legion in recent weeks has expelled two members on
the charge of “Communism,” and a New York Supreme Court Justice
has upheld the organization’s right to make such expulsions in a third
case.

In Peoria, III., in April, 1947, Paul Robeson was prevented by action
of the City Council and by threat of physical violence from making
a concert appearance there after the Un—American Committee had
named the singer as a sponsor of “Communist front” organizations.

In the same month the School Board of Albany, New York, can-
celled permission for a Robeson concert scheduled in a high school.
A court order obtained after considerable local agitation, reopened the
school to Robeson.

Also in April the directors of the Hollywood Bowl Association in
Los Angeles denied the use of the amphitheater for a speech by Henry
Wallace.

In June, 1947, an unsuccessful effort was made to prevent Wallace
from speaking in the government-owned Watergate amphitheater in
Washington, D. C., and the House Committee itself sought to limit
attendance by announcing that it would have observers present to

C “spot” those attending. ~

Similar attacks on basic freedoms are now being made on the cam-
puses of the nation’s colleges and universities. Committeeman Rankin
is the sponsor of a bill which provides a ten-year prison sentence and
a $10,000 ﬁne for teachers in public or private schools who “express
or convey the impression of sympathy with or approval of,‘ Commu-
nism or Communist ideology.” The student organization, American
Youth for Democracy, is banned from every campus in California. The
organization has been banned at Queens College in New York, at
Michigan State College, at Wayne University in Detroit, and it is
under attack in many other schools.

These are some of the things now happening in the atmosphere of
national hysteria created by the House Committee on Un-American
Activities. The entire democratic way of life is threatened.

Liberty can Be Preserved.

Long ago columnist Walter Lippman said of the Un-American
Committee that it was unlawful and its procedure “a violation of
American morality. . . . It is a pillory in which reputations are ruined,
often without proof and always without the legal safeguards that pro-
tect the ordinary criminal; it is a tribunal before which men are at-
raigned and charged with acts that are, as a matter of fact, lawful."

Recently 30 outstanding American citizens, including Thomas Mann,
Dr. Sherwood Eddy, Dashiell Hammett, Carey McWilliams, Bishop
Arthur W. Moulton, and Clifford Odets, issued this statement: “As
American citizens concerned with the future of democracy in our land,
we condemn the undemocratic practices of the Thomas-Rankin House
Committee on Un-American Activities, most recently exempliﬁed by
the shameful persecution of the anti-fascist refugee, Gerhardt Eisler.
The hysterical atmosphere contrived around this case, involving a
German Communist kept here against his will, indicates that it is
intended as the initial phase of a sweeping attack upon the labor and
progressive movement in the United States. Were such tactics to
remain unchecked in our nation, as in Germany in the early 1950's,
we Americans would have ourselves to blame for consequences pos-
sibly as disastrous as those which overtook the German people."

On June 18, 1947, Harold Ickes wrote in his column in the New

activities ever since it was organized. It has been used to frighten and

. . . This is dirty

Where ‘Do We Go From Here?

Abolition of the Un—American Committee has become a must job
for all who cherish democracy and are determined to save America
from the horrors of a police state.

Recognition of the plain fact that the Un-American Committee is a
menace to our country is widespread. There is scarcely an organization
making a pretense of being liberal which is not on record for its
abolition. Among these are the Congress of Industrial Organizations,
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples, the

45

 

Advance Guard of Reaction.

For ten years the House Committee on Un-American Activities,
now under the chairmanship of Representative J. Parnell Thomas of
New Jersey, has stirred up suspicion, created discord and spread fear.

As this is being written twenty-two leaders of progressive organ-
izations have either been tried and convicted and are appealing their
cases, or are awaiting trial because they deﬁed the inquisitional and
unconstitutional demands of the committee. No such interference with
the rights of American citiens has occurred in this country since the
"Palmer Raids” in 1920.

In the atmosphere built by ten years of such intimidation'Congress
has enacted into law over a Presidential veto an anti-labor bill which
mutilates or destroys the modern gains of the trade-union movement.

In the atmosphere created by ten years of witch—hunting a Presiden-
tial executive order subjecting two million Federal employees to a
"loyalty” test is possible.

Such an atmosphere makes possible the current anti-Soviet cam-
paign with its implied threat of a new war.

It is this atmosphere which is inspiring current activities on college
campuses and in the nation's schools which threaten the foundations
of ‘academic freedom.

It is the atmosphere created by a committee serving as a sounding

 

 

\ Southern Conference for Human V/elfare, the Progressive Citizens of
America and the National Lawyers Guild———to name only a few.

Its manner and method have been highly offensive to the American
sense of. decency and fair play. But increasingly apparent has it be-
come that the manner and method are an essential part, and only a
part, of its aim and function. Fundamentally, as even the facts in this
brief pamphlet indicate, the aim of the Un-American Committee is to
destroy the free channels of expression, and to wipe out all dissenting
opinion by destroying the freedom of organizations, be they labor,
racial or political, The activities of the committee present a deadly
parallel with the pattern that Hitler applied to continental Europe.

One out of every 140 Americans is ‘bn the committee’s infamous
blacklist. It is reasonable to assume that the committee is on the black-
list of millions of Americans. Twelve million organized workers have
blacklisted each and every one of its individual members—for giving
active support to the Taft-Hartley law at every stage of its legislative
history, including voting to over—ride the President's veto.

How are we to make this majority opposition to the Un-American’

Activities Committee effective? That is the big question for all citizens
of good-will and democratic purpose today.

The Civil Rights Congress is now undertaking the main burden of
carrying the issues to the entire American people.

Building the Civil Rights Congress, locally and nationally, is one
method of éldvancing this movement for the abolition of the Un-
American Committee.

By defense in and out of court of the victims of this 1947 Inquisit-ion
the Civil Rights Congress provides another effective means of com-
batting the committee’s vicious inﬂuence, exposing its pro-fascist aims
and challenging its illegal existence.

But court tests of the committee’s constitutionality will more likely
succeed if they are accompanied by pressure on Congress for its
disestablishment. The Sabath resolution, introduced in the 80th Con-
gress, which would amend the Rules of the House to strike Out this
committee, is the specific means. The passage of this House resolu-
tion can be accomplished by an aroused public sentiment against the
Un-American Committee's subversion of our democratic way of life.

We have given you the facts. Now it’s up to YOU.

board for the anti-Negro and anti-Semitic utterances of Congressman
John Rankin that has led to the present growth of lynchings and the
increase of anti-Semitism everywhere. '

In the past year, the sweeping and virulent character of the activities
of the Un-American Committee has radically changed its role. It is no
longer the discordant voice lost in the great‘ sweep that brought the
military defeat of nazism and fascism. Instead, this committee has
become the press agent par excellence, the advance guard for a
growing movement to defeat and \ eliminate the policies and forces
identiﬁed with the successful war years. K

As long ago as 1940 the late Representative Lee Geyer of Cal-
ifornia, who introduced the first anti-poll tax bill, predicted that the
Un-American Committee, unless halted, would eventually "spread
mutual distrust and fear among the common people of America;
create a war hysteria; disrupt and destroy the progressive organizations
through which people seek to solve their problems of jobs, security,
wages and living standards; weaken trade unions; hobble the minds of
students and muzzle their teachers. . .  C

Today a handful of men and women has had the courage to defy
the inquisitors and to challenge their authority to override the Consti-
tution of the United States. Support for these men and women is sup-
port for the democratic way of life. For destruction of that way of
life is the aim of the Un-American Committee.

“Vigilante committee.”

"The vote (in the Home) showed that the membemt

of Congren are in fan/or of leaving 4 Vigilamte Com-
mittee . . . I took up tbir ﬁght to/oere (Dies) left 017.”

——CONGRESSMAN RANKIN
on the CBS, January 16, 1945

By 1944, a war year, the Dies Committee had earned the disgust
of most of America. President Roosevelt had denounced the group for
its abuses. "Most fair-minded Americans,” he said, “hope that the com-
mittee will abandon its practice of merely providing a forum to ‘those
who, for political purposes or otherwise, seek headlines they could
not otherwise obtain . . . I was disturbed . . . because a Congressional
committee charged with the responsibility of investigating un-Ameri-
can activities should have permitted itself to be used in a ﬂagrantly un-
fair and un-American attempt to influence an election.” He described
the committee’s procedure as "sordid?

Vice-President Henry Wallace had also publicly stated that the com-
mittee sought “to inﬂame the public mind by malicious distortion of
facts,” and added that “the effect on the morale of the country would
be less damaging if Mr. Dies were on the Hitler payroll.”

Dies himself in 1943 had said that to him- it was more important
to defeat President Roosevelt than Hitler. “The war against the bureau-
crats,’ he said, “is more important than anything else.”

In 1944 he did not even attempt to stand for re-election. Three of
the members of his committee were defeated at the polls, and another
resigned. It seemed for a time that the people had ﬁnally ended the
career of the Dies Committee.

But on January 3, 1945, the ﬁrst_ day of the ﬁrst session of the new
Congress, Rankin, a cunning parliamentarian, introduced a resolution
to amend the‘ rules of the House and, taking advantage of the shock
of surprise, succeeded in getting an eleven-vote majority to re-establish
the committee on a permanent basis. It was the first time in history that
an investigating committee was put on an equal footing with all
other standing committees of the House.

Because the criticism of the Dies Committee had been so great, Rankin
gave assurances that its abuses would not be repeated.

“I do not believe, and I have never believed,” he said, “in smear
campaigns." But in little more than a month he launched his first

tsmear——against the War Department.

“I am not in favor of an individual giving out reports that /are
supposed to be reports of the committee,” he said. But it was not to
be long before the Hearst newspapers and Gerald L. K. Smith were
receiving reports before the committee saw them.

Representative Edward J. Hart of New Jersey was named chairman
of the committee and on January 15 he made a plea for moderation:
“The comrﬁittee should ﬁnd its proper area of action and adhere to it
and while a Congressional Committee is not bound legally to follow
the judicial rules of evidence, it has a moral obligation and should
adhere to such rules as it has and be fair.”

Congressman Rankin disagreed. Next day he said over the Columbia
Broadcasting System: "The vote showed that‘ the members of Congress
are in favor of having a Vigilante Committee . . . I took up this ﬁght
where he (Dies) left off.” It was not long before Chairman, Hart re-
signed. Rankin and his committeemen have behaved ever since as
true vigilantes, knowing no law but their own prejudices.

 

 

 

What is “lln-American?”

The Committee on Un-American Activities has never adopted a
deﬁnition of "un-American.” The term means anything with which
the committee disagrees.

No legal deﬁnition of "un-Americanism” exists, either in statute
or in judicial decision. The resolution which created the committee
states that it "is authorized to make from time to time investigations
of (1) the extent, character, and objects of un-American propaganda
activities in the United States, (2) the diffusion within the United
States of subversive and un-American propaganda that is instigated
from foreign countries or of a domestic origin and attacks the prin-
ciple of the ‘form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution,
and (3) all other questions in relation thereto that would aid Con:
gress in any necessary remedial legislation.” T

The interpretation of “un-American,” “subversive,” and "the prin-
ciple of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution”
is left entirely to the committee and its individual members.

On the day after the committee was formed, Representative Clare
Hoffman. of Michigan made a contribution to the debate: those who
voted for the committee, he said, "believe it is their duty to keep those
who would destroy constitutional government from boring from within.
They know no reason why left-wingers, parlor pinks, New Dealers——
who advocate the remaking of America, who prophesy the destruction
