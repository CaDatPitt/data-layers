Unconstitutionality of Registration and Related Provisions

The foregoing analysis demonstrates that the registration
and related provisions of the bill are unconstitutional for the
following reasons:

1. Sections 5 and 6 deny the right of employment or of
holding non-elective ofﬁce under the United States and the
right to obtain passports, merely. for membership in a “Com-
munist political organization.” Section 10 makes mere mem-
bership in such organization a crime under certain conditions.
These penalties and the drastic social and economic conse-
quences of belonging to a prosecuted orglanization apply
without regard to any action, fault or wrongful intent on the
part of the individual. This is the clearest application of the
unconstitutional doctrine of built by association. Under our
law, guilt is personal, and our Courts have recognized that
members of an organization notoriously do not adhere to all
of its tenets.

2. Organizations may be destroyed and their members
subjected to legal, social and economic disabilities merely be-
cause of the views they or some of their m-embers advocate,
regardless of how peaceable their conduct. Thus the First
Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and assem-
bly is violated.

3. Registration imposes severe punishment on the or-
ganizations and their members. This punishment is imposed
on the basis of vague standards, and hence violates the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

4. Registration may readily subject the organization and
its members to prosecution under section 4(a). Hence, the
requirement of registration compels self-incrimination in vio-
laton of the Fifth Amendment.

Our views as to the unconstitutionality of these bills
are supported in l-arge measure by the opinions of the lawyers
whom the Senate Judiciary Committee last year recognized
as constitutional experts. Their comment-s were made with
respect to the former Mundt-Nixon bill (H. R. 5852), but
the present versions of these bills have not removed the de-
fects they noted.

Charles Evans Hughes, Jr. found the criteria for deter-
mining “Communist organizations” in section 3 of the old
Mundt bill (now contained in sections 3 and 14) to be clearly
unconstitutional for vagueness. He said:

“In my judgment, the deﬁnitions in section 3 of the
organizations against which, or against the members of
which, the above sections are directed, are permeated

with even greater vagueness and ambiguity than are
those of section 4.” (Page 417 of Hearings on H. R. 5852).
John W. Davis expressed "a similar view. He said:

“I am constrained to think that because of its in-
deﬁniteness and uncertainty the bill fails to meet the
constitutional requirement of due process.

“ . . . It would seem to be clear that if the deﬁnitions
are themselves vague and uncertain that uncertainty
must vitiate the act throughout.” (Page 420 of Hear-
ings on H. R. 58-52).

Indeed the entire principle of requiring registration as
a condition to the exercise of freedom of speech or assembly
even when done only for the purpose of identiﬁcation without
invidious characterization is violative of the Bill of Rights.
As the Supreme Court said in Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S.
516, “As a matter or principle a requirement of registration
in order to make a public speech would seem generally im-
compatible with an exercise of free speech and free assembly.”

2. UNLAWFUL AGREEMENTS (Section 4(a))

Section 4(a) of the bill makes it unlawful for persons
knowingly to conspire or agree “to perform any act which
would substantially facilitate or aid in the establishment
within the United States of a totalitarian dictatorship, the
direction and control of which is to be vested in, or exercised
by or under the domination or control of, any foreign govern-
ment, foreign organization or foreign individual.” “Totali-
tarian dictatorship” is deﬁned as a non-representative form
of government characterized by the existence of a single politi-
cal p-arty, which is for all practical purposes identical with
the Government, all other parties being prohibited.

In short, this subsection would punish a person for con-
duct which Was not intentionally in aid of totalitarian dicta-
torship and which would not involve otherwise unlawful con-
duct, if only a court should ﬁnd that an innocently done act
in fact contributes to the establishment of the dictatorship.
All that need be shown is that two or more people agree to
do something which a court might ﬁnd substantially aids in
the result. 2

The phrase “any act which would substantially facilitate
or aid” is without clear meaning. However, according to the
deﬁnitions in Sections 2 and 3 the Communist Party and the
other proscribed groups seek to establish a “totalitarian dic-
tatorship” in the United States under foreign control or
function primarily to that end. Hence any cooperation with
them in furtherance of common objectives, including acts
which are constitutionally protected, is readily construable as

 

 

10

an act or agreement to commit an act which “would substan-
tially facilitate or aid” the establishment of such a dictator-
ship.

This sub-section -also contains words other than “sub-
stantially facilitates or aids,” which have no clearly deﬁned
meaning, such as “direction and control of which is to be
vested in, or exercised by or under the domination or control
of . . . , ” and “charact-erized by.”

In the light of the foregoing analysis, sub-section 4(a)
is unconstitutional for the following reasons:

1. Under the guise of punishing attempts to establish
a totalitarian dictatorship in the United States dominated
from abroad, it permits the punishment of peaceful advocacy
and assembly as distinguished from acts and incitements
threatening the immediate destruction of our government.
Accordingly, it violates the First Amendment, which denies
to Congress the power to make any law abridging freedom
of speech or assembly.

2. It violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amend-
ment because it deﬁnes a crime in terms so vague and indeﬁ-
nite that an ordinary citizen cannot know from reading it
what conduct is prohibited.

The three distinguished lawyers whose opinions on the
constitutionality of last year’s Mundt-Nixon bill were sought
and secured by the Senate Judiciary Committee had this to
say about the corresponding section of that bill which was
substantially the same as the present section 4(a) :

Charles Evans Hughes, J r.:

“The question of the validity of this bill turns prin-
cipally on that of its compatibility with the ﬁrst and ﬁfth
amendments to the Constitution.

“In my opinion, secion 4 of the bill offends both of
these principles. . . . (Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S.
359 (1931) ; Herndon v.. Lawry, 301 U. S. 242, 249-250,
255, 260-261 (1937). See Schneiderman V.‘ United
States, 320 U._ S. 117, 137-138 (1943).’’ (Page 416 of
Hearings on H. R. 5852).

Attorney General Tom C. Clark:

“From the language of the bill, it appears uncertain
whether mere membership in a Communist organization
as deﬁned in section 3, would constitute a violation of
section 4. The principle that a criminal staﬁite must
be deﬁnite and certain in its meaning and application
iswell established; a principle which may not be satis-
ﬁed by the deﬁnitions and criteria of the bill, Connolly

 

 

11

V. General Construction Company (269 U. S. 385) ; Lan-
ze-tta V. New Jersey (306 U. S. 451).

“It is also doubtful whether or not this proposal
will meet the requirements of due process under the
Fifth Amendment. A statute which would deﬁne the
nature and purposes of an organization or group by
legislative ﬁat is likely to run afoul of the due process
requirements. Manley v. State of Georgia (279 U. S. 1
(1929)).” (Page 424 of Hearings on H. R. 5852).
John W. Davis:

“It may well be that some or all of the evils with
which the bill purports to deal are not susceptible of
more precise description. But that which cannot be
deﬁned cannot be criminally punished under our concep-
tion of law.’’ (Page 421 of Hearings on H. R. 5852.)

It may be asked why, if the bills are so patently uncon-
stitutional, we cannot leave it to the court to throw out
any such measure, should it be enacted. The principal
reasons are that ordinarily it takes years for a case to reach
the highest court, and, in the meantime, many perfectly law-
ful organizations could be destroyed, while millions of Ameri-
cans would fear to exercise their constitutional rights of
freedom of speech and association; that judges are but men,
and subject to the pressures of national hysteria. The very
indifference of the people could inﬂuence their judgment.

THIS LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY

What is the justiﬁcation offered for the introduction of
these repressive bills? It is said that such legislation is
needed “to preserve the sovereignty of the United States”
(Section 2(11)).

If, as the preamble to the bill claims, there exists a con-
spiracy in this country seeking to destroy our national secur-
ity and subject us to a foreign dictatorship, then such activity
can be prosecuted under existing criminal legislation, which
is adequate for that purpose. Aside from numerous State
statutes, there are Federal criminal statutes which punish
the following activities among others:

Acting as agent of a foreign government without‘ notiﬁ-
cation to the Secretary of State (18 U. S. C., section 951);
possession of property in aid of foreign government for use
in violating any penal statute or treaty rights of the U. S.
(18.U. S. C. section 957); espionage activities (18 U. S. C.
sections 793-797) ; inciting or aiding rebellion or insurrection
(18 U. S. C., section 2383) ; seditious ‘conspiracy (18 U. S. C.,
section 2384); advocating overthrow of the government by

12

force (18 U. S. C., section 2385; treason (18 U. S. 0., section
2381) ; misprision of treason (18 U. S. C., section 2382) ; un-
dermining loyalty discipline or morale of armed forces (18
U. S. C., section 2387) ; sabotage (18 U. S. C., section 2156) ;
importing literature advocating treason, insurrection or forci-
ble resistance to any federal law (18 U. S. C., section 552);
injuring federal property or communications (18 U. S. C.,
section 1361) ; conspiracy against the constitutional rights of
citizens (18 U. S. C., section 371). Organizations engaged in
civilian military activity, subject to foreign control, afﬁliated
with a foreign government, or seeking to overthrow the Gov-
ernment by force, are subject to registration requirements
under the Voorhis Act (18 U. S. C., 2386).

While some of these Acts may themselves be in part
unconstitutional as punishing mere advocacy of ideas, they
do not differ in that respect from this proposed bill. If some
of these Acts have technical deﬁciencies these can be remedied
by technical amendments.

The purpose and effect of the Mundt-Nixon bill, however,
is not to avert danger to our government and democratic in-
stitutions. Instead, it is, as appears from the foregoing
analysis, designed to suppress or punish dissenting political
expression or assembly under the pretext that such expres-
sion or assembly constitutes a conspiracy to establish a
totalitarian dictatorship under foreign control. This purpose
the bill would accomplish by permitting an administrative
determination of a treasonable status on the basis of standards
and proofs which are relevant not to treasonable activities
but to the expression of dissenting opinion.

THE BILLS THREATEN SELF-GOVERNMENT A

It is the essence of our democracy that the people shall
govern themselves. Their only hope of doing so wisely lies
in the collective wisdom derived from the fulle-st possible
information, and the fair presentation of differing opinions.
Without such information our people cannot ﬁnd ther Way
intelligently to the policies and candidates who suit their
Wishes and needs and our government cannot be made re-
sponsive to their Will.

Because in a democracy the people must have the right
to choose the good from the bad ideas, no-governmental au-
thority “can prescribe What shall be orthodox in politics,
nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.” (Board
of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 641, 642.) In.deed,
the Supreme Court has said, “The very purpose of the First
Amendment is to preclude public authority from assuming a

 

L.....a--.-....- -J

13

guardianship of the public’s mind through regulating press,
speech and religion. In this ﬁeld every person must be his
own watchman for truth, because the forefathers did not
Want any government to separate the truth from the false for
us.” (Thomas V. Collins, 323 U. S. 511, 545).

This freedom to speak, to write, to hear, to choose, with-
out governmental interference, must carry with it the eﬁec-
tive right to persuade to action. “The First Amendment is
a charter for government, not for an institution of learning.
‘Free trade in ideas’ means free trade in the opportunity to
persuade to action, not merely to describe facts.” (Rutledge,
J. In Thomas v. Collins, supra, page 537). And “freedom
to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much.
That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its
substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the
heart of the existing order.” (Jackson J., In Board of Educa-
tion v. Barnette, supra, page 642).

If these democratic principles are to be made effective,
the people must be free to organize into associations, whether
political, religious or economic, without governmental re-
straint. For it is only through such associations, that the
will of the people can be brought to bear upon the market
place of ideas, and upon the governmental authorities.

Because these bills would deny that freedom of associa-
tion and expression to all who fail to meet the criteria of
political orthodoxy which they prescribe, the bills strike at
the very foundation of democratic government in the United
States. For they sweep within their ambit the liberties of
all Americans, making the exercise of liberty subject to the
constant surveillance of a governmental commission clothed
with almost limitless power.

There is a painful incongruity between these bills and
the principles of freedom for which our representatives at
the United Nations and in many foreign lands purportedly
stand. The United States had a leading part in sponsoring
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which has been
approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Article 19 of the Declaration states: “Everyone has the right
to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers.” Article 20 provides in part:
“Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly
and association.” In our view it is impossible to square these
bills with our moral obligations under the Universal Declara-
ton‘ of Human Rights.

14

CONCLUSION

At a time when many Americans ﬁnd themselves in
active opposition to certain governmental policies, both do-
mestic and foreign; when intense indignation exists as the
rights of the Negro people are neglected by Congress; when
labor remains burdened with the infamous Taft—Hart1ey law
still on the books; when unemployment rises and the spectre
of depression haunts the nation; when the threats to peace
become more imminent, the proponents of the Mundt— Fer-
guson bills evidently seek to stiﬂe protest, to suppress opposi-
tion, to compel conformity. We are asked to abandon our
constitutional safeguards, to shut the mouths and minds of
dissenters.

We are a nation of protest and dissent. Most of our
people have shown that they favor social change; they mean
to strive for a better life. The right to think and speak freely
are fundamental to us, recognizing as we do, that free)
thought and free speech are the indispensable conditions for
every other freedom we enjoy. All of this the enactment of
the Mundt-Ferguson bills would destroy. Whether this occurs
depends upon the vigor with which an aroused liberty—loving
people asserts itself now.

ANALYSIS OF THE MUNDT-FERGUSON BILLS
AND
OPINION ON THEIR UNCONSTITUTIONALITY

STATEMENT

Adherence to democratic principles has made America
great——-has made it possible for our country to progress in
the face of gigantic trials and vast changes in the condition
of life in the United States and the rest of the world. Our
national interest, and the welfare of every American, requires
that this heritage of freedom and democracy shall be cher-
ished by us all, and vigilantly safeguarded against every
threatened inroad.

The National Lawyers Guild is opposed to the passage
of the Mundt-Ferguson bills because it regards them as
dangerous and far—reaching encroachments on the funda-
mental liberties of the American people, including freedom
of speech, press, assembly, and the guarantee against punish-
ment without due process of law. It believes that these
bills if enacted will go far towards destroying the very foun-
dations of our democratic system, for they would outlaw any
effective voice in serious opposition to the existing order.

MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILLS

The Mundt bill is a refurbished Version of the Mundt-
Nixon bill which failed of passage in the closing hours of the
80th Congress after having engendered a storm of opposition.
The new bill is, according to Mr. Mundt in a press release,
design-ed to be “tougher” than its predecessor; it “sharpens
the teeth and expands the bite.” In view of the virtual
identity of the Mundt and Ferguson bills we shall discuss
only the .former.

The heart of the bill lies in its provisions relating to
the registration of certain organizations, and the consequences
of membershp therein.

1. THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS (Sections 7 and 8)

_ The bill recognizes two types of “subversive” organiza-
tions: “Communist political organizations” and “Communist
front organizations.” Together, there are known as “Com-
munist organizations.”

 

  

2

Every Communist political and front organization as
deﬁned in the bill is required to register as such with the
Attorney Gener.al. The registration statement must include
the name of the organization, the name and address of each
officer, and an accounting of all moneys received and expended
during the preceding year, including the sources from which
received and the purposes of expenditures. In the case of
Communist Political organizations, the registration statement
must also include the names, addresses and aliases of all
members. The distinction in favor of Communist front or-
ganizations is, however, more apparent than real. Since
front organizations must register the sources of their reve-
nues, complying with such regulations as the Attorney Gen-
eral may prescribe, it is obvious that they may be required
to register the names of dues-paying members as sources of
revenue. A member of an organization which registers as
a Communist political organization, but which fails to list-his
name, must himself register, or be subject to crimnal
penalties.

The registrations must be kept up to date by annual
reports and are open to public inspection.

Literature of any organization which ha.s registered or
been ordered to register may not be mailed or transmitted
in interstate commerce unless labelled on the outside as dis-
seminated by a Communist organization. Radio or television
broadcasts of such organizations must be preceded by an
announcement that the program is sponsored by a Communist
organization. Such organizations are also denied tax ex-
emptions, and contributions to the organizations are not tax-
deductible.

Members of organizations registered or ordered to regis-
ter as Communist political organizations may not hold non-
elective federal oﬂice, and it is unlawful for them in seeking or
accepting any federal office or employment to conceal their
membership. Such members, also, may not apply for or use
passports.

But these disabilities, severe as they are, are mild com-
pared to the unexpressed social and economic consequences
which will b-efall the members of a registered organization.
A registered organization is, under the bill’s deﬁnitions, con-
tained in Sections 2 and 3, conspiratorial, disloyal, and sedi-
tious. By legislative ﬁat such organizations are “found”
to be directed and controlled by “the world communist move-
ment” dominated by Russia, and dedicated to “the overthrow
of existing governments” . . . by “conspiratorial and coercive
tactics.” Individuals in the United States “who knowingly

 

 

-4-—-.4- A A\__ ,_ .._f

3

participate in the world Communist movement” are “found”
to “repudiate their allegiance to the United States.”

It is perfectly apparent therefore, that no organization
can or will voluntarily register under these provisions. At-
torney General Tom C. Clark pointed this out when he said:
“It can be assumed that no organization would confess guilt
by registration. . . . ” (Page 424, Hearings on H. R. 5852).
The simple fact is that the mere act of registration would
cause an organization either to disappear or to become an
illegal, “underground” society. No organization could retain
open membership and support if it either voluntarily regis-
tered or was ordered to do so by official governmental action
requiring disclosure of its membership. I.ts officers, mem_
bers and contributors must either depart from the organiza-
tion or be subject to the most onerous, and increasingly famil-
iar sanctions of public odium, including loss of employment,
social stigmatization, expulsion from “legitimate” organiza-
tions, and perhaps mob violence. Even resignation would
not wholly save the victims because the names must be ﬁled
of all those who were members at any time in the preceding
year. What is more, they may all be subjects for prosecution
under section 4(a) of the bill, discussed below. (See At-
torney General’s Opinion to the same effect, page 423 of Hear-
ings on H. R. 5852.)

Accordingly, the sponsors of the bill misstate the case
when they assert that the bill merely performs disclosure
functions, and does not outlaw any organization. The fact
is that the bill envisages not that any organization will regis-
ter, but rather that individuals will be relentlessly prosecuted
for belonging to organizations which have failed to register.

The bill then, effectively outlaws organizations within
its scope. Our next point is that this scope is unconscionably
broad and vague; that it includes organizations which merely
exercise constitutional rights; that its standards for determin-
ing which organizations must register are irrelevant to the
opprobrious conclusions to be drawn; that an entire group
can be destroyed because some of its members or leaders are
believed to be “bad” people.

The bill establishes a Subversive Activities Commission,
composed of three members designated by the President, one
each from the State Department, the Department of Com-
merce, and the National Military Establishment. If the At-
torney General has “reason to believe” that an organization
which has not registered is in fact required to register, he
must seek an administrative determination on the subject
from the Commission. In addition, the Commission reviews

 

 
 

4

determinations of the Attorney General refusing requests
to cancel a registration of a registered organization or to
strike the name of an individual listed in a registraton state-
ment. The standards which this Commission is to apply in
making its determinations are contained in those sections
of the bill which deﬁne “Communist political” and “Commu-
nist front” organizations.

Deﬁnitions

A Communist political organization is deﬁn-ed in Section
3(3) as an organization having some but not necessarily all,
of the ordinary and usual characteristics of a political party,
which is dominated or controlled by the (unnamed) foreign
government or foreign organization Which controls the World
Communist movement (found to exist in the preamble), and
which operated primarily to advance the objectives of that
movement as set forth in the preamble. .

A Communist front organization is deﬁned in Section
3(4) as an organization which is und-er the control of a Com-
munist political organization or is primarily operated for
the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist politi-
cal organization, a Communist foreign government, or the
World Communist movement. '

These general deﬁnitions are, however, to be applied
according t-o certain criteria prescribed by the bill.

Section 14 (e) of the bill requires the Commission, in
determining Whether any organization is a Communist politi-
cal organization, to take into consideraton eight factors.
These are:

(1) The extent to which its policies are formulated and
its activities performed pursuant to directives or to eﬁectuate
the policies of the foreign government or foreign organization
which controls the world Communist movement.

(2) The extent to which its views and policies do not
deviate from those of such foreign government or organiza-
tions.

(3) The extent to which it receives ﬁnancial or ‘other
aid, directly or indirectly, from or at the direction of such
foreign government or organization.

(4) The extent to which it sends members or representa-
tives to any foreign country for instruction in Communism.

(5) The extent to which it reports to the foreign gov-
ernment or organization.

(6) The extent to which its principal leaders or a sub-
stantial number of its members are subject to or recognize

 

 

the. disciplinary power of such foreign government or organi-
za 1011.

(7) The extent to which it fails to disclose, or resists
effort to obtain information as to its membership or other
records, its members refuse to acknowledge their member-
ship, its meetings are secret, and it otherwise operates on
a secret basis.

(8) The extent to which its principal leaders or a sub-
stantial number of its members consider the allegiance they
owe to the United States as sub-ordinate to their obligations
to such foreign government or foreign organization.

Section 14(f) of the bill establishes standards for the
Commission’s determination of Communist front organiza-
tions. The Commission is required to take into consideration
the following factors when determining whether an organiza-
tion is a Communist front.

(1) The identity of active members.

(2) The sources from which an important part of its
support, ﬁnancial or otherwise, is derived.

(3) The extent to which it uses its funds, resources, or
personnel to further political objectives of a Communist
political organization.

(4) The extent to which the position taken or advanced
by it from time to time on matters of policy does not deviate
from the position taken by any Communist political organiza-
tion.

Even a cursory analysis of the foregoing deﬁnitions
and criteria reveals that:

(1) The mere exercise of freedom of speech and assem-
bly or association can subject an organization to the bill's
penalties. Do its policies tend to effectuate the policies, how-
ever unobjectionable, of a foreign group? Are they the
same as or similar to the policies of the foreign group? Does
it s-end representatives abroad, perhaps to international con-
ferences in which Communists may take part, hence receiving
“instruction” from them or “reporting” to them? Does the
organization have Communists among its members who may
contribute their support, ﬁnancial or otherwise, to its Worthy
purposes, and thereby bring to it “indirectly” the support of
the “world Communist movement?” Do its members some-
times meet in private? Does the organization decline to
subject its members to blacklisting? Then it can be destroyed
under these criteria.

(2) Many of the terms used have no clear and deﬁnite
meaning. Some examples are: “some, but not necessarily

Q

 

  

6

all,” “dominated or controlled,” “the extent to which” (what
extent is to be deemed signiﬁcant?) , “other aid, . . . indirectly,”
“a substantial number,” “identity” of active members, “im-
portant” part of the organization’s support. There is no
indication that more than one of these criteria shall be found
to be applicable.

(3) The entire organization can be outlawed because
of the “identity” of some active members or leaders, or be-
cause a “substantial number of its members” (certainly this
can be a minority) are subject to the disciplinary power of
a foreign movement (the deﬁnitions in Section 2 say that all
Communists are in this category), or because some of its
members fail or refuse to acknowledge their membership.

(4) Though the organizations are to be branded as for-
eign agents seeking to establish a “totalitarian dictatorship”
in the United States, the tests for inﬂicting the brand are not
necessarily germane to such a ﬁnding. Indeed most of them
are wholly unrelated to foreign control or any object to estab-
lish any dictatorship.

The fact is that the deﬁnitions and criteria for both
“Communist political organizations” and “Communist front
organizations” are so vague and irrelevant to any purpose
or effort to establish a “totalitarian dictatorship” that the
Commission could require registration of almost any liberal
organization in its virtually unfettered discretion.

For example, the Progressive Party, which obtained more
than a million votes, in the last election, could readily be de-
termined to be a “Communist political organization” by these
tests. Because it disapproves of the Marshall Plan, the Tru-
man Doctrine, aid to Franco Spain, aid to Chiang Kai Shek,
compulsory military service, etc., the Commission could, if
it desired to do so, ﬁnd that its policies and activities effectu-
ate the policies” of Russia and that its “views and policies
do not “deviate” to a suﬁicient extent from those of Russia.
In addition, the Commission might ﬁnd that some of its
leaders and a “substantial number” of its members are _Com-
munists (and thus, by the ﬁndings” in section 2(5) and 2(9)
are persons who recognize the “disciplinary power” of Rus-
sian Communists or who owe Russia a “superior allegiance”).
Furthermore, the Progressive Party would undoubtedly re-
sist, for purposes of self-preservation, efforts to obtain infor-
mation as to its membership, and very likely some members
of that Party (like members of the Democratic or Republican
Party) often meet in closed, unpublicized (“secret”) meetings.

As for Communist fronts, these can include virtually all

 

 

7

labor unions and progressive organizations, because for ex-
ample, some of their active members who may also contribute
funds, are Communists or members of the Progressive Party
(already shown to be a likely candidate for designation as a
Communist political organization). They may take policy
positions which do not deviate from certain policies of the
Communist or Progressive Parties.

Penalties (Section 16)

Once there is in effect a ﬁnal Commission order requiring
an organization to register, severe penalties apply for failure
to register. The organization may be ﬁned not less than
$2,000 and not more than $5,000. The officers of the organi-
zation obliged to ﬁle the registration statement may be sim-
ilarly ﬁned or imprisoned from one to ﬁve years or both.
These penalties, severe enough in themselves, become astron-
omical because each day of failure to register constitutes a
separate offense. An individual who knowingly becomes or
remains a member of an organization which has been ordered
to register but has not done so may be ﬁned from $2,000 to
$5,000 or imprisoned from two to ﬁve years or both. Falsiﬁ-
cation of registration statements carries similar penalties.

Administrative Determinations and Court Review

We have shown that the condemnation of an organiza-

tion under the provisions of this bill is tantamount to destruc-

tion. Yet no more is required to effectuate this result than
the ﬁnding of a mere commission composed of political ap-
pointees. Thus the requirement of judicially competent
proof beyond a reasonable doubt before a Court of law and
an impartial jury, which is essential under our judicial sys-
tem for even the most innocuous misdemeanors, would be
avoided in cases involving thousands of individuals, perhaps
hundreds of organizations, and their fundamental civil liber-
ties. The avoidance of such proof, required under other ex-
isting legislation, may be the main purpose of this bill.

The fact that Court review is available for the Com-
mission’s ﬁndings does not mitigate the vices inherent in
the bill. If the standards are vague and improper for the
purpose of -administrative determinations, then the same
standards are vague and improper for the purpose of judicial
review. Furthermore, the Commission’s ﬁndings of fact are

-conclusive if supported by a preponderance of the evidence

(substantial evidence only under the Ferguson bill).
