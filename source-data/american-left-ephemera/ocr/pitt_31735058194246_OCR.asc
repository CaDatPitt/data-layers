- THE VAN NUY' UND

 

This has been a semester beset with
plagues-the Hong Kong flu has wracked
our bodies, and now, the insolent cry of
"Let me be myself!" is disrupting our
academic endeavors. A veritable on-
slaught of adolescent bolshevism has
threatened to decay the business—like
atmosphere of our school.

Instances of aarchy are evident
everywhere-Shakespeare is_interrupted by
saucy wenches in pants, and writers of
lesser genius have been completely out-
classed by a healthy set_of sideburns.
The conflagration caused by hair touching
collar has obliterated Eythagoras entire-
ly“-leaving his theorems untaught and he

basis of modern geometry lost to humanity.

The-serious "drop--out" problem has

§undeniably‘worsened because of the inabi-

lity of students to cope with the unre-
strained freedom which has been forced
upon them in school.

This upsurge of nonconformity must
be crushed! Failure to suppress this
apocalyptic trend may result in such un-
sufferable conitions as the questioning
of praises and. . .yes, even the advent
of the individual.

THE DRESS CODE-REVISITED

During the recent rainy season. may
VNHS girls took what appears to be a sen-
sible action: they came to school in
slacks.. Their reasons (warmth and com-
fort) are obvious, yet the school admini-
stration has stuck to its strict enforce-
ment of the dress code. Mrs. Marsman, in

V a printed circular, explained that school

is a business, and, accordingly, students
must be dressed in a "businesslike" fash-
ion.
ly has yet to realize that school is ggt
a professional business in the normed.

sense of the word. Its purpose is not

the manufacture of a multitude of commo-

'dities, but the development of individual

d g ELECTION 

The recent student body elections
revealed several shortcomings in our
school election procedures. Unless a.
changed, hese defects threaten to make a

farce and a colossal waste of time out of

student government.. Under the Present
system, school administrators and even
student body officers are permitted to
take steps to prevent the election of any
liberal student who might "rock the boat"
as an elected officer. .

The most flagrant recent example of
this was the censorship of a presiden-
tial campaign speech by Mr. Gunn, the
leadership sponsor, on the grouns that
it was too radical and revolutionary.
Hr. Gunn defended himself by insistin
that if he had approved the speech, it
would have been-censored by the school
administration, or, if its author (Gail
Campbell) had been allowed to deliver
the speech at the Nominations Assembly,

‘she would have been suspended. This may
be true, yet it does not excuse Mr. Gunn.
Neither he nor the school admnistration
should have the-right to regulate.or

zcensor a person's thoughts or expressioﬁ

of them. This policy makes it exceed-

ingry difficult for some candidates to

express their platforms to the student

body. (The Mirrcr statements are alsd

highly restricted: presidential_cani~

dates are limited to 50 words and-5 ac“
tivities in their statements.)

_ At the Nominations Assemhky-itself.
the student body saw another effort by
the school "establishment" to discﬁurage
"radical" canidates. Afie? @°?t3in
ppesidential candidates had called for
vast changes in our school student gov-
ernment, Dave Borelli. student body
president, made some c>mmonts to the au~
dience in direct refutatxun of these
speeches. He said that the present stu-
dent government system is excellent, and
does not need any changes. He referred
to those who advocate change as "inex-
perienced persons" having no familiarity
