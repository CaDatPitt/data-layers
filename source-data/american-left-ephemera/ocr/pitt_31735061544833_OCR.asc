THE YOUTH PEACE CORPS AND THE COLD WAR
by Michael Parker

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is not to examine all facets of the
proposed Youth Peace Corps, for another such paper with limited
study could be fruitless considering the number of studies
already available. Rather, this paper is an attempt to examine
the Peace Corps as it relates to the Cold War.
The Corps will be briefly described in the first part of this
paper for background information. IFor those who want a
detailed discussion, I recommend the study by Samuel P. Hayes
entitled International Youth Service ~ The Promise and Problems,
available from the Public Affairs Institute, 312 Pennsylvania
Avenue S.E., Washington 3, D.C.

Background

The idea of a Youth Peace Corps is not new. Proposals date back
to 1902. For many years, private agencies have carried out such
programs on a small scale. For the first time, however, govern-
ment action has been instituted to carry out such a program.

Fundamentally, the Youth Peace Corps will be composed of young
men and women willing to work in underdeveloped areas around
the world for little salary and for a period of two to three
years. There, they would be engaged in technical assistance,’
teaching, and other tasks which are needed in these areas. It
is assumed that both the participants and the receiving nations
would benefit by this people-to-people contact.

At this time, a temporary measure has been instituted by Presi-
dent Kennedy in setting up a Youth Peace Corps by Executive
Order. All aspects of this Corps are yet to be determined and
Congress will still have to pass a bill to make the Corps a
permanent measure.
