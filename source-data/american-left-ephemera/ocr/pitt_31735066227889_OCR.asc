 ' at the «outset that'I am not a pacifist in the sense that I am opposed--to " ’ 
 , ’—f.war.of any kind, or in favor of peace at any price. I recognize that _‘
 there are, or can be, just wars. The Catholic Church teaches that in the ‘
I‘'p',.5,,5affairs of individuals and nations circumstances may arise in',which,’a‘s. a.
 ,f_last resort, the use of -indvidual or collective force to meet unjust ag.-n 
‘  -“gression can be justified. But it also teaches that war, or the collective
' i use of force, in order to be justified, must (a‘) have a justcause, that‘
  there must be reasonable certitude that the good to be gained will _ V
4 .»,outweigh the evil entailed, and that _(c) the means or methods employed * 
‘ in waging the war must not be in themselves intrinsically evil.  
4, A _,“Many just causes are conceivable,” as Eric Gill points out in a book? 1 J k
'   -‘_ let; entitled, A Catholic Approach to the Problem of War, “but whether "V
any such are really the objects of wars today, we have no means of’_
ﬁjudging and only very good reason for doubting. In this matter we havef 
" ,‘ no reliableinformation andare at the mercy of politicans andnewspaper - , 
 .. owners who, whether they admit it or not, are spokesmen and instruments "  ',
. ’_ ‘of financial and commercial persons whose _real ambitions and purposes
 “  f are hidden.” "Certainly, the defense or promotion of Christianity‘ can never~."’ '
‘l ' .4 be, as some .people seem to think, a just cause for‘war’ under any cirz‘-q ‘
' Acumstances. Christ expresslyforbade that kind of defense or promotionyj
M When,He upbraided St. Pet§r_for using his sword in defense ‘of, Christ J": "V
_ "in the garden of Gethsemane, when He commanded His would-be/defender.‘

Modern warfare of the kind used in World War II, and which, we"

can be certain, will be used with more terrible effects and with greater

. frightfulness and havoc in World War III, is of such a nature that these
two important conditions cannot be fulfilled, and,_ therefore, World War ~ ‘

III, if it comes to pass, would be an unjust war in which no Christian
could conscientiously take any part. ’ f

In 1931 a group of European Catholic theologians met under sanction "._ .

of Pope Pius XI in Fribourg, Switzerland, to consider, among other mat-

‘ ters, the question of the morality of modern warfare._ The following is a

‘‘ passage from the decisions of this Theological Council:

. “Modern war, that is war such as it is conceived and practised today” I _- 
(that is, in 1931, before the blitzkrieg, total war and the atom bomb were

thought of ) “cannot be a legitimate procedure. For modern war by reason
of its technique and through a sort of necessity derived from its nature,

involves such great material, spiritual, individual, family, social and '

religious ruin and becomes as such a world calamity that it ceases to be
a means proportionate to the end which alone could justify the use of
force, namely, the establishment of a more humane order and peace.”

' That passage confirms my statement regarding the first condition.‘
It is self-evident that the second condition for a just war, the one

referring to methods, cannot be fulfilled in modernywarfare. Among the '

methods used are:
1. Deliberate, intentional propagation of hatred, and lying.
2. Deliberate, intentional killing, or murder of non-combatants:

Both of these methods are in direction violation of the commandments.
of God. The first one is also in direct violation of the “new command-

- ment” of Christ, the commandment of love to which I have referred al-

ready. It violates His command to love our enemies. It is, and so is the

second one, anti-Christian, contrary to everything that Christland Christ-
ianity stand for. As Christians, we must go on record as refusing to*ap- ,
prove of the use of such methods, and as serving notice on the powers '

that be that we will take no part ‘in any war in which these methods

are used. We must take this stand or cease to call ourselves Christians. ‘

The issue is clear and inescapable. The time has come for us to “obey .
Godrather than men” no matter what the ‘consequences may be for us. "

We can and should make it clear that we will obey the civil ‘authority in

all things in which it has the right to demand our obedience, that we,
will defend our country and our fellow citizens from unjust aggression

when necessary, that we will dojour part in helping our own and other
nations to enforce justice and peace in any part of the world through the

medium of a properly constituted international organization, _ but that 

we will not violate the laws of God under. any pretext whatsoever. “It

is a high crime indeed,” wrote Pope Leo XIII, in 1890, in his Encyclical, v   _
Christian Wisdom, “to withdraw allegiance from God in order to please - '

 

men,,an-act of consummate wickedness to break the laws of Jesus Christ  

in order to yield obedience to earthly rulers.” .

We must demand, too, a drastic revision of the Marshall -Plan which,  — 
under the pretext of helping Europe is, in fact, demoralizing and enslav- . p _' 5, ‘
ing it, making it an economic vassal of the U. S. A. and, in many cases,’  i "_ 
encouraging the people of Europe to depend notion themselves, or on their
own efforts, but upon the people of the U.S.A.. It maintains injustices
in and, as well as preparing for World War III, disrupts the economies _
of most European countries to the advantage of ‘U. S. financial interests.
It must be completely revised so that real benefit may result from itnot r '  :
only to the people of Europe but to the over-taxed people of the U.S.A., l  
who have to foot‘ the bill for; the enormous cost of this selfishly conceived, ' 1   ‘
ineffective and squandering scheme thought up to bolster an unjust V I —
economic system which is responsible for the ills that the Marshall Plan)’ ‘. 
pretends to cure. . ~ ' I '
= ,The people of Europe need help, but it must be given constructively 
and through disinterested channels. It must be given to relieve immediate «I T 
' distress, hunger, cold, disease, etc., but it must also be given to enable
_ Europeans who are able to work to become self-reliant and self-support-
"ping," and to put the economies of the various European countries on the,
same kind of a basis. ' - H . ’

* Europe’s main trouble has been, and still is, over-population. 'Any
plan dealing with European aid must take cognizance of this, fact and 
endeavor to relieve it by moving, or aiding in the movement of European
emigrants, especially those with farming vocation and skills, to less con-’.
gested and underpopulated parts of the world, including the United

' States, to the settlement of many of these emigrants on what will be
‘eventually their own farms in the United States, and to the absorption
of" as manysuitable emigrant industrial workers as the U. S. economy-
will stand. Incidentally, the increased .number of rural workers“ future

- farm and home owners rather than paid and exploited farm hands, will

a and must create‘ a demand for manufactured goods and services which=

, it will not only maintain but increase employment in the cities of the

 l United States. ' l . V .

‘ iAmerican Labor has nothing to fear but much to hope for from an_ , V

i . intelligent and just settlement of European emigrants with farming skill‘  'r

on the land of the United'States. It should, therefore, in its own interests, ‘ '
and in the interests of the people of America and Europe, hasten to sup-”

function without the aid it receives from Britain. 

But Britain is 11ot wholly responsible for the continued exis ence of
partition which could be ended very soon if the workers, the small 'armers
and ..industrial and other employees, North and South, got together,
recognized their common enemies that exploit them and their religious

' . __prejudices for their own selfish ends, and united and cooperated in a I

Peoples’ Party for aprogram of political, social and economic justice for
all the people of Ireland, a program similar to the one which I have al-
ready outlined in a general way. i 1

Irish Federal Republic

I am sure the working people of Britain in these circumstances, and

insympathy with their Irish brethren, would do their part by demanding

that their government quit Ireland completely and permit the Irish
people, North and South, to solve their own problems in a spirit of

Christian charity———much needed in Ireland—and on the basis of an au-.
> Vtonomousprovince of Ulster (with its nine counties) in an Irish Federal’ V
Republic which will guarantee to all its .citiz_ens religious freedom and

political, social and economic justice.

The first move for the abolition of partition and the unity of Ireland ‘ ‘

must come from» the plain, common people,'the workers of Ireland in the

‘North and in the South, but in order to encourage them, and to bring the
Ihatter effectively to the attention of those concerned, including the gov-_

ernment of the United States which is pro\‘riding"Marshall Plan funds
to Britain, that are used, in part, to perpetuate partition in Ireland, I
suggest ‘that the workers of the United States, or at least those of Irish
origin and as many others as they can enlist, organize and observe a /one

day strike and repeat it if necessary. The part played by the Marshall _

Plan funds in the perpetuation of _partition is something of which most
Americans are not aware. It could be brought vividly to their attention
during such a strike. ' ‘S

v This suggestion is made _with the sole intention of utilizing the ,best~d;e

peaceful means to end a hate-breeding and unjust situation, and to pro-

 . mote the best interests of the British and Irish peoples who should, and I_
hope will, live in close bonds of .,friendship and cooperation. A united’

Ireland would be a friend of Britain, not a thorn in its side as it is at

present, and as it will continue to be as long as Britain is responsible ..
for the continuance of Irish partition and stands in the way of Irish-

unity and complete Irish freedom.

I have tried to outline for you a program or. course of conduct that is
intended to result in justice, freedom and peace for an unsettled world

duct’ is Christian charity, the “new commandment” of love announced

, by Christ, a commandment which is the very foundation of Christianity
. so'farvery much ignored in human, national and international ‘relation- ‘

ships. It is high time to’ give it a chance’to function and proveits efficacy.
It may be urged_by war mongers and the war-minded, as well as by

.__business and commercial interests, that the observance of that com- ‘

mandment is not, or-will not be, enough to hold aggressionin‘ check

 PROPOSALS FOR A DEMOCRATIC  

VI ,

(The following proposals, with the exception of some recent additions
and revisions, originally appeared in the March, 1948 issue of The Libera-
tor, a monthly edited and published by the author in 1947-48. Formulated
by the author, they are largely a resume of ideas advocated by him in .

vi The Liberator-—now defunct—and include recommendations from other
A democratic and progressive sources.

They propose economic, social and political justice for everyone in the —. ’ l 

United States, and, in a final section dealing with Defense and Foreign

Policy, make recommendations which their author believes to be abso- , ' '

‘ lutely necessary for world peace secured and maintained within the

framework of an International Organization composed of all nations of
the world, each maintaining its independence and sovereignty in domestic ’
or national affairs while cooperating with others in matters of mutual

‘interest, and all being subject in matters of international concern ‘to the

just, democratic decisions of a justly constituted Internationa1—-or United

N ations-—-Organization.) '

’ T v THE ROAD  PEACE  V e
(Speech delivered by the author in the Central Opera House, New York  

- . ‘ City, May 14, 1949, at the CONFERENCE ON PEACE AND POLITICAL
' ACTION called by the National «Division of the American Labor Party.)

 

4 A National Assize for Peace7and- Liberty was held in Paris in No- 4_ .
Avember, 1948} Its last session was presided over by Abbe Jean Boulier,
a Catholic priest and professor of International Law, who sp’oke‘in"part
asfollows: ,
“But how is a preacher who wishes to be faithful to his universal
_ emission not ,_to hear the enormous cry which comes from the heart of the
_'CI‘0WdS, the voice of God, the divine spark which comes from the depths
of their souls, and is he not to receive with respect this magnificent ’ ’
, desire which you demonstrate, you, delegates from all our provinces and
from all parties-—this desire for freedom and justice, to defend liberty
and secure peace? I /
“I am here to respond to your appeal and to say to you, ‘Courage,
comrades.’ If we are brave, if we are just and understanding, if we are _.
, , V wise we may be sure that many Christians will join us . . . ,
,~ “We know well from whence we came, where we go and with who
we travel. ~ ' \ _ A
‘ “We came from the Resistance. On this road of a regrouped Resist- A 1. j
ance which all France inust tread, we must know whom we shall meet. 
A ainst us the men of Vichy, but at our side the Communists ‘.  A '_ ’
-It “It is quite ‘obvious that I am not a Communist. but in the Resistance
I washbound to have to work anonymously and clandestinely with the A
. Communists. I have never been ashamed of that. * e r
’ “Today on our road to free France, to found a new republic, to build 
, peace, we come to the ﬁrst obstacle, to this anti-Communism,,an.e3;y—
tio1§}l,__,rea’(_:j;_ion, which {forbids us to shake hands  our old fighting,“
comrades. I say thisis mean and stupid. Becauseiwhen an action is just, 
A when it is practicable and reasonable, it is the contempt of all justice
and reason that you should abandon it because your alleged adversaries
join withyou. I say that that is the rejection of the Christianideal.
e Was it not St. Paul who told us that in the face of the adversary we were
- ' I not to "rejoice in our faults, but that we ought. to rejoice in all that was ""i ,
good?” * "
The Abbe then spoke of getting the support of the unions, or organized
’ workers and “other groups of Frenchmen, in this case not grouped ac- ‘ "
cording to material interests, but on belief and .for a religious ideal,.the '
‘ Church. In the Protestant Churches,” he continued, “the individual cons- ,
_ cience has more initiative; therefore it should be easy for us to appeal to ‘-  pi:
,- 1 I i their conscience and to obtain from each, one by one, the support they ' » 
 _ ’ A have already given, in the Resistance, to ‘Temoignage Chretien.’ »
" i “As for the Catholic Church, let me speak to you tonight quite frankly , V
I  and truthfully; it is ‘a large body and -I shall not surprise anyone here,  
:« _ “by saying that it is a biginternational. Like all internationals it has its _ 
’ ’ I ‘discipline; it is anxious toikeep its cohesion and its unity. That is why

, Four. months later, on March 21, 1949, the press of the United States  :3
carried the following United P1'ess release from Paris: . ’ 2 I 
 “The U. S. Embassy refused today to grant visas to three leftist French’-_

 Stassen,Vwho took the program place of President Truman, heat the " _ H

would mean the end of civilization.

The theme of his speech which followed Winston Churchill’s' in what,   

 fwas described in the‘ press as “a great symposium of human and scientific,   

 progress” was substantially as follows:

V and end upon this queston of a third world war. Such thinking

 be unfettered. Terrible devastation and destruction and suffering "
p -I can be administered in a future war, but, in my judgment, man _

V, "never wipe out entirely through the world that curious com-_

P" A  Jr“! for the Presidency. of the United States,.was endeavoring to sell to the 
5. American people the proposition that they. could do “business” with Stalin,” s
I and that capitalism could co-exist and flourishywith that same Com-‘ 
-' munism whichhe now finds such a threat. Since then neither Stalin .'
‘nor Communism have changed in any respect but wor1d' conditions have . A
_changed in a manner that is alarming and threatening both to capitalism. | ‘
and the “business” interests whose God is money and whose morality is
conditioned by the latter. . . = - i -
_. . Now let us see how Mr. Stassen, the standard bearer of freedom,
  proposesto meet and destroy this Communist menace to freedom and:
" ‘ freemen. A —  V .
 f  “We should,” he says, “move and move promptly to bolster the south-' . L _
’ ‘ g ern half of China.” . "P
' In the northern part of China, the people have come into their own __
after centuries of oppression and exploitation at the hands of the feudal.’ 
mandarin, landlord class’ and, later, at the hands of European and ’Am-,; A
erican leeches. At last they own and can use the land which God ‘made _ ’.
for their use and needs. The exploiters have moved south, or in some A
_ . cases, east, and now Mr. Stassen, the protagonist of freedom, is advocat-
Ig ing that the United States save one of the foulest economic and political A '
systems in the world for the benefit of the native and foreign, British
 and U. S. bloodsuckers and exploiters of the Chinese people.
 V‘? A _ ‘ The,Marshall Plan ' . A.
 . Mr. Stassen called for a MacArthur Plan in Asia patterned after the  ‘ '
Marshall Plan in Europe which he described as the “most significant
. single thing we havedone since the, end of the war.” To date the Marshall ‘
Plan in Europe has provided Europeans with plenty of U. S. cigarettes,
.U.‘ S. processed or packed coffee, U. S. powdered milk, U. S. chemically‘
ybleaohedwhite flour, U. S. canned foods preserved with chemicals, ,U. S. _ V
products of various kinds that are, like the aforementioned things,
harmful to the health of thehuman being or to the soil from which he‘ _‘ ,
"should get his food, and U. S. heavy machinery that disrupts the small
‘farm economy of most European countries and that will eventually pau-
V ’perize them, overworkand destroy their soil and its fertility. _ _
1.’ . It has filled the pockets of the American interests that provide all A
P these European “needs” that are paid for by the’ overtaxed people of the
United States who are fooled by the money grubbers into believing that,', A
in supporting the Marshall Plan, they are performing one of the great ; 
Christian corporal works of mercy. . A  i  A A ,
It has, of course, provided Americans with employment and thus, 
in conjunction with the huge rearmament program, staved off for the ’l. i 
time being an otherwisebinevitable depression. For that reason it is sup- i 
_, S , ported by labor leaders who care very little what happens to Europe
  4 as long as union dues-paying members are kept contented in the cities
' ’ : as earning wage slaves under an unjust and un-Christian economic sys-H 
1 -tem that has‘ deprived and dispossessed them of their God-given birth- ..

Christian selfishness, greed and exploitation.
The war to save laissez-faire‘capitalism may, in spite of Mr. Stassen’s
"judgment, be the end not only of this un-Christian civilization, but of the
world. Against Mr. Stassen’s private judgment regarding the outcome
of the next war and man’s inability to fashion the means of destroying ’ 
V all men, we, and especially the war mongers,- would do well to read ’  ‘

3 of international repute. A
No Peace Without Justice
-If the people of the ‘United States and of Western Europe gboldly
assert themselves and demand action for peace from their bankrupt war-
minded leaders, insist upon economic justice and personal and national
— freedom for all people everywhere, and take means to implement their
demands, there will be no World War III. There will be no World War III
if all the armies of occupation in all parts of Europe and Asia retire” to
the political and _ethnical boundaries of their own nations, and if the
- governments of the United States, of Russia, Britain and France agree '
to desist from all kinds of meddling in the affairs of other countries. A A » gji.
The retirement of the armies of occupation, the interim governments  :5‘-'
that take their place, the revision of national boundaries and the agree- ‘
. ment of non-interference, as well as the setting up of the proper kind of 
' international machinery for. the enforcement of justice and preservation
V ,’ 5 ; of peace, are and /must be a matter for a Peace Conference. There can
A  ~ be no Peace Conference without Russian representatives with Whom "
the representatives of other countries must talk in order to discuss the
V,‘ terms of peace. People who say they want peace and at the same time, ~
‘ . like temperamental prima donnas, refuse to talk or negotiate with Rus- .
-sian representatives, or who, while going through the motions of “peace”

talks with the latter, are at the same time talkingof and preparing for * . 

war, are either liars or; incompetents who ‘should not be entrusted with

public office. _ . . j ‘

\ THE , “NEW COMMANDMENT” A
(Speech delivered by the author in the Swiss/Hall, Bronx, New York

City, September 16, 1949, at a meeting sponsored by the Progressive
Irish Association*).

For many reasons I think that I should begin by telling you who I
am -and why I am here. I am a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. I

' am a United States citizen by birth. I was raisedin Ireland and was

educated partly in Irelandand partly in Spain in the Irish College, Sala-
manca. ' ‘ -

After my ordination I spent several years in England and some years .

in Oregon before receiving an appointment in my own diocese of Kilmore,
Ireland, in 1934. In a parish in that diocese I endeavored to have ap-

, plied the teachings of Christ regarding the basic Christian virtue of

charity and, in so far as they were applicable, the Papal Encyclicals of
Leo XIII and Pius XI. Because of the opposition which I encountered,
I returned to the United States in 1937. With the exception of-"the time

spent in three visits to Ireland, I have been in the United States, since .

then. I am here with the written permission of my Bishop. I am -a priest.

in good standing and I intend, with the help of God, to retain that good
.standing. '

I am here to publicize and promote, as far as
teachings that I believe in, that I learned from the New Testament,
that ‘I was- taught in more detail by approved Catholic teachers, and

thatVI was commissioned as a priest to make known to others. Chief .
among those teachings is the command of the practice of Christiani

charity announced by Christ, Himself: “Thou' shalt love ‘the Lord,‘ thy

God, with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole

I can, the Christians

\

mind. This is the first and the greatest commandment. And the second is I

like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two com-
mandments depend the .whole law and the prophets.” ' .
' “Love Your Enemies”

I am here to remind those who care to hear that according to the 9 ‘
