Clark Presenfs Testimony on
UC, Minimum Pay Measures

WASHINGTON, D.,C.—Anti-recession measures on unemployment benefits and
minimum wages received the backing of Mine-Mill last month in statements presented
by President John Clark to two House committees which held hearings on the Ad-

ministration-proposed bills.

Support for legislation providing emergency extension of aid to jobless workers

and their dependent chil-

dren, and raising the mini-

mum wage to $1.25 was ex- -
pressed by Clark as part of the »
' Union’s program laid before-

the Ways and Means and La-
bor committees. At the same
time, he stressed that the bills
fell short of- fully supplying
the shot-in-the-arm needed for
quick economic recovery.

The Mine-Mill leader, par-
ticularly calling attention to

' unemployment resulting from

the metals crisis, told the Ways
and Means committee that the
non-ferrous industry has never
completely recovered from its
1958 depression.
* =l4 * \

MANY workers have ex-
hausted their jobless benefits,
he said. .

Citing places most heavily
hit by layoffs and short weeks,
he pointed to the classification
of such Connecticut brass cen-
ters as Torrington, Ansonia,
Waterbury and Bridgeport as
“areas of substantial” unem-
ployment. Other brass centers
recently added to the list, he
‘said, are Buffalo, Los Angeles
and St. Louis.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

   

»Vice-President:

All of Labor Hurt by

  Wasteful Steel Raids

M EADERS of the Steelworkers union have never told
their membership the real story of 12 years of wasted

and disruptive raiding against the Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers Union. Our membership is well acquainted with

this sordid 12-year history of Steel's attempts to plunder

in the mining and smelting industry in the
United States and Canada.
iPresident David McDonald and his fel-

offices in the Commonwealth Bldg. in Pitts-
burg. And, Steel members have great dif-
ficulty getting any facts about this 12-year
raiding effort from Steel leaders. .

Several simple questions should be put
to these Steel officials by the men who work
in the Steel industry. These questions are:

1. Why don't Steel Union leaders tell «
their own members that they are once again .
diverting several hundred thousand dollars in a stupid, wasteful
and disruptive raid against Mine-Mill?

2. How canthese officials justify_this tremendous waste
of their members’ dues money at a time when 200,000 Steel-
workers are unemployed and thousands more on short time?

Skinner

**‘k

Why don’t Steel “leaders give their membership an ac- .

; counting of the estimated 4 million dollars in dues
money squandered in the past 12 years in unsuccessful raids

against Mine-Mill in the United States and Canada?

4. VVhat possible benefit have these wasteful raids brought
to members of the Steel workers union?

5. Have workers in the metal mining industry benefited
in any way from this 12 years of time,_ money and-effort spent
defending our union against these cannibals of American labor?

6. Wouldn’t all working people benefit if this time, money
and effort were used to fight for full employment, Job security,
improved legislation on industrial health, retirement benefits,

unemployment and social insurance‘?

‘k*‘k

HE simple truth is that no union can divert its money and

effort for 12 years raiding the jurisdiction of another trade
union without destructive results to its own members and to the
trade union_ movement. Steel leaders cannot forever pose as
labor statesmen to the public and their own membership, while
they._operate as unprincipled bandits in every mining camp and
smelter town in the United States and Canada.

It was in 1949 that Phil Murray (former Steel president)
engineered the expulsion of Mine-Mill from the CIO and as
Chairman, at the same Board meeting, demanded the transfer
of our jurisdiction to his own union—the United Steelworkers.
For these past 12 years Steel" leaders have squandered over 4
million dollars of their union’s money and forced Mine-Mill local
unions to defend themselves in ahnost 100 labor board elections.

Some Mine-Mill locals have been raided five and six times.
With few exceptions the Steel bandits have been defeated time
after time in the important sections of our industry in the United
States and Can~ada—-but do you think the rank and file members
of Steel know this story? They certainly don’t!

‘k‘k*

' ITH a lot of fanfare, publicity and a “non-ferrous” confer-
ence in Salt Lake City last summer, Steel leaders launched
another series of raids (this is about the 5th or 6th series). Of
course they didn’t call it raiding—they called it “uniting the
workers in the non-ferrous metals industry.”

These Steel leaders have never explained how you can unite
working people by dividing them. ' ‘

But maybe it works like cattle rustling in the old west.’ If
the gang of rustlers did enough rustling over a long period and
didn’t get caught and hung, they would eventually accumulate
one big herd united under a new brand. So the Steel rustlers
are at it again.

‘A''* ‘k

ANY months ago they established new offices in Bayard,
» N. M.; Magna, Utah; Anaconda, Montana; Sudbury, On-
tario, and Baltimore, Maryland. They’ve had cowhands charging
around the country trying to corral Mine-Mill leaders and offer-
ing big money to anyone in Mine-Mill who would join the gang
and help them rustle. As a matter of fact the chief rustler in
charge of deals and payoffs is a former official of Mine-Mill.

This big operation was supposed to come to a head about the
time of the spring roundup with stampedes going on all over
the west. But things don't lookso good this year. The corrals
are empty, it has been tough hiring rustlers, the gang members
are fussing and feuding and there’s no sign of a stampede any
place.

. Yes, it looks like Steel just can’t get this one off the ground,

Despite scores of Well-paid organizers and plenty of “payola,”
they’re having a tough timegetting any converts. ‘ This is a real

tribute to the devotion_ and solid trade union principles of thou-
 sands of -ll/line,-Mill-members, stewards and local V officers in .
‘ scores, of locals where, Steel agents .,have been tr_y.ing,to_j;get

raidsoff.;-theggrouhd:-eA._eC...sKINNER;-- 2

THE MINE-MILL UNION

District 6 Co

NEVV ' YORK, N. Y.-Sixty-
four delegates representing al-

' most every Mine-Mill plant in

five eastern states were on

- hand at the Park Sheraton Ho-

tel here Feb. 11 and 12 to par-
ticipate in the District 6 lead-
ership conference.

Held as industry conditions
continued to deteriorate, the
conference occupied itself
mainly with problems of cut-
backs as well as related effects
on the job, and planned legis-
lative and political action to
relieve the’ situation.

The ‘meeting was opened

/_ \with reports from some 18 lo-

»

\‘”’“‘ ty. ,
_ George Otlowski.

   
 

cal unions represented. Prac-
tically without exception, each
report reflected the same pic-
ture—increasing layoffs and
reduced work week. ’
ilt * =14

HIGHLIGHT of the two-day
session was a detailed analy-
sis of the non-ferrous metals
industry crisis by the union's
Research Director, Bernard W.
.. tern.

Supplementing his report
with a series of charts, Stern
reviewed the situation in _the
industry with particular em-
phasis on the problems posed
for brass workers by the gen-
eral ‘economic recession and
heavy imports from foreign
countries. He also pointed up
the need for stimulation of
economic recovery through
measures proposed in the
Mine-Mill legislative program.

International President John
Clark, Secretary-Treasurer Irv-
ing Dichter and Vice-President
Asbury Howard reported on
problems confronting the un-
ion and discussed the program
developed at the January ex-
ecutive Board meeting. Gener-
al Council. Nathan Witt re-
viewed the status of present
cases involving the union.-

DISTRICT 6 LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE hears Mine-Mill President John
Clark, right, report on problems confronting the union and program
for the industry adopted by International Executive Board. Attending
meeting at Park Sheraton Hotel in New York city Feb. II and T2 were

in each area. In this connec-
tion, also, it was decided that
with the re-opening of the un-
ion’s Washington office, the re-
sponsibility for lobbying and
legislative p r e s s u r e would
have to be assumed to a great
extent by the locals in the
East.

Connecticut delegates agreed
that conditions in the “Brass
Va1ley,” marked by ABC lay-
offs in Ansonia and depart-
ment shutdowns in Torrington
heightened the need for in-
creased political activity in the
state capitol at Hartford and
visits with congressmen.

The conference received mes-
sages from Cong. John Mono-
gan of Connecticut's 5th Dis-
trict and Cong. Adam Clayton
Powell, Chairman of the House
Labor Committee.

A telegram to President
Kennedy calling for the guar-
antee of civil rights by Execu-
tive order was voted unani-
mously by the delegates.

ilt II! II!

MANY EXPRESSIONS of
support were voiced in a gen-
eral discussion on the need for
achieving greater financial sta-
bility of the union through in-
creased per capita.

Locals represented showed

* sylvania;

more delegates attending than
in previous years’ conferences.
They came from New Jersey,
New York, Connecticut, Mary-

land and Pennsylvania. Pres-_

ent were delegates from the
Connecticut brass locals in An-
sonia, Torrington, Thomaston
and Stamford, and from Buf-
falo, N. Y.; the copper smel-
ters and refineries in Perth
Amboy and Carteret, N. J.,
and Baltimore, Md.; diecasting
shops in Connecticut.-and Penn-
secondary smelters
in New York and New Jersey;

and various plastics and detin- -

ning plants in New Jersey.

Staff members in attend-
ance were Michael Gazy, Joe
Scioli, Edward Coleman, Hor-
ace White and Angelo DeStef-
ano.

. Mine-Mill President, John Clark was featured speaker among several who ad-

About This Article . . .

For close to a year our membership has been
discussing the need for a per capita increase to sus-
tain the increased costs of operating our Union. The
delegates to our 1960 Convention overwhelmingly
went on record in support of such a per capita
increase but asked that a vote on the ..
matter be referred to our ’61 Convention.
They felt time was needed to acquaint
all of our members with the needs of the
Union and thereby secure general ac-

- ceptance of a per capita increase.

Our ’61 Convention is at hand and
the matter will soon be before the dele-
gates and rank and file members of our
Union. They will have to make the deci-

' _
  iTS YOUR UNION

INE-MILL is now sixty-eight years old—one of the
oldest trade unions active on the American scene
today. The democratic traditions and practices estab-
lished in the early days of Mine-Mill have been maintained
throughout its long history. It is one of the sources of

the Union’s strength today.
It is in keeping with this
democratic tradition that our
Union Constitution provides
that the membership alone
shall have ultimate’ responsi-
bility for making all impor-
tant decisions affecting the
welfare of the Union.

One of the problems we face,
together with many other
Unions in this country, is.how
to cope with the rising costs
of operating our Union and
how to place ourselves on the
soundest footing to advance
the interests of our member-
ship in the coming period
ahead.

A Our 1960 Convention una.ni-

mously recognized the neces-_

sity for coping with this ques-
tion. The delegates, therefore,
voted to place an increase in
per capita foremost on the
agenda at our coming Conven-

«tion in Tucson.

A recent editorial in the
AFL-CIO NEWS, commenting
on the center of discussion at
Union Conventions held last
year, stated: “There is . . . a
general pattern of broader fi-
nancial support of Unions in
their constantly expanding
functions. . . . In short, pro-

grams are being laid down,
and money to finance the pro-
grams is being voted.”

To Push Ahead

Union Conventions voting

- per capita increases or setting

up increased strike funds to
be financed from dues and as-
sessments this past year in-
cluded the Meatcutters, Tex-
tile Workers, Amalgamated
Clothing Workers, Printing
Pressmen, Chemical Workers,
Machinists, International Elec-
trical Workers, and others.

The Meatcutters acted be-
cause of the “anti-union atmos-
phere throughout the nation.”
The Textile Workers voted a

$1 a month dues hike to repel
employer assaults after the
conviction of Textile Union
leaders on conspiracy charges
in the Henderson, North, Car-
olina, strike. The Amalgamat-
ed Clothing Workers voted an
increase to strengthen the In-
ternational and expand organi-
zational activities. The Press-
men, IUE, Machinists, and
others planned bigger strike
funds. :

Mine-Mill finds itself in the
same boat as the rest of the
American labor movement. It
faces the vital challenge of
building up its strength—and
adequate financing is the
sinew, bone, and marrow of

bargaining strength—to push

ahead in the 1960’s to broaden
the gains of the past years
and nail down the job security
of its "members.

Your Wage Gums
Let’s take a look at the
gains our Union has won for
its members since the end of
World War II when govern-
ment controls were lifted, and
the Union was free again to
bargain for pay and working
conditions and the health and
welfare of its members.

The typical Mine-Mill mem-
ber, since the end of World

‘War II, has had 15 wage in-

creases totaling over $1.50 an
hour, PLUS pensions, health
and welfare benefits, and
many other fringe benefits.

These gains didn’t come on
a silver platter. They had to
be bargained for and won
from the companies which
knew from years of experi-
ence with a tough, strong Un-
ion what they risked by fail-
ing to come to terms.

The wage gains alone since
the end of Vilorld War II have
more than doubled average
hourly earnings, which were
less than $1.00 per hour at the
beginning of 1946.

Listed below by way of il-
1 u s t r a ti o n are across-the-
board pay hikes won by Mine-
Mill for members at Kenne-
cott’s Utah Division since
1946. This listing does not in-‘

A Strong Union ,

It has taken a strong and
yigorous Union to make and
hold this record of progress
over the last 15 years. Our
members, over these years,
have demonstrated time and
again that they‘ wholehearted-
ly agreed with the proposition
that a strong treasury makes
a strong Union.

ning our Union has moved up-

 Board will propose that 250

For the 1960’s, Mine-Mill

will have three key financial

. goals—

1. To build up a $500,000
strike‘ fund;

,2. To build up a $500,000
contingency r e s e r v e in
our Union’s general fund;

3. To provide for an in-
crease in our present rate
of general fund outlays.

Your Executive Board en-

. visions an increase in general

fund expenditures for organi-
zational activity at new prop-
erties, servicing of local un-
ions, expanded educational ac-
tivities, legislative work in
Washington and other essen-
tial purpos_es-.

The increased per capita
would also be used to build a
reserve in the general fund for
contingencies. This would be
used to meet special situations
that are always cropping ‘up-

_ new organizational needs over

and beyond the capacity of
our regular budget, special

drives on legislation, raids——or
any one -of a dozen other
needs.

 

Sfrike Fund ,

We need to build up a siz-
able Strike Fund. A healthy
Strike Fund will be the best
possible form of strike insur-
ance we can have. The compa-
nies will be less eager to stall,
less likely to put two-bit offers
on the table, if theyknow we
have a real strike kitty to
draw on if things get rough.

If we have an adequate
Strike .. Fund built up, are
chances are better that we

don’t have to go out on strike,

How Your Per Capita ls Spent

ill-lE CHART ABOVE shows where the Union’s expenditures go, based on operations during the first half of

M59. Over three-fifths of the Union’s general fund expenditures (61 °/.) went right back into our dis-

tlricrlls, where they were used to pay the costsof grievance handling, negotiations, "servicing of locals, new'‘:;'

organization, legislative and community service work. Just under one-sixth of the Union’s general fund out-

lays (l6°/cl was. required for running the national office, including salaries and expenses of officers, book

keeping department, mailing room, and related outlays for telephone and telegraph, transportation and

mileage, insurance, and taxes.

Other items of expense cover vitally important special functions, but are

relatively minor in relation to district and national office expenditures. These include Press and Education

(including the cost of printing and mailing the Mine-Mill _Union), Research, Legislative (our Washington
office), Legal (not including local attorneys’ fees), general administrative expenditures, and the Interna-

tional Strike Fund (this is the five cents now being sets-aside each month from each member’s per capita

payment). ‘the share of the expenditure dollar for each of these purposes is shown on the chart.

at all to get fair and reason-
able settlements. .

The companies always look
at the size of our Strike Fund
when they test our bargaining
strength. They’ve frequently
miscalculated our ability
to support our members on
strike. ~ .

Actually, since the start of
the [NCO strike a little over
2 years ago, nearly $2 million
has gone out in relief to strik-
ing Mine-Mill members. Only
a small part of this total has
come from‘ our inadequate In-
ternational Strike Fund, built
up from 5c per month per
capita contributions.

The rest has come from the
International general f u n d,
from assessments, from loans,
from plant-gate collections, do-
nations from non-strikin g
Mine-Mill locals, from local
strike funds, and other funds,
and from contributions from
other unions and the public;
But we can not continually
draw on the good will of our
friends without demonstrating
a readiness to build up our
own Strike Funds.

What will it cost to beef up
Mine-Mill for the vital time

outlined above would increase
your present per capita dues
by less than one-half cent per
hour on the job. -
The chart (see chart, bottom

you have been paying have

Hard-hit-ting Union

We don’t reach our goals
just by sitting back. It takes a
hard-hitting organization ~— a
strong organization — one that
will command a healthy re-
spect at the bargaining table
and one that is listened to in
Congress——i_s recognized as a
decisive factor in the political
life of the many communities

ship lives.

Spurred by business depres-
sion in the U.S. and rising im-
ports which take an ever-in-
creasing share of the shrink-
ing domestic market, two U.S.
unions recently have an-_
nounced direct action pro-
grams to preserve union mem-
bers? jobs.

The Amalgamated Clothing
Workers is asking Union tai-
-lors to stop cutting Japanese
fabrics received by manufac-
turers after’ May 1.- By this
move the union hopes to bring
pressure on the Japanese to
reduce shipments of finished
garments to this country.

President Jacob Potofsky of
the 385,000-member strong
clothing workers said the step
was taken to protect working
standards from being under-
mined by Japanese workers
paid 14 cents an hour.

The big Chicago local of the
International Brotherhood of
Electrical‘ Workers has served
notice that after May 1 its
members will refuse to work
with Japanese electronic parts.
The local, now 23,000 strong,
has lost 9,000 members in re-
cent months.

Most of this loss of jobs is
blamed on imports of Japanese
electronic e q u i p m e n t. $66.5
million worth of electrical and
electronic e q u i p m e n t was
shipped by Japan to the U.S.
in the first 9 months of 1960—
an increase of more than 50%
above the corresponding 9
months of 1959. '

Braden Wildcaf

1,000 miners at Kennecott’s
Braden mine in Chile pulled a
wildcat strike in mid-Febru-
ary. At issue was an old de-
mand, always -rejected by the
company, for approximately
an hour’s overtime pay for
time spent, each day by the
miners in riding a company
train from the mine’s front
gate to the head of the »mine
shaft.

Union members voted to end
the strike after two days. It
was not announced Whether
negotiations would be contin-
ued with the company on this
issue.

African Unrest

Continued unrest in three
copper-important African areas
has created enough uncertain-
ty over continued production
to firm up the price of copper
in European markets in recent
weeks. , »

British government efforts
to broaden the participation of
Negroes in the economic and
political life of the Rhodesias
has brought threats of strikes
by unions of Rhodesian white
railway and copper mine work-
ers.

In mid-February, riots be-
tween Portuguese and Afri-
cans broke out in the 500-year
old Portuguese colony of An-
gola. The riots followed the
seizure of the Portuguese
cruise ship Santa Maria by op-
ponents of Portuguese dicta-
tor Salazar, including a former
Angolan government official
who_adVocates freeing of An-
gola and other Portuguese Af-
rican possessions.

All copper produced in the
Congo and in Rhodesia moves
by rail to the sea through the
Portuguese possessions, An-
gola or Mozambique.

circumstances of the Congo- _

INDUSTRY NOTES

BRIGHT SPOT in the 1961 copper outlook may be  V.

Soviet Russian purchases of the red metal from non-communist.

 

countries. In recent years the Soviets have had to purchase as ‘ ' 0

much as 150,000 tons of copper per year abroad, in order to make
up for shortcomings in Russian mine production. ‘

This year, 1961, Soviet "electrical generating capacity  1
scheduled to increase by 97,800,000 kilowatts, and work is to begin '

on power stations with additional capacity of 15,500,000 kilo-
watts. American trade journals estimate, on the basis of ‘U. S.

experience, that installation of every one million kilowatts of

capacity requires about 85,000 tons of copper. .

Soviet purchasing missions have been in negotiation r
cently with the Chilean government Copper Department and

producer in Africa.

Rhodesian copper bought last year have been under discussion.
0 These reports, unconfirmed at Mine.-Mill Union press time,

. have been a major factor in supporting copper prices since
, early January.“

NEWEST DEVELOPMENT in copper technology to be ap-
plied on a large scale will be the $23 million integrated copper

refinery and fabricating mill to be built on Mindanao, large 

island in the southern Philippines. The plant will turn low grade
ores into high quality copper and wire mill products with.out

' melting in smelter, converter or casting department.

The process involves chemical reduction of copper, by-pass»
ing the smelting and, electrolytic refining stages. The product,
a copper powder about 99.95 per cent pure, is then directly fab-
ricated into sheet, strip, tube and wire. ‘

KENNECOTT has completed negotiations for sale of its
interestin two South African gold mines, reported earlier in this.
column last January. Kennecott’s original investment in
Merriespruit Gold Mining Co. and Virginia Orange Free State
Mining Co. was $47,000,000. V

Under the sale agreement, Kennecott will get up to $17 .

‘million plus rights to buy stock in purchasing company. Kenne-
cott’s loss of $30,000,000 or more on this venture can be charged
against surplus earned by the company on its other operations
and thus used to reduce the taxes otherwise payable to the U. S.
Government.

ISRAEL MINING INDUSTRIES, Israel government-owned
copper producer which reopened the historic King Solomon’s
copper mines of Biblical times ten years ago, has now sunk
deeper shafts and will expand mine production to about 14,000
tons of copper per year.

Thus far, output has been processed into cement copper and
exported to European refineries. A new electrolytic refinery in
Israel will handle the mine output. Reserves of 1.5 per cent
copper ore are estimated at 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 tons.

recent production cuts by Ana-

' in ‘Montana, the highest in the

" : the national average of 8 per

IN CALLING for emergency

funds to enable all states to

continue payment of benefits,
he commended the manner of
federal financing proposed in
the bill (HR 3864) under con-

sideration. , .
This, he said, would permit

the states to put the program

into effect quickly without
additional legislation. It would
_ remove much of the opposition
to participating which would
otherwise exist in the states,
‘ since participating and non-
participating states w o u I d
. share alike in the increased
financial costs of the extended
benefits program.
.  Lack of such-Ca consideration
in the 1958 extended benefits

program resulted in the par-
ticipation of only 17 states
throughout the U. S., only two
of them (California and
Nevada) in the Rocky Moun-
tain and Pacific Coast west, he
recalled.

IN HIS testimony submitted
before the House Labor com-
mittee, Clark agreed with com-
mittee Chairman Adam_ Clay-
ton Powell (D., N. Y.) that
the minimum wage under the
Fair Labor Standards act
should immediately be raised
to $1.25 instead of stages over
two years as proposed in the
Administration's bill, HR 3935.
He also urged broadening of
the bill's coverage. ‘

The interest of Mine-Mill’s
membership as a whole in im-
provement of minimum wage
standards‘, Clark told the com-
mittee, “lies in the elimination
of substandard c o n d i t i o n s
which are a threat to wage
earners everywhere, and in the
contribution which elimination

-. of substandard w a g e s will

make to general improvement
in economic activity.”

“On both counts," he added,
“we would favor the imme-

’ Clark Presents Testimony

diate rather than deferred ap-
plication of the $1.25 hourly
minimum, and considerably
more broadening of coverage
than is provided in the 1961
amendments.” On the latter
score, he specifically men-
tioned coverage of workers in
large s c al e, commercializ-ed

farming.
‘ >2: are are

EXTENDING the scope of
his testimony, Clark referred
to conditions in the non-fer-
rous metals industry Where
great strides in technology and
gains in productivity have re-

sulted in widespread perman-‘

ent layoffs and the closing of
entire plants.

“The basic solution to this
serious problem of shrinking
employment lies in the shorter
work week with no loss in
take-home pay,” he said, point-
ing out that the proposed
legislation under consideration
by the . committee makes no
move in that direction.

“Fair Labor Standards legis-
lation will have to address it-
self to this form of relief in
the problem posed by our in-
creasing industrial productiv-
ity”, Clark concluded.

a worldwide basis, to encour-
age production on a year-

Mansfield’s recommenda-
tion follows closely one of the
major industry-wide measures
proposed by Mine-Mill in its
program for promoting recov-
ery in non-ferrous metals.

This was underscored in a
letter which President Clark
sent to President K e n n e d y
urging that the President give
M a n s f i e 1 d’s recommenda-
tion the most serious and fa-
vorable consideration.
