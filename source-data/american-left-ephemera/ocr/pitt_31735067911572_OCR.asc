CALGARY, Albe.rta———The larg-
est Canadian convention in Mine-
Mill history was held here March
5-7. The delegates established a
Canadian Mine-Mill Council, and
set a 1953 national bargaining‘
goal of 20-cents an hour across
the board.

By-laws of the new council
adopted by the convention call for
a meeting at least twice yearly,
with an executive of eleven mem-
bers. The first meeting, at which
a full-time Council secretary will
be chosen, will be held in a month.

A national Mine-Mill office for
Canada, will be established in
Toronto, it was agreed, to serve
as headquarters for both the
Council secretary and the Cana-

dian Mine-Mill Research Director,

Lukin Robinson. The following
members were chosen for the
Council executive:

From eastern Canada—M. Kop-
inak, Local 637, Port Colborne;
Mike-Solski, Local 598, Sudbury;
and R. L. Stevenson, Local 598,
Sudbury. From the central divi-
sion L. M. Messmer, Local 881,
Medicine Hat; R. Michell, Local
800, Calgary.
From western
Canada — Ken
Smith, Local
663, Britannia;

 DENVER—One of the most

important series of bargaining__

conferences in recent Mine-Will

_ history will open here this week.

Upwards of 100 keyirank-and-file
leaders in the basic mining, smelt-
ing and refining sections of the
industry are due to attend.
Delegates to the Mining, Smelt-
ing & Refining Conference, start-
ing Saturday, will be faced with a
conflicting picture in which cop-
per prod-uction continues high,

while cutbacks and shutdowns are '

being ordered in lead-zinc opera-
tions. ’ ,

They will also take up the close
tie between the election of the
Eisenhower government and
greater employer toughness in the
non-fer_rous metals industry. Pro-
posals for relating political and
legislative action to this year's
bargaining campaign will be con-
sidered carefully.

IN ADDITION to setting wage
demands, the delegates were ex-
pected to pay serious attention
to health and welfare issues, con-
tract bonuses, increased pension

v benefits, uniform vacation plans,

and other key ‘ffringesf’

THE NEW COUNCIL was
authorized to initiate a campaign
to defeat Bill 93, which is a sort
of composite of the McCarran,
Smith, Taft-I-lartley and other
anti-labor U. S. measures. It
would hamstring Canadian unions
and restrict, perhaps eliminate,
the civil liberties of this country
generally. ‘' ,

To this end, a resolution was

‘adopted calling for creation of

try sooner or later, will be dis-
cussed both in terms of what can
bedone at the negotiating table
and on the legislative front. A

tors will be among ro osals

civil rights committees in every
local. W. C. Muir, business agent
of Local 901, was delegated to
present the. union case on Bill 93
before the Parliamentary commit-
tee at Ottawa, with a 'recommen-
dation that Regional Director
Murphy accompany him if pos-
sible. \ V

The Wage and Contract policy
committee under the __chairman‘—
ship: of Mike Solski, Local 598,
Sudbury, won endorsement for a
program of the 40-hour, five-day
week, with. no compulsory over-
time, as well as the proposed wage
increase. '

gates’ consideration. ’

The Mining, Smelting &,Refin-
ingConference will come after a
day of preparatory sessions by
the Kennecot/t," Anaconda, Phelps-
Dodge, and A S& R lVline-Mill
Councils.

The jam-packed weekend bar-

security, overtime penalties are
proposed to make the practice
almost prohibitive, with double-

time for the first two hours to be "

increased progressively for each
hour thereafter.

While opposed to contract
bonuses in principle, the conven-
tion endorsed the recommendation
of the colnmittee that contract
committees should be set up
everywhere in order to exercise
fuller control over the terms and
prices of contracts.

In his opening spieech as chair-
man of the convention, lnt’l Presi-
dent John Clark told the dele-

of the local and International union

gressional delegation in Washington to
_., ' seek their personal support in stopping
' - \ the layoffs and restoring full produc-
tion to‘the Baltimore refinery.
The delegation included the four top
;« officers
Thomas Ayre, Vice President Walter

.- \.

Watkins and \ Recording Secretary T.
Chandler Taylor, accompanied by. Wash-

Bob Schrank. They asked for an in-

vestigation of the layoffs at a time

when copper companies were- asking

for price increases allegedly to boost
‘T-7 _  production of the vital red metal.

‘— ' W THIS FACT had been pointed ‘to in

" " an open letter, signed by Board Mem-

" ber Albert Pezzati as well as Ayre and

' v\.\~ Schrank, which asked the, blunt ques-

" tion: “Are these ‘workers and their

 

 '3  V" families victims of a.delibe'rately con-. ,

  - trived production cutback as part of a
‘ff’; blackjack policy _to get higher prices

for the companies?” ’ "

_-The letter also noted

after controls yvere removed, was the
, Kennecott Copper Co., which controls
the supply and output of the Baltimore
AS&R plant. ' , .
In their replies to the letter and at
Senators and Congressmen’ expressed
\. , concern and a desire to cooperate in
‘ finding a solution. in a ‘later telegram
to Pezzati, Sen. John Marshall Butler
 said: “We are prepared to cooperate in
 every way possible.” 1 *

In; an feffort _ to find .811 possible
 -avenues‘ -“'_of cooperation, the union
_ agreed to prepare agmemorandum on
the -situation for presentation to the

. Congressmen with proposals for action.
 .'.l.‘he memo, ‘now’ in preparati-on, will
’ call for: ' '

‘m.-deiiberate rgstriction of ore and scrap
supplies in order to force up and main-
tain the already rising’"price of copper.

 .some of the Rhodesian blister copper
now being shipped by the Britishfinto

BALTIMORE, Md.-.—A fight for jobs has ‘been launched at the
plant of the American Smelting Refining Co. here, where some 200
"’members have been laid off, and there are prospects of more to go.

When the company ordered a drastic production cutback, Mine-
Mill Local 625, aided by the District 6 staff and our Union’s Washing-
ton office, immediately brought the problem to the attention of state
.  » and city officials with an urgent request for action. ' '

 urged in testimony p_resented last

Week by Mine—Mill’s International
Secretary — Treasurer Maurice
Travis and Vice President Orville

Larson.

  The House ‘Labor Committee,

 holding lengthy hearings on pro-

"  to amend or
. f "the Taft-Hartley.
f‘  Act, voted unani-
"  mously to make
ythe - Mine-Mill

statements, total-
" ling 17 pages, a
part of the record
‘M e a n while,
‘ plans were being
made to have Maurice E. Truvis
Mine-Mill witnesses appear in
person- before the Senate Labor
‘ Committee headed by Sen. Robert
A. '-I-Taft, in similar hearings which
were due to start this week. i
“Equality in the field of labor rela-

tions,” said Travis, “can only, be estab-

: lishedlby the re-enactment of the Na-
. tional Labor Relations Act of 1935.”
“The Taft-Hartley Act has not acted

to equalize the bargaining strength ‘

and power of the many individuals
 whose sum ‘total makesup the Union
as against the corporations,” Mine-
Mill’s Secretary-Treasurer said, ‘and

‘then he listed all the ways in which
, T-H has weakened unions.

Ta-ft-Hartley act proposed by CIO. In’

presenting them, CIO P "re s i d e n t

. provision of T-H is the most dangerous
part of the law.” , .
1. “Eliminate governmpnt by injunc-
tion and restore the Norris-LaGuardia
tact.” This means repeal of three T-H
‘injunction provisions. U’
2. “Remove , the undue government
a interference which Taft-Hartley has
imposed on collective bargaining?’ This

« , means freedom for union and "manage-

_-ment “to negotiate whatever type of
,.union security arrangements they deem
appropriate.”

Congress," which has for half a cen-
tury represented, in its own words,
‘the great bulk of the output of the
mineral resource industries,’ come be-
fore your Committee and recommend
in all seriousness that it opposes bar-
gaining with unions on an industry-
wide basis.”

Larson’\s_.lengthy analysis of how
the T-H injunction has operated dur-
ing the last five years included a step
by step review of -Mine-Mi‘ll’s 10-day
strike in 1951. Hecalled attention to’
the fact that the Union accepted the ‘
recommendation for settlement made
by Dr. Cyrus Ching, then director of
the Federal Mediation & Conciliation
Service, despite the fact that _Ching’s
proposal “asked the Union to make a
‘further sacrifice at least twice as great
as the company’s.’’ ,

“The company rejected Dr. ‘Ching’s
recommendation,” Larson pointed out.
“It was. the company, not the union,
mind you, that called all bets off.” And

V he showed how- the strikethat fol-

lowed lasted only 10 days and was

ended by\a Taft-Ha‘rt1ey , injunction.‘ _

“Our membership felt, and rightly
so, that the brunt of the lnjunctive
process was direct- L
ed against labor
and not against
management,” he
concluded.‘ “We be-
lieve that injunc-
tions can _. .- e V e 1‘

“Labor,’? Larson said, “bears ‘the

tures to give priority to conciliation

It is the working people who are

THE MINE-MILL vice president al-

of leadership . . 5. which our member-

- shipfeels is one of the basic principles

of our American democracy.”

“The, principle is not only the free

choice without interference of the bar-
gaining representative, “but the free
choice of selecting and electing union

leadership, to carry out the principle.

of freedom inchoosing the bargaining
representative,” he said.

* /' Explaining how Mine-Mil1'democ-

racy works, Larson added: ‘We are not

afraid of our democratic processes. We V’

have confidence in the intelligence and
ability of our niembership to choose
leaders who they think can best carry
out the program they themselves
formulate.” v

LARSON DEVOTED a considerable
part:‘“‘of his testimony to the 10 propos-

als made to the ‘committee by spoke/s-'

nieri for the American Mining Con-
gress. “The essence of these proposals
is very simple,” he said. “Return labor
relations to“ the law of the jungle,
which means the complete domination
of the big mining companies, as it was

before our Union was ever organized.”

' Pointing out that our Union “does
not ask the right to supervise the elec-
tion of directors or officers of the
American Mining Congress or of any
of its constituent companies or to
have political or other tests imposed
on them,” Larson added: _“It does not
ask the government for more interfer-

THE LABOR INJUNCTION er

Labor bears the brunt of the injunc-
tion. It is the working people who are
“cooled off,” and not management- It
is labor which must. wait an additional
three months before a. settlement can
be made of the dispute. , I  '

In addition to the injunctiveu pro-
ceedings referred to
of ‘national emergency” there are two
other types of injunctions contained in
Taft-Hartley,‘ which we oppose.

In one, the General Counsel’ may at
his discretion seek an injunction in the
Federal Courts against any individual
charged with committing an unfair la-
bor practice.

The» other type of injunction_con—
tained in the law applies when the
General Counsel. of the Board, inihis
opinion, believes that a union'has en-
gaged in an unfair labor practice pro-
hibited by the “secondary boycott” sec-
tion. It is mandatory. I '

Prior to 1932 and the enactment of
the Norris-LaGuard’ia Anti-Injunction
Act, our Union many times felt the
whip,-lash of the easilyobtained injunc-
tion, handed out in courts where often
the evidence for the granting of the
injunction was flimsy, to say the least.

Under the Taft-Hartley Act, we feel
that the use of this anti-labor weapon
has againibeen revived. A check dis-
closes that most of the’ injunctions
sought by theiBoard’s General Counsel,‘
"have iII the main been of the manda-
tory type and have applied principally
to the Unions——actually about 20 to 1.

. THE WAGNER ACT AND

‘THE 'l‘AF'l‘-HARTLEY ACT-

. _, Frankly: gentlemen, our Union’s

A , _ -membership is, united-‘ in the -feeling

that the ‘,Taft-Hartley Act, or as it is

1 , more , technically known, the Labor
- -V ’- Management Relations Act of 1947, is

i _"‘a ‘bad law. It is a bad law not only
because it hurts American labor, b t
because it hurts the American people
as well. *

The Taft—H-artley Act bears the
‘,mark of punitive legislation. It _was'.,
written as an attempt to? restore
against labor some of the unequal bal-
ances“ that had existed prior to the" en-
actment of the National Labor Rela-
tiops Act "of 1935, popularly known as ._

. the Wagner Act. . . , A. "
‘While unions - have grown, their-
 power and influence have not kept
pace with the growth of American bus-
iness. '
 4' We are for the ‘principles and phil-
-~ josophy of the National Labor Relations’
Act of 1935. No one in America, in-
cluding the employers of our industry '
or any other industry, will suffer if the
; "Congress inia spirit‘of equality re-
qdedicates to the working men and
,, - women of America their basic freedom
' ‘A _,.to organize, -unfettered ‘by the many
‘ E. A restrictions of the present law.

WASHINGTON. — Spokesmen for
big,busipess—especially the American_
.Mining Congress~had a field day re-
centlypwhen it came their turn to tes-
tify before the "House Labor Commit-
tee on proposed changes in labor leg-
islation. . c
“The  Steel corporation and the
.men who represent it think the time to
sInash”labor is.now,” commented one
veterans~Capitol Hill observer. “That's

a new method of handling unions led
by ‘socalled subversives.” A l

' Speaking. for the American_Mining
Congress were Charles ..R. Kuzell and
Denison Kitchel, both of Phelps—Dodge.

\

' They ‘called for 10 changes in the Taft-

Hartleyl Act, all designed to weaken

labor, includir.g_,a_' ban’ on union secur-

ity and on industry-wide bai-gaining.
THE MINING CONGRESS repre-

, sentatives called for creation of an

“independent g-ovcrnmentﬁl agency em-
powered to determinewhether’ or niit
a union is inflIIenced_ by Communists
or Communist sympatliizers and to
then ‘bring about their removal from.
such unioi1s.”  i 
"Earlier President‘ Groner of the
'Kansa_s City Public Service Co., -had
presented, the" U. S. 'Chamber of Com-
,merce_proposals, including a demand
that “control” over A labor-management
. relations be returned to‘ the states. He
also called for replacement ,of the
present .NLRB with a_ 7-man.\board
which heihoped would be more partial
to industlfyb. He accused the present
board of being pro-labor! .
Groner denounced all forms ‘of‘union
.,Iecurit.»y- and "came. out with a ,,new
tom of ~the proposed ban on indus-
. try-wide strikes. _

Main Factors inf
Canadian Economy

“'1-‘wo factors dominatethe‘ Canadian _

'e.C0n0m’y Aatn the‘-_présent time: They
are: thelincreasing domination of the
_United States’ and, consequently the in-
-creasing dependence of Canada, both
‘economically'."and .po1'itically,; on the
U. S.‘ secondly,.th‘e uncertai-nty of"‘the

future, .tlie growing fear of ‘an eco-

nomic crisis and nde"pression~among the
Canadian people.” ‘ '

Economic Crisis’, ’ _
“Canada’s dependence” on’ the'..U. S.
for markets for what we" produce is es-
peciallygreat in the industry in which
the workers, are‘ represented by Mine-
Mil1—the llnon-ferrous metals industry.
All ‘but a tiny f1jaction.of the nickel

produced in Canada, is exported, and V

of these exportsV70‘/n go. -to th_e,U_.A.S.
. .' . 80% ‘of (A)anadaA’.s -lead pr'oduction
‘was exported,‘ and--of‘ these two-thirds

wentlto the U.  90%‘of.the‘ziﬁc 
‘was exported, andﬁof these_expo1"ts

58% went. to the U. S. .i . . 57% of"
Canada’s'production- of copper is ex-
ported, and of these exports 40% goes
to the U: S. . . . 60% of‘ our sAil'ver pro-A

A duction goes to the U. S.”

“An economic crisis  the_ U. AAS.
would quickly? shatter the uncertain

basis on whidh Canada’sA present 56-‘

called prosperity -rests.”

wide survey of lung canqer hazards in.
all non-ferrous mining and smelting
areas. Several studies in .-recent years
have shown a definite connection be-.
tween respiratory cancer and work in
mines and smelters. ’More complete
studies to "show how far and how wide
the danger extends, and wh_at preven-
tive measures need ‘to be’taken, have
‘been called for by numerous m
and health authorities.

in Spite of It is now over two years, for exam-
.plc, since Dr. W. C. .Hueper of the

National Cancer Institute pointed to
the fact that an unusually" high rate of
‘death from lung cancers ‘had been

found iimthree Montana co. ties where

_study was based on death records for’
the years‘ A1.-947 a11d 1948.

The greatest death rate from lung
cancer was found in Deer Lodge Coun-
ty where about 25% of the population
is:engaged in the" smelting‘ of copper
ores containing_0.5% of arsenic. The
annual lung cancer ._death rate tl~.er§,>

 S B *7 Three fires climax

. violence against movie

BAXARD, N. M.-—Th1-ee fires within

' ; week have climaxed the violence used
in a vain effoit to prevent the making

of _u union movie, “Salt. of the Earth.”
Early _ in the. morning of Sunday,“

‘March 8, the union hall of Local 890
‘ herein Bayard was set afire. Fortu-

nately, union members on their way to
work saw the blaze and put it out be-

. / fore firemen arrived. Damage was at

least $1.000. Evidence was found of a

. deliberately short-circuited electric cir-
, _cuit.

During the week of March 8, three
aft:-’iiipt.s were made. to burn the house
‘of Floyd Bostick, wa.rden-conductor of
Local 890. ‘

Early in the morning of Sunday,
March 15, the other Mine-Mill local
union in New Mexico had its huge
union hall burned to the ground, with
a loss of more than $86,000. (See pic-
ture. this page.) ‘

ON MARCH 17. Bostick and his wife,
who had been -standing guard over
their home by.. turns during the night,

‘ left their three children for a short

time’ during the day. They returned

“to find their home completely de-

stroyed by fire. Fortunately, the chil-
dren got out safely? ’

Bostick, laid off_ when the AS&R
mine here shut down last month, had
g‘0t“s-.n work at Deming, 50 _1~¢iiles_away.,
but had to give up the job toprotect
his home after the repeated ‘attemps

’ to burn it. Members of Local 890 are

taking‘ up a collection to help rebuild
and furnish the ,Bostick'home, which

_ Floyd had built himself. --

Presidcnt Juan Chacon of Local 890

I announced that the union has employed

an arson expert from Denver to in-
vestigate thc three fires.

Adolfo Barela, financial secretary of
Lpc.l 890, in a letter to a1lsMine-Mill
loca. unions. pointed out thatthe hood-

lumshad not succeeded‘ in stopping the

picture. “The crew did not leave Silver
C-i,t._v before its work was done,” the
letter stated. “It was finished as com-_
pletely as could be done Without Miss
Revuéltas. and only a-few scenes re-
main to finish without her.” (These
scenes have been completed elsewhere.)
BARELA“S LE'l‘TER added: :2
“We have friends in this community
and we-have' a membership that_ is
strong‘ and united . .-. our enemies here-
are not really worried abo}it.our movie
this is a real union-busting move.
involved _in
the new attack are many who’ called in
the Steelworkers during our strike. The
next factor is that -rec-entll‘ 3“

“When you see ‘Salt of the Eartli’
it will ‘make you proud. All of us here
in Local 890 are very proud of it.”

The 49th Convention of the Interna-

‘Workers will open Monday, September

‘Never compromise W|‘l'l1
Imquity and Injustice’
To the Editor:

Although I am not a member of
Mine-Mill (and I have held cont.in'uous
niembersliip in other unions for more
than a‘ score of years, among them
U.M.W.A.) I read‘ your paper regularly
and.I am compelled to “take my hat
off” to the paper, and to Mine-Mill, for
the courageous stand you are taking-
for the repeal oi.’ the Ta'ft-Hartley law
and the ‘unAn1erican‘ activities of Pat
McCarran. _ \

, Re: the Taft-Hartley law, I stated
on the floor of the State Federation of
Labor convention in Butte one year
ago, that if I were privileged to direct

the policygof all U. S. labor organiza-

tions, there would be a general strike
for the repeal—outrig‘ht rcpeal—.—of this
vicious law and that such a strike would’
continue until the damnahle law. was
repealed.

Many labor spokesmen are content
to compromise with amendments to the

law which they mistakenly assume will ,

make it more acceptable to labor,,b t
I insist that laborshould never com-

' Jiromise with iniquity and injustice. .
