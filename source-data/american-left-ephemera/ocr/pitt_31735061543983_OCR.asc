ties of any of its members, Socialism will accomplish
what capitalist legislation cannot—the abolition of ev-
ery form of discrimination. Socialism, by rewarding
society with greater well-being and abundance through
the fullest cultural and productive development of its
members, places a’premium on’ cooperation.

The task devolves upon the workers of our genera-

tion to bring to birth a new world, a world in which the
"color of one’s skin will mean as little as whether one is
tall or short, or fat or thin. But, to accomplish this

mighty task, the workers of all races must immunize
themselves against the racist and nationalist poison.
They must resist every incitement to racial animosity.
They must understand that the race concept itself is the
product of capitalist-engendered strife, and that their
overriding interest is to consolidate their economic and
political might for the conquest of power. V

In understanding this, the moral and cultural sta-
ture of the workers will grow. For they will have
freed themselves from the most degrading bondage of
all, the enslavement of the human mind. As Maxim
Gorky once expressed it: ,

“History demands the coming of a new man, freed
from racial, national and class prejudices. Is such a

man possible? The working class is about to create-

him. Apply your efforts, employ all your days to the
creation of that ardently expected man, and you your-
self will become that man.”

ORIGIN OF RACIST lD»OCTRINE'S

Racism—the evil theory that some so-called races‘
are inherently “superior” and others inherently “infe-
rior,” together with the implications of this theory-is
of relatively recent origin. Indeed, “the fateful word
race itself is actually not yet two hundred years old.’’’
And race prejudice began to make itself felt as a social
force only a littl.e more than a century ago.‘ People‘
have, of course, persecuted and enslaved other people
for thousands of years. But it was not until modern
times that the attempt was made to ‘justify persecution
and slavery on racial or biological grounds.

Among warring primitive peoples, even those of
different ethnic stocks, racial differences, ‘such as color
of skin, eyes, etc., played little or no part. Male cap-
tives were usually slain, while females and children

-were frequently adopted by the tribes of the captors.
As members of the tribe the adopted aliens were re-
garded as equals in every respect even if, ethnically,
they were of another “race.”

’ Later, when primitive communism was superseded

by a society resting on chattelvslavery, a variety of ar-_

guments was advanced.to rationalize the institution—
but alleged racial inferiority of the slaves was not
among them. Indeed, the ancient Greek poets “insist
on the funvdamental equality -of the slave,”5 and some
of the philosophers held that it was notnature, but for-
tune, that makes a slave. It is true that the majority
of slaves werecaptives taken in War, but rationalization
on racial grounds (even if it could have occurred to the
Greeks) was barred by the fact that many of the slaves
of Greeks were Greeks—freemen who were reduced to

.9’

 

indigence through usury and sold themselves or their
children into slavery to satisfy their creditors. '

 

STRANGER-FEAR IN THE MIDDLE VAGES

In the Middle Ages religious differences provoked
the persecution of minorities, such as the Jews, and
throughout the era a ferocious xenophobia (fear of
strangers) made all communities inhospitable to “for-
eigners,” whether of the same -or a different “race.”
Even today in provincial communities in the United
States strangers are looked upon with suspicion, and in
England there are places where, until a short time ago
at least, visitors from the next parish were regarded as
“foreigners,” and treated accordingly. One of Mr.
{ Punch’s famous drawings depicts twoworkmen, -one of
J whom observes, “Look, Bill! Furriner!” “ ’Eave ’arf
E

a brick at ’im!” the other exclaims without looking up.
But the xenophobia of the Middle Ages did not
distinguish between_“‘races.” A stranger was a stranger,
regardless of the color of his skin. Practically all mi- .
norities were religious minorities and were persecuted
as such. The French Huguenot refugees, for example,
who came to England after the repeal of the Edict of
Nantes by Louis XIV, were objects of prejudice both , 
'because they were strangers and Nonconformists. But
the religious barrier was not insurmountable and, after
a time, they were assimilated into the English popula-
tion. It is one of the little ironies ofyhistory that,
whereas two hundred years ago the Huguenots in Eng-
land were victims of familiar prejudices——they were ac-
cused of being dirty, overcrowding, bringing down liv-
ing standards, etc.—those who can trace their Hugue-
not ancestry today frequently pride themselves on their
“romantic” origin! ‘

RACISM VS. “INALIENABLE RIGHTS”

The more one studies the dogma of racial inequal-
ity, the more signiﬁcant it becomes that its origin and
development coincide with the arrival of capitalism on
the historic scene, with the growth of capitalist colonial
imperialism, and the intensiﬁcation of capitalist nation-
al antagonisms.

At ﬁrst blush, it may seem a paradox that the age
which brought “enlightenment,” and equalitarian ideals
concerning the “inalienable rights of men” and “free-
dom,” should also have produced racial concepts so

"much at war with these. The paradox, however, is

easily resolved when it is recalled that capitalist “en-
lightenment,” the “rights of man,” etc., were weapons
forged by the bourgeoisie in its struggle to free itself
from feudal bonds, and that, once triumphant, its en-
thusiasm for equalitarian ideals waned as it faced the
task of defending its rule against the upsurging work-
ers. But the struggle against the workers did not, in
most countries, develop immediately. In the United

States decades elapsed before the capitalist and working .

classes acquired permanent character, and, in the mean-
time, the high ideals of the Revolutionary epoch bec.ame
too solidly ﬁxed in tradition to be shaken off without
inviting major social upheaval. ’ '
Indeed, it was largely because of these ideals that
a new moral apology had to be invented for the slave
system of the South. Theold one was based on reli-
gion. The African was a heathen, a descendant of
Noah’s son, Ham, cursed by God himself and doomed
to be a slave forever because of an ancient sin. Also,

i it was argued that to enslave the African was to elevate

him, save his soul, and expose him to civilizing inﬂu-
ences.

THE DOCTRINE OF BIOLOGICAL INEQUALITY

While this rationalization was never abandoned

and is invoked to this day,‘ it was far from sati-sfying
an age that proclaimed the rights of man as “inaliena-
ble.” Moreover, the institution of chattel slavery was
weakened as soil fertility was exhausted, and many
Southerners, finding their Negroes less profitable,
wrote and spoke for manumission. Then came the in-
vention of the cotton gin, and, with it, a strong stimu-
lus for retaining slavery. Its apologists, therefore,
sought -to fortify the-ivr “peculiar institution” by invok-
ing a new s-cience———biology.

Scholars were enlisted to “prove” the Negro bio-
logically inferior, and, therefore, the natural ward of
the white man. An elaborate doctrine of biological in-
equality was built up as “scientists” casually drew whol-
ly unwarranted conclusions from inadequate data of
skull measurements, cranial capacity, etc. This doc-
trine, with its pseudo-scientiﬁc coloration, was widely
disseminated, not only in the South, but throughout the

- nation. As the Civil War drew near, white writers
and “intellectuals” were increasingly mobilized to’

spread the rationalization which tended, more and
more, to supplant theology and history as justification
for slavery. So effective was the biological theory, with
its emphasis of racial “differences” that even the white

friends of the Negro assumed them to be true.’ It i

was not until much later that improved techniques in
scientiﬁc research began to. disprove the dogmatic con-
clusions of the biological pro-slavery apologists. By
that time, however, those conclusions had pervaded the
thinking of a majority of the whites. , After the eman-
cipation of the Negro from chattel slavery, the racial
12

..-—~—t — - 

 

v-- -—t -- 

doctrine of biological inferiority persisted. The caste
system inherited the defense ideology of slavery.

RACISM AND COLONIAL IN[li'ERIALISM

The theory of racial inferiority, invented as a moral-

apology for Negro slavery, and retained to justify the
N egro’s treatment as a pariah and sub-human in a na-

tion proclaiming “inalienable” human rights, was not

the work of pro-slavery “scientists” alone. In Great

. Britain, Belgium,,France, Holland, Italy, and other co-

lonial powers, the anatomists and anthropologists were
busily engaged in fortifying the theory of the “white
man’s burden.” Especially where equalitarian ideals

were preached at home, the contrasting slavery and ab-

solutist rule imposed on colonial subjects clearly called
for an “explanation.” While the statesmen hypocriti-
cally deplored the self-assumed obligation to “uplift”
the so-called backward races and school them in the
art of self-government—via the machine gun, whipping
post and_artiﬁcial famine, and while poets sang of the
“fuzzy-wuzzies’ ” barbarous ways, the “scientists” sol-
emnly provided the alleged biological reasons for the
“white man’s burden.” -
Thus it was sought to justify the naked exploitation
of peoples unequipped to withstand the ravages of cap-
italist colonial imperialism. Always and everywhere
despotism sought to mask its purpose by alleging bene-

fits to its victims. But “turn it whatever way you will,”'

as Abraham Lincoln observed, “whether it comes from
the mouth of a king, or from the mouth of one race as
a reason for their enslaving the men of some other

‘race, it is the same old serpent. They all say that they

bestride the necks of the people, not because they want
to do this, but because the people are so much better

13'

 

 

off for being ridden.‘ You work and I eat. You toil

and I will enjoy the fruit of your toil. The argument ,

is the same and the bondage is the same.”

CAPITALISM vs. SCIENCE

Science, bona ﬁde science, has dispr-oved the. super-
stitions of the racial doctrine. It has shown that adap-

tations to the conditi-ons of environment alone explain‘

the Visible differences in the three major human stocks

——Caucasoid, Mongoloid and Negroid, corresponding.

roughly to the popular division of mankind into
White, Yellow and Brown? But science has al-so re-
vealed that, migration and hybridization across the
ages have diluted the original stocks, and that, today,
the “pure” race is non-existent. Most important’ of
all, science has exposed as utterly without foundation
the racist theory of‘ inherent “superiority” and “infe-
riority”‘of racial ‘stocks, and_it has assembled‘irnpres-
sive evidence which points cle-arly to the conclusion that,

given equal social, educational and economic opportu- '

nity, no single “race” of men will excel another in intel-
ligence, ability, genius, or moral character.
Notwithstanding this, the cankerous growth of race
prejudice remains t-o plague mankind. The reason is,
of course, that the class and material interests which
are served by race prejudice remain. And they will

, continue to bewith us, together with their evil brood ‘

of racial and national arrogance andprejudice, as -long
as capitalism remains the ruling principle of society.
For equality of social, educational and economic opp-or-
tunity between races—the condition under which the
equality of man "will finally be proved conclusively-—
cannot exist until capitalist rule is overthrown, and so-
ciety is reconstructed along Socialist lines.

Like a dreadful epidemic that follows in the wake

of war, and vanishes with the r_estorati-on of peace,_

modern “race” concepts which grew out of capitalist
and feudo-capitalist conditions will vanish from the
minds of men’when class rule is extirpated.

III _
RACISM BOLSTERS CLASS RULE

The presence of a racial minority in the working
class population is advantageous to the capitalist class
for a variety of reasons. The ﬁrst and m-ost obvious
of these is the opportunity it affords for utilizing race
vanity and race prejudice in keeping the workers di-
vided against themselves.

Capitalism, by its very nature, engenders competi-

'tion for jobs among the workers.’ The greater the

number of W-orkers without jobs, the sharper is the
competition; the sharper the competition, all the more
fertile is the soil for the seed of race prejudice. The
fact that one group of workers is marked off from an-
other by color and tradition causes the competition. fre-
quently t-o take on the aspects of a group struggle
wherein the dominant “racial” group (such as the
white Gentiles in America), however divided within it-
self, acts as a unit to exclude from the available jobs
all other “racial” groups (Negroes, Jews, Americans
of Mexican descent, et al.). '
Indeed, in the absence of classconsciousness, no
amount of legislation against job bias or preaching of

“fair play” can prevent the numerically dominant

groups from struggling to preserve group job-monopo-
ly. Moreover, the more intense the struggle becomes,
15

 

all the more receptive will the unclassconscious mem-
bers of the predominant group be t-o race-mongering.
And all the more embittered the workers discriminated
against. There is a Swedish proverb: “When the feed-
box is empty, the horses will bite each‘ other."

The question that suggests itself here is: Will the
competition for jobs become less, or more, intense?

We disregard the pollyanna promises and promis-
sory notes of the He-nry Kaisers and Harry Trumans.
For the answer cannot be found in wishful prophecies.
It must be s-ought for in the economic laws inherent in, -
and inseparable from, the capitalist system.

 

C‘APITALISM’S INDUSTRIAL RESERVE ARMY

A surplus of Workers is regarded by the capitalist

class, even by those capitalists who promise “full em-

‘E ployment,” as desirable and necessary.‘? Capitalism

‘ has recruited its industrial reserve army largely through

t displacement of Workers by machines and improved

technique. The industrial reserve army; wrote Marx,

“belongs t-o capital quite as absolutely as if the latter

lp had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits

 - i of the actual increase in population, it creates, for the

fa changing needs of the self-expansion of capital, a mass
l

3!?

, of human material always ready for exploitation.”

 Capitalism requires an army of unemployed of suf-
in ﬁcient size to provide for capital expansion. Capitalism
creates such an army. Moreover, the economic laws
operating Within the system "decree that an ever larger
proportionof the capital outlay be constant capital
(machines, raw material, etc.), and an ever smaller
, proportion variable capital (wages). The effect of this
3 is to increase worker-productivity. But this increase in
output per worker, unless matched by’ a corresponding

16

 

—

expansion of the market, results in a decrease in the
demand for labor. Indeed, except when capitalism is
feverishly preparing for war, ﬁghting a war, or re-
building the ravages of War, it cannot prevent its un-
employed army from reaching Franken-stein propor-

tions. It numbered nine million When World War II .

began. Few doubt that it will be even larger -once the
postvv-ar boom ends. _

Mass unemployment, the tacit admission by capi-
tal that it cannot provide jobsifor its slaves, aggravates
worker job-competition, hence race prejudice. But it

also stimulates social unrest and increases the dem-and

among the workers that the wage-capital relationship
be ended once and for all. This spread of classcon-
sciousness tends to counterbalance the forces aggravat-
ing’ race prejudice among the workers by opening their
eyes to the common class. interests of all workers, and
by teaching them. that the exploiting employers alone
proﬁt from their division.

DIVIDE AND RULE!

The crafty, classconscious capitalist perceives that,
once the working class unites as a class, it will make
short shrift of the system which consigns to the indus-
trial scrap-heap millions of useful producers in their
‘prime. He, therefore, strivesto keep the workers di-
vided, Gentile against Jew, white against Negro, craft
against craft, and even male against female. For ex-
ample, he will encourage the “lily white" unions in ex-
cluding Negroes from membership. And he will bland-
ly argue as justification for his own discriminatory em-
ployment‘ practices," that his white employees “won’t
‘work with Negroes.” This sort of appeasement of the
dominant racial group isa potent factor in keeping the

SOEIALISM: '
WORLD WITHOUT
RACE PREJUDICE

By Eric H ass

Capitalism foments racial chauvin-
ism among exploited workers as a
means of keeping them ignorant of
their common economic and social
interests.

This pamphlet analyzes the “case”
for racism, and shows that there is
no essential difference among per-
sons of various “races.” And it dem-
onstrates that the unity of all work-
ers is requiredifor the establishment
of a world without exploitation,
without class rule, and without prej-
udice. V

Workers of all backgrounds are
urged to read and study this pam-
phlet, and to make its contents
known among their fellow workers.
An understanding of the subject mat-
ter is a prime requirement for the
understanding of capitalism and of
the need for Socialism.

w.-orking class divided, for it focuses the attention of
the “favored” ones on their immediate material'inter-
ests while obscuring their larger and, in the long run,
vastly more important class interests. As we have
pointed out elsewhere“: j

“Our modern exploiters, in inciting racial animosity,
but emulate the debauched and surfeited rulers -of an-
other age. In ancient Rome, Where slaves far outnum-
bered Roman freemen, the great secret of the latter’s
dominance was summed up in -the Latin motto: Divide
et z'mpera———-divide your slaves and so rule them. At one
time sixty million slaves of the Roman Empire were
held in subjugation chieﬂy through this device. _The
skilled slaves were encouraged to look with contempt
on the unskilled. The slaves from Greece were pitted
against the slaves from Gaul, -the slaves from Gaul
against the slaves from Ethiopia, etc. In his ‘Decline
and'Fall of the Roman Empire,’ _Gibbon describes how
slaves were used to guard slaves," and oversee their la-
bor, and how races were craftily set in competition with
one another..’’- . ‘

The disunity which prevails among the American
workers today is dismal evidence that our modern rul-
ers have learned this lesson well.

COLOR CONSCIOUSNESS BLURS THE ISSUE

A second advantage accruing to the capitalist class
from the presence of a racial minority in the popula-
tion, and one which serves the same end of blocking
workingiclass unity, is the pernicious effect of race pre-
judice on the outlook of its immediate victims. Take,
for example, the Negro in America. Humiliated by
social segregation, limited in educational oppor-
tunity, the victim of a double standard of law

18

 

 

 

administration, and restricted largely to low-pay menial
jobs by economic discrimination, he is never per-

_mitted to forget his color. from the day he makes the

awful discovery that he is “different,” to ‘the day he
dies. He knows his status, as a Negro, is that of a
pariah, that it is because of the pigmentation of his skin
that he is degraded to second-class citizenship, discrimi-
nated against, segregated, and otherwise ‘subjected to
indignities. Color-consciousness, -therefore, becomes a
part of him. Even if he knows that he is a wage slave

(and ninety-nine per cent of American Negroes are),

the implications of this class status are apt to be dis-
torted by his consciousness of color caste. One conse-
quence of this is a tendency to become preoccupied ex-
clusively with a Sisyphean struggle for economic and
social equality within the capitalist system. Co1or-con-
sciousness tends to blur the evidence showing the basic
cause of both hi-s pariah and proletarianistatus to be
class rule..

By reason of the history back of him and the race
relations established under chattel slavery and carried
over into the “free labor” era, the Negro worker con-
stitutes, as De Leon put it, “a special division in ‘the
ranks of labor.’’ '

“In no economic respect,” De Leon continued, “is
he [the Negro worker] different from his fellow wage
slaves of other races; yet by reason of his race, which
long was identiﬁed with serfdom, the rays of the Social
Question-reached his mind through such broken prisms

_that they are refrac-ted into all the colors of the rain-

bow, preventing him from appreciating the white light
of the question.” .
Today, however, the Negro worker is beginning to
appreciate the white light of the Social Question.

Thanks largely to a long series of tragic disillusion-
ments, and to the accelerated pace of history which ha_s
quickened his own mental processes, he is beginning to

- ;grasp the necessity for uniting all the workers along

 

class lines. Whereas prejudice against him formerly
tended to evoke something akin to Negro nationalism,
such nationalist movementsare’ now in eclipse. It is
safe to say that more Negro Workers are studying se-
riously the Marxian program of the Socialist Labor
Party than ever before. ‘

RACE STRIFE PAYS DIVIDENDS

In discussing the advantages accruing to the capi-
talist classfrom the presence of racial minorities, such
as the Negroes in America, -one that should not be
overlooked is the direct economic advantage.

Pitting race against race has paid the plunderbund
real dividends. It has supplied, ready at hand, a large
body of defenseless, destitute workers for low-pay sea-
sonal jobs, arduous “stoop” labor in the fields, slavish
tasks in industry, and menials for the homes of the
rich or Well-to-do. But workers of the dominant racial
group are mistaken if they believe this has cost them
nothing. The very presence of a body of slum-shocked
Workers, traditionally compelled to Work for starvation
wages, tends to depress the Whole Wage structure. The
exclusive racial practicesof unions, moreover, have
virtually delivered over to the employing class an em-
bittered element Which, in the absence of classconsci-
ousness, tends to be as little concerned for the welfare
of the dominant racial group as the latter are for the
minorities. If Negroes have been used as strikebreak-
ers, it is because unclassconsci-ous white workers have
put this weapon in the employers’ hands.

20

  

It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. The war,
for all the havoc it has wrought and the nameless mis-
ery it ha-s brought to the world’s oppressed, gave mil-
lions -of working-clla-sis Victims of race prejudice the op-
portunity temporarily to escaap-e from the strangle:-‘hold
of economic wretohedness, and to improve, in some7d'e-
gree at least, their economic position. Figures issue-d
early in 1945 by the U.S. Department -of Labor“ re-
ﬂected the grand migration of -Negro men and women
from their pellagra-‘ridden rural existence t-o the facto-

ries and shipyards, the upgrading of Negroes to skilled ~

and semi-.sk.iIlled jobs, -and the eagerness with which
Negro women seized the opp-ortunity to escape from
domestic servitude.”

The whole" working class benefited from the lift
this new experience gave the Negro Worker, from
his demonstration of aptitude and industrial skill
(which has taken the pins from under the myth of
“race inferiority”) and from his closer association with

white Workers. But, if the Working class is to realize V

these benefits, both Negro and whiteworkers must be-
come conscious of their common class interests and of
the imperious need to organize to abolish class rule.

. Otherwise, dire prophecies of “angry days” ahead, of

intensiﬁed race friction and even riots, are very likely
to materialize. And that will be a great tragedy. It
might cause the American workers toymiss the most
propitious opportunity yet vouchsafed by history to
strike the ‘shackles of wage slavery from their limbs.
It might enable prejudice‘-breeding capitalism to pro-
l-ong its existence and visit new wars and tragedy on
mankind.

IV
S-O!CIALI.SM—A PREJUDICE-FREE SOCIETY

It is vital to the class interests of the _rulers that all
workers be kept politically impotent. In the case of
White Workers in America this is accomplished by nu-
merous stratagems, the liberal use of reform bait, and
through the employment of the labor fakers as political
bell-Wethers. For the colored minorities, however,
special devices are employed either to\ exclude them
from the hustings or to keep them safely herded in the

political fold of‘ one or the other of the capitalist par-'

ties.

Disfranchisement of the Negro in the South is the
political counterpart of economic discrimination, social
segregation, and “race etiquette”—the social technique
so effective in the past in keeping Negroes in submissive
patterns of behavior. Some f-orms of d'isfranchise-
ment, such as the poll tax, reach impoverished‘ whites
as well as Negroes, but, even where these are abolished,
the color line is held and “white supremacy” maintained

' either through the enactment of other voting qualiﬁca-

tions Which, practically, exclude Negroes, orithrough
intimidation and violence. -

In the North, on the other ‘hand, the ballot is as
accessible to Negroes -and other racial minorities’ as to
Whites. Here, however, the Negro worker has long
been the victim of visionary reformers and, particularly,
of designing politicians "who cynically exploit his segre-
gated and caste status. This is so well known by Ne-
groes that it is a frequent topic -of comment in the Ne-
gro press. For decades after Emancipation, the Re-
publican politicians and their Negro i party hacks
counted the Negro worker vote in the bag. It vvas taken

22

 

l
é

 

 

forgranted in each election, as a sort of installment on
a‘ perpetual debt which Negroes allegedly owed “the
party of Abraham Lincoln.” A platitudinous plank
calling f-or “uplift of the Negro” went quite automati-
cally into each Republican pla-tform——to be as automati-
cally forgotten when the votes were counted. Negroes
never had a voice in G.O.P. councils, nor a part in
G.O.P. administration.

FROM MUMBO-JUMBO T0 JUMBO-MUMBO

With a tradition ‘vi:-a-tvis Negroes which is identi-
ﬁued with slavery, the Democratic party was long handi-
capped in the North in snaring the Negro worker vote.
It ﬁnally overcame that handicap, however, withthe
liberal use of reforms. Indeed, it came as something
of a shock to G.O.P. bosses when Northern Negroes,
repudiating their “debt,” swung their support to the

New Deal. This switch has had one important result. _

It has deepened the disillusionment of Negro workers
in capitalist politicians, whatever their party label. In-
creasing numbers of N egroworkers now perceive that
they have traded one rotten apple ‘for another. '

True, during the late War, the scope of economic
opportunity has recently widened for colored minori-
ties, particularly Negroes. And it is a tribute to the
growing awareness of ' social and economic forces
among the latter that theyihave not misunderstood the

cause. Nearly all Negroes who are politically c-on- .

scious understand that, at best, the Administration
yielded triﬂe-s, and that it was the exigencies of war
and the demand for high wartime production which
were wholly re-sp-on-sible. This is evidenced by the fact
that in no other group was apprehension over postwar
prospects so acute. ‘

23

 

M-ore-over, enlightened worke-rs have not misunder-
stood President TruIm»an’«s “civil rights” proposal-s.
Like the demand that the embarrassing «segregation
practices -in the na-tio:n.’s capital be corrected, the Tru-
man “Icivill rights” program is dictated ‘by the need to
make American capitalism appear virtuousbefore the
court of world opinion. Any improvements that may
c-ome will be, in a sense, by-products -of the “cold war.”

Out-and-out capitalist politicians are not alone in
seeking t-o exploit the Negro’s preoccupation with prob-

lems arising from racial discrimination. ' The so-called i

“Socialist” party politicians, and the American agents
of Stalinism, have brazenly and cynically trafficked on
his aspiratiorfs for racial equality. To Wanglehisvote
and his support, they have held before him the prospect
of race reforms within capitalist society. And they
have done this even though they know that capitalism,
by its very nature, fosters racism, and that cruel dis-
illusionment must inevitably result. No blacker record
of cold-blooded opportunism, exists than that of the
Communist party in its exploitation of the tragedies of
the Negro workers.

NO SOLUTION THROUGH “GOOD LAWS”

None den-ounces the evil of racism more than the
bona ﬁde Socialist. But the bona ﬁde Socialist
knows also that as long as capitalist conditions obtain,
as long as there are competition for jobs and economic
insecurity, as long as the capitalist class stands to bene-
ﬁt from keeping the Negro in a pariah state and divid-
ing the workers against themselves, trying to abolish
race prejudice islike shoveling sand "with a pitchfork.
As We have shown, instead of subsiding, racism tends to
grow more malignant as the capitalist crisis deepens.

24’

 

The capitalist class, in a thousand devious ways,
through its press, over its radio, and by putting slum-
mist elements on its payroll, seeks -to parry the blow
against itself and turn it against the vulnerable mi-
norities in -our midst. An unempdoyment crisis
and the unrest pervading the ranks of the toilers, in
the absence of classconsciousness, spell more racism,
not less. And, although fair employment practices
committees may succeed in breaking down some of the
economic barriers to Negroes, it is a dead certainty that,
under conditions of mass unemployment, they and all

-other victims of race prejudice will suffer dispropor-.

tionately. ,

Race prejudice became a weapon in the arsenal of
class rule when the owners of capital became the mas-
ters of society. It arose with capitalism; it will go
down with capitalism. Full citizenship status for Ne-
groes, and all other oppressed racial groups, is contin-
gent on the destruction of this utterly outmoded, evil-
breeding system. It is contingent on» the establishment
of a’ society in which the instruments of production are
owned socially and managed democratically, and in
which there are jobs for all; Only when one group‘
ceases to beneﬁt materially from the subjugation of an-
other group and opportunity is available for all will the
artificial barriers of race, raised by capitalism, fall
away and the aspiration for human brotherhood be ful-

ﬁlled.

SOCIALISM—l-A PREJUDICE-FREE SOCIETY

Socialism, and Socialism alone, creates these con-
ditions for equality and -opportunity. As we have said
elsewhere, we do not claim for Socialism the power of
magic. We know that racial superstitions and preju-

25

 

‘ dices are deep-rooted. They will not vanish from the «.
minds poisoned by them the moment the revolution ‘
triumphs. But we know also that under a society

where everyone who wants ‘a jobhas job-opportunity,

without fear of a jobless tomorrow, and where every-

one shares abundance as well as security, race prejudice i
will cease to be virulent and, ultimately, will die of i
desuetude. Socialism creates this atmosphere for
wholesome and cooperative relations between human
beings. Socialism, and Socialism alone, is the Nemesis
of race prejudice. .

, The conclusions stated above carry with them impli-
ii. cations of primary importance. One is that the Negro
 worker, and the worker of any.other racial group‘ tnat_
I -is discriminated against, has a special interest in ﬁghting

for Socialism. For him it means escape from caste, as
well as from class, bondage. He ought, therefore, to
school himself in the program for achieving Socialism,
 and to take a foremost role in propagating it among
ll his fellow wage slaves. Brieﬂy stated, that program
I requires: ' '
1': I. The organization of the workers into a party
i of their class, and one which aims to destroy the rule
I, of capital through the peaceful means aflorded by the
Constitution of the United States; and -
2. The consolidation of the workers’ might “on the
; industrial ﬁeld in a Socialist Industrial Union embrac-
ll ing all the workers, and prepared to act at a moment’s
E notice t-o back upthe Socialistballot by taking and hold-
‘ ing all the instruments of wealth-production. ' ’  '
The Socialist Industrial Union is the workers’
power. But it is more than that. It is alsothe admin-
istrative organization of future society; “Industrial
Unionism is the Socialist Republic in the making,”

wrote the great American Marxist, Daniel De Leon,
“and the goal once reached, the Industrial Union is
the Socialist Republic in operation.‘ Accordingly, the’
Industrial Union is, at once, the battering ram with
which to pound down the fortress of capitalism, and
the successor of the capitalist social structure itself.”

NEGROES AND THE S.L.P.

This is the program and this the goal. To‘ pro-
mote the former and insure the triumph of -the latter,
the place of the victim of race prejudice and color caste
is in the ranks of the Socialist Labor Party. And to
the Socialist Labor Party he mus-t come if he is not to
succumb to cynicism or utter desperation. For it is in
this Spartan Marxist party alone that he will ﬁnd the
honest logic, scientiﬁc integrity and single-minded deter-

V mination to go. to the root of the problem. Its record

is clean. It cannot be reproached with having exploited
the workers’ illusions for temporary advantage. And
it alone, among all the parties claiming to represent la-
bor’s interests, enjoys this distinction.

We do not doubt that human intelligence will rise
to a mastery over the social blight of racism that class
rule nourishes and keeps alive. Or that generations yet
unborn will bracket it with other barbarous supersti-
tionsi abandoned by the race in its onward march. But
whether the happy day will dawn soon, or whether new
and darker chapters will be written before the advent
of a ‘prejudice-free society, will depend on the energy

with which enlightened men'of good-will devote them- .

selves to this great and good cause. The perceptible
m-ilitancy among Negro workers particularly, and the
soberness with which they are grappling with the prob-
lems confronting them, give rise to the hope that they

Will so-on give to the Socialis-t movement a powerful im-
petus by taking their place in the embattled ranks of
classconscious labor. As De Leon observed forty years

“Once on the path of progress, the Negro cannot
long remain out of the Socialist camp. Well may the
Socialist camp make ready to receive this division of
the army of the proletariat that has been wandering in
the Wilderness since 1865.” ii

2 Pointing up the C.I.O.’s attitude toward proposals to relax
seniority rules in favor of “proportional” lay-offs should not be
construed as an expression of preference for the latter plan.
Both methods favor one group of workers as against another.
Both nourish the illusion among the favored workers that they
have some sort of proprietary interest in their jobs. Both are
premised on acceptance of the capitalist system. But it is the
capitalist system that is responsible for involuntary idleness.
A real solution for the problem of jobs, therefore, presupposes

the abolition of capitalism. Seniority and “proportional” lay- A

offs both tend to divide the workers and obscure this goal.

FASCISM IS STILL A MENACE
' By Eric Haas

The military defeat of the Axis and the deaths of Hitler and
Mussolini didn't end fascism. Fascism “is not the reﬂex of
wicked, brutal and power-drunk individuals." It “is the reﬂex
of a dying social system"—-of capitalism. This documented
pamphlet traces the capitalist causes of fascism. It shows
that the familiar Nazi-Fascist trimmings are incidental to the
industrial-feudal content, and that U.S. capitalism is already
on the path taken by German ‘and Italian capitalism.

RACISM AND THE SOCIAL QUESTION

It is not possible to exaggerate the importanceto
the workers of understanding the cause and cure of
race prejudice. The reason is obvious. If the workers
can be kept divided against themselves in the crucial
juncture of history which lies ahead, _the system of class
rule will ride out the storm and condemn another gen-
erationor generations to the miseries and degradation
of war and poverty. It is true that the capitalist class
faces seemingly insoluble economic problems, But the
experience of the totalitarian nations has shown that,
despite the insoluble nature of these problems, class
rule can be prolonged indeﬁnitely, if only the Working
clas-s can be prevented from organizing its immense po-
tent-ial power. Nazi capitalism demonstrated race
prejudice to -be one of the most effective means for
keeping the workers divided and impotent.

. In the final analysis, the workers represent the only
force in society which can or will destroy the capitalist
monopoly over the means of life. The workers alone
possess the energy and, potentially, the will, to release
the forces of progress from the shackles private prop-
erty puts upon them. Therefore, if the workers are not
organized to act to make the means of wealth-produc-

tion their collective property when the tide of historic-

opportunity is at its crest, the beneﬁciaries of capitalism
will prolong their system———-this time in the despotic
form pioneered by the -capitalist totalitarian nations.

THE MEANING OF PREJUDICE

Before we can understand “race prejudice,” we
must first unders-taznid the meaning of “prejudice.”

Literally “prejudice” means preconceived opinion.
It is the opposite of reason; it is unreason. A person
who is prejudiced against Negroes, for example, be-
lieves what he wants to believe. He accepts the evi-
dence of his senses uncritically as long as it seems to
justify his prejudice. The prejudiced person reasons
thus: ‘

The Negro is unemployed—therefore he is indo-
lent. -
The Negro is forced into arduous, menial jobs—
therefore, he hasn’t the ca'pacity to perform operations
requiringintelligence and skill. ‘ e '

The Negro is compelled to live in black ghettos-—-
therefore he brings down property values.

The Negro’s life is shortened by malnutrition and
extreme poverty—therefore he succumbs more readily
to disease and is dangerous to be around.

And. so on. i j i

The prejudiced person who accepts this prima facie
evidence more often -than not resents being shown that
his senses deceive him. He believes that the Negro is
more lawless than the white man. If you try to dis-
abuse him of this prejudice and show him that the
Negro only seems to be more lawless because he is
more often arrested, convicted and mobbed, he is apt
rather to be angry than chastened. The reason for this
irrational reaction is not ignorance alone. For, while

‘it is true, as John Bright put it, that “Ignorance is the

mother of prejudice,” it is also true, nine times out of
ten, that material interest, or what the prejudiced per-
son conceives to be his material interest, is its father.

4

 

 

 

For example, the white worker who is not classcon-
scious, who is stuffed with economic superstitions and
capitalist habits of thought, who, in short, accepts the
capitalist system as a going concern, believes it to be in
his interest to keep Negroes from competing for his
job. He will support the “lily white” policy of his
union. And he -will repeat all the myths and legends.
about the Negroes to justify this policy. Nor will he
welcome a refutation of them. Experience has shown
that it is not enough to disprove the fiction of “race in-'
feriority.” Prejudice persists in spite of scientific dem-
onstrations that there are no hierarchies of physical,
mental or cultural ability in so-called races.

UOATION IN RACE NOT ENOUGH
This is not to say that education in the fallacy of

racist theories is unimportant. Such education knocks -

the pseudo-scientific props out from under the argu-
ments of-the race mongers. It holds them up to ridi-

cule and exposes them as purveyors of hateful -and _

malignant lies. But -it does not destroy the incentive
to prejudice. It does not supply the kind of enlighten-
ment that erases prejudice from the minds of workers.
For that kind of enlightenment we must turn from biol-
ogy to economics, from ethnological research to a study
of the social forces at work in our society. We must
demonstrate that what the nonclassconscious white
worker conceives to be his material interest is at war
with his real, his class, interest. We must show that,
inexcluding the Negro worker from competition, he is
helping to weld more securely the shackles on his own
limbs, that he is exchanging real freedom for a little

_ temporary, and illusory, safety.

“. . . .to understand race conﬂict,” wrote Professor

 

Ruth Benedict in her book “Race: Science ‘and Pol-
itics,” “We need fundamentally to understand conflict
and not racef.”_ In other words, While conflict remains,
education concerning “race” cannot put an end to race
conflict. The validity of this view was evident in the
wartime discussions in several C.I.Q._uni~ons over the
policies to be adopted to handle postwar lay-offs.

A QUESTION or BREAD AND BU'l'1‘ER

Most unions have aggressively combatted. race
prejudice ‘within their ranks. ‘Some have even.cir-
culated literature, such as the famous Public Affairs
pamphlet by Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish on “The
Races of Mankind,” to disprove and discredit: raci-st.
theories. Notwithstanding this, prejudice -persists. It
manifested itself in wartime by strikes of white; work-_
ers_ in protestagainst the hiring’-and upgrading of Ne-
gro workers.- And. it manife-sted itself also in the shap-

. ing of union plans forjp-ostwar lay-offs.

1Und'er prevailing seniority rules, the workers hired
last are “bumped” first. As a very high percentage of
Negro. workers were hired last, they were anxious to
have the seniority rules adjusted so as to maintain the
wartime proportion of Negro to white workers. But
the white majority resisted the proposal, for the obvi-
ous reason that its adoption ‘would. have lessened their
own chances of‘ keeping a job; :At a national conven-

tion of one C.I.O. uni-on‘ where the priopousitiozn came

up and. was rejected for a pious, but meaningless reso-
lution ‘.‘in favor of maintaining employment gains made

R-by-Negro workers,” a defetniderl. of seniori-ty rules ex-

or N

 

 

 

claimed: “This is a matter of -bread and butter, not
prejudice?” _ i

The point is, however, that it is-a matter that pro-
vokes prejudice. The competition for jobs——t-he con-
ﬂict—-has not been lessened by the C.I.O.’s attempts to
educate its members in the fallacy of racism. On the
contrary, the C.I.O. more than nullifies its efforts in
this direction by accepting capitalism as the permanent
basis of society. T-hereby it accepts the conﬂic-ts engen-
dered by capitalism, including that of job-rivalry be-
tween Negroe-s and whites, _males and females, veterans
and non-veteran-s, etc. In disclaiming racial prejudices,
on the one hand, and in insisting on the class-sundering
seniority principle, on the other, the C.I.O. leaders con-
vict themselves of hypocrisy. -

A PART OF THE SOCIAL QUESTION
Our premise, and a premise we intend to prove to

the hilt in this essay, is that Socialism alone.

can effectively banish race prejudice from the minds of
men and convert them into rational social beings. VVe
shall ‘demonstrate that race prejudice grew out of cer-
tain historic developments in the evolution of society
and that in its modern manifestations it is a reﬂex of
capitalist conditions. For the so-called race question is
an integral part of the Social Question. It has no solu-
tion independent from the Social Question.‘ —..It will be
solved when prejudice-breeding competition and conﬂict

i give way to the higher principle of cooperatiorn, and

not until then.

Socialism will free the productive forces from the
restrictions of a capricious capitalist market and bring
to rich fulﬁllment the promise of abundance f-or all and

human happiness. Because a saneand rational society ,
