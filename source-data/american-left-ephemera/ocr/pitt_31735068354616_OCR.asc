tors reached a settlement hard
on the heels of the Phelps-Dodge
agreement which had been ap-
proved just a week earlier.

The AS&R settlement was an-
nounced by Int’l secretary-treas-
urer M. E. Travis, AS&R bargain-
ing coordinator, from Tacoma,
_.._ . ‘where the AS&R Council had
 , been in negotiations with the
company for"thre’e days. The P-D
settlement had been announced
earlier by vice president Orville
Larson, Mine-Mill national bar-
gaining coordinator.

terms were being submitted to

for ratification as THE UNION
went to press. » - ‘
THE BREAK -THROUGH in.
'AS&R and P-D meant that Ana-
conda Copper Mining Co. wasithe
only remaining “hold-out” among
the “Big Four” giants of the non-

ment with Kennecott had been
reached late in August. _

 for the company’s Tacoma plant,
.Will be applied as the “pattern”
for the entire chain, according to
the agr e e m e nt made with
R. Worth Vaughn, the company’s
' general counsel and vice presi-
-T dent. ’

 Bisbee, ,Arizona, and ’

in value. In addition, the pact
calls for improvements in health
and welfare, including disability
and death and dismemberment

‘ insurance, and for 3 weeks’ vaca-

tion after 15 years service. The
insurance‘ and other “fringe”
benefits were worth about one
cent. '

A company-paid ‘pension plan
providing for $1 a month in bene-
fits for each year of service was
also negotiated. It will cover all
those workers not already cov-
ered bythe Company’s contribu-
tory pension, as well as those
who want to drop out of the
compnay’s plan. Contributions of
those remaining under the com-
pany’s plan will be reduced. The
overall pension settlement is
estimated at Well over 41/2 cents
in value.

The money provisions of the
AS&R pact, with the exception
of the pension, are retroactive to
July 1. The contract runs‘ for two
years, with a reopener at the end
of one year.

The P-D agreement calls for
across-the-board wage increases
of 8 cents an hour, 7% cents an
hour in reclassifications, and 2
cents an hour additional for
lower worker classifications The
extra hike in the lower worker

..rates amounts to an overall

average of 14, cent. A pension
plan, which the company says
will cost about 4% cents an hour,
is also a part -of the settlement.

Meanwhile, a leaﬂet campaign
conducted‘ by the two biggest
Mine-Mill locals in the Coeur

ators of the district agreed to

and talk when they saw that an
attempted “blitz” red-baiting
campaign against the union was
a complete flop.

HERE IN DENVER, a federal
district judge announced that
September 5 was the legal date
on which the Taft-Hartley in-
junction ordered by President
Truman went into effect. The
announcement was a formality,
to provide a basis on which to
calculate the expiration of the
80-day “cooling off” period en-
forced by the injunction. It meant
that regardless of what happens
in the, meantime, Justice Depart-
ment representatives will have to
go into court-on November 24
and request that the“ injunction
order be lifted.

Most of the injunction-bound
locals reportedthat the 80-day
period was being used to

preparation for strike action
after Nov. 24, if necessary.

‘NELSON, B. C.-—Workers at the

Ho"Ba Mine near here are covered by .

their first ' union agreement, as the
result of negotiations concluded with
the management of the Consolidated
Mining & Smelting Co., which owns
the property. , '

The wage increase embodied in the
pact brings the miners rate to‘ $11.68
per shift on days, and $12.16 on the
intermediate shift. The average wage
increase comes to 16- cents anhour.
Taken together’ with the health and
hospitalization features of the con-
tract, which brings H. B. Mine work-
ers to the same level as their brothers
ingffrail and Kimberley, the package
totals 193/, cents an hour. And this
does not include the 7'/; cent interim

T -adjustment which now becomes a part

of’ the base rate.

The agreement also provides for
six holidays with pay, double time
if worked. Vacation pay will amount

' to two weeks’ after two years ser-
vice. The shift differentials were hiked ‘

to 4 cents an hour forthe afternoon

shift, ‘6 cents for the intermediate

BAYARD, N. M. -——The tension,
drama» and violence of the Empire Zinc
strike still grips Grant County as the
year—old walkou of Mine-Mi11’s Local
890 continued to shut off all production
at the operations of the New Jersey
Zinc 'company’s, subsidiary.

These were the developments in the
last two weeks;

1. Mrs. Virginia Jenck, wife of Int’!
Rep. Clinton Jenck, was found gtiilty in
a Silver City courtroom on a charge of

..“touching David Gray,” butcher em-
ployed by a picketed grocery store '

whose owners are working hand in
glove with Empire to break the strike.
Mrs. Jenck was beaten up and her" 12-
year-old daughter, Linda, attacked by

hoodlumswho descended on the picket _

line to disperse it. The attractive Mrs.
Jencks suffered a black eye and back
injuries in the fighting. Her attacker
still goes free.

2. Rudy Chapin, 14-year-old strike
supporter, was given a suspended one-

 

  .   .lencks' wife convicted for y
Touching’ man who beat her

/

 

year sentence in reform school for aid-
ing_ the strikers. I

3. Local 890 exposed the members of
the “citizen’s” delegation which called
on New Mexico’s Gov. Mechem to pro-
test that they were being “intimidated”
by strikers and their supporters. The
delegation included, among ‘others,

Marvin Mosley, scab and gunman, who ‘

blackjacked women pickets and hit -a
child with his car; -Odell Hartless, scab,
who drove a truck over a woman, hit
two others, and then shot a bystander
in the leg; Jesus Avalos, who shot at:
women and children pickets; Homer
Tibbs, scab, who drove another car
over M-rs. Martinez, breaking her leg;
and Pete Murgia, scab, who struck Lor-
-enzo Torres with an automobile, in-
juring him severely.

4. Local .890 sent a protest to the
Federal Communications Commission
for the “summary removal of union

- programs from the air” by Silver City's

radio station ,KSIL.”

W-itchl1unters seek new victims
among militant labor leaders

In discussing the 1950-51 large-scale
offensive against the Bill of. Rights,

President Clark told the recent 47th I‘

Mine—Mill convention at Nogales, Ariz.,
that not a single enemy of labor had
been prosecuted because of the hys-
terical frameups, but that every victim
of the witchhunt was in some manner
identified with the labor movement.
Recent developments on the civil rights
front document the accuracy of the
Mine-Mill president*s charge.

The latest gimmick in the frenzied
drive of the employers to transform
the labor movement into a gigantic

company union without independence _

or courage has been the impanelling of
a Federal grand jury in New _York to
“investigate” the non-Communist affi-

davits which trade union officers have

filed under the Taft-Hartley law.

Donald Henderson and James Dur-
kin, two officers of the Distributive,
Processing and Office Workers of
America; Julius Emspak and James
Matles, offiicals of the United Elec-
trical, Radio and Machine Workers,
and officials of the International Fur
and Leather Workers were called last
month to appear -before the Taft—Hart-
ley grand jury. According to Union
Voice, official organ of the DPOWA,
“the quizzing of Henderson, Durkin
and others before a grand jury seems
to signal the beginning of the next
stage of the conspiracy.”

ACCORDING to the union’s news-
paper, the:.,trade unionists thus sum-
moned “are among those now being
singled out for attack,-with threats of
jail sentences dangled over their heads,
for the ‘crime’ of resisting the\ com-
pany union scheme.” ’

“What is their aim in singling out
a group of union leaders,” asks‘Union

'Voice. “Are they simply after a hand-

Big wage gain‘
won in Calgary

CALGARY, Alberta —- Mine-Mill’s
autumn wage drive in Alberta Was
opened with a smashing victory in a

‘settlement reached last week with Cal-

gary Iron Works, calling for an~~av-
erage wage increase of 26 cents an
hour. .

The new agreement sets a base la-
bor rate of $1.34 an hour and a. trades-
man’s rate of $1.70, and includes such
other features as paid statutory holi-
days, shift differentials, two weeks’
paid vacations and double time for
overtime.

Int’l rep. Willim Longridge pointed
out that the wage rates in this plant
have been uppfed 84 cents an hour
since‘ 1946, and said other benefits
won by the union in the same period
are Worth another 10 cents an hour.

_ SPOKESMAN for Local 800 in bar-.
gaining sessions which led to the

agreement were William Breckenridge,
John Thacker, John Danci, local presi-
dent Robert Michel and Int’l rep. Long-
ridge. ' '
Bargaining is still in progress with
other companies in the, industry, after
the union members rejected as totally
inadequate “an offer by 
Bridge Co., Riverside Iron & Engin-
eering‘ -Works, - and Riverside‘ 
Ltd.,, all of which“ wo.u1d- have ’ tied

ful of men, with the purpose of put-
ting them in jail? Not likely. . . .
They hope, by inflict2'71.g' penalties on
a Henderson or a Durkin to scare all
of us, and create fear and distrust,
suspicion and panic in our -ranks. If
they can divide us, make ‘us turn on
each other, the goal of the union-
haters will have been won. ‘

“They want to make us afraid, so
that./we’ll be zmwilling to fight ‘for
decent conditions in our shops and
plants. They want to divide us, so
that we’ll be unable to protect each
other against the whims of any boss.

“They want to create panic in our
ranks, so that we’ll be unable to act
effectively against the llair-raising
revelations. of graft and corruption

that are being exposed every day in 1

local as well as national politics.”
Graft and corruption, it might be
added, which attends the most hysteri-'
cal war drive in American history.

THE TAFT-‘HARTLEY scheme is
aimed at the membership of the mili-
tant unions, "the Union Voice declares,
and “if this rotten conspiracy does
succeed in scaring us, in making us
turn tail and run, each one of us and
our fawnilies will suffer. —The price
they’ll make us pay will be felt in
terms o_f less food to eat, less shoes
and clothing for the kids, less security
on the job. These things don’t have to
happen. We can defeat this shameful
scheme . . . and we can come out of
this attack, as some,of us have done
before, .st'rouger and better united,
and with‘ greater gains than when the
a.tta.cks began.”

The grand j.ury’s summons to.Em-
spak and Matlesiwas timed to coin-
cide with an NLRB election at the
-S¢he11ecta.dy, N. ,Y., General Electric
plant where UE was being raided ‘by
Jim Carey’s Imitation U.E. (IUE) and

boss-dominated unions. UE
scored a 2‘/2 to 1 victory. V

Steel to shame at‘ Laurel Hill

LAUREL HILL, N. Y.—~—How would
you feel as a Laurel Hill P-D worker
to find out you had been sold an 11%
.cent package as a “victory” of Steel-
workers unionism, only to learn that
the copper union you had,,.been misled
away from, Mine-Mill, was ableoto
reach a settlement with the same com-
pany in behalf of all the rest of the
P-D,'workers in the country for 20%
cents an hour?

The workers here at the Phelps
Dodge refinery have learned the hard
way that they were led out on a limb

by C10 Steel and that the company

V. has promptly cut off the limb. This is
.;,—ui'e',1oco1 which, until last year, was
part of llline-Mill and the P-D Coun-

cil, united with the rest of the work-
ers in the copper industry—until their
local “leader,” Ed Murphy, sold them
out-to the Steel raiders.

Only this year, when they faced the
P-D company alone with only the
Steel big shots to “plead” their case,
did the ex-membersof Mine-Mill find
out that wage negotiations can only
be as successful as the unity and
strength of the union behind them.

WITH THE OLD Mine-Mill contract
expired on July 1 and the blundering

New contract won A A

by Sudbury waiters

SUDBURY, Ont.——Negotiations be-
tween Mine-Mill Local 902 and 17
Sudbury district hotels for a new
contract covering more than 120 bev-
erage room waiters ended last week
in .agreement on a general. wage in-
crease, reduced working/ hours and
other improvements in working con-
ditions.

Talks“had broken off during nego-
tiations, and the hotel operators pre-
pared for conciliation in the contract
dispute, but the workers were deter-
mined to «prevent lengthy conciliation
proceedings denying them a contract.

.Under the new contract wages for
waiters were increased by $3.25 a week
and head waiters $4.75." Tapmen‘ will
now receive $56 a‘ week with head
tapmen getting $58. Working hours
were reduced from 48 to 46 a week

while those now working less than

the 46 hours will not have their.work-
ing hours increased. Employers agreed

_ also that wherever possible hours will

be reduced below the 46 per week
which is now a maximum under the
new contract.

A SICKNESS and accident policy
covering all beverage room waiters
was improved with higher benefits
provided and. employers agreed to
continue paying half the cost of the
plan.

An agreement signed earlier be-
tween Local 902 and Local 598 for
the beverage room waiters in the
Mine-Mill Hall, resulted in wages of
$49»for waiters and $60 for tapmen.
This agreement gives the waiters $3
a week more and the tapmen $4 more

_ than the hotels. ’

A first agreement was concluded
with the Smith and Travers (diamond
drillers)'for the field inen which pro-
vides for compulsory dues payment,
vacations of one week after one year
and two weeks after five years of
service; agreement to negotiate a

, ‘Welfare and/or a -pension plan with
 the ‘company paying" half the cost;

shift premiums ‘of 3 cents and 5 cents

if ' ‘an liour for afternoon and graveyard
. shifts"; wage increases ranging from
 cents to 28 cents an hour.-

  
 

Steel union as their ineffectual bar-
gaining opponent, the Phelps-Dodge
Company had the Laurel Hill workers
just where they wanted ‘them. The
company, bloated with_ super.-profits,
tossed a bone to Murphy and’ his Steel
union and told them they could take
it or leave it. 7
What could Murphy and his Steel
bureaucrats do for the Laurel Hill
workers V alone? V
tried ‘to alibi that this was all the
Wage Stabilization Board would al-
low. so allllthe Laurel Hill I”-D work-
ers got in a- secretly signed contract
on August 3 was a nickel across‘ the
board and 6'/; cents'in fringes-a to-

" tal package of 111/; cents.

The handwriting on the wall expos-

ting the Steel sellout at Laurel Hill

became clear as soon as news of. the
national strike called by Mine-Mill
throughout the copper industry spread
in the plant. With the second news
broadcast describing the complete sol-
idarity and effectiveness of the Mine-
Mill strike, Ed Murphy was a hard
guy to find. Laurel Hill workers say
Murphy went into. hiding for three
days. Story is he was drowning his
sorrows, trying to escape the facts of
life.

NO MATTER HOW hard he tries,
Murphy and his Steel “benefactors”
are having one miserable time trying
to alibi away ~the 9 cent an hour loss
in pay suffered by Laurel Hill work-
ers in comparison with the people rep-
resented by Mine-Mill in all the other
P-D properties.

What is even worse about the Steel
settlement,at Laurel Hill is the fact
that it did NOT include 41/; cents’ an
hour for a pension plan which ~Mine-
Mill won ON TOP‘ of 16 cents in cash
and fringes. ’

The sleeper in the Steel contract is
that Laurel Hill gets no pension at all,
or, if they do get it, then -they, lose
41/.» cents out of the nickel an hour
wage increase that Steel signed for.
In other words, the total general wage
increase at Laurel Hill will be exactly
one-half of ‘one cent an hour!

Detailed news of the Mine-Mill set-
tlement in tlie“rest of the copper in-
dustry is rapidly becoming general
knowledge around. the Laurel Hill
plant, despite the smokescreen which
Murphy and Steel have tried to put
up to hide their own miserable sell-
out. The Laurel Hill workers are

' ’learning fast that their best interests

always WERE served and can only BE
served by unity. with all the other
copper workers in the country repre-
sented by the only copper workers un-
ion—Mile-Mill. '

Precision workers win
case. give l-os'l'rikers—

CHICAGO, Ill.-—Winning an arbitra-

worked below the union scale, a group
of Precision Scientific company work-
ers last week donated a total of $128

die cast strikes. The workers are mem-
bers of Mine-Mill's‘ Chicago Amalga-
mated Local 758. "

The workers -were getting paid from
seven to 28_cents below the scale and
the union filed a grievance which final-
ly went to arbitration and victory.
Checks totalling $350 were received by
the workers, covering back pay. They

Tacoma local fights to’

TACOMA, Wash. — If A m e ri c a n
Smelting and Refining Company offi-
cials had any fleeting notions that they

could" use President Truman’s Taft-'

“Hartley injunction to break down the
Mine-Mill grievance procedure at the
Tacoma smelter, they do not entertain
such ideas now. Tacoma Smelterman’s
Union No. 25 has demonstrated Mine-
Mill’s determination not to permit its
unity and fighting spirit to be weak-
ened by the injunction. '

It was on Sept. 19 and 20 that men
in the carpenter and brick mason
gangs were ordered-to work the sixth
day. Most of them refused. The master
mechanic ranted that. the workers
were unpatriotic. Thirty-six men were
given warning slips under what the
plant managers call their “rules of
conduct” which the union has been
fighting for years. Thfeemen, Robert
Schanzenback, George Peters and Art
Ellison were given threeiday “disci-
plinary” layoffs.

Local 25 distributed a leaflet, in.-

. forming its members of the company’s

action "and suggesting’ that the other
workers help pay for the lost time of
the laid-off trio. The local officers
presented the company with a griev-
ance which read:

“The union-' would like to know un-
der what clause in the existing verbal
contract where the management is
permitted to discipline an employee
for refusing to work the sixth day by
giving him three days off. We demand
the ‘employees who have been given
three days off be paid for the dura-
tion of their compulsory absence.“

Plant manager Marble called up the

unionto tell Mine-Mill leaders that the

grievance was a “breach of the in-
junction” and that he was calling in
U. S. Conciliation. The union stuck to
its guns in characterizing the beef as
a regular plant grievance. Conciliator
Tutt said there would be _no talk of
the injunction, but the federalmedia-~
tors remained to participate in the
talks. -

Following a hectic session,- marked
by verbal fireworks, AS&R finally

gave in, rescinding the disciplining of 

the three workers and paying them for

all lost time. - - E 
The next morning, the. union distrib-

"uted another leaﬂet informing the
* workers of the union’s victory. Marble’
Wanted _

, keep grievance set-up

to prefer charges against the union

for distributing the leaflet. Conciliator

Tutt told Marble the union had the
right to-do so, suggesting politely that
the quick-tempered company official
should turn over union leaflets to the
blank side if the printed matter dis-
turbed him so much.

Resume wage talks

in Coeur d Alenes

WALLACE, Idaho——Coeur d’Alene
mining operators have agreed to re-
sume contract negotiations with Mine-
Mill Monday,
the failure of an all out red-baiting
attack against the union and its
leadership.

The attack took the form of an- of-
ficially-proclaimed “Anti-Communist
Week,” with a parade and "meeting
here, as well as publication by the lo-
cal anti-union newspapers of C10
“trial” committee testimony. ~

The only workers who participated
in the widely-advertised “anti-Com-
munist” meeting were discredited
company stooges. There was not 'a
single honest unionist in the Coeur
d’Alene district who was fooled about

the purpose of the meeting and of the

campaign.

REPLYING vigorously to the oper-
ator’s offensive, Mine-Mill Locals 14
and 118 used leaflets and its. three-
wtime-a-week radio program to call at-
tention to the fact that lead and 'zinc
prices have advanced 2 cents a pound,
despite the fact that the companies
had granted no wage increase in ne-
gotiations which began last spring.

October’ 8, following"

   

   

r

The two Coeur d’Alene locals‘ also

pointed to the failure of the company-

inspired red-baiting attacks and called» '

for renewal of , bargaining. Meantime,
members of ' Locals 14 ‘and 18 went
ahead with plans for the resumption
of their strikefollowing expiration of

the Taft-Hartley injunction on Nov 

vember 24 -- if necessary.

~--There is no relief ’ in

 

HE WAR PROGRAM is now running at $50

billions a year. By next July it will be $65
billion. As the Journal of Commerce editori-
‘alized on July 24‘: .“The cost of the defense pro-
gram goes up each time President Truman is-
sues a progress report on how it is going.”

It is difficult to comprehend what 65
A billions_ of ;dollars means. ‘

‘ ,A worker can‘ begin to get a dim idea in_

terms of his own life. The average manufac-
turing’ worker now gets about $64 for working
a Eiweekp--$3,328 for working a full year, if he’s
lucky ‘enough, to have a steady job. In his
whole lifetime,‘ let us say 40i-years of steady
work, ‘he might make $133,12 . ' '

T Let us assume you and your father and
your grandfather, etc., going way back, all
worked out their lifetimes at this rate of pay.
Actually, they earned far less. But to reach
the total of one billion dollars by 1951, when
do you think one of your ancient ancestors
would have had tostart work?

When the Declaration of Independence was
signed in 1776? No, for even if your great,
great, great grandfather. had begun working

 

then, the total wouldbe about half. a million, '

dollars.

When Columbus discovered America in
1492? No.‘ The total would only be about 1%
million dollars. ~ ‘

When Christ was born, 1,951 years ago?
‘Hardly. The total would still .be only 61/;
million dollars. :

If ‘one of your ancestors helped build the
ancient pyramids in Egypt in 3000 B.C.--the
total now would be no more than 16%; million
dollars. ‘ ' .-

. To reach the total of 1 billion dollars by‘
1951, one of‘ your,primordial.ancest0rs in the

Pleistocene era, long before the dawn of writ-
ten history, some 300,000 years before the birth
of Christ, would have-had to begin working.

Another way to ‘comprehend the fantastic
costs, of war is to compare the cost of planes,
—guns and-tanks with the cost of things we are
familiar with and need-—like homes, schools,

—. old age pensions, etc.

Imagine a B-36 bomber—-pa little speck in

in the sky above a town. of 350 new homes

housing 1,750 people. I
The bomber costs $31/_;; million.

The 350 homes cost $31/2’ million, figuring it

at $10,000 per home.

;0ne air group? _or solution,
of our housingprolzlcms ?_

, One-air “wing” orlgroup, costs 1% billion
‘dollars. . r '
Federal subsidies to reach the desperately»
needed level of two million new homes" per
year, plus Federal outlays. to clear all the
slums that bhght our cities, and plus subsi-
dies to start a low-cost public housing program
would also cost-1"!/2 billion dollars a year.

“maintain” such an air force. This is almost
enough to wipe out poverty completely in the
United States. There are 26% million families
in this country, two-thirds of the total, with
incomes below $4,526, the level of health and
decency. This is the Heller Budget-standard
adjusted to April, 1951,'for changes in ‘prices
andtaxes. Over one-fourth of all families earn
less than one-half the amount required for
health and decency. A - ‘

It would cost about $50 billion a year.to‘

bring- all U.S. families. up to levels of health
and decency, according to the authoritative
budget issued by the.Heller Committee’ of the
University of California.

Just “maintaining” a huge air force—or
"eliminating the curse of poverty once and for
all—the costis about the same. 5

‘One destroyer costs_ $40,000,000-—'enough to

A We’ could go oniand on. One more example
and we’re done; The Navy ‘spends $333’ less for

$3,083, the Cadillac $2,750. "This was revealed
by Frederick Othman, c'olumnist'in the S. F.
News on August 3, who concluded: “. '. . what
a taxpayer doesn’t know doesn’t hurt him, ex-
cept inkthe pocketbook, silently.”

,., WAR DESTROYS the accumulated weath -
which we already have. Wein America have
no realization of what this means. ’ None of us
has gone through the experience of.hundre,d»s‘
of millions ‘of Europeans. None of us knows
what it means to be bombed out; to live in a
wet cellar for years; to walk a longidistance .
for water because the water system hasbeen

lights because the ‘power system has been
destroyed; and to Walk to work‘ because the
transportation system can’t ‘carry you. Just
to rebuild what is destroyed takes entire na-
tions years and years of work. V

" Work is the key tolliteall

It is so -easy to. become confused when the’
cost of war is measured in financial terms_—-
in complicated taxes of all sorts. When you
come down to fundamentals, the cost is--work. '
It is our work which creates War machines. It
is our work which creates ‘the value withwhich’
we pay taxes to pay for war machines. It is
our Work which creates the profits with- which
the employers pay their taxes to- pay for war
machines. And it is only our work which will‘
rebuild the houses and-, factories and roads
destroyed by war machines. ’

When we say that a B-36 bomber costs as
much as 350 homes, we are saying roughly that
the same amount of work‘ is involved. (This is
probably _not strictly . true_—- perhaps , because
there’s less workand more profits in the B-36'
bomber. That’s Why US. business prefers war

' production.) . , .

Andxthis should make Workers pause and
ponder; Some workers have the illusion that a
job is a job—whether it’s building bombers or
homes. Some workers’ spread their calloused
hands and say, “That’s all I have to show for a
lifetime of work—so what difference what I
make?”  . .. ,-

But there’s an enormous difference. You
-may possibly live in one of those 350 homes-—
if you have peace and fight for adequate wages
through your union. You can never possibly
live in a B-36 bomber.

The work involved in building homes, hos-

’ . pitals, schools, providing adequate old age pen-

 can say" ‘what the -‘:.ult_imate

sions,’ maternity care, 'children’s' allowances,
unemployment benefits, etc., etc.—-will buy
‘immediate benefits to-all workers, Whether it
appears in your pay envelope or"not. You will
have something -to show for your callouses. '
Your standard of living will advance greatly._

‘ On the other hand, work on a war. program
has already caused a drop in your real standard
of living. Horsemeat used to "be food for dogs.
Horsemeat consumption is booming—and it’s
not dogs—-nor the rich" who have beguneating ‘
it. As the war program grows bigger and‘
bigger, living standards will fall more and

to work of Auxiliaries

By Mildred Smofhermon _
U. S. Director, Mine-Mill Auxiliaries

NOGALE$~ Ariz.—'Delegates from
Mine-Mill Au ' iaries of the United
States and Canada heard president
John Clark pledge “the fullest co-
operation possible” by officers and
staff of the International Union for
the coming year, to encourage and aid

' the work of the Ladies Auxiliaries.

Clark spoke at the closing session of
the Auxiliaries annual convention, held
simultaneously with the 47th Mine-
Mill convention here.

The main actions of the Auxiliary
Convention dealt with plans for an or-
ganizational drive next year, and de-
cisions on ways and means of imple-
menting, in our local auxiliaries, the

‘ program adopted by our convention.

Our program contains the’ following-
ob,ecti‘ves: support of our parent or-
gsnization, the IUMM&SW, morally
and financially; study and action‘ on
price controls and. consumer problems;

study and action on political and legis- v

lative problems; work on organization;
education; child care;‘ teen-age prob-
lems and nurseries; community work;
health; housing; racial problems;
world peace; and homecrafts.

Several’ resolutions covering’ various
points of this program 'were adopted
by the Auxiliary Convention.

JESSICA RHINE, secretary to the
International secretary-treasurer of
IUMM&SW, gave some very valuable\
suggestions on organization and edu-
cation. ' 1 V

Resolutions for a five-power peace
conference, repeal of the Taft-Hartley,

‘Smith and McCarran acts, and for

closer coordination of the work of the

auxiliaries in states and regions on
legislative matters, and establishment
of an educational program for_auxili-
aries, were passed.

Several reconimendations, concerning
the Auxiliary were made for the con-
sideration of the International officers
an executive board members by the
delegates at the Auxiliary Convention.

Suggested amendments to the.Con-
stitution were also - considered and
acted upon.‘ - 4 5

Mildred Sinothermon, director of
Mine-Mill Auxiliaries for the U. S.,
presided as chairman of the conven-
tion, in the absence of Dorothy Mc-
Donald, chairman of Mine-Mill Auxili-
aries, who was unable’ to reach
Nogales for the convention because of
last-minute transportation difficulties.
Eleanor Salkind of Carlsbad was con-
vention ‘secretary.

Delegates were:_ Belva Downing,

Launch welfare program
. at Falconbridge mines

SUDBURY——The battle for “medi-
cal-welfare” protection for employees
of Falconbridge Nickel Mines, waged
by Local 598 for several years, came
to a successful conclusion last Week
with agreement on an all-inclusive plan

that provides adequate protection for '

all employees and their families.

The new plan, approved by Falcon-A 

bridge employees at membership meet-
ings, includes:

1. A sickness and accident policy
which provides for $25 a week for 13
weeks of non-compensable sickness or
accident.

2. Blue Cross: semi-private wards
for all married employees- and depend-
ents. ‘ Single employees may subscribe
to standard wards if they wish.

3. Participation in the Local 598
Welfare Plan. -

4. Continuation ofthe medical plan

Cost of all theselprovisions, with the

‘exception of the Local 598 Welfare

Plan, is covered on a 50-50 basis by the.
company and the employees. The_Lo-
cal 598 Welfare Plan is solely a union
responsibility and is carried ‘ by a
monthly assessment of 50 cents for
each member of Local 598.

Apart from the medical plan for em-
ployees only, made_ compulsory by Pro-
vincial Statute. covering unorganized '
territories and an inadequate sickness
and accident policy, Falconbridge em-
ployeesand their families had no other
protection for several years. Efforts

4' . by Local 598 .to improve this situation

made slow progress with the first break"
on ‘the inauguration of Blue Cross for
which the company paid only half of
standard ward premium.“ _

This was followed by the setting up
of a welfare plan to which the men
and the company contributed "50 cents

.e'ach monthly. This was later improved

with the contribution from each in-
“eased to, $1 monthly.‘ Last vear’s
contract negotiations resulted in a pen.
sion plan for the employees.

Li-Hllei guy hil-
by ‘tax proposals

WASHINGTON — A Senate-House
conference committee last week was
trying to iron out differences between
two tax increase bills, .both of them
outrageously unfair to the small
taxpayer. ‘

The Senate saved corporations half
a billion dollars by making the new
tax retroactive to April 1 instead of
January 1, as promised ‘by the Tru-
man‘ administration. They also voted
down a _move to have taxes on divi-
dends withheld at the source, as are
taxes on wages. They refused to in-
crease the excess profits tax.

_The conference committeewas de-
ciding be/tween raising the -tax on
workers by 11 per cent, as provided by
the Senate, or 121/>. per cent as the
House voted. -

The Senate bill was slanted so much
in favor of big business that Demo-
cratic Senators Paul Douglas (Ill.),
Hubert Humphrey (Minn.) and Her-
bert Lehman (N.Y.), voted against it.-

labor convention  

A national conference ‘to “mobilize; '

the greatest organized strength of

Negro workers” in the United States A

w’ll be held in Cincinnati at theerid
of this month—O,cto.ber 27 and 28.

Calls to the Founding Convention of .l 

the National Negro Labor Council" are
being received by local unions through-
out the nation. They are signed by

William Hood, recording secretary ofn

CIO-UAW Ford—Local 600, in Detroit

who is the acting head of the Nations ‘ '

Negro Labor Council.

The calls propose that when the .
National Council is formed, it spur the  
organization of local Negro labor coun-  . "

cils, which have already been set up in
several large cities. It says:

“Negro labor councils are needed-to
forge unity of Negro and white warlo-
ers in struggle against mounting mob
violence that victimizes innocent Negro
men and women, and in struggle. to
achieve justice and Iequality as we be-
lieve true Americans liefine it.”

Citing the fact that more than -a _.
million Negroes are now in trade un- ~

ions, the call emphasizes that the na-

Anyway, here's another gem to be added to Mine-Mill’s “we -were "

right” list: y  ,
General Motors, salesman of the escalator wage clause as~Well a

motor cars, has just issued a chart dealing‘; with wage movements
U. S. since 1910. .And what does it prove? It proves that if American ,

workers had not engaged in open collective bargaining for the last 30 =

or 40 years, but had submitted instead to escala_to7's during that period,-s

wages would be substantiallylower today.’ ,

Of course, GM is not against the escalator. They producedtliijsll
chart merely to pursuade the rest of American industry to accep 

their viewpoint and to show its benefits for employers. 

And finally, GM’s Wilson (not to be confused with Mobilize
Wilson) says the escalator cost'his cgmpany 40 million bucks. while"
the extra dividend to stockholders amounted to 176 million dollars...

All this in 1950 only. ‘ .-

Are we-right in opposing the escalator clause? .And how! ‘But;
that’s not all. Let’s tie it .up. The Wage Stabilization Board recently‘

issued a revised Regulation 8 to control "wage increases. And'Regula_-K’

this problem. _
The National Wage Policy Committee
of Mine-Mill, however, faced the prob-
lem squarely, and raised the demand

‘ that injured workers get their‘ full

wages for the period that they are un-
able to work.

The night before the national copper
strike deadline, the first local in cop-
perito reach a settlement, Local 837,
came to an agreement with the U. S.

tals Refining Company, Carteret,

. J., for a 21 cent package."

One of the fringe agreements con-
stitutes a .first, but long, step in the
direction of establishing the company’s
responsibility for a worker injured in
the plant. The clause is obviously not
completely satisfactory to us. But it
is important because it breaks ground
in a "new direction. The text of the
clause is: .

“Employees who are entitled _ to
Workmen’s Compensation, due to an
injury received in this plant, shall
receive payments supplementing their
compensation payments. Such pay-
ments shall start the eighth day after
the injury occurs and shall continue
for a. period of not more than thirteen
weeks.

“Such payments shall supplement
Workmen’s Compensation so that each
hourly-paid employee shall receive the
equivalent of forty hours pay at the
straight time rate, exclusive of pre-
miums and incentives. ,. Such supple-
mental payments shall also be made
so that each salaried employee shall
receive the,equivalent on one week’s
_salary. .

“These payments ‘shall cease when
the Company’s doctorcertifies that an
employee is able to return to work.

‘Mine-Mi

Mine-Mill made labor history in

— 1951. It is still making it. Like a base-

ball team which threw off abatting
slump and went on to win the pennant,
the union this past year achieved a
new high in prestigeand praise from
workers and labor leaders all over
North America. The keynote of the
recent 47th Convention at Nogales,
Ariz., was that Mine-Mill had come
through one of t‘he most trying periods

' in its history, the winner and still

champion. .

Mine-Mill’s remarkable record in
shellacking the raiding CIO, AFL and
various company unions, plus its cheer-
provoking triumphs on the collective
bargaining front during the year, were
not achieved with mirrors, as the say-
ing goes. Offensively and defensively,
Mine-Mill was just about the best ag-
gregation to take the field against the
Wall Street Gang in many a season.
Unit/ed leadership and united member-
ship resultedlin the kind" of teamwork
that most unions dream about but
never perfect.

No single resource of the interna-
tioﬁal union was spared in winning the
fight of 1951—finances, personnel, -or
program. All of these were mobilized
and put to maximum use in achieving
victory. And the Nogales convention
registered the fact that-this champion-
ship teamwork can now be put to work
in consolidating Mine-Mi1l’s- victories
of the past_ and in scoring new gains.

DISCUSSION on the convention floor
led to a mandate that Mine-Mill in the
coming months should take up‘ the task
of bringing thousands of new "members
into the union’s ranks. Organization of
the unorganized was a task\to which
Mine-Mill was unable to devote concen-
{rated attention during the raids, the
national strike, and the 1951 bargain-
ing co-ordination. It was the delegates’
opinion, however, that victory was in

sight on the bargaining front and that ’
_future wage struggles in the industry

depended to no small extent ‘-on in-
creasing Mine-Mill’s ’ b argaining
strength with the addition of new or-
ganized plants and "operations to the
union’s contract files.

a Convention delegates‘ were sharp in
their remarks that-Mine-Mill had to

gear its financial structure to this new '
perspective. The tenor of most dis- ’

cussipn ._was that yon_can’t play rough

SUO F A. RIKES is given twhe-euyy meers of

vided for in this ‘clause cover about
95% of the lost-time injuries in -this
plant, using last year as a guide. We
still have the problem of winning pro-

BUFFALO, N. Y.—Woz;kersl at the

American Brass Company plant here"

are forbidden to strike by an 80-day
Taft-Hartley injunction. But the‘ in-

~ junction doesn’t say anything about

visions to cover workers disabled for

longer periods.

Also, the sole discretion of the Com-
pany’s doctor is naturally not com-
pletely satisfactory to us, even though
it at least means that the Company
would have to give the worker a job.

An incidental result of this kind of
contract provision is likely to be a
much more serious attit_ude by the com-
panies to the question of safety.

Most companies plaster safety no-
tices all over the plant, but they balk
at spending a few dollars for safety
equipment.

While the clause has great value in
increasing the worker’s security, the
actual cost is relatively small. The
estimated cost of this provision at
the Carteret plant is only 6/10th of a
cents per hour.

M. E. Travis put it this way in his an-
nual report: v

“We cannot stand still. Unless we
take full advantage of the victories
we have won and. ‘move ahead to
achieve greater gains for our member-
ship, we must of necessity, slip back-

“ward. During the coming year we

must consolidate our gains and take
the offensive in every field of activity.

failing to help other workers on strike
for a higher wage.

So members of ABC Local 593 con-
tributed generously when a plant gate
collection was taken recently by strik-
ersafrom the Markel Electric Company.
The Markel strikers, members of the
United Electrical Radio & Machine"
Workers, have been out since August
10, when the company fired all the of-'

»ficers and stewards of their locaL

Support for the USE strikers is also ’

coming from Mine-Mill Local 537,
which represents workers at the Sam-
uel Greenfield smelter here. Local 537
also voted unanimously to give al1—out
financial and moral support its ABC
brothers in their efforts to achieve a
“just settlement.”

The Greenfield management
agreed to grant to its workers, ‘retroac-
tive to July 1, all economic gains won
by -our union in the copper and brass

‘industry. ~

This will call for increased income and ‘

increased expenditures.”

Accordingly, the 47th Convention ap-
proved for referendum vote a 10-cent
increase in the international union’s
per capita tax, fully. confident that the
membership of Mine-Mill will approve
such an increase by an overwhelming
vote in the balloting on Monday, No-
vember 5. The 10-cent increase will
bring the per capita payment to a flat
one dollar, -one of the lowest per capita
taxes in the labor movement.

Secretary-Treasurer Travis pointed
out to the convention that “the addi-
tional per capita applied to operating
expenses still does not leaue muc
margin, so that economy and careful
scrutiny of our expenses will be con-
tinually necessary. Nevertheless, it..will
enable us to expand our activities
somewhat, and to "enter the organiza-
tional field to a broader extent than
has been for several years.” ,5)

SADLY NEGLECTED for several
years have been the earnings of staff
members and officers of the union
which have remained static in. the face

of fantastically increased living costs.
Many convention ‘speakers spoke- out
forcefully for salary increases and
none opposed such action. The conven-

tion voted to approve for referendum‘

vote‘ an amendment to the Constitu-
tion which would increase the salary
of an international representative who
has been on the payroll for six months
or more from $80 to $90 per week, and
would provide proportionate ‘increases
to officers and staff people. This "will
be Amendment No. 2. Amendment No.
1 will increase per diem expenses of
the staff from $9 a day while away
from home to $11. Amendment No. 3

‘provides for the per capita tax in-

crease of 10 cents.’

In addition to the long-overdue sal-
ary increases for staff members, it~was
stressed at the convention that more
union income is necesspry to carry on
all present union functions. An exhibit
at the convention illustrated the various
services of the international union for

which dues money is spent . These serv- -

ices and activities included organiza-
tion, collective bargaining, servicing
by representatives, education, the union
newspaper, research, conventions and
referenda, publicity, protection against
raiders, legal services, minority and
civil rights,_legislation, district co-or-
dination, the many activities of the na-
tional office, and women’s auxiliaries.

During the same week that the No’-
gales convention approved the per cap-
ita increase amendment, the CIO Oil
Workers International Union met in
its Denver convention and with-
out a rank—and-file vote voted to in-
crease its per capita to $1.40." The CIO

Rubber Workers met a week later,‘ "

boosted their per capita, again without
a referendum vote, from" 70 cents to
$1,‘ an increase of 30 cents. Neither
union has carried on the victorious bat-
tles that Mine-Mill has in the last
few years. Neither faced the raiders.
Neither scored the kind of victories
Mine-Mill did in the wage and contract
fights. __
' Now, in the words ’ of President
John Clark, “we must prepare the way
for more organizatio-n, not only with.
policy decisions,’ but alsolwith funds.

Without money, the job cannot be

  Millard admits cash sale  

Duringthe Canadian Congress of Labor convention, C. H.
‘Millard, CIO Stee1’s national director in Canada, admitted to a
reporter‘ for the Vancouver Sun that the Steel Union has spent
$550,000 in its fruitless raiding activities against Mine-Mill-.

“Despite the terrific outlay. Steel has had only moderate
success in its efforts to supplant Mine-Mill,” the Sun reported.

A In a. bald admission that the Steel union “bought” Mine-
_ Mill’s jurisdiction from the CCL, the Millard interview story
' . said: “The Steelworlcers paid the CCL almost $50,000 as reim-
bursement foriits preliminary work in reorganizing the hard- ,
rock miners and for the former M ine-M ill jurisdictional rights.”
“Another $500,000 has been spent. since,” the story added. .

The interview left unanswered several questions being
asked by the workers of Canada. They include: »

1. Why did the CCL get $50,000 for the jurisdiction of the
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers’ Union?‘

2. Why was this sum not listed on the financial statement

, of the Canadian Congress of Labor? - _ '

WASHINGTON — ’ Defense Mobi-
lizer C. E. Wilson has now set up a
new agency which will have the job
of siphoning the taxpayers money into
the. pockets of; the big metals and
mining corporations faster than before.

The agency, to be headed by Jess
Larson, is called the Defense’ Materials
Procurement Administration, and will
take over the processing of “loans”

tometal and mineral companies, which

has up to now been handled by sev-
eral agencies. ’

Larson’s assistant

drawn-out "battle against Mine-Mill Lo-
cal 82 in 1948 and 1949. Observers here
noted that Young is president of the
American Mining Congress and the
American Zinc Institute, which means

that he will act as a special govern- .

ment agent for the ‘major corpora-
tions in the industry.

Some notion of how much money
is being poured into the mining com-
panies.’ pockets by the government
can be seen by a report of the Interior

Department of “exploration contracts”
during just one month — August. Un- e
der these contracts, more than .$8.000,- .

VANCOUVER—Up until the last
hours of the eleventh annual Conven-
tion of the Canadian Congress of La.-
bor, the accustomed pattern of the last
few years was faithfully followed. _

Conventions of the CCL—which is the
CIO in.Ca'nada—have lately started
off first with the expulsion of a union,
refusal of the president to allow dis-
cussion on the act from the floor,
a pretense at allowing a union to
defend itself from charges, a reply
by Pat Conroy, and the machine votes
them out". This year it was the Fur
and Leather Workers’ Union; last
year at Winnipeg, it was the United
Electrical and Radio’ Workers’ Union;
the year before’ that at —0ttawa, it
was our Union.

After this -procedure, the Conven-
tiongets down to passing resolutions,
not the resolutions sent in by the
local unions but invariably substitute
resolutions. Ministers of the govern-
ment pat the officers on the back and

heap praises upon them, a big press’

gallery and pages in the newspapers
filled with redbaiting, and this year,
as in last year and other years, full
support for the government’s re-arm-
ament_programme, the Atlantic Pact
et_c., furnish padding .for what has

' lately been a quite futile performance.

THIS YEARS’ convention was faced

V’ with the’ growing problems of all

Canadian workers. These problems in-
cluded_ lay-offs in the auto and steel
fabricating industries and threats of
lay-offs‘ elsewhere, increased taxation
upon the workers, and the inflation
which is cutting ‘seriously into living
standards. ' '

But there’ was no deviation from
the .usual CCL convention routine in
order to meet these problems. A large

_ delegation of auto workers came from

Ford Local.i200, UAW, sent particu-
larly to the Conventionvybythe mem-
bership to ‘demand action on the lay-
offs and the high cost of living." The
rank-and-file workers in the UAW
delegation challenged the machine,
but. were riithlessly hammered down
by  R. Masher, CCL president. _

In the. plush surroundings of the

Vancouver Hotel, ‘a big ‘social pro-g ;
. gramme was ‘organized by the com-
‘mittee "in "charge, including; a’-‘ fashion
