Danville

Five workers fired two and
a half years ago by the Dan-
ville, I1l., Time-O-Matic com-
pany for leading a Mine-Mill
organizing campaign at the
plant have been ordered rein-
stated with back pay and
seniority rights by the U. S.
Court of Appeals in Chicago.

The court's ruling upheld a
decision made last summer by
the full National Labor Rela-
tions board in Washington,
D. C. which held that the com-
pany was guilty of unfair labor
practices when it “discrimin-

gately dis c ll a r g e d” the five

workers on Oct. 5, 1956, and
ordered t h e i r reinstatement-
with seniority and reimburse-
ment for loss of earnings.
Following the ‘Washington
board’s ruling, which reversed

earlier findings of an NLRB.

trial examiner that the em-
ployees were discharged for
cause, the company had re-
fused to comply and had in-
stead filed an appeal with the
Chicago court. “ s ' M
On March 6, 1959, the court
upheld the Washington Labor
board’s decision and held that
the five had been fired._"_to dis-
courage union organization”
at the plant. . ‘
The five, who headed the

‘Mine-Mill rank and file or-

ganizing committee at the
time, are Inez Combs, Louis
Kilby, Mary Marks, Richard
Eaglen and Alfred Kimberlin,
Jr.

According to Int’! Rep. Jesse
R. Van Camp, who handled the
case with active help from
Allith-Prouty Local 808 in Dan-
ville, three of the five dis-
charged workers returned to
their jobs April 10. The other
two declined to return because
of their preference for other
jobs at which they had been
working. '

Van Camp was scheduled to
meet last month with NLRB
counsel to assist all five work-
ers in figuring out how much
back pay the company owed
them. .

The Labor board has ordered
its complaint against the com-
pany to be posted in the plant
for 60 days, after which an
election is to be held.

Montana’s jobless and injured

spelled out in a statement is-
sued by the Montana Mine-
Mill Legislative committee at
its meeting in Helena April 3.

The committee, representing
miners and smeltermen in
Butte, Anaconda, Great Falls,
East Helena, Deer Lodge,
Philipsburg and Melrose, noted
achievements made by the
legislature on an occupational
disease law and significant im-
provements on measures cov-
ering unemployment compensa-
tion, workmen’s compensation
and the silicotic benefits “in
spite of the opposition by the
Republican minority and de-
fection by sgme Democrats.”

sailed by the Mine-Mill body
which also called for an inves-
tigation of the Industrial Ac-

On federal legislation, the
committee urged all locals to
organize letter-writing cam-
paigns to Congress to get the
ball rolling behind several bills
introduced in the Senate and
House which would eliminate
the age limitation on disability
and completely revise for the
better basic disability require-
ments now denying needed

Bills listed for support are:

TACOMA, Wash.——A court
decision was pending here, as
the MINE-MILL UNION went
to press, on an injunction
sought by AS&R management
to force some 700 locked-out
members of Mine-Mill Local 25
back to work on company
terms at the Tacoma smelter.

Hearings on the company

action were held in federal
court before Judge George II.
Boldt on April 22 and 24. Ar-
gument by union attorneys
that the court lacked jurisdic-
tion in the case was rejected.
The judge also denied a. union
motion to dismiss the action.
He then deferred any further
ruling on the merits of the
case until April 29.

Representing both the In-
ternational and local at the
hearings, crowded with smel-
termen and their wives, were
Mine-Mill General Counsel Na-.
than Witt and Seattle attorney
John Coughlan.

O,-acoma Local 25 Appealslnjunction

District 7 Board Member
Chase Powers, in Tacoma to
help the local membership in
their fight against a company
blacklist, told the MINE-MILL

UNION by telephone that

AS&R management here, while
arrogantly refusing to meet
to resolve the dispute, was in
effect “asking the judge to
‘write another contract.” Com-
mending the solidarity and
spirit of the Local 25 member-
ship, Powers said “the men
are determined that they can
and will whip this thing; they
are not about to surrender.”

The company seeks an in-
junction not only to order a
return to work of the men,
but also to force the dispute
issue into arbitration.

Witt -and Coughlan argued
that the court lacked juris-
diction . because the National
Labor Relations board is cur-
rently investigating unfair la
bor practice charges by the
union against the company for

.discriminative discharges of

nine local leaders and disciplin-

ary layoffs of .312 other union ‘

members on alleged violation
of company rules not in the
contract. -~ —

Pointing out that the com-
pany has repeatedly refused to
bargain on the issues involved
and twice rejected‘ union ef-
forts to have the .U. S. Con-
ciliation and Mediation” serv-

-ice enter the dispute, the union

spokesmen declared that an in-
junction in such a case is spe-

‘cifically ruled out by the Nor-

ris-LaGuardia act.

Witt further argued that the
court has no power to compel
arbitration on behalf of the
company because management
has no right to enforce arbi-
tration, under the contract. The
contract provides that only the
union can ask for arbitration.

The statement itself was in-
troduced into the hearings for

of the committee. It was the
only statement to lay special
stress on just how little has
been done on unemployment
compensation in the eleven
western states from the Rocky
Mountains to the Pacific
coast. -

Of these states, the state-
ment pointed out, only Cali-

under the federal temporary
extension legislation passed by

Colorado extended benefits

under state financing. Eight ~

hausted their benefits in those
eight states without finding
work. ' '

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Vice-Pres. Larson:

Wage Hike Not

Inflationary

 AGES AND PRICES have again become
issues of public debate. That’s not unusual at
a time when major unions and giant corpora-
tions are preparing for contract negotiations.
This time, though—more so than in any peace
time year—the President of the United States

and his staff are very much involved in the . 

debate. . --
Last month, President Eisenhower called

"'3-upon management and labor in the steel in- -_.
dustry to so bargain that a rise in the price of '

steel will not result. That's a fine sentiment

 With which nobody can really argue. It poses

an important issue——it doesn’t indicate the solu-
tion. ‘

‘ Since World War_ 11 there have  23'
‘ “price increases and 11 wage increases in steel.'. 
' The industry has raised prices when demand, '
' was high, when demand was low, when profits

were high and when profits were low—in
short, whenever it decided it wanted more

money. Throughout this entire postwar period _

there hasnever been a steel price decrease.
The steel industry is a prime example ,of

what is known as an “administered” price sys-' ; '

tem.’ The few companies which produce more .L
than half of the total output of the industry -
are '- able to set prices pretty much as they L‘

please without regard to supply and demand.

**k*

THE COMPANIES have tried to justify their
action by blaming it on labor. They have to

raise prices, they claim, because of higher wage ’ i

costs.

A Senate investigating committee, headed by L ’

Senator Kefauver, gave the answer to that.
Their report, issued in early 1958, found that

 the 1957 steel ‘increase of $6 a ton came after
 a wage increase that, at most, cost $3 per ton"
and after all other costs fell by 6.4 per cent. In

other words, at least $3 of that $6 price in-
crease was pure profiteering.

Before that 1957 price increase—in the
period between 1947 and early 1957, unit labor
costs had increased by 34.7 per cent while
prices had been raised by 96.3 per cent, or
nearly three times more than the increase in
labor costs. ‘

What will President Eisenhower do if. the
steel industry persists in its position that it
must have another price increase in order to

i'z"grant any gains to the union? Unfortunately," '

therefs already too much evidence that his Ad-

" We ministration has swallowed the “higher wages‘
‘ cause higher prices” line completely. Several of
4 his advisers and Cabinet members——including 

Vice President Nixon and Secretary of Com-

merce Strauss——are on record as being opposed ‘
- to wage increases now. The Administrations"
plea for “statesmanship” in bargaining is in‘
reality just another pressure move to “hold - 

the line” on wages.

‘kiwi

I THERE’S NO justification for the argument

that wage increases causes price increases in

-that industry.’ A look at the price movements
of copper, lead, and zinc over many years will’
make that plain. Unlike steel, where prices‘

have moved only upwards, nonferrous prices

have moved up and down without any relation‘
to Wages. Nobody could intelligently argue that j
the 46 cents price for copper in 1956, for '

. example, was caused by higher Wages or that "
e the present 311/2 cents price is based on wage 
costs. This industry, too, is controlledby a ‘few ‘

A ‘We do know that there’s ample margin for

wage increases in this industry. The Bureau of"

Labor Statistics recently released figures show-

- ing. that output per man-hour in copper min-‘
 ing had gone up by 39.1 per cent from 1947 ‘

‘ to 1958. Relating that to hourly wages shows L
that labor costs per‘ unit of output, over the ' ‘L
- -same -period, have increased by 31.8 percent '
~ compared witha price increase of over 50 per‘
the present 31'/2 cents copper"

As perhaps everyone knows,
the Miami Miners Union, Local
586, for which I serve as'Busi-
ness.Agent, nominated Brother
Charles H. Wilson, not to op-
pose Brother Irving Dichter,
but for the office of Secretary-
Treasurer of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smel-
ter Workers.

The delegates who nominat-
edﬂhim, did so because they
know and trust him. They- felt
that he was qualified for the

office. He has servedthis un-’

ion honor'ablyL as‘ Eastern Vice-
President and in many other
capacities without complaint.

‘Too, -they felt that in this

Mine-Mill Attorney Featured
On ‘Playhouse 90’ TV   Drama

:  ‘notedattorney associated with Mine-Mill was -featured -last month‘  none? of ‘
most- powerful live dramatic shows this col-umnhas ever ‘seen produced on television ~
The attorney. is Telford. Taylor, one of the defense counsel in the so-called Taft“-—

 
  

Hartley “conspiracy” case of 14 past and present Mine-Mill officers and staff menf-I

bers scheduled for trial next fall.

Told in the play was the story of the
the _Nuremberg trial of Nazi Germany’s four

top judgeswho enforced Hitler’s inhuman mass_

exterminationlaws. Mr. Taylor, who was chief
of ‘counsel in the actual Nuremberg war crimes
trials, was featured both as technical advisor
and narrator f_<__)r.the_Playhouse 90 production.

His role of “introducing the program and pre-.

senting the’ continuity between acts gave the .

play a note of authenticity it could not other-
wise have had. i ‘
-LIVE DRAMA V . -

If argument was ever needed to support the
continuation of live drama on TV,_ the _ex_cel-
lence of the “Judgment at Nuremberg” produc-
tion delivered it in spades. The beautiful
writing job turned in by the ' play’s author,
Abby Mann, was matched by the acting of
-Claude Rains as the,American judge heading
the tribunal, Melvin Douglas as the chief prose-
cutor, Paul Lukas as the Minister of Justice
under Hitler, and —Maximilian Schell as the
German defense lawyer. ,

TV GUIDE called it the “Best of. the Big
Onies,” commenting that “Playhouse 90' not
only walked but ran where angels fear toetread
with its superb ‘Judgement at Nuremberg’.”
“This,” the review continued,“‘despite the cur-
rent Berlin crisis and some understandable
.initial doubts on the part of CBS top 2 _brass.
Result: one of TV ’s strongest, most courageous
and most mature dramas.” "

The New York Times called the production
“convincing,” “outstanding,” “effective,” and
“moving” in its dramatization of “a matter in-
volving retribution for the most brutal mass
crimes in human history.” The Denver Rocky
Mountain .News' said the play presented “a
basic truth that needs restating from time to
time,” adding that ’_ it was “restated nicely on
Playhouse 90.” ' ’ ' 4

For those who missed “Judgement at Nur-

emberg” maybe the -summer re-runs will give

; you another chance to see it,_or re-enjoy it if
’-you .were . fortunate enough to have_ seen it .. ‘:

. the first time. In the usual fare of repeats g
that mark the summer doldrums ‘a re-run -of» -
that top Playhouse ' 90 production would be-

one of the few bright spots among the west-
erns, private -eyes and quizrshows, . . .
Telford Taylor’s job on Playhouse 90 wasn’t
his only starring role‘ on _TV last month. The
night before he appeared on the CBS show -he

was featured as one of two panelists ona, new,

NBC network educational TV program broad-
cast coast to coast. Subject of .the program
was the current crisis" in -Berlin.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Vice-Pres-
ident Howard is serving on a
jail work gang in Bessemer,
Ala., unable to obtain freedom

- on bail.-He has been sentenced

for his activities in urging his
Negro neighbors to register
and vote. Obviously, he is in
no position to write a cam-

-paign statement. As a substi-

tute we quote from an article
by Jeffrey E. Fuller in the

April 16 issue of The Reporter,-
a_ national magazine of com- »
ment. On April-2-4, -Congress-.

man Stewart Udall (D.. Arie.)
read the Fuller article into the
Congressional Record.

seem to preclude his being

by many Southern politicians.

‘He has never been known to

ience' in-order to conceal the -
self-confidence’ r
. he derives from his position" as
’ . . a’ successful businessman and
a recognized~leader.of his com-is

the Starlight Baptist church’s

for"many years a member of

Every member of Mine-Mill

.. who has any understanding of
the history, the democracy and

the struggle of this union to

-achieve a better life for the

men who work in this industry
and their families, can under-
stand why I am proud to be

an officer of this union.

Having served my first_ term

as Board Member ‘I am very

grateful for ‘the support of
Convention delegates from
District 2 who nominated me,
for a‘ second term. If this rep-
resents any degree -of recogni-
tion for my efforts, it repre-
sents to a far greater degree

d the teamwork and cooperation
’ that has prevailed in District

2 among the local leaders, the

International staff, and the

support given to our efforts by
the International officers and
Executive Board.

Every officer and board
member of our union is dedi-
cated to the preservation and
advancement of our trade
union democracy in Mine-Mill.
I support them in this year's
election because of this and

- becausewe are going to need,

the highest degree of experi-'
ence, unity I. and effort to
achieve the ‘objectives outlined

‘-in our 1959 Convention pro-

gram.

Our devoted Vice-President,
Asbury Howard, is in jail be-
cause he had the guts to fight
for .the principle of equality of
all men, regardless of race,
creed or color. Other leaders
of this union are under indict-
ment and must stand trial be-
cause there are powerful anti-
labor forces at work in Amer-
ica. One of the prime targets
of this anti—labor drive is our
union, precisely because we ‘do
stand for equality, for civil

.rights, for greater security,

for a better income and for
democratic trade unionism.-

I should like to express my
opinion regarding the refer-

. endum election on May 19th. I

the office of Executive Board
Member of District"3 in the

know that -the membership of
our locals a-re --sufficiently sat-

istration of the union in this
district to takesuch a step.
It is not only gratifying to
me as a trade unionist, but
as a Negro, as well,‘for again
it demonstrates that Mine-Mill
members ‘ judge’ men for them-
selves and their records and
not for their color, race, na-

Perhaps the finest thing
that has happened to me as a

to have been able to serve in‘

the same leadership with such
men who have headed our
union these last few years."

I Unop-posed for Board
Member, District ,5) .

Looking back over the
period since the last time I
was a candidate" for Board
Member of District 5 there is
much to be proud of in Mine-

Mill. Since the 1957 referen-'

dum, our union has‘ moved
even further away ‘from its
one-time position of isolation.
Many benefits have been won
"for ouremembers as aresult.
If we keep on the same road,
the next two years will be of
even greater significance for
us. ‘

We have matured greatly
in Mine-Mill in terms of pro-
gram and methods of opera-
tion. We have earned our
rightful place in the labor
movement and the affairs of
our nation. In many areas we
have become a potent political
force. In still others we are
the largest single section of

‘labor. Our economic and legis-
affect ever-_

THE. MINE-MILL UNION

    

  Chase Powers
°  {Board Member, District 7)

This opportunity to com-
municate with the membership

5% ’ in,District 7 is greatly appre-
__ _ ciated by me. I will be unable
’-  to campaign very extensively
 for re-election inasmuch -as I
 « am tied down here in Tacoma,
‘f Wash., assisting Local 25 in a
" ' very difficult and serious fight
' against the American Smelt-

’ ing and Refining company.
The situation demands con-

, stant attention from the Inter-
I . ‘national union and I have
.been concentrating on it to
the exclusion of other prob-

lems. This is because the lock- .

out _at Tacoma could have an
impact on contract negotia-
tions in all locals this year.
~. District 7 is a tremendous
, one. It is 1,500 miles from Wal-
lace Idaho, to Los Angeles,
1‘;  Calif. Obviously the job of
y r protecting the interests of
; O. _ miners,’ smeltermen, and fac-
 ' tory workers in this diversi-
I53  fiedv district requires experi-
enced -leadership. That the
rank-and-file of District 7, by
repeatedly re-electing me, ap-
parently believes that I pos-

‘sess the necessary qualifca-
1 tions is a source of personal
' gratifcation.’ Such confidence
 can only be regarded by me

I with deep humilty.

This year our union will be

1 engaged in its first major ne-
  gotiations in three years. It

will be a year when all of the

, experience and know-how We

0 can harness will be necessary

in order to extract from the

companies the kind of con-

tracts and improvements that

~ every worker is demanding.

.» 2 ' The job of heading up those

v negotiations in the various

districts must be entrusted to

’ men who possess that expe-
rience.

:We will need considerable
experiencein just taking care
' C of the day-to-day problems
ven after negotiations. Griev-
F-Inces and arbitrations require
‘as much experience today as
;. contract negotiations. Even
. . though no one man can hope
— ' to be covering all locals at all
 times in a district as large as
g —- ours, I havevbeen very careful
 . ‘over the years in selecting a
 ‘competent, experienced staff

A ofﬁregional directors and inter-
 national representatives. In
* this way we have been able to
T A cover the vast distances and
ikeep in touch with all situa-
' ~tions. ‘

 {needs this year, I am support-

James Buck

(Candidate for Board
Member, District 7)

My name was placed in nom- O

ination for the office of Board
member 7th District of the in-
ternational Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter workers industry,
because many members
throughout District 7’feel that
Chase Powers should be de-
feated. There are in District
7 a great number of. problems
that could be solved, and must
be solved. The present Board
Member must believe that the

problems can be- solved just .
before election time, as that is .

the only time that he visits
the locals.

I would like to state at this
time, if I am elected to the of-
fice of Board Member of Dis-
trict 7, I will work for all the
locals. I will be a full-time

Board Member and not—port '

time. I believe that'District 7

has got to be re-organized, new A

locals brought into this union
of Mine and Mill. Every local
must, and will be informed of
what is going on in its Dis-
trict and the International
Union. There must be meet-
ings held in District 7, and a

training program to bring new

leaders into the top offices of
this great International Union.

PROGRAM

If elected, I will carry out
the programs that are adopted
by our conventions. I will vote
in the International Board
meetings in the best interest
of District 7—membership. Any
member of this District will be
free to call on me day or night
—seven days a week—to come
to there local to give assist-
ance, no matter how little the
problem may be; because little
problems lead to big problems.
I promise to work for the best
interests of every local, _re-
gardless if it is big or small. -I
will visit and work with the
membership in every local in
this District.

At this time I ask the mem-
bership in District 7 to turn
out and vote for a full-time
Board Member.

Should ‘A-FL-C10

WASHINGTON, DC.-
Leaders_ of one of the biggest
unions in the AFL-CIO last
month declared that the
merged federation should split
back 1 up’ into separate AFL

it could show “more internal
unity.”

President J. Lloyd and Sec-
retary—Treasurer P a t r i c k E.

whatever side of the line it is
needed, we all have an equity
in it. This was proven in the
Inco strike in Sudbury and
Port Colborne in which $145,-

treasuries and which’ certain-
ly helped to pave the way for
the strike’s victorious conclu-
sion.” ' '

Developing the point that
authority to “levy assessments
never has" been - "abused in
Mine-Mill because of rank-
and-file control of financial
matters, Clark said that “in
the past, the right of the In-
ternational to declare an as-
sessment has been exercised
on only two occasions in more
than 15 years, proving that
only in sheer necessity is this
"action taken.” V -
NECESSITY» ONLY

“The new proposal clearly

states that only $6 canhbe ans,-" '

sessed in "any one year. This
does not mean in one chunk,
of‘ course, and only out of
necessity will it be used by the
International ‘ Executive
board. It goes into the Inter-
national fund for the purpose
declared and no other. ‘
“lam very sure every mem-
ber knowing what faces the
whole of organized labor and
the need for a protective and
a fighting fund in order‘ to
make further gains‘ on the

as well as voting for the
passage of this amendment,
also urge his fellow members ‘
to vote in its favor. S ‘ '
“This is one of the two or

three unions which vote by V

laws covering it. Other unions
pack their conventions and
raise their dues, salaries, etc.,
and subject their membership
to this dictatorial procedure.
By voting for Proposition No.
3, we can say: ‘Well, we did
this for OUR benefit and not
for any machine.’ .”
PROPOSITION NO. 1 .
Proposition No. 1 on the

the constitution must be sent

  Clark Urges Locals Ask

House Defeat Labor Bill

DENVER—Opposition to the _Kennedy-Ervin “labor
reform” bill was voiced late last month by President
John Clark in urging that all Mine-Mill locals Contact
their congressmen to Vote against the bill in the House‘

of Representatives. ' _ ,
Clark said the labor-con-

  trol bill “ties all labor to

juke box and racket investiga-
He. recalled that the
San _Francisco convention Went

on record against the bill in‘

its entirety because" “‘despite_ ‘a
Democratic _. majority, a so-
called mild labor bill cannot
get by Congress.” . -

_ Accuracy of this forecast -in

the convention-adopted resolu-

tion was underscored when the
U. S. Senate April 25 passed
the bill after Senator John L.
McClellan of Arkansas had
given it a stamp of approval
with -his own" so-called “bill of
rights” attached "to the mea-

'. sure as an amendment. -
The bill, now in the House,‘

makes the mo st. extensive
changes in. the Taft-Hartley
law since the act was passed
in 1947, plus adding some
“toned down” regulations of
labor’ approved by McClellan.

claring that f‘labor' c_an’n'o't‘

only opposing Brother Dichter.

It is reliably reported in this
local union that the incum-
bent officers, up for re-elec-
tion, in accepting their nomi-
nation for re-election, took the
occasion to make a campaign
speech for Bro. Dichter, and
giving the impression that of
the two, only Brother Dichter
was actually qualified for the
office.

I have no quarrel with any

officer or member for having

a preference as to who should
fill a vacant office, but in this
instance it seemed like tak-
ing unfair advantage.

Brother Wilson is presently
assigned to work in an area
where, as of now, there are no
members who will be able to
cast a ballot either for or
against him. His duties will
not permit him to make trips
around the Int’l Union to cam-
paign for the office. This

alone seems enough handicap,

without having the incumbent
Executive Board taking the

position that they will choose’

who will succeed Brother Pez-

I hope that you can print
this in the Forum of our paper
so that some of the members
who may not know what the
situation is can at least be-
come partially acquainted with
it. .

I further hope that when
May '19th, Election Day, ar-
rives, that we can have a .full
turnout of. our membership
to the Polls, and may the best
man win.

To the Editor:

The District 6 Civil Rights
Committee hereby declares its
support in behalf of the candi-
dacy and the election of Broth-
er Irving Dichter to the office
of Secretary-Treasurer of the
International Union of Mine,
Mill & Smelter Workers.

We are supporting Brother
Irving Dichter because of his
outstanding record of leader-
ship and service given to Mine-
Mill over a period of 18 years.

Under his competent leader-
ship as an organizer, regional
director and as Board Member
of District 6, new heights of
achievement have been reached
in every phase of union activ-
ity. We in District 6 have felt.
the impact of Brother Irving
Dichter’s dynamic leadership
and have been inspired to con-
tinue our forward progress.

His awareness and ability to
provide competent leadership
in the field of Civil Rights, is
exemplified by the fact that
over the past four years, we
have held Civil Rights Confer-
ences that have been supported
by every local union in our

district. Every year, we have

put out a District-wide leaflet
commemorating the Supreme

Court decision :.on desegxgega. ‘

THE MINE-MILL UNION

ii

Mine-Mill Wins Six Bisbee 

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

BISBEE, Ariz.—-—The
Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers union continued to
grow in strength and num-
bers in the Southwest when

-it defeated three AFL-CIO

unions on April 23 in Na-
tional Labor Relations
board balloting at the Bis-
bee operations of Phelps
Dodge.

Voting in seven different
units_, the"Bisbee workers
rang up the following score
for Mine-Mill:

Mine-Mill 
Operating Engineers . 53
Chemical Workers  35
Plumbers __________________ __ 2

Three of the units al-
ready were represented by
Mine-Mill. They were the
leeching plant, which Mine-

’ Mill lost 6 to 5, and the mill

production and repair units.

In mill production, Mine-
Mill defeated the Operating
Engineers and Chemical
Workers with 49 votes to
six for the Engineers and
20 for Chemical. Neither
Chemical nor the Operat-
ing Engineers scored a vote
in the mill repair unit,
while Mine-Mill got 19.

The April 23 elections
brought four new units to
Mine-Mill. They were me-
chanical, pit shovel opera-
tors, pit residual, and pipe-
fitters. In all,‘ Mine-Mill
was the victor in six out of
seven units, losing only the
small leeching plant group
of a dozen workers.

Copper Queen Miners
Union No. 551 of Mine-Mill
already had represented
approximately 600 under-
ground and other workers
in the Bisbee operations.

These were not involved in
the April 23 voting, which
established Mine - Mill as
the major bargaining rep-
resentative in all of the
Phelps Dodge operations in
Bisbee and Douglas.

The campaign at Bisbee

was directed by Interna-
tional Representative
Frank Vettorel. Assisting
him as his staff were Win-
ston and Buren Elkins, Da-
vid Shakleford, Carl Krass,
Wayne Evans, John Mc-
Daniels and Arthur Jones.

C Iarkand Larson Meet
With Canadian Leaders

SUDBURY, Ont. — International

President John

Clark and International Vice-President Orville Larson
met here for several days last month with the Mine-Mill
Canadian Executive board and with the newly-elected
executive boards of Sudbury Local 598 and Port Colborne

Local 637, both Interna-
tional Nickel units.

The joint meeting of Inter-
national officers, Canadian
leaders, and the two locals
dealt with f utur e activities
of the International Nickel
locals.

The two Mine-Mill interna-
tional officers expressed grati-
fication over the meetings,
and particularly with the
declaration of the new officers

-of Local 598 which Clark de-

scribed as “in clear agreement
with the International union's
method of running union af-

fairs -- without interference

from outside parties.”

-FAALCONBRIDGE

Among the problems dis-
cussed in the meetings was
the Falconbridge company sit-
uation where negotiations are
now in the hands of the On-
tario Conciliation board. Or-
ganizational objectives and
labor unity were among im-
portant other questions under

. discussion. R

Later, President Clark and
Canadian President Nels Thi-
bault visited the Dension
uranium operations. Clark re-
turned to Sudbury “with the
definite feeling that Mine-Mill
is going to be the dominant
union in that section of the
uranium industry.”

HIT COMPANY
In a joint statement, Local

  Union Aids Logger Strike in Canada

"support they can.

. ' foundland,
. land Development company

- DENVER—A contribution of
$500 has been sent by Mine-
Mill to aid the striking log-
gers of Newfoundland, mem-
bers of the AFL-CIO Interna-
tional Woodworkers of Amer-
ica.

The strike donation was au-
thorized by the Mine-Mill In-
ternational Executive board in
answer to an appeal addressed

to President John Clark from.

IWA President A. F. Hartung.

In a covering letter enclos-
3-ing the check, Clark told the
‘ Woodworkers president:

“You. no doubt know that *

_ our" locals in Canada are fully
" behind the strike and giving
‘ whatever I possible financial
All labor
recognizes the employer tac-
lf tics in the Newfoundland strike
as an attempt to initiate a
new, vicious, union - busting
pattern.‘ VVe wish your union
success in defeating this anti-
union attack.” g

The strike of 8,500 IVVA

members against two British- ~

owned corporations in New-
Anglo - Newfound-

and Bowater’s_ corporation, has
been going on since January 1.

s It was called by a 98 per cent

strike vote to uphold the unan-
., imous award of a Newfound-

b‘ Aland government Conciliation
 ‘board which
, a five cent wage increase rais-

receommended

ing. the hourly rate from $1.05

A" ,to,$1.22 and reduction of the

work week from 60 to 54
hours.
, An IWA appeal points out
that “the companies have been
,,joined in. their battle against
the union by. the, government

of the Province of Newfound-
land in an all-out effort to
break the strike.”

The companies are being
supported by Joseph Small-
wood, premier of Newfound-
land, whohas urged the strik-
ers to quit the IWA and join
a government - formed a n d
sponsored company-union.

Local constables and import-
ed Royal Canadian Mounted
police brutally attacked pick-
ets and provoked riots. Scores
of strikers have been injured

and hundreds sent to jail. IWA
offices have been Wrecked by
vigilantes.

The Newfoundland legisla-

ture passed a law decertifying
and outlawing the IWA. The
Executive council of the «Ca-
nadian Labour Congress has
denounced the legislation as
“a threat to the basic human
rights of freedom -of speech
and freedom of association”
and has called on all affiliated
unions to support the IWA
strike.

598 and 637 executive boards
unanimously condemned the
International Nickel company
for its refusal to honor a
unanimous arbitration award
which restored the job of a
Port Colborne worker.

On April 2, President Thi-
bault installed the new exe-
cutive board of Local 598,,mem-
bers of which are:

President, Don Gillis; vice-
president, Don McNab; finan-
cial secretary, R. Poirer; re-
cording secretary, J. P. Hickey;

Right to Have

Scoundrels, Too

Do geniuses make for
brotherhood? When someone
with‘ prejudices attacks Jews,
Italians or Negroes, we _“good”
people «usually say, “Look at
Einstein. (Or Carver, or Tos-
canini.) Of course Jews (or
Negroes, or Italians) must be
all right.” b

An article by Libby Bene-
dict in The Saturday Review
of Literature points out that
what a minority group wants,_.
is not the right to have ge-
niuses amongthem, but the
right to have fools and scoun-
drels——without b e i n g con-
demned as a group. How many
readers are there who do not,
at once, identify the origin of
a culprit by his name or men-
tion of his color, and mentally
connect him and his group?
If a trade union leader is a
crook, how many view him as
representing all labor?

Yet the same connection
does not hold for groups with
more status in the community.
If a banker steals a million
dollars, does that reflect badly
on every banker? Does the
three-century American origin
of a forger cast doubt on the
integrity of every Mayﬂower
descendant?

The law of averages gives
any group a -certain percent-
age of good and ‘bad charac-
ters. The right to have scien-

tists and artists—benefactor.4‘-,,.

of society—app1ies equally to‘
all groups. These people are
thought of as individuals, not
as representatives of a group.
But when wrongdoers belong
to a minority group their
number is magnified in the
minds of other people. What
minorities need, therefore, is
the right to have a natural
number of low-down rotters
among them.-—(N.L.S.)

Mine-Mill Areds
Democratic Axis?

WASHINGTON, D. C. ——A
“new axis of the Democratic
party” was foreshadowed by
the great Democratic election
gains in the west last year, ac-
cording to Sen. Mike Mon-

roney of Oklahoma. The statesr'*-‘-

he mentioned as “forming a
great new keystone to hold
together the Democratic
party” include such areas of
considerable Mine-Mill politi-
cal prestige as Utah, Nevada,

California, Washington, Mon-

tana, Idaho, Colorado and
New Mexico. ~

All of these, Monroney said,
were joined “in giving us at
least one, and in many_ cases
two,‘  ‘Democratic, senators.”

Producers Want Government
Disposal to Weaken Union-

That news report was based
on a Mine-Mill press release
issued the week before which
quoted a telegram to Presi-
dent Eisenhower from the
union’s four top officers as-
sailing moves either by the
govermnent to unload stock-
piled copper on the open mar-
ket or by copper companies
for suspension of the present
copper import tax. ’

The telegram, signed by
President John Clark, Vice
Presidents Asbury H o w a r d
and Orville Larson and Secre-
tary-Treasurer Albert Pezzati,
urged President Eisenhower
to “make it abundantly plain
that it is not the policy of the
government to engage in com-
modity transactions so as to
benefit either side at the bar-
gaining table.”

.It also called on the Presi-
dent “to reject the attempt of
the copper companies to raise

the import tax issue in an ob-' -
vious attempt to weaken la-
bor’s bargaining position."

Similar telegrams were sent
simultaneously to Labor Sec-
r e t a r y Mitchell; Commerce
Secretary Lewis L. Strauss;
Leo Hoegh, Director of the Of-
fice of Civil and Defense Mo-
bilization; and Interior‘ Secre-
tary Fred A. Seaton.

The message quoted a re-
cent issue of the industry pub-
lication, Engineering and Min-
ing Journal Metal and Mineral
Markets, which stated that the
unloading of copper would be
“aimed primarily at prevent-

’ ing a copperlabor strike” dur-

ing negotiation of new con-
tracts this summer.
REVERSAL

Less than a year ago, the
Mine-Mill officers said, the
Anaconda, Kennecott and
Phelps Dodge copper compa--
nies, which now are reported
requesting legislation -for sus-
pension of the 1.7 cent copper
import tax, ‘‘were behind a

legislative proposal for govern-
ment purchase of up to 150,-
000 tons of domestically mined
copper, and at least two of
these three favored increasing
the copper import tax to more
than double its present level.”

The Mine-Mill officers point- 4

ed out: “The timing of the
companies’ abrupt change of
position on the copper import
tax, which raises this issue as
bargaining on new labor-man-
agement agreements is about
to start, can only be regarded
as another part of a concerted
plan to weaken the bargaining
position of this union in con-
tract negotiations.”

The union’s position gained
additional backing when the
U. S. Senate‘ passed a resolu-
tion sponsored by Western
senators expressing the Sen-
ate’s opposition to the unload-
ing of government stockpiled
copper.

While the cabinet action dis-
posed of any immediate pro-»

posal to remove copper from
the stockpile, the union re-
mained alert to fight any defi-

' nite move for suspension of
the copper tariff. -Such action 
would require congressional,

approval. However, not such
move has yet been made.

Meanwhile,

where on the bargaining front
around the union.
