Executive Board Unanimously Backs  

 

   

Combining with United Steelworkers

CHICAGO, Ill.—A Mine-Mill special convention to discuss and decide, the question
of the proposed merger of the union with the United Steelworkers of America will

open on Monday, Jan. 16 at the Pioneer- Hotel in Tucson, Ariz. Unanimously agreeing _ I
"to recommend merger to the 11nion’s membership, the Mine-Mill executive board at a. 4
meeting here late last month scheduled the convention, which tentatively-is set to“.

run for three days.

The official call to the convention will be mailed to each. local union this month.

Delegates will be selected by each local in the same way and on the -‘same represen-L;  

tational basis as for the regular biennial convention of the union.

Under terms of the proposed merger agreement, copies of which will accompany   1'-
the call, Mine-Mill would become: an affiliate of the .United_ Steelworkers on Feb. -, 

1967, with merger taking place
on July 1 next year. On‘ the
latter date, Mine-Mill locals
would be chartered as locals of
the Steelworkers. »
The purpose of the period
affiliation is to protect bargain-
ing certifications as merger

takes place.’Mo'st of the major

contracts in the non-ferrous.

metals industry expire next
year on June 30. ’

The above timetable, of

course, depends on the decision

Chief Goals Achieved _
While the delegates repre-
sented some 80,000 workers in
the industry whose contracts
expire in 1967, no specific con-
tract demands were formulated

‘ at the October parley. The con-

ference’s chief purposes, in-
stead, were to acquaint the
representatives of the many
unions with one another and to
get their agreement for bargain-
ing coordination. The goals

THE. MINE;-MILL UNION

November. 'i96'"td’i5

for Meaningful Safety Code

MIAMI, Ariz.——Mine-Mill Local 586 and other unions in the area represented at
a large mass meeting here last month established a Zeke Sanchez ‘Memorial Fund
to be used for lobbying activities during next year’s session of the state _legislature in
behalf of a stronger state safety code. The fund commemorates Ezequiel Y. Sanchez,
an 18-year veteran of hard rock mining, who was killed on Sept. 20 at" the nearby
Christmas mine, a property of the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company.

The death of Sanchez, a member ‘of the Mine-Mill local, who was killed by the
fall‘ of a 500-pound slab of rock as he was barring down a section of"drift, ‘led to an

Members of several unions participated ‘in an" Oct. 4 V

sentiments of all miners’
families. 

 

They ‘express the

subsidiary of Anaconda, to im-
prove the safety conditions at
Christmas added substantially
to the union determination to
establish an effective safety
lobby next year, as did the
Hersey statement. '

Sanchez was killed when he
was sent into the drift alone—a
drift that had been reported as
unsafe by the previous shift
foreman—and instructed to re-
move mats and rock bolts from
a section that was breaking up,
to bar down, and to reinstall
mats and bolts. A U.S. Bureau
of Mines report on’ the accident
listed as a contributing cause
the failure of supervisors and
workmen to evaluate a danger-

. ous condition properly following
the removal of permanent sup-.

ports.

Christmas Closing

Nine days after the fatality,
Inspiration announced the clos-
ing of the underground mine,
stating that it has" been operat-
ing at a loss since it was opened
in 1962. Still in operation is a
small open pit mine, which the
company recently announced
would be expanded, a mill, and
a crusher.

Approximately 300 employees
have been affected by the
Christmas shutdown. Many of
these workers have seniority at
other properties of Inspiration
and are. being transferred to
those operations. Other miners
have been offered jobs by the
Anaconda Company, if they can
pass an examination and want
to relocate in Montana.

As this issue of the Mine-Mill
Union goes to press, over $25,000
in lump-sum severence pay-
ments have been made to the
workers laid off, and there are
still some claims which have
not yet been processed. Unem-
ployment compensation benefits

also are being paid to those out-

of work.

Arizona Labor Prepares Fight Shackelford Elected DemO‘ .

Chairman for Pinal County 

 

SUPERIOR, Ariz.—David'L. Shackelford, business agent for
Mine-Mill Local 938 here, recently was elected Democratic party >:_.¢.,
chairman for Pinal County, the state’s third largest in terms of '

population and voter registration.

Elected to a two-year term late in September, following the  pl
Arizona primary, Shackelford headed the campaign throughout the  7
county for Gov. Sam Goddard and the entire Democratic ticket,

concentrating on the drive to
turn out a heavy vote in this
predominantly Democratic area
o-n Nov. 8. Between elections, he‘
will spearhead fund-raising‘ and

- ‘organizational "drives; ‘

‘Pinal County isdivided into 37
political’ precincts, each of which
has a number of partycoI'nmit-
teepeople-—asi many as six, de-
pending on the voter turnout in
previous elections. These pre-
cinct committeepeople, chosen
in the party’s primary, elect, in
turn, the county chairman.

Three-Vote Margin
Shackelford defeated Robert

idge, by a narrow 49 to 46 count
for the chairmanship, succeed-
ing Mrs, Louise Henness of

,Casa- Grande, who did not run-

for re-election.

Both Shackelford ' and "Roy
Santa Cruz, Jr., who was the
local union’s business agent
prior to joining the Mine-Mill in-
ternational staff this past June,
have been Democratic commit-
teemen here for some eight
years. Two other Local 938

members, Oscar Reyna and"

Tony Tameron, also were
elected to committeemen’s jobs
in this year’s primary.

The new Pinal County chair-
man, who automatically gets a
spot on the party’s state execu-
tive committee, said that the
1966 elections may well im-
prove the chances for the pas-
sage of liberal legislation on the
state level. When interviewed
just prior to the Nov. 8 election
date, he declared that the new
reapportionment of the legis-
lature enhances the possibility
of electing Democrats who will
not form a conservative coali-
tion with the Republicans,

lative proposals intthe past.

BILLINGS, Mont.-—The need‘
for a sound program for water
conservation, in the face of a
threatened shortage within the
next 20 years, was stressed to
delegates to the Western States

mote a reasonable public policy
on water and power usage and
development, were Secretary of

ators Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.)
and Frank Moss (D-Utah), and
Congressman John E. Moss
(D-Calif). Senator Edward Ken-

_ nedy (D-Mass.), who was un-
‘able to attend the meeting be-
cause of a death in the family,
addressed the delegates. by

year's passage, he maintained,
means that in future years the

Saying that in the long, tough
struggle for the mine safety bill
Montoya was “the staunchest
ally our union hadin this area
of national legislative interest,”
Merino stated that the pen would
be suitably displayed as a cher-

  Let 3 Give a am!
By Horace L. Sheffield
UAW International Representative

(Some two months ago, the Mine-Mill Civil Rights Commitee
issued an appeal to every local union for contributions to the in-
ternational’s newly’ created civil rights fund, to be used in aiding
financially on as broad a scale as possible the continuation of the
struggles for the rights of minority groups and of all Americans.
The crying need for such aid is impos-
sible to overstate. Certainly it is true
that, as several legislative gains in this
area have been made in the past few
years, civil rights groups have been ex-
periencing much greater difficulty in re-
ceiving donations sufficient to continue
their crucial work. The following moving
story of conditions in Mississippi is only
one graphic example of the need that
still exists in far too many areas of our
country. I am well aware, for example,
of the similar situations that exist in my
home state of Alabama. Brother Shef-
field," an international representative for
the UAW Citizenship-Legislative Com-
mittee and Director of Organization for
the Trade Union Leadership Council, has
spent much time working with the civil
rights movement in. the South. His article reprinted here originally
appeared in the official publication of the TULC, Vanguard, and
also is found in the current issue of Labor Today.—Asbu'ry Howard,
co-chairman, Mine-Mill Civil Rights Committee.)

WOULD be the first to admit that Mississippi has been per-
ceptibly affected by the powerful winds of social change that
have swept across the nation. Yet, in all candor, I would also
have to say that the mighty barriers of intolerance that surround

 

Howard

and permeate Mississippi, though weakening, have reduced the

strength of this tornadic force to little more than a gentle breeze.

The insidious, calculated dehumanization of the black man and
the unspeakable terrors and" murders that have_ ensued in its wake
has been the one dominant and clearly resistant force in most
of Mississippi’s long and, for the Negro, unrewarding history.

You hear about the plight of the Medgar Evers, the Mickey
Schwerners and the Vernon Dahmers because the violent and
senseless murder of civil rights workers makes good copy in
today’s charged climate.

You’re -outraged and for a few fleeing-‘moments you identify
with the struggle as you say to yourself, “God knows I would
make any sacrifice to help.” The chances are 9 to 1, however,
that you won’t- do anything, but at least you had the feeling.

Even if you are that 1 in 10 who does something, on these
infrequent occasions, don’t start congratulating yourself.‘ Almost
completely ignored’ are theliterally thousands and thousands of
Mississippi Negroes who still find freedom and dignity beyond

' their grasp but struggle on under damnable and perilous circum-
- _ stances.

They don’t make the headlines because their souls are
being murdered rather than their bodies.

S 94c Pact Won at Falconbridge

Special from the Mine-Mill Canadian Headquarters -'

TORONTO,'Ont., Nov. 5—Wage increases averaging 59.7 cents per hour—with A 

35.25 cents of that gained in the first year—is the outstanding wage gain won by

Sudbury Local 598 for 2400 Falconbridge workers. William Longridge, national Mine- 

Mill secretary-treasurer, announced the settlement today, following the ratification

Vote by some 2100 workers.

Longridge stated that the full value of the big three-year package is placed at 97  

cents per hour by the company, and at 94 cents by the union. The agreement is

dated from August 21, 1966, but
the second wage hike will come
on July 1, 1967, with the third
effective the same date the fol-
lowing year.

Another “first” in the district,
patterned after the Mine-Mill

clause, protects the employee’s
job rates in the event of cut-
backs. This protection is afford-
ed all men with 10 or more years
seniority and provides that, in
the eventof cutbacks, the work-
er’s rate cannot be reduced
more than one job rate.
Establishment of joint safety
committees, long resisted by all

Cost of Living Clause

A new feature of the settle-
ment calls for a one-cent per
hour increase for every .06 in-
crease in the cost of living index,
to be implemented immediately
in the third year of the agree-
ment if the index shows a two
and one-half percent increase
over the August, 1968 level.

E COULD END THIS VICIOUS persecution and intimidation

of these thousands of hapless Negroes in Mississippi, if you
really cared". That is to say, if you and others like you‘ really
cared enough that you would make the Negro’s pitiful‘ plight in
Mississippi a priority of the highest order. ‘

There are almost a half million Negroes in Mississippi 21
years and over. This is approximately 45 percent of the potential
electorate. So—you don’t have to be a Harvard graduate to see
that a revolution in race: relations would take place if we could
register a majority of the eligible Negro voters. *

While it's clear. that food a,n.df_clothes, are needed, you ‘should’-

also understand that the registration drive. has been hampered‘ by
a lack of money.. If we hada couple ofjlate model: station wagons,

money for gas and‘ the hiring of a» sufficient number. of what» we»

call here “task force workers,” we could getthe job done. I’m
ashamed: to say it, but things are so bad here‘ that you can: em-

Maior Gains in Pensions
A big cost item to the co 
pany will be the greatly. ii; 
creased pension benefits,’ which
will now give a 30-year employee
a minimum of $250 per month
_on retirement. Supplemental to
this will be the value of the em- I
ployee’s own contributions over
the years. Examples given by-
the union range from a_pension
of $263.67 for a person retiring -
in 1968 with 26- years -service to
a pension of $281.67 for retire-
ment in 1968 at age 62 with 30
years service. This represents
pension increases of $168.67‘ and ,
$176.67 respectively. '

  
  

The emphasis in the newly ne-
gotiated plan aims at covering
the men retiring between 1967
and 1970, prior to the" time the
Canada Pension Plan takes full.
effect. Similarly, the company
is committed to further negoti-
ations on pensions in 1969, with '
a new plan to be ‘effective on or
before January 1, 1971'.

Other monetary gains, which
are retroactive to,August 21,. in-
clude boosts in the Sunday work
premium from the present'15
cents per: hour“ to ' 25,- cents ‘and -
shift premiums increased to 8,9
11, and 14 cents respectivelyfor
afternoon, night, and graveyard‘
shift work. The upgrading’ of
more than 51 job categories, cov-
ering some 500 workers, results
in increases ranging from_ seven
to 21 cents. -

Vacation Improvements

Substantial improvement in the
vacationplan was made. provid-- .
ing for a five-week special:v-aca-
tion with pay, to be afforded
every five years, for all employ-
ees who have completed. ‘five
years of service as of January
1, 1967, Payment for the special
vacation will be at-the: rate" of.
two percent per. week,  at '
least 20 percent, but. not more
than 25’ percent of the. workers

(Continued from Page 1)
the major features of the agree-
-ment worked out in merger dis-
cussions between the officers
of the two unions. Delegates to

, theiconference would be elected

by the non-ferrous locals. Vari-
ous company-wide bargaining
committees also would be set
up.

‘chartering of Locals
Chartered as Steelworkers lo-
cals that same date, the local
unions would then be gov-
erned by the Steelworkers’
constitution, with the following

...,exceptions: A local with month-

ly dues higher than $5 could re-

' tain such an amount, but would

not be able to further increase
it unless authorized by a
change in the Steelworkers’ con-
stitution; a local could continue
to fix the term and timing of
local elections until June, 1970,
when elections of officers for
three-year terms would become
required; length of time credited
in good standing with Mine-Mill
would be counted as time spent
with the Steelworkers in satisfy-
ing the eligibility requirements
for seeking local o-r international
union office.

The merger proposal also
all ‘r‘igh‘s and
-titles to local union (books,
records, property, monies, and
assets will continue tobe held
by .th_e'local unions.

Because the merger discus-
sions have involved the two un-
.ions.tha.t are unquestionably the

dominant onesfin the industry,

representing. some 80 percent of
its organized workers, the sub-
ject received wide attention, not
only -at ‘separate meetings of
Mine-‘Mill and the Steelworkers
at the Sherman House here on
Oct. 24.and 25, but also at the
IUD, copper and brass confer-
ence on Oct. 26 to 23. The AFL-
rCIO ‘Industrial Union Depart-
ment-.-sponsored meeting, at-
tended’ by some 320 delegates
re_pr_esenting 11 different inter-
national unions, was addressed
by -Mine-Mill President A. C.
Skinner and USWA Vice-P'resi-
dent Joseph P. Molony on Oct.
27. '

their two long-warring organiza-
tions, were received warmly by
the IUD delegates.

Earlier, Molony and USWA
Secretary-Treasurer Walter J.
Burke won standing receptions
for their talks to the Mine-Mill
pre-conference meeting. Skin-
ner, too, received a standing
ovation from some 200 Steel-
workers when he addressed
them on Oct. 25.

Joint Cocktail Party

Yet perhaps the greatest dis-
play of unity and support for
the idea of merger between
Mine-Mill and the Steelworkers
came at a joint cocktail party
that same day, attended by the
rank-and-file leaders of both un-
ions. The sentiment expressed
at the social gathering for the
combining of the two groups’
bargaining strength was over-
whelming, despite the fact that
many of those in attendance had
undergone unpleasant experi-
ences in the long struggle be-
tween the two unions.

The Mine-Mill caucus the
previous day, too, indicated the
swelling support among the 10-
cals for the mutual assistance
pact, signed by the officers of
the two unions late in August
while the merger talks were
continuing. Delegates from
many of the 35 locals represent-
ed at the meeting spoke of the
backing within their local un-
ions fo-r the progress to date in
the merger discussions.

’ In addition to the many locals

and leadership groups whose
support for the mutual -aid pact
was reported in last month’s
edition of the Mine-Mill Union,
the following .have formally
taken the same stand: The
Magma Unity Council, involv-
ing Locals 937 and 938 in San
Manuel and Superior, Ariz., -re-
spectively, Local 461 in Omaha,
Neb., three of the four units of
the Cleveland Amalgamated Lo-
cal, No. 735, Local 16 in Great

Bargaining Coalition

Cracks Genera|EIectric-

WASHINGTON, D.C.—A joint bargaining committee,_ repre-
senting 11 AFL-CIO unions, reached agreement on a national
three-year contract with the General Electric Company on Oct.
17. The settlement, which .came just two days before 115,000 work-

ers were to go on strike, provides for a package gain valued at:

more than five percent per year—-including an important cost-of-

living escalator clause.

The contract affords a wage increase of four percent  first
year, with -subsequent pay hikes of three percent in each of the ‘two

succeeding years. Skilled trades
and salaried workers will re-
ceive additional raises of up to
10 cents an hour.

Cost-of-Living Increases

A major union objective was
won with the establishment of a
cost-of-living clause which guar-
antees minimum increases of
one-l1alf of one percent in 1967
and 1968. Further increases, up
to a maximum of 10.5 cents dur-
ing the term of the contract,
will be paid if living costs con-
tinue to rise.

The pact also provides for‘

pension vesting after .10 years,
a ninth paid holiday, two weeks
vacation after two years of ser-
vice, retraining credits, in-
creased insurance benefits for
employees and dependents, and
a savings proposal.

The International Union of
Electrical Workers, which repre-
sents 80,000 employees at GE,
estimated that the total value
of the gains average nearly
$2,500 per worker over the three
years.

The most significant aspect of
this year’s bargaining with GE
was the unity of the unions in-
volved in the negotiations.‘ Tried
this yearfor -the" first time, -the
combined bargaining strength
of the 1_1-union coalition proved
to be most effective against the
traditional “take it or leave it”
bargaining approach of the
giant -electrical firm.

The same joint bargaining
approach was used in negotia-
tions with the Westinghouse
Electric Corp., Where a similar
contract covering 40,000 work-
ers was agreed upon.

Court Bottle

General Electric had chal-
lenged the joint bargaining con-
cept by refusing to negotiate
with the combined committee,
contending that the mixed union
grouping was “illegal.” After a
series of court proceedings,
however, the company failed to
prevent the joint negotiations.

The settlement of disputes
during the life of the contract
was an important issue -left un-
resolved when GE refused to
agree to new grievance pro-

    

 

cedures that would lead to arbi-
tration. As a result, over 25.-
000 workers are on strike, pend-

ing the settlement of local .\
grievances.
The unions involved in the

joint GE bargaining were, in ad-
dition to I.U.E., the Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, the . Machinists, the
United Auto Workers, the Allied
Industrial Workers, the Sheet

.. Metal Workers, the Technical

Engineers, the Plumbers, the
Flint Glass Workers, the Car-
penters, and the Steelworkers.

Assisting in the negotiations

was a White House panel con-

sisting of Secretary of Labor W.
Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Com-
merce John T. Connor, and
Deputy Secretary of Defense
Cyrus R. Vance. President John-
son had appointed the panel due
to concern about defense con-
tracts with GE.

Shaft Accident

ELLINGTON, Mo.—Wi1liam A.
Macom, 45, a former financial
secretary of Mine-Mill Local 944,
was killed on Nov. 3 in the shaft
of the Ozark Lead Company's
mine here by a large piece of

fallingice. Local President Wes-.

ley Mann was bruised in the ac-
cident, but escaped serious in-
jury. _

The two men were riding on
the top of a skip, chipping ice
from the side of the shaft, when
the slab of ice fell from above
as .they reached a depth of about
90 feet. The chunk that fell,
states Mann, well may have
been hidden behind the vent
shaft as the mendescended.

The accident occurred shortly
after noon. Mann said that he
cried out immediately to be
hoisted up, but was not heard.
Descent-continued to _the 985 sta-
tion, where it was determined
that Macom was dead.

Macom, who’ accepted a job 7
as foreman only‘ a short ‘time’

ago, leaves his wife, "Pauline,
one son, and one daughter.» 6

CHICAGO, Ill.—Eight company meetings, at which representatives of the vari-
Cou_s._ unions «holding bargaining rights at the different properties were, able __to more
‘thoroughly discuss «their problems encountered in negotiations, wrapped up-the ‘IUD
copper and brass conference ;here on Oct. 27 and '28. Thediscussion in most groups
centered’ on an analysis of present contract provisions, including wage scales at the
variousproperties, the financial -standings of the copper corporations,‘ and the range

of contract expiration dates.

_  At these smaller gatherings, .too, delegates had the opportunity to get better
acquainted with each other—an important factor in the

inated bargaining in 1967 and fu-
ture years. '
The discussions involved Ken-
necott ‘Copper, the Anaconda
,, Company, American Smelting
and Refining, Phelps Dodge, Re-
vere Copper and Brass, the Sco-
vill Manufacturing Corporation,

~Cerro Corporation, and Calumet

‘ and Hecla. Although several del-
egates from American Metal Cli-
max properties were in attend-
ance, it was felt that there was
no need to repeat a similar
meeting of that group that had
been held only a few weeks pre-
viously.

- A, ‘De-|'erminq'l'i'6n Evidenced
- All of the non-ferrous metals
companies are racking up prof-
its for this year that show big

_ increases over the figures for

. the same period in 1965. This
fact undoubtedly added to the
determination expressed by the
delegates to make 1967 a big
year for thepunions.

The largest of the company
meetings was the Anaconda one,
‘chaired by Steve’ Harris, assist-
ant director of the IUD’s collec-
tive ‘bargaining. section, who
stated that there is a greater
need for bargaining coordina-

A tion here perhaps than with any
other company. Eight of the 11
.. international unions represented

Skinner, Molony Talks
“Let Industry Beware”

CHICAGO, Ill.—The new wind that is blowing in the American trade union move-
ment is of great concern to the country’s' corporations, Mine-Mill President A. C.
Skinner and Steelworkers Vice-President Joseph P. Molony told delegates to the IUD-
sponsored copper and brass conference last month, and, they added, for “damn good
reasons.” _

Pointing to the increasing militancy of labor’s rank-and-file generally during the
past few years, that has outstripped occasionally that of some union officials, both
focused primarily on developments in the non-ferrous metals industry that are caus-
ing company officials “great consternation.” The merger of Mine-Mill and the Steel-

 

workers, the two dominant un-
ions in the industry, they said,
and the coordination of bargain-
ing with all other unions in non-
ferrous metals hold great prom-
ise for the worker in bargaining
in 1967 and the years ahead.

Growing Corporate Power
Labor unity is particularly es-

sential in the face of the consoli-

dation of corporate power that

is now taking place in the U.S.,-

streslsed, Skinner, who expressed
great. confidence in the‘ rank-.
and-file understanding of that

need. Molony pointed toga joint‘

.-lvline-Mill»-Steelworkers cocktail
party on Oct. 25 as “the great-
est demonstration of-unity I’ve
ever’ witnessed!’ ' S

represented scores of locals of
-11 international unions, ':on Oct.‘ 
27, prior "to_.the time that,_the'y‘

   

broke up into smaller company-
wide conferences.

In addition-to the gains at the
bargaining table that unity can
bring,‘ Molony pointed to its im-
portance in the area of organiz-
ing the unorganized. Of Ameri-
ca’s 35 million poor, he said,
only some 41/2 million are un-
employed, while the others are
working for inadequate wages in
unorganized plants. S

Both men were warmly re-
ceived by" the delegates to_ the
IUD «conference, frequently be-

‘ing interrupted by applause.

bers of the Mine-Mill execu-

Burke Addresses Caucus

Burke, who declared that the
September convention of the
Steelworkers “had nothing but
acclaim” for the merger dis-
cussions between the officers of
the two unions, said "that the
new officers of the USWA were
making S every effort to -“get
back to good_, honest-to-God
trade, unionism.” The move
towards labor unity in the non-
ferrous .metals industry, I he
termed a “monumental land-
mark” in ‘his nearly 30»'years in
the labor movement.

tors on which substantial 1967 a

company profits, increased pro-
ductivity, and the continuing ,
rise in the cost of living, which V 
is wiping out many of the gains , . _
made in 1964. While the profits ‘ " ; l
of all U.S. corporations com- /
ibined are up 36 percent since
1963, emphasized Dichter, non-

wo N. M. Accidents

 f1BAYARD_, N. M‘.-—Four members of Mine-Mill Local
i89_O"nar1'owly escaped death recently in two separate acci-
-dents. Two of the men had to be hospitalized with second
and-' third- degree burns and suffering from electrical
shock when the equipment they were operating contacted
a 24,000-volt power line. The other two workers escaped
injury when the truck in which they were riding plunged
“down a 60-foot embankment.

  

On October 19, Robert B. Miranda, truck driver, and
Paul Hernandez, truck» driver helper, were instructed to

move a pump and pump head
from the Apache pump station.
‘N“"The material to be moved was
located in a storage area di-
rectly under a high power line,
strung 21 _feet above the ground.
Operating a Pitman Hydra-
Lift‘ mounted on a ' flat bed
truck, Miranda had already
loaded-the pump head. In doing
so, he had to elevate the ‘boom
to a 45-degree angle over the
truck to bring the load over the
V. ﬂat bed. Without lowering the
boom, Miranda had started to

Prolit Records

The American Smelting and
Refining Company recently
announced new profit records
—both for the three-month pe-
riod ending September 30,
1966 and for the total nine
months of the year.

Earnings in the July-Sep-
tember quarter were $18,650,-
000, up a whopping 42 percent
over the same period of 1965.
Nine-month figures for this
year were $48,122,000, up 15
percent over the first nine
months of 1965.

The company declared a
special 50-cent dividend for
stockholders, over and above
the regular quarterly 75-cent
dividend.

Job Security Top OCAW Demand

The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, representing
60,000 refinery workers, have listed contract proposals for 400
agreements, most of which terminate December 31. Their major
demand is for guaranteed employment for every regular and per-
manent employee until he retires on an adequate pension. Total
wage demands for a two-year agreement come to 36 cents, 18 cents
January 1, 1967, and 1968, of which 6 cents is proposed to applyto
health and welfare—in most cases to reduce present employee
contributions.

NMU Postpones Reopening Contract’,-.
The National Maritime Union has announcedgit will “hold off
reopening its contract with the shippers until next year. The NMU
contract, which expires June 15, 1969, may be reopened in either
1966 or 1967. The union points out that the terms of the reopener
will be more favorable in 1967. , '7
The contract provides that all unresolved questions must go to
binding arbitration. However, if the reopener is invoked in 1966,
the arbitrator may take into account only changes in the total cost

to the industry of wages and fringes since 1965. If reopening is”

deferred until next year, the arbitrator is authorized to take into
account also the change in general living costs. -

NMU President Joseph Curran estimates that wage costslhave
risen less than one percent, but that living costs by 1967 will have
risen by four percent. Therefore, says Curran, it will be possible
to secure a better settlement by waiting a year.

Senior Citizens Answer Reader's Digest

Reader's Digest, in its September issue, attacked the National
Council of Senior Citizens for its support of social security, medi-
care, minimumwage, repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley
Act, and other legislation supported by unions. The Digest, -long
criticized as anti-labor, got a sharp reply from the Senior Citizens;

“We found that the elderly poor have a much more difficult .
struggle for existence in the 19 states which have so-called ‘right I
to work’ laws. . . . Average payments of old age assistance, aid to ‘ '

the blind, aid to the permanently disabled are much lower in-the
‘right to work’ states than in the free bargaining states. Thus the
elderly have very pertinent reasons for repealing 14(b) of Taft-‘

 Housewives’ Food Boycott Spreads;

 Women Organize in Nearly 100 Cities

DENVER, Colo.—Angered over skyrocketing food. prices,. housewives here on Oct. .17. started a boycott against.
major chain supermarkets that has now. spread to includuehalf -of the large food chains-in— the United -States. -
Women across the country are now demanding. that food prices be reduced, andthat games, gimmicks androther -.

promotional devices used by the stores be done away With, claiming that they have contributed to the spiraling

costof food.

The Denver boycott, ‘after succeeding in __its_airn toforce ‘five chain ‘stores to. reduce their prices, is virtually at

an. end. Meanwhile women in
nearly 100 other cities are mak-
ing their demands known. Their
. objective is a common one——
lower food prices.
In Charlotte, N. C., women

have set up a “talk r‘ally”‘to _
' lay the foundation for a protest

‘demonstration at every food

 _store in the city.

A“ boycott" has been organized
by the women in Butte, Mont.

—including the wives of. many_

Mine-Mill Local No. 1 mem-
bers-—using the miner’s union
hall as their headquarters.

In Decatur, Ga., housewives
have started a telephone,cam-
paign to ask their friends and
neighbors to stop buying at the
chain stores and to patronize
-the" smaller ‘markets. _

Another telephone campaign
is in full swing in Schenectady,
N. Y., where the women are
drumming up support for a
chain store boycott.

In Clearwater, Fla., a group
of irate women planned what
they termed a “Halloween .Re-
bellion” to begin on Monday,
Oct. 31.

Other major cities that have
been affected by this house-
wives “war on supermarkets”
inc_lu'de Philadelphia, Pitts-
burgh, Detroit, Miami, Phoenix,
Buffalo, Los Angeles, and Wash-
ington, D. C.

How did this “war” start?
Early last month a small group
of housewives here decided to
do something about the contin-
ual rise in the price of food.
With the usual determination
of the weaker sex, they circu-
lated petitions, to be presented
to every legislator in Color_ado
and to every Senator and Con-
gressman in Washington, asking

that a thoroughinvestigation be
made into‘ the business prac-
tices of the large chain stores.

_‘Within a week their ranks
_swe1l_ed to 500- or. more, and, en-

At first the stores paid very
little attention to the threatened
boycott. They implied, in fact,
that if -tl"e women didn’t like

the prices, they could shop
elsewhere. The efforts "of the
ladies to publicize their move-
ments were frustrated in the be-
ginning. Daily newspapers, reap-
ing millions of dollars annually
from food advertisements, could
hardly be expected to bite the
hands that feed them. But be-
fore another week had passed,
such wide’-spread support for
the boycott had developed that
these determined gals could no
longer be ignored.

On Monday, Oct. 17, the boy-
cott began. Operating without
funds and with only a loose or-
ganizational structure, the

housewives stopped buying at

the chain stores.

Mrs.'P_aul West, head of the -

Housewives for Lower Food

flation in recent months.

Yet there was more left un-
said by the store officials, than
was made public in their state-
ments. For example, nothing
was mentioned about the costs
involved in maintaining bingo
games, sweepstakes racing
games, trading stamps and
other “give-aways” used in their
advertising campaigns. T h e y
also forgot to mention that food
chains, which do 60-70 percent
of the food retailing in this area,
actually set prices on many
foods.

Vegetable growers have com-
plained that they can’t sell to
supermarket chains except at
prices set by the stores. They
cite, for example, the importa-
tion of potatoes from Oregon

, which are held over theheads
of the Colorado growers. Beans

Ollphant in The Denver Post

are imported from Texas while
locally grown beans are left to
rot in the fields unless the chain
stores get them for the price
they want.

Price Manipulation

The chain food stores have

also been charged with manipu-
lating prices for meat. Cattle-
men say that beef has been
selling for less than $30 on the
hoof since 1952, except during
1956 and 1962. From 1946 to 1952,
fat cattle in Omaha was sell-
ing for between $30 and $40,
yet meat was cheaper at retail
then than it is today.

A recent report by the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, after a
two-month investigation of bread
and milk prices, states, “The
actual increases in retail prices
were about double the step up
in milk prices at the farm level

.2 1 November. T966

Mrs. Paul West
Denver Boycott Leader

and retail bread prices were

about three times ‘greater’ than

the advance in farm ingredient .

costs to bakers.”

Investigation Probable

With the recent attention fo-
custed on the supermarkets, it
appears that a federal investiga-
tion into practices of the retail
food industry‘ is imminent.
There seems to be a growing
uneasiness in Washington since
the boycotts began, largely be-
cause there is no single federal
agency set up to exercise__a con-

tinuous vigil over the nation's

food marketing system.

Although the housewives. are
accomplishing what they set out
to do, there have been some
bad side effects caused by the
boycotts. Many stores are re-
ducing the work week of -some
employees and others have suf-
fered from lay-offs. Clerks and
carry-out boys have already lost
jobs in Butte, Mont. and in
Carlsbad, N. M. Other stores
have announced that they will
cut expenses by eliminating
some services and jobs. Few
chains have been willing to re-
duce expenses where they can
most economically do so — in
th e i r flamboyant advertising
campaigns and come-ons.

The effects of the boycott will
be felt for months to come. ‘All
of this due to a group of house-
wives who start a movement
which, in less than a month's
time, turned one of America’s
largest industries topsy turvy.

‘ Expanded Production at Inspiration

Inspiration Consolidated Copper, which recently shut down its
‘underground mine at Christmas, Arizona, announced that it will
expand production at its open pit mine at Christmas and sell the
output at 47 cents per pound, effective November 1. The company,
-27.7 percent controlled by Anaconda Company, has been selling
its other production at 38 cents, two cents higher than the major
producers. It will now post a composite price, between 38 and

C 47 cents, depending on the proportion of ore contained from each

of the two mines. At the beginning, the new pricing policy will
probably result in a 40-cent-per-pound quotation.

The price-of ‘lead dropped one cent on October '10,'to14 cents

j'_  'eForeign lead has been freely available in. the United States
since import quotas were dropped in October, 1965, and a recent

Exchangeprice down to 11 cents—-4 cents below the U.S. price.
Even “with the addition of import duty and shipping costs on 11-cent

« _lead, U.S. producers could not meet the competition. Their answer

was the one-cent price cut.
 Only. a month‘ earlier, Francis Cameron, president of St. Joseph

tons, less than consumption and that the shortage was being filled

Rather Fight Than Switch

The Copper Development Association, trade organization of the
industry, is fighting back against a campaign to persuade copper
users to switch to aluminum. A full page ad in the American Metal
Market, leading trade journal, replies to similar ads by the alumi-
num industry, pointing out the fabricating advantages of copper,
its growing availability, and the relative stability of the domestic
producers’ price. They hope that copper users,. too, would rather
fight than switch. * * *

Wagelncrease for Zambian Miners

A Zambian government commission recently recommended an
immediate wage increase of22’percent minimum for native African
workers. and abolition of thetraditional "wage diﬁerential. which
-provides. higher.-pay for. white. workers. As the «Mine-Mill-Union
.goes to press, word has comethat theindustry has agreed to the
wage increase. Abolition of the dual pay scale isstill in negoti-
ation; ‘ ‘ ‘ A ~ ' ~
I There are 43,000 African workers in Zambian copper and 5,000
whites. ' i _ ’ '

As a result of the increase, Africans will receive’ $75.60 per
month base pay, up from $61.60. The maximum, now $3_92,—will
increase to $518. per month. Further increases wouldresult from
equalizing the wages rates: a white shift boss now "makes $504 a
month, an African shift boss, $308. ’ -- V 

The two major Zambian‘ producers, Roan-Selection Trust and
Anglo-American Corporation, estimate the wage increase will cost
them about $10,300,000 a year. If the dual pay scale is abolished,
another $9 to $12 million will be involved’. -

I

The safety committee of Mine-Mill Local 938 makes periodic safety inspections of the Magma
Copper Company’s underground mine in Superior, Ariz. Following is the full text of the committee’s
comments and recommendations following an inspection on Oct. 1, as submitted to the company by

Serafin Herrera, chairman:

“1) 2855 N 4 stope. Crew com-
mended for having a nice clean
working place. .

. 2) 2910 3 2/5 raise. Spreaders
and stulls are needed over in-
cline raise to support broken
timber. Replacement of broken
capsand post in front of electric
slusher. Better guards are need-
ediinfront of the’ slusher. A
cave-in has started over this
slusher and this should be

" cribbed to protect, man operat-

ing the slusher. _
. 3) _2950 N 10 -stope., This stope

‘3'is- being mined under beams,
‘Z and 5-foot bolts are needed to"
.: » support the’ east wall. Two-way‘
. 2. ;: signals are needed to protect-the ‘
-2 .; crew in 2950 stope and crew,
, above. Fan is needed to pull"

. out fog created by drilling, as‘

this condition makes it hard for
the men to see while they are
working. ‘

 4') 3000 N 10 stope. This stop-e

.‘ is being jmined without timber
‘ ; and‘ more bolts-and mats, are
‘ needed on the hanging wall and
I east wall. The electric cable.
' .tha_t.is ‘running up.the incline to
---. _a‘ fan should be removed as
* two men were shocked from this

cable and one of the men is still
off work.

5) 3000 9 3/ ore pass. One
more set of timber should be
put in under brow, north of the
ore pass.

6) 3000 8 4/ raise. No sug-
gestion or recommendations, but
request discussion.

7) 3000 level. West of 60 raise
and between air doors where
drift is in the raw, we suggest
sealing, and more back lagging

’ where timber is. West of small

carrier station some sealing is
needed as this is a much trav-
eled drift.

8) No. 6 shaft. The cagers
have been operating the cage

. without radio signals for three

or four days at #4 compart-
ment.

9) 3070 N raise. Entrance. to
stope and travel way unsafe.
Needs major repair work. Caps
and post in the raise need
changing.

10) 3080 N 4. Stope caved in
and the spilling used here is not

,_ good enough for - ground sup-

port. Incline should be repaired

Mountain Copper Company; The
following is quoted from the
provision:

“Notwithstanding any other

a provision of this agreement, no

employee shall be required to
perform services that seriously
endanger his physical safety and
under conditions which would be
contrary to the provisions of
the company’s safety code or
the recommendations of a joint
Management-Union Safety Com-
mittee, or any applicable sani-
tary or safety provisions of the
Labor Code of the State of Cali-
fornia. An employee’s refusal
to perform such services under
such conditions shall not ‘war-
rant or justify his discharge.”

Cadmium in Air

May Be Hazardous

Dr. Robert E_. Carroll of the
U. S. Public Health Service re-

~ ports that cities with high con-

centrations of cadmium in the

-air also report high death rates

from heart disease. He cites
Chicago, Philadelphia, Indian-
apolis,‘ Newark and New York
in this category. Las' Vegas,
Nev., Eugene, Ore., and Chatta-
nooga, Tenn., on the other hand,
had the lowest levels of atmos-
pheric cadmium and low heart
disease rates. ’
Chemists say cadmium is dis-
charged intotheair in smelting

ores or in roasting cadmium-

bearing or plated metal. Lead
and zinc ores are the principal
primary sources of cadmium.

For Second While
House (lonierence

WASHINGTON, D.C. -— A
White House Conference on
Mexican-American Affairs,
similar to the high level civil
rights conference of several
months ago that was attend-
ed by hundreds of Negro
leaders from throughout the
country, will be held next
May in this city or in the
Southwest. The 1967 meet-
ing, plans for which began
to be formulated last month,
is expected to cover a broad
range of problem areas for
the minority group mem-
ber and specifically the Mexi-
can-American-a,mong them
educational opportunities,
employment, and housing.

On Oct. 19, some 20 Mexi-
can-American leaders met
with Willard Wirtz, Secre-
tary of Labor, David" North,
an assistant, and Clifford
Alexander, -a
aide, to discuss and outline
the direction to be taken by
the conference. One of the
key subjects discussed, . ac-
cording to Mine-Mill Board"
Member ~Maclovio R. Bar-.
raza, who was in attendance,
was the application of the
National Labor» Relations Act
to agricultural workers.

This subject, Barraza said,
may well be on the agenda
for the May ‘ conference,
along with other labor-relat-
