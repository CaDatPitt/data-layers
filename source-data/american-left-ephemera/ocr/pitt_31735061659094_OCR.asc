“Andrew Avery,” who takes extraordinary precautions
to conceal his identity and ﬁnancial backers, launched the
anti-union drive by raising the “Reds control unions”
issue in time for the ’46 Congressional campaign. This
was followed quickly by a similar propaganda campaign
directed by key industrialists running the Chamber of
Commerce of ‘the United States. Basically, the propa-
ganda stated that Communists sought control of unions
not to get increased wages for members but to create dis-
sension and turmoil as part of a plot to turn the United
States (and practically the rest of the world) over to
Russia. .

10. As a basic appeal to get support from all classes
of Germans, I-Iitler used the slogan that he wanted to save
them “from Communism.” In the United States, propa-
gandists employed by the Chamber of Commerce used the
same cry in the ’46 Congressional elections to get an anti-
Union Congress elected which would pass the anti—union
bills.

11. Hitler got_support from some members of the
Catholic hierarchy on the anti-Communist issue. After
seizing power he persecuted Catholics as well as other

minorities. In the United States, the anti—union Chamber ,

of Commerce of the United States recommends Father
John F. Cronin, of the National Catholic Welfare Confer-
ence, as a source for securing secret agents to investigate
trade unions which are alleged to be “Red.” V

These few similarities alone are suﬂicient to arouse
grave apprehensions as to the ultimate objectives of those
powerful industrialists ﬁnancing the move to shackle the
trade unions and, under a Hitler—like smoke screen of
“save America from the Communists,” to destroy the gains
made by labor in the past decades.

2. BEHIND THE DRIVE

Fox THE READER to get a picture of the immediate causes

_ behind this drive it is necessary to consider brieﬂy the post— "

war labor problem confronting American business and in-
dustry: that of a widely anticipated recession or depression
with its inevitable increase in the number of jobless.

.Hitler came to power in Germany in the depths of a
world economic crisis. The number of unemployed in
Germany was tremendous in proportion to its population,
The problem of what -to do with these unemployed mil-
lions was not solved until Hitler put them to work pro-
ducing for war. _

In that period the United States, too, had a huge un-
employed army. Our economic life“‘Was badly dislocated.
Leading industrialists, who opposed any interference with
“free enterprise” which led them to the greatest depres-
sion the world had ever seen, had no solution acceptable
to the American people. The political leaders then in oﬁice
could offer a jobless and bewildered people only the vague
assurance that “prosperity was just around the corner.”
The reader may remember that every time Herbert
Hoover, Republican President of the United States, issued
another forecast about where he saw prosperity, the stock
market took another crash, more businesses closed their
doors and more people were thrown out of work. It got so
the whole country had the jitters every time Hoover saw
prosperity. '

When a thoroughly alarmed people turned Hoover out
of oﬂice and installed Franklin D. Roosevelt, the new
Presidenttook prompt measures to save the countryfrom
the abyss into which the industrialists, functioning politi-
cally through the Republican Party, had led it. But, despite
“ 9 ' .

 

 

Roosevelt’s emergency measures’, i including vast public
works projects, we too did not "substantially solve‘ our
huge unemployment problem until we began to manufac-
ture arms and munitions as the “arsenal of democracy.”

Our millions of jobless found work not because of a
proper adjustment of our economy, but from temporary
war production. Once this production ceased, as it has now
ceased, and production of civilian goods not manufactured
during the war began to drop because of falling purchasing
power, we should be back to where we were: millions of
jobless walking the streets hunting for work to keep alive.

This looming unemployment problem is basically what
American industrialists faced.

In a period of great unemployment when the purchas-
ing power of a people has been reduced, a high level of
proﬁts can be maintained only by reducing Wages, increas-
ing working hours, and generally lowering the people’s
living standards. a

Under Roosevelt, labor had made tremendous strides.
Laws were passed which helped build trade unions, and, by
the power of their unity, organized workers achieved a
relatively high standard of living. So long as these work-
ers remained strongly organized the industrialists, like
those of Germany, were helpless to take such steps as they
wished. The prime essential for the industrialists in antici-
pation of a growing army of jobless, was ‘to weaken the
unions and place them under a control the industrialists
could not wield directly. ‘Such control can be wielded by
Congress.

Hitler utilized the policy of “divide and conquer” to
achieve ‘domination over all phases of German life. Once
the people were split into opposing camps, snarling at one
another on racial, religious, and economic matters, . they

’ 10

 

 

were weakened and then easily controlled or dominated’.
The two issues he used most were the “menace of Com-
munism” and “the Jews.” Anti-Semitic propaganda is now
Widely recognized as a Nazi tactic. The same is not yet true
about hysterical cries to “save the country from the Reds.”
Those in Germany who questioned whether the ‘Jews and
the Communists. were really responsible for every ill that
beset the whole world, including inability to ﬁnd work,
were denounced as unpatriotic,- Bolshevik secret agents,
or Jewish plotters and silenced in concentration camps.

In this country it would not be wise at this time for the
industrialists to ﬁnance an anti-Semitic campaign, but -the
second Hitler tactic of “save the country from the Reds”

‘is now in full swing. Details of this “Red menace” drive

are handled by propagandists employed by leading Ameri-
can industrialists working primarily through the Chamber

-of Commerce of the United States with headquarters in

Washington, D. C.

3. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
OF THE U. s.

Two oRoAN1zAT1oNs powerful in propaganda and lobbying

direct the drive to create a “Red menace” smoke screen
behind which the trade unions can be weakened" and
shackled. They are the National Association of Manu-
facturers and the Chamber of Commerce of the United
States. 
The Chamber is the shock troop division in the cam-
paign. It can use almost 3,000 aﬁiliated local chambers of
commerce C scattered throughout the country and whose
membership /is often the dominant inﬂuence in their com-
A -l l

 

  

 

munities. The average business man, however, who is a
member of his local chamber, has practically no say in de-
termining the major policies followed by the National
Chamber. .

The N atioﬁal Association of Manufacturers is composed
of over 3,000 corporations, chieﬂy engaged in manufac-
turing or utility services, located in every section of the

country. Its members employ one out of every four per-

sons working in the United States.

Before 1933 the National Association was run by _com—
paratively small business men. After 1933, when Roose-
velt took oﬂice and pro-labor measures were inaugurated,
the N.A.M. was reorganized, and ruling ma j or industrial-
ists in the country took over its direction.

_ In 1912 the comparatively Weak N.A.M. founded the
Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. as a central body to be
located in Washington, D. C., to inform the Congress what
American business wanted. _ K

The average local Chamber of Commerce member has
little to do with directing the activities of the national
Chamber. Oﬂicers of huge corporations manageito get on
and stay on the two committees which actually run the na-
tional Chamber: the Executive and the Committee on
Finance, Budget, and Audit. The Executive Committee is
composed of the President of the national Chamber and
eleven directors. Though the appointments are for one
year terms, the same individuals, with but an occasional
change, are found year in and year out on this key con-
trolling committee. The Committee on Finance super-
vises the Chamber’s ﬁnancial affairs by allocating the sums
to be spent on propaganda and lobbying.

The men in the most strategic positions in the national
Chamber are also "key men in the National Association of

12

 

 

Manufacturers. The men themselves are of secondary im-.

portance. They simply put into effect policies of the pow-
erful industrial concerns they represent. Space prohibits

going into the details of the tie—ups of some of these
‘companies With the Nazi industrialists who backed and

supported Hitler in his plan to establish fascism in Ger-
many, and I shall give only two or three illustrations:
Earl O. Shreve, of New York, vice president of Gen-
eral Electric Co., is currently president of the national
Chamber. Shreve, also a key man in the N.A.M., was on
the Executive Committee of the Chamber before he be-
came its president. His ﬁrm had tie—ups with Nazi indus-
trialists and continued these tie-ups even after Hitler
launched the Second World War in 1939, and we were
manufacturing desperately to prepare for our own defense.
The tie—ups with the Nazi industrialists who helped Hit-
ler to power did not end until 1941 when we declared

ii 

Clark H. Minor, chairman of the Executive Committee
of International General Electric Co., a subsidiary of Gen-
eral Electric, is on the Executive Committee of the Cham-
ber. This ﬁrm, like its parent organization, had tie—ups
with Nazi industrialists. N

Marion B. Folsom of Rochester, N. Y., treasurer of
Eastman Kodak Co., is on the Executive Committee of the

 Chamber and is also a key man in the N.A.M. Eastman

Kodak was tied up with Nazi industrialists.

That huge ﬁrms, doing an international business, had
tie-ups with foreign industrialists is normal and not par-
ticularly.signiﬁcant. But it is signiﬁcant that American

L industrialists made agreements with Nazi industrialists

who backed Hitler and that these agreements curbed our
own defense production. American ﬁrms which made
13 _

such agreements with the Nazis are among those back-
ing the same kind of propaganda to destroy American trade
unions that the Nazis used to destroy German trade unions.
Not until the German trade unions had been weakened to
the point of impotence did Nazism dare to take the high
road to concentration camps, and later, to extermination
camps. , ,

Many little White crosses mark the graves of American
boys, buried in foreign lands because we did not have the
material to give our soldiers. How many died because of
such agreements by American ﬁrms, Whose oﬂicers are in
key positions in the Chamber and the N .A.M., will prob-
ably never be known. The. evidence brought out by a
United States Senate Committee hearing on some of the
agreements Was so startling that at one time Harry S.
Truman, the present Chief Executive, who was then lead-
ing a Senate investigation, exclaimed, “This is treason!”

Nazi industrialists with whom some of our leading
American ﬁrms had tie—ups are among those’ indicted byrthe
United States as War criminals. The crimes charged against
these Nazi industrialists are as horrifying as those com-
mitted by the Gestapo, and extended to the running‘ of
their own industrial slave labor camps in which an average
of 100 men, Women, and children died each day literally
from being Worked to death. Those who did not drop dead
on the job but who became so exhausted that they could
no longer Work were sent oﬁ to be slaughtered in extermi-
nation camps. These are not my charges. These are charges

made bythe United States Government in its indictments

of twenty-four leading German industrialists connected
with I. G. Farben. These are the sort‘ of men our own

industrialists dealt with, and the American ﬁrms which

made agreements with such Nazis are among those today
14

 

 

 

 

directing the Chamber of Commerce drive to destroy the
American trade unions. » V .

The anti—union record of key. ﬁrms in the Chamber also
is long. I shall offer’ only a couple to'ill_ustrate their atti-
tude toward union labor: _ ’

Roy C. Ingersoll, president, Ingersoll Div., Borg—War—
ner, is in a key position in the Chamberand the N.A.M.
This ﬁrm employedlabor spies on a large scale to keep its
employees from organizing, until the employment of labor

' spies was made illegal during the Roosevelt" Administra-

tions. . p .

W.‘ Gibson Carey, president of Yale & Towne Manu-
facturing Co., also is in a key position in the Chamber and
the N.A.M. This ﬁrm, too, employed labor spies on a

/‘large scale to keep its employees from organizing. Its at-

tempt to break a strike of its Workers produced city—Wide
protest stoppages by both A. F. of L. and C.I.O. unions.

The United States, in its indictment of the heads of
I. G. Farben, charged oﬂicially that this huge German ﬁrm
had made an agreement with Hitler in 1932, one year be-
fore he assumed power. German industrialists, faced with
a chaotic economy and unemployment resulting from their
“free enterprise,” Wanted fascism. As William Yande_ll'
Elliott, professor of Government, 'Harvard University,
stated: “Fascismis effectively controlled by the banking
interests and the big industrialists to Whom it grants spe-
cial favors and control over‘ the state’s ﬁnances.”

Fascism also controls the trade unions. Strikes are
prohibited. Since fascism is controlled by the industrial-
ists and fascism controls the trade unions, the industrialists
control the unions. Aunion, instead of being a medium‘
through which organized workers can make and enforce
demands for wages to enable them to live tori a decent

; 15. .

 

standard, becomes a company union run by political agents
of the industrialists. That is why German industrialists
ﬁnancially backed Hitler. if

On November 29, 193 8, when Nazi propagandists were
very active here, some 200 American industrialists gath-
ered in Philadelphia for a Chamber of Commerce regional
meeting. The region included Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and Delaware.

Business was improving at the time. The country was
emerging from the disastrous depression which had hit us
,3; nine years earlier. Mass unemployment was fast becoming
1; _ a memory. Workers, due to legislation friendly to labor,
.; were organizing rapidly. Unions were growing in strength
and successfully demanding Wage increases to meet rising
living costs. This was the trade union picture when the
Chamber’s regional session opened.

At this meeting H. W. Prentiss, president of the Arm-
strong Cork Co. of Lancaster, Pa. , frankly told the gather-
ing that American business men might eventually be forced
to turn to “some form of disguised dictatorship to bring
order out of chaos.” .

Since there was no chaos in the United States at that
time, unless workers joining unions and the Congress pass-
ing pro-labor legislation can be considered chaos, this ex-
presses the attitude of more than one industrialist who saw
in a “disguised form of dictatorship” the only Way to solve
the trade union problem. ,

The rising opposition to fascism by Americans, how-
, ever, made it necessary to Consider bringing it on in a “dis-
 guised” form lest the people suspect what the industrial-
ists were trying to do and show their displeasure in no un-
mistakable Way.

The swift outbreak of war in Europe and our own hatred

16

 

   

 

of Nazism caused the further voicing of such ideas to be
considered unwise. But, with the end of hostilities, when

_‘the unstable war economy began to revert with creaks and

groans to peacetime requirements, “free enterprise” ex-
pected another army of jobless. It was essential that trade
unions be shorn of their strength if wage scales were to be

‘reduced. The first step was to get support from the mil-

lions of War veterans of both world" wars, many of whom
were trade union members. Since no trade union member
is likely to support a move to cut his wages, his approval
had to be won by deception.

Hitler realized that before he could establish a fascist

dictatorship he needed popular support from two bodies

of organized men: the veterans and the trade unionists.
Since many veterans were also trade unionists, support
from veterans meant support from an important segment
of the trade union movement. Hitler, ably assisted by
Goebbels, launched an intensive propaganda campaign to
“save the country from Communism.” He did not inform
the veterans or the trade union members of the ﬁnancial
backing he got from the industrialists.

4. AMERICAN ACTION APPEARS

WHAT HE DID WITH THIS support, after» raising the “Red
menace” issue, is now history. In the United States, a
political organization, also ﬁnanced by industrialists whose
names are kept secret, suddenly appeared shortly after the
war ended, and raised the cry of “save the country from
alien-minded radicals”——Communists, to be more speciﬁc.

Two months after Germany surrendered, Upton Close,

‘air by James S. Kemper, treasurer of the Republican
Party, and Merwin K. Hart, an apologist for General-

issimo Franco of Spain, and his fascist government, formed

an organization called American Action. V
It made its bow to the public as a patriotic body dedi-
cated to oppose “alien-minded radicals.” It was to be the
spearhead in raising a “menace of Communism” issue
in the 1946 Congressional campaign. _ .
Its ostensible purpose was to defeat C.I.O.-P.A.C. ap-
proved candidates; and it described itself as a “militant
movement, local and national in scope, carefully planned
by Democrats, Republicans and Independents.” The very“
ﬁrst plank in its platfrom gave its objective as: ’

“To organize the great majorities of the Right
more effectively than alien-minded radicals have or-
ganized the vociferous minorities of the Left.”

P.A.C., which had carried on an effective campaign for
Roosevelt in ’44-, had proved that when trade union mem-
bers are informed which candidates are friends of the peo-
ple and which favor the big money boys, they will vote for
those who will represent the people. About the only way
to counteract this i growing trade union‘ political activity

was to split the union ranks via “the big lie” technique——'

the assertion that P.A.C. was “alien-minde ”—to produce
the desired impression that it was Communist controlled.
When added to that,‘a wave of propaganda was spread
that Communists are “agents of a foreign government”
the effect was the one planned: many union members who
Wanted to go along with P.A.C. would Wonder if they
,Were being imposed upon by “agents of a foreign govern-
ment.” It was the old “divide and conquer” business.

American Action, which went- to the public for sup-

vi port to “save the countryfrom the Reds,” started oﬁ with
x a lot of secrecy, ﬁrst by concealing the notorious names

of its original organizers. The original National Council

, of American Action did not mention Merwin  Hart or
C Upton Close. Though these claim that the bright idea was

theirs, they thought it advisable to keep their names out of
it lest their obviously anti-union background arouse sus-
picions that they had undisclosed objectives in their yen
to save the country. ’

Six persons were named to the National_ Council: an
employee of a Los Angeles department store, a U.S. Army
Air Force colonel, a North ‘Carolina attorney 5 a southern
State Commissioner of Agriculture; a small Idaho book
and pamphlet publisher, «and, as national treasurer, W.

. Homer Hartz, a Chicago industrialist who had been presi-

dent of the Illinois Manufacturers Association. Hartz
was not particularly known to veterans and trade union
members as anti-union but he was known to anti-union

' industrialists.

(As soon as the anti-union Congress was elected,
Hartz appeared, on Feb. 6, 1947, before the U.S. Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Committee as the oﬂicial spokes-
man for the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. A num-
ber of the anti--union “reforms” he urged are now part of
the Taft—Hartley bill which took away gains labor made
after years of struggle.) C 

Other and better known names were subsequently
added, men like General Leonard Wood, head of Sears,
Roebuck, and Robert Harriss, Wall Street broker, friend
and co-worker of Father Charles  Coughlin, the Detroit
radio priest who spread pro-Nazi propaganda issued by
Goebbels in Berlin. General Wood’s name could be

counted on to attractthe old America First crowd which
was quite large before the war. Harriss’ closeness to
Father Coughlin was known to Coughlinites, who were
numerous before the Detroit priest was silenced by his
Archbishop. Harriss’ name on the Executive Committee
of American Action could be depended on to persuade
Coughlinites that the organization should be supported.
The foundation for a mass appeal to millions was being

laid. ’

_ The National Council, and later the Executive Commit-
‘tee, were apparently chieﬂy “fronts”——names used to give
the organization a respectable air.‘ For men excited about.

the imminent threat to the country by the Reds, the Execu-
tive Committee members were indiﬁerent about going to
meetings to devise ways of “saving the country.” I quote
from a letter Written by one of the briginal National Coun-
cil and later, Executive Committee, boys: James H. Gip-
son, president of Caxton Printers of Caldwell, Idaho. Mr.
Gipson publishes books and pamphlets. Apparently he
himself did not swallow the propaganda American Action
was feeding the people for he did not attend even a single
meeting. Gipson wrote: -

“I have never attended a meeting of American
Action. I allowed my name to be used as a member
of the Executive Board, because I was and am in
sympathy with the expressed objectives of American
Action, but I resigned recently as a member of the
Board, because I felt that I could not give the time
and attention to the organization. which it deserved.”

American Action, functioning as a political movement,
A 21

 

collected money to carry on campaigns in various (and
" only partially listed) Congressional districts, but it kept

the names of the anti-union industrialists who helped
ﬁnance its activities-—-men like Ernest T. Weir, chairman

of the board of Weirton Steel Co. and Lammot du Pont, ,

chairman of the board of E. I. du Pont de Nemours--
secret from the people it went to with its propaganda.

Under the federal Corrupt Practices Act all political
groups participating in federal elections are required by
law to ﬁle a report with the Clerk of the House of Rep-
resentatives listing their total receipts, who contributed
the money and how it was spent. American Action reported
that it received a total of almost $96,000 and spent over
$114,000 between Jan. 1, 194-6 and Oct. 31, 1946.

Who made up the difference of $18,000 is not men-
tioned’. Even more important, American Action listed
only a fraction of those who contributed even the $96,000
it admits receiving. N 0 one has challenged this partial re-
turn or demanded that the identities of the contributors
be made public. I

According to its own statement, American. Action went
into twenty—four Congressional‘districts _in the ’46 cam-
paign. It concentrated on thoseareas which were fairly
evenly divided between an anti-Roosevelt policy candidate
and a pro—Roosevelt policy one. In such districts, by sway-
ing a comparativelysmall number of voters, they hoped to
be the balance of power and swing the election for their
choice. ‘

_ In only eight districts did they claim to have been the
deciding factor. In the other districts they failed; but,
wherever they went, successful or not, they raised the
“Red menace” issue and called on the voters to elect the
man they backed as one not dominated by “alien—minded
22

 

 

radicals.” The appeal was made to all voters and particu-

‘ larly to veterans. . .
.Anti-unionists, using the Hitler propaganda tactic of .

raising a Red issue, captured control of Congress. Ameri-
can Action had demonstrated that the propaganda could be
used successfully. But liberal commentators" and a num-
ber of newspapers were disturbed. They pointed out that
men like Hart, who was pro-fascist, and Upton Close, who

was notoriously reactionary, brought the organization un—- ‘

der suspicion. «..When the public suspects an organization
its propaganda effectiveness is weakened, so those mysteri-
ous forces directing the organization asked Hart and Close
to resign—-which they did. American Action’s “Commu-
nist menace” propaganda would be more eﬁective if no
one could point the ﬁnger of suspicion that the organiza-

’ tion was pro-fascist. This was particularly important in in-

ﬂuencing the Votes of Veterans. These men had fought
fascism on the battleﬁeld and they, would not be swayed
by an organization suspected of being pro—fascist. Since

a many of these Veterans were trade unionists, propaganda
' which inﬂuenced them would also inﬂuence the internal

aﬁairs of the unions on the Red issue; thus, union ranks
could be split and the ﬁrst step in the “divide and con-
quer” tactic taken. A

It was necessary that a prominent war Veteran who had

“never been accused of being pro—fascist head the organi-

 

zation, one with suPﬁcient national standing to "line up both
American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts
to “savethe country from the Reds.”

Capt. Edward A. Hayes, a past National Commander
of the American Legion, was selected by those mysterious
personages moving behind thescenes of this “open politi-
cal movement.” The man delegated to oﬂer him the jo

and discuss its various phases was Upton Close who was

resigning to eliminate charges of pro-fascism against the
organization! A

What happened after the proposition was put to Capt.
Hayes to head the organization is best told by Capt. Hayes
himself. On Sept. 16, 194-6, just before the elections he
cautiously marked a letter “Conﬁdential” and wrote:

“Before undertaking direction of American Action,
the undersigned conferred with outstanding repre-
sentatives of anti—New Deal Democrats and with top-
ﬂight leaders of the Republican Party. Their judg-
ment was sought as to the practicability of our pro-
posed plan. In every instance, the writer received
assurance that in the judgment of the individual
interviewed, American Action, as planned by us,
would be most desirable.”

Thus, thismovement whose ﬁnancial backers are not dis-
closed held conferences with anti—union political leaders
of both parties. The veterans, the trade union members,
the small business men who were appealed to for support
on patriotic grounds were not told of these conferences.

It is obvious that if the country were really faced with a
“Red menace” Capt. Hayes did not have to conﬁne his
conferences only to anti-New Deal Democrats and top-
ﬂight Republican leaders. There are millions of honest
pro—Roosev_elt policy citizens who '-are as strongly anti-
Communist as Capt. Hayes. Labor leaders like William
Green and Phillip Murray are also opposed to Com-
munism. That they were not asked to “save the country
from alien-minded radicals” is in itself a confession that
the issue was not Reds but anti-unionism and that the Reds

were used just for a smoke screen.

The former Commander of the American Legion con-
tinued in the same letter:

“While it is not intended that participants in
American‘Action shall be limited to veterans, you are
entitled to know that the Writer, a past National Com-
mander of the largest veterans organization, has en-
listed the active support and is receiving most valu-
able‘assistan"ce from former leaders of various other
veterans organizations. These past associations make
it relatively easy to obtain in each [Congressional]
district selected, a nucleus of individuals known for
their loyalty and devotion to American ideals and
who, regardless of Party, can be expected to Work for
our objectives.”

Why an organization of patriotic Americans honestly
convinced that the country is menaced by Reds and which
goes to the people for support “regardless of Party,” ﬁnds
it advisable not to make public the names of anti-union in-
dustrialists ﬁnancing its propaganda drive, is 'a mystery.
Why patriotic Americans should ﬁnd it advisable to keep
from the voters to whom they appeal for backing the con-
ferences with anti-union politicians, is another mystery.
The War veteran Who faced enemy ﬁre on the battleﬁeld
to save his country from fascism is justiﬁed in asking Why
all this secrecy behind an honest patriotic effort to “save

V the country” from the Reds——and Whether that is the real

reason for its activities, or Whether the Red scare is not
just a smoke screen to put something over on the'American
people. Hitler, too, used a “Red menace” smoke screen to
help him get complete control over Germany.

N 0 American, honestly trying to save his country from

what he thinks is a threat, is ever ashamed of making his
name public. Americans trying to save theircountry from
menaces do not mark such efforts “Conﬁdential.”

_ In American Action We have an illustration of the “Red
menace” propagandists atwork: V

1. An organization is founded to “save the country” ‘

but the founders conceal their connection with it because
both are notoriously anti—union. '
2. Anti—union industrialists ﬁnance its propaganda and

political activities but that fact is kept from union Workers V

"Who are being propagandized.

3. Veterans are asked to back the effort to “save the
country” regardless of Party but meetings of the organiza-
tion’s head with anti—union politicians, are kept “conﬁ-
dential.” '

That’s how the “patriots” Work ‘to create a Red scare
behind which laws can be passed designed to batter down
the standard of living of 15,000,000 Americans and their
families.

There is much more that can be said about this organiza-
tion. I am conﬁning myself to a very brief picture of how
a Red scare issue is manufactured to create a smoke screen
under which the real objective can be attained: that of
weakening and controlling the trade unions. Hitler and
Goebbels used the same procedure. ‘

Hitler and Goebbels also realized that to be successful
in their “Red menace” propaganda they had to silence
critics Who Would Warn the German people of what was
happening. In the United States critics capable of Warn-
ing the people also Were silenced. And here We come to an
apparently unrelated “Red menace” drive from another
quarter which made the headlines at a moment so op-
portune that it could not have been better timed to achieve

its anti-union objectives, had the timing been arranged in
advance.

5. THE iUN—AMERICAN COM-
MITTEE’S TIMING '

THE ORIGINAL MEETING of American Action took place in
the summer of 194-5. By the time it was organized and
ready to function with propaganda on “alien-minded
radicals,” the Congressional Committee to Investigate
Un-American Activities became active in a way which
“just happened” to fall in perfectly With the Chamber of
Commerce’s anti-union drive.

Most members of this Committee are aﬂiliated with the
Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. through membership
in their local chambers.  Parnell Thomas, chairman ‘of
the Un-American Committee, for instance, has been a
member of the Bergen, N. _I., Chamber of Commerce for
years; Richard B. Vail, the Chicago industrialist member,
is proud that his Vail Manufacturing Co. has been a mem-
ber of the Chicago Association of Commerce for many
years; John McDowell, Committee member and news-
paper publisher in Wilkinsburg, Pa., has been a member
of the Wilkinsburg Chamber of Commerce for twenty
years. So it goes. None of them is a member of a trade
union, so far as I have been able to learn.

At this point in the picture of the anti-union drive be-
hind a “Red menace” smoke screen, it should be borne in
mind that immediately upon seizing power. Hitler took
over control of the radio. Once he had that, he could pre-
vent liberal German commentators from‘, warning the

28

 

 

. German_ people of the road down which they were being

led and, at the same time,,din his own Nazi propaganda
into the people’s ears. The radio was recognized by Hitler
as of such importance in inﬂuencing and molding public
opinion that it became an offense punishable by death for
Germans to listen to broadcasts other than those directed
by Goebbels.

In this country, when the ground work was ready for

‘ American Action to raise the “Red menace” issue for the

’4-6 campaign, the Un-American Committee in December,
194-5, suddenly issued subpoenas for the scripts of seven
radio commentators. The subpoenas were issued with the
usual fanfare of publicity about an investigation into “sub-
versive propaganda” spread over the air by the news
analysts. With such a publicity blast, the radio stations and
most sponsors were scared witless. The radio station owner
makes his money selling time on the air. If sponsors got
the idea that the station permitted “subversive propa-
ganda,” they would take their business elsewhere.

The result was that the seven commentators were quick-

. ly taken oﬁ the air. This was followed just as quickly by

similar action all over the country with regard to other
liberal commentators. Even where a sponsor was willing
to risk being smeared by keeping his commentator on the
air, radio stations refused to sell time lest it oﬂend other
sponsors and get the station ruinous publicity by being in-

vestigated by the Un-American Committee.

Though hailed as an investigation into subversive propa-
ganda only pro-Roosevelt policy commentators were
singled out and in time to prevent them from commenting
on the ’4-6 elections and the concerted drive against the
trade unions. The timing of this hunt for “subversive com-
mentators” might, of course, have been accidental, and it

29

 

 

 
 

might. also have been what the sporting world calls nice
teamwork. -

Space prohibits going into details of this Committee’s
long history of questionable acts and its penchant for
smearing patriotic liberals. Considering the sinister ulti-
mate objective behind this “Red menace”. smoke screen,
created by seemingly independent bodies, and the timing

of the Un-Ameri.can Committee’s acts which helped to

create a national hysteria, some phases of its activities
should be recorded since they indicate the development of
a privately run Gestapo ﬁnanced by public funds.

The ﬁles of this Committee are guarded carefully. It is

common talk on Capitol hill that even members of the

Un-American Committee do not have unrestricted access
to the ﬁles of their own Committee. ‘To get to them a
member has to get an okay from the Committee’s chair-
man, at the moment, J. Parnell Thomas.

A newspaper woman, working for a Washington, D. C.,
paper, went to the Committee’s oﬂices for a feature story.

A The clerk in the Committee room where she found herself

wasmout for a few minutes. One of the numerous card index
ﬁles for the multitudinous dossiers kept by the Committee
was on a desk and the reporter casually leafed through the
cards. To her astonishment the indexes showed that this
Congressional Committee had -dossiers on members of the
House as well as on the United States Senate.

Just how many Congressmen the Un-American Com-
mittee was keeping tabs on and how many Senators, she

did not learn. In the few minutes she had she found cards .

on ten. These names she promptly published. The Un-

American Committee never issued a denial. The Congress-

men on whom she found cards indicating dossiers were

Adolph Sabath, Warren G. Magnusseni (now a U.S.

Senator and personalfriend of Harry S. Truman), Usher
L. Burdick, Emanuel Cellar,. John Coﬁee, Samuel “Dick-
stein, Harry Senthoff, and Vito Marcantonio.

V The two Senators whose cardsshe found were- Claude
Pepper and Elbert D. Thomas. _ i ‘ A

Some Congressmen on whom the Un—American Com-
mittee had dossiers _were defeated in subsequent elections.
That a Congressman is defeated is not extraordinary but
that a Congressman is defeated by publication of Red
smears from the secret dossiers of the Committee, as in
the case of former Congressman Hugh de Lacey, of
Washington, is extraordinary for it points to interference
by a Congressional Committee in free elections and the use
of public funds to collect material used against Congress-
men that the Committee disapproves of.

In the ’46 campaign, when the mysteriously ﬁnanced
American Action had singled de Lacey out for defeatand
was raising a “Red menace” issue about him, material from
the Committee’s ﬁles appeared in a Seattle newspaper
whichsmeared de Lacey as a Red and succeeded in inﬂu-
encing enough voters to defeat him. The Un—American
Committee stated that material on de Lacey had vanished
from its ﬁles. So far as I know the Committee made no
strenuous eﬂ?ortto learn who “stole” the material.

The Committee, as other observers have pointed out,
takes the attitude that it is alaw unto itself. For instance,
there has been considerable talk about “front” organiza-
tions, most of it emanating from the Committee. For rea-
sons best known to itself it prefers not to make its collection
of “front” organizations public. The guess in Washington
is that many’ of the “fronts” considered subversive by the
Committee have so many distinguished men‘ and women
of unquestioned patriotism on them that to issue their

31

 

 

names would hold the Committee up to ridicule even by
those who think it is performing a patriotic service.

At any rate, the Committee has an enormously long list
of these “front” organizations. This list, collected by
public funds, is not available to the public but is available
to select individuals and organizations approved by it. At
the Government printing oﬂice there is a neat card among
the list of Government publications. This card states that
the Un—American Committee’s list of “front organiza-
tions” can be obtained only by application to the Com-
mittee. Apparently the Committee or its chairman decides
what individual or organization is entitled to material col-
lected by public funds. Presumably the decision is based
on what individual or organization can use the list in ways
that meet with the Committee’s approval.

The Committee also has a master list of names to which
Government investigators refer when checking possible
subversive connections of individuals. In this master list
I found an astonishing collection of persons named at one

time or another in testimony on subversive activities.‘

Among the names was one Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Another was Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. There are Justices
of the United States Supreme Court, a motley collection
of Governors of sundry states and a whole batch of United
States Congressmen and Senators. I did not ﬁnd a single
American industrialist who supplied Nazi Germany, via
Nazi-controlled German businesses, with secrets we
needed for our own military defense, or who made agree-
ments with Nazi industrialists which curbed our own mili-
tary defense production.

There is much more that can be said about the Un-
American Committee. I mentionthese few items to indi-
cate that its activities are somewhat peculiar, especially in

matters like the timing in the hunt for “subversive radio
commentators”; and in another phase of the “Red men-
ace” propaganda, which I shall come to in a few moments.
With American Action ready with its “alien-mincled
radicals” propaganda, and with pro-Roosevelt policy com-
mentators oi} the air, the Chamber of Commerce began
preparations of the ﬁrst of three brochures on the “menace
of Communism.” These pamphlets were designed for
distribution among business men, industrialists, and the
general public as a major step to create a nation-wide
hysteria around the Red issue, and to help elect an anti-
union Congress. T
The ﬁrst of these pamphlets was called Comnmnist
Inﬁltration in the United States, and handled the subject
on a national scale. For the ‘Chamber of Commerce, with
anti—union industrialists in key directing positions, to take
the lead in starting the Red scare might arouse suspicions,
suspicions that it was creating a smoke~screen for its own
particular objectives. It is obvious that if the Red scare
was started by some one else, and the Chamber came in a
little later with its propaganda, the eﬁect would be cumu-

.lative and not likely to arouse suspicion of ulterior

motives.

6. A MYSTERIOUS “ANDREW
AVERY” APPEARS

AT THIS PERIOD, another of those seemingly independent
occurrences took place, with the person responsible using
extraordinary precautions to conceal his identity and
‘ﬁnancial backers.

The Chicago Journal of Commerce, voice of the in-
dustrial and business interests in the mid-west, suddenly

33

   
 

1

found a_ mysterious “Andrew Avery” who was an authority
on the “menace of Communism” and Communists in the
trade union movement. They found him just in time for
use in the ’4-6 campaign.

Between June 24 and July 11, 1946, the Journal of
Commerce published ‘a series of articles on The Com-
munist F ift/z Column. The articles purported to give
“the results of prolonged observation and extensive re-
search into the activities of the Communists in govern-
ment, labor, and other ﬁelds.” Immediately upon com-
pletion of the series, the articles were published in pam-
phlet form. Large quantities were bought by business men
and industrialists for distribution among their employees.
Other quantities were bought by American Action propa-
gandists, already at work in twenty-four Congressional
districts, for distribution among local business men, veter-
ans organizations, and trade union leaders. The Chamber
of Commerce of the United States advised purchasing the
pamphlets. The “Red menace” was on its way.

Once the “Red menace” issue had been worked success-
fully to elect an anti-union Congress, “Andrew Avery”
produced another series on Communist Power in
Industry to show not merely employers, but union leaders
and members, that Reds were dominating trade unions,
and that their objective was, not to get increased wages,
better working conditions, and job security for the mem-
bers, but just to create. turmoil and confusion so the United
States could be turned over to Russia. It was the old Hitler
“divide and conquer” policy with the same old “save the
country from Communism” cry that the ‘Fuehrer used to
win popular support to establish fascism. A

This series on Communist Power in Industry was run
from January 13, 1947, a few days after the anti-union
34

 

 

, Congress convened-{until the end of the month. It just
happened to be exactly the period when a ﬂood of anti-
union bills was introduced, and was designed to inﬂuence
business men to put pressure on Congress to rush the bills
through. This series, too, was promptly issued as a pamph-
let. The Chamber of Commerce advised readers of its own
“Red menace” pamphlet to buy and read the “Avery”
product. The timing of the “Avery” pamphlet was the
same followed by the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S.

 The first, the disclosure of the “Red menace,” was issued .

 . in time for the. ’4-6 campaign and the second was timed to

 appear immediately after; the anti—union Congress con-

 vened to create the proper atmosphere to pass the ﬂood of
 anti—union bills which culminated in the Taft—I-Iartley bill.

[ii ' “From the Way’ the Chicago Journal of C 0mmerce’s A

pamphlets were Written and timed I suspected that they
were not a staff job and that the real objective Was not to
expose a “Communist menace” but to create a smoke-
screen behind which the anti—union bills could be passed.
In fact, I suspected that there was no such person as
“Andrew Avery” and that it was a ﬁctitious name to con-
ceal the identity of the author and the organization behind
him. ‘I? -

I rented a place in Philadelphia for a couple of months

‘ to serve as a-mailing address and had some letterheads

printed of a non-existent ﬁrm located at the address I
rented. On this stationery I wrote to “Mr. Avery” com-
plimenting him on the job he had done in exposing the
“Red menace” nationally and telling him that We business“

_ men in Philadelphia had a local ‘Communist problem,in

Siv the trade unions. I asked if he could get a leave of absence

from his paper to investigate Communist inﬁltration, in

Philadelphia.‘ Several Business associates and I would
underwrite the project. ’ .

The letter addressed to “Mr. Avery” was opened by
David Dillman, managing editor of the Chicago Journal
"of Commerce. Ht: replied promptly that “Mr. Avery”
was away and that upon his return the matter would be dis-

cussed with him. i V

One thing was immediately obvious: “Mr. Avery’_’ did
not want his identity known. It is not customary fpr
managing editors to open mail addressed to members‘ of

their stall ; mail is held, or forwarded to wherever the staﬁ

 

man happens to be. That “Mr. Avery” had‘ given the
managing editor permission to open his mail meant that he
was anxious to conceal his identity. It also meant that “Mr.
Avery” was an important person or represented an im-
portant organization. Managing editors are busy men, and
even if there were reasons to open “Avery’s” mail, it
would normally be done by the city editor or the news
editor or the ﬁnancial editor or any one of the secondary
editors with whom “Mr. Avery” dealt.

That “Mr. Avery” was away might mean just that, or
it might mean that “Mr. Avery” operated from a city
some distance from Chicago and that “away” was the ex-
cuse given to cover the lapse of time between Dillman’s
writing to him and getting his reply. A little over a week
later my suspicions were conﬁrmed. I received another let-
ter from Dillman. Thistime he enclosed an undated and
unsigned memorandum copied from the one he had re-
ceived from the mysterious “Mr. Avery.” The memoran-
dum contained a very signiﬁcant paragraph. Mr. Dillman
wrote: A .

“I talked to Mr. Avery about your proposed study
of Communism in Philadelphia. It appears that other

things ,tie him up for the present, so that he cannot
give a deﬁnite answer. I think he is interested in your
problem, as you will see from the attached copy of his
memorandum to,mc=.”

My suspicions that “Mr. Avery” was not a Chicagoan
and that the intervening days were consumed by trans-
mission of mail, seemed to be conﬁrmed, for if “Mr.
Avery” had spoken to Dillman it was not necessary for the
formal memorandum,‘ particularly one so Written that it
did not refer to any conversation.

The copy of the “Avery” memorandum said, in part:

“I shall be unable to undertake such a study in the
very near future. This is all I can say at present. I
must ‘wait awhile before I can give a more deﬁnite
answer, which will depend in part on developments
in the labor movement and in Washington, and, less
directly, on the policy-makers in Moscow.”

“Mr. Avery” then, is another in that long list of.

“patriots” who Work hard to “save the country” from the
Reds but who does not want the people he is propagandiz-
ing to know who he is or who is ﬁnancing his activities.
“Mr. Avery,” who is worried to distraction about the Way
“Reds” hide their identities under assumed names, does
not seem to be a slouch. at that sort of thing himself.

Every time I come across a “patriot” who beats his
breast and yells that he wants to save the country but re-
fuses to reveal his identity or who is paying him to do the
saving, I get very suspicious about the motives behind his
activity.

I have gone into these details so the reader will under-
stand how excitement about a “Red menace” is manu-

factured by unidentiﬁed and mysterious persons who are
ﬁnanced in their propaganda by equally unidentiﬁed and
mysterious persons.

7. “SPIES” ALL OVER THE PLACE

Like the mysterious ‘-‘Andrew Avery,” who rushed into
print with his series on Communist Power in Industry
a few days after the anti-union Congress convened,
the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. also rushed into
print with a melodramatic spy—shocker called Communists
Within the Government—The F acts and a Program. It
was illustrated with a lurid picture of the national Capitol
over which was superimposed a red hammer and sickle.

’ The speciﬁc recommendations on what to do with this
“Red menace,” which had penetrated to the very heart of
the Government, took up half the pamphlet and had“ ob-
Viously taken considerable time to prepare and be checked
by attorneys. Now, let us look at the timing:

,_ Material for this shocker had to be collected by investi-
gators. It had to be ‘written, sent to lawyers for approval,
particularly that half dealing with speciﬁc recommenda-
tions. Then it had to go to the Chamber’s oﬂicers and
Board of Directors who are scattered all over the country,
read by these busy men who presumably dropped all their
own work to give it priority, approved by each one (for
the pamphlet was approved by the Board), returned to the
Chamber, sent to the printer, setup, proof read, printed
and ready for distribution early in January, 1947.

I list a few of the processes this pamphlet went through
to show that the Work that went into it could not have been
39

 

  

 

done between the elections in November, 1946, and the
pamphlet’s appearance at the beginning of January, 1947.
This means that the pamphlet was ready and held for re-
lease for the moment when it would create the proper
atmosphere of excitement to exert the maximum inﬂuence
on the Congress. If the Chamber were really worried
about “Reds in Government” it would have issued that
information immediately upon obtaining it. That it de-
layed doing so means that it was more interested in timing
its appearance to create a Red hysteria than it was in warn-
ing the country about alleged Reds employed by the Gov-
ernment. ~

I am not here analyzing or considering the pamphlet’s
patent falsehoods, inaccuracies, and propaganda tricks
similar to the technique used so skillfully by Herr Doktor
Goebbels, who also specialized in “Red menaces.” Charges
are made in this ‘pamphlet—but with no evidence pre-
sented—that Communists, fellow travellers, and fellow
limpers are all over the Government offices and that all of
them are spies or potential spies. The loyalty of several
million Government employees is questioned, but, not to
appear unreasonable, the Chamber of Commerce plays
safe and says that “the overwhelming majority are loyal.”
Naturally, the pamphlet was sensational, as would be any
charges by a presumably responsible organization that
“agents of a foreign government” are all over the Govern-
ment oﬂices.

We now come to another of those seemingly unrelated
occurrences, the timing of which just happened to fall into
the category of nice teamwork. The Un-American Com-
mittee, which had been investigating Communists and
Communism for years, decided to hold hearings to outlaw
the Communist Party as an “agent of a foreign govern-

4-O

 

‘an. 

  .~»~::r~:--'~.,<~ ,; c.   ~ g _

ment.” The timing is interesting. First, the Committee
had some information in- November, 1946, about one Ger-
hardt Eisler, a German Communist and refugee in this
country from the Nazis. Action on him was held in abey-
ance, presumably for further investigation of the allega-
tions made against him.

After the anti-union Congress had been elected with

‘the help of a “save the country from the Reds” campaign,

and convened in January, 1947, the Chamber of Com-
merce of the U.S. issued its melodramatic pamphlet about
“foreign agents” in Government oﬂices. The “Com-
munists-dominate—the—trade—unions” “campaign was kept
in full swing while the anti-union bills were being debated.
At this period, when even the most conservative unions
began to ﬁght for their very existence and denounce the
campaign as a‘ smoke screen‘ to hide its anti-union aim, the
Un-American Committee suddenly came out with sensa-
tional statements that Eisler was the No. 1 Boss of all the
Communists in the United States; that the dissolved Com-
munist International was not really dissolved. The papers
were ﬁlled with headlines that Eisler was an atom bomb
spy who, between bossing all the Communists and being

chief atom bomb spy, also did some odds and ends spying.’ A

And the Un-American Committee, riding- its white
charger to save the country, announced that it would hold
open hearings to outlaw the Communist Party.

The “Red menace,” which had been dying for lack of
evidence, suddenly leaped to life again as a real, dark, and
sinister threat to the country. And running through all of
these horrendousallegations could be found the leading
motif that Reds dominated or controlled unions. The pub-
lic was being sold the idea, by juxtaposition, that unions
were a menace to the country, too.

41

 
 
 

This sort of timing by the Un-American Committee

- arouses suspicions that the Congressional Committee does

its investigating with an eye to teamwork aimed to bolster
the Chamber of Commerce’s long-prepared barrage
against the unions. °

The Committee, and most of the witnesses it heard in
its hearings, knew, as subsequent events proved, that the
Communist Party would not be outlawed. The Com-
munist Party was too good a whipping boy to be put out
of business, for then there would be no one to blame when
the powerful industrialists were ready to start for other ob-
jectives than the weakening and control of the trade
unions. But, the hearings to outlaw the Communist Party,
the atom—bomb spy stories, and the dark charges that Gov-
ernment 0ﬂ‘lCCS had been penetrated by “agents of a for-
eign government,” served to keep the “Red menace” ﬁre
ﬂaming while Congress was deciding how far it dared go
with anti—union laws.

Experienced and conservative trade union leaders real-

ized what was being done and, at the risk of being de-
nounced as “Reds,” warned their members that the “Red '

menace” was a propaganda smoke-screen to hide fascist
designs on the country. A. F. Whitney, president of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, certainly no Com-
munist or fellow traveller, and head of one of the most
conservative unions in the country, warned his member-
ship, “Know Your Enemy,” in the union’s official Journal:

“The anti-Communist sentiment of the American
people is being deliberately inﬂamed by native
American fascists to promote their own evil ends. . . .
If the fascists can keep the people busy discussing
Communism, their opportunity to crush democracy

will be strengthened. We need to turn the guns of
our national =eﬂ’ort and publicity on eliminating

{ American fascism, which is responsible for high
prices, anti-labor legislation, housing shortages, ex-
cessive proﬁts, dwindling purchasing power and witch
hunts.”

But this and similar warnings went unheeded in the

main. The newspapers continued with their sensational i

headlines. The radio news broadcasters continued with
their sensational announcements of the headlines, since
most pro-labor commentators had been removed from the

truck full of gasoline on the already furiously blazing -

ﬂames.

8. THE PRESIDENTS LOYALTY
ORDER

P IN ITS SECOND BROCHURE, Communists Within the Gov?

ernment, the anti—union industrialists running the Cham-

ber of Commerce of the U.S. presented detailed recom- R

mendationspon what it wanted done to get Communists
and fellow travellers out of Government employ.
While the “menace of Communism” propaganda was

3 gaining momentum, the President wrote to ex-Governor

George H. Earle, of Pennsylvania, who gets apoplectic
even‘ at the mention of Communists. In his letter the
President referred to the Red scare as a “bug—a—boo.”
Apparently the President himself was not falling for it.
Disclosure of this letter was made by Carroll Reece, na-
tional chairman of the Republican Party.

an

iNevertheless, one month after writing this letter, the
President issued an extraordinary Loyalty Order which
hit the front pages of the country’s newspapers and added
immeasurably to the anti-Red hysteria sweeping the coun-
try. In this order there are some startling similarities to
the Chamber of Commerce’s ideas on how to handle the

“Red menace” among Government workers.

A side by side comparison between what the Chamber
of Commerce wanted done and what the President of the
United States ordered done is interesting:

mation furnished by

Approximately one year before the President issued
his Order the heads of various departments of the Execu-
tive branch of the Government outlined the routine pro-
cedures their departments followed to check the loyalty
of their employees. This customary and routine procedure
covered practically what the President ordered.

{The Navy has an excellent intelligence service of its
ovvn. The loyalty of all applicants for work in the Navy
Department is investigated. James Forrestal, Secretary of
the Navy, explains their procedure:

“It has been my understanding that the ﬁles of
9‘ the Committee on Un-American Activities in the
. _ . House of Representatives represent a compilation of
x ‘- recorded information and as such have been regarded -
by accredited investigative agencies of the several
Executive Departments as a reference source for indi-
viduals or organizations with a possible known sub-
versive connection.

“In order to cover all possible sources of informa-
tion and in certain cases wherein it appeared likely
that the. Committee might -be in possession of per-
tinent information, the Office of Naval Intelligence
has checked the Committee ﬁles for possible data of
record. Any and all such requests to the Committee
by Naval representatives have in turn been predicated
upon speciﬁc requests to the Naval Intelligence Serv-
ice for official investigations. Any data obtained from I
the Committee records has been used as a basis for
developing logical investigation in the cases con-
cerned. It has merely constituted a source of informa-
tion to assist in effecting as complete coverage of a
case as possible and has in no Way been in lieu of, or
lessening the scope of investigative eﬁorts necessary
on the part of the Navy Department investigating
representatives. I

“The foregoing procedure has been one of long
standing, and, as I have explained, has been con-
cerned with a mere ﬁle check as routine source of in-
formation... . .”

Harry B. Mitchell, president of the Civil Service Com-

“I wish to add that our investigative practices call
for the search of other records [than those contained
in the ﬁles of the Un—American Activities Commit:

Intelligence, as appropriate, are searched when the
person under investigation has had military or naval
service or is an applicant for employment in the War

investigations of persons on whom MIS or the ONI
had previously informed us that its ﬁles contained
leads of unfavorable information.

“We utilize whatever records are available and
pertinent to the particular issues we must resolve in a

Robert Patterson, Secretary of War, explains the War
Department’s loyalty check:

“The _War Department makes numerous routine
inquiries to determine the ﬁtness and qualiﬁcations of
persons seeking specialized employment. One of the
best sources of information is in the records of Fed-
eral, State, and local government agencies. Any or

cluding our own, and is used in making a determina-

‘ tion of the qualiﬁcations of the person being investié

Dean Acheson, former Under Secretary" of State, ex-
plains his Department’s procedure:-

“Examination of this Committee’s [Un—Ameri-
can] records, as Well as ofdata available from other
governmental sources, is routine procedure in con-
nection With the department’s policy of scrutinizing
all available information Which may be pertinent and
material to the matter of the character, ﬁtness, loy-
alty and other qualiﬁcations of individuals seeking
employment with the State Department.

“The Department’s investigation of applicants for
employment is carried on in the strictest conﬁdence
with appropriate safeguards to the character and rep-
utation of the individual under investigation. When
the complete data of an applicant is gathered by the
Division of Investigations, the material is screened,
correlated and carefully evaluated by the proper offi-
cers of the department before a recommendation is
made by the Division of Departmental Personnel to
the Assistant Secretary for Administration with re-
spect to the employment of a given individual. The
assessment of a man’s ﬁtness for employment by the
department is a decision which the department makes
for itself, acting through its own officers and upon its
own ﬁndings, That decision is not made in consulta-
tion with any Committee of Congress or in reliance
upon the work of such Committee’s staff.”

‘ 51

  

Thus, we find that every Department of the Executive
Branch of the Government has for years pursued a rou-
tine procedure of investigating the loyalty of its em-
ployees in which they utilize every available source of in-
formation.

The question naturally arises: why did the President is-
sue his extraordinary order, especially since a month
earlier he had made light of the “Red menace” as a “bug-
a-boo.” "

We can, of course, only surmise his motives.

Republican Party leaders had made the “Red men-
ace” an issue in ’46, and it had met with a measure of
success. It had helped defeat a number of pro-Roosevelt
policy Congressmen and the Democratic Party lost control
of Congress. ‘-’

With the country semi-hysterical from propaganda
about Reds in Government, Reds in trade unions, Reds
in Hollywood, Red spies, atom bomb spies, and so on, a
Democratic President who poo-poohed such a collection
of menaces might even be tagged a “fellow-traveller” if
he did not do something about “saving the country.” The
Democratic Party might even lose the Presidency on the
same issue in ’48 if the President did not take the play
away from the Republicans. It might be “good politics”
to take the oﬁensive away from the Republicans. If the
Republicans saw a Red lurking behind every street cor-
ner light, then the Democrats would see two.

Another aspect of the order which would meet with the
approval of anti-Roosevelt Democrats, as well as Republi-
can Party leaders, was the likelihood that .it would curb
the type of investigations conducted during the Roosevelt
administrations, which made public sensational and shock-
ing facts about the way key corporations in this country
52 '

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   

controlled the lives of the American people. The investi-

gations were made by both the House and the Senate and

included a study of the use of labor spies to keep workers
from organizing; of tie-ups between American business
men and Nazi businessmen to the detriment of American
security; of the control of the United States and its 140,-
000,000 people by eight major ﬁnancial groups. Such of-
ﬁcial investigations made public information which the

country’s key industrialists wanted kept buried-. in their tr

private ﬁles and not made available to the people.

Most of those who worked on these investigations are
still in the Government employ. They know the ins and
outs of business control over the country; they know the
interlocking directorates of the Chamber of Commerce
and the National Association of Manufacturers; how the
lobbyists employed by these organizations work; they
know the identities of the American industrialists who
made agreements with the Nazis which put us at a dis-
advantage when the war broke out. Such employees know
too much; and Government employees who dug up such
material obviously must be regarded as enemies of “free
enterprise.” And anyone who is an enemy of free ‘enter-
prise is just as obviously not a good American, since free
enterprise is the “American way”; and if he is not a good
American-then he is a Communist. Obviously! That’s
why the Government offices are so full of Communists.
The industrialists running the Chamber of Commerce and
N.A.M. would feel considerably better if such employees
were not on Government payrolls.

The third surmise involves the international scene which
inﬂuenced, to a considerable extent, the anti—Red cam-
paign. Because it would lead off into a complex ﬁeld, I
touch on it only brieﬂy in relation to the Loyalty Order.

53

 

For reasons of American policy—-space prohibits analyz-
ing the factors behind it-—-the United States decided to give
ﬁnancial and military aid to Greece and Turkey as part
of its “Stop Communism” drive. Even the Republican
Congress was a little stunned when the President requested
such aid for -Turkey which had been pro——Naz_i all during
the war, and Whose leading business men had made huge
fortunes supplying Nazis with material which helped kill
and maim American soldiers. P

Some sections of Congress,lin the face of public resent-
ment, balked. It could‘ gloss over the fact that Greece
had an anti—democratic regime, kept in power by British
military forces, but at least Greece had fought the Nazis.
Some biting comments were made that the real reason the
President Wanted to give aid to Greece and Turkey was
not to “stop Communism” but to bolster American banking

 

and industrial efforts to control the Near East oil ﬁelds.‘

Some Congressmen and Senators asked bluntly why, if
Great Britain could aiford to keep 100,000 soldiers in Pal-
estine, it suddenly discovered that it could not afford to
keep 10,000 in Greece Without going bankrupt.

Faced with this rising tide of resistance, and the wide-'

spread suspicion regarding the Wisdom and motives of the
“stop Communism” drive which was endangering his pro-
posal, the President suddenly issued his Loyalty Order.
The eﬁect of a Presidential‘ order of" this nature gave the
American people the feeling that the danger from the Reds
was very acute and very real. And all this, a month after
the President himself had ridiculed the hysteria by assert-
ing it Was a “bug—a-boo!” P ‘

I have not mentioned, in considering the similarities be-
tween What the Chamber of Commerce Wanted and what
the President ordered, those aspects of the order which

54 T

A practically wiped out some of our fundamental principles T

of law and justice, in defense of which we had just ﬁn-
ished along and bitter war. Even conservative newspapers
which cannot be suspectediof harboring even red ink in
their composing rooms voiced pained surprise.‘ Perhaps
the best picture of what the President’s order does to the
fundamental guarantees of law by which We live was
given by A. L. Pomerantz, American Deputy Chief Coun-
sel at Nuremberg. Upon his return to the United‘States
after helping prosecute Nazis, Pomerantz read the Presi-
dent’s Loyalty, Order and, in a long and indignant letter to
the New York Times. (published May 4, 1947), gave his

' analysis and reaction. He wrote, in part:

 

“Having recently returned from Nuremberg, I am
struck by certain ironical contrasts between our Gov-
ernment’s prosecution ‘of, Nazi criminal organizations
at Nuremberg and our parallel ‘-proceedings here
against so-called disloyal American organizations. It
would seem that We are providing American iustice
for Nazis, but Nazi justice for Americans.

“Upon returning to the United States I found that
Whatever we may have taught the Nazis, we have ab-
sorbed into our own legal system the German tyranny
that we fought and inveighed against. I refer to our
Executive Order which provides that anyone of the
two and one half million employees in the Executive
Branch of our Federal Government can be summarily
ﬁred if heis, or ever Was, a member of, or in ‘sympa-
thetic association’ With, any organization or combina-
tion of persons placed by the Attorney General of the
United States on his private blacklist.

“The condemned organization receives no indict-
ment or even intimation that its loyalty is impugned.
' 55

 

 

It gets no hearing or opportunity to contest the charge.
The Attorney General merely says: ‘Thou art con-~
demned.’ Thereupon, its members, past, present and
future, are automatically judged guilty of the hein-
ous offense of disloyalty to their Government. The
American citizen, unlike his German counterpart, is
aﬂ’orded no opportunity to challenge the Attorney-‘
General’s ex—parte condemnation of his organization.
\“This conviction without trial, borrowed from the.
darkest days of the Nazi inquisition, is a startling in-
novation in American judicial procedure. Its gravity
is accentuated by the fact‘ that the member, of the con-
demned organization is subject to an extraordinarily
severe penalty. N ominally he is discharged from
Federal employment. This is bad enough. But the
practical effect is an economic death sentence. For
one can imagine how remote are the chances of a per-
son discharged for disloyalty to his Government,
finding other employment. . . .
“On this charge of personal disloyalty, the Gov-
ernment employee gets a trial—a mockery of a trial.
‘V The charge, says our Executive Order, shall be only
as speciﬁc as, ‘in the discretion of the employing de-
partment or agency, security considerations permit.’
And this is further hedged by the rule that the inves-
tigative agency may refuse to disclose the names of
‘conﬁdential informants.’ ‘
“Yes, you get a trial on an indictment that doesn’t
inform you of the charges, and with no opportunity
to confront or examine, or even to know of, the com-
. plaining Witnesses. And the burden of disproving the
undisclosed charges rests on the defendant. It should
be added——shades of the malodorous German Peo-
ples’ Courts! —-—that the tribunal which hears these ,
cases is appointed by and responsible to the depart-
ment head, Who may be the complainant.
56

“This is twentieth century American justice.

“. . . in the first place, we proudly boast that ours

' is a Government of laws, not of men. It is our laws
which furnish the prophylaxis against the possibility p
of abuse from evil or stupid men. . . . In these days
when the issues are getting sharper and hotter, when
dissent from Governmen policy brings down on the
head of the dissenter pathological fury, even threats
of jail, it is dangerous to have to depend on those
who have the power to use it temperately.

“In my judgment, the Executive Order is, both
substantively and procedurely, the most Nazi-like
and terrifying law since the Alien and Sedition Acts.
It should be repealed in toto. There are enough laws
already on our books to protect us against treason,
sabotage and real disloyalty.”

9. THE CHAMBER’S PAMPHLETS

THE THREE BROCHURES on the “Red menace” issued by
the Chamber of Commerce have, at this writing, reached
a circulation of over one million copies.

The ﬁrstvpamphlet was issued in October, 1946, in time
for immediate use in that year’s Congressional campaign.
It supplied propaganda for use by the mysteriously ﬁn-I
anced American Action. This, coupled with the “Rec?
menace” pamphlet issued by the Chicago Journal of‘
Commerce and published under the name of an individ-~
ual who conceals his identity and who is ﬁnancing his ac—-
tivities, served as the spearhead to create a national hys-
teria about “Red inﬁltration” While the real immediate
objective of stringent anti—union laws was being put over.

With the ground Work done and an anti-union Con-
gress elected, the Chamber issued its second pamphlet

Comm«um':ts3 Within the Government, which indicates
from internal’ evidence that it had been prepared long in
advance and held for release at the most opportune mo-
ment to excite the country about spies, secret agents and
just plain “disloyal” Americans in order to distract the
people’s attention While anti-union bills were being pushed
through. . '

The" third pamphlet on Communists Within the Labor

tMo‘vement Was the pay-oﬂ’ in the series. It raised the

“menace of Communism” in trade unions in time to inﬂu-
ence passage of the anti—union Taft-Hartley bill and also
presented detailed advice to the employers on how to break
the unions with which they had contracts, by using the ap-
proach of “ﬁghting Communists in the union.”

Without going into a detailed analysis of these pam-
phlets to point out provable falsehoods, unsubstantiated
assertions presented as facts, the use of innuendo, juxta-
position and a host of other tricks ‘of the propagandist
used so successfully by Herr Doktor Goebbels, I shall il-
lustrate brieﬂy the technique used: , '

In the very preface of the brochure on labor, the Cham-
ber states:

“Furthermore, management alone cannot solve the
problem, The cooperation of anti—Communist Work-
’ men and labor leaders is indispensable.”

The business man gets the idea. Among his employees,
as in most unions, is a group in opposition to those elected
to oﬂice. The opposition makes charges that those elected
to oﬂice are Communists or Communist-dominated. The
employer cooperates with theopposition and eifectively
splitsthe union into Warring factions. Again, it is the old

i 58

 

 

 

Hitler‘ technique of “divide and conquer.” Advice along
such lines is found all through the pamphlet.

The brochure explains how a Communist-controlled
union can be spotted. Communists, says the Chamber,
make excessive demands on the employer. If a trade union
leader, when living costs jump thirty per cent, demands,
on behalf of his membership, a thirty per cent wage in-
crease to meet the increased living costs, then he’s a Red.
There can. be no mistake about that. 

The Chamber does not hesitate to go to absurd lengths
in its “Red menace” propaganda. Communists, the pam-
phlet Warns, will use any kind of trick to get control of
a union, the opposition or the employer, even to the ex-
tent of:

“Communist women are prepared to seduce any
opponent who is weak enough to fall for their Wiles.
Then blackmail effectively silences opposition from
this quarter.” ‘
The Chamber, after going into great details on how

Machiavellian the Reds are, and having scared the em-
ployer, Who by now probably thinks his private secretary

is is secretly a Red agent on a choice assignment, suggests

that he hire a specialist to help him cope with the Red
problem: C

“At the beginning, at least, it may be desirable to
call in outside consultants who are expert in han-
dling Communism in the labor movement. Unfor-
tunately thus far, none of the national services which V
are offered to industrial relations directors has con-
centrated upon this problem. Undoubtedly some in-
dividual industrial relations consultants are familiar
with it. But the issue has been recognized too recently
to permit the building up of specialized competent
services in relation to it.” ‘

59

 

 

The Chamber’s brochures were issued by its Committee" ‘
on Socialism and Communism, with the approval of the
Board of Directors. "For the years 1946-47 when the
pamphlets were issued, this Committeeconsisted of ﬁve
men. The chairman was Francis P. Matthews, chairman ‘
of the Securities Acceptance Corporation of Omaha,.N_eb. -
Emerson P. Schmidt, Director of Economic Research for‘.
the Chamber, is the Committee’s secretary.

_ Usually the actual propaganda work is done by hired
employees and the Committee is just a collection of A -,
‘ “front” names to show “democratic procedure.” Since
Schmidt’s name was on the Committee as the Chamber’s
Director of Economic‘ Research, I assumed he was in -..A
charge of the Chamber’s “save the country from the Reds”
drive, an assumption that turned out to be correct. .

Upon making a few inquiries I learned that Schmidt 4»
is an eX—professor of economics who was born in Canada I
and came to the United States in 1919f

Ex—Professor' Schmidt is apparently a restless and am- » ~
bitious soul. Just what jobs he held in his first years _ ’
in this country I do not know, perhaps he was just stud_V— _ I «
in_g.- But, ﬁve years after he came to the United States
and while still an. alien, he became an assistant professor
of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wis.
He held this job from 1924- to 19.26. .Either the Univer-
sity did not want him after that or he was looking around
for something better, for from 1926 to 1928 he was at the:
University of Wisconsin where he got a job as a mere
instructor in economics. He lasted two years there, too.
Then he trekked out west, for from 1928 to 1930 we ﬁnd.
him (still an alien) a full professor of economics at_ the
University of Oregon.

Now, a man who holds a full professorship in a nation-

60

 

 

ally known and respected university, has tenure. He is set
for life in his chosen ﬁeld of scholarship and teaching.
Only an extraordinary situation or an offer from a univer-
sity of greater prestige ordinarily causes him to leave.
Prof. Schmidt after two years left. This time he went to
the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor of
economics—-—a step down in position.

So far as‘ Prof. Schmidt’s jobs were concerned, the la-
bor turnover was pretty high.

After he became an American citizen his teaching career’
seems to have come to an end. He was hired by the Prov-
ince of Alberta for a while and then returned to the United
States to take a job as economic consultant and editor of
the American Legion Employment Stabilization_.Service.
He held this job from 1939 to 1.94-2. He went to the
Chamber on January 1, 1943. ' L

Prof. Schmidt’s perambulations are of no importance
except that they show that a life devoted to scholarship
was apparently not to his liking, or, perhaps his economics
and logic Were not to the liking of the universities where
he taught. I shall touch on his scholarly logic shortly.

.With the mysterious “Mr. Aveiiy” in mind and the
Chamber’s advice to consult specialists in Reds, I Won-
dered just What advice the Chamber Would give an em-
ployer Who did not know where to ﬁnd such specialists.
The advice had all the earmarks of the sort employers used

to get when they were told to go to a detective agency
'. Which would supply labor spies to Work in a plant, ﬁnd

out who joined the union, report their names and have
them fired, or, if there were too many already in the
union, join the ranks and create disse__nsion from Within so
the organized workers could not present a solid front.
Laborspying was made illegal under Roosevelt and the in-

dustrialists had lost an ace in the hole for preventing their
employees from organizing. '

The advice published by the Chamber sounded like
a resurgence of the old labor spying business, only this
time it was disguised as a search for Reds. So far as the
employer was concerned the eﬁcect would be the same.

On the stationery of the ﬁctitious business ﬁrm I had
used to write to “Mr. Avery,” I wrote to the chairman of
the Chamber’s Committee on Socialism and Communism
since it specialized in Reds. I informed Mr. Matthews
that in Philadelphia, where my business was supposed to
be, we had a local Communist problem in the trade unions.
Since I did not know Where specialists in Reds could be
found, and since he and his Committee had advised busi-
ness men to get them, I asked him to put me in touch with
some. Several business associates of mine and I would
underwrite the cost of the investigation and publish the
results. I

Apparently Mr. Matthews, though chairman of the
Chamber’s Committee specializing in exposing Reds, is
not familiar with the details. Those are handled by the
perambulating ex—professor of economics, for Mr. Mat-
thews immediately sent my letter to him. I quote from
Mr. Matthews’ letter to me:

“I would suggest that you write to Dr. Emerson» P.

Commerce of the United States, Washington 6,

thews, with a copy of my letter, did not wait to hear from .
me. He wrote immediately and his letter was startling.
I quote it in full:

“I have a letter from Mr. Francis P. Matthews 1
‘ enclosing a copy of your letter of March 24th to him.
We are very much interested in the plan which you
are considering.‘

“I would suggest that you write to Father John F.
Cronin, National Catholic Welfare Conference, 1312
Massachusetts Ave., N. W., Washington, D. C., or
if you wish I could talk to him about it. He has a
long experience in research of this type and knows a ' ‘
great many people who have high competence to do
this kind of job. “‘

“I do not happen to be a Roman Catholic myself 
and do not know what your interest in religion may 3!
be. I mention this only to tell you that the mere fact
that Dr. Cronin is attached to a Catholic church
should not make any difference either pro or con in
your contacting him. In other Words, he is a highly pl
trained economist who understands research and will
do the kind of job or will pick the kind of people
who will do the kind of job which confronts you.”

I read this over several times in amazement. I had asked
the Chamber of Commerce to put me in touch with people Q,
Who would investigate alleged Reds in trade unions-— I‘
specialists, as the Chamber called this type of labor spy
and I was referred to a Catholic priest with assurances
that he would do the kind of job I wanted done. There was
no misunderstanding the letter: a member of the Catholic
hierarchy would engage in or direct the Work of spying
on trade unions said to have Communists in them.
I That some members of the Catholic hierarchy are ene-
1' 65

~.  ii ‘ -  V.  ..  . , 

‘mics of Communism is Widely known. But that a member

of -the hierarchy is. so close to the anti-union Chamber of
Commerce that it recommended him as an aide while the
Chamber is engaged in an all—out drive against organized
workers is diﬁicult for Catholics who are good union mem-
bers to understand. C

Perhaps the most shocking part of this letter is the simi-
larity to what happened under Hitler. In Germany, too,
ruthless industrialists, bent on destroying the trade unions,
used members of the Catholic hierarchy under the 
of “ﬁghting Bolshevism.” What happened to Catholics
in Germany is now history. They, too, suﬁered greatly
under fascism. ‘ V

Trade unions do not ask their members if they are
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, or Mohammedans. Workers
of all faiths. join together in a union to get Wages to enable
them toimaintain a decent standard of living. Efforts to
break the unions by raising issues which create internal
dissension play the employer’s game, and this sort of tactic
is resented by Catholics who are union members as well as
by those of other ,faiths. There are many good, loyal
Catholics Who are members and leaders of trade unions.

10. THE REAL OBJECTIVE?

THAT THE CHAMBER is not primarily opposed to Reds but
to any union which demands decent Wages, good working
conditions, and job security is evident from a’study on I n-
dustrial Relzm'om——Frustrated and Perverted, Which Prof.
Schmidt authored. The "Chamber will be happy to-give
you a free copy. Wrote the professor:

“Strikes, internecine labor squabbles, absentee-
ism, high labor turnover, reduced "labor eﬁort, re-

66

 

 

 

 

strictionism and feather bedding, pay for doing noth-
ing, boycotts, failure to enforce local laws against
mass picketing and violence, demands for 50 to 100
, per cent wage increases, deﬁance of the United States
government—all these may be the symptoms of an
almost lethal disease. In small volumes these symp-
toms may be present in any society; when they become
general the patient may die, unless the trend is re-
versed.” A
“Among the disturbing elements,” he continues, “is
Communist inﬂuence in the World of ideas and in the la-
bor movement.” He notes regretfully that:

“By Widespread and ' irresponsible labelling of
every reform and New Deal measure with the epithet
‘Communist’ the American people have become dan-
gerously immune to the fear of Communist inﬁltra-
tion.”

It is an old propaganda technique to denounce a tactic
as unwise or unfair when people begin to suspect it, and
having disarmed the reader by this evidence of fair-
mindedness, to proceed to use the same technique. The
professor does this Well:

“The National Labor Relations Board had its poli-
cies greatly inﬂuenced if not dictated, for a time, by
Communists and their sympathizers on their payroll.
During this period the employers were gagged and
fenced in. Communist inﬂuence in the Department of
Labor is on the increase. The Communists in the
U. S. Treasury engineered the plot to deliver Ger-
many to the U.S.S.R. by exceedingly devious tactics
and were in the process of having their goals realized
when suddenly Secretary Byrnes, in Sept. 1946, cried
out for a uniﬁed Germany to save the Germans for
freedom, if not for free enterprise.”

1. STRANGE SIMILARITIES

WITHIN TWO MONTHS AFTER the Nazis surrendered, a
series of events occurred in this country similar to those
Which happened in Germany before Hitler established a
fascist dictatorship. The timing of these seemingly inde-
pendent occurrences points to a carefully conceived and
executed plot, of which the visible ﬁrst step is the Weaken-
ing and control of American trade unions.

The strategy and tactics pursued are those used by Hit— 7

ler and Goebbels; and the ﬁnancing and directing moves
are made by powerful industrial interests, some of which
Were affiliated with Nazi industrial interests which orig-
inally helped Hitler to power.

The similarities between What Hitler did in Germany
to achieve complete domination and What has been done

here since the end of the war are many. For the purpose

of this pamphlet I shall consider only afew in the current
anti-union drive against 15,000,000 organized workers

Who, with their families, comprise more than one-third

of the entire population of the United States.

1. In the three years» preceding Hitler’s advent to
power Germany was faced with the problem of a grow-
ing army of unemployed which German industrialists and
business men were unable to solve. In the United States,
our own industrialists and business men are frankly ex-
pressing the fear that the huge unemployment problem

' To engineer a plot to turn a whole country over to an-
other country takes pretty good engineering. That a hand-
ful-——or even a truckful—-—of minor executives and ordin-
ary oﬁice clerks in one branch of our many—branched Gov-

ernment could engineer that goes to show what the Reds,

can do. That there is a Cabinet member who is Secretary
of the Treasury, that there is a Cabinet member who is
Secretary of State,‘that there is a Congress and a Presi-
dent, and that none of them would realize that a small
clique is engineering the turning over of one country to
another country—implies either such incompetence on the
part of our leading ofﬁcials that they should not be per-
mitted to hold the oﬂice of dog catcher, or else it implies
that the ex—professor directing the Chamber’s Economic
Research is not too greatly troubled by logic or such inci-
dentals as proof or evidence. .

The propaganda technique employed by the professor
is interesting. Since most employers, faced with a union

i disagreement up before the N .L.R.B., were convinced, if

the decision favored the union, that it was unfair, it was
not diﬂicult to persuade them that the “unfairness” was due
to a plot——a Communist plot, naturally. Reds Trojan-
horsed their way into the N .L.R.B., and were giving the
unions anything they Wanted—all as part of a plot not only
to turn Germany over to Russia but the United States, too.
Why the Treasury Department was brought in by the pro-
fessor, I do not know. It seems to me that the N.L.R.B.
could have handled the triﬂing chore of turning the United
States over to Russia without the Treasury’s help.

Perhaps the reader thinks I am facetious when I add
the United States to Germany as among the countries to be
turned over to Russia, so let me quote the professor to
avoid any misunderstanding. He Wrote: .

68

 

 

 

“The American Communists haveihs their ultimate
aim the delivery of the United States into the hands
of'the U.S.S.R. . . .” '

Such triﬂing matters as proof, evidence or even sense
in this bald statement do not deter the Director of Eco-
nomic Research when he wants to get across his propa-
ganda. The only thing omitted in this inside tip is Whether
the United States will be wrapped in cellophane when
the delivery is made.

Prof. Schmidt is just full of inside dope:

“. . . their [Communist, fellow-travellers and pre-
sumably all their relatives] immediate aim is the
weakening of our economic machine to enable the
U.S.S.R. to gain its ends in Europe and Asia.”

We are now making some real progress. The Reds are
now going to turn over not just Germany and the United
States, but all Europe and Asia, to the Russians. Why
the South Pole is left out, I do not know. I do know that
there are a lot of capitalist-looking penguins down there.

The professor, however, has an objective in all this in-
side stuff propaganda. This objective is found in the
phrase “weaken our economic machine.” The only way an
economic machine can be weakened is when production
ceases—that is, when workers go on strike or an employer
closes his plant because he does not want to grant his
workers’ demands or because he has overproduced and
is waiting for the market to absorb his product. When a
worker goes on strike for a living wage he is “weakening
the economic machine.” When an employer raises prices
to maintain or increase his level of proﬁts, that is free
enterprise. When workers weaken the economic machine;
by going on strike they ar6e9 not doing it for increased

an

 

J

wages to meet incneased living costs, but only because it is
part of a Red plot to turn Europe and Asia over to the
Reds! 

Space prohibits presenting further examples of the pro-
fessor’s inside tips and brilliant logic, but one choice bit of
economic research should not be omitted. It has nothing to
do with the Reds. It deals with union workers. Wrote the
distinguished professor and economist:

“Today, when the general price level is only mod-
erately above that ﬁgure [1926 price levels] While_
basic Wage raises have nearly doubled since then, the
labor leader still argues that the cost of living is over-

taking Wage rates! Can labor leaders ever be satis- ~
ﬂed?” ‘

I think this paragraph gives the reader a pretty good
idea of the quality of the professor’s economic research.

,The drive against the trade unions in Germany was a
vital aspect'of Hitler’s drive for a fascist dictatorship.
That-drive against the unions was given impetus by the ur-
gent problem of Germany’s millions of unemployed. In
this country, many of our own industrialists are now fear-
ful of a serious unemployment problem as a consequence of

, the fast—dWindling purchasing power of the people in the

face of high prices. _ .
The reappearance on the American scene of millions

of men and women Walking the streets hunting jobs would i

present a grave problem for the Government. In the
professor’s opinion: '
“Whether a, free society can shoulder upon gov-
ernment responsibility for sustained full employment

and yet remain a free society certainly remains to be
demonstrated.”

“How, then, can a large unemployment problem be
solved? The spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce
‘pointed out as far back as 194-5 :

“A dictatorship—fascist, socialist or Communist
,—controlling prices, Wages and workers, can secure
and maintain full employment so long as its power
endures.”

This, then, seems to be the pay-oﬁ. A sick economy will
die unless the trend is changed. It is certain that the Cham-
ber does not want a Socialist or Communist “totalitarian-
ism” to handle a large unemployment problem. The only
other Way in which it can be handled, according to the
Director of Economic Research for the Chamber, is by a
fascist dictatorship.

This was the approach made by Hitler. He solved Ger-
many’s unemployment problem by putting the people to
Work. There is no question about that. He put them to
work manufacturing arms and munitions for War and,
when they had mainufactured enough, he led millions of
them to their graves.

This, then, seems to be the ultimate objective of those
powerful American industrialists directing the Chamber
of Commerce and the National Association of Manufac-
turers. It casts light on Why a nationwide hysteria about
a “Red menace” is created simultaneously by seemingly
independent bodies; or Why an organization which keeps
its ﬁnancial backers secret takes part in a political cam-
paign to elect an anti-union Congress; or Why “patriotic”
individuals, who conceal their identities and who is ﬁnanc-
ing them, issue anti-union propaganda under the guise
of a Red hunt. It casts light on a Congressional Commit-
tee, which has made a mockery of some of our funda-

The rest of the world would have been spared the fright-
ful Nazi blood—letting, the wrenching of lives, the torn

our own American boys there would not now be little
white crosses as mute evidence that they are lost to us for-
ever. The American people are slow to anger, but when
their anger is justly aroused, they are a mighty and over-
whelming force. _

The ﬁrst movein the steps Hitler took to establish fas-
cism in Germany—-weakening and control of the trade
unions, which the industrialists themselves could not con-
trol directly——has already been taken in this country fol-

during the depression years, which was not solved until we
began to manufacture for defense and war, will be with us
again in the Widely expected postwar depression.

2. German industrialists could not control the German
trade unions which were among the largest in Europe,
and leading industrialists gave Hitler ﬁnancial support
with the agreement that upon establishing fascism he
would control the unions. American industrialists, also un-
able to dominate our trade unions, ﬁnancially backed an
intensive campaign in 1946 to elect a Congress which
promptly passed the Taft—Hartley bill to Weaken and con-
trol American unions.

3. Unable to break the trade unions because of Ger-
many’s then democratic government, leading industrialists
favored establishing a fascist dictatorship. In the United
States, H. W. Prentiss, president of the Armstrong Cork
Co., and an inﬂuential member of the Chamber of Com-
merce of the United States, informed a three—state regional
meeting of the Chamber, as far back as 1938, thatit might
be necessary to establish a secret fascist dictatorship here.

4-. One of the Ways by which Hitler got the German
people to give him dictatorial powers was to promise that
he would ﬁnd Work for all unemployed. In the United.
States, Emerson P. Schmidt, director of Economic Re-

» search for the Chamber of Commerce, is spreading propa-
A gand_a that under a dictatorship unemployment problems

are solved.

5. As soon as Hitlenachieved power, a subservient
Reichstag passed laws giving him control over the trade
unions. In the United States, as soon as the anti—union
80th Congress, elected with the ﬁnancial and propaganda
aid of leading industrialists, convened, bills were intro—
duced to Weaken and shackle union labor.

6. One of ’Hitler’s ﬁrst acts on“ assuming power was to.
get control of the radio to prevent pro—democratic news
broadcasters from warning the people of what the Nazis
were doing. «In the United States,*before the intensive

anti—union campaign was launched, liberal radio commen-V

tators, were forcedioff the air.

7. One of Hitler’s earliest appeals for public support A
was toveterans of World War I, many of whom were also . »

tradeunion members, on the pleacthathe wanted toisave

Germany from the “menace of Bolshevism.” The vet—

erans and trade unionists were not told that industrialists

were secretly backing the Fuehrer. In the United States,

immediately after the war ended, American Action was or—
ganized as a political movement to appeal to veterans of
both world wars‘“regardless of “party” to back -its choice
of candidates to save the country from “alien—minded radi~t
cals”——meaning Communists. Veterans and trade union-

. ists did not know that Capt. Edward A. Hayes, past Na—.
. tional Commander of the American Legion, who headed-

American Action, was not making public the names of the

, anti—union industrialists ﬁnancing this ‘movement. ’ I

8. Meetings between Hitler and key German indus—‘"

trialists backing him were kept ‘secret. In the United I

States, before Capt. Hayes took over direction of Ameri—
can Action, he heldmeetings with “top—ﬂ'ight” anti—union

i politicians of both major parties to get their support. Vet— _

erans and trade unionists to whom‘-American Action ap-
pealed for patriotic support were not told ofthese meet—
ings.

9. Hitler stated‘ frankly that one of his best propa~ ‘
ganda tactics was use of “the big lie.” By repeating it:

often enough he could get the people to believe it. In the
United States a mysterious individual calling himself
