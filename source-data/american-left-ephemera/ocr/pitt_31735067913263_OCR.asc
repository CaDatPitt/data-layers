May. 1955  of

Senate Subcommittee Okays
Federal Mine Safety Measure

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Mine-Mill and other labor pressure to delete the state- -- ,
option feature of the House-passed federal mine safety bill is being focused now on the  S’ I
membership of the full Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, following the
favorable reporting of that bill, with several minor amendments, by the Labor Sub-
committee on April 21. Although the subcommittee action was unanimous, a few of

its members have indicated that they are not sold on Section 13 of the measure, which i i 

would allow states to administer safety programs approved by the Department of the

Interior.

The full committee, which is scheduled to meet during the week of May 8, may
take up the mine safety bill at that time. s
One amendment to the House-passe

d measure, proposed by Sen. Jacob‘ Javits

(R-N.Y.) and accepted by the subcommittee, calls for the enforcement provisions to

become effective one year after
the publication of federal stand-
ards. This is an improvement
over the bill as passed by the
House of Representatives, which
would allow time for each state
legislature to meet in regular
session prior to having the fed-
eral standards take effect.

Javits, too, proposed several
minor amendments —— some of
which were accepted-to Sec-
tion 13 of the bi1l—that section
that labor would like to see re-
moved entirely.

The subcommittee also added
to the bill provisions for a Board
of Review, such as exists in the
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act.
The board in the coal industry
has not served to delay enforce-
ment of the safety standards.

The industry publication,‘ En-
gineering and Mining Journal,
which in its April issue noted
that Mine-Mill is “leading a
combined union thrust to tighten
up Federal safety legislation for
the non-ferrous metals industry

Albuquerque Walkout in March Mﬂwaukee '-°¢°' “'95 

S   ° ° 0 T ocvement
een As Beginning 1‘ M

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—The March 28 walkout by some 50 Mexican-American
delegates, including Mine-Mill Board Member Maclovio R. Barraza, on a scheduled
Albuquerque conference of the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has
provided the trigger for a movement of great social promise—the unification, politi-
cally and for purposes of demonstrating to achieve demands, of the country’s Mexican-
American population. This was the message from a gathering of 400 Mexican-American

leaders here on April 28.

The group met that evening to honor those participating in the Albuquerque

walkout.

“Because we have not cried out when we have been abused and exploited, we have
been ignored,” said Alfred Hernandez, a municipal judge in Houston, Texas, in main-

taining that the 6 million Mexi-
can-Americans in the U. S.,
mainly located in the South-
west, will begin demonstrating
in order to achieve equality of
employment and educational
opportunities.
Seek Johnson Meeting

Those in attendance at the
unity banquet, as had the dele-
gates to the EEOC conference
the month before, called for a
meeting with President Johnson
to explain to him personally
their charges of discrimina-
tion. Declaring not only that
some 800 industries in the
Southwest employ no Mexican-
Americans, but that the com-
mission’s own hiring practices
are discriminatory, the Albu-
querque group named a seven-
man committee to deliver the
complaints to the President if
he would grant an audience.

Barraza was named to rep-
resent Arizona on the commit-
tee, while Rudolph (Corky)
Gonzales, who on April 29 ad-
dressed a protest rally of over
1,200 Mexican-Americans at
Denver’s Civic, Center, is the
Colorado member.

Most of the major Mexican-
American organizations 5 e n t
representatives to the Los

1 Angeles meeting.

Other Speakers

Dr. Miguel Montes of San
Fernando, Calif, president of
the Latin American Civic As-
sociation, told the group that in
his state the Mexican-American
has a median of 8.6 years of
schooling, compared to the
Negro’s 10.5 years and the
Anglo-American’s 12.1.

Other principal speakers at
the affair were Augustine
Flores, national president of
the American GI Forum, and
Albert Pena, a county commis-
sioner in San Antonio, Texas,
national president of the Poli-
tical Association of Spanish
Speaking Organizations.

Gonzales, who told the ban-
quet delegates that the Mexi-
can-Americans’ problems are
national in scope, the previous
Sunday had been fired as head
of the Neighborhood Youth
Corps in Denver by lMa_yor
Thomas G. Cur.rigan for lack-
ing the “dignity” required by a
public official.

MILWAUKEE, Wisc. — Unfair
labor practice charges were
filed with the NLRB late in
March against the Mid-City
Foundry here, where members
of Mine-Mill Local 943 have
been on strike since Jan. 26.
The Union maintains that the
company is refusing to bargain
in good faith.

Several witnesses have indi-
cated that company representa-
tives have made such state-
ments as, “The company will

duced the turnout at the Den-
ver rally, where Gonzales and
other speakers called for politi-
cal involvement by those pres-
ent—both registering to vote
and running for precinct com-
initteeman whe-rever possible.
Carefully explaining that the
rally was not called in an at-
tempt to regain his position,
Gonzales termed it the begin-
ning of a “crusade for justice
which we are going to carry
into every city in Colorado.”

“If every Spanish-American
in the state uses his vote well,”
said Gonzales, “we can be the
leaders in a revolt at the polls
which will sweep the entire
Southwest.”

Currigan, a Democrat, ad-
mitted that he had no com-
plaints with the administration
of the NYC program by Gon-
zales, who still chairs the board
of directors of Denver’s War
on Poverty. The firing, said the
mayor, resulted from the or-
ganization by Gonzales of a
picket and boycott of the Rocky
Mountain News, the city’s morn-
ing newspaper, which had car-
ried stories critical of the War
on Poverty chairman.

The original story quoted an
Office of Economic Opportunity
official, who was not named, on
Denver’s program and Gon-
zales. Later storie-s named the
OEO source, who subsequently
maintain-ed he had been mis-
quoted and misinterpreted.

Harbison-Walker Labor
council Meets May 6

Representatives from four in-
ternational unions which bar-
gain with Harbison-Walker were
scheduled to meet in Chicago
on May 6, as this issue of the
Mine-Mill Union goes to press,
to plan strategy for upcoming
negotiations. »

Mine-Mill, Steel, Oil-Chemi-
cal, and the Stone Workers rep-
resent some 20 properties of the
company around the country.
Mine-Mill Locals 531 and 481 in
Bessemer, Ala. and Local 553
in Fairfield, Ala. participate in
the unified labor council, which
is chaired by Oil-Chemical’s
Millard Johnson of East Chi-
cago.

William Thomas of Mine-Mill
Local 531 is ‘the vice-president
of the council.

Medicare Deadline Extended

On April 8, President Johnson signed the Medi-
care Extension Act, which changes the deadline for
signing up for the supplementary medicare program
from March 31 to May 31. Reason for the extension
was that about 1 million Americans 65 and over ha-d
not indicated whether or not they wanted the volun-
tary doctor bill insurance program.

The $3 per month fee paid by the individual for
such coverage is matched by an equal amount paid
by the government. The supplementary program is a
bargain! .

Persons who are already drawing Social Secur-
ity or Railroad Retirement benefits are automati-
cally enrolled in the basic hospital and nursing home
medicare program.

However, if you or someone in your family has
reached age 65, and has not yet applied for the sup-
plementary benefits, MAKE SURE THIS IS DONE
IMMEDIATELY!

Pinta, who has been gathering
evidence to substantiate the
charges of the local union. Addi-
tionally, a few of the non-union

pany have admitted that they
were offered higher wages than
those proposed by Mid-City in

New Civil Rights Proposal

seeking a Congressional ban on
housing discrimination rather
than by using a presidential
executive order. Himself 3. co-
sponsor of the bill, J avits said
that the inclusion of the housing
section will mean a tough fight
for the entire bill.
Other Provisions

Also included in the proposal
are sections to prevent racial
discrimination in the selection
of juries, to protect civil rights
workers with tougher criminal
laws, to broaden the Attorney
General’s authority to initiate
suits to desegregate schools and
public facilities.

The bill, however, contains no
provision for the transfer from
state to federal courts the prose-
cution of major state crimes nor
any provision for the payment
of awards to victims of racially
motivated violence. Both of
these proposals are included in
a bill, backed by civil rights
leaders, which was earlier intro-
duced in the Senate by 10 Demo-
crats and three Republicans.

The administration proposal
specifies that juries for federal
courts shall be picked at random
from voting lists, without any
regard for racial considerations,
but does not set forth in detail
the procedure for choosing
juries for state courts. It does
say that the right to serve on
such juries ‘‘shall not be denied
on the basis of race or color,
religion, sex, national origin, or
economic status.”

"WASHINGTON, D. C. — The
Johnson administration late last
month came forward with a new

‘package of civil rights legisla-
tion. One section of the bi1l—a
ban on discrimination in the
sale, rental, and financing of
housing — appears headed for
trouble, at least on the Senate
side of the Congress. While the
House Judiciary C o m m i t t e e
opened hearings on the measure
on May 4, Senate Minority Lead-
er Everett Dirksen and Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield both in-

withdrawal indicated that any
real interest by the company in
safety might be demonstrated
by its spending more money to
improve conditions and less on
propaganda.

The union committee mem-
bers will continueto work with
the employees on safety mat-
ters.

Survey of Supervisors

The March 23 memorandum,
signed by M. D. Blackham, con-
centrator safety engineer, de-
scribed inthe union leaflet as
“another whiz kid, Johnny-
come-lately,” reported on a
questionnaire he earlier had
asked all supervisors to fill out.
The invalidity of the survey is
indicated by the fact that, with
over 60 supervisors responding,
not one listed “Lack of support
of safety programs from various
management groups” as one of
the “five most troublesome
areas in accident prevention.”

The top problems, according
to the supervisors, are “Em-
ployee resistance to wearing pre-

with a time limit for its clear-
ance.
Without such a time limit,
Southern foes of the proposal
can slow down action by the
committee, which is chaired by
Sen. James Eastland (D-Miss.).
Dirksen, who claims the "fair
" housing section is unconstitu-
tional, has indicated, too, that he
would support a filibuster

Skinner Blasts Anaconda Safety Record
litter Seventh Butte Death Since Sept. 16  

The deaths of Thomas A. Bires on April 23 at the Badger mine and of James Dunphy on "May
3 at the Leonard mine brought to a total of seven the number of Mine-Mill members killed at work
in _the Anaconda Company’s Butte mines since last September 16.

Mine-Mill International President A. C. Skinner, upon learning of the two latestfatalities. said,

I “The mine, safety record of the Anaconda .Company is appalling. There can be no valid’ excuse for
‘ seven deaths over a period of less than eight months in Butte.”

“This is the grim harvest,”
stated Skinner, “of, a totally in-
effective state-mine safety pro-
gram and the absence to date
of federal jurisdiction to protect
the lives of men who work in
onezof the most dangerous occu-
pations in America. Only pas-
sage. of mine safety legislation
now pending in the Congress in
Washington will afford these
men the protection which they
have been so "long" denied.”

Bires, working as a swamper
on an ore train at the Ana-
conda’s Badger mine when a
car was derailed, was fatally
crushed between the car and a
post in helping to try to get the

car back on the track. He died
at 11:45 a.m. on April 23 of a
broken neck.

A member of the Butte Min-
ers’ Union, Local 1, he was
working with his partner Lo-
renzo Taylor at the mine’s 1600-
foot level.

Born in Kentucky, Bires and
his parents moved to Butte in
1952. He served in the U. S.
Navy from 1960 to 1964, prior to ,
being hired by Anaconda last
year. His father, Arthur Bires,
works at the company’s Kelley
mine.

Bires, 23, was married and
had no children. He is survived

by his widow and parents. ,

Dunphy, a motorman, was
killed at approximately 1 a.m.
on -May 3 at the 2000-foot level
of the Leonard mine. He was
loading from a transfer chute
when a surge of water caused
the stop boards to break or be
pushed out. Dunphy was cov-
ered with muck and rock.

Dunphy, single, was born in
1922 at Meadow Grove, Nebras-
ka. He had been employed in
Butte since November 1965, and
had previously worked as a
miner in South Dakota. ,
_ He is survived by his mother
who lives in Ireland.

Local 392 Blasts Kennecott  
On Safety, Leaves Committee

MAGNA, UTAH——Issuing a strongly-w orded blast questioning the willingness of
the Kennecott Copper Corporation to work to improve the safety of working conditions,
the membership of Mine-Mill Local 392 at its meeting on April 5 unanimously voted
to withdraw from the joint union-company safety committee that was set up close to
a year ago. The union action followed the release late in March of an interoffice memo-
ran-dum to all supervisors at the concentrator, power plant, and ore haulage division

‘that pointed to “union resistance to enforcement of safety rules”. as one of the “most
troublesome areas in accident prevention.”

Challenging the company to specify even one instance in which the union resisted
honest, realistic safety rules or regulations, the union leaflet announcing the Local 392

scribed safety apparel and/or
equipment,” “Getting prompt
action in carrying out recom-
mendations to correct hazards,”
“Poor housekeeping,” “Union
resistance to enforcement of
safety rules,” and “Getting em-
ployees to recognize unsafe con-
ditions.” Local 392 challenged,
too, the validity of the first
item listed.

Other categories of the 23
listed which no supervisor saw
as one of the “most trouble-
some” areas were “Inadequate
guarding of machines and
equipment” and “Fire and ex-
plosion hazards.”

The- Arthur and Magna Mill-
men’s Union thus withdraws
from participation in the joint
safety committee just after an-
other Kennecott local, Mine-Mill
Local 233 in McGill, Nev., had
agreed to try again to work with
such a committee. The Nevada
local, which earlier had with-
drawn from a similar joint com-
mittee, in March agreedto par-
ticipate again following a com-
pany pledge to attempt to im-
prove its relationship with the
employees. =

A 1965 Meeting

The joint safety committees
were established close to a year
ago following an April meeting
between the Mine-Mill Kenne-
cott Council and the top man-
agement of the company’s West-
ern Mining Division. It was
agreed at that time that 20
specific safety suggestions pre-
sented by the union would be

pursued by joint safety commit- '

tees on the local level.

While the company in the past
year has made token attempts
toward the correction of no-cost
low-cost items among the
union’s proposals, many prob-
lems still remain. Nothing has
been done about dust and smoke
in the Magna boiler shop. The
equipment operators in Ruth,
Nev. and Bingham Canyon,
Utah still are reporting inade-
quate berms, lack of proper
dump lighting, and lack of a
proper training program for new
drivers. Improper sanitation in
lunch and change rooms contin-
ues to be a problem in Utah.

George Metcalf, LeRoy
Vaughn, Albert Wade, Lloyd
Beck, and Ken McKay, who

have represented Local 392 one

the joint union-company safety
committee, have spent. much
time in leading the fight for
safety improvements—not only
by cooperating with Blackham
and Kenny Simper, the company
safety engineers, in joint inspec-
tion tours, meetings and follow-
ups, but also in meeting with
workers of the various depart-
ments to encourage safe prac-
tices and procedures on the job.

The membership of the local,
in calling for withdrawal from
the joint committee, obviously
felt that the union committee
members were entitled to praise
for their work, rather than'be-
ing blamed by company super-
visors for the continuation of
many unsafe conditions.

The questionnaire, which orig-

inated in the steel industry and '

was used by Kennecott without
modification, since the Local 392
meeting has been retracted by
the company.

Supervisors Hi‘!

In‘ the information bulletin it
put out, Local 392 notes that
the union safety committeemen
maintain that “At no time in
any joint safety committee
meeting has any supervisor ever
raised or pointed to any unsafe,

unsanitary, or excessive dust.

condition, nor has any super-
visor ever oﬁered any remedy
or corrective suggestion.”

In its leaflet, too, the union
attacks the misrepresentation of
facts in “KCC’s deceitful safety
publicity every Sunday- evening
on ‘Poverty Playhouse’ ”—the
name given by workers, local
townspeople, and, indeed, many
of/the company’s salaried em-
ployees to the Kennecott-spon-
sored Sunday night movie. Dur-
ing the hour-and-a-half television
program, commercials tend to
focus on the company’s “pov-

erty”-—due, it is maintained, to-=

excess over-burden at the pit,‘

excess taxation of its operations, .

the high cost of labor, the low
grade of copper, competition
from substitute materials, and a
variety of other reasons.

Supreme court llods Arizona loyalty Oath;

Tucson couple Win $60,629 in Back Pay

WASHINGTON, D. C.——The U. S. Supreme Court, in a '5-to-4 ruling on April 18, declared Ari-
zona’s five-year-old loyalty oath unconstitutional on grounds that it “threatens the cherished free-
dom ‘of association protected by the First Amendment.” The decision—the latest of several in this
area in the past few years—-means $60,629 in back pay to Barbara and Vernon Elfbrandt -of Tuc-
son, Ariz., who decidedthat the oath violates individual rights when it was first -approved by the

state legislature in 1961.

Both junior high school teachers in Tucson -and member-s of the American Federation of Teach-
ers, AFL-CIO, there, Mr. and Mrs. Elfbrandt refused to take the -oath and -have been working
without pay——living on contributions, loans, and other help from friends. Mrs. Elfbrandt, who filed

the suit challenging the legali-
ty of the loyalty oath, is owed
$33,483 from Amphitheater Jun-
ior High, while her husband has
$27,146 coming for four years’
work at Doolen Junior High.

Tucson attorney W. Edward
Morgan carried the case
through the Arizona courts and
to the ‘U. S. Supreme Court, ar-
guing that the loyalty oath law
was vague and that it violated
the due process provisions of
the U. "S. Constitution. The vic-
tory was_ his first before the
high court.

Providing a share of moral
and financial support to the
Elfbrandts during the lengthy
legal test was -Mine-Mill, which
traditionally has opposed such
oaths on principle, as have
many other “labor unions. Con-
tributing financially were the
international union, the Arizona
Mine-Mill Council, and several
of the locals in Arizona. Civil
rights organizations, Quaker
groups, and the teachers’ union
were among the many contribu-
tors.

Mrs. Elfbrandt, who stated
that without such backing she
and her husband could not have
persisted in their goal, noted
that they received checks and
letters from throughout the na-
tion and from some foreign
countries during the long fight.

The Arizona loyalty oath law,
which required public em-
ployees to swear to uphold the
state and U. S. constitutions,
contained no provisions for dis-
charging those refusing to take
the oath, but only for cutting
off their salaries.

Douglas Writes Opinion

Justice William 0. Douglas
wrote the majbrity opinion for
the court, being joined by Chief
Justice Earl Warren and Jus-
tices Hugo Black, William Bren-

' nan, and Abe Fortas; Justice

Byron R. White dissented in a
minority opinion, along with
Justices Tom Clark, John Har-
lan, and Potter Stewart.

“Those who join an organiza-
tionbut do not share its unlaw-
ful purposes and who do not
participate in its unlawful activ-
ities surely pose no threat,
either as citizens or as’ public
employees,” said Douglas, in
noting that the oath broadly
covered membership in the
Communist party and similar
organizations rather than “a
specific intent to further the un-
lawful aims” of the organiza-
tions.

Previous Decisions

8 In 1964, the Supreme Court
threw out on grounds of vague-
ness two Washington state loy-
alty oaths—one for teachers, the
other’for all state employees.
In 1960, the court ruled against
an Arkansas ‘law that requires
teachers to report any organiza-
tions to which they had be-
longed or contributed during the
past five years ‘and, the follow-
ing year, threw» out part of
Florida’s oath for public em-
ployees. ,

Although ar-o und 1950 the
court had upheld loyalty oaths

 for city employees in Los An-

geles, teachers in New York
state, and candidates for public
office in Maryland, in 1952 it
struck down 'Ok1ahoma’s oath
for public employees. That law,
which had disqualified for pub-

_  jlic jernployment ‘anyone who ‘had
‘ .' '- once belonged to a “subversive”

organization,‘ “offends «due pro-
cess,’? ‘said the court, ‘by, pun-

wing, activity-., "

 
       

as "well -as’

1lowin‘g.»f-the- April’. 18‘ _ court _.

decision in the Arizona case,
The Denver Post said editorial-
ly that a Colorado 'oath,, affect-
ing all teachers in public -and
private schools and colleges and
universities, should be thrown
out by the courts or repealed
by the legislature. Pointing to
the fact that a leading philoso-
pher recently turned ‘down a
professorship ‘at the University
of Colorado, the Post main-

‘ _tained that the oath “is unlikely

to keep bad men out, only good
men, and it is hard to "see any
useful purpose in it.”

The Colorado oath requires
teachers to -swear that they
will “teach, by precept or
example, respect for the flags
of the United States and the
state of Colo-rado, respect for
law and order, and -undivided
allegiance to‘ the government of
one country, the ’-United States
of America.” Noting the vague-
ness in what such an oath re-
quire-s, the Post declared, “Most
university teachers who come
to Colorado take the oath and
simply ignore it, but some men
are conscientious about the
things they swear to do and
some resent being singled out
from other citizens for special
oaths of allegiance.”

The ruling in the Arizona case-

brandts, Clyde Appleton, who
refused to sign the loyalty oath,
but taught in Tucson School

$6,808 ‘coming.

Gerald Dulgov, another Dis-
trict 1 teacher, also refused to
sign the oath from 1961 to 1963.
Although he then changed his
mind and signed the oath, he
collected $13,160 in winning a
Superior Court suit.

Fertilizer Gouneil
Meeting Scheduled

SAVANNAH, Ga. — The
Mine-Mill Fertilizer Council,
comp-rised of representatives
from three Southern locals,
will be reactivated at a
meeting here on June 11.
Discussion will center on up-
coming negotiations with the
some dozen fertilizer com-
panies under contract with
the union.

Involved are Local 838 in
Macon, Ga., -Local 863 in
Charleston, S. C., and Lo-
cal 870 in Savannah.

labor Hopes to
Cut Section l3
from Safely Bill

(Continued from Page 1)

according to Mine-Mill Interna-
tional Representative Leo Ter-
rill, who is in Washington for the
duration of the mine safety cam-.
paign. It is felt that the industry
will push for further weakening
amendments even if it should
find itself unable to prevent
passage of the bill.

-Chairman of the ‘Senate Com-
mittee on Labor and Public Wel-
fare is Lister Hill (D-Ala.l).
Other Democratic members are
Wayne Morse of Oregon, Jen-
nings Randolph -of West Vir-
ginia, Claiborne P-ell of Rhode
Island, Gaylord Nelson of Wis-
consin, who chaired the hear-
ings, and Robert Kennedy of
New York, all of whom sat on
the subcommittee, and Ralph
Yarborough of Texas, Joseph
Clark of Pennsylvania, "Harrison
Williams of New Jersey, and
Edward Kennedy of Massachu-
setts. ‘

Republicans on the committee
are Javits, Winston Prouty of
Vermont, Paul Fannin of Ari-
zona, who serve on the subcom-
mittee, and Pete-r Dominick of
Colorado and George Murphy of
California.

Sen. Pat McNamara (D-
Mich.), a longtime strong sup-
porter of labor legislation, who
was chairman of the Labor Sub-
committee, died on April 30.
Seriously ill and in the hospital
for many weeks, he was unable

At New Hall in Oracle

ORACLE, Ari-z.——Some 20 delegates conducted a
wide range of business on April 20 at a meeting of the

Mine-Mill Magma Council at Local 937’s new hall here— '

a building that h-ad been dedicated only three days before,

in ceremonies attended by Arizona Governor Sam I

Goddard.

In addition to -discussing political and legislative ac-
tivity on both federal and state levels, the council dealt
with suggestions fo-r strengthening the day-to-day func-
tioning of the local unions through more regular training

sessions for officers and stew-
ards, -better use of publicity,
more extensive recreational ac-
tivities, and by other means.
The council is comprised of L0-
cal 937 in San Manuel and Lo-
cal 938 in Superior.
Key Election Year

In his opening report to‘ the
meeting, Board Member Ma-
clovio R. Barraza said that be-
cause of reapportionment this
will be a key year in which to
gain labor seats in the legis-
lature. Attempts will be m.ade,
he said, to coordinate the poli-
tical activity of Mine-Mill, the
AFL-CIO, and Mexican-Amer-
ican, Negro, and Indian groups
in several of the newly-created
senatorial districts, such as the
Apache-Greenlee-Navajo Coun-
ties area, the Pinal-Gila ‘sena-
torial district, and the Santa
Cruz-Cochise-Graham district.

Barraza reported, too, -on the
campaign for a bill which would
liberalize the benefits under
the state's Industrial Disease
Act-—a bill which was approved
quickly by the House, but which
has bogged down in the Senate.

On a motion by Nick Key of
Local .937, the council voted to
send a telegram to U. S. Sen.
Paul Fannin (R-Ariz.) urging
his support for a strong fed-
eral mine safety bill. Barraza
noted that an April 25 meeting
with the Senator had been ar-

_ranged, to further discuss this

proposed -legislation with him.
In a discussion of carrying
grievances to arbitration, it

"was noted that experience has

shown that even excellent cases
are occasionally lost, much less
bad ones. Sinc e arbitration

losse-s can set bad precedents,
it was agreed that greater care

 

must be devoted to the ques-
tion of appealing cases. It is
unfair to the grievant to build

his hopes falsely by pursuing a "

poor case, it was noted.
Local 938 Purchase

Pascual Herrera, president of 

Local 938, -announced that eight
acres of land near Superior
have been purchased by the .10-
cal and that tentative plans are
underway for the construction
of a new building.

International Representative ‘

that time be set aside at each

tional use. Delegates agreed
that this type of material, such

as that recently presented ‘in

programs by Honorary Presi-

dent John Clark, has been help-‘ A
ful. Members of the two locals ‘ V

also should be encouraged to at-_
tend each other’s meetings, Wil-

 The National Farm Workers’ Strike
    —-A Struggle for Social Justice

by Maclovio R. Barraza
Board Member for District 2

. “ IVA LA HUELGA,” “Viva la Causa” are the slogans of the

V striking National Farm Workers Association. The huelga or
, strike by farm workers started last September against the $175
_ million a year grope growing industry in the Delano, California
= _area. Issues at the time the strike started were wages of $1.40 an
hour, union recognition, sanitary conditions in the work fields
and better housing.

~ Cesar Chavez, a 39-year old Mexican-American, has led this

, strike from an obscure effort to a-struggle that has gained national

. attention and wide support from labor, church and student groups,
’ vil rights organizations, and now from some politicians.

  John Steinbeck in The Grapes of Wrath immortalized the farm
workers’ toil and sweat in the fields. Cesar Chavez and his strikers
are appealing to the conscience of our country
by focusing attention on the plight of the “Mexi-

‘ cano” farm workers. They remind our country
that, while the working conditions of most

" “workers have improved, the farm worker is

still being robbed by the “pa.trones.” The farm
workers are not protected by minimum wage‘
laws, Social Security, the right to organize and
bargain collectively, ,etc.—things that, unfortu-

’ nately, many of our’ Mine-Mill members take
for granted.

i’- ' Thestrikers throughout have conducted a
non-violent struggle, but not the “patrones”
and their stooges. They have used every weap-

‘," t "on at their command—-police brutality, arrests,
beatings, jailings, scabs, and the pitting of
one Mexican against another. It is comical to hear that the grape

__ growers cry, “The strike is a myth led by outside agitators,”

5 ’ ("where have we heard this before? ), when the strike leader, Chavez,

' has been a farm worker since childhood. .

la Huelga,” “Viva la Causa,” “Peregr2'nacion, Penitencia, Revolu-
c2'on,” resting in towns along the route, where local residents helped
feed them.and bed them down for the night.

; V ' - It was while the peregrinacion was inprogress that the Schen-

ley Corporation agreed to recognize the union and begin contract
» ‘neg.otiations- within 30. days. The following day, the giant DiGiorgio
.- Corporation offered to have an election to determine if their em-
f ployees wanted a union. This was obviously a maneuver by Di-
. Giorgio. to take the heat. off, since the company wanted strikebreak-
ers,, not strikers-,. to vote. Needless to say, the offer wa-s turned
 down by the union.

‘ * 1: 1%

WE ‘IN MINE-MILL have been fortunate to associate ourselves
up with this struggle by the farm workers. Last January, Dolores
‘ Huerta, vice-president of the NFWA, spoke at our Arizona Mine-
Mill Council meeting and attended local union meetings in Bayard,.
’ NM. and El Paso, Texas. The locals and councils, in turn, made
financial contributions and assisted in the Schenley boycott.

., Our international executive board, at its February meeting, voted’
a financial contribution. and circularized our local unions for con-
tributions. and support.

, Cesar Chavez has said, “This is the beginning of a social move-
'ment.” The tremendous struggle of the farm workers and other
-rrecentimportant developments in the Mexican-American commu-
nity and organizations ‘leads. me to wonder. Could it be. that the
. ‘Mexican-American “sleeping giant” has at long last begun to wake
up?’ Could it be that we are finally starting to learn something from
our Negro brothers?

Discrimination Charges Filed
Against AS&R in Baltimore

BALTIMORE, Md.—Jamuel Tarrant, president of Mine-Mill Local 625, on April 7
filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission against
AS&R, charging the company with discrimination against Negroes “in the selection of
foremen, guards, skilled mechanics, office employees, and in promotion and transfer

into higher-rated jobs.”

An employee of American Smelting and Refining for some 26 years, Tarrant said

he believes the company has and continues to discriminate.

The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission was established by the Civil

Rights Act of 1964. The fair em-
ployment section of that law be-
came effective last summer.

Movement by Company

Although no finding by the
commission on Tarrant’s
charges has yet been returned,
AS&R has hired, since the state-
ment was filed, the first Negro
to work in its clerical office and
a Negro welder for the mechan-
ical department, where very few
Negroes ever have been em-
ployed. Additionally, the com-
pany is hiring a Negro techni-
cian for the laboratory.

In his complaint, Tarrant
pointed to the facts that there
are no Negro foremen in the-
plant, although several workers
had been promoted to that posi-
tion during the past year; that
there are no Negro guards, al-
though five or six guards were
hired in the past year; that
there have never been Negroes
employed for the office staff, al-

Trial Employee
Reinsiaied in
Nev. Arbitration

McGILL, Nev-.-Although the
company has the right to set
standards for hiring, the union
and a trial employee may chal-
lenge through the grievance pro-
cedure management’s decision
that the worker lacks qualifica-
tions, arbitrator Dr. George H.
Hildebrand ruled in March, in
awarding Marvin Zingleman re-
instatement on the job a-t Ken-
necott"s. reduction plant here for
an additional trial period not to
exceed 30 days. The ruling.
hinged on a clause in the con-
tract between the company and
Mine-Mill Locals 233 and 124
that trial. employees “will be
subject to the provisions of the
contract.”

Noting, therefore, that a trial
employee is not denied‘ all
rights, but is “entitled to all of
the protections extended by con-
tract,” Hildebrand said that, in
his opinion, Kennecott had
“failed to make out a  con-
 case” against the termi-
nated worker. He pointed out
that at the arbitration hearing

- in the case on Dec. 20- none_of

six forem-en to whom Zingleman
has been assigned during 21
work days at the plant testified.

Originally hired by the com-
pany’s Nevada Mines Division
last May 5, Zingleman, who
came under the jurisdiction of
Mine-Mill Local 233, was re-
leased on June 4 because of
what the company termed his
“work attitude.” Such generali-
zation, declared the arbitrator
from Ithaca, N. Y., had to be
backed up with probative evi-
dence.

No Counselling

There was no record, Hilde-
brand also pointed out, of any
job counselling having been at--
tempted—a procedure to which
Zingleman was entitled if his
work was of the caliber claimed
by the company.

In addition to the terminated
worker, taking part in the arbi-
tration case for the union were
Phil George and Otto Gross,
president and ﬁnancial secre-
tary respectively of Local 124 in
Ruth and Vall Thiessens, presi-
dent, Jay Carson, financial sec-
retary, and Tom Jones, record-
ing secretary of Local‘. 233 in

- McGill. ‘  *

though AS&R trains people for
those jobs. Negroes had never
held jobs as mechanics, he con-
tinued, nor as electricians, al-
though the majority of electri-
cians were trained by the com-
pany.

The Local 625 president also
provided examples of discrimi-
nation in promotion to higher-
rated jobs, showing that whites
with less seniority were selected
over Negroes with longer ser-
vice with the company.

Locker facilities at the plant
“are maintained on a segre-

gated basis in Casting House
‘C’,” said Tarrant, declaring
that “while lockers are as-
signed, the whites are given a
choice in order to maintain
segregation.”

Mine-Mill AS&R Council co-
ordinator Irving Dichter, in a

Dlelnher Dies at 47

George Herman, a former Mine-Mill international representa-

tive, who worked for the union in both the United States and .

Canada, died recently at the age of 47.
Born in Montreal, he served with distinction in the Royal
Canadian Air Force during World War II as a bombardier-naviga-

tor. Following the war, he
moved to Los Angeles and be-
came business representative
for Mine-Mill Local 700 there.
Before long, Herman was ap-
pointed to the international staff
and, in 1950, he returned to
Canada in that capacity.

It was during his service in
the Unite-d States, however, that
he provided the leadership for
a successful public campaign
to prevent the extradition of a
Negro brother, Lester Tate,
from California to. Virginia,
where Tate had been sentenced
to 10 years on the chain gang
and from where he had escaped.
Herman was notified of vic-
tory in this important civil
right case by then-Gov. Earl
Warren’s office, which 
nounced that the extradition
papers served by the governor
of Virginia would not be hon-
ored.

Following his. return to
Canada, Herman worked with
Local 637 in Port Colbome and
Local 889 in Marmara, as well
as with other smaller locals in
the Toronto area.

He left the staff of the union-
in 1954 for personal reasons, but
returned. that same year for a
short period’ to head a cam-
paign to have shown the movie
“Salt of the Earth,” in the face
of. opposition from the film in-
dustry. A ﬂoat entered in the
Toronto Labor Day parade,

sponsored by UAW Local 303,
advertised the film, which was
seen by great numbers of
Canadian trade unionists.

Mine-Mill leaders and mem-

bers from both Canada and the
U. S. mourn his-death at so

-early an age and offer their

deepest’ sympathy and condo-
lences to his wife Nina and their
children.

THE ‘MINE-MILL union

if Ifm.yi‘ii,i'.9;4

3 ’ Bargaining, legislative and political action, press and education, and organization
' were the major topics focused upon at two recent l\/line-Mill leadership conferences in
the South. The very productive two-day meetings were held in Bessemer, Ala. on
March 25 and 26, with delegates from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama locals in
attendance, and in Savannah, Ga. on April 2 and 3, at which South, Carolina, Alabama,
and Georgia locals were represented.
. International President A. C. Skinner, in addressing the conferences, outlined the
status of the union—its past battles and future perspectives——and discussed the cam-
paign for a federal mine safety bill, including his testimony before a Senate Labor
' Subcommittee earlier in March. Declaring that both white and Negro workers have
learned that segregation is extremely costly, he pledged the union’s continued leader-
ship in the campaign for civil rights and equal opportunity for all.
Passage of federal civil rights legislation in the past two years has provided a
fresh breeze blowing throughout the South and other parts of the country, emphasized

Skinner and International Vice-
President Asbury Howard, who
also spoke at the meetings.

Pointing out that, whereas
there were only 53,000 Alabama
Negroes registered to Vote in
1962, today some 225,000 are
registered in the state, Howard
said that 11 Negroes were run-
ning for the state legislature
there this year.

Hood Speech

One of four Negroes running

for the legislature from Jeffer-
son County, David H. Hood, Jr.
of Bessemer, an attorney, ad-
dressed the Bessemer meeting,
noting his long record of work-
ing with Mine-Mill and pledging

Whis support for legislation that

, would benefitthe working man.
District 4 Executive Board
Member Ra_ymond Dennis, who
chaired the conferences, also
assisted the bargaining commit-

-tees that were set up at the

two meetings. In reporting to the
delegates, the groups stressed
that 1966 should be a good year

for negotiations because of the

economic boom and in spite of

the fact that the federal govern-

ment is attempting to hold con-

tract ‘gains down to the so-called

“wage guidelines” of 3.2 per-

cent—-“guidelines” which are
opposed by the entire labor
. movement.

In addition to substantial wage
increases, the committees rec-
ommended that locals go after
pension improvements, supple-
mental unemployment and work-
men’s compensation plans,
health and welfare and vacation
gains. Contract language on
seniority and on the size of work
crews, work loads, and doubling
up on jobs should be‘ clarified,
it was decided.

The committees noted the im-
portanceof each local having
enough stewards to adequately

police the contract and said that
efforts must be made to more

pfully educate the rank-and-file

on the provisions of the con-

tracts. — _
- " Need for PAC

’- Calling upon all locals to im-
mediately establish functioning
political action committees,
wherever such committees are
not already operative, the dele-
gates to the leadership confer-
ences agreed that voter regis-
tration must continue to be
speeded up. With the Alabama
primary election set .for May 3
(runoff to be held within 30
days), all locals were urged to
-set up the necessary machinery
to get outthe vote. Primary
dates in the other Southern-
states are as follows: Missis-
sippi, June 7; South Carolina,
June 14; Tennessee, Aug. .4; and

.‘ . Georgia, Sept. 14.

Delegates also backed legisla-
tive committee recommenda-
tions to work for passage of the
federal mine safety bill, an in-
crease in the minimum wage to
$1.75, equalization of unemploy-
ment compensation under a fed-
eralbill, with extension of cov-

herage from 26 weeks’ to one"

‘year. Although, dead for this
tyear, the repeal of Section 14(b)

  of _ the ' Taft-Hartley Act was

Haughton of Detroit, appointed
as an arbitrator by the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Ser-
vice, recently handed down two
separate decisions. .

Black, an oiler-greaser at the

ed a 36 cents per hour wage dif-

ferential that the company had
refused to pay fo-r the four-week
period that he had filled in on a
higher rated job,

In addition to denying the com-
pany’s contention that Guarino’s

‘grievance was not arbitrable,

Haughton ruled that Harbison-
Walkert had violated the senior-
ity provisions of the contract

. concerning transfer of an em-

ployee. Guarino was qualified to
work as a tunnel kiln operator

The Labor Scene  

Pension Protection Proposed

Senator Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) has introduced a bill to pro-
tect workers’ pensions if a company goes out of business. The idea
is to set up a system similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation which protects an individual’s bank deposits. One of
the strongest labor backers of such a plan is the United Auto
Workers. More than 4,000 UAW members at Studebaker lost most
of their pension rights when the South Bend, Ind. plant shut. down.

Clerks Win Prescription Benefit

Food and Drug Clerks Local 1092 in Portland, Ore. have nego-
tiated a new benefit under their health and welfare plan. Members
will be reimbursed 80 percent of the cost of prescriptions needed
by themselves and their families. Included in this coverage are
prescribed vitamins, cough mixtures, eye and ear medicines, ant-
acids, insulin and other diabetic supplies.

This feature is in addition to other usual coverage of the em-
ployer-financed health program which already includes payment
for 90 percent of dental care.

ILGWU "Family Blood Bank" Program

A New York local of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers
has worked out an arrangement with the Red Cross for a “family
blood bank.” Any member of the local who wants to participate is
required to donate one pint of blood to the blood bank each year.
The plan then assures the member and his family of a free and
unlimited supply of blood whenever a transfusion is required.

Wage Gains Being Eaten Up

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported early this month that
factory workers “real spendable earnings’_’ (take-home pay ad-
justed for changes in the cost-of-living index) have shown no change
in the past year. Wage increases haven’t been large enough to
counteract higher prices and increased Social Security taxes.

Big Wage Hikes Sought in Britain
_ Following the big Labor Party win in England, British trade
unions are pushing for substantial wage increases. Teachers are

asking for a 22 percent increase over two years. Coal mine-rs, who

won up to five percent less than a year ago, are asking for an
additional five percent. Truck drivers, furniture, pottery, and other
workers are asking from three to eight percent wage increases.

Ah. Come Fill the Cup

The Wall Street Journal reports an unusual on-the-job training
program. Five hundred members of a New York City local of liquo-r
store employees were given a wine-tasting party by a winery re-
cently “to educate union members on the characteristics of the
products which they sell.” * * *

NLRB Union Established

The newest union on the scene is an independent organization
representing employees of the National Labor Relations Board. It
bargains for 1,700 employee-s in 39 NLRB offices across the country.
One contract covers professionals; another clerical workers. The
contracts have provisions covering dues checkoff, grievance proced-
ure, job evaluation—but nothing o-n wage rates. Congress has sole
authority to set pay scales.

Trainmen Seek 25 Percent Increase

_ Civilkights Leaders Back Minimum
c Wage Hike

Passage of the higher minimum wage bill was urged by seven

' national civil rights leaders‘, who said, “A living wage should be

the right-of all working'Americans.” The seven pointed out that

aside from its importance to the War on Poverty, passage of the
proposed $1.60 minimum was, in effect, the most “crucial" civil‘

rights issue before Congress.

The joint statement, presented to a Congressional committee;
» was signed by A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of

ern Christian Leadership. Conference; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP;

‘Stereo to Drive By

x:-..- 

' Stereo tape music to drive by has already caught the fancy of
one-half million Americans. The May issue of CONSUMER RE-
PORTS comments on the trend, discusses four and eight-track
systems, their prices, faults, and questions of safety. Two of three
models of players tested gave satisfactory performance although
not up to what’s available for the home.

The four-track tape cartridge has two separate stereo channels
on a length of tape and can play up to two hours. The eight-track
type splits its music up into four stereo channels, each lasting up
to 20 minutes. Both types use endless tape loops, but the cartridge
from one cannot be used in the other. While CU engineers judged
two of the three tape players and speaker kits produced satisfac-
tory sound, the tone quality was found to be a notch above in the
model using the four-track system. However, a sizable group of
larger automotive and recording companies have recently an-
nounced that they will sell eight-track systems. The eight-track
system appears to be the bandwagon almost everyone is climbing
aboard.

Prices of the players alone range from $99.50 to $139.50. A
speaker kit with two speakers costs from $24.95 to $29.95 from one
source and four-speaker kits, from two other sources, about $19.

The eight-track cartridges vary in cost from $3 to $10, depend-
ini on duration and program. The four-track cartridges also vary
——the largest holding about two hours of music, costing $17.95.

Unless the player is ordered as new equipment with a car,
installation requires the services of a skilled technician, which, in
some instances, has run about $40. To avoid a possibly discon-
certing lack of balance between the sound from front and rear
speakers, a fader control should be included in the installation.
Some systems include it; if not, the extra cost is modest.

If your car is very small or very crowded under the dashboard,
CONSUMER REPORTS advises that you check carefully with the
seller before buying; installation may be difficult or impossible.

And a rear engine may produce enough heat at the rear deck to

cause deterioration of speakers mounted there. .

CU suggests that a user of an auto tape system should resist
the temptation to turn the volume so high that he can’t hear a
horn or siren, and he obviously should stay alert.

Briefs From May, 1966 Consumer Reports

If you’ve been waiting for color TV to get below the $300 mark

buy., the May issue of CONSUMER REPOR.TS ﬁnds a 16-inch model
which "makes the grade. Its price is $7., or more under the list

little less than top quality.

The May issue of CONSUMER REPORTS makes. some de-
tailed comparisons of medium-priced V8 automobiles including the
riding comfort, available engine options, and road-test results.
The report opens with the question, “If you ‘move up’ from a
Chevrolet, Ford, or Plymouth to-, say, a medium-priced‘ Buick,
Mercury, Oldsmobile, or Chrysler, how much more will you be
getting for the additional $100 to $500 you will pay?” The succinct
answer is you will be getting a car 7 to 10 inches longer, and, on
the average, 300 pounds heavier. But, in each case,. it will have
the same body shell as its lower-priced counterpart.

The medium.-price-range car will probably have a little more

. trunk room but no more passenger space. Among the tested cars,

only one provided extra knee room for the rear seat passengers. '

CU found that the premium. price will also buy a bigger, thirstier
engine, needed to haul the extra weight; it won’t make the car
noticeably livelier. On an average, you will get a somewhat better
ride over smooth boulevards. Beyond these differences, the extra
price you pay will buy you a more prestigious name.

Should Doctors Profit From Prescriptions?

The growing concern about the ethical question of doctors who
own drugstores or drug. repackaging firms or eyeglass businesses
is reviewed in the May issue of CONSUMER REPORTS.

The article points out that Senator Philip A. Hart told the
Senate last fall that a bare minimum of 10,500- doctors, out of the
nation’s 200,000 doctors, are selling products they prescribe.

A doctor"s obligation to his patient has two priorities, according
to the American Medical Association. The first is to provide the
best possible medical care. The subordinate but important second
priority is to keep the cost down as much as possible. As Dr.
Edward L. Fitzgerald wrote to a Senate subcommittee in 1961, that
ownership tempts the physician to ask “how much he can prescribe
and how much longer he can keep his patient on ‘his profitmaking
medication.”

An investigation of doctor-owned drugstores by the California

. State Board of Pharmacy turned up an episode underlining Dr.

  
  

 

Fitzgerald's point. A doctor in Richmond, California, suddenly
began prescribing quite lavishly for welfare patients whose drug
bills were paid for by the county government. Investigation dis-
closed, that he had opened a pharmacy adjoining his office and
was seeing to it that all his welfare patients had their prescriptions
filled at his new establishment. That year the county welfare de-
partment paid $50,000 for his patients’ drugs, up from $10,000 the
year before, when he was only a doctor and not a drugstore owner,

 Similar evidence has been reported. in Nevada, Kansas, and
 owa. .

Inclusion of Locals
I8 and 890 in Joint
Bargaining Pressed

Mine-Mill AS&R Council Co-
ordinator Irving Dichter, in an
April 19 letter to the company,
called for the inclusion of Locals
18 and 890 in the joint bargain-
ing on pensions that is expected
to get underway in the near fu-
ture. Local 18 in Kellogg, Idaho
represents the workers at the
Page and Galena mines, while
Local 890 in Bayard, N. M. has
bargaining rights at the Ground
Hog property, where some 120

’men are involved in a lengthy,

but solid strike against Ameri-
can Smelting and Refining.
With the AS&R pension pro-
gram due to expire on June 30,
Dichter also formally notified
the company of the expiration
and submitted the union’s pro-

‘posals on pensions, which had .

been worked out at an AS&R
Council meeting in March and

May. 1:966 ‘L 

 

then approved by the various _' 

locals. He noted that the union
is prepared to open negotiations
“at the earliest possible time
prior to June 30, 1966.”

V The AS&R Council represents, ,
some 5,000 workers throughout

the country. In addition to the
pension agreement at the Page

and Galena mines, those at 12 7

other AS&R properties, repre-,
sented by 11 Mine-Mill locals
that have bargained jointly with
the company, expire at the end
of next month. .

Local 890 won an NLRB elec-
tion last year at Ground Hog,
when the property was reopened.
after a shutdown of several

penicillin at a rate approximately eight times higher than the other
physicians in the study.

The drug reserpine, occasionally used for severe emotional dis-
orders, offers a good example of how doctors who own a drug
repackaging business. find it profitable not to use generic names.

Reserpine was selling. to druggists in 1964 at between $9» and $39"

per 1,000 tablets under its three major brand names. Some doctor-
owned repackagers were buying the same tablets from generic-
name suppliers for 75 cents to $2.75 per 1,000, then selling them,
under their own brands, to druggists at $10 to $30 or more per 1,000.

Despite the fact that since 1963, the AMA has held it “unethical
for a physician to have a financial interest in a drug repackaging
company” or to “own stock in a pharmaceutical company which
he can control or does control while actively engaged in the prac-
tice of medicine,” the Hart subcommittee hearings brought out
the fact that the AMA had done virtually nothing about enforcing
this rule. The Senate subcommittee provided the AMA with a list
of 30 such companies in August of 1964; a year later, the subcom-
mittee gave the AMA a new list of 150; and early this year, Senator
Hart. reported, “The best I can ascertain today is that the com-
panies are still flourishing—-with their doctor-owners.”

A spokesman for the National Association of Retail Druggists,
appearing before the same committee, said. that in a midwestern
state, prescriptions filled in doctor-owned pharmacies “are priced
as much as $1.50 to $2 higher than when dispensed by independent
pharmacies.” An optician in. Los Angeles claimed-that he -had
found, in his own survey of eyeglass prices, that ophthalmologists
there were charging $7.50 to $15.10'more for eyeglasses than local
optici-ans charged. 0 .

Senator Hart. has: introduced Senate’ Bill S--2568,. titled the
“Medical Restraint of. Trade Act.” It would simply forbid a doctor
to make. a profit, directly or indirectly, from the sale to his patients

“Increasing Uneasiness Seen
 On Continued War inViet Nam

Returning to Washington after the Easter recess last month, Senators and Con-
_ gressmen report that two primary issues are troubling the constituents back home in
’ the early stages of this year’s Congressional election——inflation and the war in Viet

The cost-of-living has been rising at a sharply increased rate since last November
and there has been much talk of a possible tax increase as a brake on the economy—a
course that President Johnson confidently hopes to avoid. If prices, for example for

be essential to the making and
keeping of a peaceful settlement
in that region.”

Suggesting. that such a confer-
ence might best be held in
Japan or Burma “or some other
proximate and appropriate
s etting,” Mansfield declared
that it is in Asia, “where the
implications“ of this war are
most grim” . . . “where peace
must now be — directly and
vigorously—sought.” The Mon-
tana Democrat was one of five
Senators who, early this year,
had issued a grim report on the
war to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee following a 35-
day world tour late in 1965.

That report, entitled “The
Viet Nam Conflict: The Sub-
stance and the Shadow,” had
stated that “the basic concept
of present American policy with
respect to Viet Nam” is the role
of support of the Vietnamese
government and people, yet con-
tended that “This concept be-
comes more difficult to main-
tain as the military participa-
tion of the U. S. undergoes rapid
increase.” Yet, if the concept is
eroded, stated the January re-
port, the war will be drained of
a purpose with meaning to the
people of Viet Nam.

In his major policy speech on
April 18, Mansfield said “it is
about time to dispense once and
for all -with glib assertions”
that the present war, if lost,
“will not be lost in Indochina,
but in the United States and,
more specifically, in Washing-
ton, and perhaps even in the
Senate of the United States.”
Declaring that “recent events
tell us that there is trouble in
Viet Nam . . . deeper and more
complex -than we have hereto-
fore been prepared to acknowl-
edge,” the Majority Leader
maintained that the future of
Viet Nam can be won or lost in

Archer V. P. lm¢t.—-President and Publisher.
Michael C. leesee-Edllu

in Viet Nam recently has pub-
lished a pamphlet entitled “The
Unspeakable War,” which
quotes several well-known labor
leaders who are critical of
America’s present course in
Viet Nam. Among them are
Patrick E. Gorman, secretary-
treasurer of the Amalgamated
Meat Cutters; Frank Rosen-
blum, general secretary-treas-
urer of the Amalgamated Cloth-
ing Workers; Emil Mazey, sec-
retary-treasurer of the United
Auto Workers; Harry Bridges,
president of the International
Longs.horemen’s and Ware-
housemen’s Union; and Leon
Davis, president of Local 1199,
Drug and Hospital Employees‘
Union.

Even industry-oriented sources
are beginning to reﬂect a more
questioning attitude to w a r d s
U. S. policy in Viet Nam. The
Wall Street Journal, for exam-
ple, speaks of the war as “a
persuasive illustration of the
dangers of military overexten-
sion.” Even more critical is an
editroial, reprinted below,
from a« recent issue of the

lication for the metals industry.

What we do know is that it's impossible for our newsmen

When Can" We Get Out?

It's becoming increasingly evident that a large number
of Americans aren't buying the State Department's “domino
theory” that says if we don't stop Communist troops in Viet

. Nam we’ll have to stop them in San Francisco.

Nor are they accepting at face value the glib asser- _
tion that if we get out of Viet Nam we'll lose face in the eyes

They're sick and tired of the waste of human life they
see in Viet Nam. And they want out.

This in spite of the fact that a war in Viet Nam, or for-@g
that matter anywhere else, is awfully good for business.

How do we know there is a growing disillusionment with .
our role in Viet Nam? For one thing plenty of people we talk
to say they'd like to get U. S. troops out of t -ere, but they
don't dare say so publicly for fear they'll be l'mped in with-
the student demonstrators and draft—card burners.

And these aren't peacetime patriots either. They're
people who want the U. S. to stand up for its rights and
protect its shores against Communism, but on a battleground
of its own choosing instead of 9. country where we probably
can't win a clear military victory nomatter how many troops

Most responsible people in the metal industry lived
through the horrors of World War II and the Hitler takeover
in Europe. They aren't about to call for unilateral disarma-
ment or head—in-the-sand withdrawal. —

But increasingly they're asking themselves when this
ungainly war will end, and how many American lives it will
take to end it—AND if it's all worth it anyway.

We have now entered a period of great internal up-
heaval in Viet Nam. How much of it is religious, how much
political. and how much inspired by the United States is

officials, has been repealed, one
of the issues is the question of
its constitutionality while it was
in effect. Even though the Sn-
preme Court found in 1950 this
provision to be constitutional, a
decision on a related matter last
year lends hope that the 1950

«-decision may be overruled.

A second issue concerns the
legal validity of the indictment
itself, while the third relates to
the refusal by the trial judge to
let the defense have the grand
jury testimony of prosecution

witnesses to be used for pur-'

poses of cross-examination.

Five Acquitted

Aside from the strictly legal
issues, the case makes very lit-
tle sense to "many who have
studied it. In addition to the fact
that the law on which it is based
was repealed in 1959, even be-
fore the first trial began, prac-
tically all of the evidence con-
cerns things alleged to have tak-
en place in 1949-17 long years
ago. Furthermore, five of the 11
defendants who originally stood
trial have been acquitted, either
by the trial court, the-Court of
Appeals, or the jury which sat
on the second trial in 1963.

Nine of 11 men who stood
trial in 1959 during the midst
‘of a bitter nationwide strike
against the country’s copper
producers were convicted, but
on appeal those convictions
were reversed for a new trial
becaus.e of prejudicial hearsay
testimony that had been al-
lowed, and the case against two
of the defendants was dismissed
entirely. One of the remaining
seven defendants was acquitted
on retrial in 1963.

Under Section 9(h) of Taft-
Hartley, a labor union was de-
nied the services of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board if
its officers did not file non-
Communist affidavits. The Mine-
Mill defendants sought to show
at the trials that the union’s
position on non-compliance with
the loyalty oath was the same
as that of other unions, but a
certified list compiled by the
NLRB showing when labor ‘or-
ganizations eventually complied
was not allowed to be intro-
duced.

Remaining defendants in the
case are A. C. Skinner, inter-
national president; Irving Dich-.
ter, secretary-treasurer‘; Ray-
mond Dennis, board member
for District 4; Charles Wilson,
international representative;
Harold Sanderson, administra-
tive assistant; and Maurice
Travis, former secretary-treas-
urer, who is no longer connected
with the union.

The defendants, who have re- ~

ceived impressive and broad
support throughout the country
in this case, need to win on only
one of the three issues. Victory
on either of the first two would
mean the outright dismissal of
the case. On the question of the
availability of the grand jury
testimony, victory could mean
dismissal or it could lead to the
ordering of a new trial, depend-
ing on how the court decides
the matter. Even if the court
should reverse for a new trial,
however, it doesn’t necessarily
mean_ that there would be one.

Peace Corps Seeks Many Skilled
. Workers for Training This Summer

The Peace Corps, which now has some 10,000 volunteers at work in 46 countries in'Africa, Asia,
and Latin America, has launched an all-out drive in search of additional skilled craftsmen for vol-

‘unteer service overseas.

Established by Congress on Sept. 22, 1961, the Peace Corps until this year has recruited its mem-
bers primarily from the ranks of college graduates. Because most of these volunteers have lacked
many of the technical and mechanical skills so badly needed abroad, hundreds of requests from

participating countries for the
American skilled worker have
gone unfilled.

Prior to his recent resignation
as Peace Corps director in order
to devote full time to his duties
as head of the War on Poverty
in the U. S., Sargent Shriver
noted that union volunteers-
“men and women of every age,

creasing numbers in the future.

ment.
Machinists Needed

Being s o u g h t particularly,
for training this summer, are
several hundred workers with
machinist or machinist-related

'experience—tool and die mak-

ers, welders, metal workers, au-
tomobile mechanics, etc. Some
dozen or more countries need
such volunteers, who would first
complete a training program of
12 or so weeks. ,
Welding instructors, machinist
instructors, and heavy equip-
ment mechanics, for example,
are needed in Ethiopia. India
needs machinists with plant su-
pervisory experience. Chile and
Bolivia have asked for diesel
and gasoline engine mechanics.
Any American citizen over 18
may apply for the Peace Corps.
There is no maximum age limit.
Married couples are welcomed
if both can serve as volunteers.
There are many positions for

wives based upon their experi- '

ence and homemaking abilities.
Such skills as sewing, food prep-
aration, health practices are
needed. Volunteers may not
have dependents under 18 years
of age.

Included in the intensive train-
ing to acquaint volunteers with
the host country and prepare
them for their work assignments
is language instruction where
required.

, Two-Year Tour

During the training period
and the overseas duty (totaling
about two years), the Peace
Corps pays expenses, which in-
clude travel, food, clothing,
housing, medical care, and in-
cidentals. A 45-day vacation
with expenses paid is provided.
Upon completion of service,
each volunteer receives an $1,800
readjustment allowance (before
taxes). A couple thus receives
$3,600 (before taxes).

Peace Corps selection is based
on merit alone. Selection is
made for individual projects,
with each having particular re-
quirements.

Other skil.ls needed by the
Peace Corps this year are those
of electricians, construction
workers, ~ masons, foundrymen
and blacksmiths, plumbers and
pipcfitters, carpenters and wood-
workers, surveyors, radio re-
pairmen, draftsmen, medical

Sunday, April _18 to 23, 1965.
Although the employees had
been paid double-time-and-la-half

day, April 18, Kennecott had re-
fused them time-and-a-half pay

taining that it was a scheduled

day off for the grievants.
Hildebrand’s ruling established
that either work on a scheduled
day off or work in excess of 40
hours in any week qualifies for

THE PHELPS DODGE PLANT IN EL PASO. TEXAS, represented by Mine-Mill's Local 501, the El Paso Copper Refinery
Workers Union, is a copper refinery and sulphate plant—one of two operated by PD. With a rated capacity of 300,000
tons, the property is the largest electrolytic copper refinery in the United States. The company recently announced that
two new vertical—type furnaces will be installed at El Paso after a try—out at its other refinery in Laurel Hill, N. Y.

Talc,-ing Use in Desalination
V Ayhuge new market for cupro--nickel tubing is seen in the
dev'eloping water desalting program being pushed in the United
States. Over the years, the cost of desalting water has been
reduced from an original $4 to $5 per thousand gallons to about
$1 or less. The average co-st of delivered water in the U.S. today
' is about '42 cents per thousand gallons and desalination engineers
-are hoping ultimately to be able to produce salt-free water at 20
cents.

The US. need is anticipated at 400 billion gallons a day for
industrial use alone by 1980. Current use is about 200 billion
gallons. ,

Various methods of recovery have been developed; the most
promising one so far is the ﬂash distillation system which requires
the use of heat exchange tubes. The tubes are composed of 70 per-
cent copper and 30 percent nickel. For each plant turning out 500
million gallons daily, about 12 million pounds of heat exchange
tubes are required.

Estimated cost of bringing the mine into production runs about

tion. This cost will later be refunded by the Peruvian government.
The mine’s isolation means that a 60~mile-long access road, follow-

plete townsite facilities for employees and their families.

Lead Consumption Up

The 1965 increase in lead consumption reported by the U. S.
Bureau of Mines is laid to the increased use of lead in batteries
and antiknock gas compounds, increased ammunition requirements
in Viet Nam, and greater lead pigment demand. Although 1965
consumption rose 30,000 tons higher than the 1,200,000 figure of
1964, recoverable production plus imports fell short. The result
was a decline in stocks and a six percent drop in primarynrefinery

output. * * *

Irish Operation Set for 1971 Opening

Irish Base Metals Ltd., subsidiary of the Canadian Northgate

mine in 1971. Although primarily a lead-zinc facility, the mine
also shows silver and copper. It will be mined initially as an open
pit, but will gradually shift to an underground operation.

The concentrator has a rated capacity of 2,000 tons of ore per
day and its output will be trucked 35 miles to Ga-lway for ocean
shipment to European ports... The closeness of Galway to European
markets will make possible ‘a saving of $3 to $5 a ton in shipping
costs.

U.S. Producers    

Unhappy Over
Price of Copper

(Continued from Page 1)

in their dissatisfaction. Ana-
conda and Phelps Dodge have
both expressed this publicly, al-
though a K e n n e c o tt official
thinks the 36-cent price will hold
for some time.

Complicated Situation

Chile’s action in kicking off
the price jump has been criti-
cized as extravagant, irrespon-_
sible, and politically motivated.‘
However, the price situation is
complex and involves several
factors.

To begin with there is a
worldwde physical shortage of
copper.

In the United States, there is
a sharply rising demand for
copper and copper products re-
sulting from the requirements
of the Viet Nam war and ris-
ing auto production. Even in the
face of three releases from the
national stockpile in the past 12
months, for a to-tal of 618,000
tons of copper, the market has
been extremely tight, Inflated
dealers and scrap prices have
been the result.

Chile’s copper production was
reduced drastically as a re-
sult of an 87-day strike at Ken-
necott’s Braden operation, just
settled, and a 38-day shutdown
of all major copper operations
in October and November of
1965. Too, Chile has long felt it
should be independent of the
price structure set by British,
U. S. and African producers.

Once before, in 1953-54, it tried," ,

to set its own higher price.
Having failed then, it has now
seized the opportunity offered
by the current world shortage
to make what it calls a ‘fdrastic
correction” in the price of
Chilean copper.

Zambian copper production is
in a very touchy position. It
depends on power and coal sup-
plies controlled by Rhodesia,
whose white - minority break-
away government is in a show-
down with most of the inde-
pendent African nations and the
British Commonwealth. Should
Zambian production be inter-
rupted, it would mean a cutoff of
16 percent of the copper avail-
able to the west.

Producers‘ Dilemma

So far as the United States
price is concerned, producers
are feeling the effect of two
pressures. One is the desire to
get on the gravy train—to pick
up the profits that would re-
sult from an increase in price.
The other is fear of the effect
of higher prices on copper
users. There has already been
some shift to aluminum and
plastics by some copper con-
sumers, and the industry is
anxious not to- be confronted
with a flood of substitution.

The Mining Journal of London
regards substitution as “a very
major threat” and says, “In
1968 approximately one-third of
B.I.C.C.’s British wire and
cable business will be based
upon aluminum.” And The
Northern Miner, a Canadian
trade paper, says,_ “By fa!‘ the
greatest concern in copper In-
dustry circles at this time lS
substitution. Many 055013.18 be-
lieve the switch is already pro-
nounced in the electrical field
and in certain types of pipe and
tube products. In the U. ._S.,
plastic is being used in making
drainage, waste, vent and
plumbing tube, formerly the €X~
clusive domain of copper.”

The latest word, as this is_
written, is that the White House
has let’ it be known, according
to the American Metal Market,
major U- S_. trade. Paper, that '
“it would frown ‘upon any bike 6

- in domestic‘ copper prices dur-

ing_:thegnex_t six monthﬁ.” —_ A ’

U.S. Bureau of Mines Supports Skinner's Charge
On Company Permisson for Accident-lnvesligalion

‘ Mine-Mill President A. C. Skinner at the hearing on mine safety before the Senate Labor Sub-
committee on March 21 charged that, since the expiration of the Mine Safety Study Act in the fall of
1963, some miningcompanies have refused permission for investigation of fatal accidents by the U.S.
.. Bureau of Mines. Those who do grant permission to investigate fatalities, he said, “may have been
mindful of the unfavorable public image that results from refusal of permission to get at the facts
V surrounding fatalities.”
_ ’ He cited as reasons for company refusal to permit investigation the Bureau’s practice of mak-

’ ing investigative reports available to union representatives and the authoritative support such. such
’ reports provide for union demands for correction of safety hazards.

Subcommittee Counsel John Bruff requestcdthe Interior Department to furnish particulars,re-

garding any such refusals.

The Interior Department furnished‘a list of fatal accidents since expiration of the Mine Safety

lowing list, which appears in

g the printed record of the hear-

ings, gives the dates of fatal ac-

refused to permit investigation by the Bureau of Mines. The fol-

“normal” incidence of lung can-

trations underground uranium
miners had had up to 40 times
the expected normal frequency
of lung cancers. He said, in the
third quarter of 1964, 40 per-
cent of all uranium miners in
the five states worked in “safe”
concentrations of one working
level, but that in the same peri-
od in 1965 this percentage had
fallen to 22. ,
M'mers working in concentra-
tions of gas likely to produce
an above-normal rate of lung
cancer increased in 1965 to 78
percent, compared with 60 per-
centof all miners working un-
derground in 1964. g ,
' The Public Health official said
he could not explain the upswing
in the numb-er of miners work-
ing in dangerous concentrations
of gas. He did say that ,“as
mines become deeper” and “as
the small mines re-enter” ura-
nium production, the control
problems become more difficult.
According to tables prepared
by the U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice and introduced by another
witness, the most widespread
increases in exposures to dan-
gerous concentrations of radon
gas occurred in’Colorado' and
New Mexicouranium mines.

In addition, others will be in-
jured, crippled, or maimed in

occupational diseases as sili-
cosis or lung cancer, brought
on "by inhaling dusty and radio-
active air in mines.

“Hearings in the other body
include evidence that under-
ground mineral mining is one
of the two most hazardous oc-
cupations in the United States.”

Senator Joseph M. Montoya
( D-N.M.l

“Mr. Chairman,‘ I submit that
the record of the States in the
inspection of, mines and quar-
ries, and in the investigation of
lost-time accidents in this in-
dustry, is not one to instill confi-
dence among the men whose
lives and health we are attempt-
ing to safeguard.

“The record is filled with ex-
amples of faulty or nonexistent.
State inspection of hazardous
conditions. Too many State in-
spectors are either untrained or
are too subject to the influence
of mineowners.”

Joseph D. Keenan. V A

“The ‘several S t a t e s have

failed to enact systems of in- ,

spection and mine safety codes
that adequately assure protec-
tion to the miners who work in

“In summary, the Mine Safety
Board study showed a fatality
rate of more than 200 per year
in metal and nonmetallic mining
——and milling—industries, and
causing approximately 10,000
nonfatal injuries per year, in-
cluding permanently disabling
injuries. In addition, inspectors
from the U.S. Bureau of Mines
found, on the average, 15 cor-
rectable hazards in each mine,
hazards menacing the life and
safety of the mineworker dur-
ing the period of the mine
study.” -

Senator Robert F. Kennedy
(D-N.Y.)

“I believe that a uniform
safety and health code estab-
lished and enforced by the Bu-
reau of Mines is preferable to
this State option included in
section 13 of HR 8989. For the
record of State enforcement of
safety regulations has not been
a good one. And the difficulties
in- enforcing safety regulations
are complicated when there are
different standards and varying
levels of enforcement from
State to State.”
