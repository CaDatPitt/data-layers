 SEVERAL OTHER develop-
3 "ments in connection with the
wtrial made,-news here during
jtthe week prior to the post-
, ' ponement announcement.
 "Board Member Alton Law-
 -pence moved to sever his case
gfrom the restof the defenants.
“I-Iis ‘motion; ' contended that
-,-rfpublicity about the fact that
7._.,I'ie’,‘ . -a White -man, was -be-

 

ing tried in the same court
along with fellow union offi-
cer Asbury Howard, a Negro,
would create such bad public
reaction in their home town of
Bessemer, Alabama, as to en-
danger the health and life of
Lawrence’s family.

When Judge Arraj denied
the motion, Lawrence entered
a plea o “nolo contendere,”
neither admitting nor denying
the charge. against him, but
leaving. him subject to the
same possible punishment as
if he had pleaded guilty. In

accepting the “nolo” plea, the

judge said he would hold up
sentencing Lawrence until
after the trial of the other 13
defendants is completed.
Following his “nolo” plea,
Lawrence resigned as Board
member for District 5. (See
Board statement on Page 4.)

Judge Arraj, meanwhile, de-

nied two other motions for sev-
erance filed by the defense at-
torneys. These asked that the
case of the defendants other
than ‘former Secretary-Treas-
urer M. E. Travis be tried sep-
arately, and that the trial of
Travis by himself be delayed
because publicity about his
two previous trials on false
affidavit charges in Denver
would be prejudicial to a fair
trial.

On Oct. 26, Graham Dolan,
one of the defendants, an-
nounced his resignation as un-
ion publicity director and as-
sistant editor of the Mine-Mill
Union, effective with this -is-

_ sue of the paper.

THE HEART of the indict-
ment against the Mine-Mill
men is that they engaged in
a “conspiracy,” beginning in
1949 to obtain compliance ' on

TRIAL OPENS NOV. 2—Thirteen past and present officers and staff mem-
bers of Mine-Mill were to go on trial in Denver's U. S. District Court
on charges, of “conspiring to defraud" the government in connection
with the signing of Taft-Hartley affidavits. Seated, left to right, are
Albert Pezzuti. former secretary-treasurer, who is no longer with the

union; Vice-President Asbury. Howard; Board Members Al Skinner and
Chase Powers; International Representative Jesse Van Camp, and Secre-

behalf of the union with the
Taft-Hartley Law requirements
that elected officials must file
affidavits swearing that they
are not communists. The in-
dictment charges that during
each of the years. from 1949
to 1955, one or more of the de-
fendants filed false affidavits
with the National Labor Re-
lations boardand that this was
part of the conspiracy. The in-
dictment was handed up in

i 1956. It was in 1949 that Mine-

Mill first complied with Taft-
Hartley. Non-communist affi-
davits are no longer required
by law. Yet, in late 1959, the
prosecution insists on bring-
ing the Mine-Mill men to trial.

Puzzling to Mine-Mill mem-
bers is this: If there were
proof that any particular de-
fendant filed a false non-com-
munist affidavit, he could have

Clark fo Address
ADA in Tucson

The Pima county chapter of
Americans for Democratic Ac-
tion has invited Mine-Mill Pres-
ident John Clark to be the fea-
tured speaker at a special
meeting the organization wants
to set up for the union leader
in Tucson, Arizona. ADA is
representative of a more lib-
eral group in the Democratic
party, and lists among its na-
tional leaders such prominent
individuals as Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Senator H u b e r t
Humphrey of Minnesota and
President Walter Reuther of
the United Auto Workers.

George J. Papcun, writing
for the executive board of the
Pima county ADA chapter, ad-
vised Clark that the Tucson
area group was interested in
having him speak at “a meet-
ing to support the action of
the copper miners in their
strike against the copper com-
panies.” - ‘~E

Check fo Sfrikéfrs

The following note accompa-
nied a $5 check received by the
International office last month:

“Here is five bucks for the
Mine-Mill strikers. I’m sure
they’ll be able to use it even
though it is from an AFL-CIO
shop steward. The‘ average
rank-and-filer is with the Mine-
Mill copper strikers and knows
they’ll win in the end_in spite
of the profit-bloated copper
bosses. I’m sure the company
brass can't be happy when
they look out the window and
see the workers, thousands
strong, from coast to coast as
one.

“This strike is hard on the
poor old boss; his big profits
of ’59 ‘ain’t rolling in anymore.
He can live off the gravy for
a while, but if he wants to roll
in the gold again he’ll have to
get the workers back on the
job. . . and with a pay in-
crease, of course.

ls::_Kaiser Contract First
s,-Brpeak in Steel Strike

  The first break in the long steel strike came with the sign-
'7 ing of a contract between Kaiser Steel corporation and the
-Steelworkers Union on Oct. 26. The ‘contract, according to
est-imates of both parties, provides wages and other benefits
:costing'191A-2 cents over the period from Nov. 1 of this year to
In addition, a limited escalator clause could
ft'irthe‘r‘raise wages up to a maximum of 3 cents per hour

Starting Nov. 1, the company will absorb the full cost of
insurance and medical programs; this, in effect, will be equal to

.a_‘ pay raise of 7 cents per hour. In «addition, pension improve-
ments, valued at 2%. cents per hour, will: raise benefits for serv-
Iiée prior to Nov. 1, 1959, to $2.50 per year (now $2.40) and for
":"future_' service to $2.60. ‘The years for which pension credits

may be: accumulated has been extended from 30 to 40'years.
'  Effective July 1, 1960,; wages will be‘ increased by an average
of 8% cents—~7 cents for the lowest paid job and 1% cents for

~ increasing the spread between grades.

An additional cent will

, -be required for additional overtime and incentive pay, making

_ Some important grievances
involving improper job assign-

grievances were resolved with
the company paying the dif-

BUTTE, Mont. —- A union-
sought injunction directing the
Anaconda company to rein-
state hospital and doctor care
contracts covering Mine-Mill
members on strike against the
company was issued by the
District court here October 20.

Judge J. B. McClernan
signed the order‘ ruling gen-
erally in favor of the Montana
Mine-Mill J oi n t ‘ Negotiating
committee which started the
court action Oct. 1 after the
company had announced ter-
mination of the hospital con-
tracts on Sept. 30.

* It *

THE COURT ORDER di-
rected the issuance of an in-
junction requiring; the Ana-
conda company “to reinstate
and revive all "hospitalization
services for the members of
said IUMM&SW.” Hospitals in
Butte,
Falls are involved.

In District court hearings
held Oct. 7 and 9, Mine-Mill
argued that the hospital con-
tracts have been in effect for
more than 50 years in some
cases, and that union members
have paid a stipulated and
fixed consideration for hospi-
tal contract coverage.

The union charged in its
complaint that the company
committed a “breach of obliga-
tion” by terminating the con-

tracts without sufficient notice.

REPORTING on union de-
fense as related to the indict-
ment of the 14, Clark said it
was a diabolical attack in which
the prosecution has to use
“despicable stoolpigeons” of a
breed never seen before. He
referred to District 2 Board
member Al Skinner, Vice-Pres-
ident Asbury Howard and staff

members‘. Charlie Wilson; and
Jack. Marcotti as a» cross-see
tion of those indicted, {adding
that in his opinion these men
are guilty of nothing and have
nothing of which to be
ashamed; but “can walk with
their chins up and eyes straight
forward.”  -

The delegates responded to
Clark’s call for defense fund
support by unanimously mov-
ing to recommend “that all 10-
cal unions set up defense com-
mittees within their frame-
work.”

The Mine-Mill president’s
talk centered mainly on the
union’s copper strike inwhich
nearly all the locals represent-
ed at the meeting are involved,
recent settlements in related
sections of the industry, the
solid spirit of the member-
ship manning the picket lines,

and E growing ‘in support ‘for, the

- strike. , He cheered. the , dele-

HE power of the U. S. government is being

many years that the government should not

For many months in advance, they produced at

TVTACOMA, Wash.—Mine-Mill last month won full and complete reinstatement to

job for Local 25 member Victor Ellison whose discharge along with eight» other

‘Ellison will return to work when the current Mine-Mill strike at AS&R plants

rules not in the contract. Seven
of the nine dischargees made
up Local: 25’s top bargaining
and grievance committee.

*_ .=l= =1:

THE LAST SIX ‘WEEKS of
the lockout were carried on
under one ._of the most far-
reaching court injunctions in
recent times. Board Member
Powers said at the time of the
settlement: “This is probably

the. first time in the annals of,

labor » where a company _ se-

cured .an injuncti_o_n in orderto
. force ,the ,,men', back_ to w,or‘k f

under its terms,_ that six weeks
later they had "to dissolve the
injunction in order to get the

 men back* to work as -free

men.” ‘ .
Besides lifting of the injunc-

cluded reinstatement of the
seven top local leaders, rein-

. ,st_a_tement ,of. persons removed
from u1e‘1ay-on list, the dump-

ing into the waste basket of
the hundreds of disciplinary
slips, and the dropping of the
company’s damage suit against
the union.

Of AS&R’s refusal to rein-
state Ellison and Tisdale
at the time as part of the set-
tlement, Powers said: “The
company held this out as the
pound offlesh they wanted to

"extract, and ‘rather than con-

tinue the 94-day lookout for
800 men, the union agreed to
take these two cases to arbi-
tration with the feeling that
they could be won.”

to justify 'Ellison’s discharge
on thebasis of his back work
record rather than for his par-

-ticipation in a stop-work meet-

ing involving 368 men on the

pany’s head personnel man
was asked on the witness
stand if Ellison would have
been fired if he hadn’t attend-
ed the meeting, he answered:

action of its own to eliminate
racial barriers in affiliated
“Time for Jim Crow

Noting that a resolution to

BUTTE COPPER AND ZINC COMPANY, owner of . the ,

planning a merger with an eastern dressmaking concern. Main ‘
reason for this odd combination seems to be that the dress-
maker, Jonathan Logan, Inc., could thereby more easily win ~
approval for listing of its stock on New York Stock Exchange, ‘
since the merged firm would have more than the number of:_‘‘

"'4that charge. But there have
been no such individual indict-
ments, except in the case of

- M. E. Travis, former secretary-
’ treasurer. After a second trial,
" his case is now on appeal to
 the Supreme Court of the Unit-
? -ed ‘States.

_ Supporting Mine-Mill’s con-
/tention that the indictment is
W ‘a hangover from the past and
 has no. relation to_ current real-

‘"_ity’, is the fact that if any of
, the affidavits which were filed
" tin the earlier years were false,
 it was not open to the govern-
,ment- ‘to secure indictments
against the individuals in No-
. velglber, 1956, because the
‘ statute of limitations would
, have made prosecution impos-
A-.7-sgible. By obtaining the con-
.‘ spiracy - indictment, the gov-

' ernment can try to bring these
.-;_~_ea\rlier affidavits into the case

 theyfwere filed as a part of a
(single conspiracy from 1949

New Type of Adult Western ‘

As any television viewer knows, TV screens these days are
occupied mostly by so-called “adult western” stories about the
good guys and the bad guys.

Striking Mine-Mill local unions in the west know a good
thing when they see it. Television viewers in such widely-

._separated western towns as Salt Lake City, Utah; Ely, «Nev.;

Butte, Mont., and Tucson, Ariz., and surrounding areas, have
been seeing a new type of “adult western” during the current
copper strike. Mine-Mill has been sponsoring television pro-
grams to bring the issues of the strike to the general public.

The “good guys,” of course, are the striking copper workers.
Obviously, the “bad guys” are the struck companies. As for a
happy ending,’ the hallmark of all western television shows,
that will have to wait until Mine-Mill's strikers reach agree-
ment with the industry. Ask any striker whether he’ll take a
cheap . settlement and, like the western hero, he’ll answer,
“nope.”

It appears that Mine-Mill members have a hankerin’ for a
decent standard of living and no polecat’s going to hornswoggle
them. “

the company was hemmed in
with a -series of “blockbuster”
qualifications, branded by the
committee as “provisions that
would seriously weaken the
jobsecurity of the miners and
smeltermen and deprive them
of previously-won contract
provisions.” All of the pro-
visions were in the category
of the phony. “management’s
rights” binge which began
with the steel industry's posi-

a package proposal containing
a five-cent wage increase offer.

The union committee report-

on Oct. 14 and 15 to discuss

non-economic issues; “A f t e r ‘

two daysyof frank discussions,”
the report said, “spokesmen
from Kennecott said, ‘We will
draft proposals along the lines
of our discussions as soon as

possible and meet and present’

them to you next week.’ Fri-
day, Oct. 16, Kennecott called-

further meetings on the non-
economic matters, but also
cancelled a scheduled meeting
on health and welfare which
had been set up for Oct. 21.

IN THE AMERICAN Smelt- _

ing and Refining strike, Secre-
tary-Treasurer Irving Dichter,
the union’s AS&R co-ordinator,
announced that negotiations
between the union and the
company would be resumed on
Nov. 3 in Denver. The negotia-
tions will be the first to be

-held between the union and

AS&R since the strike began
in August. Dichter\_said the

entire AS&R Council negotiat-

ing committee has been called
to Denver for the talks.

Bargaining motion is still
absent in the Phelps Dodge
strike in Arizona, Texas, and
California. Mine-Mill locals in
Bisbee, Douglas, Morenci, El
Paso, and Los Angeles all have
been carrying on intensified
and diversified strike activity.
In Morenci, for example, one
striker is giving haircuts in
the union hall. Another is op-
erating a shoe repair shop. An
entertainment committee is
holding bingo parties, with
prizes donated by local mer-
chants. Even pickets on duty
were able to play bingo
through the use of a telephone
connection. A strike kitchen
is in full swing. Similar activi-
ties are being conducted in
practically every striking un-
ion. i
