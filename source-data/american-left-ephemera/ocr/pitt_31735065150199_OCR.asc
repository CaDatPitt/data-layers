. ,..DENVER—Although ov-
'ershadowed in the news by
strike developments in the
major chains from coast to
coast, several important
contract settlements have been
reached by Mine-Mill in re-
.lated sections of the non-fer-
rous metals industry since the
' end of August saw production
by Kennecott, Magma-San
Manuel, Anaconda, Phelps
Dodge and AS&R. brought to

from Arizona, New Mexico,

covered by reports and discus-

the meeting time.
ADDITIONAL importance
was lent the deliberations by
the attendance of International
Vice Presidents Orville Lar-

retary-Treasurer Irving Dich-
ter and General Counsel Na-

dressed the meeting. District

also reported on over-all ac-
tivities in the various locali-
ties as well as on general
strike developments. '
Chairman Juan Aranda Jr.

Locals Solid;
Revive Talks
In Kennecott

DENVER — Mine - Millfs
copper strike, which began
on August 10 in the-Kenné-
cott chain and by August
20 in the rest of the indus-
try, reached the stage last
month where employers were
beginning to learn that 35,000
idled workers did not intefnd
to be bulldozed, enjoined, ldr
soft-talked into acceptance or
inferior settlements. ’

September saw Kennecott’s
management deliberately pro-
voking situations with the aim
of winning legal injunctions
against the strikers. The com-
pany was yelling for the law
at every sign of increased
worker solidarity.’ Similar le-
gal shenanigans were invoked
by American Smelting and Re-
fining and the San Manuel,
Copper company. 

AS&R was reduced to bush-

"league labor" relations When it

attempted to demoralize its
striking workers by cancelling
all insurance coverage. Secre-
tary-Treasurer Irving Dichter
said the company’s action only
angered the workers and
strengthened their unity. The
AS&R Council, meanwhile,‘ ar-
ranged for life insurance cov-'
erage at a cost of a dollar per
member per month for $1,000
insurance. ' '- .
ANACONDA COMPANY:
borrowed from an old bag of
tricks by trying to foment
back-to-Work movements. The’
attempts failed because of the
transparent nonsense in. the
company’s position. On the
one hand it was planting pro-L
paganda in the press that the
Anaconda workers should re-
turn to work and let the strik-
ers in the rest of the industry.
establish a pattern which would
then be handed to Anaconda
employees on a platter. On
the other hand, the -company‘
was maintaining it was not_
going to be able to settle for»
the same pattern agreed upon
in the rest of the industry
some day in the future. '

ALTHOUGH the conference

Paso, Local 903 settled on a
two-year package valued at 27
‘cents per hour plus a_numbeI‘
of other contract improve-
ments. Wage gains the first

ical plan under health and wel-
fare benefits; improved vaca-
tions including three weeks for

Royster Guano

An attempt by local manage-
ment at Royster Guano com-
pany in Macon, Ga., to deny
workers pay for holidays

_which occurred on Saturday

was blocked when Local 838
grievancemen took the issue to
the company’s main office.
The union contract calls both
for six paid holidays and five
working days Monday through
Friday. This year July 4 and
Memorial day fell on Saturday,
and a new local management
claimed the workers did not
lose any time and therefore
were not entitled to pay for
the two holidays. A union re-

quest b r o u g h t top manage-

ment down from the main
office and the grievances were
settled with all the workers
getting their holiday pay for
the two days.

Housing Post

The Citizens Action Council
for the Improvement of Stam-
ford, Conn., last month ap-
proved the appointment of the
Rev. Edward H. Coleman,
Mine-Mill international repre-
sentative, to its newly organ-
ized Housing committee.
Members of the recently-
formed CAC include local in-
dustrialists, utility company
executives, bankers and a
lawyer. The 6-man housing
committee is headed by Troy
Westmeyer, a New York Uni-
versity research professor.

Red Cross Nod

Local 531 at Harbison-Walker
company in Bessemer, Ala.,
has received a Red Cross award
for its outstanding work in the
blood bank program. Of 126
members, 96 donors gave 96
pints of blood. Only 24 pints
were received by the Red
Cross from all other company
employees in the area includ-
ing sales, clerical and super-
visory personnel.

 _ DENVER——Fourteen past and present officers and
 staff members of the International Union of Mine, Mill

  S. District court here. They are charged with partici-

pating in a “conspiracy to defraud the government” in

i..-comp]-iance with the Taft-

_ Based on an indictment

.. on November 16, 1956, the case
 ..,-has been awaiting trial ever

 /m§iss’was‘based on legal argu-
 ments,‘ derived from several

 heart of the indictment
 /against the 14 men is that they
engagedtin a “conspiracy,” be-
,,ginning in 1949, to obtain com-
" pliance by Mine-Mill with the

  
  
 
 
   
 
  

 ‘non-Communist affidavit pro-
 ’fV?iSif9ns of the Taft-I-.Ia=r-tleyvact.

 

_ \> the enactment of the
 ‘Isandrurm-Griffin -biilrl, the affi-
jf Wdavit provision of Taft-‘Hartley
 ‘has, -been eliminated. In =ef:fect,
 this means the 14 menwi-ll be
 tried on charges of conspiring
 to ‘-defraud the government

‘ lan,

through an action that is no
longer illegal.

ONE OF THE CONTRA-
DICTIONS of the indictment
is that if there were proof
that any particular defendant
filed a false affidavit, he
could have been indicted indi-
vidually for the alleged crime
of filing a false affidavit.
There have been no individual
indictments, except in the case
of former Secretary-Treasurer
Travis. After a second trial,
his case is being appealed to
the Supreme Court of the
United States. Aside from
Travis, the “conspiracy” in-
dictment alleges -that nine of
the other defendants also filed
one or more false affidavits,
beginning in 1949, ten years
ago. None of the nine has
been indicted individually for
filing a false affidavit. Four
of the defendants, -S-kinner, Do-
Durkin, and Sanderson,
did not file affidavits, but are
named as parties to the so-
called “conspiracy.” Sk—inner’s
affidavits since being elected
board member in District 2
are -not -part of his indictment.

The October 26 trial is
scheduled to be held before
U. S. District Judge Alfred
Arraj, who has been assigned
to the case since an illness of
Judge Lee Knous. Members
of the defense counsel will be
Nathan Witt, New York, Mine-
Mill general -counsel; Telford
T a ylo-r, New York, retired
brigadier general and famed
prosecutor -of Nazi war crimi-
nals, and George Fr an ci s,
Denver. _ .

The trial of the 14 men is
expected t'o'last three or -fo-ur

‘months. ‘The International Ex-
- ecut-ive board is ulrgin-g all lo-

cal unions to step up their
fund-raising activities for the

“Landrum-Griffin’ Congress

WASHINGTON, D. 'C.—-The first session of the 86th Congress, longest since th  9

days of the Korean war, finally ground to a halt in the early hours of the morningof , 

September 15.

High on sound‘ and fury, actually it passed only two outstanding pieces of legis_la- I
tion. One was the admittance to statehood of Hawaii, certainly a progressive liberal ‘

act, but the other was pas-
sage of the labor-shackling
Landrum-Griffin bill.

The rest '-of the time, Con-
gress en-gageid irn -drawn-out
debate over fiscal policy and
international ‘aid of various
forms.

Most of the time, a running
battle ensued between the
President and Congress, with
the President victorious in
every case but one.

WHAT HAD APPEARED
as high hopes for a strong
liberal Congress, evaporated
almost in the first month of
the 86th Congress’ operations.
The two to one Senate and
House Democratic majorities
were actually paper majori-
ties, more. fancied than real.
When it came down to brass
tacks on a progressive-liberal
issue, usually the majority
went to a_ conservative coali-
tion of northern Republicans
and southern Democrats.

So, down the drain went
Federal aid to education,
strong civil rights legislation,
a major housing bill, and de-
pressed area ‘legislation. Also
lost, was a new minimum
wage bill. Since civil rights
legislation was stymied, the
day was somewhat saved by
continuing the life of the Civil
Rights commission for another
period. Even this was done by
attaching the commission’s

authority to exist onto another

‘bill.

In some areas, like airport
construction, corporate excise
taxes, and highway financing,
Where an additional cent-per-
gallon increase was made,
some agreement between the
President and Congress al-
lowed for passage of these
measures.

IT TOOKQ THREE TRIES
for Congress to get a housing
bill through. And one that was
far less liberal than the bill
originally passed under the
sponsorship of the Democratic
leadership of Congress.

As usual, a lot of legislation
died by default. In many
cases, this was to the good.
The House took action on
many bills designed to in-
crease so-called “security.” But
the Senate took no action on
-these security bil-ls, although
the threat of such legislation
will remain real in the next
session.

BUT WORKING MEN for
years to come will have a spe-
cial reason for remembering
the first session of the 86th
Congress. The Landrum-Grif-
fin law is by far the most se-
vere labor bill enacted in the

history of our democratic gov- ,

ernment. Somehow when it
came to cracking down on la-
bor, a new unity was found.

forces with :conservative-Dem.- ~ ~

ocrats and Republicans.
Spurred by one of the slickes-t

jobs ever executed by big. - I
corporations and the NAM and 
Chamber of Commerce,‘ ?'t~his‘ ,
bill was pushed through Con- »
gress “with almost ram-rod ac ,

tion. ,-
Looking back, there can be

no doubt now that the results.

"The administration, both  -
through the President and the 
Secretary of Labor, joined“ -—

of the mid-term 1958 Congres- » it

sional elections lulled ‘most of
labor into false security. La-
bor’s “Congressional friends”
just didn’t deliver ,the goods
they promised. Where early as-

surances had been made -that 79

at w o r s t “mild” legislation

would be enacted and directed a

only at the “crooks,” actually

the reverse ‘took place. A se-:.;
vere labor-restricting measure, ~

was passed with very little“di‘-
rected toward the crooks. Even

these provisions d i r e c t ed ‘-
against racketeers are of ques- - -'
tionable constitutionality, ac- T 9

cording to many experts. "

Anti-labor f o r c e s scored A V‘ in

heavily in this session of the —

Congress. But how far laborbri
will recoup will depend -on -

united Labor action, in the '

1960 elections. This time it -is  ~

-hoped -that labor will insist up-

on more -than promis‘es.—-

 I HE GREATEST .HOAX perpetrated on the

_. American labor movement was passed in
Congress this year in the shape of the Lan-
drum-Griffin bill. If there ever was a piece _of
class legislation passed this was it-—us1ng in-

<;,’: ’ vestigations into corruption,

 solely in labor unions, to

- legislate away the democ-
racy of American labor
unions.

I say “class legislation”

, 4 with a clear intent. In my

 T report to the last Mine-mill
C “ convention I called the at-

tention of the delegates to
corruption on the other side
o_f the .track—reports from
‘ the Federal Trade commis-
_sion showing the prime offenders to be well-
known names in industry and finance. In ad-
dition, ‘-government figures show more than a
million dollars embezzled by bankers every
year. The Association of Better Business Bu-
reaus reports that 41 insurance companies
* practice unfair and deceptive advertising, and
I that six leading insurance firms “have been
.  mulcting policy holders” to the tune of 25 mil-
‘ lion dollars a year.
- Digging deeper into the dirt, the House
' , Government Operations subcommittee revealed
.' '5 that -Americans are being gyped out of 100
__ ‘A million dollars a year by phoney reducing prep-
  .arations. Just a little deeper—according to the
 V Catholic paper, “The Labor Leader,” $5 billion
 changes hands yearly in kick-backs, payoffs
‘;;z . and bribes. Investors were fleeced at the rate
 ' of 16 million dollars a month in 1957.

~; IFE MAGAZINE went into this sordid pic-
 ture a little more——the use of prostitutes
by’ .-big business to lure trade. Also, it is esti-
; ‘ mated that $250 million was deducted by em-
‘ 1 ployers for withholding taxes but never was
 -_ turned over to the treasury, and $750 million
1; . -was filched from the sympathizing public in
  charity rackets. Then there have been exposed
 -"the wave ofunethical practices in the medical

’ 4' - profession; fee splitting, bill padding, etc.
9 We‘-can still dig deeper but to what avail?

7 We are now in the process of breaking down
the articles in the labor control bill that will be
operative against our union, both nationally
andfor local unions. It appears on the face of
it that we will still continue to be at the mercy
of. the lawyers and arbitration boards. And
added to this will be the extra costs to both
 large and small locals of the expert advice and

WHEN BIG CORPORATIONS refused to bargain with unions back in the
days before Taft-Hartley, ldndrum-Griffin, and weak-kneed Congresses,
they got more than a mild slap on the wrist from the United States
Government. This historic photo, taken in April, 1944, shows soldiers
carrying Board Chairman Sewell Avery o-ut of his Montgomery-Ward
office in Chicago. The muilorder house was seized by President Roose-
velt when it refused to abide by a government order to bargain with
n CIO union. Ten years later, the union won a quarter of a million
dollars in damages. Such were “management -rights” in 1944.

Federal Report Cites
Asbury Howard Case

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The U. S. Civil Rights com-
mission Sept. 8 prominently cited the Asbury Howard case
as a clear» example of anti-Negro discrimination in r_egis- <

The concluding section _ on Alabama of the commis-
.sio'n’s 500-page report to..,President Eisenhower and Con- -
. gress was devoted. to a detailed account of the" Mine-Mill
rzvice president’s arrest, beating and jailing on a Bessemer
V work gang. for ordering, in his capacity as president of
V the Bessemer Voters; league, a sign painted advocating the
- right of‘Negroes to register and vote. . ~

» A ‘ Five members of the six-man commission approved
a. recommendation that federal voting registrars be used-
where necessary to assure Negroes the right to vote. ~“It
has become apparent,” the commission report said, “that
. legislation presently on the books is inadequateto assure
that all our qualified citizens shall enjoy the right to vote.”
The report was based on studies and investigations by-<<
the commission since January of 1958, including a hearing
last December in Montgomery on complaints received from
six Alabama counties charging denial of the right to vote

Winding up its summary of facts about voting condi-
tions in that state, the commission report declared:

“The facts about voting in some parts of Alabama
which were brought out- at the commission’s December
hearing only hardened the determination of some Alabama
citizens to bar Negroes from the voting booths. If this
was not made clear by the passage of the (state) bill
permitting the destruction of registration applications,-
then a development in Bessemer, near Birmingham, left

2 Conventions 

HILE the AFL-CIO was meeting in sari
Francisco, I was attending the 11th An-

nual convention of the Canadian section of “
Mine-Mill. I couldn’t help but contrast the"de-

wholesome atmosphere of our Canadian con-_ ‘
vention. There were sharp differences of opin-
ion among our Canadian brothers on basi(;,,
policy matters, but they were resolved by ii ’
sive basis. 

By all reports the San- Francisco conve
tion was a rather dismal affair. The delegaw;
were appalled and depressed by the passage’ ' 
the Landrum-Griffin Bill. . They were blanﬁng
each other and the Teamsters for passage of ,
the bill. The debate on the elimination of. 

, Grow in two of the federation’s affiliates turned « 

into an‘ attack against those who were chain-T

pioning the cause of equality. The only gseemi 

ingly positive action taken by the convention» __
was insupport of the steel strike. ‘  "1 
But the purpose of this column is not to rub -- ,5!-
salt into the wounds of the AFL-CIO.» Their
problems are our problems. It is rather to 
point out that we can learn some lessons fro_m_;

District Two Conference 

- (Continued,From Page 1).. T

-. The concentration on strike
issues and problems followed
naturally from the fact that
District 2 has more locals,
members and company opera-
tions involved in the strike

than any other. area of the «

union. Sixteen of the 19 locals
participating in the conference
are on strike.

IN THEIR REMARKS to
the delegates, Larson and
Dichter described the refusal
of the metal mining companies
to make offers and bargain as
a sit-down strike -against the

industry's w o r k e r s. ‘T he y 1

linked this with-ythei general
attacks by big *b'usi'-ness and

the Republican administration ‘

against the entire labor move-
ment. «- ’ 5' ' ‘

Witt,
bor Landrum-Griffin _ bill just
passed by Congress, said that
despite . all the propaganda
about labor bosses, crooks and
racketeers which was ’ sup-

posed to justify its passage, "

the new legislation contained
little or no provisions for
catching crooks and racketeers
but many provisions to re-
strict and weaken unions. He
also reported on the defense
of the 14 past and present
Mine-Mill officers
members now scheduled to go
on trial. starting Oct. 26 in
Denver.’

In this connection, the re-
port of the conference’s de-

fense committee approved by

the delegates declared:

“We

ourselves to support them un-
til complete-vindication, and to

do everything possible to clear

the union, its- locals and _the
individual members unjustly
hit by injunction, contempt of

court and damage suits arising

out of the strike.”

THE COMMITTEE re p o r t
emphasized “that the legal at-
tacks d i r e c t e d against the
membership of this union,
ranging from injunctions and
damage suits against rank and
file members‘ to conspiracy

strike which has cut off more than 75 per cent of U. S. mine; 
and primary refinery production. Copper is available in limited .3?
amounts from custom smelters and dealers at higher prices.,_-\
Watch lead and zinc prices, which industry observers expect to
go higher yet this year. Zinc price has shown real strength;
considering that the steel strike has cut heavily into the use of
zinc for galvanizing, and the fact that only about one-fifth of 
U. S. zinc refining capacity and less than one-fourth of U. _, 
zinc mine production (in Montana and New York State)%<-’,
affected by strikes. One reason for strength in zinc, accordin” 
to American Die Casting Institute, is 23 per cent increase inf"
use of zinc in die casting compared with last year. Price in- 
creases that have taken place already mean big extra profits .
for lead-zinc companies. For example, John D. Bradley, presi-
dent of Bunker Hill Company says a price increase of 1 cent; *
a pound for both lead and zinc would mean about one million. -
dollars  -extra profits for the company. This figures out to 
better than $500 extra profit for every mine, smelter and re- 1
finery worker at Bunker Hill. 7 '

TORONTO, Ont.—Unity of purpose to carry through
- T1 the union’s program on pension vesting and other magor
bargaining demands highlighted‘ the closing sessions of
 the 11th annual Canadian convention of the International

The achievement of unity
was the most significant fact
It was
5 achieved because the 125 dele-

 gates were able, within the

 

, .

democratic procedures of
§‘M§i.ne-Mill, to engage in a full
and open floor discussion on a
hi-ghly controversial political

.’/sqiuestion involving charges of

v

 

fonnnunist domination of
 Mine-Mill and to come out of
A this discussion, after nine
hours of debate and a roll-
call Vote, with a firm resolve
that membership rights under
the constitution would remain
fully protected.
This debate took place
around two resolutions, which,

 if adopted,’ would have re-

moved the rights of any union
member to run for union of-
"fice unless he first swore an
oath that he was neither a
.-Communist nor a Communist
sympathizer.

A MAJORITY of the dele-
gates, many of whom referred
‘to the proposals resolutions as
“Taft-Hartley,” saw the reso-

lutions as attacks on union
rights and pointed out it would

 , . deprive the membership of the

right to nominate and vote for

"officers of their choice. A ma-

jority of the speakers empha-
sized that passing of resolu-
tions would destroy the gu-ar-
antee of the membership to in-

‘ . gdiyijglual political beliefs.

Canadian section of Mine-Mill
will be Ken Smith, present
Western District Board. Mem-
ber. He will take the place of
Nels Thibault, who will con-
test the Local‘ 598 presidency
in November. Al‘ King-, Presi-
dent of Local 480, Trail, Brit-

take Smith's place as Western
District Board member. Vice-
President Harvey Murphy,
Vice-President William Kenne-

Board Member Ray Stevenson
were reelected by acclamation.

Major questions facing I the
delegates included the exten-
sive changes in structure of
the union in- Canada which
were endorsed‘ by the conven-
tion and will now be submit-
ted to a referendum vote of
the membership-. Equal in im-
portance was the united and
unanimous demand of the con-
vention that government and
industry, without delay, recog-
nize their responsibility to Ca-
nadian workers by establish-
ing pension vesting security as
a matter of employee rights.

ANOTHER MAJOR PRO-
GRAM decision adopted unan-
imously by the convention was
agreement on the necessity to
fight for a charter of Labour’s
Economic Rights.

The convention was unani-
mous in support of striking
Mine-Mill members in the Unit-
ed States and adopted a reso-
lution which pledged each 10-
cal to mobilize every possible
support to assist “our Brother
members of the International
Union,” to win their strike
against the mining companies
in the United States. The Ca-
nadian Executive board point-
ed? out that the members of
Mine-Mill in the United‘ States

"had rallied to support the Inco

strikers morally and finan-
cially a-nd pledged that the
strike fund of the Canadian
union was at the disposal of
the U. S. section of the Inter-
national.

Last month’s convention of
the United Electrical Workers
voted support of several
strikes,‘ including Mine-Mill’s.
Generally, the copper strike
was winning increased sup-
port around the country from
other unions and community
forces. Strikers and strike
committees, meanwhile, were
conducting one of the tightest
walkouts in the union's his-
tory. Mine-Mill’s Research de-
partment estimates that as of
the end of September, 100,000
tons of copper production "had
been lost because of the strike.
* ' In a word, it is an effective
strike. Thirty-five thousand
copper strikers are waging an
admirable fight ‘ to I protect
themselves from the ravages
of speedup, higher productiv-

A ity, and increased living costs,
