crats for the six-hour workday is simply Hoover’s stagger plan
dressed in labor phrases. Green’s talk of resistance to wage cuts,
is also pure bluff; and likewise. his fake hints of a possible revo-
lution “if something is not done about unemployment.” Such
pseudo radicalism is simply to delude the workers and by no
means indicates a more militant policy on the part of these fakers.
In Europe, the reactionary bureaucracy makes a similar "radica1”
stagger-plan propaganda for the ﬁve-day week slogan. They
also conduct a sham battle against wage cuts—while at the same
time they are putting these wage cuts into effect by means of
their arbitration boards. Everywhere also, even the most pro-

nounced fascists are characterized by such “left” demagogy to-

fool the masses. They know that the masses are discontented
and they try to organize this discontent into attacks against the
workers themselves by covering up their capitalist programs with
pretenses of radicalism. Such “left” maneuvers are character-
istic of the crisis situation and must be ruthlessly exposed and

combatted. i
Muste’s Pseudo-Radicalism

Muste now makes such a “left” maneuver in the United States.
Long a typical open opportunist, he is now suddenly putting on
a bright red dress for the occasion of the crisis. His C. P. L. A.
sees that the workers are deeply discontented, that both the or-
ganized and unorganized workers are seeking the means to strug-
gle. They also see the growing inﬂuence of the revolutionary
unions and the Communist Paty, and the tendency of these or-
ganizations to secure mass leadership. Hence, the Musteites
come forward with their phrase-mongering program to draw the
rebellious workers into the control of the A. F. of L. and the
S. P., with whose basic policies the so-called progressives are in
agreement. Their program is to revive and revigoratevthese re-
actionary organizations and to make militant war against the
revolutionary unions.

For this general purpose, the Musteites have become so "rad-

cal” of late that they talk of forming dual unions, and a new
Socialist Party. They even speak of the "possible necessity” for
violence in the class struggle, and begin to chatter vaguely about
the eventual possibility of a proletarian dictatorship.

But all this radical talk boils down to tamely following the
basic reactionary policies of the A. F. of L. and the S. P., as we
shall see. The general effects of Musteism are to paralyze the
struggles of the workers, to betray them to the A. F. of L. and
Socialist Party reactionaries, to hinder the progress of the revo-
lutionary unions of the T. U. U. L. The Musteites are emerg-

ency aids to the discredited strike-breaking trade union bureau-

cracy.
A Record of Betrayal

This is not the first experience of the workers with the growth

of such fake "left” movements as the C. P. L. A. In past crises
similar movements have also played a role in which they fully
exposed their reactionary character. In the great revolutionary
upheavals in Europe following the war there was a big develop-
ment of such “left” movements. They even split from the
Second International and formed a new organization, the so-
called 21/; International. These elements, with their radical
phrases and reactionary action, sabotaged every revolutionary
struggle of the period. Then, (when the workers had been de-
feated, they openly showed their reactionary colors by merging

‘ their international with the old Second International of the

ultra-yellow socialists. They went back where they belonged-—
to organizational unity with the extreme rights. During the
period of the British general strike, there was also a marked
development along the same line. The Purcell-Hicks-Cook
group of the tradeiunon leaders became very radical in words.
They even made a united front with the Russian unions against
the Amsterdam International, but when the general strike came,
they were just as active in its betrayal as the ultra-right leaders——
Thomas, Clynes, MacDonald, etc. .And after the wrecking of

 

 

12 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE B-IG LABOR FAKERS

the strike, they merged themselves completely with the rights.
In short, “they headed the general strike movement in order to
behead it.” These “lefts” were never more than a section of the
right trade union bureacracy with the special task of fooling and
demoralizing the masses with their radical phrases.

In the United States, during this same general period after
the war, there was a similar growth of “left” tendencies. The
so-called progressives, exempliﬁed by John Fitzpatrick, became
quite “radical.” Nockles of the Chicago Federation of Labor,
for example, denounced the Communists as conservatives and
pronounced himself a real red. Hillman, president of the A.
C. W., even aspired to R. I. L. U. leadership; in the United
States. Others took a similar “left” stand. This was not be-
cause these elements had suddenly become revolutionary, but be-
cause under the pressure of the militant masses, it was neces-
sary for them to make a presense of radicalism in order to re-
tain their mass control.

But after the crisis ,had liquidated itself into the Coolidge
prosperity period, these “progressives” swiftly lost their shallow
radical hue. Fitzpatrick and Nockles surrendered openly to
Gompers. I-Iillman and the "progressives” generally, became
the very leaders in advocating the B 8L 0 p1an—labor banking,-
expulsion of left wingers—and the whole orientation of the re-
actionary labor leaders towards intensiﬁed collaboration with the
employers.

Now, in the midst of the present crisis, Muste and his fel-
low leaders of, the C. P. L. A. propose to make a similar “left”
maneuver. These open opportunists are coming forward with
a new fake radicalism. But this time it will not'be so easy to
fool the workers. The workers have learned from the earlier ex-
periences, above related, and they will not so easily walk into
the trap of the “left” phrase-mongers.

Muste—Advocate of Capitalist Planned Economy

Now let us take a look at Musteism in real life. When this
is done, it is at once evident that despite all his radical talk, the
basic line of policy of Muste is the same as that oﬁ the reac-
tionary A. F. of L. The same general criticisms that apply to
the A. F. of L. also apply to the Musteites. The Muste group
is the cutting edge of the strike-breaking A. F. of L. bureau-
cracy in its ﬁght against the revolutionary unions.

First, let us look for a moment at Muste’ s "revolutionary”
theory. He speaks vaguely of “socialism” and "planned economy
with worker control.” He even hints in a round about way at
the bare possibility of a necessity for the proletarian dictator-
ship. In passing, it is important to note the fact that when such
an open opportunist as Muste comes forward with these pre-
tenses at revolution, it is an indication of the rapid radicalization
of the workers and the extremes of phrase-mongering to which
the opportunists are driven in order to exert real inﬂuence upon
the masses.

But let us see what Mr. Muste really means by "planned
economy.” In Labor’: Share of the Late Lamented Prosperity,
published by the C. P. L. A., he says:

"From now on more must be done‘ in the way of social plan-
ning, of social control, if we are to make the best of possibilities.
Indeed, some of the leading forces of business and some of the
best brains of the economists have already begun the endeavor
to learn how to build a controlled economy. Labor should
not lag in this eﬁort. Its power, its point of view, and its in-
telligence, will be necessary for the success of any such program.
If the labor movement does not recognize this modern trend for
economic control, and participate in it, the labor movement will
become a mere backwater in the stream of history.”

This statement is the rankest of capitalist economics. It ex-
poses the thin veneer of Muste’s pretenses of socialism. Hillquit,
the typical social fascist, will agree with it, and so, also, will
Norman Thomas. More than that, Matthew Woll, Hamilton
Fish and Herbert Hoover will also heartily subscribe to such a

 

14 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

conception. Similar advocacy of capitalist planned economy can
be read any time in the Wall Street Journal.

Muste’s theory that capitalism can overcome its crisis by
planned production is exactly what the capitalists themselves are
saying and hoping for. And it is typical of such social fascists
as Muste that, despite their radical pretenses, they are the very
leaders in this counter-revolutionary attempt to bolster up the
decaying capitalist system by developing “planned economy.”

The T. U. U. L. repudiates such capitalist poison as Muste
spreads about a systematic and organized capitalist production.
Such conceptions sow illusions among the workers about capi-
talist “prosperity” and destroys their militancy. The T. U. U. L.
denies that capitalism can establish such social‘ planning. Capi-
talism is inherently competitive and anarchistic in production.
Only a Workers’ State, such as the Soviet Government, can
carry on planned production. "Planned capitalist economy” is
a plan against the workers. The T. U. U. L. denies that the

capitalists can overcome their contradictions and crisis, as

Muste’s theory implies. On the contrary, these contradictions
and the general crisis of capitalism, must become sharper, deeper,
more explosive. Only the proletarian revolution can ﬁnally solve
these contradictions and liquidate the capitalist crisis by the over-
throw of capitalism and the establishment of the Workers’ and
Farmers’ Government.

In the face of Muste’s program for curing capitalism’s ills
on the basis of planned production, his confused talk about the
proletarian dictatorship is worse than ridiculous. It is merely
put forward to deceive the workers. His whole conception is
ﬂatly contradictory to the Marxian-Leninist theory and program
of proletarian revolution.

Muste—Supporter of the B & 0 Plan

The heart of the A. F. of L. class collaboration policy is union-
management-cooperation, or the B 8C O Plan. This is the bosses’

 

 

1
e
l

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 15

policy‘ for speeding the workers, for cutting their wages, for
destroying militant organization and struggle amongst them,
and anyone who advocates it is directly doing the employers’
service. Now let us see how the Musteite policy is the same as
that of the A. F. of L. in this vital matter. From Muste’s
own mouth it is clear that he supports the B 86 0 Plan not only
in practice, but also in theory. It is characteristic of the dem-
agogy of fake lefts such as Muste that they talk about the dic-
tatorship of the proletariat, the class struggle, the B 86 0 Plan,
and capitalist planned economy all in one breath.

In his pamphlet Peace or Pep, Muste says:

“I am not one of those who have been violently and indiscrimi-
nately critical of union-management-cooperation, the B 85 0 Plan.
In some of its features, it is an inevitable and justifiable ex-
tension of collective bargaining.”

And again in his pamphlet, The Kind of Unionism, he says:

“For the union to assume responsibility for production eﬂi-
ciency, elimination of waste, and so on, is not, I submit, a funda-
mentally new departure either in a conservative or a radical
direction. It is just our old friend, Collective Bargaining.
There is no use kicking against it, kicking about it in bull-
headed fashion.”

Mr. W011 and Mr. Green have no quarrel with such a state-
ment. The employers will also find it quite satisfactory. It
exposes the basic, line of Muste to be identical with that of the
A. F. of L. leadership. It means in practice to subordinate the
trade unions to the employers, and to reduce them to mere ad-
juncts of the capitalist machinery.

Muste’s B 8: 0 Plan endorsement is not some peculiarity of
his own, as different from other social fascists. It is entirely in
line with the policy of the Socialist Party and reactionary trade

unions in this country and all over the world. For example, the .

British trade unions and the Labor Party endorsed Mondism and
the League of Nations’ rationalization program worked out by

, ,:,=.-,~z..—..~;___-._-__ .

16 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

the employers, the first provision of which is “to secure the
maximum efliciency of labor with - the minimum of effort.”
Similarly, the German trade unions, four years ago, declared,
“In full agreement with the memorandum of the German in-
dustrialists, we consider that rationalization is the most impor-
tant condition for the well-being of the nation.”

Such class collaboration as embodied in union-management-
cooperation destroys the militancy of the workers. It is a sur-
render of their ﬁght to the employers. It reduces Muste, like
the A. F. of L. leaders, to speed-up agents of the bosses. The
T.U.U.L. repudiates Muste’s whole B 86 0 Plan conception.
The T. U. U. L. unions, while they may enter into agreements
with employers over wages and working conditions, assume no
responsibility whatever for production. Their fight is to im-
prove the conditions of the workers, not to speed-up production.
The responsibility for production will devolve upon the workers
only after the social revolution.

The Musteites—Little Brothers of the Big
Trade Union Bureaucrats

The Musteites, agreeing with the A. F. of L. heads regarding
class collaboration, consequently have no real ﬁght against these
leaders. Such quarrels as they carry on with them in their
journals are purely on the surface and for display purposes only.
Instead of considering the A. F. of» L. leaders, as Lenin said
they were, as agents of the bourgeoisie, and as the T. U. U. L.
treats them in practice, with relentless opposition, the Musteite
attitude towards these misleaders is that they are erring or mis-
guided brothers who need only a certain amount of correction
to show them the wrongness of their way. The substance of
Muste’s program is to educate them or coax them in one way

or another, into "action.”

For example, when the Southern organizing campaign was

instituted by the A. F. of L., Muste greeted this manifestly fake

 

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 17

campaign “with glee,” and when the workers in the Southhad
been shamefully betrayed, Muste simply said that “it suggested
another grave shortcoming in the A. F. of L. organization
strategy.” Similarly, when the A. F. of L. went militantly ahead.
with its boss-inspired ﬁght against unemployment insurance,
Muste was moved to consider this only “an amazing inconsistency
on the part of the A. F. of L.” The fake auto campaign of the
A. F. of L. left him only "bitterly disappointed.”

But the ﬁght against unemployment insurance by the A. F.
of L. is no inconsistency, nor was the betrayal of the Southern
workers a grave shortcoming of the A. F. of L. organization
strategy. Both constitute direct treachery to the workers, carried
out at the instigation of the A. F. of L. leaders’ mastersin W/all
Street. The same is to be said of the still-born auto organizing
campaign and various similar projects of the A. F. of L.

Characteristically, Mr. Muste, who fails to see the A. F. of
L. bureaucrats as real enemies of the workers, proposes that
“there be a measure of toleration and decency shown in the
ﬁght against the A. F. of L. leaders.” And experience shows
that Muste tolerates them very successfully. This is because he
and his group are essentially a section of the A. F. of L. bureau-
cracy, in spite of their radical phrases. For example, recently
in the New York pocket-book makers union, Shiplacoff, social

' fascist leader of the union, accused his colleagues of furnishing

information to the bosses, and the Finance Committee (also
social fascists) charged mishandling of $265,000. A committee

composed of the bureaucrats Zaritsky, Salutsky, Hendin, Dubin-_

sky and M uste was appointed to investigate this glaring scandal.
But this committee brought in a report——also signed by Muste——-
brought in a report white-washing the whole crooked gang. So

far as the T. U. U. L. is concerned, it neither tolerates these A

bureaucrats, nor treats them decently; it is out to politically
exterminate them and nothing short of that.

Muste says that his program is to force the A. F. of L. leaders

 

18 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

to ﬁght. This is also a delusion and a snare. No one can make <

these misleaders ﬁght in defense of the workers’ interests. All
that can be done is to make them put forward a few phrases
so‘ that they can stand at the head of the militant movement of
the workers, and thus be enabled to betray them in the struggle.
Mr. Muste’s program of forcing the A. F. of L. leaders to
"ﬁght” is only another means of keeping them in positions
where they can betray the workers.

Muste also declares that “in a strike one shuts his mouth and
hides his time.” This simply means to surrender the struggle
of the workers to the control of their reactionary leaders in its
most acute periods, just when there is the greatest danger of
betrayal.

The Muste group further clearly exposes its character as a
section of the A. F. of L. bureaucracy by openly afliliating with
these bureaucrats wherever and whenever they make even the
ﬂimsiest pretenses of "progressivism.” Thus when the fascist
Broach was elected head of the Electrical Workers Union, Muste
called upon him as a "progressive” to “put on his armor and with
sword in hand, go out and ﬁght the dragon of open shoppery.”
The quality of this fascist’s "progressivism” may be judged
from the fact that in the Electrical Workers Journal of August,
1930, he typically declared that "any fool who ‘leaves it to the
members to decide’ is not ﬁt to represent a labor union.” And
again in the Illinois mine situation, when the proven labor
crooks, Fishwick, Farrington and Walker, organized a fake new
miners’ union with Howatt, Muste enthusiastically praised John
J. Walker (Labor Age, Oct., 1930) as “strong man because
of his position _in the Illinois Federation of Labor.” Muste
mildly criticized Farrington of noisome reputation among the
miners, but he hastily took all the sting out of his criticism by
saying that after all "selling out to the operators is not so serious
with, the miners.” Muste’s theory here is that the miners have

been sold out so often that they now take it as a matter of course
on the part of their leaders.

The Muste-A. F. L. Betrayal in the South

Now let us see how the “left” Muste puts his combined policy

of capitalist social p1anning——B _8C 0 Plan——united front with
the A. F. of L. bureaucrats, etc., into practice. For this we need
only to take the recent so-called organizing campaign of the
A. F. of L. in the South. The Southern workers, intolerably
oppressed, were in a state of mass revolt, such as this country
has seldom seen. Their upheaval was of vast importance. The
role of the A. F. of L. is to liquidate such upheavals for the
capitalists. That is why they are supported by the big employ-
ers and the United States government. Hence the A. F. of L.
got busy at once to smash the growing movement in the South
and in this they had the active support of the C. P. L. A.

The A. F. of L. launched its campaign with the usual bombast.
According to a report in a Memphis paper (quoted in Labor
and Textiles), here is how Green undertook the job:

“William Green, president of the A. F. of L., might be taken
for the president of a bank, the president of a railroad, a United
States Senator, or a good corporation lawyer. . .. The policies
he advocated might have come with propriety from the presi-
dent of the American Bankers’ Association.”

In addition, Mr. MacMahon, president of the United Tex-
tile Workers, and a warm friend of Mr. Muste, further elabo-
rated the A. F. of L. policy in the South as follows:

"We aren’t talking higher wages, we aren’t talking shorter
hours, you cannot express our objectives in those terms.”

As further A. F. of L. preparations to “organize the South,”
Mr. Jeffrey Browne, efficiency engineer, went along with Green
and MacMahon and held conferences with the employers every-
where to convince them that they could better speed up and
exploit their workers with the help of the A. F. of L., and pre-
vent the growth of the revolutionary unions in the South.

 

“m,

 

20 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE‘ BIG LABOR FAKERS

Then,’ to complete the line up, the other wing of the A. F. of
L. machinery, the Muste group, got into action. Mr. Muste
became all enthusiastic about the southern campaign and hailed
it as very important. He painted this treacherous manouvre of
the A. F. of L. as a real effort to organize the southern workers.
He even demanded that the fakers in charge be given $1,000,000
by the workers to do their “work.” Moreover, the C. P. L. A.
sent its organizers to “help the good work” along. These or-
ganizers talked radical to the workers in the mills, while Green,
MacMahon and Co. were selling them out in the Chambers of
Commerce. And then, once the workers took the initiative them-
selves and developed strikes, Organizer Hoffman, a Brookwood
College graduate and a notable progressive, who brought into
the South the employers’ agent who broke the Passaic strike,
worked hand in glove with him and the government arbitrators
and most reactionary A. F. of L. fakers in selling out these
workers by means of the notorious gentlemen’s  agreement in
Marion and Elizabethtown. The U. T. W. leaders, with whom
the Muste organizers actively cooperated, used the same methods
in wrecking the heroic strike in Danville. Naturally, the whole
movement in the South has resulted in a shameful debacle,
disastrous for the workers.

To save his “progressive” reputation, Muste now comes for-
ward denying all responsibility for the criminal betrayal, saying
the C. P. L. A. policies were not followed. But this will not
avail. How the Musteites "protest:ed” against the A. F. of L.
policy in the South is exemplified by the following statement of
Tom Tippet, a Musteite leader, in his recent book, When
Southern Labor Stirs, page‘179:

"Mr. Green was well received in the South-—bankers and
politicians, manufacturers and teachers, attended his meetings.
...Mr. Green addressed himself to the upper classes and the
whole setting of his meetings was adapted to these elements.
-The president of the A. F. of L. did not talk at the mill gates,
this was good strategy on his tmrt.” (Emphasis mine—VV. Z. F.)

 

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 21

The Muste group were active participants in the sell-out of the
Southern workers by the A. F. of L. The Musteites were the
catspaw of the A. F. of L. bureaucracy, a “radical” ﬁgleaf for
Green to hide his reactionary nakedness. In the South, the

_ Musteites clearly exposed their role as auxiliaries of the strike-

breaking A. F. of L. bureaucracy, as an essential part of the
bosses’ machinery to beat back the workers and to prevent the
organization of the revolutionary unions.

Musteites Betrayal in the Needle Trades

The needle trades of New York give objective example of how
the Musteites actually operate in the class struggle as objective
agents of the bosses and the A. F. of L. leadership.

The social fascist unions of the needle trades follow basic
policies identical with those of other A. F. of L. unions. They
apply union-management-cooperation with its inevitable wage
cuts, speed-up, eﬂiciency engineers in the unions, etc. They are
craft unions; they are controlled by gangsters, trade union
democracy being at zero in them. They check oﬁ dues in agree-
ment with the bosses. They pay typical A. F. of L. extravagant
salaries to oﬂicials. They are saturated with graft, etc. The
only diiference between these and ordinary A. F. of L. unions
is that they make efforts to cover up their reactionary policies
with radical phrases about socialism, the Labor Party, etc. They
are compelled to use these phrases because they have to deal
with more radical workers. Muste swallows whole this ‘noisome
mess, giving the needle trades unions his unqualiﬁed endorse-
ment.

A few years ago conditions became so intolerable in the needle
trades that there developed a mass revolt under the leadership
of the old T. U. E. L. The "socialist” needle trades unions
had become tools of the bosses and of Tammany Hall. The
majority of the needle workers in New York, totalling at least

, 60,000, went into open struggle against the bosses and the so-

 

22 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

cialist union leaders; but, under the personal direction of Green
and Wall, who worked hand in glove with the Socialist Party,
this movement, including several strikes, was broken and the
unions shattered. Mr. Muste did nothing but applaud the whole

reactionary attack of the combined A. F. of L. and Socialist

Party leaders upon the workers.

Then these leaders began to rebuild the shattered unions.
The methods they used were exempliﬁed in the recent cloak and
dress strikes in New York. These strikes, in reality lock-outs
to enforce the old unions upon the workers, were openly initiated
by the bosses and carried through by a most brazen united front
of employers, capitalist newspapers, politicians, the S. P., the
A. F. of L., police, gangsters, etc. The workers were literally
herded back into the old unions by this fascist aggregation on
pain of losing their jobs and otherwise facing the capitalist ter-
ror. The T. U. U. L. revolutionary needle trades union had to
wage a life and death struggle against this fascist and insidious
combination.

And what did the “left” Mr. Muste do about all this? Even
as he had endorsed the breaking of the left wing control in the

-needle unions previously, so he applauded the fake cloak and

dress strikes as great victories. In this he was joined by Mr.
Green, who devoted a whole issue of the American Federationist
to expound what a great victory had been won over the revolu-
tionary workers. The rebuilding of the I. L. G. W. U. Mr.
Muste hailed as one of the splendid recent achievements of the
American labor movement. The betrayal of the workers by the
A. F. of L. and the S. P. in the needle trades is one of the most
shameful pages in American labor history and upon this page,
the Muste "progressive” group has written its reactionary record
in the clearest terms.

Muste—Enemy of Independent Unionism
Muste’s C. P. L.  now talks glibly of forming new unions

wherever the reactionary unions are unwilling or incapable of

 

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 23

leading thq masses. But this is only a pretense like the rest of
Muste’s “radicalism.” Wherever the Muste group take the
initiative in forming new unions, it is merely to prevent the
growth of the revolutionary unions. They will always be ready
to turn their independent organizations back to the A. F. of L.
when the occasion offer. The Muste C.P.L.A.’ites are bitter ene-
mies of all revolutionary unionism. Their whole policy in the min-
ing, needle and textile industries is\_ designed to smash the revo-
lutionary unions. For example, in the Illinois mining ﬁelds, when
the A. F. of L. fakers could not longer hold the revolting miners
from the control of the National Miners Union, Muste launched
his fake dual union with the Fishwick, Farrington and Walker-
Peabody Coal Co. agents, at its head, their weakling tool,
Howat, in the middle, and the Trotskyites at the tail.

Muste, an enemy of the T. U. U. L., even tries to quote Lenin
against the formation of independent revolutionary unions. But
this is a monstrous misrepresentation of Lenin’s position. The
fact is that Lenin, while correctly stressing the necessity for
working inside the conservative trade unions, also clearly un-
derstood the need for forming revolutionary trade unions where
the old organizations did, not offer this basis for working-class
struggle. This is exempliﬁed by his support of the formation
of the independent revolutionary union movement in France
and Czecho-Slovakia.

The Musteites are as consciously enemies of the T.U.U.L.
unions as the A. F. of L. bureaucrats are. This enmity Mr.
Muste boasts of. In the Federated News Letter of February 3,
1929, in presenting himself to the A. F. of L. bureaucracy as a
loyal opposition, he declared: _“We are as unwilling to cooperate
with the Communists as is the A. F. of L. itself.” This state-
ment: puts Muste side by side with Woll and Green.

But Muste has no difficulty, however, in cooperating with
Communisq renegades. He goes along, cheek by jowl, with the
Salutskys, Tippets, Lores, Lovestones, Weisbords, Gitlows,

 

 

 

24 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

Watts, and Angelos, expelled from the Communist Party. This
is because their line for liquidation of the T.U.U.L., for trade
union legalism, for united fronts with A. F. of L. fakers, etc.,
is basically the same as his.

These elements follow more and more the essential Muste
line and form a united front with Muste against the T.U.U.L.
In the needle trades, the Lovestoneite, Zimmerman, openly de-
mands the liquidation of the Needle Trades Workrs Industrial
Union, and surrender to the I.L.G.W.U. In the Illinois mining
ﬁelds, the Trotskyites supported the formation of the Howat
union against the National Miners Union, while the Lovestone-

. ites stood for all hands retreating back to the rotten U. M. W.

A. In the textile industry Gitlow of the Lovestone group, has
just made a united front with the U. T. W. leaders to ﬁght
against the efforts of the T.U.U.L. textile union, which now has
ﬁve of its Paterson leaders facing execution, to organize the
Paterson silk workers. For this campaign the American Fund
for Public Service has voted him $3,000.

Muste’s “Fight” Against Unemployment and
Wage Cuts

The Muste C. P. L. A. while tipping‘ its hat to the proposi-
tion of unemployment insurance, makes no real ﬁght for it.
The Muste group has a typically capitalist outlook on the ques-
tion of unemployment,_ even as the A. F. of L. It sees unem-
ployment more or less as a passing phenomenon. Thus in the
pamphlet, Labor’: Share in the Late Lamented Prosperity, it is
said: -

“It would be foolish to assert that the introduction of ma-
chinery would mean that fewer men would have jobs ten years
hence than now are at work. Better methods help create jobs
in the long run. But that does not mean that there is not a

serious problem for the workers who now lose their jobs and
do not ﬁnd new ones for several months.”

This is capitalist rot, such as can be read any day in the capi-
talist papers. Even the A. F. of L. would make a more intel-

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 25

ligent statement of the problems of unemployment. The T. U.
U. L. repudiates such a capitalist: proposition. With the in-
troduction of new speed-up methods and with the shrinkage of
the world markets, a huge and permanent unemployed army is
being developed in all the capitalist countries. This grows ever
worse. To reduce it simply to a temporary condition is to ignore
the whole problem. Not only is unemployment not a temporary
phenomenon but capitalism has no cure for it. The best that
can be done for it under capitalism is to relieve the workers
from the burden of ‘starvation through systems of state insurance
and immediate measures of relief. Only the proletarian revolu-
tion can finally solve the problem. The workers in the Soviet
Union have shown the only way to wipe out unemployment.

The C. P. L. A. also makes no ﬁght against the wage cutting
drive of the bosses. Muste, as a true bourgeois economist, sees
the resistance‘ to these drives condemned in advance. His theory
is that strikes cannot be successfully conducted during the crisis,
a typical Menshevik conception. In the New York Times, Dec.
9, 1921, commenting on the Hoover-A. F. of L. no wage-cutting
agreement, Muste accepts the inevitability of wage cuts, by say-
ing= .,

“The serious fact remains, however, that they made a bad

bargain for labor, for many reasons. The promise of the em-
ployers, not to cut wages, cannot be enforced.”

Logically following up this idea of the inevitability of wage
cuts, the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Work-
ers, controlled by Muste elements, promptly accepted a general
wage cut of 20 per cent for 16,000 workers without a strike.
It was the first American national trade union to oﬂicially accept
a general wage cut. Muste excuses this on the ground that the
rest of the labor movement is too backward in development to
give support for a real struggle against wage cuts. In Phila-
delphia, when the upholstery workers struck against a 14 per-
cent ‘wage cut engineered by the U. T. W. oﬂicials, these of-

 

 

26 LITTLE BROTHERS OFATHE BIG LABOR FAKERS

ﬁcials, with the connivance of the Muste local leaders, expelled
the local and organized a new union to take its place.

The T. U. U. L. rejects this whole Muste surrender in the
face of the bosses’ wage cut drive. It calls upon the workers
to wage a militant struggle against such wage slashing. Its
slogan is “Organize and Strike Against Wage Cuts” and this
is the slogan that the masses of workers instinctively support
when they face wage reductions.

Muste’s Acceptance of Arbitration and Injunctions

The Muste movement, like the A. F. of L. bureaucracy, ac-
cepts arbitration in theory and practice. This is exempliﬁed
by the so-called “impartial machinery” in the needle trades
unions, which Muste supports, and by the shameful arbitration
betrayals by the Musteites among the Philadelphia textile work-
ers. The T.U.U.L., on the contrary, ﬁghts against arbitration
as a basic method of the employers to beat down the workers
in the struggle.

The Musteites have also abandoned the ﬁght against the in-

« junction. They support the A. F. of L.-S. P. proposals, to ac-

cept injunctions provided preliminary hearings have been held
in the courts. This policy legalizes the use of the injunction
against the workers. The T. U. U. L., on the other hand, relent-
lessly ﬁghts the injunction and calls upon the workers to meet
the issuance of all injunctions by mass violation upon the picket

_ lines.

The C. P. L. A.’s Jim-Crowism

The C. P. L. A. supports the A. F. of L. Jim-Crowpolicy
with regard to Negro workers. In the South, the U. T. W.

followed a policy of organizing separate Negro locals and the

- Musteites winked at it. The attitude of Mr. MacMahon, Muste-

ite ally, on the Negro question is exempliﬁed by the fact that at
a meeting in the South where a white chauvinist accused him of
advocating social equality for Negroes, he indignantly denounced

 

aeummv _

I

 

I

\

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 27

the chauvinist asia liar and assured him that he made no such
demand. \

The attitude of the C. P. L. A. towards the Negro question
is properly summarized by Mr. Heywood Broun, a socialist can-
didate supported by Muste in the recent elections. Broun said
in the New York Telegram of April 28, 1930:

“If I were a candidate for high executive oﬂice, or judiciary

' oﬁce, I would say, even without being cornered, that I would

not now sanction the efforts to enforce the 14th and 15th

Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.”

(These amendments provide for citizenship rights of Negroes-—
W. Z. F.)

The"Musteites avoid formulating demands for Negro rights.
The clear-cut demands of the T.U.U.L. they denounce as “ﬁne
phrases” (“The Negro Worker”, p. 14). With such a stand on
the Negro .question, the Muste “progressives” have no trouble
to live in harmony with white chauvinist A. F. of L. leaders.

Against such shameful betrayal of the struggle of the Negro
workers. the T. U. U. L. militantly ﬁghts. It demands full in-
dustrial, political and social equality for the Negroes, with th
the right of self determination in the Black Belt. Moreover,
T. U. U. L. organizers and members ﬁght for those demands
in the most terror-ridden South. This is exempliﬁed by the ﬁght
they are now making‘ for the nine Negro boys the Southern
capitalists are trying to legally lynch in Scottsboro, Alabama.

M uste’s Pacifism

The Musteites, under cover of their “left” phrase demagogy,
are supporters of the capitalist war program. The capitalists
have a double-phased war policy. This consists, on the one hand,
of open military preparations for war, and on the other, of
paciﬁst moves’ (disarmament conferences, peace pacts, etc.) to
throw dust into the eyes of the masses and to blind them re-
garding the real war preparations that are going on. T Both of
these phases are propagated in the working class by the direct or

 

 

28 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS‘

objective agents of American imperialism. Thus, Well and
Green advocate militarism openly, while Muste and Thomas
advocate the paciﬁsts lures which blind the masses to the true
war danger.

The paciﬁsm of Muste is graphically illustrated by the Labor
Age analysis of the London Naval Conference. This journal.
in March, 1930, says, the “London Naval Conference was Balked
by Imperialist Design.” But in reality this conference was not
balked by imperialist designs, it was organized by imperialist
designs. The London conference was not a conference called
by some peace loving spirits and then spoiled by imperialist ex-
ploiters. It was simply a manouvre of these imperialists in their
struggles against each other, and especially was it designed to
create illusions among the masses that the capitalist governments
are actuallyitrying to prevent war. It was above all, a step in the
organization of the projected capitalist war against the Soviet
Union.

Muste’s paciﬁsm is in line with the social fascist paciﬁsm and
militarism the world over. The socialists in all countries (Ger-
many, England,_ Poland, etc.,) find it quite possible in their
demagogic way to advocate both phases of the capitalist war
program; that is, while keeping up their pacifist chatter, they
at the same time, vote for the war budgets in their respective
governments and take the lead in militarizing the peoples. They
are real organizers of the coming world war.

Muste and the Socialist Party

The C. P. L. A., lined up with the “left” wing of the Sociallist
Party, now talks glibly of the regeneration of the S. P. The
Stanley group (Muste wing of the S. P.) wants the S. P. to
adopt a more “radical” program—that is, to go in more for
radical phrases in the approved Muste way. And they hint if
this is- not done they will form a new party. But such a party
wolud be a hindrance to the workers. It would be only another

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIIG LABOR FAKERS 29

demagogic phrase-mongering aid to the A. F. of L. and S. P.
policy. _

The Muste movement is a tail of the Socialist Party. In the
last election Muste openly supported the S.P. In the N ew Leader,
Muste stated that he “would do all in my power to promote the
campaign of the S. P. candidates this fall”. Thus, the “left”
Muste found himself in a united front with the capitalist papers
and politicians, bourgeois intellectuals, etc., for Thomas, Broun,
and Co., candidates whom these reactionary elements were con-
sciously supporting as willing tools agains the awakening
workers.

The Muste group, with its “left” phrases, is a component part
of the world wide counter-revolutionary Second International.
The British Labor Government, with its wage cutting, dole cut-
ting, and speed-up program, its imperialist Indian policy, etc.,
is a good example of how this institution is used for the main-
tenance of capitalism. The British Labor Government, like
other Socialist Party goverments, has not moved an inch toward
socialism. They are trail blazers for fascism, demoralizers of the
workers in the face of the growing employers’ fascist offensive.

Let Muste enthuse for the International of MacDonald,
Noske, Chiang Kai Shek, etc., but the revolutionary workers
will support the International of Lenin, and the Russian Revo-
lution, of the Party that is carrying out the Five Year Plan
brilliantly.

Musteites—False Friends of the Soviet Union

Finally, the reactionary character of the left phrase-mongering
Muste group is exposed by their attitude towards the Soviet
Union. Muste boasts of his friendship towards the Soviet
Union. But this friendship is only a gesture. Social fascists
all over the world logically see in the Soviet Union the collapse
and defeat of their reformist program of supporting capitalism
under the pretense of gradually reforming it into socialism. Their

[Report of a speech against the Conference for Progressive
Labor Action, made in New Star Casino, New York City,
on May 10, 1931]

What Is the T. U. U. L.?

HE Trade Union Unity League is the American Section
Tof the Red International of Labor Unions. It is composed

of industrial unions, organized minorities in the reformist
organizations and unemployed councils. It organizes the whole
body of workers, but bases itself primarily on the lowest paid
and most exploited sections of the working class. It organizes
the unemployed and unites them in jointistruggle with the em-
ployed workers. It makes special eﬁorts to organize Negro,
youth and women workers. L

The T. U. U. L. is based on the class struggle. It opposes the
whole class collaboration line of the American Federation of
Labor, including union-management-cooperation, arbitration, the
no-strike policy, support of the capitalist parties, etc.

The T. U. U. L. ﬁghts to wring every possible concession
from the capitalists. Brieﬂy, the T. U. U. L. program of imme-
diate demands comprises a militant struggle against wage cuts,
against the speed-up, for unemployment insurance, for the rights
of Negro, youth, women and foreign-born workers, for the re-
lease of political prisoners,.against the war danger, and for the
defense of the Soviet Union.

whole reformistic program is ridiculed and smashed by the
workers’ gigantic success at building Socialism in the Soviet
Union. Their assurances of friendship towards the Soviet Union
are false. They are dictated simply because the radical workers
would repudiate an open stand on their part against the Soviet
Union. But beneath this pretended friendship stands a definite
and bitter hostility. The same ﬁght that Woll makes openly
against the Soviet Union, the social fascists make hypocritically
the world over.

The social fascists are part of the war machinery against the
Soviet Union. They are going along in the general attacks of
the capitalist class against the proletarian revolution. Their
special task is to destroy the prestige of the Soviet Government
among the workers, thereby facilitating the capitalist offensive
agianst the Soviet Union. Occassionally the social fascists, over-
looking the necessity for their camouﬂage of friendship to the
Soviet Union, express their real attitude towards the Russian
workers’ Government. Thus, Morris Hillquit, head of the So-
cialist Party, said in the New Leader of Feb. 4, 1928:

“The Soviet Government has been the greatest disaster and
calamity that has ever occurred to the socialist movement.. ..
Let us disassociate ourselves from the Soviet Government.”

One of the most dangerous forms of the social fascists’ enmity
against the Soviet Union is to minimize the danger of the capi-
talist war attack. By such a policy the workers are disarmed,
and led to think there is no danger, while in reality the capi-
talists are organizing feverishly for armed struggle against the
Soviet Union. Muste characteristically adopts this social fascist
line. He says, Labor Age, Feb., 1931:

- “We think that the unemployment situation in the west will
nullify any war intentions on the part of anti-Soviet nations.
Fancy Britain with over 2,600,000 idle, and Germany, with
still more; Italy with a large idle army to feed, and now even
prosperous France, with all‘ its gold, is beginning to feel its

unemployment problem——yes, fancy these countries going to
war.”

 

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 31

Here is a complete denial of the war danger in general and of
war against the Soviet Union in particular. The capitalist crisis,
which is the basic‘ cause of the war danger, Muste urges as the
reason why war is impossible. But in reality, if the war against
the Soviet Union is being delayed, it is not because the capitalists
do not want war and are not skillfully organizing for it, but
because they fear that in case they launch such a war, the work-
ers, taking Lenin’s. advice, will turn it into a civil war, and put
an end to capitalism. This is the disaster they are guarding
against and ‘this is why they use the social fascists to lull the
workers into a false sense of security.

But the social fascists are doing more than paralyzing the
workers’ defense of the Soviet Union. They are also deﬁnitely
organizing the capitalist offensive. This was shown clearly by
the exposures in the recent trials of the "Industrial Party” in
Moscow. They are ardent champions of Briand’s Pan-Europe
scheme, which is the bloc of European anti-Soviet nations. The
following quotation from the Vorwaerts of Berlin, the leading
Socialist Party paper, show how the social fascists are preparing
the ground for war:

“Russian Soviet imperialism, which has robbed a whole series
of non-Russian peoples of their! rights and principles, is striving
to extend its rule still further and to cause trouble between
other countries. This is the greatest danger of war.” (Emphasis
mine-—V/. Z. F.)

“There is no doubt that if the collapse of the Five Year Plan
should happen, then revolutionary war can become the last card
played by the Bolsheviki, and in face of this danger, the labor
and socialist international must be just as vigilant as in the
case of capitalist intervention.”

“We have no conﬁdence in the rulers in Moscow, and we
cannot help feel that when they consider a revolutionary war
to be necessary, they will employ the old tricks of all war
mongers and represent themselves as the party that has been
attacked.”

Neither Matthew Woll nor Hamilton Fish has ever made
more bitter and dangerous attacks than these against the Soviet
Union. The social fascists, of whose organization Muste is a

\

32 LITTLE BROTHERS OF “THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

part, are trying to makg the slogan of the next capitalist war:
the war to overthrow the Soviet Government. A The Second In-
ternational, in a recent resolution, practically calls upon the
workers to be ready for such a war against the Soviet Union.
The social fascists, the Muste group included, are the main so-
cial bulwark of the decaying capitalist system.

In Conclusion

Beneath its thin veneer of “radical” phrases, the C. P. L. A. in
its activities shows that it has nothing to oﬁcer the workers, either
to meet their present problems, or to prepare for their ﬁnal
emancipation. The C. P. L. A. is a tool of the A. F. of L.
bureaucrats and the bosses, and plays this game. It is’ only a
“left” maneuver of the A. F. of L. Towards such an organiza-
tion, the workers’ attitude must be one of militant attack. The
T. U. U .L. fights the C. P. L. A. leaders in open struggle in
the old unions and among the unorganized. But to the rank
and ﬁle workers who may be deluded by Musteism, as well as

towards A. F. of L. workers generally, the T.U.U.L. proposes

a common action, on the basis of the united front from below,
against the bosses and against all their agents in the working
class masquerading under the colors of labor leaders.

The T. U. U. L. is indispensable for the carrying on of the
economic struggle of the working class. Its program of class
struggle is basic to unite the workers in effective combat against
the capitalists. Its policy of building minorities in old unions,
and of establishing independent unions, corresponds to the needs
of the workers.‘ Its revolutionary goal is fundamental; the work-
ers, now facing the deepening capitalist crisis, and being inspired
by the great Russian Revolution, are looking forward to a new
social era. Every class conscious worker, every worker who
wants to defend himself now and to organize for ﬁnal emancipa-
tion, will support the Trade Union Unity League.

4 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

The T. U. U. L. is a revolutionary union; it ﬁghts for the
overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a workers’ and
farmers’ government. On its ﬁght for partial demands, the
T. U. U. L. bases its program of organization, education, and
struggle of the workers for final emancipation.

To broaden and intensify its general struggle, the T. U. U. L.
makes united front movements with the Communist Party, with
the workers in A. F. of L. unions and other proletarian organiza-
tions, and with unorganized workers.

The A. F. of L.—0rganized Strike-breaking
The T. U. U. L. ﬁghts relentlessly against the A. F. of L.

bureaucrats as the strike-breaking agents of American imperia-
lism. The T. U. U. L. organizes the workers to take the leader-
ship into their own hands, against the A. F. of L. misleaders,
in the struggles both inside and outside the old unions.

The A. F. of L. can11ot serve the trade union organizer and
leader of the working class. This has been proved by its
history of '50 years of labor betrayal. It is proved afresh by its
present policy of union-management-cooperation, which turns
its unions into adjuncts of the capitalist speed-up machinery.
The A. F. of L. is an employers’ tool in the wage-cutting cam-
paign, the so-called Hoover no wage-cut agreement being only
a smoke-screen behind which wholesale wage cuts are taking
place. The A. F. of L. is the employers’ mainstay in the ﬁght
against unemployment insurance. The A. F. of L. leaders are
jingo militarists and the most agressive organizers of the attack
against the Soviet Union. The A. F. of L. Jim-Crows the
Negro workers, cooperates with the Government to deport
foreign-born workers, and to keep militants, such as Tom
Mooney, in jail. The A. F. of L. political policy is an outright
surrender to capitalist parties. The whole program of the A.
 of L. is designed to break the resistance of the workers -and

 

vﬁ

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 5

to enable the capitalists to put across their program of war and
intensiﬁed exploitation of the workers. ‘

The A. F. of L. leaders are fascists; they are open defenders
of capitalism. there is no real diierence between Hamilton Fish
and Matthew Woll. The A. F. of L. leaders are an organized
gang of labor crooks and racketeers—racketeering was born in

the A. F. of L. Woll, Green, Hillman and Co. are modern

Farleys——strike-breakers for the capitalist class. At all costs,

the workers must prevent these corrupt and hostile elements
from exercising leadership in the class struggle.

Independent Unions Necessary

The T. U. U. L. policy of building independent industrial
unions is inevitable. Previously the old T. U. E. L. had been
strongly opposed to the formation of separate unions. But this
policy has been forced upon the organization inexorably by the
whole course of the classstruggle.

When unorganized workers undertake to organize and ﬁght,
they cannot use the A. F. of L. The A. F. of L., consisting only
of about 2,500,000 workers out of 25,000,000, and these mostly
skilled workers—has shown throughout its history that it will not
and cannot organize the unorganized. This was emphasized
afresh by the failure of the 1926 steel campaign, by the ridicul-
ous automobile campaign of a couple of years ago, and by the
recent criminal debacle in the South. For unorganized workers
the question of organization irresistibly raises the policy of build-
ing independent unions, such as the T. U. U. L. advocates.

Likewise in the A. F. of L. unions themselves, the determi-
nation of the workers to struggle leads surely to the formation
of independent unions . The A. F. of L. leaders refuse to ﬁght
the bosses and they also resist bitterly all attempts to use the
unions as instruments of real struggle. The control of the unions
cannot be captured from these leaders by the workers through
democratic means. Trade union democracy is almost completely

 

6 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

suppressed in the A. F. of L. The reactionary leaders control
the unions by gangsterism, the blacklist, and by police and

Tammany methods. For example, at the recent Philadelphia‘

convention of the I. L. G.’ W. U., although the left wing re-
presented 70% of‘ the membership, it had only 40% of the con-
vention delegation, owing to the undemocratic system of repre-
sentation and the packing of the convention by the right wing
leaders. Likewise, in the United Mine Workers, during the
elections a few years ago, John L. Lewis, its President, brazenly
stole 100,000 votes in order to defeat the left wing. Such sup-
pressions are typical of the general situation in the old unions.

The A. F. of L. leaders will split the unions rather than'Iet
the workers capture and use them for ﬁghting purposes. This
was clearly exempliﬁed when Sigman, of the I. L. G. W. U.,
expelled 30,000 cloakmakers. It was shown again when the
leaders of the Furriers’ Union, with the direct support of the
A. F. of L. top leaders, also expelled 10,000 workers. And Lewis
literally strangled the U. M. W. A. rather than let it pass into
the control of the workers. It was out of such situations that
the independent revolutionary unions of the T. U. U. L. were
literally forced into existence as separate organizations.

The T.U.U.L. works inside the old unions. It si the organizer
of the discontented masses in the A. F. of L. unions, now rising
against their misleaders and the bosses. It puts no trust in the
 F. of L. leaders and carries out a policy of independent lead-

ership by the militant workers themselves. But the T. U. U. L. .

clearly recognizes and understands that the inevitable tendency
of the struggle in the A. F. of L. unions, for reasons stated, leads
in the direction of the formation of new unions.

Growing Need for the T. U. U. L.

The whole situation in industry and among the workers makes
the T. U. U. L. increasingly necessary. With the constant
sharpening of the capitalist crisis and worsening of the condi-

 

 

 

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABORIFAKERS 7

tions of the working class, there goes a rapid radicalization of the
masses. Likewise, more and more the A. F. of L. becomes an
open strike-breaking machine, and more and more the workers
are impelled to apply the class struggle policy of the T. U. U. L.
The unorganized are forced to build new unions, in order to
ﬁght. And the organized workers also, when they try to put a
ﬁghting policy into effect, are driven into splits and have to form
new unions. The T. U. U. L. is the logical product of the class
struggle, and it must grow.

Although less than two years old, the T. U. U. L. has already
conducted many important struggles—in Gastonia, Lawrence,
Imperial Valley, the New York needle trades, etc. It has be-
come an important factor in the ﬁght against wage cuts and
speed-up. In the struggle for unemployment insurance and im-
mediate unemployment relief, the T. U. U. L. has played a big
part all over the.United States. While the A. F. of L. and the
S. P. sabotaged and betrayed the struggle of the unemployed,
the T. U. U. L. militantly carried forward the ﬁght in the face
of terriﬁc police brutality. Undoubtedly, its gigantic mass de-
monstrations, hunger marches, ﬁghts against evictions, etc.,
more than enything else, have compelled the employers to re-
cognize the unemployment situation, and to grant such niggardly
relief as has been put into effect.

The T. U. U. L. has had to function in the face of terriﬁc
resistance and attacks from the Government, the capitalists and
the A. F. of .L. and insidious attacks from the Socialist Party
and the Musteites. It has faced wholesale arrests and jailing of
militant workers and the most ﬂagrant strike-breaking activities
of the A. F. of L. and S. P. leadership. Nevertheless, the T.
U. U. L. has been able to create a wide ideological following
among the masses. But its weakness is that it has not known
how yet to crystallize this folloing correspondingly into deﬁnite
organization. Besides the ferocious opposition the T. U. U. L.
has encountered, an important factor in preventing its growth

 

8 LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS

has beenmany errors in the course of the work, it being not a

simple process to develop the technique of building revolutionary i

unions in the face of militant American imperialism. The T.
U. U. L., by its policy of self criticism, ﬁghts ruthlessly to
eliminate these wrong tendencies, even though enemies of the
movement, such as the Musteites, in characteristic fashion, try to
make_use of this self-criticism to attack the T. U. U. L. The
T. U. U. L. is the trade union leader of the workers, and it is
proving this in the struggle.

The C. P. L. A.

The so-called progressives of the Conference for Progressive
Labor Action, of which A.  Muste is the head, disagree with the
whole foregoing T. U. U. L. analysis and program. Their pro-
posals, boiled down, are, 1-that the T. U. U. L. policy of class
struggle is wrong and must be supplanted by class collaboration.
2—Thata the A. F. of L. can be used as a base for: organization
of struggle of the working class. 3-——That the T. U. U. L.
should be liquidated.

The C. P. L. A. comes forward with a whole program of
measures to revive the A. F. of L. unions. Among these are
industrial unionism, amalgamation, labor party, organization of
the unorganized, etc. Butthe substance of all this, as we shall
see, is merely the acceptance of the reactionary line of the A.
F. of L. bureaucracy under the cover of a smoke-screen of “left”
phrases. The heart of Musteism is radical talk and reactionary
action. ’

The C. P. L. A. is the Socialist Party forces in the trade
unions. Extreme right socialists, such as Thomas and Maurer,
occupy leadin.g positions in the C. P. L. A., but the dominating
elements are the so-called “left” Stanley group of the S. P. Aili-
liated to the top group of the C. P. L. A. also are remnants
of former Labor Party leaders, miscellaneous trade union bureau-
crats, liberals and Brookwood intellectuals, dilletante churchmen,

LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE BIG LABOR FAKERS 9

social workers, etc. And to give the group a red tinge, there are
renegade Communists of the Lore, Lovestone, Cannon and Weis-
bord tendencies. L

Radical Phrases—Reactionary Action

The Muste pseudo-left tendency is world-wide. It is to be
found in many countries. It is the product of the growing world
crisis of capitalism. As the workers become radicalized such
elements see the danger of these masses passing to the control
of the revolutionary unions and the Communist Party. Hence,
without changing their basic reactionary line, they redden their
propaganda in order to retain ‘a hold on the workers. They burst
forward with radical demagogy and pretended opposition to the
right wing. But in spite of all this, they nevertheless go along
with the; right-wing policy in all its essentials. Of such a char-
acter are the Maxton-Cook group in the unions and Labor Party
of Great Britain, the “left” social democrats in Germany, etc.

These fake left groups are in reality only specialized auxiliaries
of the right-wing bureaucracy. Their role is, with radical phrases,
to prevent the discontented masses from breaking away from the
control and organization of the right wing. They create illu-
sions among the masses that, after all, there is nothing funda-
mentally wrong with the reactionary unions and the Socialist
Party, except that they need a certain ﬁxing up, which these fake
"lefts” propose to bring about. Thus they tend to tie the work-
ers to these reactionary’ bodies. Such phrase-mongers are most
insidious enemies of the workers. They paralyze the ﬁght at
every step. They represent a serious barrier to the gowth of the
revolutionary unions and to the development of the workers’
struggle in general.

The deepening crisis is especially a period of such “left” man-
euvers. Even the right trade-union bureaucracy itself takes a
hand with “left” phrases, at the present time, to cover up its
reactionary line. Thus the "radical” ‘proposal of many bureau-
