ZENAKUREN translates best as: "All Japan Federation of student
Autonomous Associations"

The Japanese student moveent got its start in 1948 as a result of
struggles against tuition raises and a strike of 114 universities.
The Zengakuren (z.) was founded at a rally held 18-20 sept., 1948 in
Tokyo and was dominated initially by the Japanese communist Party's
(JCP) youth group.

In 1956 new militant Zenakuren factions were formed in response
to the failures of the JCP's policies. since 1956 all the major
student struggles have been initiated and led by the militant Zenga~

kuren factions.

In 1959-60 the struggle of the Zengakuren to prevent ratification
of the Japan—U.S. Mutual Security Treaty (AMPO) was waged with fierce
street actions involving tens of thousands of students, young workers
and citizens. While these actions were a new high in political and
street action for the Zengakuren, they failed to stop .“- the treaty
and the zengakuren factions went through a period of reorganization
until 1965. This was especially true of the faction that led the
'59-60 struggle, the Bundt (communist League) faction of the Z.

In Dac.. 1966 the sampa Rengo (Three faction) Zengakuren was
formed by an allianpe of the three main tendencies of (1) shagakudo,
(2) Chukaku and (3) s.¥:.L.'—E..F, Shagakudo is the student group of the
~Bundt. chukaku is the student group of the Japanese Revolutionary
Communist League—National Committee (JRCL-NC). shaseido means
Socialist Youth League‘and several groups in Shaseido formed the third
tendency. Sampa Range 2. included additional small groups.

Parallel to the Sampa Rengo 2.,two other Zengakurens existed. The
JCP'8 Z.. Minsei, continued from 1948 to the present. The Kakumaru
(JRCL-Revolutionary Marxist Faction = JRCL-RM?) had formed its own
Zengakuren around 1962 and it too continued to the present.

11 groups except

In July, 196 Chukaku—Z. split from sampa Rengo-Z. and
‘ formed what is now known as the Hantei (Anti

Imperialist Zengakuren).

, Each major political tendency amoung the students competes fpr
control of the 510 self-governing university student governents
representing over 800,000 students. Today there are 5 major 2's,
each calling itself "the Zengakuren.“ Each of these represents a
number of university governments, sometimes cooperatin, sometimes
